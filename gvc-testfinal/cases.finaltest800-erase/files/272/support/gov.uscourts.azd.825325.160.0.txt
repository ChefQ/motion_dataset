20

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Plaintiff Penguin Group (USA), Inc. (“Penguin”)

moves for summary judgment on its claim for copyright infringement against defendant

22

American Buddha. There is no genuine issue of material fact and plaintiff is entitled to

23

judgment as a matter of law.

24

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

25

American Buddha, without permission, scans Penguin’s copyrighted books,

26

literally from cover to cover, and publishes the entirety of these books on the Internet for

27

anyone in the world to read. This prima facie infringement is not itself disputed. Instead,

28

American Buddha contends that its actions are permitted because it is a “library,” and its

1

actions are somehow allowed by 17 U.S.C. § 108, or because its actions constitute “fair

2

use” and are somehow allowed by 17 U.S.C. § 107. An analysis of these contentions

3

demonstrates they are without merit as a matter of law. No person and no entity—

4

“library” or otherwise—may lawfully engage in the conduct engaged in by American

5

Buddha: copying the entirety of plaintiff’s copyrighted books and publishing those

6

copies on the Internet, for the world to read.

American Buddha operates two websites, www.naderlibrary.com and

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

www.american-buddha.com (“Websites”). Statement of Facts 1 (“SOF”) 9. Each of the

10

Websites contains complete copies of four of plaintiff’s copyrighted works: Oil! by

11

Upton Sinclair and It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis; and two new translations: E.

12

J. Kenney’s translation of The Golden Ass by Apuleius and R.E. Latham’s translation of

13

On the Nature of the Universe by Lucretius, (the “Works”), which are available in their

14

entirety to anyone accessing either or both Websites. SOF 1-6, 9-10, 14-15.
To place the Works on the Websites, American Buddha first removes all pages

15
16

from the binding of a physical book, scans the physical pages and the cover to make the

17

first copy, creates a second copy by running an OCR program that recognizes the text of

18

the Works from the scan, and then copies that into an .htm file, a third copy. SOF 13.

19

The third copy is then itself duplicated and one copy each is placed on each Website. Id.

20

Other, backup copies are maintained on at least six computers and hard drives. SOF 24.

21

American Buddha’s purpose and intent is to distribute the Works on its Websites, SOF

22

16, that is, to “lend” its copies of plaintiff’s Works. SOF 18.
The Works are freely available to the public on each Website, and are easily found

23
24

by major search engines. SOF 10, 19. 2 In fact, defendant works very hard to draw

A complete statement of facts is concurrently submitted.

The nature of the Websites and the availability of the Works is also subject to judicial
notice. See Demer v. IBM Corp. Ltd. Plan, 975 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1081 at n.9 (D. Ariz.
2013) (taking judicial notice of website where its authenticity was not disputed by the
parties).

attention to the Works and to all works on its Websites, so that users will look at them.

SOF 19. Users may read the entirety of the Works on the Websites, and may save or

print the entirety of a Work or Works from the Websites. SOF 20, 22. Penguin owns

publication rights in each of the Works, actively markets and sells each of the Works, and

has not authorized American Buddha to publish the Works on the Websites. SOF 1-4, 7-

ARGUMENT

8

A.

9

Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings and supporting documents

Defendant has not disputed plaintiff’s prima facie case.

10

“show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is

11

entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,

12

477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); see also Wolf v. Sierra Vista, No. CV-13-00114-TUC-JGZ,

13

2014 WL 2885480 at *3 (D. Ariz. June 25, 2014) (stating full standard).

14

The parties’ Joint Statement demonstrates that plaintiff’s prima facie case of

15

infringement is not disputed. Dkt. # 102. Defendant did not raise therein any question

16

about either plaintiff’s ownership or defendant’s copying, and had not raised any such

17

issue in the previous twelve months of this matter. In the Joint Report, under “The

18

Nature of the Case,” defendant raised affirmative defenses to infringement, only.

19

Similarly, with regard to the Joint Report section regarding what is to be proven in this

20

matter, defendant raised only affirmative defenses. In the section on “Factual and legal

21

issues genuinely in dispute,” defendant raised affirmative defenses only. Defendant has

22

not raised any issues regarding plaintiff’s copyright ownership, nor has defendant raised

23

any issue that its actions infringe plaintiff’s Works in the first instance, absent an

24

affirmative defense. Instead defendant argues that §§ 107 and 108 of the Copyright Act

25

permit its actions. For the purposes of this motion, of course, plaintiff presents herein a

26

prima facie case of both ownership and infringement.

27

B.

28

17 U.S.C. § 106 provides to the copyright owner the exclusive rights of

American Buddha infringes Penguin’s exclusive rights.

1

reproduction, distribution and display of its copyrighted works. To establish copyright

2

infringement, a plaintiff must prove: (1) ownership; and (2) unauthorized copying, here

3

in the form of reproduction, distribution and display. Penguin is the holder of the

4

copyrights in the Works and is entitled to enforce these rights. 17 U.S.C. § 201(d); SOF

5

1-8. American Buddha’s Websites, which it calls its “online library,” infringe Penguin’s

6

reproduction rights, its distribution rights and its display rights. Infringement of any one

7

of these exclusive rights with regard to any Work entitles plaintiff to bring an action for

8

infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 501. Penguin seeks an injunction prohibiting defendant’s

9

actions, “to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 502.

10
11

1.

American Buddha infringes Penguin’s reproduction right.

American Buddha’s publication of the Works on its Websites infringes Penguin’s

12

reproduction right. The Copyright Act establishes Penguin’s exclusive right to

13

“reproduce the copyrighted work in copies.” 17 U.S.C. § 106(1). “Copies” are “material

14

objects … in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed.” 17.

15

U.S.C. § 101. Defendant does not dispute that it physically scans Penguin’s Works and

16

places the resulting text into .html pages that users read, and may save or print, from

17

either or both Websites. SOF 13-15. Defendant also makes multiple additional copies of

18

each Work, placing six copies on other computers and on backup media. SOF 24. Each

19

copy constitutes a discrete infringement. Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., --- U.S.

20

---, 134 S. Ct. 1962, 1969, 188 L. Ed. 2d 979 (2014).

21

Scanning a work to create a digital copy infringes the copyright owner’s

22

reproduction right. In Advance Magazine Publishers, Inc. v. Leach, 466 F. Supp. 2d 628

23

(D. Md. 2006), plaintiff alleged that “Defendant violated its exclusive right to reproduce

24

the publications by scanning into electronic form the text, original illustrations, and cover

25

art of its publications.” Id. at 638. The court easily found a violation of the owner’s

26

exclusive reproduction right, holding that “[a]lthough Defendant used a scanner to create

27

a digital copy of a work, rather than a photocopier to print a physical copy, the methods

28

of copying are equivalent and they are both infringing. A digital copy made without the

Case 4:13-cv-02075-JGZ Document 160 Filed 12/16/14 Page 5 of 16

1

owner's permission is copyright infringement.” Id.
Similarly, in Society of Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory, where

2
3

“identical or near-identical reproductions of the Monastery's Works had been reproduced

4

and ‘were available on [defendant’s] Website,’” the court held that “there is no genuine

5

issue of material fact as to whether the Archbishop reproduced and displayed exact or

6

near-exact copies of the Monastery's Works.” 689 F.3d 29, 49 (1st Cir. 2012) (emphasis

7

supplied), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, 133 S. Ct. 1315, 185 L.Ed.2d 195 (2013); 3 see also

8

New York Times Co., Inc. v. Tasini, 533 U.S. 483, 488-91, 498 (2001) (online database

9

allowing users to “view, print, or download” individual articles infringed both

10

reproduction and distribution rights of copyright owners).
The facts here are indistinguishable from Leach and Gregory. American Buddha

11
12

scans Penguin’s Works in their entirety, including the text, illustrations and cover art, and

13

places the resulting copies on its Websites, as in Leach. The copies are “identical or

14

near-identical reproductions” of Penguin’s Works, as in both decisions. They infringe

15

Penguin’s exclusive reproduction right.

16

2.

American Buddha infringes Penguin’s distribution right.

American Buddha’s publication of Penguin’s copyrighted Works on the Websites

17
18

infringes Penguin’s distribution right. The Copyright Act provides in pertinent part the

19

exclusive right to “distribute copies … of the copyrighted work to the public by …

20

lending.” 17 U.S.C. § 106(3). American Buddha’s publication of the Works on the

21

Websites constitutes distribution.
American Buddha states within its Websites that it “makes available” Penguin’s

22
23

Works on those Websites. SOF 16. In fact, its specific intent is to place works on its

24

website so that others can read them. SOF 16-19. Making a work available infringes an

25
26
27
28

3

Gregory also held that text on a website is sufficiently “fixed” to constitute a “copy”
under the Act. 689 F.3d at 55 (“The copies also were embodied or ‘fixed’ in a tangible
medium of expression,’ as they were loaded on the Archbishop’s computer server and
posted to his Website.”).

owner’s distribution right. E.g. Interscope Records v. Duty, 2006 WL 988086 at *2 (D.

2

Ariz. April 14, 2006) (holding that the distribution right is synonymous with publication,

3

which includes an offer to distribute); Advance Magazine Publishers, Inc. v. Leach, 466

4

F. Supp. 2d 628, 638 (D. Md. 2006) (“Defendant operates what is essentially an online

5

database of literary works, and by making available unauthorized copies of plaintiff’s

6

publications, he has infringed its right to distribution.”); New York Times Co., Inc. v.

7

Tasini, 533 U.S. 483, 488-91, 498 (2001) (online database allowing users to “view, print,

8

or download” individual articles infringed both reproduction and distribution rights of

9

copyright owners); see also 2 Melville Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright

10

§ 8.11[B] [4][d] at 8–154.10 (2013) (“No consummated act of actual distribution need be

11

demonstrated … to implicate the copyright owner's distribution right.”).

12

In Hotaling v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, 118 F.3d 199 (4th Cir.

13

1997), the defendant Church operated a library that made unauthorized copies of the

14

Hotalings’ copyrighted works on microfiche. Id. at 201-02. Plaintiffs alleged that the

15

Church infringed their distribution right “by distributing unauthorized copies of their

16

works to the public.” Id. at 203. Because the libraries did not keep any records of

17

microfiche lending, however, “the record [did] not contain any evidence showing specific

18

instances within the limitations period in which the libraries loaned the infringing copies

19

to members of the public.” Id. The Church countered that in order to establish

20

distribution, the evidence would have to show that someone actually browsed the

21

microfiche. Id. The Fourth Circuit disagreed, however, holding that:

22
23
24
25
26
27

When a public library adds a work to its collection, lists the
work in its index or catalog system, and makes the work
available to the borrowing or browsing public, it has
completed all the steps necessary for distribution to the
public. At that point, members of the public can visit the
library and use the work. Were this not to be considered
distribution within the meaning of § 106(3), a copyright
holder would be prejudiced by a library that does not keep
records of public use, and the library would unjustly profit by
its own omission.
Id. In this matter, defendant has asserted that it cannot tell what or how many users have

Case 4:13-cv-02075-JGZ Document 160 Filed 12/16/14 Page 7 of 16

1

viewed the Works on the Websites. SOF 29. Defendant has by its own description made

2

the work available to the public, completing all steps necessary for distribution to the

3

public. In fact, just as in Hotaling, it is defendant’s testimony that as a library, it placed

4

two copies of the Works on its Websites, included the copies in its index system, and in

5

its own words made the copies available to the public. SOF 12-16. Moreover, it worked

6

diligently to bring the Works on its Websites to the public’s attention. SOF 19.

7

That American Buddha’s Websites make copies of the Works available to anyone

8

with an internet connection establishes a violation of Penguin’s distribution rights, under

9

Hotaling, the Nimmer treatise, and other decisions. In Atlantic Recording Corp. v.

10

Howell, 554 F. Supp. 2d 976 (D. Ariz. 2008), Judge Wake concluded that evidence of

11

receipt of a copy—not just making a copy available—was required to establish liability

12

under 17 U.S.C. § 106 (3) where the plaintiff alleged unlawful “file sharing.” Id. at 983-

13

84. The court did find, however, that plaintiff’s agent’s receipt of unauthorized copies

14

from defendant would have been sufficient to establish liability, except that an issue of

15

fact existed regarding whether defendant was responsible for making the unauthorized

16

copies available; defendant swore that he did not place the copyrighted works in a place

17

to be made available to others; that someone else may have done so; and that a computer

18

program may have made the unauthorized copies available without his authorization.

19

There is no such question of responsibility or intention in this matter, however.

20

Moreover, third parties have in fact received unauthorized copies from defendant. SOF

21

30, 31. Even the rule established in Howell would find infringement by distribution

22

here. 4

23
24
25
26
27
28

4

Moreover, the facts here are far more similar to Hotaling than to Howell. American
Buddha holds itself out as a library—not as an individual running a file sharing program.
See Diversy v. Schmidly, 738 F.3d 1196, 1202 n.7 (10th Cir. 2013) (applying Hotaling,
not Howell, where case concerned a library, not a file-sharing site, because “[a] patron
could visit the library and use the work. This is the essence of a violation of the
copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute his work via lending.” (internal quotation
marks omitted) (citing Hotaling)). The record here is replete with evidence that it has
been defendant’s constant intention to distribute copies of the Works, unlike in Howell.
And Penguin has established that defendant actually distributed the Works. SOF 31-32.

3.

American Buddha infringes Penguin’s display right.

American Buddha’s publication of the Works on the Websites violates Penguin’s
2

display rights. The Copyright Act provides exclusive rights for the copyright owner of a
3

literary work to “display the copyrighted work publicly.” 17 U.S.C. § 106(5).
4
5
6
7

[T]he important function of the display right with respect to
literary … works … can be found in its application to the
transmission of the manuscript or printed version of such
works so that they may be read by electronic means on
cathode ray tubes or otherwise through computer technology.
2 Nimmer on Copyright § 8.20[A].

8

“To ‘display’ a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by means of a
9

film, slide, television image, or any other device or process.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis
10

supplied). As discussed above, American Buddha shows copies of Penguin’s works via
11

its Websites. See Playboy Ents., Inc. v. Frena, 839 F. Supp. 1552, 1557 (M.D. Fla. 1993)
12

(“The display right precludes unauthorized transmission of the display from one place to
13

another, for example, by a computer screen.”); Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 508
14

F.3d 1146, 1161 (9th Cir. 2007) (display of copyrighted photos on a website constituted
15

prima facie case of display right infringement). Finally, display on websites constitutes a
16

“public” display within the Copyright Act.
17
18
19
20
21
22

[Defendant] “display[ed]” the Works publicly—that is, he
“show[ed] a copy of” the Works “by means of a ... device or
process,” 17 U.S.C. § 101—when he posted the Works on his
website. Although the question of whether a computer has
“displayed” a copyrighted work may be a difficult one in
other contexts, it is beyond question here that [defendant] has
“displayed” the Works on his website. We need not delineate
the outer bounds of the scope of the term “display” where, as
here, the fact that the Works were “displayed” on the
[defendant’s] website is undisputed.

23

Gregory, 689 F.3d at 55 (internal citation omitted); see also Leach, 466 F. Supp. 2d at

24

637 (“Defendant's posting of Plaintiff's publications on his websites infringe Plaintiff’s

25

right of display.”).

26
27
28

Penguin’s witness was able to read, print, and save each of the Works from American
Buddha’s Websites. Id. Even under Howell, that establishes infringement of the
distribution right. 554 F. Supp. 2d at 985.

Case 4:13-cv-02075-JGZ Document 160 Filed 12/16/14 Page 9 of 16

Again, infringement of any one of plaintiff’s reproduction, distribution, or display

1
2

rights entitles plaintiff to bring this action.

3

C.

4

American Buddha’s conduct is not protected by sections 107 or 108 of
the Copyright Act.

Plaintiff anticipates that American Buddha will argue that its conduct is excused
5

by either or both sections 107 of the Copyright act (fair use) or 108 (library exception). 5

6

These affirmative defenses—which American Buddha bears the burden of establishing—
7

do not authorize American Buddha’s prima facie infringement of Penguin’s Works.
8

1.

9

Defendant’s publication of Penguin’s copyrighted Works is not
fair use.

Fair use requires the court to “look to the nature and objects of the selections

10
11

made, the quantity and value of the materials use, and the degree in which the use may

12

prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.”

13

Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 576 (1994) (quoting the common law

14

formation). American Buddha reproduces, distributes and displays Penguin’s Works in

15

their entirety on its Websites. Defendant’s prima facie infringement is not authorized as

16

fair use.

17

a.

First factor: defendant’s use is non-transformative.

The first fair use factor requires evaluation of “the purpose and character of the

18
19

use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational

20

purposes.” 17 U.S.C. §107(1). This factor focuses on “whether the new work merely

21

supersedes the objects of the original creation, or whether and to what extent it is

22

‘transformative.’” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 1166.

23

Here, American Buddha creates complete copies of the Works, and “[t]here is

24

little transformative about copying the entirety or large portions of a work verbatim.”

25

L.A. Times v. Free Republic, No. CV 98-7840 MMM (AJWx), 2000 WL 565200 at *6

26
5

27
28

Defendant has, at various times, suggested that it will advance a common law copyright
exemption for libraries as an affirmative defense. Despite repeated requests, defendant
has not provided any explanation of the meaning or scope of any such exemption.

(C.D. Cal. April 4, 2000), cited with approval by A&M Records v. Napster, 239 F.3d

2

1004, 1017 (9th Cir. 2001). The purpose and character is identical—to allow readers to

3

read the identical literary works. Id.

4

American Buddha’s “non-profit” status does not tip the first factor in its favor.

5

See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584 (“[T]he mere fact that a use is educational and not for

6

profit does not insulate it from a finding of infringement.”); Worldwide Church of God v.

7

Philadelphia Church of God, 227 F.3d 1110, 1117-18 (9th Cir. 2000) (first fair use factor

8

weighed in favor of plaintiff despite non-profit status, where defendant copied entire

9

works for same purpose). The relevant inquiry is not defendant’s corporate form but

10

rather whether it “stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without

11

paying the customary price.” Harper & Row Publ’rs, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S.

12

539, 562 (1985). Posting the Works attracts more users to the Websites, and it is

13

undisputed that defendant solicits and receives donations from the operation of the

14

Websites, and defendant seeks more viewers. SOF 23. Cf. Los Angeles Times, 2000 WL

15

at *12 “(“[D]efendants … copy and post plaintiffs’ news articles, which are then

16

available to others visiting the site free of charge. Since the general purpose of the site is

17

to provide a forum where individuals can discuss current events and media coverage of

18

them, posting copies of plaintiffs' articles assists in attracting viewers to the site.”). This

19

factor weighs in favor of Penguin.

20
21

b.

Second factor: the Works are literary works.

The second factor is the nature of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. §107(2).

22

Generally, “creative works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than

23

informational and functional works.” Dr. Seuss Enters., L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.,

24

109 F.3d 1394, 1402 (9th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). Here, each of the Works is a

25

creative literary work. Oil! and It Can’t Happen Here are fictional works entitled to the

26

highest level of protection. The Golden Ass and On the Nature of the Universe, though

27

translations, “fall closer to the creative end of the spectrum than the informational or

28

factual end.” Gregory, 689 F.3d at 62. This factor is in Penguin’s favor.

c.

Third factor: defendant publishes the entirety of each
Work.

The third factor is the “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation

3

to the copyrighted work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. §107(3). “[T]he extent of permissible

4

copying varies with the purpose and character of the use.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586–87,

5

114 S. Ct. 1164. “While wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per se, copying an

6

entire work militates against finding a fair use.” Worldwide Church, 227 F.3d at 1118.

7

“We have found no published case holding that fair use protected the verbatim copying,

8

without criticism, of a written work in its entirety.” Id. at 1120. Here, because American

9

Buddha copies the entirety of each Work, the factor weighs decisively against fair use.

10

d.

11

Fourth factor: publication of the sort defendant engages
in would significantly limit the market for the Works.

The fourth fair use factor is “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
12

value of the copyrighted work.” 17 U.S.C. § 107(4). The fourth factor is “undoubtedly
13

the single most important element of fair use.” Harper & Row Publ’rs, Inc. v. Nation
14

Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 566 (1985).
15

Importantly, under the fourth factor, courts “consider not only the extent of harm
16

caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and
17

widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant … would result in a
18

substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original.” Campbell, 510
19

U.S. at 590 (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also
20

Harper & Row 471 U.S. at 568 (“[T]o negate fair use one need only show that if the
21

challenged use ‘should become widespread it would adversely affect the potential market
22

for the copyrighted work.’” (quoting Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios,
23

Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 484 (1984)) (emphasis in Harper & Row).
24

It is without question that if others were also to place complete copies of
25

Penguin’s books on their websites, there would be a substantially adverse impact on the
26

potential market for the original. Gregory, 689 F.3d at 64. “If anyone could freely
27

access the Works, electronically or otherwise, [Penguin] would have no market in which
28

1

to try and publish, disseminate or sell its [works].” Id. at 65.

2

None of the fair use factors favor defendant. Defendant copies the entirety of

3

works of literature and places them on the internet for the world to read. This would

4

become a genuine substitute for Penguin’s works if widespread.

5

2.

6

The library exception, § 108 does not exempt American
Buddha’s conduct; nothing in the library exception allows
concerted copying and distribution of entire works.

7

Section 108 of the Copyright Act (the “library exception”) provides certain

8

specific exceptions to liability for reproduction and distribution of works undertaken by

9

qualifying libraries or archives, but the library exception does not swallow owner’s rights

10

in any way. No library6 can freely scan the entirety of copyrighted works and place

11

copies on the Internet for all to see.
American Buddha has never indicated in any document, including the Joint

12
13

Report, exactly which provision of the library exception purportedly covers its activity.

14

Most clearly do not apply on their face, often because of but specifically not limited to

15

defendant’s failure to investigate or determine the availability of a reasonable

16

replacement copy. SOF 34.
Plaintiff simply guesses that defendant will claim subsection (d) applies to its

17
18

actions. Reliance on subsection (d) fails, however, because that section allows the

19

copying and distribution of only a “small part” of a work. The record is clear that

20

defendant copies and makes available the entirety of each Work. Moreover, American

21

Buddha has already made the copies that it distributes to users, before a request is ever

22

made. The language of the section clearly addresses a copy, or a “small part,” being

23

made only after a request is made. 17 U.S.C. § 108(d) (“where the user makes his or her

24

request”). Defendant may argue that it only distributes individual chapters at each click,

25

and that “individual chapters” constitute a “small part” of the work. In fact, defendant

26
6

27
28

For the purposes of this motion only, Penguin assumes without agreeing that American
Buddha is a “library” as that term is used in the Copyright Act; even if defendant is a
library, its actions are not permitted by section 108.

has already copied and made available every chapter of each Work on its Websites.

2

Each Work is entirely available and in fact has been entirely reproduced and distributed.

3

SOF 31, 32. 7

4

D.

5

Defendant’s continuing infringement of plaintiff’s copyrights constitutes

Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief.

6

irreparable harm warranting a permanent injunction. See 17 U.S.C. § 502(a).

7

“Irreparable harm is traditionally defined as harm for which there is no adequate legal

8

remedy, such as an award of damages.” Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, -- F.3d

9

----, 2014 WL 3029759 at * 11 (9th Cir. 2014). Irreparable harm may be associated with

10

an “intangible” injury—like one to reputation, Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television

11

& Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir 1991), or with other injuries that

12

make damage calculation difficult. Defendant’s ongoing infringement irreparably harms

13

Penguin through inflicting difficult to measure reputational damage, through encouraging

14

widespread infringement that cannot be remedied by damages, and by robbing Penguin of

15

the right to control its intellectual property.
The presentation of the Works on the Websites falls far below Penguin’s standards

16
17

of presentation, damaging Penguin’s reputation. American Buddha presents the text

18

against a colored background; randomly bolds passages not bolded by the author; and

19

inserts random images and commentary not included in the Penguin version of the

20

Works. SOF 21, 39. This departure from Penguin’s high standards damages Penguin’s

21

goodwill with its customers, including its readers and its distribution partners, and with

22

authors who choose to publish with Penguin. SOF 38, 39, 40, 41. Cf. Apple, Inc. v.

23
7

24
25
26
27
28

Additionally, section 108 does not excuse a library from violation of Penguin’s display
rights, in any event. Section 108 provides that “it is not an infringement of copyright for
a library or archives … to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work …
or to distribute such copy or phonorecord … if (1) the reproduction or distribution is
made [under specified conditions].” 17 U.S.C. §108(a) (emphasis supplied). The only
mention of the display right in section 108 appears in subsection (h), but that applies, like
other sections, only if it has been determined that a copy cannot be obtained at a
reasonable price. That determination has not been, and could not be, made. SOF 34.

Psystar Corp., 658 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th Cir. 2011) (affirming grant of preliminary

2

injunction because damage to brand, business reputation and goodwill constituted

3

irreparable harm); see also eBay v. Bidder’s Edge, Inc., 100 F. Supp. 2d 1058, 1066

4

(N.D. Cal. 2000) (“Harm resulting from … lost customer goodwill is irreparable because

5

it is neither easily calculable, nor easily compensable and is therefore an appropriate basis

6

for injunctive relief.”).
American Buddha’s Websites subject Penguin’s Works to potential infringement

7
8

without limit, allowing anyone with an internet connection to acquire Penguin’s Works

9

for free. SOF 10. Unchecked dissemination of a copyrighted work renders it

10

“‘vulnerable to continuing infringement on an enormous scale’ that cannot be redressed

11

with money damages.” Lions Gate Films, Inc. v. Does, 2014 WL 3895240 at *6 (C.D.

12

Cal. Aug. 8, 2014) (citation omitted). Defendant has testified that is has no records

13

concerning the distribution of the Works. SOF 29. Defendant has also repeatedly stated

14

that it has extremely limited resources. SOF 35. Both that a damage award would be

15

incalculable, and that American Buddha would be unlikely to satisfy an award, further

16

justify injunctive relief. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 518 F.

17

Supp. 2d 1197, 1216-18 (C.D. Cal. 2007). 8
Injunctive relief is also appropriate because defendant has vehemently stated that

18
19

its infringement will not cease absent an injunction. SOF 28.

20

A plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law where, absent an
injunction, the defendant “is likely to continue infringing” its
copyright(s). Warner Bros., 575 F.Supp.2d at 553; see
SimplexGrinnell v. Integrated Sys., 642 F.Supp.2d 167, 196–
97 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (finding remedies at law inadequate where
evidence suggested defendant would continue unauthorized
use of copyright). … No evidence exists in the record to
suggest that Vergara has or will stop copying and selling the
plaintiffs’ ISMs. Hence, an award of monetary damages
cannot adequately compensate the plaintiffs for the harm they

24
25
26
27
28

8

Though it has no records, defendant may predict that there has been little distribution.
But the relevant calculation for irreparable harm is the amount of infringement that could
occur through the Websites if defendant’s infringement is left unchecked. Grokster, 518
F. Supp. 2d at 1219.

have suffered.
Person Educ. v. Vergara, 2010 WL 3744033 at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010). Defendant

2

has testified it will continue its unauthorized use: “I’m not going to take them off. …
3

This is a library. They’re in the -- in the archive, that’s it. You’re not getting them off.”
4

SOF 28. Defendant acts without permission because it does not consider permission “a
5

relevant parameter.” SOF 28. Defendant has repeatedly responded to copyright holders’
6

takedown requests with a bare assertion that it is a “library,” and defendant has asserted
7

that it will not cease its ongoing infringement. SOF 12, 28.
8

Finally, plaintiff asks the Court to permanently enjoin American Buddha from
9

publishing any of Penguin’s copyrighted works. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that
10

“it is appropriate to permanently enjoin the future infringement of copyrighted works …
11

even if not directly in issue because liability has been established between the parties, and
12

the threat of harm through future infringement of [the other work] is real.” Apple, Inc. v.
13

Psystar Corp., 658 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2011)), citing Walt Disney Co. v. Powell,
14

897 F.2d 565, 568 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“Where, as here, liability has been determined
15

adversely to the infringer, there has been a history of continuing infringement and a
16

significant threat of future infringement remains, it is appropriate to permanently enjoin
17

the future infringement of works owned by the plaintiff but not in suit.”). Here,
18

defendants’ Websites contain hundreds if not thousands of works, and defendant adds
19

works consistently. Absent an injunction preventing infringement of all Penguin works,
20

Penguin will be forced into repeated litigation to protect its exclusive rights.
