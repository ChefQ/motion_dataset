Plaintiffs’ motion misapprehends the high standard confronting a motion for
reconsideration, unfairly describes this Court’s careful opinion, and misinterprets
now-controlling law. Rather than showing that the Court was “misled” into a
“palpable” error of law or fact, E.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(h)(3), Plaintiffs accuse the
Court of ignoring evidence that it previously relied on, but as the Court made clear
that evidence has now become irrelevant under intervening Supreme Court
precedent. To be precise, Plaintiffs are not seeking to correct a palpable error
based on an inadvertent oversight as they claim, but instead are challenging this
Court’s reading of M&G Polymers, USA LLC v. Tackett, 135 S.Ct. 926 (2015).
For that reason, their motion does not present a proper basis for reconsideration,
and even if it did, their arguments were properly rejected. Their motion should be
denied.
ARGUMENT
E.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(h)(3) is intentionally strict about the content of a motion
for reconsideration, and Plaintiffs do not come close to meeting the standard.
Moreover, the evidence they present was well known to this Court, predates the
class period, and as this Court implicitly recognized is now irrelevant after Tackett.
Finally, this Court properly rejected, as inconsistent with Tackett, their argument
that their health benefits are vested because eligibility for them is “tied” to
eligibility for pension benefits.

PLAINTIFFS CANNOT MEET THE HIGH STANDARD FOR
RECONSIDERATION.
Under E.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(h)(3), a motion for reconsideration will be

granted only when the Court has been “misled” by the parties into a “palpable”
error of law or fact. Ososki v. St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 162 F. Supp. 2d 714,
718 (E.D. Mich. 2001). An error is “palpable” only if it is “obvious, clear,
unmistakable, manifest, or plain” from the face of the opinion; mere disagreement
with the court’s reasoning is not enough. Id. Generally, “courts disfavor motions
for reconsideration because they consume a court’s scarce time for attention to a
matter that has already been decided.” Parisi v. Heck, No. 3:14-cv-346, 2015 WL
5916416, at *1 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 9, 2015).
At bottom, Plaintiffs’ position is that “the District Court’s recent entry of
summary judgment against Plaintiffs based on its reading of Tackett is manifestly
wrong.” Pls.’ Br. at 2. In other words, Plaintiffs simply disagree with this Court’s
careful analysis of Tackett and want to litigate that issue again; Plaintiffs point to
no legal arguments that they did not make, or could not have made, in their
opposition to Defendants’ motion. Indeed, they seriously short-change the Court
by ignoring its careful discussion of Tackett, including its conclusion that “at a
minimum, . . . a court must find a clear manifestation of intent, evinced in the
language of the contract, before concluding that the parties intended to confer
lifetime benefits.” Reese v. CNH Industrial N.V., No. 04-cv-70592, 2015 WL
2

Pg ID 16987

5679827, at *10 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2015). The remedy for their disagreement
with this conclusion is an appeal to the Sixth Circuit, not a motion for
reconsideration.

See E.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(h)(3) (“[T]he Court will not grant

motions for rehearing or reconsideration that merely present the same issues ruled
upon by the Court, either expressly or by reasonable implication.”).
Plaintiffs also unfairly accuse the Court of ignoring evidence.

Judge

Duggan presided over this case for almost twelve years as well as the predecessor
case styled Yolton v. El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co., 318 F. Supp. 2d 455 (E.D.
Mich. 2003), aff’d, 435 F.3d 571 (6th Cir. 2006). In the September 28, 2015
decision at issue, Judge Duggan discussed the Yolton decision (2015 WL 5679827,
at *7-8); he also discussed both of his prior decisions in this case, as well as the
two Sixth Circuit decisions in this case (id. at *2-5). See also Reese v. CNH
Global N.V., No. 04-cv-70592, 2007 WL 2484989 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 29, 2007),
aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 574 F.3d 315 (6th Cir. 2009) (“Reese I”); Reese v.
CNH Global N.V., No. 04-cv-70592, 2007 WL 2484989 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 3,
2011), rev’d, 694 F.3d 681 (6th Cir. 2012) (“Reese II”). As shown below, those
earlier decisions directly addressed the very evidence Plaintiffs now invoke. It is
egregiously unfair to suggest that Judge Duggan ignored any of the purported
evidence that Plaintiffs cite. Rather, as he made clear in his decision, “the Court
concludes that its prior determination that the parties intended to confer lifetime

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 449 Filed 10/21/15 Pg 5 of 12

Pg ID 16988

healthcare benefits is no longer viable in light of the Supreme Court’s intervening
decision in Tackett.” 2015 WL 5679827, at *10 (emphasis added).
Plaintiffs have relied on the extrinsic evidence attached to their motion—two
letters from C.J. Devine (dated 1971 and 1990)—in nearly every merits paper they
have submitted to this Court since this case began almost twelve years ago.
Plaintiffs have likewise argued in numerous filings that the company’s elimination
of the FAS 106 letter supported vesting. See Pls.’ Br. at 13, n.6 (citing Opening
Brief, R.129, at 12-14; Reply Brief, R.192, at 3). Indeed, as Plaintiffs themselves
acknowledge, this Court cited and relied upon the very same extrinsic evidence
that Plaintiffs now bring to this Court when it held their benefits vested in 2007.
See 2007 WL 2484989, at *9 (citing C.J. Devine’s letters and other similar
documents from “Case’s representatives”); id. at *4 (discussing Plaintiffs’
argument that the elimination of the FAS 160 Letter “by the UAW and Case during
their 1998 negotiations compels a finding that retiree health care benefits are
vested”).1

1

Plaintiffs do not even pretend any of this extrinsic evidence is new or that it provides any basis
for reconsideration. Indeed, in support of their argument regarding C.J. Devine’s antiquated
letters, Plaintiffs cite this Court’s own orders interpreting those letters and other allegedly
“similar expressions” from company representatives “spanning more than a quarter of a
century.” Pls.’ Br. at 10 (citing this Court’s 2007 decision, R.214, at 21-22; Yolton, 318 F. Supp.
2d at 469-70). And in discussing the “elimination of the FAS 106 medical cap letter during the
1998 [CBA] negotiations,” Plaintiffs expressly acknowledge that they have argued “throughout
the litigation” that this extrinsic evidence was dispositive of this case, see Pls.’ Br. at 13, n.6
(citing R.129, at 12-14; R.192, at 3), and that the Court relied on this evidence in its first decision
in 2007, Pls.’ Br. at 16-17 (citing R.214 at 19).

Pg ID 16989

In Yolton, just as in its 2007 decision in this case, the Court cited and
analyzed the very extrinsic evidence relied on by the Plaintiffs in support of their
motion. The Court, for example, provided a detailed description of the 1971 letter
from C.J. Devine attached as Exhibit A, Yolton, 318 F. Supp. 2d at 469-70, and
discussed a similar FAS 106 letter in equal detail, id. at 462-63. As noted above,
in the decision challenged here, the Court acknowledged and cited its decisions in
Yolton and Reese, but concluded that those earlier decisions did not survive
Tackett.
As this Court has explained, “[t]he local rules encourage finality in
opinions.” Oswald v. BAE Indus., No. 10-cv-12660-DT, 2010 WL 5464271, at *1
(E.D. Mich. Dec. 30, 2010). The rules preclude “attempts to rehash old arguments,
relitigate old issues with a ‘new’ legal theory, or reargue old assertions with ‘new’
facts.” Id. at *2. See also Smith v. Mount Pleasant Pub. Sch., 298 F. Supp. 2d
636, 637 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (similar). Plaintiffs are doing nothing more that
rehashing their old arguments. This Court’s rules demand more.
II.

THE EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE CITED BY PLAINTIFFS IS NOW
IRRELEVANT.
Even if this Court were to consider Plaintiffs’ evidence and arguments again

(which it should not), the result would be the same. The Court correctly found it
unnecessary to reach any extrinsic evidence in granting Defendants’ motion for
summary judgment.

Instead, the Court correctly read Tackett as requiring
5

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 449 Filed 10/21/15 Pg 7 of 12

Pg ID 16990

Plaintiffs, “at a minimum” to point to “a clear manifestation of intent, evinced in
the language of the contract” itself to establish lifetime, unalterable vested health
benefits.

2015 WL 5679827, at *10 (citing 135 S. Ct. at 936-37 (emphasis

added)). As the Court wrote, “Tackett changed the rules governing the analysis of
whether parties intended to create lifetime retiree benefits” in a number of different
ways. Id. at *7. For example:
• Courts may no longer infer that the parties intended to confer
lifetime benefits based on the context of labor-management
negotiations.
• Courts may no longer infer that the parties intended to confer
lifetime benefits based on the nature of retiree benefits.
• Courts may no longer categorically refuse to apply general
durational clauses to retiree benefits.
• Courts should give effect to the traditional contract principle that
contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon
termination of the bargaining agreement.
• Courts should give effect to the traditional contract principle that
ambiguous writings should not be construed to create lifetime
benefits.
Id. Plaintiffs’ disagreement with these conclusions, no matter how vehement, is an
insufficient basis for reconsideration.

That issue has already been briefed at

considerable length and should not be briefed and argued again here. See E.D.
Mich. L.R. 7.1(h)(3).
As this Court correctly ruled, the CBA here lacks any clear “manifestation of
intent” to vest and, in fact, contains language defeating vesting—a duration clause
6

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 449 Filed 10/21/15 Pg 8 of 12

Pg ID 16991

with no offsetting indication that benefits continued beyond the agreement. The
Court thus correctly “conclude[d] that its prior determination that the parties
intended to confer lifetime healthcare benefits [wa]s no longer viable.” 2015 WL
5679827, at *10. In addition to its instruction for courts to consider “the traditional
principle that ‘contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon
termination of the bargaining agreement,’” the Supreme Court instructed that
courts should not infer lifetime benefits from either contractual silence or
ambiguity. Tackett, 135 S.Ct. at 936-37. The extrinsic evidence is thus irrelevant.
The two letters attached to the Plaintiffs’ motion, dated 1971 and 1990,
predate the class period by 23 and four years respectively. Those letters conflict
with the integration clause. See R.439, Ex. B, 1998 Cent. Agmt. Art. 14 § 9
(“This Agreement disposes of any and all bargaining issues, whether or not
presented during negotiations, except with respect to the processing of grievances
as provided in Article VII”). See Witmer v. Acument Global Techs., Inc., 694 F.3d
774, 778 (6th Cir. 2012) (“extra-contractual intimations of meaning cannot alter
the straightforward meaning of the language found within the four corners” of the
contract). Even if considered anew, they fail to overcome the clear meaning of the
contract, much less the integration clause.
Nor does the existence, or even the elimination, of the so-called FAS 106
letter establish vesting. Fundamentally, the elimination of the letter does not

7

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 449 Filed 10/21/15 Pg 9 of 12

Pg ID 16992

overcome the explicit durational clause which, following Tackett, must be given
effect. 135 S.Ct. at 936. Further, even if not inconsistent with the durational
clause, Plaintiffs’ contention—that elimination of a future cap on benefits must
mean that the parties intended (1) benefits to continue forever, and (2) benefits to
be unlimited—is illogical. Elimination of the letter leaves nothing, and certainly
no lifetime agreement. Moreover, the letter was scheduled to “kick in” at the
outset of the 1998 CBA; the 1998 CBA “continued” the benefits (for the duration
of the CBA) but also adopted the “Cost of Healthcare Coverage” letter, which
guaranteed no additional contributions only during the term of the 1998 CBA. See
Reese I, 574 F.3d at 325. Finally, even if some coverage were anticipated beyond
the expiration of the 1998 CBA, the terms of the FAS 106 letter hardly obligates
CNH to continue that coverage for a lifetime. Witmer, 694 F.3d at 777 (“Surely a
company can promise ‘continuous health insurance’ and reserve the right to
modify or end that coverage if it becomes unaffordable.”) Thus, even if it were
considered once again (which it should not be), none of the extrinsic evidence
would change the result.
III.

PLAINTIFFS’ ATTEMPT TO RESURRECT “TYING” OF HEALTH
BENEFITS TO PENSION BENEFITS AS A BASIS FOR VESTING
FAILS.
Plaintiffs devote the final quarter of their brief (pages 19-24) to rearguing

the notion that the tying of eligibility for health benefits to the eligibility for a

8

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 449 Filed 10/21/15 Pg 10 of 12

Pg ID 16993

pension establishes vesting. Without question, this Court carefully considered, and
rejected, that argument based upon the Supreme Court’s decision in Tackett. See
2015 WL 5679827, at *9. To begin, Tackett addressed this tying analysis twice,
and rejected it both times. See 135 S.Ct. at 935 (citing Noe v. PolyOne Corp., 520
F.3d 548, 558 (6th Cir. 2008) for proposition that “a provision that ‘ties eligibility
for retirement-health benefits to eligibility for a pension . . . [leaves] little room for
debate that retirees’ health benefits ves[t] upon retirement,” but rejecting that
precept); id. at 937 (rejecting lower court’s conclusion that “tying of eligibility for
health care benefits to receipt of pension benefits suggested an intent to vest health
benefits”).
After careful review of Tackett, this Court concluded that “language tying
mere eligibility for contribution[s]-free benefits to receipt of benefits, as opposed
to language tying the duration of contribution-free benefits to receipt of pension
benefits, no longer supports the conclusion that [the] parties intended to create
lifetime benefits.” 2015 WL 5679827, at *9 (emphasis added). Applying this
reasoning to the contract language here, the Court noted that “[t]he pertinent
contract language here ties eligibility for contribution-free healthcare benefits to
the receipt of pension benefits,” and held “the tying language used here no longer
supports the Court’s determination that the parties intended to confer lifetime

9

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 449 Filed 10/21/15 Pg 11 of 12

benefits.”

Id. (emphasis added).

Pg ID 16994

Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary were

previously considered and are still unpersuasive.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration should be
denied forthwith.
