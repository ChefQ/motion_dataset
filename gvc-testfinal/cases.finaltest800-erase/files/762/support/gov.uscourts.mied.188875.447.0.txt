PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 2 of 37

Pg ID 16939

Plaintiffs, by their attorneys McKnight, McClow, Canzano, Smith & Radtke,
P.C., pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3), move for reconsideration of the District
Court’s September 28, 2015 order granting Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment. In support of this motion, Plaintiffs state:
1.

On August 29, 2007, this District Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for

Summary Judgment, based on its conclusion that the “plain language of the relevant
agreements, as further supported by the extrinsic evidence, demonstrates Case’s and
the UAW’s intent to grant lifetime retiree health insurance coverage to retirees and
surviving spouses of retirees who are eligible for or are receiving a pension.” (R.214
at 22-23).
2.

In its recent decision, the District Court nevertheless entered summary

judgment against Plaintiffs, relying on the intervening Supreme Court decision of
M&G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135 S. Ct. 926 (2015).
3.

In Tackett, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the responsibility of courts

is to “ascertain the intention of the parties” through the application of ordinary
contract principles, 135 S. Ct. at 935 (emphasis in opinion).
4.

Tackett held that the extra-contractual inferences enunciated in UAW v.

Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F.2d 1476 (6th Cir. 1983), because the use of an inference

2

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 3 of 37

Pg ID 16940

favoring vesting of retiree benefits "distorts the attempt ‘to ascertain the intention of
the parties." Id. at 935.
5.

Tackett did not foreclose the production of evidence that supports the

conclusions of the evidence. But, Tackett held that such a conclusion must be drawn
from facts, "shorn of presumptions."
6.

In reaching its recent decision, the District Court ignored substantial,

undisputed record evidence that Case intended for retiree benefits to vest for life. This
brief focuses on evidence relating to two critical, probative facts bearing on the intent
of the parties.
7.

First, in 1971, shortly after the conclusion of the 1971 contract

negotiations, Case’s benefit director explained what Case’s intent was when it agreed
to the CBA language conferring health care benefits on retirees. In a letter to hourly
retirees, Case’s benefit director informed them that Case had agreed to provide fully
paid health benefits for them and for the “remainder of [a surviving spouse’s]
lifetime” after the retiree passed away.
8.

Second, in 1998, Case agreed to the elimination of the existing medical

cost cap letter. By so agreeing, Case knew that its obligation to provide retiree health
care benefits extended, not only beyond the expiration of the 1998 CBA, but that its
obligation was no longer limited by a future dollar cap thereafter.
3

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 4 of 37

9.

Pg ID 16941

Tackett did not foreclose an inquiry into Case’s actual intent when it

agreed in 1971 to contract language tying pension benefits to receipt of a pension.
As shown by the concurrence, Tackett simply held that such language was not
determinative of the parties’ intent. As noted, Mr. Devine provided an authoritative
description of what Case understood the contract language to mean.
10.

Tackett, in summarizing the traditional rules of contract interpretation,

relied on Williston on Contracts, including a citation to a section in which Williston
states that “unambiguous contract language . . . need not be interpreted in a vacuum;
the underlying goal in interpreting a contract is to ascertain the intent of the parties,
and the surrounding circumstances when the parties entered the contract, among other
relevant considerations, may well shed light on that intent.” II Williston on Contracts
§30:6 (4th ed.).
11.

Here, the District Court committed manifest error by failing to consider

the significance of the undisputed facts relating to “the surrounding circumstances
when the parties entered the contract” in 1971 and in 1998.
12.

Even if the plain language of the CBA did not unambiguously provide

for vested benefits, it is ambiguous because “a reasonable person would find it
susceptible to different or inconsistent interpretations.” Cogent Solutions Group, LLC
v. Hyalogic, LLC, 712 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir. 2013). In fact, as noted, the District
4

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 5 of 37

Pg ID 16942

Court held in 2007 that the CBA language supported Plaintiffs’ interpretation and,
even in his recent decision, recognizes that Plaintiffs’ position is plausible.
Moreover, as the District Court and the Sixth Circuit have already held, substantial
extrinsic evidence shows that Case understood, and voiced that understanding to
retirees, that its obligation to provide retiree benefits lasted for the lifetimes of the
retirees and surviving spouses.
13.

Given the undisputed facts, the District Court erred when it failed to

“draw all factual inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment . . . .”
Reese v. CNH America LLC, 574 F.3d 315, 321 (6th Cir. 2009). One such factual
inference is that, as the district court already held, the CBA language, including the
tie between retiree health benefits and a pension, can be construed as providing
benefits that survive the expiration of the CBA.
14.

Neither Tackett nor traditional contract principles required the district

court to turn a blind eye to the undisputed evidence of Case’s intent when it entered
into the 1971 and 1998 CBAs. To the contrary, Tackett instructed courts to “ascertain
the intention of the parties.”
15.

The District Court committed manifest error when it failed to consider

all of the probative evidence that sheds light on the parties’ intent.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Motions for reconsideration are governed by E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3), which

states in pertinent part:
Generally, and without restricting the court's discretion, the court will
not grant motions for rehearing or reconsideration that merely present
the same issues ruled upon by the court, either expressly or by
reasonable implication. The movant must not only demonstrate a
palpable defect by which the court and the parties and other persons
entitled to be heard on the motion have been misled but also show that
correcting the defect will result in a different disposition of the case.
“A ‘palpable defect’ is a defect which is obvious, clear, unmistakable, manifest,
or plain.” Ososki v. St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 162 F. Supp. 2d 714, 718 (E.D.
Mich. 2001).
The Court, in converting summary judgment for Plaintiffs into summary
judgment for Defendants, based on its reading of M&G Polymers v. Tackett, 135 S.
Ct. 926 (2015), has committed manifest error – by ignoring, rather than enforcing, the
clear intent of the parties to the collective bargaining agreements. In this motion,
Plaintiffs address two specific and determinative contract facts that illustrate and
underscore that error.
II.

INTRODUCTION
In its September 28 decision, the District Court reconsidered its earlier

decisions and reversed itself based on its view of the meaning of M&G Polymers
USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135 S. Ct. 926 (2015). In Tackett, the Supreme Court addressed

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 13 of 37

Pg ID 16950

and rejected the inferences set forth in UAW v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F.2d 1476 (6th
Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration of whether retiree
health care benefits vested in that case under traditional contractual principles –
without reliance on any extra-contractual inferences. Id. at 937.
Tackett instructed courts to apply “ordinary principles of contract law”
recognizing that when interpreting collective bargaining obligations, “as with any
other contract, the parties’ intentions control.” Id. at 930, 933. The district court
ignored this directive and failed to even consider the unmistakable manifestations of
Case’s intent, thus improperly granting summary judgment to Defendants.
Here, in its motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs expressly disclaimed any
reliance on the Yard-Man inference. (R.129 at 8, n.7). In its 2007 opinion for
summary judgment for Plaintiffs, the district court never mentioned the Yard-Man
inference, either in its recitation of “governing principles” or in its application of
those principles. (R.214 at 12-13; 13-22). Applying traditional contract principles,
the court concluded that the “plain language of the CBA” demonstrated Case’s intent
to vest health benefits for retirees. (Id. at 22). It noted that substantial extrinsic
evidence confirmed this conclusion. (Id.).
In light of this, the District Court’s recent entry of summary judgment against
Plaintiffs based on its reading of Tackett is manifestly wrong. CBA language that
“plainly” expresses the intent to vest benefits simply cannot be also read to foreclose
2

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 14 of 37

Pg ID 16951

consideration of extrinsic evidence that conclusively supports the initial
interpretation. The meaning of the operative contractual language, as consistently
espoused by Case Corporation itself for a quarter century, did not change based on
an intervening Supreme Court decision that addresses “inferences” that neither the
District Court nor Plaintiffs employed.
In this motion, Plaintiffs focus on two specific contractual facts. First,
immediately after the CBA language governing retiree health care benefits was
negotiated in 1971, Case’s director of benefits wrote to hourly retirees telling them
that Case had agreed, in those negotiations, to provide fully paid health benefits for
them and for the surviving spouse for “the remainder of her lifetime.”
Second, in 1998 negotiations, Case agreed to eliminate the existing cost cap on
its future, post-CBA obligation to provide retiree health care benefits, an agreement
that would be illusory if those benefits were not intended to survive the existing CBA.
As the Supreme Court emphasized in Tackett, the only legitimate purpose of
contract interpretation is to determine the intent of the parties. 135 S. Ct. at 935. The
District Court, by ignoring Case’s actual intent, committed manifest error requiring
reversal and reinstatement of judgment for Plaintiffs. The entire contract, read as a
whole, and in light of the surrounding circumstances at the time the parties entered
into the CBAs, “plainly” vests benefits, as the district court and the Sixth Circuit
previously held. At worst, the language is ambiguous and requires the consideration
3

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 15 of 37

Pg ID 16952

of extrinsic evidence, evidence that overwhelmingly confirms that Case intended to
vest retiree health care benefits.
III.

STATEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS
This litigation is closely related to Yolton v. El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co.,

CA 02-75164 (E.D. Mich.). Yolton involves a class of retirees who retired from Case
before an initial public offering (IPO) effective July 1, 1994. The IPO was part of a
Reorganization Agreement under which Case’s former parent Tenneco assumed
liability for pre-IPO retirees and Case retained liability for post-IPO retirees.
In Yolton v. El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co., 318 F. Supp.2d 455 (E.D. Mich.
2003), the district court entered a preliminary injunction in favor of pre-IPO retirees.
It concluded that the express language of the 1990 CBA showed that Case and the
UAW intended retiree health care benefits to vest. The court analyzed on CBA
language that provided, inter alia, that “Employees Retired on Company Pension and
Surviving Spouses Receiving Company Pension” would be eligible for company paid
health benefits. Id. at 466-67. The court also compared other CBA provisions that,
unlike the retiree health benefit provision, had specific durational limits, a contractual
indication that “retiree benefits, not so specifically limited, were intended to survive”
the expiration of the CBA. Id. Then, the court stated:
Even if the parties' intent were not clear based on the express
language of the various labor agreements, Plaintiffs present substantial
extrinsic evidence to demonstrate that the UAW and Case intended to
4

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 16 of 37

Pg ID 16953

provide retirees and surviving spouses fully funded, lifetime health
insurance benefits.
Id. at 468.
The Sixth Circuit affirmed, Yolton v. El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co., 435 F.3d
571 at 583 (6th Cir. 2006), approving the district court’s contractual analysis, and
stating:
[W]hile the plain language of the CBAs requires us to conclude that the
district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing the injunction, we
also note that like the Golden case, “[d]efendant’s conduct also indicates
that plaintiffs’[s] benefits were vested” 845 F. Supp. at 415. The district
court identified substantial evidence indicating an understanding that the
health insurance benefits were lifetime benefits.
As the District Court concluded in its 2007 decision granting summary
judgment to the Reese Plaintiffs, the operative language governing retiree health
benefits remained “substantially identical” from the time it was negotiated through
the 1998 CBA. (R.214 at 13). It concluded:
[T]he Court finds no genuine issue of material fact with respect to
whether Plaintiffs are entitled to vested lifetime health insurance
benefits. The Court concludes that the plain language of the relevant
agreements, as further supported by the extrinsic evidence, demonstrates
Case's and the UAW's intent to grant lifetime retiree health insurance
coverage to retirees and surviving spouses of retirees who are eligible
for or are receiving a pension. (Id. at 22).
Neither the language of the CBAs nor the “substance” of the extrinsic evidence
changed in the wake of Tackett. In this motion, Plaintiffs focus on two simple,
undisputed contractual facts that demonstrate Case’s intent with respect to the
5

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 17 of 37

Pg ID 16954

duration of its contractual promise to retirees and thereby also demonstrate the
District Court’s palpable error.
IV.

ARGUMENT
A.

THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CONTRACT INTERPRETATION IS TO
ASCERTAIN THE INTENT OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES

Since courts began enforcing private agreements, the “cardinal rule” of contract
interpretation has been that a court must first ascertain and then enforce the intention
of the contracting parties. In Bradley v. Washington, Alexandria & Georgetown
Steam Packet Co., 38 U.S. 89, 97 (1839), the Court stated:
It is a principle recognized and acted upon by all Courts of justice, as a
cardinal rule in the construction of all contracts, that the intention of the
parties is to be inquired into; and if not forbidden by law, is to be
effectuated.
Accord George v. Tate, 102 U.S. 564, 570 (1881) (“intent of the parties is the
contract, and whenever that is ascertained, however inartificially [sic] expressed, it
is the duty of courts to give it effect”); Wonderland Shopping Center Venture LP v.
CDC Mortgage Capitol, Inc., 274 F.3d 1085, 1092 (6th Cir. 2001)(“court's primary
responsibility” is to ascertain and enforce the parties’ intent)(applying Michigan law).
As the Court wrote in Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Co. v. Hill, 82 U.S. 94, 99100 (1872):
We should look carefully to the substance of the original agreement . .
. as contradistinguished from its mere form, in order that we may give
it a fair and just construction, and ascertain the substantial intent of the
6

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 18 of 37

Pg ID 16955

parties, which is the fundamental rule in the construction of all
agreements.
Another basic principle is that contracts must be interpreted and enforced
according to the parties’ intent when the contract was made, irrespective of
subsequent events. Davison v. Von Lingen, 113 U.S. 40, 50 (1885).
Judge, now Justice, Kennedy, concurring in Williams v. Fenix & Scission, Inc.,
608 F.2d 1205, 1210-11 (9th Cir. 1979), rejected the concept that judicial inquiry
into the intent of contracting parties could be short-circuited by a so-called “plain
meaning” approach:
This approach to contractual interpretation has been rejected by the
circuit and it is out of line with the better-reasoned contract law cases.
It results in the exclusion of evidence clearly probative of the parties'
understanding of their obligations. Examination of the circumstances
which give rise to the agreement, of the subsequent acts and
communications which bear on the parties' intent at the time of
contracting, are relevant to show the intended meaning of a provision in
a contract.
Accord II Williston on Contracts § 30:6 (4th ed.).
Recently, in Russell v. Citigroup, Inc., 748 F.3d 677 (6th Cir. 2014), the Sixth
Circuit restated this traditional principle of contract interpretation as follows: “A
court must interpret a provision in a contract not in isolation, but against the backdrop
of ‘the contract as a whole, . . . the situation of the parties and the conditions under
which the contract was written.’” (quoting Frear v. P.T.A. Industries, Inc., 103
S.W.3d 99, 106 (Ky. 2003).

These established concepts were not altered by Tackett. Indeed, the majority
opinion held that the primary purpose of contract interpretation is to “ascertain the
intention of the parties.” 135 S. Ct. at 935 (emphasis in opinion).

CASE CORPORATION UNDERSTOOD FROM THE BEGINNING THAT
RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS WERE VESTED, LIFETIME BENEFITS

There is an undisputed fact in this case that is unique and one that sets it apart
from all reported cases on collectively bargained retiree health care benefits. When
Case first agreed to provide fully paid health benefits to hourly retirees in the 1971
negotiations, it announced precisely what it had agreed to do for retirees.
Immediately following the 1971 negotiations, C.J. Divine, Case's Director of Benefits
and Practices, told retirees that, after they passed away, their surviving spouses were
entitled to medical insurance coverage "for the remainder of [their] lifetime."
Mr. Devine participated in the 1971 negotiations as one of three management
representatives on Case's Benefit Subcommittee. (Plaintiffs motion for summary
judgment, R.129, Ex. 44). After the conclusion of those negotiations, Mr. Devine
wrote a letter to “Retirees of J. I. Case Company Retired Under the Hourly Employee
Pension Plan” about the “details of the Group Medical Insurance you are eligible for
January 1, 1972, as a J. I. Case Retiree or Surviving Spouse of a Retiree.” (Plaintiffs’
motion for summary judgment, R.129, Ex. 19, Lojeski Dep. Ex. 8).1

Fuller details surrounding this correspondence are set forth in Plaintiffs’ 2007
motion for summary judgment. (R.129 at 15-17).

Mr. Devine wrote the letter in a question and answer format because, he wrote,
that would “be the most understandable and anticipating the questions most of you
have in mind.” He added: “Because this letter contains considerable important
information, please read it carefully and keep it for future reference.”2
Question 3, posed by Mr. Devine, was “Will a Premium be Required?” Case’s
"answer" was: “Retirees and Surviving Spouses, age 65 or older, are not required to
pay a premium, either for themselves or any dependent. Instead, the coverage shall
be fully paid by the Company.”
Question 9, posed by Mr. Devine was: “Will my spouse be able to keep this
coverage if I pass away?” Mr. Devine assured Case retirees: “If you have elected the
Spouse's Optional Form of Pension and your spouse will receive a pension as a result,
your spouse will be able to keep this coverage for the remainder of her lifetime.”
A contracting party’s understanding of its contractual obligations, revealed in
word or deed, is a significant, if not controlling, indicator of intent and the meaning
of the contractual words chosen. Old Colony Trust Co. v. City of Omaha, 230 U.S.
100, 118 (1913) (“the practical interpretation of a contract by the parties to it for any
considerable period of time before it comes to be the subject of controversy is deemed

Virginia Clark, the surviving spouse of retiree Merlin Clark, kept this letter for more
than thirty years before she produced it during the Yolton litigation. Copies of Mr.
Devine’s letter and the envelope it came in, addressed to her deceased husband, are
attached as Exhibit A.

of great, if not controlling, influence”); Brooklyn Life Ins. Co. v. Dutcher, 95 U.S. 269
(1877)(“There is no surer way to find out what parties meant, than to see what they
have done.”).
Although so powerful as to be a sufficient indication of Case’s intent, Mr.
Devine’s 1971 letter to retirees is simply the first of a multitude of similar expressions
by Case of its intent spanning more than a quarter of a century. See e.g., Reese, R.214
at 21-22 (citing exhibits); Yolton, 318 F. Supp.2d at 469-70; 435 F.3d at 583.
Nearly 20 years after he unambiguously expressed Case’s intent, Mr. Divine
participated in the 1990 negotiations as Case’s Benefit Manager. At the conclusion
of the 1990 negotiations, Mr. Divine wrote to the surviving spouse of a disabled
employee who had died at age 53, making her ineligible for a pension and therefore,
ineligible for continuing health care benefits. He told the surviving spouse that,
during the 1990 negotiations, the company had agreed to extend the same healthcare
coverage to her as “those provided to other surviving spouses of deceased retirees .
. . .” He added: “You will have these coverages for your lifetime.” (Plaintiffs’ Motion
for Summary Judgment, R.129, Ex. 61, also attached as Ex. B).
As the court stated in its 2007 decision granting Plaintiffs’ motion for summary
judgment in Reese, the operative language remained “substantially identical” through
the 1998 CBA. (R.214 at 13-14). The court also cited evidence that, for “almost a
decade” after 1993, “Case’s representatives understood that retirees and their
10

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 22 of 37

Pg ID 16959

surviving spouses were entitled to lifetime medical insurance benefits and they
conveyed this understanding to retirees and surviving spouses.” (R.214 at 21-22).3
Nothing in Tackett required the district court to turn a blind eye to what it
already knew to be undisputed, contemporaneous and consistent evidence of Case’s
actual intent. To the contrary, Tackett specifically instructs courts to apply “ordinary
principles of contract law.” 135 S. Ct. at 933, 935. Tackett relied heavily on Williston
on Contracts for its recitation of these principles, including a citation to II Williston
on Contracts §30:6, p. 108 (4th ed. 2012) addressing “clear and unambiguous”
contract language. 135 S. Ct. at 933. In that section, Williston elaborated on the
correct principle to be applied:
While unambiguous contract language is generally interpreted without
resort to extrinsic evidence, it need not be interpreted in a vacuum; the
underlying goal in interpreting a contract is to ascertain the intent of the
parties, and the surrounding circumstances when the parties entered the
contract, among other relevant considerations, may well shed light on
that intent.
II Williston on Contracts § 30:6 (4th ed.) (footnotes omitted).
The practical construction, or the parties’ conduct under the agreement, is
“highly significant” evidence of the parties’ intent. Alabama v. North Carolina, 560
U.S. 330, 346 (2010). What Case said the CBA language meant in 1971 when it first
agreed to that language, is part of the “surrounding circumstances that “sheds light”
3

Plaintiffs summarized that evidence in its initial Motion for Summary Judgment.
R.129, at 16-26.

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 23 of 37

on Case’s intent. It is “highly significant” of Case’s intent precisely because it
discloses exactly what Case understood its obligation to be at the time it negotiated
the operative CBA language. If the underlying goal is to ascertain Case’s intent, as
Tackett requires, the District Court erred in not considering that evidence.
Tackett also allowed that a “court may look to known customs or usages in a
particular industry to determine the meaning of a contract,” but the “parties must
prove those customs or usages using affirmative evidentiary support in a given case.”
135 S. Ct. 935. Indeed, Tackett left intact Carbon Fuel Co. v. United Mineworkers,
444 U.S. 212 (1979) where the Supreme Court directed that “special heed” should be
given to the context of collective bargaining when interpreting CBAs. Tackett merely
instructs that the “context” must be proved by record evidence, rather than through
generalized inferences found in Yard-Man.4
In this case, Plaintiffs proved, by overwhelming affirmative evidentiary
support, the actual “customs and usage” of the contracting parties – that Case
understood and consistently represented to retirees and surviving spouses that retiree

4

Tackett’s criticism of Yard-Man was that its use of an inference favoring vesting of
retiree benefits “distorts the attempt ‘to ascertain the intention of the parties.” Id. at
935. Tackett did not foreclose the consideration of probative evidence that supports
a conclusion that can be drawn from those facts, for example, that the parties
intended, by tying benefits to pensions, to provide benefits for the period that a retiree
receives a pension. Such a conclusion must be drawn from affirmative facts, “shorn
of presumptions.” Id. at 937.
12

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 24 of 37

Pg ID 16961

health benefits lasted for their “lifetime.”5 The meaning that a party attributes to an
obligation assumed under a CBA, especially when it does continuously after the
obligation is assumed, is more direct and probative of the contracting parties’ intent
than any evidence of the “custom or usage” in a particular industry.
The District Court’s failure to consider Mr. Devine’s 1971 letter, and the other
probative evidence it earlier cited as supporting the “plain meaning” of the CBA,
necessarily means that its September 28 decision is suffused with a “palpable defect.”
C.

IN 1998, CASE AGREED TO PROVIDE “UNCAPPED” BENEFITS BEYOND
THE EXPIRATION OF THE CBA

The second contract fact that demonstrates a “palpable defect” in the court’s
September 28 decision is the elimination of the FAS 106 medical cap letter during the
1998 negotiations.6 The elimination of the medical cap letter is compelling evidence
that Case understood and agreed that its obligation to provide fully paid retiree health
care benefits indefinitely beyond the expiration of the 1998 CBA.
The background facts were recited by the district court in its prior decisions in

5

It was a shared custom and usage. For example, after the 1990 negotiations, Mr.
Devine sent Plaintiff Jack Reese, a UAW International Representation, a copy of
his letter to Reba Williams, confirming that she, like other surviving spouses, was
now entitled to “lifetime” medical insurance coverage. (See Exhibit B).
In their initial Motion for Summary Judgment and throughout the litigation, the
Reese Plaintiffs have asserted that the elimination of the FAS Medical Cap Letter in
1998 conclusively proved that Case was obligated to provide uncapped, lifetime
benefits. (See e.g., R.129 at 12-14; Reply Brief, R.192 at 3).

Yolton and Reese. On about November 5, 1993, Case and the UAW agreed to extend
the 1990 CBA through February 5, 1995. (R.214 at 5). Section 9 of that Extension
Agreement, entitled “FAS 106 Out-Year Cost Limiters,” refers to a "Letter of
Agreement" as Attachment B. That Letter of Agreement states in full:
This will confirm our understanding that the average per capita annual
cost to the Company of providing medical and related benefits under the
Case Group Benefit Plan to retired employees and surviving spouses of
deceased employees shall not exceed $2,750 for Medicare eligible
individuals and $8,500 for those individuals who are not eligible for
Medicare. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covered person shall be
required to pay a portion of any excess amount prior to April 1, 1998.
(R.214 at 5-6).
Shortly after the 1993 negotiations, Tenneco (Case’s parent) spun off Case
through an initial public offering (IPO) that became effective July 1, 1994. Under the
Reorganization Agreement between Tenneco and Case, Tenneco assumed liability for
health benefits for pre-IPO Case retirees. Case was responsible for health benefits for
employees retiring after July 1, 1994. See generally, Yolton, 435 F.3d at 575-76.
In the 1995 negotiations, the UAW and Case agreed to retain the FAS 106
Letter but extended the stated effective date of the dollar caps from to January 1,
1999, again beyond the expiration date of the new 1995 CBA. (R.214 at 6).
On October 27, 1997, El Paso (the successor to Tenneco) informed pre-IPO
retirees that it intended to require contributions from them beginning April 1, 1998
pursuant to the “cost-sharing” provisions of the medical cap letter. Yolton v. El Paso

Tennessee Pipeline Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17619 (E.D. Mich., Mar. 7, 2008),
slip opinion at 8. In other words, El Paso announced its intention to enforce the
dollar caps set forth in the 1993 FAS Cap Letter on the date set forth in that Letter.
The UAW objected strenuously to El Paso’s assertion that the FAS 106 Letter
was a “cost sharing” agreement.7 In the negotiations that followed shortly after El
Paso’s announcement, Case’s initial proposals were that the medical cap letter be
maintained. For example, on March 2, 1998, Case proposed to the UAW that the
parties “maintain current letter.” (R.273-20 at 12).8 Case proposed to maintain the
existing medical cap letter in proposals through at least March 28, 1998. (See R.27322 at 2, 8; R.273-23 at 3).
Toward the end of negotiations, Case revised its position on the medical cap
letter. On April 22, 1998, Case proposed that the effective date of the cost “caps” be
suspended until July 1, 2004 -- more than six years in the future and after the
expiration of the 1998 CBA. (R.273-25 at pages 5, 17). Case reiterated this proposal
in its April 23, 1998 proposal to the UAW. (R.273-26, at 6, 17).

announcement in its order granting the Yolton Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary
Judgment. Yolton, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17619, slip opinion at 21-22.

This proposal and the ones cited in the following paragraphs, as well as the 1998
Tentative Agreement, are exhibits to the Declaration of Jack Reese, which in turn is
filed at R.273- 2. Mr. Reese describes the 1998 negotiations pertaining to the
elimination of the medical cap letter at paragraphs 38-41 and 46 of his Declaration.
15

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 27 of 37

Pg ID 16964

The UAW and Case reached a Tentative Agreement later on April 23, 1998.
(R.273-51). Under the heading “Post IPO Retiree Benefits/Payments,” that agreement
provides: “Medical cap letter between the parties is eliminated.” (Id. at 10). Later on
in the Tentative Agreement, in Attachment “E,” the Benefit Detail section, the parties
reiterated that agreement: “Post-IPO Retiree Medical Cap Letter - Delete.” (Id. at 25).
These circumstances surrounding the 1998 negotiations are clearly relevant and
probative, even assuming the language of the 1998 CBA were unambiguous. See II
Williston on Contracts §30:6 (4th ed.); Williams v. Fenix & Scission, Inc., 608 F.2d
1205, 1210-11 (9th Cir. 1979)(Kennedy, J, concurring). Case’s proposal to extend
the medical cap letter would have required Case to pay the full cost of retiree benefits
through a date beyond the term of the 1998 CBA. By definition, this is evidence that
Case’s obligation extended beyond the expiration of that agreement. The elimination
of the future medical cost cap is probative evidence of Case’s agreement to pay the
full cost of retiree benefits beyond the post-CBA effective date (July 1, 2004) of its
proposed cap. It is convincing, if not controlling, evidence that Case’s continuing
obligation for retiree benefits was unlimited both in duration and in cost.
In its 2007 Opinion, the district court recognized the significance of the FAS
106 medical cap letters. It stated that those letters “only set forth caps on Case’s
future cost for benefits” and that, “[p]ursuant to the express terms of the letters, those
cost-controlling caps were to take effect only after the expiration of the then current
16

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 28 of 37

Pg ID 16965

Central Agreement.” (R.214 at 19). The district court added that “[t]his supports
Plaintiffs’ claim that retiree health insurance benefits were intended to continue after
the termination date of the [CBA].” (Id.). It undoubtedly does. And, because it
supports that conclusion, judicial consideration of the significance of the medical cap
letters and their negotiated elimination in 1998 is critical to determining the meaning
of the 1998 CBA.
According to Tackett, the critical question is whether the parties intended
retiree “benefits [to] continue after the agreement’s expiration.” Tackett, 135 S. Ct.
at 937; Litton Financial Printing Div. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190, 203 (1991).
Negotiated cost caps that only become effective after the contract expires are
evidence that Case’s obligation to provide retiree benefits “continued after the [1998]
agreement’s expiration.” By agreeing to the elimination of those post-CBA cost caps
in 1998, Case understood that its continuing obligation to provide retiree benefits was
not limited by any future, post-CBA dollar caps.
In Cole v. ArvinMeritor, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61003 (E.D. Mich. 2006),
aff’d 549 F.3d 1064 (6th Cir. 2008), the court agreed with this analysis. The court
addressed medical cost cap letters that had formulas for determining future company
cost contributions for retiree health benefits. The court concluded that those letters
evidenced an intent to vest benefits because “cost controlling caps are future oriented
and govern retiree health care benefits for decades beyond the expiration of the
17

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 29 of 37

Pg ID 16966

agreements in which they appear.” Id. at 25.
The district court’s recent decision -- that Case had no obligation to retirees
after the 1998 CBA expired -- places Plaintiffs in a far worse position than if the
UAW had accepted Case’s last proposal to suspend the caps until July 1, 2004. If the
UAW had accepted that proposal, the worst case scenario is that retirees would be
entitled to fully paid benefits beyond the expiration of 1998 CBA and then, beginning
July 1, 2004, capped benefits thereafter. Because the UAW rejected Case’s proposal
to limit its post-CBA obligation and Case agreed to eliminate the medical cap letter
entirely, the parties intended Case’s post-contract obligation to pay the full cost of
retiree benefits indefinitely.
Tackett did not alter the significance of this contractual fact. Another “cardinal
principle of contract construction [is] that a document should be read to give effect
to all of its provisions and to render them consistent with each other.” Mastrobuono
v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 514 U.S. 52, 63 (1995).
The negotiated elimination of the medical cap letter, twice memorialized in the
Tentative Agreement, is an integral part of the 1998 CBA. It unambiguously
discloses the intent of Case and the UAW concerning the duration of Case’s
contractual obligation to retirees. When Case abandoned its proposal for post-CBA
cost cap and agreed to eliminate the medical cap letter, Case necessarily agreed to pay
the full cost of retiree benefits -- not simply to a specific date beyond the term of the
18

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 30 of 37

Pg ID 16967

1998 CBA, but indefinitely thereafter. Any other construction of the parties’
agreement would render the UAW’s demand for the elimination of the medical cap
letter – and Case’s agreement to that demand – meaningless.
In its recent decision, the district court did not refer to the circumstances
surrounding the elimination of the FAS 106 medical cap letters or consider the
significance of those undisputed facts. By failing to do so, the court could not
possibly discern the actual intent of the parties.
D.

CBA LANGUAGE TYING HEALTH BENEFITS TO LIFETIME PENSIONS
IS RELEVANT EVIDENCE OF A LIFETIME OBLIGATION

Given the undisputed facts discussed above, the Court’s September 28 decision
negates, rather than enforces, the intent of the parties. But, even if there were some
ambiguity in the meaning of the CBA language, Plaintiffs are at least entitled to
present their evidence at trial.
A contract is ambiguous, and extrinsic evidence admissible, if a reasonable
person would find the contract susceptible to different or inconsistent interpretations.
Cogent Solutions Group, LLC v. Hyalogic, LLC, 712 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir. 2013).
Here, we have the remarkable situation where the same court, in separate decisions,
holds that the same language conferring health care benefits on retirees has two
entirely contradictory meanings.
In Yolton, 318 F. Supp. 2d 455 at 468, the district court held that the “parties’

19

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 31 of 37

Pg ID 16968

intent” in the operative retiree language was “clear based on the express language of
the various labor agreements.” In affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that “the plain
language of the CBAs requires us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its
discretion by issuing the injunction . . . .” 435 F.2d at 583.
As the Sixth Circuit held in Yolton, neither it nor the district court relied on the
Yard-Man inference for their conclusion. Instead, those courts applied “basic rules
of contract interpretation.” Id. As the Sixth Circuit stated: “the [district] court’s
analysis does not in any way rely on an inference. Instead, the district court
interpreted the language of the agreement and found evidence that the defendants
intended to confer lifetime benefits upon the plaintiffs.” Id.
In Reese, in its order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, the
District Court did not mention the Yard-Man inference, either in its recitation of the
governing law (R.214 at 12-13) or in its application of the governing legal principles
to the facts. (Id. at 13-23). Instead, the district court relied on the “plain meaning of
the relevant agreements, further supported by extrinsic evidence,” as demonstrating
Case’s intent to grant lifetime health benefits to retirees and surviving spouses of
retirees eligible for or are receiving a pension. (Id. at 22-23).
The district court and the Sixth Circuit Yolton both relied on the “tie” of health
benefits to pension benefits in the CBAs as evidence that retiree health benefits were
intended to last as long as pension benefits, that is, for life. Yolton, 318 F. Supp.2d
20

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 32 of 37

Pg ID 16969

at 466; 435 F.3d at 580. Both courts relied on Golden v. Kelsey Hayes Co., 73 F.3d
648, at 656 (6th Cir. 1996), not Yard-Man, for that interpretive principle. See Yolton,
435 F.3d at 580. Although the District Court apparently believes that Tackett held
otherwise, Tackett did not reject the “tied to pension” interpretive concept.
The majority opinion in Tackett did not hold that pension tying can never be
evidence of an intent to vest benefits. That majority’s criticism of the Sixth Circuit’s
approach on this issue was limited to language in Noe v. PolyOne Corp., 520 F.3d
548 (6th Cir. 2008), where the Sixth Circuit stated that CBA language that “ties
eligibility for retirement-health benefits to eligibility for a pension . . . [leaves] little
room for debate that retirees’ health benefits ves[t] upon retirement.” Tackett, 135
S. Ct. at 935 (quoting Noe, 520 F.3d at 558).
Tackett’s criticism of Noe was its holding that pension-tying language is
dispositive of the parties’ intent. While not conclusive, such language is certainly
relevant and should be considered in connection with the entire record, which
includes Mr. Divine’s 1971 letter and the 1998 elimination of medical cost cap letter.
A court can only truly determine the “intent of the parties” by weighing all of the
probative evidence.
The continuing viability of the “tied to pension” concept is demonstrated by the
Tackett concurrence. The concurrence stated that, on remand, the lower court must
determine whether the parties intended the benefits to vest without employing any
21

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 33 of 37

Pg ID 16970

inferences favoring the retirees. But, the concurrence stated, “[b]ecause the retirees
have a vested, lifetime right to a monthly pension, . . . a provision stating that retirees
‘will receive’ health-care benefits if they are ‘receiving a monthly pension’ is relevant
to this examination.” 9
In the post-Tackett decision of UAW v. Kelsey-Hayes, Case No. 11-CV-14434,
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124411 (E.D. Mich., Sept. 17, 2015), Judge Steeh concluded
that language in a CBA similar to that in Golden v. Kelsey-Hayes conferred vested
benefits on retirees. Judge Steeh cited Tackett for the proposition that ordinary
principles of contract interpretation must be applied to the interpretation of CBAs,
without inferences favoring the retirees. (Slip opinion at 19). Although Judge Steeh
noted that promises to provide vested benefits must be clear, he also noted that
Tackett recognized that a “CBA’s general duration clause is not necessarily
inconsistent with the ‘express or implied’ terms that may promise ‘that certain
benefits continue after the agreement's expiration.’” Id., quoting Tackett, 135 S. Ct.
at 937. For this proposition, Tackett (and Judge Steeh) cited Litton Financial
Printing Div. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190, 203 (1991). As Judge Steeh noted, “[a]ll
9

If the majority in Tackett had decided that CBA language tying retiree health
benefits to pensions was insufficient to survive summary judgment, it would have
simply reversed and entered judgment for the employer. Instead, the majority
remanded for reconsideration in light of its opinion. In its recent decision, the district
court closed a door on the retirees that Tackett left open.

22

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 447 Filed 10/13/15 Pg 34 of 37

Pg ID 16971

collectively-bargained vested benefits are promised in limited-duration CBAs with
general duration clauses.” (Id. at 20-21).
Addressing the operative CBA language, Judge Steeh concluded that the retiree
health benefits had vested and granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. He based
this conclusion on CBA language providing that the health care coverages an
employee had “at the time of retirement shall be continued” Id. at 20, and that similar
promises of continued benefits were made to surviving spouses. Judge Steeh found
that these promises of “continuance” contrasted with other contract provisions in the
same CBA that, unlike the retiree health provisions, had specific durational limits.
According to Judge Steeh: “This shows that when the parties intended to make certain
benefits of a limited duration, they expressly provided as much in the contract.” Id.
In Yolton, the district court and the Sixth Circuit employed a similar contractual
analysis, noting that, in the CBAs at issue here, there is no limitation on the duration
of retiree health benefits, while there are durational limits on other benefits. 318 F.
Supp.2d at 466-67; 435 F.3d at 582-83.

Because the 1998 CBA contains

substantially identical provisions with specific durational limits, the same analysis
applies here. In its recent decision, the district court did not mention this salient
contractual fact, one that, as Judge Steeh concluded, supports a finding that retiree
health care benefits survive the expiration of the CBA.
As Judge Steeh concluded, Tackett, in rejecting the Yard-Man inference, did

not substitute a presumption in favor of employers. Collective bargaining agreements
must be construed according to traditional rules of contract interpretation. Here, given
the two contractual facts cited above, there is no question about what Case intended,
from 1971 through 1998 and beyond. By ignoring those two critical undisputed facts,
the District Court committed manifest error.
V.

CONCLUSION
The District Court relied on Tackett to overturn his prior judgment that the

plain language of the CBAs provided for vested benefits. But, Tackett does not
address the actual, undisputed facts pertaining to the history of health benefits for
hourly Case retirees, the language of the relevant CBAs, or the context of the relevant
UAW/Case negotiations.
From the very beginning, Case understood that the CBA provided for lifetime
health benefits. Contemporaneously with the agreement on the contract language,
Case’s Director of Benefits told retirees what the CBA language meant: “If you have
elected the Spouse's Optional Form of Pension and your spouse will receive a pension
as a result, your spouse will be able to keep this coverage for the remainder of her
lifetime.”
Here, when El Paso announced its decision to apply the cost caps, the UAW
insisted that Case agree to the elimination of the post-CBA cost caps. By so agreeing,
Case necessarily abandoned, as well, any argument that its continuing, post-CBA

obligation for retiree health care benefits was limited either in scope or duration in
the future.
The district court misapplied the principles set forth in Tackett. By entering
summary judgment in favor of Case, the District Court negated, rather than
ascertained, the intent of the contracting parties. Based on the undisputed facts, even
under the principles set forth in Tackett, Plaintiffs are still entitled to summary
judgment. At the very least, they are entitled to a trial.
