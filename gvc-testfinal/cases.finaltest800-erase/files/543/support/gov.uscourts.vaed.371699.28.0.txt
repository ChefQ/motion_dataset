Civil Action No. 1:17-cv-943

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE THE SEVEN ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS AND
THEIR CLAIMS, OR ALTERNATIVELY, TO SEVER THOSE CLAIMS
Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 20(a)(1) and 21, Defendants B. Perrotte, T.
Osborne, D. Hun Yim, P. Manneh, and A. Nichols1 move this Court to strike from Plaintiffs
Mynor Abdiel Tun-Cos and José Pajarito Saput’s amended complaint the newly added
Plaintiffs, who were not in the original complaint and who sue Defendants for a wholly separate
alleged incident.2 Alternatively, Defendants move this Court to sever the newly added Plaintiffs’
claims. This motion is based on the accompanying memorandum. A proposed order is attached.

Department of Justice representation has not been authorized for Defendants regarding the
newly pled allegations and claims. See 28 C.F.R. § 50.15. In order for the Department of Justice
to adjudicate a request for representation, the relevant agency must forward “all available factual
information,” along with Defendants’ requests and the agency’s recommendation, to the
Department. Id. § 50.15(a)(1). Thus, undersigned counsel represents the Defendants as to the
newly pled allegations and claims solely for the purposes of filing this motion.

1

Those Plaintiffs are Luis Velasquez Perdomo, Pedro Velasquez Perdomo, Germán Velasquez
Perdomo, Eder Aguilar Aritas, Eduardo Montano Fernández, Nelson Callejas Peña, and José
Carcámo.
