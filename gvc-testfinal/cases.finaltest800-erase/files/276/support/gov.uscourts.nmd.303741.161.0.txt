THOMAS R. RODELLA,

New Nee Nee Nee ee ee ee Nee"

Defendant.
MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE OF SENTENCING

Defendant Thomas Rodella, by and through his counsel of record, Robert J. Gorence and
Louren Oliveros of Gorence & Oliveros, P.C., hereby requests the Court to enter an Order
continuing the sentencing hearing currently set for January 21, 2015. As grounds therefore, Mr.
Rodella states as follows:

1. On January 15, 2015, Mr. Rodella filed a Second Motion for New Trial (Doc.
160).

2. Mr. Rodella respectfully requests that his Second Motion for New Trial be fully
briefed, that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing, and that the Court rule on the Motion prior to
sentencing.

3. It is presumed that the government opposes this Motion. However, the Court
should be aware that continuing the sentencing hearing pending resolution of Mr. Rodella's
Second Motion for New Trial will conserve government resources as Mr. Rodella would not
have to be transferred from a federal correctional institution if the Court were to conduct an

evidentiary hearing with regard to his Second Motion for New Trial.
FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, Defendant Thomas Rodella respectfully requests
that the Court enter an Order continuing the sentencing hearing currently set for January 21,
2015.
Respectfully submitted,
GORENCE & OLIVEROS, P.C.
