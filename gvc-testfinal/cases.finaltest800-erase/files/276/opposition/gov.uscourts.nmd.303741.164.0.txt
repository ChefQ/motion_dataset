CRIMINAL NO. 14-2783 JB

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE
OF SENTENCING (Doc. 161)
The United States objects 1 to Defendant’s motion to continue the sentencing hearing for
the following reasons:
1. Defendant seeks a continuance to permit the Court to conduct a hearing on his Second
Motion for New Trial (Doc. 160).
2. Defendant did not file his Second Motion for New Trial until January 15, 2015. His
second motion merely addresses one of the issues he already raised in Defendant’s Reply to
United States’ Response to Defendant’s Motion for New Trial (Doc. 136), which was filed on
November 6, 2014. That issue related to the United States’ cross examination of Defendant’s
son in reference VA medical records.
3. The United States will respond on this date to Defendant’s Second Motion for New
Trial. In its response, the United States will discuss the obvious – that the defendant’s motion is

whether the motion is opposed.

entirely meritless. Moreover, the United States will request that the Court deny Defendant’s
Second Motion for New Trial without a hearing.
4. Since December 15, 2014, Defendant has been aware that his sentencing was
scheduled for January 21, 2014. (Doc. 156). Yet, he filed his motion for continuance just a few
days prior to the hearing. Worse, Defendant bases his motion to continue on a second motion for
new trial, which simply restates an issue raised more than two months ago. While that issue was
not reached by the Court following the hearing on the first motion for new trial, Defendant
cannot justify the delinquent filing of his Second Motion for New Trial or his Motion to
Continue Sentencing.
The Motion to Continue Sentencing should be denied because (1) Defendant’s Second
Motion for New Trial is baseless, and (2) both filings are untimely.
