MEMORANDUM
Defendants have asked the Court for a 60-day extension to reply to Plaintiffs’
Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for a New Trial in their Motion (Dkt. No.
335) (“Opposition Memorandum”). Defendants, however, do not state valid reasons or
circumstances why they should have sixty days to reply to Plaintiffs’ Opposition Memorandum.
Under Local Rule DUCivR 7-1(b)(4)(B), a movant has fourteen days after service of a
memorandum opposing a motion to file a reply to the opposition memorandum. Plaintiffs filed
the Opposition Memorandum on February 17, 2011. Any reply was therefore due—taking into
consideration additional days for mailing—on March 7, 2011. Plaintiffs emailed the Opposition
Memorandum to Defendants on March 29, 2011. Assuming Defendants’ statement concerning
being unaware of Plaintiffs’ filing is accurate, any reply should be due, at the latest, by April 15,
2011. This date allows for fourteen days as per Local Rule DUCivR 7-1(b)(4)(B) plus three days
for mailing. Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to deny Defendants’ Motion and set an April 15,
2011 deadline for Defendants to reply to Plaintiffs’ Opposition Memorandum.
The Motion also asks for a 60-day extension to reply to Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum in
Support of Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs Pursuant to Rule 54(d)(2) (Dkt. No. 336) (“Reply
Memorandum”) and Declaration of Jeremy [sic] Kerr in Support of Motion for Attorney Fees
(Dkt. No. 337) which supports the Reply Memorandum. Under the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure as well as the Local Rules, Defendants do not have an automatic right to reply to these
documents. The Court, therefore, should deny Defendants’ Motion as applicable to these two
documents.

CONCLUSION
The Court should deny Defendants’ Motion as applicable to Plaintiffs’ Opposition
Motion and set a deadline of April 15, 2011 to reply to the Opposition Motion. Moreover, the
Court should deny Defendants’ Motion as applicable to the other documents referenced in the
Motion because Defendants do not have an automatic right to reply to these filings under the
Federal or Local Rules.
DATED this 11th day of April, 2011.
