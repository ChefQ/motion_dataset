Plaintiff,
v.
KENNETH MELSON, Acting Director,
BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO,
FIREARMS & EXPLOSIVES
Defendant.

Case No. 1:11-cv-01401(RMC)
ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and Local Rule 65.1, The National
Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. (“NSSF”), moves

for a Preliminary Injunction enjoining

Kenneth Melson, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms & Explosives (“ATF”) together with all other ATF officials, employees and persons
claiming authority to act on ATF’s behalf, from enforcing a requirement that all federally
licensed firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas
submit reports to ATF whenever they sell or otherwise dispose of, at one time or during any five
consecutive business days, two or more semi-automatic rifles capable of accepting a detachable
magazine, and with a caliber greater than .22 (hereafter “rifles”) to an unlicensed person. ATF’s
July 12, 2011 letter demand for reporting of multiple sales of rifles exceeds its statutory authority
under 18 U.S.C. §923(g)(5)(A) and violates 18 U.S.C. §923(g)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. §926(a).
NSSF makes this motion on behalf of its 759 federally licensed retail dealer members located in
Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.

Pursuant to Local Rule 65.1(d), NSSF requests an expedited hearing on its motion for a
preliminary injunction. ATF’s demand that all federally licensed firearms dealers and
pawnbrokers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas report information regarding
multiple sales of certain rifles took effect on August 14, 2011. Each of these firearms dealers
have suffered immediate and irreparable harm as the result of ATF’s actions, in the form of nonrecoverable economic losses, including devotion of time and resources to employee training, new
record keeping systems and protocols and multiple sales report preparation. In support of its
motion for a preliminary injunction and its request for an expedited hearing, NSSF submits its
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction.1
Dated: August 22, 2011

Counsel for NSSF state that, pursuant to Local Rule 7(m), they have conferred in good
faith with counsel for ATF, by telephone, in an effort to resolve this dispute prior to seeking the
Court’s intervention. Counsel’s effort has been to no avail. The motion for preliminary
injunction is opposed by ATF.
