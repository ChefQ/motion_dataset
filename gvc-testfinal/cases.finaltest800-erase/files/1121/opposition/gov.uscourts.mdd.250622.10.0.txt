GOVERNMENT’S OPPOSTION TO MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
The United States of America, by its counsel, files this opposition to Claimant
Adolfo-Gitchens Aduso Lucas’s motion for summary judgment on the issue of the legality of the
seizure of certain evidence that the Government intends to introduce in this proceeding. In
support of its opposition, the Government says the following.
Procedural History
This is a civil forfeiture action against $106,647 in U.S. Currency that was seized during
the execution of a search warrant at 5507 Pioneer Drive, Baltimore, MD, on February 1, 2013.
The Government commenced this action by filing a Verified Complaint for Forfeiture on August
20, 2013, alleging that the defendant currency was derived from or was intended to be used to
commit a drug offense, and that it was subject to forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6).
(ECF 1). More specifically, the complaint alleges that the Claimant was stopped by a police
officer on February 1, 2013 for a traffic violation and that 105 grams of crack cocaine, $4500 in
currency, and cutting agents, paraphernalia and packaging materials associated with drug

distribution were found in his possession. Id. The complaint also alleges that later the same day,
police officers obtained a search warrant and found $102,107 and a loaded handgun in Claimant’s
residence.
Claimant was charged with a criminal offense in Baltimore County, but the case was
dismissed when Judge Williams granted a motion to suppress the seized evidence.
On February 28, 2014, Claimant filed the instant motion for summary judgment in the
federal civil forfeiture case, asking the court to rule that under the doctrine of collateral estoppel
the evidence seized by the state officers must be suppressed in the federal civil case as well. For
the following reasons, the motion for summary judgment is the wrong vehicle to bring this matter
to the attention of the court, and it should be denied.
Discussion
The claimant in a civil forfeiture case has the right to move to suppress evidence on the
ground that it was seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The proper vehicle for
raising that issue is a motion to suppress filed pursuant to Rule G(8)(a) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture
Actions.
Here, instead of filing a motion to suppress, Claimant has filed a motion for summary
judgment. He argues that because the suppression issue was litigated in the state court in
Claimant’s criminal case, the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes this court from reviewing
the merits of the Fourth Amendment claim and bars the Government from opposing it. Thus, in
Claimant’s view, there is nothing left to litigate and the evidence must be suppressed. But
Claimant is mistaken.

In Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206 (1960), the Supreme Court said this about the
preclusive effect of a state court’s ruling on a search and seizure issue:
In determining whether there has been an unreasonable search and seizure by state officers,
a federal court must make an independent inquiry, whether or not there has been such an
inquiry by a state court, and irrespective of how any such inquiry may have turned out.
The test is one of federal law, neither enlarged by what one state court may have
countenanced, nor diminished by what another state court may have colorably suppressed.
364 U.S. at 223-24. Accordingly, it is clear that unless precluded by the doctrine of collateral
estoppel, a federal court is obligated to review the legality of a search and seizure de novo,
regardless of the ruling of a state court on the same issue.
To be sure, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does bar the relitigation of certain issues
where the doctrine applies, and it has been applied to prevent the claimant in a civil forfeiture case
from attempting to litigate a suppression motion that he lost in a related criminal case in state court.
But that is because the party against whom the doctrine is asserted may not relitigate an issue that
he has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate in another forum. See, e.g., United States v. Real
Property Located in El Dorado County, 59 F.3d 974, 979-80 (9th Cir. 1994); United States v. Real
Property Known and Numbered as 415 E. Mitchell Ave., 149 F.3d 472, 476 (6th Cir. 1998). But
the doctrine does not apply where the party against whom it is asserted was not a party in the
earlier proceeding, and thus did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.
The Fourth Circuit applied that rule in United States v. Safari, 849 F.2d 891 (4th Cir. 1988).
In that case, a defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that the district court erred in
failing to apply collateral estoppel to his motion to suppress because the legality of the instant
search and seizure had been fully litigated in state court. Following a Second Circuit decision on
the same point, the panel rejected the defendant’s argument and held that “collateral estoppel does

not apply here because the federal Government was not a party in the state court action.” 849
F.2d at 893, following United States v. Mejias, 522 F.2d 435 (2nd Cir. 1977). Cf. United States v.
Ricks, 882 F.2d 885, 889-90 (4th Cir. 1989) (holding that collateral estoppel did not bar the United
States from introducing evidence from a state case in which the defendant was acquitted because
“the doctrine of collateral estoppel in inapplicable . . . because the parties in the two cases are not
the same”) (emphasis added).
Here, the United States was not a party to the criminal prosecution of Claimant in
Baltimore County. Thus, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply. Rather, this court
has an obligation to make its own determination of the merits of Claimant’s Fourth Amendment
issue, which Claimant is free to raise pursuant to a motion to suppress filed in terms of Rule
G(8)(a).
Conclusion
For all of these reasons, Claimant’s motion for summary judgment should be denied
without prejudice to Claimant’s filing a motion to suppress in terms of Rule G(8)(a).
Respectfully Submitted,
Rod J. Rosenstein
United States Attorney
