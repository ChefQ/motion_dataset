/
PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM
OF LAW TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE THIRD-PARTY
COMPLAINT
COMES NOW Plaintiff, Jeff Tucker, by and through his undersigned counsel, and files
his Response in Opposition and Incorporated Memorandum of Law to Defendant’s Motion for
Leave to File Third-Party Complaint [Doc. 33] (hereinafter “Motion”), and in support thereof,
respectfully alleges the following:
I.

Introduction

Plaintiff filed his one count Complaint [Doc. 1] on May 19, 2017 alleging that Defendant,
Credit One Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) repeatedly called him in violation of the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. 227 et seq. (“TCPA”). Plaintiff alleged that Defendant
called him over and over looking for the wrong person, and that on many occasions Plaintiff
informed Defendant over and over again that he was not such individual and to please stop
calling. Defendant continued to call looking for the wrong person. Defendant has been aware of
the full phone number for the plaintiff since early in the litigation. When searching for that
number, Defendant immediately identified the name Jessica Patino. Defendant now, almost 1

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 148

year later, has filed its Motion for Leave to File Third-Party Complaint [Doc. 33] seeking to file
a claim against Plaintiff’s Daughter, Jessica Tucker a/k/a Jessica Patino (hereinafter “Patino”).
Defendant’s representation that Patino is, in essence, the real party at fault here is absurd.
Defendant chooses not to scrub or research the telephone numbers it is calling to identify who
the actual subscriber/user is of the phone number in question. In 2016 Defendant chose to extend
credit to Patino and Defendant has been in possession of Patino’s personal identifiable
information because it had extended credit to her. As will be shown below in this Response,
Defendant’s argument that it only recently discovered the identity of Patino is demonstrably
false. Defendant’s further attempt to shift the burden to Plaintiff, to do Defendant’s job, in
researching and finding the same person to whom it extends credit is preposterous.
Defendant chose to bombard Plaintiff’s cell phone with four hundred and eighteen (418)
calls between January 10, 2017 and June 14, 2017 without his express consent. On some
occasions, Defendant would place eight (8) calls in one day to Plaintiff’s cell. Additionally from
the very first call, Defendant knew the number they were dialing did not belong to Patino.
Defendant has provided Plaintiff with seventy (70) recordings wherein their calls to Plaintiff’s
cellular telephone go to voicemail and Defendant was greeted, at least seventy (70) times, with a
voicemail greeting which identified the users of the phone as “Rebecca and Jeff.” Defendant and
its vendor elect to continue to call numbers with automated technology even after the voice mail
in such numbers clearly reflect a different individual.
Additionally, Defendant has not actually provided any documents establishing Patino had
an account with Defendant. No application has been provided, nor any signed documents, nor
any acknowledgment from Patino. The only document that has been provided to “prove” Patino
had an account with Defendant is a generic cardholder agreement.

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 149

As will be shown below, Defendant’s Motion for Leave is baseless, ignores key elements
of the case, is incredibly untimely, seeks an improper venue, will change the entire schedule of
the current litigation, is very prejudicial to the Plaintiff and is nothing more than a pressure/scare
tactic leveled against Plaintiff by Defendant, and should ultimately be denied.
II.

Legal Standard

Rule 16(b) requires a court to enter a scheduling order that “limit[s] the time to join other
parties, amend pleadings, complete discovery, and file motions[,]” which may be “modified only
for good cause and with the judge’s consent.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(A), 16(b)(4). “When a
motion to amend is filed after a court has issued its scheduling order, the party seeking to amend
must first demonstrate ‘good cause’ under Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
before the court will consider whether the amendment is proper under Rule 15(a)(2). Tischer v.
Bank of Am. N.A., No. 1:12-cv-4185-CAP, 2015 WL 11198945, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 10, 2015);
Datastrip Intern. Ltd. v. Intacta Tech., Inc. 253 F.Supp.2d 1308, 1317 (N.D. GA 2003) (“Court’s
evaluating motions to amend … must apply the good cause rubric of Rule 16 before considering
whether amendments are proper under Rule 15 …”) (citing Sosa v. Airprint Systems, Inc. 133
F.3d 1417, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998). The good-cause standard precludes modification of the court’s
scheduling order unless the “schedule cannot ‘be met despite the diligence of the party seeking
the extension.” Sosa, 133 F.3d at 1418 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 16, advisory committee notes). If
a party fails to meet the “good cause” standard, the Court generally must deny the motion
because to do otherwise “would render scheduling orders meaningless and effectively would
read Rule 16(b) and its good cause requirement out of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”
Sosa, 133 F.3d at 1419. This is especially true where a request for leave to amend the complaint,
filed at the end of the discovery period, would serve to “produce[ ] more attempts at discovery”

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 150

and “delay[ ] disposition of the case.” Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Universities of
Florida Dep’t of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Florida, 342 F.3d 1281, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003). Here,
Defendant agreed to, and the Court’s Scheduling Order [Doc. 18] confirms, October 31, 2017 as
the last day to file amended pleadings. Defendant filed the Motion at hand over six (6) months
past the cutoff.
Furthermore, in its Initial Disclosures Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1) filed August
23, 2017, Defendant stated that “Credit One is not claiming damages at this time, but reserves
the right to seek damages, costs and fees as allowed by state and/or federal statues” [Doc. 17].
Of relevance is that the Court’s Scheduling Order [Doc. 18] filed on August 31, 2017, made
explicitly clear that “the parties are under a continuing duty to supplement their disclosures and
responses as required by Rule 26(e) whenever necessary during the entire course of the litigation.
Supplementations shall be made within thirty days of first learning of the need to supplement,
but no later than thirty days prior to the end of discovery.” The current rescheduled discovery
deadline is May 30, 2018, and no supplementation has been made by Defendant of its
disclosures. Moreover, if the movant had earlier opportunities to amend or if the delay places an
unwarranted burden on the court, the court should not permit the amendment. See CMR D.N.
Corp. v. City of Phila., 703 F3d at 629-30 (3d Cir. 2013)
Courts regularly deny motions to amend as prejudicial where the opposing party has
spent significant resources litigating the matter. Catz v. United States, No. 2:10-cv-105-FtM36SPC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145097, at *9-10 (explaining that allowing an amendment would
be “highly prejudicial” because the defendant had “spent hours in discovery”). Additionally,
“when there seems to be no good reason why the plaintiff could not have brought the claim

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 151

earlier in the case, leave to amend may be denied for undue delay.” Raja v. Englewood Cmty.
Hosp., Inc., No. 8:12-cv-02083-JDW-AEP, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159627, at *4 (citing cases).
Because Defendant has had a long running relationship with Patino, Defendant was in
possession at all times of the information necessary to properly assert its claim. As Defendant
states in its Motion, on or about November 1, 2016, Patino applied for a card through Defendant
[Doc. 33 p. 3]. Furthermore, as elaborated later in this Response, on or about July 31, 2017,
during the initial case management conference, Defendant made Plaintiff’s counsel aware that
the calls he received were for intended for his 22 year old daughter (Patino.) Defendant knew
and determined Patino’s role in this matter with minimal diligence on its part. Defendant
possessed all the information necessary to fully assert a claim against Patino for over ten (10)
months prior to filing this Motion, but failed to do so. Against this background, the Motion
should be denied. See, e.g., Sosa v. Airprint Sys., 133 F.3d 1417, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998) (“In light
of [plaintiff’s] lack of diligence in protecting her rights, [plaintiff’s] attempt to add a defendant
outside the time frame prescribed by the scheduling order was not supported by good cause.”
Catz, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145097, at *8-10 (denying untimely motion to amend where
plaintiff had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and make any necessary amendments but
failed to do so); Gonzalez v. Pirelli Tire, LLC, No. 6:08-cv-315-Orl-19DAB, 2008 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 39491, at *9 (M.D. Fla., May 15, 2008) (denying untimely motion to amend filed two
months after deadline to amend expired because “[s]uch a belated filing suggest…a lack of
diligence on the part of Plaintiff.”
Moreover, as explained below, Defendant unduly delayed in filing the Motion. Courts
have held both Defendants and Plaintiffs to high standards when attempting to amend or add
counter claims late in the litigation. “[T]he mere passage of time is not enough to deny a motion

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 152

to amend,’ but when ‘there seems to be no good reason’ why the plaintiff could not have brought
the claim earlier in the case, leave to amend may be denied for undue delay.” Raja, 2013 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 159627, at *4 (citing case). There seems to be no good reason why Defendant could
not have filed this Motion earlier in this case.
While leave to amend is freely given under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), a
motion to amend filed after the deadline established by the Case Management and Scheduling
Order will only be granted upon a showing of good cause under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
16(b)(4). Sosa v. Airport Sys., Inc., 133 F.3d 1417, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998). Defendant failed to
ever state their good cause in its motion, instead merely giving a vague statement.
III.

Defendant Misrepresents How Long It Was Aware of Patino

Defendant in its Motion attempts to mislead the Court into believing it only recently
became aware of, and had information concerning Patino.

There is ample evidence that

Defendant has been aware of Patino for a lengthy period of time and only now, on the cusp of a
once already rescheduled discovery deadline, seeks to add Patino as a third-party Defendant. In
particular Defendant has stated in its Motion that “On July 18, 2017, Credit One filed its answer
and affirmative defenses. Through its investigation and discovery, Credit One has learned the
calls at issue were intended for plaintiff’s daughter, Jessica Tucker a/k/a Jessica Patino
(“Patino”), who had an account with Credit One. Patino gave Credit One the -5400 number on
November 14, 2016, as her secondary contact number” [Motion p. 1-2]. Defendant goes on to
state “Credit One did not have the information necessary to file a third-party complaint until it
had conducted its own internal investigation and until it deposed Tucker and his wife on April
26, 2018, during which several issues were clarified regarding the – 5400 number” [Motion p. 7].

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 153

To the contrary, Defendant has been aware of Patino since the earliest stages of the
lawsuit. While initially Plaintiff believed he was getting calls for a “Sherry” as it was alleged in
the Complaint [Doc. 1], during the initial case management conference that occurred in this case
on or about July 31, 2017, Defendant informed Plaintiff that it was actually placing calls for
Patino, Plaintiff’s daughter. Upon discovering that the calls were actually intended for Patino,
and not a “Sherry,” Plaintiff included Patino as a potential witness in his Initial 26(a)(1)
Disclosures [Doc. 16] filed on August 14, 2017. Defendant also listed Patino as a potential
witness in its Initial 26(a)(1) Disclosures [Doc. 17] filed on August 23, 2017. Additionally on
November 3rd, 2017, Plaintiff responded to Defendant’s Interrogatories [Attached hereto as
Exhibit “A”], one question of which (#10) asked Plaintiff to identify Patino, which he did
including providing her address at the time of the request. Defendant failed to request any
amendments and instead allowed full discovery to occur between the parties without adding
Patino.
As is shown, for at almost ten (10) months Defendant knew the person they were trying
to reach was Patino. Additionally, for least the last five (5) months, Defendant knew Patino was
Plaintiff’s daughter and had her address. Defendant’s façade that it only recently found out about
Patino and didn’t have any information on her is clearly preposterous. Defendant has been in
possession of the identity and information of Patino since granting her credit. Defendant was
able to identify the account involved during the collection calls, the name Jessica Patino and all
the demographic information provided during the application for credit. Defendant’s lack of
planning should not constitute an emergency or prejudice to this Court or the Plaintiff.
IV.

Adding Patino Would Open Up All New Discovery and Facts

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 154

Defendant attempts to lead the Court to believe that adding Patino as a third-party
Defendant would stream line the case and make the resolution of such more expedient, however
it is actually quite the opposite. Adding Patino as a third-party Defendant would also open the
ability for Patino to file a counter-claim against Defendant for calls they may have placed to her
in violation of the TCPA. Patino provided her own cell phone number to Defendant during the
application process and received a lot of calls from Defendant. This would then spur additional
discovery as records would need to be gathered. The facts surrounding Defendant’s calls and
conversations to Patino would be totally separate from those regarding Plaintiff and his calls and
conversations with Defendant. Furthermore, Plaintiff’s attorney does not represent Patino which
would likely spur her to acquire her own counsel for representation in the case. Defendant has
had at a minimum, ten (10) months to add Patino to the litigation and has failed to do so until
now, on the cusp of the discovery deadline. Furthermore, per the Scheduling Order [Doc. 18], the
deadline to amend or add third parties was October 31, 2017.
Adding Patino as a party would greatly prejudice Plaintiff as through this Motion, filed at
the last minute, Defendant seeks to dramatically and improperly expand the scope of this action.
Plaintiff has deposed the corporate representative for Defendant and has also deposed
EGS/Alorica (a vendor used by Defendant). Should Patino be added as a party, Plaintiff will
need to again conduct further depositions regarding the account belonging to Patino. Defendant
tries to pass off adding Patino to the party as being a quick event that will require no real
discovery. Patino will need to subpoena her own cell phone records to disprove that she allegedly
(after the application) provided Plaintiff’s cell number. The Defendant, in the Proposed Agreed
Order [Doc. 25] agreed to move the deadlines for discovery, expert reports and dispositive
motions, but failed to address or move the deadline for amending pleadings. The original

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 155

Scheduling Order [Doc. 18] was modified via the Agreed Order [Doc. 25] on March 6, 2018
which moved the Discovery Deadline from March 30, 2018 to May 30, 2018 and the dispositive
deadline from April 30, 2018 to June 30, 2018. Plaintiff has almost completed the writing for his
Motion for Summary Judgment which was planned to be filed prior to the June 30, 2018
deadline. The addition of a new party will greatly expand and necessitate further extensions of
this case which is on the cusp of its conclusion. Adding Patino as a party will necessitate that she
be afforded the time to retain counsel, file an Answer, conduct her discovery as well as her own
depositions of Defendant and its vendor(s).
Lastly, Patino is likely to have several affirmative defenses (unrelated to Plaintiff’s case)
of unconscionability and public policy violations emitting from the contractual language from
the Defendant’s Credit card agreement.
V.

Arbitration Clause Governs any Dispute between Credit One and Jessica
Patino

A significant fact which Defendant has apparently chosen to ignore in its Motion is that
in the contract entered into between Defendant and Patino and attached as an Exhibit [33-1] to
Defendant’s Motion, is that an Arbitration Agreement is present which states, in part:
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT OF YOUR CARD
AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT EITHER YOU OR WE
CAN REQUIRE THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE BE
RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES
THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY.
[Doc. 33-1 p. 6] (emphasis added)
You and we agree that either you or we may, without the other’s consent, require
that any controversy or dispute between you and us (all of which are called
“Claims”), be submitted to mandatory, binding arbitration.
…

Case 4:17-cv-00066-JHM-HBB Document 36 Filed 05/18/18 Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 156

Claims subject to arbitration include Claims based on any allegations of fact,
including an alleged act, inaction, omission, suppression, representation,
statement, obligation, duty, right, condition, status or relationship.
[Doc 33-1 p.7]
This case has thus far been prosecuted in a timely fashion over the last year. Discovery
on both sides has been exchanged and answered. Depositions of both Plaintiff and Defendant
have occurred. Adding a new party at this point to the matter at hand will only delay and throw a
wrench amidst the gears that have been, up until this point, speedily pushing this case toward
trial. Should Defendant wish to pursue their potential case as to Patino’s alleged liability for the
calls in question, the most proper, expeditious and economical venue for them to do so would be
through Arbitration.
VI.

Conclusion

For these reasons Defendant’s Motion for Leave to File Third-Party Complaint should be
denied.
