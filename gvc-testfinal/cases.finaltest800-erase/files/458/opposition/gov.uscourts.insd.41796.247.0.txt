DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST
DEFENDANT FOR THE INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF MATERIAL EVIDENCE
[CM/ECF 237]
______________________________________________________________________________
Defendant Michael Harrison (“Harrison”), by counsel, respectfully submits his Response
to Plaintiff Malibu Media, LLC’s (“Malibu”) Motion for Sanctions Against Defendant for the
Intentional Destruction of Material Evidence. CM/ECF 237.
I.

INTRODUCTION
On October 5, 2014, Harrison filed a Motion Requesting an Evidentiary Hearing on

Malibu’s Motion for Sanctions Against Defendant for the Intentional Destruction of Material
Evidence (“Motion for Sanctions”). CM/ECF 245. Harrison’s response establishes the correct
legal standard applicable to spoliation / destruction of evidence motions, and addresses other
matters relevant to Malibu’s Motion for Sanctions.
II.

BINDING SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA AND 7TH CIRCUIT PRECEDENT REQUIRES A
SHOWING OF INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE IN BAD FAITH.
On a spoliation / destruction of evidence motion, the moving party must show that the

other party intentionally destroyed evidence in bad faith. Rummery v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co., 250 F.3d

553, 558 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing Mathis v. John Morden Buick, Inc., 136 F.3d 1153, 1155 (7th
Cir. 1998)); Bracey v. Grondin, 712 F.3d 1012, 1018-1020 (7th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S.
Ct. 900 (2014); 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instr. § 1.20 (2005 rev.). The movant must meet its burden
of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Miksis v. Howard, 106 F.3d 754, 762-63 (7th Cir.
1997); 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instr. § 1.20 (2005 rev.). Unless the movant carries its burden of
proof, the trier of fact cannot infer the destroyed evidence would have been unfavorable to the
other party. Miskis, 106 F.3d at 762-63; 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instr. § 1.20 (2005 rev.). The mere
fact that evidence is or remains unavailable to the moving party does not shift the movant’s
burden of proof; there is no burden shifting. Bracey, 712 F.3d at 1019 (citing Rummery, 250 F.3d
at 558).
“Certain things are not to be considered as evidence.” 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instr. § 1.06
(2005 rev.). “[A]rguments, statements, and remarks of counsel [are] not evidence.” Mayall v.
Peabody Coal Company, 7 F.3d 570, 573 (7th Cir. 1993); Probus v. K-Mart, Inc., 794 F.2d 1207,
1211 (7th Cir. 1986); Ramsey v. American Air Filter Co., Inc., 772 F.2d 1303, 1311 (7th Cir.
1985); Lenard v. Argento, 699 F.2d 874 (7th Cir. ).
A party’s “destruction … of a document, standing alone, does not warrant an adverse
inference instruction. Norman-Nunnery, 625 F.3d at 428 (quoting Park v. City of Chicago, 297
F.3d 606, 615 (7th Cir. 2002)). “[T]he crucial element is not that the evidence was destroyed but
rather the reason for the destruction." Park v. City of Chicago, 297 F.3d 606, 615 (7th Cir.2002)
(quoting S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 695 F.2d 253, 258 (7th
Cir.1982)); Norman-Nunnery v. Madison Area Tech. Coll., 625 F.3d 422, 428 (7th Cir. 2010).
“A party destroys a document in bad faith when it does so ‘for the purpose of hiding adverse
information.’” Bracey, 712 F.3d at 1019; Faas v. Sears, Roebuck, & Co., 532 F.3d 633, 644 (7th

Cir. 2008); Trask-Morton v. Motel 6 Operating L.P., 534 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2008) (showing that
destruction of materials in bad faith “is a prerequisite to imposing sanctions for the destruction of
evidence”); Crabtree v. Nat’l Steel Corp., 261 F.3d 715, 721 (7th Cir. 2001) (destruction of
evidence sanctions not warranted where documents were destroyed during pendency of
plaintiff’s claim before Illinois Department of Human Rights); Welch v. Eli Lilly & Company,
No. 1:10-cv-01705-LJM-TAB, Dkt. 122 at 22-25 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 15, 2013) (request for
spoliation remedy rejected because motion for sanctions not an appropriate substitute for motions
to compel); Davis v. Carmel Clay Schools, No. 1:11-cv-00771-SEB-MJD, Dkt. 201 at 13-15
(S.D. Ind. Sept. 30, 2013) (no basis for drawing reasonable inference of bad faith where no
evidence that deletion and overwriting of video files on hard drive was undertaken in order to
destroy adverse evidence as opposed to mere negligent handling of the hard drive). Of course,
“[b]ad faith is a question of fact just like any other[.]” Mathis 163 F.3d at 1155.
III.

MALIBU MISSTATES THE LEGAL STANDARD IN THE 7TH CIRCUIT APPLICABLE TO THE
LAW ON SPOLIATION / DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE.
Despite being called out on its intellectual dishonesty some four (4) months ago, Malibu

continues to ignore binding Southern District of Indiana and 7th Circuit precedent applicable to
the law on spoliation / destruction of evidence. Malibu Media, LLC v. Kelley Tashiro and N.
Charles Tashiro, No. 1:13-cv-00205-WTL-MJD, Dkts. 130; 137 at 2 n. 2 (S.D. Ind. July 16,
2014) (“Perhaps realizing that binding Seventh Circuit precedent does not help its case, Malibu
appears to have chosen to rely almost solely upon Indiana state court cases, treatises, and
factually distinguishable district court cases.”).
Malibu’s Motion for Sanctions ignores Southern District of Indiana case law altogether,
and the legal standard Malibu portrays as governing 7th Circuit law is explicitly rejected in
Bracey as less stringent than required by the 7th Circuit. 712 F.3d at 1020 (“Some circuits have

	  

3	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 247 Filed 10/08/14 Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 1838

adopted less stringent standards than we require for issuing an adverse inference instruction.”)
(comparing 7th Circuit cases requiring intentional destruction in bad faith with 6th Circuit cases
requiring only negligent destruction and a duty to preserve, and with 9th Circuit cases not
requiring bad faith for adverse inference instructions) (“Simply establishing a duty to preserve
evidence or even the negligent destruction of evidence does not automatically entitle a litigant to
an adverse inference instruction in this circuit.”)); ECF 237 at 6 (“[T]he only determination the
Court needs to make is whether Defendant knew or “should have known that litigation was
imminent.”) (erroneously citing Trask-Morton, 534 F.3d at 681-82, in support of its assertion)).
Knowing that binding 7th Circuit precedent did not help its case, here, Malibu, incredibly,
made up its own 7th Circuit precedent and represented it to be the law of this District. But before
doing so, Malibu ironically accused Harrison of lying and showing blatant disregard for the
judicial process. ECF 237 at 1.
IV.

HARRISON PROPERLY OBJECTED TO MALIBU’S IMPROPER INSTRUCTIONS
ACCOMPANYING THE REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION; PROPERLY RESPONDED TO
MALIBU’S REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND INTERROGATORIES; AND, MALIBU
FAILED TO MOVE TO COMPEL THE EXTERNAL DEVICES MALIBU CLAIMS WERE NOT
DISCLOSED OR PRODUCED.
Malibu states that “[b]ecause Defendant disposed of the hard drive, Plaintiff has no way

to tell whether or not that drive contained evidence of Plaintiff’s copyrighted works.” ECF 237 at
7-8.

Malibu then immediately contradicts itself: “As such the destruction caused Plaintiff to

suffer a substantial disadvantage. Indeed, for good reason, Plaintiff strongly believes its works
were on the melted hard drive.” ECF 237 at 8. Malibu has a way to tell whether or not the drive
contained evidence of Plaintiff’s movies because Harrison testified about what was on the
gaming computer hard drive, identified numerous witnesses who have a personal knowledge
about what was on the hard drive and Harrison’s use of the hard drive, and because IPP

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 247 Filed 10/08/14 Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 1839

International U.G./Malibu’s purported evidence does not evidence any download of X-Art
movies occurred.
Further, none of Harrison’s discovery responses submitted with the Motion for Sanctions
evidence that Harrison intentionally destroyed the hard drive in bad faith. In fact, Harrison’s
immediate disclosure of the receipt for the replacement hard drive in July 2013; Harrison’s full
deposition testimony specific to the non-recoverable gaming computer hard drive; namely, (i)
that he used the gaming hard drive almost entirely for gaming purposes only, (ii) that the gaming
hard drive was aged and had crashed on multiple prior occasions; (iii) and, that he did not
commit the alleged infringements in this case – all of which Malibu omitted from the transcript
filing – are enough to show that Malibu cannot meet its burden of proof.
To the extent that Malibu is seeking sanctions in connection with any device or drive
aside from the disposed of non-recoverable gaming computer hard drive, Malibu cannot
substitute a spoliation / destruction of evidence motion for a timely filed motion to compel.
Rodgers v. Eli Lilly & Company, No. 1:11-cv-00306-JMS-DML, Dkt. 57 at 5 (S.D. Ind. July 17,
2012) (citing Walker v. County of Cook, No. 05 C 5634, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1636, at *17;
Lapinee Trade, Inc. v. Boon Rawd Brewery Co.,, No. 88 C 589, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13989, at
*4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 1993)).
V.

MALIBU’S MOTION INVENTS FACTS AND OPINIONS NOT CONTAINED OR EXPRESSED
IN ITS EXHIBITS.
After inventing its own 7th Circuit legal standard on spoliation / destruction of evidence,

Malibu applied its invented standard to factually distinguishable cases outside of this District, in
support of its argument that default judgment is a proper sanction. ECF 237 at 7-9. As explained
below, Malibu’s lawyers not only invented precedent, they invented evidence, too.

	  

5	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 247 Filed 10/08/14 Page 6 of 7 PageID #: 1840

The proof in the pudding is the submission of Pat Paige’s (“Paige”) March 14, 2014
Declaration as Exhibit E to the Motion for Sanctions. Malibu’s Memorandum in Opposition to
Defendant’s Brief in Support of Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Expert
Witnesses states: “There is simply no potential for Paige to ‘express opinions not disclosed in his
reports… Defendant has Paige’s final report.’” ECF 233 at 8.
Malibu then did the very thing it claimed there was “simply no potential for” when it
attached Paige’s March 14, 2014 Declaration as Exhibit E to its Motion for Sanctions against
Harrison, wherein Malibu states what Paige never states in his final report: “Defendant also
failed to disclose other drives.” CM/ECF 237-5; ECF 237 at 5. Paige’s final report never
expresses any opinions regarding the installation of a new hard drive on Harrison’s SAMMY
computer; that the SAMMY hard drive was a replacement drive; or, any possibility that Harrison
failed to disclose other drives. See ECF 237 at 5. Paige’s declaration only states that “a number
of external devices have been connected to both drives” and that none of the external devices
listed were disclosed in discovery or provided to him for examination. ECF 237-5 at 4, ¶¶ 28-29.
The “[a]rguments, statements, and remarks of counsel [are] not evidence.” Mayall v.
Peabody Coal Company, 7 F.3d 570, 573 (7th Cir. 1993); Probus v. K-Mart, Inc., 794 F.2d 1207,
1211 (7th Cir. 1986); Ramsey v. American Air Filter Co., Inc., 772 F.2d 1303, 1311 (7th Cir.
1985); Lenard v. Argento, 699 F.2d 874 (7th Cir. ). Accordingly, Harrison will move this Court
to strike Paige’s declaration as an exhibit to the motion and all portions of the motion referring to
Paige’s declaration, in addition to moving the Court to enter an order requiring Malibu to include
all parts of Harrison’s deposition transcript relevant to Malibu’s instant motion in a submission
filing. Harrison believes that the Court’s granting of such a motion will likely eliminate the need
for an evidentiary hearing.

For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Malibu’s Motion for Sanctions
Against Defendant for the Intentional Destruction of Material Evidence and award Harrison his
fees and expenses incurred in connection with responding to the motion; and for all other relief
this Court deems just and proper.
