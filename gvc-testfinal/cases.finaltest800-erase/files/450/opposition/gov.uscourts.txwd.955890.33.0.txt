Plaintiffs’ Motion to Extend the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Defendants’ Motion to

Case 5:18-cv-00680-JKP-RBF Document 33 Filed 09/04/18 Page 2 of 5

Dissolve the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and would respectfully show unto the Court
the following:
I.
On August 20, 2018, this Honorable Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt.
22) concerning Plaintiffs’ Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt. 20).
Subsequently, this Court extended the TRO and set a hearing for September 7, 2018. (See, Dkt
25).
Defendants herein, filed their Original Answer in this case (Dkt. 29) on August 31, 2018.

II.
Defendants CITY OF LEON VALLEY CHIEF OF POLICE SALVAGGIO, LT. ANDERSON AND
OFFICER VASQUEZ, CORPORAL MANDRY, OFFICER WELLS, CORPORAL FARIAS, OFFICER
EVANS and OFFICER HERNANDEZ, move the Court to dissolve the TRO based on the Younger
Abstention Doctrine. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43 (1971). The three-prong test for
determining whether the Younger Abstention Doctrine is applicable is as follows:
(1)

The dispute must involve an ongoing state judicial proceeding,

(2)

An important state interest in the subject matter of the proceeding
must be implicated, and,

(3)

The state proceedings must afford an adequate opportunity to raise
constitutional challenges.

Wightman v. Tex. Sup. Ct., 84 F.3d 188, 189 (5th Cir. 1996).
Defendants incorporate into their Motion to Dissolve, Exhibit A, the affidavit from
Assistant Criminal District Attorney Brandon Ramsey. Said Affidavit is offered as corroborating
evidence that all three prongs of the Younger Abstention Doctrine are met.

When the Younger Abstention Doctrine test is met, the Federal Court may only enjoin a
pending state criminal court proceeding if certain narrowly delimited exceptions to the abstention
doctrine apply. Specifically, Courts may disregard the Younger Doctrine when:
(1)

The state court proceeding was brought in bad faith or with the
purpose of harassing the federal plaintiff;

(2)

The state statute is flagrantly and patiently violative of express
constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph
and in whatever manner and against whoever an effort might be
made to apply it or,

(3)

Application of the Doctrine was waived.

Texas Ass’n of Business v. Earle, 388 F.3d 515, 519 (5th Cir. 2004).
The Fifth Circuit addressed an analogous scenario in Gates v. Strain, 885 F.3d 874 (5th
Cir. 2008). Plaintiff Gates brought a Section 1983 cause of action alleging that officers arrested
her unlawfully and used excessive force and were prosecuting her in bad faith. The trial court
denied the arrestee’s motion for an injunction and the arrestee appealed. The Fifth Circuit
affirmed the trial court’s denial of the temporary injunction based on the Younger Abstention
Doctrine. The Court analyzed that plaintiff’s request for a temporary injunction would enjoin the
pending state court criminal proceedings and clearly interfere with an ongoing state judicial
proceeding.

Second, the Court reasoned that the underlying state proceeding concerned the

enforcement of the state criminal law, something of which the state has a strong interest. Third,
the Court held that Gates could raise his challenges to the state criminal court proceedings in
state court. Accordingly, the Court upheld the Younger Abstention Doctrine precluding the
injunctive relief.
In the case at bar, Defendants offer as Exhibit A, the affidavit of Assistant Criminal
District Attorney Brandon Ramsey evidencing the fact that the federal proceedings would

interfere in ongoing state judicial proceeding, that the state has an important interest in regulating
the subject matter of the claim and that the plaintiff does have an adequate opportunity in state
court proceedings to raise constitutional challenges. Defendants respectfully request the Court to
dissolve this Court’s TRO and stay the civil proceeding under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 until the state
criminal proceedings have been concluded. Lewis v. Beddingfield, 20 F.3d 123, 125 (5th Cir.
1994).
III.
Defendants CHIEF SALVAGGIO, LT. ANDERSON

AND

OFFICER VASQUEZ, CORPORAL

MANDRY, OFFICER WELLS, CORPORAL FARIAS, OFFICER EVANS and OFFICER HERNANDEZ
would show unto the Court that based upon Exhibit A, state court proceedings have been
initiated against the following named Plaintiffs:
(a) JAMES ALLEN SPRINGER, Cause No. 2018CR7461
(b) JACK MILLER, Cause No. 2018CR8725
(c) MARK BROWN, Bexar County Court at Law No. 12, Cause Nos. 577193 and 577195
(d) DAVID BAILEY, Bexar County Court at Law No. 4, Cause No. 577789.
Defendants assert unto the Court that these criminal cases which have been filed in addition to
those which are pending investigations will be interfered with by this Court’s extension of the
TRO. Defendants move, based under the Younger Abstention Doctrine that the Court dissolve
its TRO and stay the civil proceedings herein.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendants CHIEF SALVAGGIO, LT.
ANDERSON

AND

OFFICER VASQUEZ, CORPORAL MANDRY, OFFICER WELLS, CORPORAL

FARIAS, OFFICER EVANS and OFFICER HERNANDEZ pray that the Court to dissolve this Court’s
TRO and stay the civil proceeding under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 until the state criminal proceedings
