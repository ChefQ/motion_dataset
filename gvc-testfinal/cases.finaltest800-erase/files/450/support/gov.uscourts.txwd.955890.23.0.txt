PLAINTIFFS’ BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION TO
EXTEND TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
This Court entered a TRO, ECF #22. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate their
arguments in ECF #20. Nothing substantial has changed since the TRO was entered.
No hearing was held, and the defendants have not responded to the Complaint or
TRO. The TRO, ECF #22, pg ID 5 of 6, expires in fourteen days unless extended by
the Court or with Defendants’ consent. However, Defendants object. For the reasons
explained in ECF #22, Plaintiffs request the TRO be extended until a hearing is held.
Respectfully Submitted,
