DEFENDANT YAHOO! INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO
DISMISS COUNTS ONE AND TWO OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
______________________________________________________________________________

Defendant Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo!”) submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion to
dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, and asks this Court to dismiss counts one and two of Plaintiff Beverly Stayart’s (“Plaintiff”)
complaint. If the Court elects not to grant this motion to dismiss, Yahoo! respectfully requests that the
Court stay further proceedings in this matter until resolution of the prior litigation between the parties,
Stayart v. Yahoo! Inc., et al, Eastern District of Wisconsin Case No. 09-CV-00116, which is currently
pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, case number 09-3379. Argument is
scheduled in the Seventh Circuit in that case on March 31, 2010.

I.

Introduction
This is Plaintiff’s second attempt to seek redress in this Court for her displeasure with the results

she encountered when she ran Internet search queries of her own name in defendant Yahoo!’s search
1

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 1 of 24 Document 10

engine. As her complaints make clear, the real sources of Plaintiff’s ire are the third-party web sites
appearing in Yahoo! search results that make what Plaintiff considers a distasteful or embarrassing
association of her name with erectile dysfunction medications. Rather than taking action directly against
the third parties that created these web sites for the reputational harm she claims to have suffered from
their existence, Plaintiff has instead targeted Yahoo!.
In Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), however, Congress mandated that
search engine providers like Yahoo! cannot be sued for delivering search results derived from allegedly
defamatory content provided by third parties. See 47 U.S.C. § 230. In apparent recognition that federal
law forecloses her real claim – defamation – against Yahoo!, Plaintiff has attempted in both this and her
previously filed action in this Court to plead her way around the statutory bar by styling her claims as
Lanham Act (in her previous action) and invasion of privacy (in the present action) in a transparent
attempt to mischaracterize them as “intellectual property” claims exempt from Section 230. In so doing,
she pleads herself out of court. In her previously filed action, this Court found that Plaintiff lacked
standing to pursue a Lanham Act claim on the facts alleged, and that Section 230 barred her actual
grievance. 1 Plaintiff’s current action is similarly infirm. The underlying facts Plaintiff alleges here are
insufficient to state claims for invasion of privacy against Yahoo! under Wisconsin law, and to the extent
Plaintiff could assert such claims, they are barred by Section 230.
Accordingly, as detailed herein, Plaintiff’s claims fail on three grounds. First, her right to privacy
claims are barred by Section 230, which is designed to prevent suits against Internet service providers
based on their role in providing third-party content. Second, she has not stated a claim under the

1

As described in more detail at pages 2-5 herein, the Court expressed similar doubt about Plaintiff’s ability to
sustain its state law invasion of privacy claims but declined to exercise jurisdiction over them once it dismissed
Plaintiff’s federal claim. Stayart v. Yahoo!, 651 F. Supp. 2d 873, 888 (E.D. Wis. 2009).

2

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 2 of 24 Document 10

Wisconsin right to privacy statute, and Wisconsin law does not recognize a common law “right to
privacy” claim. Third, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support the exercise of diversity
jurisdiction, because based on the facts alleged, her damages could not possibly rise to meet the
jurisdictional minimum.

II.

Procedural History of Stayart Litigation Against Yahoo!
Plaintiff’s attempts to obtain recovery for the appearance of her name in Yahoo! search results

have a long history. They began with the filing of a petition for pre-litigation discovery against Yahoo! in
Illinois state court, seeking information from Yahoo! about the identities of the publishers of substantially
the same content that has been at issue throughout Plaintiff’s attempts to seek redress. Stayart v. Yahoo!
Inc. & Overture Services, Inc., No. 08 L 11519 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Cook County Div., dismissed Feb. 18, 2009).
The Illinois court dismissed Stayart’s petition after Yahoo! verified its inability to access or provide such
information, as it lacked any relationship with the third-party sites at issue.
Undeterred, Plaintiff then filed an action in this Court on February 5, 2009. Her claims in that
complaint alleged that Yahoo! violated the Lanham Act and Wisconsin Statute § 995.50 based on its
display of language contained on third-party websites as well as “search snippets” that appeared beneath
search results returned when Plaintiff searched for “bev” or “beverly stayart,” substantially similar search
results to those that Plaintiff sought discovery on from Yahoo! in Illinois. Unable to determine who
authored the underlying web pages, Plaintiff claimed that Yahoo! itself had authored the snippets by
displaying them on its search results pages.
On August 28, 2009, Judge Rudolph T. Randa dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims, finding that Plaintiff
lacked standing to pursue claims under the Lanham Act because she did not have a commercial interest in
her name. Stayart v. Yahoo!, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 881-82 (E.D. Wis. 2009). The Court also ruled that
Yahoo! was entitled to immunity under the CDA, 47 U.S.C. § 230, because “Yahoo!'s search results
3

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 3 of 24 Document 10

include abstracts, or snippets, that contain multiple samples of text appearing in various places on the
third-party websites. Yahoo! does not create this content, it only displays the content in response to a Cuser's search results.” Id. at 885. As this Court noted,
Indeed, the only way Yahoo! could exert any control over the results of a
search engine query would be to change its underlying, proprietary
algorithm. This goes to the heart of Yahoo!'s role as an interactive computer
service. ‘[O]rdinary search engines [such as Google and Yahoo!] do not use
unlawful criteria to limit the scope of searches conducted on them, nor are
they designed to achieve illegal ends. . . . Therefore, such search engines
play no part in the ‘development’ of any unlawful searches.’ Fair Housing
Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com., LLC, 521 F.3d 1157,
1167 (9th Cir. 2008). In this respect, Yahoo! should be entitled to immunity
because it acted as an interactive computer service, even though Stayart's
claims are nominal intellectual property claims.
Id. Having dismissed Plaintiff’s federal claims, this Court then declined to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims because subject-matter jurisdiction was founded solely on the
presence of the federal claims. Although it declined to resolve the state claims, the Court did express its
skepticism, stating that it would be an “unlikely scenario” for Plaintiff to be able to assert a commercial
interest in her name sufficient to render it an intellectual property claim exempt from the CDA. Id. at 888.
This Court also denied Plaintiff leave to replead her claims, because
[I]n the clear absence of any valid federal claims, Stayart would need an
alternative basis to invoke federal jurisdiction on her state law claims. The
parties may be diverse, but it does not seem likely that Stayart could make a
good faith allegation that her damages are more than $75,000. See §
1332(a). Given the likelihood that Stayart's injuries are de minimus,
granting leave to replead would simply invite more litigation over the
propriety of federal jurisdiction.
Id at 889. Plaintiff has now appealed this ruling, and argument is set in the Seventh Circuit for March 31,
2010.

4

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 4 of 24 Document 10

Undaunted by this Court’s denial of leave to replead, Plaintiff simply filed a new complaint based
on the same underlying conduct that continued to occur after the filing of her first complaint. This
complaint eschews all federal claims, and claims that this Court has jurisdiction because her claims
present more than $75,000 in damages and makes similarly deficient claims regarding a commercial
interest in her name. (Compl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff changes tactics ever so slightly, foregoing claims based on
“search snippet” language, and instead identifying two different aspects of Yahoo!’s search page as a basis
for liability: “Search assist” and “suggested searches” at the top and bottom of each page of search
results. (Id. ¶¶ 43-45). As shown herein, that change in tactics does not save Plaintiff’s claims. Like the
search snippets at issue in her first complaint, the “search assist” and “suggested searches” are products of
Yahoo!’s algorithm, and as such Plaintiff’s newest attempt fails for similar reasons as her prior failed
complaint.

III.

Plaintiff’s Allegations
A.

Plaintiff’s Background and Activities

Plaintiff is a typical Internet user. According to her complaint, she uses the Internet for academic
research. (Id. ¶ 13.) She makes comments in online discussion forums and has published her own writing
online. (Id. ¶ 14.) There are no allegations that Plaintiff has attempted to become particularly popular on
the Internet, or has used whatever notoriety she may have achieved to profit. In fact, Plaintiff alleges that
she “has never given . . . any third party, any permission, authority, or license to use or sell the right to use
the name ‘Beverly Stayart’ or ‘Bev Stayart’ for the promotion or sale of any goods or services on the
Internet, or in any other media, either directly or indirectly.” (Id. ¶ 24.) Plaintiff further alleges that her
“name has commercial value for advertising purposes or for purposes of trade for her public advocacy
work on behalf of animals, her positive and wholesome image, and the popularity of her scholarly posts on
the internet at www.saponitown.com.” (Id. ¶ 18). Plaintiff thus does not suggest any basis for finding
5

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 5 of 24 Document 10

that her name has any currency with the makers of an erectile dysfunction drug, and instead suggests just
the opposite—that her image is wholesome, positive, and not at all associated with such products.

B.

The Nature of Yahoo!’s Businesses

Yahoo! is an interactive computer service, which provides, among other services, a search engine
to Internet users. (Id. ¶¶ 28-30.) Yahoo!’s search engine, through its proprietary algorithmic software,
crawls the web, indexes web sites and pages across the entire Internet, and displays search results pages in
response to queries, as shown in the figure below. (Id. ¶¶ 29-30.)

That same algorithmic software is used to create search suggestions, such as those shown at the top of the
graphic above preceded by the words “Also try.” (Id.)

C.

Plaintiff’s Allegations Against Yahoo!

Plaintiff’s allegations are centered on two alleged appearances of her name on Yahoo!’s search
website—both of which she found in the course of entering searches for her own name: (1) the appearance
6

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 6 of 24 Document 10

of “Also try: bev stayart levitra” as a link at the top and bottom of the pages displaying the search results
for “bev stayart” and (2) the automatic search suggestion “levitra” that appeared when Plaintiff started
typing “Bev Stayart” into the Yahoo! search box. (Compl. ¶¶ 39, 40, 44-46 & Ex. 7..
She alleges that the display of her name next to the name of a prescription drug caused her some
unspecified harm, and that many of the sites that appear in the search results contain malware, 2 though she
acknowledges the malware originated from third-party websites and that she contributed her name as the
search query. (Compl. ¶ 47). Most significantly, she does not allege that any other individuals viewed or
encountered the search assist queries, nor does she allege that she suffered any actual commercial harm or
anything other than hurt feelings as a result of the alleged search assist results. To the contrary, she
alleges that she has never allowed any party to use her name for a commercial purpose—and as such could
not have suffered any commercial or financial harm. (Id. ¶ 24.)

IV.

Standards on a Motion to Dismiss
While a complaint “does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide

the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitlement to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions and a formulaic
recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555
(2007). The Court need not accept as true “threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s elements, supported
by mere conclusory statements.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009). Notice pleading “marks
a more notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but
it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.” Id. at
1950. A party can also “plead itself out of court by pleading facts that establish an impenetrable defense

Malware “is short for malicious software and is typically used as a catch-all term to refer to any software designed
to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network, whether it's a virus, spyware, et al.” Robert

to its claims . . . If the plaintiff voluntarily provides unnecessary facts in her complaint, the defendant may
use those facts to demonstrate that she is not entitled to relief.” Tamayo v. Blagojevich, 526 F.3d 1074,
1086 (7th Cir. 2008); Thomas v. Farley, 31 F.3d 557, 558-59 (7th Cir. 1994).

V.

The CDA Bars Plaintiffs’ Claims
Section 230(c)(1) of the CDA provides that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer

service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information
content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1). An “interactive computer service” (“ICS”) is defined as “any
information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by
multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the
Internet….” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). An “information content provider,” by contrast, is defined as “any
person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information
provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3).
Congress passed the immunity provision in 1996 “for two basic policy reasons: to promote the free
exchange of information and ideas over the Internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive
or obscene material.” Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003). “In light
of these concerns, reviewing courts have treated § 230(c) immunity as quite robust[.]” Id. at 1123. The
Fourth Circuit found that, because the plain language of Section 230(c)(1) “creates a federal immunity to
any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party
user of the service,” an internet service was immune from liability for both publishing third-party content
and delaying in removal of the content. Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 330-31 (4th Cir.
1997). As the court stated:
Congress made a policy choice . . . not to deter harmful online speech
through the separate route of imposing tort liability on companies that serve
as intermediaries for other parties' potentially injurious messages . . . . The
8

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 8 of 24 Document 10

specter of tort liability in an area of such prolific speech would have an
obvious chilling effect. It would be impossible for service providers to
screen each of their millions of postings for possible problems. Faced with
potential liability for each message republished by their services, interactive
computer service providers might choose to severely restrict the number and
type of messages posted. Congress considered the weight of the speech
interests implicated and chose to immunize service providers to avoid any
such restrictive effect.
Id. at 330-31. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have been joined by the First, Tenth, and, most importantly,
the Seventh Circuit in recognizing Section 230’s broad protection. 3 See Chicago Lawyer’s Comm. For
Civil Rights Under Law v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666, 672 (7th Cir. 2008); Ben Ezra, Weinstein and
Co., Inc. v. America Online Inc., 206 F.3d 980, 984-85(10th Cir. 2000); Universal Comm. Sys., Inc. v.
Lycos, Inc. 478 F.3d 413, 418-19 (1st Cir. 2007). As discussed below, the services offered by Yahoo! are
exactly the kind Congress enacted the CDA to protect, and Plaintiff’s claims fall directly within the
CDA’s immunity provisions. See Murawski v. Pataki, 514 F. Supp. 2d 577, 591 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (noting
that search engine Ask.com is an ICS); Kruska v. Perverted Justice Found. Inc., No. CV 08-0054-PHXSMM, 2008 WL 2705377 at *4 (D. Ariz. 2008) (dismissing § 43(a) Lanham Act claim because of domain
registrar’s CDA immunity); Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1125 (finding CDA immunity for website against
claims of misappropriation or invasion of privacy).

A.

CDA Immunity May Be Decided on a Motion To Dismiss.

Courts have found consistently that CDA immunity may be resolved on a motion to dismiss.
“Section 230 immunity, like other forms of immunity, is generally accorded effect at the first logical point
in the litigation process.” Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F. 3d 250, 254 (4th Cir.

3

Moreover, in passing the “Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act,” Congress explicitly endorsed this body
of law. See 47 U.S.C. § 941 (extending protections of Section 230 to certain entities); H.R. Rep. No. 107-449, at 13
(2002) (“[t]he courts have correctly interpreted section 230(c)” and “[t]he Committee intends these interpretations
of Section 230(c) to be equally applicable to those entities covered by” the Dot Kids Act).

9

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 9 of 24 Document 10

2009). Immunity is “immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability” and “it is effectively lost
if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.” Id. (citing Brown v. Gilmore, 278 F.3d 362, 366 n.2 (4th
Cir. 2002); see Goddard v. Google, Inc., 640 F. Supp. 2d 1193, 1201, n.6 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (Rule 12(b)(6)
dismissal based on CDA immunity); Universal Commc'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc., 478 F.3d 413 (1st Cir.
2007) (same); Green v. America Online, 318 F.3d 465, 468 (3rd Cir. 2003) (same); see Barnes v. Yahoo,
Inc., 570 F. 3d 1096, 1098 (9th Cir. 2009). In Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, 657 (7th Cir. 2003), the
Seventh Circuit established that claims barred by the CDA may be adjudicated on the pleadings pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), and may in some cases be adjudicated at the same time as a 12(b)(6) motions
when expedient. See also Stayart v. Yahoo! Inc., 651 F. Supp. 2d 873, 879-80 (E.D. Wis. 2009). That is
again the case here.

B.

Yahoo! Is an ICS and Not a Creator of Content

Plaintiff attempts to plead around CDA immunity by alleging that Yahoo! is a creator of the
objectionable content under 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3). (Compl. ¶¶ 44-45.) As this Court recognized when
deciding Yahoo!’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s first complaint, Yahoo! is an ICS. Stayart, 651 F. Supp.
at 885 (citing Murawski, 514 F. Supp. 2d at 591). Both of the “statements” Plaintiff alleges that Yahoo!
“created,” however, are search suggestions—one a live search suggestion that appeared as a user types,
and the other a search suggestion that appeared in a user’s search results. Neither of those statements,
then, are fundamentally different from the “search snippets” at issue in this Court’s prior decision in
Yahoo!’s favor in Plaintiff’s first action. In both this case and the last, Yahoo!’s algorithm “checks the
search terms entered into its directory against its databases, and applies a formula or algorithm, to produce
search result page(s) that may relate to the customer’s search terms. It also provides links, or embedded
addresses, to those websites.” (Compl. ¶ 30.) This is true with regard to search results as well as

10

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 10 of 24 Document 10

suggestions or links for searches that may be related to the searches the user submitted in light of the
results produced by Yahoo!’s algorithm. 4
The technology enabling suggestion to users of alternative search query terms and phrases does not
render an ICS a “creator” to defeat CDA immunity. In Jurin v. Google, No. 2:09-cv-03065-MCE-KJM,
__ F. Supp. 2d __, 2010 WL 727226, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2010), the district court found that that the
CDA barred false advertising claims against Google based on Google’s practice of suggesting
trademarked words to customers of its AdWords program when those users searched for related terms.
Through AdWords, Google sells keyword advertising to businesses, such that when a user searches for a
particular term, a link to the advertiser’s website will appear at the top of the search results or to one side
in a prominent location. Id. at 1. When potential advertisers bid on keywords, the AdWords program
provides additional search query suggestions. Id. In Jurin, the plaintiff challenged the suggestion of his
trademarked name to competitors as a possible AdWord on which to bid. The court dismissed plaintiffs’
claims, holding:
Defendant does not provide the content of the ‘Sponsored link’
advertisements. It provides a space and service and thereafter charges for its
service. By suggesting keywords to competing advertisers Defendant
merely helps third parties to refine their content. This is tantamount to the
editorial process protected by the CDA. Defendant’s keyword suggestion
tool hardly amounts to the participation necessary to disqualify it of CDA
immunity. Rather it is a ‘neutral tool,’ that does nothing more than
provide options that advertisers could adopt or reject at their discretion,
thus entitling the operator to immunity.

4

Significantly, Plaintiff does not allege that the process for generating the search suggestions referenced in the
current complaint involves any knowing choice by Yahoo! or its employees to draft or input the suggestions at
issue. Nor can she. Although not pertinent to this motion to dismiss, which can be resolved solely on the basis of
Plaintiff’s complaint, the “search assist” and “see also” text at issue here are not authored by Yahoo! but, like the
search results and “snippets” at issue in the first action, are generated by Yahoo!’s search algorithm based on search
query content provided by third party users of Yahoo!’s search engine.

11

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 11 of 24 Document 10

Id. at 4 (citing Goddard v. Google, 640 F. Supp. 2d 1193, 1197-98 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (emphasis added)).
Yahoo!’s practice of suggesting search results is similarly a neutral tool. Here, as in Jurin, the user
(and here the only alleged user is Plaintiff herself) provides search terms, and Yahoo!’s algorithmic search
engine provides suggestions—based on the content of search queries entered by prior users—to aid that
user in refining their search. Ultimately, however, it is the searcher and the websites in the search results
that benefit from the combination of terms—not Yahoo!. As such, Yahoo! is not a content creator, and its
CDA immunity remains intact.

C.

Plaintiff’s Right to Privacy Claims Are Not Intellectual Property Claims, and
As Such, Are Barred by the CDA.

Although the CDA provides that it has no effect on intellectual property law, 47 U.S.C. § 230(e), a
state’s particular characterization of a claim as “intellectual property” is not determinative. See Perfect
10, Inc. v. CCBill LLC, 488 F.3d 1102, 1118 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[p]ermitting the reach of any particular
state’s definition of intellectual property to dictate the contours of this federal immunity would be contrary
to Congress’s expressed goal of insulating the development of the Internet from the various state-law
regimes.”); cf. Doe v. Friendfinder Network, Inc., 540 F. Supp. 2d 288, 306 (D.N.H. 2008) (finding that a
“intellectual property” includes state law intellectual property claims.)
Plaintiff’s attempt to characterize her defamation claim as an “intellectual property” claim must
fail. Federal intellectual property claims, like trademark and copyright, protect commercial interests in
intellectual property. See Stayart, 558 F. Supp. 2d at 882 (commercial interest required to have standing
to bring a Lanham Act claim). Similarly, this Court noted that a “right to privacy” claim under Wisconsin
law may be an intellectual property claim, but only if a plaintiff is able to allege commercial harm:
The only way the [intellectual property] exception [to the CDA] could be
implicated is if Stayart demonstrates that she has a property interest in the
commercial value of her name (like “CrazyLegs” Hirsch), such that her
claim could be considered an intellectual property claim.
12

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 12 of 24 Document 10

Id. at 889 (emphasis added).
Plaintiff attempts to comply with this Court’s ruling by titling her claim a “right to privacy” claim
and making conclusory allegations that her name has “commercial value.” Under Twombly, conclusory
allegations are insufficient in light of the other allegations in her complaint. The substance of Plaintiff’s
complaint is that third-party content associating her name with “levitra” damaged her “good name” -- a
claim that is no more than a garden-variety defamation claim unquestionably barred by the CDA. See
Storms v. Action Wis. Inc., 750 N.W.2d 739, 748 (Wis. 2008). The complaint begins with a discussion of
her “image.” (Compl. ¶¶ 7-18.) Her communication with Yahoo!, which she attaches to her complaint,
repeatedly references defamation: “Why is Yahoo singling out my client in this despicable fashion? . . .
Yahoo!’s behavior is nothing but a transparent attempt to further injure my client and her reputation.”
(Compl. Ex. 15.) Plaintiff’s claims thus arise from her allegations that her reputation is sullied, not from
allegations that her commercial endorsement was not properly compensated. She has never licensed her
name for any commercial endeavor. (Compl. ¶ 24.) Indeed, she has failed to identify any commercial
value to her endorsement, particularly in the context in which the third-party websites allegedly use the
words “bev stayart.” Plaintiff has again pled herself out of court because the “bev stayart” name, by her
own admission, has no recognition or value in the markets promoted by the websites cited in her
complaint; she has no connection to those websites. (Compl. ¶ 18.) Accordingly, her claims sound in
defamation, lack the commercial component required to be intellectual property claims, and are barred by
the CDA.

VI.

Plaintiff Has Failed to State a Claim for the Violation of the Right of Privacy
Even if Plaintiff’s claims are not barred by the CDA, they should be dismissed with prejudice for

failure to state a claim. Plaintiff attempts to state a claim under Wis. Stats. § 995.50(2)(b), which bars
“[t]he use, for advertising purposes or for purposes of trade, of the name, portrait or picture of any living
13

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 13 of 24 Document 10

person, without having first obtained the written consent of the person or, if the person is a minor, of his or
her parent or guardian.” Wis. Stats. § 995.50(3) further provides: “The right of privacy recognized in this
section shall be interpreted in accordance with the developing common law of privacy . . . with due regard
for maintaining freedom of communication, privately and through the public media.”

A.

There Is No “Common Law” Claim for a Right to Privacy Under Wisconsin
Law.

As initial matter, there is no “common law” right to privacy claim under Wisconsin law. Indeed,
the Wisconsin Supreme Court only recognized a claim for invasion of privacy after the passage of the
statute. Hirsch v. S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc., 90 Wis. 2d 379, 387, 280 N.W.2d 129, 132 (1979). The
statute was enacted after the events underlying Hirsch occurred, see id. at 386, so the statute was not
applicable to the case, but the clear intention of the Hirsch court in interpreting the law going forward was
to make no distinction between a statutory and a common law claim. In fact, in discussing the common
law claim, it often described its elements with the same language used in the statute. See id. As the
Hirsch court stated, the purpose of the claims is to protect “the property rights in the publicity value of
aspects of a person’s identity[,]” that is, “to protect the property rights in one’s identity or name from
commercial exploitation by others.” Id. at 383, 395.

B.

Plaintiff Fails To Allege a Property Right In Her Name Sufficient to State a
Cause of Action Under § 995.50.

In simultaneously setting out the parameters of the statute and the newly recognized tort, the
Hirsch court distinguished “the tort of appropriation [from] other torts involving invasion of privacy” in
that only the former hangs on the question of whether a person has “a property right in his name or
identity.” Id. at 390, 397. Only where there is such a right, “the possessor of that property right may place
[limitations] upon the commercial and public use of the name.” Id. at 397. In applying the question of
whether the plaintiff in that case, former football player Elroy “Crazylegs” Hirsch, had a property right in
14

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 14 of 24 Document 10

his name that could support a claim for invasion of privacy, the Wisconsin Supreme Court quoted a law
review article entitled, The Tort of Misappropriation of Name or Likeness Under Wisconsin's New
Privacy Law, 1978 Wis. L. Rev. 1029, 1046 – an article that refers to the then newly enacted invasion of
privacy statute, which is now § 995.50. As that article states: “The rule is fairly well established that well
known athletes have a property right in their identities and are allowed to recover for wrongful
appropriation.” 1978 Wis. L. Rev. at 1046.
The foregoing makes clear that under Wisconsin law the presence of a property right in one’s
name is a prerequisite to a claim for invasion of privacy by means of appropriation of that right. As this
Court found with regard to Plaintiff’s first complaint, the allegations demonstrate that Plaintiff has no
celebrity status and her name has no distinctiveness or commercial value sufficient to confer a property
right. Stayart, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 888. To the contrary, as in her first complaint, Plaintiff alleges only
that:
•

•

She posts academic articles on a third-party site. (Compl. ¶¶ 14-15.)
She uses the Internet in support of animal protection activities and genealogy research.

(Compl. ¶¶ 13-14.)
•

She has participated in campaigns to save certain animal species. (Compl. ¶¶ 10-11.)

•

She has written two poems that appear on three Danish websites. (Compl. ¶ 16.)

Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that “Beverly Stayart” has become a popular keyword phrase 5 through the
actions of other parties that have allegedly used her name to drive traffic to their websites. (Compl. ¶¶ 1920.) In support, Plaintiff attaches an appendix to her complaint that shows five websites have received
traffic from Internet searchers using the search term “Beverly Stayart.” (Compl. Exs. 1 & 2.)
5

Plaintiff, however, ignores the fact that most of her claims concern “bev stayart” a name she does not allege she
used in her political activities or in her poetry.

15

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 15 of 24 Document 10

Although advocacy may in some instances amount to commercial activity or gain an individual
certain notoriety, Plaintiff never alleges that she used her name to promote causes or any particular
political advocacy or that she has ever been paid to do so. Instead, Plaintiff’s complaint merely alleges
that she “actively participated” in several environmental campaigns” contributes to a genealogical
discussion forum in which her “posts . . . have generated almost 17,000 ‘hits’ during the past three
years[,]” and wrote two poems that appeared on two Danish websites. (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 15, 16.) She does
not allege that she was the public face of such campaigns, or that her identity was used to garner support
for them. Rather, the Complaint contains nothing more than skeletal allegations that Plaintiff’s name has
value because of unspecified “public advocacy” and the “popularity of her scholarly posts.” (Id.)
If such allegations were sufficient to confer a property right in one’s name, nearly every person
who signed a petition for any advocacy or political group or posted on an internet discussion forum would
have an enforceable interest against anyone who used their name in connection with a product they did not
use or support. Such a result would be contrary to the Hirsch Court’s observation that “well-known”
persons have a property right sufficient to support a cause of action under § 995.50 and this Court’s prior
statements finding that a Plaintiff must have a commercial interest in her name in order for claims to be
actionable “intellectual property” claims. Stayart, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 888.
A number of cases brought under the Lanham Act for misappropriation underscore the necessity
for something more than mere political advocacy to create a property right in one’s name before one can
state a “right to privacy” claim based on the use of a name for advertising purposes. See e.g., Committee
for Idaho’s High Desert v. Yost, 881 F. Supp. 1457 (D. Idaho 1995) (unlike Plaintiff here, CIHD engaged
in a number of commercial activities in an effort to make itself the public face of the positions it
espoused); see also United We Stand Am., Inc. v. United We Stand Am. N.Y., Inc., 128 F.3d 86, 89-90 (2d
Cir. 1997) (enforcing a trademark where a presidential candidate’s campaign committee spent
16

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 16 of 24 Document 10

considerable sums promoting the mark, raising money, and trying to “commercialize” the mark); Brach
Van Houton Holding, Inc. v. Save Brach’s Coalition for Chicago, 856 F. Supp. 472, 475-76 (N.D. Ill.
1994) (providing protection for a candy company that used the “Brach’s” mark to market and sell candy,
in an action against an advocacy group that was speaking out against Brach’s management). 6 Plaintiff
thus could not have a “property right” in her name of the sort required for an appropriation claimant under
the Wisconsin common law or § 995.50. See Hirsch, 90 Wis. 2d at 387. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s invasion
of privacy claims should fail.
Moreover, a comparison of the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652A, B, C and D (1977) with
§ 995.50 reveals that the statute is modeled after the Restatement, with certain modifications not relevant
to the present case. Id., § 652C. Accordingly, the Restatement’s limitation that “[i]n order that there may
be liability … the defendant must have appropriated to his own use or benefit the reputation, prestige,
social or commercial standing, public interest or other values of the plaintiff’s name or likeness” is
applicable here. Id. Plaintiff’s fact allegations are insufficient to meet this burden. First, Plaintiff does
not allege that Yahoo! used the term “bev stayart” to promote Yahoo! at all. At most, Plaintiff alleges that
Yahoo! suggested searches that might be relevant to finding third-party content. Plaintiff also fails to
allege any facts to show that Yahoo! enjoyed any benefit from the reputation, prestige, social or
commercial standing, public interest or other values of Plaintiff’s name. On the contrary, the Complaint
makes evident that Plaintiff could never make such a showing where: (1) Plaintiff’s name, in the vast
context of the Internet, did not possess these virtues to the extent needed to state a claim; (2) Yahoo!’s

alleged use of the term “bev stayart” was so de minimis that no such benefit could possibly have accrued
to Yahoo!; and (3) users had already navigated to Yahoo!’s website before ever encountering Plaintiff’s
name.
Additionally, as in her first attempt, Plaintiff has pleaded herself out of court. Under § 995.50, a
“right of privacy” claim may only stand if Plaintiff is identifiable from the use of her name. Hirsch, 90
Wis. 2d at 387; see also Cohen v. Herbal Concepts, Inc., 472 N.E.2d 307, 309 (N.Y. 1984) (plaintiff must
be capable of identification from the objectionable material itself). Plaintiff’s own allegations regarding
her good name and lack of connection with the products at issue make clear that no reasonable person
would ever confuse Plaintiff Beverly Stayart with a “bev stayart” that endorses levitra. (Compl. ¶24; Ex.
15); Stayart, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 888.

VII. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Because Plaintiff Has Not Alleged Facts
Sufficient to Support $75,000 in Damages
Even if Plaintiff has stated a claim, jurisdiction does not exist in this court to hear it. Plaintiff
alleges only state law claims, and seeks to bring this action in federal court solely on the basis of diversity
jurisdiction. To establish diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1322(a), a plaintiff’s claim for relief
must exceed $75,000, exclusive of costs, at the time of filing. Hart v. Schering-Plough Corp., 253 F.3d
272, 273 (7th Cir. 2010) (citing Gardynski-Leschuck v. Ford Motor Co., 142 F.3d 955, 958-59 (7th Cir.
1998)). Plaintiff alleges three types of damages, but fails to plead any plausible basis from which she
could ever recover damages that, in the aggregate, exceed $75,000.
First, Plaintiff’s statutory damages are non-existent. Under the plain language of Wis. Stat.
§995.50(1)(b), only compensatory damages are recoverable. Plaintiff, however, has not alleged any actual
loss of revenue from licensing her name, nor any amount of actual damage caused by the appearance of
her name in search results. She has not alleged any actual ill effects from the appearance of her name in
18

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 18 of 24 Document 10

search results, nor even that anyone other than plaintiff herself saw those search results. All that remains
is Plaintiff’s bare, conclusory allegation that she has suffered over $75,000 in damages. Under Twombly,
such an unsupported allegation is insufficient.
In Griffith v. Fenrick, 486 F. Supp. 2d 848 (W.D. Wis. 2007), the Court dismissed claims brought
under § 995.50 finding that actor Andy Griffith failed to satisfy the jurisdictional minimum where he
alleged only loss of merchandising fees, damage to reputation, and unjust enrichment. Andy Griffith
played “Sheriff Andy Taylor” on the popular television show “The Andy Griffith Show.” Id. at 850.
Griffith was the principal of Mayberry Enterprises, a company that licensed his personal intellectual
property rights and administered the licensing rights to “the Andy Griffith Show.” Id. The defendant was
William Fenrick, who had changed his name to Andrew Jackson Griffith before running for sheriff in
Platteville, Wisconsin. Id. Fenrick made frequent references to the Sheriff Taylor character during his
campaign and used “Andy Griffith for Sheriff” on numerous t-shirts, signs and other campaign materials.
Griffith alleged three categories of damage: “(1) loss of merchandising fees, (2) damage to his
reputation, (3) unjust enrichment to defendant.” Id. at 854. First, the court found that the loss of
merchandising fees were insufficient, because while Griffith had earned over $100,000 in fees, those were
earned over a period of 18 years—or $5,600 a year. Id. Second, Griffith’s only evidence of loss of
reputation was a conclusory affidavit from plaintiff himself. Id. As to the third alleged form of damage,
the court noted that Fenrick had lost the election, and it was unclear what benefit he had gained from the
use of Griffith’s name. Id. Thus, the court found that “it can be determined to a legal certainty that
[plaintiff’s] damages could not reach $75,000.” Id.
Plaintiff’s complaint contains even weaker allegations than the facts in Griffith. Like Mr. Griffith,
Plaintiff makes nothing more than conclusory statements regarding damage to her reputation and harm she
has endured as a result of the alleged use of her name. Unlike Mr. Griffith, however, Plaintiff does not
19

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 19 of 24 Document 10

allege that she has licensed her name in the past or any other facts providing a basis for calculating
damages. It stands to reason that if Andy Griffith, who appeared on one of the more popular television
shows in history and had a company devoted to licensing and merchandising of his name could not
demonstrate damages of over $75,000 despite blatant and repeated use of his name, neither can Plaintiff,
who has never licensed her name for any reason and alleges only that she is known as a poster on an
online forum and author of two Dutch poems posted on a website of unknown popularity, could ever reach
the jurisdictional maximum based on compensatory damages alone. 7
Plaintiff’s complaint also alleges two other types of damages: costs of suit, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and unjust enrichment. Costs of suit, however, are not included in the calculation for
jurisdiction purposes. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (“exclusive of interest and costs”). Even if attorney’s fees are
not costs under § 995.50, a plaintiff must have more than $75,000 in attorney’s fees at the time of filing to
support jurisdiction. Hart, 253 F.3d at 273. That is not the case here, where plaintiff has filed a simple
15-page complaint and provides no other allegations to support a finding that she has accrued such
substantial legal fees.
Nor does Plaintiff’s claim for unjust enrichment reach the jurisdictional minimum. Plaintiff
summarily alleges that Yahoo! has benefitted from Plaintiff’s appearance in search results for some
unpled, speculative reason—but provides no factual basis for inferring that the benefit was so great that
Yahoo! enjoyed any benefit much less $75,000 or more. Furthermore, under Plaintiff’s own allegations it
is clear that her name could not have increased traffic to Yahoo! sites (as alleged) because a user must
have already navigated to the Yahoo! Search page in order to enter his or her search terms. (Compl.

7

The dearth of compensatory damages also precludes Plaintiff from reaching the jurisdictional minimum by
pleading the possibility of punitive damages because the amount of punitive damages must bear some relation to the
compensatory damages amount. BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 580-81 (1996).

20

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 20 of 24 Document 10

¶¶ 42, 43.) Plaintiff never alleges that Yahoo! earned revenue when users clicked on links containing her
name. In fact, the exhibits Plaintiff has submitted with her complaint show otherwise. For instance,
Exhibit 7 is a list of search results containing the terms Bev Stayart and levitra. The only sponsored
advertising link—which are contained in the “Sponsored Results” portion of the search page on the right
hand side, as in the graphic on page 6—however, does not contain Plaintiff’s name at all—only a
reference to levitra. A user searching for levitra would receive that link (or a similar one) regardless of
whether he or she used Ms. Stayart’s name. As such, Plaintiff offers no plausible factual basis to
demonstrate that Yahoo! received any benefit from the use of Ms. Stayart’s name, much less $75,000 in
benefits.
In any event, res judicata bars Plaintiff from asserting any more than a de minimus amount of
damages. In reviewing the same conduct in Plaintiff’s first case against Yahoo!, this Court held that any
injuries to Plaintiff from the acts complained of in that action were de minimus and that it is unlikely that
she “could make a good faith allegation that her damages are more than $75,000.” Stayart, 651 F. Supp.
2d at 889. Plaintiff fails to provide any material facts in this complaint that differ from her first complaint
in determining the amount of damages. In fact, the only difference between the two complaints with
regard to damages is a conclusory allegation that Plaintiff’s damages are more than $75,000. This
unsupported allegation is simply not enough to overcome this Court’s prior holding regarding damages or
meet the jurisdictional threshold and should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

VIII. If Yahoo!’s Motion to Dismiss is Not Granted, A Stay of The Proceedings is
Appropriate
While, for the reasons stated above, this case may be dismissed on clearly established precedent, if
the Court determines that Yahoo! is not entitled to relief, Yahoo! respectfully requests a stay of further
proceedings pending the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Stayart v. Yahoo!, No. 09-3379. That appeal
21

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 21 of 24 Document 10

involves the same parties, claims under Wis. Stat. § 995.50, and issues regarding Yahoo!’s entitlement to
immunity under the CDA. As such, a decision in that case may reinforce the arguments stated above, and
may, depending on the Court of Appeal’s ruling as to whether the district court correctly declined to
exercise jurisdiction, have res judicata effect on the amount of damages at issue and the existence of
jurisdiction in this Court.
This Court has discretion to stay its own proceedings pending the resolution of other suits.
Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. United States, 124 F.3d 1413, 1416 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing Landis v.
North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936)). “The power to stay
proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the cases on its
docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis, 299 U.S. at 254.
In determining whether a stay is appropriate, courts “balance interests favoring a stay against interests
frustrated by the action” in light of the court's strict duty to exercise jurisdiction in a timely manner.
Cherokee Nation, 124 F.3d at 1416. Courts often consider the following factors when deciding whether to
stay an action: (1) whether the litigation is at an early stage, Seaquist Closures LLC v. Rexam Plastics, No.
08 C 0106, 2008 WL 4691792, at *1 (E.D. Wis. Oct. 22, 2008); (2) whether a stay will unduly prejudice
or tactically disadvantage the non-moving party; (3) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and
streamline the trial; and (4) whether a stay will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the
court. Tap Pharma. Prods., Inc. v. Atrix Labs, Inc., No. 03 C 7822, 2004 WL 422697, at *1 (N.D. Ill.
Mar. 3, 2004); Baxter Int’l, Inc., v. Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc., No. 08 C 2389, 2008 WL
4395854, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 25, 2008).
Here, the litigation is at the earliest possible stage. The stay will not unduly prejudice Plaintiff, as
the Court of Appeals has already set the case for argument, and it does not appear that a stay here will
cause an undue and prejudicial delay. A stay could streamline the issues for resolution, as the Court of
22

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 03/22/10 Page 22 of 24 Document 10

Appeals may resolve issues of CDA and jurisdiction, as well as issues regarding the continued validity of
similar state law claims. As such, a stay pending a decision in that case is appropriate.

IX.

Conclusion
Yahoo!’s motion to dismiss should be granted. Plaintiff’s complaint should be dismissed without

leave to amend.
