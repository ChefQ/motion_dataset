MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND
MOTION TO ENLARGE TIME TO FILE PRETRIAL MOTIONS

TO THE HONORABLE TERRY R. MEANS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:

COMES NOW, Christopher Robert Weast, defendant, through counsel Assistant Federal
Public Defender Angela R. Saad, and hereby moves the Court for an order continuing trial in this
case, which is set for April 14, 2014, and for a finding of excludable time under the Speedy Trial Act
as found in Title 18, United States Code, Sections 3161, et seq., for the reason, summarily stated,
that the ends of justice outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial
as the same is specifically defined in the aforesaid Act. The defendant states further that the factors
to be considered in this motion in making the findings requested are included in the aforesaid Act
in Section 3161, paragraph (h). In addition, defendant hereby requests that the Court enlarge the time
for the filing of the defendant’s pretrial motions.
The defendant was arrested on February 21, 2014 and the defendant was ordered to be
detained on March 3, 2014. The current trial setting of April 14, 2014, does not allow counsel to
effectively prepare Defendant's case for trial. Counsel needs to conduct a proper investigation of this
case, in order to render effective assistance of counsel, which will not likely be completed at the
current trial schedule. The defendant was incarcerated at Parker County Jail. Defense counsel

for filing pretrial motions for March 17, 2014. Counsel attempted to meet with the defendant on
March 4, 2014 and March 5, 2014 at Parker County Jail and the Federal Correctional Institution–Fort
Worth, respectively. However, the defendant was transferred to the Palo Pinto County Jail. On
March 10, 2014, defense counsel conferred with the defendant regarding the discovery. The
discovery has not been Defense would like additional time to confer with the defendant and complete
any necessary investigation. Specifically, a forensic investigation in this case has not been conducted
due to the leave schedule for our investigator.
WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully requests that the court continue this matter for
at least thirty (30) days to allow Counsel to be fully prepared for all aspects of his representation of
the Defendant and that the court continue the pretrial scheduling order accordingly to allow the
defendant to file pretrial motions. In addition, defense requests that the Court enlarge the time for
filing pretrial motions.
