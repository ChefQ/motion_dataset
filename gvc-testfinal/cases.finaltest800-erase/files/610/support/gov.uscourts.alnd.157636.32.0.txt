DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
A RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ SUR-REPLY
On April 19, 2016, Plaintiffs moved the Court for leave to file a sur-reply
regarding defendants’ motion to dismiss to respond to what Plaintiffs characterized
as defendants “new” “sovereign immunity ground for dismissal.” Dkt. No. 25, at
1. The Court granted the motion the same day, before defendants had an
opportunity to respond to plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a sur-reply. Dkt. No.
26.
Plaintiffs’ sur-reply misconstrues Defendants’ position, conflating a waiver
of sovereign immunity with a cause of action. Thus, Plaintiffs respond to an
argument Defendants have not made. Defendants respectfully request permission
to file a brief response to Plaintiffs’ sur-reply to address the distinction between the

two concepts, and to undo any confusion Plaintiffs’ sur-reply may have sown.
Defendants’ proposed response is attached. The proposed response is only five
pages in length and its submission will not unduly burden the Court or delay these
proceedings.
Counsel for Plaintiffs has indicated that Plaintiffs oppose this motion.
