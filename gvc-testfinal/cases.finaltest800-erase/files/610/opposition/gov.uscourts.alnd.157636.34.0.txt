OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A
RESPONSE TO THE STATE’S SUR-REPLY REGARDING THE MOTION
TO DISMISS
The State of Alabama and the other plaintiffs respectfully oppose the
government’s motion for leave to file a response to the plaintiffs’ sur-reply
regarding the motion to dismiss (doc. 32).
In its proposed brief, the government agrees with Alabama’s contention in its
sur-reply that sovereign immunity does not prevent any of the State’s claims. Doc.
32-1 at 3 (stating that the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity for non-monetary
relief, 5 U.S.C. § 702, “applies to Plaintiffs’ claims in this action.”).
Instead of confining its brief to that clarification, however, the government
goes on to make other points and cite to previously un-raised authority. Thus, in the
proposed brief, the government perpetuates the error it committed in its reply that
caused the State to obtain leave to file a sur-reply – namely, raising new arguments

Case 2:16-cv-00029-JEO Document 34 Filed 05/09/16 Page 2 of 7

and authorities not raised in the motion to dismiss. In any event, the government’s
new arguments are futile and are not supported by its cited authorities – new or old.
The government’s core point in its proposed brief is that a plaintiff may
never sue the government on an implied right of action. Doc. 32-1 at 4 (“[C]auses
of action cannot be implied against the Federal Government; they must be
express.”) (citing Reply, doc. 23, 1-2). That is not a point the government made in
its reply. In its reply, the government asserted that sovereign immunity, or a
supposed absence of a waiver of sovereign immunity, was the State’s hurdle. Doc.
23 at 1-2.
In its proposed brief, after conceding that there is no such hurdle to the
State’s claims here, the government takes the new position that Alabama – and any
other individual or entity injured by the government’s wrongdoing – is per se
unable to sue unless the statute in question contains an express right of action. In
support, the government cites three new cases. Doc. 32-1 at 4.
None of those cases supports the proposition for which the government cites
them, that rights of action may never be implied against the government. The
courts in two of the cases undertook the very implied-right-of-action analysis the
government asserts this Court may not undertake. Doe v. Attorney Gen. of U.S.,
941 F.2d 780, 788-95 & n.15 (9th Cir. 1991), abrogated on other grounds by Lane

Case 2:16-cv-00029-JEO Document 34 Filed 05/09/16 Page 3 of 7

v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187 (1996),1 (employing the Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78 (1975)
factors, and focusing on the second factor (but not ignoring the others) because it
was a case against the government, similar to the way Alexander v. Sandoval, 532
U.S. 275, 286 (2001) later did for all cases); Dewakuku v. Martinez, 271 F.3d 1031,
1034, 1037-40 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (employing same and following Sandoval).
Thus, the government may not rely on its quotes from those cases regarding
a “silent” statute or legislative history. See doc. 32-1 at 4. Those cases were
referring to the implied-right-of-action analysis under the Cort factors, and as
Alabama demonstrated in its opposition brief, the Refugee Act’s text, structure, and
legislative history are far from silent on whether States have meaningful and
enforceable consultation rights. Doc. 19 at 2-13.
In the third case, the court assumed there was an implied right of action for
damages under the statute, but held there could not be such an action against the
government for that particular claim – not because such actions may never be
implied against the government, as the government contends in its proposed brief,
but, rather, because there was no waiver of sovereign immunity for that claim.
Dorsey v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 41 F.3d 1551, 1554-55 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (“Even if
there is an implied right of action for damages under Title VI, and thus under § 504

1

In Lane v. Pena, the Supreme Court held that Congress had not waived the
government’s sovereign immunity against awards of monetary damages for violations of § 504(a)
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, abrogating Doe’s holding to the contrary. 518 U.S. at 192-200.

Case 2:16-cv-00029-JEO Document 34 Filed 05/09/16 Page 4 of 7

[of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973], it cannot exist as against the federal
government. The federal government’s waiver of sovereign immunity must be
‘unequivocally expressed’ and the statutory provision containing the expression
must ‘establish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims.’ . . .
While private rights of action may be implied, waivers of sovereign immunity may
not.”) (citing United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33-34 (1992)).
As noted above, in its proposed brief, the government in this case concedes that
sovereign immunity is waived as to all of Alabama’s claims, so Dorsey does not
apply. Doc. 32-1 at 3.
It is worth noting that none of the cases the government cited in its reply
brief supports its proposition that rights of action may never be implied against the
government, either. See Ishler v. IRS, 237 F. App’x 394, 397-98 (11th Cir. 2007)
(per curiam) (dealing with waiver of sovereign immunity regarding state law
money damages claims, not right of action issue); United States v. Mitchell, 445
U.S. 535, 542, 546 (1980) (declining to find implied right of action; because the
General Allotment Act “created only a limited trust relationship between the
United States and the allottee that does not impose any duty upon the Government
to manage timber resources,” the Act could not “be read as establishing that the
United States has a fiduciary responsibility for management of allotted forest
lands,” and therefore “[a]ny right of the respondents to recover money damages for
4

Case 2:16-cv-00029-JEO Document 34 Filed 05/09/16 Page 5 of 7

Government mismanagement of timber resources must be found in some source
other than that Act.”);2 Resident Council of Allen Parkway Vill. v. U.S. Dep’t of
Hous. & Urban Dev., 980 F.2d 1043, 1053-1055 (5th Cir. 1993) (undertaking
implied-right-of-action analysis, and declining to find an implied right of action for
a number of reasons, including that there was no waiver of sovereign immunity in
the particular statute); Contour Spa at the Hard Rock, Inc. v. Seminole Tribe of
Fla., 692 F.3d 1200, 1208-10 (11th Cir. 2012) (declining to find implied right of
action against the tribe under the Indian Civil Rights Act, because the Supreme
Court had already held that suits against the tribe under the Act were barred by its
sovereign immunity).
For these reasons, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny the
government’s motion for leave to file another brief in support of its motion dismiss.

After remand, the case returned to the Supreme Court, which at that time found an
implied right of action in a collection of other statutes and regulations. United States v. Mitchell,
463 U.S. 206, 228 (1983) (“We thus conclude that the statutes and regulations at issue here can
fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for violations of its
fiduciary responsibilities in the management of Indian property.”).
