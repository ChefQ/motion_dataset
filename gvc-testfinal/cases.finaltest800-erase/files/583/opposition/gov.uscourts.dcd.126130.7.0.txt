INTRODUCTION
Defendants file this memorandum to renew and supplement their opposition to plaintiffs’
motion for a mandatory preliminary injunction against the retention of Roman Catholic chaplains
over age 62 and to address the issues remaining after the D.C. Circuit’s remand of plaintiffs’ original
motion to this Court. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit determined that Establishment Clause claims
constitute an irreparable injury, affirmed this Court’s denial of a structural injunction, and found that
it lacked jurisdiction to review this Court’s denial of partial summary judgment. CFGC v. England,
454 F.3d 290 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus, the only issue before the Court is whether plaintiffs satisfy the
remaining requirements for a preliminary injunction against the retention of Roman Catholic
chaplains serving on active duty over age 62. See id. Plaintiffs fail to do so.
As to the likelihood of success on the merits, plaintiffs lack standing to bring their challenge
to the retention of Roman Catholic chaplains. No plaintiff has shown a personal stake or
particularized injury resulting from such retention. Instead, plaintiffs argue only that the Navy is not
following the law, nothing more. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that such claims do not
satisfy Article III’s limitation of the Judiciary’s jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies. The lack
of any personal stake also justifies denial of their claims under the prudential standing doctrine.
Even if the Court were to find that plaintiffs have standing, plaintiffs cannot show a
likelihood of success on the merits because, as was the case when they filed their original motion,
Title 10 grants the Navy discretion to retain chaplains on active duty over age 62. Because this
retention furthers the Chaplain Corps’ mission to accommodate the free exercise rights of Navy
personnel, such retention does not violate the Establishment Clause.
Further, entry of the requested injunction would significantly harm non-parties, the Navy, and
-1-

therefore the public interest. Plaintiffs seek the discharge of non-party chaplains who are currently
serving the free exercise needs of Navy personnel. Plaintiffs provide no justification for requiring
the discharge of these chaplains or for reducing the number of chaplains available to meet the
religious needs of Navy personnel prior to final resolution of their claims. Given the lack of any
personal stake in this litigation, plaintiffs’ purported interest in a mandatory preliminary injunction
does not outweigh this significant harm such an injunction would cause to third parties, the Navy,
and the public interest.
BACKGROUND
This case consolidates three pending cases: CFGC v. Winter, No. 99-2945 (RMU), Adair v.
Winter, No. 00-566 (RMU), and Gibson v. United States Navy, No. 06-1696 (RMU). Because this
Court is well aware of the background of these cases, see Adair v. Winter, 451 F. Supp.2d 210, 212
(D.D.C. 2006) (dispensing with detailed recitation of background in light of publication of nearly
a dozen opinions in these cases), defendants limit their background discussion to matters relevant
to this motion. In 2003, plaintiffs sought a preliminary and structural injunction and partial summary
judgment, alleging that the Navy improperly retained Roman Catholic chaplains from the Naval
Reserve in violation of statutory age limits and the Establishment Clause. See generally Pls.’ Mot.
for Prelim. and Structural Inj. and Partial Summ. J. and memorandum in support thereof [CFGC
docket no. 142] (“Pls.’ 2003 Mem.”).1 The Court denied the motion on February 7, 2005, [CFGC

docket no. 184], finding that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate an irreparable injury and denying
the motion for partial summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal.
On July 7, 2006, the D.C. Circuit reversed and remanded the Court’s denial of plaintiffs’
injunction motion. See CFGC, 454 F.3d at 305. The Court found that an injury alleged to result
from a violation of the Establishment Clause is irreparable and remanded to allow this Court to
consider the remaining prongs of the preliminary injunction analysis. See generally id. at 298-304,
305. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the denial of a structural injunction and found that it lacked
jurisdiction to review the denial of partial summary judgment. See id. at 296 & n.6, 305. By Order
dated February 13, 2007 [CFGC docket no. 245], this Court permitted the submission of
supplemental briefing to address the issues remanded by the D.C. Circuit.
On June 18, 2007, this Court issued an order consolidating Adair, CFGC, and Gibson into
this miscellaneous matter. See Order dated June 18, 2007 [In re Navy Chaplaincy docket no. 1].
The Court also denied without prejudice all pending motions and granted leave to re-file them in this
action. See id. Plaintiffs’ renewed motion followed that order.
ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs seek not just an injunction against Navy conduct, but a mandatory injunction
ordering the Navy to change its policy to their liking. See, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. Support Renewed Mot.
for Injunction [docket no. 3] (“Pls.’ Renewed Mem.”) at 1 (requesting injunction to order defendants
to take affirmative steps to comply with plaintiffs’ interpretation of regulations, statutes, and
Constitution). Mandatory preliminary-injunctive relief “is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one
that should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”

“ a preliminary injunction, especially a mandatory one, should be <sparingly exercised’” (citation
omitted)). To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must demonstrate: (1) that they are
substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their suit; (2) that in the absence of an injunction, they
will suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate legal remedy; (3) that the injunction
would not substantially harm other parties; and (4) that the public interest favors the grant of relief.
See Taylor v. Resolution Trust Corp., 56 F.3d 1497, 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1995); Adair v. England, 217

merits. District 50, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am., 412
F.2d 165, 167 (D.C. Cir. 1969); see also Morgan Stanley, 150 F. Supp.2d at 72 (stating that court

requirements set forth above). Indeed, “[i]t is particularly important for the movant to demonstrate

success on the merits, ‘there would be no justification for the court's intrusion into the ordinary
processes of administration and judicial review.’” Adair, 217 F. Supp.2d at 5 (citing Benten v.

should be required where plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against the military because of the
deference properly afforded to military judgment by the Judiciary. See Selland v. Aspin, 832 F.
Supp. 12, 14 (D.D.C. 1993); see also Sebra v. Neville, 801 F.2d 1135, 1139 (9th Cir. 1986) (“[T]he
test for injunctive relief is much more stringent for a government military employee than the normal
test for an injunction”). “Orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to
interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial
matters.” Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 93-94 (1953).
I.

PLAINTIFFS IMPROPERLY RELY ON ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE NOT “UNDISPUTED FACTS.”
Plaintiffs’ latest arguments rely on allegations of “undisputed facts,” see Pls.’ Renewed Mem.

at 6-11, that are disputed or are for the most part plaintiffs’ interpretation of the law. First, plaintiffs
incorrectly raise the specter of illegal denominational bias by stating “[n]o Protestant liturgical and
no Non-liturgical were allowed to remain on active duty” in the Retired Reserves and “[n]o statute
allows the Secretary to authorize a chaplain to remain on active duty past age 67 for the purpose of
qualifying for retired pay, i.e., obtaining a pension.” Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 7 (plaintiffs’ statement
of fact 4); id. at 14 (plaintiffs’ statement of fact 14). Plaintiffs merely assume that non-liturgical
Protestant chaplains have sought but been denied the opportunity to serve past the ages listed by
statute. Plaintiffs have not developed any evidence of a pattern of requests by non-liturgical
Protestant chaplains or chaplains of any other faith group category, much less denials of such
requests. Absent a showing of a pattern of such requests and denials, plaintiffs have not supported
their implication that only Roman Catholics are permitted to remain on active duty past age 62 while
non-liturgicals are not. Further, two chaplains currently serving on active duty past age 62, a Jewish
chaplain and a liturgical Protestant chaplain, were not Roman Catholic. See Decl. of Capt. Stephen

T. Gragg (attached at Ex. 26) (“Gragg Decl.”) at ¶ 3 (listing chaplains retained on active duty despite
having reached age 62); see also Decl. of Veronica Berto (Ex. 1 to Defs.’ Mandate Mem) (attached
at Ex. 1) (“Berto Decl.”) at ¶2 (same, as of March 9, 2007).
Further, that most chaplains serving over age 62 are Roman Catholic is not a result of
denominational preference but a shortage of a certain type of chaplain necessary for the Chaplain
Corps’ legitimate mission to accommodate religious free exercise in the Navy. See, infra, Part II.C;
Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 16, 18-19; Defs.’ Mandate Mem. at 20-22. Plaintiffs present no evidence that
the Secretary has ever retained a chaplain on active duty for the sole purpose of allowing that
chaplain to obtain a pension.
Second, most of what plaintiffs present as facts are actually their own conclusions of law.
See, e.g., Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 7-9 (statements 5, 9, 11-13 interpreting statutes and regulations as
undisputed facts). Although plaintiffs label these statements as “undisputed,” Pls.’ Renewed Mem.
at 6, defendants disputed plaintiffs’ legal analysis and conclusions in all their prior briefing, see
generally Defs.’ Opp. Mem.; Defs.’ Mandate Mem; Defs.’ Mandate Reply, and do so herein.
Third, plaintiffs state that all the chaplain reservists serving over age 60 when plaintiffs
brought their original motion were serving on the Active Duty List. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 7
(plaintiffs’ statement of fact 4(a)). This is incorrect. As defendants stated in their original
opposition, many of the Reservists were recalled from the Retired Reserves. See Defs.’ 2003 Opp.
at 13. Because officers in the Retired Reserve are in retired status, see 10 U.S.C. § 10141(b), they
are not included on the Active Duty List or the Reserve Active-Status List (“RASL”). Specifically,
the Active Duty List does not include officers described in 10 U.S.C. § 641, see 10 U.S.C. § 620(a),
and section 641 includes “Retired officers on active duty.” 10 U.S.C. § 641(4). The RASL includes
-6-

Page 17 of 56

only those officers “in an active status.” 10 U.S.C. § 14002(a). As defendants have previously
explained, this distinction is important, because, for example, officers from the Retired Reserves are
not subject to the age limitation contained in 10 U.S.C. § 14509, see Defs.’ Mandate Mem. at 17-18,
and may be voluntarily recalled indefinitely under 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d). See id. at 17-18; Defs.’
2003 Opp. at 15; see also, infra, Part II.B.2.b.
II.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO SHOW A LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS.
A.

The Court Lacks Subject-Matter Jurisdiction to Grant the Preliminary
Injunctive Relief Requested by Plaintiffs because They Lack Standing under
Article III and Prudential Standing Requirements.

Whether plaintiffs have standing to raise the Establishment Clause claim alleged in their
motion remains to be determined; in deciding that an injury based on the Establishment Clause is
irreparable, the D.C. Circuit did not decide that plaintiffs had standing, it merely assumed standing.
See CFGC, 454 F.3d at 304 n.8. That a properly alleged Establishment Clause injury would be
irreparable does not mean that all litigants are the proper parties to assert such injury. As shown in
defendants’ prior memoranda, see, e.g., Defs.’ Mandate Mem. at 4-12; Defs.’ Mandate Reply at 5-8,2
and below, plaintiffs still lack standing to assert the Establishment Clause violation they allege and
therefore cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.
Article III of the Constitution limits the role of federal courts to the resolution of cases and
controversies. U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. An “essential and unchanging part” of that case-orcontroversy requirement is the doctrine of standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,
560 (1992). Among other functions, the standing requirement assures that the federal courts
“exercise power only in the last resort, and as a necessity,” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752

(1984), and that “the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in the rarified
atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic
appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982).
To establish standing, plaintiffs must show (1) an “injury in fact,” (2) a causal relationship
between the injury and the challenged activity, and (3) that a favorable court ruling will redress the
injury. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656,
663 (1993). Because standing is jurisdictional, plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing each
element with the manner and degree of proof required at each stage of litigation. Lujan, 504 U.S.
at 561; see also Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990) (litigant must “clearly and
specifically set forth facts sufficient to satisfy” standing requirements).
To satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement, plaintiffs must demonstrate a concrete and
particularized injury that is actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Lujan, 504 U.S. at
560. A particularized injury is one that directly affects a plaintiff “in a personal and individual way.”
Id. at 561 n.1; see also Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819 (1997) (plaintiff “must establish that he
has a ‘personal stake’ in the alleged dispute, and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as
to him.”); Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 543-44 (1986) (no standing where
plaintiff has “no personal stake” in outcome of suit). Plaintiffs fail to satisfy this requirement.
1.

Plaintiffs’ Lack Standing to Seek a Preliminary Injunction Against any
Allegedly Improper Retention of Chaplains in the Past.

Because a preliminary injunction is a prospective remedy, the Court cannot grant a
preliminary injunction as to alleged past retentions of Roman Catholic chaplains. To obtain

-8-

Page 19 of 56

prospective injunctive relief, it is not enough that a plaintiff may have suffered a past injury. City
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983); O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1973)
(“Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding
injunctive relief, however, if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.”); Fair
Employment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Marketing Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1274
(D.C. Cir. 1994) (plaintiff has no standing to challenge past practices absent probability of future
injury). Rather, plaintiffs must show that they are “immediately in danger of sustaining some direct
injury as the result of the challenged official conduct.” Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102 (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted); accord McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 226 (2003). The threatened
injury must be “certainly impending” to satisfy the standing requirements for prospective relief.
Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 158 (emphasis added).
In addition, to the extent that chaplains are no longer retained or changes in the law authorize
retention, see, infra, Part II.B, plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction is moot. See United
States Dep’t of Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U.S. 556, 559-60 (1986) (repeal of challenged regulation
rendered case moot); Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. EPA, 211 F.3d 1280, 1295-96 (D.C. Cir. 2000)
(challenge to EPA rule moot where agency issued clarification modifying challenged provision); see
also American Bankers Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 271 F.3d 262, 274 (D.C. Cir. 2001)
(dismissing claim as moot where agency “eliminated the allegedly unlawful provision and there is
no indication [it] will revert to its past [policy]” (internal quotes omitted)); National Mining Assoc.
v. Dept. of Interior, 251 F.3d 1007, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (challenge to regulations was moot where
agency adopted new regulations eliminating challenged provisions).
Thus, because plaintiffs cannot show an ongoing injury from any past retention or that
-9-

Document 7

Page 20 of 56

prospective relief will redress any alleged improprieties in past retentions, plaintiffs lack standing
to seek a preliminary injunction against the past retention of chaplains. See Weinstein v. Air Force,
468 F. Supp.2d 1366, 1375 (D.N.M. 2006) (plaintiff who alleged past violation of Establishment
Clause by Air Force lacked standing to seek injunctive relief because allegation of past violation
failed to satisfy requirement that he show threat of future harm).
2.

Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing to Challenge the Current Retention of
Chaplains Over Age 62.

It is not enough for plaintiffs to point to an alleged violation of law to demonstrate standing.
The Supreme Court has “‘consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available
grievance about government – claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper

benefits him than it does the public at large – does not state an Article III case or controversy.’”

That plaintiffs bring an Establishment Clause claim does not exempt them from Article III’s
standing requirements. A plaintiff alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause must still show
a particularized injury. See Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 487 (“[A] claim that the Government has
violated the Establishment Clause does not provide a special license to roam the country in search
of governmental wrongdoing and to reveal [such] discoveries in federal court.”); id. at 486

advocacy.”). Even where “a rather troubling constitutional question” under the religion clauses of
the First Amendment is involved, plaintiff must have standing. See Veitch v. England, 471 F.3d
124, 131-32 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Navy chaplain lacked standing to raise constitutional claims related
to his naval service where he voluntarily resigned from Navy).
Here, plaintiffs fail to articulate any personal injury particularized to them. Many of the
individual plaintiffs are no longer on active duty. See Berto Decl. at ¶6. These plaintiffs cannot
allege any injury from the continued presence of another chaplain on active duty, including those
challenged by plaintiffs. See Veitch, 471 F.3d at 131-32 (chaplain who voluntarily resigned from
Navy lacks standing to bring First and Fifth Amendment claims against policies related to Chaplain
Corps). Further, given that Adair is no longer a class action and no class has been certified in
Gibson, plaintiffs should not be permitted to cite alleged injuries that may be suffered by chaplains
who are not named as plaintiffs.
In support of their argument that they have standing, plaintiffs cursorily cite their allegation
that some of the Gibson plaintiffs are currently serving on active duty. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at
4. The mere fact that some plaintiffs serve on active duty is insufficient to grant them standing
because none have demonstrated that they are eligible for and were denied retention over age 62.
See Weinstein, 468 F. Supp.2d at 1373-74 (finding that plaintiffs challenging alleged Establishment
Clause violations at Air Force Academy lacked standing because they did not currently attend
Academy and failed to allege “a real and immediate threat that they will have personal contact with
the alleged Establishment Clause violations . . . ,” even where some plaintiffs were on active-duty
in Air Force (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Bois v. Marsh, 801 F.2d 462, 466 (D.C.
Cir. 1986) (civilian employee of Army who resigned before suit filed cannot seek equitable relief).

None of the plaintiffs have proven or even alleged that they are over age 62, requested continued
retention despite the statutory age limit, and were denied such retention. See Veitch, 471 F.3d at
131-32 (where chaplain’s separation from Navy not linked to Navy conduct, chaplain lacked
standing to bring First and Fifth Amendment claims against policies related to Chaplain Corps);
Americans United for Separation of Church and State v. Reagan, 786 F.2d 194, 201 (3d. Cir. 1986)
(in context of Establishment Clause claim, noting that stigmatizing injury “accords a basis for
standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged
discriminatory conduct” (citing Allen, 468 U.S. at 765) (internal quotation marks omitted); Saunders
v. Caldera, 193 F.Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2001) (retired Army officer lacked standing to seek

standing (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (quoting Albuquerque Indian Rights v.
Lujan, 930 F.2d 49, 55 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). Because plaintiffs do not argue that they were denied the
benefits they challenge, they lack standing to seek injunctive relief.
Plaintiffs also cite the treatment of plaintiffs Belt and Porter-Stewart, see, e.g., Pls.’ Renewed
Mem. at 21-22, who were discharged in 2006 under different circumstances and in compliance with
statutory directives not at issue here. These chaplains’ experiences do not support plaintiffs’
standing because, again, they are not similarly situated to the chaplains currently on active duty past
age 62. Belt and Porter-Stewart were discharged as required by 10 U.S.C. § 632(a)(1) because they
were lieutenants who failed to select for promotion twice, were not subject to any exemptions to that
requirement, and could not be retained on active duty because they were not selected by a
continuation board. See generally, Defs.’ Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Adair docket no. 145] at 9-10,
11-12. Further, chaplains that are similarly situated to Belt and Porter-Stewart were treated in a
-12-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 7

Filed 07/25/2007

Page 23 of 56

similar manner. When Belt and Porter-Stewart were discharged, a total of 23 chaplains at the rank
of lieutenant who had also twice failed to select for promotion were scheduled for discharge,
including 10 Liturgical Protestants and 5 Roman Catholics, assuming plaintiffs’ categorizations of
denominations into the faith group categories. Id. at 15. Unlike Belt and Porter-Stewart, who could
not be retained under the governing statutes, the chaplains currently serving on active duty past age
62 were retained pursuant to statutory authority. See, infra, at II.B.
In reply, plaintiffs may argue that CFGC and Associated Gospel Churches (“AGC”) have
associational standing to raise any injuries to chaplains these organizations have endorsed. See Pls.’
Mandate Reply at 8-10 (arguing CFGC has associational standing). Although the Court found that
CFGC possessed associational standing, it did so only in the most general terms, did not rule that
CFGC had standing to challenge the specific practice at issue here, and correctly tied such standing
to the standing that each individual CFGC-endorsed chaplain would have to challenge the alleged
conduct. See generally Order and Opinion dated August 17, 2000 [CFGC docket no. 30] at 11-15,
17-20. As with their own numbers, plaintiffs have not shown that any chaplain endorsed by CFGC
or AGC ever sought or was denied retention after age 62 such that they would have standing in their
own right.
Finally, plaintiffs may argue that they have standing as taxpayers. See Pls.’ Mandate Reply
at 11-12 (arguing taxpayer standing). The Supreme Court has consistently limited taxpayer standing
to Establishment Clause challenges of Congress’s exercise of its taxing and spending power. See
Hein, 127 S. Ct. at 2566 (finding plaintiffs asserting taxpayer status lacked standing where they do
not challenge specific congressional action, appropriation, or creation of legislative program); Flast
v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102 (1968) (recognizing taxpayer standing to bring Establishment Clause

claims, but stating that such standing extends “only [to] exercises of congressional power under the
taxing and spending clause of Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution”); see also DaimlerChrysler, 126 S. Ct.
at 1864 (stating that taxpayer standing limited to claim that congressional action under taxing and
spending clause is in derogation of Establishment Clause); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 619
(1988) (although taxpayer had standing to challenge constitutionality of statute allowing
disbursement of funds, taxpayer lacked standing to challenge Executive’s expenditure of funds in
course of administering or executing regulatory statute); Valley Forge, 454 U.S. 464 (rejecting
taxpayer standing to challenge Executive decision to transfer federal property to religious college).
Plaintiffs do not have taxpayer standing because they challenge specific decisions by the
Executive in administering the military, not congressional appropriations permitting the Navy to
operate the Chaplain Corps or enactment of any congressionally-created program. See Hein, 127 S.
Ct. at 1566 (taxpayer standing does not extend to expenditures of funds resulting from executive
discretion). In Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208 (1974), the Supreme
Court found that taxpayers lacked standing to challenge the Executive’s retention of Members of
Congress in the military reserves, id. at 227-28, a situation not unlike the retention of the chaplains
targeted here. Further, even if they were challenging congressional conduct, taxpayers do not have
standing to challenge congressional exercises of the Constitution’s Military Clauses, an authority
separate from Congress’s power to tax and spend. See Winkler v. Gates, 481 F.3d 977, 985-88 (7th
Cir. 2007) (finding taxpayers lacked standing to challenge statutes enacted under Military Clauses
and Property Clause).
At base, plaintiffs seek only to challenge conduct they claim is unlawful, not to rectify a
wrong that they personally suffered. As in Valley Forge, plaintiffs only “claim that the Constitution
-14-

has been violated, but they claim nothing else.” 454 U.S. at 485. Thus, plaintiffs have not alleged
an “injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III.” Id.; see also Lance, 127 S. Ct. at 1198
(plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge alleged violation of Constitution’s Elections Clause where
“[t]he only injury plaintiffs allege is that the law . . . has not been followed”).3
3.

Even if Plaintiffs Satisfy Article III Standing Requirements, they Lack
Standing under the Doctrine of Prudential Standing.

Further, even if plaintiffs did have Article III standing, the Court should apply the doctrine
of prudential standing to prohibit them from seeking relief on behalf of third-parties or on the basis
of generalized grievances. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 804 (1985); Warth
v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975). Even where a plaintiff satisfies the prerequisites for
constitutional standing, prudential standing requirements may still preclude the exercise of
jurisdiction. See Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 11-12 (2004). These
additional limitations on standing are based on the principle that the Judiciary should “avoid
deciding questions of broad social import where no individual rights would be vindicated” and are
designed to “limit access to the federal courts to those litigants best suited to assert a particular
claim.” Phillips Petroleum, 472 U.S. at 804; see also Elk Grove, 542 U.S. at 12 (without prudential
standing limitations, “‘the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public
significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the

3

Plaintiffs may also cite the possibility that some chaplains may be subjected to involuntary
retirement by selective early retirement (“SER”) boards in the future. See Pls.’ Mandate Reply at
22. This possibility is entirely speculative, as there is no evidence that the Navy will hold any
chaplain SER boards. In any event, such chaplains are not similarly situated to the targeted chaplains
because involuntary retirement by a SER board applies to a different category of officers under
different statutory authority not challenged in this motion. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 611(b), 638.
-15-

questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights”’
(quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 500)).
The specific requirements of prudential standing include that a party “assert his own legal
interests rather than those of third parties,” Phillips Petroleum, 472 U.S. at 804, and that a claim not
be a “generalized grievance” shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens,
Warth, 422 U.S. at 499. The doctrine of prudential standing and deeply rooted principles of
constitutional avoidance counsel against adjudicating a matter unless and until the actual proponents
of the rights asserted are properly before the Court. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113
(1976); see also Schlesinger, 418 U.S. at 222 (“To permit a complainant who has no concrete injury
to require a court to rule on important constitutional questions in the abstract would create the
potential for abuse of the judicial process, distort the role of the Judiciary in its relationship to the
Executive and the Legislature and open the Judiciary to an arguable charge of providing ‘government
by injunction.’”). This is particularly so where the Court is asked to decide constitutional questions
of “wide public significance.” Warth, 422 U.S. at 500.
Under the prudential standing doctrine, chaplains who may not have been treated in similar
fashion to those whose retention is challenged here, not plaintiffs, are in the better position to
determine whether they need to seek relief from any alleged favoritism of Roman Catholic chaplains
over age 62. See Singleton, 428 U.S. at 113. The prudential standing doctrine therefore applies, and
the Court should deny plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.
B.

Title 10 Authorizes the Secretary to Retain Chaplains on Active Duty Past Age
62.

If the Court concludes that plaintiffs have standing, it should nevertheless find that the Navy

-16-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 27 of 56

has complied with all statutory and regulatory requirements. Retention of chaplains over age 60 –
the governing statutory age at that time4 – was proper under applicable statutes and regulations when
plaintiffs first brought their motion in 2003. See Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 9-19; infra, Part II.B.3.
Changes in the governing law since then continue to authorize the Navy’s retention of chaplains over
age 62. Unlike the time when plaintiffs brought their first motion, when many chaplains on active
duty were from the Reserves, all of the targeted chaplains on active duty are either in the Regular
Navy or in the Retired Reserves. Chaplains who are not retired but who are retained on active duty
are no longer in the Navy Reserves.5
Currently, the only chaplains serving on active duty past their 62nd birthdays were in two
categories: (1) eight chaplains from the Regular Navy with ages ranging from 62 to 65 (specified by
designator code 4100), and (2) six chaplains voluntarily recalled from the Retired Reserves with ages
ranging from 70 to 73 (specified by designator code 4109). Gragg Decl. at ¶3. Each group will be
addressed in turn.

When plaintiffs filed their motion, the age limit for the reserves contained in 10 U.S.C. §
14509 was age 60. Congress subsequently changed the limit for reserve officers to 62, as reflected
in the current version of 10 U.S.C. § 14509. Pub. L. 109-364, § 503(c); Notes at 10 U.S.C. § 14509.

The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Pub. L.
No. 108-375 § 501, 188 Stat. 1811, 1872 (codified as amended at 10 U.S.C. § 532), eliminated the
requirement for officers to be initially commissioned as members of the Naval Reserves upon
entering active duty, and 10 U.S.C. § 532(d)(1) exempts chaplains from any requirement that they
be able to complete 20 years of active duty prior to age 62 to receive a regular commission. As
amended, 10 U.S.C. § 532 made all new active duty officers who came onto active duty after May
1, 2005, regular officers, and all eligible reserve officers were transferred to the regular officer force
by May 1, 2006. Berto Decl. at ¶7.

The Navy Is Authorized to Retain Chaplains from the Regular Navy on
Active Duty Past Age 62.

As to the first group – chaplains in the Regular Navy with designator code 4100 – Title 10
provides for separation from active duty of those serving in the Regular Navy at age 62, except
where separation is deferred under prescribed statutory conditions. See 10 U.S.C. § 1251(a).
However, Title 10 specifically authorizes the Secretary to retain chaplains in the Regular Navy past
age 62 if the Secretary determines in his discretion that retention is in the Navy’s best interest:
Deferred retirement of chaplains. – The Secretary of the military department
concerned may, subject to subsection (d) defer the retirement [at age 62 required]
under subsection (a) of an officer who is appointed or designated as a chaplain if the
Secretary determines that such deferral is in the best interest of the military
department concerned.
10 U.S.C. § 1251(c). Although any deferment under the provision cited above may not extend
beyond a chaplain’s 68th birthday, 10 U.S.C. § 1251(d)(1), the Secretary retains discretion to retain
the officer after age 68 under separate statutory authority:
The Secretary of the military department concerned may extend a deferment under
subsection . . . (c) beyond [the chaplains’ 68th birthday] if the Secretary determines
that extension of the deferment is necessary for the needs of the military department
concerned. Such an extension shall be made on a case-by-case basis and shall be for
such period as the Secretary considers appropriate.
10 U.S.C. § 1251(d)(2).6 Thus, Title 10 authorizes the retention of all eight chaplains from the
Regular Navy serving on active duty over age 62.
Further, none of the Regular chaplains are subject to Title 10's prohibition against retaining
regular officers at the ranks of lieutenant or lieutenant commander on active duty if they have twice
failed to promote to the next higher rank. See 10 U.S.C. § 632 (mandating discharge or retirement

6
Currently, no chaplains from the Regular Navy (signified by designator code 4100) are
serving past age 68. See Gragg Decl. at ¶3.

of lieutenants and lieutenant commanders serving on the Active Duty List who have twice failed to
promote to the next higher rank, absent application of specified exceptions). None of the chaplains
from the Regular Navy (signified by designator code 4100) on active duty over age 62 hold the rank
of lieutenant. See Gragg Decl. at ¶3. Further, of the two that hold the rank of lieutenant commander,
one has not twice failed to promote to commander, and the second, although he failed to promote
multiple times, is not required to be separated under 10 U.S.C. § 632 because he was selected for
continuation by a board held pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 637. Berto Decl. at ¶3 (describing promotion
and continuation history for chaplain as of March 2007); Gragg Decl. ¶5 (updating same). Thus,
none of the targeted chaplains are retained in violation of Title 10 after twice failing to promote.7
To the extent plaintiffs challenge the retention of chaplains in the Regular Navy, they argue
that where section 1251(c) allows deferral of a chaplain’s retirement, the chaplain must have already
reached sufficient time in service to obtain a paid retirement at the time of the deferral. See Pls.’
Renewed Mem. at 38-39 (arguing that term “defer” means that subsection (c) “provides no authority
to extend chaplains who have not attained the necessary time in service for retirement until they
reach 20 years service” (italics in original)). The plain language of section 1251 does not support
plaintiffs’ interpretation. Section 1251 requires that an officer (below the rank of rear admiral)
reaching age 62 “shall be retired,” unless exceptions apply. 10 U.S.C. § 1251(a) (emphasis added).
This plain language qualifies the officer for retirement, and it is that retirement that may be deferred
under subsections (c) and (d). Id. § 1251(c) (allowing deferral of retirement required by section

7
Further, the regular chaplain selected by a continuation board despite having multiple
failures to promote to commander, see Berto Decl. ¶ 3, is not similarly situated to Belt and PorterStewart, who served at a lower rank for which no continuation board was held prior to their
discharge. See Defs.’ Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Adair docket no. 145] at 11-12.

1251(a)); see also In re England, 375 F.3d 1169, 1177 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“It is well established that
when the statute’s language is plain, the sole function of the courts – at least where the disposition
required by the text is not absurd – is to enforce it according to its terms.” (quotation marks and
citations omitted)). Plaintiffs’ argument would lead to the absurd conclusion that no officer not
qualified for a pension would be subject to mandatory retirement, because he would not qualify for
the retirement contemplated by subsection (a) for the same reasons he would not qualify for deferral
under subsection (c).
Given the statutory authorization described above, plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of
success on the merits of any claim that the Navy’s retention of Roman Catholic chaplains from the
Regular Navy on active duty past age 62 is not authorized by law.
2.

The Navy Is Authorized to Retain Chaplains from the Retired Reserves on
Active Duty Past Age 62.

As to the second group – chaplains in the Retired Reserves with designator code 4109 – Title
10 permits the retention of officers from the Retired Reserves, first by authorizing transfer of officers
to the Retired Reserves and, second, by authorizing recall of such officers to active duty.
a.

Title 10 Authorizes the Navy to Transfer Chaplains to the Retired
Reserves Even Though They Are Not Eligible for Retirement Pay or
Benefits.

Although the targeted 4109 chaplains are not eligible for retirement pay or benefits, Title 10
specifically contemplates that officers in the Retired Reserves are not limited to those eligible for
retirement pay; section 10154 states that the Retired Reserves consists of two categories of officers:
(1) officers eligible for retirement after a number of years of service authorized by statute, 10 U.S.C.
§ 10154(1); and (2) officers “otherwise qualified” for transfer to the Retired Reserves. Id. §

10154(2). The military is empowered to interpret reasonably the term “otherwise qualified” in 10
U.S.C. § 10154(2), see Chevron U.S.A. v. N.R.D.C., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (where statute is
silent or ambiguous, issue is whether agency’s interpretation is based upon permissible construction
of statute), and has determined that the transfer of reservists not qualified for retirement pay may be
authorized under certain circumstances. See Declaration of Samuel Wyvill (Ex. 4 to Defs.’ Mandate
Mem.) (copy attached at Ex. 4) (“Wyvill Decl.”) at ¶¶2-4 (describing process of transferring
Reservists from active-duty to Retired Reserves);

Chief of Naval Operations Instruction

(“OPNAVINST”) 1820.1, Encl. 1 ¶ 6(b)(1) (attached at Ex. 3); Bush Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7-8, 10.
Under the governing Navy regulation, eligible officers may transfer to the Retired Reserves
regardless of whether they have completed twenty years of service. Currently, OPNAVINST 1820.1
authorizes transfer of officers “who are not qualified for retired pay at age 60, and are required by
law to be retired or discharged from the Navy Reserve” when they “possess critical professional
skills which are identified by” the Chief of Naval Personnel “as necessary to be retained in the
inventory . . . .” OPNAVINST 1820.1, Encl. 1 ¶¶ 6(b), 6(b)(1).8 To accomplish this transfer, an
officer is first removed from active duty and then becomes eligible for transfer to the Retired
Reserves. See Wyvill Decl. at ¶¶2-4 (describing process of transferring Reservists from active-duty
to Retired Reserves). The six chaplains with designator code 4109 serving beyond age 62 all

In 2003, when the Court first considered plaintiffs’ motion, the operative instruction was
Secretary of the Navy Instruction (“SECNAVINST”) 1820.2B. See Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 14-15, Ex.
C. That Instruction was replaced by SECNAVINST 1820.2C (attached as Ex. 2) on January 25,
2005, which in turn was replaced by the current instruction, OPNAVINST 1820.1, on December 24,
2005. All of these instructions permitted the transfer of officers not eligible for retirement pay to
the Retired Reserves. Compare OPNAVINST 1820.1, Encl. 1 ¶ 6(b)(1) with SECNAVINST
1820.2C, Encl. 1 ¶ 6(b) and with SECNAVINST 1820.2B, Encl. 1 ¶ 5(b).

transferred to the Retired Reserves under this or a similar provision of prior instructions.9 Berto
Decl. at ¶¶4-5; Gragg Decl. ¶5 (updating same and showing no change in identities of 4109
chaplains).
Plaintiffs’ implications to the contrary notwithstanding, the power to transfer Reservists
ineligible for retirement benefits to the Retired Reserves is not limited to the Roman Catholic
chaplains at issue here; the Navy has retained in OPNAVINST 1820.1 the power to transfer
similarly-situated officers from throughout its ranks to the Retired Reserves, not just chaplains. See
Wyvill Decl. at ¶7; OPNAVINST 1820.1, Encl. 1 ¶6(b)(1). Further, the Navy has transferred
officers who are not chaplains to the Retired Reserves even when not eligible for retirement pay.
See, e.g., Supp. Decl. of Samuel Wyvill (Ex. H to Defs.’ Mandate Reply) (copy attached at Ex. 9)
(“Supp. Wyvill Decl.”) at ¶4 (Navy transferred merchant marines to Retired Reserves). Because the
Navy authorizes transfer to the Retired Reserves of similarly-situated officers from all components
by a general instruction publicly available, not just chaplains pursuant to some allegedly secret
program as plaintiffs imply, the mere transfer of the targeted chaplains to the Retired Reserve does
not evidence religious bias.

9

Plaintiffs have implied that OPNAVINST 1820.1 does not authorize transfer of the targeted
chaplains to the Retired Reserves. First, they have argued that defendants changed their explanations
of authority to retire the targeted chaplains by citing past references to their retirement as honorary
and as transfer to the Retired Reserves. See Pls.’ Mandate Reply at 17-18. Transfer to the Retired
Reserves is also called “honorary retirement” – the two terms refer to the same thing. See Decl. of
Thomas Bush (Ex. G to Defs.’ Mandate Reply) (copy attached at Ex. 5) (“Bush Decl.”) at ¶¶3, 4.
Second, plaintiffs have argued that the Navy engaged in “a series of sham transactions” in
transferring the targeted chaplains to the Retired Reserves by first removing them from the Active
Duty List and then transferring them. See Pls.’ Mandate Reply Ex. C at 7. On the contrary, the Navy
followed the proper procedures, first removing the chaplains from active duty such that they were
eligible under OPNAVINST 1820.1. See Wyvill Decl. at ¶¶2-4; Berto Decl. at ¶¶4-5. That the Navy
undertook these steps in close temporal proximity does not evidence a “sham.”

Past Department of Defense and congressional action is consistent with this interpretation
of section 10154 and OPNAVINST 1820.1. The Department of Defense interprets 10 U.S.C. §
10154(2) as authorizing transfer to the Retired Reserves through honorary retirement. See Bush
Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 7. Moreover, the Department of Defense previously recognized such honorable
retirement for certain officers not eligible for retirement pay. See Bush Decl. ¶4; Department of
Defense Directive (“DODDIR”) 1215.6 (9/22/1987) (attached at Ex. 12) at ¶E.6.d.(6); DODDIR
1200.15 (2/16/1973) (attached at Ex. 13) at ¶II.C.2.a(4).
Further, Congress has by its conduct demonstrated approval of transfers to the Retired
Reserves of officers ineligible for retirement based upon years of service or for retirement pay. For
example, Congress passed laws in 1994 and 1996 regulating the issuance of identification cards and

Title 10 Authorizes the Navy to Retain the Targeted Officers from the
Retired Reserves on Active Duty.

Once transferred to the Retired Reserves, chaplains may be retained on active duty at the
Secretary’s discretion with the officer’s consent. First, the age limitation for reserve officers
contained in section 14509 (and cited by plaintiffs) specifically states that it only applies to officers
who are “not a member of the Retired Reserves . . . .” 10 U.S.C. § 14509. Second, Title 10
authorizes the Secretary to recall chaplains in the Retired Reserves to active duty:
At any time, an authority designated by the Secretary concerned may order a member
of a reserve component under his jurisdiction to active duty, or retain him on active
duty, with the consent of that member.
10 U.S.C. § 12301(d). This provision contains no age limitation; the only limitations provided are
that the officer be a member of a reserve component and consent to serve on active duty.10
Plaintiffs address only 10 U.S.C. § 14703 in discussing statutory authorization for retaining
Reservists on active duty past age 62 and argue that this section limits retention of any Reservist on
active duty to those under age 67, precluding retention of the targeted 4109 chaplains. See Pls.’
Renewed Mem. at 39; see also Pls.’ Mandate Mem. at 31-33. Plaintiffs’ argument ignores the

10

Plaintiffs have argued that the Secretary limited recalls from the Retired Reserve to no
more than 180 days, citing SECNAVINST 1811.4E (copy included with Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at Ex. G).
See Pls.’ 2003 Mem. at 9. That Instruction was canceled on January 24, 2005, and is therefore no
longer in effect. See ALNAV Message dated Jan. 24, 2005 (attached at Ex. 6) at 3 (listing canceled
instructions, including SECNAVINST 1811.4E). Further, as defendants demonstrated in their
original opposition, see Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 17-18, the Secretary had explicitly authorized the recall
and retention of such officers for periods longer than 180 days under certain, prescribed
circumstances. See, e.g., SECNAVINST 1811.4E ¶¶ 4.d, 5; MILPERSMAN 1811-010 (copy
included with Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at Ex. F) at ¶ 3f (“Recall or retention for a period greater than 180
days is authorized by SECNAV.”); Memorandum for Chief of Naval Personnel and Chief of Naval
Personnel, Commandant of the Marine Corps, dated May 28, 2003 (copy included with Defs.’ 2003
Opp. at Ex. H) at ¶ 1 (delegating authority to approve such recalls to Assistant Secretary of the Navy
for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (ASN (M&RA)) and Chief of Naval Personnel); see also
SECNAVINST 1811.4E at ¶ 5(a).

statutory authority applicable to retention of chaplains from the Retired Reserves and misinterprets
the limitation contained in section 14703. First, as explained above, chaplains from the Retired
Reserves serve on active duty under 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d), which allows the Secretary to order any
member of any reserve component to active duty. Thus, plaintiffs’ citation to section 14703 is
inapposite. Second, although section 14703 limits authority to retain officers to those under age 67,
that limitation applies only to retention under section 14703. See 10 U.S.C. § 14703(b) (“An officer
may not be retained in active status under this section later than the date on which the officer
becomes 67 years of age.” (emphasis added)). Because the Retired Reservists at issue here are
serving on active duty under separate statutory authority – 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d) – the age limitation
contained in section 14703(d) does not apply.
Plaintiffs also argue that Retired Reservists at the rank of lieutenant and lieutenant
commander who have twice failed to promote may not be retained on active duty under 10 U.S.C.
§ 14703. Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 39, 41; see also Pls.’ Mandate Mem. at 32. Again, section 14703
does not apply to the Retired Reservists at issue. To the extent it could apply, it does not prohibit
retention of chaplains from the Retired Reserves. Officers in the Retired Reserves serve in retired
status rather than active status, see 10 U.S.C. § 10141(b), and therefore do not qualify for either the
Active Duty List or the RASL. See, supra, Part I (Active Duty List does not include retired officers
on active duty, 10 U.S.C. §§ 620(a), 641(4), and RASL includes only officers “in an active status,”
10 U.S.C. § 14002(a)). The statutory requirements plaintiffs cite for officers who have failed to
promote apply only to officers on the RASL. Specifically, section 14505 applies to “a lieutenant on
the reserve active-status list of the Navy who has failed of selection for promotion to the next higher
grade for the second time . . . .” 10 U.S.C. § 14505 (emphasis added). Likewise, section 14506
-25-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

requires only that lieutenant commanders who have twice failed to promote “if not earlier removed
from the reserve active-status list . . . be removed from that list . . . .”. 10 U.S.C. § 14506 (emphasis
added). Section 14506 only requires removal from the RASL and says nothing of removal from
active duty. Because officers in the Retired Reserves do not serve on the RASL, these provisions
do not apply.11
c.

The Department of Defense Does Not Prohibit the Navy from
Transferring the Targeted Chaplains to the Retired Reserves for
Retention on Active Duty.

Finally, plaintiffs argue that chaplains with the designator code 4109 were improperly
transferred to the Retired Reserves before their retention on active duty, relying upon various
Department of Defense Instructions (“DODI”) to argue that the Department of Defense has
prohibited the Navy from transferring officers ineligible for retirement pay or benefits to the Retired
Reserves. See, e.g., DODI 1215.06 (attached at Ex.10) at 17 ¶6.6.4.4 (defining Retired Reserves
as including those eligible for retirement based upon years of service and those eligible for statutory
retirement benefits or pay); see also DODI 1215.19 (attached at Ex.11) at 17-18 ¶6.5.4.4. As stated,
prior Department of Defense regulations recognized the honorary retirement of officers ineligible
for retirement benefits, such as the targeted 4109 chaplains, by transfer to the Retired Reserves. See
Bush Decl. ¶4; DODDIR 1215.6 (9/22/1987) at ¶E.6.d.(6); DODDIR 1200.15 (2/16/1973) at
¶II.C.2.a(4). Although the Department of Defense later determined that it would no longer track

11
Further, because retired officers are not on the Active Duty List, the statutory requirement
that, under certain circumstances, officers at the ranks of lieutenant or lieutenant commander on the
Active Duty List who have twice failed to promote and have not been selected for continuation by
a selection board must be discharged, 10 U.S.C. § 632, does not apply to them. See 10 U.S.C. §
632(c) (applying separation requirement to Navy lieutenants and lieutenant commanders “on the
active duty list”).

officers with honorary retirement, Bush Decl. ¶¶5-6, the Department does not interpret DODI
1215.06 – the currently operative instruction12 – to prohibit the Navy’s transfer of additional officers
to the Retired Reserves, Bush Decl. ¶ 8, 10, and the Court should give substantial deference to the
Department’s interpretation of its own instruction. See Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 50910 (1986) (refusing to consider evidence to rebut military determination that regulation challenged
under First Amendment is necessary); see also Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512
(1994); Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 126 S. Ct. 904, 914 (2006) (“An administrative rule may
receive substantial deference if it interprets the issuing agency's own ambiguous regulation.”). Thus,
plaintiffs’ citation to a statement by a Defense Department official that the Navy must comply with
Department of Defense regulations, see Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 34 (citing Dep. of Thomas Bush
(Pls.’ Ex. 15) at 95:11 – 97:21) is inapposite; the Navy is not violating Department of Defense
regulations.
The Department of Defense has consistently held to this interpretation since the governing
regulation was changed. The Department of Defense informed the Navy at the time the policy was
changed that the Navy could continue to transfer officers to the Retired Reserves where needed, even
if they did not meet the descriptions in the Department of Defense’s regulation, and has continued
to do so since. See Bush Decl. at ¶10; Dep. of Samuel Wyvill (cited pages attached at Exhibit 22)
at 71:14-24, 80:10-19. Further, the Navy had approximately 38,000 officers in honorary retirement
when the Department of Defense regulations were first changed. Wyvill Dep. at 51:14-22. The
Department of Defense did not require the Navy to transfer these officers out of the Retired Reserves

12
DODI 1215.19 is the predecessor to DODI 1215.06 and was in effect between December
12, 2000, and February 6, 2007.

even though they did not fit within the new regulations’ categories, see Wyvill Dep. at 66:5-13,
71:14-24, and the Navy still has approximately 24,000 such officers in the Retired Reserves. Supp.
Wyvill Decl. at ¶3. The Department of Defense also permits the Navy to categorize officers
receiving statutory voluntary separation incentive pay13 as members of the Retired Reserves, so that
they maintain their statutorily required affiliation with the military, even though such officers do not
fit any of the descriptions used by the Department of Defense in its instructions. See Wyvill Supp.
Decl. at ¶3; Wyvill Dep. at 54:20 – 55:15, 84:19-25.
Finally, there is no specific prohibition against the Navy’s creation of additional categories
for the Retired Reserves. Section 10154 does not limit authority to create retirement categories
solely to the Department of Defense; thus the Navy may also do so where not prohibited. See 10
U.S.C. 10154(2); see also Bush Decl. ¶7. Further, the Department of Defense included no provision
in DODI 1215.06 that prohibits the Navy from creating different categories of officers for the Retired
Reserves under 10 U.S.C. § 10154(2). Indeed, the Department rejected the inclusion of such
language and permitted the Navy to maintain its statutory authority to transfer officers to the Retired
Reserves. Bush Decl. ¶8.
Plaintiffs cite Bond v. United States, 47 Fed. Cl. 641 (2000), to argue that the Navy lacks
authority to create categories of officers for the Retired Reserves not defined by Department of
Defense regulations. In Bond, plaintiff argued that governing military regulations required that his
tour of duty be classified in a certain manner and that the Air Force ignored the governing regulation
in classifying his tour of duty differently. 47 Fed. Cl. at 643, 659-62. This is not the same situation

13
In the exhibits accompanying this opposition, voluntary separation incentive pay may be
referred to as “VSI.”

-28-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

as that presented here. The Navy does not dispute that, where the Department of Defense requires
that an officer be classified in a certain manner, the Navy must do so. Here, though, chaplains
granted an honorary retirement and transferred to the Retired Reserves do not fit any of the
categories defined by the Department of Defense’s regulations. Thus, unlike Bond, the Navy is not
refusing to apply the definitions used by the Department of Defense to officers who meet those
definitions.
Plaintiffs also cite DODI 1352.1 and 1402.1, which contain definitions of officers in the
Retired Reserves based upon eligibility for retirement pay. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 33; Pls.’
Mandate Mem. at 28-30. These Instructions do not support plaintiffs’ argument. DODI 1352.1 was
issued to implement, among other statutes not at issue here, 10 U.S.C. § 12301(a). DODI 1352.1
(attached at Ex. 14) at 1 ¶1.2. Because the chaplains from the Retired Reserves are not retained
pursuant to section 12301(a), and DODI 1352.1 does not implement the section under which they
were retained, 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d), the Instruction does not apply to them. Similarly, DODI
1402.1 applies to the employment of those eligible for retirement pay in civilian office. See DODI
1402.1 (attached at Ex. 15) at ¶¶ 1, 3.2, 4.1. It is not surprising that the Department of Defense
regulates the employment of officers receiving retirement pay seeking a civilian position that also
pays a salary. That situation does not apply to the targeted chaplains.
Even if the targeted chaplains’ transfer to the Retired Reserves was not authorized by the
Department of Defense, any such lack of authority does not entitle plaintiffs to a mandatory
injunction under these circumstances. First, plaintiffs’ theory of standing relies not on the transfer
of officers to the Retired Reserve, but on the recall of certain chaplains from the Retired Reserves
to active duty, which they claim was based upon and evidences denominational bias in favor of
-29-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 40 of 56

Roman Catholics and against non-liturgical Protestants like themselves. Further, none of plaintiffs
allege that they have sought, much less been denied, transfer to Retired Reserves. Plaintiffs can
show no injury from transfers of other officers to the Retired Reserves solely based upon their claim
that it is not authorized by the governing law or regulation. See Lance, 127 S. Ct. at 1198; Allen,
468 U.S. at 754; Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 483. Plaintiffs therefore lack standing to challenge the
transfer of the targeted chaplains to the Retired Reserves. See also, supra, Part II.A (plaintiffs must
articulate injury particular to them and lack standing to challenge conduct based only on claim that
conduct is unlawful).
Second, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the transfer to the Retired Reserves, the
recall of the targeted chaplains from the Retired Reserves once they were transferred to it was proper
under the statutory authority described above. Because the relief plaintiffs seek is a mandatory
preliminary injunction, granting interim injunctive relief based on an alleged violation of regulations
with at most a tangential relationship to the injury plaintiffs allege, if any, is not justified at this stage
of the litigation.
Given the statutory discretion afforded the Secretary to retain the chaplains currently on
active duty past age 62, plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits of their challenge
to such retention.
3.

Retention of Chaplains on Active Duty Past Age 60 Was Proper When
Plaintiffs Brought their Motion in 2003.

Plaintiffs imply that the past retentions of chaplains was not authorized under prior law. See
Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 7 (alleging that “[i]n 2003, there was no authority to extend Reserve officers
on active duty beyond” age 60); id. at 37 (arguing that chaplains in Retired Reserves were illegally

-30-

retained, citing 10 U.S.C. § 14703). Even if the past retention of chaplains could be reviewed,
plaintiffs fail to show a likelihood of success on the merits. At the time, chaplains serving at ranks
lower than commander were part of the Reserves, not the Regular Navy. As defendants showed in
their original opposition, see Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 9-13, Title 10 grants the Secretary discretion, with
exceptions not applicable here, to retain on active duty certain consenting reserve officers, including
chaplains, until the officer reaches age 67, notwithstanding the age limitations contained in Title 10,
Part III, chapter 1407. See 10 U.S.C. § 14703(a)(2), (b). The only statutory exception to this
discretion is for reservists in the ranks of lieutenant and lieutenant commander serving on the RASL
who have twice failed to promote to the next higher rank. See 10 U.S.C. § 14702(a) (excepting
officers referenced in 10 U.S.C. §§ 14503, 14504, 14505, 14506 from authority to retain on active
status); id. §§ 14505, 14506. Because the reserve chaplains serving between ages 62 and 67 targeted
by plaintiffs’ original motion served on the Active Duty List, the Secretary was authorized to retain
them under section 14703. See Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 11.
Plaintiffs presented several rebuttal arguments that are inconsistent with the plain language
of the relevant statutes. First, plaintiffs argued that section 14703 applies only to officers on the
RASL, citing the titles of the part and chapter in which section 14703 is located. See Pls.’ Mandate
Mem. at 32-33; Pls.’ 2003 Reply at 10-11, 20; see also Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 37. On the contrary,
chapter 1409 applies to “all reserve officers.” 10 U.S.C. § 14001 (emphasis added). Likewise,
section 14703 applies to “any reserve officer,” not just those on the RASL. See 10 U.S.C. §
14703(a)(2) (emphasis added). A judicial interpretation of these statutes finding them limited to the
RASL would contradict this plain language. See In re England, 375 F.3d at 1177 (court must apply
statutes’ plain language without reinterpretation or creation of judicial exemptions).
-31-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 7

Filed 07/25/2007

Page 42 of 56

Indeed, if plaintiffs were correct, then the age limitation upon which they relied would only
apply to those on the RASL, not those on the Active Duty List and therefore not the chaplains aged
60-67 targeted in 2003. Plaintiffs cited 10 U.S.C. § 14509 for their contention that reservists must
be separated at age 60 (as of 2006 amendments, age 62). See Pls.’ 2003 Mem. at 6. Like section
14703, section 14509 is contained in Title 10, Part III, which plaintiffs argued applies only to those
on the RASL. See Pls.’ 2003 Reply at 10-11; Pls.’ Mandate Mem. at 32-33. If plaintiffs’ were
correct, then section 14509 would also apply only to officers on the RASL, and the chaplains whose
retention plaintiffs challenged would not have been subject to the age limitation cited, because they
were on the Active Duty List. Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways.
Second, plaintiffs argue that Title 10 required discharge of the targeted Reserve officers if
they twice failed to promote. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 14505 and 14506, cited in Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at
8, 39; Pls.’ Mandate Mem. at 7. These statutes apply only to officers on the RASL and therefore not
the chaplains targeted at the time. Because the chaplains under age 67 retained at that time were on
the Active Duty List and those in the Retired Reserves were not on either the Active Duty List or the
RASL, these statutes did not apply to them. In any event, the targeted chaplains with multiple
failures to promote were retained either under governing regulations prior to FY 2003, as was
plaintiff Belt, see Defs.’ Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Adair docket no. 145] at 10-11, 12, or by a
continuation board as required after FY 2003 in 10 U.S.C. § 637. See Supp. Decl. of Veronica Berto
(Ex. I to Defs.’ Mandate Reply) (copy attached at Ex. 16) (“Suppl. Berto Decl.”) at ¶¶3-5.
Acceptance of plaintiffs’ interpretation of these statutes would ignore and contradict
Congress’s intentional decision, spelled out in clear, unambiguous language, to authorize the
Secretary to retain reservists serving on the Active Duty List aged 62-67 under 10 U.S.C. § 14703.

Retention of Roman Catholic Chaplains Whom the Navy Has Determined Will
Provide Necessary Services Does Not Violate the Constitution.

Plaintiffs repeatedly argue, though they lack credible evidence, that the Navy’s intent in
retaining Roman Catholic chaplains over age 62 is solely to provide Roman Catholic chaplains with
pensions. See, e.g., Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 18, 23; Pls.’ 2003 Mem. at 1; Pls.’ 2003 Reply at 15-17.
First, the Navy does not limit its retention of chaplains over the age of 62 to Roman Catholic
chaplains. Gragg Decl. at ¶3 (listing chaplains retained on active duty past age 62 and their
denomination, including one liturgical Protestant and one Jewish chaplain); see also Berto Decl. ¶2
(same, as of March 2007). Second, as defendants set forth in their original opposition, see Defs.’
2003 Opp. at 16, 18-19, the shortage of Roman Catholic chaplains faced by the Chaplain Corps
justifies the retention of Roman Catholic chaplains over age 62. See id. at 18. As shown below,
because the Navy now faces a worsening shortage of Roman Catholic chaplains, it may properly
choose to retain Roman Catholic chaplains over age 62 with the purpose of meeting the religious
needs of the Navy’s personnel.
The Supreme Court has held that “[t]here is room for play in the joints” between the Free
Exercise and Establishment Clauses. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 713-14 (2005) (quoting
Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 718 (2004)). The Chaplain Corps represents a permissible
accommodation of religion intended to enable military personnel to freely exercise their religious
beliefs. See McCreary Cty. v. ACLU, 545 U.S. 844 (2005) (“[S]pending government money on the
clergy looks like establishing religion, but if the government cannot pay for military chaplains a good
many soldiers and sailors would be kept from the opportunity to exercise their chosen religions.”).
Accordingly, it is inappropriate to subject every decision made by the Navy in managing its Chaplain

-33-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 44 of 56

Corp to strict scrutiny, because in accommodating the free exercise rights of Navy personnel, it is
expected that management decisions would touch upon religion to some degree. Cf. Wilkins v.
United States, Case No. 99-1579, slip op. at 7 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 16, 2002) (copy included as Ex. 17)
(recognizing that in providing chaplains to accommodate religious needs, government “must become
directly involved in religious activity to a limited extent”).
Plaintiffs compare these cases to cases not found to involve legitimate accommodations of
religious exercise. However, as this Court and the Katcoff Court found, traditional tests for
Establishment Clause challenges are not appropriate. See Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 223, 232, 235
(2d Cir. 1985) (finding analysis in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) to be inappropriate in
deciding facial challenge to Army Chaplaincy); Larsen v. Navy, No. 1:02cv2005, slip op. at 25-26
(D.D.C. April 30, 2007) (Urbina, J.) (attached at Ex. 18). Instead, the proper standard for reviewing
decisions regulating the Chaplain Corps is the relaxed scrutiny applied by the Supreme Court in
Goldman. Larsen, slip op. at 34 (citing Goldman).14 Under that standard, the Court “assesses
whether ‘legitimate military ends are sought to be achieved’ and whether the program ‘is designed
to accommodate the individual right to an appropriate degree.’” Id. In applying this standard, the
Court must defer to judgments by military officers about the necessity of military conduct. See
Goldman, 475 U.S. 503 at 509-10 (refusing to consider evidence to rebut military determination that
regulation challenged under First Amendment is necessary); Larsen, slip op. at 27-28; see also
United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 681-82 & n.6 (1987) (distinctive element of Constitution’s

14

Plaintiffs argue that this Court’s decision in Larsen does not apply here, because no
denominational preference was at issue in Larsen. On the contrary, Larsen applied the standard
enunciated by the Supreme Court in Goldman, which reviewed government conduct that, in the
civilian sector, would have been subjected to strict scrutiny. Under Goldman, and as applied in
Larsen, Navy determinations related to military necessity are not subject to strict scrutiny.

treatment of military is “specificity” of “grant of power” and “insistence (evident from the number
of Clauses devoted to the subject) with which the Constitution confers authority over the [military]
upon the political branches”); Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973) (Constitution vests
“complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control
of a military force” exclusively in legislative and executive branches); Kosnik v. Peters, 31 F.
Supp.2d 151, 158 (D.D.C. 1998) (“It would be damaging to shift the decision [as to the composition,
training, equipping, and control of a military force] from trained military professionals to a nonspecialist judiciary.” (citation omitted)); cf. Orloff, 345 U.S. at 90 (commissioning of officers “is a
matter of discretion within the province of the President as Commander in Chief.”).
The Establishment Clause does not prohibit the Navy from utilizing available statutory tools
to retain chaplains on active duty where the Navy has determined that their services are necessary
to better enable the Chaplain Corps to carry out its mission. Further, plaintiffs improperly invite this
Court to review the Navy’s decisions about the necessity of service by certain officers. The Navy’s
determination that it has a shortage of certain chaplains justifying retention as authorized by statute
and regulation is not subject to judicial review. See Goldman, 475 U.S. at 509-10 (refusing to
consider evidence to rebut military determination that regulation challenged under First Amendment
is necessary); Gilligan, 413 U.S. at 10; Orloff 345 U.S. at 93; Larsen, slip op. at 27-28 (applying
Goldman and finding that in assessing Navy’s justification for chaplain accession practices, court
must “take[] the Navy at its word”).15

Plaintiffs have, in past briefing, cited Orloff for the proposition that the Judiciary may
review whether the military is authorized by statute to undertake certain conduct. See Pls.’ Mandate
Reply at 6. That is not the issue here, where the Navy is evaluating the military necessity of retaining
certain categories of officers on active duty. Determinations as to military necessity are not subject
to review by the Judiciary. Goldman, 475 U.S. at 509-10 (refusing to consider evidence to rebut

Even if the Court could accept plaintiffs’ invitation, the Navy has ample justification for
retaining these chaplains. Retention of the targeted Roman Catholic chaplains addresses an
identified shortage of chaplains and does not reflect a government intent to favor one religious view
over others. The number of Roman Catholic chaplains on active duty has steadily decreased in
recent years. Specifically, in 2002, Roman Catholic chaplains numbered 171 out of 854 total
chaplains on active duty, representing 20.02% of active-duty chaplains. See Declaration of Killian
Kagle (Ex. 7 to Defs.’ Mandate Mem.) (copy included at Ex. 19) (“Kagle Decl.”) at ¶5. By January
2007, the total number of Roman Catholic chaplains on active duty had decreased to 125 of 836
total, representing 17% of active-duty chaplains. Id. This shortage has also manifested itself in an
inability to assign Roman Catholic chaplains to some command religious programs where needed.
See Dep. of Thomas Carter (cited pages attached as Ex. 20) at 32:12-17 (shortage of Roman Catholic
and Jewish chaplains in individual commands). Thus, plaintiffs’ argument that the Navy has no
basis for determining that a shortage of Roman Catholic chaplains exists, see, e.g., Pls.’ Renewed
Mem. at 18-19 (arguing that Navy does not quantify religious needs); Pls.’ Mandate Mem. at 22
(same), is contradicted by the record.
The purpose of retaining these chaplains is the same as the purpose for retaining any other
chaplain – to accommodate religious free exercise by Navy personnel – and such a purpose is proper
under the First Amendment. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 713-14 (accommodation of religious exercise
is valid government purpose); McCreary Cty., 545 U.S. at 875 (chaplaincy example of permissible
accommodation of religion). Plaintiffs provide no reason why retention on active duty of Roman
Catholic chaplains over age 62 is any different than service of Roman Catholic clergy under age 62,

military determination that challenged regulation is necessary).

where all such chaplains are retained via statutory authority to meet the religious needs of Navy
personnel. Because the Navy retains the targeted chaplains to further the Chaplain Corps’ legitimate
mission, such retention serves a legitimate military end and does not violate the Establishment
Clause. Cf. Larsen, slip op. at 33-34 (chaplain accession policies serve legitimate military end).
Relying upon the conclusions of their expert, plaintiffs argue that there is no shortage of
Roman Catholic chaplains. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 19. This argument is based on the faulty
assumption that the only way to measure the need for chaplains is to measure overall religious
demographics and compare them to the demographics of the Chaplain Corps. Decisions as to need
and deployment of chaplains encompass multiple other factors that must also be considered. For
example, consistent with a 1987 Department of Defense report to Congress, see Dept. of Defense,
Study of Representation of Religious Faiths in the Armed Forces (originally filed as Ex. 9 to Defs.’
Cross Mot. Partial Summ. J. [CFGC docket nos. 87, 91]) (cited pages attached at Ex. 23) (“DOD
Study”) at I-6 (religious needs are not tied solely to the overall number of a denomination’s
adherents), the Navy has determined that the need for chaplains is measured against numerous
factors plaintiffs ignore, including the needs of over 500 duty stations worldwide. See, e.g., Decl.
of Rear Admiral Barry Black (originally filed as Ex. 1 to Defs.’ Cross Mot. Partial Summ. J. [CFGC
docket nos. 87, 91]) (copy attached at Ex. 24) at ¶¶3-10; DOD Study at I-6 – I-7. Because each duty
station may be expected to have religious needs from all the faith group categories, the Navy has
determined that accommodation of religious free exercise requires a large pool of chaplains from all
faith group categories, so that the Navy can better provide command religious programs with access
to a mix of chaplains from each faith group category, either by directly assigning chaplains to the
command or by assigning a mix to neighboring commands. See Decl. of Stephen Rock (originally

filed as Ex. 5 to Defs.’ Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. Decl J. and Cross Mot. Partial Summ. J. [CFGC docket
nos. 223-24]) (copy attached at Ex. 25) at ¶13.
Plaintiffs also imply that the Navy may not retain Roman Catholic chaplains unless it also
retains non-liturgical Protestant chaplains. Plaintiffs cite the stationing of chaplains at two Navy
facilities in Rota, Spain, and Naples, Italy, to imply that a shortage of non-liturgical Protestant
chaplains exists. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 23-24. On the contrary, while the numbers of Roman
Catholic chaplains have steadily decreased, the numbers of non-liturgical Protestant chaplains on
active duty have increased, reaching 39.58% in 2002 and increasing to 49.6% in January 2007.
Given the numbers of non-liturgical Protestant chaplains on active duty, the Navy may reasonably
determine that alternative methods of retention used for Roman Catholic chaplains are not necessary
to maintain a sufficient number of non-liturgicals on active duty, thereby accommodating individual
rights to an appropriate degree. Cf. Larsen, slip op. at 36-37 (current Navy chaplain accession
practices accommodate individual rights to appropriate degree).16
Plaintiffs also argue that regardless of whether there is a shortage of chaplains, the Navy may
address the shortage only by hiring civilian priests to perform Roman Catholic mass and must ignore
other statutorily-authorized remedies. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 19-20. The option to hire contract
chaplains does not require the Navy to ignore the availability of Roman Catholic chaplains where
Congress has authorized the Secretary to retain them; it is for the Navy to choose among alternatives
and decide how best to staff the Chaplain Corps. Gilligan, 413 U.S. at 10; Kosnik, 31 F. Supp.2d

16
Further, the Navy accommodated religious needs at the stations cited by deploying
chaplains to directly minister to the cited services when available, see Pls.’ Renewed Mem. Ex. 6
at ¶¶ 13, 14 (congregation previously led by chaplains), and using alternative methods when a
chaplain was unavailable. See id. (lay leader); id. at ¶ 16 (senior chaplain provides assistance).

at 158; see also Goldman, 475 U.S. at 509-10 (refusing to consider evidence and expert testimony
to rebut military determination that regulation challenged under First Amendment is necessary
because “desirability” of military regulations and conduct “is decided by the appropriate military
officials and they are under no constitutional mandate to abandon their considered professional
judgment”); Orloff, 345 U.S. at 93-94 (“[J]udges are not give the task of running the [military]).
Moreover, plaintiffs’ proposed alternative is inferior to the Navy’s retention of available and
willing military officers. Congress has determined that the religious needs of military personnel and
their dependents are best met by military officers serving as chaplains. See 10 U.S.C. § 5150
(establishing Chaplain Corps); id. § 5142 (same); see also Katcoff, 755 F.2d at 237 (detailing history
of congressional consideration and rejection of abolishing military chaplaincy in favor of civilian
chaplaincy). The use of military officers has significant advantages over the use of civilian clergy,
including the ability to rely upon officers subject to military discipline, training, and deployment.
See Katcoff, 755 F.2d at 236-37. Further, there is no evidence in the record that civilian clergy
would be available to assist with the increased shortage that would result from discharging the
targeted Roman Catholic chaplains or that the military could rely on the continued availability of
civilian clergy in the future. See id. at 236 (rejecting challenge to existence of Army chaplaincy
based upon availability of civilian clergy, in part because military could not rely upon civilian
chaplaincy without enforceable commitments from civilian churches).
Plaintiffs also do not explain why it should be constitutional to hire Roman Catholic clergy
from civilian churches, but should be unconstitutional to retain available Roman Catholic chaplains
on active duty where authorized by statute. Indeed, plaintiffs would presumably not fault the Navy
if they hired the same challenged chaplains as civilian contractors rather than retaining them on
-39-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

active duty. Absent any logical reason to conclude that the Establishment Clause prohibits the Navy
from using available military officers to meet religious needs protected by the Free Exercise Clause
but allows the Navy to use civilian clergy to meet those same needs, the decision of which method
is preferable and how best to compose the Chaplain Corps should be left to the Navy.
Plaintiffs also argue that the Navy’s actions should be subject to strict scrutiny. On the
contrary, because the Navy has retained these chaplains after determining that their service on active
duty would contribute to the Chaplain Corps’ mission, the practice is nothing like the government
conduct subjected to strict scrutiny in Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982). In Larson, the
Supreme Court applied strict scrutiny where it was faced with evidence that a state government had
singled out one religious sect for preferential treatment and another sect for disfavorable treatment
with the intent to apply onerous reporting requirements to the disfavored sect. See id. at 254. Here,
there is no credible evidence that the Navy wishes to treat Roman Catholics as a favored sect and
disfavor other denominations. Instead, as shown above, the targeted chaplains are retained by
operation of neutral standards related to the need for officers, chaplain and non-chaplain, with skills
the Navy has determined are necessary. Further, in the case of these chaplains, their retention serves
to increase the number of chaplains on active duty, thereby contributing to the Chaplain Corps’
ability to accommodate the free exercise of religion by Navy personnel. See also Berto Decl. at ¶5;
Wyvill Decl. at ¶4-7. Thus, even if strict scrutiny could apply to certain management decisions
related to the composition of the Chaplain Corps, it does not apply here – plaintiffs cannot
demonstrate that the Navy’s retention of the targeted chaplains rather than non-liturgical Protestant
chaplains is based on denominational preference rather than an accommodation of religious free
exercise by Navy personnel, given the identified need for Roman Catholic clergy to accommodate
-40-

Filed 07/25/2007

Page 51 of 56

the free exercise of religion by Navy personnel and the lack of any shortage of non-liturgical
Protestant chaplains. See Adair v. England, 217 F. Supp.2d 7, 13-14 (D.D.C. 2002) (plaintiffs bear
burden to show application of strict scrutiny by first showing a denominational preference); Adair
v. England, 183 F. Supp.2d 31, 57 n.24 (noting issue of whether plaintiffs must demonstrate that the
Navy’s conduct evidences an intentional effort to prefer one denomination over others).
In any event, retention of Roman Catholic chaplains past age 62 satisfies strict scrutiny. The
shortage of Roman Catholic chaplains and the determination that military officers serving as
chaplains contributes to the Chaplain Corps’ ability to meet religious needs satisfies any burden to
show that retention of such chaplains is narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest.
Plaintiffs’ cursory argument that the Navy is violating the Due Process Clause, see Pls.’
Renewed Mem. at 31-32, which relies upon arguments similar to their Establishment Clause claims,
fails for the reasons described above. Further, plaintiffs do not cite any of their number that was
denied retention after they reached age 62 and therefore do not show they were treated differently
than the targeted chaplains. See, supra, Part I.A. Plaintiffs’ citation to the experiences of plaintiffs
Belt and Porter-Stewart does not show differential treatment. As previously stated, see, supra, Part
I.A, unlike the chaplains targeted here, Belt and Porter-Stewart were discharged as required by
statutes not at issue in this motion, no statutory exceptions applied, and chaplains that were similarly
situated were also discharged, including liturgical Protestant and Roman Catholic chaplains. See
generally, Defs.’ Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Adair docket no. 145] at 9-10, 11-12, 15. Finally, as
described above, the retention of the targeted chaplains mitigates a growing shortage of Roman
Catholic chaplains, contributing to the Chaplain Corps’ legitimate mission, and no similar shortage
of non-liturgical chaplains exists.

Because the Navy has properly retained Roman Catholic chaplains past age 62 to meet the
religious needs of its personnel and to remedy a shortage of such chaplains, and because such
retention does not violate the Constitution, plaintiffs cannot succeed on the merits of their claim that
the retention of Roman Catholic chaplains past age 62 is unconstitutional.
III.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO SHOW THAT A MANDATORY PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WILL NOT
CAUSE HARM TO OTHER PARTIES AND WOULD SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST .
As defendants demonstrated in their original opposition, see Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 27-30,

plaintiffs also fail to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of the preliminary injunction analysis –
whether the injunction will substantially harm other parties and whether the public interest favors
the grant of a preliminary injunction. Moreover, to the extent the plaintiffs have presented any
support or justification for their position, their interest in a mandatory preliminary injunction at this
stage of the litigation does not outweigh the harm that would be inflicted on the targeted chaplains,
the Navy, and the public interest.
Defendants have demonstrated that the requested injunction would do significant harm to the
targeted chaplains, who are not parties to this case. See Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 27. Plaintiffs do not
dispute that the mandatory preliminary injunction they seek would require the Navy to separate from
active duty 12 Roman Catholic chaplains currently assisting the Chaplain Corps in serving the
religious needs of Roman Catholic personnel. See Gragg Decl. at ¶3 (listing chaplains retained on
active duty past age 62 and their denomination). Further, accepting plaintiffs’ interpretation of Title
10 and the Establishment Clause would call into question the service of chaplains from other faith
group categories who are also on active duty past age 62 and are assisting with the service of the
religious needs of other personnel. See id. (same). Plaintiffs have not provided any convincing

-42-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 7

Filed 07/25/2007

Page 53 of 56

justification for requiring the discharge of these chaplains before final resolution of the merits of
their claim, despite the harm these chaplains would suffer from such discharge.
Plaintiffs argue that the targeted chaplains have no legitimate interest in continuing their
careers because they must have acknowledged that there was no guarantee they would reach
sufficient time in service to earn a pension. See Pls.’ Renewed Mem. at 44. The Instruction upon
which plaintiffs rely merely required that the chaplains acknowledge they have no right to expect to
complete 20 years creditable service. See SECNAVINST 1120.4A ¶ 6.b (attached at Ex. 21). This
Instruction does not limit the Secretary’s ability to retain chaplains when available, nor does it
preclude the award of service credit when chaplains do serve. Whether or not these third parties had
any expectation when they began their careers, they were continued and are entitled to benefits
authorized by law. See Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 12-13.
In addition to the harm to third parties, the discharge of these chaplains would harm the
Navy’s ability to meet its personnel’s religious needs and thus would not serve the public interest.
See Defs.’ 2003 Opp. at 28-30. Plaintiffs argue that the public interest would be served by ceasing
the Navy’s “absurd and seditious” operation outside the Constitution. See, e.g., Pls.’ Renewed Mem.
at 43. Putting aside plaintiffs’ inflammatory rhetoric, the Navy’s purpose is to provide for the free
exercise needs of personnel with religious views that can be served by the targeted chaplains, not to
ignore the Constitution or to create divisiveness among its chaplains or personnel. See, supra, Part
II.C. For example, by discharging 12 Roman Catholic chaplains, the Navy’s current shortage of
Roman Catholic chaplains would worsen. Plaintiffs provide no justification for reducing the Navy’s
ability to meet Roman Catholic religious needs.
Further, Congress’s and the Navy’s interest in regulating the military would be harmed by
-43-

entry of the requested injunction, which would interfere with the “complex, subtle, and professional
decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force” delegated by
the Constitution to the legislative and executive branches. Gilligan, 413 U.S. at 10; Kosnik, 31 F.
Supp.2d at 158 (same). Courts have repeatedly stressed the importance of avoiding interference with
the internal operations of the armed forces. See, e.g., Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 681-82 & n.6 (1987)
(describing strength of constitutional delegation to political branches of authority to manage
military); Goldman, 475 U.S. at 509-10 (refusing to consider evidence and expert testimony to rebut
military determination of actions necessary in managing military); Orloff, 345 U.S. at 93-94
(“[J]udges are not given the task of running the [military]); Guerra v. Scruggs, 942 F.2d 270, 275
(4th Cir. 1991) (in discussing substantial harm to military from preliminary injunction, stating that
“second-guessing the military . . . ‘would be a disruptive force as to affairs peculiarly within the
jurisdiction of the military authorities’” (citation omitted)); Sebra, 801 F.2d at 1139 (elevated
showing of harm is necessary for preliminary injunctive relief in military cases, and harm must be
“weighed against the hardship to the military of judicial scrutiny of every military personnel
decision” (citation omitted)); Antonuk v. United States, 445 F.2d 592, 594 (6th Cir. 1971) (in
balancing harms, stating that “governmental interest in raising an army has, without exception, been
considered by the courts to be paramount . . . . Thus, the ordinary balancing tests are rendered almost
irrelevant by the transcendent importance of the war power” (citation omitted)). The public interest
is best served by allowing the Navy to exercise its considerable military judgment in determining
which officers to retain on active duty.
Finally, plaintiffs’ arguments are insufficient to justify entry of a mandatory preliminary
injunction when weighed against the interests of the targeted chaplains, the Navy, and the public

interest. See Morgan Stanley, 150 F. Supp.2d at 72-73 n.5 (where movant “makes a particularly
weak showing on any one factor, . . . “the other factors may not be enough to compensate”). Here,
plaintiffs bear a higher burden because they seek not to preserve the status quo pendente lite, but
instead to change that status quo before final resolution of their claims on the merits by requiring
discharge of the targeted chaplains and a change in the current composition of the Chaplain Corps.
Columbia Hosp. for Women Found., Inc. v. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., 15 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4
(D.D.C. 1997) (when moving for mandatory preliminary injunction, “moving party must meet a
higher standard than in the ordinary case by showing ‘clearly’ that he or she is entitled to relief or
that ‘extreme or very serious’ damage will result from the denial of the injunction”); see also Prairie
Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, 1247 & n.4 (10th Cir. 2001); Stanley v. Univ.
of S. Cal., 13 F.3d 1313, 1320 (9th Cir. 1994).
Bearing this heightened burden in mind and given the legitimate government purpose and
statutory authority outlined above, especially where the injunction requested is a mandatory
injunction that must be supported with a “clear showing” of entitlement, Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 972,
plaintiffs’ arguments on their likelihood of success do not outweigh the harm to the Navy, the
targeted chaplains, or the personnel benefitting from these chaplains’ service on active duty. See
Morgan Stanley DW Inc., 150 F. Supp.2d at 73 (if movant “makes a particularly weak showing on
one factor, . . . the other factors may not be enough to ‘compensate.’”).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein and in defendants’ original opposition, defendants request that
the Court deny plaintiffs’ motion for a mandatory preliminary injunction.

- ,signified by the designator of 4100 - over the age of 62 years currently hold the rank of
Lieutenant (0-3). Two Regular Navy chaplains over the age of 62 years hold the rank of
Lieutenant Commander (0-4). One, LCDR Antony Berchmanz, has not failed to promote to the
next higher paygrade, Commander (O-5), because he has not yet been considered for promotion.
The other, LCDR Donald Moss, has failed to promote to the next higher paygrade, Commander
(O-5), three times. However, my records indicate that LCDR Moss was recommended and
approved for continuation on active duty by a continuation board convened pursuant to 10
U.S.C. § 637 until April 1, 2010.

4. I was also asked to describe the process by which the six chaplains over the age of 62 years
and assigned the designator "4109" remain on active duty. Those chaplains were formerly
Reserve chaplains (designator "4105") serving on the Active Duty list. Under the provisions of
OPNAVINST 1820.1 (dated December 24, 2005), and before that, SECNAV1NST 1820.2B
(dated March 1, 1999) and SECNAVINST 1820.2C (dated January 25, 2005), those 4105
chaplains were released from active duty on the last day of the month and transferred to the
Retired Reserve. Then, at their request, on the first day of the next month after their transfer to
the Retired Reserve, each of them was recalled to active duty.

5. The recall of Retired Reserve chaplains described in paragraph 4 allows the Navy in general,
and the Chaplain Corps in particular, to utilize personnel with, as SECNAVINST 1820.2B,
SECNAV1NST 1820.2C, and OPNAVINST 1820.1 all state, "critical professional skills." In
this context, the six Roman Catholic chaplains currently recalled to active duty from the Retired
Reserve reflects the Chaplain Corps current shortfall of Roman Catholic chaplains to minister to

Tomlin is on active duty in the U.S, Navy.

7. I was also asked to describe the effect on the Chaplain Corps of t0 U.S.C. § 532. As a result
of that statute, all eligible Chaplain Corps officers with the designator "4105" were transferred to
the regular officer force by May 1, 2006, and their designators were changed from "4105" to
"4100."

6.3. RC Utilization Authorities
6.3.1. Enclosure 4 depicts the structure and relationships of RC duty categories for ID,
AD, and FTNGD under specific authorities. The training and support categories provide the
Secretaries concerned the flexibility of developing policies to maximize RC utilization as stated
in paragraph 6.2.
6.3.1.1. Training. All RC members shall receive training pursuant to assignments
and required readiness levels. Required training shall provide for the minimum training time or
number of training periods required for attaining the prescribed unit readiness status and
maintaining individual proficiency. The primary purpose of all training is the enhancement of
individual skills and/or unit effectiveness. Training may be conducted in ID, AD, or FTNGD
status. Mission support may be a key element in developing training programs, but training shall
be the paramount consideration and documented for budgetary allocations. Mission and
operational support may occur as a consequence of training. Required training is further
delineated in section 6.6.
6.3.1.2. Support. Voluntary Duty (AD and FTNGD) may be used to achieve desired
readiness levels and meet mission requirements.
6.3.1.3. Mobilization. Involuntary AD is used in support of military operations when
the President or the Congress determines that RC forces are required to augment the AC. It is
provided for within the provisions of sections 12301 and 12302 of Reference (g) for full and
partial mobilization, respectively, section 12304 of Reference (g) for Presidential Reserve CallUp authority, and section 712 of Reference (h) for Secretary of Homeland Security Coast Guard
Reserve call-ups for domestic emergencies. For other purposes, the Secretaries concerned may
order members involuntarily to AD pursuant to provisions of sections 12301(b) or 12303 of
Reference (g) and section 712 of Reference (h).
6.3.1.4. Other. Includes FHD, a voluntary status pursuant to the provisions of section
12503 of Reference (g) or section 115 of Reference (i), that shall be considered a special
category of ID, and MD, established in section 12319 of Reference (g). It also includes
voluntary AD for the purposes of medical evaluation and treatment pursuant to sections 12301(h)
and 12322 of Reference (g); special circumstances to include: voluntary AD at National Guard
Bureau pursuant to section 12402 of Reference (g); members ordered to AD for unsatisfactory
participation pursuant to sections 10148 and 12303 of Reference (g); RC members in a captive
status, pursuant to section 12301(g) of Reference (g); members ordered to AD for disciplinary
purposes pursuant to section 802(d) of Reference (g); and for Federal service due to insurrection
pursuant to sections 331, 332 and 12406 of Reference (g).
6.4. Assignment Restrictions Outside the United States
6.4.1. A member of the RCs shall not be assigned to AD on land outside the United
States, its territories and possessions, until the member has completed the basic training
requirements of the member's Armed Force pursuant to section 671(a) of Reference (g).

6.4.2. FTNGD shall not be performed on land outside the United States, its territories or
possessions, because a member of the RCs must be in a status provided for in Reference (g).
6.5. Placement of RC Members in RCCs and TRCs
6.5.1. The uniform reserve training and retirement categories are defined in Enclosure 6.
6.5.2. Pursuant to section 115(e) of Reference (g), each unit and member of the RCs not
counted in AD end strengths pursuant to section 115 of Reference (g) shall be placed in one of
the RCCs and TRCs identified. Individuals shall be assigned to RCCs and TRCs based on their
RC obligations to meet mission requirements and training requirements.
6.5.3. Table 1 at Enclosure 6 establishes authorized RCCs and TRCs in the RCs for
training and accountability purposes. Enclosure 5 describes those categories.
6.6. Training Participation Requirements
6.6.1. The Secretaries concerned shall establish standards for satisfactory participation at
required training periods, which shall include the number and percentages of training periods for
meeting the minimum standards, pursuant to DoD Directive 1215.13 (Reference (n)).
Individuals attending IDT periods are required to meet those minimum training standards. Those
standards shall contain procedures for accounting for absences and excused training periods, as
necessary. Individuals may voluntarily attend additional IDT periods for points, if authorized by
the Secretary concerned.
6.6.2. There is no statutory maximum annual limit on required training for members of
the National Guard.
6.6.3. To ensure that trained and qualified RC units and individuals are available for AD
throughout the entire spectrum of requirements, including war or national emergency,
contingency operations, military operations other than war, operational support, and at such other
times as the national security may require, and that funds appropriated annually for RC training
and operations are adequate for meeting these requirements, the Secretary concerned shall
establish necessary criteria and procedures to:
6.6.3.1. Approve any additional IDT as necessary and consistent with law.
Authorizing and utilizing additional training is subject to the categories, limitations, and controls
in paragraph 6.1.2.6.
6.6.3.2. Ensure that all RC members receive training according to assignments and
required readiness levels. Minimum training requirements are provided for in section 10147 of
Reference (g), section 502(a) of Reference (h), and further prescribed in paragraphs 6.1.2., 6.1.4.,
6.1.5., and 6.6.4.

6.6.3.3. Provide for training for the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), Standby
Reserve, and Retired Reserve in a voluntarily status according to the procedures described
below.
6.6.4. Training Requirements by Personnel Category
6.6.4.1. Selected Reserve
6.6.4.1.1. IDT. Except as specifically provided below, members of the Selected
Reserve, excluding AGRs, shall participate in 48 scheduled drills or training periods each year.
This requirement applies to all members of Selected Reserve units; however, the Secretary
concerned may, except in the case of the ARNGUS or the ANGUS, reallocate the number of
scheduled drills within a Reserve component where warranted to achieve readiness
requirements. The Secretary concerned may reduce the number of scheduled drills of selected
lower priority units and increase the scheduled drills of higher priority units by not more than 10
percent, rounded to the nearest whole number. The aggregate number of scheduled drills within
a component shall not be reduced by this reallocation (section 10147 of Reference (g) and
section 502 of Reference (i)). IDT requirements for individual Selected Reserve members not
assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, or IMAs, shall be determined by the organization
to which assigned and resourced by the appropriate Service component pursuant to Reference
(m).
6.6.4.1.2. AT. AT is required for all members of the Selected Reserve, excluding
AGRs. For members of the Reserves, ADT for purposes of AT shall be for not less than 14 days,
12 days for the Coast Guard Reserve, (exclusive of travel time) each year, except as provided in
paragraph 6.6.4.1.2.1. Units of the National Guard are required to perform full-time military
training for at least 15 days each year (including travel) pursuant to section 502 of Reference (i).
6.6.4.1.2.1. AT for IMAs or other Selected Reserve members not assigned to
a unit organized to serve as a unit, and in training categories ordered to AD for AT at
headquarters, support organizations, or to activities not operating on Saturday, Sunday, or
Federal holidays, normally is limited to 12 days excluding travel time (i.e., from Monday of the
first week through Friday of the second week). Such training may begin on any day of the week
to maximize training opportunities, or to support a training event or activity.
6.6.4.1.2.2. When required, members may be ordered to AT for longer
periods than those minimum periods established in paragraphs 6.6.4.1.2. and 6.6.4.1.2.1. up to a
maximum of 30 days each FY, for activities that enhance readiness or provide support to
operational missions that results from the required training. Training may begin on any day of
the week to maximize training opportunities, or support a training event or activity.
6.6.4.1.2.3. Annual training normally is performed during one consecutive
period. Split tours may be authorized for selected units or individuals, if required to meet
training missions or enhance mission support associated with required training. Any additional

costs must be fully justified. Authorization for variations in AT lengths shall be managed
pursuant to Directives established by the Secretary concerned.
6.6.4.1.3. Periods of AD or FTNGD Performed by Members of the Selected
Reserve. AD performed pursuant to sections 12301(d), 12302, 12304, and 12406 of Reference
(g), or FTNGD performed pursuant to section 502(f) of Reference (i) may not be substituted for
training required by section 10147 of Reference (g) or section 502(a) of Reference (i) and by
paragraph 6.6.4.1.2. unless in the judgment of the Secretary concerned:
6.6.4.1.3.1. AD performed pursuant to sections 12301(d), 12302, 12304, or
12406 of Reference (g) or FTNGD performed pursuant to section 502(f) is equivalent to the
training that might have been performed under the authority of section 10147 of Reference (g) or
section 502(a) of Reference (i) and paragraph 6.6.4.1.2.
6.6.4.1.3.2. AD performed pursuant to sections 12301(d), 12302, 12304, or
12406 of Reference (g) or FTNGD performed pursuant to section 502(f) when combined with
training required by section 10147 of Reference (g) or section 502(a) of Reference (i) and
paragraph 6.6.4.1.2. constitutes an undue personal hardship.
6.6.4.1.4. IADT. Initial AD training is a sub-category of ADT used to provide
basic military training and technical skill training required for all enlisted accessions. For nonprior service (NPS) persons who are qualified for induction for active duty in an Armed Force
(generally male citizens and resident aliens between the ages of 18 1/2 and 26 years of age) and
who are not under orders to report for induction under the Military Selective Service Act (50
U.S.C. App 451 et seq., Reference (o)), IADT shall be for a period as provided in section 671 of
Reference (g), to commence, insofar as practical, within 270 days after the date of enlistment
pursuant to section 12103 of Reference (g). For all other enlistees and inductees, the period of
IADT shall be prescribed by the Secretary concerned to commence, insofar as practical, within
360 days after entry into Service, except that in time of war or national emergency declared by
Congress or the President, basic training (or its equivalent) shall be for a period of not less than
12 weeks pursuant to section 671(b) of Reference (g). Periods of basic training or equivalent
training shorter than 12 weeks may also be established by the Secretary concerned for members
who have been credentialed in a medical profession or occupation and are serving in a healthcare
occupational specialty pursuant to section 671(c) of Reference (g). Enlisted members receiving
stipends under the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program (AFHPSP) for
Reserve Service are not required to participate in Ready Reserve training until they have
completed their educational training pursuant to sections 671(b), 12103, and 16201 of Reference
(g).
6.6.4.1.5. The Secretaries concerned may require members enlisted for service in
the Selected Reserve to participate in IDT periods before completing IADT. Those training
periods shall be with pay. Voluntary participation in IDT before completing IADT may be
authorized in either a pay or non-pay status.

requirements pursuant to sections 10149, 10204, 10205, 10206, 12319, and 12644 of Reference
(g). Exemptions from IRR screening during one FY are authorized for members who served on
AD during the FY; who reside outside geographical limitations established by the Secretaries
concerned or the Commandant of the Coast Guard when not operating as a Service in the Navy;
who are in the grade of O-4 or higher, and have no remaining required period of membership in
the Ready Reserve; or, who were successfully screened in the preceding FY. Under no
circumstances should a member serve an initial period in the IRR of more than 18 months
without participating in a screening either during an annual muster day, during a period of
training, or through some other means. The Secretaries concerned are required to maintain
records on the current status of each member's physical condition, dependency status, military
qualifications, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, present address, and other
necessary information to facilitate a call-up to active duty, as prescribed.
6.6.4.2.2. Members of the IRR, including individuals enlisting directly into the
IRR, may participate voluntarily in IDT, for points only, pursuant to the regulations of the
Military Services. Those IRR members participating in approved programs outside the
Department of Defense (Enclosure 7) may participate in IDT, with pay, if that pay is
reimbursable from the supported non-DoD organization to the Department of Defense.
6.6.4.2.3. Members of the RCs, not subject to mandatory training, shall be
encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis to maintain their mobilization readiness.
However, the opportunity to participate voluntarily in training, with pay, is subject to manpower
and other resource limitations as determined by the Secretary concerned.
6.6.4.2.4. Members of the ING shall muster with their assigned unit once a year
to maintain their ING status and unit affiliation. They shall not participate in any training
activities in either a pay or points only status, and are not eligible for promotion.
6.6.4.3. Standby Reserve. The Standby Reserve consists of personnel who maintain
their military affiliation without being in the Ready Reserve pursuant to sections 10141, 10150,
10151, 10152, and 10153 of Reference (g) and DoD Directive 1235.9 (Reference (p)).

"key employee" by the employer, and approved as such by the appropriate RC personnel
management office. Members shall remain in that Standby Reserve status for the period of time
they remain designated and approved as a “key employee.” Employers who designate Ready
Reserve members as “key employees” must request removal of those members from the Ready
Reserve pursuant to DoD Directive 1200.7 (Reference (q)).
6.6.4.3.2. Inactive Status List. Members of the Standby Reserve Inactive Status

courses, when transferred from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve Inactive Status List
may continue voluntary participation in the course until completion. Those personnel shall not
be entitled to pay and allowances, travel and transportation, or earn retirement points for that
training.
6.6.4.4. Retired Reserve. This category consists of all personnel transferred to the
Retired Reserve and are subject to mobilization pursuant to DoD Directive 1352.1 (Reference
(r)). Retirees may voluntarily train with organizations to which they are properly pre-assigned

UNIFORM RESERVE, TRAINING, AND RETIREMENT CATEGORIES
E5.1. RESERVE COMPONENT CATEGORIES (RCCs)
Categories identifying an individual's status in a RC. There are three RCCs: The Ready
Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. Each member of the National Guard and
Reserve is assigned within one of those categories. (All National Guard members, including
those in the ING, are in the Ready Reserve.)
E5.1.1. Ready Reserve Categories. The Ready Reserve is comprised of military members of
the Reserve and National Guard, organized in units or as individuals, or both, and liable for
involuntary order to AD in time of war or national emergency pursuant to sections 12301 and
12302 of Reference (g) and section 712 of Reference (h) in the case of members of the Coast
Guard Reserve. The Ready Reserve consists of three sub-categories: the Selected Reserve, the
IRR, and the ING.
E5.1.1.1. Selected Reserve. The Selected Reserve consists of those units and individuals
in the Ready Reserve designated by their respective Service, and approved by the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have priority over all
other Reserves. All Selected Reservists are in an active status. They are trained as prescribed in
section 10147(a)(1) of Reference (g) or section 502(a) of Reference (i), as appropriate. In
addition to the involuntary call up authorities set out in the previous paragraph, members of the
Selected Reserve may also be involuntarily called to AD to augment the active forces for any
operational mission pursuant to section 12304 of Reference (g). The Selected Reserve includes
the following:
E5.1.1.1.1. Selected Reserve Units. Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train
either as operational or as augmentation units. Operational units train and serve as units.
Augmentation units train together, but when mobilized, lose their unit identity and become part
of an AC unit or activity. Selected Reserve units include:
E5.1.1.1.1.1. Drilling Unit Reservists. Trained unit members participating in unit
training activities on a part-time basis shall have the RCC and TRC designator of "SA."
E5.1.1.1.1.2. Unit Full-Time Support (FTS) Personnel
E5.1.1.1.1.2.1. AGR. National Guard or Reserve members of the Selected
Reserve serving on AGR duty assigned or attached to Selected Reserve units (to include fulltime National Guard duty), as defined in section 101 of Reference (g), for the purposes of
organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the RCs, who may also perform
other duties as prescribed in section 12310 of Reference (g). All such AGR members must be
assigned against, or attached to, an authorized mobilization position in the unit they support.
They shall have the RCC and TRC designator of "SG."

E5.1.1.1.1.2.2. Military Technician (Dual Status) (MT). A civilian employee
of the Military Department concerned who is required, as a condition of civilian employment, to
maintain military membership in a Reserve component and who is assigned to a position as a
technician in the administration and training of such Reserve component, or in the maintenance
and repair of supplies or equipment issued to such Reserve component. The military and civilian
position skills of MTs must be compatible. MTs are not accounted for separately in RCC/TRC
categories. Accordingly, these MTs are accounted for in Reserve end strengths as Drilling Unit
Reservists (E5.1.1.1.1. of this Enclosure), and, as such, are accountable under the TRC
designator of "SA." NOTE: There are certain technicians providing unit FTS who are not
required to maintain military membership (i.e., non-dual status technicians) and others who are
not required to hold compatible military and civilian positions.
E5.1.1.1.1.2.3. Non-Dual Status Technician (NDST). NDSTs are not
accounted for in RCC/TRC categories. A civilian employee employed as a technician before
November 18, 1997, pursuant to any of the authorities specified in section 10217(b) of Reference
(g) and is not a member of the Selected Reserve or after that date has ceased to be a member of
the Selected Reserve or is employed pursuant to section 709 of Reference (i) in a position
designated pursuant to subsection (c) of that section and when hired was not required to maintain
membership in the Selected Reserve. NDST shall encumber only those technician positions
identified by the Secretary concerned as NDST positions.
E5.1.1.1.1.2.4. AC. AC personnel are not accounted for in RCC/TRC
categories. Members of the active forces of the Military Services, paid from AC military
personnel appropriations, assigned or attached to National Guard or Reserve units to provide
advice, liaison, management, administration, training, and/or maintenance support in the
category of FTS pursuant to section 12501 of Reference (g). These members are not part of the
Selected Reserve, but may deploy with their assigned unit, should it mobilize. AC members
performing FTS are counted as part of trained strength in units, but not in the Selected Reserve
strengths.
E5.1.1.1.1.2.5. Civil Service Employees (CIV). CIVs are not accounted for
in RCC/TRC categories. Such personnel are hired pursuant to section 3101 of 5 U.S.C.
(Reference (u)) to provide administrative support to RC units. They are in the category of FTS
to the RCs, but are not part of the Selected Reserve. This category is exclusive of dual-status
MTs and NDSTs.
E5.1.1.1.2. Full-Time Members (Special Category). Trained Selected Reserve
members who are performing AD or FTNGD for more than 180 days in a fiscal year, but who
are exempted from counting against the AD strengths pursuant to section 101(d)(6)(B)(ii) and

support mobilization (pre- and/or post-mobilization) requirements, contingency operations,
operations other than war, or other specialized or technical requirements. IMAs participate in
training activities on a part-time basis with an AC unit or SSS preparing for active service, as
required. The amount of training required may vary from 0 to 48 IDT periods per year. All
IMAs must perform a minimum of 12 days of AT each year. They have the RCC and TRC
designator of "TB."
E5.1.1.1.4. Training Pipeline. An RCC designation "U" that identifies Selected
Reserve enlisted members who have not yet completed IADT as provided in section 671 of
Reference (g) and officers who are in training for professional categories or in undergraduate
flying training. Pursuant to section 671 of Reference (g), all Ready Reservists shall receive
training commensurate with their intended wartime assignments, and must complete the basic
training requirements of the member's Service before assignment on land outside the United
States, its territories or possessions. The training pipeline is synonymous with the term "nondeployable account." Personnel in the training pipeline may be mobilized, but may not always
be available for deployment with their units. If otherwise eligible for mobilization and
deployment, they shall be considered as mobilization assets. Training pipeline personnel are
accounted for separately in the following training categories:
E5.1.1.1.4.1. Members Currently on IADT. Includes the second part of split
IADT for enlisted members, which has the RCC and TRC designator of "UF."

E5.1.1.1.4.3. Members Awaiting IADT Authorized to Perform IDT. Those
members in the Selected Reserve serving with pay. Service performed by members while in that
status is creditable toward computation of basic pay. Members in this category shall have the
RCC TRC designator of "UP." This category also includes National Guard members awaiting
IADT and not authorized to perform IDT. See paragraph 6.6.4.1.4. for specific criteria regarding
this category.
E5.1.1.1.4.4. Other Selected Reserve Untrained Personnel in Training Programs.

E5.1.1.1.5. AGR not in Selected Reserve Units. National Guard or Reserve members
of the Selected Reserve, serving on AGR duty (to include full-time National Guard duty) as
defined in Chapter 1 of Reference (g), and Coast Guard Reserve AGRs, but who are not assigned
or attached to Selected Reserve units. They occupy positions in organizations, other than
Selected Reserve units, for the purposes of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or

not accounted for in RCC/TRC categories. Such personnel hired under section 3101 of
Reference (u) to provide administrative support to the RCs. They are in the category of FTS to
the RCs, but are not part of the Selected Reserve.
E5.1.1.2. IRR The IRR consists of Reservists in the following categories:
E5.1.1.2.1. IRR is a manpower pool comprised principally of individuals who have
had training, have previously served in the AC or in the Selected Reserve, and have some period
of their military service obligation (MSO) or other contractual obligation remaining. Some
individuals volunteer to remain in the IRR beyond their MSO or contractual obligation and
participate in programs providing a variety of professional assignments and opportunities for
earning retirement points and military benefits. Members may voluntarily participate in training
for retirement points and promotion, with or without pay. IRR members are not required to meet
the same AT and IDT training requirements as Selected Reserve members. Exceptions to this
training requirement restriction shall be approved by the USD(P&R). Required training
(involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a year pursuant to section 10147 of Reference (g). IRR
members may be required to perform MD as described in paragraph 6.6.4.2.1. of the main body
of this Instruction. Trained members of the IRR have the RCC and TRC designator of "RE,"
with the exception of those members in the category described in paragraph E5.1.1.2.2.
E5.1.1.2.2. Within the IRR there is a category of members, as designated by the
Secretary concerned, who have volunteered to be called to AD pursuant to the provisions of
section 12304 of Reference (g) when needed. This category of the IRR is provided for in section
10144(b) of Reference (g). Members in this mobilization category shall be eligible for benefits
(other than pay and training) as normally available to members of the Selected Reserve, as
determined by the Secretary of Defense. IRR members in this category have the RCC and TRC
designator of "RM."
E5.1.1.2.3. The IRR also includes some personnel participating in officer training
programs or in the Armed Forces Health Professional Scholarship Program (AFHPSP). The
RCC and TRC designator "PJ" is used for officers not in the Selected Reserve but participating
in officer training programs. Included within this category are cadets of the Merchant Marine
Academy. The RCC and TRC designator "PK" is used for officers not in the Selected Reserve,
but participating in the AFHPSP. Members in that stipend program are required to perform 45
days of AD for training a year pursuant to section 2121(c) of Reference (g).

E5.1.1.2.4. The IRR also includes enlisted members awaiting IADT (except for
members of the National Guard), who are not authorized to perform IDT. These members are
assigned to units and are serving without pay. Service performed by members in that status is
not creditable toward computation of basic pay and shall have the RCC and TRC designator of
"RU." NPS enlistees between the ages of 18 1/2 and 26 years enlisting pursuant to section 12103
of Reference (g) shall commence IADT, insofar as practicable, within 270 days after the date of
that enlistment. All other enlisted members shall perform IADT, insofar as practicable, within
360 days of their enlistment.
E5.1.1.2.5. The IRR also includes members of the Delayed Entry Program enlisted
pursuant to section 513 of Reference (g). Currently, there is no requirement to account for those
untrained members of the IRR in the RCCPDS. However, these IRR members may be coded
with the RCC and TRC designator of "RH."
E5.1.1.3. ING. The ING consists of National Guard personnel in an inactive status in the
Ready Reserve, not in the Selected Reserve, attached to a specific National Guard unit. To
remain ING members, members must muster once a year with their assigned unit, but they do not
participate in training activities. On mobilization, ING members may mobilize with their units.
Similar to IRR members, some ING members have legal and contractual obligations. ING
members may not train for points or pay and are not eligible for promotion. Currently, the ING
category is used only by the ARNG and has the RCC and TRC designator of "II."
E5.1.2. Standby Reserve Categories. The Standby Reserve consists of those units or
members, or both, of the Reserve components, other than those in the Ready Reserve or Retired
Reserve, who are liable for active duty only as provided for in sections 12301 and 12306 of
Reference (g). The Standby Reserve consists of personnel who are maintaining their military
affiliation without being in the Ready Reserve, but have been designated key civilian employees,
or have a temporary hardship or disability. Those individuals are not required to perform
training and are not part of units. The Standby Reserve is a pool of trained individuals who may
be mobilized as needed to fill manpower needs in specific skills. The Standby Reserve consists
of the active status list and the inactive status list categories.
E5.1.2.1. Active Status List. The following members of the Standby Reserve are in an
active status:
E5.1.2.1.1. Members designated as key employees pursuant to Reference (q) and
transferred from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve Active Status List for the period they
remain designated as a key employee. Key employees may participate voluntarily without pay in
RC training for retirement points only and may be considered for promotion. This voluntary
training shall not be performed in an imminent danger area. While there is no statutory
prohibition against paying active status Standby Reservists for IDT or AD, members of the
Standby Reserve who have been screened out of the Ready Reserve as key employees shall not
be paid for training. They have the RCC and TRC designator of "YC."

MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN APPROVED PROGRAMS
OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

E7.1. SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM (SSS)
E7.1.1. The SSS administers the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) (Reference (o)).
The MSSA authorizes the Director of Selective Service, by delegation from the President, "...to
order to active duty with their consent and to assign to the Selective Service System such officers
of the selective-service section of the state headquarters and headquarters detachments and such
other officers of the federally recognized National Guard of the United States or other armed
forces personnel (including personnel of the reserve components thereof), as may be necessary
for the administration of the national and of the several state headquarters of the Selective
Service System."
E7.1.2. The Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of Selective Service shall
agree on the number of RC members assigned as IMAs to the SSS. The SSS shall reimburse the
Department of Defense for total personnel costs for IDT and AT for those members.
E7.1.3. Additionally, agreements between the Department of Defense and the Office of the
Director of Selective Service may provide for the use of IRR members of the RCs in an IDT or
AD status; with or without pay. The SSS shall reimburse the Department of Defense for all
associated costs, including IDT and AT pay, for those members.
E7.1.4. Request for assignment to the SSS in a full-time AD status must be approved
pursuant to DoD Directive 1000.17 (Reference (v)). Costs for those members shall be
reimbursed to the Department of Defense. Members shall not be assigned to a RCC or TRC,
shall not be counted against RC strengths, and shall not be included in the RCCPDS files.

E7.2. NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS
E7.2.1. The National Emergency Preparedness Program (all hazards) is an integral part of
U.S. national security. Support of emergency preparedness may be provided through RC
members participating with Federal, State, and local civil agencies only when clearly furthering
specifically identifiable DoD interests. Participation shall be in an IDT, ADT, or FTNGD
status. The primary basis for RC participation is to meet DoD program requirements and
therefore costs of the program are paid by the DoD Component, except when the RC members
are supporting a presidentially declared emergency or disaster. In those cases, costs are usually
on a reimbursable basis from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Subject to
priorities and guidance in DoD 3025.1 (Reference (w)), military support of those activities is a
proper mission for DoD Components. Military planning and liaison may be provided by RC

members at selected civil government and military headquarters, and includes such tasks and
responsibilities as military support to civil authorities for CONUS defense, coordinating DoD
response to domestic emergencies, and physical security of key assets.
E7.2.2. Assigning Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers (EPLOs) in a full-time AD
(other than for training) or FTNGD status in support of Emergency Preparedness Programs
outside the Department of Defense must be approved pursuant to Reference (v). The following
programs are approved for such participation:
E7.2.2.1. Federal EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between DoD Components and Federal Agencies, including interface with the
civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the Military Service planning agent.
Federal EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions. All costs are paid by the DoD
Component. Each Military Department is authorized to assign one or more Federal EPLOs
(below flag or general officer rank) at FEMA national headquarters, at the DoD Director of
Military Support, and at military headquarters that serve as the DoD, Military Service, or
Regional Planning Agents for domestic emergency support. Federal EPLOs:
E7.2.2.1.1. Provide DoD and Service liaison with Federal Agencies and
organizations, and between the Military Services.
E7.2.2.1.2. Facilitate planning, coordination, and training for military support to civil
authorities and national security emergency preparedness.
E7.2.2.1.3. Advise Federal Agencies and organizations on DoD and Service
capabilities and resources.
E7.2.2.1.4. Advocate mutual support required by the Department of Defense.
E7.2.2.1.5. On order, augment DoD response to domestic emergency operations.
E7.2.2.2. Regional EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between DoD Components and Federal regional headquarters, including interface
with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the Military Service planning
agent. Regional EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions. All costs are paid by the
DoD Component. Each Military Department is authorized to assign one or more EPLOs (below
flag or general officer rank) at each FEMA region and at military headquarters and locations
with key functions as Department of Defense, Military Service, and Regional Planning Agents
for domestic emergency support. Regional EPLOs perform the same functions described in
paragraphs E7.2.2.1.1. through E7.2.2.1.5. only at the regional level.
E7.2.2.3. State EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison responsibilities
between their DoD Components and State or U.S. Territory emergency service headquarters
including interface with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the
Military Service planning agent. State EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions.

All costs are paid by the DoD Component. Each Military Department is authorized to assign one
or more EPLOs (below flag or general officer rank) at each State or U.S. territorial headquarters
and shall assign such officers to functions supervised by the State Area Command. State EPLOs
provide Service representation and liaison to the military and civil authorities within the State,
commonwealth, U.S. possession, and other eligible jurisdiction. State EPLOs perform the same
functions described in paragraphs E7.2.2.1.1. through E7.2.2.1.5. only at the State level.
E7.2.3. All EPLOs should attend the DoD Emergency Preparedness Course presented at the
FEMA Mount Weather Emergency Assistance Center as soon as possible after assignment. This
will help to ensure that DoD representatives performing these vital functions are properly trained
in this complex environment.

E7.3. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE
Members of the IRR may participate voluntarily in programs outside the Department of Defense
in an AD or IDT status, with pay or without pay. Any pay provided shall be reimbursed to the
Department of Defense by the supported Agency. Members of the Standby Reserve on the
Active Status List may voluntarily participate, without pay, in approved civil defense activities
and receive retirement points pursuant to Reference (k).
E7.4. IRR MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN DEFENSE SUPPORT TO CIVIL

IRR members participating in Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) training activities
may request ADT to attend DSCA courses. If so ordered, those Reservists shall be entitled to
pay and allowances including travel allowances for such training.

for induction under the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App 451 et seq.,
reference (m)), IADT shall be for a period of not less than 12 weeks, to commence,
insofar as practical, within 270 days after the date of enlistment in accordance with 10
U.S.C. 12103 (reference (e)). For all other enlistees and inductees, the period of IADT
shall be prescribed by the Secretary concerned to commence, insofar as practical, within

medical profession or occupation and are serving in a healthcare occupational specialty
in accordance with Section 671(c) of reference (e). Enlisted members receiving
stipends under the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program (AFHPSP)
for Reserve Service are not required to participate in Ready Reserve training until they
have completed their educational training in accordance with Sections 671(b), 12103,
and 16201 of reference (e).
6.5.4.1.5. The Secretaries concerned may require members enlisted
for service in the Selected Reserve to participate in IDT periods before completing
IADT. Those training periods shall be with pay. Voluntary participation in IDT before
completing IADT may be authorized in either a pay or non-pay status.

period of training, or through some other means. The Services are required to maintain
records on the current status of each member's physical condition, dependency status,
military qualifications, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, present
address, and other necessary information to facilitate a call-up to active duty, as
prescribed.
6.5.4.2.2. Members of the IRR, including individuals enlisting
directly into the IRR, may participate voluntarily in IDT, for points only, in accordance
with the regulations of the Military Services. Those IRR members participating in
approved programs outside the Department of Defense (enclosure 3) may participate in
IDT, with pay, if that pay is reimbursable from the supported non-DoD organization to
the Department of Defense.
6.5.4.2.3. Members of the ING shall muster with their assigned unit

Reserve. This category is exclusive of dual-status MTs and NDSTs.
E2.2.1.1.5. Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs). Individual
members of the Selected Reserve assigned to an RC billet in an AC or non-DoD
organization. They are trained individuals pre-assigned to an AC or a Selected Service
System (SSS) billet that must be filled to support mobilization (pre and/or post
mobilization) requirements, contingency operations, operations other than war, or other
specialized or technical requirements. IMAs participate in training activities on a
part-time basis with an AC unit or SSS preparing for active service, as required. The
amount of training required is determined by DoD policy and may vary from 0 to 48 IDT
periods per year. All IMAs must perform a minimum of 12 days of AT each year.
They have the RCC and TRC designator of "TB."
E2.2.1.1.6. Training Pipeline. An RCC designation "U" that identifies
Selected Reserve enlisted members who have not yet completed IADT of 12 weeks, or
its equivalent, and officers who are in training for professional categories or in
undergraduate flying training. In accordance with Section 671 of reference (e), all
Ready Reservists shall receive training commensurate with their intended wartime
assignments, and must complete the basic training requirements of the member's
Service before assignment on land outside the United States, its territories or
possessions. The training pipeline is synonymous with the term "non-deployable
account." Personnel in the training pipeline may be mobilized, but may not always be
available for deployment with their units. It is DoD policy that, if otherwise eligible
for mobilization and deployment, they shall be considered as mobilization assets.
Training pipeline personnel are accounted for separately in the following training
categories:

E2.2.1.1.8. Civil Service Employees (CIV) not in Selected Reserve Units.
CIVs are not accounted for in RCC/TRC categories. Such personnel hired under 5
U.S.C. 3101 and 32 U.S.C. 709 (references (r) and (i)) to provide administrative support
to the RCs. They are in the category of FTS to the RCs, but are not part of the Selected
Reserve.
E2.2.1.2. IRR and ING. The IRR/ING consists of Reservists in the following
categories:
E2.2.1.2.1. IRR is a manpower pool comprised principally of individuals
who have had training, have previously served in the AC or in the Selected Reserve, and
have some period of their MSO or other contractual obligation remaining. Some
individuals volunteer to remain in the IRR beyond their Military Service obligation or
contractual obligation and participate in programs providing a variety of professional
assignments and opportunities for earning retirement points and military benefits.
Members may voluntarily participate in training for retirement points and promotion,
with or without pay. IRR members shall not be required to meet the same AT and IDT
training requirements as Selected Reservists. Exceptions to this training requirement
restriction shall be approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness. Required training (involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a year under
Section 10147 of reference (e). IRR members may be required to perform MD as
described in subparagraph 6.5.4.2.1. of the main body of this Instruction. Trained
members of the IRR have the RCC and TRC designator of "RE," with the exception of
those members in the category described in subparagraph E2.2.1.2.2., below.
E2.2.1.2.2. Within the IRR there is a category of members, as designated
by the Secretary concerned, who have volunteered to be called to AD under the
provisions of 10 U.S.C. 12304 (reference (e)) when needed. This category of the IRR
is provided for in Section 10144(b) of reference (e). Members in this mobilization
category shall be eligible for benefits (other than pay and training) as normally available
to members of the Selected Reserve, as determined by the Secretary of Defense. IRR
members in this category have the RCC and TRC designator of "RM."
E2.2.1.2.3. The IRR also includes some personnel participating in officer
training programs or in the AFHPSP. The RCC and TRC designator "PJ" is used for
officers not in the Selected Reserve but participating in officer training programs.
Included within this category are cadets of the Merchant Marine Academy. The RCC
and TRC designator "PK" is used for officers not in the Selected Reserve, but
participating in the AFHPSP. Members in that stipend program are required to perform
45 days of AD for training a year in accordance with Section 2121(c) of reference (e).

E2.2.1.2.4. The IRR also includes enlisted members awaiting IADT
(except for members of the National Guard), who are not authorized to perform IDT.
These members are assigned to units and are serving without pay. Service performed by
members in that status is not creditable toward computation of basic pay and shall have
the RCC and TRC designator of "RU." NPS enlistees between the ages of 18 1/2 and
26 years enlisting under Section 12103 of reference (e) shall enter IADT, insofar as
practicable, within 270 days after the date of that enlistment. All other enlisted
members shall perform IADT, insofar as practicable, within 360 days of their enlistment.
E2.2.1.2.5. The IRR also includes members of the Delayed Entry
Program enlisted under Section 513 of reference (e). Currently, there is no
requirement to account for those untrained members of the IRR in the RCCPDS.
However, these IRR members may be coded with the RCC and TRC designator of "RH."
E2.2.1.2.6. The ING consists of National Guard personnel in an inactive
status in the Ready Reserve, not in the Selected Reserve, attached to a specific National
Guard unit. To remain ING members, members must muster once a year with their
assigned unit, but they do not participate in training activities. On mobilization, ING
members may mobilize with their units. Similar to other IRR, some ING members have
legal and contractual obligations. ING members may not train for points or pay and are
not eligible for promotion. Currently, the ING category is used only by the ARNG and
has the RCC and TRC designator of "II."
E2.2.1.3. STANDBY RESERVE CATEGORIES. The Standby Reserve consists
of those units or members, or both, of the Reserve components, other than those in the
Ready Reserve or Retired Reserve, who are liable for active duty only as provided for in
Sections 12301 and 12306 of reference (e). The Standby Reserve consists of
personnel who are maintaining their military affiliation without being in the Ready
Reserve, but have been designated key civilian employees, or have a temporary hardship
or disability. Those individuals are not required to perform training and are not part of
units. The Standby Reserve is a pool of trained individuals who may be mobilized as
needed to fill manpower needs in specific skills. The Standby Reserve consists of the
active status list and the inactive status list categories.
E2.2.1.3.1. Active Status List. The following members of the Standby
Reserve are in an active status:
E2.2.1.3.1.1. Members designated as key employees in accordance
with DoD Directive 1200.7 (reference (q)) and transferred from the Ready Reserve to
the Standby Reserve Active Status List for the period they remain designated as key

personnel. Key employees may participate voluntarily without pay in RC training for
retirement points only and may be considered for promotion. While there is no
statutory prohibition against paying active status Standby Reservists for IDT or AD, by
DoD policy members of the Standby Reserve who have been screened out of the Ready
Reserve as key employees may not be paid for training. They have the RCC and TRC
designator of "YC."
E2.2.1.3.1.2. Personnel not having fulfilled their statutory MSO, or
temporarily assigned for a hardship reason intending to return to the Ready Reserve, or
retained by an RC in an active status under 10 U.S.C. 12646 (reference (e)). These
members may participate voluntarily with or without pay and may receive credit for, and
be considered for, promotion. They have the RCC and TRC designator of "YD."
E2.2.1.3.2. Inactive Status List. Members in the Standby Reserve who
are not required to remain in an active program, but who retain Reserve affiliation in a
non-participating status and whose skill may be of future use to the Armed Force
concerned. These members cannot participate in prescribed training. While in an
inactive status, Reserve members are not eligible for pay or promotion and do not
accrue credit for years of service in accordance with provisions of Chapter 1223 of
reference (e).
E2.2.1.3.2.1. Members transferred to the Standby Reserve Inactive
Status List under Section 1209 of reference (e) instead of separating. They have the
RCC TRC designator of "YL."
E2.2.1.3.2.2. All other members transferred to the Standby Reserve
Inactive Status List in accordance with DoD Directive 1235.9 (reference (n)). They
have the RCC TRC designator of "YN."
E2.2.1.4. RETIRED RESERVE CATEGORIES
E2.2.1.4.1. All Reserve personnel transferred to the Retired Reserve.
Retired Reservists voluntarily may train, with or without pay. The Retired Reserve
consists of the following retired categories:
E2.2.1.4.1.1. Reserve members who have completed the requisite
qualifying years creditable for non-regular retired pay and are receiving retired pay (at,
or after, age 60) under Chapter 1223 of reference (e). Those members shall be
assigned the RCC and TRC designator of "V1."

or are age 60 and have not applied for non-regular retirement pay. Those members
shall be assigned the RCC and TRC designator of "V2."
E2.2.1.4.1.3. Reserve members retired for physical disability under
10 U.S.C. 1201, 1202, 1204, or 1205 (reference (e)). Members have completed 20
years of service creditable for regular retired pay, or are 30-percent or more disabled
and otherwise qualified under Section 1201 of reference (e). These members shall be
assigned the RCC and TRC designator of "V3."
E2.2.1.4.1.4. Reserve members who have completed the requisite
years of active service and are receiving regular retired or retainer pay. These
personnel shall be assigned the RCC and TRC designator of "V4." Regular (not RC)
enlisted personnel of the Navy and the Marine Corps with 20 to 30 years of active
Military Service who are transferred to the Fleet Naval Reserve or the Fleet Marine
Corps Reserve on retirement, until they have completed 30 years of total active and
retired or retainer service, are NOT included in that category.
E2.2.1.4.1.5. Reserve personnel drawing retired pay under other than
age, service requirements, or physical disability. This category is restricted for
retirement under special conditions, as authorized by the Office of the Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs under legislation. These personnel shall be
assigned the RCC and TRC designator of "V5." Also included in this RCC and TRC will
be Voluntary Separation Incentive recipients who become ineligible for retention in an
active or inactive status in a Reserve component because of age, years of service,
failure to select for promotion, or medical disability, and who request to be placed in
this category. These individuals shall be tracked separately by the appropriate Reserve
personnel management office.
E2.2.1.4.2. All members retired for having completed the requisite years
of active duty service (Regular or Reserve), regardless of the retired list where
assigned, may be ordered to AD when required by the Secretary of the Military
Department concerned, in accordance with Section 688 of (reference (e)).
E2.2.1.4.3. Retired Reserve members may be ordered to AD in their
status as Retired Reserve members. It is not necessary to place the member in the
Ready Reserve for that purpose.
E2.2.1.4.4. Former members having completed 20 satisfactory years of
service creditable for non-regular retirement, but electing to be discharged from the
RCs, are not a part of the Retired Reserve and have no military status.

E3. ENCLOSURE 3
MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN APPROVED PROGRAMS
OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
E3.1. SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM (SSS)
E31.1.1 The SSS administers the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA)
(reference (m)). The MSSA authorizes the Director of Selective Service, by delegation
from the President, "...to order to active duty with their consent and to assign to the
Selective Service System such officers of the selective-service section of the state
headquarters and headquarters detachments and such other officers of the federally
recognized National Guard of the United States or other armed forces personnel
(including personnel of the reserve components thereof), as may be necessary for the
administration of the national and of the several state headquarters of the Selective
Service System."
E3.1.2. The Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of Selective
Service shall agree on the number of RC members assigned as IMAs to the SSS. The
SSS shall reimburse the Department of Defense for total personnel costs for IDT and
AT for those members.
E3.1.3. Additionally, agreements between the Department of Defense and the
Office of the Director of Selective Service may provide for the use of IRR members of
the RCs in an IDT or AD status, in a pay or non-pay status. The SSS shall reimburse the
Department of Defense for all associated costs, including IDT and AT pay, for those
members.
E3.1.4. Request for assignment to the SSS in a full-time AD status must be
approved in accordance with DoD Directive 1000.17 (reference (s)). Costs for those
members shall be reimbursed to the Department of Defense. Members shall not be
assigned to a RCC or TRC, shall not be counted against RC strengths, and shall not be
included in the RCCPDS files.
E3.2. NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS
E3.2.1. The National Emergency Preparedness Program (all hazards) is an integral
part of U.S. national security. Support of emergency preparedness may be provided
through RC members participating with Federal, State, and local civil agencies only when
clearly furthering specifically identifiable DoD interests. Participation shall be in an

IDT, ADT, or FTNGD status. The primary basis for RC participation is to meet DoD
program requirements and therefore costs of the program are paid by the DoD
Component, except when the RC members are supporting a presidentially declared
emergency or disaster. In those cases, costs are usually on a reimbursable basis from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Subject to priorities and
guidance in DoD 3025.1 (reference (t)), military support of those activities is a proper
mission for DoD Components. Military planning and liaison may be provided by RC
members at selected civil government and military headquarters, and includes such tasks
and responsibilities as military support to civil authorities for CONUS defense,
coordinating DoD response to domestic emergencies, and physical security of key
assets.
E3.2.2. Assigning Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers (EPLOs) in a
full-time AD (other than for training) or FTNGD status in support of Emergency
Preparedness Programs outside the Department of Defense must be approved in
accordance with DoD Directive 1000.17 (reference (s)). The following programs are
approved for such participation:
E3.2.2.1. Federal EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between DoD Components and Federal Agencies, including interface
with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the Military Service
planning agent. Federal EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions. All
costs are paid by the DoD Component. Each Military Department is authorized to
assign one or more Federal EPLOs (other than flag or general officer rank) at FEMA
national headquarters, at the DoD Director of Military Support, and at military
headquarters that serve as the DoD, Military Service, or Regional Planning Agents for
domestic emergency support. Federal EPLOs:
E3.2.2.1.1. Provide DoD and Service liaison with Federal organizations
and Agencies, and between the Military Services.
E3.2.2.1.2. Facilitate planning, coordination, and training for military
support to civil authorities and national security emergency preparedness.
E3.2.2.1.3. Advise Federal Agencies and organizations on DoD and
Service capabilities and resources.
E3.2.2.1.4. Advocate mutual support required by the Department of
Defense.

E3.2.2.2. Regional EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between DoD Components and Federal regional headquarters, including
interface with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the Military
Service planning agent. Regional EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD
missions. All costs are paid by the DoD Component. Each Military Department is
authorized to assign one or more EPLOs (below flag or general officer rank) at each
FEMA region and at military headquarters and locations with key functions as
Department of Defense, Military Service, and Regional Planning Agents for domestic
emergency support. Regional EPLOs perform the same functions described in
subparagraphs E3.2.2.1.1. through E3.2.2.1.5., above, only at the regional level.
E3.2.2.3. State EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between their DoD Components and State or U.S. Territory emergency
service headquarters including interface with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD
Component through the Military Service planning agent. State EPLOs function
primarily in support of DoD missions. All costs are paid by the DoD Component.
Each Military Department is authorized to assign one or more EPLOs (other than flag
or general officer rank) at each State or U.S. territorial headquarters and shall assign
such officers to functions supervised by the State Area Command. State EPLOs
provide Service representation and liaison to the military and civil authorities within the
State, commonwealth, U.S. possession, and other eligible jurisdiction. State EPLOs
perform the same functions described in subparagraphs E3.2.2.1.1. through E3.2.2.1.5.,
above, only at the State level.
E3.2.3. All EPLOs should attend the DoD Emergency Preparedness Course
presented at the FEMA Mount Weather Emergency Assistance Center as soon as
possible after assignment. This will help to ensure that DoD representatives
performing these vital functions are properly trained in this complex environment.

Armed Forces who is entitled to retired, retirement, or retainer pay.
3.2. Position. A civilian office or position (including a temporary, part-time, or

(OPM)) to be filled, with or without compensation, under appointment or personal
service contract from appropriated or nonappropriated funds, provided an employeremployee relationship exists.
3.3. Category A Positions. All wage system positions paid from appropriated

DODD 1402.1, January 21, 1982
4.2. General Policies
4.2.1. The basic objective in filling positions in the Department of Defense is
to ensure the appointment of fully qualified employees, generally the "best qualified"
under consideration, consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3326 (reference (b)).
4.2.2. Retired members of the Armed Forces have a right to seek and to be
considered for Federal civilian employment. Such consideration shall be extended
equitably and in compliance with the merit system principle of open competition to avoid
both the practice and appearance of preferential treatment. This is essential not only in
the interests of the public and of career employees, but to protect retired members from
unwarranted allegations that they obtained their positions through influence based upon
prior military service.
4.2.3. The following principles shall be observed before employing retired
members of the Armed Forces.
4.2.3.1. Full consideration shall be given, in accordance with in-service
placement and promotion procedures (including procedures negotiated under the Federal
Service Labor Management Relations Statute (Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act
of 1978, reference (d)), to eligible and qualified DoD civilian employees.
4.2.3.2. When appointment is in the competitive civil service and
selection is from an established civil service register, retired members of the Armed
Forces shall be accorded treatment consistent with regulations issued by the OPM.
4.2.3.3. When the selection for appointment, whether in or outside the
competitive civil service, is other than from an established civil service register,
recruitment for the position shall be conducted in a way that ensures reasonable efforts
are made to obtain applicants from all possible sources to avoid any suspicion of attempts
to unduly limit competition.
4.2.3.3.1. This requires that the vacancy be well publicized; that
recruitment be conducted over a sufficient period of time to give all interested candidates
an opportunity to apply; and that qualification requirements for the position be written in
a manner that does not give an advantage to a particular person.
4.2.3.3.2. When selecting a retired member, it must be established
that the member is better qualified than any in-service candidate. This requirement does
not necessitate special recruitment efforts or delays in selections for shortage category
positions for which OPM has authorized advanced re-hiring rates.
4.2.3.3.4. Positions may not be held open pending the retirement of a
member of the Armed Forces in order to provide that person with a preferential
opportunity to apply for or be appointed to the position. Active recruitment shall be

initiated when the position becomes vacant, unless suspension of recruitment can be fully
justified for management reasons unrelated to the impending retirement of a member of
the Armed Forces.
4.2.3.3.5. If the position was last occupied by the proposed appointee
or another military incumbent, change to civilian incumbency must meet a bona fide
management need and not be to afford civilian employment to the proposed appointee.
4.3. Appointments 180 Days After Retirement
4.3.1. Appointments or transfers of retired members of the Armed Forces to
positions in any DoD Component during the 180 days immediately following retirement
may be made only when:
4.3.1.1. The appointment is to a position for which the minimum rate of
basic compensation has been increased by the OPM under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5303
(reference (b)); or
4.3.1.2. The appointment is to a position for which:
4.3.1.2.1. Equally well-qualified personnel are not available among
the employees being considered under applicable in-service placement and promotion
procedures;
4.3.1.2.2. Employee candidates are not available among those
required to be considered in priority placement programs, or among those on applicable
DoD Component Reemployment Priority Lists, or under the OPM Displaced Employee
Program; and
4.3.1.2.3. Intensive external recruitment efforts have failed to
produce any better qualified candidates.
4.3.2. A proposed appointment of a retired member of the Armed Forces under
subparagraph 4.3.1.2., above, requires the prior approval of the official to whom authority
has been delegated under paragraph 4.1., above. Each appointment must comply with the
spirit and intent of governing legislation and this Directive. Each appointment of a
retired member during the 180-day period must be fully documented to reflect this
compliance. As a minimum, this documentation shall include the information outlined at
enclosure 1. Documentation shall be retained in the active files for 2 years from the date
of appointment action.
4.4. Documentation and Notification Requirements. Under the Dual Compensation
Act (5 U.S.C. 5532, reference (b)), retired or retainer pay of those retired from the Armed
Forces may be subject to reduction. Defense procedures for administering the Act are
contained in DoD 1340.12-M (reference (e)). When a civilian office or position is filled

MEMORANDUM OPINION
GRANTING THE DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT;
DENYING THE PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I.

INTRODUCTION

This matter comes before the court on the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment.
The plaintiffs, Charles Larsen, Gregory McNear and James Linzey, are three non-liturgical
Protestant ministers who applied for but were denied commissions in the Navy Chaplain Corps
(the “Corps” or “Chaplaincy”).1 They bring suit against the Navy and the Secretary of the Navy
(collectively, the “defendants”) to challenge alleged prejudice in Corps hiring practices.
Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that the Navy has established religious quotas for Navy chaplain
accessions that intentionally favor liturgical clergy in violation of the First and Fifth
Amendments.2 The parties now each seek summary judgment. Because the Navy’s current
chaplain accession program seeks legitimate military ends while accommodating individual
rights to an appropriate (albeit limited) degree, the court grants the defendants’ motion for

1

On May 1, 2006, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal as to a fourth plaintiff, David
Myers, which the court approved that same day.

On November 18, 2004, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims under the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act. Mem. Op. (Nov. 18, 2004).

summary judgment and denies the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.

BACKGROUND
Factual Background

Because the facts of the present case are similar to several cases now pending before this
court, the court limits its discussion of the plaintiffs’ allegations to what is necessary to resolve
the instant motion.
The plaintiffs are non-liturgical ministers, all with prior military service. Compl. ¶ 1.
They applied to the Corps at various times in their careers, but the defendants rejected them
because, the plaintiffs allege, of a “systematic and pervasive religious prejudice” against nonliturgical faith groups. Id. ¶ 2. As part of this prejudice, the Navy favors liturgical Protestants,
despite the under-representation of liturgical Protestant service personnel and an overrepresentation of non-liturgical Protestant service personnel in the Navy generally. Id. ¶¶ 1-2.

The Defense Manpower Data Center (“DMDC”) collects data on the religious preferences
of individual Armed Forces members for the Department of Defense (“DOD”). Id. ¶ 8.
According to the plaintiffs, this data indicates that:
In stark contrast to their low and declining percentage of [Navy] personnel, the
Protestant liturgical chaplain category consistently comprises over 33% of the
Chaplain Corps, about three times the actual percentage of [Navy] personnel who
identify a religious preference. In contrast, non-liturgical chaplains have never come
close to an equivalence of their faith group percentage of those who identify a
religious preference.

The plaintiffs claim that the over-representation of liturgical chaplains stems from the
Navy’s conscious decision to insure that liturgical chaplains control the Corps. Id. ¶ 18. “Prior
to some time around 1988,” the defendants based the composition of the Corps on the religious
demography of the country. Id. ¶ 16. Because proportional representation led to an increased
number of non-liturgicals, the Corps became “concern[ed].” Id. ¶ 17. The defendants thus
abandoned their goal of proportional representation and, in 1988, imposed a “subjective quota
system,” Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. (“Pls.’ Mot.”) at 4, known as the “Thirds Policy,” id. ¶ 18.
Under this policy, the defendants divided the Corps into thirds: Roman Catholic, Protestant
liturgical, and non-liturgical Christian and Special Worship. Id. Since the defendants
implemented their Thirds Policy, their accession goals for chaplain candidates have not only been
arbitrary, but have also been a “deliberate misrepresentation of the Navy’s free exercise needs . . .
for the purpose of minimizing the career opportunities for non-liturgical clergy and . . . limit[ing]
their influence in the Corps and in the Navy, and hinder[ing] the religious rights of non-liturgical
personnel.” Id. ¶ 22. In 2001, the Navy abandoned the Thirds Policy, preferring instead to “take
the best qualified candidates, regardless of denomination.” Pls.’ Mot. at 6.
With regard to the individual plaintiffs, Rev. Larsen spent sixteen years in active duty in
the Navy. Compl. ¶ 4(A). He left in 1982 to attend the Dallas Theological Seminary and
complete the post-graduate education necessary to become a Navy chaplain. Id. While at Dallas
Theological Seminary, Rev. Larsen applied to the Navy’s Student Seminary Program, but he was
not accepted. Id. In 1987, after graduating from Dallas Theological Seminary, Larsen applied to
join the Corps, but the Corps rejected him with a letter stating that his non-liturgical faith group
had “no quota.” Id.

Rev. McNear served in the Air Force and the Colorado Air National Guard prior to
completing seminary in 1981. Id. ¶ 4(B). In 1993, he applied to the Navy to become a chaplain,
but he was told he needed additional post-graduate semester hours to meet the Corps’ criteria.
Id. Rev. McNear promptly completed these requirements and reapplied. Id. The Navy rejected
his application because, among other things, Rev. McNear was too old and did not satisfy the
“needs of the Navy.” Id., Ex. 8 ¶ 2. According to the plaintiffs, the age explanation was a
“sham” because liturgical Protestant candidates received waivers to join the Corps despite their
age during the same period, and the “needs of the Navy” is a “code-phrase” for an illegal quota
system disfavoring non-liturgical Protestants. Compl. ¶ 4(B).
Finally, Rev. Linzy is endorsed by the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, a nonliturgical group. Id. ¶ 4(D). He spent three years of active duty as an Army chaplain and applied
to become a Navy chaplain. Id. The Navy rejected his application – despite a shortage of
chaplains – and explained to Rev. Linzy that he would have been viewed more favorably if he
were a “baby baptizer” – that is, if he were not non-liturgical. Id.; see also Compl. ¶ 7(A) (noting
that liturgical denominations are sometimes referred to as “high church” or “baby baptizers”).

Procedural Background

The court last issued a memorandum opinion in this case on November 18, 2004, denying
in part and granting in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss. In their motion to dismiss, the
defendants moved for dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim
on which relief can be granted. Mem. Op. (Nov. 18, 2004). Specifically, the defendants argued
that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ demand to be commissioned
as officers, id. at 7, that sovereign immunity barred the plaintiffs’ request for monetary damages,

id. at 9, that the plaintiffs failed to allege immediate or imminent injury necessary for
constitutional standing, id. at 12, that the plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the applicable statute
of limitations, id. at 20, and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, id. at 22.
Regarding subject-matter jurisdiction, the court construed the plaintiffs’ complaint as
seeking the opportunity to compete for commission in the Corps rather than, as the defendants
had argued, asking the court to actually commission the plaintiffs in the Navy. Id. at 7-8. Noting
the court’s jurisdiction to entertain such claims, id. at 7 (citing Emory v. Sec. of the Navy, 819
F.2d 291, 294 (D.C. Cir. 1987)), the court denied the defendants’ motion for dismissal. Because
the plaintiffs never served as Navy chaplains, the court ruled that monetary damages (in the form
of constructive and retirement credit), are inappropriate. Mem. Op. (Nov. 18, 2004) at 11 (citing
5 U.S.C. § 702).
With regard to standing, the court concluded that the plaintiffs’ pleadings sufficed, at the
motion to dismiss stage, in alleging a concrete plan to reapply to the Corps if the court ordered
the Navy to remove the unconstitutional barriers they allege. Id. at 17. With this assessment, the
court concluded that the plaintiffs’ alleged harm was sufficiently imminent to establish standing.
Id. Finally, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ Religious Freedom
Restoration Act claims, concluding that the plaintiffs do not challenge a law of neutral or general
applicability – a prerequisite for suits under that statute. Id. at 24-26.

ANALYSIS

Because of the procedural complexity of this case, the court takes a step back to briefly
recount the plaintiffs’ existing claims. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants’ past Thirds
Policy and its current chaplain accession plan violate the First and Fifth Amendments. Compl.
¶¶ 24-45. They seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief and an order from the court directing the
defendants to eliminate current and past bias and to provide certain remedies to the plaintiffs. Id.
at 24. As to declaratory relief, the plaintiffs request a judgment that: (1) the Navy’s accession
policies violate the First and Fifth Amendments, and DOD regulations; (2) the Navy has
unlawfully denied Rev. Larsen an opportunity to compete for the Seminary Program, a
commission, a career, and a promotion; (3) the Navy’s conduct has denied the other plaintiffs an
equal opportunity to compete for a commission; and (4) the Navy has unlawfully caused Rev.
McNear to lose a career in the Naval Reserve. Id. at 24-25. As to injunctive relief, the plaintiffs
ask the court to stop the defendants from discriminating in chaplain accession and career
development decisions and to stop the defendants from deriving accession goals that are not
based on the Navy’s religious needs. Id. at 25-26. Finally, the plaintiffs ask the court to order
the defendants to eliminate vestiges of discrimination, develop a neutral accession system based
solely on the religious needs of the Navy Corps and to allow the plaintiffs the opportunity to be
commissioned as chaplains if they are otherwise qualified. Id. at 26-27.
From a legal perspective, the plaintiffs’ case boils down to a constitutional challenge to
the Navy’s now-extinct Thirds Policy and its current chaplaincy accession policy. The parties
have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court now turns to the merits of those
motions.

Subject-Matter Jurisdiction

Before tackling the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims, the court must consider the
defendants’ arguments that the court lacks subject-matters jurisdiction. Specifically, the
defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ claims are barred by sovereign immunity, Defs.’ Mot. for
Summary J. (“Defs.’ Mot.”) at 7, and that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge both the
Navy’s past and its current hiring practices, id. at 10.
1.

Legal Standard for Subject-Matter Jurisdiction

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and the law presumes that “a cause lies
outside this limited jurisdiction.” Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377
(1994); St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 288-89 (1938); see also Gen.
Motors Corp. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 363 F.3d 442, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting that “[a]s a
court of limited jurisdiction, we begin, and end, with an examination of our jurisdiction”).
Because “subject-matter jurisdiction is an ‘Art. III as well as a statutory requirement[,] no
action of the parties can confer subject-matter jurisdiction upon a federal court.’” Akinseye v.
District of Columbia, 339 F.3d 970, 971 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Ins. Corp. of Ir., Ltd. v.
Compagnie des Bauxite de Guinea, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982)). On a motion to dismiss for lack
of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504
U.S. 555, 561 (1992). The court may dismiss a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction
only if “‘it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his
claim which would entitle him to relief.’” Empagran S.A. v. F. Hoffman-Laroche, Ltd., 315 F.3d
338, 343 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957)).

Because subject-matter jurisdiction focuses on the court’s power to hear the claim,
however, the court must give the plaintiff’s factual allegations closer scrutiny when resolving a
Rule 12(b)(1) motion than would be required for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a
claim. Macharia v. United States, 334 F.3d 61, 64, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Grand Lodge of
Fraternal Order of Police v. Ashcroft, 185 F. Supp. 2d 9, 13 (D.D.C. 2001). Moreover, the court
is not limited to the allegations contained in the complaint. Hohri v. United States, 782 F.2d 227,
241 (D.C. Cir. 1986), vacated on other grounds, 482 U.S. 64 (1987). Instead, to determine
whether it has jurisdiction over the claim, the court may consider materials outside the pleadings.
Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
2.

The Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Barred by Sovereign Immunity

The defendants argue that the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’
challenge to the Navy’s accession practices because “it seeks to completely overhaul the Navy’s
system of commissioning new officers into its Chaplaincy Corps – a policy constitutionally and
statutorily committed to the Navy’s discretion[.]” Defs.’ Mot. at 7.
At its heart, the plaintiffs seek to compete for a position without the Navy subjecting
them to an allegedly unconstitutional hiring practice. Such a claim is precisely within the ambit
of the federal judiciary. Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 304 (1983) (stating that “this Court
has never held, nor do we now hold, that personnel are barred from all redress in civilian courts
for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military service”); Dilley v. Alexander, 603
F.2d 914, 920 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (noting that “courts have shown extreme reluctance to interfere
with the military’s lawful exercise of its discretion over internal management matters,” but
pointing out that this principle “is wholly inappropriate . . . when a case presents an issue that is

amenable to judicial resolution. Specifically, courts have shown no hesitation to review cases in
which a violation of the Constitution, statutes, or regulations is alleged”).
The defendants rely on Orloff v. Willoughby, in which the Supreme Court noted that
“Congress has authorized the President alone to appoint Army officers in grades up to and
including that of colonel, above which the advice and consent of the Senate is required.” Id. at 8
(quoting Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 93, 91 (1953)). In Orloff, the Court found it “obvious
that the commissioning of officers in the Army is a matter of discretion within the province of the
President as Commander in Chief.” Orloff, 345 U.S. at 91. Despite the seeming unequivocal
nature of Orloff, however, this circuit has made clear that “[s]ince Orloff, the doctrine of
nonreviewability of military decisions has undergone considerable modification, as courts have
evinced increased willingness to review military actions alleged to contravene express
constitutional, statutory or regulatory requirements.” Blevins v. Orr, 721 F.2d 1419, 1421 (D.C.
Cir. 1983).
In short, and contrary to the defendants’ assertion, “[i]t is the duty of the federal courts to
inquire whether an action of a military agency conforms to the law, or is instead arbitrary,
capricious or contrary to the statutes and regulations governing that agency.” Dilley, 603 F.2d at
920. Balanced against the Supreme Court’s caution in Orloff, the court’s role here is “limited but
crucial.” Ridgely v. Marsh, 866 F.2d 1526 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quoting Blevins, 721 F.2d at 1421).
Accordingly, the court rejects the Navy’s contention that its personnel decisions are immune
from judicial scrutiny where constitutional wrongs are alleged.

The defendants claim that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Navy’s accession
practices because they have “failed to demonstrate that they face a concrete likelihood of future
injury[.]” Defs.’ Mot. at 10. In essence, the defendants claim that the plaintiffs can show neither
immediate or imminent injury nor redressability. Id. Though the court previously rejected the
defendants’ challenge to the plaintiffs’ standing, its analysis focused on the burdens attending the
plaintiffs at the motion to dismiss phase of the litigation, rather than at the motion for summary
judgment phase. Because the plaintiffs’ burden of demonstrating standing is greater at the
summary judgment phase, Sierra Club v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 292 F.3d 895, 898-99 (D.C. Cir.
2002), the court must consider the issue anew.

Legal Standard for Standing

Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases or
controversies. U.S. CONST . ART . III, § 2, cl. 1. These prerequisites reflect the “common
understanding of what it takes to make a justiciable case.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better
Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998). Consequently, “a showing of standing is an essential and
unchanging predicate to any exercise of a court’s jurisdiction.” Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen,
94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560
(1992)).
As the party invoking federal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing
standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 104; City of Waukesha v. Envtl. Prot.
Agency, 320 F.3d 228, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (per curiam). The extent of the plaintiff’s burden
varies according to the procedural posture of the case. Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 898-99. At the
pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct

suffice. Id.
To demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must satisfy a three-pronged test. Id., 292 F.3d at
898 (citing Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560). First, the plaintiff must have suffered an
injury in fact, defined as a harm that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or
hypothetical. Byrd v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 174 F.3d 239, 243 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (citing Steel Co.,
523 U.S. at 103). Second, the injury must be fairly traceable to the governmental conduct
alleged. Id. Finally, it must be likely that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury. Id.
Our court of appeals has made clear that no standing exists if the plaintiff’s allegations are
“purely speculative[, which is] the ultimate label for injuries too implausible to support
standing.” Tozzi v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 271 F.3d 301, 307 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Nor is
there standing where the court “would have to accept a number of very speculative inferences
and assumptions in any endeavor to connect the alleged injury with [the challenged conduct].”
Winpisinger v. Watson, 628 F.2d 133, 139 (D.C. Cir. 1980).

The Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Navy’s Current Policy

The defendants argue that the plaintiffs lack standing to request prospective relief because
the possibility of future harm is speculative or hypothetical. Defs.’ Mot. at 11 (citing City of L.A.
v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983)). The court previously considered this issue in addressing the
defendants’ motion to dismiss and concluded, noting the procedural posture of the case at that
time, that general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendants’ conduct may
suffice, “for on a motion to dismiss [courts] ‘presum[e] that general allegations embrace those
specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.’” Mem. Op. (Nov. 18, 2004) at 16 (quoting
Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561). Thereafter, the court projected that “at the summary judgment stage, the

court could not construe the plaintiffs’ ‘interest[] in becoming chaplains’ more favorably than the
‘some day’ plans in Lujan – plans which, the Court in Lujan noted, lacked concreteness ‘or
indeed even any specification of when the some day will be.’” Id.
In assessing standing, the court must consider whether the plaintiffs plan to reapply to the
Corps – and, if they do plan to reapply, whether their plan is a mere “some day” intent or hope, or
something more – something concrete. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564. An inquiry into the plaintiffs’
plan necessarily centers around the plaintiffs’ intentions. Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 261
(2003).
Recognizing the scant record concerning the plaintiffs’ intentions on reapplying to the
Navy Chaplaincy, the court previously ordered briefing as to “whether each plaintiff is ‘able and
ready’ to apply for a Navy chaplain commission.” Order (Aug. 9, 2004). The court’s inquiry
stemmed from the Supreme Court’s explanation in Gratz that a plaintiff had standing to seek
prospective relief if the plaintiff could demonstrate that he is “able and ready” to apply if the
allegedly discriminatory impediment was removed. Id. In response, on August 23, 2004, the
plaintiffs submitted a memorandum accompanied by declarations from each plaintiff responding
to the court’s inquiry that “‘yes’, I am ‘able and ready’ to apply for a Navy chaplain
commission.” Pls.’ Supplemental Mem. (Aug. 23, 2004), Ex. 2 ¶ 3; see also id. Exs. 3 ¶ 3 & 5 ¶
3.
Despite the plaintiffs’ assertions, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ readiness and
willingness to reapply to the Navy remains speculative. Defs.’ Mot. at 12. Although the court
concurs with the government’s assessment, this characterization does not damn the plaintiffs’
standing because the nature of the prospective standing inquiry is inherently speculative,

concerning the subjective intent of the suing party. The speculative quality of the plaintiffs’
assertions notwithstanding, the plaintiffs’ declarations constitute “direct testimonial evidence” of
their intent to reapply, Arrington, 473 F.3d at 338, which suffices in defeating summary
judgment,3 Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 (noting that in considering a motion for summary
judgment, the court must draw all justifiable inferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and
accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true); see also, Gratz, 539 U.S. at 282 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (noting that the plaintiff in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), succeeded in
demonstrating standing through a declaration that the plaintiff “still desires to attend the Law
School and become a lawyer”).
One final note regarding the plaintiffs’ readiness to reapply. The defendants argue that
for various reasons the plaintiffs do not currently meet the basic threshold qualifications for
acceptance into the Navy chaplaincy. Defs.’ Mot. at 17-18. For example, the defendants argue
that defendants McNear and Larson both fail to meet the current age requirement for accession,

3

The court notes that the ability of litigants to gain standing by simply declaring their
readiness and willingness reduces the standing assessment from the traditional bleeding
plaintiff inquiry, to a formulaic pleading requirement. Such superficial formality is
equally present in the traditional standing inquiry. Cf. B. Woodward & S. Armstrong,
The Brethren 192 (1981) (noting Justice White’s rhetorical question asking “[w]hy
didn’t the Sierra Club have one goddamn member walk through the park and then there
would have been standing to sue?”). Indeed, the court is at a loss to see how a Sierra
Club members’ walk through the park creates real skin in the game. And with advice of
half decent counsel, it seems doubtful that any litigant would fail to demonstrate standing
under the current doctrine (e.g., an attorney advising his client to walk through the park
or invoke the buzz words “ready and able” before initiating suit). Nevertheless, the
Supreme Court has instructed that a litigant has standing by demonstrating readiness and
willingness to compete, N.E. Fl. Chapter of the Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of
Jacksonville, Fl., 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993), and it is not to this court to second guess that
determination, Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 375 (1982) (indicating that Supreme Court
precedent “must be followed by the lower federal courts no matter how misguided the
judges of those courts may think it to be”).

that Larson has been unable to obtain an ecclesiastical endorsement, that McNear has not
remained in touch with his endorser since first applying to the chaplaincy in 1996, and that
McNear has not been hired by a congregation as a pastor. Id.
The current Navy Instruction governing basic qualifications for chaplain accession is
Secretary of the Navy Instruction 1120.9 (“SECNAVINST 1120.9”). Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of
Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Reply”) at 6, n. 4; Ex. A. The current policy requires that applicants
“be able to complete 20 years of active service by age 68.” Id., Ex. A at 4. To the defendants,
plaintiffs McNear’s and Larson’s current ages disqualify them from consideration in the
chaplaincy, and in turn, strip them of standing in this case.4 Defs.’ Mot. at 18. The court is not
persuaded. Though SECNAVINST 1120.9 has an age requirement which plaintiffs McNear and
Larson apparently do not satisfy, that age requirement is not absolute: the Navy can waive this
requirement if, inter alia, “extraordinary circumstances cause such a waiver to be in the best
interests of the Naval Service” or “[w]hen a gross inequity to the applicant would otherwise
result.” Defs.’ Reply, Ex. A at 4. The defendants argue that this exception poses no loophole for
the plaintiffs because the fact that the Navy can grant a waiver on a case-by-case basis does not
mean that all candidates are entitled to one. Id. at 7. Though the defendants are correct that the
waiver does not create a rule, their argument misses the point. Because the court’s immediate

inquiry concerns the plaintiffs’ standing to bring suit, not the merits of their case, the court’s
inquiry focuses not on whether the Navy must grant an age waiver to McNear and Larson, but
whether such a waiver is possible. Ranger Cellular v. F.C.C., 348 F.3d 1044 (D.C. Cir. 2003)
(recognizing standing if there is a “realistic possibility” of competing).
The plaintiffs cite numerous instances in which otherwise age disqualified candidates
received a waiver from the Navy. Pls.’ Reply at 17-18. Because circumstances exist under
SECNAVINST 1120.9 under which the Navy would consider McNear and Larson despite their
age, their non-qualification under SECNAVINST 1120.9 does not divest them of standing.
To the defendants, the plaintiffs also fail to meet threshold requirements concerning
current ecclesiastical endorsements and physical fitness. Defs.’ Mot. at 18. The defendants
support these claims with citations to non-existent pages of their exhibits. See Infra. at n.4.
Moreover, the defendants cite no cases suggesting that the plaintiffs must meet every procedural
and ministerial prerequisite for application at every stage in a litigation alleging a more grievous
and fundamental impediment to their candidacy. Accepting the defendants’ arguments would
mean that a plaintiff seeking the opportunity to compete must satisfy all of that job’s other
qualifications throughout the litigation.
Although the plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating standing, the court cannot
scrutinize their standing under the defendants’ particularized arguments without evidentiary
support. It suffices for the court that the plaintiffs declare their present desire, their readiness and
their willingness to apply. Gratz, 539 U.S. at 282 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The court presumes
that if the time came for the plaintiffs to reapply, they would align all of their ducks regarding the
Navy’s procedural prerequisites for applicants; they would update their resume, they would

plaintiffs to meet the eligibility requirements of the Navy, not whether they currently meet every
last one.

The Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Challenge the Navy’s Thirds Policy

Part of the plaintiffs’ case challenges the constitutionality of the Navy’s nowdecommissioned Thirds Policy. Pls.’ Mot. at 13-27. The purpose of that policy, as the plaintiffs
see it, was “to have the Navy Chaplain Corps reflect the religious denominational and faith group
makeup of the American population.” Pls.’ Statement of Facts in Supp. of its Mot. for Summ. J.
at 39. To implement the policy, the plaintiffs contend, the Navy used a formula for computing
the accession targets for each of the faith groupings to achieve congruity with the religious
demographics of the nation at large. Pls.’ Mot. at 3. The plaintiffs challenge the Thirds Policy
by providing statistical evidence demonstrating a systematic favoritism for liturgical Protestants
at the expense of non-liturgical Protestants. See id. 17.
For their part, the defendants provide their own set of statistical evidence which they
contend proves that these accession goals “played no role in determining which candidates
received commissions.” Defs.’ Mot. at 41-45. At the summary judgment stage, the court’s role
is not to evaluate the parties’ evidence or draw factual conclusions. FED . R. CIV . P. 56(c). And a
proper evidentiary evaluation of the parties’ evidence and expert testimony would ultimately fall
to a fact finder, at a later stage in litigation. As elaborated below, however, because the Navy
voluntarily abandoned its Thirds Policy and because the plaintiffs present no evidence showing
that the Navy took this action merely to avoid judicial review, the plaintiffs’ challenge to this

policy is moot.
i.

Legal Standard for Mootness

Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement prohibits courts from issuing advisory
opinions or decisions based on hypothetical facts or abstract issues. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83,
96 (1968). “The doctrine of mootness is a logical corollary of the case or controversy
requirement[.]” Better Gov’t Ass’n v. Dep’t of State, 780 F.2d 86, 90 (D.C. Cir. 1986). In cases
where challenged conduct ceases and “there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be
repeated, . . . it becomes impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the
prevailing party, and any opinion as to the legality of the challenged action would be advisory.”
City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 287 (2000). Accordingly, a court may not rule on the
merits of a case in which the claim for relief is moot.
Courts must evaluate mootness “through all stages” of the litigation to ensure that a live
controversy remains. 21st Century, 318 F.3d at 198 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw
Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 191 (2000) and Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S.
472, 477 (1990)). As a result, “[e]ven where litigation poses a live controversy when filed, the
[mootness] doctrine requires a federal court to refrain from deciding it if ‘events have so
transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the parties’ rights nor have a more-thanspeculative chance of affecting them in the future.’” Id. (quoting Clarke v. United States, 915
F.2d 699, 701 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).
A case is moot when “the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally
cognizable interest in the outcome.” City of Erie, 529 U.S. at 287 (internal quotations omitted).
An intervening event may render a claim moot if (1) there is no reasonable expectation that the

conduct will recur and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the
effects of the alleged violations. Pharmachemie B.V. v. Barr Labs,, Inc., 276 F.3d 627, 631
(D.C. Cir. 2002); Sellers v. Bureau of Prisons, 959 F.2d 307, 310 (D.C. Cir. 1992). A case is not
moot, however, so long as any single claim for relief remains viable, as the remaining live issues
satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement. Tucson Med. Ctr. v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 971, 978
(D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The burden of establishing
mootness rests on the party raising the issue, and it is a heavy burden. County of Los Angeles v.
Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979); United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953);
Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass’n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 458-59 (D.C. Cir. 1998).
ii.

The Plaintiffs’ Challenge to the Navy’s Thirds Policy is Moot

To the extent that the Navy ever employed a Thirds Policy in its chaplain accession
decisions, a fact the parties dispute, this policy has “since been replaced by the current faith
group-neutral system[.]” Defs.’ Mot. at 18; see Pls.’ Mot. at 6 (recognizing that the
“[d]efendants abandoned any [faith group cluster] specific accession goals or targets” in 2001).
In this case, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Navy from utilizing unconstitutional policies so that
the plaintiffs can compete for membership in the Corps. See Mem. Op. (Nov. 18, 2004) at 7
(construing the plaintiffs’ complaint as “seeking to compete for a position without the Navy
subjecting them to an allegedly unconstitutional hiring practice”). Because the Thirds Policy is
no longer in service, an injunction would serve no purpose. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better
Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 108-109 (1998).

In Steel Co., the plaintiff challenged a steel manufacturer’s failure to report toxic and

hazardous chemical storage end emissions statistics as required by statute. After the plaintiff
initiated suit, the steel manufacturer voluntarily submitted its reports. For this reason, the Court
ruled that injunctive relief – “aimed at deterring petitioner from violating [the relevant statute] in
the future,” was insufficient for purposes of Article III standing. Id., at 108-109. In the case, the
United States, speaking through an amicus brief, argued that “there is a presumption of [future]
injury when the defendant has voluntarily ceased its illegal activity in response to litigation.” Id.
at 109 (correction in original). Characterizing this argument as creating a “sword out of a
shield,” the Court ruled that “[i]t is an immense and unacceptable stretch to call the presumption
[of future injury] into service as a substitute for the allegation of present or threatened injury
upon which initial standing must be based.” Id. (citing Lyons, 461 U.S. at 109).
Had the plaintiffs in the present case alleged that “a continuing violation or the
imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested would remedy that alleged harm.”
Id. at 108. But like the plaintiff in Steel Co., the plaintiffs here do not allege that the Navy plans
to reinstate its challenged Thirds Policy. For this reason, the plaintiffs’ challenge to the Navy’s
Thirds Policy is not redressible by court-ordered injunctive relief, and is, therefore, dismissed as
moot.

Judgment as to the Navy’s Current Practice
Having resolved the requisite jurisdictional issues, the court turns now to the pending
merits upon summary judgment. Simply put, the issue before the court is whether the Navy’s
current chaplain accession practice violates the Constitution.
1.

Legal Standard for a Motion for Summary Judgment

Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law.” FED . R. CIV . P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322
(1986); Diamond v. Atwood, 43 F.3d 1538, 1540 (D.C. Cir. 1995). To determine which facts are
“material,” a court must look to the substantive law on which each claim rests. Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A “genuine issue” is one whose resolution could
establish an element of a claim or defense and, therefore, affect the outcome of the action.
Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable
inferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true.
Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the mere
existence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252. To prevail on a motion
for summary judgment, the moving party must show that the nonmoving party “fail[ed] to make
a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on
which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. By pointing to
the absence of evidence proffered by the nonmoving party, a moving party may succeed on

summary judgment. Id.
The moving party may defeat summary judgment through factual representations made in
a sworn affidavit if he “support[s] his allegations . . . with facts in the record, Green, 164 F.3d at
675 (quoting Harding v. Gray, F.3d 150, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1993)), or provides “direct testimonial
evidence,” Arrington v. United States, 473 F.3d 329, 338 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Indeed, for the court
to accept anything less “would defeat the central purpose of the summary judgment device,
which is to weed out those cases insufficiently meritorious to warrant the expense of a jury trial.”
Green, 164 F.3d at 675.
2.

Appropriate Legal Standard of Review for Assessing the Plaintiffs’
Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause Claims

Under the current naval policy, the Navy “takes the best qualified candidates, regardless
of denomination.” Pls.’ Mot. at 6; see also Defs.’ Mot. at 26 (indicating that the policy “does not
set any accession goals, guidelines, or quotas for chaplain applicants from any denomination,
faith group, or faith group category”). Whereas the Navy’s goal in the formerly-employed Thirds
Policy was to link the composition of the Navy Chaplaincy to the religious denominational
demographics of the community generally, the Navy currently “considers numerous factors” in
deriving its chaplaincy accession needs. Id. at 30. These factors include: “the breadth of
locations where Navy personnel serve,” “the unique circumstances of Naval service, which
involves personnel isolated on ships sailing all over the world,” “the various functions and tasks
of chaplain officers outside of religious services including assistance to those of other faith
groups and even no faith groups,” “the need to keep accession, promotion, and retention in line
with other naval communities,” the need to prevent shortages of qualified clergy,” “the need to

maintain capacity to respond to events requiring quick access to chaplains from different faith
groups not stationed on site, such as terror attacks,” and “the need to consider administrative
necessities in managing an all-volunteer corps.” Id. (citing exhibits 14 and 16).
In assessing the constitutionality of the Navy’s current practice, the court turns to case
law concerning the First Amendment’s religion clauses. The court ferociously guards the
constitutional command that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof[.]” U.S. Const. Am. I. Congress “may justify an
in-road on religious liberty [however] by showing that it is the least restrictive means of
achieving some compelling state interests.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Sec. Div.,
450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981). “It is basic that no showing merely of a rational relationship to some
colorable state interest would suffice; in this highly sensitive constitutional area, ‘(o)nly the

government’s word at face value, but instead conducts an independent inquiry to assess its
plausability. Id. (noting that certain stated justifications for infringement on religious liberty
would likely not suffice in justifying the infringement and recognizing the government’s burden

the subject is that only those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can
overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion”).

Supreme Court has charted a far different course. Noting that “the military is, by necessity, a
specialized society separate from civilian society,” Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 743 (1974), the
Supreme Court declared that judicial review of challenges to military action “is far more
deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian
society,” Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 501, 508 (1986); Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 677, 692
(D.C. Cir. 1994) (recognizing the highly deferential standard set forth in Goldman and that “even
the First Amendment must yield at times to the exigencies of military life”).
In Goldman, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to an Air Force regulation
mandating uniform dress for Air Force service members. Goldman, an orthodox Jew, challenged
this regulation because, in application, it prevented him from wearing a Jewish head covering,
the yarmulke.5 Justice Stevens, concurring with the majority’s disposition, rendered a concise
background of the case:
[Goldman’s] devotion to his faith is readily apparent. The yarmulke is a familiar and
accepted sight. In addition to its religious significance for the wearer, the yarmulke
may evoke the deepest respect and admiration – the symbol of a distinguished
tradition and an eloquent rebuke to the ugliness of anti-Semitism. Captain
Goldman’s military duties are performed in a setting in which a modest departure
from the uniform regulation creates almost no danger of impairment of the Air
Force’s military mission. Moreover, on the record before us, there is reason to
believe that the policy of strict enforcement against Captain Goldman had a
retaliatory motive – he had worn his yarmulke while testifying on behalf of a
defendant in a court-martial proceeding.

“Yarmulkes are generally understood to be a form of religious observance. They are
commonly seen and accepted in today’s society wherever Orthodox Jews are found.”
Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 501, 511 n. 1 (1986). These head coverings are the
“symbol of [a] faith whose roots are as deep and venerable as Western civilization itself
[constituting a] symbol of a great faith from which Western morality and the JudeoChristian tradition have arisen.” Goldman v. Sec. of Defense, 739 F.2d 657 (1984)

With these facts, Justice Stevens editorialized that this was “an especially attractive case”
justifying judicial rebuke of the challenged military policy. Id. at 511 (Stevens, J., concurring).
Nevertheless, Justice Stevens joined the majority in concluding that Goldman’s religious liberties
in wearing his yarmulke, an unquestioned hallmark of his religious faith, yielded to the military’s
decision to institute a uniform dress policy which lacked an exception for religious attire. Id. at
511-512. Recognizing that such regulations “may be more objectionable” for the plaintiff, the
Court nonetheless took the view that the Air Force’s policy, which “encourages the subordination
of personal preferences and identities in favor of the overall group mission,” was paramount. Id.
at 508.
In reaching this decision, the Supreme Court rejected the traditional “strict scrutiny”
analysis in favor of a more deferential analysis. Id. at 507-508. In Orloff, the Supreme Court had
recognized that “the very essence of compulsory service is the subordination of the desires and
interest of individual to the needs of the service.” Orloff, 345 U.S. at 91. In Goldman, the Court
extended this reference to “desires and interests” to servicemen in the practice and religious
commands of their religious faith. Goldman, 475 U.S. at 507 (quoting Orloff). In short, because
“within the military there is simply not the same [individual] autonomy as there is in the larger
civilian community . . . when evaluating whether military needs justify a particular restriction on
religiously motivated conduct, courts must give great deference to the professional judgment of
military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest.” Id. at
508 (citing Parker, 417 U.S. at 751).
The plaintiffs advocate the use of the traditional strict scrutiny analysis. Pls.’ Mot. at 13.

And to distance themselves from Goldman, they simply ignore it.6 Nowhere in the plaintiffs’
motion for summary judgment, their opposition to the defendants’ cross-motion for summary
judgment, or their reply in support of their motion for summary judgment do the plaintiffs
distinguish, let alone cite, Goldman. The plaintiffs, instead, cite a litany of cases for the
proposition that the court must apply strict scrutiny when a plaintiff alleges preferential treatment
based on denominational membership (a.k.a., “denominational preference” cases). Pls.’ Mot. at
14 (citing Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982), Hernandez v. C.I.R., 490 U.S. 680, 685

Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 623 (1988)). The cases cited by the plaintiffs, however,

The plaintiffs cite Anderson v. Laird, 466 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1972) to support their
contention that the court need not defer to the military’s judgment. Pls.’ Mot. at 10. The
plaintiffs’ reliance on Laird is misplaced. In Laird, the D.C. Circuit invalidated a
program requiring military cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point,
New York, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and the United
States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado, to attend religious services.
The Circuit’s decision, comprised of separate concurring opinions by Judges Bazelon
and Leventhal, ruled that the forced attendance law violated the Establishment Clause.
Laird, 466 F.2d at 290. Judge Bazelon held that compulsory church attendance was
“absolutely proscribed by the Establishment Clause.” Id. Yet Judge Bazelon also
recognized that if the program’s purpose was “of preserving the right to free exercise of
religion,” it would be constitutionally permissible. Id. In fact, as if prescient to the facts
of this case, Judge Bazelon continued that “accommodation of the Establishment Clause
to permit maintenance of religious personnel and institutions within the military is
necessitated . . . by the mandate of the Free Exercise Clause that soldiers be given the
opportunity to worship.” Id. n.36.
Judge Leventhal, for his part, ruled that the compulsory church attendance requirement
violated the Establishment Clause, but predicated his ruling on the fact that the military
had demonstrated no “military necessity” for the program. Id. at 297. Here, by contrast,
the Navy explicitly rests their chaplaincy program on such claims of military necessity.

judicial space of their own.7
The plaintiffs’ argument for strict scrutiny has some doctrinal appeal given the breadth of
cases applying the strict scrutiny analysis. But the ubiquity of strict scrutiny does not prove its
application absolute. Along with Goldman, the Supreme Court has applied one form or another
of relaxed scrutiny “in several cases involving discrete categories of governmental action in
which there are special reasons to defer to the judgment of the political branches.” Church of the
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 571 n.5 (1993). And with regard to
cases concerning the religion clauses, “rigidity could well defeat the basic purpose of these
provisions, which is to insure that no religion be sponsored or favored, none commanded, and
none inhibited.” Waltz v. Tax Comm’n, 397 U.S. 664, 669 (1970). Therefore, “short of those
expressly proscribed governmental acts, there is room for play in the joints productive of a

7

The plaintiffs advocate the use of strict scrutiny because the Navy’s accession program,
in practice, suggests statistical denominational preference. Pls.’ Mot. at 13-14 (citing
Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 246 (1982)). A suggestion of denominational
preference, demonstrated through statistics, would complicate the court’s analysis, and
perhaps require judicial application of strict scrutiny, Orloff and Goldman
notwithstanding, see Waltz v. Tax Comm’n, 397 U.S. 664, 669 (1970) (noting that the
“course of constitutional neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line”). If
a plaintiff happened into court with hard statistics showing that a current military
program worked a statistically significant disparity in treatment between members of
different faiths, perhaps the scales would tip away from deference to military judgment
and in favor of judicial stewardship of individual rights. Without suggesting that a
statistical suggestion of denominational preference would spur the court to conduct fact
finding in a battle between statistical experts, the court leaves this determination for
another court on another day.
Such a circumstance does not exist in the present case, however. Here, though the
plaintiffs allege that the previously utilized accession program created denominational
preferences, see generally, Pls.’ Mot. at 2, the plaintiffs own data shows that under the
Navy’s current accession policy, accession rates among applicants of different faith
groups have “converged,” and any previously existing statistical differences “have
dissipated,” Pls.’ Stmt. of Facts ¶ 126 (quoting Pls.’ Mot. Ex. 28 (Leuba Decl.) at 65 ¶

benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and
without interference.” Id.
The plaintiffs misread the court’s August 22, 2002 Memorandum Opinion in the related
Adair case as endorsing a strict scrutiny analysis for the present case. In that ruling, the court
mentioned strict scrutiny within the context of delineating the plaintiffs’ initial burdens in
avoiding a pre-discovery summary judgment challenge. Adair v. England, 217 F. Supp. 2d 7, 14
(D.D.C. 2002). That analysis is not at all applicable in the current context, in which the court has
occasion to reach the constitutional merits of the case.
In a Memorandum Opinion issued on January 10, 2002 in Adair, the court suggested that
relaxed scrutiny as articulated in Goldman did not apply to the military chaplaincy cases. The
court’s determination was based, in part, on the nature of the defendants’ stated justifications at
the time for its policies. Adair v. England, 183 F. Supp. 2d 31 (D.D.C. 2002) (noting that the
challenged regulation in Adair involved “considerations that are not related to strictly military
affairs or to the defense of the country”). There, the government “never tr[ied] to articulate how
the challenged policies and practices – e.g., alleged religious preferences for liturgical Christian
chaplains – would further any operational, strategic, or tactical objectives.” Id. Without the
Navy demonstrating a link between the chaplaincy and strategic or national defense concerns, the
court was left to conclude that the Navy’s interest in creating the chaplaincy constituted only
“quality-of-life issues” which were “designed to hire, retain, and promote chaplains to satisfy the
religious needs of Navy service members.” Id. Now, by contrast, the court has before it the
Navy’s stated justifications for its policy: “Chaplains help prepare and maintain sailors’ and
marines’ ability to engage in combat and other tactical, strategic, and operational missions,

directly tying chaplains to the Navy’s ability to defend the nation.” Defs.’ Mot. at 28. The court
takes the Navy’s statement at its word. Goldman, 475 U.S. at 507-509 (instructing that “courts
must give great deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the
relative importance of a particular military interest”). Accordingly, the court concludes that the
Navy’s interest in developing a chaplaincy is akin to the Air Force’s needs in mandating
standards of uniformity at play in Goldman; that is, it concerns “operational, strategic, or tactical
matters.” Goldman, 475 U.S. at 507-509; see, e.g., Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 223, 237 (2d Cir.
1985) (recognizing that “the morale of our soldiers, their willingness to serve, and the efficiency
of the Army as an instrument for our national defense rests in substantial part on the military
chaplaincy, which is vital to our Army’s functioning”). For this reason, the relaxed scrutiny
employed in Goldman is the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny in evaluating how the Navy
goes about implementing those goals.
The court has one additional justification for its conclusion. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the
Supreme Court recognized with approval the assertion of high ranking retired military leaders
that a “highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essential to the military’s ability to
fulfill its principle mission to provide national security.” 539 U.S. at 329. Both affirmative
action programs designed to promote diversity in the military officers corps and the Navy’s
current chaplaincy accession program do not instinctively implicate national security the way, for
example, troop assignments, rules of engagement, or weapons procurement might. But just as
the Supreme Court credits the statements of former military officials in asserting that maintaining
racial diversity promotes national security, so too does this court credit the Navy’s “tying
chaplains to the Navy’s ability to defend the nation.” Defs.’ Mot. at 28. In a very real sense, in

other words, the Navy’s stated interest in operating a chaplaincy corps (which may involve
incidental religious discrimination) resounds with equal force as the military’s interest in seeking,
fostering, and promoting racial diversity in its officers corps (which may involve incidental racial
discrimination). See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 329. In both cases, military service demands “the
subordination of the desires and interests of the individuals to the needs of the service.” Orloff,
345 U.S. at 92.
3.

The Defendants’ Current Navy Accession Policy Survives Constitutional Scrutiny
Because religion clause cases engender “room for play in the joints,” Waltz, 397 U.S. at

669, the court begins its analysis with mention of the constitutional context of this case. The
realities of maintaining a military in a religiously pluralistic nation places the government in a
delicate constitutional position given the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. On
the one hand, “[s]pending federal funds to employ chaplains for the armed forces might be said
to violate the Establishment Clause.” Abington Sch. Dist. v. Schempp, 341 U.S. 203, 308-09
(Stewart, J. dissenting). “Yet a lonely soldier stationed at some faraway outpost could surely
complain that a government which did not provide him the opportunity for pastoral guidance was
affirmatively prohibiting the free exercise of his religion.” Id. (emphasis in original); see also,
844 (Brennan, J., concurring) (recognizing that the military chaplaincy constitutes a practice
“conceivably violative of the Establishment Clause [but] the striking down of which might
seriously interfere with certain religious liberties also protected by the First Amendment”). It is
in the space between the constitutional command against practices respecting an establishment of
religion and the command against practices which prohibit the free exercise thereof that the
military chaplaincy rests. With this fundamental understanding of the constitutional difficulties

attending the Navy chaplaincy program in mind, the court proceeds.
The plaintiffs challenge the Navy Chaplaincy’s current open accession system, which
“takes anybody who comes along,” by arguing that it lacks a sufficient nexus to the actual
Department of Navy free exercise needs – “the constitutional compelling purpose for the
Chaplaincy Corps.” Pls.’ Mot. at 41. Without this nexus, the plaintiffs argue, the Navy “cannot
show their means is narrowly tailored to the accomplishment of [the Chaplaincy Corps’]
function.” Id. The plaintiffs ask the court to declare the current system constitutionally invalid
and order the Navy to adopt a system tailored narrowly to the Navy’s actual free exercise needs.
The plaintiffs’ argument, as the court sees it, is this: under normal circumstances, the
government may not finance religious programs. The military context, however, constitutes an
exception to this general rule because accommodating the free exercise needs of military service
members is itself a “compelling interest.” Pls.’ Mot. at 41-42. To the plaintiffs, in applying the
traditional strict scrutiny analysis, the military’s accommodation of free exercise (the
“compelling interest” in the strict scrutiny analysis) must be narrowly tailored to survive
constitutional scrutiny. Id. In other words, the Navy is constitutionally permitted to operate a
military chaplaincy only if it can narrowly tailor its chaplaincy program to the purpose for its
creation – the actual free exercise needs of the military service. Id. The court does not share the
plaintiffs’ understanding.

Distinguishing Between Permissive and Mandatory Accommodation

Before evaluating the Navy’s chaplaincy program under the relaxed scrutiny standard set
forth in Goldman, the court takes a moment to highlight an inconsistency in the plaintiffs’
constitutional argument which permeates their claims and, ultimately, leads inexorably to its

failing. The plaintiffs argue vigorously that the Navy’s chaplaincy program serves a compelling
interest in satisfying the religious needs of Naval service members. Pls.’ Mot. at 6. But to the
plaintiffs, that chaplaincy program must be narrowly tailored to the free exercise needs of the
military service members it serves. The problem in this approach is that it equates the Navy’s
compelling interest in organizing a chaplaincy with a constitutional instruction requiring it. In
other words, the plaintiffs argument confuses that which the constitution permits and that which
it requires.
When the plaintiffs argue that the Navy’s chaplaincy satisfies a compelling purpose, they
speak of this compelling purpose not in permissibly accommodating the religious needs of the
Navy, but in satisfying the constitutional requirement that the Navy accommodate the religious
needs of its service members. See, e.g., Pls.’ Mot. at 43 (arguing that chaplaincy must meet “the
specific or expected Free Exercise needs of [Navy] personnel”). To be clear, the plaintiffs never
expressly argue that the Navy must establish a chaplaincy to accommodate the religious needs of
the Navy. But their arguments imply it.
The difference is crucial. If the Navy were constitutionally required to organize and
constitute a chaplaincy, so as to ensure the free exercise rights of its service members, then the
chaplaincy program would have to not only be narrowly tailored to the free exercise needs of the
Navy’s service members, it would have to be in relative synergy with it. Church of the Lukumi
Babalu Aye, Inc., 508 U.S. at 562 (noting that a proactive component of the Free Exercise clause
is to safeguard religious liberty, which “generally require[s] government to accommodate
religious differences”).

accommodate religious needs of its members via a chaplaincy program, the Navy’s program need
not satisfy every single service members’ free exercise need, but need only promote free exercise
through its chaplaincy program. The program is constitutionally sound if it simply works toward
accommodating those religious needs. See Arlin Adams, The Doctrine of Accommodation in the
Jurisprudence of the Religion Clauses, 37 DE PAUL L. REV . 317, 319 (1988) (discussing the
differences between permissive and mandatory religious accommodation).
To be sure, the court would evaluate how well the chaplaincy program accommodated the
service’s religious needs whether the chaplaincy was constitutionally required or constitutionally
permitted. But if the constitution required a military chaplaincy, a single service member’s lack
of access to clergy (or any religious need for that matter) would suffice in invalidating the
program as a whole. Likewise, if a chaplaincy were constitutionally required, the court would
invalidate the program on the suggestion that another means would accomplish greater free
exercise ends.
The plaintiffs cite Katcoff to support their claim that the Navy’s chaplaincy must be
narrowly tailored to the religious needs of Naval service members. Pls.’ Mot. at 19. In Katcoff,
the Second Circuit expressed its view that the constitution mandated a military chaplaincy.
Katcoff, 755 F.2d at 234. The court stated that if the military did not organize a chaplaincy, “the
effect of compulsory military service . . . would deprive the soldier of his right under the
Establishment Clause not to have religion inhibited and of his right under the Free Exercise
Clause to practice his freely chosen religion.” Id. For two reasons, the court avoids a direct
evaluation of this legal assertion. First, though the plaintiffs in Katcoff were not conscripted to
military service, the court qualified its exposition of constitutional rights to those serving in

“compulsory military service.”8 Id. Perhaps in compelled military service situations the
Supreme Court’s sanction of “the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to
the needs of the service,” Orloff, 345 U.S. at 92, would resound with less force. But because the
plaintiffs in the instant case are not conscripted service members arguing the subversion of their
religious freedoms, the court does not have occasion to evaluate the Katcoff court’s statement
regarding the constitutional requirements placed on the government in draft service situations.
Second, the plaintiffs do not expressly argue that the free exercise clause requires a
military chaplaincy. Without an explicit argument in this regard, the court does not opine as to
the constitutional dimensions of the chaplaincy on such sweeping terms. Mazer v. Stein, 347
U.S. 201, 206, n. 5 (1954) (noting that the court does not “reach for constitutional questions not
raised by the parties”).
According to the Navy, given the diversity of religious beliefs and geographic dispersion
of the military, it would be “impossible in any given military unit or community to provide a
chaplain for each faith group represented by its members.” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 15 at iv. The court
accepts the Navy’s assertions in this regard, see Orloff, 345 U.S. at 92, and the Navy’s arguments
convince the court in their own right that stationing a chaplain wherever a service member needs
one would be a logistical nightmare the execution of which would significancy and perpetually

With minor historic exceptions, however, our military is a volunteer organization. See
Holmes v. United States, 391 U.S. 936 (1968) (Douglas, J., dissenting in the denial of
certiorari) (recounting the history of conscripted military service in the United States).
In volunteering, military service members must understand and accept that “the military
‘is the executive arm’ whose ‘law is that of obedience.’” Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733,
749 (1974). The court sees no principled reason why this logic would not apply to
civilians who are attempting to gain admission into the military, one of its services, or a
specialized corps within one of those services.

strain military resources. For these various reasons, in evaluating the Navy’s chaplaincy
program, the court need not assess whether it is perfect in its accommodation of service
members’ free exercise needs, just whether it is sufficiently tailored to the Navy’s interest in
permissibly accommodating those religious needs.9
b.

The Navy’s Chaplaincy Program Satisfies the Goldman Standard

Under a relaxed standard of review, the court assesses whether “legitimate military ends
are sought to be achieved,” and whether the program “is designed to accommodate the individual
right to an appropriate degree.”10 Goldman, 475 U.S. at 505 (quoting Goldman v. Sec. of Def.,
734 F.2d 1531 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). Assessing the Navy’s current chaplain accession system under
this two part test, the court rules that it is constitutionally sound.
First, the court rules that the Navy’s chaplaincy system seeks “legitimate military ends.”11
Id. According to the government, supported by affidavit, the chaplaincy furthers the Navy’s
mission of national defense. Defs.’ Mot. at 28. Marine Brigadier General Joseph Dunford, for

9

In addition to confusing permissive and mandatory accommodation, the plaintiffs’
argument is not persuasive because it relies, at its core, on the application of strict
scrutiny. But as the court previously ruled, strict scrutiny analysis does not apply in this
case given the judicial deference accorded the military in decisions concerning military
affairs and the understanding that service in the military implies a measured reduction in
the rights of service members. See discussion infra at 21-28.

Justice O’Conner, dissenting in Goldman, lamented the majority’s holding because “[n]o
test for free exercise claims in the military context is even articulated, much less
applied.” Goldman, 475 U.S. at 528 (O’Conner, J., dissenting). Be that as it may, yet
seeking precedential guidance as to the applicable standard of review, the court applies
the legal test employed by the D.C. Circuit in its opinion in the case, which the Supreme
Court affirmed.

The plaintiff seemingly concedes this point by recognizing that the military chaplaincy
constitutes a compelling military interest. Pls.’ Mot. at 10. Nevertheless, the court’s
holding does not depend on this concession.

example, recognizes that the chaplaincy’s contribution to the military “directly influences the will
of the individual Marines to fight and the combat effectiveness of our units.” Id., Ex. 12 ¶ 2.
General Dunford continues that prior to deployment of Marines in the current imbroglio in Iraq,
“chaplains were essential in the development of combat leadership, combat stress training, family
readiness, and a wide range of other areas. Because chaplains participate in every aspect of unit
training, the contribution they make is truly immeasurable.” Id. He continues with a detailed
and thoroughly convincing assessment of the necessity of the Navy Chaplaincy Corps.
According to Department of Defense findings presented in its Study of Representation of
Religious Faiths in the Armed Forces, Navy Chaplains
[P]rovide for the religious and moral needs of military personnel, their families,
authorized Department of Defense civilians, and retired personnel, with primary
attention given to the welfare of the service member. They conduct services of
worship, administer rites and sacraments consistent with the chaplains’ faith group,
and provide a full range of religious activities. They serve as personal counselors and
as leaders in religious education and humanitarian services.
Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 15 at 3. With these statements, the court concludes that the Navy’s interest in
maintaining a chaplaincy is important, it is compelling, and therefore, at an irreducible minimum,
serves legitimate military ends. Goldman, 734 F.2d at 1535; Katcoff, 755 F.2d at 234.
The second prong of the court’s inquiry evaluates whether the program is “designed to
accommodate the individual right to an appropriate degree.” Goldman, 475 U.S. at 505. The
appropriate degree of accommodation depends, of course, on the military’s need for its program
and the compatibility of that program with individual needs. In Goldman, the Air Force’s strict
application of its dress code regulation in practice foreclosed any accommodation of individual
rights. But such absolute non-accommodation was constitutionally permissible, the court ruled,

because “the First Amendment does not require the military to accommodate such practices in
the face of its view that they would detract from the uniformity sought by the dress regulations.”
Id. at 508.
A review of the Navy’s current chaplaincy accession policy satisfies the court that it is
likewise “designed to accommodate the individual right to an appropriate degree.” Id. a 505.
Navy “[c]haplains help prepare and maintain sailors’ and marines’ ability to engage in combat
and other tactical, strategic, and operational missions, directly tying chaplains to the Navy’s
ability to defend the nation.” Defs.’ Mot. at 28. Under the current chaplaincy accession system,
the Navy assesses its current religious needs by “consideration of the particularized needs of its
individual units and installations.” Id. at 30. The Navy “strives to recruit chaplains of various
faith groups [and] does not . . . adhere to any quotas.” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 14 ¶ 11; Ex. 42 ¶ 4.
Instead, the Navy “aims to access only the best qualified applicants regardless of faith group.”
Id. “To determine if an applicant is the best qualified . . . a Chaplain Appointment and Recall
Eligibility Advisory Group (CARE Advisory Group) meets to consider the [applicant].” Id. The
religious denominations or faith group identification of individual applicants is “never a factor in
recommendations” of the CARE group for accessions. Id. Rather, the Navy bases its accession
system on many factors, including “the breadth of locations where Navy, Marine, and Cost Guard
personnel serve; the unique circumstances of Naval service, which involve personnel on ships
sailing all over the world; and the various functions and tasks of chaplain officers outside of
religious services.” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 16 at 3-4.

chaplain for each faith group represented by its members,” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 15 at iv, the Navy’s

use of a more relaxed hiring approach, which ignores faith group identifiers, seems reasonable
and justified. And given the importance of the Corps to the Navy’s needs, the current program
does what is possible under the circumstances to “accommodate the individual right to an
appropriate degree.” Goldman, 475 U.S. at 505.
c.

The Plaintiffs’ Suggested Alternative

The plaintiffs attempt to highlight the problems in the Navy’s program by suggesting an
alternative approach. The problem for the plaintiffs, however, is that they utterly fail in
suggesting a system which is equally effective at meeting the Navy’s needs while also being
more accommodating to the rights of either the individual plaintiffs of the average yeoman.
Coupling this difficulty with the court’s own inability to surmise a process better designed to
more closely accommodate individual interests, the court has no reason to reject the Navy’s
current approach in favor of another.
The Navy possesses a generalized interest in maintaining the Chaplaincy Corps and the
plaintiffs’ interest in competing for a position in that Corps is not directly or inherently in
conflict with the Navy’s interest. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs do not seek merely the opportunity
to compete for a position in the chaplaincy. Rather, they want to compete in a chaplaincy infused
with selection criterion of their choosing.
Under the plaintiffs’ proposal, the Navy should base its chaplain selection on the actual
religious demographics of the Navy.12 Pls.’ Mot. at 8. In this way, the plaintiffs suggest, the free

12

The plaintiffs characterize an accession system based on a blending of national religious
demographics and Navy religious demographics as “optimal,” but fail to explain how
such a blending ensures a better nexus between the chaplaincy and the religious needs of
the Navy than the current system. Pls.’ Mot. at 8.

exercise needs of the Navy service members will be better accommodated. Id. To the plaintiffs,
their approach would more closely tailor the Navy’s chaplaincy program to the purpose for its
creation (i.e., the free exercise needs of Naval service members). The plaintiffs’ approach is
itself flawed because it confuses religious demographics with religious need. This is so for three
principal reasons.
First, under the plaintiffs’ suggested plan, numerous religious service members would
have no access to clergy of their faith. For example, according to the Navy, “if less than .27
percent of personnel identify themselves as Muslim, proportional representation would require
that the Chaplain Corps be composed of only 2 Muslim chaplains. The dispersion of religious
needs across the Sea Services would indicate at least a requirement of 10 Muslim chaplains to
ensure access to a chaplain of this tradition in every major geographical area.” Defs.’ Mot. Ex.
14 at 6. In short, according to the Navy, “[s]trict proportionality does not consider effectively the
distribution and dispersion challenges of the Sea Services.” Id.
Second, the plaintiffs suggestion fails to account for the complexities and variations of
religious worship among religions generally and between individual parishioners specifically.
Corresponding the chaplaincy’s composition to precise demographics assumes that religions each
maintain an equal need for chaplains of that particular faith. The Navy characterizes this issue as
“faith specific liturgical and religious requirements.” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 15 at v. Simply put, the
plaintiffs’ plan assumes that individual religious adherents share the same level of religious
practice and, therefore, need for clergy. The Navy has found, by contrast, that the disparities in
beliefs and practices “make it impossible to effectuate a perfect match between chaplains of faith
group clusters and the needs of sea service personnel and their families.” Id., Ex. 14 at 4

(recognizing that “military personnel and their families who identify themselves as belonging to a
particular religious tradition may or may not adhere as rigidly to the specific dogma of their
stated religious denomination”).
Third, the plaintiffs’ recommended scheme presumes that clergy from one religious
denomination are unable to cater to the religious needs of a service member from a different
religious denomination. According to the Navy, however, “Protestant chaplains usually find . . .
that they can serve Protestants from many denominations by incorporating elements of worship
generally acceptable to Protestants.” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 15 at 6. For Roman Catholics, by contrast,
worship requirements and specific sacramental ministry “must be met by priests within the
Roman Catholic faith group category.” Id.
To summarize, a chaplaincy program which accurately accounts for the religious needs of
the Navy (which is what the plaintiffs seek) would have to account for the various duty locations
of religious service members, the religious needs of their religion generally, the religious needs
of the service members specifically, and the level of accommodation that a clergy member of a
different denomination, or faith for that matter, could serve to that service members. The Navy
suggests that such a detailed analysis would unnecessarily “assign the Court the role of
monitoring [the Navy’s chaplaincy program] to ensure that accessions matched Navy
demographics.” Defs.’ Mot. at 20. The court agrees.
If the court ordered the Navy to create a new accession system which accounted for these
various complicating factors, the resulting Chaplaincy program would likely involve substantial
government entanglement with religion, requiring the Navy to conduct routine surveys and
studies into the religious habits and interests of its service members. See Pls.’ Mot. at 44

(praying for the court to order the Navy to establish “objective criteria and procedures to identify
[the Navy’s] free exercise needs in the context of Defendants’ operational requirements, and a
plan to ensure the [chaplaincy] structure is focused on those needs and maintained through
adequate accession plans”); see also, Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 18 at I-8 & I-9. Such entanglement would
itself be susceptible to significant constitutional challenge. See, e.g., Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S.
402, 413 (1985), rev’d on other grounds, (noting that “pervasive monitoring by public authorities
. . . infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of
excessive entanglement”).
Regarding practical considerations, the Navy concluded that “the need for chaplains is not
directly related to the number of adherents to denominations included under the umbrella of a
faith group category.” Defs.’ Mot. at 30 (citing Ex. 15 at I-6). Instead, the Navy has “learned
that in providing for the free exercise of religion, [it] must consider units or installations, rather
than individuals or broad statistical representation, as the primary criterion in being able to serve
the cumulative total of individual requirements most effectively.” Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 15 at I-6.
Having considered the issue in depth and concluded that it is impractical to consider
individual religious needs or broad statistical representations, the Navy’s determination is
entitled to deference by the court. Goldman, 475 U.S. at 508 (asserting that the court’s must give
“great deference to the ‘professional judgment of military authorities’”). The Navy’s current
system does not beget a chaplaincy that is perfectly tailored to the free exercise needs of the
Navy. Such a tailoring, however, is, according to the Navy, impossible to achieve. And given
the relaxed scrutiny applicable in cases in the military context, it is also not constitutionally
required.
