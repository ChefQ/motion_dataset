PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
FOLLOWING REMAND ADDRESSING DEFENDANTS’ DENOMINATIONAL
PREFERENCE IN RETAINING CATHOLIC CHAPLAINS ON ACTIVE DUTY PAST
THEIR STATUTORY SEPARATION AGES
In accord with the Court’s Order consolidating all chaplain cases, all plaintiffs in the
above case submit this motion renewing the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. Winter and
Adair v. Winter 2003 Motion for an Injunction following remand from the Court of Appeals in
Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Their
memorandum of points and authorities provided herein shows they are entitled to an injunction
because the defendants’ practice of continuing Catholic chaplains past their statutorily separation
ages to enable them to qualify for retirement pay is an unconstitutional preference and contrary to
statutory limitations limiting the time service personnel may remain on active military service.
In accord with Local Civil Rule 7(m), counsel for the parties discussed this motion and
defendants’ counsel stated they will oppose this motion.

INTRODUCTION
All the plaintiffs in the above now consolidated case move the court for an order: (1)
enjoining defendants from continuing their unconstitutional preference for Catholics manifested
in their policy and practice1 of allowing Catholic chaplains to remain on active duty past their
statutory separation age for the purpose of qualifying for retired pay; 2) enjoining further
violations by (a) stopping defendants’ preferential retention practice and (b) requiring defendants
to comply strictly with DOD instructions concerning classification of retired personnel; and (3)
requiring defendants to remedy the constitutional and statutory violation by complying with the
discharge statutes. The Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. Winter and Adair v. Winter,
(CFGC /Adair) plaintiffs renew their original motion for such relief.
Because the law of the case holds that “a party alleging a violation of the Establishment
Clause per se satisfies the irreparable injury requirement of the preliminary injunction calculus”,
Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, (“CFGC”), 454 F.3d 290, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2006),
this motion focuses on the other three injunction criteria.
BACKGROUND
In 2003, defendants produced evidence in discovery establishing their practice of
allowing Roman Catholic Reserve chaplains, and only Roman Catholics, to remain on active
duty past the statutory separation ages for Reserve officers. At the time, 10 U.S.C. § 14509
established the separation age for Reserve officers at 60. Based on defendants’ production of
documents, plaintiffs identified 23 Reserve Catholic chaplains retained on active duty past age 60
1

Whether the course of conduct challenged here is called a practice, a pattern and
practice, or a policy is immaterial. Plaintiffs refer to the challenged conduct or actions as a
“practice”, one that has existed well over a decade.

to acquire the necessary 20 years time in service (“TIS”) to qualify for retirement pay. Seven of
these were LTs and LCDRs over age 67, four of whom were in their 70s. The seven chaplains
over age 67 were given the status “4109", meaning Retired Reservist, although none of the 4109
chaplains met any of DOD’s criteria for Retired Reserve.
In June 2003, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary or structural injunction to (1) stop
the above denominational preferential practice, (2) enjoin further violations and (3) require
defendants to remedy the statutory violation by complying with the discharge statutes. Plaintiffs
argued they met the four criteria for an injunction. First, plaintiffs would prevail on the merits of
their claim because (1) the practice constituted a denominational preference subjecting it to strict
scrutiny, and (2) defendants would fail strict scrutiny because the defendants ability to hire
contract clergy or auxiliary chaplains if they were needed showed the practice was not narrowly
tailored to meet a compelling government objective. Second, defendants’ First Amendment
violation, “for even minimal periods of time [] results in irreparable harm.” Elrod v. Burns, 427
U.S. 347, 373 (1976). Third, the injunction placed no burden on defendants because they were
required to follow the law and the Constitution, there were legal alternatives available to meet the
needs of Catholics, and the challenged chaplains would suffer no harm because they had been
commissioned with age waivers requiring them to acknowledge they would not qualify for
retirement pay. Fourth, requiring the military to follow the law was in the public interest.
Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary and Structural Injunction and Partial Summary Judgment
(the “Inj Mot”), CFGC Docket No. 142 (incorporated by reference).
In the alternative, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment because plaintiffs were entitled
to judgement as a matter of law. Id.

The Court denied plaintiffs’ Inj. Mot., holding plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm
because Elrod did not apply to Establishment Clause violations; Plaintiffs appealed.
On July 9, 2006, the D.C. Circuit reversed, holding that Elrod’s rule did apply to alleged
Establishment Clause violations and “a party alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause per
se satisfies the irreparable injury requirement of the preliminary injunction calculus.” CFGC,
454 F.3d at 304. The DC. Circuit remanded to the District Court the question whether plaintiffs
satisfied the remaining three criteria. Id.
On October 20, 2006, as the parties were preparing a briefing schedule to address the
remand issue, the Court stayed the CFGC/Adair case pending the D.C. Circuit’s resolution of
Miller v. Secretary of Navy, 476 F.3d 936 (D.C. Cir. 2007), an unrelated case. Plaintiffs moved
for an order clarifying or lifting the stay because of the uncertainty as to when Miller would be
decided and a stay was incompatible with the purpose of an injunction. CFGC Doc. No. 237.
Defendants opposed. The Court denied the motion to lift the stay as moot, January 24, 2007,
after release of the Miller decision. The parties proposed and the Court approved a briefing

On June 18, 2007, the Court denied the Gibson v. U.S. Navy plaintiffs’ motion to
retransfer their case to the Northern District of Florida, consolidated all the chaplain cases into a
new case with the above citation, denied all pending motions without prejudice because the
pending motions affected the new parties’ rights, and invited the parties to resubmit their

THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING
Defendants previously argued the CFGC/Adair plaintiffs had no standing because no
named plaintiff was on active duty. Defendants’ 3/9/02 Remand Opening Brief (“DefOpBr”) at
7-12, Defendants’ 5/1/07 Remand Reply (#257)(“Def.RR”) at 5-8. Plaintiffs showed that this
Court had specifically found CFGC had standing as a representational plaintiff and could seek
prospective and injunctive relief. CFGC /Adair Remand Reply (“Pl.Rem.Reply’) at 8-11.
The Gibson plaintiffs include active duty chaplains, e.g., Gibson, Demy and Stewart.
Consequently they suffer direct irreparable injury resulting from defendants’ Establishment
Clause violations. See CFGC, 454 F.3d at 304. There can be no doubt as to plaintiffs’ standing.
RECENT OR CURRENT EVENTS BEARING ON THIS MOTION
DefOpBr Exhibit 1identified six current Navy Catholic chaplains with a status of 4109,
none of whom had qualified for retired pay because they did not have the required TIS. One of
those, LCDR Erestain, now stationed at Bethesda Naval Hospital, will retire at the end of July at
age 70, 10 years past the age at which he should have been separated. DefOpBr Exhibit 1
incorrectly shows his retirement eligibility as 2008. He makes the fourth 4109 allowed to
illegally obtain a pension in their 70s since plaintiffs filed the original injunction motion in 2003.
Plaintiffs took the depositions of Mr. Thomas Bush and Mr. Samuel Wyvill, whose
declarations tried to justify the “Honorary Retiree” program which allegedly allow the 4109s to
be “retired” without 20 years TIS and then recalled to active duty. Both admitted: (1) the
applicable Department of Defense (DOD) directives and instructions mandate the Secretary of
Navy to place all Reserve personnel into Reserve Component Categories defined by DOD
including the Retired Reserve; (2) DOD defines only 5 Retired Reserve categories, all of which
4

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 13 of 55

are defined in terms of eligibility for retired pay or entitlement to disability due to active service;
(3) there is no category for those not entitled to retired pay, i.e., no Honorary Retiree category.
Consequently, this motion’s injunctive request also seeks an order requiring the Secretary to
comply with DOD’s instructions concerning retired categories.
STANDARD FOR AN INJUNCTION
To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show (1) a
substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable
injury if the injunction were not granted, (3) that an injunction would not
substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that the public interest would
be furthered by the injunction. E.g., Mova Pharm. Corp., 140 F.3d 1060, 1066
(D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting City Fed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58
F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
CFGC, 454 F.3d at 297. Plaintiffs have met this criteria, both in 2003 and today in 2007.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
This Memorandum shows plaintiffs have met all the criteria for an injunction. First,
plaintiffs will succeed on their Establishment and Due Process Clause violation claims because
the challenged practice is a clear denominational preference for which there is no compelling
purpose or narrow tailoring and does not treat all chaplains equally. Even if such a purpose
existed, defendants’ pattern and practice is not narrowly tailored because alternatives exist
allowing defendants to meet the free exercise needs of DON’s Catholic personnel. The
challenged practice also fails the endorsement and Lemon tests because it communicates an
unmistakable message that Catholics are preferred and have a favored place in the Navy Chaplain
Corps (“CHC”) and the Navy.
Second, the Court of Appeals has already held that plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm
by alleging defendants have violated the Establishment Clause. CFGC, 454 F.3d at 304.
5

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Page 14 of 55

Third, an injunction will not harm defendants or interfere with their mission of meeting
free exercise needs of DON personnel because no harm results from following the Constitution
and defendants have established viable alternatives that are readily available. Navy directives
order commanders to hire contract clergy or auxiliary chaplains where free exercise needs exist.
This option has met defendants’ need for Catholic clergy and other faith group specific needs in
the past when specific chaplains were not available to meet them.
Fourth, ordering the Navy to follow the Constitution is in the public interest. The
Establishment Clause’s purpose is to preclude the divisiveness, animosity, factionalism and strife
that follows religious favoritism preferring one religion over another. Courts have the
constitutional authority and duty to confine other branches of government within their
constitutional and statutory limits.

THE UNDISPUTED FACTS AND EVIDENCE SHOW DEFENDANTS HAVE
BEEN OPERATING A SPECIAL PENSION PLAN SOLELY FOR CATHOLIC
CLERGY, A CLEAR DENOMINATIONAL PREFERENCE
The Following Facts Are Undisputed

1.

In 2003, 10 U.S.C. § 14509 “Separation at age 60; reserve officers in grades below

brigadier general or real admiral (lower half)”, (Exhibit 1, see comment on 2006 amendments at
page 1), stated:
Each reserve officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps in a grade below
brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half) who has not been recommended for
promotion to the grade of brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half) and is not a
member of the Retired Reserve shall, on the last day of the month in which that officer
becomes 60 years of age, be separated in accordance with section 14515 of this title.

2.

Amendments to 10 U.S.C. § 14509 changed the age for separation from 60 to 62. Id.

From May 1986 to 2005, SECNAVISNT 1120.4A (Exhibit 2), ¶ 6 established the “Basic

qualifications” for appointment as a chaplain, including age:
6.
Basic qualifications. To be eligible for appointment as a Chaplain Corps
officer in either the active-duty or Reserve components…, the applicant must
meet the following requirements:
***
b. Age. Must be able to complete 20 years of active commissioned service
by age 60. The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, and
Training) (DCNO(MPT)) may waive the age restrictions up to age 62 for
otherwise qualified applicants for appointment on the active duty list or in the
Reserve component in [four] instances:
4.

When plaintiffs filed their injunction motion in June 2003, defendants had a pattern and

practice allowing Catholic Reserve chaplains to remain on active duty past 10 U.S.C. § 14509's
mandatory separation from military service at age 60 for Reserve officers.
a.

At least 23 Catholic Reserve chaplains over age 60 were on active duty in June

2003, all of whom were on the active duty list (“ADL”); none were on the Reserve Active Status
List (“RASL”) because the lists are mutually exclusive. Inj Mot Exhibits 8, 12.
b..

Seven of the 23 Catholic chaplains over age 60 were 67 or older, four of whom

were in their 70s.
c.

The vast majority of chaplains allowed to stay on active duty past their statutory

separation ages are Catholics. “Does the Data Establish that the U.S. Navy Favors Roman
Catholics?”, Expert Opinion by Harald R. Leuba, PhD. (Exhibit 3) at 2 and Table 1; 6, Tables 45. No Protestant liturgical or Non-liturgical chaplains, Reserve or Regular, were allowed to
remain on active duty as a 4109.
5.

In 2003 there was no authority to extend Reserve officers on active duty beyond § 14509's

age 60 limitation. 10 U.S.C. § 14703, the only authority for extending Reserve officers who had

not failed of selection to Commander and above, applied to Reserve officers on the RASL which
excludes officers on the ADL. Inj Mot at 6 (incorporated by reference).
6.

The seven Catholic chaplains over age 67 were given the status “4109", which is a Navy

personnel status code for “Retired Reserve.”
7.

No 4109 had the necessary 20 years time in service (“TIS”) to qualify for retired pay

when given their 4109 status. Inj Mot at 8-9 and its FACTS 2-7.
8.

No 4109 fit into any DOD defined Retired Reserve category. Fact No. 23 infra.

9.

Prior to 2001, there was no statutory authority to extend or continue on active duty

Reserve chaplains who had twice FOS. See Inj Mot Reply at 6.
a.

Section 632 provided for the continuation of regulars who had twice FOS;

b.

§ 14101 provided authority to continue on the RASL Reservists who had twice

FOS; Inj Mot Reply, 13-15;
c.

No statute allowed for Reservists who had twice FOS to be continued on active

duty until a statutory change in 2001; Id.;
d.

Defendants provided no evidence any of the Reserve chaplains retained past age

60 had ever been validly continued by a board authorized to extend Reservists on active
duty.
10.

All of the 4109s, past and current, entered active duty with age waivers. SECNAVINST

1140.7A requires persons granted age waivers acknowledge “[b]efore appointment” they “will be
unable to complete 20 years of creditable service for retirement ....” ¶ 6.b.
11.

OPNAVINST 1730.1D (Exhibit 4) requires commanders to employ civilian clergy when

necessary to meet the command’s free exercise needs. This OPNAVINST replaced

SECNAVINST 1730.G as the authority to employ civilian clergy when necessary to meet the
command’s free exercise needs.
12.

10 U.S.C. § 1251(a) establishes 62 as the normal retirement age for Regular officers.
a.

§ 1251(c)(2) allows the Secretary to “defer retirement under subsection (a) of an

officer who was appointed or designated as a chaplain if the Secretary determines that
such deferral is in the best interest of the military department concerned ....”;
b.

§ 1251(c)(3)(A) limits “deferment under this subsection” to “the first of the month

following the month in which the officer becomes 68 years of age”, unless the exception
in subsection (B) applies;
c.

§ 1251(c)(3)(B) allows the Secretary to “extend deferment under this subsection

beyond the date referred to in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that extension
of the deferment is necessary for the needs of the military department concerned. Such an
extension shall be made on a case-by-case basis and shall be for such period as the
Secretary considers appropriate.”
13.

No statute allows the Secretary to authorize a chaplain to remain on active duty past age

67 for the purpose of qualifying for retired pay, i.e., obtaining a pension.
14.

The challenged 4109 chaplains and other Catholics continued past their separation ages,

past and present, qualify for a pension only by remaining on active duty past their statutory
separation ages.
15.

Prior to 2006, few non-Catholic have been allowed to remain on active duty past their

required separation age.

service to qualify for a pension in 2007. One, LCDR Erestain, will retire July 2007. See
DefOpBr Exhibit 1, p. 2.

Since the Inj Mot was filed in 2003, defendants granted two new Catholic chaplains 4109

II.

PLAINTIFFS WILL SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIM
DEFENDANTS’ 4109 PROGRAM VIOLATES THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE
Defendants’ practice maintaining Catholic chaplains on active duty past their statutory

separation ages to qualify for retired pay, hereafter the “4109 Program”, violates every
Establishment Clause test. This practice is and has been exclusively for Catholics since only
Catholic chaplains (1) have consistently been continued past statutory separation ages and (2) are
designated as 4109s to qualify them for retired pay, making the 4109 Program a per se
denominational preference.
The 4109 Program has three components described below, each employing a clear
denominational preference. Each part of the 4109 Program fails strict scrutiny, the threepronged test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), and the reasonable observer test which
the Supreme Court has used frequently to evaluate whether a challenged program communicates
a message of favoritism or preference. See McCreary Co. v. ACLU of Kentucky, 545 U.S. 844,
125 S.Ct. 2722, 2740 (2005) (defining and applying the reasonable observer test). These tests are
addressed below. Failing these tests renders immaterial the question whether a valid statutory
basis for defendants’ Catholic pension system exists.
A.

Each of the 4109 Program’s Three Parts Demonstrates a Denominational
Preference

The 4109 Program has three separate components enabling Catholic chaplains accessed
or brought to active duty with age waivers to qualify for retired pay because they cannot reach
the necessary TIS before statutory separation due to age. The first is an illegal system to bring
chaplains on active duty who cannot complete 20 years TIS before statutory separation. This
11

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 20 of 55

includes illegal age waivers and recalls to active duty.
SECNAVISNT 1120.4A’s ¶ 6.b established a maximum age of 42 for chaplain applicants
providing the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations granted a waiver beyond the normal age
limitation of 40. Age 40 enabled a reservist to qualify for retired pay with 20 years TIS before §
14509 mandated his separation at age 60. The age 42 maximum corresponded to the normal
separation age for Regulars but also allowed a reservist to achieve 18 years TIS because § 12686
allowed “Reserve or active duty within two years of retirement eligibility” to continue on active
duty for an additional two years until he qualified for retired pay. SECNAVISNT 1120.4A
provided no authority to exceed the age 42 upper limit.
CARE board records and Vol. X biographical data show defendants operated an
unofficial policy to grant age waivers beyond age 42 without authority to do so. Exhibit 8 is a
list of chaplains accessed and/or brought to active duty from FY86-01 at ages which will not
allow them to get 18 years TIS before they had to be separated at age 60. This unofficial policy
was primarily for Catholics until FY2001 when chaplain shortages forced the CHC to provide
more non-liturgical clergy age waivers.
Exhibit 9, the total number of age waivers and percentages by FGC from FY 86 to FY982001, shows non-Catholics are a minority (8%), non-liturgicals are a super minority (4%, one
half that of Liturgical Protestants) with Catholics comprising 85-90% of the waivers. Exhibit 9
also shows the percentage of Catholic age waivers in three categories: (a) age 42-46, -about 38%
- a Catholic could get 20 years TIS without needing to become a 4109 at age 67; (b) age 47-56 about 53% - a Catholic would spend half his 20 year career as a 4109; and (c) age 57 and above about 7% - more than ten years as a 4109. Over half of the Catholics accessed or brought to
12

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 21 of 55

active duty with age waivers were over age 46 requiring they be granted 4109 status to complete
20 years TIS to obtain retired pay. This is itself a denominational preference
The second component is an illegal policy continuing Catholic Reservists on active duty
who should have been separated at age 60, now age 62. Material defendants provided in
discovery shows only Catholic Reservists were allowed to continue on active duty past age 60.
Inj Mot Exhibits 8-12. Many of these were LTs and LCDRs who had failed of selection and
were not qualified to be continued until age 67 under 10 U.S.C. § 14507.
The third component is the process of designating as 4109s Catholic Reservists who have
not qualified for retired pay at age 67, contrary to DOD’s Directives and Instructions. Only
Catholic Reservists ineligible for retired pay have been designated 4109s.
B.

Strict Scrutiny of the 4109 Program Is Mandated

“When a denominational preference is at issue, Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982),
supplies the analytic framework for evaluation of [plaintiffs’] contentions. Larson teaches that,
when it is claimed that a denominational preference exists, the initial inquiry is whether the law
facially differentiates among religions.” Hernandez v. C.I.R., 490 U.S. 680, 695 (1989);
Children's Healthcare Is a Legal Duty, Inc. v. Min De Parle, 212 F.3d 1084, 1090 (8th Cir.
2000), cert denied, 532 US 957 (2001) (“In considering appellants' facial challenge, we initially
must determine whether section 4454 discriminates among religious sects. If so, we apply strict
scrutiny review under Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982)”). Strict scrutiny is not limited to
alleged statutory denominational preferences. “On the contrary we have expressly required ‘strict
scrutiny’ of practices suggesting ‘a denominational preference,’ Larson, 456 U.S. at 246, in
keeping with ‘the unwavering vigilance that the Constitution requires’ against any violation of

the Establishment Clause.” County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. 573, 608-09 (1989)(quoting Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 623 (1988) (O’Connor, J. concurring) (emphasis added)). The law of
this case follows Hernandez and County of Allegheny: strict scrutiny applies to any challenged
practice Plaintiffs can demonstrate “suggests a denominational preference.” Adair v. England,
217 F.Supp.2d 9, 14-15 (D.D.C. 2003).
Ignoring the law of the case, defendants’ recent CFGC/Adair injunction briefing
suggested a decision in Larsen v. U.S. Navy, 486 F.Supp.2d 11 (D.D.C. 2007), applying the
relaxed standard of Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503 (1986), should apply. Def.RR (CFGC
Doc. No. 257) at 18. Larsen is inappropriate; it did not review a denominational preference
because Larsen found those plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the denominational
preferences established in defendants’ Thirds Policy accession goals. This Court’s well reasoned
analysis specifically rejected the Goldman standard in denying in part defendants’ motion to
dismiss, finding Goldman addressed the “Free Exercise Clause”, not the Establishment Clause.
Adair v. England, 183 F.Supp.2d 31, 50-52 (D.D.C. 2002); see also Goldman, 475 U.S. at 504
(“Goldman contends that the Free Exercise Clause ....”) (cited by Adair, 183 F.Supp.2d at 51),
509 (same quote). Adair correctly holds the Supreme Court has never allowed any reduced
standard for Establishment Clause cases, 183 F.Supp.2d at 52, following but not citing this
Circuit’s precedent.
The D.C. Circuit has made it clear that Lemon or strict scrutiny is the law of the Circuit,
regardless whether Congress, the military or some other form of government is accused of
violating the Establishment Clause. “The touchstone for evaluating church-state relations under
the Establishment Clause, is the test enunciated by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman.”

United Christian Scientists v. First Church of Christ Scientist, 829 F.2d 1152, 1161 (D.C. Cir.
1987). No intervening decision has changed this Rule. United Christian Scientists is especially
instructive and controlling because it reviewed a law passed under the Constitution’s plenary
grant of exclusive patent and copyright authority to Congress in Article 1, § 8, clause 8. The
same section, clauses 11-16, contains Congress’s authority to organize and regulate the Armed
Forces. While courts often defer to Congress’s authority in such special areas, United Christian
Scientists did not defer, applied Lemon and held Congress violated the Establishment Clause by
granting to one branch of the Christian Science Church exclusive control over its primary
doctrinal publication. 829 F.2d at 1154, 1168, 1171.
United Christian Scientists held Lemon’s approach was mandated, id. at 1161. It then
distinguished between Larson’s strict scrutiny of facial discrimination among religions and
Lemon’s tri-part test, which was “intended to apply to laws affording a uniform benefit to all
religions, not to provisions like the statute in [Larson] that discriminate among religions.” Id. at
1163 n. 49 (quoting Larson, 456 U.S. at 252). United Christian Scientists applied Lemon rather
than Larson only because strict scrutiny had not been briefed or raised by the parties in the
district court. Id. It found none of Congress’s proffered concerns for the law were “clearly
secular,” id. at 1165, Congress had fused civil and religious power, and placed its “official stamp
of approval” on one set of religious views. Id. at 1165-66. If “Congress ... may not exceed the
bounds of benevolent neutrality toward religion”, id. at 1166, defendants may not do so either.
The Supreme Court has not confronted an Establishment Clause challenge to a military
practice. However Anderson v. Laird, 466 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir.), cert denied, 409 U.S. 1076
(1972), did so, reviewing the constitutionality of the Service Academies’ mandatory chapel
15

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

requirements for all cadets and midshipmen. The District Court had deferred to the Academies’
military expertise arguments, id. at 285 ("the court accorded great weight to the opinions and
judgments of the military personnel concerned with officer training”), 290, 293 (“deference to the
unique role of the military in our society”), but the D.C. Circuit rejected deference as
incompatible with the Establishment Clause. Id. at 285 (“These regulations ... exceed the
constitutionally permitted scope of governmental power.”), 290 (“This principle was mistaken
by the District Court”), 293 (“language of the regulations reveals” Establishment Clause
violation). Anderson does not cite Lemon because Lemon was decided 20 days after Anderson’s
oral argument. However, Anderson’s analysis follows Lemon’s, as seen in the opinions by both
Judges Bazelon and Leventhal, including discussion and application of the “purpose and effect
test” developed in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 453 (1961); Torcaso v. Watkins, 367
U.S. 488, 489-90 (1961); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 424 (1962), and others, Anderson, 461
F.2d at 291-93, and replicated in Lemon’s first two tests.
Anderson recognized that religious issues did “not involve programs vital to our
immediate national security, or even to military operations or disciplinary procedures” and held
“it is for this Court to assess that decision [to require mandatory chapel participation] in
constitutional terms.” Id. at 296. Rejecting the District Court’s holding “that all First
Amendment rights must bend when they conflict with military interests,” Anderson held “[t]he
Supreme Court’s interpretations of the Establishment Clause refer to no overriding secular
interests which could ever justify a government’s imposition of those religious activities which
the Clause was written to abolish.” Id. at 290. Judge Leventhal’s concurrence found no military
necessity justifying an establishment of religion, id. at 297, or a compelling government purpose,

to the requirement the government show its “interest is compelling”).

Defendants’ Pension Qualification Program for Overage Catholic Chaplains
Fails Strict Scrutiny

The 4109 Program, allowing Catholic chaplains whom Title 10 required and requires to
be separated to remain on active duty to qualify for retired pay, is a “denominational preference
on its face” because it has been limited to Catholics. With the recent exception for a rabbi, well
after the Inj Mot was filed and remanded by CFGC, no other denomination benefitted or benefits
from defendants’ challenged practice, because no other denomination has been included in
defendants’ overage chaplain pension program. Defendants’ practice has clearly said, “Only
Catholics need apply.”
Strict scrutiny assumes a practice is unconstitutional and places the burden on the
defendant to show the practice is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental
purpose. Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa v. Michigan Gaming Control
Board, 276 F.3d 876, 879 (7th Cir.) (“We start by presuming the statute is unconstitutional.
Detroit can overcome that presumption by proving that the ordinance is necessary to serve a
compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.”), cert denied, 536 U.S.
923 (2002). Defendants can show neither.
1.

The 4109 Program has no compelling purpose

The CHC’s purpose is to enable DON personnel to “exercise their right under the Free
Exercise Clause to practice [their] freely chosen religion”, Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F.2d at 223, 234

[I]f the [DON] prevented [its personnel] from worshiping ... by removing them to
areas where religious leaders of their persuasion and facilities were not available it
could be accused of violating the Establishment Clause unless it provided them
with a chaplaincy since its conduct would amount to inhibiting religion.
Id. at 232. The question before the Court is how does defendants’ practice of allowing only
Catholic chaplains to remain on active duty past their statutory separation age advance or meet
the statutory and constitutional purpose for a Chaplain Corps? If defendants based this program
on specific identified free exercise needs, complied with existing statutory and regulatory
procedures, and made this program available to all denominations based on specific objective
criteria, this case would be entirely different. Defendants have never done these things. The
purpose of this challenged practice is evident in its structure and exclusivity: to prefer, advance
and benefit Catholic chaplains by providing overage Catholic priests a pension program.
Defendants have produced no documents or testimony explaining why only Catholics
must be continued on active duty until they acquire the necessary TIS to qualify for retired pay,
well past the statutory age separation age limits Congress determined in the Defense Officer
Personnel Management Act of 1980 (“DOPMA”) were necessary to keep the Armed Forces fit.
See 1980 U.S. Code and Congressional Administrative News (USCCAN ), 6333, 6337-39
(explaining DOPMA’s purpose to provide for a young, fit officer corps). Defendants cannot
provide a compelling purpose under either the old (pre CFGC) or the current regulatory scheme.
Assuming arguendo the compelling purpose is to meet Catholic religious free exercise
needs, several questions must be answered to verify the veracity of the disputed claim and

purpose. First, are DON’s Catholics suffering a shortage of Catholic priests? In other words, are
DON’s Catholics worse off than their civilian counterparts? The answer is NO! DON’s
Catholics do better than civilian Catholics. Dr. Leuba’s analysis, “Too Many Catholic Priests?”
(Exhibit 10), comparing national civilian religious demographic data with military religious data
shows DON’s Catholics actually have one half the priest-parishioner ratio civilian Catholics face.
Catholic priests are about 9% of all civilian clergy, but are about 25% of the CHC. Leuba at 1.
The ratio of Catholic clergy to those served is also “twice as high for Catholics in the Navy as for
Catholics in America at large.” Id. at 4. Dr. Leuba’s analysis is based on data produced by the
annual Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, a well recognized source of religious
demographic information. Dr Leuba examined four perspectives of the issue, id., 1-4, and in
each case, DON’s Catholics do better than their civilian counterparts.
Second, do defendants have a program that can identify and quantify DON’s free exercise
needs? Again the answer is NO! An October 1999 (fiscal year 2000) “Study on Religious
Affiliation in the Department of Navy,” (Exhibit 5) admitted “The Chaplain Corps has never
conducted an in depth study of the religious affiliation of members in the Navy and Marine
Corps,” id. at 2 (3d page of document). Defendants do not identify officer faith group
preferences3, id. at pg.4.
Third, are there any other options or resources to meet or minimize the professed need?
This question concerns or overlaps the “narrow tailoring” requirement but is also related to the

Defendants provided some data in discovery which was supposed to be Navy officer
faith group preferences, but the numbers did not add up and made no sense. Defendants were
asked to explain the numbers provided but have yet to do so or provide accurate officer
preference data.

“purpose” issue since other options would show there is no compelling purpose for this
challenged practice. Here the answer is Yes! When the Inj Mot was filed, SECNAVINST
1730.G provided commands authority to employ contract civilian clergy or auxiliary chaplains
when necessary to meet the command’s free exercise needs. OPNAVIST 1730.1D (Exhibit 4)
replaced SECNAVINST 1730.3G. 1730.1D’s ¶ 5.e.(5), “Religious Ministry Requirements”,
directs commanders ((g) “Commanders shall”) to hire contract clergy or auxiliary chaplains to
provide religious services when no chaplain is available to meet a specific free exercise need.
Assuming arguendo defendants had a valid secular objective, this “valid secular objective can be
readily accomplished by other means.” Larkin v. Grendel’s Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116, 123-24
(1982).
Moreover, these retained chaplains are not filling operational billets in Iraq or
Afghanistan, they occupy places where civilian clergy are readily available to meet DON’s
Catholic needs. For example, LCDR Erestain is stationed at Bethesda Naval Hospital where
many Catholic priests are available in the surrounding community.
2.

The 4109 Program fails strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly
tailored to achieve a compelling government purpose

To be narrowly tailored means that the practice or means defendants are using to
achieve their compelling governmental purpose is so constructed and conducted that it does not
endanger or invite any of the abuses which the Establishment Clause was designed to prohibit.
Narrowly tailored also means that the procedure used is neutral, neither favoring nor disfavoring
any denomination or system of beliefs. Defendants’ practice cannot meet this test because it
favors only one denomination and disparages others as part of its normal practice, does not treat

20

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Page 29 of 55

all religious groups equally, and there are alternatives available that do not require a practice
which communicates denominational preference or provides financial support to a single
denomination. The reasonable observer, see E infra, would recognize the need to hire a religious
person to perform a religious ceremony to meet a free exercise need. The requirement to hire
contract clergy under OPNAVINST 1730.1D to met free exercise needs shows the 4109 Program
is not narrowly tailored because it is not focused to meet specific needs. Instead, separating nonliturgical and Liturgical Protestant chaplains in the face of chaplain shortages, e.g., plaintiffs CHs
Belt and Porter-Stewart for FOS while retaining FOS Catholics who had longer to serve to get to
retirement than some of those discharged, shows defendants’ practice clearly communicates a
preference for Catholics and hostility to non-Catholics as shown below.
Larson examined the legislative history of a statute challenged under the Establishment
Clause that required registration for some churches but not others. 456 U.S. at 230-34. It found
“that the italicized language [of the statute in question] would bring a Roman Catholic
Archdiocese within the Act, that the legislators did not want the amendment to have that effect,
and that an amendment deleting the italicized clause was passed in committee for the sole
purpose of exempting the Archdiocese from the provisions of the Act.” Id. at 254. The Court
described this as “religious gerrymandering”. Id. at 255. The statute’s “express design [was] to
burden or favor selected religious denominations,” and was “not closely fitted to the furtherance
of any compelling governmental interest.” The Court found the statute and government were not
neutral and the statute violated the Establishment Clause. Id. That is the case here.
This case is like Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687 (1994), which
found the state’s creation of a special school district for a village whose citizens were all Satmar
21

Jews violated the Establishment Clause. Because the legislation benefitted one sect, id. at 704
(“Here the benefit flows only to a single sect”), the Court rejected the normal presumption that
the action of a state legislature was constitutional. The Court also rejected an accommodation
defense because the “proposed accommodation singles out a particular religious sect for special
treatment,” violating the Constitution’s mandate of religious neutrality. Id. at 706.
That is the case here. The practice favors a single denomination. Until very recently,
defendants never continued chaplains of any denomination past statutory separation ages except
Roman Catholic.
Defendants are currently short chaplains and they were short chaplains when they
discharged Adair plaintiff CH Belt and Gibson plaintiff CH Porter-Stewart, who were closer to
reaching their 20 years TIS than some of the continued chaplains. Yet the only chaplains
defendants have continued on active duty are Catholic. This is a per se preference with no
purpose except to grant Catholics special privileges.
D.

The Challenged Practice Violates the Lemon Test4

“Under the Lemon analysis, a [] practice which touches upon religion, if it is to be
permissible under the Establishment Clause, must have a secular purpose; it must neither
advance nor inhibit religion in its principal or primary effect; and it must not foster an excessive
entanglement with religion.” County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 592 (citing Lemon, 403 U.S. at

4

Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 223, 232 (2d Cir. 1985), declined to apply the Lemon test in
reviewing an Establishment Clause challenge to the Army Chaplain Corps because the Chaplain
Corps advanced religion and entangled the government “with religious accrediting bodies.”
Katcoff was decided before Corp. of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987) explained
the difference between accommodation and establishment. Amos shows a chaplaincy
administered in a neutral manner will pass Lemon’s test.

612 – 613). Governmental action that unconstitutionally advances religion includes actions
whose purpose or effect has endorsed or advanced a specific religion or religion in general,
“attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or
preferred”, or favoring religious belief over disbelief. Id. at 292-93 (citing various cases and
quoting Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 70 (1985)). Defendants’ 4109 Program certainly
“touches upon religion” and both advances a specific religion and financially supports it.
1.

The 4109 Program has no valid secular purpose

On its face, the 4109 Program’s only purpose is to allow Catholic chaplains whose
separation 10 U.S.C. §§ 14509 and 1251 require when the chaplains reach statutory separation
age to remain on active duty until they complete the 20 years TIS required to qualify for the
retired pay they acknowledged they were ineligible for when they were commissioned with
(illegal) age waivers. FACT 10. As shown above in C.1 and incorporated herein by reference,
defendants have failed to show a compelling purpose because they have not identified DON’s
free exercise needs and shown DON Catholics are worse off than their civilian counterparts.
Defendants’ concern for Catholic chaplains, demonstrated by the overage pension
program for Catholics which ignores the law and violates the Constitution, stands in sharp
contrast with defendants’ gross failure to meet the free exercise needs of faith specific Nonliturgical communities in overseas locations. CAPT James Poe was the Regional
Chaplain/Religious Ministries Program Director for the Commander, Naval Region Europe
(CNRE). Declaration of James F. Poe, CHC, USN, (Ret.) (Exhibit 6), ¶ 4. He describes the
specific free exercise needs of two different, vibrant Non-liturgical Protestant Evangelical and
Pentecostal/charismatic communities in Naples, Italy, id., ¶¶ 13, 14, and Rota, Spain, id., ¶ 21.
23

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 32 of 55

Although he made the CHC aware of the need to provide appropriate replacement chaplains for
these congregations, id. ¶¶ 25-26, the CHC ignored these communities’ free exercise needs. Id.,
¶¶ 13, 15-21. Instead, they replaced the evangelical and Pentecostal chaplains at both locations
with chaplains totally unsuited for those congregations’ worship needs. Id. Defendants’ efforts
show they prefer Catholics contrary to the Constitution, while their different treatment of Nonliturgicals at Rota and Naples “illustrate an underlying indifference, if not hostility, to the free
exercise needs of non-liturgical faith groups, especially those considered Evangelical.” Poe at ¶
23. The contrast shows the CHC’s 4109 Program’s purpose is to benefit Catholics, a religious
purpose, rather than meet all of DON’s free exercise needs, a secular purpose.
There can be no valid secular purpose when defendants have other options available
which do not require financial support to and favoritism for one denomination. See Larkin, 459
U.S. at 123-24 (“valid secular objective can be readily accomplished by other means.”).
2.

Defendants’ 4109 Program fails Lemon’s second prong by advancing
the Catholic religion and inhibiting the religion of others

Defendants can not pass the second prong of Lemon’s criteria, i.e., the 4109
Program “must neither advance nor inhibit religion.” The challenged practice clearly advances
Catholic interests, and benefits Catholic clergy and the Catholic Church financially. The 4109
Program provides other benefits especially important to older persons such as medical care, a
burden the Catholic Church would have to bear without the 4109 Program. Defendants cannot
deny they are advancing the Catholic religion because until recently, the 4109 Program had
allowed only Catholics to remain on active duty to obtain pensions. As shown below, the 4109
Program communicates defendants’ hostility to other religions and faith groups because their

24

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 33 of 55

chaplains are denied the same opportunities and benefits, even in the face of current chaplain
shortages. “Here the benefit flows only to a single sect”, a forbidden preference. See Grumet,
512 U.S. at 704. Such hostility is not neutral and inhibits other religions.
Defendants have consistently admitted they do not collect any data on specific religious
community needs like Rota and Naples. See, e.g., Carter Deposition (Exhibit 7), [32:18-23] (not
concerned about non-Catholic FGCs or communities); [59:6-23].. Defendants have demonstrated
callous indifference to religious free exercise needs of Non-liturgicals, e.g., the Evangelical and
Pentecostal communities at Rota and Naples. See Poe at ¶¶ 13-29. They cannot argue here there
is a need or legitimate purpose for retaining overage Catholic chaplains because since 2003,
defendants have presented no data on Catholic or other communities’ needs. Ms. Berto’s
Declaration, DefOpBr Exhibit 1, stated the 4109s met a Catholic requirement. This is contrary to
defendants’ argument in Larsen that the CHC had no requirements for any denominations,
otherwise there would have been goals.
The 4109 Program is like the provisions of New York’s kosher food fraud statutes struck
down by Commack Self-Service Kosher Meets, Inc., v. Weiss, 294 F.3d 415 (2d Cir. 2002), cert
denied, 537 U.S. 1187 (2003). Commack found the challenged provisions preferred “the dietary
restrictions of Orthodox Judaism over those of other branches” and “the challenged laws
discriminated in favor of the Orthodox view regarding the dietary requirements of kashrut.” Id. at
430. This preference put the state’s “imprimatur on the religious views of the one [sect] to the
exclusion of others.” Id. The 4109 Program benefits only Catholics; no other denomination has
been allowed to keep its clergy on active duty past their statutory separation ages for the purpose
of qualifying for a pension. In fact, defendants separated Adair plaintiff CH Belt and Gibson
25

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

plaintiff CH Porter-Stewart in March 2006 although they were younger and needed only a few
years to come within the safe harbor of 18 years service, while retaining Catholics with many
years left before becoming eligible for retirement and adding others to the 4109 category.
Defendants have continued the 4109 Program despite being on notice it was a religious
preference, communicated a message of prejudice, and had no statutory or regulatory foundation
for the practice. They have continued to defend their practice with bogus reasoning such as citing
SECNAVINST 1820.2B as authority despite the fact the instruction, by its title and context,
excludes active duty personnel from its coverage. See plaintiffs’ Inj Mot Reply at 19-20.
3.

Defendants’ 4109 Program unconstitutionally entangles the Navy and
religion

Defendants’ unconstitutional entanglement with one specific denomination, i.e.
Catholics, is readily apparent. The very act of providing a single program that benefits only
Catholics essentially makes the government an agent for this denomination. Commack found the
state’s “imprimatur” on the Orthodox view of what is kosher entangled the state with religion. Id.
at 430. Here, the preference exhibited by the 4109 Program is not merely symbolic; the
challenged practice financially aids one denomination by providing a pension program and other
benefits to members of its clergy, a benefit the Church itself would have to provide were it not for
defendants’ largess. Providing chaplains to meet individual free exercise needs is
accommodation, but favoring one religion with an over-age pension qualification program which
provides substantial financial support is forbidden establishment of religion. See Amos, 483 U.S.
at 327.

The 4109 Program Fails the Reasonable Observer Test

The reasonable observer examines the 4109 Program’s history and
purpose

Recent Supreme Court precedents tend to collapse Lemon’s standard three-part test
into a two-part test known as the “endorsement test.” This combines Lemon’s second and third
prongs, the result and entanglement questions, into the question whether the objective or
reasonable observer would perceive the challenged governmental action as an endorsement or
preference for or against religion, a specific religion, or a religious viewpoint. For example, Santa
Fe Independent School District v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000), found an objective observer
would perceive student led prayer at school athletic events was an endorsement of religion.
County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. 573 (1989) asked whether the reasonable observer would perceive
as religious endorsements the displays of (1) a crèche on the main staircase of the county
courthouse and (2) a menorah in another display including other seasonal symbols. The Court
found the placement of the crèche communicated endorsement because of its location, 492 U.S. at
599-602, whereas the menorah passed constitutional review because it was merely one of several
holiday symbols in a group. Id. at 613-16, 620-21. In each case the Court reached its answer after
examining the message the practices communicated and the practices’ context.
McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, 545 U.S. 844 (2005), asked whether an objective
observer would conclude the display of the Ten Commandments with other historic documents in
two county courthouses communicated governmental endorsement of religion. McCreary County
held courts should analyze the purpose of the challenged practice from the viewpoint of the
reasonable or objective observer. The McCreary petitioners argued the Court should ignore the
history of the challenged displays and only look at the last iteration of the display. 545 U.S. at

27

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 36 of 55

863-66, 871-72. The Court rejected this argument and held the “objective observer’s eyes” were
to look closely at the historical facts which often revealed the purpose behind the challenged
practice or statute. Id. at 862. The Court also rejected petitioner’s attempt to trivialize the
purpose inquiry: “The Counties would read the cases as if the purpose enquiry were so naive that
any transparent claim to secularity would satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry,
to the point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it actually had on the significance of
current circumstances.” Id. at 863-64. “We hold that the Counties’ manifest objective may be
dispositive of constitutional enquiry, and that the development of the presentations should be
considered when determining its purpose.” Id. at 850. The Court emphasized “the purpose needs
to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause”, and courts should reject sham reasons. Id.
at 874.
Accordingly, plaintiffs will first address defendants 4109 Program from the reasonable
observer’s viewpoint, looking at its history, obvious purpose and message. See, e.g., id. at 871-72
(district court found the previous iterations of the challenged display violated the Establishment
Clause because those iterations had an improper purpose, the advancement of religion).
2.

The reasonable observer would conclude the 4109 Program is an illegal
preference designed solely to advance Catholic interests

McCreary held the objective or reasonable observer must take into account both
the complete history and the context of the challenged practice since the purpose of a challenged
practice often becomes evident in the practice’s history. 545 U.S. at 866. This means looking at
the purpose for which defendants instituted their overage Catholic pension system, a purpose
manifest by several factors. First, the reasonable observer would know the defendants admitted

28

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 37 of 55

“The Chaplain Corps has never conducted an in-depth study of the religious affiliation of
members in the Navy and Marine Corps.” Exhibit 5.
Second, the objective observer would know defendants acknowledge DON’s free exercise
needs have not been identified and they play no part in their chaplain accession system or in the
detailing process. FACT 22. The objective observer would know there can be no justification for
keeping chaplains of a specific faith past their statutory separation dates without an understanding
and quantification of religious needs and a standard against which to measure them. As Dr.
Leuba’s analysis (“Too Many Priests?” at 4 (Exhibit 10) shows, DON’s Catholics do better in
terms of the ratio of Catholic members to priest than do their Catholic civilian counterparts.
Third, the objective observer would know until very recently the 4109 Program was almost
exclusively for Catholics. FACT 4c. The extension of a single rabbi for a few years cannot undo
defendants’ past history of Catholic exclusivity and the fact the primary beneficiaries (if not the
sole beneficiaries) are Catholic chaplains and the Catholic Church.
Fourth, since the 4109 status has been limited solely to Catholics during its history, the
objective observer would know the purpose of the program was to benefit Catholic chaplains.
The reasonable observer would conclude from the 4109 Program’s history and the factors
surrounding it that its only purpose is to benefit Catholic chaplains and thereby benefit the
Catholic Church by providing a pension and continued medical benefits for some of its elderly
clergy. See II.B.1. above.
[T]he Establishment Clause is infringed when the government makes adherence to
religion relevant to a person's standing in the political community. Direct
government action endorsing religion or a particular religious practice is invalid
under this approach because it sends a message to nonadherents that they are
outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying
29

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Page 38 of 55

message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political
community.
Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S., at 69, (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation
marks omitted).
The objective observer’s analysis of defendants’ practice would also conclude defendants
have established Catholicism as the Navy’s preferred religion. There is no other explanation;
despite being put on notice, defendants have closed their eyes to the law and very clear Supreme
Court precedent that denominational preferences are subject to strict scrutiny. Any reasonable
observer would understand defendants’ 4109 Program fails strict scrutiny given the history of its
practice, its limitation to one denomination, the lack of statutory authority, and defendants’ failure
to identify specific religious needs and a compelling purpose.
The objective observer would also conclude defendants’ practice communicates a message
of favoritism to Catholics and hostility to Non-liturgicals. “When the government puts its
imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not
adhere to the favored beliefs.” Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 606 (1992). This is manifest in
defendants’ deliberate extension of only overage Catholic chaplains beyond their statutory age
limit, while discharging non-liturgicals such as CHs Belt and Porter-Stewart, and showing
indifference or active hostility to the Pentecostal/charismatic and evangelical Protestant
congregations in Naples and Rota, see Poe Declaration at ¶¶ 13-29.
The objective observer would also note the obvious message of preference the practice
communicates. Protestant churches send their young men and women to serve as chaplains
because military service reflects Congress’s desire for a young force able to endure the hardships

30

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 39 of 55

inherent in military service. Chaplains Belt and Porter-Stewart gave their youth to the Navy and
then were discarded. The 4109 Catholics give their youth to their Church, then when they are
older and not able to compete with younger chaplains, they give their old age and limited ability to
the Navy. By accepting this offer, defendants communicate the message old Catholics are of more
value than young non-Catholics. If defendants need priests to say Mass, they can hire contract
clergy or auxiliary chaplains to replace these 4109 Program priests at minimal cost.
III.

PLAINTIFFS WILL SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIM THE CHALLENGED
PRACTICE VIOLATES DUE PROCESS
The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause has an equal protection component which

requires defendants to treat similarly situated chaplains equally. “[T]he Fifth Amendment
requires the Navy to treat non-liturgical Christian chaplains in the same manner that it treats
liturgical Protestant chaplains.” Adair, 183 F.Supp.2d at 53. This Court has noted previously,
“the Supreme Court has held courts must apply strict scrutiny to any policy or practice that
involves a denominational preference.” Id. (citing County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 608-09;
Larson, 456 U.S. at 246).
On its face, the 4109 Program does not treat all chaplains equally. It allows overage
Catholics, including those with multiple FOS, to remain on active duty to accrue sufficient TIS
service to qualify for a pension, while discharging Non-liturgicals. Adair plaintiff CH Belt and
Gibson plaintiff CH Porter-Stewart were discharged for FOS although they were much younger
and needed fewer years to come within § 12686's safe harbor of 18 years service than the
Catholics with FOS who were retained. Few non-Catholics have been allowed to remain on
active duty past statutory separation age and no non-Catholic has been granted 4109 status.

Defendants failed to identify any non-Catholic chaplain on active duty over age 62 in their 2003
interrogatory responses. This is an example of the religious gerrymandering specifically
condemned in Larson, 456 U.S. at 255. The practice in this case is the same one-way government
benefit to a religious group Grumet found offensive to the Constitution. 512 U.S. 687, 703 (1994)
(“Here the benefit flows only to a single sect”). As shown in II.A above, defendants have no
compelling purpose nor can they show the means they have chosen, a program until recently
limited to Catholics that violates Congress’s specific determination as to separation ages, is
narrowly tailored to achieve any government purpose.
IV.

PLAINTIFFS WILL SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIM
DEFENDANTS’ CONTINUATION OF CATHOLIC CHAPLAINS BEYOND
STATUTORY SEPARATION AGES IS WITHOUT AUTHORITY
A.

The Secretary of Defense Has Limited the Secretary of Navy’s Authority to
Place Reservists in the Retired Reserve to Those Who Meet Specific Criteria

Defendants have argued 10 U.S.C. § 264 gives the Secretary of Navy authority to place in
the Retired Reserve chaplains who have not qualified for receipt of Retired Pay. DefOpBr at 1517 and Def. Reply at 13-14. This is false as a matter of law. 10 U.S.C. § 10141 creates only three
Reserve Component Categories (“RCC”): Ready, Standby and Retired Reserve (the “RRC”). 10
U.S.C. § 10154 defines the Retired Reserve as those eligible for retired pay under various statutes
addressing each service in § 10154(a), and “Reserves who have been transferred to the Retired
Reserve, retain their status as Reserves, and are otherwise qualified” in § 10154(b). Title 10 does
not define “otherwise qualified” but 10 U.S.C. § 113(b) gives the Secretary of Defense authority
to establish regulations governing the Reserve forces including the Retired Reserve.
The Secretary of Defense has exercised that authority and has issued four DOD Directives

32

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 41 of 55

(DODD) and DOD Instructions (DODI) that cover four areas addressing all aspects of the Retired
Reserve: “Uniform Reserve, Training and Retirement Categories Administration”, DODI 1215.19
(dated 12/12/2000, which is relevant to the time period for the actions addressed in this motion),
(Def.RR Exhibit A) (incorporated by reference), which has been replaced by DODI 1215.06
(dated 2/7/07 with the same title) (Exhibit 11); “Assignment to and ... Transfer to the Retired
Reserve”, DODI 1200.15 (dated 9/18/97) (Exhibit 12); “Management and Mobilization of
Regular and Reserve Retired Military Members”, DODD 1352.1 (dated 7/16/05) (Exhibit 13); and
“Employment of Retired Members of the Armed Forces” DODD1402.1 (dated January 21, 1982,
still listed by DOD as a valid authority), (Exhibit 14).
Each of the four regulations requires defendants to comply with the DODDs and DODIs.
For example, Paragraph 5.2.1 of DODI 1215.19 direct’s the Secretary to “[d]esignate all Reserve
Component members,” including the 4109s, “in a RCC ... in accordance with criteria established
in enclosures 2 and 4”; Enclosure 2, ¶ E2.2.1.4, defines five “Retired Reserve Categories”
(Def.RR Exhibit A. at 30), mirroring the five categories and qualifications defined in ¶ 6.5.4.4,
see below. DODI 1200.15, ¶ 5.3, limits the Secretary’s authority to transfer personnel to the
Retired Reserve to 3 cases; the two relating to those eligible for retired pay are mandatory
(“shall”), the one case addressing disability is permissive. DODD 1352.1 states “The Secretaries
of the Military Departments ... shall ensure plans for management and mobilization of military
retirees are consistent with this directive”, ¶ 5.3 (“RESPONSIBILITIES”), and defines the Retired
Reserve, linking it to eligibility for retired pay. These DODIs and DODDs, by using the word
“shall”, make it clear the Service Secretaries must comply with the DODIs’ and DODDs’
provisions They provide no room for the Secretary of Navy not to comply or discretion to do

the DODIs is mandatory. Deposition of Thomas Bush (Exhibit 15) at [95:11-97:21].
B.

DOD’s Definition of the Retired Reserve Excludes the 4109s

Each DODI and DODD has defined the Retired Reserve in a uniform, historically
consistent manner, linking eligibility for or assignment to the Retired Reserve with eligibility for
retired, retainer or disability pay.5 A chaplain not entitled receive payment for prior active service
is not eligible for transfer to, or listing in, or inclusion in the Retired Reserve. Five categories
constitute the Retired Reserve as defined by DOD.
The Retired Reserve consists of the following categories:
6.5.4.4.1
Reserve members receiving retired pay under Chapter 1223 of
reference(e) [Title 10].
6.5.4.4.2
Reserve members who have transferred to the Retired
Reserve after completing the requisite qualifying years
creditable for retired pay under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1223
(reference(e)), but who are not yet 60 years of age, or are age
60 and have not applied for retired pay.
6.5.4.4.3
Reserve members retired for physical disability under
Sections 1201, 1202, 1204, or 1205 of reference (e).
Members who have completed the requisite years of Military
Service creditable for non-regular retired pay under Chapter
1223 of reference (e) or are 30-percent or more disabled and
otherwise qualified under Section 1201 of (reference(e)).
6.5.4.4.4
Reserve officers and enlisted members who have retired
after completion of 20, or more, years of active Military
Service. This does not include Regular enlisted members of
the Navy or the Marine Corps, with 20 to 30 years of active
Military Service, who are transferred to the Fleet Reserve
(Navy) or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.
6.5.4.4.5
Reserve personnel drawing retired pay based on retirement
for reasons other than age, service requirements, or physical
5

DODI 1200.15, ¶ 5.3.1 dated 9/18/1997 (DX L at 5), directed the Secretary to transfer to
the Retired Reserve, in addition to those who qualified for retirement pay under Title 10, those
found physically disqualified for active duty ... if more than 30% disabled, and “on application ...
all personnel who belong in the categories listed in subsection F.4 of DOD Instruction 1215.19.”

disability. This category is restricted to those who are
retired under special conditions, as authorized by the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs under
legislation.6
DODI 1215.19, ¶ 6.5.4.4 (Def.RR Exhibit A, pg. 17-18). DODI 1215.19's Enclosure 2 ¶ E2.2.1.4
(DX A. at 30) again defines “Retired Reserve Categories” using the five categories and
qualifications defined in ¶ 6.5.4.4 above, e.g., those Reserve Members: “who have completed the
requisite qualifying years creditable for non-regular retired pay and are receiving retired pay
under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1223." Enclosure 4, Table 1 (Def.RR Exhibit A at 39) illustrates and
defines the five categories. The entitlement to retired pay is the common feature of all five Retired
Reserve categories. DODI 1215.19, ¶ 6.6.4.4, “Retired Reserve” (Exhibit 12) and ¶ E5.1.3
(“Retired Reserve Categories”) of enclosure 5 (id. at 32) define five Retired Reserve categories
which duplicate DODI 1215.19's categories. DODD 1402.1 (Exhibit 14) specifically defines the
term “Retired Member of the Armed Forces” as “a member or former member of the Armed
Forces who is entitled to retired, retirement, or retainer pay.” ¶ 3.1. The use of the term “entitled”
means that the person has met the statutory requirements to receive a benefit, creating a right to
receive the benefit, i.e., To qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 277 (Abridged 5th Ed. 1983). “Entitlement” means “Right to benefits,
income or property which may not be abridged without due process.” Id. DODD 1352.1, (Exhibit
13) ¶ E.1.1.4, defines “Military Retirees or Retired military Members” as those who retire or are
eligible for retirement under Title 10's definitions after reaching the appropriate TIS.

6

These “special conditions” exclude 4109s because this category is limited to those
“Reserve Personnel drawing retired pay” for which the 4109s are ineligible. See DODI 1215.19
¶ 6.5.4.4.
35

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

DOD’s definition of the Retired Reserve limits it to those Reservists entitled to retired,
retainer or disability pay. No DOD Retired Reserve Category includes personnel who are not
entitled to receive pay as a result of active duty service. DOD’s regulations show it has defined §
10154's phrase “otherwise qualified” by defining what constitutes the RRC, limiting it to statutory
categories consistent with the law and Congressional intent. In doing so, the Secretary of Defense
has excluded from the Retired Reserve the 4109s because they are not entitled to retired pay.
C.

Defendants Must Comply With DOD’s Instructions

The law is clear, once the Secretary of Defense has established a policy or regulation, the
Armed Services must obey it completely. Regulations promulgated by the Secretary “canalize the
discretion of its subordinate officials” and restrict the discretion of subordinate Armed Services
that statutes may otherwise provide. See Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of
the Interior, 255 F.3d 342, 348 (7th cir 2001), cert denied, 534 U.S. 1129 (2002); Center for Auto
Safety v. Dole, 846 F.2d 1532, (D.C. Cir 1988); (agencies are bound by issued regulations).
The facts and competing legal theories here are similar to Bond v. United States, 47 Fed. Cl.
641 (2000). Lieutenant Col. (LTC) Bond challenged a commander’s classification of his duty on a
two-day operational alert as active duty for training (“ADT”) rather than active duty support
(“ADS”) which entitled him to active duty status and immediate retirement benefits. “The case
before this court involves the application of a regulation-driven classification scheme governing
reserve military duty assignments”, id. at 650, similar to this case. The Air Force said its
regulation allowed the commander complete discretion to classify LTC Bond’s tour of duty any
way he wanted. Id. at 648-49, 659 (citing Air Force Regulation (AFR) 35-41). The court
disagreed. The court held “the Air Force must comply with governing regulatory definitions in
36

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 45 of 55

assigning TCCs [Training Category Codes]. The TCC is not to be assigned at the convenience of
the commander.” Id. at 659. The court found DOD and Air Force regulations defined the TCCs
and AFR 35-41 “does not give the commander the discretion to assign duties to either TCC at will.
To allow otherwise would allow commanders to undermine the intent of the classification
scheme.” Id. That is exactly the case here as shown below. Service practices that conflict with
DOD’s regulations “must give way.” Id. at 622 (quoting Casey v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 234, 239
(1985)); Poole v. Rourke, 779 F.Supp. 1546, 1565-66 (E.D.Cal.1991). Unfortunately, defendants
have not followed either the law or the DOD regulations. They have illegally classified the 4109s
as retired reserve and allowed them to remain on active duty illegally.
D.

The 4109s Have Been Illegally Classified and Illegally Continued on Active
Duty

DOD requires defendants to legally categorize all Reservist into a RCC. DODI 1215.19, ¶
5.2.8 (“The Secretaries of the Military Departments ... shall: Designate all RC members in a RCC
and TRC according to the criteria established in Enclosures 5 and 6.”). Prior to reaching their
statutory separation age, the 4109s were Reservists on active duty. When they reached § 14509's
former statutory separation age of 60, these 4109s were illegally continued until they reached age
67 because § 14703 is limited to extending Reserve chaplains on the RASL to age 67, and these
chaplains were on active duty. When they reached age 67, the 4109s were transferred into the
Retired Reserve illegally because they were not entitled to receive retired pay and therefore
ineligible for transfer to the Retired Reserve as defined by DOD. Defendants are not free to create
new Retired Reserve Categories or disobey DOD’s orders to “[d]esignate all RC members in a
RCC and TRC according to the criteria established in Enclosures 5 and 6.” Both the transfer to

37

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 46 of 55

and recall from the Retired Reserve was illegal because the 4109s did not meet the criteria for
transfer to the Retired Reserve.
E.

Title 10 Provides Limited Authority to Extend Regular Chaplains Eligible for
Retirement Beyond Age 62

10 U.S.C. § 1251(a) establishes age 62 as the normal separation age for each Regular
officer. “Unless retired or separated earlier, each regular commissioned officer ... [below the grade
of RADM] shall be retired on the first day of the month following the month in which the officer
becomes 62 years of age.” The word “retired” has a specific legal meaning and is defined by
statute and DOD Directives, as shown in A and B above. It means a person has accumulated at
least 20 years active TIS which entitles him to a pension, the amount of which is determined by his
total length of service, his time in grade, and his grade upon the date of his retirement. These
factors are all established by statute. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. §§ 6321-36.
Section 1251(c) allows the Secretary to “defer the retirement under subsection (a) of an
officer who is appointed or designated as a chaplain if the Secretary determines that such deferral is
in the best interests of the military department concerned.” (Emphasis added). Subsection (d),
“Limitation on deferment of retirements,” limits such deferments until “the first day of the month
following the month in which the officer becomes 68 years of age.” § 1251(d)(1). A recent change
to this provision of § 1251, effective October 10, 2006, allows the Secretary to “extend the
deferment under subsection ... (c) beyond the day referred to in paragraph (1) [age 68] if the
Secretary determines that extension of the deferment is necessary for the needs of the military
department concerned.”
A plain reading of the statute and the common understanding of the terms “defer” and the

38

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 47 of 55

DOD’s use of the terms “retired” and “retirement” shows this subsection provides no authority to
extend chaplains who have not attained the necessary time in service for retirement until they reach
20 years service. “Defer” means “to put off to a future time; postpone, delay.” Webster’s New
World Dictionary 384 (1960); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 219 Abridged 5th Ed. 1983
(“Deferral. Act of delaying, postponing or putting off.”). “A fundamental canon of statutory
construction is that unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,
contemporary, common meaning.” Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979). Retirement is
the specific point in time when a military person becomes “retired” as defined by DODD 1402.1.
To “defer the retirement” of a chaplain under § 1251 is to postpone or delay the actual day when
the chaplain who is eligible for retirement, i.e., has met Title 10's requirements, actually changes
his or her status from active to retired. The Secretary cannot defer “retirement” of a chaplain who
does not qualify for retirement.
F.

Title 10 Provides No Authority to Extend Reserve Chaplains on Active Duty
Beyond Age 67

When plaintiffs filed this motion in 2003, 10 U.S.C. § 14509 required the separation of
Reserve chaplains when they reached age 60. Changes to Title 10 in 2006 changed the separation
age of Reserve chaplains to age 62, making it the same age as Regulars. Section 14703(a)(2)
authorizes the Secretary to “retain in active status any Reserve officer appointed ... in the Chaplain
Corps” beyond age 62. However, this authority is specifically limited by two aspects. First, it
excepts “officers referred to in Sections 14503, 14504, 14505 and 14506,” which address Reserve
officers who have not been promoted to the grade of Commander. That excludes the 4109
chaplains at issue here who are FOS LTs and LCDRs.

39

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 48 of 55

The second limitation is subsection (b) “Separation at Specified Age.” “An officer may not
be retained on active status under this section later than the date on which the officer becomes 67
years of age.” (emphasis added). There is no exception similar to 10 U.S.C. § 1251(d)(2) which
allows the Secretary to defer Regular chaplain retirements past age 68 for a specific need of the
service. The use of the term “may not” eliminates the permissive sense normally associated with
the term “may.” Had Congress wished to allow the Secretary the same latitude it provided in §
1251, it knew how to do so. The fact it did grant the Secretary authority to exceed the age 68 limit
for Regulars but specifically denied it for Reservists shows that is what Congress intended, a result
consistent with Congress’s differing treatment of Regulars and Reserves. “When Congress
‘includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the separate
inclusion or exclusion.’” American Chemical Council v. Johnson, 406 F.3d 738, 741 (D.C. Cir.
2005) (quoting Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 452 (2002)).
Title 10's structure and placement of § 14703's retention authority creates additional
problems for defendants’ attempt to justify their illegal retention of these FOS Catholic chaplains.
Congress has provided no authority within the structure of Subtitle E to allow Reserve officers to
continue on active duty past the mandatory separation age. Congress placed § 14703 in Chapter
1409, Part III, Subtitle E which specifically addresses the Reserve components. Part III addresses
“Promotion and Retention of Officers on the Reserve Active-Status List” and Chapter 1409
addresses “Continuation of Officers on the Reserve Active-Status List and Selective Early
Removal.” The clear implication is that § 14703, by its placement in Chapter 1409 and Part III,
addresses only officers on the RASL. These 4109 chaplains are not on the RASL. They must be
40

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

carried on the ADL because they are on active duty. 10 U.S.C. § 101(c)(7) defines the RASL and
excludes anyone on the ADL. As noted above, the lists are mutually exclusive. The fact these
chaplains cannot be covered under § 14703 is consistent with and follows from DOPMA’s
structure and focus on producing an all Regular Active Duty force. The recent changes to Title 10
making all entry level officers Regular officers is a further demonstration of Congress’s intent that
the active duty force should be regular.
There is no authority to extend these 4109 Reserve Catholic chaplains under § 14703.
Congress specifically excluded those who have FOS to Commander, which addresses this group of
4109s and perhaps others, and § 14703(a), and § 14703(b) limit any such extension to the day the
chaplain who is at least a Commander becomes “67 years of age.”
V.

PLAINTIFFS MEET THE OTHER INJUNCTION CRITERIA
A.

Defendants’ Establishment Clause Violation Produces Irreparable Harm

The unconstitutional 4109 Program produce irreparable harm. CFGC, 454 F.3d at 303.
B.

Terminating Defendants’ Unconstitutional Practice Poses No Burden or Injury
on Defendants

The Navy will suffer no harm whatsoever if the Court orders it to comply with the statutory
limits on active duty chaplains. The Navy can suffer no prejudice by ending its practice of
preference for over-age Catholics. Navy officials are charged with following the law as well as
their own regulations and cannot claim prejudice if forced to do so by the Court. OPNAVINST
1730.1D allows defendants to hire the 4109s as contract clergy if they are needed.
C.

Terminating Defendants’ Unconstitutional Practice Is in the Public Interest

A consistent Supreme Court theme in many of the cases addressing Establishment Clause

challenges is that Clause’s purpose was to avoid divisiveness, division, hostility and friction
resulting from the government’s union and cooperation with religion. “The centuries immediately
before and contemporaneous with the colonization of America had been filled with turmoil, civil
strife, and persecutions, generated in large part by established sects determined to maintain their
absolute political and religious supremacy.” Everson v. Board of Ed., 330 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1947). “At
the time of the Revolution, Americans feared not only a denial of religious freedom, but also the
danger of political oppression through a union of civil and ecclesiastical control.” Larkin, 459 U.S.
126 n. 10 (citing B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 98 – 99, n. 3 (1987)).
By the time of the adoption of the Constitution, our history shows that there was a
widespread awareness among many Americans of the dangers of a union of Church
and State. These people knew, some of them from bitter personal experience, that
one of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the individual to worship in his own
way lay in the Government's placing its official stamp of approval upon one
particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious services. They knew the
anguish, hardship and bitter strife that could come when zealous religious groups
struggled with one another to obtain the Government's stamp of approval from each
King, Queen, or Protector that came to temporary power.
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 429 (1962); accord Everson, 330 U.S. at 8-11.
This case illustrates the very evil the Establishment Clause was designed to prevent. A
group of chaplains from various Non-liturgical faith groups is before this Court to redress the
government’s alliance with and favoritism to another religious group, the Catholic Church.
Benefits are given and denied based on religious affiliation.
Confronting and forbidding the very government actions that produce “the anguish,
hardship and bitter strife that could come when zealous religious groups struggled with one another
to obtain the Government's stamp of approval” serves the public interest. Courts have held it is in
the public interest to vindicate First Amendment rights. Rigdon v. Perry, 962 F.Supp 150, 165

(D.D.C. 1977); see also, e.g., Utah Licenced Bev. Ass’n v. Leavitt, 256 F.3d 1061, 1076 (10th Cir.
2001). It is in the highest public interest to make sure our military remains neutral in matters of
religion. The public has a strong interest in having a military that conducts itself fairly and
according to the law. Cooney v. Dalton, 877 F. Supp. 508, 515 (D.Hawai’i 1995) (enjoining the
discharge of a sailor). That interest is particularly evident in this case. “We ... hold that a party
alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause per se satisfies the irreparable injury requirement
of the preliminary injunction calculus.” CFGC, 454 F.3d at 304. The very purpose of an
injunction is to stop irreparable harm. The Navy has clearly violated Title 10, the Secretary’s own
instructions and the Establishment Clause. When agencies stray beyond the limits set for them by
Congress, courts have a duty to require that they comply with the law. See Dilley, 603 F.2d at 914.
“The federal Constitution embraces and embodies the cardinal principle that this is a nation
subject to the rule of law, and as such, agents of the government are bound to follow the law.”7
Wilkinson v. Legal Services Corp., 27 F. Supp. 2d 32, 57 (D.D.C. 1998) (citing United States v.
Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 220-21 (1892) and other cases). See also Dilly v. Alexander, 603 F.2d 919, 920
(D.C. Cir 1979) (“It is a basic tenet of our legal system that a government agency is not at liberty to
ignore its own laws and that agency action in contravention of applicable statutes and regulations is
unlawful”) and 921 (“courts have shown no hesitation to review cases in which a violation of the
Constitution ... is alleged.”).
It is both absurd and seditious to argue that allowing the government to operate outside of
the Constitution is in the public interest. Defendants can show no burden if they must operate their
7

Wilkinson, 27 F. Supp. 2d at 57-64 provides an extensive discussion of the Accardi
Doctrine, the rule government must obey the law, referring to Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S.

chaplain management and retention programs in accord with the Constitution. Plaintiffs have met
all the criteria for an injunction.
D.

There Are No Third Party Rights That must Be Addressed

Defendants have previously improperly argued “[a]llowing plaintiffs to go forward with a
motion that requires affirmative action affecting the rights of non-party naval officers, whose own
rights must be considered and respected, prior to a final judgment that plaintiffs are entitled to any
relief is not justified.” Opp to Motion to Lift Stay at 9. As shown in the Background above and
here, the Catholic 4109 chaplains in question were commissioned with age waivers under
SECNAVINST 1120.4A which specifically requires the applicant’s written acknowledgment he
will be unable to reach 20 years of service necessary for a pension and retirement under Title 10.
Their situation is addressed at the very end of ¶ 6.b. “Before appointment, applicants who will be
unable to complete 20 years of creditable service for retirement [before reaching age 62] shall
acknowledge the same in writing.” See Inj. Mot. at 7 and 10, No. 14 (quoting 1120.4A, ¶ 6.b ).
Consequently, these chaplains have no rights that must be protected should the Court order
an injunction because their waivers show they had no legitimate expectation of being allowed to
stay past their statutory separation age. The SECNAVINST makes it clear they should expect to be
separated at the statutory separation age. Assuming arguendo they had such a claim due to
defendants’ actions, any abridgment of the challenged chaplains’ expectations arising from a
forbidden and illegal transaction and status that no Navy official was authorized to provide would
have to be raised by them personally. The validity of any theory under which such claims could
arise is not an issue in this motion. The injunction operates against the Navy, not these chaplains.

Page 53 of 55

Plaintiffs’ evidence shows the 4109 Program is a denominational preference. The
appropriate precedent for addressing such claims shows the 4109 Program is an unconstitutional
denominational preference as shown in II-IV plaintiffs in violation of the Establishment Clause
producing irreparable harm. An injunction will not harm defendants and is in the public interest.
No valid third party rights are involved.
CONCLUSION
Defendants have failed to show any compelling purpose for their challenged practice.
There are no competing interests that outweigh the need to terminate the irreparable harm from
defendants’ violation of the Establishment Clause. Defendants can show no prejudice, whereas
allowing their continued violation of the Constitution would be unprecedented.
Plaintiffs ask the Court (1) to immediately enjoin defendants from continuing only
Catholics past the statutory separation age of 62; (2) to order defendants to immediately end their
4109 Program and the retention of other Catholics over the age of 62; and (3) order defendants to
establish objective criteria for extending chaplains past age 62, including identifying specific
religious needs and other neutral, secular and non-ideological criteria.

Case No. 1: 07-mc-269 (RMU)

Does the Data Establish that the U.S. Navy favors Roman Catholics?
A Declaration and Statistical Analysis by Harald R. Leuba, PhD.
In my 27 September 2006 Withdrawal Declaration in Larson v U. S Navy, which I issued because
neither Dr. Siskin nor I had been analyzing accessions, per se, I drew attention in Appendix A, on
page 48, to a statistically significant interaction between (a) a chaplain candidate’s faith group
cluster and (b) the probability of being given an Accession Waiver if he/she was over age 40.
Piqued by this observation, Plaintiffs’ attorney has asked me to expand on my observations on
page 48 and to relate them to a similar pattern between (a) a chaplain candidate’s faith group
cluster and (b) the probability of a chaplain being continued on Active Duty past age 62.
In both instances, Roman Catholic chaplains are the beneficiaries of disparate treatment. And in
both cases, non-Liturgical, especially non-Baptist, non-Liturgical, Chaplains suffer a loss of
opportunity.
Whether this disparate treatment is de facto evidence of an institutional preference for the
Catholic religion in particular, I do not opine, but I do point out that the statistical evidence
supports such an inference.

Service Past Age 62
Federal statute [10 U.S.C § 1251(a)] requires that a serving Chaplain is supposed to be released
from Active Duty when he (or she) reaches age 62.
Under extraordinary conditions, e.g.:
•
•
•

when staffing levels cannot be met by other means, or
“for the good of the service”, or
if a “gross inequity would otherwise result”,

the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations may waive this limit and continue a Chaplain in service.

Page 2 of 25

Practically speaking, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations exercises this waiver arbitrarily;
there is no paper trail relating the waiver to one of the justifications, and no record of proof that
the staffing levels cannot be met by other means.
The waiver is also exercised selectively. In a cadre of nearly 900 Chaplains, only1 or 2 % are
singled out for this extraordinary waiver – but a surprising number of the Chaplains who are that
valuable – are Roman Catholic.
Since 1970 there have been 72 Navy Chaplains whose utility to the Corps prompted the Navy to
issue a waiver for them when they reached 62 years of age. Over 90% of these singularly
valuable Chaplains were Roman Catholic - valued, it seems, just because they were Roman
Catholic [cf Endnote 2].
The data provided in Table 1 are drawn from the Chaplain Corps History, Volumes VIII and X,
and from information produced by the Navy in the Discovery Process in this litigation series.

** Veronica Berto 3/9/07 (see also Endnote 2)
*** “Material Facts” as of December 2004

The probability of choosing 72 chaplains at random from the Chaplain Corp’s distribution of
faiths (see the typical Inventory in the last row in Table 1), and getting only 7 non-Catholics, is
less than one chance in a hundred thousand million billion.
Clearly, for at least the past 35 years, and continuing to the present, the U.S. Navy Chaplain
Corps’ selective use of age waivers signals that they value Catholic Chaplains over all others.

A Pattern of Preference
This priority for Catholics over all other denominations permeates the Corps’ personnel
management system, creeps into its rhetoric from time to time establishing quotas and alleging
“critical shortages”, and leads to the appearance of the Navy’s having a favorite denomination.

For example: Given that their retirement is postponed (for some of them), Catholics are much
more likely to end their careers with a pension, than non-Catholics. [See Appendix A.]
For example: If they “stumble” on the way toward retirement, Catholics are much more likely to
be given a medical discharge or allowed to retire on “disability” than non-Catholics. [See
Appendix B.]
For example: When they retire, Catholics get larger pensions than non-Catholics, because the
Catholics get proportionally much more than their “statistically fair share” of the promotions.
[See Appendix C.]
For example: The rules for eligibility protect Catholics from exposure to Selective Early
Retirement: 2 to 1 vs Liturgicals and 3 to1 vs non-Liturgicals. [See Appendix D.]
For example: Continuation in Service boards give de jure1 preference to Catholics and halt career
progress for many non-Catholics. [See Appendix E.]
And, for example, Catholics have both (a) a higher percentage of acceptance at accession than any
other so-called “faith group cluster” and (b) are given more age waivers at that hurdle than any
other so-called “faith group cluster”:

Age Waivers at Accession
As noted here in the first paragraph, I have already pointed out that what the Defendants’ advocates
and expert are referring to as “accessions” in their Larson pleadings to this Court, are not what the
Department of the Navy defines as “accessions”.
The Secretary of the Navy identifies two components of the service, Active Duty and Reserve, and
his Instructions describe the Student Program as the primary source for accessions, with Direct
accession onto Active Duty being the alternate path. [Recall is not an accession.]
Among a very limited number of requirements facing a candidate for the Navy Chaplaincy, there
1

The instructions to the CADRAG board, ¶3, require the board to select “within the
number you are authorized to recommend, those who best meet the needs of the Navy for
Chaplains.” Lest the Board misunderstand this guidance and actually pick the best qualified or
highest performing chaplains, COMNAVMILPERS makes it clear in ¶4: “the Navy needs to
select minority officers to assume positions of increased importance and responsibility. Your
commitment to aggressively ensuring eligible officers receive full and equal consideration,
particularly those from minority segments of our society, is critical to ensuring each member of
the Navy achieves his or her potential.” {But to make sure that the Board does not accidentally
understand this to include “minority” religious segments of our society, the next sentence is:}
“In addition, the Navy has critical needs for Chaplains who are Roman Catholics.

is an age limit. Until 2005 this limit was 40 years old, as the Navy’s Instruction2 stated that a:
•

“Chaplain Corps appointee must be able to complete 20 years of active commissioned
service by age 60.” [The 2005 Instruction changed this requirement to age 68.]

The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations “may waive these restrictions for otherwise qualified
applicants for appointment on the ADL or in the Reserve Component.” ...
•
•
•

“when there is a shortage against authorized strength on the ADL which cannot be met” ...
by other means;
under extraordinary circumstance (and the best interests of the Navy); or
“when a gross inequity to the applicant would otherwise result”.

In practice, this waiver has been disproportionately exercised for Catholic candidates, without
apparent regard to the “gross inequity” which flows to un-waived candidates.

The Student Program
In the accessions data which Defendants provided to their expert in 2005 (and which they provided
to the Larson Plaintiffs nine months later), there are nearly complete records of all candidates for
the Chaplain Corps who were considered by the C/A/R/E board between 1986 and 2005. [C/A/R/E
stands for Chaplain Accession and Recall Evaluation; not all applicants to the Chaplain Corps were
considered by the C/A/R/E board, many were blocked at the recruiter level.]
Among the 3,421 C/A/R/E decisions recorded in this data base, 945 were rendered for candidates
applying for accession under the Student Program.
Of the 945 applications which the C/A/R/E board agreed to consider, 13 were received from
candidates over the age of 40; seven of those were approved, i.e. granted waivers. Seven
candidates over the age of 40 were accepted into affiliation into the Student Program, with the
seeming expectation that when they graduated, and completed their leadership experience, they
might be offered Active Duty appointment.
Five of those seven students were Roman Catholic.

OPNAV (Naval Operations) INST (Instruction) 1120.9, “Appointment of Officers in the

* Based on the labor pool, as assayed by the Yearbook of Churches (2006);
8.89% of the clergy in America are Roman Catholic.

Even though the sample size in Table 2 is small, the statistical significance is obvious. [Chi square
= 26.64; p < .0001.]
The Navy has behaved here in a manner which is inconsistent with random variation;
the Navy has behaved here in a manner which suggests that Catholics get preferential treatment.
Supercession
The Navy does not invest much in the Student Program, other than the resources required to
manage it, but their return on investment is marginal, especially for Roman Catholics.
In the past 20 years, the Navy has accessioned 791 Chaplain candidates into the Student Program;
191 of these were Roman Catholic. In the past 20 years, the Navy has harvested 222 Active Duty
Chaplains from the Student Program; six of these were Roman Catholic. Clearly, the Navy’s
preference for Catholics is not based on their dependability as supercession candidates.

Direct Accession (the D4105A Program)
Although the Secretary of the Navy has described the Student Program as the “primary source” for
additions to the Active Duty List, as Table 3 shows, the program falls far short of this goal.
Direct accessions (the D4105-A Program) make up most of the difference. [Remaining ADL
requirements are met via recycling (Recall and Inter-Service Transfer.)]

In the past 20 years, where the Student Program contributed only 122 Chaplains to the Active Duty
List, direct accession via D-4105-A brought in 715 Chaplains.
And, again, in order to reach as many Catholics as possible, the DCNO granted a number of age
waivers.
Because there is a possibility of a difference in the likelihood of an age waiver as a function of the
candidate’s faith group cluster, as well as his or her age, and even a possible confounding in that
the applicant pool suffered a relative collapse in 2001, it is useful to separate the data counts along
each of these dimensions.

These data invite multi-variate analysis. An Analysis of Variance was applied to (a) the number of
candidates considered, (b) the number of candidates recommended for accessioning (note that
every candidate over the age of 40 who was recommended had to be granted a waiver), and (c) the
likelihood of being recommended for accessioning; across (1) age, (2) faith group cluster, and (3)
the shift at 2000/2001 in the data pool (and the Navy’s alleged termination of quotas).
The primary ANOVA table is appended here as Endnote 3.
Note that across every variable here, the Navy’s pattern of decisions is statistically significantly
different from even-handed with respect to denomination.
First, the number of cases considered is different than the number to be expected based on the
distribution of denominations in the labor pool. The Navy recruiters forwarded disproportionately
too many Catholic applications, and far too few applications from non-Liturgicals (p < .001).
Second, the number of cases recommended, even given the imbalance in the number considered,
shows that Roman Catholic candidates are given waivers more frequently than any other
denomination (p < .001).
Third, regardless of age, Catholics were recommended for accession more often than any other
denomination.

This preference for Catholics is particularly pronounced for the older candidates. A 98%
acceptance rate for candidates under 40 years old, with 75% of the non-Catholics being
recommended for accession, turns into an 85% acceptance rate for Catholic candidates over 41
years old, with only 33% of the older non-Catholics being recommended for accession ( p < .001;
p < .0004).
Fourth, there is an interaction in selection rate, faith group cluster and the Navy’s shift in quotas in
2000.
Prior to 2001, Liturgicals were preferred over non-Liturgicals; then in 2001 (when the law suits
started, and the quotas were supposedly abandoned) the preference for Liturgicals vs non-

Liturgicals reversed, and non–Liturgicals were selected in preference to Liturgicals. [If one picks
the time period carefully, as Dr. Siskin has done, this reversal can be averaged, leaving the (false)
impression that there was no difference in selection rates.] p < .03 (one tailed test.)
C/A/R/E board action reflects the delegated DCNO determination that an age waiver is to be
granted, but C/A/R/E board action is neither the beginning, nor the end, of the accession decision.
Prior to the C/A/R/E boards deliberations, recruiters and recruiter centers collect applications,
affirmatively seeking some, and discouraging others. And after C/A/R/E board recommendation,
assignment to active duty is contingent upon other priorities at DCNO and the availability of a
billet from COMNAVCRUITCOM.
Figure 1 graphically portrays what happens across this series of hurdles, reflecting both the
relationship between the candidate pools considered from the population of chaplains available to
serve, as well as the actions taken post C/A/R/E board review.

Note both (1) the extreme priority placed on Roman Catholic candidates over candidates from all
other denominations, at every step along the way, and (2) the systematic erosion of equity as
candidates are considered, recommended and assigned to Active Duty.
This pattern of results cannot have happened by random chance, p <.000 . . . 0001.

Of the more than 1,000 Chaplains who completed their careers in this 20 year period, 410 were
commissioned and then released from active duty before reaching retirement. Some of these were
released voluntarily, as in they decided on their own not to continue in service; some wanted to
stay but were forced out of the Service, as in CADRAG boards (Chaplain’s Active Duty Retention
Advisory Group) used to winnow the ranks.
On the other hand, the majority (61%) of the careers whose termination is recorded in these
Histories, ran full term and ended in retirement.
These data are a bottom line census; they are not a sample (except that they cover only 20 years).
This is not a distorted picture of what happens at just one small step in the overall personnel
management process; these data record the final outcome of every Chaplain’s enrollment into the
Chaplain Corps.

The data demonstrate that in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps, some denominations fare much better
than others.
Whether this is because the more successful, or better treated, denominations are better at doing the
job, or are simply just thought to be better, or whether for incidental and irrelevant reasons, some
denominations are supported and encouraged and others are not, or whether there is an underlying,
subliminal mechanism expressing prejudice, the statistical conclusion is certain:
There is evidence of statistical bias here.
Roman Catholics chaplains benefit in the system, largely at the seeming expense of the more
numerous, but less blessed non-Liturgical Chaplains.
Released from Active Duty is not necessarily a discharge, but it is a loss of opportunity to serve
and to be rewarded for Service.
Retired Chaplains end their careers at an average of 2/3 to 7/8 of a rank higher than those who are
released from active duty.
Catholics who are released from active duty (frequently because of voluntary refusal to extend their
tours) end their careers about where non-Catholics end theirs: roughly half of them make it to
LCDR; only about 5% of them make it to CDR.
Catholics who retire, retire at an average rank higher than non-Catholics; 55% of the retired
Catholics retire at CAPT or above; for non-Catholics this is only 43%.
These ratios (the patterns are clear in Figure 2) are statistically significant (binomial and Chi
Square) at beyond the .01 level (three standard deviations.)
1. Catholic Chaplains lose a few fewer of their numbers (37%) on the path toward retirement than
non-Liturgicals (40%), and the losses tend to be voluntary:
2. Catholic Chaplains tend to drop out in the early years of their careers. [The CADRAG data
show that virtually all of the Catholic Chaplains who want to continue in service are approved for
continuation.] On the other hand, non-Liturgical Chaplains tend to be forced out prior to their
entrance into the promotion zone for LCDR. [Again, this can be observed in the CADRAG board
decisions. (See Appendix E).]
3. In the curtailed careers (released vs retired) the Catholic candidates achieve slightly higher
average rank at the time of severance than the non-Liturgicals in particular, or indeed all the nonCatholics as a group. (See Figure 2.)

4. When the careers are allowed to run full term, (a) all the faith groups do better, i.e. rise further,
than their fellows who were dropped along the wayside (of course) but (b) the Roman Catholic
candidates achieve much higher average rank at the time of retirement than the non-Liturgicals in
particular, or indeed all the non-Catholics as a group. (See Figure 2.)

It may seem like a “small matter” that something fewer than six or seven (12 - 5.8 or 12 - 4.8)
“extra” Catholics were retired under medical terms while four or eight (10.3 - 6 or 14.6 - 6) nonLiturgicals failed to be granted that status. But:
•

This is statistically significant (Chi square = 16.21; p < .003 when compared to the total
population and Chi square = 8.75; p < .01 when compared to the population who were
released before being eligible for retirement under non-medical conditions.)

And:
•

In a milieu where every issue which can be subjected to numerical analysis shows a bias
which works to the advantage of Roman Catholic clergy and to the disadvantage of nonLiturgical clergy, the story being told is not just about one small impact here, and another
small impact there.

The pattern that emerges is a consistent practice which has the appearance of favoring Chaplains
who are Roman Catholics, and marginalizing Chaplains who are not Liturgical.
In a setting where the Roman Catholic denomination is always represented on the Promotion
Board, where Roman Catholic Chaplains routinely join the Chaplain Corps at a higher rank than
most other Chaplains, where Roman Catholic Chaplains are the presumptive beneficiaries of
numerous “perks” of office - for example being allowed to stay in the Service past their “required”
retirement age, being given “medical” retirements disproportionately more often than their peers,
passing through a revolving door to the Reserves, where they earn seniority and benefit for further
promotion, etc, in a setting like that, there is both the appearance of the Navy’s having established
a “preferred religion”, and the fact of widespread resentment among those who are not the
beneficiaries of such preferential treatment. [I cite as proof that there is widespread concern over
religious favoritism, the statements to that effect in the CNA Study3, in March 2000.]
It is my expert opinion in this matter that the Navy’s implementation of its Chaplain Corps
personnel management policies has achieved a pattern of results which is statistically incompatible
with the absence of denominational bias and which is consistent with the hypothesis that the Navy
has established a favorite denomination. That denomination is Roman Catholic, and the
disproportionate benefits which have been given to the preferred denomination have come, to a
large extent, from opportunities denied to non-Liturgical clergy, especially non-Baptist, nonLiturgical clergy.

Appendix C.
Catholics get proportionally much more than their “statistically fair share” of the promotions.

I have visited this issue in several Declarations.
Dr. Siskin routinely rejects my analysis by (a) disparaging it as “not a promotion study” or by (b)
criticizing it as “post hoc.” Then he substitutes data tallies which disaggregate both the data, and
the events underlying promotion to such an extent that he finds no evidence of differential
selection rates, and provides no opportunity to see the differences which are there.
There is no necessity here, to repeat my Declarations, nor to further rebut Dr. Siskin.
When the fog of argument is blown aside, the record speaks for itself. See Figure 2, above.
When their careers are over:
1.
2.
3.
4.

61% of the Roman Catholics who were commissioned, rose to CDR or above;
56% of the Liturgicals who were commissioned, rose to CDR or above;
48% of the non-Liturgicals who were commissioned rose to CDR or above;
26% of the special Worship Chaplains who were commissioned rose to CDR or
above.

Whatever the reasons for this result, whatever the justification and nuances, whatever the debates
about in zone and above zone, missing chaplains, age waivers and rank waivers, the bottom line
data, the anecdotal examples, and the statistical inferences converge:
•

At the end of everybody’s career, Catholics are 10%, 25% and 125% more likely to
be promoted to CDR, for example, than Liturgicals, non-Liturgicals and Special
Worship Chaplains.

Similarly:
•

At the end of everybody’s career, Catholics are 12%, 150% and 130% more likely
to be promoted to CAPT, for example, than Liturgicals, non-Liturgicals and Special
Worship Chaplains.

Appendix D.
Catholics are protected from exposure to Selective Early Retirement
In a Declaration published as an Appendix to my Compendium, I wrote:
“34. Table 1 compares Catholics to Non-Catholics, in terms of (a) the number potentially eligible
for consideration by the FY-95 Chaplain Commanders’ SER Board versus (b) the number who
were considered. It is to be noted that there is a clear tendency for Catholics not to be brought to
the attention of this SER Board.

[* Table 1 in the original source.]

“35. The statistical probability of choosing just 2 chaplains out of 53 (3.8%) for referral to a SER
Board, when the average probability is 14.2% or 18.3 %, is well outside the realm of statistical
likelihood and well within the standard of proof cited by Dr. Siskin (Reference 2).
“36. Considering the seeming “mechanical” nature of the rules for SER eligibility as established
in the SECNAV memorandum (Attachment 1 to Reference 4) as well as the fact that those rules
controlled the establishment of 38 different SER Boards, it seems at least improbable that there
was an ex-process, Faith-Based factor operating in the selection of Chaplains for consideration by
the FY-95 Chaplain Commanders’ SER Board. And yet, here we have proof of bias* as shown in
this statistical test (which one is invited to perform since Denomination is prominently displayed
on the Lineal List.)”

My observation that there is disparate impact in the Navy’s rules for determining eligibility for
SER has not been challenged or rebutted by the Defendant’s. Nor have the eligibility rules been
evaluated for face neutrality by them, nor has a case been made for the business reason for the
disparate impact.
Compounding the denominationally discriminatory nature of the Navy’s rules for determining a
priori eligibility for SER (above) is the denominationally discriminatory nature of the Navy’s
procedure for implementing SER.

Appendix E.
Continuation in Service Boards give de jure preference to Catholics
and halt career progress for many non-Catholics.
In a recent Declaration I reported on a series of Navy documents that came to me from a FOIA
request issued by a person I do not know.
These records report the existence of a Chaplain Corps personnel selection board whose purpose
was to select for continuance on Active Duty or recommend involuntary Release from Active Duty,
from among journeyman chaplains who had expressed the wish to continue on Active Duty. This
decision was made in a context which had explicit preference for Roman Catholics (see the
“critical shortage” language) and at least the potential for implicit preference for Liturgicals (75%
of the non-Catholic members of the CADRAG board were Liturgicals).
The net effect of these two pressures was:
1.

To retain all the Catholics who wanted to stay in service4.

2.

Because the CADRAG board was pressed to retain the Catholics and told to select a fixed
number of Chaplains for release, non-Catholics suffered under the reactive pressure to
eliminate “somebody”; and

3.

Because 75% of the non-Catholic members of the CADRAG board were Liturgicals, any
operation of “like, likes, like” would take a toll on the non-Liturgical Chaplains being
considered.

The data analysis bore this out.

Results
The data cover CADRAG decisions made concerning 246 chaplains who were both (a) eligible for
and (b) requested to be considered for, extension (or continuance) on active duty.
Table 11 summarizes the board’s decisions tallied by “faith group cluster” - but I have not used the
Navy’s “faith groups”. Instead of using the Navy’s (I) Roman Catholic, (II) Liturgical Protestant,
4

A surprising number of them drop out before their official tours are over. Catholics
lose nearly 9 times as many chaplains in their first year (5.1%) as do non-Baptist, non-Liturgicals
(0.6%). See Table K-7 in my Compendium.]

(III) Non-Liturgical Protestant and (IV) Special Worship Group, I used groups based on the Navy’s
de facto preference for denominations.
Recently (see “The Siskin Conjecture”), I have used an operational definition of “favored
denominations”. I simply look at which denominations the Navy assigns to its selection boards
(promotion boards, SER boards and C/A/R/E boards) and let that distribution define the de facto
preference pattern:
Tier I The denomination(s) which is/are assigned to all or to virtually all selection boards
This is Roman Catholics, and there is no “close second”.
Tier II The denominations which are frequently assigned to a selection board, but not “always”
assigned or even almost always assigned.
This is SB5
ELCA
PUSA
and UM

(They are on about half as many boards as the Catholics)
(They are on about 1/3 as many boards as the Catholics)
(They are on about 1/3 as many boards as the Catholics)
(They are on about 1/3 as many boards as the Catholics)

Tier III All other denominations.

This pattern of results (even without considering that the Siskin Conjecture predicts an ordering

three standard deviations.) Chance alone cannot account for this preference among the
denomination-based clusters.

Presbyterian Church of the USA; and UM stands for United Methodist.

This pattern is also consistent with the results from the 1981/82 C/A/R/E. In 1981 and 1982 the
C/A/R/E Board undertook a “continuation” consideration for 27 chaplains. Twelve of these
chaplains were Roman Catholic; ten were continued. Of the remaining 15 non-Catholic chaplains,
only 3 were continued.
It is clear, based on this analysis of the FOIA data and corroborated by the analysis of the 1981/82
C/A/R/E Advisory Group continuation considerations, that there is denominational preference at
work in the Corps’ decision about which denominations to allow to continue.
Catholics, as usual, are preferred over non-Catholics, and the second favorite denominations (three
Liturgical [ELCA, PUSA, and UM] and one non-Liturgical [SB] denomination) are preferred over
everybody else. This alone could account for the loss of non-Baptist, non-Liturgical “considers” as
the promotion board lists are prepared for LCDR, CDR and CAPT. [Catholics lose 3.1% of their
chaplains during the 3 years following entrance into the CDR zone; non-Baptist, non-Liturgicals
lose 11.7% during these three years.6]
Anecdotal Support for this systematic Denominational Preference
In the roughly 250 decisions which the CADRAG issued, four were overruled by the approving
authority, and one of the chaplains who had not asked to be considered for a continuation seems to
have been enticed into staying.
Of the four CADRAG decisions which the Chief of Chaplains reversed, three benefitted Roman
Catholics whom the CADRAG had recommended to Inactive Duty.
Ronald Chiasson had been recommended for RAD;
the CoC asked that he be extended until 1994.
Ref 17 indicates that he was RAD 10/90.
Leslie Colaco had been recommended for RAD;
the CoC asked that he be extended to age 60.
Ref 1 indicates a tour in Japan 90-92 followed by one in Iceland.
Stanley Czarnota had been recommended for RAD;
the CoC asked that he be extended.
Ref 1 indicates a tour in Maine 90-93 followed by one in Great Lakes.
One decision for an Alternate was changed to an “out”. CADRAG had recommended
Lyrice Marsh, a CFGC, for alternate status (in case the end strength allowance
provided a billet.) The CoC changed this.
Ref 1 indicates Marsh was RAD 9/89.

Chaplains Serving on Active Duty past the age of 62
Based on the Alpha Roster for 13 October 2006
I have been provided with a copy of a pdf file entitled “AD Chaplains: The White Pages”.
This is an 89 page alphabetical list of all the Chaplains on active duty, together with their rank,
duty station, address, and telephone and FAX contact information.
The list does not include any information about the Chaplain’s denomination or date of birth.
I used software to convert the pdf file to Rich Text.
I edited the text file in Word Perfect to omit everything except the Chaplain’s name and rank.
I converted that file into a “paste” module for an Excel spread sheet, entered it into Defendants’
accessions data base and sorted the records by name, noting the correspondence between presence
on the White Pages, and that chaplain’s accession record in the data base I received in July 2006.
For the names where there was a clear match, I estimated the Chaplain’s age on 13 October 2006
based on his/her age in the accessions data base on the record date in the data base.
There were 14 Chaplains over the age of 62.
There were 154 chaplains in the White Paper who were not in the Accessions data base. Some of
these, notably the LTJG and LT appointees and the “Pending” appointees, probably occurred after
the data period covered by the accessions data base; others, may have been accessioned before the
data period covered by the accessions data base.
I listed the missing names in alphabetical sequence and compared them to the Chaplain’s History,
Volume X. I found one name.
Here is my estimate of the Chaplains age 62 or over on Active Duty on 13 October 2006:

Declaration of Veronica K. Berto 9 March 2007
re:
Chaplains Serving on Active Duty past the age of 62

Veronica Berto swears under oath that she has been a Program Analyst in the Force Structure
Division of the Chief of Naval Chaplains’ Office since December 17, 1991.
One must assume that with this experience, and distance from the top, Ms. Berto is not mistaken or
uninformed.
Since she has been identified by the Defendants as a designated source witness, one must assume
that she speaks for the Defendants.
Among several other paragraphs, Ms. Berto swears:
“5. The recall of Retired Reserve chaplains described in paragraph 4 allows the Navy in general,
and the Chaplain Corps in particular, to utilize personnel with, as SECNAVAVINST 1820.2B,
SECNAVINST 1820.2C, and OPNAVINST 1820.1 all state, “critical professional skills.” In this
context, the six Roman Catholic chaplains currently recalled to active duty from the Retired
Reserve reflects (sic) the Chaplain Corps current shortfall of Roman Catholic chaplains to minister
to the needs of Roman Catholic Sailors and Marines.”
I am shocked!
First: As a “reasonable man” (if I may assume that status for myself), this statement seems to be a
flat contradiction to the Defendants’ posture in Larson that they stopped using quotas in planning
for accessions (by which in their use of the word they mean additions to the Active Duty List,
including “Recall”.) This is a clear example, to me, of the Navy saying one thing to one Court and
another thing to a different Court - but this is the same Judge. And that Judge believed the Navy in
Larson and found that since the Navy had stopped using quotas, the claim of discrimination based
on quotas was “moot”.
Second: Regardless of the misrepresentation in their pleadings to the Court in Larson, Ms. Berto
is here affirming that the Navy values Catholics especially, and the Navy is therefore justified in
waiving requirements that apply to other denominations, just so that the Navy can have more
Catholic chaplains.
There is no established, published, referenced standard supporting a so-called “shortfall” of Roman
Catholic chaplains in the Navy. There is only careless rhetoric, and unfounded folklore.

Third: Ms. Berto’s claim that there is a shortage of “critical professional skills” (in particular a
shortage of Catholic chaplains in the Navy) may be an honest belief on her part, or an embraced
mantra, but it is not an established fact. In military manpower planning, the word “shortage”, the
concept of “shortfall”, is not an opinion, it is a calculated result. One compares an approved
mission-based requirement to available resources and if there is a negative match (a shortfall), that
is called a shortage. And ameliorative action is justified.
In the present instance, the Catholic Church says that it has a shortage of priests - because it cannot
find enough young men to go into the priesthood, or enough ordained priests to staff all the
established parishes. The Catholic Church measures need by established parishes.
The Navy does not measure need; it merely asserts that there must be a shortage, because when
there was a Catholic as the Chief of Chaplains he said that there was a shortage, and the Navy {Ms.
Berto?}, ever loyal, has not challenged that assertion.
According to the best measures of the availability of clergy in the market place8 roughly 9% of the
clergy persons in the USA are Roman Catholic. And according to that source, which has published
a continuing series of estimates from 1916 to today, not all churches require the same number of
clergy per penitent. The orthodox (lower case “O”) denominations, including the Roman Catholic,
have, on the average, 1 clergy person per 2000 church members. The average for all other
denominations is 1 clergy person per 286 church members.
The Navy has, by its own count, some 124,0759 enlisted Sailors and Marines who identify
themselves as Roman Catholic, and (see the Material Facts asserted by the Defendants, cf Table 1)
there are 149 Roman Catholic chaplains. This is a ratio of 1 priest per 832 believers, or nearly
250% more priests per Catholic penitent in the Navy than occur in the general USA public.
That is not a shortage; it is an extravagance - at the expense of the non-Liturgical Sailors and
Marines who are under-served, in a system which fixes the total number of chaplains, and
arbitrarily picks too many Catholic Chaplains.

The National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA publishes the “Yearbook of
American & Canadian Churches”, a handbook of statistics and essays on religious practice in
Canada and America, including data on church membership and the numbers of clergy in North
America from 1916 to 2005. The data in this yearbook provide recent counts of clergy in the
USA totaling 546,665 - of whom 48,573 are Roman Catholic; this is 8.9%.

military service. A chaplain provides for the free exercise of

command-appointed individual who facilitates, within the
framework of the CRP, the free exercise of religion by providing
a service consistent with his or her lay status.

used in Article 0817 of reference (d) to refer to public worship
and faith-based services conducted afloat, in the field, or on

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I, JAMES FRANKLIN POE, declare as follows:
1.

My name is James Franklin Poe. I currently live at 735 Poplar Grove Road, Springville,

TN 38256. I have personal knowledge of and am competent to testify on the matters addressed
herein.
2.

I retired on 1 November 2006, as a Navy chaplain at the grade of Captain when I

reached the statutory retirement age. I had over 26 years of active duty as a Navy chaplain.
3.

I am endorsed by the Associated Gospel Churches, an association of Evangelical

churches whose members adhere to the classic fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith.
4.

From November 2001 to April 2005, I was the Regional Chaplain/Religious Ministries

Program Director for the Commander, Naval Region Europe (“CNRE”). I was stationed in
Naples, Italy, where I also had Religious Ministry oversight for US NATO forces assigned to the
Allied Forces Southern Command (AFSOUTH).
5.

My duties included responsibility for advising my Commander of Navy chaplain issues

and chapel activity support within CNRE or impacting it. This included the Naval Support
Activity (“NSA”) in Naples, Italy, which came under CNRE.
6.

I was very familiar with the chaplains and chapel activities at NSA Naples, as well as

chapel services at AFSOUTH Headquarters. Since NSA Naples reported to CNRE, it fell under
my area of responsibility.
7.

I have been asked by Mr. Arthur A. Schulcz, Sr., to comment on the Navy’s assertion

that “it has determined that chaplains in each [faith group] category are generally able to meet
the religious needs of personnel with needs encompassed by those categories” on page 37 of the
Defendants’ opposition to the Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in the above cited case
and its follow on assertion that non-liturgical chaplains “are generally able to meet the needs of
all Non-liturgical personnel”, citing a statement by Chaplain Wilder on page 38.
8.

Those statements or assumptions imply that a chaplain within a faith group category can

effectively minister to and meet the free exercise needs of all other personnel within that
category. My experience shows that this implication is not always true for liturgical Protestants
and it is much less true for the more diverse non-liturgical faith groups. Liturgical groups like
the Missouri Synod Lutherans will not share communion with many other liturgical faith groups.
Many liturgical faith groups possess different requirements for infant baptism and will not
baptize infants of parents who do not hold their particular faith distinctions. For non-liturgical
faith groups, the assumption is true only in those cases when there are no basic contradictions in
the different faith backgrounds. For example a Southern Baptist can often minister to other faith
groups who hold baptistic beliefs provided there are no other major theological differences.
9.

However, the statement or assumption by CH Wilder is false as a universal or even

general rule among non-liturgicals because of the reality of important theological differences
between non-liturgical faith groups, differences well known to the Chaplain Corps, even when
basic beliefs are shared between faith groups. Several examples below from my experience in
Naples illustrate the falsity of that assumption.

10.

Document 3-7

Page 3 of 8

The non-liturgical faith group category is made up of a wide variety of faith groups,

many of which hold differing theological positions and beliefs rejected by other faith groups or
denominations within the non-liturgical faith group cluster.
11.

These non-liturgical faith group differences include and are often reflected in their

worship and ministry styles. For example, Pentecostal and Charismatic personnel, while
believing many basic non-liturgical and Protestant beliefs and doctrines, have unique worship
practices and minister and worship in ways that are rejected by other faith groups in the nonliturgical faith group cluster.
12.

Pentecostal and Charismatic worship or ministry needs cannot be met by just any non-

liturgical chaplain just like a Protestant chaplain can not meet Roman Catholic needs. At
Naples, I was personally involved in this, and other ministry facts of life.
13.

A Pentecostal/Charismatic congregation brought together and molded into a faith

community by Pentecostal Chaplain (LCDR) John Gordy was the largest non-Catholic
congregation at NSA Naples. During CH Gordy’s leadership this congregation averaged about
160 congregants at its Sunday service. Because no chaplain of like faith and practice who could
meet this group’s free exercise needs was detailed to Naples to relieve Chaplain Gordy, a Chief
Petty Officer Lay Leader volunteered to assume the religious leadership responsibilities for this
congregation provided it did not interfere with his regular duties.
14.

The second largest Protestant service in Naples was the non-liturgical Contemporary

Worship Service lead by Chaplain (LCDR) Joseph Dufour (Evangelical). This congregation
averaged 130 congregants under Chaplain Dufour’s leadership. A third non-liturgical Protestant
service was held at AFSOUTH under the leadership of Chaplain (LCDR) Armando Torralva
(Evangelical) which averaged 50 to 75 congregants. The only other Protestant congregation at

Page 3 of 8

07mc269
EXHIBIT 6

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3-7

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 4 of 8

NSA Naples was a small liturgical congregation under the leadership of Chaplain (CDR) Pat
Hahn (Lutheran) which averaged less than 10 congregants. This situation illustrates the well
known fact that the vast majority of Protestants serving in the Navy are Evangelical or
Pentecostal/Charismatic non-liturgicals. Thus, the demand for detailing, especially in religiously
isolated overseas locations, is for Evangelical and Pentecostal/Charismatic non-liturgicals.
15.

But instead of detailing chaplains from Evangelical or Pentecostal non-liturgical faith

groups to Naples, the Chaplain Corps detailed three chaplains, one each, from the Church of
Christ, the Christian Churches and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The Church of Christ
and Christian Churches are two almost theologically identical churches, except that the Church
of Christ denomination (with a small number of adherents compared to other faith groups) does
not believe in the use of musical instruments during their worship service; its members sing
hymns a cappella. All three of these churches have small numbers of adherents, are not
representative of the majority of Protestants, and issue from the same geographical region and
historical religious movement.
16.

The Roman Catholic NSA Naples Command Chaplain appeared to be totally unfamiliar

with Protestant denominations or beliefs.
A.

He initially placed a liturgical Lutheran Chaplain over the non-liturgical,

Evangelical congregation at AFSOUTH when Chaplain Torralva transferred. He did this
even though Chaplain Dufour (Evangelical) requested that he be allowed to serve that
congregation in addition to his Contemporary Worship Service at the Support Site while
he remained in Naples.
B.

But Chaplain Hahn could not adapt to provide for the worship needs of this

congregation, which led to restlessness and sharp conflict between the chaplain and the

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

congregation.
C.

To meet the religious needs of this Evangelical, non-liturgical congregation and

to bring peace to the congregation and the NSA Chaplain’s Office, I personally assumed
the religious ministry duties for this congregation bringing a heavy burden upon myself.
My regular duties required extensive travel throughout Europe for the Regional
Command and entailed arduous administrative responsibilities. Forcing me to work
seven days a week, all that I could provide for this worthy congregation was to lead
Sunday services.
D.

This situation continued while two chaplains at NSA Naples were virtually

without jobs, having no congregations to minister to on Sundays.
17.

The Roman Catholic NSA Naples Command Chaplain also insisted that one non-

liturgical could satisfy all other non-liturgical worship needs. He initially planned to place the
“non instrumental” chaplain in charge of the Protestant Contemporary Worship service, the
second largest Protestant congregation in Naples, when Chaplain Dufour, who was then leading
that service, rotated out of Naples.
18.

The Naples Command Chaplain’s actions required my intervention to convince the NSA

Naples Command that this would be a disaster for the Contemporary Worship Service at the
Support Site. A “contemporary worship” service is built around the service’s music ministry.
This includes effectively integrating musicians (and their instruments) who can play
contemporary Christian music into the service, making them an integral and basic part of it.
19.

Placing a chaplain in charge of the Contemporary Service who did not believe in using

musical instruments during worship would have effectively killed that service. This would have
been a gross disservice to the members of that congregation, unnecessarily hindering and

EXHIBIT 6

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 6 of 8

burdening their free exercise of religion since the isolated nature of NSA Naples and the Italian
culture did not provide many worship options off base for non-liturgicals.
20.

In fact, the Contemporary Worship Service at the NSA Support Site and the Evangelical

Worship Service at AFSOUTH were virtually destroyed by this Chaplain Corps’ detailing
disaster. After I transferred out, the service at AFSOUTH was eventually closed, suffering a
slow death without a dedicated minister to provide essential ministry. I recently learned that the
Contemporary Worship Service at the Support Site, under the leadership of an Evangelical
Protestant Command Chaplain who replaced the Roman Catholic Command Chaplain at NSA
Naples, was experiencing renewed growth, until he was surprisingly deployed as an Individual
Augmentee to the Combined Joint Task Force in Djibouti, Africa.
21.

A like adverse detailing situation existed at NAS Rota, Spain. The two largest

congregations in Rota were a Pentecostal/Charismatic service and a service which would be
described as Evangelical, non-liturgical. Instead of detailing a Pentecostal/Charismatic chaplain
and an Evangelical non-liturgical chaplain to meet the ministry needs of those two large
congregations, two liturgical, non-Evangelical chaplains (both United Methodist) were detailed
in their place.
22.

These examples illustrate the failure of the Chaplain Corps leadership to appreciate or

address the fundamental differences in beliefs and traditions within the non-liturgical faith group
cluster and the fallacy of the “one non-liturgical chaplain fits all” mentality.
23.

They also illustrate an underlying indifference, if not hostility, to the free exercise needs

of non-liturgical faith groups, especially those considered Evangelical.
24.

In Naples, I often commented that the failure of the Chaplain Corps leadership to

adequately recognize non-liturgical free exercise needs resulted in chaplains sitting around with

Page 6 of 8

07mc269
EXHIBIT 6

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3-7

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 7 of 8

nothing to do because the chaplains’ worship capabilities and backgrounds did not match the
Naples Chapel community free exercise needs. During one period, there were three chaplains
serving in the shrinking Contemporary Worship Service at the Support Site while a part time,
non-chaplain, Lay Leader ministered in the largest Protestant worship service in Naples.
25.

These failures to recognize or meet the identified free exercise needs at Naples were not

accidents or mere slip ups. As part of my CNRE Regional Chaplain/Religious Ministries
Program Director responsibilities, I made numerous efforts to ensure that a Pentecostal or
Charismatic chaplain was detailed to replace Chaplain Gordy when he left Naples. I also made
numerous appeals to detail Evangelical non-liturgical chaplains to provide for the ministry needs
of the large Evangelical non-liturgical Congregations at the Support Site and at AFSOUTH.
26.

This included a personal visit with the Chaplain Corps detailer at Millington, TN while I

was on leave in the States. The detailer at that time was liturgical chaplain CAPT Alan Baker,
now the Deputy Chief of Chaplains/Chaplain of the Marine Corps. I endeavored to make sure he
understood the necessity for a Pentecostal or Charismatic chaplain replacement for CH Gordy
and for Evangelical non-liturgical chaplains to replace Chaplains Torralva and Dufour because
of those congregations’ impact and importance in the Naples Chapel Community.
27.

Unfortunately, my pleas and efforts with the Chaplain Corps leadership to make sure that

these congregations’ free exercise needs were met fell on deaf ears, and CH Gordy left Naples
with no Pentecostal or Charismatic replacement, even as Chaplains Torralva and Dufour left
with no like faith group replacements.
28.

These are not the only examples of Navy Chaplain Corps indifference to the free exercise

needs of its non-liturgical personnel, but they clearly illustrate the false assumption I was asked
to address, specifically “whether a non-liturgical chaplain can effectively minister to and meet

EXHIBIT 6

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 3-7

Page 8 of 8

the free exercise needs of all other non-liturgical personnel.”
29.

Having put much effort into trying to obtain the right chaplain faith group mix at Naples

and Rota without success, I believe the failure to provide the necessary chaplain resources at
those overseas, religiously isolated bases to match the free exercise needs of its non-liturgical
personnel was not an accident but a symptom of an underlying bias against non-liturgicals.
I make this declaration under the penalty of perjury, it is true and accurate to the best of
my ability, and it represents the testimony I would give if called upon to testify in a court of law.

2

Q.

How were those needs communicated to you?

3

A.

Usually those needs would come from the

4 command chaplains in the field.
5

Q.

How typically would they report that to

6 you?
7

A.

In the sense that, you know, I already had

8 a good sense of it by just looking at the people who
9 were there and seeking, again, to provide a mix -10 what I called a mix of individuals from different
11 faith groups, again depending on the size of the
12 command and how many chaplains you had would
13 determine what kind of mix you could put at any
14 particular place.
15

Q.

When you talked to the plans and policies

16 branch, did you express a need for specific chaplains
17 by denomination?
18

A. I do not recall talking in specific terms

19 of that. I was more interested in just the hard
20 numbers at that particular time because of the
21 shortage of chaplains and not being able to fill
22 billets, leaving them open.
23

For me it was more a matter of just hard

24 terms of numbers, regardless of the denomination or
25 faith-group mix of the chaplains.

Q.

Can you answer the question?

11

A.

I can answer the question.

12

I probably provided information because of

13 the shortage of Catholic chaplains, would have
14 provided the kind of information to them that, you
15 know, there is a shortage of Catholic chaplains, and
16 we cannot get some Catholic chaplains at commands
17 where we need them.

Q.

Other than Catholics, you can't remember

19 any other -20

A.

You're talking about in terms of the other

21 specific groups like liturgical and nonliturgical.
22

Q. Yes.

23

A.

No. From my standpoint that was not an

24 issue, again, looking at hard numbers.

Q.

Chaplain Carter, when you were in the

7 detailing shop, were you ever aware of specific
8 faith-group requirements for a specific religious
9 community that may have developed at a specific post?
10
11

Do you understand my question?
A. I do, and I'm trying to think if I recall

12 any one in particular. I don't recall one.
13

Q.

It's been reported to me, for instance,

14 there was a large charismatic congregation at Rota,
15 Spain, consistently. Are you -16

A. I'm not familiar with that.

17

Q.

Nobody would tell you that you needed a,

18 let's say, a charismatic or Pentecostal or someone
19 for a contemporary service at a specific post?
20

A. If that would have been necessary, I would

21 have expected the command chaplain to communicate
22 that with me. I don't recall that specifically for
23 any community.

Q.

So the way that you would be apprised of

25 that is that the command chaplain would communicate

Too Many Catholic Priests?
A statistical analysis by Harald R. Leuba, PhD.
Is there a shortage of Catholic priests, in the world at large, in America in general, in the U.S.
Navy Chaplain Corps?
As usual with such questions, the answer is “it depends”. The answer depends upon whom one
asks, what one means by “shortage” and what one accepts as evidence.
The purpose of this declaration is to report on an analysis of the comparative availability of
clergy of different denominations (especially Roman Catholic) in the labor pool, in comparison
to their density in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps. In the end, the data will show that whatever
the situation may be in the broader community, Catholic priests are statistically over-represented
in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps
First Approximation
According to the best available data1 Roman Catholic clergy account for about 9% of all the
Clergy in America, and about 25% of all clergy in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps.
1

The National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, “Yearbook of American &
Canadian Churches”, a handbook of statistics and essays on religious practice in Canada and
America, including data on church membership and the numbers of clergy in North America
from 1916 to 2005. The data in this yearbook provide recent counts of clergy in the USA
numbering 546,665 - of whom 48,573 are Roman Catholic; this is 8.9%. Meanwhile, Defendants
have offered “Material Facts” admitting that Roman Catholic priests fill roughly 22% of the new
appointments to Active Duty billets, and hold nearly 33% of the ranks at and above Captain.

On the face of it, this is three times the Catholic’s “fair share.” (The disparity in proportions is
statistically significant at 8 ½ standard deviations; binomial test 48,573/546,665 vs 181/894 .)
The complicating factor here is that the number of priests per penitent is higher for Roman
Catholics than for any other of the Navy’s faith group clusters.

The obvious disparity here in the ratio of clergy to church-members has lead to a careless
characterization of the situation as a “shortage of Roman Catholic priests”.
It is transparent that Catholic priests service five to eight times as many church members as any
other faith group cluster manages, but this is not proof of a shortage. It may be nothing more nor
less than a reflection of how they serve; it need not be (a) an absolute “shortage” and (b) even if it
is said to be evidence of a shortage, it need not be a specifically Catholic shortage.
Just as with any other profession, priests may have duties or methods which reduce workload, or
leverage skills, knowledge and attention. Maybe because of management efficiencies it just takes
fewer priests to administer to a Catholic flock.
If one looks inside the Navy data, and beyond the artificial “faith group cluster” boundaries of the
Navy’s categorization scheme, we can observe that there are other denominations that are “like”
Roman Catholic in structure (and service delivery) who are not included in the Navy’s “Catholic”
faith group cluster. These denominations also have high ratios of membership to clergy.
In fact, as a group, these Catholic-like denominations here in America average nearly twice as
many members per clergy person as is achieved by the Roman Catholics. This demonstrates that
(a) although the Roman Catholic church may have fewer priests than it believes are an ideal
service ratio, or fewer indeed than the Navy opines that it needs, (b) the Catholic ratio of clergy
to serviced-personnel is well below the limit of practical functionality - as evidenced by the
survival of these other “similar” denominations.
As the table below shows, the Roman Catholic ratio of clergy to church membership is just over
1200 members per priest, but the 20 “similar” denominations (ranging from Greek Orthodox to
the Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East), are spread nearly twice as thinly (or
alternatively are nearly twice as efficient) with an average just over 2000 members per clergy
person.

* There are slight differences between this table and the earlier table because this table is based on one year, and the
earlier data is an average across ten years.

If the Catholic church says that it has a shortage, that is a comment upon the Church’s staffing
goals. Except that the Navy is in the marketplace competing for priests, the Church’s view of a
shortage is neither relevant to the Navy, nor support for the Navy’s preferential accession
policies.
Second approximation
The Navy does not publish the religious demographics of its officer corps, but it has collected the
data from time to time, and the DOD does collect information about the religious preferences of
enlisted personnel.
According to these surveys, for example the 02-00 Defense Manpower Data Center religious
preference report, the Navy had125,892 military personnel professing preference for the Roman
Catholic faith, out of 353,539 respondents with a preference. And it had, at that time, 181
Catholic chaplains. This ratio works out to one priest per 695 service members - which looks
like a long-ratio when compared to the Non-Liturgical ratio of 494 chaplains per sailor. But it is
twice as high as the ratio of priests per Catholic believer in the civilian population.

One could harbor the view that the Navy’s ratio of Catholic chaplains to the population being
served is twice what it should be (i.e. twice as high for Catholics in the Navy as for Catholics in
America at large.) [The binomial z here corresponds to 6 standard deviations.]
Third Approximation
The view that the Catholics are over-represented in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps is bolstered by
observing that when compared to a Non-liturgical sailor, a Catholic serviceman or woman has
almost five times as much chaplain support as the Navy Chaplain Corps offers to its “blue collar”
sailors. [The binomial z here corresponds to 38 standard deviations.]

Summary
Whether measured (1) on the basis of proportion accessioned from the population available to
serve, or (2) on the basis of the number of clergy needed to provide the same level of benefit to
those in Naval service as they had/have in civilian life, or (3) in comparison to the level of
chaplain service offered to any other faith group cluster, the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps has
significantly more Catholic chaplains - two to three times more - than the operation of chance
would allow.
It is my formal opinion that this finding is statistically significant beyond every standard of
uncertainty. The U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps personnel management system favors Catholic
clergy and Catholic sailors over all others, and disadvantages Non-Liturgical clergy, and NonLiturgical sailors.

AD, and FTNGD under specific authorities. The training and support categories provide the
Secretaries concerned the flexibility of developing policies to maximize RC utilization as stated
in paragraph 6.2.
6.3.1.1. Training. All RC members shall receive training pursuant to assignments
and required readiness levels. Required training shall provide for the minimum training time or
number of training periods required for attaining the prescribed unit readiness status and
maintaining individual proficiency. The primary purpose of all training is the enhancement of
individual skills and/or unit effectiveness. Training may be conducted in ID, AD, or FTNGD
status. Mission support may be a key element in developing training programs, but training shall
be the paramount consideration and documented for budgetary allocations. Mission and
operational support may occur as a consequence of training. Required training is further
delineated in section 6.6.
6.3.1.2. Support. Voluntary Duty (AD and FTNGD) may be used to achieve desired
readiness levels and meet mission requirements.
6.3.1.3. Mobilization. Involuntary AD is used in support of military operations when
the President or the Congress determines that RC forces are required to augment the AC. It is
provided for within the provisions of sections 12301 and 12302 of Reference (g) for full and
partial mobilization, respectively, section 12304 of Reference (g) for Presidential Reserve CallUp authority, and section 712 of Reference (h) for Secretary of Homeland Security Coast Guard
Reserve call-ups for domestic emergencies. For other purposes, the Secretaries concerned may
order members involuntarily to AD pursuant to provisions of sections 12301(b) or 12303 of
Reference (g) and section 712 of Reference (h).
6.3.1.4. Other. Includes FHD, a voluntary status pursuant to the provisions of section
12503 of Reference (g) or section 115 of Reference (i), that shall be considered a special
category of ID, and MD, established in section 12319 of Reference (g). It also includes
voluntary AD for the purposes of medical evaluation and treatment pursuant to sections 12301(h)
and 12322 of Reference (g); special circumstances to include: voluntary AD at National Guard
Bureau pursuant to section 12402 of Reference (g); members ordered to AD for unsatisfactory
participation pursuant to sections 10148 and 12303 of Reference (g); RC members in a captive
status, pursuant to section 12301(g) of Reference (g); members ordered to AD for disciplinary
purposes pursuant to section 802(d) of Reference (g); and for Federal service due to insurrection
pursuant to sections 331, 332 and 12406 of Reference (g).
6.4. Assignment Restrictions Outside the United States
6.4.1. A member of the RCs shall not be assigned to AD on land outside the United
States, its territories and possessions, until the member has completed the basic training
requirements of the member's Armed Force pursuant to section 671(a) of Reference (g).

6.4.2. FTNGD shall not be performed on land outside the United States, its territories or
possessions, because a member of the RCs must be in a status provided for in Reference (g).
6.5. Placement of RC Members in RCCs and TRCs
6.5.1. The uniform reserve training and retirement categories are defined in Enclosure 6.
6.5.2. Pursuant to section 115(e) of Reference (g), each unit and member of the RCs not
counted in AD end strengths pursuant to section 115 of Reference (g) shall be placed in one of
the RCCs and TRCs identified. Individuals shall be assigned to RCCs and TRCs based on their
RC obligations to meet mission requirements and training requirements.
6.5.3. Table 1 at Enclosure 6 establishes authorized RCCs and TRCs in the RCs for
training and accountability purposes. Enclosure 5 describes those categories.
6.6. Training Participation Requirements
6.6.1. The Secretaries concerned shall establish standards for satisfactory participation at
required training periods, which shall include the number and percentages of training periods for
meeting the minimum standards, pursuant to DoD Directive 1215.13 (Reference (n)).
Individuals attending IDT periods are required to meet those minimum training standards. Those
standards shall contain procedures for accounting for absences and excused training periods, as
necessary. Individuals may voluntarily attend additional IDT periods for points, if authorized by
the Secretary concerned.
6.6.2. There is no statutory maximum annual limit on required training for members of
the National Guard.
6.6.3. To ensure that trained and qualified RC units and individuals are available for AD
throughout the entire spectrum of requirements, including war or national emergency,
contingency operations, military operations other than war, operational support, and at such other
times as the national security may require, and that funds appropriated annually for RC training
and operations are adequate for meeting these requirements, the Secretary concerned shall
establish necessary criteria and procedures to:
6.6.3.1. Approve any additional IDT as necessary and consistent with law.
Authorizing and utilizing additional training is subject to the categories, limitations, and controls
in paragraph 6.1.2.6.
6.6.3.2. Ensure that all RC members receive training according to assignments and
required readiness levels. Minimum training requirements are provided for in section 10147 of
Reference (g), section 502(a) of Reference (h), and further prescribed in paragraphs 6.1.2., 6.1.4.,
6.1.5., and 6.6.4.

6.6.3.3. Provide for training for the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), Standby
Reserve, and Retired Reserve in a voluntarily status according to the procedures described
below.
6.6.4. Training Requirements by Personnel Category
6.6.4.1. Selected Reserve
6.6.4.1.1. IDT. Except as specifically provided below, members of the Selected
Reserve, excluding AGRs, shall participate in 48 scheduled drills or training periods each year.
This requirement applies to all members of Selected Reserve units; however, the Secretary
concerned may, except in the case of the ARNGUS or the ANGUS, reallocate the number of
scheduled drills within a Reserve component where warranted to achieve readiness
requirements. The Secretary concerned may reduce the number of scheduled drills of selected
lower priority units and increase the scheduled drills of higher priority units by not more than 10
percent, rounded to the nearest whole number. The aggregate number of scheduled drills within
a component shall not be reduced by this reallocation (section 10147 of Reference (g) and
section 502 of Reference (i)). IDT requirements for individual Selected Reserve members not
assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, or IMAs, shall be determined by the organization
to which assigned and resourced by the appropriate Service component pursuant to Reference
(m).
6.6.4.1.2. AT. AT is required for all members of the Selected Reserve, excluding
AGRs. For members of the Reserves, ADT for purposes of AT shall be for not less than 14 days,
12 days for the Coast Guard Reserve, (exclusive of travel time) each year, except as provided in
paragraph 6.6.4.1.2.1. Units of the National Guard are required to perform full-time military
training for at least 15 days each year (including travel) pursuant to section 502 of Reference (i).
6.6.4.1.2.1. AT for IMAs or other Selected Reserve members not assigned to
a unit organized to serve as a unit, and in training categories ordered to AD for AT at
headquarters, support organizations, or to activities not operating on Saturday, Sunday, or
Federal holidays, normally is limited to 12 days excluding travel time (i.e., from Monday of the
first week through Friday of the second week). Such training may begin on any day of the week
to maximize training opportunities, or to support a training event or activity.
6.6.4.1.2.2. When required, members may be ordered to AT for longer
periods than those minimum periods established in paragraphs 6.6.4.1.2. and 6.6.4.1.2.1. up to a
maximum of 30 days each FY, for activities that enhance readiness or provide support to
operational missions that results from the required training. Training may begin on any day of
the week to maximize training opportunities, or support a training event or activity.
6.6.4.1.2.3. Annual training normally is performed during one consecutive
period. Split tours may be authorized for selected units or individuals, if required to meet
training missions or enhance mission support associated with required training. Any additional

costs must be fully justified. Authorization for variations in AT lengths shall be managed
pursuant to Directives established by the Secretary concerned.
6.6.4.1.3. Periods of AD or FTNGD Performed by Members of the Selected
Reserve. AD performed pursuant to sections 12301(d), 12302, 12304, and 12406 of Reference
(g), or FTNGD performed pursuant to section 502(f) of Reference (i) may not be substituted for
training required by section 10147 of Reference (g) or section 502(a) of Reference (i) and by
paragraph 6.6.4.1.2. unless in the judgment of the Secretary concerned:
6.6.4.1.3.1. AD performed pursuant to sections 12301(d), 12302, 12304, or
12406 of Reference (g) or FTNGD performed pursuant to section 502(f) is equivalent to the
training that might have been performed under the authority of section 10147 of Reference (g) or
section 502(a) of Reference (i) and paragraph 6.6.4.1.2.
6.6.4.1.3.2. AD performed pursuant to sections 12301(d), 12302, 12304, or
12406 of Reference (g) or FTNGD performed pursuant to section 502(f) when combined with
training required by section 10147 of Reference (g) or section 502(a) of Reference (i) and
paragraph 6.6.4.1.2. constitutes an undue personal hardship.
6.6.4.1.4. IADT. Initial AD training is a sub-category of ADT used to provide
basic military training and technical skill training required for all enlisted accessions. For nonprior service (NPS) persons who are qualified for induction for active duty in an Armed Force
(generally male citizens and resident aliens between the ages of 18 1/2 and 26 years of age) and
who are not under orders to report for induction under the Military Selective Service Act (50
U.S.C. App 451 et seq., Reference (o)), IADT shall be for a period as provided in section 671 of
Reference (g), to commence, insofar as practical, within 270 days after the date of enlistment
pursuant to section 12103 of Reference (g). For all other enlistees and inductees, the period of
IADT shall be prescribed by the Secretary concerned to commence, insofar as practical, within
360 days after entry into Service, except that in time of war or national emergency declared by
Congress or the President, basic training (or its equivalent) shall be for a period of not less than
12 weeks pursuant to section 671(b) of Reference (g). Periods of basic training or equivalent
training shorter than 12 weeks may also be established by the Secretary concerned for members
who have been credentialed in a medical profession or occupation and are serving in a healthcare
occupational specialty pursuant to section 671(c) of Reference (g). Enlisted members receiving
stipends under the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program (AFHPSP) for
Reserve Service are not required to participate in Ready Reserve training until they have
completed their educational training pursuant to sections 671(b), 12103, and 16201 of Reference
(g).
6.6.4.1.5. The Secretaries concerned may require members enlisted for service in
the Selected Reserve to participate in IDT periods before completing IADT. Those training
periods shall be with pay. Voluntary participation in IDT before completing IADT may be
authorized in either a pay or non-pay status.

6.6.4.1.6. Pursuant to section 10147(b) of Reference (g), an individual Reservist
may not be required to perform a period of ADT if the first day of that period falls during the last
120 days of the member's required membership in the Ready Reserve if the member has served

requirements pursuant to sections 10149, 10204, 10205, 10206, 12319, and 12644 of Reference
(g). Exemptions from IRR screening during one FY are authorized for members who served on
AD during the FY; who reside outside geographical limitations established by the Secretaries
concerned or the Commandant of the Coast Guard when not operating as a Service in the Navy;
who are in the grade of O-4 or higher, and have no remaining required period of membership in
the Ready Reserve; or, who were successfully screened in the preceding FY. Under no
circumstances should a member serve an initial period in the IRR of more than 18 months
without participating in a screening either during an annual muster day, during a period of
training, or through some other means. The Secretaries concerned are required to maintain
records on the current status of each member's physical condition, dependency status, military
qualifications, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, present address, and other
necessary information to facilitate a call-up to active duty, as prescribed.
6.6.4.2.2. Members of the IRR, including individuals enlisting directly into the
IRR, may participate voluntarily in IDT, for points only, pursuant to the regulations of the
Military Services. Those IRR members participating in approved programs outside the
Department of Defense (Enclosure 7) may participate in IDT, with pay, if that pay is
reimbursable from the supported non-DoD organization to the Department of Defense.
6.6.4.2.3. Members of the RCs, not subject to mandatory training, shall be
encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis to maintain their mobilization readiness.
However, the opportunity to participate voluntarily in training, with pay, is subject to manpower
and other resource limitations as determined by the Secretary concerned.
6.6.4.2.4. Members of the ING shall muster with their assigned unit once a year
to maintain their ING status and unit affiliation. They shall not participate in any training
activities in either a pay or points only status, and are not eligible for promotion.
6.6.4.3. Standby Reserve. The Standby Reserve consists of personnel who maintain
their military affiliation without being in the Ready Reserve pursuant to sections 10141, 10150,
10151, 10152, and 10153 of Reference (g) and DoD Directive 1235.9 (Reference (p)).

"key employee" by the employer, and approved as such by the appropriate RC personnel
management office. Members shall remain in that Standby Reserve status for the period of time
they remain designated and approved as a “key employee.” Employers who designate Ready
Reserve members as “key employees” must request removal of those members from the Ready
Reserve pursuant to DoD Directive 1200.7 (Reference (q)).
6.6.4.3.2. Inactive Status List. Members of the Standby Reserve Inactive Status
List may not participate for points, pay, or promotion credit and may not be considered for

to Reference (p). Personnel enrolled in a military school course, including correspondence
courses, when transferred from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve Inactive Status List
may continue voluntary participation in the course until completion. Those personnel shall not
be entitled to pay and allowances, travel and transportation, or earn retirement points for that
training.
6.6.4.4. Retired Reserve. This category consists of all personnel transferred to the
Retired Reserve and are subject to mobilization pursuant to DoD Directive 1352.1 (Reference
(r)). Retirees may voluntarily train with organizations to which they are properly pre-assigned
by orders for recall to AD in a national emergency or declaration of war. Such training shall be
limited to that training made available within the resources authorized by the Secretary
concerned. The Retired Reserve consists of the following categories:

UNIFORM RESERVE, TRAINING, AND RETIREMENT CATEGORIES
E5.1. RESERVE COMPONENT CATEGORIES (RCCs)
Categories identifying an individual's status in a RC. There are three RCCs: The Ready
Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. Each member of the National Guard and
Reserve is assigned within one of those categories. (All National Guard members, including
those in the ING, are in the Ready Reserve.)
E5.1.1. Ready Reserve Categories. The Ready Reserve is comprised of military members of
the Reserve and National Guard, organized in units or as individuals, or both, and liable for
involuntary order to AD in time of war or national emergency pursuant to sections 12301 and
12302 of Reference (g) and section 712 of Reference (h) in the case of members of the Coast
Guard Reserve. The Ready Reserve consists of three sub-categories: the Selected Reserve, the
IRR, and the ING.
E5.1.1.1. Selected Reserve. The Selected Reserve consists of those units and individuals
in the Ready Reserve designated by their respective Service, and approved by the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have priority over all
other Reserves. All Selected Reservists are in an active status. They are trained as prescribed in
section 10147(a)(1) of Reference (g) or section 502(a) of Reference (i), as appropriate. In
addition to the involuntary call up authorities set out in the previous paragraph, members of the
Selected Reserve may also be involuntarily called to AD to augment the active forces for any
operational mission pursuant to section 12304 of Reference (g). The Selected Reserve includes
the following:
E5.1.1.1.1. Selected Reserve Units. Units manned and equipped to serve and/or train
either as operational or as augmentation units. Operational units train and serve as units.
Augmentation units train together, but when mobilized, lose their unit identity and become part
of an AC unit or activity. Selected Reserve units include:
E5.1.1.1.1.1. Drilling Unit Reservists. Trained unit members participating in unit
training activities on a part-time basis shall have the RCC and TRC designator of "SA."
E5.1.1.1.1.2. Unit Full-Time Support (FTS) Personnel
E5.1.1.1.1.2.1. AGR. National Guard or Reserve members of the Selected
Reserve serving on AGR duty assigned or attached to Selected Reserve units (to include fulltime National Guard duty), as defined in section 101 of Reference (g), for the purposes of
organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the RCs, who may also perform
other duties as prescribed in section 12310 of Reference (g). All such AGR members must be
assigned against, or attached to, an authorized mobilization position in the unit they support.
They shall have the RCC and TRC designator of "SG."

E5.1.1.1.1.2.2. Military Technician (Dual Status) (MT). A civilian employee
of the Military Department concerned who is required, as a condition of civilian employment, to
maintain military membership in a Reserve component and who is assigned to a position as a
technician in the administration and training of such Reserve component, or in the maintenance
and repair of supplies or equipment issued to such Reserve component. The military and civilian
position skills of MTs must be compatible. MTs are not accounted for separately in RCC/TRC
categories. Accordingly, these MTs are accounted for in Reserve end strengths as Drilling Unit
Reservists (E5.1.1.1.1. of this Enclosure), and, as such, are accountable under the TRC
designator of "SA." NOTE: There are certain technicians providing unit FTS who are not
required to maintain military membership (i.e., non-dual status technicians) and others who are
not required to hold compatible military and civilian positions.
E5.1.1.1.1.2.3. Non-Dual Status Technician (NDST). NDSTs are not
accounted for in RCC/TRC categories. A civilian employee employed as a technician before
November 18, 1997, pursuant to any of the authorities specified in section 10217(b) of Reference
(g) and is not a member of the Selected Reserve or after that date has ceased to be a member of
the Selected Reserve or is employed pursuant to section 709 of Reference (i) in a position
designated pursuant to subsection (c) of that section and when hired was not required to maintain
membership in the Selected Reserve. NDST shall encumber only those technician positions
identified by the Secretary concerned as NDST positions.
E5.1.1.1.1.2.4. AC. AC personnel are not accounted for in RCC/TRC
categories. Members of the active forces of the Military Services, paid from AC military
personnel appropriations, assigned or attached to National Guard or Reserve units to provide
advice, liaison, management, administration, training, and/or maintenance support in the
category of FTS pursuant to section 12501 of Reference (g). These members are not part of the
Selected Reserve, but may deploy with their assigned unit, should it mobilize. AC members
performing FTS are counted as part of trained strength in units, but not in the Selected Reserve
strengths.
E5.1.1.1.1.2.5. Civil Service Employees (CIV). CIVs are not accounted for
in RCC/TRC categories. Such personnel are hired pursuant to section 3101 of 5 U.S.C.
(Reference (u)) to provide administrative support to RC units. They are in the category of FTS
to the RCs, but are not part of the Selected Reserve. This category is exclusive of dual-status
MTs and NDSTs.
E5.1.1.1.2. Full-Time Members (Special Category). Trained Selected Reserve
members who are performing AD or FTNGD for more than 180 days in a fiscal year, but who
are exempted from counting against the AD strengths pursuant to section 101(d)(6)(B)(ii) and
(iii) of (Reference (g)). Specifically, this includes U.S. Property and Fiscal Officers and
members performing duty for the purpose of interdiction and counterdrug activities. These
personnel shall have the RCC and TRC of "SV."
E5.1.1.1.3. Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs). Individual members of the
Selected Reserve assigned to an RC billet in an AC or non-DoD organization. They are trained

individuals pre-assigned to an AC or a Selected Service System (SSS) billet that must be filled to
support mobilization (pre- and/or post-mobilization) requirements, contingency operations,
operations other than war, or other specialized or technical requirements. IMAs participate in
training activities on a part-time basis with an AC unit or SSS preparing for active service, as
required. The amount of training required may vary from 0 to 48 IDT periods per year. All
IMAs must perform a minimum of 12 days of AT each year. They have the RCC and TRC
designator of "TB."
E5.1.1.1.4. Training Pipeline. An RCC designation "U" that identifies Selected
Reserve enlisted members who have not yet completed IADT as provided in section 671 of
Reference (g) and officers who are in training for professional categories or in undergraduate
flying training. Pursuant to section 671 of Reference (g), all Ready Reservists shall receive
training commensurate with their intended wartime assignments, and must complete the basic
training requirements of the member's Service before assignment on land outside the United
States, its territories or possessions. The training pipeline is synonymous with the term "nondeployable account." Personnel in the training pipeline may be mobilized, but may not always
be available for deployment with their units. If otherwise eligible for mobilization and
deployment, they shall be considered as mobilization assets. Training pipeline personnel are
accounted for separately in the following training categories:
E5.1.1.1.4.1. Members Currently on IADT. Includes the second part of split
IADT for enlisted members, which has the RCC and TRC designator of "UF."
E5.1.1.1.4.2. Enlisted Members Awaiting Second Part of Split IADT. Those
members shall have the RCC and TRC designator of "UQ."
E5.1.1.1.4.3. Members Awaiting IADT Authorized to Perform IDT. Those
members in the Selected Reserve serving with pay. Service performed by members while in that
status is creditable toward computation of basic pay. Members in this category shall have the
RCC TRC designator of "UP." This category also includes National Guard members awaiting
IADT and not authorized to perform IDT. See paragraph 6.6.4.1.4. for specific criteria regarding
this category.
E5.1.1.1.4.4. Other Selected Reserve Untrained Personnel in Training Programs.
Includes chaplain candidates, health profession students, and early commissioning program
participants with the RCC and TRC designator of "UX."
E5.1.1.1.4.5. AGR Enlisted Members Currently on, or Awaiting, IADT. Includes
NPS AGR personnel and has the RCC and TRC designator of "US."
E5.1.1.1.4.6. Individuals in a Simultaneous Membership Program. Senior

E5.1.1.1.5. AGR not in Selected Reserve Units. National Guard or Reserve members
of the Selected Reserve, serving on AGR duty (to include full-time National Guard duty) as
defined in Chapter 1 of Reference (g), and Coast Guard Reserve AGRs, but who are not assigned
or attached to Selected Reserve units. They occupy positions in organizations, other than
Selected Reserve units, for the purposes of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or
training the RCs, and may also perform other duties as prescribed in section 12310 of Reference
(g). They shall have the same RCC and TRC designator as AGRs in units - "SG."
E5.1.1.1.6. Civil Service Employees (CIV) not in Selected Reserve Units. CIVs are
not accounted for in RCC/TRC categories. Such personnel hired under section 3101 of
Reference (u) to provide administrative support to the RCs. They are in the category of FTS to
the RCs, but are not part of the Selected Reserve.
E5.1.1.2. IRR The IRR consists of Reservists in the following categories:
E5.1.1.2.1. IRR is a manpower pool comprised principally of individuals who have
had training, have previously served in the AC or in the Selected Reserve, and have some period
of their military service obligation (MSO) or other contractual obligation remaining. Some
individuals volunteer to remain in the IRR beyond their MSO or contractual obligation and
participate in programs providing a variety of professional assignments and opportunities for
earning retirement points and military benefits. Members may voluntarily participate in training
for retirement points and promotion, with or without pay. IRR members are not required to meet
the same AT and IDT training requirements as Selected Reserve members. Exceptions to this
training requirement restriction shall be approved by the USD(P&R). Required training
(involuntary) may not exceed 30 days a year pursuant to section 10147 of Reference (g). IRR
members may be required to perform MD as described in paragraph 6.6.4.2.1. of the main body
of this Instruction. Trained members of the IRR have the RCC and TRC designator of "RE,"
with the exception of those members in the category described in paragraph E5.1.1.2.2.
E5.1.1.2.2. Within the IRR there is a category of members, as designated by the
Secretary concerned, who have volunteered to be called to AD pursuant to the provisions of
section 12304 of Reference (g) when needed. This category of the IRR is provided for in section
10144(b) of Reference (g). Members in this mobilization category shall be eligible for benefits
(other than pay and training) as normally available to members of the Selected Reserve, as
determined by the Secretary of Defense. IRR members in this category have the RCC and TRC
designator of "RM."
E5.1.1.2.3. The IRR also includes some personnel participating in officer training
programs or in the Armed Forces Health Professional Scholarship Program (AFHPSP). The
RCC and TRC designator "PJ" is used for officers not in the Selected Reserve but participating
in officer training programs. Included within this category are cadets of the Merchant Marine
Academy. The RCC and TRC designator "PK" is used for officers not in the Selected Reserve,
but participating in the AFHPSP. Members in that stipend program are required to perform 45
days of AD for training a year pursuant to section 2121(c) of Reference (g).

E5.1.1.2.4. The IRR also includes enlisted members awaiting IADT (except for
members of the National Guard), who are not authorized to perform IDT. These members are
assigned to units and are serving without pay. Service performed by members in that status is
not creditable toward computation of basic pay and shall have the RCC and TRC designator of
"RU." NPS enlistees between the ages of 18 1/2 and 26 years enlisting pursuant to section 12103
of Reference (g) shall commence IADT, insofar as practicable, within 270 days after the date of
that enlistment. All other enlisted members shall perform IADT, insofar as practicable, within
360 days of their enlistment.
E5.1.1.2.5. The IRR also includes members of the Delayed Entry Program enlisted
pursuant to section 513 of Reference (g). Currently, there is no requirement to account for those
untrained members of the IRR in the RCCPDS. However, these IRR members may be coded
with the RCC and TRC designator of "RH."
E5.1.1.3. ING. The ING consists of National Guard personnel in an inactive status in the
Ready Reserve, not in the Selected Reserve, attached to a specific National Guard unit. To
remain ING members, members must muster once a year with their assigned unit, but they do not
participate in training activities. On mobilization, ING members may mobilize with their units.
Similar to IRR members, some ING members have legal and contractual obligations. ING
members may not train for points or pay and are not eligible for promotion. Currently, the ING
category is used only by the ARNG and has the RCC and TRC designator of "II."
E5.1.2. Standby Reserve Categories. The Standby Reserve consists of those units or
members, or both, of the Reserve components, other than those in the Ready Reserve or Retired
Reserve, who are liable for active duty only as provided for in sections 12301 and 12306 of
Reference (g). The Standby Reserve consists of personnel who are maintaining their military
affiliation without being in the Ready Reserve, but have been designated key civilian employees,
or have a temporary hardship or disability. Those individuals are not required to perform
training and are not part of units. The Standby Reserve is a pool of trained individuals who may
be mobilized as needed to fill manpower needs in specific skills. The Standby Reserve consists
of the active status list and the inactive status list categories.
E5.1.2.1. Active Status List. The following members of the Standby Reserve are in an
active status:
E5.1.2.1.1. Members designated as key employees pursuant to Reference (q) and
transferred from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve Active Status List for the period they
remain designated as a key employee. Key employees may participate voluntarily without pay in
RC training for retirement points only and may be considered for promotion. This voluntary
training shall not be performed in an imminent danger area. While there is no statutory
prohibition against paying active status Standby Reservists for IDT or AD, members of the
Standby Reserve who have been screened out of the Ready Reserve as key employees shall not
be paid for training. They have the RCC and TRC designator of "YC."

promotion. They have the RCC and TRC designator of "YD."
E5.1.2.2. Inactive Status List. Members in the Standby Reserve who are not required to
remain in an active program, but who retain Reserve affiliation in a non-participating status and
whose skill may be of future use to the Armed Force concerned. These members cannot
participate in prescribed training. While in an inactive status, Reserve members are not eligible
for pay or promotion and do not accrue credit for years of service pursuant to provisions of
Chapter 1223 of Reference (g).
E5.1.2.2.1. Members transferred to the Standby Reserve Inactive Status List pursuant
to section 1209 of Reference (g) instead of separating. They have the RCC TRC designator of

voluntarily may train, with or without pay. The Retired Reserve consists of the following retired
categories:
E5.1.3.1.1. Reserve members who have completed the requisite qualifying years
creditable for non-regular retired pay pursuant to Chapter 1223 of Reference (g), and who have
reached the designated retirement age and are receiving retired pay. Those members shall be

MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN APPROVED PROGRAMS
OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

E7.1. SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM (SSS)
E7.1.1. The SSS administers the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) (Reference (o)).
The MSSA authorizes the Director of Selective Service, by delegation from the President, "...to
order to active duty with their consent and to assign to the Selective Service System such officers
of the selective-service section of the state headquarters and headquarters detachments and such
other officers of the federally recognized National Guard of the United States or other armed
forces personnel (including personnel of the reserve components thereof), as may be necessary
for the administration of the national and of the several state headquarters of the Selective
Service System."
E7.1.2. The Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of Selective Service shall
agree on the number of RC members assigned as IMAs to the SSS. The SSS shall reimburse the
Department of Defense for total personnel costs for IDT and AT for those members.
E7.1.3. Additionally, agreements between the Department of Defense and the Office of the
Director of Selective Service may provide for the use of IRR members of the RCs in an IDT or
AD status; with or without pay. The SSS shall reimburse the Department of Defense for all
associated costs, including IDT and AT pay, for those members.
E7.1.4. Request for assignment to the SSS in a full-time AD status must be approved
pursuant to DoD Directive 1000.17 (Reference (v)). Costs for those members shall be
reimbursed to the Department of Defense. Members shall not be assigned to a RCC or TRC,
shall not be counted against RC strengths, and shall not be included in the RCCPDS files.

E7.2. NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS
E7.2.1. The National Emergency Preparedness Program (all hazards) is an integral part of
U.S. national security. Support of emergency preparedness may be provided through RC
members participating with Federal, State, and local civil agencies only when clearly furthering
specifically identifiable DoD interests. Participation shall be in an IDT, ADT, or FTNGD
status. The primary basis for RC participation is to meet DoD program requirements and
therefore costs of the program are paid by the DoD Component, except when the RC members
are supporting a presidentially declared emergency or disaster. In those cases, costs are usually
on a reimbursable basis from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Subject to
priorities and guidance in DoD 3025.1 (Reference (w)), military support of those activities is a
proper mission for DoD Components. Military planning and liaison may be provided by RC

members at selected civil government and military headquarters, and includes such tasks and
responsibilities as military support to civil authorities for CONUS defense, coordinating DoD
response to domestic emergencies, and physical security of key assets.
E7.2.2. Assigning Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers (EPLOs) in a full-time AD
(other than for training) or FTNGD status in support of Emergency Preparedness Programs
outside the Department of Defense must be approved pursuant to Reference (v). The following
programs are approved for such participation:
E7.2.2.1. Federal EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between DoD Components and Federal Agencies, including interface with the
civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the Military Service planning agent.
Federal EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions. All costs are paid by the DoD
Component. Each Military Department is authorized to assign one or more Federal EPLOs
(below flag or general officer rank) at FEMA national headquarters, at the DoD Director of
Military Support, and at military headquarters that serve as the DoD, Military Service, or
Regional Planning Agents for domestic emergency support. Federal EPLOs:
E7.2.2.1.1. Provide DoD and Service liaison with Federal Agencies and
organizations, and between the Military Services.
E7.2.2.1.2. Facilitate planning, coordination, and training for military support to civil
authorities and national security emergency preparedness.
E7.2.2.1.3. Advise Federal Agencies and organizations on DoD and Service
capabilities and resources.
E7.2.2.1.4. Advocate mutual support required by the Department of Defense.
E7.2.2.1.5. On order, augment DoD response to domestic emergency operations.
E7.2.2.2. Regional EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison
responsibilities between DoD Components and Federal regional headquarters, including interface
with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the Military Service planning
agent. Regional EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions. All costs are paid by the
DoD Component. Each Military Department is authorized to assign one or more EPLOs (below
flag or general officer rank) at each FEMA region and at military headquarters and locations
with key functions as Department of Defense, Military Service, and Regional Planning Agents
for domestic emergency support. Regional EPLOs perform the same functions described in
paragraphs E7.2.2.1.1. through E7.2.2.1.5. only at the regional level.
E7.2.2.3. State EPLOs. Reserve officers performing planning and liaison responsibilities
between their DoD Components and State or U.S. Territory emergency service headquarters
including interface with the civil sector, as directed by their DoD Component through the
Military Service planning agent. State EPLOs function primarily in support of DoD missions.

All costs are paid by the DoD Component. Each Military Department is authorized to assign one
or more EPLOs (below flag or general officer rank) at each State or U.S. territorial headquarters
and shall assign such officers to functions supervised by the State Area Command. State EPLOs
provide Service representation and liaison to the military and civil authorities within the State,
commonwealth, U.S. possession, and other eligible jurisdiction. State EPLOs perform the same
functions described in paragraphs E7.2.2.1.1. through E7.2.2.1.5. only at the State level.
E7.2.3. All EPLOs should attend the DoD Emergency Preparedness Course presented at the
FEMA Mount Weather Emergency Assistance Center as soon as possible after assignment. This
will help to ensure that DoD representatives performing these vital functions are properly trained
in this complex environment.

E7.3. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE
Members of the IRR may participate voluntarily in programs outside the Department of Defense
in an AD or IDT status, with pay or without pay. Any pay provided shall be reimbursed to the
Department of Defense by the supported Agency. Members of the Standby Reserve on the
Active Status List may voluntarily participate, without pay, in approved civil defense activities
and receive retirement points pursuant to Reference (k).
E7.4. IRR MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN DEFENSE SUPPORT TO CIVIL
AUTHORITIES
IRR members participating in Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) training activities
may request ADT to attend DSCA courses. If so ordered, those Reservists shall be entitled to
pay and allowances including travel allowances for such training.

(herein referred to as "DoD Components"), including the nonappropriated fund
instrumentalities of any such Component. The term "Armed Forces," as used herein,
refers to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.
3. DEFINITIONS
3.1. Retired Member of the Armed Forces. A member or former member of the
Armed Forces who is entitled to retired, retirement, or retainer pay.
3.2. Position. A civilian office or position (including a temporary, part-time, or
intermittent position as these terms are defined by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM)) to be filled, with or without compensation, under appointment or
personal service contract from appropriated or nonappropriated funds, provided an
employer-employee relationship exists.
3.3. Category A Positions. All wage system positions paid from appropriated
funds; all general schedule (GS) positions, GS-7 and below, paid from appropriated
funds; and GS positions, GS-8 and above, paid from appropriated funds for which
payment of travel expenses to first duty station has been authorized.
3.4. Category B Positions. All positions paid from appropriated funds not covered
in category A, above.
3.5. Attached Operating Agency. The field operating agency responsible for
performing civilian personnel operational functions in support of a major DoD
Component headquarters, such as the Department of the Army's Civilian Personnel
Center.
4. POLICY AND PROCEDURES
4.1. Delegation of Authority. The authority to approve the appointment of a
retired member of the Armed Forces to a position in the Federal service, in or under the
Department of Defense, during the 180 days after retirement is delegated to the Heads
of DoD Components. This includes appointments that, before the issuance of FPM
Bulletin No. 300-49 (reference (c)), required the prior approval of the OPM. This
authority may be redelegated as follows:
4.1.1. For category A positions, at least one level above the appointing
authority.

Document 3-15

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 3 of 9

DODD 1402.1, January 21, 1982

4.1.2. For category B positions, at a level not below the major DoD
Component headquarters (or attached operating agency).
4.1.3. For positions paid from nonappropriated funds, at a level not lower than
the appointing authority.
4.2. General Policies
4.2.1. The basic objective in filling positions in the Department of Defense is
to ensure the appointment of fully qualified employees, generally the "best qualified"
under consideration, consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3326 (reference (b)).
4.2.2. Retired members of the Armed Forces have a right to seek and to be
considered for Federal civilian employment. Such consideration shall be extended
equitably and in compliance with the merit system principle of open competition to
avoid both the practice and appearance of preferential treatment. This is essential not
only in the interests of the public and of career employees, but to protect retired
members from unwarranted allegations that they obtained their positions through
influence based upon prior military service.
4.2.3. The following principles shall be observed before employing retired
members of the Armed Forces.
4.2.3.1. Full consideration shall be given, in accordance with in-service
placement and promotion procedures (including procedures negotiated under the
Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute (Title VII of the Civil Service
Reform Act of 1978, reference (d)), to eligible and qualified DoD civilian employees.
4.2.3.2. When appointment is in the competitive civil service and
selection is from an established civil service register, retired members of the Armed
Forces shall be accorded treatment consistent with regulations issued by the OPM.
4.2.3.3. When the selection for appointment, whether in or outside the
competitive civil service, is other than from an established civil service register,
recruitment for the position shall be conducted in a way that ensures reasonable efforts
are made to obtain applicants from all possible sources to avoid any suspicion of
attempts to unduly limit competition.

Document 3-15

Filed 07/10/2007

Page 4 of 9

DODD 1402.1, January 21, 1982

4.2.3.3.1. This requires that the vacancy be well publicized; that
recruitment be conducted over a sufficient period of time to give all interested
candidates an opportunity to apply; and that qualification requirements for the position
be written in a manner that does not give an advantage to a particular person.
4.2.3.3.2. When selecting a retired member, it must be established
that the member is better qualified than any in-service candidate. This requirement
does not necessitate special recruitment efforts or delays in selections for shortage
category positions for which OPM has authorized advanced re-hiring rates.
4.2.3.3.4. Positions may not be held open pending the retirement of a
member of the Armed Forces in order to provide that person with a preferential
opportunity to apply for or be appointed to the position. Active recruitment shall be
initiated when the position becomes vacant, unless suspension of recruitment can be
fully justified for management reasons unrelated to the impending retirement of a
member of the Armed Forces.
4.2.3.3.5. If the position was last occupied by the proposed appointee
or another military incumbent, change to civilian incumbency must meet a bona fide
management need and not be to afford civilian employment to the proposed appointee.
4.3. Appointments 180 Days After Retirement
4.3.1. Appointments or transfers of retired members of the Armed Forces to
positions in any DoD Component during the 180 days immediately following retirement
may be made only when:
4.3.1.1. The appointment is to a position for which the minimum rate of
basic compensation has been increased by the OPM under the authority of 5 U.S.C.
5303 (reference (b)); or
4.3.1.2. The appointment is to a position for which:
4.3.1.2.1. Equally well-qualified personnel are not available among
the employees being considered under applicable in-service placement and promotion
procedures;
4.3.1.2.2. Employee candidates are not available among those
required to be considered in priority placement programs, or among those on applicable
DoD Component Reemployment Priority Lists, or under the OPM Displaced Employee
Program; and

4.3.1.2.3 Intensive external recruitment efforts have failed to
produce any better qualified candidates.
4.3.2. A proposed appointment of a retired member of the Armed Forces
under subparagraph 4.3.1.2., above, requires the prior approval of the official to whom
authority has been delegated under paragraph 4.1., above. Each appointment must
comply with the spirit and intent of governing legislation and this Directive. Each
appointment of a retired member during the 180-day period must be fully documented
to reflect this compliance. As a minimum, this documentation shall include the
information outlined at enclosure 1. Documentation shall be retained in the active files
for 2 years from the date of appointment action.
4.4. Documentation and Notification Requirements. Under the Dual
Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5532, reference (b)), retired or retainer pay of those
retired from the Armed Forces may be subject to reduction. Defense procedures for
administering the Act are contained in DoD 1340.12-M (reference (e)). When a
civilian office or position is filled by a retired member, the personnel action shall be
reported by the appointing office on Standard Form (SF) 50, "Notification of Personnel
Action," or equivalent form, to the Military Department finance center responsible for
administering the member's retired or retainer pay. Implementing regulations
applicable to nonappropriated fund instrumentalities shall be uniform to the maximum
extent possible.
5. RESPONSIBILITIES
The Heads of DoD Components shall ensure that the policy and guidance in this
Directive are followed.

Case No. 1: 07-mc-269 (RMU)

[Proposed] ORDER
Before the Court is plaintiffs’ Motion for an Injunction to enjoin Defendants’ practice
extending Catholic chaplains on active duty past their statutory separation age. This practice is a
denominational preference for which Defendants have not shown a compelling purpose or that it
is narrowly tailored, and accordingly it is unconstitutional. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ Motion is
GRANTED.
It is ORDERED that Defendants are hereby enjoined from continuing Catholic chaplains
past their statutory separation age for the purpose of qualifying for retired pay and are further
enjoined to immediately end their 4109 program and the retention of other Catholics over the age
of 62.
Defendants are further ORDERED to establish objective criteria for extending chaplains
past age 62, including identifying specific religious needs and other neutral, secular and nonideological criteria for said extensions; to strictly comply with DOD instructions concerning
classification of retired personnel; and to comply with the discharge statutes
So ORDERED this ____ day of ________, 2007.
