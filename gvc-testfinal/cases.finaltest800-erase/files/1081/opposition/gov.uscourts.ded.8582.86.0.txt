NATURE AND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING

Thermo Electron Corporation and Thermo Finnigan LLC (together `"Thermo") submit
this Answering Brief in opposition to the recent motion by Applera Corporation, MDS Inc., and
Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments (together "AB/Sciex"') seeking reargument of this
Court's decision to stay the entirety of this consolidated action, as opposed to just the claims on
Thermo's patent. AB/Sciex moved for a stay of merely the claims on Thermo's patent, and the
Court decided to stay the entire consolidated action pending reexamination of Thermo's patent
by the United States Patent & Trademark Office ("PTO").

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

AB/Sciex's Motion for Reargument of the Court's Decision to Stay Civil Action No. 04-
1230-GMS ("Motion") should be denied because it does not satisfy the well-established standard
for reargument. The underlying motion papers already addressed the issue that AB/Sciex seeks
to raise on reargument. Specifically, Thermo's Answering Brief discussed staying the claims
related to AB/Sciex's patent and AB/Sciex responded to that suggestion in its Reply Brief.
Accordingly, the stay of AB/Sciex's claims is not outside the adversarial issues previously raised
by the parties.

The Order staying the claims on AB/Sciex's patent was well within the Court's broad
discretion concerning case management. AB/Sciex's Motion makes only fleeting and dismissive
reference to this discretion and rests on two flawed premises. The first premise is that the Court
is somehow bound by what one or more parties request and cannot fashion its own rulings. And
the second is that, in issuing a case management order, the Court is constrained to consider only
the interests of the parties and not its own concerns for judicial economy and efficiency. As a

matter of law, neither suggestion is true.

RLFi-2974985-1
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 86 Filed 01/27/2006 Page 6 of 19

AB/Sciex's Motion also fails because it depends on the erroneous notion that this Court
was obligated separately to apply the guidelines for whether to stay an action to one-half of this
consolidated case. AB/Sciex offers no authority for this proposition and its application of the
stay standards to Civil Action 04-1230 without regard to the fact that it is part of a consolidated
action is meaningless and inconsistent with the Court's consolidation decision,

Finally, AB/Sciex's claim of prejudice from the delay as a result of a stay is belied by
AB/Sciex's own actions. AB/Sciex voluntarily waited two and a half years to file suit from the
time it first suspected Thermo of (alleged) infringement. Therefore, AB/Sciex can hardly claim
prejudice from an additional modest delay. Nor did the Court's procedural decision to stay this
consolidated action diminish AB/Sciex's substantive rights in any respect.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

On April 27, 2005, with the support of the parties, the Court consolidated Civil Action
Nos. 04-1230 and 05-110 with the expectation that the Court would conduct a single trial of
these infringement actions. (Tr. of 4/27/05 Conference at 17, 29) (attached hereto as Ex. A). On
September 16, 2005, AB/Sciex filed with the PTO a request for reexamination of the patent-in-
suit in Civil Action No. 05-110. (Thermo's Answering Br. in Opp. to AB/Sciex's Motion to
Stay, Ex. C, DL 56)! On November 4, 2005, the PTO granted AB/Sciex's request for
reexamination. (id, Ex. D). On November 18, 2005, AB/Sciex filed a motion to stay Civil
Action No. 05-110. (D.I. 42). On December 15, 2005, Thermo opposed that motion and
suggested that if AB/Sciex wanted Civil Action 05-110 stayed it should also offer to stay Civil

Action 04-1230, given the Court's prior consolidation of the two actions. (DI. 56, at 12). On

 

Record citations are to Civil Action No. 05-110.

December 22, 2005, AB/Sciex filed a reply and opposed Thermo's suggestion that Civil Action
04-1230 be stayed. (D.I. 64, at 16-17).

On December 28, 2005, the Court ordered the entirety of the consolidated action stayed
pending the outcome of the reexamination. (D.1. 65). The Court concluded that "staying both
cases best serves the interests of justice, and is the most efficient approach to the consolidated
schedule that the court has envisioned for the litigation" and noted that such a decision is "firmly
within [its] discretion." (/d. at 3). The Court instructed the parties to notify the Court when the
PTO issues its reexamination decision, (/d. at 5). On January 12, 2006, AB/Sciex filed its
Motion. (D.I. 66).

ARGUMENT

L The Stay of Civil Action 04-1230 Was Not "Outside the Adversarial Issues Raised
by the Parties".

As this Court has noted on several occasions, reargument may be granted if the court, in
its discretion, determines that the court "patently misunderstood a party, has made a decision
outside the adversarial issues presented by the parties, or has made an error of apprehension."

matter, "[mJotions for reargument should be granted only `sparingly."" Marvel, 2003 WL
21640375, at *2 (quoting Karr v. Castle, 768 F Supp. 1087, 1090 (D. Del. 1991)).

Although AB/Sciex claims in its brief not to have "reasonably . . . expect[ed]" the Court
to stay Civil Action 04-1230 (D.1., 67, at 4) ("Br."), the possibility that the Court would do so
was hardly "outside the adversarial issues presented by the parties" as AB/Sciex now contends.
(Br. at 2-4). Nor did the Court's decision deprive AB/Sciex of "a fair opportunity to address why
a stay of the 04-1230 action is inappropriate." (Br. at 2). Even leaving aside the fact that
AB/Sciex moved to stay a case that had already been consolidated with another case and given
an identical procedural schedule, Thermo expressly discussed staying this entire consolidated
action in its Answering Brief in opposition to AB/Sciex's motion to stay Civil Action 05-110:

If AB/Sciex were sincere in its assertion that a stay is not
prejudicial to the patentholder, it would offer to stay its claim on
the `736 patent until the reexamination of the `784 patent is over,
so that the parties and the Court can continue to benefit from the
efficiencies of consolidation. It has not done so, of course, because
it wants to proceed on its own claim while stopping Thermo's
claim against it. Cf imax Corp. v. In-Three, Inc., 385 F.Supp.2d
1030, 1033 n.2 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (denying stay and declining
"generous offer" by defendant to permit the court to stay only
plaintiff's infringement claim and to let defendant's counterclaims
go forward).

(Answering Br, D.1. 56 at 12).

Far from treating Thermo's discussion of staying both parties' claims as a "throwaway
assertion" as it now suggests (Br. at 4), AB/Sciex concluded its Reply Brief (D.1. 64) with an
appeal to the Court not to take the course of action that Thermo's argument suggested:

Finally, Thermo's suggestion that AB/Sciex voluntarily stay the
04-1230 action and wait for the `784 patent to remerge [sic] from
the PTO proceedings ignores the significant differences between

the two cases. The `736 patent has already been found valid after
reexamination by the PTO and a district court litigation, and is not

RLF1-2974985-]
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 86_ Filed 01/27/2006 Page 9 of 19

presently being reexamined by the PTO. The 04-1230 action is an
independent, separate, and distinct patent infringement suit brought
by AB/Sciex against Thermo for its infringement of the `736
patent. The issues raised by the ongoing proceedings at the PTO
concerning the `784 patent do not impact the 04-1230 action, let
alone raise the issue of unfair prejudice.

(Reply Br., D.L. 64 at 16-17).

The issue was thus raised and addressed by the parties in the underlying motion briefing
(as the Court recognized in its Order [D.L 65, at 3]). AB/Sciex's Motion is nothing more than an
improper attempt to "rehash," albeit at greater length, the arguments it made before. See Marvel,
2003 WL 21640375, at * 2 ("Finally, motions for reconsideration `should not be used to rehash
arguments already briefed."") (quoting T7 Group, 2002 WL 87472, at *1); see also Brambles
USA, Inc. v Blocker, 735 F.Supp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990) ("Reargument should not be
granted where it would merely `allow wasteful repetition of arguments already briefed,
considered and decided.'") (quoting Weissman v Fruchtman, 124 F.R.D. 559, 560 (S.D.N.Y.
1989)). AB/Sciex's Motion reiterates the same arguments that AB/Sciex made before: that
reexamination of the patent-in-suit in Civil Action No. 05-110, United States Patent No.
6,528,784 ("the '784 patent"), will have no impact on Civil Action 04-1230 (Reply Br. at 16-17;
Br. at 6, 7, 8, 9), and that the patent-in-suit in Civil Action 04-1230, United States Patent No.
4,963,736 ("the '736 patent"), is allegedly "independent" (D.I. 64 at 17), "unrelated" (Br. at 2),
and "different" (Br. at 6).

Moreover, there is no reason to believe the Court would have issued a different decision
had the question of staying Civil Action 04-1230 been argued at greater length in the prior
briefing. This alone is grounds for denying AB/Sciex's motion under this Court's reargument

jurisprudence. See Marvel, 2003 WL 21640375, at *2 ("Even if this court has committed one of

RLFI-2974985-|
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 86 Filed 01/27/2006 Page 10 of 19

these errors [warranting reargument], there is no need to grant a motion for reconsideration if it
would not alter the court's initial decision."); Brambles, 735 F.Supp. at 1240 ("In no event
should reargument be granted where the matters advanced for reargument would not `reasonably
have altered the result [previously] reached by the Court... . '") (quoting Crane Co. v. Harsco
Corp., 511 F.Supp. 294, 307 (D. Del. 1981)).

As demonstrated by the several decisions of this Court concerning stays of infringement
actions pending reexamination,' this Court is well familiar with all of the issues and arguments
that might be raised by motions seeking such stays. As the Court was aware, the consolidated
Civil Action Nos. 04-1230 and 05-110 were identically positioned at the time of AB/Sciex's
motion to stay. Indeed, AB/Sciex filed that motion on the same day Opening Markman briefs
were filed for both patents-in-suit. And what the parties argued in their briefs on the stay motion
regarding the status of Civil Action No. 05-110 and the work both already completed and
remaining was obvious and equally true of Civil Action No. 04-1230, In short, there is no reason
for AB/Sciex to suggest that the Court's decision was anything other than knowing and
considered. See TI Group, 2002 WL 87472, at *2 (denying reargument and noting that this
Court had "carefully considered the propriety of its ruling before issuing it. While TI may not be
pleased with the conclusion which the court reached, its displeasure is not an appropriate ground

for reargument.").
