Applera Corporation, MDS Inc., and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments
(collectively, "AB/Sciex") respectfully submit this brief in support of their motion
pursuant to Local Rule 7.1.5 seeking reargument of the Court's recent Order to stay Civil
Action No. 04-1230-GMS. D.I. 65 (the "Order").'

NATURE AND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

On September 7, 2004, AB/Sciex filed Civil Action No. 04-1230-GMS (the "04-
1230 action") against Thermo Electron Corporation ("Thermo Electron") alleging
infringement of AB/Sciex's U.S. Patent No. 4,963,736 (the "736 patent"). On February
23, 2005, Thermo Finnigan LLC (together with Thermo Electron, "Thermo"), a
subsidiary of Thermo Electron, filed Civil Action No. 05-110-GMS (the "05-110 action")
against AB/Sciex alleging infringement of Thermo's U.S. Patent No. 6,528,784 (the
"784 patent"). On April 27, 2005, the Court consolidated the 04-1230 action with the
05-110 action in order "to streamline the discovery process and prevent duplicative
litigation." Order at 1-2.

On November 4, 2005, the Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO") granted
AB/Sciex's request to reexamine the 784 patent in suit in the 05-110 action in light of
prior art that was not considered during the original prosecution. Shortly thereafter, on
November 18, 2005, AB/Sciex filed a motion to stay the 05-110 action pending the
outcome of the reexamination. In response to AB/Sciex's motion, Thermo did not move
for or even request a stay of the 04-1230 action. Instead, Thermo merely opposed

AB/Sciex's motion for a stay of the 05-110 action. In doing so, Thermo asserted that if

 

| AB/Sciex adopts the Court's convention of citing to case documents using the D.I.
numbers from the 05-110 action for convenience and because AB/Sciex's motion
requested a stay of the 05-110 action. See Order at 2 n.1.
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 84 _~ Filed 01/12/2006 Page 6 of 17

AB/Sciex was sincere in its assertion that Thermo would not be unduly prejudiced by a
stay of the 05-110 action, then AB/Sciex "would offer to stay its claim on the '736 patent
until the reexamination of the '784 patent is over." D.I. 56, Thermo Ans. Br. at 12.

Even though Thermo never moved for or even requested a stay of the 04-1230
action, and even though neither party was provided with a fair opportunity to address
whether a stay of the 04-1230 action was appropriate, the Court unexpectedly appears to
have treated Thermo's argument regarding AB/Sciex's alleged lack of sincerity as a
request that the Court also stay the 04-1230 action in addition to the 05-110 action
pending the reexamination of the *784 patent." Order at 3-4.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Reargument is warranted because the Court's decision to stay the 04-1230 action
was outside the scope of the issues presented by AB/Sciex's motion to stay the 05-110
action. Thermo did not move for or even request a stay of the 04-1230 action in response
to AB/Sciex's motion to stay the 05-110 action. Accordingly, AB/Sciex was not
provided with a fair opportunity to address why a stay of the 04-1230 action is
inappropriate.

The stay of the 04-1230 action pending the reexamination of the '784 patent is

inappropriate because the reexamination is completely unrelated to the 04-1230 action.

 

2 Thermo filed another action, Civil Action No. 04-1505-GMS (the "04-1505 action"), in
this Court for patent infringement against Applera on December 8, 2004, prior to
Thermo's 05-110 action but after AB/Sciex's 04-1230 action. In that action, Thermo
asserts a patent that it decided to let expire in 2003 (by not paying a maintenance fee)
against Applera devices that were introduced more than six years before Thermo filed
suit. The 04-1505 action has all the earmarks of a mere tactical response to AB/Sciex's
04-1230 action. The 04-1505 action was not consolidated with the other two actions and
has not been stayed. Thus, in the larger context of the entire dispute between the parties,
the Court's decision to stay the 04-1230 action has given Thermo an unfair tactical
advantage.
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 84 _ Filed 01/12/2006 Page 7 of 17

The stay of the 04-1230 action will unduly prejudice AB/Sciex by delaying that action for
no reason other than that the action was consolidated with the 05-110 action at a time
prior to the PTO's decision to reexamine the '784 patent. Moreover, a stay will not
simplify any issues in the 04-1230 case because the outcome of the reexamination of the
0x00B0784 patent will have no bearing whatsoever on any of the issues in the 04-1230 action.
The 04-1230 action is ready to go forward and should not be delayed simply because the
PTO's decision to reexamine the '784 patent has undermined the basis for the 05-110
action.

~ ARGUMENT
I. Reargument Is Warranted Because the Court's Decision to Stay the 04-1230

Action Was Outside the Scope of the Issues Presented by AB/Sciex's Motion
to Stay the 05-110 Action

Reargument is warranted where the Court renders a decision that is "outside the
adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties." Brambles USA, Inc. v. Blocker,
735 F. Supp. 1239, 1241 (D. Del. 1990); see also Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors
of Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., Inc. v. Fleet Retail Fin. Group (In re Hechinger Inv. Co.
of Del., Inc.), 303 B.R. 18, 23 (D. Del. 2003); Pirelli Cable Corp. v. Ciena Corp., 988 F.
Supp. 424, 446 (D. Del. 1998).

The standard for reargument is met here. The issue of whether to stay the 04-
1230 action pending the reexamination of the 784 patent was outside the scope of the
issues presented by AB/Sciex's motion to stay the 05-1 10 action. Thermo never moved
for or even requested a stay of the 04-1230 action. It simply argued that the 05-1 10
action should not be stayed. In doing so, Thermo asserted that if AB/Sciex was sincere
that a stay of the 05-110 action would not unduly prejudice Thermo, AB/Sciex "would

offer to stay its claim on the 736 patent until the reexamination of the '784 patent is

3
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 84 _ Filed 01/12/2006 Page 8 of 17

over." D.I. 56, Thermo Ans. Br. at 12. This was not a request by Thermo to stay the 04-
1230 action and AB/Sciex reasonably did not expect that the Court would treat it as such
arequest. Indeed, Thermo did not make any attempt to explain why a stay of the 04-
1230 action was appropriate under the factors that govern the exercise of the Court's
discretion.

Thermo's throwaway assertion about AB/Sciex's alleged lack of sincerity did not
provide AB/Sciex with sufficient notice that whether to grant a stay of the 04-1230 action
was at issue. Had Thermo intended to seek a stay of the 04-1230 action, it should have
moved for that relief in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to provide
AB/Sciex with notice and a fair opportunity to respond and explain to the Court why such
a stay is inappropriate. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1) ("An application to the court for an
order shall be by motion which . . . shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity
the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought."); Honeywell Int'l Inc.
y. Audiovox Communications Corp., Nos. 04-1337-KAJ, 04-1338-KAJ, 04-1536-KAJ,
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22933, at *4 (D. Del. May 18, 2005) (attached as Ex. A) (noting
that a party's request for an order in a letter to the Court should have been made in a
motion because that is "the custom and expectation" of this Court under Fed. R. Civ. P.
7(b)(1)).

IL. The Factors that Govern Whether to Stay the 04-1230 Action
Overwhelmingly Weigh Against a Stay

As the Court recognized in its Order, the exercise of its discretion regarding
whether or not to stay an action must be guided by the following factors: (1) whether a
stay would unduly prejudice or present a clear tactical disadvantage to the non-moving

party; (2) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and trial of the case; and (3)
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 84 _ Filed 01/12/2006 Page 9 of 17

whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set. Argos v. Orthotec
LLC, 304 F. Supp. 2d 591, 598 (D. Del. 2004) (citing Xerox Corp. v. 3Com Corp., 69 F.
Supp. 2d 404, 406 (W.D.N.Y. 1999)); ef United Sweetener USA, Inc. v. Nutrasweet Co.,
766 F. Supp. 212, 217 (D. Del. 1991); Order at 3-4.

Although the Court's decision to stay both cases was discretionary, AB/Sciex
respectfully submits that the Court erroneously failed to separately consider how the
factors that govern the exercise of that discretion apply to the 04-1230 action involving
the '736 patent as distinct from the 05-110 action involving the 0x00B0784 patent that is being
reexamined. See, e.g., United Sweetener, 766 F. Supp. at 213 (addressing motion to stay
regarding counts in complaint for a patent-in-suit that was being reexamined and deciding
only to stay proceedings on that patent); Teradyne, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. C-
91-0344 MHP, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14601, at *22-*29 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 7, 1993)
(attached as Ex. B) (staying patent action only as to the two patents-in-suit being
reexamined but not as to the additional patent-in-suit not being reexamined). As
explained below, when the factors that govern the exercise of the Court's discretion
regarding a stay are separately considered with respect to the 04-1230 action, they
overwhelmingly weigh against a stay of that action.

A. A Stay of the 04-1230 Action Will Unduly Prejudice AB/Sciex By
Delaying its Claim for Infringement of the '736 Patent for No Reason

First, a stay of the 04-1230 action is inappropriate because a stay will unduly
prejudice AB/Sciex by delaying its action against Thermo for infringement of the '736
patent for no reason. The 04-1230 action has been stayed not because of any defect with
that action but instead because of a defect with Thermo's 05-110 action. AB/Sciex is

entitled to have its 04-1230 action proceed now without regard to Thermo's problems in
Case 1:04-cv-01230-GMS Document 84 Filed 01/12/2006 Page 10 of 17

the PTO with its patent. There simply is no reason to delay the 04-1230 action while the
reexamination of the '784 patent takes place. The '784 patent has nothing whatsoever to
do with the 04-1230 action and the outcome of the reexamination will have absolutely no
impact on that action. AB/Sciex's case against Thermo on the '736 patent is ready to go

forward and there is no reason to delay.

The Court's decision to stay the 04-1230 action pending the reexamination of an
unrelated patent in suit in a different action appears to be unprecedented. AB/Sciex has
not been able to find a single decision in which a court stayed a patent infringement
action pending the reexamination of an unrelated patent-in-suit in a different patent
action. This is not surprising, since there simply is no reason to stay litigation with
respect to one patent pending the reexamination of a different patent unless there is some
countervailing benefit to be gained by awaiting the outcome of the reexamination.
Absent such a benefit, the prejudice to the plaintiff resulting from the delay caused by the
stay is unnecessary and undue.

For example, in Agar Corp. Inc. v. Multi-Fluid, Inc., 983 F. Supp. 1126 (S.D.
Tex. 1997), the Court declined to stay the litigation where only one of several patents-in-
suit was being reexamined, because the Court "ha[d] a definite concern about the delay
that may result from a stay" given that the reexamination "likely w[ould] not produce
results that would affect the remaining patent infringement claims." Jd at 1127-28. In
coming to this conclusion, the Court noted "[i]fa stay would more likely than not delay
the district court proceedings without any countervailing benefit, the court should
proceed with the merits of the case without the benefit of the Patent Office

reexamination." Id. (citation omitted).
