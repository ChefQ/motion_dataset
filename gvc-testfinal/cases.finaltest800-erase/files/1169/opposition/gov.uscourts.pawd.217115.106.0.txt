RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR REVOKATION OF DETENTION ORDER
AND NOW, comes the United States of America, by and through
David J. Hickton, United States Attorney for the Western
District of Pennsylvania, and Eric S. Rosen and Conor Lamb,
Assistant United States Attorneys for said district, and
respectfully files this response to Defendant’s appeal of Chief
Magistrate Judge Kelly’s order of detention pending trial.
A.

INTRODUCTION
1.

Prior to his November 20, 2014 detention hearing,

Defendant filed a motion for release on bond (Doc. No. 50), to
which the Government responded (Doc. 60).

The Government relies

on that brief, as it did below, to explicate fully matters
pertaining to the weight of the evidence against Defendant.

On

November 18, 2014, Defendant filed a reply to the Government’s
response (Doc. No. 75).
2.

At the commencement of the hearing, pretrial services

produced a report that recommended to the Magistrate Judge that
Defendant be detained pending trial, as he posed a serious risk
1

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 2 of 27

of flight.

That recommendation occurred after defendant

reported to pretrial services that he had $10 million in
personal assets.
3.
hearing.

The parties then engaged in a lengthy detention
In addition to proffering the Government’s brief, the

Government presented the testimony of INS Agent Robert Greiser
and Special Agent Neal Bandzak of the Internal Revenue Service.
4.

No decision was made at that hearing; instead, the

court held its decision in abeyance pending the submission of
proposed surety by Defendant.

The next day, Defendant sent a

letter to the Court in which he proposed four properties as
surety – three in Florida and one in California.

None of the

proposed properties were owned by him; in fact, the properties
are owned by Javed Sunesra, a fugitive co-defendant.
5.

The hearing reconvened on November 24, 2014, and prior

to the Court issuing its decision, pretrial services again
recommended that Defendant be detained.

(Tr. 11/24 at 7).

The

Magistrate Judge then carefully and analytically parsed the
issues, and ruled that the Government had proven, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that Defendant was a serious risk
of flight.
6.

Contrary to what Defendant now argues on appeal, the

Magistrate Judge found the evidence in this case to be
2

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 3 of 27

“significant,” and “obviously the result of a long-term very
diligent investigation.”
9.)

(Tr. 11/20/14 at 123; Tr. 11/24/14 at

Any uncertainty expressed by the Magistrate Judge related

to legal issues.

(Id.) Although the Government does not,

respectfully, agree with all of Chief Judge Kelly’s factual
conclusions, the Government wholeheartedly agrees with her
reasoned decision that Defendant presents a “very, very
significant risk of flight” (Tr. 11/24/12 at 12), and therefore,
must be detained pending trial.

See United States v. Himler,

797 F.2d 156, 161 (3d Cir. 1986) (risk of flight must be proved
by preponderance of the evidence, which requires fact finder to
believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its
nonexistence).
B.

Defendant presents a serious risk of flight.
I.

Defendant has no ties to the United States, and no
incentive to remain in this country pending trial.
7.

Defendant gave his first indication that he would not

submit to U.S. jurisdiction in a Skype “chat” he engaged in
prior to his arrest.

During this Skype chat, which occurred on

July 20, 2014, and which was recovered from Defendant’s phone
after his arrest, Defendant “chats” with a relative of Taimur
Khan.

Given that Khan had not been communicating with his

family, Defendant was worried that Khan had been arrested upon

3

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 4 of 27

his entrance into the United States, was being held by
authorities, and that he was cooperating with the Government:
Defendant: Any news? [as to what happened with Taimur Khan]
Asmat Khan: nope …
Defendant: when u call his mobile, its off or no. And what
did he say when u spoke to him
Asmat Khan: his girlfriend just told me she has spoken to
him and he is fine
Defendant: ok good. Did she say what happen
Asmat Khan: she was just worried about him
Defendant: Why they stopped him?
Asmat Khan: I will give u details in India.
Defendant: Ok is to do with pharma? I have work in Miami
and will be traveling there that is why I ask?
8.

Thus, even prior to his arrest, Defendant was aware

that he could be targeted by U.S. law enforcement for “pharma,”
and more importantly, he makes clear that if this was the case,
and had he known about the investigation, he would abort any
trip to Miami.
later.

Defendant was arrested in Miami just a few weeks

This conversation, amongst others, makes clear that

Defendant would, if given the opportunity, flee the United
States rather than remain to face the charges against him.
9.

Indeed, should Defendant be released, the Court need

only look to the actions of Defendant’s co-defendants – his
brother and mother.

Both Javed Sunesra (a United States

citizen) and Bismilla Sunesra are fugitives.

They have chosen

to remain in India and not face the charges against them.

4

The

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 5 of 27

Government has, multiple times, offered these co-defendants safe
passage (meaning that they would not be arrested at the border),
as well as the opportunity to stay at the hotel of their
choosing in Pittsburgh for the trial.

These co-defendants have

rejected the Government’s pleas, and there is little reason to
believe Defendant here would behave differently.
10.

Fear of flight is compounded by the fact that

Defendant, unlike his fugitive brother Javed, has absolutely no
ties to the United States, let alone the W.D.P.A.

Defendant

owns no property in the United States; he has no job that
tethers him to the United States; he is not a United States
citizen or resident; Defendant has not lived in the United
States for years; and, as explained in more detail below,
Defendant repeatedly and knowingly flaunted the laws of the
United States, even after being told by U.S. law enforcement
that his pharma “business” violated the law.

See United States

v. Epstein, 155 F. Supp. 2d 323 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (detaining
businessman who resided in Brazil and was charged with fraud;
court ruled that “most significant is [the defendant’s] lack of
ties to the United States”).
11.

The Government is hard-pressed to think of a single

reason Defendant would remain in the United States given that,
at best, he could return to India and wait out at a lengthy

5

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 6 of 27

extradition process, while at worst, he would simply be returned
to NEOCC in Ohio to await his trial.

Although Defendant fancies

himself an international businessman who must “travel
extensively for work,” the Government has reviewed Defendant’s
emails, and it is fairly clear that Defendant’s primary
“business” was international drug smuggling, and that his other
offshoot businesses that did have airs of legitimacy were
largely used as vehicles for investing his illegally earned
cash.

Further, if convicted in this case, it will be difficult

for Defendant to obtain visas for many of the countries to which
he used to travel.

Thus, it will not be Defendant’s “fugitive

status” that would crimp his travel, but rather the fact that he
will have on his record multiple felony convictions for drug
trafficking, smuggling, fraud and money laundering.
II.
12.

The Government’s case against Defendant is strong, and
Defendant faces a lengthy sentence if found guilty.
Although Magistrate Judge Kelly did state that there

was “significant evidence” against Defendant (Tr. 11/20/14 at
123; Tr. 11/24/14 at 9), the Magistrate Judge found “weight of
the evidence” to be a “neutral factor” due to her appraisal of
the legal, rather than factual, issues (Tr. 11/24/14 at 9).” 1

1
Defendant claims in his brief that Judge Kelly found that the Government
“will face serious impediments to obtaining an actual conviction of
Defendant” and that Judge Kelly “noted” that the “weight of the evidence is
weak.” Judge Kelly made no such determination, and in fact concluded that
this case is “obviously the result of a long-term very diligent
investigation.” (Tr. 11/20/2014 at 123.)

6

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 7 of 27

The Government believes, as set forth in its lengthy opening
brief that attached dozens of exhibits showing Defendant’s
intentional and deliberate criminal conduct, that this factor,
contrary to the Magistrate Court’s conclusion, strongly weighs
in favor of the Government, and is not “neutral.”
13.

Buttressing the Government’s position is the fact that

Taimur Khan, a co-defendant, has already pled guilty to the
felony charges against him, and Defendant’s co-defendants are
refusing to appear in Court, presumably because conviction is
likely.

Defendant himself even acknowledged in the Skype chat

mentioned above that he could be targeted due to his involvement
with “pharma.”
14.

The Government is not going to rehash the entirety of

its case against Defendant.

However, it is important to make

clear that in evaluating Defendant’s likelihood of obeying this
Court’s orders should he be released on bond, the Government has
significant evidence that Defendant was repeatedly told that his
business violated U.S. law, and yet he continued to operate his
illegal business, which provided him and his family with
millions of dollars in revenues.
15.

In addition to the dozens of examples listed in the

Government’s opening brief, on August 18, 2009, Defendant was
informed by PharmacyChecker, a third-party online pharmacy
7

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 8 of 27

validation company, that his membership in the program was being
terminated because his website sold prescription drugs to
customers without requiring a prescription, in clear violation
of U.S. law.

See Govt. Ex. A.

In response, Defendant lied to

PharmacyChecker, falsely claiming that “[w]e keep a digital copy
of the prescription for every order for reference.”

As set

forth in the indictment, law enforcement has conducted a dozen
controlled purchases, not one of which required a prescription.
Further, searches of all defendants’ email accounts clearly
indicate that a prescription was not required.
16.

PharmacyChecker then sent Defendant a report written

by LegitScript, also a third-party validator.

This report, at

pages 6 and 7, catalogued a number of legal requirements that
Defendant’s websites failed to meet, amongst them: the
requirement that a pharmacy could sell prescription drugs only
to a patient who has seen a prescribing doctor in person, and
also, that an online pharmacy could only sell drugs that were
FDA-approved, meaning that the drugs needed to come “directly
from a licensed pharmacy in the United States, not one that is
located outside of the United States, even if it has a foreign
pharmacy license.”

Defendant, of course, shipped drugs from an

Indian pharmacy into the United States.

8

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 9 of 27

17.

Most critically, the report went on, at pages 15 and

16, to examine Defendant’s own series of websites, identifying
these websites as “rogue pharmacies” that sold drugs without
prescriptions.

The report concluded that: “It is beyond dispute

that shopeastwest.com is an illegal rogue pharmacy that does not
require a prescription for the sale of prescription drugs,”
which are then imported into the U.S. in violation of the law.
18.

In yet another example of Defendant’s brazen law-

breaking, an American customer of NobleDrugStore (“NDS”), a
website run by Defendant, sent an email to “Paul,” a pharmacy
employee, complaining that his drugs had been seized by U.S.
Customs, and that the FDA had sent him letters informing him
that the shipment of these drugs into the United States was
illegal.

See Govt. Ex. B.

The customer attached the FDA

letters to his email, and this email, including the attachments,
was forwarded to Defendant and later found on his computer.

The

FDA letters stated that the prescription medicine mailed to the
United States was being refused entry into the United States
because it violated the “Food Drug and Cosmetic Act,” in that it
was “misbrand[ed]” and “unapproved.”

In response to these

letters that came directly from the U.S. Government, rather than
heeding law enforcement, Defendant offered to reship the
products to the United States.

9

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 10 of 27

19.

As a final example, on April 21, 2013, Katie Dodson,

another NDS customer, wrote to NDS stating that her shipment of
“domperidone” had been seized by customs because it was “not fda
approved.”

The customer warned that she needed this medication

to “keep my milk supply up or my daughter will end up back in
the neonatal intensive care unit.”

Domperidone, a drug used to

treat gastric illness, is a drug banned in the United States
because it can result in sudden death.

This email, like the

others, was found in Defendant’s computer, and once again,
Defendant instructed his employee to “reship the parcel which
was detained by customs,” thereby demonstrating his willful
intent to repeatedly violate the laws of the United States as
told to him by customers, third-party validators, and the FDA.
20.

Defendant’s knowledge of his illegal activities is

important, given that he has been charged with multiple counts
of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle.

The money laundering

charge against Defendant also employs smuggling as an underlying
specified unlawful activity (SUA).

The key legal element for

sustaining a smuggling charge is the defendant’s knowledge that
the importation of the merchandise into the United States
violated the law.

As demonstrated above, this element is easily

met by the Government.

10

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 11 of 27

21.

Unfortunately for Defendant, this criminal activity,

which occurred on an industrial level that produced hundreds of
thousands of dollars in revenue each month for the Sunesra
family, results in a very high Guidelines sentencing range for
both the smuggling counts and the money laundering count, each
of which carries a 20-year maximum sentence.

As an example, for

the money laundering alone - using a very conservative figure of
$2.5 million for the amount of money wired from the United
States into the foreign bank accounts controlled by Defendant this results in a base offense level, including enhancements for
sophisticated means and promotion of controlled substances, of
36, which translates into a sentence of 188 to 235 months.
Facing such a substantial sentence, there is no incentive for
Defendant to stay in the United States and await trial.
22.

The arguments Defendant sets forth in his appellate

brief regarding the weight of the evidence have little merit and
have largely been addressed in the Government’s opening brief.
Although Defendant maintains that to prove felony misbranding
the Government must establish “specific intent to defraud the
FDA,” this is not the law.

Rather, the law requires the

Government to prove a defendant’s “intent to defraud and
mislead” anyone – consumers, banks, payment processors, customs,
and the FDA were all candidates for Defendant’s fraud and
deception.

Consumers were misled because they were told that
11

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 12 of 27

the drugs were FDA approved, when they were not.

Banks and

payment processors were misled when they were told that
Defendant had all the proper licenses to sell drugs in the
United States, when they did not.

Entities like PharmacyChecker

were misled when Defendant lied and stated that his company kept
digital copies of all prescriptions.

And the FDA, as the

regulator tasked with safeguarding this nation’s drug supply,
was repeatedly misled by statements on the Defendant’s websites
concerning whether their company was following all applicable
laws and regulations.
23.

Defendant next asserts that the Government cannot

establish a scheme to deprive any person of property.

The

Government outlined in detail in its opening brief exactly how
Defendant’s websites defrauded consumers.

Most notably,

Defendant told consumers that all of his products were “FDAapproved,” when in fact, none of his products were FDA-approved.
Indeed, in an August 12, 2013 email found on Defendant’s own
computer, “Jerry” from EasternDrugs (another website operated
specifically by Defendant) wrote to a customer who had
complained about the quality of the drugs provided by
EasternDrugs that: “We ship FDA approved GENERIC drugs,” and
“all of our products are completely legal and approved.”
Govt Ex. D.

See

Defendant and his co-conspirators even produced

website advertisements which contained the U.S. FDA logo,
12

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 13 of 27

thereby falsely implying that their products were FDA-approved.
See Govt. Ex. E.
24.

Simply stated, Defendant’s business thrived only

because customers were duped into purchasing medicines they
thought were approved for sale in the United States.

To the

contrary, Defendant sold Indian street drugs that they purchased
for pennies on the dollar and which were then off-loaded onto
unsuspecting consumers. 2

Indeed, Defendant’s own employee

acknowledged in an email to Defendant that he was “basically
lying for [Defendant’s] company every day.”
25.

See Govt. Ex. F.

Finally, Defendant insists that the act of mailing

drugs from India to the United States is not “importation” into
the United States, but rather constitutes exporting from India,
which, according to him, cannot be regulated by the U.S.
Government. The law is to the contrary.

See, e.g., United

States v. Chen, 473 F. Supp. 1042, 1043 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (the
defendants, citizens and residents of Hong Kong, were convicted
of importing heroin into the United States after they shipped
heroin “to the United States by mail from outside the country”).
26.

Indeed, it is now well-settled that conspiracies to

import controlled substances into the United States need not
2

Even Defendant’s own exhibit introduced at the detention hearing, which
showed that Defendant was selling “generic Abilify,” demonstrated fraud as
generic Abilify does not exist and is certainly not FDA approved. (Tr.
11/21/ 2014 at 104-06).

13

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 14 of 27

even show that an overt act took place within the United States;
rather, it is sufficient if it can be proved that the acts of a
conspiracy were intended to have an impact within the United
States.

See United States v. Freeman, 660 F.2d 1030, 1034 (5th

Cir. 1981).

The seminal case of United States v. Manuel

Noriega, 76 F.Supp. 1506, 1515-16 (S.D. Fla. 1990) explains in
detail how the drug importation statute applies not only to
conduct within the United States, but also to conduct outside
the United States that is intended to effect the United States,
which is what Defendant’s conduct clearly encompassed here.
27.

Thus, the evidence against Defendant is strong, his

expected sentence is lengthy, and as a result, the risk of
flight is high.
III.

Defendant retains or has access to significant assets
that will aid his flight from the United States.
28.

Incident to his arrest, Defendant told pretrial

services that he had a net worth of approximately $10 million.
In his brief seeking release, Defendant valued his net worth at
$25,000, a sharp decline from his earlier pronouncements.
No. 75).

(Doc.

At the detention hearing, the Government, to bolster

its contention that Defendant possessed significant resources to
flee, introduced exhibits showing that Defendant recently had
nearly $500,000 in cash in just one of his bank accounts, and
further, that this money came from Defendant’s illegal pharmacy
14

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 15 of 27

network.
G.

See (Tr. 11/21/14 at 33-38; 11/24/14 at 3); Govt. Ex.

Additionally, the last financial report produced by Asian

Capital Equities, the pharmacy shell company owned by Defendant,
showed $1.47 million in cash reserves.
29.

See Govt. Ex. H.

Thus, not only does Defendant have access to

significant assets, but Defendant has been deceptive about the
availability of significant funds that could aid his flight.
See, e.g., United States v. Saani, 557 F.Supp.2d 97, 98-99
(D.D.C. 2008) (detention ordered in tax fraud case: “while this
is not a crime of violence, nor a terrorism or narcotics
offense, it is a crime of deception with direct relevance to
Defendant’s ability to support himself overseas.

Defendant’s

alleged access to funds in foreign bank accounts, and
Defendant’s alleged purposeful and illegal concealment of that
access, is directly relevant to Defendant’s flight risk”).
30.

Finally, Judge Kelly agreed with the Government

regarding Defendant’s access to monies, holding that “based on
the evidence presented to the Court, that this defendant has
significant assets, monetary assets, or has access to them to
potentially facilitate a flight to India, and I believe there is
a very, very significant risk of flight.” 3

3

See 11/24/2014 Tr. at

Although the Magistrate Court did question the validity of Defendant’s net
worth as stated in the pretrial services report, this report is compiled from
Defendant’s own statements to pretrial services. Further, the Government and
Courts routinely rely on the pretrial services report during bond hearings.

15

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 16 of 27

12; United States v. Goba, 240 F. Supp. 2d 242, 252 (W.D.N.Y.
2003) (evidence that a defendant has the “ability to maintain
themselves abroad for a considerable period of time,”
constitutes risk of flight by preponderance of the evidence).
31.

Thus, although Defendant now argues that the

Government “failed to produce evidence of the Defendant’s
personal net worth at the Detention hearing,” that is simply not
true.

In fact, the Government produced the best evidence

imaginable: Defendant’s own statement.

Defendant offered

nothing at the hearing to counter his own statement or the
Government’s other evidence.

Accordingly, as evidenced by

Defendant’s ability to post $250,000 in cash as a bond, it is
clear that Defendant has access to considerable wealth that
could help his flight from the United States.
C.

Defendant is a danger to the community and he has attempted
to obstruct justice.
32.

Since the November, 2014, detention hearing, the

Government has spent considerable time preparing this case for
trial.

As pertinent here, the Government has analyzed

voluminous data provided by Rackspace in Hong Kong, which hosted
the drug distribution websites operated by Defendant.

This data

See, e.g., United States v. Gibson, 481 F. Supp. 2d 419, 420-21 (W.D. Pa.
2007); United States v. Zhang, 2014 WL 5285928, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 16,
2014); cf. United States v. Cidraz-Santiago, 18 F. Supp. 3d 124, 128(D.P.R.
2014) (“The argument that he no longer owns the vehicles listed in the
pretrial services report is so inconsequential that it is hardly worth
mentioning.”).

16

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 17 of 27

shows that Defendant’s websites were heavily engaged in the
trafficking of controlled substances.
33.

Most notably, Defendants were importing massive

quantities of Darvocet and Darvocet-N (Schedule IV narcotics),
into the United States from India.

From 2008 to 2012, the

websites Superdrugsaver.com and IWantMeds.com sold more than
26,000 orders of Darvocet, supplying customers with more than 2
million pills.

Notably, in 2010, Darvocet had been withdrawn

from the U.S. market, but that did not stop Defendant and his
conspirators from selling this dangerous controlled substance.
34.

Defendant’s websites also sold massive quantities of

Soma, a Schedule IV controlled substance.

From 2012 to 2014,

Defendant’s websites cumulatively sold nearly 1 million pills
over more than 10,000 sales.

What this evidence demonstrates is

that Defendant, together with his conspirators, operated a longterm criminal enterprise that focused on providing dangerous
controlled substances to American consumers.

This is not a case

of a single act of bad judgment, but rather the product of
nearly 10 years of intentional criminal activity.

See United

States v. Provenzano, 605 F.2d 85, 95 (3d Cir. 1979) (“[a]
defendant’s propensity to commit crime generally, even if the
resulting harm would not be solely physical, may constitute risk
of danger to come within contemplation of” the Bail Reform Act).

17

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 18 of 27

35.

Additionally, the Bail Reform Act specifically

provides for detention where there is a risk that a defendant
will obstruct justice, and here, Defendant has been charged by a
federal grand jury with obstruction.

A grand jury determined

that there was probable cause to believe that Defendant
endeavored to influence the judicial proceedings before this
Court, in that Defendant’s verbal and written statements to a
co-defendant constituted an attempt to thwart cooperation
against him.
36.

Indeed, in a letter Defendant has admitted to writing

(11/21/2014 Tr. at 48), he specifically instructed his codefendant not to talk about the case or him to anyone; if the
co-defendant failed to comply, Defendant threatened to drag the
co-defendant’s mother into the legal proceedings.

Defendant

followed that up with a verbal confrontation with the codefendant, in which he demanded to know whether the co-defendant
was testifying against him.

Although Defendant appears to dwell

on the issue of whether the co-defendant himself actually felt
physically threatened, obstruction of justice includes all
conduct that is designed to influence court proceedings, whether
in the form of bribery, threats, or intimidation.

Here,

Defendant’s threat to go after the co-defendant’s mother was an
obvious means of attempting to intimidate a co-conspirator into
not cooperating with the Government.
18

See United States v.

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 19 of 27

LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 134 (2d Cir. 2000) (“obstruction of
justice has been a traditional ground for pretrial detention by
the courts, even prior to detention for dangerousness which was
instituted by the Bail Reform Act of 1982.”).
D.

There are no conditions that could reasonably assure
Defendant’s appearance

I.

Defendant has failed to produce sufficient untainted assets
that would ensure his appearance at trial.
37.

Defendant has proposed surety in the form of four

properties – three in Florida, one in California - none of which
are owned by him.

Defendant has also offered $250,000 in cash

as a bond. Given Defendant’s purported net worth of $25,000,
this bond will presumably be paid by others, although Defendant
does not say by whom.

The use of this property and cash is

inappropriate, and the relatively low value of the real property
will not ensure Defendant’s appearance at trial.
38.

First, the Government filed a brief at Doc. No. 76

setting forth its multi-pronged opposition to the use of the
four proposed properties as surety.

In sum and substance, these

properties are not owned by Defendant, and Defendant has no
legal interest in these properties.

These properties are owned

by fugitive Javed Sunesra, who has not come to Court to execute
an affidavit agreeing to forfeit these properties should
Defendant abscond.

Indeed, despite being given ample time,

Defendant has produced no documentation indicating that anyone
19

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 20 of 27

who actually has a legal interest in these properties has agreed
to forfeit these properties should Defendant flee.
39.

Moreover, all four properties are noticed for

forfeiture in the Second Superseding Indictment, and the
Government has filed liens on the three Florida properties as
they were bought with drug proceeds.

See Govt. Ex. I.

Thus,

the Florida properties are now encumbered, and therefore
ineligible to be utilized as a surety bond by Defendant.
40.

Finally, Defendant proposes to deposit with the Court

a $250,000 cash bond.

Defendant has provided no details about

where this money will come from, who is depositing it with the
Court, and who will agree to forfeit the money.

More

importantly, given that, by Defendant’s own admission, his
family has an aggregate net worth of $10 million, $250,000 is a
drop in the bucket, the forfeiture of which will simply be
viewed by Defendant’s family as a cost of doing business.

See

United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 996 (9th Cir. 1990)
(“purpose of bail is not served unless losing the sum would be
deeply-felt hurt to the defendant and his family; the hurt must
be so severe that defendant will return for trial rather than
flee.”).
41.

Additionally, as Defendant’s drug smuggling was a

family affair, and both his brother and his mother have been
20

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 21 of 27

indicted along with him, the Government believes that any monies
deposited by the Sunesra family are likely to be criminally
derived.

Should the Court determine that a secured bond is

appropriate here, the Government intends to exercise its right
under the Bail Reform Act to a hearing to determine the source
of the monies and property designated for forfeiture.

See 18

USC 3142(g)(4)(“[I]n considering the conditions of release … the
judicial officer … shall upon the motion of the Government,
conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be
designated for potential forfeiture or offered as collateral to
secure a bond.”).
II.
42.

Defendant’s proposed pretrial release conditions do
not prevent his flight.
At the detention hearing, ICE Agent Robert Greiser

testified at the detention hearing regarding his experience with
foreign nationals who are released on bond.

Agent Greiser

testified that even if a passport is confiscated, it is
relatively easy for a foreign national to obtain either real or
fraudulent travel documents.

(Tr. 11/20/2014 at 12-14).

Further, even if the Government is to tell the Indian Embassy
not to issue replacement travel documents, India is under no
obligation to comply with the U.S. Government’s request, and
there is nothing “that forces them not to issue a [travel]
document.”

(Tr. 11/20/2014 at 13).
21

Other courts have agreed

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 22 of 27

with the testimony provided by the Agent.

See United States v.

Cohen, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010)
(rejecting offer by defendant to “turn in his passports, to
‘renounce’ his Israeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’
the Israeli Embassy to deny new documents or travel
authorizations to the defendant, as well as waive extradition;”
holding “Defendant offers no authority about the real impact of
these offers or whether they are enforceable in Israel if
defendant were to flee there.”).
43.

Defendant’s proposed place of residence – Allentown,

Pennsylvania – is also insufficient.

Although the Shahs

undoubtedly meant well, they are not appropriate custodians for
Defendant.

Defendant has never lived with the Shahs before, he

has never visited them in Pennsylvania, and his past
interactions with the Shahs seemed to be confined to family
visits in India every “one or two years.”

(11/21/14 Tr. at 92).

More importantly, both members of the Shahs are absent from
their home every day from 5:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.
Tr. at 93, 98-99).

(11/21/14

This absence would give Defendant an ample

head start if he chose to flee this country.
44.

The Court then considered and rejected Defendant’s

request for an electronic monitoring bracelet, as an electronic
monitoring bracelet would not ensure that he stayed at his

22

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 23 of 27

residence, but would, at best, simply alert law enforcement that
he had fled.

United States v. Benevolence Int’l Found., 222 F.

Supp. 2d 1005, 1007 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (electronic surveillance
systems can be circumvented and the monitoring equipment can be
rendered inoperative; electronic monitoring does not stop a
person from fleeing); United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628,632
(2d Cir. 1993) (“electronic surveillance systems can be
circumvented by the wonders of science and of sophisticated
electronic technology”); United States v. Williams, Crim. A. No.
08-201-4, 2009 WL 1544884, at *2-3 (E.D. Pa. June 2, 2009)
(finding that given the nature of the crimes at issue and the
severity of the punishment if convicted, electronic monitoring
would not ensure appearance).
45.

Finally, although Defendant now raises the prospect of

private security providing a round-the-clock monitoring system
at a rented apartment, this solution raises profound issues that
render it unworkable. 4

First, given Defendant’s lack of assets,

he has presented no solution for how this very expensive
security will be paid for.

Second, it is apparent that both

District and Magistrate courts nationwide are split on the issue
of whether the replication of a private prison, which is
essentially what Defendant proposes, is even contemplated by the
4

Although Defendant briefly discussed the issue of hiring private security in
his opening brief, this issue was not seriously presented as a viable option
to the Magistrate Judge.

23

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 24 of 27

Bail Reform Act.

See, e.g., United States v. Valerio, 9

F.Supp.3d 283, 292-93 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (summarizing nationwide
case-law regarding the pros and cons of defendants being allowed
to buy their way out of prison by hiring security).
46.

But regardless of whether this Court permits a wealthy

defendant to pay handsomely for the privilege of replicating a
private jail at a Pittsburgh apartment, it is clear that even
such an elaborate system of home detention would not ensure
Defendant’s appearance at trial.

See Valerio, 9 F.Supp.3d at

295-97 (reviewing case law and holding that home detention
monitored by security guards poses significant costs and burdens
on the Government and does not ensure appearance at trial);
United States v. Colorado-Cebado, 2013 WL 58522621 (W.D. Tex.
Oct 30, 2013) (rejecting bid for release to home detention
monitored by armed guards, and ruling that “[w]hen an armed
guard with license to use that firearm is needed to ensure that
a defendant does not flee, then conditions of release are simply
not appropriate, regardless of how elaborate a release proposal
a wealthy defendant might construct”).
E.

Defendant has not been denied due process by his pretrial
detention.
47.

Defendant finally argues that given the complexity of

this case and the volume of discovery, pretrial release is
mandated as continued detention will violate due process.
24

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 25 of 27

48.

The Government notes that Defendant has been fortunate

enough to hire three skilled attorneys, none of whom have
represented to the Court that they have been unable to view or
analyze the discovery provided by the Government.

The

Government further believes that all emails provided to defense
counsel can be printed or converted to PDF and placed on a DVD.
The Government is not aware of other defendants at NEOCC who
have been unable to view or look at PDF documents on computers
at NEOCC.

Thus, while it would be undoubtedly more convenient

for defense counsel to have Defendant close at hand to discuss
the case, the ability of Defendant to communicate with his
counsel and to contribute to his defense is not so impacted that
it has deprived him of the due process of law.
49.

Finally, while the Government is aware that extended

periods of incarceration pre-trial can deprive a defendant of
due process, see, e.g., United States v. Accetturo, 783 F.2d 382
(3d Cir. 1986), given the complexity of this case and the large
volume of discovery, this point has not yet been reached.

See

United States v. Zhang, 2014 WL 5285928 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 16, 2014)
(two-year pretrial detention did not violate due process where
the case against the defendant was complex and involved large
volume of discovery); United States v. Bianchi, 2006 WL 2338285
(E.D. Pa. Aug. 10, 2006) (approximately 15-months of pretrial
detention did not violate due process given complexity of case
25

Case 2:14-cr-00158-CB Document 106 Filed 01/18/15 Page 26 of 27

and need to obtain foreign evidence); see also United States v.
Ali, 534 Fed. Appx. 1 (DC Cir. 2013) (two-year pretrial
detention did not violate due process); United States v. Briggs,
697 F.3d 98 (2d Cir. 2012) (26-months of pretrial detention did
not violate due process).

Indeed, Defendant has been

incarcerated for five months, with the Government, at best,
responsible for delay only after November 1, 2014. 5

Accordingly,

while the issue of due process can potentially be raised at a
later date, given the complexity of the case and the large
volume of discovery, now is simply not the time.
50.

In sum, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant’s

motion for revocation of the order of detention should be
denied.

5

Even in the period subsequent to November 1, Defendant has approached the
Government for a plea agreement, has indicated a likelihood of pleading, and
has even asked the Government to “hold off taking further action against
Zuned” in order to negotiate a global plea. Thus, even for the period postNovember 1, the Government is not responsible for the entirety of the delay.
