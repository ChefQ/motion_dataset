Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
DISMISS AND MOTION TO
SANCTION

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby responds
as follows to those portions of defendants’ “Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice and Motion to

-2Sanction Jennifer D. Auchterlonie” (defendants’ motion) that merit a response:
The United States notes at the outset that defendants’ motion is largely unintelligible, and
it generally raises only shopworn arguments characteristic of frivolous tax-protestor rhetoric that
has been universally rejected by this and other courts. As the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit has aptly stated, there is “no need to refute [such] arguments with somber reasoning and
copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable
merit.” Crain v. Commissioner, 737 F.2d 1417, 1417 (5th Cir. 1984).
1.

Defendants’ motion to dismiss.

Although not altogether clear, defendants appear to base their motion to dismiss on the
grounds that, according to defendants, the Court lacks jurisdiction over this matter. See
Defendants’ motion, pp. 21, 31. However, the legal and factual basis for the Court’s jurisdiction
was properly set forth in the amended complaint as follows:
1. This is a civil action brought by the United States of America to reduce
to judgment federal tax assessments against defendants Donald L. Hymes and
Rita M. Hymes and to foreclose federal tax liens against certain real property.
2. This action is brought at the direction of the Attorney General of the
United States and at the request and with the authorization of the Chief Counsel
of the Internal Revenue Service, a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury,
pursuant to Sections 7401 and 7403 of the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) of
1986 (26 U.S.C.).
3. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to I.R.C. § 7402
and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1340 and 1345.
4. Venue is proper in the District of Alaska pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§
1391(b) and 1396 because defendants Donald L. Hymes and Rita M. Hymes
reside in this judicial district and the real property on which the United States
seeks foreclosure is located in this judicial district.

-3Defendants do not challenge the jurisdictional basis established in the amended
complaint, rather, defendants argue that this Court cannot determine whether defendants are
subject to the tax laws of the United States. See Defendants’ motion, pp. 25, 27. Defendants’
argument has no merit, as numerous courts have found individuals to be subject to federal tax
laws.
In In re Becraft, 885 F.2d 547 (9th Cir. 1989), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stated,
“For over 75 years, the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have both implicitly and
explicitly recognized the Sixteenth Amendment’s authorization of a non-proportioned direct
income tax on United States citizens residing in the United States and thus the validity of the
federal income tax laws as applied to such citizens.” Id. at 548 (citing Brushaber v. Union
Pacific Railroad Co., 240 U.S. 1, 12-19, 36 S.Ct. 236, 239-42 (1916)); United States v. Ward,
833 F.2d 1538, 1539 (11 th Cir. 1987); Lovell v. United States, 755 F.2d 517, 519 (7th Cir.
1984); Parker v. Commissioner, 742 F.469, 471 (5th Cir. 1984); United States v. Romero, 640
F.2d 1014, 1016 (9th Cir. 1981). That defendants are subject to the federal income tax laws set
forth in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., is beyond debate. Additionally, there is no legal
authority to support defendants’ argument that this Court cannot make such a determination in
this case.
2.

Defendants’ motion for sanctions.

Although not altogether clear, defendants appear to take issue with the Forms 4340,
Certificates of Assessments, Payments, and Other Specified Matters (Forms 4340), copies of
which were provided to defendants by counsel for the United States to show the assessment of

2565126.1

-4the taxes at issue in this matter. See Defendants’ motion, pp. 1-2, 21, 37-38. Defendants point to
the Declaration of Jennifer D. Auchterlonie, and attachments thereto, filed in this matter at
Docket # 104. In that declaration, the counsel for the United States stated as follows:
2.
On January 5, 2007, in response to an informal request by
defendants, I mailed defendants copies of the Forms 4340, Certificates of
Assessments, Payments, and Other Specified Matters, with respect to the federal
tax assessments sought to be reduced to judgment in this matter. Attached hereto
as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the cover letter I mailed to defendants,
transmitting the Forms 4340.
3.
On March 2, 2007, in response do defendants’ formal request for
production of documents, I mailed defendants copies of documents found in the
IRS administrative files concerning this matter. The Bates stamp on those copies
reflects that 989 pages of documents were produced to defendants on that date.
Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the United States’
Response to Defendants’ First Request for Production of Documents, including
the certificate of service, but not including the attached documents.
In defendants’ motion, defendants state that they requested production of “a 23C or some
substantive proof that there was an Assessment made.” Defendants’ motion, p. 2. Defendants
appear to argue that the Forms 4340 produced by counsel for the United States failed to satisfy
defendants’ request for proof of an assessment. Defendants’ argument is without merit.
Forms 4340 are the appropriate means of establishing an assessment, Hughes v. United
States, 953 F.2d 531, 540 (9th Cir. 1992), and such Forms also show that the income tax
liabilities were properly assessed against the defendants, that the notices and demand for
payment were properly sent, and that the defendants are presumptively liable for the unpaid
income taxes, interest, penalties, and other statutory additions identified thereon. Koff v. United
States, 3 F.3d 1297, 1298 (9th Cir. 1993) (“It is settled in this circuit that [Forms 4340] are
‘probative evidence in and of themselves and, in the absence of contrary evidence, are sufficient

-5to establish that . . . assessments were properly made’”) (citations omitted); Huff v. United States,
10 F.3d 1440, 1145-47 (9th Cir. 1993); Hansen v. United States, 7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir. 1993).
Thus, there is no legal authority to support defendants’ argument that the United States has failed
to produce the requested proof of the assessments at issue in this matter.
Defendants further allege that counsel for the United States “has provided no substantive
documents mandated by the FRCP to the Hymes.” Defendants’ motion, p. 38. However, as set
forth in the Declaration of Jennifer D. Auchterlonie, quoted above, said counsel has produced to
defendants 989 pages of documents from the IRS administrative files concerning this matter.
Thus, defendants’ allegation is not supported by the evidence in this matter. Accordingly,
defendants’ motion for sanctions is baseless. Moreover, to the extent that defendants are seeking
discovery sanctions against the United States, a motion for such relief must be brought under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 and Local Rule 37.1, and to the extent that defendants are seeking sanctions
against counsel for the United States, a motion for such relief must be brought under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 11. Defendants have not complied with either Rule 37 or Rule 11 in bringing their motion.
Inasmuch as defendants have failed to show any legal or factual basis for dismissal of this
case or for the imposition of any type of sanctions, the United States respectfully requests that
