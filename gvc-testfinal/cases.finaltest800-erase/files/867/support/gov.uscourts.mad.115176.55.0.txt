AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS
PLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT
In light of two recent cases constituting binding precedent upon this court, Northwest,
Inc. v. Ginsberg, -- US – (2014), 2014 WL 1301865 and Brown v. United Airlines, 720 F.3d 60
(2013), cert denied, --- S.Ct. ----, 2014 WL 1343623, American Airlines, Inc. (“American”)
moves this Court to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ claims asserted in the Amended Complaint pursuant to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).

As the Supreme Court and the First Circuit have

repeatedly established, all of the Plaintiffs’ claims are preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act
(“ADA”). Ginsberg, 2014 WL 1301865; Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association,
128 S.Ct. 989 (2008); Brown, 720 F.3d 60; DiFiore v. American Airlines, Inc., 646 F.3d 81 (1st
Cir. 2011).

Additionally, the claims asserted by the Massachusetts Plaintiffs are ripe for

dismissal under DiFiore v. American Airlines, Inc., 646 F.3d 81 (2011). American thus requests
entry of judgment in its favor on all counts of the Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, together with
costs, fees, and all other such relief as the Court deems appropriate. In support of this motion,
American has submitted a Memorandum of Law filed herewith.

REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT
Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d) of the United States District Court for the District
of Massachusetts, American Airlines, Inc. hereby requests oral argument and wishes to be heard
on this motion to dismiss as it may assist the Court.
