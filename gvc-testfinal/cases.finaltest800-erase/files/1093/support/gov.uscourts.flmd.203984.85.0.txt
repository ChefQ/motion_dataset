Case No. 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TJW

_________________________/
OBJECTOR JOEL SHAPIRO’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM
Objector Joel Shapiro (Shapiro), through counsel and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(c)(1)(A) and Local Rule 3.01, hereby moves for a protective order forbidding the
deposition of him which Class Counsel seek to take on April 18, 2008. As grounds for
this motion, Shapiro states:
Local Rule 3.01(g) Certification
John Pentz, counsel for Shapiro, met and conferred with Douglass Kreis, Class
Counsel, regarding this motion both by telephone on August 8, 2008, and by the email
sent by Pentz to Kreis on August 10, 2008. Counsel were unable to resolve the issues set
forth herein.
Memorandum
Class counsel is attempting an end-run around this Court’s authority, as they seek
to inquire into matters that this Court has previously ruled are not relevant to this

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 85 Filed 08/14/08 Page 2 of 12 PageID 1299

proceeding. Moreover, the purpose of the noticed deposition is clearly to harass and
retaliate against class members who exercised their right to appear and be heard in this
case.
Class counsel has known since at least April of 2008, when notice was mailed to
class members, that Shapiro was a class member in the class action. Yet they waited until
August 11, 2008, after Shapiro filed an objection and notice of his intent to appear
through counsel at the fairness hearing, to serve their subpoena and notice of deposition.
Notices of deposition were also served upon other class members who filed objections,
but not upon any other class members.
The deposition notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Items1 through 8 on
Exhibit A to the Subpoena are easily and quickly dealt with, as Shapiro has already
produced to class counsel all such responsive documents, and Shapiro’s counsel informed
attorney Douglass Kreis of that fact by email. There is no purpose served by requiring
Mr. Shapiro and his counsel to incur the expense and burden of traveling to Boca Raton
to reiterate the same thing.
With regard to category 9 on Subpoena Exhibit A, this Court has already ruled
that such information is neither relevant to the case nor required to be disclosed by class
members wishing to exercise their right to appear and be heard. The parties asked this
Court to approve a form of notice that would have required objectors to identify all
objections they had filed during the past five years. Consistent with accepted practice,
the Court rejected that portion of the notice and ordered that it be stricken. The notice

2

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 85 Filed 08/14/08 Page 3 of 12 PageID 1300

that Mr. Shapiro received contained no such requirement. Class counsel apparently seeks
an end run around this Court’s ruling through the subpoena.
Shapiro has just returned to the United States from a nine-week trip to Denmark.
His counsel, John Pentz, is currently on vacation and will not return to his office until
August 18, 2008, the date on which the deposition is currently noticed. If class counsel is
permitted to pursue discovery into category nine of Exhibit A, Shapiro would be required
to meet with his counsel prior to the deposition and to review any responsive documents
for privilege and confidentiality. Notice given for this deposition does not afford a
reasonable time for Mr. Shapiro to prepare for the deposition with his counsel, given Mr.
Pentz’ current unavailability.
Shapiro has simultaneously moved to quash the subpoena in the Southern District
of Florida.
Even if the scope of the deposition is narrowed to include only items relevant to
the Certegy class action, the deposition would be purely retributive, unduly burdensome
and harassing, since Shapiro and his counsel would be forced to travel to Boca Raton and
give up most of a day simply in order to reiterate that he has no further information
related to the case not already filed with the Court. Class counsel cannot meet the burden
of Rule 45 of “showing a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be
otherwise met without undue hardship.” Indeed, class counsel has not and cannot
articulate any need for the material or any relevance to the Certegy case whatsoever. Mr.
Shapiro’s class membership is not in question. His receipt of individual mailed notice is
conclusive proof that he was identified by Certegy as someone whose personal

3

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 85 Filed 08/14/08 Page 4 of 12 PageID 1301

information was illegally disclosed by Certegy. The question posed by his objection is
what the remedy should be. There is nothing further that can be discovered from Mr.
Shapiro that would aid in that analysis, which is a purely legal question.
WHEREFORE, Shapiro respectfully requests that the Court grant this motion for
a protective order and forbid the taking of his deposition pursuant to the Notice and
Subpoena Duces Tecum set forth in Exhibit A.
Respectfully submitted,
