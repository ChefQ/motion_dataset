REPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO OBJECTOR JOEL SHAPIRO’S
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM

Objector Joel Shapiro (“Objector Shapiro”) has moved, through his counsel, John J.
Pentz (“attorney Pentz”), for a protective order.1 Objector Shapiro, however, fails to provide
an adequate factual basis or legal support for the incorrect assertion that he cannot, or should
not be deposed in this matter. Applicable law makes clear that Objector Shapiro can be
1

Objector Shapiro indicates that he has “simultaneously moved to quash the subpoena in the
Southern District of Florida.” Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel, however, have been unable to find
any such motion on the docket.

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 86 Filed 08/15/08 Page 2 of 11 PageID 1311

deposed. Additionally, given the nature of the objection, as more fully stated herein, and that
Objector Shapiro’s counsel, attorney Pentz, refused to agree to any date for his deposition
and actually provided incorrect information regarding Objector Shapiro’s availability prior to
him being personally served with a subpoena (when he advised plaintiffs’ counsel that his
client was out of the country, when in fact he was not), Objector Shapiro cannot now
legitimately argue unavailability or undue burden to escape the procedurally and
substantively proper subpoena and deposition.
INTRODUCTION
On August 1, 2008, the last date to file timely objections, Objector Shapiro filed an
objection to the settlement through attorney Pentz.2 Objector Shapiro has requested to
appear, through attorney Pentz, at the Final Fairness Hearing. Further, Attorney Pentz is
seeking leave to be admitted pro hac vice before this court.
On August 7, 2008, Douglas Kreis, one of plaintiffs’ counsel, called attorney Pentz
several times and left a message with him regarding the scheduling of Objector Shapiro’s
deposition in this matter; attorney Pentz never responded. Mr. Kreis then emailed attorney
Pentz, inquiring whether he would accept service of the deposition notice and subpoena
duces tecum for Objector Shapiro. Mr. Kreis also inquired as to whether the date and time
stated therein were suitable, and if not, indicated that accommodations could be made for a
mutually agreeable time and location. Despite the willingness of plaintiffs’ counsel to work
with attorney Pentz to find a mutually-agreeable time and place for Objector Shapiro’s
deposition, attorney Pentz refused to accept service on his client’s behalf, and refused to

otherwise make his client available, indicating that Objector Shapiro was out of the country
and in Denmark. In fact, Objector Shapiro was not in Denmark at that time. Rather, he had
returned to the United States on August 3, 2008, contrary to attorney Pentz’s representations.
Pursuant to Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Class Counsel issued a
subpoena on Objector Shapiro commanding his attendance for deposition at 10:00 a.m.
Eastern Time on August 18, 2008, at Esquire Deposition, 2499 Glades Rd., Boca Raton,
Florida, 33431, which is just twenty-one (21) miles from Objector Shapiro’s residence. The
subpoena also commanded that Objector Shapiro produce several documents at that time. On
August 11, 2008, Objector Shapiro was personally served with the subpoena at his home, but
only after much effort, as Objector Shapiro was observed hiding inside his house and only
answered the door after approximately twenty minutes of ringing the doorbell.
ARGUMENT
I.

The Deposition of Objector Shapiro is Appropriate Pursuant to Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure 30 and 45, and is Made Even More So Given the Underlying
Facts of His Objection.
“A party may, by oral questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave

of court.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(1) .3 The propriety of that right is underscored by the fact that
(1) Objector Shapiro mischaracterizes and appears to misunderstand the settlement; (2) he
and his attorney appear to be, and in fact are, professional objectors; and (3) such
circumstances create an aura of a pretextual nature, as opposed to substantive concerns of a

3

The scope of discovery is governed by Rule 26, which allows “discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending litigation.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).
The term “relevant” in this definition is to be “construed broadly to encompass any matter that bears
on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that bears on, any issue that is or may be in the case.”
Oppenheimer Fund v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978).

Class member. Furthermore, “a Rule 45 subpoena should be enforced unless it is clear ‘that
the evidence sought can have no possible bearing on the issues.’” Benavides v. Velocity IQ,
Inc., 2006 WL 680656, *2 (M.D. Fl. Mar. 15, 2006) (citing Bush Development Corp. v.
Harbour Place Associates, 632 F. Supp. 1359, 1364 (E.D. Va. 1986)). “[A] court must
examine whether a request contained in a subpoena duces tecum is overly broad or seeks
irrelevant information under the same standards set forth in Rule 26(b).” Commissariat a
L’Energie Atomique v. Samsung Electronics Co., 2006 WL 5003562, *2 (M.D. Fl. June 14,
2006).
Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel
have the right to depose Objector Shapiro regarding, inter alia, the bases of his objection, his
standing as an objector, and the context in which his objection has been brought. Also, CoLead Settlement Class Counsel have the right to command that Objector Shapiro produce at
the deposition certain documentation relating to his prior experience(s) as an objector. While
the Court did not require said documentation to be filed with each objection, the situation
here, involving repeat objectors, requires a closer inquiry. Objector Shapiro’s motion cites no
applicable law4 contradicting these facts, but rather omits pertinent facts, and follows his
usual course of denigrating other counsel.

4

Objector Shapiro’s statement that Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel must show “a substantial need
for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship” only applies to
Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 45(c)(3)(B), which deals with disclosing trade secrets, an unretained expert’s
opinion, or a person who is not a party to “incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to
attend trial,” none of which are applicable here.

II.

The Deposition of Objector Shapiro Serves Important Purposes.
Contrary to attorney Pentz’s suggestion, Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel are not

deposing Objector Shapiro to retaliate against any objection or to harass any objector.
Respectfully, Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel fully understand that the Court will consider
any objection that is made, including Objector Shapiro’s. However, the context in which an
objection is made is probative and important. In this instance, on the last day for objections,
an objection was filed by a lawyer who is intimately familiar with the objection process, as
attorney Pentz has made a career out of it, including filing previous objections on behalf of
Objector Shapiro. While Objector Shapiro may have standing to make the objection, his
position in this case raises questions as to whether he has a substantial interest in the points
raised on his behalf or whether those objections were made in a pretextual context.
Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel are not attempting to stop the Court from
considering objections.

Respectfully, they would not, and could not do so. But the

circumstances here raise important questions going to the integrity of the objection: Is the
objection a legitimate objection or pretextual? Did Objector Shapiro really mean this, or was
it his lawyer’s view? Do we really have a Class member who objects to the settlement, or has
a lawyer with an extensive objection history allowed his views to be filed under Objector
Shapiro’s name? Is Objector Shapiro aware that, at a minimum, portions of his purported
objection are frivolous, given that Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel are not seeking $4.3
million in fees?
This is not to say that in a pretextual context, points cannot be made regarding the
terms of a settlement. However, the legitimacy and sincerity of a Settlement Class Member’s

5

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 86 Filed 08/15/08 Page 6 of 11 PageID 1315

concerns are impacted by how the objection arose, how it was facilitated, and how it was
pursued. It is necessary for a court to protect the judicial system’s integrity from potentially
ill-motivated and/or unfounded objections.

See Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg,

NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS (4th ed.) § 11.55, text at n.5 (citing Shaw v. Toshiba Am. Info.
Systems, Inc., 91 F. Supp. 2d 942, 974–75 (E.D. Tex. 2000)). Such information provides
more information for the Court in the Court’s consideration of the objection and its
underlying merits.
Allowing depositions of an objector in the position of Objector Shapiro is, as shown
above, appropriate and not unique to this case. Not only is the issuance of a subpoena not
unique to this class case, but such depositions, as with the facts here, have multiple positive
effects on class action litigation. They gather additional information to aid the Court to
determine if an objection is pretextual or substantive, i.e., they go to the integrity of the
objection and its origin. Objector Shapiro’s motion claims that the deposition only seeks
information about other cases. Not so. The request for documents does not limit the scope of
the deposition and clearly relates, inter alia, to the likely pretextual nature of this objection.
The objection strikes out against the interests of the Class, and denigrates the efforts and
professional integrity of Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel.

Co-Lead Settlement Class

Counsel have a duty to protect the interests of the Class, which is exactly what such
depositions are designed to do, including protecting the integrity of the judicial system.
III.

Class Counsel Have Made Efforts to Accommodate Objector Shapiro.
Contrary to the Shapiro Motion’s allegations of harassment and burden, Co-Lead

Settlement Class Counsel have made every effort to work with attorney Pentz to coordinate

6

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 86 Filed 08/15/08 Page 7 of 11 PageID 1316

the deposition of Objector Shapiro. Out of professional courtesy, instead of serving Objector
Shapiro with a subpoena without notifying attorney Pentz, which the law provides for,
Douglass Kreis, one of plaintiffs’ counsel, contacted attorney Pentz, in addition to his local
counsel David M. Snyder,5 and attempted to set the date cooperatively. As stated supra,
attorney Pentz continually refused to agree to any date, further stating that his client was out
of the country. It was only when personal service on Objector Shapiro was made that CoLead Settlement Class Counsel discovered that this statement was completely false. Thus,
given the professional courtesy Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel extended to Objector
Shapiro and his attorney, and the fact that attorney Pentz provided erroneous information to
Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel, any unavailability argument should be denied,
particularly where Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel remain available, as previously stated
to attorney Pentz, to re-set the deposition, although the time limitations have become severe
because of his position.6
Objector Shapiro argues that Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel “waited until August
11, 2008, after Shapiro filed an objection . . . to serve their subpoena and notice of
deposition,” even though they knew Shapiro was a member of the class since at least April
2008. Nevertheless, Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel had no need to depose Shapiro in
April 2008. Rather, the need arose when Objector Shapiro filed his current objection through

Attorney Snyder stated that all questions pertaining to Mr. Shapiro should be directed to attorney
Pentz, and that he was told that Mr. Shapiro was out of the country.
6
Co-Lead Settlement Class Counsel contacted attorney Pentz on August 15, 2008, informing him that
they would be willing to reschedule the deposition for Tuesday, August 19, 2008, to accommodate
attorney Pentz’s vacation plans. Despite these attempts at accommodation, attorney Pentz has
indicated that in light of Objector Shapiro’s pending motion, Objector Shapiro will not be appearing
for his deposition presently noticed for August 18, 2008.

7

Case 8:07-cv-01434-SDM-TGW Document 86 Filed 08/15/08 Page 8 of 11 PageID 1317

his counsel, attorney Pentz, who is a “professional objector” in every sense of the term.
Objector Shapiro makes these arguments despite the fact that he himself waited until August
1, 2008, to file his objection, which was the very last day to do so.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Representative Plaintiffs, through Settlement Class CoLead Counsel, pray that this Honorable Court enter an order:
(a)

Denying Objector Shapiro’s Motion for Protective Order and Incorporated
Memorandum;

(b)

In the alternative, denying the motion, but compelling the deposition of Joel
Shapiro to be held on August 21, 2008, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, in Fort
Myers, Florida; or

(c)

Such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.
