The United States, through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to defendant’s Motion

17 for Discovery Re: Digital Evidence Search (Document No. 890) as follows. On October 22,
18 2012, the United States provided defendant, pursuant to defendant’s request, an additional
19 summary of the nature and time frame of the searches conducted by all of the case agents who
20 searched any aspect of defendant’s computers in this case. This information should be sufficient
21 for defendant’s stated purposes as of this date. If after review of the response, defendant has an
22 additional request or more specific request, the United States will again seek to respond in a
23 timely manner. Therefore, defendant’s motion may be considered moot at this time.
