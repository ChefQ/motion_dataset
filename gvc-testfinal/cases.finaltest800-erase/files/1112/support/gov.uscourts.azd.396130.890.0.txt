Defendant.

16

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion For Disclosure RE: Digital Evidence Search. The defendant is filing this motion to
18 request that the Court order the government to provide the additional discovery the defendant
19 requested from the government after he filed of his Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #824), and
20 incorporated Memorandum Re: Fourth Amendment Violations (re: N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/
21 PVT) (Dkt. #830-1), regarding seizure of digital evidence from physical data storage devices
22 seized from 431 El Camino Real, Apartment No. 1122, Santa Clara, CA 95050 (hereafter
23 “apartment No. 1122”). On June 21, 2012, after the defendant filed Dkt. #824 and #830, the
24 government provided the defendant with new discovery relevant to the government's
25 exploratory rummaging through data storage devices seized from apartment No. 1122 and
26 storage unit No. A-47. The new discovery changed the facts of the case and the defendant's
27 arguments with respect to the government's search/seizure of digital data. Based on the June
28 21, 2012 disclosure, the defendant had reason to and did make a new discovery request for
-1-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 890 Filed 09/28/12 Page 2 of 7

1 production of similar evidence. The defendant made the new discovery request via an
2 emailed letter dated July 5, 2012.[1] The government failed to acknowledge the defendant's
3 July 5, 2012 discovery request and has provided no additional evidence.[2] The defendant is
4 filing this motion pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), United States v.
5 Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 (9th Cir. 2000), and Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E) et seq.,
6 and (a)(1)(F) et seq. By failing to obtain and disclose the requested evidence—all of which
7 is Brady material—the government is violating the defendant's Fifth Amendment due process
8 rights and statutory rights under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
9 Pursuant to LRCiv 7.1(d)(2) when referenced through LRCrim 12.1, the defendant hereby

MOTION FOR DISCOVERY RE: DIGITAL EVIDENCE SEARCH
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

10 incorporates by reference his First Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And
11 Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants[3] and all exhibits referenced therein.

LRCiv 37.1, referenced through LRCiv 7.2(k) when referenced through LRCrim 12.1,

Local Rules Of Civil Procedure, 37.1 requirements.

14 requires the defendant to include with the accompanying discovery motion three separate,
15 distinct, numbered paragraphs addressing the following:
16
17

(1) the question propounded, the interrogatory submitted, the designation
requested or the inspection requested;

18

(2) the answer, designation or response received; and

19

(3) the reason(s) why said answer, designation or response is deficient.

20

LRCiv 37.1(a) et seq.

21
22 However, LRCiv 37.1(b) states that “[t]he foregoing requirement shall not apply where there
23 has been a complete and total failure to respond to a discovery request or set of discovery

See July 5, 2012 discovery request letter from Daniel Rigmaiden to AUSA Frederick
25 A. Battista; (ATTACHMENT 02).
See the defendant's Statement Pursuant To LRCiv 7.2(j); (ATTACHMENT 01).
26 2.
The defendant does not have a docket number to cite for his First Supplement To
27 3.
Motion To Suppress RE: Search And Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants
28 considering it is being filed by the defendant's shadow counsel's office at the same time this
motion is filed.

1 requests.” Id. Considering the government has not responded to the defendant's new
2 discovery requests, he is not required to follow LRCiv 37.1(a) et seq.
3

II.

4

The new evidence provided to the defendant by the government on June 21, 2012

The defendant's unanswered/ignored discovery requests.

5 drastically changed the facts of the case and thus drastically changed the defendant's
6 arguments. Based on the June 21, 2012 evidence, the defendant filed his First Supplement
7 To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal.
8 Warrants wherein he submitted supplemental, corrected, and superseded facts and arguments
9 with respect to the government's seizure of digital data under the N.D.Cal. 08-70460-

MOTION FOR DISCOVERY RE: DIGITAL EVIDENCE SEARCH
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

10 HRL/PVT and N.D.Cal. 08-70502-PVT warrants. In the supplemental filing, the defendant
11 applied the June 21, 2012 evidence to his prior “fishing exhibition / wholesale suppression”
12 argument and also raised two new arguments relating to a lack of probable cause and
13 technical violations of the noted warrants. See id. Because the success of the defendant's
14 “fishing exhibition / wholesale suppression” argument depends on the severity of the
15 government's exploratory rummaging, and because the success of the defendant's “technical
16 violations” argument could perceivably depend on the degree of prejudice to the defendant,
17 the government's production of additional evidence is merited. The facts and arguments
18 contained in the defendant's First Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And
19 Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants, which are incorporated into this
20 motion by reference above, support the defendant's request for additional discovery.
21

The defendant requested the following from the government:

22

1.

All evidence relating to government agents/actors providing (and when/where

23 they were provided) data originating from seized physical data storage devices to other
24 government agents/actors—regardless of whether the government agents/actors are federal
25 or state and regardless of whether the government agents/actors are involved in
26 investigations relating to CR08-814-PHX-DGC or to other cases and/or investigations not
27 resulting in charges/cases.[4]
28

4.

Determining what digital data was searched/seized and when it was searched/seized
-3-

2.

All evidence relating to government agents/actors providing (and when/where

2 they were provided) data originating from seized physical data storage devices to defendants
3 and their attorneys in case Nos. CR08-814-PHX-DGC, CR08-312-PHX-JAT, and in all other
4 federal and state cases.[5]
5

3.

All evidence relating to government agents/actors accessing (and when/where

6 they were accessed) virtual machine clones originating from seized physical data storage
7 devices.[6]
8

Based on the points and authorities set forth above, the defendant respectfully requests

9 that the Court order the government to disclose to the defense the evidence listed at Nos. 1

MOTION FOR DISCOVERY RE: DIGITAL EVIDENCE SEARCH
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

10 through 3 above.
11

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

12 however, he authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion on his behalf
13 using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has never attended law school.
14 The defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be liberally construed and held to
15 less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404
16 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).
17

LRCrim 12.2(a) requires that the undersigned include the following statement in all

18 will allow for the defendant to determine precisely what evidence was seized within the 30day search window and precisely what evidence was seized beyond the 30-day search
19 window. A detailed analysis of the data searches/seizures will provide additional facts in
support of the defendant's exploratory rummaging argument and will also allow for the
20 defendant to establish a time line of data seizures for the purpose of examining the issue of
taint if the Court decides to only suppress evidence seized (i.e., isolated within the scope of
21 relevant warrants) after the 30-day search window expiration date.
Considering the relevant data storage devices “actually contain many more files than
22 5.
those that fall within the parameters of the Search Warrant and its attachments[,]” see Dkt.
23 #863-1, EXHIBIT 01, the government sharing private data with non-government thirdparties will support a claim of further privacy violations and thus further government
24 misconduct. Additional government misconduct would lend more towards an unreasonable
search and thus benefit the defendant's arguments.
25
6.
As explained in the defendant's First Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search
And
Seizure
Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants, in addition to the forensic data
26
images as a whole, the case agents continued to access the virtual machines—which are
27 clones of the entire seized computer system and storage devices—for more than a year after
the date of the relevant physical searches. Evidence of additional protracted searching by
28 government actors will support the defendant's “fishing exhibition / wholesale suppression”
argument and “technical violations” argument.
