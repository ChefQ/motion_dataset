Plaintiff,
MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF
TIME

v.

17 Daniel David Rigmaiden,
18

Defendant.

20

The United States, by and through its attorneys undersigned, respectfully requests this

21

Court enter an order enlarging the time for the government to complete its response to defendant

22

Daniel David Rigmaiden’s Motion For Discovery Re Digital Evidence Search (Docket No. 890)

23

until Monday, October 22, 2012. The prosecution needs additional time in order to prepare a

24

response in this matter. The prosecution is finalizing its analysis of digital evidence searches

25

among the case agents in order to prepare a response. Demands generated by other cases

26

assigned to the lead prosecutor have also played a role in the lengthening the response time in

27

this matter. To date, numerous other recent requests by defendant for duplicate copies of

28

discovery previously provided to defendant, or his prior defense counsel, have all been

completed. In light of this motion, the prosecution recognizes that defendant may need more

2

time in order to complete his pending reply with respect to his motion to suppress and has no

3

objection to an extension with respect to the reply.

It is expected that excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) may occur as a result of
this motion or an order based thereon.
Respectfully submitted this 12th day of October, 2012.
