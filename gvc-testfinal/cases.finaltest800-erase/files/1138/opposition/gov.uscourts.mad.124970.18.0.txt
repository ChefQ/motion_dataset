PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiffs submit this memorandum of law in opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss
plaintiffs’ claims arising under Massachusetts state wage and hour law and common law. Also
pending before the Court is plaintiffs’ motion to remand this action, consisting of state law
claims, to the Massachusetts Superior Court. Plaintiffs’ respectfully request that defendants’
motion be dismissed in its entirety.
FACTS
Plaintiffs filed this action against defendants for violations of state statutory and common
laws due to defendants’ failure to compensate plaintiffs for all time worked.
In particular, defendants maintain at least three policies which deprive employees’
compensation for time worked. First, defendants maintain the “Meal Break Deduction Policy,”
by automatically deducting half an hour of time from each employee for a meal break, and
failing to ensure that employees receive their breaks. See Docket No. 1, Exhibit 1, Complaint
(“Complaint”) ¶¶ 73, 74. Employees often perform work during their breaks and thus should be
compensated for such time. See Complaint ¶ 75. Second, employees perform work before and
after their shifts for which they receive no compensation due to defendants’ policies. See
Complaint ¶¶ 93, 94. Third, although employees are suffered or permitted to attend training
sessions, defendants fail to compensate employees for such time. See Complaint ¶¶ 97, 98.
As a result of defendants’ actions, plaintiffs have claims for: (1) violations of Mass. Gen.
Laws ch. 149 §§ 148, 150 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151 §§ 1A, 1B, because plaintiffs perform
work for defendants without pay for all time worked;1 (2) breach of contract, express and
implied, due to the contractual relationship and due to the on-going dealings and course of
conduct between defendants and their employees, which defendants breached by failing to
compensate the employees for all of the time they worked for defendants;2 (3) conversion,
because the wages were due to employees as of the time the labor and services were performed

and defendants kept such wages;3 (4) quantum meruit/unjust enrichment, because plaintiffs
performed work and defendants failed to pay employees for the reasonable value of such
services;4 (5) fraud and misrepresentation, as a result of defendants representing that they would
pay wages to their employees in accordance with their legal obligations, but intending to violate
the law by failing to pay such wages;5 (6) money had and received in assumpsit, because
defendants have retained benefits by not compensating plaintiffs for work performed;6 (7)
failure to keep accurate records, because defendants failed to accurately record and maintain all
compensable work performed by plaintiffs;7 and (8) estoppel, due to defendants telling plaintiffs
that they did not have to be paid for time deducted pursuant to the Break Deduction Policy and
concealing from plaintiffs their rights.8
Because plaintiffs have set forth plausible allegations in their complaint for each cause of
action, defendants’ motion to dismiss is due to be denied.
I.

PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT PROVIDES SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO MEET THE
APPLICABLE PLEADING STANDARDS
Defendants seem to suggest that the filing of similar lawsuits in other states by plaintiffs’

counsel provides a basis for dismissal. Setting aside that similar factual pleadings are not
grounds for dismissal, defense counsel ignores their own admission, in its Health Care Update
newsletter, that “many health care employers use electronic time and attendance systems that
make these automatic deductions and it is not uncommon for health care employees to forego
meal periods.” See Affirmation of Jody Newman, sworn to December 18, 2009 (“Newman
Aff.”), attached as Exhibit A, Seyfarth Shaw LLP’s “Health Care Update” at 5 (April 2009).
Defendants further advise health care employers of the “need to take steps to ensure that they are
in full compliance with all wage and hour laws.” Id. Of course, given that the same policies are

in effect throughout the health care industry, the pleadings would be similar in such cases.
A.

MOTIONS TO DISMISS ARE RARELY GRANTED

Plaintiffs’ complaint states valid claims against the defendants for violations of
Massachusetts’ statutory and common law and dismissal is not warranted. In order to survive a
motion to dismiss, a complaint must merely plausibly suggest the conclusion that defendants
violated the law. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554-556 (2007) (holding
that to state a claim of conspiracy under the Sherman Act, complaint must contain “enough
factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made”). A complaint need not
contain “detailed factual allegations” but must “give the defendant fair notice of what the …
claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Id. at 555 (citation omitted). All that plaintiffs
must do in the complaint is state legally feasible claims—which they have clearly done. See
Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2001)
(“The purpose of a motion to dismiss ‘is to determine whether the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.’”) (quoting Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d
12, 17 (1st Cir.1998)).
Rather, the “factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the
speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if
doubtful in fact).”

Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554 (internal citations and emphasis omitted).

Plaintiffs are merely required to “nudge[] their claim across the line from conceivable to
plausible.” Id. at 570. Accordingly, prior to discovery, dismissal of a complaint is premature.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Statutory Wage Claims are Sufficiently Plead

Defendants argue that plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead their state statutory
claims to meet the low standard set by Twombly. However, plaintiffs have plead sufficient detail
“to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id.
Defendants correctly state that in order “[t]o succeed on a claim under the Wage Act
(Count I), Plaintiffs must show that BMC failed to pay for all hours worked, and to succeed
-3-

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 5 of 40

under the Minimum Wage Law (Count II), Plaintiffs must show that they worked more than
forty hours per week and did not receive overtime pay.” See Defendants’ Memorandum in
Support of Motion to Dismiss (“Memo in Support”) at 8. Thereafter, however, defendants stray
from the pleading standard by suggesting plaintiffs are required to plead facts that would far
exceed plaintiffs’ low burden at this state of litigation. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554 (plaintiffs
are merely required to “give the defendant fair notice of what the … claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests.”) (internal citations omitted).
In support of their argument, defendants rely on two cases easily distinguishable from the
present case. First, defendants cite Zhong v. August Corp., to suggest that the complaint must
allege facts such as the approximate number of hours worked but not paid. See Memo in Support
at 8 (quoting Zhong, 498 F. Supp. 2d 625, 630 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)). However, in Zhong, the
complaint was dismissed because the plaintiff failed to provide this information coupled with a
fatal “internal conflict” in his complaint. Zhong, 498 F. Supp. 2d at 630. Zhong had alleged that
his regular work schedule added up to only twenty hours per week, and therefore, the court found
the plaintiff could not possibly meet his burden of alleging failure to pay overtime. Id; see also
Gordon v. Kaleida Health, N. 08-CV-378S, 2008 WL 5114217, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008)
(rejecting defendants’ reliance on Zhong to support their argument that plaintiffs had failed to
sufficiently plead federal and state claims for failure to pay wages and overtime owed).
The other case relied on by defendants, Bailey v. Border Foods, Inc., is also
distinguishable because it is a case for failure to pay minimum wage, not unpaid wages and
overtime. No. 09-1230, 2009 WL 3248305 (D. Minn. Oct. 6, 2009). In Bailey, the court held
that the plaintiffs’ failure to include the numbers of hours worked, as well as their rate of pay,
was a fatal flaw because the court was unable to determine if the plaintiffs’ hourly wage fell
below the statutory minimum wage. Id. at *2. Therefore, the claim was dismissed because the
complaint failed to state a claim for violation of minimum wage. Id.
However, in Gordon v. Kaleida Health, a case nearly identical to here, the court held that
-4-

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 6 of 40

the plaintiffs sufficiently plead their state and federal overtime and unpaid wages claims because
the plaintiffs “explicitly allege[d] that they worked more than 40 hours per week.” 2008 WL
5114217, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008). The court also noted that the “Plaintiffs d[id] not
allege a variety of individual, isolated instances where they stayed late, but rather contend[ed]
that three sustained policies, which were executed over a specific period of time, denied them
overtime compensation.” Id.

Additionally, plaintiffs’ allegations in the complaint did not

“contain a fatal contradiction between their legal claim and their pleadings,” like that in Zhong,
and plaintiffs identified three “specific employment practice[s] giving rise to their claim.” Id.
Accordingly, the court held that plaintiffs satisfied the pleading obligations for alleging an
unpaid wages and overtime wage claims.
Similarly, the court in Acho v. Cort, held that pleading requirements to state a claim for
an alleged FLSA violation are “simple and straightforward.”

No. C 09-00157, 2009 WL

3562472, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 27, 2009). “In order to plead sufficient facts [under the FLSA],
the plaintiff must indicate facts supporting the following: (1) defendant was plaintiff’s employer;
(2) plaintiff worked more than forty hours in a week; and (3) plaintiff did not receive
compensation for his employment in excess of the forty hours.” Id. Additionally, the court held
that a plaintiff is not required to “plead specific instances of unpaid overtime before being
allowed to proceed to discovery” because it is the employer who is obligated to maintain such
employment records containing the information. Id. at *3.
Plaintiffs have clearly met the pleading requirements set forth in Acho.

Despite

defendants’ contention to the contrary, plaintiffs have identified that they and class members
were employed by defendants. See Complaint ¶¶ 1, 13, 61, 66. Likewise, plaintiffs have
sufficiently plead that defendants failed to pay them for all hours worked, thus putting
defendants on notice of their Wage Act claims. See Complaint ¶¶ 63, 72, 89, 94, 98, 102, 111.
Further, plaintiffs have sufficiently plead that they worked more than forty hours in a week and
that defendants failed to pay them at premium rates. See Complaint ¶¶ 63, 91, 95, 99, 111.
-5-

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Page 7 of 40

These allegations alone are enough to put defendants on “fair notice” of the claims
brought against them as required by Twombly. However, like the plaintiffs in Gordon, plaintiffs
went further, and alleged in their complaint the existence of “three sustained policies” which
denied plaintiffs of compensation, including premium pay. See Complaint ¶¶ 72, 73-92 (“Meal
Break Deduction Policy”), 93-96 (“Unpaid Preliminary and Postliminary Work Policy”), 97-101
(“Unpaid Training Policy”).
Therefore, defendants cannot claim that plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient notice
because plaintiffs have provided more than sufficient detail to “nudge[] their claims across the
line from conceivable to plausible.” See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. Accordingly, defendants’
motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ statutory claims should be dismissed.9
9

Defendants also argue that plaintiffs’ have failed to plead a plausible claim for failure to
keep accurate records because they have not plead that records were ever requested, or
that defendants failed or refused to produce such records. See Memo in Support at 10 n.
16. However, plaintiffs’ claims arise out of defendants’ failure to keep accurate records,
not their failure to produce them. It is well recognized in Massachusetts that a statutory
duty creates a duty of care toward the class of persons that the statute is designed to
protect. Gabriel v. Borowy, 85 N.E.2d 435, 439 (Mass. 1949) (“Where a statutory right is
conferred upon a class of individuals as distinguished from the public at large, but no
remedy is provided by the statute for the enforcement of that right, the right may be
asserted by any appropriate common law remedy that is available.”). Thus, when a
plaintiff suffers damages as a result of a defendant’s violation of such a statute, the
plaintiff may recover even if the statute itself does not include a private cause of action.
See, e.g., Ludlow Educ. Ass’n v. Town of Ludlow, 644 N.E.2d 227, 231 (Mass. App. Ct.
1991) (allowing plaintiffs to recover for the violation of a statute even though the statute
itself did not create any private right of action); Molinari v. Royal Heights Const. Co.,
No. 934424, 1998 WL 1181667, at *4 (Mass. Super. Sep. 8, 1998) (finding that
negligence is “an appropriate common law remedy” to recover for injuries caused by
violating a regulation). Otherwise the protections of the statute “would be useless and
illusory.” Gabriel, 85 N.E.2d at 439. It is undisputed that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 15
places a statutory duty upon employers to keep and maintain records of all their
employees’ hours worked. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 15 (“Every employer shall keep a
true and accurate record . . . of the hours worked each day and each week by each
employee . . .”); see also Wiedman v. Bradford Group, 831 N.E.2d 304, 309 (Mass.
2005). This statute protects employees by ensuring that they are paid for all the hours
they work, and by providing evidence they can use to prove a claim for unpaid wages.
Weidman, 831 N.E.2d at 309-311. Here, plaintiffs’ have clearly alleged that Defendants
violated the statute, Complaint ¶¶ 156, that they thus breached their duty toward
Plaintiffs, id. ¶ 193, and that Plaintiffs suffered damages and a direct and proximate cause

Plaintiffs’ Contract Claims are Sufficiently Plead

Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to allege claims
for breach of contract. Again, plaintiffs have provided sufficient detail in the complaint to put
defendants on notice of the claims for breach of contract.
As defendants acknowledge, to state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege
the existence of a contract, that defendants breached their duties under the contract, and that the
breach caused the plaintiffs’ damage. Moghaddam v. Dunkin’ Donuts, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 136,
139 (D. Mass. 2003) (internal quotations omitted); see also Guckenberger v. Boston Univ., 957
F. Supp. 306, 316 (D. Mass. 1997). Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient detail to meet this standard.
First, plaintiffs have clearly alleged the existence of a contract in the complaint, as well as the
purpose and terms of the contract.10 Second, plaintiffs clearly identified that “defendants and
Plaintiffs and Class Members entered into a contract for employment.”11 See Complaint ¶ 106.
Third, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged defendants’ breach under the contract. As
previously stated, defendants’ duties under the contract were to pay plaintiffs for the wages
agreed upon, and legally required, in exchange for all time worked by plaintiffs. See Complaint

10

11

of Defendants failure to maintain records, id. ¶ 194, see also id. ¶ 102. They have thus
stated a cause of action for negligence based on Defendants’ breach of their duty to
maintain accurate records of the hours their employees worked.
See Complaint ¶ 106 (“By entering into an employment relationship, defendants and
Plaintiffs and Class Members entered into a contract for employment, including implied
contracts and express contracts.”) (emphasis added); ¶ 107 (the agreement was
“explicitly intended to order and govern the employment relationship.”); ¶ 109 (the terms
included that “defendants promised to compensate Plaintiffs and Class Members for ‘all
hours worked’ during their employment period.”); see also id. ¶ 108 (“This binding
express contract provided that Plaintiffs and Class Members would provide services and
labor to defendants in return for compensation under the provisions of the contract.”); ¶
110 (“defendants’ express contract with Plaintiffs and Class Members embodied all
binding legal requirements concerning the payment of such wages to the Plaintiffs and
Class Members that were in force at the time of that contract”); ¶ 116 (“defendants
contracted to hire Plaintiffs and Class Members at a set rate of pay, with a set work
schedule for a particular position, under set terms of employment”).
The complaint further defines “defendants” as “the Named Defendants, the Health
Centers, and the Affiliates.” Id. ¶ 7. Likewise, “Plaintiffs” and “Class Members” have
also been defined in the complaint. Id. ¶¶ 60-61.

¶¶ 108, 109, 110. Defendants “breached the express and/or implied contract terms by failing to
pay Class Members for all of the time Class Members worked … including applicable premium
pay.” See id. ¶ 120; see also ¶ 111 (“Plaintiffs and Class Members regularly worked hours both
under and in excess of forty per week and were not paid for all of those hours.”). Further,
plaintiffs specify the time worked for which defendants failed to compensate plaintiffs. See id. ¶
112 (“The defendants failed to pay for time that Plaintiffs and Class Members worked, including,
but not limited to, during their meal breaks, time that Plaintiffs and Class Members spent in
required, job-related training, and time that Plaintiffs and Class Members spent before and after
their regular work hours performing work-related tasks.”).
Finally, plaintiffs sufficiently allege that because of defendants’ breach, plaintiffs
suffered damages. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that “[a]s a result of defendants’ breach of
express and implied contracts, Plaintiffs and Class Members have been harmed and as a direct
and proximate result have suffered damages including all amounts they should have been paid
for all time worked including applicable premium pay.” See Complaint ¶ 120; see also ¶ 113
(“defendants have received financial gain at the expense of Plaintiffs and Class Members”)
(emphasis added). Defendants, in their Memo in Support, have conveniently left out the factual
allegations providing them with “fair notice” of the claims for breach of contract, along with the
grounds upon which those claims rest.12 Because plaintiffs have met the burden under Twombly,
defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ breach of contract claims should be denied.
D.

Plaintiffs’ Fraud and Conversions Claims Sufficiently Plead the Necessary
State of Mind

In order to state a claim for conversion, plaintiffs must allege that defendants “did some
positive wrongful act with the intention to appropriate the property to himself.” Kelley v.

12

Plaintiffs have also provided sufficient details to support their claims for breach of
implied contracts, including the terms of the implied contract, the duties of both parties
under the implied contract, defendants’ breach of the implied contract, and the damages
suffered by plaintiffs because of defendants’ breach of the implied contract. See
Complaint ¶¶ 115-120.

LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotations omitted). Similarly, to plead fraud,
plaintiffs must show that defendants “knowingly made a false statement of material fact ...”
Chan v. Chen, 872 N.E.2d 1153, 1157 (Mass. App. Ct. 2007) (internal citations omitted).
Plaintiffs have met their burden under Twombly in regards to the necessary state of mind for both
conversion and fraud.
In their complaint, plaintiffs allege throughout that defendants, in their dealings with
plaintiffs, knowingly and intentionally reaped benefits by failing to compensate plaintiffs for all
time worked.13 In fact, plaintiffs specified that there was not even a reasonable basis that
defendants could believe that they did not intend to defraud or convert plaintiffs’ wages because
“defendants had a continuing policy and practice of failing to pay their employees for all
compensable time, including applicable premium pay.”14 See Complaint ¶ 154.
Additionally, plaintiffs sufficiently plead that defendants’ agents had the requisite state of

13

14

See Complaint ¶ 82 (“Defendants know that Plaintiffs and Class Members perform work
during their meal breaks.”) (emphasis added); ¶ 86 (“the defendants affirmatively stated
that the employees could not be paid for such time, even though defendants knew such
time was compensable”) (emphasis added); ¶ 87 (“defendants’ management knew that …
Plaintiffs and Class Members had to work through their meal breaks even during times
they were not paid”) (emphasis added); ¶ 88 (“Even though defendants know its
employees are performing such work, defendants fail to compensate”) (emphasis added);
¶ 128 (“defendants knowingly, unlawfully and intentionally took, appropriated and
converted…”) (emphasis added); ¶ 134 (“Defendants had an appreciation or knowledge
of the benefit conferred by these Plaintiffs and Class Members”) (emphasis added); ¶ 143
(defendants “deliberately concealed from its employees that they did not receive
compensation for all compensable time”) (emphasis added); ¶ 145 (“defendants
deliberately misrepresented to Plaintiffs and Class Members that they were being
properly paid for compensable time”) (emphasis added); ¶ 148 (“Defendants intended
for Plaintiffs and Class Members to rely upon defendants’ misrepresentation that they
would be paid for all compensable time”) (emphasis added); ¶ 149 (“Defendants … at all
times intended to violate applicable Massachusetts laws by failing to pay Plaintiffs and
Class Members for all compensable time”) (emphasis added).
Despite defendants’ assertions to the contrary, this allegation also supports that at the
time defendants made the false statements to plaintiffs, defendants did not intend to carry
out the promise because they had a continuing practice and policy of not paying
employees for all time worked. See Complaint ¶ 148; see also ¶¶ 149, 154.

Further, plaintiffs specifically allege that the individual defendants are “actively

involved in the creation of the illegal policies complained of in this case” and “actively
participate[] in the violations complained of in this action.” See Complaint ¶¶ 35, 58. Plaintiffs
also specify that defendants’ management had the requisite knowledge for fraud and conversion.
See Complaint at ¶¶ 84, 85, 86, 87, 134.
Again, plaintiffs have met the Twombly pleading standard, therefore their claims for fraud
and conversion should not be dismissed.16
15

16

Defendants purport that plaintiffs have made no factual allegations about “any
identifiable person’s requisite state of mind.” See Memo in Support at 12. However,
defendants, once again seem to forget that throughout the complaint, “defendants” refers
to all Named Defendants, which includes two individuals, as well as the Health Centers
and the Affiliates. See Complaint ¶ 7.
Once again, defendants assert a completely separate argument concerning one of
plaintiffs’ claims in a footnote, arguing that plaintiffs’ conversion claim cannot succeed
because it seeks to recover money. See Defendants’ Memo in Support at 12 n.20.
However, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held almost a century ago, and
confirmed as recently as two years ago that “[m]oney may be the subject of conversion.”
In re Hilson, 863 N.E.2d 483, 491 (Mass. 2007) (citing Morring v. Manning, 91 N.E.
308, 309 (Mass. 1910)). Defendants cite Gossels v. Fleet National Bank, 902 N.E.2d 370
(Mass. 2009) for the proposition that a debt cannot be converted. That proposition,
however, is not on point in this case. Gossels was a check cashing dispute where a bank
failed to pay an account holder. Because a bank account creates an ordinary creditordebtor relationship, an account holder is entitled only to “a corresponding sum” rather
than to a “specific fund.” See Freeman’s Nat’l Bank v. Nat’l Tube-Works, Inc., 24 N.E.
779, 780 (Mass. 1890). For this reason, the court held that money from a bank account
cannot be converted. Gossels, 902 N.E.2d at 378. The employment relationship, by
contrast, is not an ordinary debtor-creditor relationship. Under Massachusetts law, an
employee’s earned wages belong unconditionally to the employee, and unlike an ordinary
debt, a failure to pay wages carries both civil and criminal penalties. See Mass. Gen.
Laws ch. 149, § 148 (providing that employers must pay all earned wages to the
employee within six days of the end of the pay period in which they are earned). The
policy behind these provisions is “to protect wage earners from the long-term detention
of wages by unscrupulous employers.” Cumpata v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 113 F.
Supp. 2d 164, 167 (D. Mass. 2000). The fact that an employee’s right to his wages is
unwaivable is further evidence of Massachusetts’ strong policy to protect wage earners.
See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148 (“No person shall by a special contract with an
employee or by any other means exempt himself from this section.”). This policy reflects
the fact that wages are not an ordinary debt like a bank account. Rather, once wages are
earned, the amount earned is a “specific fund” that belongs to the employee and can be
recovered in conversion. Accord Doo Nam Young v. ACBL Corp., 427 F. Supp.2d 327,

Plaintiffs’ Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims are Plead with
Enough Detail to Meet the Heightened Pleading Standard under Rule 9

Defendants also claim that the plaintiffs’ fraud and misrepresentation claims are not plead
with sufficient particularity to meet the heightened requirement of Rule 9(b).
Although Rule 9(b) requires that the claim must be pled “with sufficient particularity,”
“Rule 9(b) … is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), … which provides for a ‘short and plain
statement of the claim.’” Howard v. Cycare Sys., Inc., 128 F.R.D. 159, 164 (D. Mass. 1989); see
Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); see also Zahn v. Yucaipa Capital Fund, 218 B.R.
656, 673 (D.R.I. 1998) (“Rule 9(b) … does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, it must be read in
harmony with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, which requires only a short and plain statement of the claim
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”) (internal citations omitted).
The “plaintiff’s burden of proof does not require him to prove his case in the Complaint.”
Zahn, 218 B.R. at 674. “There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in
order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific
misrepresentation was repeated.” Howard, 128 F.R.D. at 164. Rather, the plaintiff “need only
set forth allegations of fact sufficient to place defendants on notice of the claims against them,
allow them to prepare a defense, and allay any concerns about reckless allegations of fraud.”
Zahn, 218 B.R. at 674. (internal citations omitted). And though plaintiffs are required to state
the circumstances constituting fraud with particularity, “malice, intent, knowledge, and other
conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).

May 9, 2005) (finding that plaintiffs proved the elements of conversion based on a claim
for unpaid wages), aff’d on other grounds 902 A.2d 30 (Conn. App. 2005); Giles v. Gen.
Motors Corp., 802 N.E.2d 858, 866 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003) (reversing dismissal of a
conversion claim based on unlawfully withheld wages). Consistent with this
understanding, no Massachusetts court has ever held that wages cannot be converted.
They have thus failed to carry their burden and their motion must be denied on this
ground as well.

Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not plead their fraud claim with sufficient
particularity. As stated above, to state a cause of action for fraud, a plaintiff must show that “the
defendant has knowingly made a false statement of material fact, intending that the plaintiff rely
thereon, and upon which the plaintiff did rely.” Chan, 872 N.E.2d at 1157 (internal citations
omitted).
Defendants contend that plaintiffs have failed to identify the specific content of the
misrepresentation, as well as the speaker, the specific time and place that the misrepresentations
were made. Defendants’ Memo in Support at 13. Defendants are plainly mistaken. Plaintiffs
identified the fraudulent scheme defendants engaged in to conceal the truth from plaintiffs. See
Complaint ¶ 88 (“Even though defendants know its employees are performing such work,
defendants fail to compensate their employees for such work.”). The Complaint further alleges
that defendants “at all times intended to violate applicable Massachusetts laws by failing to pay
Plaintiffs and Class Members for all compensable time, including applicable premium pay.” See
Complaint ¶ 149. Defendants “deliberately concealed from its employees that they did not
receive compensation for all compensable time and misled them into believing they were being
paid properly.” See Complaint ¶ 143. They then, “by maintaining and propagating the illegal
policies, deliberately misrepresented to Plaintiffs and Class Members that they were being
properly paid for compensable time, even though Plaintiffs were not receiving pay for all
compensable time.” See Complaint ¶ 145; see also Complaint ¶¶ 141-142, 148, 150, 154. Thus,
by identifying and recounting defendants’ scheme, defendants are sufficiently informed of
plaintiffs’ claims and therefore fully able to prepare their defense.
In addition, plaintiffs specifically identified the statements made to them by defendants.
See Complaint ¶ 86 (“When questioned by employees about the Meal Break Deduction Policy,
the defendants affirmatively stated that the employees could not be paid for such time, even
though defendants knew such time was compensable.”).

Defendants made further

misrepresentations to employees “through their corporate publications and through statements of

their agents” that “wages would be paid legally and in accordance with defendants’ obligations
pursuant to applicable Massachusetts laws.” See Complaint ¶ 146. Further, plaintiffs identify
individually liable defendants

likely to

have been involved with the fraud and

misrepresentations. See Complaint ¶¶ 14-36, 37-59.
Finally, courts do not require plaintiffs to fully allege every instance that was part of
defendants’ fraudulent scheme, thus plaintiffs are not required to plead every instance of
fraudulent conduct in the Complaint. See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig.,
478 F. Supp.2d 164, 171-72 (D. Mass. 2007) (“an alleged scheme of fraud may involve
numerous transactions that occur over a long period of time, and pleading the precise specifics
with regard to every instance of fraudulent conduct may be impractical”) (internal citations
omitted); Howard, 128 F.R.D. at 164 (“There would be no harmony between the two rules if a
plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific
misrepresentation was repeated. Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the
plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation … none
of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with
Rule 9(b)”). Therefore, plaintiffs have met the heightened pleading requirement for their fraud
and misrepresentation claims.
F.

Plaintiffs’ Misrepresentation and Estoppel Claims Sufficiently Plead and
Identify the Relied Upon Promise

Similarly, plaintiffs’ claims for misrepresentation and estoppel provide sufficient detail
and identify the relied upon promises made by defendants. In arguing that plaintiffs have failed
to sufficiently plead the existence and reliance of representations and promises made by
defendants, defendants seem to have made no effort to read the complaint in its entirety, and
provide the Court with an inaccurate depiction of plaintiffs’ complaint. See Defendants’ Memo
in Support at 14-15.
However, plaintiffs have alleged that defendants “made clear definite promises to
Plaintiffs and Class Members that they would be paid for all hours worked including applicable

premium pay in accordance with the applicable Massachusetts laws.” See Complaint ¶ 124. To
wit, “when defendants hired Plaintiffs and Class Members, they represented to Plaintiffs and
Class Members that they would be fully compensated for all services performed.” See id. ¶ 151.
Further, plaintiffs specifically allege that “[t]hrough the paystubs and payroll information it
provided employees, [defendants] deliberately concealed from its employees that they did not
receive compensation for all compensable time and misled them into believing they were being
paid properly.” See id. ¶ 143. Plaintiffs also allege, with specificity, that defendants made
further representations through their “corporate publications and through statements of their
agents,” as well as in their “employee manuals and policy manuals” that plaintiffs would be paid
legally and for all hours worked to the benefit of defendants. See id. ¶¶ 146, 147. Likewise,
plaintiffs have provided sufficient detail that plaintiffs not only relied on, but reasonably relied
on the representations and promises made by defendants.17
Therefore, plaintiffs have once again plead the facts necessary to sufficiently allege
claims for misrepresentation, equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel.
G.

Plaintiffs’ Money Had and Received and Quantum Meruit Claims are
Sufficiently Plead

Plaintiffs’ claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received are also sufficiently
plead under the Twombly standard. For their unjust enrichment claims, plaintiffs must show that
the defendant has been “unjustly enriched” resulting in “unjust detriment” to the plaintiff.

17

See also Complaint at ¶¶ 125 (“Plaintiffs and Class Members relied on this promise.
Without such a promise of being paid for all hours worked, Plaintiffs and Class Members
would not have worked for [defendants].”), 126 (“Plaintiffs and Class Members acted to
their substantial detriment in reasonable reliance on defendants’ promise to pay them for
wages and benefits earned.”), 132 (“Plaintiffs and Class Members provided their services
with the reasonable expectation of receiving compensation from the defendants.”), 150
(“Plaintiffs and Class Members justifiably relied on the misrepresentations in agreeing to
accept and continue employment with defendants. This reliance was reasonable …”),
154 (“Plaintiffs and Class Members relied upon defendants’ representation by performing
work and services for defendants. This reliance was reasonable, as Plaintiffs and Class
Members had every right to believe that defendants would abide by their obligations to
pay for all hours worked…”).

Salamon v. Terra, 477 N.E.2d 1029, 1031 (Mass. 1985). Similarly, to state a claim for money
had and received in assumpsit, plaintiffs must show that that the defendant has money “which
should not in justice be retained by the defendant, and which in equity and good conscience
should be paid to the plaintiff.” Cobb v. Library Bureau, 167 N.E. 765, 767 (Mass. 1929).
Plaintiffs have provided sufficient detail in their complaint to put defendants on fair
notice of both of these claims. For example, plaintiffs allege that defendants “have received
financial gain at the expense of Plaintiffs and Class Members” because of defendants failure to
pay plaintiffs for all time worked, and that defendants “received that financial gain under such
circumstances that in equity and good conscience Defendants ought not to be allowed to profit at
the expense of Plaintiffs and Class Members.” See Complaint ¶¶ 135, 136. Further, defendants
“failed to act in good faith by failing to pay for all the hours worked including applicable
premium pay, which has unjustly enriched defendants to the detriment of Plaintiffs and Class
Members.”

See id. ¶ 138; see also ¶ 139.

Plaintiffs clearly alleged the circumstances

surrounding their claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received, namely that by
failing to pay plaintiffs for all hours worked, defendants retained a financial benefit while
plaintiffs suffered damages as a result. See id. ¶¶ 135-140.
Therefore, their claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received meet the
pleading standards set forth in Twombly.18
H.

Plaintiffs’ Claims Against the Individual Defendants are Sufficiently Plead

Plaintiffs have also plausibly suggested that the individual defendants, Elaine Ullian and
James Canavan are liable as employers.

Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the individuals

committed acts that demonstrate an individual’s employer status under Massachusetts state law.
See Complaint ¶¶ 14-59. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148 provides that “[t]he president and
treasurer of a corporation and any officers or agents having the management of such corporation

In response to defendants’ footnote argument that implied contract claim cannot be
brought where an express contract exists, plaintiffs allege these claims in the alternative.

shall be deemed to be the employers of the employees of the corporation within the meaning of
this section.” See also Wiedmann v. Bradford Group, Inc., 444 Mass. 698, 711 (2005) (finding
that “someone who controls, directs, and participates to a substantial degree in formulating and
determining policy of a corporation” can be held liable as an employer under the statute).
As an initial matter, Ms. Ullian is liable under the statute as an employer by virtue of her
job title – President. In addition, both Ms. Ullian and Mr. Canavan are liable due to their
involvement in “formulating and determining policy” of defendants’ day to day business
including the violations at issue in this case.
In Gordon v. Kaleida, the court held that plaintiffs sufficiently plead that the named
individuals had the authority to possibly be held liable as employers. 19 2008 WL 5114217 at *4.
The plaintiffs alleged that the individual defendants had “the authority to make decisions
concerning defendants’ operations, including functions related to employment human resources,
training, payroll, and benefits.”

Id. (internal citations omitted).

The court held that this

allegation, coupled with other allegations concerning the individuals’ authority, satisfied the
notice pleading requirements of Rule 8. Id.
Here, the plaintiffs have plead similar allegations to those plead in Gordon to support
their claims against Ms. Ullian and Mr. Canavan. For example, plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that
Ms. Ullian and Mr. Canavan have the authority to make decisions concerning defendants’
operations, including functions related to employment human resources, training, payroll and
benefits (Complaint ¶¶ 17, 24, 28, 29, 34, 38, 45, 50, 57); have the authority to make decisions
concerning and/or are actively involved in the review and counsel of defendants regarding
employment decisions, including the power to hire and fire employees (Complaint ¶¶ 21, 30, 42,
53); have the authority to make decisions concerning and/or actively involved in setting
employees’ schedules, hours, pay and benefits (Complaint ¶¶ 22, 23, 43, 44); supervise and

determine the rate and method of employees’ payment (Complaint ¶¶ 32, 55); have the authority

employment and human resources records, including maintaining such records (Complaint ¶¶ 25,
29, 34, 46, 50, 56); and have the authority to make decisions concerning and/or are actively
involved in training (Complaint ¶¶ 26, 27, 47, 48).
Further, plaintiffs allege that Ms. Ullian and Mr. Canavan were involved in the creation
and enforcement of the illegal policies complained of in this case as well as ensuring defendants’
compliance or non-compliance with state law. (Complaint ¶¶ 18-20, 35, 39-41, 58).
Therefore, as the complaint plausibly suggests that the individuals committed these acts,
and others, and to the extent Ms. Ullian is also liable by virtue of her position, plaintiffs have
stated valid causes of action under the Massachusetts statutory and common laws against the
individual defendants as employers. (Complaint ¶¶ 36, 59).
II.

PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS ARE NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL
LABOR LAW
The United States Supreme Court has been clear that § 301 preemption is a narrow

doctrine “that should not be lightly inferred.” Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S.
399, 412 (1988) (quoting Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 21 (1987)); Burnside v.
Kiewit Pac. Corp., 491 F.3d 1053, 1070 (9th Cir. 2007) (“After all, the Supreme Court has
termed section 301 preemption but an ‘acorn,’ not a ‘mighty oak.’”) (citing Livadas v. Bradshaw,
512 U.S. 107, 122 (1994)).
Section 301 preemption serves one limited purpose: to allow federal courts to develop
their own interpretation of ambiguous contract terms, as opposed to having each state court
develop its own method of resolving these ambiguous terms. Thus, “if the resolution of a statelaw claim depends upon the meaning of a collective-bargaining agreement, the application of
state law … is pre-empted and federal labor-law principles-necessarily uniform throughout the
Nation-must be employed to resolve the dispute.” Lingle, 486 U.S. at 405-06. Therefore, the
- 17 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 19 of 40

only circumstances which require preemption is when interpretation of the CBA is necessary. 29
U.S.C. § 185(a); see generally Lingle, 486 U.S. at 403-06; Lydon v. Boston Sand & Gravel Co.,
175 F.3d 6, 10-12 (1st Cir. 1999).
Further, preemption is not required even if the court will be referring to and applying the
CBA to resolve the state law claim. See Livadas, 512 U.S. at 124 (citing Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413,
n. 12) (“We were clear [in Lingle] that when the meaning of contract terms is not the subject of
dispute, the bare fact that a collective bargaining agreement will be consulted in the court of
state-law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished.”). Therefore, mere
referral to or consultation of the CBA is not enough to invoke preemption. Lydon, 175 F.3d at
10 (quoting Lingle, 486 U.S. at 409-10). Courts must “locate the line between the need for mere
consultation of a CBA, which does not demand federal preemption, and more active
interpretation of that agreement, which does preempt the state law claims.” Id.
Additionally, preemption does not arise when the claim asserted derives from the
substantive provisions of state law. “§ 301 cannot be read broadly to pre-empt nonnegotiable
rights conferred on individual employees as a matter of state law,” rather “it is the legal character
of a claim, as ‘independent’ of rights under the collective-bargaining agreement, that decides
whether a state cause of action may go forward.” Livadas, 512 U.S. at 123 (internal citations
omitted).
Even if resolution of the state law issue involves analysis of the same issues as would be
required to determine if there was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, such
“parallelism” does not invoke preemption of the state law. Lingle, 486 U.S. at 408. Nor do
defenses based on the collective bargaining agreement create preemption. See Burnside, 491
F.3d at 1059 (“The [Supreme] Court also has made clear that reliance on the CBA as an aspect of
a defense is not enough to ‘inject[ ] a federal question into an action that asserts what is plainly a
state-law claim.’”) (citing Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 398-99). Further, looking to the CBA for
information regarding damages, such as rate of pay, does not warrant preemption. Lingle, 486
- 18 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Page 20 of 40

U.S. at 413, n. 12 (“A collective-bargaining agreement may, of course, contain information such
as rate of pay and other economic benefits that might be helpful in determining the damages to
which a worker prevailing in a state-law suit is entitled”).
Rather the state law claims must be substantially dependent on the resolution and
interpretation of terms of a CBA for preemption to apply. See Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482
U.S. 386, 394 (1987); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 220 (1985); Lingle, 486 U.S.
at 405-06. The Supreme Court has held that “an application of state law is pre-empted by § 301
of the [LMRA] only if such application requires the interpretation of a collective-bargaining
agreement.” Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 (emphasis added). “As long as the state-law claim can be
resolved without interpreting the agreement itself, the claim is ‘independent’ of the agreement
for § 301 pre-emption purposes.” Butler v. Verizon New Eng., Inc., 861 N.E.2d 794, 799
(Mass.App.Ct. 2007) (quoting Lingle, 486 U.S. at 409-410).
Here, plaintiffs’ state law claims are exactly those non-negotiable rights provided to
individuals in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to protect their substantive rights. Further,
interpretation of the CBA is not required to determine whether defendants failed to provide
plaintiffs with all compensation owed pursuant to state statutory and common laws. As a result,
plaintiffs’ claims are not preempted by the LMRA, and should not be dismissed.
A.

Claims Under Massachusetts Payment of Wages Act and Massachusetts Fair
Minimum Wage Act Do Not Require the Interpretation of the CBA, and
therefore, Are Not Preempt by § 301 of the LMRA

Thus, in order to meet this preemption standard, the defendants must show that plaintiffs’
claims rise or fall based on the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and are not based on
the substantive, independent violations of state law.
In a case on all fours with the present action, the Supreme Court has held that state wage
payment statutes are not preempted, even when the state wage payment claim is based on the
failure to pay wages under the CBA. See Livadas, 512 U.S. at 111-13. The Supreme Court
unanimously rejected defendants’ preemption argument and held that state wage payment
- 19 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 21 of 40

statutes are not preempted by a CBA, and can be used to enforce wages due under a CBA
(except in the rare case that there is a genuinely disputed ambiguous terms in the CBA relevant
to the claim). Id. at 125.
The Supreme Court held that there was not “even a colorable argument that a claim under
[a state’s general wage payment statute] was pre-empted” in enforcing wages due under the
CBA, Id. at 124, and that it “is clear beyond peradventure” that preemption cannot displace state
wage payment statues. Id. at 14 n.18. Held the Supreme Court,
As the District Court aptly observed, the primary text for deciding whether
Livadas was entitled to a penalty was not the Food Store Contract, but a
calendar. The only issue raised by Livadas's claim, whether Safeway “willfully
fail[ed] to pay” her wages promptly upon severance, Cal.Lab.Code Ann. § 203
(West 1989), was a question of state law, entirely independent of any
understanding embodied in the collective-bargaining agreement between the
union and the employer. There is no indication that there was a “dispute” in this
case over the amount of the penalty to which Livadas would be entitled, and
Lingle makes plain in so many words that when liability is governed by
independent state law, the mere need to “look to” the collective-bargaining
agreement for damages computation is no reason to hold the state-law claim
defeated by § 301. Beyond the simple need to refer to bargained-for wage rates
in computing the penalty, the collective-bargaining agreement is irrelevant to the
dispute (if any) between Livadas and Safeway.
Id. at 14 (citing Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 n. 12).
Accordingly, courts have followed that state statutes governing wage and hour are not
preempted by the LMRA § 301 because generally the statutes are substantive protections that are
not influenced by what a collective bargaining agreement provides. See Self v. United Parcel
Serv., Inc., 126 N.M. 396, 403 (1998) (unpaid wage claims were not preempted because they
were based on non-negotiable state law rights); Rawson v. Tosco Ref. Co., No. 95-3904, 1996
WL 33991 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 24, 1996) (state wage and hour law provisions not preempted by
LMRA even though claim involves terms of collective bargaining agreement); Sellars v.
Safeway, Inc., No. 05-1013, 2006 WL 2729268 (D. Oregon Sept. 22, 2006) (preemption may not
occur when employees are seeking to enforce rights that arise outside of the terms of the CBA).
Here, defendants assert that plaintiffs’ claims depend on an interpretation and application
- 20 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 22 of 40

of the CBAs between defendants and the unions representing some of the plaintiffs. If there
were ambiguous terms in the CBA that were relevant to the outcome of this litigation, then § 301
preemption analysis might apply, but given that plaintiffs’ claims do not arise out of any CBA
and do not require interpretation of any CBA, there can be no preemption.
Moreover, the terms of the CBAs are irrelevant to the plaintiffs’ state statutory claims,
and the complaint does not, and has no need to, rely on the provisions of any CBA to support any
of their state law claims. All plaintiffs seek is to have their wages paid to them as required under
the Massachusetts wage and hour law. If there was no colorable claim to preempt the wage
payment statute in Livadas, there is no colorable basis to do so here.
Plaintiffs’ state law claims do not require consultation of the CBAs because they are
legally premised on the independent legal requirement that an employer pay for all time it suffer
or permits an employee to work, including time during working lunches. These statutory
obligations do not rest on the collective bargaining agreement, and are entirely independent of it.
Defendants provide the Court with a convoluted example, in an attempt to prove the
necessity of interpretation of the CBA:
“[T]he Court need only consider the example of a nurse who was on call on a
holiday after attending meetings as a union representative the previous day,
reported to work in response to a call to work in a different job classification, and
continued working through one or more unscheduled shifts, such that the nurse
was entitled to daily and weekly overtime under the CBA.”
See Defendants’ Memo in Support at 22.
As plaintiffs will show below, interpretation would not be necessary to determine if this
hypothetical nurse, despite the “welter” of circumstances surrounding this one shift, was paid for
all hours worked. Further, because this Court would not need to interpret the CBA in the case of
what defendants must believe is their strongest, though unlikely, example, the Court will not
need to interpret the CBA for any of the plaintiffs and the case should be remanded.
Defendants contend that interpretation will be necessary to determine liability in their
hypothetical due to the mere existence of provisions in the CBA governing pay and time worked.
- 21 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 23 of 40

However, “parallelism” does not invoke preemption of the state law. Lingle, 486 U.S. at 408.
Therefore, the similarities between the CBA provisions and Massachusetts wage and hour laws
do not mandate preemption.
For example, defendants refer to the provisions in the CBA requiring a rest break after an
employee has worked a certain number of hours. See Defendants’ Memo in Support at 20
(internal citations omitted). Additionally, defendants claim that the CBAs generally provide that
the employees will be paid for work performed during their breaks. See Defendants’ Memo in
Support at 20 (internal citation omitted).
However, defendants fail to mention that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149 § 148 mandates that
an employer pay an employee “the wages earned by him,” within a specified number of days
from the end of the pay period. Therefore, any work performed by plaintiffs and class members
must be paid to them whether or not the CBA has a specific provision or not – the CBA has
absolutely nothing to do with whether employees were properly paid under the statute.
Even so, assuming for a moment that in some instances, pursuant to the provision of the
CBA, employees are not paid for certain work performed during scheduled breaks. Defendants
would argue that the CBAs would need to be interpreted in order to determine whether the work
performed during such breaks is compensable work. However, the CBAs cannot be at odds with
state law.

See Livadas, 512 U.S. at 123 (“§ 301 cannot be read broadly to pre-empt

nonnegotiable rights conferred on individual employees as a matter of state law”) (internal
citations omitted). Therefore, the CBAs would not need to be consulted or interpreted because
the obligation to pay employees all wages earned is a nonnegotiable right as a matter of state law
– it does not matter what the CBA says on the issue.
Turning next to the “welter of CBA provisions” governing the rate at which employees
are paid, defendants’ argument again fails as a matter of law. It has been well established by the
Supreme Court that mere reference or even consultation of the CBA does not mandate
preemption. See Livadas, 512 U.S. at 124 (citing Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413, n.12) (“We were clear
- 22 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Page 24 of 40

[in Lingle] that when the meaning of contract terms is not the subject of dispute, the bare fact
that a collective bargaining agreement will be consulted in the court of state-law litigation plainly
does not require the claim to be extinguished.”).
More importantly, “a collective-bargaining agreement may, of course, contain
information such as rate of pay and other economic benefits that might be helpful in determining
the damages to which a worker prevailing in a state-law suit is entitled” without requiring
preemption. Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 n.12 (internal citations omitted).
Take for example, the hypothetical nurse provided by defendants as an example that
would require interpretation of multiple provisions of the CBAs.

This particular nurse,

according to defendants, was on call on a holiday the day after attending meetings as a union
representative. See Defendants’ Memo in Support at 22. She reported to work after receiving a
call, but reported to work in a different job classification, and was required to work through one
or more scheduled shifts. Id. Because of the length of her shift, she was entitled to daily and
weekly overtime under the CBA. Id.
Defendants, hoping to create enough complication to suggest that interpretation “must”
be required, have omitted from their example the only facts actually necessary to determine
whether the nurse is owed damages under Massachusetts statutory wage and hour law – the
number of hours she worked that shift, and whether she was paid for all those hours. Again,
what the CBA says matters not.
Now, consider this version of our hypothetical nurse’s day: The day after attending
meetings as a union representative, a nurse is on call and it is Christmas Day. Sadly, she
receives a call from the hospital asking her to report to work as soon as possible. The nurse
arrives at the hospital at 10:15 am and immediately starts working in a different job classification
than her normal position. Because she was faced with an emergency as soon as she arrived, she
was unable to clock in until 11:00 am. Due to stormy weather and a much anticipated Patriots
home game, the hospital has an increase of patients coming in and the nurse is required to work
- 23 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Page 25 of 40

through two unscheduled shifts. She clocks out to go home at 8:45 pm. She is tired and hungry
because despite the length of her shift she was too busy to take a meal break, let alone grab a bite
of food. However, due to the hospital’s Automatic Meal Break Deduction Policy, the nurse
knew she would have a half hour taken from her hours. As she is leaving the hospital, in comes
a new emergency and she is paged back to the floor before she has even made it out of her
department.

There is no time for her to clock back in, so she goes immediately to the

emergency. Finally, at 10:30 pm, she gets in her car and is able to return home to her family for
the last hour of Christmas Day. Because of the number of hours she worked that day, the nurse
was entitled to both daily and weekly overtime.
The only facts that matter in connection with the nurse’s wage and hour claim pursuant to
Massachusetts statutory law is the information regarding her hours worked and her hours paid,
which defendants conveniently left out of their version of the hypothetical. In this example, the
nurse was only paid for 9.25 hours of work, even though she worked a total of 12.25 hours. It
does not matter at this point what the CBAs say regarding what qualifies as work because Mass.
Gen. Laws 149 § 148 requires employers to pay their employees all wages earned.

Our

hypothetical nurse earned 12.25 hours worth of pay, but was only paid for 9.25 hours.
Therefore, the hospital is liable to the nurse for unpaid wages.
Now that liability has been determined, the next question is how much money the nurse is
owed. However, this is purely a question of damages, and as discussed earlier, does not result in
preemption if the CBAs must be consulted. See Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 n.12. This is also where
all of the factors in our hypothetical imposed by defendants come into play. The fact that the
nurse: (1) was on call; (2) on a holiday; (3) after attending meetings as a union representative the
day before; (4) reported to work in response to a call; (5) to work in a different job classification;
(6) and continued to work through one or more unscheduled shifts; (6) such that the nurse was
entitled to daily and weekly overtime, only effects the rate of pay to be used to determine the
amount owed to the nurse for the 3.0 hours she worked but not was not paid.

In fact, defendants themselves admit that the “welter” of CBA provisions exampled in
their hypothetical all govern “the rate at which the employees are paid.” See Defendants’
Response at 9 (emphasis added). And the rate at which an employee is paid is relevant only to
damages, and does not mandate preemption. See Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 n.12. (“A collectivebargaining agreement may, of course, contain information such as rate of pay and other
economic benefits that might be helpful in determining the damages to which a worker
prevailing in a state-law suit is entitled.”) (emphasis added).
Therefore, defendants have provided the Court with a prime example, albeit absent some
key facts, of how the provisions of the CBA will not need to be interpreted, and that preemption
is not required.
B.

Claims for Breach of Contract Do Not Require the Interpretation of the
CBA, and therefore, Are Not Preempt by § 301 of the LMRA

Likewise, plaintiffs’ common law claims for breach of contract are independent of the
CBA, arising solely out of state law, and are not preempted by the LMRA.
The United States Supreme Court has held that “individual employment contracts are not
inevitably superseded by any subsequent collective agreement covering an individual employee,
and claims based upon them may arise under state law.” Caterpillar, Inc., 482 U.S. at 396. “A
plaintiff covered by a collective-bargaining agreement is permitted to assert legal rights
independent of that agreement, including state-law contract rights, so long as the contract relied
upon is not a collective-bargaining agreement.” Id. (citing Allis-Chalmers, Corp., 471 U.S. at
212) (emphasis in original); see also Allen v. Sara Lee Corp., No. 6:06-501, 2007 WL 445363, at
*6 (E.D.Ky. Feb. 6, 2007); Lee v. Tyco Elec. Power Sys., Inc., 393 F. Supp. 2d 429, 434 (N.D.
Tex. 2005). The Supreme Court held that “Section 301 governs claims found directly on rights
created by collective-bargaining agreements, and also claims substantially dependent on analysis
of a collective-bargaining agreement. [Plaintiffs] allege that Caterpillar has entered into and
breached individual employment contract with them. Section 301 says nothing about the content
or validity of individual employment contracts.” Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 394-395.

Here, plaintiffs allege in their complaint several theories of breach of contract under
Massachusetts common law. See Complaint ¶¶ 163-171. However, plaintiffs do not rely on any
CBA, either on the face of their complaint or in the theory of their claims. Rather, plaintiffs rely
on the individual employment contracts that defendants entered into with each named plaintiff
and potential class member upon hire.

The individual employment contracts, from which

plaintiffs’ breach of contract claims arise, were created by the representations and promises made
by defendants individually to employees, in order to induce employment.

Defendants’

representations and promises that they would pay plaintiffs and class members for all time
worked constitute individual employment contracts independent of the CBA.
Further, interpretation of any CBA will not be required to litigate plaintiffs’ breach of
contract claims because those claims simply do not arise from the terms of any CBA. Plaintiffs
do not believe that the CBA will even need to be consulted because plaintiffs’ claims arise out of
completely separate contracts from the CBA, but in the event that the CBA does need to be
consulted, removal jurisdiction is still improper. See Livadas, 512 U.S. at 124; Lingle, 486 U.S.
at 413 n. 12; Lueck, 471 U.S. at 211; Lydon, 175 F.3d at 10. Therefore, defendants’ argument
that plaintiffs’ breach of contract claims are preempted by § 301 of the LMRA fails, and their
motion to dismiss should be denied.
Defendants also argue that plaintiffs’ contract claims, if based on contracts other than the
CBAs, are subject to Garmon preemption. See San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, 359
U.S. 236 (1959) (courts must defer to the NLRB when an activity is subject to § 7 or § 8 of the
NLRB). Sections 7 and 8 of the NLRB provide employees the right to bargain collectively, and
prohibit employers from refusing to bargain collectively with the representatives of their
employees. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 157, 158(a)(5). Section 8 further defines “unfair labor practices,”
and the parameters of collective bargaining. See 29 U.S.C. § 158(d); see generally 29 U.S.C. §
158.

Despite defendants’ reliance on J.I. Case Co. v. NLRB, for the proposition that
“individual contracts no matter what the circumstances that justify their execution or what their
terms, may not be availed of to defeat or delay the procedures prescribed by the [NLRB] looking
to collective bargaining,” the Supreme Court has held that not all individual contracts are
controlled by the NLRB. 321 U.S. 332, 337 (1944); see Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 396.
In Caterpillar, the Supreme Court held that J.I. Case did “not stand for the proposition
that all individual employment contracts are subsumed into, or eliminated by, the collectivebargaining agreement.”

482 U.S. at 396.

Therefore, employees covered by a CBA are

“permitted to assert legal rights independent of that agreement, including state-law contract
rights, so long as the contract relied upon is not a collective-bargaining agreement. Id (emphasis
in original). In fact, the Court in J.I. Case stated that “[w]e cannot except individual contracts
generally from the operation of collective ones because some may be more individually
advantageous. Individual contracts cannot subtract from collective ones, and whether under
some circumstances they may add to them in matters covered by the collective bargain, we leave
to be determined by appropriate forums under the laws of contracts applicable…” 321 U.S. at
339.
Here, the individual contracts relied upon by plaintiffs neither add nor subtract from the
rights governed under the CBAs. Rather, plaintiffs’ individual contracts with defendants provide nothing
more than what the laws of Massachusetts provide – that employees are to be paid for all hour worked at
the rate agreed upon by the parties, and at premium rates for overtime hours. Therefore, plaintiffs’ are
those “legal rights independent” of the CBAs, and are not subject to Garmon preemption. Accordingly,
defendants’ motion to dismiss based on Garmon preemption should be denied.

Therefore, plaintiffs’ common law breach of contract claims are not preempted by federal
labor law, and defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.

Claims for Promissory Estoppel, Assumpsit and Quantum Meruit/Unjust
Enrichment Do Not Require Interpretation of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement, and therefore Are Not Preempted by § 301 of the LMRA

Similarly, plaintiffs’ implied contract claims for promissory estoppel, assumpsit and
quantum meruit/unjust enrichment are not preempted by the LMRA because they do not require
interpretation of the CBAs, and arise out of individual employment agreements.
Defendants’ argue that because the terms of the CBA will need to be interpreted to
determine if there is an express contract between the parties, plaintiffs implied contract claims
must be preempted by the LMRA. See Memo in Support at 23.
Quasi-contractual remedies are available to plaintiffs as alternative theories of liability in
the event no enforceable contract between the parties is found. Savidge v. TransCanada Power
Mktg., Ltd., No. 062602, 2007 WL 3014701, at *2 (Mass. Sup. Ct. September 6, 2007) (citing
Meredith & Grew, Inc. v. Worcester Lincoln, LLC, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 152 (2005)); see also
Viera v. First American Title Ins. Co., No. 08-cv-11331, 2009 WL 3432656, at *9 (D. Mass. Oct.

79, 93 (1st Cir. 2009) (“The plaintiffs had the right to plead alternative theories of liability …
and their exercise of that right did not debar them from an independent review of each set of
claims.”) (internal citation omitted). Therefore, at this stage in litigation it would be premature
to dismiss plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment/quantum meruit claims plead in the alternative of their
breach of contract claims. See generally Barrett v. H & R Block, Inc., No. 08-10157-RWZ, 2009
WL 2476526, at *5 (D. Mass. February 6, 2009) (refusing to dismiss plaintiffs’ alternate theories
of liability while recognizing plaintiffs could only recover under one theory); Savidge, 2007 WL
3014701, at *2 (refusing to dismiss plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel claims
because they were alternative theories of liability).
Because, as detailed above, plaintiffs’ common law breach of contract claims arise out of
the individual employment contracts, and not the CBA, interpretation of the CBA will not be
needed for the Court to determine if an express contract exists between the parties. Therefore,
- 28 -

plaintiffs’ claims for promissory estoppel, assumpsit, and quantum meruit/unjust enrichment are
not preempted.
D.

Claims for Fraud, Misrepresentation and Conversion Do Not Require the
Interpretation of the CBA, and therefore Are Not Preempted by § 301 of the
LMRA

Lastly, defendants assert that plaintiffs’ claims for fraud, misrepresentation and
conversion will require the interpretation of the CBA because if defendants “complied with the
agreements, then it misrepresented nothing and did not wrongly ‘convert’ the plaintiffs’ wages.”
See Memo in Response at 22.
Plaintiffs agree that this would be true if plaintiffs’ claims asserted that the fraud,
misrepresentation and conversion were based on the provisions of the CBA. However, the
question is not whether defendants complied with the CBA because plaintiffs did not assert that
their claims are based on the terms of the CBA.

Rather, plaintiffs’ claims for fraud,

misrepresentation and conversion are based on defendants’ failure to pay plaintiffs for all work
performed and their representations to the contrary. See generally Lingle, 486 U.S. at 407
(“Each of these purely factual questions pertains to the conduct of the employee and the conduct
and motivation of the employer.”). As a result, there will be no need to interpret the CBA for
these claims either.
For example, in order to state a cause of action for fraud, plaintiffs must show that “the
defendant has knowingly made a false statement of material fact, intending that the plaintiff rely
thereon, and upon which the plaintiff did rely.” Chan, 872 N.E.2d at 1157 (internal citations
omitted). As stated above, plaintiffs do not allege that the “false statement of material fact”
made by defendants was in the form of a provision in the CBA. Rather, plaintiffs claim for fraud
relies on defendants’ behavior, motivation and statements that they would pay plaintiffs for all
time worked. See Wynn v. AC Rochester, 273 F.3d 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations
omitted); see also Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assocs., 116 F.3d 35, 40 (2d Cir. 1997); Trans
Penn Wax Corp. v. McCandless, 50 F.3d 217, 232 (3d Cir. 1994).

Therefore, due to the independent and factual nature of the claims, plaintiffs’ claims for
fraud, misrepresentation and conversion arise independently of the CBAs and are not preempted.
III.

DEFENDANTS CANNOT ESTABLISH THAT ANY HOSPITAL EXEMPTION
APPLIES TO THIS CASE
Buried deep within their Memo in Support, demonstrating defendants’ own view of the

strength of this argument, defendants raise an argument concerning a purported exemption under
state law. See Memo in Support at 24.
To start, as defendants acknowledge, there have been no reported cases on the so-called
hospital exemption under the Wage Act or the Minimum Wage law, making it improper for this
Court to resolve the argument. Indeed, the First Circuit has held that when a particular claim or
defense raises novel issues of state law, it is preferable that the issue be resolved by a state court.
Villa Marina Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Hatteras Yachts, 947 F.2d 529, 534-35 (1st Cir. 1991); see also
Philip Morris Inc. v. Harshburger, 946 F. Supp. 1067, 1078-79 (D. Mass. 1996) (abstaining from
deciding novel questions of state law in a federal proceeding to allow plaintiffs to pursue those
claims in state court); Conway v. Boston Edison Co., 745 F. Supp. 773, 779 (D. Mass. 1990)
(refusing to reach novel issues of state law, holding that if they were necessary to the resolution
of the case, the court would remand to state court) (citing Naylor v. Case & McGrath, Inc., 585
F.2d 557, 565-66 (2d Cir. 1978)); Mattingly v. Newport Offshore, Ltd., 57 B.R. 797, 800 (D. R.I.
1986) (remanding to state court rather than consider complicated issues of state law) (internal
citations omitted).20
The present issue before the Court, namely an archaic portion of legislation that has never
been invoked, is just the type of “novel or complex” issue of state law that should be left in the
hands of the state courts to decide—where this case was originally filed and where it was
properly brought as set forth in plaintiffs’ motion to remand. See Docket No. 11. Defendants’
20

In fact, the federal rules provide further support for the proposition that novel state law
issues should be heard in state court. Under Section 1367, federal district courts may
decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that raise “novel or complex
issues of state law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1).

Page 32 of 40

argument, though raised in the present motion, is further support of plaintiffs’ argument that their
claims are best heard by the Massachusetts Superior Court.21
Additionally, in Massachusetts, just as under federal law, an exemption is an affirmative
defense which the employer bears the burden to establish. Somers v. Converged Access, Inc.,
454 Mass. 582, 591 n.12 (2009) (citing Goodrow v. Lane Bryant, Inc., 432 Mass. 165, 170
(2000)). And a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 is not an appropriate vehicle to raise an
affirmative defense. Rule 12 provides that “[e]very defense to a claim for relief in any pleading
must be asserted in the responsive pleading,” rather than in a Rule 12 motion. Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1) (providing that a statute of limitations defenses must be
asserted in the answer). There are only seven exceptions to this rule, and a statutory exemption
defense is not one of them. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). Accordingly, an affirmative defense is
premature on a motion to dismiss and courts will not entertain it unless “the facts establishing the
defense [are] clear ‘on the face of the plaintiff's pleadings.’” Santana-Castro v. Toledo-Davila,
579 F.3d 109, 114 (1st Cir. 2009) (emphasis added) (quoting Trans-Spec Truck Serv., Inc. v.
Caterpillar, Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 320 (1st Cir. 2008)).
Therefore, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court remand the entire action to state
court, or in the alternative, certify the issue to state court. However, in the event that this Court
should consider the issue, which it should not, defendants’ motion to dismiss should still be
denied.
A.

Defendants are not Exempt from the Overtime Provisions of the Minimum
Wage Act

To avoid their obligation to pay their employees overtime, defendants rely on an obscure,
never-invoked provision of Massachusetts law that used to exempt hospitals from state overtime
requirements. This exemption, however, is a mere vestigial of a time when both the FLSA and
21

Notably, defendants failed to raise this argument in their response to plaintiffs’ motion to
remand this action to state court. Defendants’ implicitly recognize the strength of
plaintiffs’ argument through their omission as they know it dooms their effort to defeat
plaintiffs’ motion to remand.
- 31 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 33 of 40

Massachusetts state law exempted hospitals from overtime laws. That exemption has long since
been abandoned in federal law. Given that the Massachusetts legislature has expressed its intent
to follow the substance of federal law, defendants should not be able to invoke it to avoid their
obligations under state law either.
Defendants rely solely on Mass Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A (16) which purportedly exempts
hospitals from the overtime requirements of Massachusetts state wage and hour law. But even
defendants acknowledge that this provision—in the more than half a century that it has been on
the books—has never even once been invoked by any court to deny overtime protection to any
hospital employee.22

This fact alone raises serious questions about whether this provision

continues to hold weight.
The relationship between state and federal wage and hour law answers these questions
with a resounding “no.” Although the state legislature has chosen to express its will with slightly
different semantics than Congress has chosen, it is clear that the intent and purpose of the state
overtime provisions is to extend the protections embodied in federal law to employees that are
beyond the reach of Congress’ commerce power. See Swift v. AutoZone, Inc., 441 Mass. 443,
447, (2004) (“The overtime provision of the minimum wage law . . . was expressly intended to
provide comparable overtime compensation ‘for all workers not now covered by Federal law.’”)
(citing 1960 Mass. Senate Doc No. 1, at 22). Or as the Supreme Judicial Court and the First
Circuit have both put it, the Massachusetts state law overtime provisions “were intended be
‘essentially identical’ to Federal law.” Id. (quoting Valerio v. Putnam Assocs. Inc., 173 F.3d 35,
40 (1st Cir. 1999)). For this reason, the Supreme Judicial Court calls the FLSA “the cognate
Federal statute” to Massachusetts Minimum Wage Act, and looks to its provisions to resolve
ambiguities in Massachusetts law. Id.; see also O’Donnell v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc., 534 F.
22

Implicitly acknowledging that employees may bring claims against hospitals for unpaid
wages and overtime, the Massachusetts Attorney General has issued “right to sue letters”
to employees of hospitals, indicating that they may bring a private suit pursuant to Mass.
Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1B. See Newman Aff., Exhibits B, Attorney General Issued Right
to Sue Letter for Named Plaintiffs in this Action.

Supp. 2d 173, 183 n.3 (D. Mass. 2008) (“Massachusetts law mirrors federal law with respect to
the definitions of exempt employees and the overtime pay provisions.”).
In Swift v. AutoZone, for example, the Supreme Judicial Court considered the question of
whether crediting for overtime pay for Sunday work towards the total overtime due to employees
was permitted under state law. 441 Mass. at 447-450. There was no provision permitting such
crediting in the FLSA as originally enacted in 1938, and similarly, there was no such provision in
the Massachusetts Minimum Wage Act, as enacted in 1947. Id. In 1949, Congress amended the
FLSA to permit crediting, see 29 U.S.C. § 207(e)(6), (h), and Massachusetts passed a similar
amendment in 2003. Id. The Supreme Judicial Court concluded, however, because of the
purpose of Massachusetts wage and hour law, that even before the 2003 amendment, state law
followed federal law. Id.
By the same logic, an exemption for hospitals, which federal law has long since
discarded, no longer continues to be valid under state law. Before 1966, hospital employees
were not originally covered by the FLSA. See Cent. Aguirre Sugar Co. v. Castro, 330 F.2d 68,
70-71 (1st Cir. 1964) (holding that hospital employees were not “engaged in commerce” under
the FLSA). Similarly, the Massachusetts overtime statute, passed in 1960, made hospitals
exempt from overtime. See Swift v. AutoZone, 441 Mass. at 448 (overtime compensation statute
passed in 1960). In 1966, however, Congress amended the FLSA to ensure that it covered
hospital employees. It did so in two ways: first, by removing the exemption for employees of
public hospitals, see Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 533 (1985)
(“Congress extended FLSA coverage . . . by withdrawing the minimum wage and overtime
exemptions from . . . public hospital[s].”), and second, by extending the definition of an
“enterprise engaged in commerce” to specifically include hospitals, see Maryland v. Wirtz, 392
U.S. 183, 186 (1968) (overruled on other grounds) (describing the enactment of the 1966
amendments).
And just as under federal law, it is not enough for the employer to prove that it falls under
- 33 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 35 of 40

the literal words of the statute; rather the employer must prove that it in fact falls within the spirit
of the legislature’s intent. Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388, 392 (1960) (holding that
FLSA exemptions must be “narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and
their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and
spirit.”); see also Calaf v. Gonzalez, 127 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1942); cf Sturdy Mem. Found.,
Inc. v. Bd. of Assessors, 804 N.E.2d 368, 375-77 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004) (holding that to claim a
tax exemption for charities, a hospital must prove not only that it is organized as a charity, but
also that it operates as a charity).

Since 1966, the overtime requirements of federal law have

applied to hospital employees. And because Massachusetts overtime law is designed to follow
federal law and to extend the provisions of federal law to those employees beyond the reach of
the FLSA, it is no surprise that no court has ever relied on the vestigial hospital exemption to
deny employees overtime pay under Massachusetts overtime law. In light of this history, and to
the surprise of tens of thousands of health care employees, defendants cannot carry their burden
to show that the legislature intended to deny overtime pay to their employees.
B.

Defendants are not Exempt from the Wage Payment Act

Defendants also rely on a provision of the Wage Payment Act that makes certain
hospitals exempt from the wage payment law as a basis for exemption.
Again, a motion to dismiss is not the proper vehicle to raise affirmative defenses.
Further, defendants cannot raise this exemption as a defense because the facts establishing the
defense are not clear on the face of the complaint. This defense can apply only if the hospital “is
supported in part by contributions from the commonwealth … provides treatment to patients free
of charge … [or] … is conducted as a public charity.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 148, § 149. None of
these facts are clearly established on the face of the complaint. Moreover, even when these
prerequisites are met, the defense still does not apply if the “employee requests such hospital to
pay him weekly.” Id. Defendants have not shown that employees did not make such requests.
Therefore defendants fail to establish that the elements of the defense are established on the face
- 34 -

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Document 18

Filed 12/18/2009

Page 36 of 40

of the complaint. To the extent that Defendants argue that these elements are met, they are
merely making factual arguments that are premature at this point and do nothing to carry their
burden on a motion to dismiss.
Therefore, defendants’ arguments concerning exceptions under state law are due to be
dismissed.
IV.

PLAINTIFFS’ COMMON LAW CLAIMS ARE NOT PREEMPTED BY THE
MASSACHUSETTS WAGE ACT AND MINIMUM WAGE LAW
Defendants’ argue that plaintiffs’ common law claims are preempted by the

Massachusetts Wage Act and Massachusetts Minimum Wage Law, and should therefore be
dismissed.
However, “[i]t is well established that ‘an existing common law remedy is not to be taken
away by statute unless by direct enactment or necessary implication.’”

Eyssi v. City of

Lawrence, 416 Mass. 194, 199-200 (1993) (quoting Ferriter v. Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, 381
Mass. 507, 521 (1980)). Further, “‘[a] statute is not to be interpreted as effecting a material
change in or a repeal of the common law unless the intent to do so is clearly expressed.’” Id.
(quoting Riley v. Davison Constr. Co., 381 Mass. 432, 438 (1980)) (emphasis added).
Additionally, “[t]he mere fact that the statute provides for enforcement by the Attorney General
and establishes a private cause of action for aggrieved employees does not indicate that the
Massachusetts legislature intended it to have a preclusive effect on common law claims.” Tomei
v. Corix Utils (U.S.) Inc., No. 07-cv-11928-DPW, 2009 WL 2982775, at *19 (D. Mass. Sept. 14,
2009) (Woodlock, J.).
In fact, in Spears v. Miller, the court held that “this Division is not inclined to read G.L.
c. 151, § 1A and 1B as preempting all common law claims for unpaid overtime wages without a
clear mandate from the Legislature to do so.” No. 1683, 2006 WL 2808145, at *2 (Mass. App.
Div. Sep. 26, 2006). In so holding, the court stated that “when our Legislature intends to make a
statutory remedy exclusive, it has done so by explicit language. Such language is conspicuously
absent from G.L. c. 151, §§ 1A and 1B.” Id. (footnote omitted) (citing Lowry v. Klemm, 446

Mass. 572, 579-580 (2006) (exclusivity provisions of G.L. c. 151B, § 9 and c. 214, § 1C prohibit
plaintiffs from framing sexual harassment as violation of other statutes or as common law claim);
King v. Driscoll, 418 Mass. 576, 584 n. 7 (1994) (G.L. c. 151, § 9(1) provides that statutory
redress for employment termination in violation of public policy is exclusive)).
Further, in Tomei, this Court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 27 and ch. 151, § 1A
did not preclude plaintiff from bringing claim under common law. 2009 WL 2982775, at *19
(noting that there were no “Massachusetts cases which confront the issue of preclusion for the
prevailing wage statute” and that the Massachusetts overtime wage statute “does not preclude a
plaintiff from bringing common law claims for failure to pay overtime”) (citing Spears, 2006
WL 2808145, at *2) (emphasis in original)).
Here, like in Spears and Tomei, the plaintiffs have alleged claims under Mass. Gen. Laws
ch. 151, § 1A and different theories of common law.23 As this court has already recognized,
Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A does not preclude remedies under common law.
In support of their argument, defendants rely on numerous Massachusetts Superior Court
decisions on motions for summary judgment, the majority of which are dealing with claims
brought under the Massachusetts Tip Statute.24 See Defendants’ Memo in Support at 26. Not
only are these cases dealing with a different statutory provision, they are at odds with the case
law holding that the overtime wage statute does not preclude a plaintiffs’ common law claims.
Therefore, plaintiffs’ common law claims are not preempted by the Massachusetts Wage

Like Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 151, § 1A, ch. 149 § 148 references the same section (ch. 149,
§ 27C) for remedies.
Additionally, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(e)(2) ‘allows parties to take inconsistent
positions in their pleadings, especially at the early stages of litigation, and as such, a
party’s pleading will not be treated as an admission precluding another, inconsistent,
pleading.” Rodriguez-Suris v. Montesinos, 123 F.3d 10, 20 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Gens
v. Resolution Trust Corp., 112 F.3d 569, 573 (1st Cir. 1997); Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P &
B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1555 (1st Cir. 1994); Barrett v. H & R Block, Inc., Civ. No.
08-10157-RWZ, 2009 WL 2476526, at *5 (D. Mass Feb. 6, 2009) (“Rule 8 permits
plaintiffs to please alternative theories”). Therefore, it would be improper to dismiss
plaintiffs’ state common law claims prior to discovery.

Act and Minimum Wage Law.25

EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL IS AN INDEPENDENT CAUSE OF ACTION
Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims for equitable estoppel fail because they are not

independent causes of action.
However, “equitable estoppel, while characterized by [defendant] as an equitable bar to
the invocation of the Statute of Frauds as a defense to a contract claim, is not that at all; it states a
separate and distinct cause of action of reliance.” M.H. Promotion Group, Inc. v. Cincinnati
Milacron Inc., No. 96-0832C, 1998 WL 52239, at *6 (Mass. Super. Jan. 28, 1998).
The “essential elements of equitable estoppel are (1) a representation or conduct
amounting to a representation intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the person to
whom the representation is made; (2) an act or omission resulting from the representation,
whether actual or by conduct, by the person to whom the representation is made; and (3)
detriment to the reliant person as a consequence of the act or omission[].” Renovator’s Supply,
Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 892 N.E.2d 777, 785 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008) (affirming Superior Court’s
judgment holding defendant liable to plaintiff under the principle of equitable estoppel) (internal
25

Addressing footnote 49 in Defendant’s Memo in Support, courts have also commonly
held that common law claims can be brought alongside FLSA claims. See Defendants’
Memo in Support at 27. At least two Circuit Court of Appeals opinions hold that state
common law claims are not preempted by FLSA claims. See Williamson v. General
Dynamics Corp., 208 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that fraud claims are not
preempted based upon the FLSA’s savings clause which indicates that the FLSA does not
provide an exclusive remedy); see also Freeman v. City of Mobile, Ala., 146 F.3d 1292,
1298 (11th Cir. 1998) (“[T]he FLSA does not preempt state law contract provisions that
are more generous than the FLSA demands”). Moreover, there are numerous district
court decisions which likewise hold that state common law claims are not preempted by
FLSA claims. See Paukstis v. Kenwood Golf & Country Club, Inc., 241 F. Supp.2d 551
(D. Md. 2003) (holding that plaintiff’s negligence claims were not preempted by the
FLSA despite the fact they were based on same set of facts because the FLSA does not
explicitly preempt tort claims, FLSA contemplated coextensive FLSA and state law
coverage, and negligence claims do not conflict with FLSA’s remedial scheme); see also
Washington v. Fred’s Stores of Tennessee, 427 F. Supp.2d 725 (S.D. Miss. 2006)
(holding that plaintiff’s negligence and conversion claims were not preempted by the
FLSA based upon analysis of the preemption framework of express, implied and conflict
preemption).

citations and emphasis omitted).
In FLSA cases, courts have held that employers are estopped from asserting a statute of
limitations defense if the employee reasonably relied on their employer’s representations that
they would be properly compensated. See Long v. Idaho Rural Water Assoc., Inc., No. CV 05303-S-EJL, 2007 WL 1366534, at *10 (D. Idaho Mar. 29, 2007) (employer orally promised to
fully compensate employee at a later date and was therefore estopped from asserting defense of
statute of limitations); Prange v. Borders, Inc., No. 05-2194, 2006 WL 2632013, at *4 (N.D. Ill.
Sept. 11, 2006) (employer estopped from asserting statute of limitations defense after assuring
employee that she would be paid for off-the-clock hours).
Plaintiffs’ complaint establishes that, through defendants’ conduct and concealment of
facts, plaintiffs were induced to believe they were being properly paid for all time worked.26
These representations made by defendants are similar to those made in Prange, where the
employer had assured employee that they would be properly compensated for all off-the-clock
hours. 2006 WL 2632013, at *4. Also in Long, the employer had promised an employee that
they would be properly compensated at a later date. 2007 WL 1366534, at *10. In each of these
cases, the misrepresentations made were sufficient to invoke the doctrine of estoppel.
As a result of these inducements, plaintiffs relied to their detriment through continued
employment without knowledge of the amount of wages to which they were entitled, and without
knowledge of their status and rights under the FLSA. See Complaint ¶ 154 (“Defendants
concealed the fact that they did not pay Plaintiffs and Class Members for all compensable time
26

See Complaint ¶¶ 143 (“Through the paystubs and payroll information it provided to
employees, BMC deliberately concealed from its employees that they did not receive
compensation for all compensable time and misled them into believing they were being
paid properly.”); ¶ 145 (“Further, in the course of their business, by maintaining and
propagating the illegal policies, defendants deliberately misrepresented to Plaintiffs and
Class Members that they were being properly paid for compensable time, even though
Plaintiffs were not receiving pay for all compensable time.”); ¶ 141 (“The defendants
engaged in such conduct and made statements to conceal from the Plaintiffs their rights
and to frustrate the vindication of the employees’ rights under Massachusetts law.”); ¶
142 (“As a result, employees were unaware of their claims.”).

from Plaintiffs and Class Members. Plaintiffs and Class Members relied upon defendants’
representations by performing work and services for defendants. This reliance was reasonable,
as Plaintiffs and Class Members had every right to believe that defendants would abide by their
obligations to pay for all hours worked pursuant to the Mass. Gen. Law Ch. 149 §§ 148, 150 and
Mass. Gen. Law Ch. 151 §§ 1A, 1B and common law.”); see also Long, 2007 WL 1366534, at
*10; Prange, 2006 WL 2632013, at *4.
Because plaintiffs reasonably relied on these misrepresentations, they were unaware of
available remedies under Massachusetts statutory and common laws, and therefore, plaintiffs’
equitable estoppel claims should not be dismissed.
CONCLUSION
Because defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving the facts necessary to
support dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims, plaintiffs respectfully request that defendants’ motion to
dismiss be denied.
