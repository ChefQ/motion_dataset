CIVIL ACTION NO. 09-CV-11724 NMG
LEAVE TO FILE MEMORANDUM OF
LAW IN EXCESS OF TWENTY PAGES
GRANTED ON DECEMBER 11, 2009

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS
Defendants Boston Medical Center Corporation (“BMC”), Elaine Ullian, and James Canavan
(collectively, “Defendants”)1 submit this Memorandum of Law in support of their Motion to Dismiss all
counts of the complaint (“Complaint”) by Elizabeth Manning, Lisa Rivers, and Rhonda Williams
(together, “Plaintiffs”), originally filed in Massachusetts Superior Court for Middlesex County.2 As
chronicled in a website that Plaintiffs’ Counsel maintains, www.hospitalovertime.com, this lawsuit is
part of a far-reaching campaign that the law firm of Thomas & Solomon LLP has launched against
hospitals around the country.3 That campaign has included the filing of multiple cookie-cutter
complaints, including ten lawsuits filed in the Massachusetts state and federal courts in early September

Named defendants Boston Regional Medical Center, LLC and Boston Regional Medical Center, Inc. are not and have
never been affiliated in any manner with Boston Medical Center. Moreover, to the best of Defendants’ knowledge, the
Boston Regional Medical Center facility in Stoneham, Massachusetts, has been closed for several years. Boston Regional
Medical Center, LLC and Boston Regional Medical Center, Inc. are not represented by the undersigned counsel.
2

Defendants’ present motion to dismiss is limited to the claims in this lawsuit, which were originally asserted in the
Massachusetts Superior Court and removed to this Court on October 16, 2009; it does not address the separate but related
claims filed by the same plaintiffs in this Court on September 3, 2009, pending as docket no. 09-cv-11463 NMG.
Defendants’ Motion to Consolidate the two cases, filed on November 4, 2009, is pending.

2009, which are grounded in speculation and devoid of allegations of any specific facts.4 While the
complaints in each case allege broadly and in prolix fashion that each of the hospital defendants
defrauded employees by making them work during meal breaks and failing to pay for preliminary and
postliminary work and mandatory training, they do not plead a single underlying allegation of fact. The
paucity of Plaintiffs’ allegations is demonstrated by the fact that Plaintiffs’ counsel has used virtually
identical language to describe their claims against every one of the multiple hospitals and healthcare
systems they have sued in Massachusetts and in disparate areas of the country, as well as the allegations
against their respective CEOs and human resources executives. Not content to simply allege
conclusory wage and hour claims, Plaintiffs – without a whisper of additional factual basis – concoct
quantum meruit, conversion, promissory estoppel, and other such claims, based only on the assumption
that their imagined violations of wage and hour laws perforce constitute other legal wrongs.
Despite its length and numerous counts, Plaintiffs’ Complaint offers nothing more than
formulaic recitations of the bare elements of the causes of action they assert in place of factual
allegations in support of their claims. This alone mandates dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims. Even if the
Court is inclined to look beyond these pleading deficiencies, Plaintiffs’ claims suffer additional and
fatal legal flaws. Plaintiffs’ statutory claims fail because the statutes they invoke state on their face that
they do not apply to employees of hospitals. In addition, because Plaintiffs are members of collective
bargaining units subject to collective bargaining agreements, their claims for breach of other nebulously
described express or implied “agreements” with BMC, as well as their common law claims that require
interpretation of the terms of the various collective bargaining agreements in effect at BMC, fail

In addition to the ten nearly identical cases filed in Massachusetts, Plaintiffs’ counsel has filed seven lawsuits in Pittsburgh
and five lawsuits in New York. See Taylor v. Pittsburg Mercy Health Sys., No. 09-006476 (Allegheny Cty. Pa., filed Apr.

because federal labor law preempts such claims. Plaintiffs’ derivative common law claims fail because
they are preempted by state statutes. Finally, Plaintiffs’ count for “equitable estoppel” asserts a cause
of action that simply does not exist. Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to state a single viable claim, and thus
the Court should dismiss the state law claims in their entirety.
Background
I.

BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER CORPORATION
BMC is a not-for-profit healthcare organization that operates Boston Medical Center, a 626-bed

hospital located in the South End neighborhood of Boston. BMC was created pursuant to special
enabling legislation and by the merger of public and private healthcare institutions whose mission
includes caring for the city’s poorest, sickest patients.5 Plaintiffs are current and former employees of
BMC who were paid on an hourly basis. In addition, Plaintiffs and almost all of the BMC employees
whom they seek to represent are members of unionized bargaining units. The terms and conditions of
employment of each bargaining unit is governed by a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”)
between BMC and the Massachusetts Nurses Association (“MNA”); 1199SEIU United Healthcare
Workers East; or the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (“AFSCME”),
Council 93, AFL-CIO/CLC.6 Each CBA covers a separate bargaining unit, throughout different
facilities. The several CBAs that cover Plaintiffs are similar in all material respects.
II.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS
The CBAs contain comprehensive provisions governing breaks, overtime compensation,

premium pay, on-call pay, shift differentials, shift assignments, fulfilling staffing needs, training, and
record retention.7 The provisions of the CBAs concerning breaks are especially significant to this case.
5

See Chapter 147 of the Acts of 1995.

6

The collective bargaining agreements are properly before the Court on this Motion to Dismiss because they were referred
to and relied upon in Plaintiffs’ Complaint. See, e.g., Beddall v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.
1998) (“When, as now, a complaint’s factual allegations are expressly linked to – and admittedly dependent upon – a
document (the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial
court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).”).

between 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East and BMC (Registered Nurses) is attached as Exhibit 2; the CBA

They contain meal break provisions and stipulate that employees “shall” be provided a fifteen-minute
rest period for each eight hours of work “scheduled in accordance with the operational needs of the
department or unit”8 but recognize that, in some instances, employees may need to work during their
fifteen or thirty-minute break and require payment for that time. The collective bargaining agreements
impose requirements that are more generous than the requirements of Massachusetts wage and hour
law. For example, Massachusetts wage and hour law does not require employers to pay employees
overtime for working more than a certain number of hours in a day. By contrast, provided certain
conditions are met, the collective bargaining agreements require BMC to pay an employee who is
regularly scheduled to work at least eight hours per day time-and-a-half if the employee works beyond
his or her shift at the hospital’s request.9 Similarly, unlike Massachusetts law, the collective bargaining
agreements provide that an employee scheduled to work but sent home will receive reporting pay.10
Accordingly, the wage and hour thrust of Plaintiffs’ case can be understood only in the context of the
long-standing and robust collective bargaining at BMC. Plaintiffs cannot litigate these claims without
parsing the complex agreements that they identify in their Complaint.

THE COMPLAINT
On September 10, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a thirteen-count complaint in Suffolk Superior Court. In

their Complaint, Plaintiffs contend that they were wrongfully deprived of remuneration in three ways.
First, they claim that BMC automatically deducted time from their total hours worked for meal breaks
even when they performed work during a meal break period. Complaint (“Compl.”), ¶¶ 79-87.
Second, they claim that unnamed “policies, practices and/or [unidentified aspects of BMC’s] time
recording system” prevented them from recording preliminary and postliminary work performed at the
start and conclusion of each shift. Compl., ¶¶ 99-102. Third, they claim that BMC failed to pay them
for time spent attending “compensable training programs.” Plaintiffs claim that this alleged failure to
pay wages constitutes a breach of unidentified promises, as well as a violation of the Massachusetts
Payment of Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148 (the “Wage Act”) (Count I), and the overtime
provisions of the Massachusetts Fair Minimum Wage Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A (“Minimum
Wage Law”) (Count II). In addition, Plaintiffs assert common law claims for breach of contract
(Counts III, IV, and V), money had and received in assumpsit (Count VI), quantum meruit/unjust
enrichment (Count VII), fraud (Count VIII), negligent misrepresentation (Count IX), equitable estoppel
(Count X), promissory estoppel (Count XI), and conversion (Count XII), as well as a claim that BMC
failed to keep accurate records (Count XIII).
BMC removed this action to this Court on October 16, 2009, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a),
1446, and 1331, based on the complete preemption corollary to the well-pleaded complaint rule, as
Plaintiffs’ state law claims are preempted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (“LMRA”).
See Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392-94 (1987); Franchise Tax Board v. Constr.
Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 23 (1983).

Argument
I.

PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT FAILS TO ASSERT FACTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE APPLICABLE
PLEADING STANDARDS.
Each claim that Plaintiffs assert in their Complaint is subject to the minimal pleading standard

established in Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937
(2009). In addition, the Plaintiffs’ claims that Defendants engaged in fraud or negligent
misrepresentation are subject to the heightened requirements of Rule 9 and must be pled with
particularity. Despite spanning twenty-nine pages and almost 200 numbered paragraphs, Plaintiffs’
Complaint is devoid of substance. Plaintiffs’ allegations primarily consist of conclusory assertions that
parrot the legal elements of one or more of the Complaint’s thirteen counts. Such allegations fail to
state any viable claim under the pleading standard established by Twombly and Iqbal, much less the
requirements of Rule 9. The Court therefore should dismiss the Complaint.
A.

Plaintiffs’ Factual Allegations Are Insufficient to Lend Credibility to Their Legal
Claims, as Twombly and Iqbal Require.

Pursuant to Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” In Twombly and Iqbal, the Supreme Court announced and
refined a new measure of a plaintiff’s compliance with that requirement. In order to survive a motion to
dismiss, a complaint must set forth factual allegations that are “enough to raise a right to relief above
the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. While the Court acknowledged that “detailed factual
allegations” are not necessary for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must present
“more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949.
“A pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of
action will not do.” Id. (quotations omitted). This refined standard is intended to prevent “a plaintiff
with a largely groundless claim [from] be[ing] allowed to take up the time of a number of other people,
with the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the settlement value.” Twombly, 550
U.S. at 558 (citations and quotations omitted). In light of the Supreme Court’s guidance, “two

6

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Page 7 of 29

underlying principles guide [] assessment of the adequacy of the plaintiffs’ pleadings.” Maldonado v.
Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 268 (1st Cir. 2009). First, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the
allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,” and legal conclusions
couched as factual allegations need not be given any credence by the court. Id.; Twombly, 550 U.S. at
555. Second, “only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.”
Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 268 (emphasis added).
As demonstrated below, none of Plaintiffs’ thirteen counts satisfy these pleading requirements.
If Plaintiffs had been subject to any identifiable legal wrong, they might have shared with the Court a
few specifics about their own compensation or experiences as employees of BMC. Instead, Plaintiffs’
Complaint consists of only vague references to alleged violations of statutes and common law, and is
almost devoid of substantive factual allegations that would ground a plausible claim for relief. Indeed,
on the same day that they filed the Complaint in this matter, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed substantially
identical complaints against every major hospital system in Massachusetts, not pleading facts but
reciting the same litany of unadorned, boilerplate allegations in every case.11 To paraphrase
Shakespeare, Plaintiffs’ allegations are full of sound and fury, but without factual background sufficient
to demonstrate “more than a sheer possibility that [the] defendant has acted unlawfully,” they signify
nothing. See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949.
1.

Plaintiffs Fail To Provide Sufficient Factual Support for Their Statutory
Wage Claims.

Counts I and II of Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which assert claims for failure to pay wages and
overtime pursuant to the Wage Act and the Minimum Wage Law fail principally because BMC’s

Superior Court on October 16, 2009); Cavallaro v. UMass Mem’l Healthcare Inc., Civil Action No. 09-CV-40181-FDS
(removed from Worcester County Superior Court on October 16, 2009); and Woolfson v. Caregroup, Inc., Middlesex
Superior Court Civil Action No. 2009-03542. In each of these cases, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a complaint containing a
nearly verbatim recitation of the same 195 numbered paragraphs against each group of defendants, including various
institutions in each healthcare system, a Chief Executive Officer, and a senior human resources officer. In each case,
Plaintiffs’ counsel asserted the same thirteen counts that they assert against BMC in this matter.

Page 8 of 29

employees are exempted from coverage of both statutes, as discussed in Part III below. Even if
Plaintiffs were not exempted from coverage, their statutory claims would fail because Plaintiffs have
not pled any facts to lend plausibility to their hollow assertion that BMC breached its supposed
statutory obligations.
To succeed on a claim under the Wage Act (Count I), Plaintiffs must show that BMC failed to
pay for all hours worked, and to succeed under the Minimum Wage Law (Count II), Plaintiffs must
show that they worked more than forty hours per week and did not receive overtime pay. Plaintiffs do
not allege facts to support their assertion regarding either of BMC’s alleged statutory violations.
Indeed, they allege nothing regarding their employment, failing even to specifically allege that they
ever worked for BMC. See Compl., ¶ 60. They similarly fail to allege what positions they held, in
which of BMC’s multiple facilities they worked, or during what time period they were employed.12
Most importantly, the Court is left to guess what their pay rates were and for what hours they have not
been paid. Without such factual allegations, there is nothing to raise their complaint “above the
speculative level,” as is necessary to survive a motion to dismiss under Twombly.
Courts applying Twombly in the analogous context of Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) cases
have held that to substantiate violations of the statute, a complaint must “at least approximately[] allege
the hours worked for which . . . wages were not received,” because “simply stating that a Plaintiff was
not paid for overtime work does not sufficiently allege a violation” of wage and hour laws. Zhong v.
August August Corp., 498 F. Supp. 2d 625, 628, 630 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quotations omitted). For
example, an employee cannot establish a minimum wage violation simply by alleging that he was not
paid at his regular rate of pay for a number of hours. Rather, he must allege facts that if proven would
demonstrate that as a result of that unpaid time, his effective rate of pay during some period dropped
below the statutory minimum. See, e.g., Bailey v. Border Foods Inc., 2009 WL 3248305, at *2 (D.
12

This is of particular concern because several of the purported “consent to join” forms that have been filed in the federal
action (pending as docket number 09-CV-11463) are signed by individuals as to whom BMC has no record, and who thus
appear never to have worked for BMC.

Minn. 2009) (granting motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ state and federal minimum wage claims because
they “failed to identify their hourly pay rates . . . or any facts [concerning hours worked and paid] that
would permit the Court to infer that Plaintiffs actually received less than minimum wage”). Such
specific allegations are particularly important here because of the remarkably broad swath of employees
whom Plaintiffs seek to sweep into a putative class in this litigation.13 Plaintiffs’ suggestion that all of
these employees performed some unspecified activities for an unstated amount of time for which they
were not paid fails to meet the Twombly standard and requires dismissal.
That Plaintiffs fail to allege facts regarding their positions, compensation, and hours of work is
merely exemplary of the ways in which their statutory claim fails to meet the Twombly standard. For
example, Plaintiffs make the conclusory assertion that they were not compensated for preliminary and
postliminary work, but they fail to provide any description of the uncompensated work they claim to
have performed. Compl., ¶¶ 93-94. They similarly allege in conclusory fashion that they attended
“compensable training programs” without specifying the nature of the training programs attended,
where they occurred, the voluntariness or job-relatedness of these training programs, or any other
allegation creating a plausible inference that these activities may be compensable.14 Compl., ¶¶ 97-98.
Each and every one of these allegations should be disregarded as legal conclusions “couched as []
factual allegation[s].” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Once these conclusions are set aside, Plaintiffs’
remaining assertions present no allegations of fact that would render their statutory claims for allegedly

13

Plaintiffs identify more than forty positions that they claim to be at issue in this case. Compl., ¶ 89. Plaintiffs provide no
basis for a contention that incumbents in all of the listed positions have performed work for which they were not paid. See
id. Moreover, the incumbents in those positions work at multiple rates and, pursuant to the various collective bargaining
agreements in effect at BMC’s multiple facilities, are subject to a variety of interwoven rules concerning their rates of pay
and hours of work. See Part II, infra. Thus, Plaintiffs’ empty Complaint is particularly egregious where they seek to
represent numerous categories of employees all of whom, so far as the Complaint pleads, enjoy different working
conditions.
14

Not all “training” is compensable work. Whether employees must be paid for training activities depends on the facts and
circumstances of the particular training. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 785.27-785.32 (describing types of training that are compensable
and types that are not).

unpaid training time and preliminary and postliminary work plausible.15 These claims, therefore, must
be dismissed.16
2.

Plaintiffs Fail to Substantiate Their Contract Claims.

Plaintiffs’ implied and express contract claims are also unsupported with factual allegations
sufficient to meet the Twombly standard. Even under the more lenient standard that preceded Twombly,
“to state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff [was required to] allege, at a minimum, that there was
a valid contract, that the defendant breached its duties under the contractual agreement, and that the
breach caused the plaintiff damage.” Moghaddam v. Dunkin’ Donuts, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 136, 139
(D. Mass. 2003) (quotations omitted). Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserts two separate claims for breach of
some unidentified express contract (Counts III and IV), as well as a claim for breach of an implied
contract (Count V). Plaintiffs, however, do nothing to substantiate the assertion that they had any
express or implied contract with BMC, and instead merely beg the question with a conclusory
allegation that “[b]y entering into an employment relationship, defendants and Plaintiffs and Class
Members entered into a contract for employment, including implied contracts and express contracts.”
Compl., ¶ 106. Plaintiffs neglect even to specify whether the express contract they allege is oral or
written. They make no allegations describing the circumstances under which the contract allegedly was
entered into, the parties to this agreement, who negotiated the alleged contract, or even the specific
terms they claim were breached. Plaintiffs do not specify whether the alleged contracts are individual
15

As another glaring example of Plaintiffs’ failure to meet the Twombly pleading standard, Plaintiffs also attribute a number
of statements and actions to “defendants’ managers” in conclusory fashion without providing any information as to the
identity of those individuals, whether they actually constitute management, or when and to whom such statements allegedly
were made. See, e.g., Compl., ¶ 84 (“Defendants’ management have [sic] repeatedly observed Plaintiffs and Class members
working through their unpaid meal breaks”); Compl., ¶ 85 (“Plaintiffs and Class Members had conversations with
defendants’ managers in which they discussed how they were working through their meal periods”). Plaintiffs reiterate
virtually identical allegations against “managers” at each of the four other hospital systems they simultaneously sued on
September 10, 2009. See supra, note 11.
16

Plaintiffs also purport to assert a claim for “failure to keep accurate records,” in which they may refer to the recordkeeping
requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 15. See Compl., ¶ 192-94 (Count XIII). This statutory section requires
employers to produce to the Massachusetts Attorney General upon request a “record of the name, address and occupation of
each employee, of the amount paid each pay period to each employee, of the hours worked each day and each week by each
employee.” Section 15 provides rights to employees only to the extent it permits them to request their own records. See id.
Plaintiffs have not alleged that they requested any records from BMC, much less that BMC failed or refused to produce
them, and they have not pled a plausible claim under that statute.

10

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

agreements with BMC or some broader agreements.17 Likewise, Plaintiffs fail to explain the basis of
their implied contract claim. While they assert that an implied contract arose from their “on-going
dealings and course of conduct” with BMC, Compl., ¶ 115, they entirely fail to describe that course of
dealing or conduct, omitting any account of the type of conduct, the timing of the conduct, or the
individuals who allegedly engaged in the conduct at issue. Without any substantiation of these legal
conclusions masquerading as allegations of fact, Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to give rise to a
plausible inference that a contract existed, much less that Defendants breached such an agreement.
3.

Plaintiffs’ Fraud and Conversion Claims Fail Because They Do Not Allege
the Necessary State of Mind.

Counts VIII and XII of the Complaint purport to assert claims for fraud and conversion. In
Massachusetts, a claim for conversion “cannot be maintained without proof that the defendant . . . did
some positive wrongful act with the intention to appropriate the property to himself.” Grande v. PFL
Life Ins. Co., 2000 WL 1476676, *4 (Mass. App. Div. 2000) (quoting Spooner v. Manchester, 133
Mass. 270, 273 (1882)) (emphasis added). Similarly, in Plaintiffs’ fraud claim, “intent, or state of
mind, of the defendant at the time the promises [that are the basis of the fraud claim] were made
becomes the relevant issue.” Bolen v. Paragon Plastics, Inc., 754 F. Supp. 221, 226 (D. Mass. 1990).18
Plaintiffs offer numerous naked assertions with regard to Defendants’ supposed mental state. For
example, they allege that Defendants “at all times intended to violate applicable Massachusetts laws by
failing to pay Plaintiffs and Class Members for all compensable time.” Compl., ¶ 149. They further

17

To the extent Plaintiffs contend that the contract referred to exists separate and distinct from the various collective
bargaining agreements in place at BMC’s facilities, they also fail to so allege. To the extent that Plaintiffs’ contract claims
do refer to such collective bargaining agreements, the claims are preempted as discussed in Part II, infra.

18

To succeed on a cause of action for fraud under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must “prove that the defendant made a
false representation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon,
and that the plaintiff relied upon the representation as true and acted upon it to his damage.” Bolen, 754 F. Supp. at 226;
Barrett Assocs., Inc. v. Aronson, 346 Mass. 150, 152 (1963). Plaintiffs allege that BMC misrepresented facts concerning
whether Plaintiffs “would be paid legally” and “would be paid for all compensable time.” See Compl., ¶¶ 146-47.
Statements with regard to future conditions or occurrences, like Defendants’ alleged statements regarding Plaintiffs’ future
pay, are not actionable as fraud under Massachusetts law unless “at the time the defendant made the statement, he or she did
not intend to carry out the promise.” See Bolen, 754 F. Supp. at 226. Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants made any
statement that would meet this requirement.

allege that Defendants “deliberately misrepresented” the legality of their pay practices and that they
“knowingly, unlawfully and intentionally took, appropriated and converted . . . wages.” Compl., ¶¶
128, 145. Fatal to their claims, however, Plaintiffs allege not a single fact demonstrating that
Defendants in fact possessed this state of mind; nor do they provide any factual allegation remotely
sufficient to ground an inference that these outrageous charges are plausible.
The Supreme Court’s analysis in Iqbal provides guidance with respect to claims like these that
turn on a defendant’s supposed state of mind. The Court instructed that pleadings fail to state a claim
for such a cause of action if they do not “contain any factual allegation sufficient to plausibly suggest
[the alleged] state of mind.” 129 S.Ct. at 1952. Because BMC is not a natural person, it can only be
held liable for intentional torts where a particular agent responsible for the tortious action had the
requisite state of mind.19 Here, Plaintiffs make no factual allegation about any identifiable person’s
state of mind, nor do they plead facts that would lend plausibility to any other element of their fraud
and conversion claims. Plaintiffs’ reckless and scandalous allegations that BMC (and, through identical
pleadings, four other hospital systems in and around Boston) intentionally deprived more than forty
categories of workers hourly compensation is not supported by any factual allegations at all and falls
short of the Twombly and Iqbal standard.20
4.

Plaintiffs’ Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims Fail to Meet the
Heightened Pleading Standard Under Rule 9.

Even if Plaintiffs had pled their fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims with factual
allegations sufficient to survive scrutiny under Twombly, Plaintiffs fall dramatically short of the
19

See Seelig v. Harvard Coop. Soc’y., 355 Mass. 532, 541 (1969) (“A corporation has no mind. While it can be responsible
for the tortious acts that require the existence or absence of a certain state of mind if those acts are committed by an
employee, the requisite state of mind must necessarily be that of the employee.”).

20

Plaintiffs’ conversion claim fails on another ground as well. Conversion cannot be established where the property
allegedly converted consists of funds that are owed pursuant to a contract or a debtor-creditor relationship. See Gossels v.
Fleet Nat’l Bank, 453 Mass. 366, 372 (“Conversion occurs only when a defendant exercises wrongful control over specific
personal property, not a debt.”). This principle precludes Plaintiffs from recovering unpaid wages on a conversion theory.
Massachusetts courts have held, for example, that sales commissions due to a real estate broker could not be recovered on a
conversion theory. Discover Realty Corp. v. David, 2003 WL 22387138, at *3 (Mass App. Div. 2003). In addition, at least
one other court applying this rule has specifically held conversion inapplicable in cases concerning unpaid wages. See
Temmen v. Kent-Brown Chevrolet Co., 605 P.2d 95, 99-100 (Kan. 1980).

heightened pleading standard for such claims imposed by Rule 9. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)
requires that “the circumstances constituting fraud . . . shall be stated with particularity.” At a
minimum, a plaintiff must identify the person who made the misrepresentation, the time, place, and
content of the misrepresentation, and the method by which it was communicated. See McGinty v.
Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1980). Claims of negligent misrepresentation
also are subject to Rule 9(b), requiring “specification of the time, place, and content of an alleged false
representation.” See Lindner Dividend. Fund, Inc. v. Ernst & Young, 880 F. Supp. 49, 57 (D. Mass.
1995) (quoting McGinty, 633 F.2d at 228, superseded by statute on other grounds). In other words, a
plaintiff must plead the “who, what, when, and where” of an alleged fraud or negligent
misrepresentation. In addition, a plaintiff must make specific and separate allegations against each
defendant. See Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2d Cir. 1993) (“Rule 9(b) is not
satisfied where the complaint vaguely attributes the alleged fraudulent statements to ‘defendants.’”);
Sears v. Likens, 912 F.2d 889, 893 (7th Cir. 1990) (affirming dismissal because complaint was “bereft
of any detail concerning who was involved in each allegedly fraudulent activity” but, instead, “the
complaint lumped all the defendants together and [did] not specify who was involved in what activity”).
Plaintiffs have not even come close to satisfying their Rule 9(b) pleading obligations,
particularly when their cookie-cutter pleadings against BMC are compared to their allegations against
the other hospital systems. In support of their fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims, Plaintiffs
merely assert that:
153. Defendants induced Plaintiffs and Class members to accept employment with
defendants by misrepresenting to Plaintiffs and Class Members that they would be
fully paid for all compensable time.
154. There was no reasonable basis for defendants to believe these representations
because defendants had a continuing practice of failing to pay their employees for
all compensable time, including applicable premium pay. Defendants concealed
the fact that they did not pay Plaintiffs and Class Members for all compensable
time from Plaintiffs and Class Members. Plaintiffs and Class Members relied upon
defendants’ representations by performing work and services for defendants. This
reliance was reasonable, as Plaintiffs and Class Members had every right to believe
13

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

that defendants would abide by their obligations to pay for all hours worked
pursuant to the [sic] Mass. Gen. Law [sic] Ch. [sic] 149 §§ 148, 150 and Mass.
Gen. Law [sic] Ch. [sic] 151 §§ 1A, 1B and common law.
155. As a direct and proximate cause of defendants’ fraud and negligent
misrepresentations Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered damages because
they were not compensated for all compensable time that they worked both under
and in excess of forty [sic] per week.
Compl., ¶¶ 153-155. Plaintiffs fail to identify any of the following elements of a particularized
pleading of fraud: the specific content of the representations alleged to be false, who committed the
alleged fraud or misrepresentation, when it happened, or where it happened. Nor do Plaintiffs make
specific and separate allegations against any defendant in this case. Instead, Plaintiffs’ fraud and
negligent misrepresentation allegations are exactly the sort of bare, conclusory allegations that the
federal courts have rejected.21
5.

Plaintiffs’ Misrepresentation and Estoppel Claims Fail to Identify Any
Promise on Which Plaintiffs Could Have Relied.

Plaintiffs’ negligent misrepresentation (Count IX), equitable estoppel (Count X), and
promissory estoppel (Count XI) claims all fail for lack of any substantive allegation that Defendants
made an identifiable representation to anyone regarding the issues raised in the Complaint or any
allegation that would tend to make reliance on any representation by Defendants reasonable. The
doctrine of equitable estoppel requires a showing that the party asserting the estoppel claim reasonably
relied on a material misrepresentation by the opposing party. See Mimya Hosp. Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of
Health & Human Servs., 331 F.3d 178, 182 (1st Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs’ negligent misrepresentation and
promissory estoppel claims require nearly the same showing as their estoppel claim. “In order to
recover for negligent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant, in the course of his
business, made a false representation of material fact for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to rely
upon it, and that the plaintiff did rely upon the representation as true, to his damage.” See Kitner v.
21

Even where the pleadings concern “conditions of a person’s mind” that may be alleged “generally” pursuant to Rule 9, a
plaintiff may not “plead the bare elements of his cause of action, affix the label ‘general allegation’ and expect his complaint
to survive a motion to dismiss.” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1954.

CTW Transp., Inc., 53 Mass. App. Ct. 741, 749 (2002). Similarly, promissory estoppel requires a
showing that Plaintiffs reasonably relied upon a promise made by Defendants. Hall v. Horizon House
Microwave, Inc., 24 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 94 (1987).
Plaintiffs make no effort to describe any representation or misrepresentation by any defendant
that could ground their negligent misrepresentation, equitable estoppel, or promissory estoppel claims.
Instead, they parrot the elements of these legal claims with the hollow assertion that “defendants
deliberately misrepresented to plaintiffs that they were being properly paid for compensable time, even
though Plaintiffs were not receiving pay for all compensable time.” Compl., ¶ 145. Similarly,
Plaintiffs do nothing to provide factual allegations that would allow the Court to conclude plausibly that
Plaintiffs reasonably relied on any such representation or misrepresentation. Instead, Plaintiffs again
sidestep their pleading obligation and state simply, “Plaintiffs and Class Members justifiably relied on
the misrepresentations” and “[t]his reliance was reasonable, as Plaintiffs and Class Members had every
right to believe that defendants would abide by their obligations pursuant to applicable Massachusetts
law.” Compl., ¶ 150. They fail, however, to provide any information whatsoever about who made the
alleged representations, to whom they were made, or whether the context in which they were made was
such that that reliance upon the statements may have been reasonable. Because of the conclusory
nature of these allegations, Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, and promissory
claims fail to meet the Twombly standard.
6.

Plaintiffs Also Fail to Allege Facts to Support Their Remaining Equitable
Claims.

Plaintiffs assert two other common law theories of liability under the headings of money had
and received (Count VI), and quantum meruit (Count VII), both premised on the theory that Plaintiffs
are due some payment under principles of equity. To establish a cause of action for money had and
received, Plaintiffs must show that they are entitled to recover money that should not in justice be
retained by Defendants and that in equity and good conscience should be paid to Plaintiffs. Stone &

Webster Eng’g Corp. v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. of Greenfield, 345 Mass. 1, 7 (1962). Quantum
meruit applies where “[a] person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required
to make restitution to the other.” Salamon v. Terra, 394 Mass. 857, 859 (1985). Recovery on a theory
of quantum meruit requires proof that the plaintiff conferred a measurable benefit upon the defendant,
and that the defendant accepted the benefit amid circumstances in which a reasonable person would
have expected to compensate the plaintiff.22 Bolen, 747 F. Supp. at 106-07. Plaintiffs plead these
equitable doctrines only in the most general and conclusory terms, merely reciting the legal elements of
such a claim by asserting that “Defendants have received . . . financial gain under such circumstances
that, in equity and good conscience, defendants ought not to be allowed to profit.” Compl., ¶ 136.
Moreover, while Plaintiffs base their equitable claims upon their assertions that BMC failed to pay
them wages, those allegations are themselves insufficiently pled. The Court should therefore dismiss
Plaintiffs’ claims for quantum meruit and money had and received.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Claims Against the Individual Defendants Fail to Satisfy the Twombly
and Iqbal Pleading Standards.

Plaintiffs’ claims against the two individual defendants, Elaine Ullian, BMC’s President and
CEO, and James Canavan, BMC’s Director of Human Resource Operations,23 also are insufficient to
survive a motion to dismiss. The Complaint surmises that these individuals are liable to Plaintiffs and
the class they purport to represent because these individuals – apparently by virtue of assumptions
Plaintiffs make from their job titles – have “the authority to . . . make decisions that concern
defendants’ operations, including functions related to employment, human resources, training, payroll
and benefits,” as well as authority to “make decisions that concern the policies defendants adopt and the
22

Massachusetts courts often treat quantum meruit as synonymous with a cause of action for implied contract. See, e.g.,
Salamon, 394 Mass. at 859 (using terms quasi-contract, contract implied in law, and quantum meruit interchangeably to
represent cause of action for “an obligation created by law for reasons of justice”) (quotations omitted). Neither quantum
meruit nor implied contract can be invoked as a cause of action where an express contract governs the parties’ relations. See
Boswell v. Zeyphyr Lines Inc., 414 Mass. 241, 250 (1993). Plaintiffs fail to plead the lack of an express contract – in fact
they specifically assert that their employment relationship with BMC is governed by an express contract. Compl., ¶ 107; see
also Part II, infra.
23

Providing further evidence of Plaintiffs’ sloppy and boilerplate pleading style, Mr. Canavan is incorrectly identified in the
Complaint as BMC’s “Senior Human Resource Director.”

16

implementation of those policies.” Compl., ¶¶ 21-30, 38. Plaintiffs disingenuously reason that because
these individuals have “authority” to conduct these activities, they must have been “actively involved”
in the decisions at issue in this case. Compl., ¶¶ 31-35, 39-52. These layered, conclusory allegations
are not entitled to a presumption of truth, and the claims against the individual defendants cannot
survive. See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. In Iqbal, the Supreme Court
dismissed claims against the government officials individually named in a complaint because the
pleadings contained insufficient facts to tie them to the wrongdoing alleged. See 129 S.Ct. at 1952.
Here, Plaintiffs similarly identify no facts that tie the individual defendants to any alleged wrongdoing;
instead, they merely rely on their titles at BMC to infer culpability.24 Plaintiffs’ counsel have plied this
tactic of making prolix but substanceless allegations against a corporate defendant’s senior officers
before, and have seen their complaint rejected for failing to meet the Twombly and Iqbal standard.25
See Tracy v. NVR, Inc., 2009 WL 3153150, at *5-6 (W.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing Iqbal and denying motion
to amend complaint to add individual defendants as futile because “upon careful analysis, the complaint
asserts little more than because [one] was Chairman and [another] was President of [the corporate
defendant], then each must have had authority to take the actions that comprise the [test for employer
status under the FLSA], and that because each had the authority to take those actions, then each must
have in fact taken those actions”), affirmed 2009 WL 3647862 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2009).26 There is no
reason that the result should be different here, and the Court should dismiss Ms. Ullian and Mr.
Canavan from this action.
24

Apropos of this lack of specificity, Plaintiffs’ counsel have crafted nearly identical allegations against individual
defendants working for four other hospital systems in this District and numerous hospital systems elsewhere. See supra,
notes 4, 11.
25

Indeed, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations regarding the individual defendants in this action bear a striking resemblance to the
factual allegations rejected as conclusory in the Tracy case, which concerns individuals working in an entirely different
industry. See Tracy, 2009 WL 3153150, at *5-6.
26

In Tracy, the district court later also rejected the plaintiffs’ attempt to pursue claims against a senior human resources
officer as an individual defendant. The court held that the plaintiffs’ “boilerplate allegations that [the officer met] the
various prongs of the economic reality test stated solely upon information and belief and without any supporting details”
were “insufficient to raise plaintiffs’ right to relief ‘above a speculative level’ with respect to that individual’s liability as an
employer under the FLSA.” 2009 WL 3647862 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2009) (attached as Exhibit B).

FEDERAL LABOR LAW PREEMPTS PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS.
Plaintiffs and the majority of the other BMC employees they purport to represent are unionized.

These unionized employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, which contain detailed
provisions governing breaks, overtime compensation, premium pay, on-call pay, shift differentials, shift
assignments, fulfilling staffing needs, and training.
With very few exceptions, state law plays no role in resolving disputes arising out of unionized,
private employment settings. Comprehensive federal statutes dominate the labor law landscape. The
National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 141, et seq., grants employees the right to join
unions, governs representation elections, mandates good faith collective bargaining once a union has
been elected, creates administrative procedures to investigate and resolve labor disputes, and delegates
the investigation and resolution of labor disputes to the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”).
Section 301 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a), gives federal courts jurisdiction to resolve disputes
arising out of contracts reached by unions and employers in the NLRA bargaining process. It is these
two federal statutes, not Massachusetts law, on which the instant case turns.
Courts have recognized two separate doctrines of federal preemption that bar state law claims
asserted on behalf of unionized employees. “Section 301 preemption” preserves the federal character
of labor agreements, see Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 (1957), by rejecting state
law claims that turn on the interpretation of those agreements. In addition, Garmon preemption
preserves the exclusive province of the NLRB to adjudicate violations of the NLRA by forbidding
courts from hearing claims involving conduct that the NLRA even “arguably” prohibits. San Diego
Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959). Each of these forms of preemption
independently serves to bar the claims in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
A.

Section 301 Preempts Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims.

Where the resolution of a state law claim substantially depends on an analysis of the terms of a
CBA, that claim must be brought, if at all, under Section 301 of the LMRA. A state law claim

18

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

Page 19 of 29

requiring interpretation of a CBA that asserts any cause of action other than a contract claim under
Section 301 is preempted and must be dismissed.27 See, e.g., Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S.
202, 220 (1985); Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, 390 U.S. 557, 559-61 (1968); Flibotte v. Pa. Truck
Lines, Inc., 131 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1997) (Section 301 preempts claim “if it alleges conduct that
arguably constitutes a breach of a duty that arises pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement” or “if
its resolution arguably hinges upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.”) (internal
quotations omitted). Plaintiffs’ claims in this case depend on an interpretation and application of the
CBAs between BMC and the unions that represent its employees, and those claims cannot survive here.
Plaintiffs’ state law statutory wage claims necessitate an interpretation of the CBAs to determine
how employees should be paid for the hours that they allegedly worked under the various provisions
governing scheduling, breaks, training, and pay contained in the collective bargaining agreements. The
First Circuit’s Adames v. Executive Airlines, Inc., 258 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 2001), is controlling. In that
case, a flight attendant argued that her employer violated Puerto Rico wage and hour law because it did
not pay her for all hours worked. The court held that her claims were preempted by the Railway Labor
Act28 because it was impossible to determine whether the plaintiff was paid for all hours worked
without interpreting the CBA. The court would first need to interpret the agreement to determine how
many hours the employee “worked,” and then determine both base and hourly pay in order to adjudicate
any damages. 258 F.3d at 13. Courts have applied the same reasoning to dismiss Massachusetts

27

The preemption doctrine was developed to avoid differing interpretations of the parties’ rights and obligations. See Local
174, Teamsters of Am. v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95, 103-04 (1962). As the Supreme Court explained in Lingle v. Norge
Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.:
If the resolution of a state-law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective-bargaining agreement, the
application of state law (which might lead to inconsistent results since there could be as many state-law
principles as there are States) is preempted and federal labor-law principles – necessarily uniform
throughout the Nation – must be employed to resolve the dispute.
486 U.S. 399, 405-406 (1988). Indeed, “[s]tate law does not exist as an independent source of private rights to enforce
collective bargaining contracts.” Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 394.

28

Although Adames was decided under the Railway Labor Act, the same analysis is applicable to preemption under Section
301 of the LMRA. See Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 263 (1994); Adames, 258 F.3d at 12, n.3.

statutory wage claims as preempted. Mitchell v. Globe Newspaper Co., Inc., 602 F. Supp. 2d 258 (D.
Mass. 2009) (claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148 preempted by Section 301).
Plaintiffs’ state law wage claims here are similar to the preempted claims in Adames. To assess
Plaintiffs’ claims that BMC’s alleged “policy” of automatically deducting thirty minutes of time per
day for a meal break violated Massachusetts law, the Court would have to interpret the CBAs’
provisions governing meal and rest breaks, shift differentials, pay for employees who have been
temporarily assigned, and premium pay. The CBAs require a rest break for a certain number of hours
worked,29 but they also recognize that sometimes employees will have to work during their break.30 If
so, the agreements generally provide that the employees will be paid.31 The rate at which employees
are paid, in turn, is governed by a welter of CBA provisions dealing with shift differentials,32 pay for
unscheduled shifts,33 pay for assignment to charge nurse and nurse manager positions,34 pay for

then determine whether and when each employee was entitled to a break, and, if so, the rate he should
have been paid for working through his break, and then, finally, determine whether BMC did or did not
pay each employee for all hours worked. To see why, the Court need only consider the example of a
nurse who was on call on a holiday after attending meetings as a union representative the previous day,
reported to work in response to a call to work in a different job classification, and continued working
through one or more unscheduled shifts, so that the nurse ended up being entitled to daily and weekly
overtime under the CBA. In such a case, a CBA interpreter (commonly called an “arbitrator”) would
have to figure out how many hours the nurse “worked,” how many breaks the nurse was entitled to, and
at what rate the nurse was entitled to be paid (e.g., whether the nurse would be entitled to “pyramid” the
various entitlements over and above her standard wage rate as set forth in the collective bargaining
agreement). The only way one could determine these questions would be to sit not as an Article III
judge but as a CBA arbitrator.
Plaintiffs’ state common law claims also would require interpretation of the CBAs that cover
BMC’s employees. Their contract claims would require the Court to interpret the CBAs because the
contracts Plaintiffs claim BMC breached are those CBAs.44 Plaintiffs’ claims for fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, and conversion also would require the Court to interpret the CBAs. Such claims
depend on proof that BMC breached those CBAs, because if BMC complied with the agreements, then
it misrepresented nothing and did not wrongly “convert” Plaintiffs’ wages. See DiGiantommaso v.
Globe Newspaper Co., Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58825 (D. Mass. 2009) (unjust enrichment,
promissory estoppel, conversion, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
claims based on failure to pay wages for time worked during breaks preempted by § 301); Hayes v.
Aramark Sports, LLC, C.A. No. 08-10700 (D. Mass. Mar. 30, 2009) (claims for violations of Mass.
Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148, violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A, quantum meruit/unjust
44

As discussed below, to the extent that Plaintiffs purport to assert claims based on something other than the CBAs, those
claims are subject to Garmon preemption.

enrichment, and breach of contract preempted by § 301). The resolution of Plaintiffs’ promissory
estoppel, assumpsit, and quantum meruit/unjust enrichment claims also require analysis of the CBAs
because these claims rely on the notion of a promise or implied contract. See Sections I(A)(5) and (6),
supra. It is black-letter law that a court will not imply a contract where there is an express contract
covering the same subject. See, e.g., York v. Zurich Scudder Invs., Inc., 66 Mass. App. Ct. 610 (2006).
Thus, the Court here cannot determine whether there is an express contract covering the same subject
matter as any alleged implied contract without interpreting the CBAs.
Each of Plaintiffs’ state law claims would require the Court to engage in an analysis of the wage
and hour provisions of the CBAs that set the terms and conditions of employment for members of the
putative classes that Plaintiffs purport to represent. Those claims are preempted by § 301 and must be
dismissed.
B.

Garmon Preemption Requires Dismissal of Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims.

To the extent Plaintiffs contend that their claims are based on contracts other than the CBAs,
those claims are subject to Garmon preemption. The Garmon rule states that “when an activity is
arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, the states as well as the federal
courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the NLRB if the danger of state interference with
national labor policy is to be averted.” Chaulk Servs., Inc. v. Mass. Comm’n Against Discrimination,
70 F.3d 1361, 1364 (1st Cir. 1995).
An employer may not “refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees”
regarding mandatory subjects of bargaining. 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5); see NLRB v. Wooster Div. of BorgWarner Corp., 356 U.S. 342 (1958). Wages, hours, and overtime are all mandatory subjects of
bargaining. See 29 U.S.C. § 158(d) (“to bargain collectively is . . . to meet at reasonable times and
confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment”). An
employer may not negotiate individual contracts with employees governing wages, hours, and overtime
– mandatory subjects of bargaining – without union consent. See Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 50 F.3d
23

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

1041 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“employers are positively prohibited from seeking to bargain with individual
employees, absent consent from the union”); Wood v. Nat’l Basketball Ass’n, 809 F.2d 954 (2d Cir.
1987) (“Once an exclusive representative has been selected, the individual employee is forbidden by
federal law from negotiating directly with the employer absent the representative’s consent.”).
Thus, if this Court were called upon to conclude the existence of and enforce such individual
agreements, it would permit what the NLRA forbids. Each of the non-statutory claims in Plaintiffs’
Complaint are premised on the assertion that BMC promised to pay them for all hours worked and then
did not do so. Bypassing an employee’s union to directly deal with the employee on the subject of
wages and hours is an unfair labor practice and, making such individual agreements unenforceable. See
J.I. Case Co. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 332, 337 (1944) (“[i]ndividual contracts no matter what the
circumstances that justify their execution or what their terms, may not be availed of to defeat or delay
the procedures prescribed by the National Labor Relations Act looking to collective bargaining”).
Since it is the NLRB, and not this Court, that has “the exclusive power to decide whether unfair labor
practices have been committed and to determine the action the employer must take to remove or avoid
the consequences of his unfair labor practice,” Nat’l Licorice Co. v. NLRB, 309 U.S. 350, 365 (1940),
Garmon preemption bars Plaintiffs’ claims as to BMC’s unionized employees.
III.

PLAINTIFFS’ STATUTORY CLAIMS FAIL BECAUSE BMC’S EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO THE
STATE HOSPITAL EXEMPTION.
Even if Plaintiffs had pled facts sufficient to substantiate a claim under the Wage Act or the

Minimum Wage Law, that claim would fail because BMC’s employees are exempted from coverage
under those statutes. Plaintiffs’ failure to appreciate these state law exemptions is further evidence of
their disregard for rules of pleading, and proof that their campaign against BMC is merely part of the
assault Plaintiffs’ counsel have launched against hospitals around the country. The Massachusetts
Minimum Wage Law expressly states that its overtime provisions “shall not be applicable to any
employee who is employed . . . in a hospital, sanitorium, convalescent or nursing home, infirmary, rest

24

home or charitable home for the aged.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A(16) (emphasis added). The
statute’s industry exemptions, including the hospital exemption, are premised on the rationale that jobs
within the exempted institutions “may require continuous service by a particular person beyond the
confines of an eight hour schedule.” Fitz-Inn Auto Parks, Inc. v. Comm’r of Labor & Indus., 350 Mass.
39, 42 (1965).45 There can be no doubt that the exemption found in §1A(16) applies in this case.
Boston Medical Center is a hospital under any definition, and Plaintiffs affirmatively assert as much in
their Complaint. See Compl., ¶¶ 3-4 (“Boston Medical Center is . . . engaged in the operation of a
hospital . . . .”).
Likewise, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148, states that “[the Wage Act] shall not apply to an
employee of a hospital which is supported in part by contributions from the commonwealth or from any
city or town, nor to an employee of an incorporated hospital which provides treatment to patients free
of charge, or which is conducted as a public charity. . . .” By the plain language of this section, BMC’s
employees are doubly exempted from coverage because BMC is both a public charity and a publicly
funded hospital.46 Plaintiffs’ cookie-cutter pleadings, recycled from lawsuits in New York and
Pennsylvania, simply do not work in Massachusetts. Plaintiffs’ statutory claims must therefore be
dismissed.

45

While there are no reported court decisions regarding the hospital exemption, the Division of Occupational Safety
(“DOS”), which is charged with administering the Minimum Wage Law, opined in a 2001 letter that employees of a drug
and alcohol treatment center were exempt from overtime under the provision, provided that the treatment center fell within
the definition of a “sanitorium.” DOS Op. Ltr. MW-2001-016 (Nov. 19, 2001) (attached as Exhibit C). In that letter, DOS
also noted that it understood the treatment center not to be “operating within a hospital,” indicating that if it were, the
exemption would apply regardless of whether the center met the definition of a sanitorium. See id. In addition, DOS has
interpreted the similarly worded hotel exemption found in § 1A(12) to “include all workers who work in some aspect of
hotel operations . . . within the physical confines of a hotel property.” DOS Op. Ltr. MW-2006-001 (Mar. 10, 2006)
(attached as Exhibit D). There is no dispute here, and the Complaint, itself, alleges that BMC is a “hospital.” See Compl.,
¶¶ 3-4.
46

See 2008 Mass. Acts. ch. 302 (appropriating $64 million in state funds for the “public-service hospital operated by the
Boston Medical Center Corporation”); I.R.S. Publication 78, Cumulative List of Organizations described in Section 170(c)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, available at http://www.irs.gov/app/pub-78/ (listing Boston Medical Center as
organization eligible to receive tax-deductable charitable donations).

THE MASSACHUSETTS WAGE ACT AND MINIMUM WAGE LAW PREEMPT PLAINTIFFS’
DERIVATIVE COMMON LAW CLAIMS.
Plaintiffs’ numerous common law claims, all of which derive from and improperly duplicate

Plaintiffs’ Wage Act and Minimum Wage Law claims, fail because state wage statutes preempt
common law claims that are grounded in the same facts as the statutory claims. Common law claims
founded on duties that are “wholly the creation of statute” are preempted by the statute. Sch. Comm. of
Boston v. Reilly, 362 Mass. 334, 338-9 (1972). “Where a statute has been enacted seemingly intended
to cover the whole subject to which it relates, including a remedy for its infraction, other provisions of
the common law, including such as are remedial in nature, are thereby superseded.” Sch. Comm. v. City
of Lowell, 265 Mass. 353, 356 (1928); see also Dobin v. CIOView Corp., No. 2001-00108, 2003 WL
22454602, at *9 (Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 29, 2003) (Gants, J.) (where Legislature “has provided a
statutory cause of action to an at-will employee who has been discharged for exercising [] statutory
rights, there is no need to add a common law remedy”). Indeed, in four recent cases, courts have
applied this reasoning and dismissed common law claims that are premised on violations of
Massachusetts wage statutes. See Mouiny v. Comm. Flats Dev. Corp., No. SUCV-2006-1115-BLS1
(Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 20, 2008) (Gants, J.), pp. 14-15 (attached as Exhibit E); Hernandez v. Hyatt
Corp., No. SUCV-2005-0569-BLS1 (Mass. Super. Ct. May 4, 2009) (Hinkle, J.), p. 8 (attached as
Exhibit F); Godt v. Anthony’s Pier 4, Inc., No. SUCV-2007-3919-BLS1 (Mass. Super. Ct. Mar. 24,
2009) (Hinkle, J.), p. 8 (attached as Exhibit G); DePina v. Marriott Int., Inc, No. SUCV-2003-05434-G
(Mass. Super. Ct. July 28, 2009) (Henry, J.), pp. 18-20 (attached as Exhibit H).47 As in this case, the
common law claims in Mouiny, Hernandez, Godt, and DePina all derived from and improperly
duplicated wage claims.48 The court in each of those cases dismissed each of the common law claims
47

Each of these cases alleged violations of the Massachusetts Tip Statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A, which contains
the same enforcement scheme and penalties as the Wage Act. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, §§ 27C, 150.

48

In addition to their claims under the Tip Statute, the plaintiffs in Mouiny asserted claims for declaratory judgment, failure
to pay wages, restitution, money had and received, equitable restitution, breach of contract, and a request for accounting.
Mouiny, n.1. The plaintiffs in Hernandez asserted a request for declaratory judgment and claims for money had and
received, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and a request for accounting. In Godt, the plaintiffs

26

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

premised on alleged violations of the state wage statutes. In Mouiny, then-Superior Court Justice Gants
noted that if the plaintiffs prevailed on their wage claim, they would be entitled to restitution, with
interest, as well as the remedies in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 27C – clearly a situation “[w]here a
statute has been enacted . . . to cover the whole subject to which it relates, including a remedy for its
infraction” and in which “other provisions of common law, including such as are remedial in nature, are
thereby superseded.” Mouiny, p. 15 (quotation omitted); see also Hernandez, p. 8 (dismissing common
law claims based on reasoning in Mouiny); Godt, p. 11 (same). Here, Plaintiffs’ common law claims
fail for the same reason.49
Plaintiffs’ common law claims are based on the same alleged facts as their statutory claims –
namely, that BMC failed to pay Plaintiffs and putative class members for all hours worked. Indeed, in
their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs’ only specific request for damages seeks “an award of the value of
Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ unpaid wages, including fringe benefits” without any reference to other
damages stemming from their common law claims. Further, their request for injunctive relief seeks to
enjoin BMC “from engaging in the aforementioned pay violations.”
Plaintiffs’ motive in bringing these duplicative claims is clear: they seek to extend the statute of
limitations, thereby potentially garnering a larger class of employees and a longer period of time over
which to seek damages.50 The Legislature’s intent to preempt common law claims seeking to enforce

asserted claims for quantum meruit, intentional interference with contractual and/or advantageous relations, breach of
contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion and unjust enrichment. Godt, p. 1.
49

In an analogous context, courts have held that common law counts that depend on establishing a statutory violation of the
FLSA are preempted by that statute, on the grounds that the FLSA provides an elaborate enforcement scheme that precludes
duplicative common law claims with potentially conflicting remedies or statutes of limitations. See, e.g., Anderson v. Sara
Lee Corp., 508 F.3d 181, 194-195 (4th Cir. 2007) (holding plaintiffs’ breach of contract, negligence, and fraud claims
precluded by FLSA’s exclusive enforcement scheme); Chen v. Street Beat Sportswear, Inc., 364 F. Supp. 2d 269, 293
(E.D.N.Y. 2005) (holding that FLSA preempted plaintiffs’ negligence claims under New York law). As these courts have
recognized, where plaintiffs premise their common law claims on the exact same set of facts as their statutory claims, the
statutory scheme preempts the common law claims. The same analysis applies to the dismissal of common law claims based
on FLSA preemption in the class action context. See Anderson, 508 F.3d at 182; Sorenson v. CHT Corp., 2004 WL 442638,
at *1 (N.D. Ill. 2004); Morgan v. SpeakEasy, LLC, 2007 WL 2757170, at *1 (N.D. Ill.2007); Moeck, 2006 WL 42368, at *1
(D.N.J. 2006).
50

The statute of limitations on Plaintiffs’ contract claim is six years, and the statute of limitations for Plaintiffs’ other
common law claims is three years.

Case 1:09-cv-11724-NMG

rights under the state’s wage laws is evident from the fact that it promulgated statutes that impose a
comprehensive enforcement scheme with specialized remedies, including provisions for multiple
damages and attorneys’ fees, alongside a three-year statute of limitations for violations of the Wage Act
and a two-year statute of limitations for violations of the Minimum Wage Law. These enhanced
statutory remedies cannot be sought in addition to common law claims for single damages over a period
longer than the Legislature has established for such wage claims. The Court should not permit
Plaintiffs to perform an end-run around the Legislature’s intent by recasting their statutory wage claims
(with their two- and three-year statutes of limitations) as contract claims in an attempt to leverage a sixyear limitations period.
Because Plaintiffs’ common law claims are based on the same factual assertions and seek the
same measure of damages as their statutory wage claims, they are preempted, and the Court therefore
should dismiss them.
V.

PLAINTIFFS’ ESTOPPEL CLAIM SHOULD BE DISMISSED.
In addition to its pleading deficiency, Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claim (Count X) fails

because Plaintiffs misconstrue the nature of the estoppel doctrine. Equitable estoppel is a purely
defensive concept: “It is available only for protection, and cannot be used as a weapon of assault.
Dickerson v. Colgrove, 100 U.S. 578, 580-81 (1879) (emphasis added); see also Kuznyetsov v. West
Penn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc., No. 09-379 (W.D. Pa., filed July 20, 2009) (docket no. 118)
(“estoppel serves as a shield and not a sword”). Numerous courts have recognized that because it
cannot be used offensively, estoppel does not – indeed, cannot – give rise to a cause of action. See ValLand Farms, Inc., v. Third Nat’l Bank in Knoxville, 937 F.2d 1110, 1115 (6th Cir. 1991) (“equitable
estoppel does not create a cause of action under Tennessee law”); Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth. v.
Cornerstone Group XXII, LLC, 176 P.3d 737, 741 (Colo. 2007) (“the doctrine of equitable estoppel is
not a cause of action at all, but rather a defensive doctrine”); Hoye v. Westfield Ins. Co., 487 N.W.2d
838, 842 (Mich. 1992) (“the general rule is that equitable estoppel is a doctrine, not a cause of action
28

. . . [and it] therefore provides no remedy such as damages”); see also Adrian v. Mesirow Fin.
Structured Settlements, LLC, 2009 WL 2596508, at *1 n.3 (D.P.R. 2009) (“Plaintiff seems to confuse
theories of liability with other sorts of assertions in her amended complaint: she lists as [a] claim . . .
‘equitable estoppel’ [which is a] common theor[y] of defense.”). By its very nature, Plaintiffs’ estoppel
“cause of action” fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and for that reason it should
be dismissed.

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be granted in its entirety.
