Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), Defendants Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, Wynn Resorts

dismissing Plaintiffs Peter Spalluto's ("Spalluto"), William Norkunas' ("Norkunas") and the

21

Disabled Rights Action Committee's ("DRAC") (collectively "Plaintiffs") First Amended

22

Complaint. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint suffers from the same fatal infirmities as their

23

Original Complaint. As demonstrated below, all of Plaintiffs' claims fails as a matter of law

24

because Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden of establishing a "case or controversy" with respect to

25

their claims for injunctive relief, the sole remedy available under Title III of the Americans with

26

Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Alternatively, Wynn seeks an order requiring Plaintiffs to provide a

I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

3

On or about January 24, 2007, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against Wynn.

(See

4

Plaintiffs' Complaint (Docket No. 1)). Because Plaintiffs' Complaint only vaguely alleged that

5

Wynn violated the ADA due to the alleged existence of "discriminatory conditions" at "Wynn

6

Las Vegas," Wynn filed a Motion to Dismiss because such allegations fall far short of stating a

7

claim under Title III of the ADA. (Docket No. 6-1). Plaintiffs did not oppose Wynn's motion.

8

Rather, Plaintiffs acknowledged the fatal inadequacies of their Complaint and filed their First

9

Amended Complaint. (Docket No. 8). However, as discussed in detail below, Plaintiffs' First

10

Amended Complaint not only fails to correct the fatal pleading deficiencies of their Original

11

Complaint, but it also creates even more problems. After two attempts, Plaintiffs have failed to

12

state a claim under Title III of the ADA. Plaintiffs should not be allowed another try.

13

II.

ALLEGATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS' FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

14

Like their Original Complaint, Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint vaguely alleges that

15

the "Wynn Las Vegas" is not in compliance with Title III of the ADA. 1 Based on the alleged

16

ADA violations, Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction requiring Wynn to cease operating Wynn

17

Las Vegas unless and until the facility is in ADA compliance. (See id. at p. 8). Plaintiffs' true

18

motive in bringing this action is revealed by their request for a "disgorgement of Defendants'

19

profits associated with the Defendants' use of the Wynn Las Vegas while Wynn Las Vegas is

20

inaccessible." (Id. at p. 9).

21

23
24
25

28

In their Motion to Dismiss, Wynn informed Plaintiffs and this Court that neither Wynn
Resorts Limited nor Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC owns or operates the Wynn Las Vegas; that is,
neither of these named defendants are a proper party to this action. Yet, for some inexplicable
reason, Plaintiffs continue to maintain this action against Wynn Resorts Limited and Wynn
Resorts Holdings, LLC.

A.

2

Plaintiff Norkunas is, by his own admission, a professional ADA "tester." (See Ex. "1"

3

at ¶ 3). 2 Norkunas alleges that he "encountered discriminatory conditions (in, inter alia, the

4

seating arrangements for theatrical performances, the lack of accessible routes, inaccessible

5

counters, and inaccessible restrooms) in February of 2006." (See Plaintiffs' First Amended

6

Complaint at ¶ 9(a)). Norkunas also alleges that he "again encountered discriminatory conditions

7

at Wynn Las Vegas on July 4, 2006." (See id.). Given that Norkunas alleges that he actually

8

"encountered" the alleged discriminatory conditions, he should be able to specifically identify

9

each and every alleged ADA violation and its location. However, Norkunas fails to do so.

10

Instead, Norkunas identifies a collection of exceedingly broad categories of alleged ADA

11

violations and, with two exceptions, provides no indication whatsoever of the location of the

12

alleged discriminatory conditions. 3

Whether Norkunas was acting in his capacity as an ADA "tester" when he allegedly
encountered the alleged discriminatory conditions at the Wynn Las Vegas is highly relevant in
determining whether Norkunas has standing to maintain this action. See, e.g., Harris v.
Stonecrest Care Auto Center, LLC, 472 F. Supp. 2d 1208, 1216-17 (S.D. Cal. 2007) (holding that
an ADA "tester" lacked standing to bring an ADA action); see also Molski v. Kahn Winery, 405
F. Supp. 2d 1160, 1164-68 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (holding that litigation history is relevant in
determining standing); Brother v. Tiger Partner, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 2d 1368, 1374-75 (M.D. Fla.
2004) (same).

Wynn Las Vegas features 2,716 guest rooms and suits, 111,000 square foot casino,
22 food and beverage outlets, an 18-hole golf course, approximately 223,000 square feet of
meeting space, and approximately 76,000 square feet of retail space. (See http://phx.corporateir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=132059&p=irol-IRHome).
Given the size of Wynn Las Vegas,
identification of the location of the alleged ADA violations is critical to giving Wynn fair and
adequate notice of the alleged ADA violations so that Wynn can investigate Plaintiffs' allegations
and make any remediations that are necessary and/or appropriate. Also, as discussed infra,
requiring Plaintiffs to identify the precise location of the alleged ADA violations is appropriate
given that Plaintiffs only have standing (if at all) to sue for ADA violations that they actually
encountered or have knowledge of.
4

Plaintiffs (and Tamara Thompson on behalf of DRAC) all use the qualifying language
"include, but not limited to" when generally identifying the discriminatory conditions that they
allegedly encountered at Wynn Las Vegas. (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶¶ (9(a),
9(b) and 9(c)). However, as demonstrated infra, Plaintiffs only have standing (if at all) to sue for
those alleged ADA violations specifically identified in their First Amended Complaint.

B.

Relevant Allegations Relating To Plaintiff Spalluto.

2

Plaintiff Spalluto alleges that he "encountered discriminatory conditions at Wynn

3

Las Vegas in August of 2006." (See id. at ¶ 9(b)). The discriminatory conditions allegedly

4

encountered by Spalluto "include, but are not limited to no ADA required disabled theater seating

5

(which condition is not compliant with ADAAG 4.1.3(19), 4.33.3, 4.33.4)." (Id.) (emphasis in

6

original). Spalluto also alleges that he travels to Las Vegas more than once a year and that he

7

"desires the ability to access on a non-discriminatory basis the goods and services available to the

8

public at Wynn Las Vegas." (See id. at ¶ 13) (emphasis in original). Like Norkunas, Spalluto

9

fails to allege any definite or concrete plan to return to Wynn Las Vegas. (See generally id.).

10

Importantly, Spalluto concedes in his First Amended Complaint that he, like Norkunas, is

11

a professional ADA plaintiff. (See id. at ¶ 3). In fact, Spalluto has filed no less than six (6) ADA

12

lawsuits in this judicial district alone. (See Exs. "2" through "7"). Among the various defendants

13

in those actions is Emerald Suits (Ex. "2"), Travelodge Ambassador Strip Inn (Ex. "4"), Gold

14

Rush Casino and Hotel, LLC (Ex. "5"), and 155 East Tropicana, LLC (i.e., Hooters Casino Hotel)

15

(Ex. "6"). All of Spalluto's ADA complaints, including his complaint against Wynn, include an

16

allegation that he "plans to return to the property to avail himself of the goods and services

17

offered to the public at the property." (See Ex. "2" at ¶ 6, Ex. "4" at ¶ 6, Ex. "5" at ¶ 6 and Ex. "6"

18

at ¶ 6). By all accounts, Spalluto's alleged "plans to return" to each of the properties, including

19

Wynn Las Vegas, are disingenuous at best.
Relevant Allegations Relating To DRAC.

20

C.

21

By virtue of the First Amended Complaint, DRAC is now a party plaintiff in this action.

22

(See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶ 4). In an effort to manufacture standing on behalf

23

of DRAC, Plaintiffs alleges that Tamara Thompson (allegedly a member of DRAC) visited Wynn

24

Las Vegas on March 21, 2007, more than three (3) months after Plaintiffs filed their Original

25

Complaint, and encountered discriminatory conditions. (See id. at ¶ 9(c)). Thompson alleges that

26

the alleged discriminatory conditions that she encountered "include, but are not limited to":

27

(1) Counters with cash registers that were not lowered for wheelchair
access (not compliant with ADAAG 4.1, 4.32.4, 7.2); and

28
6

Case 2:07-cv-00096-RLH-PAL Document 15

(2) Placement of objects so as to render inaccessible a lowered
counter and a bathroom mirror (thus making those elements of Wynn
Las Vegas noncompliant with ADAAG 4.22 and 7.2).

(Id.).

4

Like Plaintiffs Norkunas and Spalluto, Thompson is also a professional ADA plaintiff. In

5

fact, Thompson has instituted multiple ADA lawsuits in this judicial district in her own name and

6

on behalf of DRAC. (See Exs. "8" through "10"). 6 There is little doubt that, given the timing of

7

her alleged visit to Wynn Las Vegas, Thompson visited Wynn Las Vegas for the sole purpose of

8

bringing this action. Moreover, like the rest of the Plaintiffs, Thompson does not allege any

9

definite or concrete plan to return to Wynn Las Vegas. (See generally Plaintiffs' First Amended

10

Complaint). 7

11

III.

12

PLAINTIFFS CANNOT MEET THEIR BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING A "CASE
OR CONTROVERSY" WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF.

13

A.

14

Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), a claim may be dismissed for lack of subject matter

15

jurisdiction. When subject matter jurisdiction is challenged, the plaintiff has the burden of

16

proving jurisdiction in order to survive the motion. See Tosco Corp. v. Communities For a Better

17

Env't, 236 F.3d 495, 499 (9th Cir. 2001). Attacks on jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) can be

18

either facial, confining the inquiry to the allegations in the complaint, or factual, permitting the

19

court to look beyond the complaint. See Savage v. Glendale Union High School, 343 F.3d 1036,

20

1039 n.2 (9th Cir. 2003). As demonstrated below, Plaintiffs have not (and cannot) meet their

Standard For Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(1).

21
22
6

23
24
25
26
27
28

Thompson has also filed multiple lawsuits in her own name and on behalf of DRAC
under the Fair Housing Act. (See Exs. "11" through "13"). In those lawsuits, as is likely here,
Thompson admits that she acted as a "tester" for the sole purpose of filing suit. (See Exs. "11" at
¶ 17, "12" at ¶ 16, and "13" at ¶ 16).
7

Plaintiffs further attempt to create standing for DRAC by alleging that Robert Lee,
allegedly another member of DRAC, "has knowledge of the discriminatory conditions at Wynn
Las Vegas." (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶ 14). However, Plaintiffs do not
allege: (1) that Mr. Lee ever visited Wynn Las Vegas; (2) that Mr. Lee has any definite or
concrete plan to visit Wynn Las Vegas; or (3) identify a single "discriminatory condition" that
Mr. Lee allegedly has knowledge of. (See id.). Absent such allegations, Mr. Lee can hardly
create standing on behalf of DRAC.

jurisdiction.

4

Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate That There Is A Realistic And Immediate

U.S. Const. art. III.

To establish the existence of a case or controversy, a plaintiff must

7

demonstrate (1) an injury in fact; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the conduct

8

complained of; and (3) that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable court ruling.

9

See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992). "The party

10

invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements."

11

112 S. Ct. at 2136. Plaintiffs cannot meet this heavy burden.

Id. at 561,

12

In order for Plaintiffs to demonstrate an actual case or controversy to seek injunctive

13

relief, 8 Plaintiffs must demonstrate "a real and immediate threat of future injury by the

14

defendant[s]." City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105, 107 n.8, 103 S. Ct. 1167, 1168 n.8

15

(1983); see also Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860-61 (9th Cir. 2001) ("[W]here, as here, a

16

plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief, he must demonstrate 'that he is realistically threatened

17

by a repetition of [the violation].'") (emphasis in original). "Past exposure to illegal conduct does

18

not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief, however, if

19

unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects."

20

495-96, 94 S. Ct. 669, 676 (1974). "It is the reality of the threat of repeated injury that is relevant

21

to the standing inquiry, not the plaintiff's subjective apprehensions." Id. at 107 n.8, 103 S. Ct. at

22

1668 n.8 (emphasis in original).

O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488,

23

Additionally, an alleged past violation of the ADA standing alone is insufficient to give

24

rise to an Article III case or controversy for injunctive relief. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105, 103 S.

25

"Damages are not recoverable under Title III of the ADA – only injunctive relief is
available for violations of Title III." Wander v. Kaus, 304 F.3d 856, 858 (9th Cir. 2002). For this
reason, Plaintiffs' request for damages in the form of "the disgorgement of Defendants' profits"
must be dismissed as a matter of law.

135 F.3d 1260, 1275 (9th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). The United State Supreme Court's

decision in Lyons, a leading case on standing, is instructive.

Rather, "[t]he likelihood of the injury recurring must be

Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Lab.,

7

In Lyons, the plaintiff was stopped for a traffic violation wherein the police officers

8

allegedly applied a chokehold on plaintiff, without any provocation or resistance, rendering

9

plaintiff unconscious. 461 U.S. at 97-98, 103 S. Ct. 1663. Plaintiff thereafter filed suit against

10

the City of Los Angeles seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction barring the use of

11

chokeholds. Id. The Supreme Court, applying the principles of law above, held that the plaintiff

12

failed to demonstrate a case or controversy that would justify the equitable relief sought. Id.

13

at 105, 103 S. Ct. at 1667. The Supreme Court reasoned that plaintiff's allegations that he had

14

been illegally choked by the city police officers, which presumably gave plaintiff standing to

15

claim damages, "does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be

16

stopped for a traffic violation . . . by an officer or officers who would illegally choke him into

17

unconsciousness without any provocation or resistance on his part." Id. Simply put, the Supreme

18

Court held that because the plaintiff made no showing that he was realistically threatened by a

19

repetition of the alleged chokehold incident, "he has not met the requirements for seeking an

20

injunction in a federal court. . . ." Id. at 109, 103 S. Ct. at 1669. See Fortyune v. Am. Multi-

21

Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1081 (9th Cir. 2004) (applying Lyons in determining standing for

22

claims brought under Title III of ADA).

23

In the context of the ADA, a plaintiff may establish the injury in fact requirement of

24

standing (i.e., a "concrete and particularized" and "actual or imminent" injury) in two ways:

25

(1) that the plaintiff personally encountered the barrier complained of; or (2) the plaintiff has

26

actual knowledge of the barrier complained of and has been deterred from visiting the public

27

accommodation because of the barrier.

2

plaintiff has suffered an injury if the "plaintiff has actually become aware of the discriminatory

3

conditions existing at a public accommodation, and is thereby deterred from visiting or

4

patronizing that accommodation. . . .")). Put another way, an ADA plaintiff must establish, at a

5

minimum, that he has knowledge of the alleged ADA violation and is deterred from visiting the

433 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1141 (S.D. Cal. 2006). But, in either case, an ADA plaintiff must also

10

Here, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that there is a real and immediate threat that they will

the absence of injunctive relief." Midgett, 254 F.3d at 850 (emphasis in original).

16

Courts routinely find no standing for claims for injunctive relief under the ADA (i.e., the

17

sole remedy under Title III) where, as here, a plaintiff fails to show a real or immediate threat of

18

future injury; that is, that plaintiff will again visit the property and again encounter the allege

19

ADA violations. See, e.g., Deck v. Am. Haw. Cruises, Inc., 121 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1298-99

20

(D. Haw. 2000) (finding no standing under ADA because plaintiff failed to allege any plans to use

21

defendant's services in the future); see also El Torito Restaurants, Inc., 1997 WL 714866, at *5

22

(finding no standing under ADA because plaintiff failed to allege that she intended to return to the

23

restaurant); O'Brien v. Werner Bus Lines, Inc., No. 94-6862, 1996 WL 82484, *5 (E.D. Pa.

24

Feb. 27, 1996) (finding no standing under the ADA because plaintiffs failed to show "that they

25

are likely to use Werner buses in the near future or, if they do us them, that Werner is likely to

26

violate their rights under the ADA again.").

27

In determining whether a plaintiff's likelihood of returning to a particular establishment is

28

sufficient to confer standing, courts have examined factors such as: (1) the proximity of the place

of public accommodation to plaintiff's residence; (2) plaintiff's past patronage of defendant's

2

business; (3) the definiteness of plaintiff's plans to return; and (4) plaintiff's frequency of travel

3

near the accommodation in question. See Harris, 472 F. Supp. 2d at 1216 (citation omitted).

4

Notably, a plaintiff's litigation history is a relevant factor to consider and can undercut a professed

5

intent to return to the public accommodation. See id. at 1216-17; see also Molski, 405 F.Supp.2d

6

at 1164-65 ("Courts have found that a serial plaintiff's extensive litigation history can undercut a

7

professed intent to return."); Brother, 331 F.Supp.2d at 1374-75 (holding that "in view of his

8

extensive litigation history, [plaintiff's] professed intent to return to the property is insufficient.").

9

Additionally, "someday intentions" to return to the property are insufficient to establish standing

10

(i.e., a real or immediate threat of future injury). See Ecological Rights Found. v. Pac. Lumber

11

Co., 230 F.3d 1141, 1148 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Access 4 All v. Wintergreen Commercial

12

Partnership, Ltd., No. CIV. A. 3:05-cv-1307-6, 2005 WL 2989307, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 7,

13

2005) ("'someday intentions' – without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even a

14

specification of when the some day will be – do not support a finding of the 'actual or imminent'

15

injury that our cases require.'") (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).

16

Here, none of the Plaintiffs offer any credible allegations demonstrating a definite or

17

concrete plan to return to Wynn Las Vegas sufficient to confer standing on any of the Plaintiffs.

18

Specifically, Plaintiff Spalluto alleges that he travels to Las Vegas "more than once a year" and

19

"desires the ability to access on a non-discriminatory basis the goods and services available to the

20

public at Wynn Las Vegas." (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶ 13) (emphasis in

21

original). However, this is exactly the type of "someday intentions" that courts routinely find

22

insufficient to establish standing to bring a claim for injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA.

23

See, e.g., Access 4 All, 2005 WL 2989307, at *4 (holding that plaintiff's allegations that he "plans

24

to return to the property to avail himself of the goods and services offered to the public at the

25

property" are "someday intentions" and insufficient to obtain standing for injunctive relief under

26

Title III of the ADA). Spalluto's proffered someday intention to access the "goods and services"

27

at Wynn Las Vegas is particularly tenuous given that he is a resident of Florida and has

(See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 3

3

Additionally, Spalluto's someday intention to avail himself of the goods and services

4

offered at Wynn Las Vegas is disingenuous and lacks credibility. Spalluto has made this same

5

allegation in his ADA lawsuits against the Emerald Suits, Travelodge Ambassador Strip Inn, Gold

6

Rush Casino and Hotel, LLC, and Hooters Casino Hotel. (See Exs. "2" at ¶ 6, "3" at ¶ 6, "4" at

7

¶ 6, "5" at ¶6, and "6" at 6). See Harris, 472 F. Supp. 2d at 1217 (stating that a plaintiff's

8

litigation history is relevant when considering the issue of standing). Obviously, it is highly

9

improbable and incredible that Spalluto will avail himself of the goods and services of Wynn

10

Las Vegas when (or if) he travels to Las Vegas if he also intends to avail himself of the goods and

11

services offered at the numerous other facilities he is suing. See id. (recognizing that "the large

12

number of Title III claims brought by Plaintiff raises concerns about credibility.").

13

Given Spalluto's disingenuous and conflicting allegations, it cannot be said with any

14

degree of certainty that Spalluto does, in fact, intend to return to Wynn Las Vegas; that is, there is

15

no likelihood that Spalluto will be subjected to the alleged ADA violations at Wynn Las Vegas.

16

Therefore, because there is no real or immediate threat of future injury, Spalluto lacks standing to

17

maintain this action. See Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2000) (holding that

18

plaintiffs had no standing to assert claim for injunctive relief for alleged structural barriers

19

because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they intended to enter the building in the imminent

20

future).

21

Plaintiff Norkunas also lacks standing to maintain this action. By his own admission,

22

Norkunas is a professional ADA tester. (See Ex. "1" at ¶ 3). In other words, Norkunas was not a

23

bona fide patron of Wynn Las Vegas, but apparently visited Wynn Las Vegas for the sole purpose

24

of bringing this action. As the court in Harris observed:

25
26

Where a plaintiff's sole purpose in visiting a local business is to
litigate, he may visit the establishment before or during the litigation,
but his reason for returning vanishes as soon as litigation is
concluded.

Article III standing to seek injunctive relief.

472 F. Supp. 2d at 1219. On this basis alone, Norkunas lacks Article III standing to maintain this

5

action.

6

Norkunas lacks standing to maintain this action for yet another reason – he fails to offer

7

any credible allegations demonstrating a definite or concrete plan to return to Wynn Las Vegas.

8

Like Spalluto, Norkunas offers only "someday intentions" of "staying at Wynn Las Vegas each

9

time he travels to Las Vegas." (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶ 12). But, Norkunas

10

does not offer any specific or concrete plan to return to Las Vegas, much less stay at Wynn

11

Las Vegas. (See id.). Nokunas' someday intention to return to Wynn Las Vegas is particularly

12

tenuous give that he: (1) is a resident of Florida; (2) has visited Wynn Las Vegas only twice, at

13

most; and (3) has not returned to Wynn Las Vegas in almost a year. (See id. at ¶¶ 9(a) and 12).

14

Put simply, Norkunas lacks standing to maintain this action because there no real and immediate

15

threat that he will be harmed in future at Wynn Las Vegas.

16

DRAC also lacks standing to maintain this action. DRAC's standing to maintain this

17

action depends exclusively on whether Thompson has standing to maintain this action in her own

18

name. See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advertising Comm., 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441

19

(1977) (for representative standing to lie, at least one member must have standing on their own).

20

"Standing is established as of the time of the complaint." See Harris, 472 F. Supp. 2d at 1217

21

(citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Services, (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 191, 120

22

S.Ct. 693, 709 (2000)). As demonstrated below, Thompson lacks standing to maintain this action

23

in her own name and, therefore, DRAC also lacks standing.

24

Here, at the time of the filing of Plaintiffs' Original Complaint (i.e., January 24, 2007),

25

Thompson had never even been to Wynn Las Vegas. (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at

26

¶ 9(c)). In fact, it was not until almost three (3) months after Plaintiffs filed their Original

27

Complaint that Thompson allegedly visited Wynn Las Vegas for the first and only time. (See id.).

Such belated efforts to create standing are irrelevant and are routinely rejected by courts. See,

5

Additionally, like Plaintiffs Spalluto and Norkunas, Thompson fails to offer any credible

6

allegations demonstrating a definite or concrete plan to return to Wynn Las Vegas. That is,

7

Thompson makes no allegation that she intends to return to Wynn Las Vegas, much less offer any

8

definite or concrete plan to do so. (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶ 14). Instead,

9

Thompson alleges only that she desires the ability to access the goods and services available at

10

Wynn Las Vegas. (See id.). However, such vague and amorphous allegations are insufficient to

11

confer standing. See, e.g., Access 4 All, 2005 WL 2989307, at *4 (holding that plaintiff's

12

allegations that he "plans to return to the property to avail himself of the goods and services

13

offered to the public at the property" are "someday intentions" and insufficient to obtain standing

14

for injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA.).

15

But, even if Thompson did offer an allegation that she intended to return to Wynn

16

Las Vegas in the near future, such allegation is not credible given her extensive litigation history.

17

See, e.g., Brother, 331 F.Supp.2d at 1374-75 (holding that "in view of his extensive litigation

18

history, [plaintiff's] professed intent to return to the property is insufficient."). Indeed, Thompson

19

has instituted no less than six (6) lawsuits in this jurisdiction alone wherein she attempted to

20

manufacture standing for DRAC. (See Exs. "8" through "13"). And, in several of those lawsuits,

21

Thompson candidly admitted that she visited the subject properties solely as a "tester." (See

22

Exs. "11" at ¶ 17, "12" at ¶ 16, and "13" at ¶ 16).

23

In sum, Thompson did not have standing when this lawsuit was filed and her belated effort

24

to create standing on behalf of DRAC is too little too late. Because Thompson lacks standing to

25

maintain this action, so does DRAC. Accordingly, all of DRAC's claims should be dismissed.

which give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it

16

Here, Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint only vaguely identifies the general nature of

17

the alleged ADA violations, without any reasonable description of the condition that allegedly

18

violates the ADA. The ambiguity of Plaintiffs' allegations is further compounded by the fact that,

19

with few exceptions, Plaintiffs fail to give any indication of the location of the alleged ADA

20

violations. (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 9(a)(2) through (a)(9), 9(c)(1), and

21

9(c)(2)). Given the detailed requirements of ADAAG and the size of the premises of Wynn

22

Las Vegas (see supra at n. 3), a reasonable description of the condition that allegedly violates the

23

ADA and its location are critical to providing Wynn adequate notice of Plaintiffs' claims so that

24

Wynn can comply with its Rule 11 obligations, investigate the validity (or lack thereof) of

25

Plaintiffs' allegations, and make any remediations that are necessary and/or appropriate. 9

Wynn is only asking Plaintiffs to do what they have done in their previous ADA

11

Additionally, Plaintiffs' legal conclusions that Wynn violated ADAAG 4.1, 4.3, 4.5 and 4.8, each

17

violations. (See id.). The identification of the locations of these alleged ADA violations is

18

important because ADAAG 4.8.5, a subsection of 4.8 that Plaintiffs allege Wynn violated, only

19

requires handrails "[i]f a ramp run has a rise greater than 6 in (150 mm) or a horizontal projection

20

greater than 72 in (1830 mm). . . ." Therefore, without knowing the location of the alleged ADA

21

violation and whether the ramps at issue have a rise greater than 6 inches or a horizontal

22

projection greater than 72 inches, it is entirely possible that there may be ramps at Wynn

23

Las Vegas without handrails which are still fully compliant with the ADA.

Plaintiffs mean by the term "inaccessible elements"; and, Plaintiffs' citation to ADAAG 4.1 and

11

4.22 provides no insight as to the factual basis, if any, of Plaintiffs' claim. ADAAG 4.1 contains

12

over one hundred (100) subparts and technical requirements, and ADAAG 4.22 sets forth

13

numerous requirements for doors, floor space, water closets, urinals, lavatories, mirrors, controls,

14

and dispensers. Accordingly, besides not identifying the location of the subject bathrooms,

15

Plaintiffs fail to identify, even in the most general terms, how these unknown and unidentified

16

bathrooms are not ADA compliant.

17

9.

Plaintiff Norkunas alleges that a "lowered counter (at the Towers registration desk)

18

that was repeatedly rendered inaccessible by placement of ornamental items so that less than

19

36 inches of counter space was available (as required by ADAAG 7.2(2))." (See Plaintiffs' First

20

Amended Complaint at ¶ 9(a)(10)). 14 This allegation misstates the technical requirements of

21

ADAAG 7.2.(2). Specifically, ADAAG 7.2(2) requires only that a registration counter provide "a

22

minimum of 36 in (915 mm) in length. . . ." That is, ADAAG 7.2(2) does not require 36 inches of

23

counter space as Plaintiffs allege.

Thompson makes a similar allegation. Specifically, Thompson alleges as follows:
"Placement of objects so as to render inaccessible a lowered counter and a bathroom mirror (thus
making those elements of Wynn Las Vegas noncompliant with ADAAG 4.22 and 7.22)." (See
Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶ 9(c)(2)). However, Thompson fails to identify: (1) the
objects that were placed that allegedly rendered the counter and bathroom mirror inaccessible; (2)
how the placement of the objects allegedly rendered the counter and bathroom mirror
inaccessible; and (3) the location of the subject bathroom. (See id.).

1

It is readily apparent that Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint fails to afford Wynn fair

2

and adequate notice of the alleged ADA violations. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint is so

3

vague and ambiguous that Wynn cannot investigate the validity of Plaintiffs' allegations or frame

4

a responsive pleading. Under these circumstances, a "judge may in his discretion, in response to a

5

motion for more definite statement under Federal rule of Civil Procedure 12(e), require such

6

detail as may be appropriate in the particular case. . . ." McHenry v. Renne, 84 F.3d 1172, 1179

7

(9th Cir. 1996). In this particular case, Plaintiffs should be required to provide more detail and,

8

specifically, provide a reasonable description of each and every ADA violation allegedly

9

encountered by Plaintiffs, including the locations of the alleged ADA violations.

11

A More Definite Statement Is Necessary To Determine Whether Plaintiffs
Have Standing To Raise Certain Alleged ADA Violations And To Prevent
Plaintiffs From Going On A Fishing Expedition.

12

Requiring Plaintiffs to identify each and every alleged ADA violation (i.e., provide a

13

reasonable description of all alleged ADA violation and their location) is not only necessary to

14

give Wynn fair notice of Plaintiffs' claims, but it is critical in determining whether Plaintiffs' even

15

have standing to sue for a particular ADA violation. The law is clear that a plaintiff may only

16

seek redress for ADA violations which he personally encountered or which he knew of at the time

17

the complaint was filed. See Jones v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., No. 204 CV 2002 MCEXJM, 2006

18

WL 1408667, at * 4 (E.D. Cal. May 19, 2006) (citing Pickern, 293 F.3d at 1136-38). In other

19

words, Plaintiffs cannot generally allege, as they do, that an ADA violation exists and then seek to

20

conduct an audit of the entire premises of Wynn Las Vegas to discover the location of all ADA

21

violations, if any. See Martinez 2005 WL 2072013, at *4 ("[A] plaintiff in an ADA action does

22

not, by the mere filing of a lawsuit alleging one violation, obtain the right to perform a wholesale

23

audit of defendant's premises."); see also DeShazier, 2006 WL 2522397, at *6 ("Conclusory

24

allegations in a complaint, if they stand alone, are a danger sign that the plaintiff is engaged in a

25

fishing expedition.").

10

B.

26

Similarly, courts have repeatedly held that an ADA plaintiff has standing to sue for only

27

those ADA violations specifically alleged in his complaint because it is only those barriers which

he actually encountered or had knowledge of at the time of the filing of the complaint. See White

2

v. Divine Investments, Inc., No. CIV. S-04-0206, 2005 WL 2491543, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 7,

3

2005); see also Hubbard, 433 F.Supp. 2d at 1142-43 (holding that an ADA plaintiff has standing

4

to sue for only those barriers she actually encountered and/or had knowledgeable at the time of

5

the filing of the complaint); El Torito Restaurants, Inc., 1997 WL 714866, at * 1 (limiting

6

plaintiff to ADA violations identified in her complaint).

7

In Pickern v. Pier 1 Imports, 339 F. Supp. 2d at 1087-88, the plaintiff offered only general

8

allegations of ADA violations. When the defendant sought to have these claims dismissed, the

9

plaintiff offered "a host of new violations allegedly . . . uncovered by the plaintiff's expert"

10

subsequent to the time of the filing of the original complaint. See id. The court in Pickern

11

refused to "construe [plaintiff's] complaint as entirely generic and, throughout the litigation,

12

incorporate any new factual allegations" because such practice "would read the 'fair notice'

13

requirement out of Rule 8(a) and would seriously undermine the rule's goal of encouraging

14

expeditious resolution of disputes." Id. at 1088.

15

Here, it appears that Plaintiffs are not only seeking redress for the alleged ADA violations

16

generally identified in their First Amended Complaint, but for other unknown and unspecified

17

alleged ADA violations. Indeed, Plaintiffs make clear that the ADA violations vaguely identified

18

in their First Amended Complaint are only illustrative examples of the ADA violations that they

19

allegedly encountered. (See Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 9(a), 9(b) and 9(c) (stating

20

that the discriminatory conditions encountered by Plaintiffs "include, but are not limited to. . . . .")

21

(emphasis in original)). Accordingly, requiring Plaintiffs to identify all ADA violations that they

22

allegedly encountered at Wynn Las Vegas, in including their location, is necessary to prevent

23

Plaintiffs from going on a fishing expedition or conducting an ADA audit, neither of which they

24

have a right to do.

25

V.

CONCLUSION

26

Based on the foregoing, Wynn respectfully requests that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs' First

27

Amended Complaint in its entirety. Alternatively, Wynn requests that the Court require Plaintiffs
