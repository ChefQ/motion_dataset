IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH -- CENTRAL DIVISION

GOENGINEER, INC.
Plaintiff
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY AND
FOR EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION

v.
PROGRESSION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,
JOHN FORBES, AND JOHN DOES 1-50
Defendants

NO. 2: 12-CV-000930-TS
Judge Ted Stewart

Plaintiff GoEngineer, Inc. (“GEI”) sued Defendants Progression Technologies, Inc.
(“Progression”) and John Forbes (“Forbes”), based on the alleged theft of a customer list.
[Docket No. 1, Ex. A.] GEI moved for a preliminary injunction (the “Injunction Motion”),
[Docket No. 5], and the Defendants moved to dismiss for, among other things, lack of personal

Case 2:12-cv-00930-TS Document 16 Filed 10/15/12 Page 2 of 5

jurisdiction (the “Jurisdiction Motion”). [Docket No. 14.] The Defendants now request: (1) that
the Court issue an order staying the disposition of the Injunction Motion (including Defendants’
requirement to respond to the Injunction Motion) until after the Court has disposed of the
Jurisdiction Motion; and (2) in light of Defendants’ pending deadline to respond to the Injunction
Motion, that consideration of the motion to stay be expedited or, in the alternative, that
Defendants’ time to respond to the Injunction Motion be extended until after the Court has had
an opportunity to consider this motion to stay.
I.

MOTION TO STAY

The Court should stay proceeding on the Injunction Motion pending the resolution of the
Jurisdiction Motion for any or all of the following four reasons:
•

First, this is a Court of limited jurisdiction, so this Court cannot consider the
Injunction Motion until it first determines whether it has personal jurisdiction
over the parties that would be subject to the injunction (i.e., the Defendants).

•

Second, the Court will likely grant the Jurisdiction Motion, which will
automatically moot the Injunction Motion; thus, staying the Injunction Motion
pending the disposition of the Jurisdiction Motion would conserve judicial and
party resources.

•

Third, if the Court does not stay the Injunction Motion pending the disposition of
the Jurisdiction Motion, the Defendants will suffer prejudice and undue
hardship—i.e., the Defendants will unfairly be forced to choose between: (i)
responding to the Injunction Motion but, in doing so, risk waiving their objections
to personal jurisdiction; and (ii) not responding to the Injunction Motion, but, in
doing so, risk the Court granting the injunction without further notice; the only

2

way to avoid subjecting the Defendants to these risks is to order that the
Defendants need not respond to the Injunction Motion until after the Court first
determines whether it has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants.
•

Fourth, if the Court stays the Injunction Motion pending the disposition of the
Jurisdiction Motion, the Plaintiff will not suffer prejudice or undue hardship—i.e.,
if the Plaintiff truly needed a court to consider the case on the merits in an
expedited fashion, the Plaintiff would have filed in a district where there are no
potential objections to jurisdiction (like in Texas, where the complaint alleges that
the Defendants reside and do business); furthermore, the Court can always protect
the Plaintiff’s interest in expedited consideration of the merits by expediting the
briefing on the Jurisdiction Motion and resolving the jurisdictional issues quickly.

II.
MOTION TO EXPEDITE CONSIDERATION OF MOTION TO STAY OR, IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, TO EXTEND DEFENDANTS’ DEADLINE TO RESPOND TO INJUNCTION
MOTION
The motion to expedite should be granted because there is good cause to grant the motion
to stay, Defendants have significant legal interests that will be adversely affected if consideration
is not expedited, and Defendants will suffer actual harm and prejudice if consideration is not
expedited. The Plaintiff filed the Injunction Motion on October 5, 2012. The Defendants’
deadline to respond to the Injunction Motion—which the Defendants seek to stay by this
motion—is arguably October 19, 2012. That is four days from now. This deadline and the risks
accompanying it (outlined in the third bullet above), loom large; accordingly, out of a desire to
preserve their right to respond to the Injunction Motion, the Defendants respectfully request
expedited consideration of the motion to stay. Alternatively, the Defendants respectfully request

Case 2:12-cv-00930-TS Document 16 Filed 10/15/12 Page 4 of 5

that the Court extend this deadline for the Defendants to respond to the Injunction Motion until
after the Court has had an opportunity to consider this motion to stay.
This motion is based on the pleadings and papers on file in this case and the concurrently
filed memorandum of points and authorities.
DATED this 15th day of October, 2012.
