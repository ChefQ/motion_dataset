MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

16

A.

17

AB has made, used, sold, and/or offered for sale various oligonucleotide probes that sat-

Introduction

18

isfy all properly construed limitations of claim 1 of the ‘119 patent, either literally or under the

19

doctrine of equivalents. Specifically, the so-called “one-base encoding” and “two-base encoding”

20

oligonucleotide probes that AB and/or its predecessor, Agencourt Personal Genomics, has used,

21

sold, and/or offered for sale literally satisfy all but one of the structural limitations recited in

22

claim 1 of the ‘119 patent. The remaining structural limitation, which concerns the chemical

23

group that links the set of j nucleotides or analogs at the 3′ end of the probe with the set of k nu-

24

cleotides or analogs at the 5′ end of the probe, is satisfied under the doctrine of equivalents. Spe-

25

cifically, because AB’s one-base and two-base encoding probes contain a phosphorothiolate1

26

linkage group that performs the same function in same way to achieve the same result as the

27
28

See Figure 3 – Phosphorothiolate Structure, below.

phosphoramidate2 linkage recited in claim 1 of the ‘119 patent, the AB probes satisfy this limita-

2

tion under the doctrine of equivalents.

3

AB has made and used a “one-base encoding” version of its SOLiD System that satisfies

4

all properly construed limitations of claim 1 of both the ‘341 and ‘597 patents, either literally or

5

under the doctrine of equivalents.

6

B.

7

As with any civil action, summary judgment is appropriate in a patent infringement case.3

8

Summary judgment is appropriate where, as here, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact

9

and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.4

10

Legal Standards

To prevail on this motion, Solexa need only establish infringement by a preponderance of

11

the evidence.5 Patent infringement occurs under one of two legal theories: (1) literal infringe-

12

ment6 or (2) infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.7 Although the Court must view the

13

evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw reasonable inferences in that

14

party’s favor, the nonmoving party must do more than simply present some evidence as to an is-

15

sue it asserts is in dispute.8 Instead, the nonmoving party must come forward with evidence which

16

would be sufficient to require submission of the disputed material fact to the jury. Id.

17

It is well established that in a motion for summary judgment of patent infringement, ex-

18

pert testimony may be used to resolve the question of infringement.9 As is clear from the undis-

C.

5

Solexa is entitled to summary judgment that AB’s one-base and two-base encoding probes infringe claim 1 of the ‘119 patent
1.

6

Claim construction

Claim 1 of the ‘119 patent recites:

7

An oligonucleotide probe of the formula:

8

HO–(3') (B)j (5')–OP (=O) (O–) NH–(B)k-Bt*

9

13

wherein:
B is a nucleotide or an analog thereof,
j is in the range of from 1 to 12;
k is in the range of from 1 to 12, such that the sum of j
and k is less than or equal to 12;
Bt* is a labeled, non-extendable chain-terminating moiety.

14

Although the Court has not construed any terms of claim 1 of the ‘119 patent, there can be

15

little genuine dispute as to their meaning. Most of the claim terms are expressly defined either by

16

the claim itself or by the claim language in combination with the specification. For example, the

17

letters j and k stand for the number of nucleotides or analogs thereof in each of two sets, Bj and

18

Bk, respectively, with the sum of j and k totaling between 2 and 12.

10
11
12

19

The remaining terms are defined by the specification or explained in the prosecution his-

20

tory. For example, the term “oligonucleotide” is expressly defined in the patent specification to

21

include “linear oligomers of nucleosides or analogs thereof, including deoxyribonucleosides, ri-

22

bonucleosides, and the like. Usually oligonucleotides range in size from a few monomeric units,

23

e.g., 3-4, to several hundreds of monomeric units.”10 The term “nucleoside” is defined to include

24
25
26
27
28

results offered through an expert affidavit).

Solexa’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of Infringement (hereinafter “Pendleton Decl.”)

1

“the natural nucleosides, including 2′-deoxy and 2′-hydroxyl forms . . . .”11 The specification also

2

states that “‘[a]nalogs’ in reference to nucleosides includes synthetic nucleosides having modified

3

base moieties and/or modified sugar moieties . . . . Such analogs include synthetic nucleosides

4

designed to enhance binding properties, reduce degeneracy, increase specificity, and the like.”12

5

The meaning of the term “labeled, non-extendable chain-terminating moiety,” indicated

6

by the notation Bt* in claim 1, would likewise have been readily apparent to one having ordinary

7

skill in the art at the time of the original application was filed. The term “labeled” would have

8

been understood to mean “associated with a moiety capable of generating a detectable signal,”13

9

in accordance with customary usage and the statements in the specification teaching that, for ex-

10

ample, “[t]he probes of the invention can be labeled in a variety of ways, including the direct or

11

indirect attachment of fluorescent moieties, colorimetric moieties, and the like” and “[p]referably,

12

the probes are labeled with one or more fluorescent dyes . . . .”14 A “non-extendable chain-

13

terminating moiety” would have been understood to mean “a moiety that cannot be extended by

14

ligation or polymerization.”15

15

The term “–OP (=O) (O–) NH–” likewise requires no special construction. This term is

16

standard notation for the chemical structure of a phosphoramidate, which can also be drawn as

17

shown in Figure 1.

“one-base encoding” probes that were made and used by Agencourt Personal Genomics
(“APG”),17 the company that originally developed the SOLiD System and was acquired by AB in
2006. In Figure 2, “N” stands for a nucleotide position that is degenerate, meaning that it can be

position, and an otherwise identical structure. Id. at 144:7-145:20.

deoxyadenosine (“A”), deoxycytidine (“C”), deoxythymidine (“T), or deoxyguanosine (“G”).18

2

The 3′ terminal N has an OH group, although it is not expressly shown.19 The “Y” at the fifth po-

3

sition from the 3′ end is an “interrogation” nucleotide, meaning that this position that is fixed in

4

each of the four sets of probes: one set will have an A at the fifth position, while the others will

5

have G, C, and T, respectively.20 Each “Z” stands for a “universal base,”21 specifically the nucleo-

6

tide analog inosine.22 The inosine at the 5′ terminal of the probe is attached to a fluorescent label,

7

and has an OH group.23 The five nucleotides labeled NNNNY at the 3′ end of the probes are

8

linked to the three nucleotide analogs ZZZ-label at the 5′ end through a phosphorothiolate bond,

9

indicated by the letter s. As shown in Figure 3, a phosphorothiolate bond is identical in structure

10

to a phosphoramidate bond apart from the substitution of a sulfur atom for the nitrogen and hy-

11

drogen atoms.

8

The structures in Figure 4 represent the two types of two-base encoding probes made, used, sold,

9

and offered for sale by AB: 1,2-encoded and 4,5-encoded probes. Just as for the one-base encod-

10

ing probes, there is no factual dispute as to the chemical structure of AB’s two-base encoding

11

probes. Two-base encoding probes are identical in all respects to the one-base encoding probes,25

12

except that they are divided into different groups for labeling: they are the same length, have the

13

same number and identity of nucleotides or analogs in the 3′ and 5′ end of the probes, are linked

14

by the same phosphorothiolate linkage, have the same OH groups at both the 3′ and 5′ ends, and

15

are labeled at the 5′ end with a fluorescent dye.26 As above, N stands for a degenerate nucleotide

16

position in a set of probes. X and Y stand for the fixed interrogation positions. The letter s is the

17

phosphorothiolate linkage between the 3′ and 5′ end of the probes. The letter I stands for the uni-

18

versal base analog, inosine, and “Dye” stands for the fluorescent dye at the 5′ end of the probes.

19

A 1,2-encoded probe has its interrogation positions at the first and second positions from the 3′

20

end of the probe (left side), while a 4,5-encoded probe has its interrogation positions at the fourth

21

and fifth positions from the 3′ end.

at the 3′ end, whether NNNNY or NNNXY or XYNNN, satisfy the Bj limitation recited in the

9

claim because N, X, and Y are “nucleotides” and j = 5. The sixth and seventh positions from the

10

3′ end, inosines in both types of probes, satisfy the Bk limitation recited in the claim because

11

inosine is a “nucleotide analog,” k=2, and the sum of j + k is less than 12. Finally, the Bt* limita-

12

tion of a “labeled, non-extendable chain-terminating moiety” recited in the claim is satisfied by

13

the 5′ terminal inosine in both types of AB probes because it is a fluorescently labeled nucleotide

14

analog with an OH group, and is thus cannot be extended by ligation or polymerization.

15

The AB probes differ from the structure recited in claim 1 of the ‘119 patent only in that

16

the 3′ and 5′ portions of the probe are linked by a phosphorothiolate linkage in the AB probes,

17

while the claim recites a phosphoramidate linkage. There is no genuine issue of material fact that

18

substitution of a phosphorothiolate linkage for the claimed phosphoramidate linkage is an insub-

19

stantial difference, and thus infringing under the doctrine of equivalents.

Although AB offers arguments concerning the chemical reactivities and properties of sul-

2

fur and nitrogen, and the linkage groups containing them, none of AB’s arguments raise any

3

genuine issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment in favor of Solexa. With

4

regard to the properties of nitrogen and sulfur, AB argues that they have different properties when

5

in elemental form under standard state conditions, have unique positions on the periodic table of

6

the elements, and form different numbers of bonds with hydrogen. With regard to the claimed and

7

substituted linkages containing nitrogen and sulfur, AB argues that the phosphorothiolate and

8

phosphoramidate linkages are substantially different because of alleged differences in the chemi-

9

cal conditions used to cleave them when incorporated into DNA as part of a method of sequenc-

10

ing.29 As explained below, none of AB’s arguments establish a genuine issue of material fact pre-

11

cluding summary judgment of infringement.

12

None of the alleged differences between nitrogen and sulfur are material to whether the

13

AB probes infringe claim 1 of the ‘119 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. First, whether or

14

not nitrogen and sulfur have different elemental forms under standard state conditions is irrele-

15

vant because neither element is present in elemental form when incorporated into the claimed or

16

accused probes, as Dr. Metzker admitted at his deposition.30 To the contrary, both sulfur and ni-

17

trogen exist in the same form when incorporated into cleavable linkages in oligonucleotide

18

probes: either a solid (if the probes are dried) or a solution (if the probes are dissolved).31

19

Second, AB’s argument that nitrogen and sulfur occupy different positions on the periodic

20

table merely restates that they are different elements,32 but does not establish that the differences

21

between them are material in the context of the claimed inventions.

22
23

Finally, the difference between the number of hydrogen atoms bound to sulfur and nitrogen when incorporated into the linkage groups is immaterial because a hydrogen atom does not

participate in the linkage, as is apparent from the structures shown in Figures 2 and 3, supra. To

2

the contrary, in the context of the function of the linkage group recited in claim 1, nitrogen and

3

sulfur perform identical functions: each holds the two parts of the probe together by forming a

4

covalent bond between the sugar moieties of adjacent nucleotides, specifically with the 3′ carbon

5

atom on one sugar and a phosphorus atom attached to an adjacent sugar, as Dr. Metzker admitted

6

during his deposition.33

7

AB’s argument regarding alleged differences between the cleavage conditions for the

8

claimed and substituted linkage groups likewise fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact pre-

9

cluding summary judgment of infringement. Even granting, arguendo, that the substituted linkage

10

is cleaved differently than the claimed linkage, that fact is not material to the Court’s inquiry on

11

summary judgment because claim 1 of the ‘119 patent is directed to a composition of matter, not

12

a method or process claim. Simply put, claim 1 is infringed when an oligonucleotide with the

13

claimed structure is made, sold, or offered for sale, even if it is never used in a sequencing reac-

14

tion or in any other way. More specifically, because claim 1 does not recite any limitations re-

15

quiring that the claimed probes be incorporated into DNA, used in a method of sequencing,

16

cleaved, or cleaved in any particular way,34 these issues are irrelevant to infringement. AB cannot

17

create a genuine issue of material fact by pointing to facts that are, based on the claim language,

18

immaterial.

19

Moreover, the patent specification teaches that differences in the methods of cleavage of

20

chemically scissile groups, such as phosphoramidate and phosphorothiolate, are irrelevant to their

21

function in the claimed inventions. The specification teaches that the phosphoramidate linkage is

22

“an example of a general class of internucleosidic linkages referred to herein as ‘chemically scis-

23

sile internucleosidic linkages.’”35 In light of the specification’s further teaching that “internucleo-

tions, such as an oxidizing environment, a reducing environment, light of a characteristic wave-

2

length (for photolabile linkages), or the like,”36 one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate

3

that the various chemically scissile bonds were useful in the invention simply because they are

4

cleavable, not because they were cleavable in a specific way. Tellingly, AB does not dispute that

5

both the phosphoramidate and the phosphorothiolate linkages were known to be chemically scis-

6

sile internucleosidic linkages by those of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the patent applica-

7

tion.37 One of ordinary skill would understand from the specification that substitution of one

8

known type of chemically scissile bond for another is an insubstantial difference in the context of

9

the composition recited in claim 1 of the ‘119 patent. It is immaterial whether such substitution

10

would result in differences in the DNA molecules into which the probes are incorporated or dif-

11

ferences in the cleavage conditions used in a method of DNA sequencing, because claim 1 of the

12

‘119 patent makes no mention of such use.

13

Alternatively, because the linkage used in the AB probes satisfies the recited limitation

14

because it performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve sub-

15

stantially the same result, AB’s probes infringe claim 1 of the ‘119 patent under the doctrine of

16

equivalents.

17

These facts are analogous to the Supreme Court’s analysis in Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.

18

Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605 (1950). In Graver Tank, the Court considered the applica-

19

tion of the doctrine of equivalents to an accused chemical composition for use in welding that dif-

20

fered from the patented welding material by the substitution of one chemical element.38 The Court

21

noted that the question before the Court was whether substitution of one element (magnesium) for

22

another (calcium) “is a change of such substance as to make the doctrine of equivalents inappli-

trial court's invocation of the doctrine of equivalents was justified.”39 The Court also described

2

some of the considerations that go into applying the doctrine of equivalents:

3

9

What constitutes equivalency must be determined against the context of the patent,
the prior art, and the particular circumstances of the case. Equivalence, in the patent law, is not the prisoner of a formula and is not an absolute to be considered in a
vacuum. It does not require complete identity for every purpose and in every respect. In determining equivalents, things equal to the same thing may not be equal
to each other and, by the same token, things for most purposes different may
sometimes be equivalents. Consideration must be given to the purpose for which
an ingredient is used in a patent, the qualities it has when combined with the other
ingredients, and the function which it is intended to perform. An important factor
is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was.40

10

Considering those factors, the Court viewed the difference between the chemical element claimed

11

in the patent and the substitute element to be “colorable only,” and concluded that the trial court's

12

judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was proper.41

The parties agree42 that the function or purpose of both the phosphoramidate and phos-

13
14

phorothiolate linkages is to join two segments of nucleotides with a chemically scissile bond, just

15

as described in the patent.43 Furthermore, as discussed above, there is also no factual dispute that

16

both linkages perform this function in substantially the same way: namely, by substituting a dif-

17

ferent chemically reactive atom or moiety in place of the normal oxygen atom in the phosphodi-

18

ester backbone of the probe.44 Finally, there is no factual dispute that the both linkages achieve

Claim 1 of the ‘341 patent recites:

11

A method for determining a sequence of nucleotides in a target polynucleotide,
the method comprising the steps of:

12
13

(a) providing a probe-target duplex comprising an initializing oligonucleotide
probe hybridized to a target polynucleotide, said probe having an extendable
probe terminus;

14
15

(b) ligating an extension oligonucleotide probe to said extendable probe terminus,
to form an extended duplex containing an extended oligonucleotide probe;

16
17

(c) identifying, in the extended duplex, at least one nucleotide in the target
polynucleotide that is either (1) complementary to the just-ligated extension probe
or (2) the nucleotide residue in the target polynucleotide which is immediately
downstream of the extended oligonucleotide probe;

18
19
20

(d) generating an extendable probe terminus on the extended probe, if an extendable probe terminus is not already present, such that the terminus generated is different from the terminus to which the last extension probe was ligated; and

21
22

(e) repeating steps (b), (c) and (d) until a sequence of nucleotides in the target
polynucleotide is determined.

The parties met and conferred and presented six claim terms from the ‘341 patent46 to the Court

for construction. The Court issued its claim construction order on February 21, 2008.47 The six

terms were construed as follows:

The Court’s Construction

“initializing oligonucleotide probe”

“the oligonucleotide to which the first extension oligonucleotide probe is first ligated”

“ligating an extension oligonucleotide
probe to said extendable probe terminus”

“forming a covalent bond between an extension oligonucleotide probe and the extendable probe terminus of either an initializing oligonucleotide or an
extended oligonucleotide probe while hybridized to
a target polynucleotide.”

“extended oligonucleotide probe”

“an initializing oligonucleotide probe effectively
extended by one or more nucleotides”

“identifying”

“within each cycle determining the identity of a base
in the target polynucleotide.”

“just-ligated extension probe”

“the extension oligonucleotide probe ligated to either the initializing oligonucleotide probe or an extended oligonucleotide probe in the present cycle of
the method.”

“repeating steps (b), (c), and (d) until a
sequence of nucleotides in the target
polynucleotide is determined.”

Not construed; takes its plain and ordinary meaning.

The only remaining term that requires construction is the term “target polynucleotide.” The
Court’s comments regarding a “drafting error” in claim 1 of the ‘341 patent indicates formal construction is necessary. Solexa proposes that “target polynucleotide” be construed to mean “a
polynucleotide that contains the nucleotide sequence information to be obtained.”48 Under
Solexa’s proposed construction, the “target polynucleotide” need only contain the nucleotide sequence information to be obtained, but may also contain other sequences, including regions of

The term “identifying” also appears in claim 1 of the ‘597 patent.

known sequence to which initializing oligonucleotides may be hybridized and sequences from

2

which no sequence information will be obtained. The “target polynucleotide” may also be of en-

3

tirely known, entirely unknown, or a mixture of known and unknown sequences. Only this con-

4

struction is consistent with the teaching of the specification and the plain and ordinary meaning of

5

this term to those of ordinary skill in the art when the patent was filed.

6

Importantly, when construing “target polynucleotide,” the specification’s description of a

7

preferred embodiment in which “a target polynucleotide is conjugated to a binding region to form

8

a template”49 should not be treated as limiting the scope of the term “target polynucleotide,” be-

9

cause doing so would improperly import limitations from the specification into the claims, ignore

10

other teachings of the specification, and contradict other statements in the Court’s claim construc-

11

tion order.

12

First, descriptions of preferred embodiments should not normally be used to limit the

13

scope of claim terms.50 This principle is hornbook law. The passage from the specification dis-

14

cussed above expressly describes a preferred embodiment. The passage does not provide an ex-

15

press or implied definition that requires the target polynucleotide to be distinct from the template

16

or binding region. Nor is there any definition requiring that the target polynucleotide not include

17

any known sequences. Indeed, as discussed in Solexa’s Reply Brief on Claim Construction,51 the

18

text following the quoted passage expressly disclaims limiting the invention to the particular fea-

19

tures of the embodiment (such as a template formed from a separate target polynucleotide and

binding region).52 “Target polynucleotide” should be construed as proposed by Solexa, rather

2

than in the limited sense suggested by the description of the preferred embodiment.

3

Second, construing “target polynucleotide” to exclude the presence of other DNA se-

4

quences, such as known regions of DNA usable as binding regions or DNA sequences from

5

which no sequence information will be obtained, would ignore other teachings in the specifica-

6

tion. The specification expressly teaches that target polynucleotides can be generated by tech-

7

niques such as PCR and standard cloning techniques. These methods would be understood by one

8

of ordinary skill in the art to require the use of DNA sequences other than the DNA to be se-

9

quenced, including cloning vectors, PCR primers, and other sequences, and to leave those DNA

10

sequences attached to the DNA to be sequenced. For example, PCR primers used to amplify tar-

11

get DNA are necessarily incorporated into the amplified DNA, and portions of cloning vectors

12

may commonly remain associated with amplified DNA following cloning. Use of these tech-

13

niques and descriptions of the sequences thereby incorporated into the target polynucleotides are

14

extensively described in the specification.53

15

Finally, construing “target polynucleotide” to exclude known regions of DNA would con-

16

tradict other statements in the Claim construction order. As the Court recognized, a target polynu-

17

cleotide is “clearly not always a fully-known sequence.”54 The Court also rejected AB’s attempt

18

to limit “‘target polynucleotide’ as necessarily containing a fully-unknown sequence,” noting that,

19

based on the teaching of the specification, “[a]t times, the sequence may very well be a partially-

20

known sequence that the user desires to be further sequenced.”55 Besides being fully unknown, or

21

partially known, a sequence may also be fully known, as in both of the Examples given in the

The one-base encoding format of the SOLiD System satisfies all limitations of claim 1 of the ‘341 patent

claim 1 either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. Step (a) recites “providing a probetarget duplex comprising an initializing oligonucleotide probe hybridized to a target polynucleotide, said probe having an extendable probe terminus.” The AB method obtains sequence information from a piece of DNA attached to a microscopic bead.57 The DNA attached to the bead is a
“target polynucleotide” because it is “a polynucleotide that contains the nucleotide sequence information to be obtained,” along with other sequences, including a known “adapter sequence,”
which is used in PCR amplification of the target DNA and is immediately adjacent to the DNA to
be sequenced. The universal sequencing primer is an “initializing oligonucleotide probe” because
it is the “the oligonucleotide to which the first extension oligonucleotide probe is first ligated,” as

between a universal sequencing primer and the adapter sequence portion of the target polynucleo56

terminus” because the universal sequencing primer has a 5′ phosphate group,59 which is extend-

able by ligation.60 Alternatively, if the Court construes the term “target polynucleotide” to ex-

4

clude the adapter sequence, then the limitation is satisfied under the doctrine of equivalents, be-

5

cause one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that hybridizing the initializing oligonu-

cleotide to known DNA sequences attached immediately adjacent to the DNA to be sequenced is

7

an insubstantial difference because the initializing oligonucleotide could still be extended by liga-

AB’s method literally satisfies all limitations of step (b) of claim 1. Following formation

10

of the probe-target duplex, a pool of one-base encoding oligonucleotide probes with the structure

11

described above is added. These one-base encoding probes satisfy the “extension oligonucleotide

probes” limitation recited in step (b). In the first ligation round, one of these probes is ligated to

13

the extendable end of the universal sequencing primer by DNA ligase.62 In subsequent rounds of

the method, the labeled ligation probes hybridize adjacent to extended oligonucleotide probe

61

Under the function/way/result test, the outcome is the same. The adapter sequence performs
the same function (providing a place for an initializing oligonucleotide to hybridize) in the same
way (by having sequences complementary to the initializing oligonucleotide) to achieve the same
result (providing an initial registration point for subsequent extension of the initializing oligonucleotide).
62

Exhibit 4 at 89:13-22 and 90:8-20 (discussing Exhibit 3 at AB00137636-637). Because the
probes are degenerate at their 3′ ends, the pool encompasses all 45 = 1,024 possible five base sequences of the four nucleotides A, T, C, and G (i.e., AAAAA, AAAAT . . . GGGGC, GGGGG).
This means that one of the probes will be complementary to the five bases in the target DNA immediately adjacent to the hybridized universal sequencing primer. The complementary probe hybridizes and is ligated to the end of the universal sequencing primer.

initializing oligonucleotide probe or an extended oligonucleotide probe in the present cycle of the

method.” The ligation step extends the universal sequencing primer (or a previously extended

primer), thus forming an “extended oligonucleotide probe,” which was construed by the Court to

11

mean “initializing oligonucleotide probe effectively extended by one or more nucleotides,” and

also forms an extended duplex region along the target polynucleotide.65

AB’s method satisfies all limitations of step (c) of claim 1 either literally or under the doc-

base encoding SOLiD System method.73
If the Court concludes that obtaining and recording the color image does not literally satisfy the “identifying” limitation in step (c), the AB method should be found to satisfy the claim
limitation under the doctrine of equivalents. The color images obtained and recorded during the
one-base encoding AB method contain all the information necessary and sufficient to determine
the identity of a base in the target polynucleotide. The function of the color image recorded by the
SOLiD System is to identify a base in the target polynucleotide that is complementary to the justligated extension probe. The way in which this is done is by analyzing the color images obtained
in light of known parameters, like the color encoding scheme used. For example, if A is encoded
with a blue dye, the AB method determines that a blue signal represents an A in the target sequence. The result of this analysis is the determination of the identity of a base without any data
generated outside to the cycle: indeed, the AB system gathers no information other than the color
images from which it determines nucleotide sequences in the one-base encoding format. The timing of when the identity of a nucleotide is recorded as a letter rather than a color does not change
the function, way, or result: because the one-base encoding system has a one-to-one correspondence between color and nucleotide identity, recording the identity of a base as “blue” or “A” is
simply a matter of nomenclature, not a substantial difference precluding summary judgment of
infringement.
AB’s method literally satisfies all limitations of step (d) of claim 1. After the imaging

Solexa is entitled to summary judgment that the one-base encoding SOLiD
System infringes claim 1 of the ‘597 patent
1.

Claim construction

Claim 1 of the ‘597 patent recites:
A method for identifying a sequence of nucleotides in a polynucleotide, the
method comprising the steps of:

8
9
10

(a) extending an initializing oligonucleotide along the polynucleotide by ligating
an oligonucleotide probe thereto to form an extended duplex;
(b) identifying one or more nucleotides of the polynucleotide; and

11
(c) repeating steps (a) and (b) until the sequence of nucleotides is determined.
12
13
14
15

The Court’s construction of “initializing oligonucleotide probe” in claim 1 of the ‘341 patent has
been applied to the term “initializing oligonucleotide” in step (a) of claim 1 of the ‘597 patent.
The Court’s construction of “identifying” has also been applied. All other terms either require no
specific construction or have been previously construed above.

The one-base encoding format of the SOLiD System satisfies all limitations of claim 1 of the ‘597 patent

The detailed description of the steps of the one-base encoding format SOLiD System

19

method given above, and the documents, testimony, and other evidence supporting it are incorpo-

20

rated herein in their entirety.

21

AB’s method literally satisfies all limitations of step (a) of the ‘597 patent. As discussed

22

above, the AB method satisfies this limitation because a universal sequencing primer is extended

23

along the target polynucleotide by ligation of a one-base encoding oligonucleotide probe.

24

AB’s method satisfies all limitations of step (b) of the ‘597 patent, either literally or under

25

the doctrine of equivalents, as described in detail above concerning step (c) of claim 1 of the ‘341

26

patent. Briefly, the “identifying” limitation is literally satisfied by the one-base encoding format

27

AB method because the color image determines the identity of a base in the polynucleotide. Al-

ternatively, the color image satisfies this limitation under the doctrine of equivalents for the rea-

2

sons discussed above.

3

AB’s method satisfies all limitations of step (c) of the ‘597 patent, either literally or under

4

the doctrine of equivalents. As discussed above, the AB method involves repeated cycles of ex-

5

tension of initializing oligonucleotides by ligation of labeled oligonucleotide probes and identifi-

6

cation of nucleotides in the target polynucleotide within each round. The limitations of step (c)

7

are satisfied because multiple universal sequencing primers are initially extended along the target

8

polynucleotide by ligation of a labeled one-base encoding probe, followed by identification of a

9

nucleotide in the target polynucleotide, as discussed above.

F.

11

For all the reasons given above, Solexa respectfully moves the Court to grant summary

12

judgment of infringement of claim 1 of the ‘119 patent against AB with regard to the one-base

13

and two-base encoding labeled ligation probes identified above. Solexa also respectfully moves

14

the Court to grant summary judgment of infringement of claim 1 of both the ‘341 and ‘597 pat-

15

ents against AB with regard to the one-base encoding format of the SOLiD System.
