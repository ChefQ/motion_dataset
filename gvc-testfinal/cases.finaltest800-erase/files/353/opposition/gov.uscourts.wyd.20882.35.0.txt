DEFENDANT, DIVERSIFIED TRANSFER AND STORAGE, INC'S RESPONSE
TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Comes now Defendant, Diversified Transfer and Storage, Inc. ("DTS") in Response to
Plaintiff, Georgia-Pacific's (G-P) Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and states:

I. The Court Should Strike Those Portions of Plaintiff's Motion, Memorandum
and Exhibits Which Seek Judgment as a Matter of Law on Issues, Claims
and Defenses Outside the Scope of this Case.

As a preliminary matter, DTS respectfully moves the Court to Strike those portions of
Plaintiffs Motion, Memorandum and Exhibits which ask the Court to adjudicate the issue of G-
P's negligence in the underlying case, Richard Waltman v. Georgia-Pacific, et al., (Civil No. 09-
cv-280D). DTS has not participated in the Waltman proceeding, has had no access to the
discovery, and cannot reasonably be asked to litigate claims or defenses raised in a separate
action to which it is not a party. Moreover, it is completely improper and prejudicial for G-P to
seek judgment as a matter of law on duties owed to Mr. Waltman's here, as Mr. Waltman is not a
party to this litigation and has no opportunity to respond. As stated in DTS' Reply on the
Motion to Dismiss:

"Contrary to Plaintiff's arguments, the Court does not need to find G-P

negligent as a matter of law in Richard Waltman and R. Waltman Trucking v.
Georgia-Pacific, et al., (Civil No. 09-cv-280D) to grant DTS' motion, all that is

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 35 Filed 08/02/10 Page 2 of 10

needed is to review the allegations of the Complaint filed in that matter in light of
the agreement between G-P and DTS to determine whether the contractual duty to
indemnify and hold harmless is implicated by those allegations. The contract
clearly excludes any duty to indemnify or defend G-P for its own negligence and
that is all that has been alleged by Waltman."
The first fifteen pages of of G-P's twenty plus page brief, including al the alleged
"Undisputed Facts", refer only to claims and defenses in the underlying Waltman suit.
DTS simply has no knowledge or information as to those claims or defenses, and cannot
be called upon to litigate any of them as they are not germane to the sole issue in this
lawsuit, which is interpretation of the contractual indemnity under Georgia law.
To the extent that any response is required to G-P's statement of undisputed facts,
DTS states that it has no knowledge or information, has had no access to discovery in the
Waltman v. G-P case, and cannot reasonably be required to argue, or present evidence as
to any of the alleged facts. DTS further states that G-P's negligence is not at issue in this
action, and is not relevant to any claims against DTS.
II. There Is No Explicit, Affirmative Undertaking of Defense in the Contract.
G-P again argues that because "defense" is not specifically included in the contractual
exemption, that even if G-P was negligent DTS must provide a defense. However, G-P has it
backward. Under Georgia law a duty to defend, indemnify and/or hold an indemnitee harmless
for its own negligence must be affirmatively stated, it cannot be assumed or implied. "Jn
addition, the words of a contract of indemnification must be construed strictly against the
indemnitee. And every presumption is against such intention [to indemnify]. When an indemnity

agreement is ambiguous, such ambiguity must be construed against the drafter..." Service

Merchandise Co. v. Hunter Fan Co., 617 S.E.2d 237-8 (Ga. 2005).

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 35 Filed 08/02/10 Page 3 of 10

Nowhere in the contract, which was drafted by and must be narrowly construed against
G-P, is it affirmatively agreed that DTS undertakes to protect G-P from allegations of its own
acts or omissions. Nor may the Court assume or imply one from the absence of the word
"defense" in the exception.
"As a matter of law, the scope of the written indemnification provisions
must be strictly construed against SM, the indemnitee. Unless the words of a
contract explicitly show an agreement to indemnify another party for his own
negligence, such an agreement cannot be implied. This is so because:
[p]ublic policy is reluctant to cast the burden for negligent actions upon
those who are not actually at fault. Public policy seeks to encourage people to
exercise due care in their activities for fear of liability, rather than to act
carelessly cloaked with the knowledge that an indemnity contract will relieve such
indifference. Unless a contract for indemnification explicitly and expressly states

that the negligence of the indemnitee is covered, courts will not interpret such an

agreement as a promise to save the indemnitee from his own negligence." Id.
240.

DTS does not owe a duty of defense, because even though "defense" is not explicitly
exempted from the contractual indemnification, there was no explicit, affirmative assumption of
such a duty in the first place, and no such duty can be assumed, inferred or implied.

Procedurally, G-P cannot be granted partial summary judgment on this claim as it has
presented no statement of undisputed facts in regard to the contract claims, or alleged breach
thereof, entitling it to relief.

III DTS Fulfilled Its Contractual Duties Regarding Insurance of
R Waltman Trucking

Contrary to G-P's assertions, DTS did fulfill its contractual duties regarding insurance of
underlying carriers. The Acord Certificate of Liability Insurance issued for R Waltman to DTS'

sister company, Freight Agency, Inc., shows that Waltman had $1,000,000 Commercial General

 

`Tn fact public policy is so against indemnification provisions that Wyoming and Georgia, as well as over 20 other
States have enacted legislation voiding indemnification provisions in motor carrier transportation contracts. See GA
Code Section 46-7-12.1; and Session Law of WY, 2009 Ch. 187, 40-17-102 - Motor Carrier Indemnity Agreements
Void, attached.

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 35 Filed 08/02/10 Page 4 of 10

Liability and $1,000,000 Automobile Liability coverage from Continental Western insurance
company. (Attached as Exhibit 1). In fact, Waltman's coverage for Commercial General
Liability was actually higher than required as it had $1,000,000 per occurrence, whereas the G-P
contract only required $500,000.

Likewise, the only contractual requirement for Worker's Compensation was "with
statutory limits". Under Nebraska law, there is no statutory requirement for R Waltman
Trucking to obtain Worker's Compensation insurance for independent contractors such as Mr.
Waltman, so again DTS cannot be said to have breached G-P's contractual requirements. As a
matter of law and public policy, neither Worker's Compensation or Employer's Liability
insurance covers claims against non-employer, third parties, such as G-P, from claims arising
from their acts or omissions. "

The attached printout from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's website,
Safersys.org, shows that at the time of the accident and all times prior, R Waltman was in full
compliance with 49 CFR 387 - Minimum Levels of Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers.
(Exhibit 2) Under the regulations, motor carriers are required to have at least $750,000 bodily
injury and property damage insurance as a condition of licensing, and the carrier's insurer is
required to file the BMC-91 endorsement. The Safersys.org printout shows R Waltman had the
required insurance and endorsement in place from 1997 till it ceased operations in August 2007.
So again, G-P's assertion that DTS breached its contractual duties in regard to carrier insurance

is simply unfounded.

 

? As previously noted in DTS Reply on the Motion to Dismiss, public policy is so against indemnification provisions
that both Wyoming and Georgia, as well as over 20 other States have enacted legislation voiding indemnification
provisions in motor carrier transportation contracts. See GA Code Section 46-7-12.1; and Session Law of WY,
2009 Ch. 187, 40-17-102 - Motor Carrier Indemnity Agreements Void, attached.

3 There is no requirement in the cited regulation for motor carriers to obtain Worker's Compensation insurance,
which is a matter generally reserved to the States. See 49 CFR 387.

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 35 Filed 08/02/10 Page 5 of 10

But more importantly, DTS had no contractual obligation to require carriers to insure G-P
against claims arising from G-P's acts or omissions. Nowhere in the contract, which was drafted
by and must be narrowly construed against G-P, is it affirmatively agreed that DTS or underlying
carriers must insure G-P for its own acts or omissions. Service Merchandise Co. v. Hunter Fan
Co., 617 S.E.2d 237, 240 (Ga. 2005). As noted by the court in Georgia-Pacific, LLC, et al, v.
Swift Transportation Corporation, W2008-00344-COA-R3-CV (Tenn. App., 2008), reviewing
the exact same contract and claims:

"In sum, although an additional insured can be covered for its own

negligence, we find nothing in this contract to require such coverage. The

parties' contract set forth various risks assumed by Swift Transportation and

obligated Swift Transportation to obtain an insurance policy to cover risks

incident to the agreement. There is nothing in the contract to indicate an

agreement that Swift Transportation would obtain insurance against G-P's own

negligence."

DTS obtained proof of R Waltman Trucking's insurance as it was contractually required
to. However, nothing in the contract required DTS or underlying carriers, such as R Waltman
Trucking, to insure G-P "... to the extent that the action giving rise to the claim was caused by
an act or omission of G-P or its agents, servants or employees."

But again, procedurally, G-P cannot be granted partial summary judgment on this claim
as it has presented no statement of undisputed facts in regard to the contract claims, or alleged
breach thereof, entitling it to relief.

IV Specific Performance, Declaratory Judgment and Damages

To the extent that G-P asks the Court to look solely to contract in light of the allegations

of the Waltman suit to determine DTS' contractual obligations, DTS agrees, hence its Motion to

Dismiss. The contract clearly excludes any duty to indemnify, defend or insure G-P for its own

negligence and that is all that has been alleged by Waltman.

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 35 Filed 08/02/10 Page 6 of 10

DTS contends that it performed all contractual obligations and no further performance is
required, but even if it did not, specific performance would not give G-P coverage or defense for
the claims in the Waltman suit or any other claims alleging G-P's separate and sole negligence.

In keeping with public policy, ISO Form insurance policies are only triggered by the
acts of the first named insured, in this case DTS, or R Waltman Trucking. "Additional insured"
status would only cover G-P to the extent it was sued under a theory of vicarious liability or
respondeat superior for the acts or omissions of the first named insured. This is consistent with
the contract and public policy in that each party should be responsible for claims arising from its
own acts but should not have to bear the cost for the other's negligence. Such policies do not
ordinarily provide coverage or defense for an additional insured for claims arising from their
separate, or sole negligent acts or omissions. Neither DTS or Waltman Trucking's Commercial
General Liability, Auto Liability, Worker's Compensation, Employer's Liability insurance nor
additional insured designation would provide defense or coverage for G-P in the Waltman suit as
there are no allegations of negligence against DTS or R Waltman Trucking to trigger the policy.
No triggering event - no coverage or defense. DTS complied with its contractual obligations,
but even if it did not, specific performance would not afford G-P any relief for the Waltman
claim or any future claims alleging G-P's negligence.

G-P has not suffered any damages attributable to DTS. Nowhere does the contract
explicitly and affirmatively require DTS to defend, indemnify, insure or hold G-P harmless for
claims alleging G-P's negligence. DTS and Waltman had required insurance, but the insurance
was not triggered as there was no allegation of fault against DTS or Waltman. Additonal insured
status makes no difference, as there is no claim against the first named insured. In short, none of

G-P's claimed damages for defending against Mr. Waltman's suit are attributable to DTS.

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 35 Filed 08/02/10 Page 7 of 10

For these reasons, Defendant, Diversified Transfer and Storage, Inc. respectfully requests
the Court to deny Plaintiff, Georgia-Pacific's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, as DTS had
no contractual obligation to defend, indemnify or hold G-P harmless from its own acts or
omissions; no contractual obligation to obtain insurance covering or providing defense to G-P for
its own acts or omissions; and no contractual obligation to require other carriers to obtain
insurance covering G-P's own acts or omission; specific performance is unavailing, and none of
G-P's alleged damages are attributable to DTS.
