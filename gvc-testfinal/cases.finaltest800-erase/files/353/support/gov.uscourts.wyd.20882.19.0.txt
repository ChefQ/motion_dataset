Motion, Georgia-Pacific relies on the Memorandum of Law filed concurrently herewith and

all of the other pleadings and papers on file in this action,

Georgia-Pacific has shown that there are no issues of material fact and that it
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Specifically, the defense, indemnity and
insurance provisions of the Contract are valid and enforceable, Diversified has breached
each of the three contractual provisions, and Georgia-Pacific has suffered damages as a
result of the breach. Finally, Georgia-Pacific is entitled to the declaratory relief and specific
performance it seeks in the Complaint since Diversified has future obligations it must

perform pursuant to the Contract.

WHEREFORE Georgia-Pacific LLC respectfully requests the Court to enter
judgment in its favor, to order a hearing on the proper amount of damages if the parties
cannot agree to the same, for declaratory and equitable relief as sought in the Complaint, for
taxable costs and attorneys fees as sought in the Complaint, and for such other and further

relief as the Court may find just.
