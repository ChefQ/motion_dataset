NOTICE OF DEFENDANT'S INTENT TO PETITION
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR WRIT OF
CERTIORARI AND MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS

Defendant LFP Publishing Group, LLC, d/b/a Hustler Magazine, et al.
("LFP") hereby notifies the Court of its intent to petition the Supreme Court of the
`United States for writ of certiorari and respectfully moves this Court to stay
proceedings pending the resolution of said petition and, if granted, the merits of the
appeal. In support of this motion, LFP shows this honorable Court as follows:

I. On June 25, 2009, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals, 11"
Circuit (the "Panel") reversed and remanded this Court's October 6, 2008 Order

_ granting LFP's Motion to Dismiss, D.I. 13. |

2, LFP timely filed a Petition for Rehearing kn Banc, which petition was
denied by the Court of Appeals on August 27, 2009.

3. The Court of Appeals issued its Mandate on September 4, 2009, D.I.
27, and this Court adopted the Mandate by its Order signed on September 14,
2009, D.I. 28,

4, LFP hereby provides notice of its intent to file with the United States
Supreme Court on or before November 25, 2009, a petition for writ of certiorari to
review and reverse the serious Constitutional error of the Eleventh Circuit's June
25, 2009 decision.

5. LFP's certiorari petition will present a compelling case for review by
the United States Supreme Court; and specifically, seek certiorari raising, inter
alia, the following substantial questions of Constitutional importance:

A. Whether the decision of the Panel amounts to
= Content-based discrimination against speech

prohibited by the freedom of the press guaranteed
by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?

B. Whether the Panel's decision causes substantial
uncertainty regarding the media's right to
~comment and publish on matters of public interest,
and will result in an unconstitutional chilling effect
on the freedom of the press under the First
Amendment?

C. Whether the Panel's decision is based on an
unconstitutional and erroneous interpretation and

-2-

 
application of the Georgia common law right of
publicity as that tort is defined by the Georgia
Supreme Court?

D. Whether the Panel's decision is contrary to the
United States Supreme Court decisions in Zacchini
v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S.
562, 97 S. Ct. 2849 (1977) and Time v. Hill, 385
U.S. 374, 87 S. Ct. 534 (1967).

6, In light of the above and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying
Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Stay Proceedings, there is a
reasonable probability that LFP's petition for writ of certiorari will be granted, and
there is a significant possibility that the Eleventh Circuit's June 25, 2009 decision
wiil be reversed.

7. Given that a ruling on the petition could not possibly come before
mid-January 2010,' and is unlikely to come before the spring of 2010, if this

Motion to Stay Proceedings is denied and the petition for certiorari granted, LFP

will suffer irreparable harm. Specifically, LFP will likely be required to incur the

 

' LFP's petition is due on November 25, 2009; amicus curiae briefs in support of
the petition are anticipated and due no later than thirty days after the case is placed
on the United States Supreme Court docket, which in no case could be before

December 28, 2009; briefs in opposition of the petition if filed would likewise be

due no earlier than December 28, 2009, but likely later; and reply briefs, if any,
would at the earliest be due on January 7, 2010, but again, would much likely be
due later.

 
 

substantial burden and expense of litigating the merits of this case through fact
discovery; expert discovery; Daubert, summary judgment and other pre-trial
motions; and potentially a trial on the merits before a final resolution of the appeal
is accomplished.

8. Good cause, therefore, exists for this Court to grant LFP's Motion to
Stay Proceedings.

WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, LFP prays that this Court stay the
proceedings herein until such time as the Supreme Court of the United States has
ruled on LFP's petition for writ of certiorari, and if granted, until a final ruling on
the merits of the appeal.

Respectfully submitted this 17" day of September 2009.
