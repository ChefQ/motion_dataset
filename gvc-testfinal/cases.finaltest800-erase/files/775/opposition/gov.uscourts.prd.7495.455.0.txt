PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
In this copyright ownership and infringement action, the Estate of Catalino Curet Alonso
(the “Curet Alonso Estate” or “Estate”) seeks to intervene in order to assert entirely new and
unrelated breach contract claims against the Peer Parties. 1 The Estate claims that, under certain
songwriter agreements between Curet Alonso and Fania, it is entitled to a portion of the funds
that Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (“BPPR”) deposited with the Court pending determination of
the copyright ownership claims. However, under those same songwriter agreements, the Estate’s
right to receive royalties is conditioned on the Peer Parties’ right to apply income otherwise
payable as royalties to reimburse their legal fees incurred in defending Latin American Music
Co. and ACEMLA de Puerto Rico’s (“LAMCO/ACEMLA”) challenge to their copyright
ownership. The cost of this litigation has been significantly greater than the relatively modest
settlement proceeds allocated to the Peer Parties in respect of the Curet Alonso songs. Once
those proceeds are applied to legal fees and expenses, there will likely be nothing left of the
settlement fund for the Estate or any other royalty participant to recover.
This is both appropriate and just because the copyright ownership disputes arose due to
Curet Alonso’s unlawful attempt to assign his musical works to LAMCO/ACEMLA after he had
already transferred the same works to the Peer Parties decades earlier. Curet Alonso’s estate
should not be allowed to benefit from his deceitful double-dealing.
Moreover, the Estate’s motion to intervene is untimely, as it comes after eight years of
litigation, including full fact discovery, a half-dozen summary judgment motions, and two
lengthy settlement conferences resulting in a settlement agreement and entry of judgment

1

Although the Estate moves to intervene against all of the Peer Parties, the only contracts
in issue are between Curet Alonso and Fania Publishing, Inc. (“Fania”), a predecessor in interest
to only Sonido, Inc.

2

dismissing the Peer Parties under the terms of that settlement. Curet Alonso, who was a named
plaintiff in the consolidated copyright infringement action, had notice of every phase of this
litigation, including BPPR’s deposit of money with the Court. Because the Estate acquired all of
Curet Alonso’s rights and responsibilities, it is deemed to have had the same notice. As a result,
the Estate’s motion is clearly untimely and should therefore be denied.
The Peer Parties would be severely prejudiced if the Estate were permitted to undo the
carefully crafted settlement agreement and the judgment dismissing all claims against them. The
Estate, on the other hand, would suffer no prejudice from denial of its motion, as there are no
funds for it to collect after deduction of the Peer Parties’ reasonable attorneys fees.
Moreover, the Estate’s interest in obtaining royalties under the Curet Alonso songwriter
agreements is adequately represented by the Peer Parties who, under those agreements, are
entrusted with collecting income and distributing royalties for Curet Alonso’s songs. The
Estate’s involvement would therefore add nothing but additional expense and delay to this
already prolonged and costly litigation.
Even if the Estate had a right to intervene to assert its royalty claims (which it does not)
the Court would not have jurisdiction to decide those claims because they arise only under state
law, and the federal copyright ownership claims involving Curet Alonso’s songs have all been
dismissed. Lastly, the Estate’s motion must be denied because it fails to attach a proposed
pleading as mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
BACKGROUND
On or about January 31, 2001, BPPR filed suit against several music publishers,
including the Peer Parties, LAMCO/ACEMLA and others, seeking to determine the ownership to
copyrights in certain songs used in BPPR’s Christmas Specials. The copyright ownership

3

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Document 455

Filed 11/16/2009

Page 4 of 17

dispute arose because several composers, including Curet Alonso, had transferred their
copyrighted works to the Peer Parties in the 1960s, and then purported to transfer the same works
to LAMCO/ACEMLA in the 1990s. Because BPPR was unsure which group of music
publishers owned the copyrighted songs, and therefore to which group it owed royalties for the
Christmas Specials, on May 25, 2001, BPPR deposited $179,620 with the Court. (Dkt. 25.)
On April 19, 2001, LAMCO/ACEMLA and several songwriters, including Curet Alonso,
filed an action against BPPR for copyright infringement of many of the same songs involved in
the copyright ownership dispute. The two actions were consolidated on August 6, 2001. (Dkt.
38.) Curet Alonso therefore had notice of all filings in both consolidated actions since at least
August 2001.
Following the resolution of other related litigation, the parties engaged in extensive
discovery during the spring and summer of 2009. During August and September 2009, the
parties briefed at least six separate motions for summary judgment, which the Court decided on
October 9, 2009.
Also on October 9, 2009, the Court held a lengthy pretrial/settlement conference attended
by all attorneys of record. (Dkt. 428.) On October 10, 2009, the Peer Parties filed an
informative motion stating that they had reached a settlement with LAMCO/ACEMLA under the
terms presented to the Court during the October 9, 2009 conference. (Dkt. 418.) The settlement
contemplated distributing the funds BPPR had deposited with the Court (the “Settlement Funds”)
according to the number of songs each music publisher claimed to own. That same day, the
Court entered an Order directing the Peer Parties and LAMCO/ACEMLA to file a joint motion
to dismiss based on the settlement, and noting that a second settlement conference would be held
on October 13, 2009. (Dkt. 420, 424.) A bench trial was held on October 16, 2009 to decide the

4

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Document 455

Filed 11/16/2009

Page 5 of 17

ownership of one song disputed between LAMCO/ACEMLA and another music publisher,
Universal Music, Ltd. (Dkt. 429.)
In accordance with the Court’s October 10, 2009 Order, on October 27, 2009 the Peer
Parties and LAMCO/ACEMLA filed their Confidential Settlement Agreement (“Settlement
Agreement”) and the Peer Parties moved for an Order, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
directing the Court to disburse to the Peer Parties their portion of the Settlement Funds. (Dkt.
433, 434.) Three days later, on October 30, 2009, the Court entered an Order approving the
Settlement Agreement, as well as an Order granting the Peer Parties’ motion to disburse their
portion of the Settlement Funds, which amounted to approximately 40% of the Settlement Funds.
(Dkt. 435, 436.) Finally, on October 30, 2009, the Court entered judgment dismissing all claims
against the Peer Parties pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. (Dkt. 437.)
On October 31, 2009, the Curet Alonso Estate moved for a stay of the Court’s Order
granting the Peer Parties’ motion to disburse the Settlement Funds, stating that it intended to file
a motion to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). (Dkt. 438) The Estate filed its
motion to intervene of right on November 9, 2009. (Dkt. 452.) In its motion, the Estate asserts
that “[a]s a composer of such songs, whenever [Curet Alonso] assigned them to [sic] Publishing
Company, he was entitled to, at least, a fifty percent (50%) share in music royalties” (Estate’s
Mot. at 2) and asks the Court to withhold the Settlement Funds that are to be paid to the Peer
Parties.
The Estate also claims that on March 31, 2006, Peer International Corp. and its sister
company, Southern Music Publishing Company, Inc., assigned their rights to certain of Curet
Alonso’s songs to Curet Alonso’s heirs. (Estate’s Mot. at 6-7.) Although that assignment did
not involve Fania or any of the Curet Alonso songs at issue in this litigation, and it was, by its

5

own terms, effective as of March 31, 2006, the Estate paradoxically claims that it is “entitled to
any sums of money related to Tite Curet’s compositions to which the Peer parties may have had
any rights in the past.” (Estate’s Mot. at 6) (emphasis added).
For the reasons discussed below, the Estate’s motion to intervene should be denied.
ARGUMENT
The First Circuit has established that a motion to intervene of right under Rule 24(a) 2 will
be denied unless the movant meets four criteria. “First, the application must be timely. Second,
the applicant must have a direct and substantial interest in the subject matter of the litigation.
Third, the applicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical
matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest. Finally, the applicant’s interest must
be inadequately represented by existing parties.” Caterino v. Barry, 922 F.2d 37, 39-40 (1st Cir.
1990) (citing Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, 884 F.2d 629, 637 (1st Cir. 1989)). “An
‘applicant who fails to meet any one of these requirements cannot intervene.’” United States v.
Puerto Rico, 227 F.R.D. 28, 30 (D. P.R. 2005) (quoting Conservation Law Found. of New
England, Inc. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1992)).
As shown below, the Curet Alonso Estate fails on all four of these requirements.
I.

THE CURET ALONSO ESTATE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS
MOTION IS TIMELY
The First Circuit has recognized that Rule 24’s timeliness requirement is of “first

importance” in ruling on a motion to intervene. Caterino v. Berry, 922 F.2d at 40 (citation

2

Rule 24(a), “Intervention of Right,” provides, in relevant part:
On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who . . . claims
an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,
and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or
impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties
adequately represent that interest.

omitted); see also Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Greenblatt, 964 F.2d 1227, 1230 (1st Cir.
1992) (“We have made it pellucidly clear that Rule 24’s timeliness requirement is of great
importance.”). The purpose of the timeliness requirement is to uphold equitable principles. As
the First Circuit has recognized, “it [would be] inequitable to allow a latecomer, who fiddled
while Rome burned, to collect a share of the dire insurance.” Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1234.
In considering the timeliness requirement, courts in this Circuit consider: “(i) the length
of time the prospective intervenors knew or reasonably should have known of their interest
before they petitioned to intervene; (ii) the prejudice to existing parties due to the intervenor’s
failure to petition for intervention promptly; (iii) the prejudice the proposed intervenors would
suffer if not allowed to intervene; and (iv) the existence of unusual circumstances militating for
or against intervention.” Caterino, 922 F.2d at 40 (quoting Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15,
17, 20-24 (1st Cir. 1980)). All four of these factors weigh against the Estate’s intervention.
A. Curet Alonso and the Estate Had Notice of the Settlement Funds More than
Eight Years Ago
“One of the core purposes of the timeliness requirement is to prevent disruptive, latestage intervention that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable diligence.” R&G
Mortgage Corp. v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 584 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2009). “When
the applicant appears to have been aware of the litigation but has delayed unduly seeking to
intervene, courts generally have been reluctant to allow intervention.” 7C Wright, Miller &
Kane, Fed. Prac. and Proc. § 1916 at 539-540 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter “Wright & Miller”).
In United States v. Puerto Rico, 227 F.R.D. 28, the court held that “[i]ntervenors have
failed to comply with the first requirement, timeliness” where the suit was filed four years before
the motion to intervene, and the proposed intervenor had notice that its interest might be
adversely affected two years before the motion to intervene was filed. Id. at 31. Even the Estate

7

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Document 455

Filed 11/16/2009

Page 8 of 17

recognizes that one of the timeliness factors is “when the intervener learned of the effect of the
pending lawsuit on his interest[.]” (Estate’s Mot. at 4)
The Estate unreasonably delayed bringing its intervention motion for an even longer
period of time than the movant in United States v. Puerto Rico. BPPR’s copyright ownership
action was commenced on January 31, 2001, and the copyright infringement action – in which
Curet Alonso was a named plaintiff – was commenced on April 19, 2001, more than eight years
before the Estate’s motion to intervene. Moreover, the docket shows that the Settlement Funds
in which the Curet Alonso Estate now claims a royalty interest were deposited into Court on May
25, 2001. (Dkt. 25.) Curet Alonso therefore had notice of the existence of the Settlement Funds
since at least August 6, 2001, when the infringement action was consolidated with BPPR’s
copyright ownership action. Under Article 599 and 603 of the Civil Code, a decedent’s rights
and obligations are transmitted to his heirs at the moment of death. See 31 LPRA §§ 2081, 2085;
Cabassa v. Registry of Property, 116 D.P.R. 861 (1986) (successors in mortis causa are
subrogated in the deceased’s assets and rights). As a result, the Estate stands in the shoes of
Curet Alonso, and is charged with whatever notice he had. 3 There is therefore no question that
the Estate knew or should reasonably have known of its purported interest in the action more
than eight years before its belated motion to intervene. 4
Furthermore, “the status of the case at the time when intervention is attempted” is “highly
relevant” and “[t]he more advanced the litigation, the more searching the scrutiny which the
3

Even if the Estate were somehow not charged with having the same notice as Curet
Alonso had, the Estate came into existence and acquired all of Curet Alonso’s rights and
responsibilities when he died on August 5, 2003, and therefore had notice of the existence of the
Settlement Funds for at least six years.
4

Notably, the Estate’s current attorney, Mr. Pamias-Portalatin, previously represented
one of the defendants in the BPPR action, Guillermo Venegas Lloveras, Inc., until he was
replaced by other counsel on August 19, 2008. (Dkt. 207.) Thus, even the Estate’s counsel has
been fully aware of the action and of the existence of the Settlement Funds for many years.

8

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

motion must withstand.” Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1231. In United States v. Puerto Rico, the
court denied the motion to intervene where the “proceeding has advanced to a stage in which
there is little for the Court to do other than oversee the compliance with the settlement agreement
between the parties.” 227 F.R.D. at 31. Because of the important interests in finality of
judgments, “courts have historically viewed post-judgment intervention with a jaundiced eye in
situations where the applicant had a reasonable basis for knowing, before final judgment, that its
interest was at risk.” Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1231.
As in United States v. Puerto Rico, the Estate’s motion comes after all claims have been
dismissed, judgment entered, and all that is left to do is distribute the Settlement Funds according
to the Settlement Agreement. Moreover, as discussed above, the Estate had ample notice and
opportunity to assert whatever royalty claims it believed it had prior to the settlement and
dismissal of claims against the Peer Parties. This factor therefore cuts sharply against the
Estate’s motion to intervene.
B. The Peer Parties Would Be Prejudiced if the Estate Were Allowed to Overturn
the Settlement Agreement and the Judgment Dismissing the Peer Parties
Courts have recognized that parties to a fully executed settlement agreement will be
prejudiced if the agreement is disturbed by a belated intervenor. See Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at
1232 (the purpose of the timeliness requirement is “to prevent last minute disruption of
painstaking work by the parties and the court.”); R&G Mortgage, 584 F.3d at 9 (denying motion
to intervene where intervention was aimed at disrupting a settlement agreement).
Courts are particularly unwilling to allow intervention after judgment has been entered
based on the settlement agreement. See Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1232 (“Once settlement efforts
are completed and embodied in a final judgment, the parties expected to be able to tailor their
future actions and decisions in reliance on that judgment. It follows inexorably that modifying a

9

settlement term can knock the props out from under justifiable reliance of this sort.”); 6 James
W.M. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice § 24.21[2], at 24-88 (Matthew Bender 3d ed. 2009)
(hereinafter “Moore’s Federal Practice”) (“Generally, a motion to intervene after the parties
have settled and the case has been dismissed will clearly prejudice the settling parties, because
the movant seeks to revive the dismissed action.”) (citation omitted).
As the Court is well aware, the Peer Parties and LAMCO/ACEMLA reached the
Settlement Agreement only after eight years of protracted litigation followed by extensive
settlement negotiations and the assistance of the Court. Moreover, judgment has been entered
pursuant to the Settlement Agreement dismissing all claims against the Peer Parties. The Peer
Parties are entitled to rely on the finality of that judgment. There is no question that the Estate’s
motion is designed to frustrate the court-approved Settlement Agreement. Indeed, obstructing
the Settlement Agreement by withholding disbursement of the Settlement Funds is the sole
purpose of the Estate’s motion. Allowing the Estate to intervene would therefore result in
significant prejudice to the Peer Parties.
C. The Estate Would Suffer No Prejudice From Denial of Its Motion
“The penultimate factor in the four-part test focuses on what prejudice an applicant will
suffer if intervention is denied. This requires that [the Court] determine whether the movant, had
intervention been allowed, would have enjoyed a significant probability of success on the
merits.” Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1232 (citations omitted).
The Estate claims it is entitled to 50% of that portion of the Settlement Funds applicable
to songs written by Curet Alonso as royalty payments under certain contracts with the Peer
Parties. Copies of Curet Alonso’s songwriter agreements with Sonido’s predecessor (Fania) are

10

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Document 455

Filed 11/16/2009

Page 11 of 17

attached as Exhibit 1. 5 Although those songwriter agreements do provide for Curet Alonso to
receive royalties for certain uses of his songs, they also entitle Sonido to withhold any monies
otherwise payable to Curet Alonso as royalties in the event claims are asserted challenging
Sonido’s rights to the compositions, and to deduct from such monies Sonido’s damages,
including its reasonable attorneys fees. 6 As a result, because LAMCO/ACEMLA challenged
Sonido’s ownership of the Curet Alonso compositions in this action, Sonido is entitled to retain
any funds payable to Curet Alonso and deduct its attorney’s fees from those funds.
Over the course of this eight year litigation, the Peer Parties have expended hundreds of
thousands of dollars defending LAMCO/ACEMLA’s copyright ownership claims. Indeed, in
2009 alone, legal fees have been $210,890, not including local counsel’s fees. Those fees far
outweigh the 40% of the Settlement Funds allocated to the Peer Parties as part of the Settlement
Agreement. Thus, after properly applying the Peer Parties’ portion of the Settlement Funds to
cover their attorney’s fees and expenses, there is nothing left for Curet Alonso or his Estate to
recover. The Estate therefore cannot demonstrate a significant probability of success on the
merits, and would suffer no prejudice from a denial of its motion to intervene.
D. Equitable Considerations Require Denial of the Estate’s Motion
“This last prong of the test necessitates consideration of unusual features militating in
favor of, or against, intervention.” Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1233. Here, the equities weigh
strongly against the Curet Alonso Estate. The underlying dispute over Curet Alonso’s
5

Notably, the Estate did not attach any of these agreements to its papers, and merely
asserts that “[a]s composer of such songs, whenever he [Curet Alonso] assigned them to
Publishing Company, he was entitled to, at least, a fifty percent (50%) share in music royalties.”
(Estate’s Mot. 1.)
6

See Exhibit 1, Section 11(a) (“If a claim is presented against the Publisher [Fania]
alleging that the Composition is an infringement or invasion of the rights of others,” Fania may
retain all monies payable to Curet Alonso, and Fania’s damages in respect of such claims
“including reasonable attorney’s fees . . . shall not be limited to the monies retained hereunder.”)

11

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Page 12 of 17

copyrighted compositions arose because Curet Alonso attempted to sell copyrights to
LAMCO/ACMELA even though he had already transferred those same copyrights to Sonido’s
predecessor decades earlier. (See Peer Parties’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 328 at 2, 6,
17-18.) If the Estate were allowed to intervene to assert claims to the Settlement Funds, the
Estate would effectively be allowed to profit from Curet Alonso’s duplicitous double-dealing.
In sum, all factors weigh against the timeliness of the Estate’s motion.
II.

THE ESTATE DOES NOT CLAIM A DIRECT INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT OF
THE ACTION
The First Circuit has acknowledged that “the intervenor’s claims must bear a sufficiently

close relationship to the dispute between the original litigants” and its interest must be “‘direct,
substantial, and legally protectible.’” Travelers Indemnity Co., 884 F.2d at 638 (quoting Flynn v.
Hubbard, 782 F.2d 1084, 1092 (1st Cir. 1986) (Coffin, J., concurring).
The underlying litigation involved disputes over the ownership of certain copyrighted
compositions, and whether BPPR infringed those copyrights by using them in its Christmas
Specials. As noted above, the Curet Alonso Estate does not claim to own any of the disputed
copyrights, and therefore has no interest in the subject of the action. 7 Instead, the Estate claims
merely a royalty interest in the Settlement Funds. But that interest arises only through Curet
Alonso’s songwriter agreements with Sonido’s predecessor, Fania. Under those agreements,
only Fania or its successor, and not Curet Alonso or the Estate, is entitled to collect royalties for
7

The Estate’s assertion that Peer Music International Corp. and its affiliate, Southern
Music Publishing Company, Inc. relinquished their rights to certain Curet Alonso compositions
as of March 31, 2006 is wholly irrelevant for two reasons. First, none of the Curet Alonso works
involved in this action are included in the list of relinquished works (Compare Estate’s Mot. at 4
n.2 with Estate Mot. at Ex. 3.) That is because all of the Curet Alonso compositions at issue are
owned by Sonido (successor to Fania), not Peer or Southern. Second, even if the compositions at
issue were owned by Peer or Southern, the relinquishment was effective as of March 31, 2006,
and therefore could not entitle the Estate to any royalties with respect to the pre-2001 uses of
Curet Alonso’s works that were involved in this action.

12

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

the subject Curet Alonso compositions. As a result, the Estate’s has no “direct” interest in the
Settlement Fund, and its motion to intervene should be denied. See Travelers Indemnity Co., 884
F.2d at 638. Stated another way, neither Curet Alonso nor the Curet Alonso Estate had standing
to obtain royalty payments directly from BPPR. As such, it has no interest in this income now.
If the Estate believes that Sonido has not appropriately distributed royalties pursuant to
the Curet Alonso songwriter agreements, its proper remedy would be to commence a separate,
independent action in a court of competent jurisdiction for breach of contract,8 but it would still
not have any direct interest in the subject of this action or the Settlement Funds themselves.
III.

RESOLUTION OF THE UNDERLYING ACTION WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON
THE ESTATE’S CLAIMED RIGHT TO ROYALTIES
Rule 24(a) requires that the prospective intervenor’s interest be “so situated that

disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect
its interest[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). Even assuming that the Estate did have a sufficiently direct
interest in the subject of this copyright ownership and infringement action – as opposed to an
interest in the Curet Alonso songwriter agreements – resolution of the underlying action and
disbursement of the Settlement Funds will not affect the Estate’s interest in those songwriter
agreements. As explained above, the Settlement Funds will properly be applied towards the
substantial legal costs of this litigation, and there will be nothing left for the Estate to recover.

8

Of course, in any such action, Sonido would likely assert counterclaims against the
Estate based on Curet Alonso’s improper attempt to transfer to LAMCO/ACEMLA copyrights
that he had already transferred to Fania, and it would seek to recover the full extent of its
attorney’s fees.

THE ESTATE’S INTEREST UNDER THE SONGWRITER AGREEMENTS IS
ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY THE MUSIC PUBLISHERS WHO ARE
CHARGED WITH COLLECTING INCOME AND DISTRIBUTING ROYALTY
PAYMENTS
Intervention of right requires not only a showing of a legally protectable interest, but a

showing that the existing parties do not adequately represent that interest. Fed. R. Civ. P
24(a)(2). “[W]here the intervenor’s ultimate objective matches that of the named party, a
rebuttable presumption of adequate representation applies.” Costa v. Margotta, Gund, Budd &
Dzera, LLC, 281 Fed. App’x 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2008) (Unpublished) (citations omitted).
The Estate makes absolutely no showing why the current parties do not adequately
represent its interests, and merely asserts, without any support, that “[a]t this moment it is clear
that the parties involved in this transaction do not have the intention of paying the corresponding
share of royalties to the Curet heirs[.]” (Estate’s Mot. at 2.) In fact, the Curet Alonso songwriter
agreements transferred Curet Alonso’s copyrighted compositions to Fania, and charged Fania or
its successor with collecting income generated through use of the Curet Alonso compositions and
paying the writer’s share to the royalty participants (after deducting attorney’s fees). Sonido’s
and the Estate’s interests with respect to the Settlement Fund are therefore identical – to obtain as
large a portion as possible. The Estate makes no showing why its interests with respect to the
Settlement Fund are not adequately represented, and its motion should therefore be denied.
V.

THE COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE CURET ALONSO
ESTATE’S PURELY STATE-LAW CONTRACT CLAIM
Even if the Estate could establish its entitlement to intervene of right (which it cannot),

the its motion should be denied because the Court would have no independent grounds for
jurisdiction over the Estate’s proposed claims. 7C Wright & Miller § 1920 at 491 (“[A]n
intervenor can proceed to decision after a dismissal of the original action . . . if there are
independent grounds for jurisdiction of the intervenor's claim”).

The Estate essentially claims that the Peer Parties breached the Curet Alonso songwriter
agreements by not paying royalties owed to it. However, there would be no federal subject
matter jurisdiction over such claims because it arises purely under state law. See 3 Melville B.
Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12.01[A][2], at 12-22.5 (Matthew Bender,
Rev. Ed. 2009) (“State and not federal courts have jurisdiction in contract actions for
nonpayment of royalties arising out of the exploitation of copyrighted works.”) (collecting
cases). There would also be no supplemental jurisdiction over the Estate’s state-law claims
because all federal claims related to the Curet Alonso compositions have already been dismissed.
See 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Thus, even if the Estate met all requirements under Rule 24(a) (which it
does not), its motion should still be denied.
VI.

THE ESTATE’S FAILURE TO ATTACH A PROPOSED PLEADING REQUIRES
DENIAL OF ITS MOTION
The Peer Parties are, to some degree, left to guess what claims the Estate would actually

assert if it were allowed to intervene. For that reason, Rule 24 provides that a motion to
intervene “must . . . be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which
intervention is sought.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c) (emphasis added). Because the Estate does not
attach any proposed pleading, its motion should be denied. See 6 Moore’s Federal Practice §
24.20, at 24-81 to 24-82 (“The selection of the word ‘must’ in the restyling of Rule 24(c) was not
in error . . . [A] district court will be unable to evaluate a motion to intervene, and the existing
parties will be unable to make a meaningful response to the motion, unless they know exactly
what claims or defenses the movant proposes to bring to the lawsuit. A proposed pleading is,
therefore, an essential part of the motion.”).
