PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Estate party is not and has not been a party to the lead case, 01-1142 (GAG).
The Estate was not a party to the latter case, 01-1161, when the case began in 2001 as the
composer was alive, and he and other composers were named plaintiff parties for moral
rights claims.

These named plaintiffs were in addition to the LAMCO/ACEMLA

party(s), the LAMCO party, who have been and are the only proper party claiming
ownership on behalf of the assignment by the composer Curet, and who have standing to
bring copyright ownership and infringement claims against the defendant, Banco Popular
de Puerto Rico. (BPPR). They were represented by the LAMCO/ACEMLA attorneys.
Some of the Curt songs were also claimed by the PEER party, also named
defendants in the lead case. This was known from 2001 and there was never any claim
by this intervening party at any time which was eventually resolved by the Confidential
Agreement.
The composer Curet died in 2003 and as this case was stayed, the Estate is
represented by their present attorney, Hoglund & Pamias, P.S.C., Attorney Pamias since
August 18, 2008, when they filed their Motion to Substitute counsel. See Dk. 206.
On August 19, 2008, said Motion that was granted by this Court.
The record shows that attorney Heath W. Hoglund, from the same firm of
Hoglund & Pamias, P.S.C., had first appeared on August 21, 2002 for the Guillermo
Venegas party on August 21, 2002. See Dk. 93.
On July 27, 2006, Attorney Sammuel Pamias and Attorney Hoglund moved to
withdraw as counsel for the Venegas party. See Dk. 152.

On December 3, 2006, Attorney Pamias filed a Second Motion to Withdraw as
Attorney, See Dk. 170.
On December 4, 2006, the Court granted the motion to withdraw. See Dk. 171.
On December 8, 2006, a Motion in Compliance was filed by the Attorneys
Hoglund & Pamias, P.S.C. See Dk. 173. Said Motion noted by this Court on that same
date. See Dk. 174.
This record of the legal representation is important as to the intervening party’s
Motion to Intervene and the issue of timeliness, standing, etc, but not to whether there is
an actual or potential conflict of interest, in that the Venegas Party did Counter-Claim
and sued the same LAMCO/ACEMLA party that represented the Curet composer from
the commencement of this case in 2001 until August 19, 2008. The record clearly shows
that actual representation by these attorneys began from August 21, 2002 and continued
until December 4, 2006 and then once again (re) appeared with the current Estate party
on August 18, 2008. This records shows that in representing more than one party in this
litigation since 2002, these attorneys were involved and knew of the double claims for the
Curet songs.
On October 9, 2009 Status Conference, all of the parties spend five (5) hours on
October 9, 2009, the Peer and LAMCO hashed out an agreement. The Universal and
LAMCO parties did not agreed and the case was set for trial on October 17, 2009, as the
same was held on that date. During this time, intervening party attorney was present,
waiting, discussing matters with other attorneys, including the undersigned attorney and
the PEER attorneys.

On October 13, 2009, all of the parties, including the Estate party, spent 5.5 hours
discussing the same agreement whereby the BPPR party attempted to undo what had
been agreed to on the October 9, 2009. This was in Chambers, with the presence of
Attorney Pamias for the Estate party. The issues raised in their motion were not raised or
discussed by them. A copy of said the proposed agreement between PEER and LAMCO
was given to BPPR for their review and consent, or approval not to contest it. Contrary
to its motion, with omitted and misstated representations to his Court, the Estate party
was privy to the agreement, as the Agreement was available in hard copy during the
breaks, having been reviewed by the BPPR attorneys, Prado and Ramos, and other
parties, and the Estate attorney Pamias discussed the Agreement with the undersigned,
with the BPPR attorneys, and with the PEER parties.
Additionally, at the same October 13, 2009 Settlement Conference held in
Chambers for five and one half (5.5) hour conference, the Honorable Judge Gelpi asked
each of the attorneys, including the Estate attorney, that if the Court accepted the
Agreement, over the objections by BPPR, would the attorneys agree that they would be
out of the lead case, and all, including Attorney Pamias, agreed. The motion to intervene
at p. 2, par. 3 states that the Estate (Heirs) were not privy to the Agreement which is
against the record, is without any merit and is not true.
This same Estate party has stated that it will not pursue its infringement claims in
the latter case as plaintiffs, they have never filed any dispositive motions, never appeared
at any of the many depositions, never or participated in discovery, did not adopt any
expert opinion from the LAMCO party against the Pena/Altamar parties, and have only
been present at the Status Conference but have not prosecuted any of its plaintiff claims.

On the October 17, 2009 Status Conference, BPPR did not oppose the
agreement.

While the undersigned attorney was late and was not present at said

conference, and was excused by the Court thereafter, but this was the representation
made by BPPR Attorney Ramos, and other attorneys, after said conference. It was also
indicated to the undersigned by the other attorneys, that the remaining latter case of
copyright infringements would be sent to non-binding mediation for early next year, a
pretrial would be set in December, and eventual trial, if needed, for March 2010.
No Minute Entry has been issued to date by this Honorable Court. The Court indicated
that there was time permitted to file the agreement.
It was and is, a consideration to the LAMCO/ACEMLA parties entering
the Settlement Agreement, that the performance and other infringements claims for the
1999 and other Bank Specials for the remaining works would go forward, along with the
other claims in the complaint, and that the funds would be distributed thereafter.
The motion also attempts to untimely due what has already been done, the Court
having accepted the agreement, dismissed the PEER parties and entered Judgment,
accordingly.
There can be no issuance of any Order contrary to the expressed terms of the
agreement, nor any Order to stay of disbursement of funds or issuance of any Order
changing the Settlement Agreement already approved by this Court. This after the fact
motion is without any merit as the Estate is not a party to the agreement, and their explicit
if not implicit approval, estoppels them and prevents them from going against their own
attorney representations to this Honorable Court.

III.

LEGAL ARGUMENT

1. THE MOTION TO INTERVENE MUST BE DENIED AS
UNTIMELY
Some of the factors for the Court to consider for the granting or denial of the
Motion to Intervene, are the timeliness of the request and the likelihood that parties
already involved in the lawsuit will protect the interveners’ interests. Banco Popular v,
Greenlatt, 964 F.2d 1227, 1231 (1st Cir. 1992)(timeliness).
Never has this party sought to intervene in the lead case since 2001 despite being
represented and even after involved in the discussions and review of the settlement. The
waiting until after issuance is untimely and improper and should not be allowed.
The presence with the October 13, 2009 conference constitutes waiver of any
basis now to object to an agreement of ownership where they are not a party and their
interests are protected.
The motion to intervene also alludes to another pending complaint, filed January
3, 2006, some almost four years ago to date, now pending before this Court, since March
2009, a issue which was raised on October 9, 2009 in Open Court by this same attorney
and that was not granted by this Court.
This tactic of wait until the agreement is reached and then make a move is a bad
faith and wrong calculated move by this party. No further determination should be
allowed to be stayed especially when that case is also a 2006 case and there is no date to
be decided.
Furthermore Curet Estate submits a purported “quitclaim” of works from Peer
Southern as an exhibit. Peer Southern cannot quitclaim and assign works they purport to

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Filed 11/10/2009

Page 7 of 11

have owned without anything else. Moreover, none of the Curet songs in this dispute are
listed in such a document. Thus, such exhibit is also useless.
The claim of copyright infringement is not actionable between co-owners, even if
the “beneficial owners” are entitled to 50% royalties. The entitlement to 50% royalties for
the “beneficial owners” is not disputed. What the appearing parties opposed in the
instant filing is that the motion to intervene seeks to by-pass, alter and amend the
contractual agreement between the composer and publishers which is not allowed under
copyright law.
In their motion for summary judgment, Altamar Music Co.,/Pena party argued
that between alleged co-owners, Jimmy Sabater and Joe Cuba, there cannot be any
infringement claims between co-owners regarding their double claimed song, Bang Bang.
See list of cases cited at Dk. 330. This is not the case with the Estate. Moreover, the
Curet Estate is only a “beneficial owner” duly entitled to receive their share of royalties
through their assignment to the LAMCO publishers and through their non-exclusive
performance assignment to ACEMLA. 1
Furthermore, the Estate may have in some uncertain future all the remedy and
relief requested granted in that lawsuit, if they were to prevail in that litigation, and no
stay herein would affect that outcome or any post-judgment relief or appeal. If the estate
party losses, they may be liable for attorneys’ fees and not entitled to anything in the
future. This Court cannot allow the Estate to seek injunctive relief in this case for that
another case that they have not sought the same relief. They are now estopped from their
own omissions and actions to date and this blatant attempt to receive benefits not within
the industry custom and practice must not be allowed.

If Courts should now permit the composers to intervene in copyright actions filed
by their publishers, it would open the flood gates for interveners without necessity as they
always have available actions against their own publishers. The motion cites no caselaw
to support its request in a copyright case under the facts of our case.
Contrary to the motions allegations, the LAMCO owners as owners cannot be
infringers to copyright from the composers or “beneficial owners” as are the Curet heirs
in the pending case. See Dk. 330.
Also, the Exhibit 1 submitted to the Motion is improper as it is the ACEMLA
non-exclusive assignment contract, for performance, not the LAMCO publishers contract
establishing ownership transfer to LAMCO from the composer. See Dk. 337, Exhibit 24
A-H, Ex. 25.
What the motion fails to state to this Honorable Court is that the publishers have
paid the composer over hundreds of thousands of dollars while collecting some fortythousand dollars because of double claims for the Curet music. Thus, all and any
payments received in royalties are periodically notified by LAMCO to the Estate (Curet
heirs), they are duly reported, they are properly credited and recouped, if appropriate.
This is the contract, this is the practice in the industry and the interveners have already
filed their claims in another case and cannot use this case to circumvent, enjoin, or alter
that legal relationship by their motion. The 2006 case has not affected this case to date
and should not affect this case now. The motion is late, not forthcoming and is without
any merit.

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

The motion also attempts to untimely due what has already been done, the Court
having accepted the agreement, having dismissed the PEER parties and has entered
Judgment, accordingly. See Dk.
This Court should not issue any Order contrary to the expressed terms of the
agreement, nor issue any Order to stay of disbursement of funds or issuance of any Order
changing the Settlement Agreement already approved by this Court. This after the fact
motion is without any merit as the Estate is not a party to the agreement, and their explicit
if not implicit approval, estoppels them and prevents them from going against their own
attorney representations to this Honorable Court.
Thus, the motion to intervene must be denied as their interests are protected, the
requests are without any standing and are untimely.

2. THE ISSUE OF OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND THERE
IS NO STANDING TO INTERVENE

The declaratory judgment lead case was about copyright ownership. The
exclusive assignments are ownership governed by the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. section
101.
The composer Curet assigned the ownership to LAMCO which is undisputed.
The U.S. Copyright Office Certificates of Registration and Recordations filed by
LAMCO/ASCEMLA gives then standing to claim ownership, not the actual composers
within their catalogue that they represent. See Dk. 337 Ex. 24A-H. Ex 25.
The publisher’s duties are to distribute the royalties to their composers through
their usual industry business practices and periodically reporting. There is no standing

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Document 453

Filed 11/10/2009

Page 10 of 11

10
for any of the composers, whether against PEER, LAMCO or any publishing entity to
intervene in copyright cases to claim royalties directly from infringers or parties. The
1999 Special was at a time when the composer was alive and LAMCO was the proper
claimant. LAMCO is still the owner of the Curet works. The PEER consolidated action
resolved some but not all claims for double claims between LAMCO and PEER, but not
as to some renewal rights.
The Estate (Heirs) are not copyright owners, rather what the U.S. Copyright Acts
states as “Beneficial Owners” and take the place of the composer to receive the
contractual benefits. Because of the death of the composer, they may have acquired
some, and few, Renewal Rights of certain songs. None of these renewal rights pertain to
any of the Curet songs in LAMCO share.
Thus, the motion seeks to receive directly from this Court, for an alleged 50%
share which is not the contractual agreement between the parties that cannot be altered by
their motion to intervene.

The granting of the motion would re-open the instant

litigations, put the parties in their original positions and would go against the Orders of
this Court. As the Court has accepted the Agreement, it cannot then grant the motion as
it goes against the parties considerations in accepting the same and receiving payments.
WHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court deny
motion to intervene in its entirety as it is untimely, lacks standing, it is improper and
should not collaterally attached other pending litigation.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED:
CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE: I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and exact
copy of the foregoing document has been filed with the Clerk of Court using manual
