DEFENDANT

RESPONSE OF TROUT POINT LODGE LIMITED, VAUGHAN
PERRET AND CHARLES LEARY TO DEFENDANT DOUG K.
HANDSHOE’S MOTION TO TAX ATTORNEYS FEES

INTRODUCTION.
On December 19, 2012 the Court entered summary judgment in favor of Mr. Handshoe
[Docket No. 35], and on September 10, 2013 he filed his Motion to Tax Attorney’s Fees [Docket
No. 50].1
The SPEECH Act creates a possibility of an award of attorney’s fees to the United States
citizen who successfully resists the enforcement of a defamation judgment from another country,
such as the Nova Scotia judgment here; however, the award of attorney’s fees is not automatic.
The SPEECH Act concerning the award of attorney’s fees provides:
The domestic court shall, absent exceptional circumstances,
allow the party opposing recognition or enforcement of the
judgment a reasonable attorney’s fee. (Emphasis added.)
28 U.S.C § 4105.

On December 27, 2012 Mr. Handshoe field his Motion to Require Cost Bond for Appeal Filed by
Plaintiffs [Docket No. 38] which the Court denied on February 25, 2013 [Docket No. 47].

RULE 54.
Mr. Handshoe had fourteen (14) days from the date of the summary judgment’s entry on
December 19, 2012 [Docket No. 36] to move for attorney’s fees, failing in which his claim was
time barred. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)(B)(i). A motion for attorney’s fees “must
be filed within fourteen days after entry of judgment. ….” United Industries, Inc. v. SimonHartley, Ltd., 91 F. 3d 762, 766 (5th Cir. 1996). Mr. Handshoe did not file the motion until
September 10, 2013 [Docket No. 50].
The Rule 54 requirement to move for attorney’s fees within fourteen days of judgment
applies both the application for attorney’s fees at the district court level and for attorney’s fees to
be incurred on appeal. Because Plaintiffs made their request for appellate fees far beyond the
fourteen-day deadline provided by Rule 54(d), Plaintiffs’ request relating to appellate fees is also
untimely and should be denied. See, e.g., Texas Soil Recycling, Inc. v. Intercargo Ins. Co., 73
Fed. Appx. 78, 2003 WL 21756344, at *2 (5th Cir. 2003) (explaining request for appellate fees
was untimely because, inter alia, “[n]o prospective request for such fees was included in
Intercargo’s initial fee motions in the district court”); South Tex. Elec. Coop. v. Dresser-Rand
Co., No. V-06-28, 2010 WL 1855959, at *2 (S.D. Tex. May 5, 2010) (“[T]he fact that a motion
for appellate fees attorneys’ fees is not ripe when it must be raised under Rule 54 does not excuse
a party from failing to comply with required procedures under the Federal Rules.”). The South
Texas Electric Cooperative v. Dresser-Rand Co., Slip Opinion V-06-28 (D.C. Texas May 5,
2010), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit “A”, ultimately found: “The Could holds that
requests for appellate attorneys fees made outside the 14-day window provided for in Rule 54(d)
by a prevailing party in the district court, who also prevails on appeal are untimely.” Id.

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 3 of 13

Mr. Handshoe is therefore precluded from recovering attorney’s fees generated at both
the district court and on appeal since he did not file his motion until September 10, 2013.
Mr. Handshoe quotes Rule 54 in his brief but then ignores the clear requirement that he
had to move for attorney’s fees within fourteen days of entry of summary judgment in his favor.
Instead, he merely claims without citing any authorities that the SPEECH Act entitles him to
attorney’s fees. He cites no authority excusing non-compliance with Rule 54 even though the
SPEECH Act does allow recovery of attorney’s fees in the proper case.
The SPEECH Act does not allow recovery of attorney’s fees if, as Trout Point, Leary and
Perret say here, the case involves “exceptional circumstances”. While the district court entered
summary judgment in favor of Mr. Handshoe, in so doing it recognized the injury he inflicted
upon Trout Point, Leary and Perret.
“Handshoe, apparently in reaction to his blog being taken offline, then began an
internet campaign to damage Perret and Leary.” Summary Judgment Order, pp.
3-4 [Docket No. 35].
“Handshoe has published numerous entries on “Slabbed” about Plaintiffs, many
of which may be characterized as derogatory, mean spirited, sexist and
homophobic.” Summary Judgment Order, p. 4 [Docket No. 35].
“…. Handshoe has made a number of off-color sexual remarks about Vaughan
and Perret, and has published several photo-shopped images of Vaughan and
Perret in an apparent attempt to harass or embarrass them.” Summary Judgment
Order, p. 4, n. 5 [Docket No. 35].

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 4 of 13

“Some of these statements seem to be based in fact; others appears to be
conspiracy theories that may or may not be substantiated.” Summary Judgment
Order, p. 15 [Docket No. 35].
“While many may find Handshoe’s publications may be characterized as
distasteful or offensive, this court cannot enforce an order by a foreign court that
amounts to a prior, and essentially restraint on his speech. Summary Judgment
Order, p. 17 [Docket No. 35].
Likewise, in affirming the district court’s entry of summary judgment for Mr. Handshoe,
the Fifth Circuit found some of Handshoe’s publications as grotesque or offensive. Fifth Circuit
Panel Opinion, p. 19. In oral argument Judge Walker Elrod referred to some of Handshoe's
publications as about

the Plaintiffs

as

“reprehensible

homophobic comments” cf.

http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/OralArgRecordings/13/13-60002_8-06-2013.wma.
Indeed, after reviewing the record de novo, the Court of Appeal affirmed the district
court's fact finding at page 3 of its Opinion:
The district court determined that Handshoe, “apparently in
reaction to his blog being taken offline,” found another web host
for his site and “began an internet campaign to damage Perret and
Leary.” Specifically, Handshoe posted several updates about Trout
Point, Perret, and Leary, which the district court noted “can be
characterized as derogatory, mean spirited, sexist, and
homophobic.”
While this Court and the Fifth Circuit have found Trout Point, Leary and Perret did not
comply with either of the two prongs of the SPEECH Act and are therefore unable to enforce
their Canadian judgment in the United States, both courts found at least some of the Handshoe
publications giving rise to the Canadian defamation judgment to be extremely offensive and
intentionally so, which should be considered as tantamount to being an exceptional circumstance.

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 5 of 13

Both the district court and the Court of Appeal found that this was a case of first
impression, i.e., an exceptional circumstance.
In notes on the legislation, Congress seemed to indicate that it did not anticipate the
SPEECH Act would ever apply to a case of purely private figure libel, not involving matters of
public concern or public officials or figures. Handshoe never proved there was actually a matter
of public concern involved or that the Plaintiffs were “vortex public figures.” The presumption
that this was a case of private figure libel and that the SPEECH Act was invoked by Mr.
Handshoe therefore makes this case exceptional.
The personal plaintiffs are U.S. Citizens who sued in the jurisdiction of their permanent
domicile; they were not the “libel tourists” anticipated by the Act, another exceptional
circumstance.
The Court of Appeals noted that Trout Point did plead the falsity of Handshoe's
publications, however not with the precision required in Mississippi, (cf. Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals Opinion, fn. 4 and 19). The Court also accepted the Plaintiffs' argument that it is not the
general law of the foreign jurisdiction, but rather the law as applied “in that case” that must be
analyzed under the SPEECH Act. supra, cf. Fn 9. This was a rejection of Handshoe's contrary
argument.
Mr. Handshoe made legal arguments at the district court level in his motion for summary
judgment on which he did not prevail. These included attempting to add Slabbed New Media,
LLC as a defendant, arguing against injunctive relief that the Plaintiffs never sought to have
enforced in the United States, arguing about “fighting words” under Mississippi law, arguing that
Mr. Handshoe had protection under the Communications Decency Act, and arguing that
Handshoe should be treated as a news medium.

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 6 of 13

Mr. Handshoe also failed to plead facts in his Notice of Removal sufficient to establish
the diversity required by 28 U.S.C. section 1441 or the minimum diversity required by the
SPEECH Act, something particularly notable since both Perret and Leary are U.S. Citizens
domiciled in Canada and without a domicile in a State.
In addition to filing his motion for over eight months late, in this case of first impression
under the SPEECH Act, Trout Point, Leary and Perret request the Court to consider these facts as
exceptional.
FAILURE TO PROVE REASONABLENESS OF ATTORNEY’S FEES.
The burden is on Mr. Handshoe’s attorney to prove that the number of hours and the
hourly rate for the compensation requested is reasonable. Riley v. City of Jackson, 99 F. 3d 757,
760 (5th Cir. 1996).
Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Kellstrom, 50 F. 3d 319, 325 (5th Cir. 1995) held:
…. the documentation must be sufficient for the court to verify
that the applicant has met its burden. Id. “In determining the
amount of an attorney fee award, courts customarily require the
applicant to produce contemporaneous billing records or other
sufficient documentation so that the district court can fulfill its
duty to examine the application for noncompensable hours.” Id.;
see also Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433, 103 S. Ct. at 1939 (“The party
seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the
hours worked and rates claimed.”). Thus a district court may
reduce the number of hours awarded if the documentation is vague
or incomplete. See Alberti,896 F. 2d at 937 (refusing to accept
incomplete documentation “at face value”); Leroy v. City of
Houston (Leroy I), 831 F. 2d 576, 585-86 (5th Cir. 1987) (finding
clear error and abuse of discretion when district court accept
“faulty records” without making reduction); cf. Hensely, 461 U.S.
at 433, 103 S. Cr. at 1939 (counseling that “[w]here the
documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce
the award accordingly”).

{GP023764.1}

Moreover, in determining the reasonableness of the requested attorney’s fees, the court
employs the “lodestar” method. Nobach v. Woodland Village Nursing Home Center, Inc., 2013
WL 2145728 (S.D. Miss.) citing with approval Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983).
Nobach held:
…. In determining whether a fee award is reasonable, courts
employ the “lodestar” method, which is a two step procedure
delineated by the United States Supreme Court in Hensley v.
Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983).
The lodestar is
presumptively reasonable ….
The first step of this method requires the Court to calculate the
“lodestar” which is equal to the number of hours reasonably
expended on the litigation multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate
for the participating lawyers. ….
…. The Supreme Court has explained that:
[c]ases may be overstaffed, and the skill and experience of
lawyers vary widely. Counsel for the prevailing party should
make a good faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours
that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just
as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to
exclude such hours from his fee submission.
Id., at 434.
Once the lodestar figure is determined, the Court can accept it or
adjust it upwards or downwards based upon the twelve factors
announced in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.
2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974). The Johnson factors are: (1) the
time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions; (3) the requisite to perform the legal service properly;
(4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to the
acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee
is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or
circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained;
(9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the
“undesirability” of the case; (11) the nature and length of the
professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in
similar cases. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 430 n. 3 (1983)(citing Johnson,
488 F. 2d at 717-19). ….

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 8 of 13

Here, Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating the
reasonableness of the amount of her attorneys’ fees, including any
adjustments or enhancements. Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886,
901-02 (1984). To obtain an enhancement, Plaintiff must produce
“specific evidence” which supports the award. Perdue, 130 S.Ct.
1673. “The lodestar may not be adjusted due to a Johnson factor,
however, if the creation of the lodestar amount already took that
factor into account; to do so would be impermissible double
counting.” Saizan v. Delta Concrete Prods. Co., 448 F. 3d 795,
800 (5th Circ. 2006). ….
“Reasonable hourly rates are determined by looking to the
prevailing market rates in the relevant legal community.” …. The
relevant legal community is the community in which the district
court sits. …. The burden of demonstrating the hourly rate lies
with the party seeking attorneys’ fees. …. “Generally the
reasonable hourly rate for a particular community is established
through affidavits of other attorneys practicing there.” 2 ….

“Reasonable hourly rates are determined by looking to the prevailing market rates in the
relevant legal community”. Id.
“The relevant legal community is the community in which the district court sits.” Id.
“The burden of demonstrating the hourly rate lies with the party seeking attorneys’ fees.
Id.
“Generally the reasonable hourly rate for a particular community is established through
affidavits of other attorneys practicing there.” Id.
MR. TRUITT’S BILLING INCLUDES TIME FOR UNNECESSARY
WORK. HIS BILLING IS INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE.
There are obvious errors in the dates on which certain events occurred that cast doubt on
whether the billing represents data taken from contemporaneous time records. There is also the
fact that Mr. Handshoe has presented one single invoice dated September 10, 2013, covering the

2

Trout Point, Leary and Perret concede affidavits are recommended and not required, but Mr.
Handshoe made no attempt to prove any of the Johnson factors other than to submit a billing.

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 9 of 13

entire period from March, 2012 to nearly the present day. There are no copies of monthly billing
statements, for example.
In his motion for an appeal bond, counsel for Mr. Handshoe unequivocally represented to
the Court that as of the end of the district court proceeding, Handshoe had incurred $50,000 in
attorney’s fees. Upon examining the September 10, 2013, billing, however, the fees accrued to
December 19, 2012, were about $39,050.00. This is a substantial difference, and the disparity
between current representations and those made in December, 2012, are significant and
unexplained.
As stated, the Court entered summary judgment for Mr. Handshoe on December 19,
2012, and yet Mr. Truitt has billed on page 8 of the invoice for reviewing and analyzing the
Court's judgment on December 18, 2012, one day too early. Mr. Truitt also bills for sending
correspondence to his client about the decision and for reviewing correspondence received from
his client all on the same day, December 18, 2012.
On page 1 of the invoice, Mr. Truitt starts billing on March 2, 2012: “initial meeting to
discuss case.” He then bills on March 8 for reviewing “various pleadings filed” and
communication with his client about “the case.” Yet the Defendant's Notice of Removal, which
bears Mr. Truitt's name alongside that of Handshoe's Mississippi counsel, states that Handshoe
was served with notice of the enrollment of the Plaintiffs' foreign money judgment on March 9,
2013, and that the enrollment itself only took place on March 8, 2013.
Mr. Truitt cannot bill for time spent on Handshoe's pro se declaratory judgment action,
which was dismissed by consent.
On April 6, 2012, Mr. Truitt bills for researching “consolidation of both Federal Court
actions.”

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 10 of 13

On April 18, 2012, Mr. Truitt bills for travel to New Orleans. Neither Mr. Truitt nor his
client reside in New Orleans. Plaintiffs should not bear responsibility for Handshoe's choice of
out-of-state counsel or for a trip to New Orleans.
On May 22, 2012 Truitt bills for research on “Mississippi defamation law.” The Plaintiffs
should not bear the burden for Mr. Truitt's unfamiliarity with Mississippi law, particularly as
Handshoe had other Mississippi counsel enrolled.
On May 23, 2012 Mr. Truitt bills for “review of the Slabbed blog.” The Plaintiffs should
not bear this cost.
Mr. Truitt's May 24, 2012 billing of 6 hours for research including “burden of proof in a
defamation case” appears unreasonable, particularly, again, if it stems from his unfamiliarity
with Mississippi law.
On May 25, 2012 Mr. Truitt bills for research into legal issues never raised by the
Plaintiffs including injunctive relief and “prior restraint.” Plaintiffs never sought to enforce their
Nova Scotia injunction or to give effect to any prior restraint.
On May 29, 2012 Mr. Truitt likewise bills for research into “fighting words,” something
never at issue in this case.
On June 28, 2012, Mr. Truitt bills for communicating with the Clerk of Court about
“error messages” and proper filing procedure.
On August 2, 2012, Mr. Truitt again bills for meeting with his client in New Orleans,
including travel time.
In November, 2012, Mr. Truitt bills extensively for the court-mandated settlement
conference, in which the Plaintiffs made a good faith settlement offer. Handshoe broke the
confidentiality of the settlement conference by publishing about it on Slabbed.

{GP023764.1}

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 52 Filed 09/25/13 Page 11 of 13

On November 5, 2012, Mr. Truitt bills for drafting an offer of amicable settlement.
counsel cannot recall such an offer.
On December 3, 2012, Mr. Truitt bills for consulting with his client about “new lawsuit
filed.” This is irrelevant to the instant proceeding.
On December 27, 2012, and the days following, as well as on January 25, 2013, Mr.
Truitt bills for time spent working on applying for an appeal bond. Defendant's motion for an
appeal bond was denied, and Plaintiffs should not have to pay for his work on this issue.
On February 13, 2013, Mr. Truitt bills for communicating in house about, and
researching the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
On February 25 and March 22, 2013, Mr. Truitt again bills for researching procedural
issues.
Finally, Mr. Truitt bills, in general and on numerous occasions, for updating his client on
the status of the case. While it may be reasonable to bill for meeting with his client to learn
relevant information or discuss strategy, billing for mere status updates or to communicate the
existence of court orders or decisions is not reasonable.
CONCLUSION
Trout Point, Leary and Perret request the Court to deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees since it is untimely filed pursuant to Rule 54, the billing is unproved and/or undocumented
and in large degree unreasonable, and if the Court considers the facts of this case exceptional, the
SPEECH Act disallows the fees.
