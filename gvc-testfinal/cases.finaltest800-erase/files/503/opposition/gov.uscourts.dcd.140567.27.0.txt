Civil Action No.: 10-0151 (RCL)

DEFENDANT’S COMBINED OPPOSITION TO (1) PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION AND LEAVE TO FILE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT,
AND (2) MOVANT STRUNK’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

Defendant, Barack H. Obama, respectfully opposes both (1) Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration and for leave to file a second amended complaint (R.25), and (2) Movant
Strunk’s motion for reconsideration (R.26). Plaintiff claims in this case that President Obama
committed fraud regarding his qualification for office as a “natural born citizen.” This Court
recently dismissed the action for lack of constitutional standing. (R.22 & R.23.) For the most
part, Plaintiff’s instant motion rehashes the same allegations the Court has already rejected and
reconsideration of these issues is unwarranted. The only thing new in her motion is her request
to add two additional plaintiffs, but this neither provides a basis for reconsideration, nor
illustrates any need to retain this particular civil action to prosecute any interests those two
persons may seek to vindicate. Strunk’s motion similarly raises no points that justify
reconsideration.

Legal Standard for Reconsideration
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a party to move to alter or amend a court’s
judgment within 28 days of entry of such judgment, per Rule 59(e), or to seek relief from a final
judgment for certain specified grounds, per Rule 60(b). In light of those Rules’ respective
deadlines, “[t]he general rule is that a motion for reconsideration is treated as a F.R.C.P. 59(e)
motion if filed within [28] days of entry of the challenged order and as a Rule 60(b) motion if
filed thereafter.” Ellipso, Inc. v. Mann, 583 F. Supp. 2d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2008). Plaintiff’s motion,
filed thirteen calendar days after entry of judgment, should be treated as a motion under Rule
59(e), consistent with the recent (nonsubstantive) change in the deadline in Rule 59 from 10
business days to 28 calendar days.
Rule 59(e) does not permit simply re-arguing the same points raised prior to entry of
judgment, but sanctions reconsideration only in limited circumstances:
Whether or not to grant a Rule 59(e) motion is discretionary, but a motion need not be
granted unless the district court finds that there is an intervening change of controlling
law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent
manifest injustice. Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir.1996) (per
curiam).
Ellipso, Inc. v. Mann, 253 F.R.D. 1 (D.D.C. 2008).
Argument
Plaintiff’s motion points to no intervening change in authority, either statutory, case law
or otherwise, nor points to new factual allegations or evidence. Instead, she first repeats in
summary fashion the same arguments she raised before regarding her allegations of fraud in
social security numbers, her qui tam and FOIA claims, and her claims for common law fraud,
sections 1984 and 1985, RICO, and the Commerce Clause. (R.25.) None of this shows clear

error of law or a manifest injustice in the dismissal and therefore, none justify reconsideration.
The only new wrinkle Plaintiff adds is the request to add two new plaintiffs. Her
explanation for this is brief:
As an attorney for plaintiffs, Keyes, Lightfoot and others, Taitz has submitted Quo
Warranto requests to the Attorney General and US Attorney, who have not responded.
Therefore, Taitz is asking for leave of the Court to proceed under Quo Warranto, and in
case your Honor does not grant Quo Warranto to the Plaintiff, she moves for Leave of
Court to file a Second Amended Complaint with two additional plaintiffs: Presidential
candidate from American Independent Party in 2008 election Ambassador Dr. Alan
Keyes, as well as Gail Lightfoot, a Vice Presidential candidate for a write in Presidential
Candidate Ron Paul.
(R.25 at 5.) Plaintiff has not submitted a proposed Second Amended Complaint, so it is not clear
what factual allegations, if any, she proposes to make on their behalf. Nor is there any
explanation for why these potential plaintiffs would be better off continuing this civil action
instead of filing their own separate civil action. Nor has Plaintiff filed an entry of appearance on
their behalf.
In any event, Plaintiff’s request to amend her complaint a second time may not be
considered unless she first succeeds in persuading the Court to alter or amend its judgment
dismissing her case outright. See, e.g., Johnson v. District of Columbia, 244 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D.D.C.
2007). Her request to add new plaintiffs, therefore, is not a proper basis for reconsideration after
entry of judgment dismissing the case. Accordingly, the Court should deny both her requests for
reconsideration and for leave to amend her complaint a second time.
Moreover, even if the Court were to consider her request to amend, the request should be
denied as futile, per Johnson, 244 F.R.D. at 7. First, she has done nothing to challenge the
application of the political question doctrine, as argued in Defendant’s motion to dismiss (R.18 at

13-17), which provides that the question of the eligibility of a particular candidate for office is an
issue for the political process in the first instance, and this applies equally to anyone challenging
the outcome of the election. See also Barnett v. Obama, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2009 WL 3861788
*16 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2009) (applying political question doctrine in declining to hear claims on
behalf of Keyes and Lightfoot).
Similarly, Movant Strunk’s motion fails to describe any “intervening change of
controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent
manifest injustice,” but alleges only that he was not given the opportunity to file a reply in
support of his motion to intervene. (R.26 at 2 of 6, per ECF pagination.) He appears to request
until June 17, 2010, to do so. (Id. at 2 of 6 and 4 of 6.) Strunk, however, refuses to explain why
he needs that long, saying only that he is “unable to discuss [it] until say June 17, 2010,”
apparently referring to his reasons for requesting the extra time and, perhaps also, his substantive
arguments as to denial of intervention.
Strunk’s request suffers an analogous problem as Plaintiff’s motion in that the first step
must be success in obtaining reconsideration of the dismissal order prior to there being any case
in which he could intervene. In the absence of any explanation why dismissal should be
reconsidered, or even any plausible explanation for why the parties and the Court should wait
nearly two months for such an explanation, the Court should deny Strunk’s request as well.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant asks the Court to deny Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration and leave to file a second amended complaint (R.25), as well as Strunk’s motion
for reconsideration (R.26).
