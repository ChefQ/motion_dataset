STRUNK'S DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
OF THE JUDGMENT TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT
AS TO DEFENDANT(S)
I, Christopher-Earl Strunk in esse declare under penalty of perjury with 28 USC 0x00A71746:

1 This is Strunk's declaration in support of the Motion for reconsideration of the Judgment
to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint as to Defendant(s) with the Memorandum / Order and
Judgment entered April 14, 2010.

2. That the DOJ stipulated with Declarant for an extension of time to respond in opposition
to the motion to intervene, and that when Declarant replied the Clerk of the Court voided the
document and returned it, see the cover page in which the clerk stamped void (see_Exhibit)

3. That Declarant appreciates the thoughtful opinion of the Court however asserts such
analysis as applies is conformed to by Declarant who was not given a chance to reply; and for

reasons Declarant is unable to discuss until say June 17, 2010, and requests an extension of time

to file a reply to the motion to dismiss as to the intervention of otherwise strike the portion of the
Case 1:10-cv-00151-RCL Document 26 Filed 04/27/10 Page 3 of 6

Judgment that references Declarant.

4. As for the Court's use of the adjective quixotic behavior that is noble in an absurd way or
the desire to perform acts of chivalry in a radically impractical manner, neither Plaintiff nor
Declarant believes that fighting to save the sovereignty of the nation under our great constitution
is either absurd or impractical. It should be noted that Cervantes had enlisted as a soldier in a
regiment of the Spanish naval elite corps, Infanteria de Marina, stationed in Naples, then a
possession of the Spanish crown. He was there for about a year before he saw active service.

5. That the Don Quixote story is more than mere reference by Cervantes to himself in his
own military exploits, in fact were informed by the heroic exploits of the Jesuit Basque Ignatius
Loyola whose distinguished service in both the Spanish Court and to the Jesuit company of the
Pope's militia was really the model for Don Ourxote in considering the Jesuit contemporary of
Cervantes as a devout Catholic.

6. Perhaps metaphorically quixotic may be a true expression of any federal court action
today that attempts to defend the chimera of the U.S. Constitution as the Court suggests, for the
Jesuits like Cervantes would revile the premise of the underlying protection of the individual
granted in the U.S. Constitution, which are the principles Plaintiff and Declarant fight for.

7. That the term quixotic special meaning that does not apply to Declarant as to that militia
the Jesuits and their collective whom I fight openly without dicing words

8. That chivalry is not gone as the Court suggests; and to the contrary exists in just the same
way as when Barry Goldwater declared in the 1964 convention "/:xtremism in the defense of
liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice 1s no
virtue." he was merely quoting Cicero two millenniums thereafter, just like JFK had rhetorically

stated "Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country" came
Case 1:10-cv-00151-RCL Document 26 Filed 04/27/10 Page 4 of 6

from a Warren Harding convention speech too flowed from early history

Wherefore, Declarant urges the Court to reconsider what we endeavor to do as worthy of the
Court's grant of relief as in keeping with the Court's oath of allegiance, and that Declarant's
intervention without substantive due process be stricken from the judgment as premature until
say June 17, 2010 when I am obliged to speak freely; and that Declarant requests other and

different relief that the Court may deem necessary.
