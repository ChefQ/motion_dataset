Plaintiff AdvanceMe, Inc. (""AdvanceMe") hereby opposes AmeriMerchant, LLC's
("AmeriMerchant") Motion for Leave to Amend its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions and, in
support thereof, would respectfully show the Court as follows:

I, PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

AmeriMerchant's motion should be denied. AmeriMerchant is seeking to significantly
revamp its invalidity contentions, even though AmeriMerchant was fully aware of the
information it now seeks to add at the time it served its original Preliminary Invalidity
Contentions. There is simply no excuse for AmeriMerchant to have waited several months to
add this information. Since AmeriMerchant filed its original Preliminary Invalidity Contentions,
the parties have conducted extensive discovery, traveled across the country to take depositions,
and prepared for mediation and claim construction. AmeriMerchant's lack of diligence compels
the denial of this motion.

AmeriMerchant's motion also suffers from another fatal flaw - AmeriMerchant has
failed to submit the content of the proposed amendments to the Court. AdvanceMe is at a loss as
to how this Court can adequately evaluate a motion for leave to amend, when the proposed
amendments have not even been disclosed. It is AmeriMerchant's burden to disclose its
proposed amendments to the Court and explain why it has acted diligently with respect to each
amendment. AmeriMerchant has not even attempted to carry this burden.

AmeriMerchant acts like its invalidity contentions are something that can be changed at
its whim and be regularly "updated" whenever it takes a deposition or conducts further analysis
of a prior art reference. This approach is simply not permitted by this Court's Patent Rules.
Under the Patent Rules, a "shifting sands" approach to invalidity contentions is impermissible;

rather, AmeriMerchant was required to provide complete contentions early in the case so that the

CONTENTIONS

~ Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL Document50_ Filed 09/25/2006 Page 5 of 17

parties could conduct discovery thereon. Yet, not only has AmeriMerchant brought the instant
motion to add information it has known for months, it has also threatened to bring another
motion to further amend its invalidity contentions after the instant one is decided!

AdvanceMe needs finality in this process. Under the Patent Rules, AdvanceMe was
entitled to know on July 20, 2006 the entire scope of AmeriMerchant's invalidity contentions.
Yet, several months later, AmeriMerchant is still attempting to rewrite large portions of its
contentions. At some point, enough must be enough. Accordingly, to the extent that
AmeriMerchant is permitted any amendment of its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions pursuant
to this motion, this should be the /ast amendment permitted to AmeriMerchant in this case.

il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. Defendants Submit Preliminary Invalidity Contentions That Vaguely
Describe the Litle Prior Art.

On February 27, 2006, AdvanceMe filed its complaint for patent infringement against
AmeriMerchant. Docket Entry ("D.E.") 1. After the filing of the complaint, AmeriMerchant
immediately conducted efforts to locate relevant prior art. Indeed, the documentation submitted
by AmeriMerchant on this motion indicates that its search began at least as early as March 3,
2006, six days after the Complaint was filed. Gray Declaration, Exh. B (facsimile dated March
3, 2006 concerning alleged prior art, which was re-faxed in June). Under the Court's Docket
Control Order, AmeriMerchant had several months - until July of 2006 ~ to disclose its
Preliminary Invalidity Contentions.

At least as early as April of 2006, AmeriMerchant began communications with an
individual named Tim Litle, concerning an alleged prior art process by a company called Litle &
Co, that involved postage financing. On April 26, contact information was exchanged between

Mr. Litle and Mr. Goldin, the CEO of AmeriMerchant. Declaration of Michael Edelman

2.
Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL Document50_ Filed 09/25/2006 Page 6 of 17

("Edelman Decl."), Exh. A. On April 27, Mr, Goldin forwarded an article from Forbes magazine
he had located concerning a customer of Litle & Co, called Exposures, which allegedly
references the postage financing program. Id., Exh. B.

On June 19, 2006, almost a month before the deadline for Preliminary Invalidity
Contentions, Mr. Goldin was forwarded further documentation relating to the Litle postage
financing system, including a Promissory Note for Postage Advances, a Security Agreement, a
Demand Promissory Note for Postage Advances, and a Subordination Agreement, Edelman
Decl., Exh. C. This documentation was apparently forwarded by Paymentech, the company that
had acquired Litle & Co. in 1995,

On June 20, 2006, Mr. Goldin contacted Mr. Litle and attached a "copy of the
schedule/security agreement of the postage financing agreement w/ Exposures." Edelman Decl.,
Exh. D. The email further stated that "[t]he patent attorneys think it's enough to "start" and we
may ask for testimony from you, etc. that further details how the program worked if needed."
id. As this email indicates, one month before the July 20, 2006 deadline for AmeriMerchant to
submit its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions, it had already received information about the Litle
program, and its "patent attorneys" had already analyzed the documents and considered asking
for testimony from Mr. Litle about them.

On June 27, 2006, discussions with Mr. Litle continued concerning the alleged prior art.
On that date, Mr. Litle informed Mr. Goldin of yet more details concerning this alleged prior art.
Edelman Decl., Exh. E. Mr, Goldin responded that Mr. Litle's testimony will help "put the
pieces of the puzzle together," and further talked about the need to do "automatic disclosures"

for the Court. Id. The email further stated that "[t]he patent attorney's know about your
Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL Document 50 - Filed 09/25/2006 Page 7 of 17

willingness to testify and I will keep you posted well ahead in advance of the progress of what's
going on." Id.

As the above indicates, long before the time that AmeriMerchant was required to serve its
Preliminary Invalidity Contentions on July 20, 2006, it had received extensive information about
the alleged Litle prior art. AmeriMerchant had received documents about this alleged prior art,
reviewed those documents, communicated with Mr. Litle about the documents, and specifically
discussed with Mr. Litle the fact that this alleged prior art might be disclosed. Accordingly,
AmeriMerchant had the ability to provide contentions which contained its complete positions
concerning the alleged Litle prior art.

On July 20, 2006, AmeriMerchant served its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions.
Edelman Decl., Exh. G, Even though AmeriMerchant had spent weeks communicating with Mr.
Litle, the disclosures about the Litle prior art were vague and conclusory. Id. at Ex. 6.

B. After Extensive Discovery Is Underway, AmeriMerchant Suddenly Purports
to Serve A Set of "Amended" Contentions.

In July and August of 2006, the parties conducted extensive discovery to prepare for trial
in this case. For instance, AmeriMerchant noticed the deposition of named inventor Barbara
Johnson in New York, and therefore AdvanceMe was forced to incur substantial costs and
. expenses to defend that deposition. The parties also propounded extensive document requests,
engaged in a huge amount of meet and confer, propounded interrogatories, and engaged in meet
and confer over claim construction. Throughout this entire process, AmeriMerchant never once
brought a motion for leave to amend its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions.

On August 30, 2006, AmeriMerchant purported to serve a set of "amended" invalidity
contention. Edelman Decl., Exh. Q. However, AmeriMerchant did not bring a motion to amend

its invalidity contentions as required by Court order, and therefore these purported amendments

4a
Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL Document 50 _ Filed 09/25/2006 Page 8 of 17.

were without any force or effect. Further, the attempted "amendments" in these set of conditions
were very extensive. In essence, these amendments attempted to completely rewrite
the disclosures concerning the alleged Litle prior art. Id., Exh. M.

Clearly, the further attempt by AmeriMerchant to "amend" its contentions without leave
of court threatened to throw the discovery process into chaos. Indeed, between the time that the
_ Preliminary Invalidity Contentions and the "Amended" contentions were served, the parties had
engaged in even more discovery and trial preparation, and AdvanceMe had heavily relied upon
the Preliminary Invalidity Contentions to prepare its case. Accordingly, AdvanceMe was left
with no choice but to inform AmeriMerchant that its "amendments" were unauthorized and
impermissible. Edelman Decl., Exh. N.

Cc, AdvaneeMe Informs AmeriMerchant That lis Amendments Are
Unauthorized.

On September 1, 2006, AdvanceMe sent a letter to AmeriMerchant informing it that its
attempted "amendments" were impermissible and unauthorized. Edelman Decl., Exh. N.
AdvanceMe assumed that would be the end of the matter.

However, a few days later, the parties attended the deposition of Mr. Litle in Lowell,
Massachusetts. During a break in this deposition, AmeriMerchant's counsel suddenly raised, for.
the very first time, the prospect that it would file a motion for leave to amend its Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions to add the new information in its "Amended" contentions. Edelman
Decl., (17. AdvanceMe responded that it had very good arguments as to why none of those
amendments would be permitted. Id. AdvanceMe further indicated that, if it was to consider
agreeing to any of these amendments, it could not do so unless it received a stipulation that the

attempts by AmeriMerchant to amend its contentions would be at an end. Id.
Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL Document 50 Filed 09/25/2006 Page 9of 17

AmeriMerchant's response to this point was to reveal that it anticipated bringing a second
motion to amend their invalidity contentions at some undetermined future date, based on
information it may learn in the Litle deposition. Edelman Decl., 417. In other words, even
if AdvanceMe decided to overlook AmeriMerchant's previous violation of the Court rules and
agree that the "Amended" contentions were permissible, AmeriMerchant would still be filing
another motion for leave to amend their invalidity contentions, containing even more proposed
amendments.

During the deposition of Mr. Litle, AmeriMerchant's counsel introduced as an exhibit a
chart relating to their "new" contentions concerning the Litle prior art - even though those
contentions had never been approved by the Court and had only recently been served by the
Defendants. Edelman Decl., Exh. P. AmeriMerchant then proceeded to ask a series of questions
of Mr. Litle concerning these "amended" contentions. Id., 418. This placed AdvanceMe in an
impossible situation. Since AdvanceMe had just received the contentions and they were not yet
even part of the case, AdvanceMe had not even received the opportunity to conduct investigation
on the unauthorized "amendments," and therefore could not conduct its own questioning of Mr.
Litle on these new contentions.

D. AdvanceMe's Efforts to Finally Cease AmeriMerchant's "Shifting Sands"
Approach to its Invalidity Contentions Is Unsuccessful.

After the Litle deposition, the parties met and conferred further on the prospect of a
motion to amend the Defendants' Preliminary Invalidity Contentions. During the meet and
confer, AdvanceMe continued to make clear that it believed any such motion would be
unsuccessful. Edelman Decl., 19. However, AdvanceMe also explored the possibility of
stipulating to one or more of the AmeriMerchant's unauthorized amendments, if it would mean

that AmeriMerchant's attempt to "amend" its contentions would finally come to an end. Id.

-6-
Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL Document50_ Filed 09/25/2006 Page 10of17

AmeriMerchant refused, however, to agree to this condition. Id. Indeed, AmeriMerchant again
repeated that, even if the upcoming motion to amend was granted, it intended to bring yet
another motion to amend in the future. Id. In response, AdvanceMe's counsel suggested that, at
minimum, AmeriMerchant should just place all its sought-after amendments in a single
document, rather than burdening the parties with multiple motions. Id. AmeriMerchant refused
to agree to this suggestion, and instead stated that it was not yet "ready" to make a decision as to
whether to file another motion for leave. Id.

On September 13, 2006, AmeriMerchant filed the instant motion. D.E. 42. In the
motion, AmeriMerchant failed to submit any of its proposed amendments to the Court, nor did it
submit a redlined version showing the changes it proposed to make from the Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions. Id. Nor did AmeriMerchant mention that it had threatened to file
another motion for leave to amend, even if the Court was to grant this one. Id. Shortly after the
instant motion was filed, AmeriMerchant sent a letter to AdvanceMe saying that it had decided
to add yet more amendments, and asked AdvanceMe to stipulate to a brand-new set of amended
contentions. Edelman Decl., Exh. O.

TI. ARGUMENT.
A. Standards Governing This Motion.

A party seeking to amend its patent contentions must show "good cause," 1.e., the same
partly & Pp g

standard that applies to amend a court's scheduling order. FRCP 16(b); STMicroelectronics, Inc.

 

v. Motorola, Inc., 307 F.Supp.2d 845, 849 (E.D. Tex. 2004) This good cause standard "requires

 

the party seeking relief to show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence
of the party needing the extension." Id. at 850, quoting S & W Enters., L.L.C. v. Southtrust

Bank of Alabama, NA, 315 F.3d 533, 535 (Sth Cir. 2003) (emphasis added). Further, a party
