CAUSE NO. 6:06-CV-0082 LED
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

DEFENDANT AMERIMERCHANT, LLC’S REPLY
IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND
PRELIMINARY INVALIDITY CONTENTIONS
Defendant AmeriMerchant, LLC (“AmeriMerchant”) hereby files its Reply in
Support of its Motion for Leave to Amend Preliminary Invalidity Contentions and, in
support hereof, would respectfully show the Court as follows:
I.
BACKGROUND
As described in AmeriMerchant’s Motion for Leave to Amend Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions (“Motion”), AmeriMerchant has gone to great lengths to diligently
pursue and collect any documentary evidence supporting invalidating prior art in this
matter, including undertaking the daunting task of convincing its direct competitors to
search for documents over a decade old.

See Timeline of Facts Relevant to

AmeriMerchant’s Motion to Amend Invalidity Contentions (“Timeline”), attached hereto
as Ex. F; Motion at 2-4. As soon as these documents were located and provided to
AmeriMerchant, AmeriMerchant has both (a) promptly provided the documents to
Plaintiff AdvanceMe, Inc. (“AdvanceMe”), and (b) promptly incorporated the documents
into, and served on AdvanceMe, invalidity charts identifying where each element of each

claim may be found in the produced documents. Id. Upon being told by AdvanceMe that
it would object to the updated invalidity contentions, AmeriMerchant realized it had
omitted to obtain leave and immediately filed its motion for leave to amend.
Rather than explain how AmeriMerchant could have possibly been more diligent
in its effort to discover and disclose the Litle & Company prior art systems and
supporting documentation, AdvanceMe, in its Opposition to AmeriMerchant, LLC’s
Motion for Leave to Amend Invalidity Contentions (“Opposition”), disregards the
documented timeline of relevant facts set forth in AmeriMerchant’s Motion and instead
responds with assertions regarding when it thinks AmeriMerchant may have gained
knowledge of the Litle & Company prior art. Further, AdvanceMe makes specious
claims of hypothetical prejudice, all of which are either wholly unsupported or
inapplicable to the instant case, as described herein.
Having shown good cause for its proposed amendment of its Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions (“Original Contentions”), AmeriMerchant respectfully requests
that the Court grant its Motion. As explained in its Motion, AmeriMerchant seeks leave
to amend its Original Contentions to include facts contained in documents received after
the scheduling order deadline for submitting its Original Contentions.

See Ex. G,

Comparison of Proposed Amendment to Original Contentions. As illustrated in Ex. G,
the only supplementation to AmeriMerchant’s invalidity contentions related to Litle &
Company are those facts contained in documents obtained by AmeriMerchant after the
scheduling order deadline for AmeriMerchant’s Original Contentions.

II.
ARGUMENT
A.

AmeriMerchant Has Shown Good Cause for the Proposed Amendment
As the parties agree, the Court may grant AmeriMerchant’s Motion if

AmeriMerchant

shows

good

cause

for

the

proposed

amendment.

See

STMicroelectronics, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 2d 845, 849 (E.D. Tex. 2004)
(Davis, J.); Opposition at 7.

Four considerations are relevant to the Court’s

determination: (1) AmeriMerchant’s reasons for not including the proposed amendment
by the scheduling order deadline; (2) the importance of the additional documentary
support for the Litle & Company prior art systems; (3) potential prejudice in allowing the
additional documentary support for the Litle & Company prior art systems; and (4) the
availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice. See Alt v. Medtronic, 2006 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 4435 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 1, 2006) (Davis, J.). As explained in its Motion and
below, each of these four factors weighs strongly in favor of permitting AmeriMerchant’s
requested amendment. AdvanceMe’s only arguments in opposition are either contrary to
the documented facts or unsupported assertions of prejudice.
1.

AmeriMerchant Received the Documents Upon Which its Proposed
Amendment is Based After its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions
Were Due

As demonstrated in the Motion and reiterated herein, the first factor – the
explanation for the delay – weighs heavily in favor of granting AmeriMerchant’s
proposed amendment. AmeriMerchant did not receive the documents upon which its
proposed amendment is based until July 25, 2006 (after the July 20, 2006 deadline for

3

Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL

Document 58

Page 4 of 13

serving its Original Contentions).1 See Motion at 2-4; Ex. F. This documented timeline
demonstrates that AmeriMerchant could not have reasonably met the scheduling order
deadline for the additional Litle & Company documentary support, despite its diligence.
AdvanceMe’s Opposition does nothing to undercut that demonstration.

Instead, it

responds by making bald and unsupported assertions about AmeriMerchant’s knowledge,
all of which are contradicted by the objective facts.
AdvanceMe argues that AmeriMerchant received “the Litle documents” in June,
Opposition at 8, although fails to recognize that the only Litle documents received in June
were fragments of a single postage advance agreement.

See Ex. F; Ex. B to the

Declaration of Joseph Gray in Support of Defendant’s Motion (“Gray Declaration”). At
that time, AmeriMerchant had not obtained enough information about Litle & Company
(which was sold in 1995) to determine whether and to what extent Litle & Company
practiced the claimed invention in the early 1990s. It was not until AmeriMerchant
received additional information and additional documentation on July 14, 2006 that
AmeriMerchant was able to assert in good faith that Litle & Company publicly and
commercially practiced U.S. Patent No. 6,942,281’s (the “281 Patent”) claimed
invention. See Ex. F; Ex. C to Gray Declaration. Six days later, on the July 20, 2006
scheduled date, AmeriMerchant served its Original Contentions, which included the Litle
& Company prior art systems and citations to the relevant documents that
AmeriMerchant had received as of that date. See Ex. F.

1

As explained in AmeriMerchant’s Motion at 7, AmeriMerchant’s proposed amendment includes
only additional information regarding the Litle & Company prior art systems contained in these laterobtained documents. See Ex. G; Ex. C to Gray Declaration. Also as explained in AmeriMerchant’s
Motion, the proposed amendment further supplements the disclosures regarding Litle & Company made in
AmeriMerchant’s Original Contentions served July 20, 2006.

4

Page 5 of 13

AdvanceMe also states that AmeriMerchant “had full access to Mr. Litle in June.”
Opposition at 8. However, AdvanceMe fails to offer any basis for this statement, fails to
recognize that any relevant documents are in the possession of Paymentech (a multibillion dollar processing company and competitor of AmeriMerchant, which evolved
from First USA years after First USA bought Litle & Co. in 1995), and fails to recognize
that Mr. Litle is the CEO of a large processing company (also AmeriMerchant’s
competitor) and has no immediate interest in the outcome of this litigation. See id.; Ex.
H. AmeriMerchant has painstakingly gained only limited access to Mr. Litle and has had
an extremely difficult time convincing Paymentech to search for decade-old documents
and provide them to AmeriMerchant.
AmeriMerchant has exerted incredible effort in its search for documentation
regarding the Litle & Company prior art and has provided to AdvanceMe all relevant
information it has obtained every step of the way.2 See Ex. F; Motion at 2-4. Indeed,
AmeriMerchant now seeks to supplement its contentions about the Litle & Co. prior art,
to include documentary evidence that it received July 25, 2006 and that it promptly
produced to AdvanceMe on July 28, 2006.

AdvanceMe’s statement that

“AmeriMerchant was fully aware of the information it now seeks to add at the time it
served its original Preliminary Invalidity Contentions,” Opposition at 1, is simply
inaccurate, as it is directly contradicted by AmeriMerchant’s documented correspondence
with Tim Litle and Paymentech.

2

AmeriMerchant brought this motion as soon as it was brought to AmeriMerchant’s attention that
it had failed to file a motion for leave to amend its Original Contentions. See Ex. I (Letter from Robert
Matz to Hilary Preston dated September 1, 2006). AdvanceMe’s attempt to attribute a lack of good faith or
gamesmanship to the delay in bringing the motion is thus misplaced. AmeriMerchant has promptly
provided all relevant information to AdvanceMe as it has become available to AmeriMerchant, as described
in its Motion and herein.

The Litle & Company Prior Art Systems Anticipate All Relevant
Claims of the ‘281 Patent

As explained in AmeriMerchant’s Motion, the documents obtained by
AmeriMerchant, and the accompanying analysis in AmeriMerchant’s proposed
amendment, are critically important to AmeriMerchant’s defense of AdvanceMe’s
claims, as they further demonstrate invalidity of all relevant asserted claims. See Motion
at 7; Ex. G. AdvanceMe, in its Opposition, does not explain any basis for contending that
Litle & Company does not constitute invalidating prior art, but rather states that
AmeriMerchant “relies only on lawyer’s argument.”

Opposition at 10.

But

AmeriMerchant does no such thing. The detailed facts demonstrating how Litle &
Company’s systems anticipated the relevant asserted claims are found in the July 20,
2006 Invalidity Contentions, and are further supported in the Litle & Company
documents (produced to AdvanceMe on or before July 28, 2006) and in
AmeriMerchant’s Amended Preliminary Invalidity Contentions (served August 30,
2006).
AdvanceMe fails to mention that Mr. Litle testified at his deposition on
September 6, 2006, that AmeriMerchant’s proposed Amended Invalidity Contentions
accurately describe the manner in which the Litle & Company systems anticipate all
relevant claims of the patent-in-suit. See Ex. J, Tim Litle Deposition Transcript at 123158. AdvanceMe also fails to mention that it cross-examined Mr. Litle for about three
hours and was unable to raise even one single basis for contending that any relevant
asserted claims could somehow avoid anticipation by the Litle & Co. systems. As this
Court has agreed that an amendment to include invalidating prior art weighs in favor of

6

Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL

Document 58

Filed 10/03/2006

Page 7 of 13

permitting the amendment, AmeriMerchant has satisfied this second prong of the
analysis.3 See Alt, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4435, *12-13.
3.

AdvanceMe Will Suffer No Relevant Prejudice if the Court Permits
the Amendment

As explained in AmeriMerchant’s Motion and confirmed by AdvanceMe’s
Opposition, AdvanceMe will suffer no relevant prejudice if the Court permits the
proposed amendment. AmeriMerchant included the initial framework for the Litle &
Company prior art in its Original Contentions, which were served on AdvanceMe on July
20, 2006. See Ex. F. AdvanceMe was thus on notice of this prior art system by the
scheduling order deadline.

On July 28, 2006, eight days after serving its Original

Contentions, AmeriMerchant produced the additional documentation to AdvanceMe on
which the entirety of AmeriMerchant’s proposed amendment is based.

See Ex. F.

Further, trial is set for January 14, 2008, and discovery does not close until July 17, 2007.
Both parties thus have ample time to conduct all necessary discovery.
But, instead of addressing these facts directly, AdvanceMe ignores the precedent
of this Court that permitted an amendment seven months after the original deadline for
submission of preliminary invalidity contentions (and after the Markman hearing)4 and
proffers several stock claims of prejudice that are wholly disconnected from the facts of
this case. AdvanceMe claims that AmeriMerchant’s proposed amendment threatens “to
throw the discovery process into chaos” because AdvanceMe has “prepared discovery
requests, responded to discovery, conducted depositions, and prepared for claims
3

AmeriMerchant again notes that it is not proposing an amendment to include a prior art reference
that was undisclosed in its original Preliminary Invalidity Contentions; rather, it is proposing to supplement
its Original Contentions to include further support found in documents obtained after the Original
Contentions were served.

See Alt v. Medtronic, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4435, *13-14 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 1, 2006).

construction relying on AmeriMerchant’s original Preliminary Invalidity Contentions.”
Opposition at 11. AdvanceMe also inexplicably claims that it would have to propound
“new requests for admission and new requests for production.”

Id.

AdvanceMe’s

specious claims of prejudice may appear credible in a vacuum, but they are wholly
inapplicable to this case.
First, as the parties in this action are to produce all documents relevant to any
claim or defense without discovery requests, pursuant to the patent rules and Discovery
Order, and as AdvanceMe has not served a single request for admission on
AmeriMerchant, AdvanceMe’s claim of prejudice based on propounding “new requests
for admission and new requests for production” are questionable at best. Regarding
“respond[ing] to discovery,” AdvanceMe has not produced a single non-publicly
available document in this action,5 but instead has only produced several thousand pages
of publicly available prosecution histories, and the articles and patents cited therein. Nor
has AdvanceMe responded to the single interrogatory propounded by AmeriMerchant.
AdvanceMe does not explain how its lack of discovery response has in any way been
affected by AmeriMerchant’s proposed amendment.
Second, AdvanceMe argues that it has “prepared for claims construction relying
on AmeriMerchant’s original Preliminary Invalidity Contentions.” Opposition at 11.
While it is clear from AdvanceMe’s proposed constructions that it is attempting to
exclude prior art through erroneous claim construction, as explained in AmeriMerchant’s
Responsive Claim Construction Brief at 5-12 and 16-21, invalidity contentions and prior
art are wholly irrelevant to claim construction analysis and thus provide no basis for
5

However, yesterday, Plaintiff, for the first time produced some discovery, in the form of excerpts
from three depositions in another case, where Defendants had been requesting the entire deposition
transcripts for some time.

Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL

Page 9 of 13

AdvanceMe’s claims of prejudice. See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1327
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc).
Third, only two depositions have been taken in this case, both of which were
noticed by AmeriMerchant: Mr. Litle and the alleged inventor, Barbara Johnson.6 At Mr.
Litle’s deposition on September 6, 2006, both parties examined Mr. Litle on the
documents that AmeriMerchant received by July 25, 2006 and that AmeriMerchant
produced to AdvanceMe on or before July 28, 2006.

In other words, AdvanceMe

received all Litle & Company documents on which AmeriMerchant’s proposed
amendment is based, and on which AmeriMerchant’s questioning at Mr. Litle’s
deposition was largely based, over a month prior to Mr. Litle’s deposition, and
AdvanceMe had the opportunity to question Mr. Litle based on all of those documents.
Further, AdvanceMe served a subpoena requesting additional documents on Mr. Litle,
and Mr. Litle produced all relevant documents pursuant to that subpoena in advance of
the deposition. AdvanceMe thus had every opportunity to examine Mr. Litle based on all
relevant documents at his deposition September 6th, which it did for roughly three hours.
AdvanceMe also fails to mention that upon receiving Defendant's updated invalidity
contentions on August 31, 2006, AdvanceMe contacted Mr. Litle, asked him questions,
and told him that his deposition would be taken on September 6, 2006.

How can

AdvanceMe now pretend it was not ready for the deposition on the date it chose for the
deposition?
As shown above, AdvanceMe’s stock claims of prejudice are untenable under the
facts of this case. The reality is that, despite AdvanceMe’s rhetoric of “enough [is]
6

Barbara Johnson was deposed on June 28, 2006 at the location of AdvanceMe’s choice, well
before the July 20, 2006 scheduling order deadline for submitting preliminary invalidity contentions.

enough,” Opposition at 2, the trial in this case is more than a year away and discovery
does not close for nearly 10 months, and AdvanceMe will suffer no actual prejudice from
the Court’s granting AmeriMerchant’s Motion. This factor thus also weighs in favor of
permitting AmeriMerchant’s proposed amendment.
4.

Availability of a Continuance

As explained in AmeriMerchant’s Motion, any prejudice suffered by AdvanceMe
could be cured by a continuance of the pre-trial deadlines. Motion at 9. AdvanceMe
does not argue that such a continuance would not cure any prejudice suffered; instead,
AdvanceMe claims that its “planning for [certain unrelated] discovery would have to be
modified,” including the claim construction hearing and AmeriMerchant’s 30(b)(6)
deposition. Opposition at 12. AdvanceMe, however, fails to explain how its “planning”
for this discovery would “have to be modified,” or why a continuance would not resolve
any such “planning” issues. This factor thus weighs heavily in favor of permitting
AmeriMerchant’s proposed amendment.
B.

The Court Should Deny AdvanceMe’s Premature Request
In

what

appears

to

be

AdvanceMe’s

true

motivation

in

opposing

AmeriMerchant’s meritorious Motion, AdvanceMe argues that it would have been
willing to agree to the amended Invalidity Contentions provided that “this should be the
last set of amended contentions that AmeriMerchant is permitted to serve in this case.”
Opposition at 12. AdvanceMe’s novel suggestion of a preemptive approach to future
amendments, even if based on good cause, is not only unsupported, but contrary to the
interests of justice. Indeed, such an argument reveals the lack of a credible argument in
opposition to the current Motion. The Court should not permit AdvanceMe to cower
behind stock claims of prejudice in an attempt to avoid introduction or development of
10

Case 6:06-cv-00082-LED-JDL

Page 11 of 13

invalidating prior art. Third party depositions to provide additional evidence to support
the disclosed prior art are still being scheduled,7 and additional facts regarding prior art
systems which were used commercially more than 10 years ago by various companies,
many of whom no longer exist, are still being investigated on an urgent basis.
AmeriMerchant thus respectfully requests that AdvanceMe’s request for an arbitrary,
preemptive exclusion of any future proposed amendments to AmeriMerchant’s
Preliminary Invalidity Contentions be disregarded.
III.
CONCLUSION
Defendant therefore respectfully requests that the Court grant the motion for leave
to amend, and that any future motions for leave to amend be considered on their own
merits.
