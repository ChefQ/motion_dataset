17. On September 6, 2006, the parties attended the deposition of Tim Litle in Lowell,
Massachusetts. During a break in this deposition, the Defendants' counsel
suddenly raised, for the very first time, the prospect that they would file a motion for
leave to amend their Preliminary Invalidity Contentions to add the new information in
their "Second Amended" contentions. I responded that AdvanceMe believed it had very

good arguments why none of those amendments would be permitted (because they were
based on information that the Defendants had known for months and yet failed to seek
Court approval). I further indicated that, if AdvanceMe was to consider agreeing to any
of these amendments, it could not do so unless it could receive a stipulation that the
attempts by the Defendants to amend their contentions would be at an end. The
Defendants responded that they would not agree to this because they anticipated bringing
another motion to amend at some undetermined future date, based on information they
may learn in the Litle deposition.

18. During the September 6, 2006 deposition of Tim Litle, the Defendants' counsel
introduced as an exhibit for witness questioning Exhibit 6 to their "Second Amended"
invalidity contentions. The Defendants then proceeded to ask a series of questions of Mr.
Litle concerning these contentions.

19. After the September 6, 2006 deposition of Tim Litle, the parties met and conferred
further on the prospect of a motion to amend the Defendants' Preliminary Invalidity
Contentions. During the meet and confer, I continued to make clear that AdvanceMe
believed any such motion would be unsuccessful. However, I also explored the
possibility of stipulating to one or more of the Defendants! unauthorized amendments, if
it would mean that the Defendants' attempt to "amend" their contentions would finally
come to an end. The Defendants refused, however, to agree to this condition. To the
contrary, Defendants' counsel again repeated that, even if the upcoming motion to amend
was granted, they intended to bring yet another motion to amend in the future. During
the meet and confer, J suggested that, at minimum, the Defendants should just place all
their sought-after amendments in a single document, rather than burdening the parties

with multiple motions. The Defendants refused to agree to this suggestion, and instead
stated that they were not yet "ready" to make a decision as to whether to file another
motion for leave.

I declare under the penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the

foregoing is true and correct.
