BACKGROUND

On February 27, 2006, Plaintiff amended an existing complaint in the RapidPay
action to add claims of infringement of United States Patent No. 6,941,281 (the “‘281
Patent”) against the RapidPay Defendants. Also on February 27, 2006, Plaintiff filed this
parallel action against AmeriMerchant (the “AmeriMerchant action”), claiming
infringement of the ‘281 Patent. Defendants’ national counsel, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.
(“V&E”), was retained on April 20, 2006, and Defendants, with the assistance of counsel,
immediately began searching for relevant prior art. Because of the nature of the claimed
invention, a business method for automated payments, prior art could not be identified
through the types of library, database, and patent office searches that are common, and
often effective, in many patent infringement cases. As is shown below, locating prior art
in this matter requires intensive personal investigation by Defendants into the decadesold practices of processing and related companies (who are often competitors of
Defendants), location of witnesses who recall these practices (and are willing to speak
with competitors about them), and location of relevant documents and agreements
(which, if they have been maintained, are likely warehoused).
Nevertheless, by July 7, 2006, the deadline for filing preliminary invalidity
contentions in the RapidPay action, the RapidPay Defendants identified four different
pieces of prior art and served their preliminary invalidity contentions with supporting
documentation. Defendants continued to search for relevant prior art, and on July 20,
2006, the deadline for filing preliminary invalidity contentions in the AmeriMerchant
action, AmeriMerchant served its preliminary invalidity contentions, which included two
pieces of prior art – referred to as the “Litle & Co. Prior Art” and “EDS Prior Art” – in

2

addition to the four pieces of prior art identified by the RapidPay Defendants, along with
supporting documentation. The following day, July 21, 2006, the RapidPay Defendants
amended their invalidity contentions to reflect these two new pieces of prior art.
Search for Litle & Co. Prior Art. The search for documents and information
supporting the Litle & Co. Prior Art began days after V&E’s retention when David
Goldin (of AmeriMerchant) contacted Tim Litle, founder of Litle & Co. See April 26,
2006 E-Mail from David Goldin to Tim Litle, attached as Exhibit A to Declaration of
Joseph D. Gray, dated September 13, 2006 (“Gray Declaration”). Mr. Litle sold the
relevant company in 1995 and, accordingly, no longer possessed documents reflecting
that company’s practices in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

As a result, locating

potentially relevant documents took several months and required the cooperation of not
only Mr. Litle but the new management of the company he sold (now called Paymentech,
which is a competitor of Mr. Litle’s current company). It was not until June 19, 2006 that
Paymentech provided any documents regarding the prior art practiced by Litle & Co. in
the early 1990s, and then provided only fragments of relevant documents. See Facsimile
from Paymentech to David Goldin, dated June 19, 2006, attached as Exhibit B to Gray
Declaration. Defendants diligently continued the effort to locate complete copies of
documentation, and on July 14, 2006, Defendants received additional relevant documents
from Paymentech. See E-Mail from David Goldin to Tim Litle, dated July 14, 2006,
attached as Exhibit C to Gray Declaration. These documents were produced to Plaintiff
and analyzed in AmeriMerchant’s Preliminary Invalidity Contentions (see page 3, supra,
served on July 20, 2006) and in the RapidPay Defendants’ Amended Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions (see page 3, supra, served July 21, 2006). On July 25, 2006,

Page 4 of 12

Defendants finally received a complete agreement and additional supporting
documentation regarding the prior art practiced by Litle & Co. See Facsimile from
Paymentech to David Goldin, dated July 25, 2006, attached as Exhibit D to Gray
Declaration. Defendants promptly provided these documents to Plaintiff on July 28,
2006.
On August 30 and 31, 2006, Defendants again promptly provided additional
documents supporting the Litle & Co. Prior Art and served amended preliminary
invalidity contentions in both actions (the AmeriMerchant Amended Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions and the RapidPay Defendants’ Second Amended Invalidity
Contentions). These amendments did not add new prior art but only provided additional
support for the Litle & Co. Prior Art previously identified in AmeriMerchant’s
Preliminary Invalidity Contentions, served July 20, 2006. Unfortunately, Defendants did
not seek an order of the Court allowing these amendments in the RapidPay and
AmeriMerchant actions or allowing the previous amendment on July 21, 2006 in the
RapidPay action. Defendants respectfully seek by this motion an order of the Court
permitting them to amend their preliminary invalidity contentions pursuant to P.R. 3-7.
II.

ARGUMENT

As this Court has held, Preliminary Invalidity Contentions may be amended upon
the showing of good cause. STMicroelectronics, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 2d
845, 849 (E.D. Tex. 2004) (Davis, J.) (“Patent Rule 3-7 incorporates Rule 16(b)’s good
cause standard by stating ‘amendment or modification of the Preliminary or Final
Infringement Contentions or the Preliminary or Final Invalidity Contentions . . . may be
made only by order of the Court, which shall be entered only upon a showing of good

cause.’”); see FED. R. CIV. P. 16 (providing in part, “a [scheduling order] shall not be
modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district court . . . .”).
“The good cause standard requires the party seeking relief to show that, despite its
exercise of diligence, it cannot reasonably meet the scheduling deadlines.” Ciena Corp.
v. Nortel Networks Inc., 233 F.R.D. 493, 494 (E.D. Tex. 2006) (Davis, J.) (citing S&W
Enters., L.L.C. v. SouthtrustBank of Ala., 315 F.3d 533, 535 (5th Cir. 2003)). In a recent
decision by this Court permitting amendment of invalidity contentions after the
prescribed deadline, four considerations were weighed: “(1) the explanation for the
failure to meet the deadline; (2) the importance of the thing that would be excluded; (3)
potential prejudice in allowing the thing that would be excluded; and (4) the availability
of a continuance to cure such prejudice.” Alt v. Medtronic, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
4435 (Feb. 1, 2006) (Davis, J.) (internal citations omitted). As set forth below, each of
these factors weighs strongly in favor of permitting the requested amendment.
A.

Defendants Diligently Searched for Potentially Relevant
Prior Art and Gave Notice to Plaintiff Promptly After Discovery

As set forth above in the Background section, the documents and analysis
contained in AmeriMerchant’s Amended Preliminary Invalidity Contentions and the
RapidPay Defendants’ Second Amended Preliminary Invalidity Contentions could not
have been submitted by the initial deadlines prescribed in the applicable Docket Control
Orders because these documents and this information was not actually available to, or
reasonably obtainable by, Defendants at that time. The materials supporting the Litle &
Co. Prior Art were obtained after several months of diligent investigation and effort by
Defendants. See pages 3-4, supra. Initial contact was made with Mr. Litle in April 2006,
only days after V&E was retained. The documents sought were more than a decade out

5

of date, and the involved company, Litle & Co., had been sold in the intervening years.
See supra. Relevant documents and information had to be unearthed from the archives of
Litle & Co.’s successor company – and Mr. Litle’s current competitor – Paymentech.
Defendants obtained documents sufficient to show that Litle & Co.’s practices in the
early 1990s anticipated asserted claims of the ‘281 patent just after the RapidPay
deadline for submitting preliminary invalidity contentions, but just before the deadline in
the AmeriMerchant action. Accordingly, AmeriMerchant timely included the Litle & Co.
Prior Art in its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions. The following day, the RapidPay
Defendants gave notice to Plaintiff, who is the same in both actions, that it would seek to
include the Litle & Co. Prior Art in an amended version of their invalidity contentions,
and the RapidPay Defendants provided the analysis required by P.R. 3-3 at that same
time. Subsequently, Defendants obtained additional documentation supporting the Litle
& Co. Prior Art. Defendants produced this documentation to Plaintiff within days of
receiving it, and then also provided a revised P.R. 3-3 analysis. See supra.
The initial deadlines for provision of the Preliminary Invalidity Contentions were
July 7 and 20 for the RapidPay and AmeriMerchant actions, respectively.

Despite

diligently beginning their efforts to obtain relevant Litle & Co. documents within days of
V&E’s involvement and several weeks before these deadlines, Defendants did not obtain
complete copies of the supporting documents until late July. Accordingly, Defendants
could not have filed by the initial deadline the invalidity contentions that it now seeks
permission to include in an amendment.

The Litle & Co. Prior Art Anticipates All Relevant Asserted Claims

The second factor considered by the Court in evaluating whether a modification
of the schedule is appropriate is the importance of the material that could be excluded if
the modification is not permitted. See Alt, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4435. Here, the
additional documents and analysis included in the amended invalidity contentions are
critically important to Defendants’ defense of AdvanceMe’s claims as they further
demonstrate that Litle & Co. was practicing commercially and publicly a method and
system that anticipates all relevant asserted claims. The importance of these materials
was recently confirmed in a deposition of Mr. Litle, in which he testified in detail as to
how the activities of the company he founded, as supported by these additional
documents, anticipate every relevant claim of the ‘281 patent. Defendants intend to file a
partial summary judgment motion for invalidity based on the prior art that was originally
disclosed in the AmeriMerchant Preliminary Invalidity Contentions served July 20, 2006
(and in the RapidPay Defendants’ Amended Preliminary Invalidity Contentions served
July 21, 2006), further developed in the AmeriMerchant Amended Preliminary Invalidity
Contentions and the RapidPay Defendants’ Second Amended Preliminary Invalidity
Contentions (both served August 30, 2006), and then confirmed in Mr. Litle’s deposition.
Where, as is true here, the prior art sought to be included in an amendment shows
a prior invention of the asserted claims “by someone other than the alleged inventor,” this
Court has agreed that defendants satisfy this second prong of the analysis. See Alt, 2006
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4435, *12-13 (agreeing that such prior art is “very important to
[defendant’s] ability to mount a defense to [plaintiff’s] infringement claims and that

[defendant] would suffer significant prejudice in the event it was not allowed to present
these references”).
C.

There Will Be No Prejudice to Plaintiff if the Court Permits the
Amendment

Plaintiff cannot credibly argue that they have been or will be prejudiced if the
requested amendment is permitted. AmeriMerchant included the initial framework for
the Litle & Co. Prior Art in its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions, which were served by
the deadline prescribed in this Court’s Docket Control Order. As additional supporting
documents were painstakingly obtained by Defendants, they were provided promptly to
Plaintiff, as were supplemental analyses under P.R. 3-3. And all of these documents and
supplemental analyses were provided to Plaintiff well in advance of any significant
deadlines or other events in this matter and within weeks of the initial deadlines for
serving preliminary invalidity contentions (approximately eight weeks in RapidPay
action and five weeks in AmeriMerchant action). Cf. Alt, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4435,
*13-14 (rejecting claims of prejudice when amendment was sought seven months after
the initial deadline for preliminary invalidity contentions and after claim construction
briefing and the Markman hearing).
Furthermore, Plaintiff had sufficient notice of the Litle & Co. Prior Art to prepare
document requests to (and receive a document production from) Mr. Litle, which Plaintiff
did, in advance of Mr. Litle’s deposition on September 6, 2006. And Counsel for
Plaintiff had an ample opportunity at Mr. Litle’s deposition to examine him on any
aspects of the prior art references and documentation, thereby undercutting any claim of
prejudice Plaintiff might assert.

Last, although Plaintiff now has determined to oppose Defendants’ application for
leave to amend, this position is surprising given that it stands in stark contrast to
Plaintiff’s express request on August 2, 2006 – after receiving AmeriMerchant’s
Preliminary Invalidity Contentions and the RapidPay Defendants’ Amended Preliminary
Invalidity Contentions – that “[i]n the interest of clarity” Defendants “amend [their]
invalidity contentions to describe exactly how each of these pieces of alleged prior art
directly anticipates each of the claims at issue and the precise evidence relied on by the
defendants to establish this.” See Letter from Ronald Lemieux to Willem Schuurman,
dated August 2, 2006, attached as Exhibit E to Gray Declaration. Plaintiff’s initial desire
for “clarity” on the merits of this dispute apparently evaporated within the past month.
D.

Availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice

While the early notice to Plaintiff and opportunity to examine Mr. Litle regarding
the Litle & Co. Prior Art precludes any credible claim of prejudice, any prejudice that
Plaintiff does claim could be resolved by a continuance of the pre-trial deadlines. This
Court has recently recognized that such a continuance may cure the prejudice caused by
amendments to infringement or invalidity contentions. See Ciena Corp., 233 F.R.D. at
496; Alt v. Medtronic, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4435 at *16 (E.D.Tex. Feb. 1, 2006)
(Davis, J.).
III.

CONCLUSION

As demonstrated above, AmeriMerchant has established the good cause required
to amend its preliminary invalidity contentions pursuant to P.R. 3-7. For this reason,
AmeriMerchant respectfully requests that the Court grant its Motion for Leave to Amend
Preliminary Invalidity Contentions.
