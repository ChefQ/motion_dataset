IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Robert Bethea,
Plaintiff,

Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00386-RCL

v.
District of Columbia, Corrections Corporation of
America, Inc., Center for Correctional Health and
Policy Studies, Inc., Warden Douglas Caulfield,
Correctional Officer Roger Sinclair, Correctional
Officer Bonnie Scott, Correctional Officer Nicole
Hines,
Defendants.
DEFENDANT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, CORRECTIONS CORPORATION OF
AMERICA, CAULFIELD, SINCLAIR, SCOTT AND HINES’ RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO STAY AND RESPONSE TO AUSA'S RESPONSE TO THE
COURT'S FEBRUARY 6, 2008 ORDER
Defendants District of Columbia, Corrections Corporation of America, Caulfield,
Sinclair, Scott and Hines ("Defendants"), through counsel, submit this response to Plaintiff's
Motion to Stay and further respond to the Response of the Office of the United States Attorney
for the District of Columbia regarding the Court's February 6, 2008 Order authorizing the
Plaintiff's deposition to proceed.
This lawsuit was filed on February 22, 2007. Since that time, Defendants have
unsuccessfully attempted to coordinate Plaintiff's deposition with Plaintiff's counsel. As a result,
Defendants filed a Motion requesting Court approval to take the Plaintiff's deposition, which was
granted on February 6, 2008. On March 10, 2008, the Office of the United States Attorney for
the District of Columbia filed an objection to the Court's Order and proposed several alternatives
for taking Plaintiff's deposition at a later date.

In the Response filed by the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of
Columbia, several "options" were proposed for the parties on how to proceed with discovery in
this matter. One option was that the parties proceed with all other discovery and take the
deposition of the Plaintiff upon his release in October 2008. Defendants strongly object to this
proposal for several reasons. First, allowing the party who initiated this action to be deposed
after the close of discovery would be unduly prejudicial to the Defendants, who need
information about the Plaintiff's claims before proceeding with discovery. Taking Plaintiff's
deposition at the beginning of discovery allows the Defendants to obtain critical information that
may lead to further discovery.
Second, discussing Plaintiff's damages through deposition at the beginning of a case also
may lead to further discovery, may necessitate retaining damages or other experts, and might
lead to the parties discussing potential settlement before the costs and fees begin to accumulate.
Third, Defendants will be prejudiced by not being allowed to depose Plaintiff before
other fact witnesses in this case, as Defendants should be allowed to obtain Plaintiff’s testimony
without the possibility of it being “tainted” by way of Plaintiff being “counseled” by the
testimony of the Defendants and other fact witnesses. Finally, Defendants would be severely
prejudiced by being forced to depose Plaintiff through written interrogatory for the reason that
they will have no opportunity to evaluate Plaintiff as a witness, which is critical for potential
settlement, particularly in cases such as this where the participants stories are so vastly different.
Moreover, deposition by written questions does not allow the party taking the deposition to fully
explore the Plaintiff’s background, claims, and damages as it is impossible to predict how
Plaintiff will answer particular questions, thus making follow up at worst, impossible, at best,
cumbersome. Accordingly, the Defendants request that Plaintiff's deposition be taken first before

proceeding with further discovery.
Defendants instead propose the following: (1) that there be a stay of all discovery until
October 2008; (2) that the discovery deadlines be extended for an additional three months; or (3)
that this case be dismissed without prejudice to allow for reinstatement of the case after
Plaintiff's release. In the District, the Statute of Limitations is tolled while Plaintiff is
incarcerated resulting in no prejudice to the Plaintiff as a result of a dismissal without prejudice.
Each of these proposed alternatives were approved by the Office of the United States Attorney
and articulated in the March 10 Response.
As outlined above, Defendants urge the Court to reject any proposal that would prohibit
the Defendants from taking Plaintiff's deposition before any other deposition in the case, or
require they take Plaintiff’s deposition by way of written questions.
