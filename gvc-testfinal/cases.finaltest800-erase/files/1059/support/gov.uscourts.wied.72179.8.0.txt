6. According to the US Postal Service, Defendant Palmer received and accepted her service packet from
Plaintiff on December 28, 2015. (Exhibit 1).

7. The deadline for Defendant Palmer to sign and return the form to this court was January 18, 2016. As
of this date, she has neither returned a signed copy of the Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge, or her
Waiver of the Service of Summons forms.

8. The Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge form, electronically signed by the Honorable

William C. Griesbach, Chief Judge for the US District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Division

states as follows:

"While the decision to consent or not to consent to the exercise of jurisdiction by the magistrate judge
is entirely voluntary, the duty to respond to this order is mandatory. Your response shall be made to
the Clerk of Court only on the reverse side of this notice.

"IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, that you complete this form and file it with the Clerk of Court
within twenty-one (21) days from receipt." (Emphasis on original)

WHEREFORE as the deadline to respond to the Court's order has passed and Defendant Palmer has
written about her knowledge of being a defendant in the instant suit on her Internet blog (Exhibit 2) and has shown
no interest whatsoever in abiding by the orders of this Honorable Court, it is respectfully requested that this motion

be granted and for any other relief which this Court deems just and proper.
