UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
MILWAUKEE DIVISION

WILLIAM SCHMALFELDT,
Case No. 2:15-cv-01516-NJ
Plaintiff,
v.
SARAH PALMER, ET AL.,
Defendants.

DEFENDANT PALMER’S OPPOSITION TO THE PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SHOW
CAUSE (ECF NO. 8)

NOW COMES Defendant Sarah Palmer, by her counsel Aaron J. Walker, Esq., in the
above-styled case for the sole purpose of filing this Opposition to the Plaintiff’s Motion to Show
Cause (hereinafter “MSCO”) (ECF No. 8), without waiving any rights of jurisdiction, notice,
process, service of process, joinder, or venue, and states the following:
1.

Before a person can be found in contempt, it must first be established that this

Court has obtained personal jurisdiction over him or her. It is elementary that “[j]urisdiction is
the power of the court to decide a matter in controversy, and presupposes the existence of a duly
constituted court with control over the subject matter and the parties.” Pinner v. Pinner, 33
N.C.App. 204, 206 (1977).
2.

Whether this Court has jurisdiction over a defendant is governed by Fed. R. Civ.

P. 4(k)(1) which states in relevant part:
(1)

In General. Serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes
personal jurisdiction over a defendant:

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ Filed 03/01/16 Page 1 of 5 Document 14

(A)

who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction
in the state where the district court is located[.]

There has been no proper service of process, and there has been no waiver. Therefore, there can
be no contempt because this Court had not established control over Mrs. Palmer because of the
Plaintiff’s failure to properly serve her. 1
3.

The Plaintiff’s sole attempt to assert that he had completed service of process is

found in paragraph 6 of his MSCO, where he claims to have personally served Mrs. Palmer by
mail as follows: “[a]ccording to the U.S. Postal Service, Defendant Palmer received and accepted
her service packet from Plaintiff on December 28, 2015.

(Exhibit 1).” (emphasis added).

However, this is forbidden under Rule 4(c)(2), which states that the parties cannot personally
carry out service of process as follows: “[a]ny person who is at least 18 years old and not a party
may serve a summons and complaint” (emphasis added). Because the Plaintiff sent this service
personally, this attempted service is a nullity. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s attempted service on
February 13, 2016, is a silent confession that he knew he didn’t serve Mrs. Palmer correctly the
first time.
4.

Further, if one examines Exhibit 1, it does not establish that Sarah Palmer actually

received it. First, Exhibit 1 has clearly been altered to an unknown degree. Second, even if one
recovers the tracking data from the USPS website (removing the Plaintiff’s alterations) one is
still left only with a statement that it was delivered to some unknown address in Reidsville,
North Carolina—not necessarily Mrs. Palmer’s house. Third, the same Exhibit 1 doesn’t state
that the mail was sent restricted delivery; therefore, even if it was sent to Mrs. Palmer’s home,
there was no guarantee that it would have been received by Mrs. Palmer.
1

Further, Mrs. Palmer has also contested whether this Court could exercise personal jurisdiction
over her. See the “Joint Motion To Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1), (2), and (5), and Opposition to
Leave to Amend” filed simultaneously with this opposition, on pages 5-14.

5.

Furthermore, Mrs. Palmer had a good reason to ignore any and all mail from the

Plaintiff. Attached as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of a “No Contact Order for Stalking or
Non-Consensual Sexual Contact” (hereinafter the “No Contact Order”) issued in order to protect
Mrs. Palmer from the Plaintiff. It forbade (in part) the instant Plaintiff from contacting Mrs.
Palmer “by telephone, written communication, or electronic means.” 2 The existence of this
order shows that Mrs. Palmer had a very good reason for disregarding mailed communications
from the Plaintiff.
6.

Indeed, as pointed out in the “Joint Motion To Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1), (2),

and (5), and Opposition to Leave to Amend,” 3 the Plaintiff still hasn’t properly served Mrs.
Palmer. Not only did he fail to serve a copy of the original complaint, but he failed to serve
either Mr. Johnson or Mrs. Palmer with a copy of the “Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate
Judge” form when he attempted service.

However, in the name of judicial efficiency,

Defendants Palmer and Johnson have filed their “Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge”
forms as downloaded by counsel. This is done by Defendants Johnson and Palmer without
waiving any rights of jurisdiction, notice, process, service of process, joinder, or venue.
7.

In summary, because the Plaintiff has failed to properly serve Mrs. Palmer there is

no cause to believe she is in contempt of this Court’s orders.

WHEREFORE, this Court should deny the Plaintiff’s motion for a show cause order because, to
this day, Defendant Palmer has never been properly served in this case.
2

What is attached is a non-certified copy of No Contact Order. In compliance with this Court’s
Electronic Case Filing Policies and Procedures Manuel, counsel has retained certified copy of
this No Contact Order in his records and will provide it to this Court if there is any question of
the authenticity of the attached document.

This opposition was filed simultaneously with the “Joint Motion To Dismiss Under Rule
12(b)(1), (2), and (5), and Opposition to Leave to Amend.”
