Defendants MP3tunes Inc. (“MP3tunes”) and Michael Robertson respectfully submit this
memorandum of law in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Having reviewed and carefully analyzed literally hundreds of pages of summary judgment
briefing and amici briefing and conducting oral arguments on the parties’ motions, this Court held,
inter alia, that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) applies to sound recordings
fixed prior to 1972 (“Pre-1972 Sound Recordings”) and that MP3tunes had clearly complied with
the DMCA safe harbor provisions by reasonably implementing a repeat infringer policy. Despite
the overwhelming efforts made by this Court, Plaintiffs, clearly displeased and unsatisfied with this
Court’s decision, are now seeking reconsideration of these issues—citing to no new law or
evidence, but arguing that “clear error” or “manifest injustice” must have occurred.
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration is a mere vehicle to reargue positions already
carefully considered—and rejected—by this Court. However, motions for reconsideration are an
extraordinary remedy and should not be made to frivolously re-litigate issues merely because a
party is unhappy with the Court’s ruling. Indeed, motions for reconsideration must adhere to strict
standards and are only granted in extremely rare instances where a movant can demonstrate: an
intervening change in controlling law; the availability of new evidence; or the need to correct a
clear error or prevent manifest injustice.
Plaintiffs themselves concede that the first two grounds do not apply here. There has been
no intervening changes in law and no new evidence has been put forth. Plaintiffs are left with no
option but to cry clear error of law or manifest injustice committed by this Court. Thus, Plaintiffs
allege that this Court committed clear error because it overlooked controlling law and facts. Indeed,
3

this claim is quite incredible given that Plaintiffs offered absolutely no controlling law in support of
their positions—not in their summary judgment papers or in their Motion for Reconsideration. Nor
do Plaintiffs point to any facts that were not already considered by this Court. Accordingly, the
Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration because Plaintiffs have failed to
demonstrate any exceptional circumstances which would warrant the Court’s award of such
extraordinary remedy.

ARGUMENT

Legal Standard
“Reconsideration of a previous order by the court is an extraordinary remedy to be

employed sparingly in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.” Hinds
Cnty., Miss. v. Wachovia Bank N.A., 700 F. Supp. 2d 378, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). “[T]he standard of review applicable to such a motion is strict.”
United States v. Morillo-Vidal, No. 10-CV-222, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103051, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.
Sept. 6, 2011). “Such motions must be narrowly construed and strictly applied in order to
discourage litigants from making repetitive arguments on issues that have been thoroughly
considered by the court.” Range Road Music, Inc. v. Music Sales Corp., 90 F.Supp.2d 390, 391-92
(S.D.N.Y. 2000). Indeed, “[a] motion for reconsideration is not intended as a vehicle for a party
dissatisfied with the Court's ruling to advance new theories that the movant failed to advance in
connection with the underlying motion, nor to secure a rehearing on the merits with regard to issues
already decided.” Hopkinson v. Estate of Siegal, No. 10 Civ. 1743, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76071,

solely to re-litigate an issue already decided”).

Motions for reconsideration are generally disfavored and “granted only upon a showing of
exceptional circumstances.” Marrero Pichardo v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation
omitted). Courts have limited these exceptional circumstances to the following: (1) “an intervening
change of controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct a clear
error or prevent manifest injustice.’” Doe v. NYC Dep't of Soc. Servs., 709 F.2d 782, 789 (2d Cir.
1983)); see also Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir.

overruling, not a mere clarification).
Courts do not differentiate between clear error and manifest injustice. Rather, “[m]anifest
injustice is defined as an error . . . that is direct, obvious, and observable . . . .” Enron Corp. v. J.P.
Morgan Sec. (In re Enron Corp.), 356 B.R. 343, 362 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006) (citations omitted).
Courts only find clear error or manifest injustice when the movant demonstrates “controlling
decisions or data that the court overlooked—matters, in other words, that might reasonably be
expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.” In re BDC 56 LLC, 330 F.3d 111, 123 (2d
Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).
Manifest injustice or clear error has not occurred where the movant for reconsideration
merely rehashes what the court has already considered. See Kittay v. Korff (In re Palermo, No. 08
CV 7421, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11681, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2011) (denying reconsideration

manifest injustice did not result from misrepresentations to the Court or a disregard of an order);
Tortora v. SBC Communs., Inc., No. 09-CV-7895 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100978, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.

distillation of the unsuccessful arguments” already rejected by this Court).

II.

Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate Clear Error or Manifest Injustice Warranting a
Reconsideration of the Court’s Decision that the DMCA’s Safe Harbors Apply to
Common Law Copyright Infringement Claims
Plaintiffs fail to meet the strict standard for moving for reconsideration. They have not

identified any change in the law, nor any new evidence, nor any clear error or manifest injustice that
warrants the extraordinary remedy of reconsideration. In Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration,
Plaintiffs allege that this Court overlooked controlling law in determining that the DMCA applied
Pre-1972 Sound Recordings. Incredibly, despite this audacious claim, Plaintiffs cite to not one
single case in their summary judgment papers in which a court has held that the DMCA does not
apply to Pre-1972 Sound Recordings.

A.

Plaintiffs Fail to Identify Controlling Law or Controlling Facts Overlooked by
this Court in Determining that the DMCA’s Safe Harbors Apply to Claims of
Infringement of Pre-1927 Sound Recordings

Plaintiffs’ failure or inability to identify any controlling law purportedly overlooked by this
Court is unsurprising. Despite the numerous copyright infringement actions involving the DMCA,
no court has ever held that the DMCA’s safe harbor provisions do not apply to infringement claims
regarding Pre-1972 Sound Recordings. 1 Indeed, no court has issued any law on this issue—much
less law that controls this Court.

1

Defendants pointed out the first time this issue was before this Court that Plaintiffs failed to cite
any law in support of their position, relying instead on copyright law as interpreted by EMI, a
point Plaintiffs never challenged. See Dkt. #238 at 12.
6

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

Filed 09/23/11 Page 7 of 19

Accordingly, in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration, Plaintiffs simply rehash the
convoluted statutory interpretation arguments that they presented to this Court at summary
judgment and which this Court rejected. While Plaintiffs may disagree with this Court’s rejection
of those arguments and its finding that the “plain meaning of the statutory language makes the
DMCA safe harbors applicable to both state and federal copyright claims” and “applies to sound
recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972,” Order, Dkt. #267 at 12, Plaintiffs point to no clear
error in the Court’s finding because there is none.
Indeed, the relevant case law on statutory construction supports this Court’s decision. As
the Supreme Court of the United States has held, “where Congress includes particular language in
one section of a statute but omits it in another . . . it is generally presumed that Congress acts
intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Keene Corp. v. United
States, 508 U.S. 200, 208 (1993) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)). In
this case, section 1201 of the DMCA, which provides the statutes anti-circumvention provisions,
states that that section applies to “a work protected under [the Copyright Act].” See 17 U.S.C. §
1201. In contrast, section 512 of the DMCA states the safe harbors apply to “infringement of
copyright.” See 17 U.S.C. § 512. Accordingly, applying principles set forth by the United States
Supreme Court in Keene, Congress meant what it said when it referred to “infringement of
copyright” in section 512 of the DMCA and then when it referred to infringement under the
Copyright Act in section 1201 of the DMCA. Congress clearly intended for the DMCA’s safe
harbor provisions to apply to infringement of both federal and state copyright infringement claims.

B.

This Court’s Reading of Section 512 Is Correct Because Section 512 Does Not
Conflict with Section 301(c)

In their Motion for Reconsideration papers, Plaintiffs merely reiterate their original
summary judgment papers when they claim a plain reading of section 512 of the Copyright Act is

7

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

Filed 09/23/11 Page 8 of 19

erroneous because it would conflict with section 301 and, given section 512’s much later enactment,
cause an implicit repeal of section 301. See Dkt. 209 at 36, n. 17. However, this argument was
clearly and properly rejected.
Section 301(c) merely provides that “[w]ith respect to sound recordings fixed before
February 15, 1972, any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any state shall not
be annulled or limited by this title until February 15, 2067,” 17 U.S.C. § 301(c). However, there is
no statutory conflict between sections 512 and 301(c) because section 512 does not limit or annul
any rights or remedies under the common law or state law. The safe harbors provided by section
512 of the DMCA do not prevent Plaintiffs from enforcing any rights or remedies under the
common law or statutes of any state with respect to their Pre-1972 Sound Recordings—rather they
merely help clarify what activity constitutes infringement.
The courts have a long history of allowing a wide of array of common law rights and
remedies to be used to protect Pre-1972 Sound Recordings, and each is available to Plaintiffs
unhindered by the safe harbors of the DMCA. See, e.g., Capitol Records, Inc. v. Greatest Records,
Inc., 252 N.Y.S.2d 553, 555-558 (Sup. Ct. 1964) (listing various common law rights used to protect
Pre-1972 Sound Recordings from infringement). As explained in the Brief of Amicus Curiae
Google Inc. in Support of Defendants, the DMCA’s safe harbors “merely affect who the proper
defendants are for claims seeking to enforce such rights, and from whom remedies may be sought.”
Dkt. # 249 at 12.
Far from limiting or annulling Plaintiffs’ common law rights, section 512 of the DMCA
merely insures that innocent service providers—who cannot possibly monitor or control all the
content posted by their users and who do not benefit from the infringement—are not held liable for
the infringing activities of their users. Indeed, the copyright holders’ rights or remedies are clearly
neither limited or annulled because the copyright holders are still capable of seeking redress from
the actual infringers—the users themselves. Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves made this same
8

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

Filed 09/23/11 Page 9 of 19

argument, acknowledging that the DMCA’s “immunity is not presumptive, but granted only to
‘innocent’ service providers.” See Dkt. #207 at 35. Accordingly, section 512 does not limit or
deprive Plaintiffs of their common law or state law rights in Pre-1972 Sound Recordings. It merely
clarifies the definition of infringement. [DISCUSS]
Indeed, judicial recognition of federal copyright defenses in connection with Pre-1972
Sound Recordings has long peacefully coexisted with rights and remedies under state and common
law. By way of example, section 107 of the Copyright Act provides the defense that “the fair use of
a copyrighted work . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . .
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. The fair use
defense has been applied in cases involving common law rights in Pre-1972 Sound Recordings
without conflicting with section 301(c). See, e.g., EMI Records Limited v. Premise Media Corp.
L.P., No. 601209/08, 2008 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 7485, at *31 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Aug. 8, 2008) (applying
fair use defense to infringement of Pre-1972 Sound Recordings). Like the fair use defense provided
under section 107, the DMCA safe harbor provisions do not annul or limit rights and remedies
under state or common law for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings. Instead, these provisions merely
clarify what does not constitute infringement.
C.

Applying the DMCA Safe Harbor Provisions to Pre-1972 Sound Recordings
Achieves the Legislative Intent and Spirit of the DMCA

Moreover, Plaintiffs’ reading of the Copyright Act is contrary to Congress’ express intent.
Congress’ explicit goal in enacting the DMCA was to clarify copyright law with respect to the
online world in order to foster faster and robust development of the Internet. As explained in the
Brief of Amici Curiae Public Knowledge, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Consumer Electronics
Association, and Home Recording Rights Coalition (“PK Amici Brief”), “Congress created a set of
safe harbors designed to provide greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal
exposure for infringements that might occur in the course of their activities.” Dkt. # 203 at 8; see
9

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

Filed 09/23/11 Page 10 of 19

also 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12B.01[A][1] (2010)
(describing uncertain state of copyright law as applied to Internet companies prior to the DMCA).
As Congress explained, the “DMCA ensures that the efficiency of the Internet will continue to
improve and that the variety and quality of services on the Internet will continue to expand.” S.
Rep. No. 105-190, at 1-2 (1998). Applying the DMCA’s safe harbor provisions to songs recorded
after February 15, 1972, but not to songs recorded prior to that date, would undermine this intent by
creating a climate of legal uncertainty and would discourage service providers from investing in and
developing Internet based commerce due to the risk of legal exposure as the result of the activity of
third parties. Since there is no way to monitor or control the activities of third parties, investment
and development in the Internet would be stifled because the risk of exposure and/or the costs of
creating a system to monitor and control these third parties. Even if possible, such a system would
be prohibitive. Requiring service providers to make such determinations and expose themselves to
liability for infringements of their users would be prohibitively expensive, thus discouraging the
very investment and growth that Congress hoped to encourage when it enacted the DMCA.
Thus, this Court correctly held that the DMCA safe harbor provisions apply to Pre-1972
Sound Recordings. Having merely rehashed arguments already considered by this Court and
having failed to point to any controlling authority or facts which this Court has overlooked,
Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate any grounds for reconsideration of this Court’s finding.

III.

Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate Clear Error or Manifest Injustice in this Court’s
Finding that MP3tunes Has Reasonably Implemented a Repeat Infringer Policy
To qualify for a safe harbor, the DMCA requires a service provider to “adopt[] and

reasonably implement[] . . . a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances
of subscribers and account holders of the service provider’s system or network who are repeat
infringers . . . .” 17 U.S.C. § 512(i)(1)(A). In their summary judgment papers, Plaintiffs argued

10

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

Filed 09/23/11 Page 11 of 19

two points in attempting to sway this Court that MP3tunes had not complied with this requirement:
(1) the DMCA obligated MP3tunes to terminate the accounts of users identified in more than one
takedown notice; and (2) MP3tunes’ evidence that it had terminated user accounts for copyright
infringement was insufficient. Dkt. # 207 at 37; Dkt. # 209 at 23. However, this Court expressly
rejected these arguments holding that MP3tunes had satisfied the DMCA’s repeat infringer policy
requirement. Apparently dissatisfied with this result, Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration, once
again crying accusations of “clear error” and “manifest injustice.” However, Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Reconsideration again fails to demonstrate intervening law or new facts, or clear error or manifest
injustice to warrant the extreme remedy of reconsideration. Instead, Plaintiffs merely rehash the
same arguments from their summary judgment papers hoping that their brash persistence will lead
to a better result.
Indeed, Plaintiffs’ brazen accusations that this Court overlooked controlling law are
incredible given that Plaintiffs have not offering one single controlling case that supports their
position that MP3tunes was obligated to terminate the accounts of users who could be identified
from more than one take-down notice. Given that the weight of authority clearly supports this
Courts finding, Plaintiffs’ accusations seem to more the product of wishful thinking than reasoned
legal analysis. Accordingly, there has been no clear error or manifest injustice in this Court’s
decision.
Plaintiffs similarly fail to demonstrate that the Court overlooked controlling facts in finding
that MP3tunes had reasonably implemented its repeat infringer policy. Plaintiffs parade the same
arguments and evidence that was previously before this Court, making the same mistakes in their
Motion for Reconsideration as they do in the summary judgment papers and demonstrating that
there are no circumstances warranting their a motion for reconsideration.

A.

Filed 09/23/11 Page 12 of 19

The Abundance of Case Law Supports the Courts’ Finding that MP3tunes
Reasonably Implemented a Repeat Infringer Policy

To qualify for safe harbor protection, section 512(i)(1)(A) requires that a service provider’s
repeat infringer policy provide for the termination of service for actual repeat infringers, and then
only in “appropriate circumstances.” See Perfect 10 v. CCBill, 488 F.3d 1102, 1109-1110 (9th Cir.
2007). “The statute permits service providers to implement a variety of procedures, but an
implementation is reasonable if, under ‘appropriate circumstances,’ the service provider terminates
users who repeatedly or blatantly infringe copyright.” Id. “The key term, ‘repeat infringer,’ is not
defined . . . . The fact that Congress chose not to adopt such specific provisions when defining a
user policy indicates its intent to leave the policy requirements, and the subsequent obligations of
the service providers, loosely defined.” UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Veoh Networks, Inc., 665 F. Supp.
2d 1099, at 1111 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (citations omitted).
As this court recognized, courts have expressly ruled on the issue of what constitutes
“reasonable implementation” holding that:
. . . implementation is reasonable if the service provider (1) has a
system for dealing with takedown notices, (2) does not interfere with
the copyright owner’s ability to issue notices, and (3) under
“appropriate circumstances, terminate users who repeatedly or
blatantly infringe copyrights.”
Order, Dkt. # 267, at 9 (citing Perfect 10 v. CCBill, 488 F.3d 1102, 1109-1110 (9th Cir. 2007).
Plaintiffs do not challenge the Court’s finding that MP3tunes has a system for dealing with
takedown notices, nor that MP3tunes does not interfere with the copyright owner’s ability to issue
notices. However, Plaintiffs accuse this Court of overlooking controlling law as to the third prong
of this test but fail to cite any controlling law allegedly overlooked by this Court. Because Plaintiffs
have failed to demonstrate that this Court overlooked any controlling law on this issue, their Motion
for Reconsideration should be denied.

The Weight of Authority Supports a Finding that the DMCA Does Not
Require Service Providers to Terminate the Accounts of Users Identified
in Multiple Take-Down Notice

Despite Plaintiffs’ allegations of error, the DMCA does not obligate service providers to
conduct an investigation to determine whether its users appear on multiple take-down notices.
Indeed, the weight of authority holds explicitly to the contrary: “To identify and terminate repeat
infringers, a service provider need not affirmatively police its users for evidence of repeat
infringement.” CCBill, 488 F.3d at 1111; Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 718 F. Supp. 2d 514,
520 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“a service provider need not affirmatively seek facts indicating infringing
activity in order to claim [this safe harbor].”); Io Group, Inc. v. Veoh Network, Inc., 586 F. Supp.
2d 1132, 1143 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (“512(i) does not require service providers to track users in a
particular way to or affirmatively police users for evidence of repeat infringement.”); see also UMG
Recordings, Inc. v. Veoh Networks Inc., 665 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1116 (C.D. 2009) (emphasizing that
the termination of users’ account is a drastic action that must be justified by reliable evidence).
Plaintiffs, having not presented any cases to the contrary, controlling or otherwise, cannot, with a
straight face, accuse this Court of overlooking controlling law.

2.

The Weight of Authority Supports a Finding that Subscribers Identified
in Take-Down Notices Are Not “Repeat Infringers”

Plaintiffs further err in concluding that a user identified in more than one take-down notice
is a “repeat infringer.” The weight of authority is unambiguous in holding that an appearance on a
take-down notice does not demonstrate that a user is an infringer—much less a blatant, repeat
infringer. See CCBill LLC, 488 F.3d at 1113 (holding that Perfect 10’s notices of infringement were
not evidence of infringement); Viacom, 718 F. Supp. 2d at 528 (explaining that “even DMCAcompliant notices did not, in themselves, provide evidence of blatant copyright infringement.”);
Corbis Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1105 (W.D. Wash. 2004) (DMCA
compliant take-down notices “did not, in themselves, provide evidence of blatant copyright
13

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

infringement.”); Rock River Communs., Inc. v. Universal Music Group, Inc., No. 8-635, 2011 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 46023, *42-43 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 27, 2011) (explaining that a take-down notice is a mere
allegation of infringement).
A leading treatise on copyright law, Nimmer on Copyright, also rejects Plaintiffs’ claim that
service providers are obligated to terminate users who appear on more than one take-down notice.
See 6 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 12.10[B][3][b] (2011) (“the
detailed process of notice refers to notifications of ‘claimed infringement,’ there by signaling that
notification by itself cannot prove actual infringement.”) (emphasis in the original). According to
Nimmer on Copyright, the standard for determining whether a user is an infringer requires a higher
degree of evidence than just mere identification in a take-down notice. Thus, “an infringer in the
statutory sense may be either a party who has been adjudicated to have committed copyright
infringement, or a party about whom the service provider has actual knowledge that s/he has
engaged in infringement.” Id. at § 12.10[B][3][c].
Accordingly, there is no clear error in this Court’s holding that MP3tunes has reasonably
implemented a repeat infringer policy even though it did not conduct an investigation to determine
which of its users appeared on multiple take-down notices and did not terminate the accounts of
such users.

Plaintiffs Improperly Attempt to Present New Arguments that Were Not
Before the Court at Summary Judgment

“[A] Motion for Reconsideration cannot assert new arguments or claims which were not
before the court on the original motion and consequently cannot be said to have been considered.”
Koehler v. Bank of Berm. Ltd., No. M18-302, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8694, at * 1-*2 (S.D.N.Y.
May 9, 2005) (citing Kunica v. St. Jean Financial, Inc., 63 F.Supp.2d 342, 346 (S.D.N.Y. 1999))
(rejecting motion that presented arguments not previously presented).

Plaintiffs attempt to add a new argument to their claim that the DMCA obligates service
providers to terminate the accounts of users found in more than one take-down notice. Plaintiffs
now argue that this Court erred in its distinquishing between “blatant infringers” who “know they
lack authorization and nevertheless upload content to the internet for the world to experience or
copy, and users who download content for their personal use and are otherwise oblivious to the
copyrights of others.” Order, Dkt. # 267 at 10. Plaintiffs, in a move wholly unfit for a Motion for
Reconsideration, claim this Court is wrong because knowledge is not an element of copyright
infringement. Plaintiffs’ new argument clearly proffers improper grounds for reconsideration and
should be denied.
Nevertheless, Plaintiffs’ new argument demonstrates that there was no error in this Court’s
decision. First, Plaintiffs misrepresent this Court’s decision when they claim that this Court
considered knowledge relevant as an element for infringement. This Court made no such holding.
Rather, the Court stated the following:
There is a difference between users who know they lack authorization
and nevertheless upload content to the internet for the world to
experience or copy, and users who download content for their
personal use and are otherwise oblivious to the copyrights of others.
The former are blatant infringers that internet service providers are
obligated to ban from their websites. The latter, like MP3tunes users
who sideload content to their lockers for personal use, do not know
for certain whether the material they are downloading violates the
copyrights of others.
See Order, Dkt. # 267 at 10.
The Court is clearly not asserting knowledge as an element of infringement but as an
element in determining whether or not the allegedly infringing activity of MP3tunes’ users
identified in a take-down notice was “blatant” and egregious enough to warrant the termination of
their accounts. While knowledge is certainly not an element of copyright infringement, knowledge
is certainly a relevant factor in a service provider’s determination of whether or not circumstances
termination of a user’s is appropriate.

Evidence in the Record Amply Demonstrates that MP3tunes Reasonably
Implemented a Repeat Infringer Policy

First, Plaintiffs’ claim that this Court has made an improper factual determination, again a
point suited for an appeal, not a Motion for Reconsideration, is simply inaccurate. Under Rule 56,
the Court may determine whether a genuine issue of fact remains for trail. See Anderson v. Liberty
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986) (holding that if the evidence advanced in opposition to a
motion for summary judgment “is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, then summary
judgment may be granted.”). Here, this Court has ruled that Plaintiffs have failed to show that there
is a sufficient factual dispute as to whether MP3tunes terminates, under appropriate circumstances,
the accounts of users who repeatedly or blatantly infringe copyrights. Plaintiffs claim that this
Court has made an improper factual determination is a gross mischaracterization of this Court’s
decision.
Plaintiffs’ claim that there was no basis in the record presented to this Court for such a
determination is in essence a repeat of the very same argument and evidence that was made, and
rejected, at summary judgment. See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion
of MP3tunes, LLC for Summary Judgment, Dkt. # 209 at 25-26. Unless Plaintiffs are accusing this
Court of not reading their motion papers, this Court properly considered these arguments and
dismissed them at summary judgment. Plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate the extraordinary
circumstances that would warrant this Court’s reconsideration of this issue. They fail to point to
any intervening changes of law, or new facts, clear error or manifest injustice which would justify
re-litigating these issues.
As demonstrated at summary judgment, the evidence that MP3tunes terminated 153 repeat
infringers was not contradicted by other testimony from Mr. Robertson. Mr. Robertson testified
that he could not remember the different types of conduct that had resulted in users having their

16

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP -FM Document 272

Filed 09/23/11 Page 17 of 19

accounts terminated, other than file sharing. See Dkt. # 196,2 Ex. 4, 195:2-25 (“Q. Okay, are you
aware, sitting here today, of any other reasons why accounts were terminated, other than that broad
category of---of sharing that you just talked about? A. Yes. I remember an incident where—there
was some incidents around some hate—hate group . . . .”) This testimony does not contradict Mr.
Robertson’s later testimony that MP3tunes had terminated 153 user accounts for copyright
infringement. Plaintiffs attempt to manufacture a contradiction by claiming that users who
distribute passwords to their MP3tunes lockers are not necessarily engaged in copyright
infringement. However, the point is MP3tunes understood the sharing of files as blatant and
repeated infringement and acted upon that understanding. Nothing in Mr. Robertson’s testimony
contradics that fact.
As demonstrated at summary judgment, the testimony of other MP3tunes witnesses in this
case does not contradict Mr. Robertson’s testimony. The fact that Julian Krause testified that he did
not attempt to determine whether infringers could be identified on multiple take-down notices does
not contradict the fact that MP3tunes terminated 153 users it suspected of file sharing. Nor is there
a factual dispute created by the testimony of Derek Ford, Sharmaine Lindahl, or Doug Reese. As
Mr. Ford testified, patrolling for copyright infringement was not in his job description. See Dkt.
#101, Ex. 101 at 99:23-100:19 (“Q. Did Michael ever instruct you that if you saw things that
appeared to be infringing on sideload.com, you should do something about it? . . . . A. I just
programmed.”). Similarly, the fact that Doug Reese, MP3tunes’ Chief Technology Officer, and
Sharmain Lindahl were not instructed to take action as to copyright infringement does not create a
factual dispute. As Sharmain Lindahl explained in the very excerpt quoted by Plaintiffs’ in their
Motion for Reconsideration: “That was not my job duties (sic) to deal with taking down music from
our site.” See Dkt. # 210, Ex. 103, 125:16-17. Nor would such work be the territory of the Chief

Plaintiffs’ mistakenly cite Exhibit 4 of Document Entry No. 210 when in fact the relevant
testimony is found in Exhibit 4 of Document Entry No. 198.

Technology Officer. Accordingly, the fact that these employees did not take action against
infringement does not create a factual dispute as to whether or not 153 user accounts were
terminated for sharing files.
Moreover, Plaintiffs absurdly claim that “Robertson’s declaration did not actually state that
the 153 users listed were terminated for suspected copyright infringement.” Dkt. # 269 at 19. To
the contrary, Mr. Robertson states: “MP3tunes has terminated the accounts of users whom it has
suspected of using MP3tunes’ services for the purposes of infringing activity. Attached hereto as
Exhibit D is a chart listing user accounts that were terminated for such reasons.” Dkt. # 184 at ¶ 11
(emphasis added). Plaintiffs convoluted reading of that statement does not create a dispute as to
whether or not MP3tunes terminated the accounts of 153 users for copyright infringement.
Plaintiffs have used the testimony of Mr. Robertson and other witnesses out of context in an
attempt to manufacture a contradiction where it does not exist, while ignoring testimony from
witnesses that demonstrates that MP3tunes clearly had a policy for terminating the accounts of
repeat infringers and user accounts were in fact terminated due to repeated infringement. See Dkt.
#189, Ex. W at 239:15-240:14) (Lindahl testifying to instance where a user account was terminated
for sharing content); Ex. V at 242:11-243:10) (MP3tunes employee Kendall Dawson testifying to
terminating a user account for file sharing). Accordingly, none of the testimony cited creates an
triable issue of fact.
In addition, Plaintiffs repeat their claim that MP3tunes was unable to determine the reasons
why it terminated user accounts, with a reference to an email displaying a chart that shows 88,642
disabled user accounts in which MP3tunes stated there is no way to tell why any given record was
set to “disabled” status. This argument has already been presented to this court, see Dkt. Entry #
209 at n. 11, and rejected. MP3tunes’ inability to state why those 88,642 user accounts were
terminated is irrelevant to whether or not MP3tunes was able to determine whether it terminated
153 users for file sharing.

Accordingly, this Court did not commit an error, much less a clear error, when it held that
MP3tunes terminated the accounts of users for copyright infringement.

CONCLUSION
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration should be denied in all respects.
