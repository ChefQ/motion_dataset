IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
BRENDAN DASSEY,
Petitioner,
v.

Case No. 14-CV-1310

BRIAN FOSTER,Warden,
Green Bay Correctional Institution,
Respondent.
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE ANSWER AND TO FILE BRIEF
Brian Foster, Warden, Green Bay Correctional Institution, moves this
Court for an extension of time in which to file a response to Petitioner
Brendan Dassey’s petition for writ of habeas corpus and to file a brief on the
merits. Foster requests a due date for the response of February 11, 2015.
Foster requests an additional thirty days, until March 13, 2015, in which to
file a brief in support. The reasons for this motion follow.
1. Foster is currently represented in the above matter by Assistant
Attorney General Warren D. Weinstein. The Court has issued a Rule 4 Order,
Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Court,
requiring Foster to respond on January 12, 2015, sixty days from the date of

Case 1:14-cv-01310-WED Filed 01/07/15 Page 1 of 4 Document 11

the Rule 4 Order. Dkt. 6:2. The order additionally required Foster to submit
any brief in opposition to the petition with the response. Dkt. 6:2.
2.

On December 22, 2014, AAG Weinstein was diagnosed with

coronary artery disease requiring surgery. As a result, AAG Weinstein will
begin an extended medical leave on January 9, 2015. AAG Weinstein
currently expects to return from medical leave in early April.
3.

The Department of Justice transferred the case to Assistant

Attorney General Jacob Wittwer on January 5, 2015. AAG Wittwer will be
filing a notice of appearance with this motion. AAG Wittwer has an oral
argument in the Wisconsin Supreme Court in State v. Joel M. Hurley, Case
No. 2013AP0558-CR on January 8, 2015.
4. In addition, Dassey’s petition attacks the state court judgment of
conviction consisting of a nine-day trial totaling over 1,600 pages of
transcripts and a five-day post-conviction motion hearing totaling over 1,300
pages of transcripts. The amount of time to electronically scan these large
transcripts plus the lengthy briefs in the state court place a substantial
burden on the department’s secretarial staff which just lost two of its total
eight personnel to retirement.
5. Dassey raises two issues. First he argues his pre-trial attorney had a
conflict of interest because he did not act in defendant’s best interest and

-2Case 1:14-cv-01310-WED Filed 01/07/15 Page 2 of 4 Document 11

thus provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Second, he argues his
confession is not voluntary because of his suggestibility to police questioning.
Because AAG Weinstein read the state court record and briefed the case in
the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, AAG Wittwer will have to familiarize
himself with the state court record, the cases Dassey relies upon, and the
cases the State cited in the state court, as well as review the three hour video
recording of Dassey’s confession. AAG Wittwer also has response briefs due
in five cases in the Wisconsin Court of Appeals during the month of January,
and answers to two habeas petitions due in the Eastern District court in
Daniel Jackson v. Brian Foster, No. 14-C-1254, on January 21, 2015 (on first
extension), and Antonio Jackson v. Gary Boughton, 14-C-1359, on February 2,
2015 (on second extension). For these reasons, it is not feasible for AAG
Wittwer to submit a merits brief with Foster’s response.

THEREFORE, for the above reasons, Foster respectfully requests the
Court grant an extension to February 11, 2015, for Foster to file his response
and an extension to March 13, 2015, in which to file a brief in support.
Dated at Madison, Wisconsin, this 7th day of January, 2015.
