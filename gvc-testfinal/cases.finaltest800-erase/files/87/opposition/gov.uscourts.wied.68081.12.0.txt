BRENDAN DASSEY,
Petitioner,
v.
BRIAN FOSTER, Warden,
Green Bay Correctional Center,
Respondent.

No. 14-cv-1310

RESPONSE TO RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR
EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE ANSWER AND TO FILE BRIEF

Petitioner Brendan Dassey, by counsel, respectfully submits the following Response to
the Respondent’s Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer and to File Brief:
1. On October 20, 2014, Petitioner Brendan Dassey filed a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus raising two grounds for relief: the ineffective assistance of his pre-trial attorney,
who acted to harm Mr. Dassey’s defense, and the involuntariness of Mr. Dassey’s
confession during police interrogation.
2. On November 12, 2014, this Court issued a Rule 4 scheduling order setting January 12,
2015 as the date by which Respondent’s answer or motion to dismiss was due and
granting Mr. Dassey 28 days from the date of Respondent’s filing to submit a brief in
response.

3. On January 7, 2015, undersigned counsel received notice via the ECF system that counsel
for Respondent had filed a motion requesting an extension of time to file his response and
additional time to file a brief in support.
4. Petitioner does not oppose Respondent’s request for these extensions of time.
5. Petitioner simply asks that this Court reissue its scheduling order so as to clarify that Mr.

Respectfully submitted this 7th day of January, 2015.
