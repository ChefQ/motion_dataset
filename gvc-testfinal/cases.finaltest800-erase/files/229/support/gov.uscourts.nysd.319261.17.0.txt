Rodolfo Morel, who reported directly to Abreu, actively managed the company including hiring
and firing employees, controlling the terms and conditions of their employment, and determining
the rate and method their compensation. Complaint, ¶¶ 1-3; 10-66, 68; Abreu depo., pp. 6-10;
14-34; 36-40; 47-53; 55, 58-63; 101-105.
10.

The plaintiffs and other prospective class members were employed by the

defendants as parking garage attendants for various periods of time from 1988 to August, 2007.
This action was commenced on January 14, 2008. Accordingly, the plaintiffs seek collective
action certification on the FLSA claims as to all workers employed as parking garage attendants
by the defendants from January 14, 2005 to the present, and Rule 23 class action certification on
the New York Labor Law claims from January 14, 2002 to the present.
11.

The moving affidavits and deposition testimony establish that the plaintiffs and

other parking garage attendants were subjected to a common set of employment policies and
practices by the defendants.
•

The attendants’ common duties included interacting with customers and parking
and returning the customers’ cars. They were also required to keep the garage
and the pavement outside the garage clean. Dante Canela aff., ¶ 5; Collado aff., ¶
8; Cruz aff., ¶ 5; Alcantara aff., ¶ 5; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶ 5; Concepcion aff., ¶ 5;
De La Rosa aff., ¶ 5; Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶ 51; Abreu depo., pp. 67-68.

•

They regularly worked 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week, without being
paid the required minimum wage and overtime. Complaint, ¶ 75; Dante Canela
aff., ¶¶ 6-8; Collado aff., ¶¶ 9-10; Cruz aff., ¶¶ 6-9, 14; Alcantara aff., ¶¶ 6-7, 13;
Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 7-9, 14; Concepcion aff., ¶¶7, 11; De La Rosa aff., ¶¶ 7-82;
Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 7, 16; Abreu depo., pp. 82-83.

Plaintiff Alcantara was also assigned to deal with unhappy customers whose cars
were damaged or who had other issues; and to perform handyman duties such as painting the
garage and repairing gates and elevators. Starting in November 2004 he was also responsible for
collecting envelopes from the garages and bringing them to the CNA office. Alcantara aff., ¶ 5;
Alcantara depo., pp. 12-16.

Starting in 2007, De La Rosa and plaintiff Dante Canela worked eight-hour shifts,
four or five days a week. De La Rosa aff., ¶ : Dante Canela aff., ¶ 10.

•

The defendants paid the workers partly or entirely in cash, and did not keep
accurate timesheets and payroll records, in violation of the FLSA and New York
law. This enabled the defendants to misrepresent the actual number of hours the
attendants worked and thus to avoid paying them the required minimum wage and
overtime. Although the attendants regularly worked 72 or more hours per week,
generally the paychecks reflected 40 hours of work a week, with a minimal
number of “overtime” hours at time and a half. Complaint, ¶¶ 70-80; Dante
Canela aff., ¶¶ 11-18; Collado aff., ¶¶ 11-19; Cruz aff., ¶¶ 10-22; Alcantara aff.,
¶¶ 11-17; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶ 11-17; Concepcion aff., ¶ 9-14; De La Rosa aff.,
¶¶ 12-17; Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 13-20.

•

This practice also enabled the defendants to evade paying spread-of-hours pay as
it usually reduced the reported hours below 10 a day. Complaint, ¶ 81 ; Dante
Canela aff., ¶ 23; Collado aff., ¶19; Cruz aff., ¶22; Alcantara aff., ¶ 20; Juan
Gonzalez aff., ¶ 20; Concepcion aff., ¶ 17; De La Rosa aff., ¶ 25; Victor Gonzalez
aff., ¶ 24.

•

The defendants also failed to post required notices or otherwise provide the
attendants with information concerning the minimum wage and overtime
requirements under the FLSA and New York law. Complaint, ¶¶ 72, 77, 85;
Dante Canela aff., ¶ 33 ; Collado aff., ¶¶ 36-37; Cruz aff., ¶¶ 36-37; Alcantara
aff., ¶ 34-35; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 33-34 ; Concepcion aff., ¶¶ 31.32 ; De La
Rosa aff., ¶¶ 36-37 ; Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 34-35.

•

The attendants were regularly denied meal and other break time. The defendants
prohibited the attendants from leaving the parking lot unattended, and as a result
the attendants were often required to work their entire 12-hour shifts without
receiving a meal break. They were allowed neither a thirty-minute break for
lunch, nor an additional 20 minute break between 5 P.M. and 7 P.M. for those
employed on a shift starting before 11 A.M. and continuing after 7 P.M., as
required by Nevertheless, the defendants regularly deducted meal and break time
from Plaintiffs’ hours. Complaint, ¶¶ 83-84; Dante Canela aff., ¶¶ 25-27; Collado
aff., ¶¶ 25-28; Cruz aff., ¶ 24-26; Alcantara aff., ¶¶ 22-23; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶¶
22-23; Concepcion aff., ¶¶ 19-20; De La Rosa aff., ¶¶ 27-29; Victor Gonzalez
aff., ¶¶ 26-28.

•

The defendants regularly made unlawful deductions from the plaintiffs’ pay, for
damage to vehicles, money missing from the cash register, or money which
management said should have been collected from customers. Complaint, ¶¶ 8789; Collado aff., ¶¶ 29-31; Cruz aff., ¶¶ 27-29; Alcantara aff., ¶¶ 24-26; Juan
Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 24-26; Concepcion aff., ¶¶ 21-24; De La Rosa aff., ¶¶ 18-21;
Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 10-12.

•

The defendants failed to inform the attendants whether the occasional tips the
attendants received would be counted towards their compensation, and failed to
provide an accounting of their tips. Dante Canela aff., ¶ 24; Collado aff., ¶ 20;
Cruz aff., ¶ 23; Alcantara aff., ¶ 21; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶ 21; Concepcion aff., ¶
18; De La Rosa aff., ¶ 26; Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶ 25.

When the workers complained to Morel that they were being paid less than their
lawful pay, Morel took no action, except to rebuff their complaints with
comments such as that the owner, Abreu, “would get back to them,” which did
not happen, or that they should look for another job because other workers could
be found to replace them, or other excuses. Dante Canela aff., ¶¶ 19-22; Collado
aff., ¶¶ 22-24; Alcantara aff., ¶¶ 18-19; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 21; Concepcion
aff., ¶ 15-16; De La Rosa aff., ¶ 22-24; Victor Gonzalez aff., ¶ 21-23.

•

There are many other workers besides the named plaintiffs who were employed
by the defendants as parking attendants. They had the same responsibilities;
worked the same schedule or hours, or both; and reported to the same manager,
Morel. The plaintiffs and their coworkers who have submitted affidavits are are
aware of and spoke with other employees in the same situation, and they
specifically name at least 27 of these other workers, In addition, there was a high
turnover rate among employees, and so the actual number of prospective class
members may be even higher. Dante Canela aff., ¶¶ 28-32; Collado aff., ¶¶ 3235; Cruz aff., ¶¶ 30-35; Alcantara aff., ¶¶ 27-33; Juan Gonzalez aff., ¶¶ 27-32;
Concepcion aff., ¶¶ 25-30; DeLaRosa aff.,¶¶ 30-35; Victor Gonzalez aff.,¶¶ 2933. See also Juan Gonzalez depo., pp. 22-23, 26-29, 31-32, 35-37; Jose Alcantara
depo., pp. 12-16, 27-28, 41, 46-47, 60.

Exhibit N is the affirmation of Richard F. Bernstein pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.

23(g)(1).
13.

I have represented the plaintiffs in at least 50 actions under the FLSA and New

York Labor Law and regulations. Among the cases I have brought, two have been certified as
collective actions under the FLSA, and I am currently seeking certification of an FLSA
collective action, a Rule 23 class action, or both, in seven other cases. In the present action, the
work I have done in identifying and investigating potential claims includes factual investigation,
including meeting and conferring with clients and reviewing their documents; communication
with opposing counsel concerning discovery responses; research and other preparation for and
attendance at depositions of two plaintiffs and of defendant Abreu; and meeting and
communication with plaintiffs and witnesses to prepare affidavits for the present motion. The
resources that my firm will commit to representing the class include: conducting all aspects of
the litigation, on a contingent fee basis, and advancing costs and expenses of the litigation. Costs

court if the plaintiffs prevail.

motion in its entirety.
