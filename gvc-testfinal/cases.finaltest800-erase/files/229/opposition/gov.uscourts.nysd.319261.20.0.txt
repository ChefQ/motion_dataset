LAW IN OPPOSITION
Plaintiffs, | TO PLAINTIFFS'
MOTION FOR CLASS
-against- CERTIFICATION
(FILED VIA ECF)
CNA MANAGEMENT, INC., and CESAR ABREU,
Defendant.
INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs are a group of former employees of Defendant CNA Management, who allege
to have worked as parking attendants at various parking garages operated by CNA Management
in Harlem and the Bronx. On or about January 14, 2008, Plaintiffs commenced the instant action
alleging underpayment of wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act and various provisions of
the New York Labor Law. Plaintiffs now move for an order: a) permitting them to send a Notice
of Pendency of their Fair Labor Standards Act claims to other "similarly situated" workers under
29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b); and b) granting class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.

Initially, Defendants concede that a Notice of Pendency under 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b) is proper,

 
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 2 of 17

although the proposed Noticed of Pendency submitted as Exhibit B to Plaintiffs' Affirmation in
Support! is improper as currently drafted.

However, Plaintiffs have clearly failed to establish, as a matter of law, their entitlement to
certification of a class under F.R.C.P. Rule 23. Particularly, Plaintiffs have indisputably failed to
satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)-1 ("the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable") and Rule 23(a)-4 ("the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect
the interests of the class"). Under Rule 23(a)-1, a class must ordinarily consist of at least forty
members in order to satisfy the "numerosity" requirement (Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931,
935 (2d Cir 1993)). Here, Plaintiffs' collective submissions fail, on their face, to even allege the
existence of forty or more potential class members, and Plaintiffs' counsel fails to address the
fact that their firm has represented no less than twenty five former employees who have settled
and released their claims against Defendants, and thus could not be members of any proposed
class. Further, Plaintiffs have failed to even allege, let alone establish, that the proposed class
representatives would "fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class." For these reasons,
Plaintiffs' motion for certification of a Rule 23 class must fail.

POINT I:
DEFENDANTS CONCEDE THAT DEFENDANTS' REQUEST FOR COURT-

APPROVED NOTICE OF PENDENCY PURSUANT TO 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b) SHOULD BE
GRANTED

While Defendants deny the factual allegations forming the basis of Plaintiffs' Complaint
and substantive requests for relief, Defendants concede that, at this stage, Plaintiffs' request for

collective action certification under 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b) is proper. Under that provision, workers

 

' References are made to the following documents: Affirmation of Michael Faillace of December 1, 2008, in support
of Plaintiffs' instant motion (the "Affirmation in Support'); Memorandum of Law of Michael Faillace of December
1, 2008 (the "Memorandum in Support"); Declaration of James Emmet Murphy of December 31, 2008, in
Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion (the "Murphy Declaration").

may maintain an action against an employer "for and in [sic] behalf of... themselves and other
employees similarly situated," and Plaintiffs need only make an exceedingly limited showing in
order to have the Court approve a notice of pendency of such an action to other employees. In
order to obtain Court-approved notice to other similarly situated workers under a 216(b)
"collective action," "the court will look at the pleadings and affidavits. If the plaintiff satisfies
the minimal burden of showing that the similarly situated requirement is met, the court certifies
the class as a collective action." (Iiglesias-Mendoza v. La Belle Farm, Inc., 239 F.R.D. 363
(S.D.N.Y. 2007) (internal punctuation omitted)).

In approving the issuance of a notice of pendency under 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b), "the court
does not resolve factual disputes, decide substantive issues going to the ulttmate merits, or make
credibility determinations." (Lynch v. United Services Automobile Association, 491 F.Supp.2d
357 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)). As such, the Court need not inquire into the merits of Plaintiffs'
allegations - which, again, Defendants vigorously dispute - but rather need look only to the
pleadings and affidavits (see Iglesias-Mendoza, supra, 239 F.R.D. 363 (S8.D.N.Y. 2007)). Since
"t]he burden for demonstrating that potential plaintiffs are `similarly situated' is very low at the
notice stage," (Lynch, supra, 491 F.Supp.2d at 368 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)), and since Defendants
concede that Plaintiffs' pleadings and affidavits establish, on their face and without inquiry into
their merits, the existence of other "similarly situated" individuals, Plaintiffs' request for Court
approval of a notice of pendency of this action to other employees of Defendants is proper.
However, as will be discussed further in Point IJ, infra, Plaintiffs' proposed notice to the class

members is improper, and should not be approved in its current form.

POINT II:
PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION UNDER FRCP RULE 23
MUST BE DENIED

While Plaintiffs may proceed with their Fair Labor Standards Act claims as a "collective
action" under 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b), individual workers must affirmatively consent, or "opt-in," in
order to participate in such an action. See generally Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling, 493
U.S. 165 (1989) (an individual may become a party plaintiff in a collective action only if he

+39

files with the court his `consent in writing'"). As such, certification of a Rule 23 class action, or
"opt-out" action, cannot be had for Plaintiffs' claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act. In
addition for moving for conditional certification of a 0x00A7 216(b) collective action on their claims
under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Plaintiffs now move for certification of a Rule 23 class
action for their overtime and related claims under New York State Law". For a variety of
reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for Rule 23 class certification must be denied.

In order for the Court to certify a class action under FRCP Rule 23, Plaintiffs must
establish all of the elements of FRCP Rule 23(a), and at least one of the elements of FRCP Rule
23(b). Of the four required elements for class certification under Rule 23(a) - that the class be so
numerous that joinder of all members is impracticabie ("numerosity"), that there be questions of
law or fact common to the class ("commonality"), that the claims or defenses of the

representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class ("typicality"), and that the

representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class ("adequacy of

 

? While Plaintiffs' Complaint requests liquidated damages on their New York Labor Law claims (see Affirmation in
Support, p. 18, 0x00A7 J), it is clear that this relief cannot be sought by Plaintiffs in the context of a class-action litigation.
Under New York Civil Practice Law and Rules 0x00A7 901(b), no statutory cause of action assessing liquidated damages
may be brought as a class action, and Federal Courts applying New York law have routinely refused to certify
classes on this basis (see Dornberger v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 182 F.R.D. 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)). In
order to maintain a class action under the New York Labor Law, any claim for liquidated damages must be waived
(see Brzychychnalski v. Unesco, Inc., 35 F.Supp.2d 351 ($.D.N.yen. 1999)).

4

 
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 5 of 17

representation") - Plaintiffs have unquestionably failed to meet at least two. Plaintiffs' showing
of numerosity is clearly insufficient to establish that a group of putative class members exists
which is sufficiently large so that joinder is impracticable as required under controlling caselaw,
and Plaintiffs have utterly failed to even allege - much less prove - that the proposed class
representatives will adequately protect the interests of the class. As such, regardless of Plaintiffs'
allegations regarding the remaining prerequisites for class action certification, Plaintiffs' motion
for Rule 23 class certification must be denied.
A. Numerosity
Rule 23(a)-1 requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all class members is

impracticable. While Courts have held that "impracticability for purposes of Rule 23 class
certification does not mean impossibility," Iglesias-Mendoza v. La Belle Farm, Inc., 239 F.R.D.
363, 370 (S.D.N.Y. 2007), some evidentiary showing of impracticability must be made. There is
no requirement that the exact number of class members be immediately known. As stated by the
Court in Velez, supra:

"Although a plaintiff need not present a precise calculation of the

number of class members and it is permissible for the court to rely

on reasonable inferences drawn from available facts, the movant

"must show some evidence of or reasonably estimate the number of

class members.*"

Velez _v. Majik Cleaning Service, Inc., 2005 WL 106895 *2
(S.D.N.Y. January 19, 2005)

It is fundamental that there must be some evidence of the class size alleged by Plaintiffs.
"Where the plaintiff's assertion of numerosity is pure speculation or bare allegations, the motion
for class certification fails." Edge v. C. Tech Collections, Inc., 203 F.R.D. 85 (E.D.N.Y. 2001).
Indeed, when Plaintiffs' evidence of numerosity consists, as here, of nothing more than blanket
assertions, the motion for class certification must fail regardless of the sufficiency of other Rule

5

 
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 6 of 17

23 factors (Lewis v. National Financial Systems, Inc., 2007 WL 2455130 (E.D.N.Y. August 23,
2007)). The usual minimum number of class members required for a showing of impracticability
of joinder is forty. Velez, 2005 WL 106895 *2. Here, Plaintiffs have offered nothing more than
"pure speculation [and] bare allegations" in attempting to establish the existence of more than
forty prospective class members, and Plaintiffs' motion for class certification must be denied.

Defendants submit eight documents purporting to be affidavits of former employees of
Defendants in support of their instant motion; although Bolivar Canela is an individual named in
Plaintiffs' Complaint, and presumably is a proposed class representative, he has not submitted an
affidavit in support of Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. One of the individual affiants,
Octavio Concepcion (Affirmation in Support, Ex. 1), specifically admits that he does not have a
claim against Defendants - Mr. Concepcion claims to have worked for Defendants between May
2000 and December 2001. Under New York Labor Law 0x00A7 198-3, an action to collect unpaid
overtime or other wages under New York law must be commenced within six years; as this
action was filed on January 14, 2008 (see Affirmation in Support, Ex. A (Complaint in the
instant action)), Mr. Concepcion's claims are untimely,

No Plaintiff claims to have worked with, or met during the course of their employment,
more than 20 other potential putative class members (see generally Affidavit of Dante Canella,
Affirmation in Support Ex. C (met 15-20 other employees during the nine year period he worked

for the company, between 1999 and 2008); Affidavit of Freddy Cruz, Affirmation in Support Ex.
F (met "at least twenty" other workers during three years working for Defendant); Affidavit of
Juan Gonzalez, Affirmation in Support Ex. G (met "at least twenty" other workers during three

years working for Defendant)), Similarly, during the deposition of proposed class representative

 
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 7 of 17

Juan Gonzalez, Mr. Gonzalez recalled working with only "approximately twenty" other workers
during his time with the company. (Murphy Declaration, Ex. C, p. 27:3-20).

Of particular significance is the affidavit of Plaintiff and proposed class representative
Jose Alcantara, who worked for Defendants for over eight years (Murphy Declaration, Ex. B at
p. 7:15-20). During Mr. Alcantara's deposition, he testified that his job included, between 2004
and 2007, daily visits to each of the parking garages operated by Defendants, seven days per
week (Murphy Declaration, Ex. B, at pp. 15:21- 16:5), presumably allowing him to meet each
worker who worked for Defendants during this period. And yet, Mr. Alcantara, in his Affidavit
submitted with Plaintiffs' motion papers as Exhibit G to the Affirmation of Michael Faillace, can
only recall meeting "at least fifteen" coworkers during his eight year tenure with Defendants
(Alcantara Affidavit, ] 27), and can only recali the names of six of them (Alcantara Affidavit, 1
30, 31). At his deposition, Mr. Alcantara specifically testified that he had "no idea" how many
parking attendants worked for Defendants during the time period at issue (Murphy Declaration,
Ex. B, pp. 38:17- 39:3), and "no idea" how much any of them were paid (Murphy Declaration,
Ex. B, p. 39:4-6). Owing to Mr. Alcantara's long tenure with Defendants, and his job duties,
which included, by his own admission, visiting each of the job sites every day for several years
(Murphy Declaration, Ex. B, p. 16:2-5), the fact that he can only recall meeting "at least fifteen"
other employees of Defendants casts serious doubt on Plaintiffs' allegations that "the class
members are sufficiently numerous to warrant class certification" (Memorandum in Support, p.
8).

It is important to note that nowhere in Plaintiffs' motion papers is it alleged that a
putative class of more than 40 people exists, other than the blanket, unsupported assertion in

Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law that "Particularly given the high rate of turnover, the

7
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 8 of 17

prospective class easily includes more than 40 members." (Memorandum in Support, p. 8).
When faced with a largely identical allegation on a motion to certify a class under New York
overtime law - "Plaintiffs' memorandum merely states that `[t]he precise number of such persons
is unknown (although it is suspected that the number exceeds 40 people)'" - Courts have
specifically decline to address any other Rule 23 factors, holding that "Plaintiffs' having failed to
satisfy the first requirement under Rule 23(a), the Court need go no further." (Lewis, supra, 2007
WL 2455130 * 8 (E.D.N.Y. August 23, 2007)). As Plaintiffs here have offered only speculation
that the size of the proposed class could exceed 40 individuals, Plaintiffs' motion must be
denied.

Further, none of Plaintiffs' papers mention the fact that numerous former employees of
Defendants, including many of the employees Plaintiffs name in their affidavits as allegedly
having been aggrieved, have settled wage claims with Defendants and executed releases for
same'. Jose Luis Robles, named in six of the Affidavits submitted by Plaintiffs here, previously
had his claims for unpaid overtime wages settled with the New York State Department of Labor
(Murphy Declaration, Ex. D), and would thus be barred by res judicata and release from
becoming a class member in this putative class action. Plaintiffs' counsel has twice before
represented workers in actions against Defendants here, which were settled and discontinued;
those workers are similarly barred from being part of this class, as their claims have been
released in prior settlements. (Murphy Declaration, Exs. E, F, G). In the action entitled Alvarez
v. 3795 10th Avenue Parking Corp., (Murphy Declaration, Ex. E), Plaintiffs' counsel settled the

claims of Pedro Hernandez and William Lantigua - each of whom is named as a potential class

 

* As Defendant Cesar Abreu testified during his deposition, as a result of prior litigation instituted by counsel to the
Plaintiffs herein, Defendants' payroll practices changed subsequent to a prior lawsuit brought against Defendant
Cesar Abreu by Plaintiffs' current counsel. (Murphy Declaration, Ex. A, at p. 78:14-22).

8
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 9 of 17

member by Plaintiffs. In a separate action entitled Cepeda v. Easy Way Parking, Plaintiffs'
counsel settled the claims of twenty one (21) former employees of Defendants (Murphy
Declaration, Exs. F, G) - including Wilfredo Tavares, Jose Fernandez, Guarionex Santos, and
Christian Santos, each of whom was named as a potential putative class member in Plaintiffs'
proffered affidavits. A brief summary of the workers named in Plaintiffs' proffered affidavits

whose claims have already been settled follows herein:

Guirionex Santos Cepeda v. Easy Way Parking G

In short: none of the Plaintiffs and potential Class Representatives alleges to have worked
with more than 20 other individuals who might potentially be aggrieved employees. Plaintiffs
allege that there are nine former employees of Defendants who have are either named Plaintiffs
or who have submitted affidavits, and twenty-seven others whom they have named specifically
(see Memorandum in Support, p. 8). Even assuming each and every one of these individuals is a
putative class member, this total fails short of the level of forty usually required to certify a class
(Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir 1993)). However, one of the affiants, Octavio
Concepcion, by his own admission, has no timely claim against Defendants (and is the only
affiant who remembers working with an "Esmeraldo," who worked with Mr. Concepcion outside

of the time period covered by this action); and seven of the individuals named by Plaintiffs have

9
Case 1:08-cv-00291-MHD Document 20 Filed 12/31/08 Page 10 of 17

already settled and released their claims against Defendants and thus could not be members of
the putative class, While Plaintiffs claim that the putative class size must be larger than forty
"[pjarticularly given the high rate of turnover," (Memorandum in Support, p. 8), none of the
affiants, despite some having worked for Defendants for nearly a decade, could recall working
with more than approximately twenty other individuals - and, of course, those numbers already
reflect this alleged "high rate of turnover."

Twenty-one former employees of Defendants settled their claims against Defendants in
June of 2003; four more settled their claims against Defendants in September of 2005. Plaintiffs'
counsel, and proposed class counsel for the putative class, is weil aware of these settlements, as
he represented Plaintiffs in those actions (Murphy Declaration, Exs. E, F, G). Jose Alcantara,
who was in the best possible position to estimate the potential size of the class, due to his job
duties which required him to travel to each of Defendants' locations each day (Murphy
Declaration, Ex. B, at pp. 15:21- 16:5), estimated the number of workers he met to be "at least
i5." (Alcantara Affidavit, (27). As Defendant Cesar Abreu has testified, his business has grown
smaller over time (Murphy Declaration, Ex. A, pp. 16-18), subsequent to the settlement of claims
by former employees of Defendants. Contrary to Plaintiffs' allegations, there are simply not
enough putative class members to warrant class certification, and Plaintiffs' motion for
certification of a Rule 23 class must be denied.
B. Adequacy of Representation

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4), "Both class representatives and class
counsel have responsibilities to absent members of the class. Under Rule 23, the court cannot
properly certify the action to proceed as a class action unless it is satisfied that the representative

plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class." (Maywalt v. Parker &
