POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

AS 23.30.140(b) provides in pertinent part:
(b) If the employment is terminated, all wages,
salaries, or other compensation for labor or services
become due immediately and shall be paid within the
time required by this subsection at the place where
the employee is usually paid or at a location agreed
upon by the employer and employee. If the employment
is terminated by the employer, regardless of the cause
for the termination, payment is due within three
working days after the termination. If the employment
is terminated by the employee, payment is due at the
next regular pay day that is at least three days after
the employer received notice of the employee's
termination of services . . .
(d) If an employer violates (b) of this section by
failing to pay within the time required by that
subsection, the employer may be required to pay the
employee a penalty in the amount of the employee's
regular wage, salary, or other compensation from the
time of demand to the time of payment, or for 90
working
days,
whichever
is
the
lesser
amount.
(Emphasis added)
The award of a penalty under section (d) is not mandatory, and is
within the sound discretion of the trial court.

Exhibit A, attachment 1.

It is important to note that in Gilbert’s motion, he does
not offer an amount of penalties APC should be required to pay.
AS 23.05.140(d) clearly defines the amount of any penalty as the
employee’s “regular wage, salary, or other compensation from the
time of demand to the time of payment, or for 90 working days,
whichever is the lesser amount.”

That Gilbert does not offer a

proposed penalty demonstrates that the calculation of overtime
is not straightforward.

Gilbert suggests that paying overtime

once he made a demand should have been as easy as cutting a
check. To the contrary, the parties’ briefing on the calculation
of overtime and the applicable statute of limitations, as well
as Gilbert’s own failure to calculate overtime, demonstrate that
getting to the final dollar amount owed required significant
analysis and, as a consequence, time.

Even today, there is not

an agreement of the amount that was paid was a proper resolution
of the issue.
