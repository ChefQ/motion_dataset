(Judge Marian Blank Horn)

IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS

CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY
OF NEW YORK, INC. & SUBSIDIARIES
Plaintiff
v.
THE UNITED STATES,
Defendant

DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO COMPEL

Pursuant to RCFC 37(a)(2)(B), the United States moves this Court to compel Plaintiff to
produce the documents withheld from Plaintiff’s response to the United States’ Requests for
Production of Documents. The parties dispute whether the attorney-client privilege applies or
has been waived. Counsel for the United States discussed the issues with Plaintiff’s counsel in
correspondence and by telephone in a good faith effort to resolve the matter, but was
unsuccessful. The Court’s assistance is essential, and Defendant submits the following in
support of its motion:
QUESTIONS PRESENTED
1.

Whether Defendant is entitled to the final opinion letters of Plaintiff’s outside
counsel and supporting and related documents concerning the LILO Transaction
because the documents lack the requisite confidentiality for the attorney-client

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Document 21

Filed 04/03/2007

Page 7 of 35

privilege to apply, because Plaintiff intended to provide and did provide the final
opinion letters to a third-party.
2.

Whether Plaintiff waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to twenty-nine
documents identified on its privilege log (and any objection to defendant’s
present use of the documents) by producing them to the IRS in unredacted form
during audit and to Defendant in the course of discovery.

3.

Whether there has been a subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to legal advice by Plaintiff’s outside and in-house counsel
concerning the LILO Transaction, because Plaintiff produced documents on audit
and during discovery that contain information similar to or on the same subject
matter.
INTRODUCTION

As to some of the documents or information defendant is seeking, Plaintiff previously
disclosed earlier drafts or similar information to Defendant and other third parties. Therefore
either the privilege does not attach to the withheld documents or information, or the privilege has
been waived by Plaintiff’s conduct.
As to other information, Plaintiff actually produced it at some point in this litigation, but
now claims that it is privileged. While Defendant obviously already has this information, it is
included in this motion, because Defendant wishes to use it in upcoming depositions; but,
Plaintiff has indicated it will continue to assert a privilege, and Defendant’s discovery will be
frustrated without relief.
On its Revised December 13, 2006 Privilege Log (attached as Exhibit A-21), Plaintiff

1

All exhibits referred to in this motion are attached to the Declaration of David N. Geier,
filed concurrently. Where Plaintiff has produced multiple copies or versions of a document it
claims as privileged, Defendant has not attached each copy or version as an exhibit. Instead,
Defendant cites an exhibit that is an instance of the document to discuss its substance and, for
completeness, simply references the bates numbers for each additional version or copy. Of
course, if the Court so desires, Defendant will be happy to provide all copies and versions of
documents produced by Plaintiff during discovery.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

Background – The LILO Transaction

This case involves the proper tax treatment to be accorded Plaintiff’s LILO shelter
transaction. Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. & Subsidiaries (“Con Ed” or
“Plaintiff”) participated in a lease-in/lease-out (“LILO”) shelter transaction involving a power
station (the “RoCa3” facility owned by South Holland Electric (N.V. Electriciteitsbedrifj ZuidHolland) (hereinafter “EZH”)) located in the Netherlands (hereinafter the “LILO Transaction”).
Plaintiff, a United States taxpayer, through a subsidiary, purported to lease property from its
owner, EZH, under a head lease and simultaneously purported to lease the property back to EZH
under a sublease. As is typical in a LILO transaction, the counter-party, EZH, is an entity, in this
case a foreign corporation, that is not subject to federal income taxation, and therefore is unable
5

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Document 21

Filed 04/03/2007

Page 11 of 35

to claim federal income tax benefits, like depreciation, associated with ownership of the RoCa3
facility. Plaintiff claimed very substantial rent and interest deductions associated with the
purported head lease, very little lease income, and therefore large amounts of income from other
sources were sheltered from tax. Despite the execution of paperwork, EZH or its successors
continued to operate the property as before and retained all of the benefits and burdens
associated with the property’s use and ownership. The general issue raised in this refund suit is
whether Plaintiff is entitled in 1997 to deduct rent, interest, and transaction costs in connection
with the LILO Transaction.
Defendant contends that the tax deductions Plaintiff claimed are improper for several
reasons. Plaintiff did not acquire a genuine leasehold interest in property in 1997 when it
participated in the LILO Transaction. Plaintiff also did not incur a genuine debt obligation for
which it is entitled to claim tax deductions. Perhaps most important for the purposes of this
motion to compel, Defendant contends that the LILO Transaction should be disregarded under
the economic substance doctrine, which requires, among other inquiries, that the Court examine
Plaintiff’s motivation for engaging in the LILO Transaction.
B.

Plaintiff’s Production of Documents

1.

Documents Produced to the Internal Revenue Service During Audit

Plaintiff produced information to the IRS in connection with the audit of its 1997 tax
year. This material, which was included in the IRS’s administrative files, was then delivered to
the Department of Justice to help defend this case. The same material was then produced to
Plaintiff in electronic format on or about September 25, 2006, as part of Defendant’s initial
disclosures.

6

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Document 21

Filed 04/03/2007

Page 12 of 35

Two of the documents Plaintiff produced during the audit discussed, inter alia, the status
of work being performed by Plaintiff’s lawyers (Shearman & Sterling LLP and in-house counsel)
and its accountants (Arthur Andersen and Pricewaterhouse). (“Con Ed Memos 1 & 2” attached
as Exhibits C-1 & C-2 respectively). According to the memoranda, Plaintiff’s lawyers were
working for Plaintiff on an analysis of the impact of soon to be implemented Treasury
Regulation and the tax risks associated with the LILO Transaction. (Id.).
Plaintiff also produced during audit several versions of its “Risk Analysis” of the
transaction (a section of Volume 1 of Plaintiff’s “EZH Briefing Memo”). The Risk Analysis
incorporated the expected conclusions to be reached by Shearman & Sterling regarding the bona
fides of the LILO Transaction, and a discussion of the risks concerning the impact of the
Treasury Regulation identified above. (See, e.g., US01594-97, attached as Exhibit C-3).
Plaintiff also produced an email from Brian DePlautt, vice-president at Consolidated Edison
Development (“CED”), the subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. through whom the LILO
transaction was effectuated, containing a discussion of the proposed Treasury Regulation and its
impact on the LILO Transaction.4 (US7047-48, hereinafter “DePlautt Email 1” attached as
Exhibit C-6).
2.

Documents Produced to Defendant During Discovery

On or about September 25, 2006, Plaintiff produced documents to Defendant in
electronic format as part of its initial disclosures. As part of this production, Plaintiff produced

Even though this email does not indicate that the discussion originated with counsel, a
review of the information contained in the redacted version of the EZH White Paper indicates
that the substance of the communication contained in DePlautt Email 1 came from Shearman &
Sterling.
7

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Document 21

Page 13 of 35

an unredacted copy of a “Leasing White Paper” (CE012018-23, hereinafter “EZH White Paper”,
redacted version attached as Exhibit C-45). The document contains a review of the LILO
Transaction, including the risks, benefits, legal impediments and lease terms, all in summary
form, written for presentation to Plaintiff’s board of trustees or directors. The EZH White Paper
also includes a discussion of the expected legal opinion Plaintiff’s private counsel would render
regarding the merits of the LILO Transaction. Plaintiff produced this same White Paper to
Defendant a second time, also without redactions, on October 31, 2006, but with a new bates
number (PF004350-55, see Exhibit C-4).6 The October 31, 2006 production was the result of a
change in the bates numbering Plaintiff used for the documents it produced.
Plaintiff also produced, in unredacted form, DePlautt Email 1 (discussing proposed
Treasury Regulation and its impact on the LILO Transaction) for a second and third time in the
September 25 (CE006516-17) and October 31 (PF005936-37) productions. DePlautt Email 1
appears to contain information similar to the information redacted in the EZH White Paper.
(Compare Exhibit C-6 with, Exhibit C-4).

5

Although this document and others were produced to Defendant during discovery
without redactions, Defendant has attached only redacted versions in connection with this
motion, so as to preserve the status quo while this motion is pending. However, should the Court
request it, unredacted versions can be submitted for in camera review.
6

On or about November 3, 2006, in response to Defendant’s Request for Production,
Plaintiff produced a partially redacted copy of yet another White Paper, describing another LILO
shelter that Plaintiff was evaluating, identified as ENECO. (PF007327-33 also labeled
CE011957-63, hereinafter “ENECO White Paper”, redacted version attached as Exhibit C-5).
Although this document was produced with a single redaction for privilege, Plaintiff did not
redact information about its counsel’s expected opinion on tax risk. As discussed above, this
same opinion on risk was produced to Defendant on September 25 and October 31, 2006.
8

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Plaintiff did not assert a privilege with respect to the EZH White Paper (Exhibit C-4) or
DePlautt Email 1 (Exhibit C-6) when it later produced subsequent first privilege log on
November 3,2006. (Attached as Exhibit A-1).
On November 16, 2006, Defendant challenged Plaintiff’s privilege claims, advising
Plaintiff of the inconsistency in claiming privilege as to documents it had produced. (Nov. 16,
2006 correspondence, attached as Exhibit B-1). Plaintiff responded on December 1, 2006,
claiming that some of its prior disclosures, including the EZH White Paper, were inadvertent and
that Defendant should destroy the documents. (Dec. 1, 2006 correspondence, attached as Exhibit
B-2).
When Defendant expressed concern regarding Plaintiff’s basis for requesting the
destruction of documents (Dec. 12, 2006 correspondence, attached as Exhibit B-3), Plaintiff
responded that it had produced over seven thousand pages of documents,7 that counsel had
reviewed and re-reviewed the documents prior to their production, that the disclosure of the
information was inadvertent and that Plaintiff wished to retain its privilege as to the disclosed
documents (Dec. 14, 2006 correspondence, attached as Exhibit B-4). Plaintiff also continued to
argue that its General Objections to defendant’s discovery are sufficient to preserve Plaintiff’s
privilege. (Id.).
While the parties were discussing whether Plaintiff’s productions a month earlier were
privileged and inadvertent, on or about December 13, 2006, Plaintiff made its second
supplemental production in responses to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents.

7

The actual number was 5,520 pages when Plaintiff first produced the EZH White Paper
in unredacted form as part of its initial disclosures.

Plaintiff’s second supplemental production again included such purportedly “privileged” and
inadvertently produced documents and information. The production included a third unredacted
copy of the EZH White Paper and a second unredacted copy of the ENECO White Paper, this
time with different bates numbers (PF008275-80 and PF008258-64, respectively). (See Exhibits
C-4 and C-5). Plaintiff also produced additional unredacted drafts of the EZH White Paper
(PF008614-20, PF008621-28, PF008629-36, PF008637-44, PF008645-51, PF008652-58,
PF008790-96, PF009307-14, and PF009316-20) (see Exhibit C-4), another unredacted version of
the ENECO White Paper (PF008265-72, redacted version attached as Exhibit C-7), an
unredacted copy of Con Ed Memo 2 (PF007854-55) (see Exhibit C-2), and an unredacted
internal email discussing legal advice from Shearman & Sterling (PF008570-72, hereinafter
“DePlautt Email 2”, a redacted version attached as Exhibit C-8).
Each document was produced in unredacted form, notwithstanding that nearly all were
identified on Plaintiff’s December 13, 2006, supplemental privilege log. (Exhibit A-2). With
this latest production, some of the “inadvertently” disclosed information had been now been
turned over to Defendant multiple times. Defendant once again notified Plaintiff that its
privilege claims were inconsistent with its production. (See December 19 & 20 correspondence,
attached as Exhibits B-5 & B-6).
On December 21, 2006, and in a follow-up conversation with Defendant’s counsel,
Plaintiff’s counsel blamed the December 13, 2006 production of “privileged” information on an
error in the production of the CD ROM containing the information, and that counsel had not
reviewed the CD ROM produced to the United States. (See Dec. 21, 2006 correspondence,
attached as Exhibit B-7).

Shearman & Sterling Opinion

On or about November 3, 2006, in response to the United States’ First Set of Requests for
Production, Plaintiff produced unredacted copies of draft legal opinions issued by its counsel,
Shearman and Sterling. The draft opinions relate to (1) the LILO Transaction at issue here (PF
006115-19, hereinafter the “LILO Opinion”, attached as Exhibit C-9) and (2) a preexisting
equipment lease and its impact on the lease transaction (PF007258-59, hereinafter the
“Equipment Opinion”, attached as Exhibit C-10).8 Based on Plaintiff’s November 3, 2006,
disclosure of the draft LILO and Equipment Opinions, Defendant requested the final opinion and
related material. (Exhibit B-1).
In response, Plaintiff stated that draft opinions produced to Defendant had previously
been shared with its accountants, Pricewaterhouse, and were therefore discoverable and not
privileged. (Exhibit B-2). Plaintiff explained that Pricewaterhouse did not receive the final legal
opinion or any other related communications, and that these materials are privileged. (Id.).
Plaintiff argues that there was no waiver of privilege as to the final legal opinions or related
communications about those opinions. Plaintiff also claims there was no subject matter waiver
with regard to its disclosures to Pricewaterhouse, because the disclosures were not made in the
context of a judicial proceeding, and the disclosures did not provide Plaintiff with any “tactical
advantage.” (Id.). Plaintiff offered that it has “not relied upon, and does not intend to rely upon,
the legal advice received from Shearman & Sterling or any other counsel in the context of this
litigation.” as further justification for withholding this information. (Id.). Finally, Plaintiff

contended that the information constitutes attorney work product.9 (Id.). As set forth below,
these reasons are factually inaccurate and therefore do not support Plaintiff’s position.
ARGUMENT
The attorney-client privilege is “the oldest of the privileges for confidential
communications known to the common law” and its purpose is “to encourage full and frank
communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests
in the observance of law and administration of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S.
383, 389 (1981). The classic test for application of the attorney-client privilege is:
(1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the
person to whom the communication was made (a) is a member of the bar of a
court [and] . . . (b) in connection with this communication is acting as a lawyer;
(3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a) by
his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of securing
primarily either (I) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services or (iii) assistance in
some legal proceeding [and] . . . (4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not
waived by the client.
First Fed. Sav. Bank of Hegewisch v. United States, 55 Fed. Cl. 263, 266 (2003) (citing Energy
Capital Corp. v. United States, 45 Fed. Cl. 481, 484- 485 (2000)); see, e.g., 8 Wigmore,
Evidence § 2292 at 554.
Like all privileges and immunities, “[i]t ought to be strictly confined within the narrowest
possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.” J. Wigmore, Evidence §§ 2192 at 70
and 2291 at 554 (McNaughton rev. 1961); Permian Corp. v. United States, 665 F.2d 1214, 1221
(D.C. Cir. 1981). Therefore, courts, including this one, strictly construe the scope of the

Inconsistent with its claim of work product in anticipation of litigation, Plaintiff had
expressed its belief that there existed virtually no risk with respect to this transaction. (See
Exhibit C-3).

privilege. See Cabot v. United States, 35 Fed. Cl. 442, 444 (1996) (citing Eureka Fin. Corp. v.
Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 136 F.R.D. 179, 183 (E.D. Cal. 1991)).
As with all evidentiary privileges, the party asserting the attorney-client privilege has the
burden of proving all essential elements including the element of non-waiver. Fisher v. United
States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976); Cabot, 35 Fed. Cl. at 444. The privilege is waived by the client or
prospective client if the communication is later disclosed to a third party, and the client either did
not wish to keep the materials confidential, or “did not take adequate steps in the circumstances
to prevent disclosure” of the privileged communication. National Helium Corp. v. United States,
219 Ct. Cl. 612, 614 (1979); International Bus. Mach. Corp. v. United States, 37 Fed. Cl. 599,
603 (1997).
A.

Legal Opinions Disclosed to Pricewaterhouse are Not Privileged

The attorney-client privilege has no application where the communications are not
private and confidential between the client and the attorney. See Cabot, 35 Fed. Cl. at 444.
Documents sent to third-parties, including accountants, cannot be privileged, since they are not
“private and confidential” as between the attorney and her client. In re Grand Jury Proceedings,
727 F.2d 1352, 1357 (4th Cir. 1984). Even documents intended to be, but never actually,
produced to third-parties, are not privileged, because a privileged communication is only a
communication that was intended to be private and confidential. Id. at 1357-58.
Likewise, preliminary drafts of letters or documents which are intended to be published
to others also lack the necessary intended confidentiality to constitute privileged
communications. N.C. E1ectric Membership Corp. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 110 F.R.D.
511, 517 (M.D.N.C. 1986) (citing United States v. Under Seal, 748 F.2d 871 (4th Cir. 1984),

F.2d 600 (vacated on other grounds); Duplan Corp. v. Deering Milliken. Inc., 397 F. Supp. 1146,
1168 (D.S.C. 1974)). Not only are the drafts themselves not privileged, but the communications
and details underlying the drafts to be published to third parties are not subject to the privilege.
See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 33 F.3d 342, 354 (holding that not only must the party
produce final audit letters and SEC filings, but also the underlying drafts, notes, and memoranda
reflecting client communications on the subject). Such underlying details include all preliminary
drafts, any communications, including information to be published or from which the published
information is derived, and any attorney’s notes containing material necessary to the preparation
of the document. Under Seal, 748 F.2d at 875 n.7; Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 136
F.R.D. 421, 427 (E.D.N.C. 1991).
As described above, Plaintiff produced the draft Shearman & Sterling LILO Opinion
(Exhibit C-9) and the Equipment Opinion (Exhibit C-10) in response to Defendant’s discovery
requests. The draft LILO Opinion also was provided to Plaintiff’s accountant, Pricewaterhouse,
on December 10, 1997 (See PF6113, attached hereto as Exhibit C-11), in response to Plaintiff
circulating a draft tax opinion by Pricewaterhouse on December 9, 1997. (See PF005602-5605,
attached as Exhibit C-12).
While Defendant does not have a copy of the final Shearman & Sterling opinion, it does
have a document Plaintiff has produced, stating that Plaintiff intended to produce Shearman &
Sterling’s LILO Opinion to Pricewaterhouse. (See PF006324-26, see row 33, attached as Exhibit
C-14). Contrary to this clear indication in its own documents, Plaintiff asserted in its December
1, 2006, correspondence to defendant that “[t]o Con Edison’s knowledge, neither the final legal

14

opinion nor any other related communications were provided to Pricewaterhouse.” (Exhibit B2).
Since Plaintiff at least intended to disclose the final Shearman & Sterling opinion letters
to Pricewaterhouse, and also may have disclosed them,10 the attorney-client privilege does not
attach to the final opinion letters or the communications and details underlying the final
opinions. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 727 F.2d at 1357; In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 33
F.3d at 354.
B.

The Privilege Asserted Does Not Attach or Has Been Waived With
Respect to 29 Documents Identified on Plaintiff’s Privilege Log

As a result of its repeated disclosures to the United States, Plaintiff has waived any
potential privilege as to twenty-nine (29) of the thirty-one (31) documents listed as privileged in
Plaintiffs’ December 31, 2006 privilege log.11 (Exhibit A-2). The reasons for waiver are several.
First, Plaintiff provided the Con Ed Memos 1 and 2 (Exhibits C-1 & C-2) to the IRS, but
now seeks to prevent Defendant from using them in this case. (See Exhibit A-2, pages 1 & 2:
PF005618-19, PF005647-48, and PF007852-53). Second, although Plaintiff claims privilege on

10

Due to the uncertainty, Defendant has issued third party discovery to Pricewaterhouse
to determine exactly what they reviewed.
11

Defendant has identified other, redacted documents produced by Plaintiff that are not
listed on its privilege log. (See, e.g., PF003022-003038, attached as Exhibit C-16). Although
Defendant alerted Plaintiff to its production of redacted materials without listing them on its
privilege log (see Exhibit B-1), Plaintiff never amended its privilege log to include this
document, and therefore has not made a valid claim of privilege with respect to the redacted
information. Plaintiff therefore is obligated to produce this document in unredacted form. It
should also be recognized that Plaintiff has redacted information from documents produced to
Defendant for reasons other than privilege. (See Exhibit B-2 and Exhibit A-2, at page 4).
Plaintiff’s practice in doing so belies any claim that its redaction of information in Exhibit C-16
should be treated as a claim of privilege.

the White Papers and other memoranda reflecting advice of counsel, it produced documents
containing substantially similar information to the IRS during audit and to Defendant during
discovery.12 (Compare Exhibits C-3 & C-6 with Exhibit C-4). Third, on several occasions
during discovery, Plaintiff produced documents it now claims are either privileged or contain
privileged information. (See Exhibits C-4, C-5, C-7 & C-8). In fact, some of this production
occurred well after Defendant first notified Plaintiff of the inconsistencies between its production
and its privilege log. The produced documents include unredacted versions of the EZH and
ENECO White Papers that Plaintiff had earlier produced and then asked Defendant to destroy.
(PF008275-80 and PF008258-64, other drafts of the EZH White Paper,13 the ENECO White
Paper (Exhibit C-6), Con Ed Memo 2 (Exhibit C-2), and DePlautt Email 2, discussing the legal
advice provided by counsel (Exhibit C-8)).
Plaintiff attempts in various ways to explain away the significance of its repeated
productions; explanations range from inadvertently not identifying a document as privileged
despite what Plaintiff says was a “thorough” review, to unreviewed errors in the production of
CD ROMs. Plaintiff’s claims of inadvertence also should be evaluated in light of its having
provided to the United States and its accountants, Pricewaterhouse, information about certain
legal opinions it obtained from Shearman & Sterling in connection with this transaction,

12

For example, based on the descriptions of documents set forth in Plaintiff’s privilege
log, Con Ed Memos 1 and 2 appear to discuss the substance of documents for which Plaintiff
asserts a privilege (CE005825 and CE008028). (See Exhibit A-2, pages 1- 2).

including both draft opinions (Exhibits C-9 & C-10) and final conclusions, while refusing to
provide other drafts as well as a final version of the opinion to Defendant.
1.

Documents Disclosed to the IRS

During Plaintiff’s audit, it produced numerous documents to the IRS, pertaining to the
LILO transaction at issue in this case, thereby waiving any privilege that otherwise might have
applied to any of the documents or information they contain. Carter v. Gibbs, 909 F.2d 1450,
1451 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (the privilege “evaporates upon any voluntary disclosure of confidential
information to a third party . . . .”), superseded in non-relevant part, Pub. L. No. 103-424, §
9(c), 108 Stat. 4361 (1994); see Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Republic of the Philippines, 951
F.2d 1414, 1424 (3d Cir. 1991) (“[I]t is well-settled that when a client voluntarily discloses
privileged communications to a third party, the privilege is waived.”).
Among these documents were the Con Ed Memos 1 and 2 (Exhibits C-1 & C-2), the Risk
Analysis document (Exhibit C-3), and DePlautt Email 1 (Exhibit C-6). These documents
discussed, among other matters, the status of Plaintiff’s counsel’s work with respect to an
analysis of the impact of the soon to be implemented Treasury Regulation and the tax risks
associated with the LILO Transaction, as well as the expected conclusions and final conclusions
of counsel with respect to these issues. (Exhibits C-1, C-2, C-3 & C-6). Consequently, Plaintiff
waived the attorney-client privilege as to the legal advice from Shearman & Sterling identified
on Plaintiff’s privilege log, including that contained in the LILO Opinion, White Papers and
other memoranda. Carter, 909 F.2d at 1451. Further, since the documents disclosed to the IRS
are the same as other documents produced in discovery to which Plaintiff asserts the privilege
still attaches (PF005618-19, PF005647-48, and PF007852-53), these privilege claims should be

17

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Page 23 of 35

denied. Because this information was disclosed to the IRS during audit, Plaintiff is not entitled
to assert a privilege with respect to (1) the same documents produced during discovery and (2)
information contained within those documents. Further, as described more fully below,
Plaintiff’s disclosure of these documents constitutes a subject matter waiver of the subjects
addressed in those documents.
2.

Documents Disclosed in Discovery

During initial disclosures and in response to the United States’ Request for Production,
Plaintiff produced several unredacted documents, including numerous drafts of the EZH and
ENECO White Papers (see Exhibits C-4, C-5 & C-7), and memoranda and email
communications discussing the legal advice provided by its private and in-house counsel which
it now claims are privileged (see Exhibits C-1, C-2 & C-8). Plaintiff also produced DePlautt
Email 1 (Exhibit C-6), which appears to contain legal advice similar to the information set forth
in the White Papers and other communications that Plaintiff now seeks to shield. Plaintiff has
not asserted a claim of privilege with respect to DePlautt Email 1.
Plaintiff has made a variety of arguments to Defendant that its productions do not result
in a waiver of privilege. None has merit.
a.

General Objections Do Not Preserve a Privilege
Claim as to Documents Produced

Plaintiff argues that its General Objections to defendant’s discovery requests preserves
the privileged nature of produced documents. (See Exhibit A-6). Plaintiff’s General Objection
states “(t)he inadvertent disclosure by Con Edison of any information protected by the
attorney-client privilege, the work-product protection or any other privilege shall not constitute a
waiver of the applicable privilege or protection as to that information or any other related
18

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Document 21

Filed 04/03/2007

Page 24 of 35

information.” (Id.). Plaintiff’s General Objection neither validly asserts a claim of privilege, nor
establishes that prior production actually was inadvertent and does not waive privilege.
To begin with, even if documents are not disclosed, a general objection is insufficient to
validly assert a claim of privilege. See Universal City Development Partners, Ltd. v. Ride &
Show Engineering, Inc., 230 F.R.D. 688, 695 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (noting that a generalized claim
of privilege is insufficient in part because it does not enable the opposing party to assess the
validity of the privilege); Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States, No. 98-720, 2001 WL
1819224, at *2 (Fed. Cl. Mar. 1, 2001) (finding blanket assertions of privilege improper and
insufficient to preserve a privilege and noting the party’s refusal to withdraw generalized claims
of privilege in assessing sanctions) (a copy is attached hereto); see generally In re G-I Holdings
Inc., 218 F.R.D. 428, 431-32 (D. N.J. 2003) (a general objection on the basis of privilege is
insufficient to maintain that privilege in the face of production of privileged documents).14
b.

Plaintiff’s Disclosures Can Not Be Considered Inadvertent

Plaintiff next claims that documents containing “certain privileged and protected
information was inadvertently not redacted” and produced to Defendant during discovery. As
discussed above, however, some of the information that Plaintiff claims was produced
inadvertently was disclosed previously to the IRS on audit in Con Ed Memos 1 and 2, the Risk
Analysis documents, and DePlautt Email 1 (see Exhibits C-1, C-2, C-3 & C-6), and during
discovery in the form of DePlautt Email 1 (see Exhibit C-6). Despite Plaintiff’s claims, such
repeated disclosures cannot be considered “inadvertent.”

14

Plaintiff’s reliance on its General Objection, made only in response to Defendant’s
Request for Production has no application to the EZH White Paper produced as part of Plaintiff’s
Initial Disclosures. (Exhibit C-4).

Page 25 of 35

And even if they had been inadvertent, it does not follow necessarily that there has been
no waiver of privilege. Courts generally have followed one of three distinct approaches to
attorney-client privilege waiver when there has been an inadvertent disclosure: (1) the “lenient”
position that holds that an inadvertent disclosure is not “voluntary” and not a waiver; (2) the
“strict” approach provides that an inadvertent disclosure waives the privilege; and (3) the
“middle of the road” approach employing a multi-factored balancing test to determine whether
there has been a waiver. Pavlik v. Cargill, Inc., 9 F.3d 710, 713 (8th Cir.1993). The Court of
Federal Claims follows the “middle of the road” approach, holding that the circumstances
surrounding an inadvertent disclosure must be considered when determining if there has been a
waiver. National Helium Corp. v. United States, 219 Ct. Cl. 612, 616 (1979) (“The fundamental
questions always are: did the client wish to keep back the privileged materials, and did he take
adequate steps in the circumstances to prevent disclosure of such documents.”).
(i)

Plaintiff Waived the Attorney-Client Privilege as to
the Leasing White Paper15

On December 14, 2006, in response to Defendant’s concerns about Plaintiff’s privilege
claims, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant, requesting that it destroy an unredacted copy of the
EZH White Paper (Exhibit C-4) that it previously produced to Defendant during discovery on
September 25, 2006. That document had been produced a second time, on October 31, 2006,
albeit with a different bates number (PF004350-55).

15

While the discussion in this section is limited to the EZH White Paper, the same
analysis applies to the ENECO White Paper (Exhibit C-5) Plaintiff initially produced on
November 3, 2006.
20

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Document 21

Filed 04/03/2007

Page 26 of 35

In its letter, Plaintiff relied upon National Helium Corp. v. United States, 219 Ct. Cl. 612
(1979) and Alaska Pulp Corp., Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 734, 735 (1999), to argue that its
repeated disclosure of this document was inadvertent. (Exhibit B-2). Neither case supports
Plaintiff’s claim that its disclosures were inadvertent.
In National Helium, the plaintiff disclosed 10 pages out of approximately 150 cartons of
responsive documents. Based on the large number of documents and the short time for
production, the court found no waiver after the plaintiff undertook a “good faith, sufficiently
careful, effort to winnow a relatively small number of privileged materials from a very large
volume of documents to be produced. . . .” National Helium Corp., 219 Ct. Cl. at 615.
Similarly, in Alaska Pulp, the plaintiff sought to recover one privileged document provided to
the defendant by a third party. The plaintiff claimed that the production of the privileged
material was inadvertent, and that the document had not lost its privileged status. The Court held
that given the clear labeling of the document (the documents were clearly labeled “Attorney
Work Product -- Attorney/Client Communication” in bold), the extraordinary large number of
documents (70,000 pages), the short production time (the plaintiff did not ask for an extension)
and plaintiff’s reasonable steps to protect the privilege (including a screening process requiring
the efforts of a team of several lawyers and approximately ten to fifteen paralegals and
secretaries with a spot check at the end) that the privilege had not been waived as to the
privileged material. 44 Fed. Cl. at 736.
Plaintiff’s disclosures fall far short of the standards for inadvertence expressed in
National Helium and Alaska Pulp. The EZH White Paper produced by Plaintiff contained no

21

Case 1:06-cv-00305-MBH

Page 27 of 35

designation that Plaintiff intended to keep it privileged.16 The Court, in United States v. KelseyHayes Wheel Co., 15 F.R.D. 461, 465 (E.D. Mich. 1954), held “[i]t is difficult to be persuaded
that the documents were intended to remain confidential in light of the fact that they were
indiscriminately mingled with other routine documents of the corporation and that no special
effort to preserve them in segregated files with special protections was made.” Indeed, the EZH
White Paper, did not appear on Plaintiff’s original privilege log and was mingled with the other
documents produced by Plaintiff in its Rule 26 disclosures. (See Exhibit A-1). Plaintiff did not
raise a privilege claim until after it received Defendant’s letter dated November 16, 2007. And
while in National Helium the litigants had to sift through 150 cartons, and Alaska Pulp involved
a production of 70,000 pages, Plaintiff production was much smaller, was made in two stages,
and contained largely duplicative information. Plaintiff produced 5,520 pages in the Initial
Disclosures, and 1,813 pages in response to discovery. Moreover, unlike the two cases Plaintiff
relies on, it faced no burdensome time constraints on production, as it controlled the timing of
the filing of the suit and received an extension of time to respond to the United States’ discovery
requests. Moreover, it appears that Plaintiff relied on information in these documents to support
its Complaint and responses to interrogatories. See infra section C.2.
(ii)

Plaintiff Waived the Privilege as to 13 Documents Produced on December
13, 2006

Even if Plaintiff’s production of the EZH and ENECO White Papers were inadvertent in
its Rule 26 initial disclosures and inadvertent again in its initial response to Defendant’s

16

While the ENECO White Paper (Exhibit C-4) originally produced to Defendant did
contain one redaction, there was no other indication that Plaintiff intended to keep the rest of the
document privileged.

Requests for Production, it in any event waived any privilege on December 13, 2006 when it
again produced these documents, as well as various drafts and other documents referring to the
information. Ironically, at the same time Plaintiff was producing these documents, its counsel
was drafting a letter to Defendant describing its thorough screening procedures. (See Exhibit B4).
Plaintiff’s production on December 13, 2006, plaintiff consisted of only 1,781 pages,
labeled PF007843-PF009624, which included eleven documents (and only 68 pages) that it
claimed were privileged. (Exhibit A-2). Plaintiff can hardly claim that it was rushed into
inadvertently producing this small number of documents, as the production occurred 75 days
after Defendant’s initial request for production. Unlike the plaintiffs in National Helium and
Alaska Pulp, Plaintiff had adequate time to perform its review. Nevertheless, each document
appeared unredacted on a CD Rom produced by Plaintiff on December 13, 2006.17 Plaintiff
claims that it, “clearly did not intend to produce the documents in unredacted form, as it included
them on a privilege log. The documents were reviewed and redacted for attorney-client privilege
and work product protection. . . . The error in producing the documents in unredacted form
resulted solely from an error in the production of the CD Rom.” (Exhibit B-7). However, if
Plaintiff had examined even one of the eleven documents on the CD Rom, it easily would have
discovered that they did not contain any redactions.18 Obviously, Plaintiff failed to take adequate

17

To confuse matters further, Plaintiff produced additional unredacted copies of Con Ed
Memo 2 (Exhibit C-2) and the ENECO White Paper (Exhibit C-7), with new bates numbers,
PF007854-55 and PF008265-72, which did not appear on Plaintiff’s December 13, 2006
privilege log. (See Exhibit A-2).

measure to protect privilege. Alaska Pulp Corp., 44 Fed. Cl. at 736.

steps to protect these documents – especially since Plaintiff already was on notice from
Defendant of its previous disclosure of such information. Plaintiff therefore waived any
privilege with respect to these documents.
C.

Plaintiff Waived any Privilege With Respect to the Subject Matter of
Information Contained in Documents it Produced

Once a court determines there has been a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, the
question of the scope of the waiver arises. In GFI, Inc. v. Franklin Corp., 265 F.3d 1268, 1275
(Fed. Cir. 2001), the Federal Circuit determined that generally, a disclosure of a privileged
communication waives the privilege with respect to the same subject matter in other
communications. Accord 8 Wigmore, Evidence, § 2328, at 638 (“The client’s offer of his own or
the attorney’s testimony as to a specific communication to the attorney is a waiver as to all.”). In
In re Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 238 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the Federal Circuit held that
disclosure of legal advice waives the attorney-client privilege “with respect to all documents
which formed the basis for the advice, all documents considered by counsel in rendering that
advice, and all reasonably contemporaneous documents reflecting discussions by counsel or
others concerning that advice.” Id. at 1374-75. The rationale for waiving the attorney-client
privilege as to documents with the same subject matter as the disclosed documents is predicated
on fairness and consistency. 8 Wigmore, Evidence, § 2327.

Subject Matter Waiver as to the Documents Produced to the Government

For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff has voluntarily waived its privilege on the
documents produced to the IRS during audit, specifically (1) the Con Ed Memos 1 and 2
(Exhibits C-1 & C-2), which describe the work being performed by in-house counsel with
respect to the LILO Transaction and describe the analysis being performed by Shearman &
24

Sterling relating to the tax risks of the LILO Transaction, (2) the Risk Analysis documents
(Exhibit C-3), which opine on the expected opinions to be issued by Shearman & Sterling with
respect to the LILO Transaction, and (3) DePlautt Email 1 (Exhibit C-6), which discusses,
among other things, the substance of the advice of Shearman & Sterling pertaining to the impact
of the proposed Treasury Regulation. Defendant also is entitled to all documents related to these
same subject matters. GFI, Inc., 265 F.3d at 1275.
Further, since Plaintiff has, on numerous occasions during the course of discovery,
produced unredacted documents that resulted in a waiver of Plaintiff’s attorney client privilege
(e.g., the various versions of the EZH and ENECO White Papers, the LILO Opinion, the Con Ed
Memos 1 & 2, and DePlautt Emails 1 & 2), Defendant is entitled to all documents relating to the
subject matter of these documents, including the advice of Shearman & Sterling and in-house
counsel with respect to the LILO Transaction. This waiver covers twenty-nine of the thirty-one
documents identified on Plaintiff’s December 13, 2006 privilege log (Exhibit A-2).
2.

Subject Matter Waiver Related to the Shearman & Sterling Opinion

In addition to our discussion above, showing that the Shearman & Sterling opinions and
underlying materials are not confidential communications and therefore are not privileged in the
first place, Plaintiff’s production of the draft (and apparently the final) version of those opinions
waives the subject matters they discuss. Production of a legal opinion waives the attorney-client
privilege “with respect to all documents which formed the basis for the advice, all documents
considered by counsel in rendering that advice, and all reasonably contemporaneous documents
reflecting discussions by counsel or others concerning that advice.” Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v.

United States, 54 Fed. Cl. 306, 315 (2002) (quoting In re Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 238 F.3d at
1374-75).
In its letter dated December 1, 2006, Plaintiff presents multiple arguments against a
finding of subject matter waiver. Each argument lacks merit
Plaintiff first argues that a disclosure outside of a judicial proceeding that does not
provide a litigant with a tactical advantage is not a waiver:
“The disclosure of this draft to Pricewaterhouse did not result in a subject-matter
waiver of the attorney-client privilege, because the disclosure was not made in the
context of a judicial proceeding and did not provide Con Edison with any tactical
advantage. See Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States, 54 Fed. Cl. 306, 315
(2002) (“subject matter waiver [of the attorney-client privilege] is inapplicable
where the disclosure is not made in the context of a judicial proceeding and did
not afford the client an adversarial gain”).
(Exhibit B-2).
In Yankee Atomic Elec. Co., 54 Fed. Cl. at 315, the United States asserted a privilege as
to the discovery of various documents under the deliberative process privilege, the
attorney-client privilege, and attorney work product protection. The Court determined that two
documents requesting legal advice were not protected because the advice voluntarily was
disclosed by the Department of Energy (“DOE”) in a September 1994 draft report unrelated to
any litigation. The court then concluded that “because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate any
prejudice or tactical disadvantage resulting from DOE’s disclosure of two memoranda in a
non-judicial setting over eight years ago, related confidential documents, if privileged, may be
protected from disclosure.” Id. at 315.
Plaintiff’s facts do not resemble those in Yankee Atomic. Unlike the opinion in Yankee
Atomic that was unrelated to any litigation, the tax opinion that Plaintiff provided to

26

Pricewaterhouse was for the transaction at issue. And despite Plaintiff’s claim, in its December
1, 2006, letter that it “has not relied upon, and does not intend to rely upon, the legal advice
received from Shearman & Sterling or any other counsel in the context of this litigation,” it
clearly has. (Exhibit B-2). In response to Defendant’s Interrogatory No. 4, which asked for the
risks related to the transaction and actions taken by Plaintiff to mitigate such risks, Plaintiff
stated that, “Con Edison mitigated [its legal risks, including tax risks] by seeking opinions from
qualified and reputable legal counsel.” (Exhibit A-3). In its Complaint, Plaintiff also
acknowledges that, “ConEdison Development retained a number of consultants to assist in its
review” of the transaction. (Compl. ¶ 49). This included legal counsel (see Plaintiff’s Response
to Interrogatory Number 1 (Exhibit A-3)). Plaintiff cannot first inject the existence of the
opinion into the case and then avoid its disclosure.19 First Heights Bank, F.S.B. v. United States,
46 Fed. Cl. 312, 316 (2000) (“Courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming
the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege . . .
voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege.
Disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality, and courts need not permit hide-and-seek
manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor.”), clarified in part by, 46 Fed. Cl. 827
(2000). See United States v. Exxon Corp., 94 F.R.D. 246 (D.D.C. 1981) (“Exxon’s injection of

In addition to affirmatively asserting reliance, during the audit, Plaintiff relied on the
Pricewaterhouse tax opinion, which in turn relied on the Shearman & Sterling legal opinion, in
an effort to avoid the imposition of tax penalties. Plaintiff referred to its position as being
supported by the Pricewaterhouse tax opinion. (US00709, attached as Exhibit C-13). In
addition, Plaintiff advised the IRS, in connection with its effort to avoid penalties, that it “sought
the advice of both inside and outside advisors, who performed exhaustive research in order to
render this advice.” (US06048-49, attached as Exhibit C-15). These advisors included
Plaintiff’s counsel.

the issue of its state of mind into the suit acted as a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to
all documents bearing on that issue”).
A waiver has occurred because Plaintiff has represented in this case that it relied on the
advice of its attorneys. See In re G-I Holdings Inc., 218 F.R.D. 428, 431-32 (D. N.J. 2003)
(“Had Debtors sought to preserve the attorney-client privilege, they should have refrained from
raising the advice of counsel altogether.”). Where the “(1) assertion of the privilege was a result
of some affirmative act, such as filing suit, by the asserting party; (2) through this affirmative
act, the asserting party put the protected information at issue by making it relevant to the case;
and (3) application of the privilege would have denied the opposing party information vital to his
defense,” a party has waived any applicable privilege. Id. Since Plaintiff states that it has relied
upon opinions of counsel, it has placed their advice at issue in the case and cannot now claim
privilege to deny Defendant access to this information.
Plaintiff also argues that “the draft legal opinion was prepared in anticipation of litigation
and constitutes work-product.” (Exhibit B-2). Clearly this is not so. “The threshold
determination in a case involving a claim of work product privilege is whether the material
sought to be protected from discovery was prepared in anticipation of litigation” or was prepared
in the ordinary course of business or for other purposes. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. United
States, 69 Fed. Cl. 784, 790 (Ct. Cl. 2006). The issues discussed in the LILO Opinion Letter
were to assuage Plaintiff’s board to obtain its approval of the transaction. In addition, Plaintiff
intended to produce the final version of the Opinion Letter to its independent auditor,
Pricewaterhouse (Exhibit C-14, line 33), presumably to be able to meet its financial reporting
requirements. This is the type of non-litigation, ordinary course of business purpose this Court

28

in Pacific Gas indicated would result in work product protection not applying, regardless of the
test applied to a purported “dual purpose” document. See Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 69 Fed. Cl. at
790. It is Plaintiff’s burden to meet this threshold, and any doubts, ambiguities, uncertainties, or
silences as to the scope of the work product rule should be resolved in favor of the overall policy
of liberal discovery under the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims.20 Id.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons expressed above, this court should enter an Order as follows (as well as
any other relief it deems appropriate):
1.

The draft and Final Legal Opinions by Shearman & Sterling are not privileged,
or, alternatively, Plaintiff waived any privilege with respect to the Opinions;

2.

Plaintiff waived the attorney-client privilege as to Con Ed Memos 1 and 2;

3.

Plaintiff waived the attorney-client privilege as to the EZH and ENECO White
Papers;

4.

Plaintiff waived the attorney-client privilege as to the thirteen Documents
Produced on December 13, 2006; and

5.

Plaintiff’s production of documents constitutes a subject matter waiver with
respect to the following topics: the legal advice of Shearman & Sterling
pertaining to the LILO Transaction and the ENECO Transaction and the in-house
counsel communications pertaining to the LILO Transaction;

20

In the assessment of risks at the time, Plaintiff concluded that there was almost no
litigation risk associated with the transaction. (See, e.g., Exhibit C-3). Thus, any claim by
Plaintiff that it was prepared with a “reasonable anticipation of litigation,” Pacific Gas & Elec.
Co., 69 Fed. Cl. at 790, should be rejected as contrary to Plaintiff’s own documents.
