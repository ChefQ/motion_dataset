Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendants1 submit
this Motion to Dismiss Count V (“Dilution Under Texas Law”) of the Amended
Complaint filed by Plaintiff Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon” or “Plaintiff”)
(Dkt. No. 15), and in support of that motion argue as follows:
I.
INTRODUCTION
FXX Network owns a federal trademark registration of the FXX trademark
in “standard character” form.

It is black-letter law that a standard-character

registration covers stylized variations of the mark. Pursuant to Section 43(c)(6) of
the federal Lanham Act, ownership of a federal registration is “a complete bar” to
state law-based dilution claims. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(6). Thus, Count V of
Exxon’s Complaint, which purports to state a claim under the Texas state antidilution statute, TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 16.103, is barred, and should be
dismissed as a matter of law.
II.
FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
The FX cable network—launched nearly 20 years ago—reaches almost 100
million U.S. homes, offering original and syndicated programming. To capitalize

1

The named defendants, FX Networks, LLC, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation,
Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., and FXX Network, LLC, are referred to collectively as
“FXX Network” or “Defendants.” The owner of the federal trademark registration and
applications identified below is Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, which for
simplicity also is referred to as “FXX Network” in this brief.

HOU:3387181.1

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 18 Filed in TXSD on 12/26/13 Page 8 of 20

on the goodwill associated with the well-known FX name, two sister networks
were introduced in 2013: FXX and FXM. Dkt. No. 15, ¶¶ 22-24. The FXM
channel focuses on movies, while the FXX channel focuses on comedy, action and
sports programming.
On January 9, 2013, FXX Network filed a trademark application to register
the FXX mark for “television transmission and broadcasting services” (the “FXX
Mark”). This application covers the FXX Mark in standard character form (with
no stylization, font or logo element).

See Declaration of Sabina A. Vayner

(“Vayner Decl.”) ¶ 2, Ex. A.2
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) reviewed the application
for the FXX Mark and, after searching existing trademark registrations, concluded
that the FXX Mark did not conflict with any previously-registered marks and

2

It is well-settled that, “[i]n deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court may
permissibly refer to matters of public record” without converting the motion to dismiss
into one for summary judgment. Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1343 n.6 (5th Cir.
1994); see also Funk v. Stryker Corp., 631 F.3d 777, 782-83 (5th Cir. 2011). Records of
the USPTO are public records and are therefore subject to judicial notice. See, e.g.,
Kaempe v. Myers, 367 F.3d 958, 965 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“The documents recorded by the
PTO . . . are public records subject to judicial notice on a motion to dismiss.”); Duluth
News-Tribune v. Mesabi Publ’g Co., 84 F.3d 1093, 1096 n.2 (8th Cir. 1996) (“We take
judicial notice of plaintiff’s recent registration of the trademark ‘Duluth NewsTribune.’”). FXX Network requests that the Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence
201, take judicial notice of the Exhibits to the Vayner Declaration, which are from the
USPTO and Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (“TTAB”) online databases. Fed. R.
Evid. 201.

HOU:3387181.1

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 18 Filed in TXSD on 12/26/13 Page 9 of 20

otherwise was entitled to registration. As a result, on April 17, 2013, the USPTO
approved the FXX Mark for publication. See id.
The USPTO published the FXX Mark for opposition on May 7, 2013;
Exxon took no action to oppose the application within the statutorily-mandated
period.

FXX Network received a “Notice of

See id. ¶¶ 2-3, Exs. A-B.

Allowance,” and thereafter filed a “Statement of Use” for the FXX Mark, which
the USPTO accepted on November 7, 2013 (see id. ¶ 2, Ex. A), and a federal
registration of the FXX Mark (Reg. No. 4449045) issued on December 10, 2013.
See id. ¶ 4, Ex. C.
On October 2, 2013, Exxon—claiming expansive rights in a stylized,
interlocking “XX” mark—filed a seven-count complaint against Defendants,
alleging (1) federal trademark infringement; (2) federal unfair competition; (3)
federal trademark dilution; (4) common law unfair competition; (5) state trademark
dilution; and (6) unjust enrichment.3 See Dkt. No. 1. Exxon thereafter filed a
substantially identical Amended Complaint on December 12, 2013 (which added
Defendant FXX Network, LLC as a party and updated the procedural posture of a
proceeding before the TTAB, but made no other changes). See Dkt. No. 15.

3

Exxon also included a Count requesting that the Court block applications to register a
stylized FXX. See Dkt. No. 15, ¶¶ 64-68. But Exxon’s original and Amended
Complaints do not challenge the registration of the FXX Mark in standard character form.

3
HOU:3387181.1

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 18 Filed in TXSD on 12/26/13 Page 10 of 20

Because FXX Network owns a federal registration of the FXX Mark in
standard character form, and this form covers all stylized variations of the FXX
Mark, Exxon’s Texas state law dilution claim is statutorily barred and should be
dismissed.
III.
ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITIES
A.

Rule 12(b)(6) Standard
“Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate when the plaintiff has failed to

allege ‘enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face’ and fails
to ‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level.’” Nationwide Bi-Weekly
Admin., Inc. v. Belo Corp., 512 F.3d 137, 140 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell Atl.
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)). To survive such a motion, the “‘[f]actual
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on
the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.’” Kopp v. Klein,
722 F.3d 327, 333 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
B.

Exxon Fails to State a Claim for Dilution Under Texas State Law
1.

The Registration of the FXX Mark Is In Standard Character
Form, and Therefore Covers Stylized Variations of the FXX
Mark

Federal trademark registrations may be issued for either (1) a “standard
character” mark, or (2) for a “special form” mark (reflecting font, style, color, etc.).
See 37 C.F.R. § 2.52(a)(1) (for “standard character” mark applications, the
4
HOU:3387181.1

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 18 Filed in TXSD on 12/26/13 Page 11 of 20

application must include “a statement that the mark is in standard characters and no
claim is made to any particular font style, size, or color.”); TMEP §§ 807.03807.04.4 The registration of the FXX Mark is in standard character form. See
Vayner Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C.
It is axiomatic that, “[i]f [a] registrant . . . obtains a standard character mark
without claim to any particular font style, size or color, the registrant is entitled to
depictions of the standard character mark regardless of font style, size, or color.”
Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir.
2011); see In re Data Packaging Corp., 453 F.2d 1300, 1302 (C.C.P.A. 1972) (“It
seems to be well established that a single registration of a word mark may cover all
of its different appearances, potential as well as actual.”); In re Star Belly Stitcher,
Inc., 107 U.S.P.Q.2d 2059, 2063 (T.T.A.B. 2013) (“Because applicant’s proposed
mark is presented in standard characters, . . . applicant is not limited to any
particular depiction of the mark.”); In re Strategic Partners, Inc., 102 U.S.P.Q.2d
1397, 1399 (T.T.A.B. 2012) (“Applicant’s registered mark in standard character
form entitles it to depict the mark regardless of font style, size, or color.”).
The federal registration of the FXX Mark in standard character form
therefore necessarily encompasses all versions, including the stylized “FXX” that

ON

TRADEMARKS &

UNFAIR COMPETITION § 19:58 (4th ed. 2013) (“MCCARTHY”) (agreeing with
Federal Circuit and TTAB precedent, noting that “when a mark is presented in
typed or standard character format, the mark must be considered as appearing in
any format in which the mark could be depicted.”).
2.

Section 43(c)(6) of the Federal Lanham Act Bars Exxon’s State
Law Dilution Claim

Pursuant to Section 43(c)(6) of the Lanham Act, ownership of a valid federal
trademark registration on the Principal Register is “a complete bar” to state lawbased dilution claims. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(6); see also Westchester Media Co.
LP v. PRL USA Holdings, Inc., 103 F. Supp. 2d 935, 977 (S.D. Tex. 1999), aff’d in
part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 214 F.3d 658 (5th Cir. 2000); Pharmacia
Corp. v. Alcon Labs, Inc., 201 F. Supp. 2d 335, 386 (D.N.J. 2002).
The only case within the Fifth Circuit containing substantive discussion of
the statutory bar comes from this Court in Westchester Media.5 Because “the
purpose of the federal statute appear[ed] clear” and it could not “ignore the plain
language of the Act,” the Court barred a Texas state-law dilution claim on the basis
of a federal registration. In so doing, the court explained:
5

The statutory bar now in Section 43(c)(6) was contained in Section 43(c)(3) when
Westchester Media was decided; the amendment occurred in 2006 pursuant to the
Trademark Dilution Revision Act (“TDRA”).

HOU:3387181.1

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 18 Filed in TXSD on 12/26/13 Page 13 of 20

If a party asserts a dilution claim against one who owns a federally
registered mark, it must proceed under the federal dilution statute.
Allowing state law dilution claims to proceed against owners of
federally registered marks would interfere with federal law and
discourage the federal registration of marks, contrary to the purpose of
the Lanham Act.
Westchester Media, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 977; see also id. at 976.
By including Section 43(c)(6) in the TDRA, Congress sought to provide “a
further incentive for the federal registration of marks,” and to “protect registered
marks . . . from interference by state, or territorial legislation.” H.R. REP. NO. 104374, at 3, 7 (1995), as reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1030, 1034. The
Section 43(c)(6) bar is particularly sensible in light of the very inconsistent
standards of liability under state dilution law. Nearly 40 states have dilution
statutes, and they vary greatly.6 Some require that a trademark be “famous” to

CODE ANN. § 19.77.160 (2003) (same) with ALA. CODE § 8-12-17 (2010) (“is

Section 43(c)(6) expressly forecloses a state law dilution claim against a
defendant who owns a federal trademark registration; instead, a plaintiff is limited
to federal or state trademark infringement or unfair competition claims, or a federal
dilution claim. While they ultimately will prove to be without merit, Exxon asserts

No Exceptions to the Statutory Bar Apply

FXX Network has two pending applications to register the FXX Mark in
“special form,” namely the following “FXX Logo”:

See Vayner Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, Exs. D-E. Exxon has filed a consolidated proceeding
with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to oppose these two applications, and
its Amended Complaint requests that this Court prevent those registrations from
issuing. See id. ¶ 7, Ex. F. However, the stylized FXX Logo applications are not
relevant to this motion. The registration of the standard character FXX Mark
acts as a bar to a state law dilution claim for any stylized version of that mark.
A “special form” registration, although more narrow than a “standard
character” one, may be sought for various reasons, including (1) to make
descriptive or ornamental matter registerable;7 (2) to increase differentiation from a

In re K-T Zoe Furniture, 16 F.3d 390, 394 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (“[T]he words and the
stylized script of ‘the sofa & chair company’ [are] separable elements, and [] only the
script design of the words was shown to have acquired secondary meaning.”); In re
Watkins Glen Int’l, Inc., 227 U.S.P.Q. 727, 729 (T.T.A.B. 1985) (“While the design
somewhat simulates a checkered flag which is a common symbol . . . , the design sought
to be registered, in our view, is highly stylized and unique.”).

third-party mark;8 or (3) for additional protection against a mark with a confusingly
similar script. By way of illustration of this last point, the oldest registrations
owned by The Coca-Cola Company for “beverages and syrups” are the following:

COCA-COLA
Reg. No. 238145

Reg. No. 238146

Although the “standard character” registration encompasses the stylized form (so
that Coca-Cola could, for example, use a “®” on the latter even if only the former
was registered), Coca-Cola also registered the stylized version of its mark because
it (rightly) anticipated something like the below, which does not use the words but
instead trades on the stylization:

See Coca Cola Co. v Gemini Rising, Inc., 346 F. Supp. 1183, 1190 (E.D.N.Y.
1972) (“high probability of confusion”).
Here, Exxon expressly chose not to oppose (and does not now challenge)
the standard character FXX Mark registration, and therefore its opposition to

4 MCCARTHY § 23:33 (“It has been observed that as a generalization, highly stylized,
highly contrasting letter design logos tend to fall on the no likelihood of confusion side of
the line whereas rather clear portrayals of a letter tend to result in a finding of a
likelihood of confusion.”).

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 18 Filed in TXSD on 12/26/13 Page 17 of 20

the more narrow FXX Logo applications is of no moment for purposes of this
motion. Exxon’s strategic decision not to oppose the standard character FXX
Mark should be no surprise, as Exxon previously admitted that:
[m]any firms used two “X’s” as part of their brand names: connoting
“Extra Strength” (deodorants), “Extra fine grade” (flour), “Extra
Hard” (knives), “Extra Power” (explosives). In fact two X’s side by
side are used so commonly to mean “Extra ____” as to be almost nondistinctive grade designations, certainly not entitled to a wide scope of
protection.
Vayner Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. G (quoting Response to Office Action, at 4). Indeed, Exxon
has a long history of coexistence with a plethora of standard character mark
registrations containing an “XX” element, including the following:

T.J. MAXX (Reg. No. 1637243)

NEXXUS (Reg. No. 2444553)

CAP-XX (Reg. No. 2683994)

SPECTRA MAXX (Reg. No. 4166759)

FERRARI FXX (Reg. No. 3204168)

DOS EQUIS XX (Reg. No. 1671837)

See Vayner Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. H. In fact, more than fifty federal registrations exist
containing the “XX” letters in standard character form. See id.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Exxon cannot state a claim under the Texas dilution statute because the
federal registration of the FXX Mark bars any state law dilution claim. Dismissal
of Exxon’s state law dilution claim not only is required, but will streamline the
litigation by obviating the need to conduct Texas-specific written discovery,
document production, surveys, and expert reports in addition to the other discovery
already required by the case.9 FXX Network respectfully requests that the Court
grant its motion to dismiss Count V of Exxon’s Complaint.

The Texas state law dilution statute, TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 16.103, includes
several factors for “determining whether a mark is famous,” and most are tailored to
activity (e.g., sales, advertising, recognition, etc.) specific to “within the state.” See id. §
16.103(b).
