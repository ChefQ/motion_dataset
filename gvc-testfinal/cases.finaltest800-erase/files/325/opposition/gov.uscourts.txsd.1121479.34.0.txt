PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS' RULE 12(B)(6) MOTION
TO DISMISS COUNT V OF PLAINTIFF'S AMENDED COMPLAINT

 

Plaintiff Exxon Mobil Corporation ("Plaintiff' or "ExxonMobil") opposes
Defendants' FX Networks, LLC, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation,
Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., and FXX Networks, LLC (referred to collectively
as "Defendants") Motion to Dismiss ("Defendants' Motion'') under Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b)(6).

I. INTRODUCTION

Defendants' unprecedented interpretation of the Lanham Act's state dilution

bar is wrong. Section 43(c)(6) of the Lanham Act states that the "ownership by a

person of a valid registration . . . on the principal register under this chapter shall

 
Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 34 Filed in TXSD on 01/23/14 Page 2 of 16

be a complete bar to an action against that person, with respect to that mark... ."
15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1125(c)(6) (emphasis added). Defendants do not own federal
registrations for the stylized interlocking X marks at issue here,' so ExxonMobil's
state dilution claim is not barred.

Defendants ignore the provision that limits the state dilution bar to "that
mark" registered, attempting to extend the bar to state dilution claims involving
their unregistered FIX designs. Defendants fail to cite a single case applying the
statute in this unprecedented manner, and ExxonMobil is not aware of any such
case. This is unsurprising, as Defendants' approach contradicts the plain meaning
of the statute and its underlying policies, and would lead to absurd and illogical
results. Because the unregistered FIX designs at issue in this case are not "that
mark," Section 43(c)(6) does not apply.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

Rule 12(b)(6) allows dismissal if a plaintiff fails "to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted." In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555
(2007), the Supreme Court confirmed that Rule 12(b)(6) must be read in
conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires "a short and plain statement of the

claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." FED. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). To

 

' This case involves Defendants' interlocking X marks, including the FXX Logo and all other
marks that contain an interlocking X design and that are used by Defendants in connection with
the FXX Network. ExxonMobil refers to these devices as the "FIX designs." See also Pltf's
Am. Complaint, paras. 22-32 (Docket Entry No. 15).

withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain "enough facts to state
a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570; see also
Elsensohn vy. St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, 530 F.3d 368, 372 (Sth Cir.
2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662
(2009), the Supreme Court elaborated on the pleading standards discussed in
Twombly. The Court explained that "the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does
not require `detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned,
the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Jd. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550
USS. at 555).

A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) "is viewed with disfavor and is
rarely granted." Turner v. Pleasant, 663 F.3d 770, 775 (Sth Cir. 2011) (citing
Harrington v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (Sth Cir. 2009)).
When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should presume they are
true, even if doubtful, and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an
entitlement to relief. Jgbal, 556 U.S. at 679.

It. ARGUMENT

1. The plain meaning of Section 43(c)(6) applies the state dilution bar only
to the mark as registered, not unregistered variations

Defendants' interpretation of the Lanham Act's provision establishing a state
dilution bar is wrong and unprecedented. The plain text of Section 43(c)(6) is clear

regarding the applicability of the statutory bar to state dilution claims, as it states

-3-

 
Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 34 Filed in TXSD on 01/23/14 Page 4 of 16

(in relevant part) that the "ownership by a person of a valid registration . . . on the
principal register under this chapter shall be a complete bar to an action against
that person, with respect to that mark... ." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1125(c)(6) (emphasis
added). However, in their attempt to stretch the Lanham Act's state dilution bar to
support their argument, Defendants conveniently leave out the limiting phrase
"with respect to that mark," which is clearly a reference to the specific mark that is
the subject of the prior-mentioned "valid registration." Defendants' Motion at 6.
It would be highly inconsistent to interpret Section 43(c)(6) in a completely
different way, i.e., affording the registrant the broad rights and benefits of federal
registration to an infinite and unpredictable number of unregistered design or
stylized forms of the mark. Such an interpretation is not contemplated by the plain
wording of the statute, nor is it supported by case law. Defendants fail to cite a
single case supporting their broad and novel theory, and ExxonMobil is unaware of
any such authority.
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") operates under the plain
meaning of the statute, treating standard character marks and stylized variations as
- different marks. The PTO "Does Not Issue Duplicate Registrations" for the same
mark covering the same goods and services. TMEP 0x00A7 703." Yet the PTO routinely

accepts registrations for both word marks in standard character form, and marks

that are stylized variations of the same letters (such as the two COCA-COLA
registrations referenced in Defendants' Motion, see Defendants' Motion at 10, the
FXX word and design marks at issue here, and many others).

Westchester Media, cited by Defendants, also supports the plain meaning of
the statute. In Westchester Media, the plaintiffs' registration was for the mark
POLO, and the defendant asserted a Texas state dilution claim against that exact
mark-not against a design or stylized form of the registered mark, as in this case.
See Westchester Media Co. v. PL USA Holdings, Inc., 103 F. Supp. 2d 935, 977
(S.D. Tex. 1999), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 214 F.3d 658 (Sth
Cir. 2000). This Court correctly concluded that the defendant's state dilution claim
was barred based on the plain language of the statute.

Moreover, the policy goal of the state dilution bar that Defendants cite-
encouraging federal registration of marks, Defendants' Motion at 7-is better
fulfilled by encouraging mark owners to register their marks in the design forms
for which they seek protection. Otherwise, a chaotic situation would result, in
which registration owners would have rights in design forms that infringe or dilute
others' marks. Also, as described below, parties with rights in design forms of
marks (e.g. McDonald's, University of Wisconsin, or ExxonMobil) would be
forced to oppose applications or petition to cancel registrations for marks in

standard character form to prevent others from obtaining rights (including

 
Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 34 Filed in TXSD on 01/23/14 Page 6 of 16

potentially incontestable rights) to use infringing or dilutive design forms of those
marks, and to preserve the right to state dilution claims. This increase in the
number of challenges would have a detrimental effect on the number of federal
applications. Defendants' interpretation would also create a disincentive for some
to register marks in design forms because they could instead rely only on their
federal registrations for marks in standard character form to assert or protect their
"rights" in a design form of the mark.

On the other hand, barring state dilution claims only with respect to the mark
as registered protects registered marks from interference by state or territorial
legislation, another stated policy goal of the state dilution bar cited by Defendants,
without creating the chaotic situation described below.

2. Defendants' theory would lead to absurd and illogical results

Defendants' unprecedented theory is an illogical extension of the state
dilution bar found in Section 43(c)(6) of the Lanham Act. It is unsurprising that
they fail to cite a single case extending the statutory bar to preclude a state dilution
claim against an unregistered design mark based on a word mark registered in
standard character form, as such an approach would lead to absurd and illogical
results. For example, following Defendants' reasoning that a registration in
standard character form extends all the rights and benefits of registration to any

design or stylized variation of the registered mark, ExxonMobil's ownership of an

 
Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 34 Filed in TXSD on 01/23/14 Page 7 of 16

incontestable federal registration in standard form for the mark MOBIL' would
entitle it to use the mark in a design form in which the "M" is McDonald's famous
"Golden Arches" (shown below), and McDonald's could not assert a state dilution
claim to challenge such use.* Or, Starwood Hotels, the owner of incontestable
federal registrations for W and W HOTELS in standard character form,' would be
entitled to use the University of Wisconsin's well-known "Motion W" logo (shown
below) in the mark-and the University of Wisconsin would be precluded from

asserting a state dilution claim to challenge such use.

The city of Amarillo, Texas provides a good example of just how outrageous
the results under Defendants' theory could become. Amarillo recently had an
unfortunate situation where its new logo was purportedly copied from an existing
design, resulting in a redesign of the logo and leading the local newspaper to
sponsor a parody logo contest.0x00B0 One of the most popular entries featured a play on
the trademark angle with a logo that would obviously violate the design marks of

eight different trademark owners:

 

Because the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce owns a registration for the mark
AMARILLO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE in standard character form,' under
Defendants' theory, it could use this logo, simply replacing the text below the
designs with "Chamber of Commerce," without fear that the owners of the
appropriated logos could assert a state dilution claim.

Defendants' interpretation of Section 43(c)(6) would thus require
McDonald's to proactively oppose all applications for any standard character mark

incorporating the letter "M" to preserve its right to assert a state dilution claim, just

its
Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 34 Filed in TXSD on 01/23/14 Page 9 of 16

in case an applicant should decide to exercise its "right" to depict the letter "M"
using the Golden Arches. In 2013 alone, this would mean McDonald's would have
had to oppose all 58,704 applications for standard character word marks
incorporating the letter "M" that were published for opposition that year.(R)
Extending beyond just McDonald's, in 2013 there were 188,296 published
applications for standard character marks." Under Defendants' interpretation,
owners of trademarks featuring letter(s) or number(s) in design form would have to
oppose any of these applications that incorporate the letter(s) or character(s) for
which the trademark owners' design marks cover. For example, The University of
Wisconsin would also need to oppose any application for a mark in standard
character incorporating the letter "W" to preserve its state dilution claims.
Likewise, ExxonMobil would be required to oppose all applications in standard
form for any mark incorporating a double X ("XX"), which as explained below,
ExxonMobil does not necessarily consider to infringe or dilute its ELX Marks"
unless presented in a similar interlocking X design form.

In addition, using Defendants' reasoning that all the rights and benefits of a
registration in standard characters extend to any design form of the mark, an owner

of an incontestable registration in standard character form would have the exclusive

Case 4:13-cv-02906 Document 34 Filed in TXSD on 01/23/14 Page 10 of 16

right to use that mark in any design form it chooses, including any design or
stylization that would infringe or dilute others' marks. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1115(b)
(an incontestable registration is "conclusive evidence of . . . the registrant's
exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce," subject to limited
defenses). Thus, under Defendants' theory, unless McDonald's or the University
of Wisconsin (or other similarly situated mark owners) opposed registration of all
standard character marks incorporating an "M" or "W," once the standard character
registrations became incontestable they would lose all opportunity to challenge any
use of the Golden Arches or "Motion W" logo in connection with the incontestable
registration.

3. The rights associated with a registration in standard characters reside
in the wording of the mark, not in design or stylized variations

Defendants also misconstrue the undisputed proposition that registering a
mark in standard character form entitles a registrant to support that registration by
depicting the mark in any form regardless of font, style, size, or color, concluding
with a leap in logic that this proposition means the statutory bar also applies to all
such depictions. What this proposition actually means, though, is that the
registrant is not limited to any particular depiction of the mark, such as how it is

actually used in commerce. Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp., 222 F.3d 943, 950
