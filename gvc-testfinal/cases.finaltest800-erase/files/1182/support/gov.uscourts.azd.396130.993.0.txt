Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Motion

17 For Time To Submit Evidence Of Legitimate Sources Of Income Between Jan 2005 And Aug
18 2008 – If Needed.[1] The defendant is requesting four weeks of time to assemble and submit
19 the evidence discussed in this motion.

On the afternoon of March 27, 2013, the defendant received the government's filing

21 titled Supplemental Memorandum To Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To
22 Suppress (Dkt. #986), which the government filed on March 26, 2013. The government's
23 filing related to the March 28, 2013 hearing and provided notice of “an additional point it
24 intends to raise during the course of the upcoming oral argument with respect to the issue

This motion and all attachments are being submitted under the protections of

Simmons. See Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 394 (1968) (Holding that “when a
27 defendant testifies in support of a motion to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment
grounds, his testimony may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of
28 guilt unless he makes no objection.”). The defendant objects to the government attempting
to introduce the attached declaration as evidence at trial.

1 regarding expectations of privacy.” Id., p. 1. Specifically, the government contended at Dkt.
2 #986, and later at the March 28, 2013 hearing, that the defendant had no known legitimate
3 sources of income and, therefore, had no reasonable expectation of privacy in anything he
4 may have purchased, i.e., the aircard, host laptop computer, apartment, etc.
5

At the March 28, 2013 hearing, the defendant informed the Court that he can produce

6 evidence of legitimate sources of income contained on the images of seized storage devices.
7 The defendant also noted that the government seized some of the noted evidence and should
8 be aware of at least some legitimate sources of income. See attached the defendant's

If the Court is considering the government's argument, the defendant respectfully

11 requests that the Court allow him time to gather and submit evidence that will knock out the
12 factual foundation of the government's argument. The defendant would have assembled the
13 evidence, produced declarations, and submitted all with this motion, however, he does not
14 currently have access to the images of the seized storage devices and, in any event, it will
15 take many days to prepare the evidence for filing once retrieved. The hard drives containing
16 the images are not stored at CCA-CADC. An investigator would need to visit with the
17 defendant for numerous hours while he accesses the hard drives containing the images in
18 order to locate and assemble all evidence in a form presentable for the record.[2][3] It would
19 also take two or three weeks to finish preparing the filing due to the logistics of defending a
20 case while incarcerated.[4] If the Court finds it necessary to review the noted evidence prior

remaining investigator funds. There is currently a motion pending for additional funds.
22 3.
Unlike the government, the defendant does not have the luxury of using EnCase and
AccessData FTK to search the images. The defendant's defense has advised the defendant
23 that this software is too expensive for the defense to purchase (i.e., said to be $3,000.00 to
$12,500.00). Additionally, the defendant needs time to go through the attachments of IRS-CI
24 Agent Tracy L. Daun's “Computer Forensic Report” in order to identify seized files
corresponding to legitimate sources of income that should be known to the government.

4.
For example, signing the declaration detailing where the evidence was located on the
seized
storage devices requires three separate legal visits: (1) a first visit to pick up the
26
digital document so it can be printed, (2) a second visit to bring the printed version for
27 signing and pick up for scanning, and (3) a third visit to bring the original signed signature
page and digital scan back to the defendant for incorporation into the digital filing. The type
28 of declaration at issue (i.e., properly documenting precisely where and how digital evidence
was retrieved) is too complex for the defendant to write by hand. See, e.g., Declaration RE:

2 be granted and the Court allow the defendant four weeks to assemble and submit the
3 evidence.
