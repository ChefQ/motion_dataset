than four grounds. State the facts supporting each ground.

GROUND ONE:
Jurisdiction

(a) Supporting facts (Do not argue or cite law. Just state the specific facts that support your claim.):
Even though images may have been produced outside State of West Virginia or in other countries
outside United States, Government did not show jurisdiction by proving that any connections were
made outside the State of West Virginia nor that state borders were crossed in any way to download
the images. There are no charges of production, only charges of possession and receiving.

Government did not show that this computer made any connections that crossed state borders to
commit any crime.

The government produced no evidence that bore on the jurisdictional question. It did not

present any evidence that the images on the hard drives had been mailed, shipped, or transported in
interstate commerce. Nor did it offer evidence that the images, themselves, had been shipped or
transported in interstate commerce. The government failed to provide a factual basis for the interstate
jurisdictional element.

The Government failed to prove the element of shipping or transport of the images

"in interstate commerce," where it presented no evidence that the images crossed

state lines.

GROUND TWO:
Usage of supressed evidence during trial

(a) Supporting facts (Do not argue or cite law. Just state the specific facts that support your claim.):

On April 28, 2005 the following recommendation was made by Judge Kauil "recommends Defendant's
Motion to Suppress the CPU, but not its contents
(the files contained in its hard drive and diskettes, be GRANTED."

The CPU, or tower (also referred to as a filing cabinet), was used during trial to demonstrate before the
jury. The hard drives were also supressed yet they were also used during trial. Only the information
contained within were not supressed. The CPU (tower) and hard drives should have not been allowed
to be used during trial. Prosecutor even referred to and pointed directly at the CPU during closing
arguments. Melinda Cash, the computer expert for the Government, also used the CPU and hard
drives during trial to demonstrate to the jury.

(7) If your answer to Question (c)(4) or Question (c)(5) is "No," explain why you did not appeal or

raise this issue:

GROUND THREE:
Lack of investigation

(a) Supporting facts (Do not argue or cite law. Just state the specific facts that support your claim.):
No virus scan was ever done on this computer to determine if there may have been any viruses,
trojans, or other hacking tools found which could have been another avenue by which these heinous
images could have ended up on my computer. Hackers can use trojan horses to gain access and
control over other computers and once this occurs, the hacker can do anything on the other computer
that the account user would normally be able to do including installing programs, deleting files, adding
files, using programs such as Kazaa, downloading, uploading, and any other function a user might do
with a computer. If a virus or trojan were found on my computer then it would show that | did not
"knowingly" possess these horrible images and it would explain how they could be mixed in with my
own files. Also concerning the image that was allegedly emailed to Amy Workman, police did not
produce any email or proof that the image had been emailed to her computer much less that the email
came from my computer. This image was also found on a third computer. The image was retrieved
from Workman's recycle bin, not from any email. Therefore, it is unknown how the image actually
ended up on Workman's computer other than her statement for which no supporting evidence is found

(1) If you appealed from the judgment of conviction, did you raise this issue?
Yes O No

(1) Did you raise this issue in any post-conviction motion, petition, or application?
Yes Q No &
(2) If your answer to Question (c)(1) is "Yes," state:
Type of motion or petition:

Name and location of the court where the motion or petition was filed:

Docket or case number (if you know):

Date of the court's decision:

GROUND FOUR:
Prosecutors mislead jury in closing arguments

(a) Supporting facts (Do not argue or cite law. Just state the specific facts that support your claim.):

Prosecutor stated in closing argument that | was computer savvy and that | had expertise which | do not
and there is no evidence suggesting that | am in any way expert in computers. | could not have done
the upgrades to my computer (adding hard drives, fans, etc) without the help of my brother. Prosecutor
cited my brother as saying | was electronicaly inclined which is partially true, but being electronically
inclined is a far cry from Knowing how to use a computer or it software. Electronics refers to hardware,
not software. Prosecutor also made statement in rebuttal closing argument that | was circumsized. | am
not circumcized. This was misleading to the jury because the figure in the image that was allegedly
emailed to Amy Workman is circumcized and | am not.
