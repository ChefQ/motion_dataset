IL INTRODUCTION

In its attempt to avoid summary judgment of invalidity, Lucent resorts to
mischaracterizations of both the governing law and the relevant facts. As explained below,
Lucent mischaracterizes the law of public use, corroboration, and enablement. Lucent also
mischaracterizes this Court's claim construction order, Mr. Long's testimony, and the Tyler
article. Mr. Long, a neutral witness with no interest in the outcome of the case, provided clear
testimony that the FXFE system included features that met all the limitations of claim 19 such as
a broker list that was used to fill in the broker field and a numeric keypad that was used to fill in
the exchange rate field. Mr. Long successfully demonstrated the FXFE system for Mr. Tyler, the
Datamation reporter, with no obligation of confidentiality. This demonstration constituted both a
public use under 0x00A7 102(b) and a reduction to practice under 0x00A7 102(g). Mr. Long's testimony
regarding FXFE is corroborated by the Tyler article which was published contemporaneously
with the relevant events and was written by Michael Tyler, another neutral witness. Thus, the
clear and convincing evidence shows that the asserted claims of the `356 patent are invalid based
on FXFE. Lucent puts forth a multitude of arguments in its attempt to defeat summary
judgment. However, when the Court focuses on Lucent's arguments one at a time, it becomes
clear that none of Lucent's arguments have merit. As discussed below, Lucent has failed to raise
any genuine issue of material fact, and summary judgment should be granted accordingly.

I. LUCENT FAILS TO SHOW A GENUINE ISSUE OF MATERIAL FACT
REGARDING ANTICIPATION UNDER 0x00A7 102(B) AND 0x00A7 102(G)

A. Lucent Misstates The Law Regarding Public Use
Lucent argues that FXFE is not prior art under 0x00A7 102(b) because it was not publicly used.

Lucent Br. at 11. In making this argument, Lucent mischaracterizes the law regarding public
use. Under Federal Circuit precedent, a product demonstration for a reporter with no
confidentiality obligations constitutes a public use under 0x00A7 102(b). See Harrington Mfg. Co. v.
Powell Mfg. Co., 815 F.2d 1478, 1479-80 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In Harrington, Pickett had

demonstrated a mechanized tobacco harvester to a reporter without any confidentiality

obligations more than one year before the filing date of the patent. See id. The Federal Circuit
affirmed summary judgment of invalidity based on this public use. See id. Similarly, the
undisputed evidence shows that the FXFE system was demonstrated for Michael Tyler, a
Datamation reporter, without any confidentiality obligations. Ex. 7 96; Ex. 17 at 113:19-252
Mr. Long's testimony regarding this demonstration is independently corroborated by the
Datamation article, Thus, under Federal Circuit precedent, the FXFE demonstration constitutes a
public use.

Lucent raises several meritless arguments in attempting to negate public use. First,
Lucent argues that evidence regarding a public use must be corroborated. Lucent Br. at 12.
Here, however, Mr. Long's testimony is independently corroborated by the Tyler article.'
Second, Lucent argues that the FXFE demonstration does not constitute a public use because it
was not open to the public. Lucent Br. at 13. However, there is no requirement that a
demonstration must be open to the public in order to constitute a public use. See, e. gZ.,
Harrington, 815 F.2d at 1479-80." Third, Lucent argues that the FXFE demonstration does not
constitute a public use because Mr. Tyler never used the system. Lucent Br. at 13. However,
Mr. Long demonstrated the system for Mr. Tyler, and there is no requirement that Mr. Tyler
must have used the system himself. See Harrington, 815 F.2d at 1479-80 (finding a public use

even though the reporter never used the tobacco harvester himself).0x00B0

 

? All citations to Exs. 1-16 refer to exhibits attached to the Declaration of Jonathan D. Baker submitted on
November 30, 2007 with Gateway's motion for summary judgment, and all citations to Exs. 17-28 refer to exhibits
attached to the Reply Declaration of Jonathan D. Baker submitted concurrently with this reply brief.

3 Lucent also argues that Mr. Long's testimony is suspect because the defendants have failed to produce the
FXFE system or any technical documentation regarding the system. Lucent Br. at 12. However, the FXFE system
was developed more than 23 years ago by a company, Chemical Bank, whose ownership has changed several times
over the past 23 years. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (the current owners of what was once Chemical Bank) was not able
to locate any relevant documents. Exs. 25 & 26. Given that this work was done 23 years ago, it is not surprising
that no documents could be located. Furthermore, the need for technical documentation in this case is minimal
because the remaining claims relate solely to the user interface method, not to the particular software techniques
used to implement it.

* The Bernhardt case provides no support for Lucent's position. In Bernhardt, the Federal Circuit found
that the patentee had a legitimate expectation of confidentiality. See Bernhardt, L.L.C. v. Collezione Europa USA,
Inc., 386 F.3d 1371, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004). In contrast, Chemical Bank had no expectation of confidentiality, and
offered the demonstration for the specific purpose of publicizing the FXFE system. Ex. 7 4] 6; Ex. 17 at 113:19-25.

* The cases that Lucent cites as support for its argument are readily distinguishable. In Moleculon, the
court found no public use because the inventor "never used the puzzle or permitted it used in a place or at a time

Fourth, Lucent argues that the demonstration only involved an experimental version that
was never commercialized. Lucent Br. at 13. However, the Federal Circuit has never required
that a device must be in a fully finished form and commercialized before its use can constitute a
public use. See, e.g., Harrington, 815 F.2d at 1481 ("There is no requirement that an invention
function perfectly in order to be reduced to practice or considered as on sale or in public use,"")
(citations omitted).0x00B0 Fifth, Lucent similarly argues that the defendants cannot rely on the Tyler
article to corroborate the public use of FXFE because the system was allegedly still under
development. Lucent Br. at 14. However, as discussed above, there is no requirement that all

development must be completed before a public use can occur.""

 

when he did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy and of confidentiality." See Moleculon Research Corp. v.
CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (quoting district court). In Motionless Keyboard, the court found
no public use because the device was shown but never actually used. See Motionless Keyboard Co. v. Microsoft
Corp., 486 F.3d 1376, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Finally, in Minnesota Mining, the court found no public use because
there was no evidence that the device had ever been used. See Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc., 303
F.3d 1294, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In contrast, here, the undisputed evidence shows that the FXFE system was used
and that there was no expectation of confidentiality. Ex. 7 | 6; Ex. 17 at 113:19:114:3.

0x00B0 The Federal Circuit has often held that a public use can occur even when the device is a prototype or still
under development. See Harrington, 815 F.2d at 1481 ("Also, the fact that minor modifications were made and a
third prototype built subsequent to the Osborne demonstration does not raise a material issue of fact in this
instance."); Eolas Tech. Inc. v. Microsoft, 399 F.3d 1325, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Netscape Comm. Corp. v. Konrad,
295 F.3d 1315, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Moreover, the two cases cited by Lucent do not support its position. Lucent
cites Motionless Keyboard for the proposition that there was no public use where a computer device was never
connected to be used in the normal course of business. See Motionless Keyboard, 486 F.3d at 1385. However, here
the claimed invention relates solely to the user interface, and the user interface was fully operational during the
demonstration. Ex. 7 46; Ex. 17 at 114:1-19. The lack of a back-end network is completely irrelevant to claims 19
and 21. Similarly, in American Seating, the court found no public use because all of those to whom the invention
was disclosed "would have understood that there was an implied duty of confidentiality." American Seating Co. v.
USSC Group, Inc., 2005 WL 1224603, *5 (W.D. Mich. May 23, 2005). The court's decision was not based in any
way on the fact that the device was a prototype rather than a finished product.

" Lucent asserts that Mr. Long testified that the system was "incomplete". Lucent Br. at 13. Lucent again
mischaracterizes the evidence. Mr. Long never testified that the user interface was incomplete. Rather, he testified
that the FXFE touch screen was connected to a local database rather than to a remote database over a network during
the demonstration. Ex. 17 at 56:19-57:7. But since the claim only relates to the user interface, the lack of a remote
networked database has nothing to do with whether the demonstrated system satisfied the claim limitations.

(R) The Honeywell case provides no support for Lucent's argument because there the court found that the
alleged public demonstration was an experimental use by the inventor for testing purposes. See Honeywell Int'l v.
Universal Avionics Sys. Corp., 488 F.3d 982, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In contrast, the demonstration for Tyler was
indisputably for marketing purposes, not for any experimental purpose. Ex. 7 96, Ex. 17 at 112:23-113:8.
Moreover, the experimental use exception only applies to experiments by the inventor of the patent-in-suit, and not
to experimental uses by an independent third party, such Chemical Bank. See Baxter Int'l, Inc. v. Cobe Labs., Inc.,
88 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding "no reason" to extend experimental use exception to independent third
party prior art).

B. Lucent Has Failed to Come Forward with Evidence of Non-Enablement.

Lucent next argues that the FXFE system and the Tyler article are not enabling. Lucent
Br. at 14. However, Lucent's argument fails for numerous reasons. First, Lucent
mischaracterizes the law of enablement. As the Federal Circuit has explained, there is no
enablement requirement for an invalidating public use under 0x00A7 102(b) or for prior invention
under 0x00A7 102(g). See In re Epstein, 32 F.3d 1559, 1567-68, (Fed. Cir.1994) ("Beyond this `in
public use or on sale' finding, there is no requirement for an enablement-type inquiry."); Mazzari
v, Rogan, 323 F.3d 1000, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("To establish an actual reduction to practice, an
inventor must prove that he constructed his claimed invention and that it would work for its
intended purpose."). Similarly, there is no enablement requirement for obviousness under 0x00A7 103.
See Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 314 F.3d 1313, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2003)
("enablement of the prior art is not a requirement to prove invalidity under 0x00A7 103."), Moreover,
Lucent presents no evidence showing a lack of enablement, as Lucent's own expert, does not
assert that FXFE and the Tyler article are not enabling. Indeed, Lucent's expert made clear
during his deposition that what was allegedly new about the patent was its functionality, while its

implementation was just basic "computer science 101." Ex. 28 at 64:25-65:22.

Cc. Lucent Has Failed To Show A Genuine Issue Of Material Fact Regarding
The FXFE System Meeting Every Limitation of Claim 19.

1. The Undisputed Evidence Confirms That The FXFE System
Indicated The Selected Field.

Lucent argues that the FXFE system does not indicate a particular field into which
information is to be inserted. Lucent Br. at 15. However, Lucent does not point to any evidence
that contradicts Mr. Long's testimony that the FXFE system highlighted the selected field.
Specifically, Mr. Long explained that when the user selected a field the "label itself would be
highlighted" and "[t]he field would be highlighted next to it." Ex. 17 at 106:2-6. Mr. Long also
explained that the system provided such feedback because "it was important for the trader to
know that the field that he thought he'd selected had actually been selected by the application."
Id, at 206:13-18. Mr. Long's testimony regarding the FXFE system is corroborated by the Tyler

article which clearly shows that the system provided visual feedback by highlighting selected

items. Ex. 18; Ex. 4 at 50; Ex. 17 at 106:21-107:1. Under Federal Circuit precedent, complete
corroboration is not required for every single aspect of a claim. See Knorr v. Pearson, 671 F.2d
1368, 1374 (C.C.P.A. 1982) ("The law does not impose an impossible standard of
`independence' on corroborative evidence by requiring that every point . . . be corroborated by
evidence having a source totally independent of the inventor.").'

To avoid summary judgment, Lucent also resorts to attacking the character of third-party
witnesses such as Mr. Long. Importantly, however, Lucent cannot point to any contrary
evidence that rebuts, contradicts, or impeaches any of his testimony. The law is clear that Lucent
cannot create a genuine issue of material fact by arguing about a witness? credibility or bias."
Lucent must first establish through contrary evidence that there is some factual dispute."
Because Lucent has no such evidence, it cannot avoid summary judgment by simply impugning
Mr. Long's character. Moreover, Lucent attacks Mr. Long's credibility because Gateway is
reimbursing him for his reasonable time and expenses. As a skilled professional, it is entirely
appropriate for Mr. Long to be compensated for his time and expenses whether as a consultant or
a fact witness. Both the Federal Rules and U.S. Code expressly contemplate the reasonable
compensation of witnesses for their time. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B); 18 U.S.C.

 

? Lucent incorrectly asserts that corroborating evidence must unambiguously support all elements of the
patents-in-suit. Lucent Br. at 15. Lucent is simply mistaken regarding the law of corroboration. There is no need to
corroborate "every factual issue contested by the parties." Cooper v. Goldfarb, 154 F.3d 1321, 1330 (Fed. Cir.
1998); Mann v. Werner, 347 F.2d 636, 640 (CCPA 1965) ("This court has rejected the notion that each individual
act in the reduction to practice of a count must be proved in detail by an unbroken chain of corroboration.").
Instead, corroboration must be determined based on the totality of the circumstances. See Adenta GmbH v.
OrthoArm, Inc., 501 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("Assessing the sufficiency of evidence which corroborates a
witness's testimony concerning invalidating activities... involves an assessment of the totality of the circumstances
including an evaluation of all pertinent evidence."). The Finnigan case cited by Lucent is not to the contrary. In
Finnigan, the Federal Circuit simply found that "there was no evidence corroborative of [the witness's] testimony at
all." See Finnigan Corp. v. ITC, 180 F.3d 1354, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

'0x00B0 National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 701 F.2d 95, 97 (9 Cir. 1983) (non-movant cannot
avoid summary judgment by merely undermining credibility of witnesses who are allegedly biased and who have
interests aligned with movant).

"' Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256-57 (1986) ("discredited testimony is not [normally]
considered a sufficient basis for drawing a contrary conclusion,' Instead, the plaintiff must present affirmative
evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." (citation omitted).

own consultants and fact witnesses for their time.'3

2. Claim 19 Does Not Require That The Composition Tool Must Be
Generated By The Application Program.

Lucent argues that FXFE and the Tyler article do not have "predefined tools" because
there is no indication whether the on-screen keyboard is provided by an application program or
by the operating system. Lucent Br. at 16-17. However, nothing in the claim or the specification
requires these method steps to be performed by an application program rather than by an
operating system. In any event, the undisputed evidence shows that the keyboard and number
pad tool were both specified by the FXFE application and not by the underlying operating
system. Ex, 17 at 110:12-111:19; Ex. 7 13. Lucent also inexplicably argues that FXFE did not
associate any tools with information fields. Lucent Br. at 17. However, Mr. Long clearly
explained that when the "Broker" field was selected, the broker list tool was automatically
displayed. Ex. 17 at 105:21-109:9; Ex. 7911-12. Similarly, when the "Exchange Rate" field
was selected, the numeric keypad was automatically displayed. Jd. The Tyler article fully

corroborates Mr. Long's testimony. Ex. 4 at 49.

3. Claim 19 Does Not Require That The Composition Tool Be Displayed
In A Bitmap Mode.

Lucent argues that the FXFE system did not have a graphical composition tool because
the on-screen number pad was drawn in an alphanumeric mode rather than in a bitmap mode.
Lucent Br. at 18. Lucent's argument fails for several reasons. First, the phrase "graphical" in
the Court's construction simply means that the keypad was drawn on the screen, as opposed to
being a physical keypad. Nothing in the Court's construction requires that the on-screen keypad
be created using bitmap graphics rather than alphanumeric graphics. As Mr. Long testified, the

on-screen keypad was generated by drawing the label for each key and drawing a box around

the time spent providing testimony in deposition or at trial."); Centennial Mgmt. Serv., dnc. v. Axa Re Vie, 193
F.R.D. 671, 679 (D. Kan. 2000) (witness may be compensated for the reasonable value of his time).
