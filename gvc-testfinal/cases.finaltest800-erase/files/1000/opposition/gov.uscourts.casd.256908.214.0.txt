Contrary to Lucent’s assertions in its ex parte motion, Mr. Tyler’s deposition testimony

2

provides even further corroboration showing that the FXFE system and the Tyler article

3

invalidate the remaining claims of the Day ‘356 patent. As explained below, Lucent’s arguments

4

to the contrary are either legally irrelevant or directly contrary to Mr. Tyler’s actual testimony.1

ARGUMENT
A.

7

Lucent’s Arguments Regarding Mr. Tyler’s Testimony Are Either Legally
Irrelevant Or Directly Contrary To Mr. Tyler’s Actual Testimony.

Lucent argues that Mr. Tyler’s testimony shows that the FXFE system was not publicly
8
used in the United States because the demonstration was allegedly private. However, even if the
9
demonstration were private in the sense that it was not open to the general public, that does not
10
negate a public use. A demonstration for a reporter without confidentiality obligations constitutes
11
a public use even if the demonstration is not open to the general public. See Harrington Mfg. Co.
12
v. Powell Mfg. Co., 815 F.2d 1478, 1480-81 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In Harrington, for example, the
13
demonstration of the tobacco harvester was for the reporter and not the general public. Id. at
14
1480. Nonetheless, the Federal Circuit held that this was a public use and affirmed the grant of
15
summary judgment accordingly. Id. at 1480-81. Here, Mr. Tyler specifically explained that even
16
though he was the only reporter present at the Chemical Bank demonstration, “they certainly
17
knew full well that the only purpose of my doing so was that I was reporting a story that would be
18

published in a national magazine.” Ex. 29 at 59:6-14.2

19
Lucent also argues that the Chemical Bank demonstration was not a public use because it
20
involved only a beta test version. However, even if the FXFE system were a beta test version,
21
that fact would be legally irrelevant to the public use inquiry. The relevant question is whether
22
the system that was demonstrated successfully performed the claimed method steps. Here, the
23
unrebutted evidence from Mr. Long, from Mr. Tyler, and from the Tyler article all consistently
24
confirm that the FXFE system performed each of the claimed method steps and operated
25
successfully. Ex. 29 at 130:4-137:23, 152:6-23. The fact that portions of the FXFE system were

still being tested is simply irrelevant. See Harrington, 815 F.2d at 1481 (“Also, the fact that

2

minor modifications were made and a third prototype built subsequent to the Osborne

3

demonstration does not raise a material issue of fact in this instance. The prototype that Pickett

4

demonstrated to Osborne clearly fell within the scope of claim 8 of the Pickett patent.”).

5

Next, Lucent argues that Mr. Tyler did not review any code, see the back-end network, or

6

personally operate the FXFE system. Again, each of these arguments are legally irrelevant.

7

Claim 19 is a method claim for a user interface. As such, Mr. Tyler did not need to review any

8

source code to see that the on-screen tools performed the claimed method steps. Similarly, Mr.

9

Tyler did not need to view the back-end network that actually carried out the currency trades

10

because claim 19 relates solely to the user interface. This claim does not require any back-end

11

network. Finally, a public use does not require the reporter to actually operate the prior art device

12

himself. See Harrington, 815 F.2d at 1480-81 (finding a public use even though the reporter

13

never used the tobacco harvester himself).

14

Next, Lucent asserts that Mr. Tyler allegedly admitted that his article discusses the Easel

15

toolkit rather than the FXFE system. On the contrary, Mr. Tyler specifically testified that the

16

article described both the Easel toolkit and the FXFE system. Ex. 29 at 63:5-8. Moreover, at

17

Lucent’s request, Mr. Tyler circled those portions of the article that discuss the FXFE system. Id.

18

at 73:14-74:18.3 Next, Lucent asserts some unspecified inconsistency between Mr. Tyler’s

19

testimony and Mr. Long’s testimony regarding the difference between the Easel toolkit and

20

Chemical Bank’s FXFE system which was built using the Easel toolkit. However, Lucent has

21

failed to identify any such inconsistency. Moreover, even if there were a difference, any such

22

difference would be legally irrelevant because the relevant legal question is simply whether the

23

demonstrated system successfully performed the claimed method steps. It does not matter what

24

functionality was built into Easel and what functionality Chemical Bank had to develop

25

themselves. Here, the undisputed evidence shows that the FXFE system, which was built using

Lucent’s ex parte application included only selected portions of Mr. Tyler’s deposition
testimony. In view of the Court’s decision to grant Lucent’s request for supplementation of
the record, for fairness, Gateway requests that the Court also consider those additional
portions of the transcript cited by Gateway.

Mr. Tyler’s Testimony Actually Provides Even Further Corroboration
Regarding The FXFE System.

Contrary to Lucent’s assertions, Mr. Tyler’s testimony actually provides even further
4
corroboration for Mr. Long’s testimony regarding the FXFE system. In particular, Mr. Tyler
5
confirmed that:
6
1.

The FXFE system displayed information fields and labels. Ex. 29 at 130:4-

7
132:16.
8
2.

The FXFE system provided a visual indication of the selected field. Id. at 132:18-

3.

The FXFE system automatically displayed a list of brokers when the user selected

9
133:4.
10
11
the ‘Broker’ field, and then inserted and displayed the selected broker name in the ‘Broker’ field
12
in response to the user’s selection of a name from that list. Id. at 132:18-133:14.
13
4.

The FXFE system automatically displayed a numeric keypad when the user

14
selected the ‘Exchange Rate’ field, and then inserted and displayed the number entered by the
15
user using the keypad in the “Exchange Rate” field. Id. at 135:14-137:10.
16
5.

These user interface features worked properly during the demonstration. Id. at

17
152:6-23, 167:6-13.
18
6.

The FXFE system was demonstrated without any confidentiality obligations and

19
with Chemical Bank’s knowledge that he was going to write an article about the operation of the
20
system. Id. at 149:10-150:16.
21
Mr. Tyler’s testimony therefore provides even further corroboration showing that the
22
FXFE system described in the Tyler article met each of the limitations of claim 19, and was
23
publicly demonstrated more than one year before the filing date of the ‘356 patent. Lucent has
24
failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact, and Gateway’s motion for summary judgment
25

should therefore be granted.4

Gateway also objects to Lucent’s untimely disclosure of Robert Jones and Lucent’s reliance on
his declaration in support of its opposition to Microsoft’s summary judgment motion.
