Re:

Nicosia v.United States of America
No. 11-CV-5069 (Seybert, J.) (Brown, M.J.)

Dear Judge Seybert:
The undersigned represents defendant, the United States of America (“Defendant”), in the
above-referenced matter. On May 9, 2013, plaintiff’s counsel notified the Court and the
undersigned that plaintiff Marianne Nicosia had passed away on January 3, 2013. See Docket Entry
22. Counsel stated that he would forward a copy of the Death Certificate upon his receipt of same
and that plaintiff’s daughter was meeting with counsel on May 22, 2013 to proceed with a Petition
for Letters Testamentary. See id.
To date – close to five months after counsel notified the Court of plaintiff’s passing and
close to nine months since plaintiff actually passed away – counsel has not filed a motion for
substitution of a proper party. Because no timely motion for substitution of a proper party has been
filed, Defendant respectfully requests that this action be dismissed, with prejudice, pursuant to Fed.
R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1) (“If the motion is not made within 90 days after service of a statement noting the
death, the action by or against the decedent must be dismissed.” (Emphasis added)).
We thank the Court for its attention to this matter.
Respectfully submitted,
LORETTA E. LYNCH
United States Attorney
