I.

2

Defendants are wrong that SpeedTrack’s lawsuit is foreclosed by “at least three” principles

3

of preclusion. Not one of these Defendants has ever obtained a prior judgment against SpeedTrack,

4

and no one—not these Defendants or any other party from any earlier suit—has ever litigated or

5

resolved the critical question presented here: whether the methods uniquely practiced by these

6

Defendants infringe SpeedTrack’s ’360 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. Endeca and

7

Walmart had every occasion to litigate the “equivalents” issue for the methods practiced in the

8

Walmart action, but they deliberately resisted at every turn and left the issue unadjudicated.

INTRODUCTION

This suit involves the unique search methods practiced by four Defendants who were not

10

parties to the Walmart action; the infringement theory is not against Endeca’s software itself, which

11

cannot perform any methods without Defendants’ hardware, software, and data. This suit involves

12

different activities, different transactional facts, new evidence, untested legal theories, novel (and

13

fundamental) questions of patent law, and multiple issues that were not, and could not have been,

14

before the Court in the Walmart action—and have never been litigated (much less resolved) in any

15

court. There is no such thing as absolute, blanket immunity for new parties accused of performing

16

new and different acts in a new suit. Defendants may prefer not to litigate any of these issues, but

17

they cannot wish the Walmart action into something it was not—nor can they avoid required

18

elements of res judicata (claim preclusion) or collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) in the process.

19

In short, Defendants are wrong that Walmart’s disposition—a judgment on literal

20

infringement for Walmart’s and Endeca’s unique implementation of Endeca’s software in that

21

period—precludes SpeedTrack’s claims for doctrine-of-equivalents infringement involving different

22

users, methods, websites, software, and time periods—all different transactional facts. The absence

23

of common parties and identical claims renders res judicata inapplicable; the absence of identical

24

“issues of fact and law” dooms collateral estoppel, which prevents the re-litigation (not initial

25

litigation) of settled issues from prior suits. The key facts and issues are new, and Defendants’

26

motion should be denied.

The “Walmart action” refers to SpeedTrack, Inc. v. Walmart Stores, Inc., et. al., Case No. C-067336 PJH and 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 7551 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

II.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Defendants have failed to show that the Kessler doctrine, res judicata, or collateral estoppel

applies or that summary judgment is warranted.
A. Kessler Doctrine: In their original motion to dismiss, Defendants said that the Kessler

5

doctrine barred SpeedTrack’s suit as a theory of “collateral estoppel.” Mot. 2, 22. Defendants now

6

change course and assert that Kessler is a form of “res judicata.” According to Defendants, the

7

Walmart action “attached” certain rights to Endeca’s software, and Kessler thereby immunizes that

8

“software” in any subsequent suit. This is wrong on multiple fronts. The Federal Circuit has

9

explicitly rejected Defendants’ notion that Kessler presents some expansive form of “res judicata.”

10

On the contrary, Kessler represents a specific application of non-mutual collateral estoppel at a time

11

before courts recognized that doctrine. MGA, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 827 F.2d 729, 733-34

12

(Fed. Cir. 1987). It adds nothing beyond Defendants’ collateral estoppel argument, which is

13

presumably why the Federal Circuit has applied Kessler effectively once in its past thirty years of

14

published decisions. Defendants recognized these limits when they filed their initial motion, and

15

their abrupt departure now (which they never acknowledge) is telling.

16

In any event, Kessler has been inapplicable on these facts for (literally) a full century. In

17

Rubber Tire Wheel Co. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 232 U.S. 413, 419 (1914), the Supreme

18

Court limited Kessler to situations where a standalone product was adjudicated non-infringing, and

19

that same standalone product is later sold to a customer; Kessler has no role where the manufacturer

20

supplies a component combined by someone else with other components to create some new product

21

accused of infringement. It is undisputed here that each Defendant combines a different version of

22

the Endeca software with other components supplied by Defendants, including software, hardware,

23

and data, and the resulting system is used to perform the accused, claimed methods (searching for

24

files). Even assuming Kessler applies to method patents at all, it does not apply where the method

25

extends beyond the standalone product at issue in the first suit.

26
27
28

B. Res Judicata: There is no identity of parties and claims in the earlier and later actions,
and thus no res judicata.
There Is No Privity: Because Defendants were not parties to the Walmart action,

SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION RE RES JUDICATA

Case 4:07-cv-03602-PJH Document 100 Filed 01/08/14 Page 9 of 32

1

Defendants invoke the “adequate representation” exception to establish privity. But there is no

2

“adequate representation” for purposes of res judicata unless the parties understand that they are

3

representing each other, or the court uses specific procedures to protect non-party interests (e.g.,

4

class actions). Defendants fail to establish either condition. Defendants are wrong that a mere

5

indemnification agreement is sufficient to establish privity.

6

.
This Action Involves a Different Set of Transactional Facts: SpeedTrack could not have

11

raised these claims against these Defendants in the Walmart action, as required for res judicata.

12

This suit involves different defendants, methods, websites, acts of infringement, source code (a

13

different version for each Defendant), implementations of Endeca’s software, and (once again) new

14

legal and factual issues. The most that the earlier action determined was that the version of

15

Endeca’s software, as implemented by Walmart and Endeca, did not literally infringe. Given the

16

strict focus on transactional facts among the claims raised in the two lawsuits, even a suit against

17

Walmart itself for identical post-judgment activity—operating the identical software on the identical

18

website—would escape res judicata. The governing standard asks whether the particular facts in

19

the suit are the same—and neither Walmart’s conduct nor Endeca’s conduct is identical to the

20

methods practiced by Walmart’s competitors in independently operating their own websites. The

21

different methods practiced by Defendants and Walmart dooms the res judicata defense.

22
23
24

C. Collateral Estoppel: Defendants’ collateral estoppel defense fails because the identical
issues were not actually litigated or resolved in any earlier suit.
Equivalents Infringement Is a Separate Issue From Literal Infringement: “Equivalents”

25

infringement and literal infringement have different elements and are legally distinct. They

26

represent two different doctrines, involve entirely different factors (legally and factually), and are

27

recognized as separate issues by the courts. Collateral estoppel is designed to preclude the re-

28

litigation of identical issues, and it focuses on issues at a micro-level of granularity, element by

1

element. This is not res judicata’s test for the identity of parties and the existence of the same

2

operative facts.

3

Equivalents Infringement Was Not Litigated in the Walmart Action: The Walmart action

4

did not address or resolve the doctrine of equivalents. In fact, Walmart and Endeca succeeded in

5

removing that issue from consideration. A core dispute between the parties before this Court and

6

later the Federal Circuit was whether SpeedTrack could amend its infringement contentions to press

7

“equivalents.” The Walmart defendants successfully resisted SpeedTrack’s efforts, chiefly because

8

it would introduce too many new legal and factual questions into the case. It is impossible to read

9

the judgment as adjudicating an issue that was excluded from the suit. Because equivalents

10

infringement was not litigated in the Walmart action, there can be no collateral estoppel here.

11

III.

12

FACTUAL STATEMENT
In discussing the factual background, Defendants omit many material points and spin a host

13

of inferences in their favor. Rather than tax the Court’s limited resources with a full response to

14

each error, SpeedTrack submits this short statement underscoring the main facts relevant to this

15

motion.

16
17

1. This suit and the Walmart action involve different parties, and Defendants suggest no
basis to connect themselves to Endeca or Walmart, aside from being indemnified by Endeca.

18

2. Defendants assert that SpeedTrack withheld its claims under the “doctrine of equivalents”

19

in the Walmart action as a tactical strategy. But Defendants never mention that the Walmart action

20

proceeded for years on the parties’ shared assumption that numeric identifiers, as used in the file-

21

information directory, were “category descriptions” under the Markman order. This factual premise

22

shaped the parties’ filings in court and the PTO, until the defendants switched positions nearly three

23

years after discovery had closed. As this Court recognized, SpeedTrack had no reason to consider

24

“equivalents” infringement until that time. (Order 1:23-2:2; Walmart ECF No. 357; Exh. 1 ) (the

25

switch was plaintiff’s “first… reason to know of its need to amend its infringement contentions”).

Case 4:07-cv-03602-PJH Document 100 Filed 01/08/14 Page 11 of 32

1

forcefully resisted SpeedTrack’s efforts—and ultimately succeeded in removing the “equivalents”

2

issue from the litigation. As a primary factor for refusing to permit SpeedTrack’s new claim, the

3

Court agreed with Walmart and Endeca (Exh. 2 at 9-10), holding that the new issue would likely

4

require “reopening discovery,” “create new grounds upon which plaintiff could again seek a

5

dispositive ruling before trial,” and thus “increase the scope of litigation.” (Exh. 1 at 2:10-16).

6

4. In granting summary judgment in Walmart, the Court followed the moving papers by

7

limiting its discussion to literal infringement. (Walmart ECF No. 358, at 15:12-18; Exh. 3).

8

5. The final judgment likewise was limited to literal infringement. (Exh. 4).

9

6. In this new suit, SpeedTrack has asserted infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

10

with respect to the “category descriptions” contained in the accused file information directories. All

11

of the asserted claims of the ’360 patent are method claims (independent claims 1 and 20).

12

7. Defendants have not shown that Walmart used the same Endeca software that is accused

13

here. Defendants have not established that Walmart used the same version(s) during the time period

14

in dispute in the Walmart action or even that each Defendant is now running the same Endeca

15

software. To the contrary, PC Connection first implemented Endeca version 3.2 or 3.3 and now

16

runs version 6.1.4. (Young Depo., at 79:15-80:7; Exh. 5). Newegg currently uses version 6.3.5.

17

(Wang Depo., at 26:24-27:14; Exh. 6). Office Depot first implemented version 4.6 and now runs

18

version 6.1. (Peter Depo., at 32:14-23; Exh. 7). CDW first implemented version 3.4 and now runs

19

version 6.2. (Lazar Depo., at 15:10-16:13; Exh. 8).

3

20

8. As provided to customers, the Endeca software does nothing by itself. Without more, it
4

21

cannot allow an end user to navigate or search for products sold on a website. To operate as

22

intended, each Defendant must first install its version of the Endeca software on its own hardware

23

and operate it using each Defendant’s unique data. Each Defendant implements Endeca’s platform

5

24
3

25
26

Defendants are mistaken (Mot. 19) that SpeedTrack “accuses” the “same ‘Endeca Information
Access Platform’ that SpeedTrack accused in the Walmart case.” The software does not infringe;
Defendants’ use of that software infringes. (Am. Cplt., ECF No. 61, at ¶¶ 17-19; 32-34; 47-49 and
62-64; Exh. 18). That “use” here involves different Defendants at different times.

in its own way; the use of the Endeca software at issue here is thus not the “exact same” as its use

2

in Walmart.

3

9. A simple example highlights some of the differences between each Defendants’

4

implementation of Endeca’s software. Each Defendant sells the identical product on its website: a

5

Western Digital 1 TB portable hard drive, WDBK8A0010BBK-NESN. Using different versions of

6

Endeca’s software, each Defendant uses different hardware, software, and data to create its own

7

unique product record for that same hard drive—with different “PROP NAMEs” (i.e., property

8

names), “PVALs” (i.e., property values),” DIMENSION_IDs,” and “IDs.” (See Exhs. 9 (PC

9

Connection); 10 (Newegg); 11 (Office Depot); and 12 (CDW)). These differences reflect the

10

differences in how each Defendant implements its Endeca software in its own unique way. Further,

11

end users navigate to that same hard drive differently on each Defendants’ website. (See Exhs. 13

12

(PC Connection); 14 (Newegg); 15 (Office Depot), and 16 (CDW)). Lastly, screen shots of

13

Walmart’s website, submitted in the Walmart action, show that Walmart’s navigation functionality

14

was different from each Defendants’ navigation methods here (See Block Decl.; ECF No. 325, at ¶¶

15

59-71; Exh. 17).

16

10. Defendants have not shown that each Defendant implements Endeca’s software the way

17

that Walmart implemented Endeca’s software. Nor have Defendants shown that the “numeric

18

fields” are always numeric in each Defendants’ implementation. Defendants’ evidence is limited to

19

product records showing the use of Endeca’s software for a different product (See Exhs. B-E to the

20

Decl. of Joel Cavanaugh; ECF 70-1), and employee declarations. In those declarations, each

21

employee provides the identical statement regarding the “numeric fields” in a binary file that each

22

has converted to a human-readable form: “To my knowledge, [Defendant] does not change the

23

format of the identified numeric fields in the Endeca file(s) identified above to be anything other

24

than numeric.” (See Young Decl., at ¶6; Wang Decl., at ¶6; Peter Decl., at ¶6; Lazar Decl., at ¶6).

For example, Defendant Newegg creates its own Dimension Value IDs (the numerical identifiers)
(Wang Depo., at 54:20-56:18; Exh. 6), whereas other Defendants do not.

These identical statements lack foundation. The file is used in a non-human readable format, and

therefore none of these employees could have known what the software actually does or what is in

ARGUMENT

5

A.

6

Summary judgment is appropriate only “where there is no genuine issue of material fact and

Summary Judgment Standards

7

the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” SRI Int’l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am.,

8

775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (en banc). At this stage, “[c]redibility determinations, the

9

weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not

10

those of a judge, whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict.”

11

Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). Courts view evidence in the light most

12

favorable to the non-movant and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant. Id.

13

Defendants have failed to meet each part of this exacting standard.

14

B.

SpeedTrack’s Suit Is Not Barred by the Kessler Doctrine
1.

15
16

Kessler Only Reiterates Defendants’ (Failed) Collateral-Estoppel Defense

According to Defendants, the Walmart action “attached” certain rights to Endeca’s software,

17

and Kessler thereby immunizes that software’s use by any customer—apparently as a sweeping

18

form of “res judicata.” That is wrong. Just months earlier, Defendants recognized that Kessler was

19

“a theory of ‘defensive collateral estoppel,’” nothing more. (Mot. 22; ECF 70). Defendants may

20

now prefer to recast the doctrine as something else, but their first choice was the right one.

21

Indeed, Defendants’ new characterization is squarely at odds with controlling law. The

22

Federal Circuit has already held that Kessler is merely an application of “defensive collateral

23

estoppel.” MGA, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 827 F.2d 729, (Fed. Cir. 1987). Because Kessler is cut

24

from the same cloth as collateral estoppel, it adds nothing that is not already available under that

25

doctrine. Defendants’ failure to prove collateral estoppel thus proves their failure under Kessler.

1

Defendants’ aggressive use of Kessler is wrong in any event. As Defendants see it, this new

2

immunity sweeps past and is broader than every preclusion doctrine. It goes beyond res judicata,

3

because it applies even to products arising after the initial suit was concluded and irrespective of

4

privity. It goes beyond collateral estoppel, because it sweeps past the issues litigated in the first suit,

5

apparently foreclosing any future litigation over the “rights” to sell the product. Indeed, according

6

to Defendants, Endeca’s customers would have broader rights from the Walmart suit than Endeca

7

itself—since Endeca would presumably remain subject to ordinary rules of res judicata and

8

collateral estoppel. The Supreme Court has already cautioned against presuming any departures

9

from ordinary legal principles in cases arising under the Patent Act. eBay Inc. v. MercExchange,

10

L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391-92 (2006). Yet Defendants’ view of Kessler would set up a direct conflict

11

with controlling preclusion doctrine in every circuit, and would stand out of step with the Federal

12

Circuit’s views in MGA. Defendants’ (ever-shifting) theory is indefensible and should be rejected.

13

2.

14

Kessler Is Inapplicable When the Customer Combines the Manufactured
Product With Other Components

Contrary to Defendants’ contention, Kessler has no role here. Under Kessler, when a

15
16

manufacturer proves that its product does not infringe, it secures a limited right to sell that product

17

to customers (and for customers to purchase that product) without interference from the patentee.

18

Kessler v. Eldred, 206 U.S. 285, 289-90 (1907). Kessler, however, is limited to situations, unlike

19

here, where the manufacturer sells a standalone product (e.g., a cigar lighter) that was found not to

20

infringe a product claim; it does not apply where, as here, the manufacturer (e.g., Endeca) sells a

21

component (e.g., Endeca software) that a customer later combines with other components (e.g., each

22

customer’s own hardware, software, and data) into a new product—and that new, combined product

23

allegedly infringes a product claim (much less a method claim). Rubber Tire., 232 U.S. at 419.9

24

In Rubber Tire, Goodyear won a verdict that Rubber Tire’s Grant patent was invalid (the

25

Supreme Court later upheld the patent’s validity in another case). Rubber Tire, 232 U.S. at 414-15.

26

The Grant patent claimed a tire having three components, one of which was a rubber tire with a

certain shape. Id. at 415. After Goodyear established invalidity, it sold rubber to customers who

2

used Goodyear’s rubber—combined with other components from other parties—to manufacture a

3

complete tire. Id. at 416. Rubber Tire sued those customers for infringing the Grant patent by

4

selling tires with Goodyear’s rubber and non-Goodyear components. Id., 414. In response to those

5

lawsuits, Goodyear sought an injunction, under Kessler, prohibiting Rubber Tire from suing any

6

Goodyear customer for infringing the Grant patent. The lower courts granted the injunction. Id.

7

The Supreme Court, however, reversed, allowing Rubber Tire to sue Goodyear’s customers.

8

The Court limited Kessler to instances where the patent owner sued customers for buying, using, or

9

reselling the patented article (e.g., the lighter claimed in the patent-in-suit) that was declared non-

10

infringing in the patent owner’s original lawsuit against the manufacturer. Rubber Tire, 232 U.S. at

11

418 (“Under the doctrine of Kessler v. Eldred, the respondent [Goodyear]—by reason of the final

12

adjudication in its favor—was entitled to make and sell the Grant structure, and to have those who

13

bought that structure from it unmolested in taking title and in enjoying the rights of ownership.”).

14

The Court further held, however, that Kessler was inapplicable when a manufacturer

15

combines one component from the patent owner with other components to produce a new product:

16
17
18

[W]hen other persons become manufacturers on their own behalf, assembling the
various elements and uniting them so as to produce the patented device—a new
article—it is manifest that the respondent cannot insist upon their being protected
from suit for infringement by reason merely of its right to make and sell, and the fact
of its having made and sold, some component part of that article.

1

is not a standalone product, it cannot infringe by itself, and each Defendant combines the software

2

with its own unique components—hardware, software, and data—to perform the claimed methods:

3

(1) the claims here and in Walmart are method claims, which are “directly infringed only

4

when the process is performed.” Joy Techs., Inc. v. Flakt, Inc., 6 F.3d 770, 773 (Fed. Cir. 1993);

5
6

(2) Endeca licenses its software to Defendants but supplies nothing else (hardware, software,
or data) (See e.g., Section III, paragraph 8, supra);

7

(3) Endeca’s software alone cannot perform the patented methods. For example, claim 1

8

requires the creation of a category description table with category descriptions, a file information

9

directory, and a search filter used to locate files. Endeca’s software has none of these structures or

10

data. Without components to perform searches, Endeca’s software itself cannot infringe the claimed

11

methods. Ricoh Co. v. Quanta Computer Inc., 550 F.3d 1325, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (“a party that

12

sells or offers to sell software containing instructions to perform a patented method does not infringe

13

the patent under § 271(a)”); Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.S. 437, 446 (2007); and

14

(4) Each defendant implements Endeca’s software by combining the software with its own

15

servers, software, and data—none provided by Endeca—to perform the patented search for files.

16

(See e.g., Section III, paragraphs 8-9, supra)

17

This proves Defendants’ error in asserting that Endeca’s software is a standalone product

18

that was itself adjudicated not to infringe (Mot. 16). The Court never determined that Endeca’s

19

software did not infringe a method claim, nor could it have. In Walmart, Walmart and Endeca

20

moved for summary judgment that “Walmart.com does not directly infringe the asserted claims. . . .”

21

(Mot. for Summ. Judg., Doc. 322, at 8:19-20; emphasis added; Exh. 19). The Court addressed only

22

Walmart.com’s system in its order. (ECF 358, See, e.g., 10:21-11:44; 14:1-7; 14:20-15:11; 16:5-9;

23

Exh. 3). Walmart.com’s system includes Walmart.com’s hardware, software, and data; Endeca’s

24

software alone cannot infringe method claims. Ricoh, 550 F.3d at 1335; Microsoft, 540 U.S. at 446.

25

In any event, SpeedTrack does not accuse the Endeca software, standing alone, of infringement in

26

this case (just as it did not in the Walmart action). (See Exhs. 18 and 29).

1

Defendants’ motion under Kessler fails for two extra reasons. First, Defendants, as Endeca

2

customers, lack standing to invoke Kessler. Kessler involved a manufacturer, not a customer; it

3

obtained relief to enforce its own prior judgment. No court has held that customers have standing to

4

enforce another party’s judgment. See Kessler, 206 U.S. at 289 (reserving this question); Tech.

Court, Federal Circuit, and Ninth Circuits…have declined to address the issue of whether the

7

customer has the right to invoke the Kessler doctrine as a defense to patent infringement suits.”).

8
9

Second, by invoking Kessler, Defendants seek to enjoin SpeedTrack from prosecuting this
action.10 Yet, Defendants never establish the necessary elements for injunctive relief: (1) they have

10

not suffered irreparable injury; (2) legal remedies are adequate to compensate for any injury; (3) the

11

balance of hardships between Defendants and SpeedTrack tips in favor of SpeedTrack; and (4) the

12

public interest is disserved by a permanent injunction forever barring the enforcement of a valid

13

patent. Shoom, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114354, *5 (quoting eBay, 547 U.S. at 391).
C.

14
15

SpeedTrack’s Suit—Against New Defendants For Their Own Activities On
Their Own Websites—Is Not Barred By Res Judicata, As It Involves Different
Parties And Different Transactional Facts

Defendants cannot satisfy two core elements of res judicata: (i) these parties and those in

16
17

Walmart are not “identical or in privity”; and (ii) the two actions do not involve “the same claim or

18

cause of action.” Gillig v. Nike, Inc., 602 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (internal quotation

19

marks omitted); Jet, Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Sys., 223 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (same).
1.

20

Defendants Have Failed To Prove Privity

Res judicata requires a perfect identity of parties or their privies. Jet, Inc., 223 F.3d at 1362.

21
22

None of Defendants were parties to the Walmart action. Therefore, res judicata requires each

23

Defendant to prove privity with Endeca, who was a party in Walmart. Privity is a “discrete

24

exception” in “limited circumstances” to the rule that “one is not bound by a judgment in personam

25

in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by

26

service of process.” Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 893, 898 (2008) (quoting Hansberry v. Lee,

27
28

10

Kessler granted an anti-suit injunction, an equitable remedy, because Kessler lacked an adequate
remedy at law. See 206 U.S. at 290.

311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940)). Defendants do not fit within this limited exception.

2

a)

3

The Court in Kessler Did Not Hold that Privity is Satisfied Simply
By a Customer’s Use of the Product at Issue

According to Defendants, Kessler held that, “in patent cases, the privity element is satisfied

4
5

simply by a customer’s use of the product at issue” (Mot. 15); because “it is the identity of the

6

product that matters…[,] res judicata does not require any written contract between the

7

manufacturer and its customer” for privity. (Mot. 17). Even putting aside that there is no identity of

8

parties here, Defendants’ expansive reading of Kessler is wrong. Kessler explicitly disclaimed any

9

decision on privity or any other paramount right bestowed on the articles themselves: “Whether the

10

judgment between Kessler and Eldred is a bar to the suit of Eldred v. Breitweiser, either because

11

Breitweiser was a privy to the original judgment, or because the articles themselves were by that

12

judgment freed from the control of the that patent, we deem it unnecessary to inquire.” 206 U.S. at

13

612-13; see also MGA, 827 F.3d at 734.11

14

Further, Defendants’ interpretation of Kessler conflicts with controlling Federal Circuit law:

15

“a manufacturer or seller of a product who is sued for patent infringement typically is not in privity

16

with a party, otherwise unrelated, who does no more than purchase and use the product.”

17

Transclean Corp. v. Jiffy Lube Int’l, Inc., 474 F.3d 1298, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
b)

18

Defendants Cannot Prove a Qualifying “Adequate Relationship”

Defendants also rely (Mot. 17) upon two exceptions in Taylor to attempt to establish privity,

19
20

but neither applies: there was no “adequate representation” or “preexisting substantive legal

21

relationship.”
Under the “adequate representation” exception, “‘in certain limited circumstances,’ a

22
23

nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was ‘adequately represented by someone with

24

the same interests who [wa]s a party.’” Taylor, 553 U.S. at 894 (quoting Richards v. Jefferson

25
11

26
27
28

Defendants cite Tech. Licensing, 738 F. Supp. 2d at 1101, for its statement that “[t]he Kessler
doctrine appears to be nothing more than a patent-specific application of res judicata between
manufacturers of allegedly infringing products and their customers.” MGA forecloses treating
Kessler as a res judicata case—a sound conclusion given Kessler’s explicit statement that a finding
of privity (required for res judicata) was unnecessary to its decision. Kessler, 206 U.S. at 612-13.

Even if Defendants had other proof suggesting “adequate

summary judgment. And this is to say nothing of other facts (also unmentioned by Defendants) that

Non-party preclusion also “may be justified based on certain pre-existing ‘substantive legal

relationship[s]’ between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.” Taylor, 553 U.S. at

14

894. “Qualifying relationships include, but are not limited to, preceding and succeeding owners of

15

property, bailee and bailor, and assignee and assignor.” Id.

16

Defendants do not present any facts establishing this exception. Defendants describe

17

themselves as Endeca’s “licensees,” but licensees lack the strong connection typical of the

18

traditional relationships cited in Taylor. This is presumably why Defendants have no precedent

19

declaring a licensee-licensor relationship as sufficient to establish privity. (Mot. 17). In any event,

20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

Privity is an indispensable element of Defendants’ res judicata defense, and they have failed
to carry their burden on that prong. Their res judicata defense accordingly fails.

As These Claims Were Not Asserted and Could Not Have Been
Asserted in Walmart, They Cannot Be Barred by Res Judicata

14

In Aspex, the Federal Circuit directly resolved whether res judicata bars a lawsuit involving

15

products that did not exist at the time of an original suit, no matter how similar those products were

16

to the original products. 672 F.3d at 1342. The court held that res judicata does not bar such a suit:

17

res judicata is limited to claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the prior action.

18

Id., at 1343. As a matter of logic, claims directed to products that did not exist during the original

19

suit could not have been asserted in that prior action, regardless of whether the new products are

20

essentially the same as the products that were part of the original lawsuit. Id. at 1342; see also

21

Lawlor v. Nat’l Screen Serv. Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 328 (1955). Thus, in patent cases, a “claim,” for

22

preclusion purposes, “encompass[es] only the particular infringing acts or products that are accused

23

in the first action or could have been made subject to that action.” Aspex, 672 F.3d at 1343. It

24

“embrace[s]” only “the specific devices before the court in the first suit.” Id. (quoting Young

25

Engineers, Inc. v. U.S. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 721 F.2d 1305, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).

infringing acts between July 12, 2001 and June 28, 2013.14 Thus, it is indisputable that a major

2

percentage of SpeedTrack’s present claims—involving Defendants’ use of the accused methods

3

from May 26, 2007 to June 28, 2013—did not even exist while the Walmart action was pending.

4

Under Aspex, it is settled law that those claims cannot be barred by res judicata for that reason

5

alone. 672 F.3d at 1342-43 (“If the claim did not exist at the time of the earlier action, it could not

6

have been asserted in that action and is not barred by res judicata.”); Lawlor, 349 U.S. at 328.

7

Defendants fare no better with the remainder of SpeedTrack’s present claims from July 12,

8

2001 to May 25, 2007. Those claims could not have been brought in the Walmart action (key word:

9

Walmart) because SpeedTrack could not blame Walmart (or Endeca) for acts taken by Walmart’s

10

competitors—Office Depot, PC Connection, Newegg, or CDW. Again, “the ‘claim’ that gives rise

11

to preclusion [encompasses] only the particular infringing acts or products that are accused in the

12

first action or could have been made subject to that action.” Aspex, 672 F.3d at 1343 (citing Young

was filed; thus, SpeedTrack’s claims against Endeca ended as of May 25, 2007. See Aspex Eyewear,
672 F.3d at 1345 (citing Gillig, 602 F.3d at 1363).

SpeedTrack filed its original complaint in this Action on July 12, 2007 and filed its First
Amended and Supplemental Complaint on June 28, 2013. (Exhs. 31 and 18, respectively). In its
First Amended Complaint, SpeedTrack alleged that each Defendant has infringed SpeedTrack’s
’360 patent by, among other things, practicing the claimed methods for the time period between July
12, 2001 (six years prior to the filing of SpeedTrack’s original complaint, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §
286) through the filing date of the First Amended Complaint, June 28, 2013. (Exh. 18, at Paras. 1719; 32-34; 47-49; and 62-64).

during the first action; and (2) the second claim could have been brought in the first action, then (3)

2

res judicata applies only if the products accused in the second action are identical to, or “essentially

3

the same” as, the products that were the subject of the first action. Aspex, 672 F.3d at 1342-43; See

4

also, Acumed LLC v. Stryker Corp., 525 F.3d 1319, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Because Defendants fail

5

points (1) and (2), it makes no difference whether they satisfy point (3).15

6

In any event, even if Defendants could prove the impossible—that SpeedTrack could have

7

asserted claims against these Defendants for acts performed between 2001 to 2013 in a suit against

8

Walmart and Endeca that ended in 2007—Defendants still cannot show that Defendants’ accused

9

methods are “essentially the same” as those in the Walmart action.

10

First, Defendants are incorrect that SpeedTrack “alleged” that each Defendant’s use of

11

Endeca’s product mirrors the use in Walmart. (Mot. 18-19). Aside from ignoring the difference

12

between allegations and facts, Defendants misstate SpeedTrack’s allegations. The operative

13

complaint does not allege that each Defendant infringes based solely on its use of Endeca’s software.

14

It says that Defendants combine Endeca’s software with other components, including Defendants’

15

websites, to practice the claimed methods. (See Exh. 18, Paras. 12, 17, 32, 47, and 62).

16

SpeedTrack’s allegations thus highlight differences between Defendants’ accused acts and the

17

accused acts in Walmart—which, of course, did not involve Defendants’ unique websites.

18
19

Second, the “accused” activity is not a product, but a method—it involves each Defendant
uniquely implementing different software and engaging in its own activities (i.e., practicing the

Defendants may assert that Nystrom held that res judicata bars a second lawsuit even though the
products at issue in the second action came into existence after the conclusion of the first action
(Nystrom v. Trex Co., 580 F.3d at 1281, 1284 (Fed.Cir.2009)). In Nystrom, however, the court
neither raised nor resolved whether res judicata applies when the products at issue did not exist
during the first action. It instead answered the narrow question posed by the parties: whether a
minor alteration, leaving the second product “essential the same” as the first, could undermine res
judicata if res judicata otherwise applied. It is well settled that a court holds nothing on legal points
it does not address: “‘Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of
the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute
precedents.’” Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U.S. 157, 170 (2004) (quoting
Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)). Any attempt to read Nystrom as deciding a principle it
never addressed would also set up Nystrom in direct conflict with controlling law. Nystrom should
be confined to its intended scope.

1

claimed methods). Those “transactional facts” give rise to SpeedTrack’s claims—the alleged

2

similarities between this unique conduct does not render each independent infringing act “identical”

3

to activity in earlier litigation. Consistent with these facts, Defendants apparently admit that Endeca

4

customers use different versions of Endeca’s software, different websites, and different product

5

inventories (Mot. 19). It is thus undisputed that Defendants’ accused acts are not “essentially the

6

same” as those in the Walmart action. That is a sufficient basis for denying summary judgment.

7

Nor may Defendants cure this deficiency by saying that each Defendant uses “numeric

8

‘dimension value identifiers.’” (Mot. 19). Defendants have not shown that such numbers are

9

always used, that any used numbers are exactly the same, or that any identical numbers were used in

10

the Walmart action. Moreover, while the use of numbers might be relevant for literal infringement,

11

it does not resolve “equivalents” infringement. Finally, even if Defendants found a single common

12

fact, they have not found what res judicata demands—perfect unity of all transactional facts.

13

Defendants, in sum, effectively contend that res judicata somehow sweeps in any conduct

14

that resembles conduct in a prior suit. But the fact that Walmart’s use of Endeca’s platform may

15

resemble (for example) Office Depot’s use of similar software does not convert the earlier suit

16

involving Walmart into a suit involving Office Depot. That novel theory would eviscerate the

17

distinction between claim and issue preclusion, and extend the sweep of res judicata to non-parties

18

and new activity never before involved in any litigation. There is no legal or logical basis for

19

rewriting the doctrine in such an extraordinary fashion.

20

Because Defendants have no answer for these points, they instead insist that Walmart gives

21

rise to res judicata on any issue (including “equivalents”) that even might have been raised in that

22

case, whether it was litigated or not. (Mot. 20-21). That is correct as to Walmart and Endeca—at

23

least for the time periods and conduct in question—but wholly irrelevant here. SpeedTrack never

24

claimed the right to split its earlier claims and re-litigate against Walmart and Endeca for the

25

conduct at issue in Walmart. Any issues involving those transactional facts are bound up with that

26

judgment, and Walmart or Endeca (or their privies) may invoke res judicata as to those transactional

27

facts. SpeedTrack’s point is simply that these Defendants and these transactional facts are distinct.

28

Likewise, it is irrelevant that SpeedTrack did not initially assert “equivalents” infringement

in the Walmart action. (Contra Mot. 22). That argument would be relevant—and well taken—had

2

SpeedTrack again sued Walmart: where the transactional facts and parties are the same, res judicata

3

applies to all issues, litigated or not. Jet, Inc., 223 F.3d at 1362. But that point has no bearing on a

SpeedTrack’s Suit—Alleging “Equivalents” Infringement, Not “Literal”
Infringement—Is Not Barred By Collateral Estoppel, As It Involves Different
And Unresolved Issues Of Law And Fact That Were Not Actually Litigated In
Any Prior Proceeding

8

Under collateral estoppel, “a judgment precludes relitigation of issues actually litigated and

6

9

determined in the prior suit.” Lawlor, 349 U.S. at 326; see also Jet, Inc., 223 F.3d at 1366

10

(requiring “identity of the issues in a prior proceeding” and that “the issues were actually litigated”);

11

Hydranautics v. Filmtec Corp., 204 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir. 2000).
In this case, Defendants have not shown identical “issue[s] of fact or law” (Applied Med.

12
13

Res. Corp. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 435 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2006)), and they certainly have

14

not shown that those pertinent issues were “actually litigated” (Foster v. Hallco Mfg. Co, 947 F.2d

15

469, 480 (Fed. Cir. 1991), 947 F.2d at 480). But even if every element were met, collateral estoppel

16

is an equitable doctrine; its application is not mandatory, but discretionary, and there are sound

17

reasons not to invoke it on these facts.
1.

18

Defendants Cannot Identify Any Identical Issues Of Fact Or Law

19

Contrary to Defendants’ contentions, this suit presents different issues because literal

20

infringement is not the same as “equivalents” infringement. Defendants may wish to overlook this

21

distinction, but the Federal Circuit will not: “[t]here are two types of infringement: literal

22

infringement…and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.” Pozen Inc. v. PAR Pharm., Inc.,

24
25
26
27
28

16

In any event, Defendants are incorrect that SpeedTrack made a “tactical decision” to forgo the
doctrine of equivalents. (Mot. 22). As the Court itself recognized (Exh. 1, at 1:23-2:2), SpeedTrack
had no reason to assert the doctrine of equivalents until Walmart and Endeca changed their core
infringement defense. While SpeedTrack attempted to assert the doctrine of equivalents in response,
the Court sustained Walmart’s and Endeca’s objections—asserting that the only “tactical” decision
was seeking to bar defendants’ switch under judicial estoppel rather than simply amending
SpeedTrack’s own contentions.

The doctrine of equivalents is a court-created doctrine. It protects patent owners from

2

unscrupulous copyists and avoids placing patent owners at the mercy of verbalism. Graver Tank &

3

Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 606 (1950) (“The essence of the doctrine [of

equivalents] is that one may not practice a fraud on a patent.”). According to the theory, “‘if two

5

devices do the same work in substantially the same way, and accomplish substantially the same

6

result, they are the same, even though they differ in name, form, or shape.’” Id.

7

The Federal Circuit has carefully designated infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

8

as an independent “claim” or “issue”—not just an argument in support of “infringement” generally.

9

See e.g., Sulzer Textil A.G. v. Picanol N.V., 358 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“any claim of

10

infringement under the doctrine of equivalents”); Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp.,

11

149 F.3d 1309, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“Dolly, Weiner, and Sage were decided on their facts, and

12

were consistent with both our precedent and with the Supreme Court’s recent express adherence to

13

the doctrine of equivalents as a viable alternative to literal infringement”); Ethicon Endo-Surgery,

14

Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 93 F.3d 1572, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (“the issue of infringement by

15

equivalents”)17; Pfaff, 5 F.3d at 520 (treating “literal infringement” and “infringe[ment] under the

16

doctrine of equivalents” as two distinct issues).

17

The circuit’s consistent articulation is not accidental. The doctrine of equivalents implicates

18

multiple issues of law and fact that are wholly distinct from literal infringement. The doctrine has

19

“various legal limitations” peculiar to it (Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S.

20

17, 39 n.8 (1997)), including “prosecution history estoppel and the ‘all elements’ rule” (Panduit

28

17

Ethicon demonstrates that the Federal Circuit treats literal infringement and infringement under
the doctrine of equivalents as distinct issues. 93 F.3d at 1583. In Ethicon, the district court issued a
generic summary judgment of “noninfringement,” but made no findings with respect to the issue of
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. Id. The Federal Circuit could not tell from the
record “whether the issue [of equivalents] was briefed and argued to the district court,” and therefore
the Federal Circuit remanded the case to the district court to articulate whether any triable issues of
fact exist with respect to infringement by equivalents. Id. Ultimately, the Federal Circuit held that
issues of fact did exist on the issue of equivalents. Ethicon, 149 F.3d at 1321. Had the Federal
Circuit followed Defendants’ view that infringement is a single issue that includes both literal and
equivalents infringement, the Federal Circuit would not have remanded but simply would have
accepted the district court’s summary judgment order of “noninfringement.”

of equivalency is a question of fact” (Upjohn Co. v. MOVA Pharm. Corp., 225 F.3d 1306, 1309

2

(Fed. Cir. 2000))—one requiring a deliberate analysis of “the context of the patent, the prior art, and

3

the particular circumstances of the case” (Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 24). See also Ethicon

4

Endo-Surgery, 93 F.3d at 1583. Further, under the doctrine, a patentee must establish a link

5

between the claims and the accused device, including the insubstantiality of any deviations (such as

6

the product accomplishing the same function, in the same way, to produce the same result. Network

7

Commerce, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 422 F.3d 1353, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Literal infringement, by

8

contrast, merely requires a simple comparison of the construed claims to the accused product or

9

method. Presidio Components, Inc. v. Am. Tech. Ceramics Corp., 702 F.3d 1351, 1358 (Fed. Cir.

10

2012).

11

Indeed, the existence of these stark differences drove this Court’s own analysis in refusing to

12

permit the “equivalents” claim in the earlier proceeding. The Court agreed with Walmart and

13

Endeca that SpeedTrack could not amend its infringement contentions because it would inject an

14

entirely new issue into the case (Exh. 2, at 9:13-10:2); it would require new discovery, new

15

evidence, and new merits briefing. (Exh. 1, at 2:10-16). The obvious need for that new material

16

underscores all the factual and legal questions that were not “identical” to the literal-infringement

17

issues underlying Walmart’s judgment. Because these issues are not the same, the earlier judgment

18

does not preclude their consideration in this new lawsuit.

19

Defendants nevertheless argue that courts, for preclusion purposes, treat the “issue” as the

20

“entire, ultimate issue such as infringement or invalidity.” (Mot. 24). But that reads these cases too

21

broadly. Not a single cited decision says that a decision on literal infringement controls in a case

22

involving equivalents. It may be true that, under certain circumstances, parties may not assert new

23

“arguments” in support of the same invalidity contentions—which is the ultimate point of

24

Defendants’ non-Federal Circuit, fact-bound authority.18 But Defendants cannot sweep aside the

25

material differences between literal and equivalents infringement by citing distinguishable cases

(finding issues were the same because defendants merely “wish[ed] to buttress their case through

4

same patent, the same accused products, and the same argument with respect to activation of the

5

lights on the footwear,” all of which were actually decided in the first action).

6

Further, Defendants cannot frame the Walmart issue as “infringement” without reaching “far

7

too lofty a level of generality.” U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Indiana Gas Co., 350 F.3d 623, 629 (7th Cir.

8

2003). Issue preclusion requires parties to identify “concrete issues” for estoppel, not an umbrella

9

category that obscures the issues of law and fact actually adjudicated in an earlier suit. Ibid.

10

Defendants’ approach would wrongly invite the Court to “equate[] issue preclusion with claim

11

preclusion,” barring future questions that were never truly decided in any action. Ibid.; see also

12

Lantech, Inc. v. Keip Mach. Co., 32 F.3d 542, 543 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (describing the doctrine of

notably silent in offering any justification for such a novel methodology.

precluded) was actually litigated in that prior case. Defendants’ argument ignores a simple truth:
when Endeca and Walmart had an opportunity to litigate the doctrine of equivalents, they refused to
do so and instead resisted its adjudication. Their success cannot be squared with Defendants’
contention that these issues were somehow “actually litigated.”

Defendants invoke the unpublished disposition in Reese v. Verizon Cal., Inc., 498 F. App’x 980

of a stipulated judgment or consent decree, and it was “undisputed” that the same issue was
presented in each case. 498 F. App’x at 981, 983. Nowhere did Reese (without saying so) jettison
the rule that the same issues of fact and law must be identified in each proceeding before estoppel
will attach. Further, in Home Diagnostics, Inc. v. Lifescan, Inc., 120 F. Supp. 2d 864, 868 (N.D.
Cal. 2000) (Mot. 23 n. 14), unlike this case, both issues of literal infringement and doctrine of
equivalents were adjudicated in the first lawsuit. Vigil v. The Disney Co., 2003 WL 22016805 (N.D.
Cal. 2003) is also inapplicable here, because the court applied res judicata to bar a claim, which,
unlike this case, could have brought in the first action, and which involved the same product and the

1

Defendants insist that “SpeedTrack cannot now relitigate the issue of infringement, by

2

saying that the missing element was in fact present under the doctrine of equivalents.” (Mot. 24-

3

25). But this proves SpeedTrack’s point, not Defendants’. The Court’s ruling on “category

4

descriptions” was a ruling based on literal infringement. The Court did say that “Endeca software

5

does not infringe because it does not meet the ‘category description’ limitation of the asserted

6

claims.” (Mot. 24). That ruling merely sets up the distinct inquiry at issue now: does Endeca’s

7

software have the equivalent of that missing claim element? “[A]ny analysis of infringement under

8

the doctrine of equivalents necessarily deals with subject matter that is ‘beyond,’ ‘ignored’ by, and

9

not included in the literal scope of a claim.” Ethicon, 149 F.3d at 1317; see also Nystrom, 580 F.3d

10

at 1287 (Rader, J., concurring) (“The doctrine of equivalents, by definition, acknowledges that a

11

specific claim limitation is not expressly found in the accused product or process.”). Defendants’

12

theory only highlights why a decision on one theory will not preclude a decision on the other.

13

In fact, Defendants again prove SpeedTrack’s point in focusing on the rule that infringement

14

determinations traditionally ask “whether every claim limitation, or its equivalent, is found in the

15

accused device.” (Mot. 23). This deliberate use of the disjunctive illustrates that “equivalents” are

16

present when “claim limitations” are not present. Thus a decision limited to literal infringement will

17

not necessarily resolve any “actually litigated” issues of fact or law for the doctrine of equivalents.

Defendants Have Not Demonstrated Any Reason For A Court To
Exercise Its Discretion To Apply Collateral Estoppel On These Facts

Even when all its elements are satisfied, collateral estoppel is not mandatory. The doctrine

21

involves an element of discretion: because “issue preclusion is premised on principles of fairness,”

22

courts have “some discretion” to apply or withhold the doctrine. In re Freeman, 30 F.3d 1459, 1467

23

(Fed. Cir. 1994); Title v. INS, 322 F.2d 21, 24 (9th Cir. 1963). There are multiple reasons not to

24

apply the doctrine in this case even were all its elements present (which they are not).

25

First, Defendants carry the burden to show that the methods performed by the Defendants are

26

“essentially the same” as those performed by Walmart and Endeca in the Walmart action, Foster,

27

947 F.2d at 480; Young Eng’rs, Inc., 721 F.3d at 1316, and that it would be fair to impose estoppel

28

here. (See Para. 10 in Section III., supra). Their motion does not meet either burden. Second,

1

SpeedTrack’s actions do not justify a universal ban to preclude any litigation over this key issue—

2

one concerning the practical vitality of this important, and valid, patent. Third, SpeedTrack’s earlier

3

inability to raise the doctrine of equivalents ultimately prejudiced itself, but no one else. The

4

integrity of the judicial system is not at risk when courts address distinct issues and conclude (based

5

on that new issue) that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was proven here even though

6

literal infringement was not proven before. (The issues, after all, are mutually exclusive by

7

definition.) And finally, these Defendants could have followed Endeca in seeking to resolve the

8

entire controversy together with the Walmart defendants, but elected against it—and the Walmart

9

defendants deliberately resisted efforts to seek global repose on this issue: while they had every

10

opportunity to litigate infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, they instead asserted new

11

arguments at the last minute, and opposed reasonable efforts to press for a definitive disposition on

12

these questions. There is nothing unfair about asking new Defendants to litigate—for the very first

13

time—these critically important questions.

14

In sum, if Defendants wish to use SpeedTrack’s intellectual property without their

15

permission (and without even the slightest compensation), they should be prepared to explain why

16

their activity does not constitute infringement under an issue (the doctrine of equivalents) that no

17

court, at any level, has ever entertained in any substantive way. Collateral estoppel is designed to

18

put an end to litigation over decided questions, not forever shield unresolved issues of law and fact.

19

Defendants may wish to recast the earlier suit into something it was not, but the truth remains that

20

the doctrine of equivalents is its own issue, and no court has ever resolved it. This is not an

21

appropriate candidate for the proper use of collateral estoppel.

Defendants’ motion should be denied.
