Department of the Interior ("DOT"), the DOI, Robert "Bob" Abbey, Acting Director of the
Minerals Management Service ("MMS"), and the MMS (collectively, "Defendants"), in the form
of the Order attached hereto as Exhibit "A". As will be explained more fully in the
accompanying memorandum in support, preliminary injunctive relief is necessary for the
following reasons:

Hornbeck has filed a Supplemental and Amended Complaint for Declaratory and
Injunctive Relief ("Complaint") against Defendants alleging violations of the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act (""OCSLA"), 43 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1331 et seq., and its implementing regulations. The
violations alleged in the Complaint arise from the Moratorium! and NTL" currently imposed by
Defendants prohibiting any drilling activity in the Outer Continental Shelf ("OCS") in water
depths greater than 500 feet. Both the Moratorium and NTL are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.
0x00A70x00A7 701-706, and OCSLA because they exceed Defendants' authority. This motion seeks
preliminary injunctive relief in connection with the Complaint.

Hornbeck is substantially likely to prevail on the merits of the claims set forth in the
Complaint because the Moratorium and NTL exceed Defendants' authority under OCSLA and
its implementing regulations. Hornbeck will suffer irreparable injury if a preliminary injunction

is not granted because the harm that the Moratorium and NTL will inflict on Hornbeck - and the

 

"On May 28, 2010, Secretary Salazar issued a memorandum entitled "Suspension of Outer Continental
Shelf ("OCS") Drilling of New Deepwater Wells" to the MMS (the "Moratorium"). It imposed a "six month
suspension of all pending, current, or approved offshore drilling operations of new deepwater wells in the Gulf of
Mexico and the Pacific Regions."

* Effective May 30, 2010, in a document entitled NTL No. 2010-N04 "Notice to Lessees and Operators of
Federal Oil and Gas Leases in the Outer Continental Shelf Regions of the Gulf Of Mexico and the Pacific to
Implement the Directive to Impose a Moratorium on All Drilling of Deepwater Wells" (the "NTL"), the MMS
implemented Secretary Salazar's Moratorium. The NTL prohibits any new drilling activity in water depths greater
than 500 feet and requires a halt to the drilling taking place at 33 currently permitted wells being drilled at depths
beyond 500 feet.

OCS industry as a whole - is not subject to calculation. The irreparable injury that Hornbeck
will suffer absent preliminary injunctive relief outweighs any harm Defendants may suffer if a
preliminary injunction is granted. Granting a preliminary injunction against the Moratorium and
NTL is in the public interest because, if an injunction is not granted, the potential harm to
businesses, workers, and the economy of Louisiana includes, but is not limited to, the loss of
3,000 to 6,000 Louisiana jobs in the next 2 to 3 weeks, potentially over 10,000 Louisiana jobs
within a few months, more than 20,000 existing and potential new Louisiana jobs in the next 12
to 18 months, and lost wages could be over $165 to $330 million per month for every month the
moratorium is in place.

WHEREFORE, Hornbeck respectfully requests that this Court enter a preliminary
injunction enjoining the Moratorium and NTL as applied to all drilling in water at depths of

greater than 500 feet.

Respectfully submitted,
