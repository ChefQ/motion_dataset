her Objection to the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Federal National
Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”)

Before it may commence an action for foreclosure, Paragraph 22 of the Mortgage

requires Fannie Mae to send a notice to the Plaintiff that “specif[ied]: (a) the default; (b) the
action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is
given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on
or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this
Security Instrument and sale of the Property. The notice shall further inform Borrower of the
right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence
of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale.” (See Exhibit B to Fannie
Mae’s Statement of Undisputed Facts at p. 11-12.)
2.

Neither Fannie Mae, Green Tree Servicing, LLC, or Federal Housing Finance

Agency sent the Plaintiff a notice that specified the default, the action required of Plaintiff to
cure the default, a date (not less than thirty days from the date of the notice) by which Plaintiff
must cure the default, that failure to cure the default may result in acceleration and foreclosure,
that Plaintiff has the right to reinstate after acceleration, and that Plaintiff has the right to bring a
court action to assert the non-existence of default or any other defense to the foreclosure. (See
Affidavit of Delinda M. Martins at ¶ 2.)
