THOMAS R. RODELLA, JR.
Defendant.

Case No.: 14-CR-2783 JB

DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO UNITED STATES’ MOTION IN
LIMINE TO PERMIT EVIDENCE OF RIO ARRIBA COUNTY SHERIFF OFFICE
PROCEDURES AS PART OF THE TRAINING MATERIALS
The Defendant, Thomas R. Rodella, by his attorneys, Robert J. Gorence and Louren
Oliveros of Gorence & Oliveros, P.C., hereby submits his Response in Opposition to the United
States’ Motion in Limine to Permit Evidence of Rio Arriba County Sheriff Office Procedures as
part of the Training Materials [Doc. 45]. In support of his Response, Mr. Rodella states as
follows:
The government’s motion is subject to Defendant’s Motion to Strike Expert Testimony of
Manuel T. Overby [Doc. 50] (hereinafter referred to as “Motion to Strike”) and that motion is
incorporated herein by reference. Mr. Rodella opposes the government’s motion to permit
evidence of the Rio Arriba County Sheriff’s Office’s procedures for the same reasons stated in
the motion to strike Mr. Overby’s testimony. The standard operating procedures of the Rio
Arriba County Sheriff’s Office have no relevance to this case. This is simply an attempt by the
government to introduce into evidence what the government has listed as Exhibit 14 (RASO
Policies and Procedures”) and Exhibit 15 (DPS training materials) on the United States’
1

Proposed Exhibit List [Doc. 57]. While the government’s motion states that the evidence will be
used solely for the “limited purpose of demonstrating the defendant’s state of mind and his
knowledge,” their expert disclosure of Manuel T. Overby demonstrates otherwise. The
government intends to introduce these standard operating procedures, as well as the expert
testimony of Mr. Overby, as evidence that Mr. Rodella did not conform to the standard operating
procedures. For the reasons stated in Mr. Rodella’s Motion to Strike, this evidence is not
relevant and should not be admitted at trial.
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons and the reasons stated in Defendant’s Motion
to Strike Expert Testimony of Manuel T. Overby [Doc. 50], Mr. Rodella requests that this Court
exclude any references, testimony or evidence of the Rio Arriba County Sheriff’s Office’s
procedures as well as any other training materials or standard operating procedures and for all
such relief this Court deems just and proper.
Respectfully submitted,
