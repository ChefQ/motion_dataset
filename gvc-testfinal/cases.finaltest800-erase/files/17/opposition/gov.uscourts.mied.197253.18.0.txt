Damages Claims Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), requests that this Honorable Court deny
Defendant’s motion for the reasons set forth below and in the accompanying brief.
Defendant’s motion seeks two remedies: it seeks to preclude recovery, as a matter
of law, for any punitive damages or exemplary damages under the facts of this case.
First, Plaintiff agrees that punitive damages are not available in this case. See, e.g.,
McFadden v. Tate, 350 Mich. 84; 85 N.W.2d 181 (1957). Plaintiff has no objection to the
dismissal of any punitive damage claims in this case; whether or not such a dismissal is formally
accomplished, Plaintiff will not seek punitive damages in this case.
As to exemplary damages, however, Defendant incorrectly cites Michigan law.
Defendant’s entire argument is essentially based upon the black letter rule set out in Veselenac v.
Smith, 414 Mich. 567, 576-77; 327 N.W.2d 261 (1982). Veselenac stands for the ironclad
proposition that double damages are not available in a case where mental distress damages caused
by the injury itself are also awarded.
However, Plaintiff properly pleaded that exemplary damages are available under
the facts of this case, where such “compensates a plaintiff for the humiliation, sense of outrage and
indignity resulting from injustices maliciously, wilfully, and wantonly inflicted by the defendant.”
McPeak v. McPeak, (on remand), 233 Mich. App. 483, 490; 597 N.W.2d 180 (1999). Further, a
plaintiff seeking exemplary damages for such conduct on the part of the defendant does not need
to present direct evidence of injury to his or her feelings, but instead, if such are natural and
proximate in view of the nature of defendant’s conduct, they can automatically be awarded by the
jury. Id.

Certainly, there will come a point in this litigation where Plaintiff will have to
choose whether to proceed under the auspices of exemplary damages, or under the auspices of
pain and suffering pursuant to personal injury. However, a 12(B)(6) motion is not the time to force
Plaintiff to make such a decision. It is well settled that a 12(B)(6) motion tests only whether the
plaintiff has stated a claim for which the law provides relief. Gazette v. City of Pontiac, 41 F.3d
1061 (6th Cir. 1994). The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether a
claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims. Id.
Essentially, what Defendant is attempting to do is force Plaintiff to opt between
two prongs of an alternative pleading. However, when faced with a 12(B)(6) motion, it is not this
Court’s position to force Plaintiff to choose one of two alternative theories at this point in the
proceeding. Rule 8 explicitly allows for alternative pleading, and a pleading does not become
deficient by reason of a party having made alternative, or even contradictory, claims. Detroit
Tigers, Inc. v. Ignite Sports Media, L.L.C., 203 F. Supp. 2d 789, 793 (E.D. Mich. 2002). As such,
as to Plaintiff’s claim for exemplary, such is well grounded in Michigan law, and supported by the
facts as set out in the Complaint. It is not capable of being dismissed at this time.
