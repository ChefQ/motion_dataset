DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE AFFIDAVIT OF WEN Y. CHIANG
Defendants FIA Card Services, N.A. (“FIA”),1 and Bank of America, N.A. (collectively
“Defendants”) hereby move to strike the affidavit filed by plaintiff Wen Y. Chiang (“Plaintiff”)
in opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Complaint. Under Rule 56(e)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a supporting or
opposing affidavit must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible
in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters stated. Fed. R. Civ.
P. 56(e)(1). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff’s affidavit and the exhibits thereto do not
comply with the requirements of Rule 56(e)(1) and therefore should be stricken.
1.

Paragraphs 2 – 6 of Plaintiff’s affidavit contain irrelevant averments and/or

inadmissible hearsay. The only issues remaining in this case are whether Plaintiff can establish
that FIA’s investigation of the ACDVs received by FIA from any of the CRAs was unreasonable
and whether an alternative investigation would have uncovered an inaccuracy in FIA’s credit
reporting. See Chiang v. Verizon New England Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 2010). Factual

1 FIA was formerly known as MBNA America Bank, N.A. (and erroneously sued herein as
MBNA America Bank).

averments, and averments concerning communications between Plaintiff and Defendants,
regarding Plaintiff’s deposit account and/or billing disputes with respect to his credit card
account, are not relevant to Plaintiff’s sole remaining claim brought under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-b(2) because, as discussed in Defendants’ memorandum in
support of its motion for summary judgment, FCRA addresses credit reporting, not billing
disputes. The averments in these paragraphs at most reflect Plaintiff’s disagreement with the
Defendants’ position with respect to charges appearing on his account statement and “[t]o the
extent that [Plaintiff’s] argument reduces to the claim that any investigation that did not accept
his allegations as accurate was by definition unreasonable, it fails.” Chiang at 41.
2.

Paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 of Plaintiff’s affidavit contain improper legal conclusions.

3.

Paragraph 7 of Plaintiff’s affidavit is irrelevant to the Plaintiff’s FCRA claim.

4.

Paragraph 8 of Plaintiff’s affidavit contains irrelevant averments because the

Court denied Plaintiff’s request for leave to amend his complaint to include allegations
concerning the account ending “9211.” The sole remaining claim in this action does not pertain
to this account and therefore Plaintiff’s averments concerning the account are irrelevant and
should be stricken.
5.

Defendants object to the following Exhibits attached to Plaintiff’s Declaration as

follows:
a.

Exhibits A-a [Doc. 62-1, p. 1], A-b [Doc. 62-1, p. 2] , A-c [Doc. 62-1, p.

3], A-e [Doc. 62-1, p. 5], A-h [Doc. 62-1, pp. 8-9], A-i [Doc. 62-1, pp. 16-17], A-j [Doc.
62-1, p. 20], A-k [Doc. 62-1, pp. 10-11] , A-l [Doc. 62-1, p. 12] , A-m [Doc. 62-1, p. 13],
A-n [Doc. 62-1, p. 14], A-o [Doc. 62-1, p. 15], A-p [Doc. 62-1, p. 21] are irrelevant and
contain inadmissible hearsay for the reasons set forth in Paragraph 1 above. In addition,
to establish a 15 U.S.C. § Section 1681s-2(b) claim, Plaintiff has the burden of
establishing with affirmative evidence actual notice from a consumer reporting agency to
defendant. Gibbs v. SLM Corp.¸ 336 F. Supp. 2d 1, 21-23 (D. Mass. 2004). His

communications or dispute with the Defendants or credit reporting agencies are wholly
irrelevant.
b.

Exhibit A-d [Doc. 62-1, p. 4] contains inadmissible hearsay, lacks

foundation, is irrelevant and was not previously produced in discovery. This document
purports to be a letter from Discover to Plaintiff but nowhere in the document does it
identify the Bank of America account to which the alleged past due status relates.
c.

Exhibits A-f [Doc. 62-1, pp. 6 and 18] and A-g [Doc. 62-1, pp. 7, 19-20]

contain inadmissible hearsay, lack foundation and are irrelevant.
