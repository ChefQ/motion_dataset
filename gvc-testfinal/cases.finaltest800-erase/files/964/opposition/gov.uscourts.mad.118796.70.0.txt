CIVIL ACTION NO.
08-11908 RWZ

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
TO STRIKE AFFIDAVIT OF WEN Y. CHIANG
Defendants have filed a motion to strike the Affidavit of Wen Y. Chiang and the
attachments to this Affidavit. (Doc. 67). The Affidavit of Wen Y. Chiang (Doc. 62) and the
attachments to his Affidavit (Doc. 62-1) were filed in opposition to defendants’ motion for
summary judgment. Defendants argue that the Affidavit and attached documents were not made
on personal knowledge, do not state facts that would be admissible in evidence in evidence or
show that Plaintiff Wen Y. Chiang (“Chiang”) is competent to testify on the matters stated, as
required by Rule 56(e)(1). As shown below, all of defendants’ arguments are without merit.
1.

Defendants argue that Paragraphs 2-6 of Chiang’s Affidavit contain irrelevant

averments and/or hearsay. This argument is without merit since the statements contained in
Paragraph 2 are statements that Chiang made to Bank of America (“BOA”) employees and their
responses, that are admissions by BOA and are admissible. Paragraphs 3-6 contain statements
regarding the illegal charges on the BOA monthly statements. These statements are admissible
since they were known to BOA and would have been revealed if BOA had conducted a

reasonable investigation after receiving notification of Chiang’s disputes from credit reporting
agencies.
2.

Defendants argue that Paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 of Chaing’s Affidavit contain legal

conclusions. However, these statements are not legal conclusions, but are statements of Chiang
when he review the monthly account statements from BOA and are statements that any lay
person could make.
3.

Defendants argue that Paragraph 7 of Chiang’s Affidavit is not relevant to

Chiang’s FCRA claim. The statement is that BOA never sent him any monthly statements after
January 2009. Chiang would not be expected to make any payments to BOA after January 2009
when BOA stopped sending him monthly statements. BOA’s reports to credit reporting agencies
contained negative information on Chiang’s account after January 2007 and a reasonable
investigation by BOA after receiving notifications of Chiang’s disputes from credit reporting
agencies would have revealed the illegal continuing charges after BOA stopped sending Chiang
his monthly statement.
4.

Paragraph 8 of Chiang’s Affidavit is admissible since he provided the information

in this Paragraph from his own personal knowledge and the information shows that BOA is
continuing to make negative reports on his account ending in 9211.
5.

Defendants argue that the attachments to Chiang’s Affidavit should be stricken

pursuant to Rule 56(e)(1). As shown below, all of defendants’ arguments are without merit.
a.

Doc. 62-1, p. 1 is a letter from Chiang to BOA discussing overcharges on

his account. This document is admissible since the facts therein were known to
BOA and would have been discovered in a reasonable investigation after BOA
received notice of Chiang’s disputes from credit reporting agencies.

Filed 09/16/10 Page 4 of 5

Doc. 62-1, p. 14 is admissible since it is a letter from Chiang to BOA and

is admissible for the same reasons set forth in subparagraph “a” above.
l.

Doc. 62-1, p. 15 is admissible as a letter from Chiang to BOA for the same

reasons set forth in subparagraph “a” above.
m.

Doc. 62-1, p. 21 is another letter from Chiang to BOA and is admissible

for the same reasons set forth in subparagraph “a” above.

Discover Card regarding a Experian credit report. This document states that BOA
was reporting in November 2008 that Chiang’s account was 20 days past due.

revealed that the account was not over limit and the BOA violated the FCRA by
failing to correct this erroneous report.

Doc. 62-1, pp. 7, 19-20 are admissible. Doc. 62-1, pp. 7 and 19 are credit

reports that Experian sent to Chiang and are admissible for the same reasons set
forth in subparagraph “o” above. Doc. 62-1, p. 20 is a letter from BOA to Chiang
and is admissible as an admission of BOA.
