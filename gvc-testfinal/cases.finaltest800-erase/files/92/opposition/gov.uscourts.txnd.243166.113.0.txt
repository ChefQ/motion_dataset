GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION OF APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

TO THE HONORABLE JOHN MCBRYDE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:

The United States, acting by and through the undersigned Assistant United States
Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, hereby submits this response to Motion for
Reconsideration of Appointment of Counsel:

The government initially opposed the Federal Public Defender's request to
withdraw representation because, as the Court correctly pointed out following
arraignment on the Third Superseding Indictment, Weast chooses to deliberately be
disruptive in Court--to such a degree that this Court cannot conduct any proceedings with
Weast physically present in the courtroom. However, after reviewing defense counsel's
motion that requests Weast continue self-representation through video conferencing, the
government withdraws its opposition and defers to the Court's judgment regarding the
pending motion. The government does provide the Court with the following information:

The Court has already appointed counsel to represent Weast in court, but the Court

has not foreclosed Weast's ability to exercise his right to self-representation at trial. As

the Court told Weast, defense counsel, and the government, as soon as the Court received
assurance that the defendant would cease his disruptive behavior, the Court would re-
consider the question of self-representation. The government anticipates that the Court
will have at least one opportunity to revisit this issue on the day of trial, because the
government assumes Weast will be present, at least prior to jury impanelment. FED R.
CRIM P. 43(a\(2). Thereafter, a defendant can waive that right to continue to be present if
he persists in conduct that justifies removal after he has been warned that such conduct
would result in removal from the courtroom. FED. R. CRIM. P. 43{c). In this instance,
Weast has been repeatedly warned about his conduct and about removal.
A. Defendant's right to self-representation

The Sixth Amendment allows the defendant a right to make his own defense. That
right of representation is conditioned on the "knowing and intelligent" relinquishment of
the right to counsel. Chapman v. United States, 553 F.2d 886, 892(Sth Cir. 1977)(citing
Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975)). Because the right rises to the level of
constitutional protection, the Supreme Court has instructed trial courts not to force
"unwanted counsel" upon defendants who knowingly and voluntarily assert the right to
self-representation. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834 n46,

If a pro se defendant voluntarily refuses to participate in trial and refuses to allow
standby counsel to represent him in his absence, he may forfeit his right to any
representation at trial. In United States v. Wallace, the defendant knowingly and

voluntarily waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 527 Fed.Appx, 784, 85-86

Case 4:14-cr-00023-A. Document 113 Filed 07/11/14 Page 3of16 PagelD 482

 

(10th Cir. June 13, 2013) (unpublished opinion, copy attached). The district court
appointed standby counsel to assist the defendant with pre-trial preparation and at trial.
Id. At the start of the defendant's trial, however, the defendant informed the court that he
was waiving his appearance at the "mock trial" and also waived his right to be
represented by standby counsel. 527 Fed. Appx. at 786. The district judge admonished
the defendant about the negative impact of not appearing at trial, concluded that the
defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial and waived his
right to have standby counsel to represent him. /d. The defendant did not participate in
the first day of trial but did return to cross examine a government witness and testified in
his defense. Jd,

After he was convicted, Wallace appealed, arguing that the district judge should
have revoked his right to self-representation because he engaged in obstructive conduct;
the Tenth Circuit disagreed. /d. While the trial judge may terminate self-representation
or appoint counsel for defendants who engage in obstructionist misconduct, the Sixth
Amendment does not mandate a trial court to do so. 527 Fed.Appx. at 787; see also,
United States v. Boigegrain, 155 F.3d 1181, 1185 (10th Cir. 1998) ("LA] lawyer cannot
be forced upon a defendant who wishes to act as his own representative, even if self-
representation would be detrimental to the defendant.")

The absence of any counsel and the defendant is not necessarily a position that the
government advocates, because there are also competing interests, such as the public's

interest in the accuracy of the truth-determining process, to consider. See, Thomas v.

Carroll, 581 F.3d 118, 126 (3d Cir. 2009). And, of significance to the Tenth Circuit in
finding no Sixth Amendment violation in Wallace was the fact that the defendant there
not only waived his right to counsel, but he also knowingly refused to allow standby
counsel to represent him when Wallace was absent from trial. 527 Fed. Appx. at 787,
B. Appointment of counsel

This Court has already recognized and admonished the defendant that the right to
self-representation is not absolute. "[A] defendant can lose his right to be present at trial
if, after he has been warned by the judge that he will be removed if he continues his
disruptive behavior, he nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so
disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on
with him in the courtroom." J/inois y. Allen, 397 U.S, 337, 343 (1970). The defendant
can reclaim his right to self-representation "as soon as the defendant is willing to conduct
himself consistently with the decorum and respect inherent in the concept of courts and
judicial proceedings." /d.

Cases suggest that where a defendant chooses to represent himself for purposes of
delay or to secure a tactical advantage, courts may deny the defendant the right of self-
representation. See, Chapman vy. United States, 553 F.2d 886 (Sth Cir, 1977); United
States v. Vernier, 381 Fed. Appx. 325, 358 (Sth Cir. 2010) (unpublished opinion
attached); see also, Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California, Fourth Appellate District,

528 U.S. 152, 162 (2000) ("Even at the trial level, therefore, the government's interest in

Response to Motion to Withdraw - Page 4
 

 

 

 

ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times outweighs the defendant's
interest in acting as his own lawyer.")
C. Remote representation by the defendant

The Federal Public Defender's office suggests that the Court permit Weast to
represent himself through video conferencing. The government defers to the Court as to
the wisdom of this suggestion. The Court certainly has discretion to conduct the trial that
way, if it chooses, The Court has already recognized that it has the discretion to gag the
defendant in the courtroom if the defendant engaged in disruptive behavior; muting the
defendant's outbursts while others are talking in the courtroom may be another option the
Court wants to entertain. If the defendant engages in disruptive behavior, the Court could
also allow standby counsel to represent Weast--assuming that he does not refuse
counsel's assistance-- and permit Weast to hear what occurs in the courtroom. In the
Wallace case, for example, the defendant was removed from the courtroom but able to
hear the events occurring at trial through an audio feed. Wallace, 527 Fed.Appx at 786.
As aresult, Wallace was able to return to trial the second day and represent himself,
Conclusion

The Court has discretion to allow Weast to proceed via videoconferencing if
Weast continues to be disruptive in the courtroom. The Court also has discretion to
appoint counsel to represent Weast when he engages in disruptive behavior and can
reconsider his right to self-representation any time prior to the impanelment of the jury.

If the Court were to permit Weast to represent himself, the government submits that the

Court consider appointing standby counsel. Then, if Weast engages in disruptive

behavior, counsel can proceed without Weast's presence, and, if he waives his right to

representation by standby counsel, his Sixth Amendment rights are not violated.

"U.S. v. Wallace, 527 Fed.Appx. 784 (2013)

Oklahoma City, OK, for Defendant-Appellant.

Before KELLY, HOLMES, and MATHESON,
Circuit Judges.

Opinion

ORDER AND JUDGMENT'

SCOTT M. MATHESON, JR., Circuit Judge.

In June 2012, a jury convicted Appellant Antoine
Wallace of charges stemming from the assault of
employees at the United States Penitentiary in
Fiorence, Colorado, Mr. Wallace represented
himself at trial. He now challenges his conviction,
arguing that the trial court violated his Sixth
Amendment rights because it did not end his
self-representation and instruct standby counsel to
represent him. Exercising jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1291, we affirm.

L BACKGROUND

In February 2011, Mr. Wallace was charged with
three counts of assaulting, resisting, opposing,
impeding, intimidating, and interfering with
employees of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in
violation of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 11 1(aj(1) and (b). He was
initially appointed counsel but then requested to
represent himself,

The trial court held a hearing to ensure that Mr.
Wallace was capable of representing himself and
understood the consequences of that decision, After
advising Mr. Wallace at length of the dangers and
limitations of self-representation, the court found
that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally
waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The
court also ordered the appomtment of standby
counsel to assist *786 Mr. Wallace at trial and in
pretrial preparation.

On June 11, 2012, at the start of his two-day trial,
Mr. Wallace informed the court that he was
"waiving [his] appearance to be present during this
mock trial." ROA, Vol. 3 at 80. Mr. Wallace
repeatedly refused to allow standby counsel to
represent him in his absence. The court advised
Mr. Wallace that there would be "a serious
detrimental impact if [he] refuse[d] to participate in

the trial," but Mr. Wallace insisted on being absent.
fd, at 81,

After questioning Mr. Wallace and informing him
of the dangers of his decision, the court concluded
that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally
waived his right to be present at trial and to have
standby counsel represent him. Mr. Wallace was
placed in a nearby holding cell with an audio feed
of the trial proceedings. The court instructed
standby counsel to be seated in the back of the
courtroom and to be "up to speed on what has been
presented [at] trial" in the event that Mr. Wallace
*"change[d} his mind and ... wishe[d] to proceed."
Id. at 92.

Mr. Wallace did not participate and had no
representation during the first day of trial. On the
second day, he returned to the courtroom to
cross-examine one of the Government's witnesses,
He also testified in his own defense, made closing
arguments, and moved for a mistrial.

The jury found Mr. Wallace guilty of all three
counts, He was sentenced to 720 months in prison.

Il. DISCUSSION

Hl Mr, Wallace argues that he engaged in
"obstructive conduct" and that the trial court
should have "revoked fhis] right to
self-representation" and ordered standby counsel to
"step in on [his] behalf." Apit. Br. at 5. The court's
failure to do so, he argues, violated his rights under
the Sixth Amendment. We disagree.

The Sixth Amendment provides a criminai
defendant with the right to assistance of counsel.
U.S. Const. amend. VI. It also includes the
corresponding right to - self-representation,
"provided only that [the defendant] knowingly and
intelligently forgoes his right to counsel and that he
is able and willing to abide by rules of procedure
and courtroom protocol." McKaskle v. Wiggins,
465 U.S, 168, 173, 104 $.Ct. 944, 79 L.Bd.2d 122
(1984). Courts cannot "thrust counsel upon the
accused," Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 820,
95 S.Ct, 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), because the
defendant "must be free personally to decide
whether in his particular case counsel is to his
advantage," /d at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525,

Nevertheless, "the trial judge may terminate
self-representation by a defendant who deliberately
engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct,"
and "a State may--even over objection by the
accused---appoint a `standby counsel' to aid the
accused if and when the accused requests help, and
to be available to represent the accused in the event
that termination of the defendant's
self-representation is necessary." Jd at 834 n, 46,
95 S.Ct. 2525. Standby counsel may assist, over a
defendant's objections, in "explain [ing] and
enforc[ing} basic rules of courtroom protocol or ...
overcoming routine obstacles that stand In the way
of the defendant's achievement of his own clearly
indicated goals." McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 184, 104
S.Ct. 944, But the right to self-representation is
eroded if standby counsel is allowed, over the
defendant's objection, "to make or substantially
interfere with any significant tactical decisions, or
to contro! the questioning of witnesses, or to speak
instead *787 of the defendant on any matter of
importance," Ja. at 178, [04 $.Ct. 944,

Mr. Wallace does not dispute that he knowingly
and voluntarily waived his right to the assistance of
counsel and elected to proceed pro se. Similarly,
Mr. Wallace acknowledges that, when he
announced his intention to be absent from trial,
"[t]he trial judge ... explained in detail the dangers
Mr. Wallace faced having no one to represent
him." Aplt. Br. at 4. It also is undisputed that Mr.
Wallace repeatedly refused to allow standby
counsel to represent him in his absence.

Nonetheless, he contends that the trial court had an
affirmative duty to terminate his self-representation
because of his obstructive conduct and that its
failure to do so violated his rights under the Sixth
Amendment. He notes that at times he disobeyed
the trial court's orders to stop talking and engaged
in occasional outbursts.'

Although the Supreme Court has said that a "trial
judge may terminate self-representation by a
defendant who deliberately engages in serious and
obstructionist misconduct," Faretfa, 422 US. at
834 n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (emphasis added), it has
not held that the Sixth Amendment mandates this
outcome. Rather, the Court has instructed that trial
courts should not force unwanted counsel upon
defendants who knowingly and voluntarily assert
the right to self-representation. See id at 834, 95
8.Ct. 2525; see also McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 178,
104 S.Ct. 944; see also United States v.

Boigegrain, 155 F.3d 1181], 1185 (10th Cir,1998)
("[A] lawyer cannot be forced upon a defendant
who wishes to act as his own representative, even
if self-representation would be detrimental to the
defendant.").

Other courts have addressed similar Sixth
Amendment claims. In Clark v. Perez, 510 F.3d
382 (2d Cir.2008), the Second Circuit rejected a
claim that a criminal defendant's Sixth
Amendment rights were violated because the trial
court did not revoke her pro se status or appoint
standby counsel when she refused to participate in
or attend trial, /d at 396, That court held that no
Sixth Amendment violation occurred because the
defendant "knowingly and intelligently waived her
right to counsel, unequivocally asserted her right to
self-representation, made a conscious strategic
choice to waive her right to be present in the
courtroom as part of a de facta political protest
defense, and was afforded the opportunity to return
whenever she chose." /a?

On habeas review, the Third Circuit suggested in
dicta that when a pro se criminal defendant
voluntarily refuses to participate at trial, the court
should appoint counsel to represent the defendant,
See Thomas.' 'y. Carroll, $81 F.3d/118, 126. `Gd
Cir.2009), The pro se defendant in Thomas
knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to
counsel, was never given standby counsel, and later
voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial.
id. at 119-122. Ultimately, the Tomas court
denied habeas relief on the Sixth Amendment
claim, but it stated, "If this appeal had come before
*788 us on a direct appeal from a federal court
presented with a defendant who waived his right to
counsel and then absented himself from the
courtroom, we might hold differently," dat 127.

 

 

We conclude that Mr. Wallace's Sixth Amendment
claim is weaker than the claims in Clark and
Thomds and is thus unsuccessful. Mr. Wallace
knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to
counsel and elected to proceed pro se, Unlike the
defendants in Clara and Thomas, he was appointed
standby counsel in advance of trial, At trial, Mr.
Wallace knowingly and voluntarily waived his
right to be present. When asked if standby counsel
could represent him in his absence, Mr. Wallace
repeatedly refused. Neither the Clark court nor the
Thomas court was confronted with a defendant
who explicitly refused to allow standby counsel to
present a defense. This request placed the trial
