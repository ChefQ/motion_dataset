MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

COMES NOW, Angela Saad, Assistant Federal Public Defender, attorney of record for
defendant Christopher Robert Weast, and respectfully requests the Court reconsider the
appointment of the Federal Public Defender's Office, in lieu of Mr. Weast proceeding pro se.

On July 8, 2014, the Court appointed the Federal Public Defender's Office to represent
the defendant during a competency hearing. The defendant was not found incompetent. He was
allowed to represent himself during the arraignment hearing and question the witness during the
competency hearing. Albeit, he conducted his representation via video conferencing from a
conference room on the third floor. With the audio and visual capabilities, the defendant was
able to represent himself. Nevertheless, the Court appointed the Federal Public Defender's
Office to continue representation.

Defense counsel respectfully requests reconsideration of this appointment because the

defendant has made it inordinately clear that he wants to proceed pro se and he does not want the

assistance of the Federal Public Defender's Office. Pursuant to Faretta v. California, [t]he Sixth
Amendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the
accused personally the right to make his defense." Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819
(1975). The Supreme Court continues to state that "it is the accused, not counsel, who must be
`informed of the nature and cause of the accusation,' who must be `confronted with the witnesses
against him,' and who must be accorded `compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his
favor.'" Id. This is Mr. Weast's constitutional right and this must be preserved.

During the competency hearing, the Court removed the defendant from the courtroom
after the defendant would not refrain from speaking in the courtroom. The Court indicated to the
defendant he could return to the courtroom if he were to conduct himself properly. The Court
relied on the Supreme Court decision, Illinois v. Allen, in making this determination. Illinois v.
Allen, 397 U.S. 337 (1970). While the Supreme Court has stated "the trial judge may terminate
self representation by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist
misconduct," the Supreme Court also stated "the right of self representation has been recognized
from our beginnings by federal law." The Supreme Court was clear that the right of self-
representation is the core of our constitution and should not be undermined.

In the Fifth Circuit, a pro se defendant was only disallowed his right to self-
representation after he boasted that he wanted to "go out in a bloody confrontation, disrupt the
trial, and make the news" and attempted escape from the jail. United States v. Vernier, 381
Fed.Appx. 325 (5th Cir. 2010). In this case, the Fifth Circuit upheld the disallowance of self-
representation. /d. The facts in Mr. Weast case do not rise to that level. He disagrees with the
jurisdiction of the Court; however, his conduct has far from risen to this level. Given the Court

was able to conduct the arraignment with Mr. Weast representing himself via video

conferencing, defense counsel requests the Court continue to allow Mr. Weast reconsider the
appointment of counsel because alternate means have been successful. The decision to prevent
someone from represent themselves is discretionary. While the Court needs to ensure control of
the Courtroom, disallowing Mr. Weast from self-representation is not the only method. Based
on Mr. Weast's statements, he seemingly values his right to self-representation over the right of
confrontation. Continuing with video conferencing without the Federal Public Defender's Office
representation would ensure that Mr. Weast's constitutional rights are protected while ensuring

the dignity of the courtroom.

Respectfully submitted,
