MDL Docket No. 1869
Misc. No. 07-mc-489-PLF

PLAINTIFF RB RUBBER PRODUCTS, INC.’S OPPOSITION TO
CO-LEAD COUNSEL’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE OPPOSITION TO
THE PLEADINGS SEEKING APPOINTMENT OF WHATLEY, DRAKE &
KALLAS LLC, AUDET & PARTNERS AND WALTERS BENDER STOHBEHN
VAUGHN TO THE PLAINTIFFS’ EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Plaintiff RB Rubber Products, Inc., oppose interim co-lead counsel’s Motion for
Leave to File Opposition (Doc. 85) to the pleadings seeking to appoint Whatley, Drake &
Kallas, Audet & Partners and Walters Bender Stohbehn Vaughn to the executive
committee because interim co-lead counsel’s [Proposed] Opposition (Doc. 87) contains a
factual misstatement about RB Rubber Products which may mislead the Court.
Referencing RB Rubber Products in their proposed opposition papers, interim colead counsel states: “Prior to filing their Report, however, Interim Co-Lead Counsel
spoke with counsel for both of these new plaintiffs, and those counsel did not suggest that
they were supporting either Whatley Drake or Audet & Partners for an Executive
Committee position.” (Doc. 87 at pp. 2-3) Interim co-lead counsel’s statement is not
factually accurate. RB Rubber Products’ counsel did not have any conversations with
interim co-lead counsel or any of their proxies regarding their suggested appointments to
the Executive Committee prior to their filing the Report Concerning Proposed Executive

Committee. (Doc. 74) Furthermore, RB Rubber Products’ counsel has never spoken
with either of the interim co-lead counsel regarding the MDL’s leadership structure. See
Declaration of Matthew H. Armstrong attached hereto as Exhibit A.
For the foregoing reasons, RB Rubber Products requests that the Court enter an
Order (1) denying Interim Co-Lead Counsel’s Motion for Leave to File Opposition; (2)
striking Interim Co-Lead Counsel’s [Proposed] Opposition; and (3) appointing the
Whatley, Drake & Kallas and Audet & Partners law firms to the Plaintiffs’ Executive
Committee.
