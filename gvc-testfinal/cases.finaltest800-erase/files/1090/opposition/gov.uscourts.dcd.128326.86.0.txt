OPPOSITION BY AUDET & PARTNERS TO INTERIM CO-LEAD COUNSEL’S MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO FILE OPPOSITION TO THE PLEADINGS SEEKING APPOINTMENT OF
WHATLEY, DRAKE & KALLAS, AUDET & PARTNERS AND WALTERS BENDER
STOHBEHN VAUGHN TO THE PLAINTIFFS’ EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

This court’s March 11, 2008, Memorandum and Opinion, set forth a specific briefing
schedule relating to the issue of the appointment of the Executive Committee. That schedule
provided Interim Co-Lead Counsel with an opportunity to consider this Court’s concerns as
expressed in the March 11 Order, and to make their recommendations regarding Executive
Committee membership accordingly. Having availed themselves of the opportunity presented to
them by the Court, they now seek a second judicial bite of the apple; apparently concerned with
their stated justifications for their proposed Executive Committee.
The undersigned believes that the briefing opportunity provided by the Court is both
sufficient to address the issue and to inform the Court of the parties respective positions.
Accordingly, the undersigned respectively requests that the Court deny the request for additional
briefing.
