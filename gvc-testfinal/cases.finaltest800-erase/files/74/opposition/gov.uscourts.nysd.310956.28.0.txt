MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO METROPOLITAN LIFE
INSURANCE COMPANY'S MOTION TO DISMISS
On December 5, 2007, defendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("MetLife")
filed a notice of joinder to the motion to dismiss, filed by Verizon Communications, Inc. and
the Plan for Group Insurance ("PGI") (collectively, the "Verizon Defendants"). Rather than
repeat the arguments interposed in opposition to the Verizon Defendants' motion to dismiss,
Plaintiff, Dov Fershtadt, ("Dov"), hereby incorporates and adopts by reference the counterstatement of facts and arguments set forth in his previously filed and served opposition.
In addition to the foregoing, with respect to the Verizon Defendants' and MetLife's
argument that Dov's state law claim for bad faith should be preempted under ERISA, Dov
reiterates that the Verizon Defendants' potential advancement of an argument under ERISA's
deemer clause will fail on their motion to dismiss because Verizon has not established
whether (or not) and the extent to which it acts as an insurance company, receives money
from insurance companies, or engages in the insurance business, generally (Memorandum
of Law, p.10 n.7). We further aver with specific regard to MetLife, that the latter is
unquestionably and undeniably an insurance company that is subject to New York state laws
governing insurance, and in particular, the principles underlying the Acquista Decision.
Accordingly, Dov's third cause of action is indisputably "saved" from preemption under
ERISA's savings clauses.
