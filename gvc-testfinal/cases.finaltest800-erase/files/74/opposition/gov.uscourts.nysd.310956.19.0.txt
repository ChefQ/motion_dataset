PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
By this action, plaintiff, Dov Fershtadt, ("Dov"), seeks multifaceted relief under, in er
alia, the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") from Verizon
Communications, Inc., ("Verizon"), the Plan for Group Insurance, (the "PGI"), Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company, ("MetLife"), and Unum Life Insurance Company of America,
("Unum") (collectively, "defendants"). Dov alleges, inter alia, that defendants: (i) failed to
pay disability benefits properly due him; (ii) breached their fiduciary duties to Dov in failing
to apprise him of certain enrollment options available to him and other similarly-situated plan
participants and beneficiaries; and (iii) conversion of certain pension monies to which Dov
was rightfully entitled.
By their motion, Verizon and PGI ("Verizon Defendants") seek to dismiss, apparently
on behalf of all defendants, Dov's second, third and fourth causes of action. As demonstrated
below, defendants have misapprehended the nature of Dov's claims and the law governing
them. The motion to dismiss should be denied in all respects.

COUNTER-STATEMENT OF FACTS'
Dov's Employment with Verizon . Enrollment in its Plans and Disability
In 1982, Dov became an employee of a company which later became Verizon
(Amended Complaint, ¶15). On September 11, 2001, while Dov was working for Verizon

'The Statement of Facts contained in the brief submitted by Verizon and the PGI does not fully
and accurately recite the allegations of the Amended Complaint and/or what actually transpired prior to its
submission to the Court. Accordingly, Dov submits this Counter-Statement of Facts.

at the World Trade Center ("WTC"), a group of terrorists known as al Qaeda attacked the
WTC and several other targets in the United States, resulting in the collapse of the Twin
Towers and deaths of several thousand Americans (Id. ¶117-19). As a consequence of these
tragic events, Dov ultimately developed a series of severe medical conditions, including
Dementia, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Depression ("Disabling Conditions"),
rendering him disabled (Id. ¶129, 32-34).
At the time of the 9/11 attacks, Dov was covered by a disability plan entitled "Bell
Atlantic Long Term Disability Plan for Management Employees" (the "Bell Atlantic Plan")
issued through Dov's employer (Id. ¶15, 30). The Bell Atlantic Plan contained multiple
provisions including:
• disability benefits payable to Dov at 50% of his pre-disability earnings, fully
taxable, and subject to an annual maximum of $420,000 ("$420,000 Cap") (Id.
¶31); and
• if Dov became disabled for more than 52 weeks, his employment may be
terminated and he may not continue to accrue pension benefits to which he was
otherwise entitled to (Id. ¶48).
Verizon and its administrator at the time, Unum, initially approved payment of shortterm and later, long-term, disability benefits to Dov, but, as discussed in greater detail below,
repeatedly misidentified the plan applicable to him, at times, mixing and matching various
provisions from different plans and, at other times, seemingly changing the applicable plan
and plan provisions to be applied to his claim depending upon which provisions were less
favorable to him. For example, Verizon deemed his Disabling Conditions to constitute a

Page 5 of 24

mental-nervous disability, the limit of liability for which, according to defendants, was 24
months (Id. ¶¶71-72); however, the Bell Atlantic Plan contained no liability limitation for
mental-nervous conditions. Rather, a mental-nervous limitation appears in a 2004 Summary
Plan Description ("2004 SPD") for the PGI (Id. ¶72). Thus, defendants were combining the
Bell Atlantic Plan and PGI/2004 SPD. Similarly, for 12 months, Verizon paid Dov's benefits
as fully taxable, and subject to the $420,000 Cap applicable under the Bell Atlantic Plan (Id.
¶68); however, after expiration of the aforesaid 12-month period, Verizon paid Dov benefits
based upon a lower, $8,333 Cap (hereinafter defined) contained in a provision of the 2004
SPD (Id. ¶75) which, as discussed hereafter, contains a provision which indicates that
benefits paid thereunder are payable tax free (Id. ¶46).
Verizon Selectively Excludes Dov from an Option Available
to Other Participants in the Bell Atlantic Plan
In October 2001, Verizon had issued an offer to its employees (other than Dov)
covered under the Bell Atlantic Plan (other than Dov) to give them the option of changing
their benefit levels from those offered under the Bell Atlantic Plan to those to be offered
under the PGI, or to leave the aforesaid levels the same (the "October 2001 Transfer Option")
(Id. ¶137-38). Unfortunately, Verizon never sent the October 2001 Transfer Option to Dov
and he never received it (Id. 1139-41).
The 2004 SPD
Sometime during 2004, Verizon issued the 2004 SPD in connection with the PGI (Id.
¶44). The 2004 SPD contains multiple provisions including:
4

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Filed 10/31/2007

Page 6 of 24

• a limitation of liability , by which persons who became disabled as a result of
mental-nervous conditions ("Mental-Nervous Limitation") were restricted to
24 months of disability insurance benefits (Id. ¶72);
• a clause stating that Verizon employees who did not avail themselves with the
October 2001 Transfer Option would continue maintaining whatever benefit
levels they were entitled to receive under the Bell Atlantic Plan (Id. ¶45); and
• a clause stating that disability benefits received thereunder were to be nontaxable, subject to an $8,333 monthly cap ("$8,333 Cap"), and in the event a
plan participant becomes disabled for more than 52 weeks, their employment
would not necessarily terminate and he or she would continue to accrue
pension benefits ("Continuing Accrual/Non-Termination Provision ") (Id. ¶14647).
Verizon Directs Dov to Enroll in the PGI, under the Auspices of yet Another New SPD
In October 2004, Verizon directed Dov to enroll in the PGI and select various benefits
levels and corresponding taxability options (the "Verizon Directive") available to Verizon
employees in connection with yet another a new Summary Plan Description to be issued -this time, in 2005 ("2005 SPD") (Id. ¶¶41, 50). Pursuant to the Verizon Directive, Dov
selected a benefits level of 66% of his predisability earnings, non-taxable, and capped at
$11,111 per month ("$11,111 Cap") (collectively, the benefits at this level are hereinafter
referred to as "Full Benefits Levels") (Id. ¶52). Verizon provided multiple confirmations
("Verizon's Confirmations") to Dov that he would be paid his long-term disability benefits
at Full Benefits Levels (Id. ¶155, 62). In reliance upon the Verizon's Confirmations, Dov
paid, and Verizon accepted, premiums attached to his benefits selection, with after tax
earnings (Id. ¶¶56-57).

Verizon Continues to Conflate and Confuse Dov's Coverages
At this time, Dov had already been receiving short-term disability benefits which
continued until on or around July, 2005 (Id. ¶¶60-61). However, on or about July 14, 2005,
Dov received a letter from Unum (the "July 14th Letter"), indicating that he would start
receiving long-term disability ("LTD") benefits under yet another plan -- this one, a plan
called the "Legacy Plan," which, according to Verizon and Unum, entitled Dov to 50% of
his pre-disability earnings, fully taxable -- a sharp contrast to the tax-free benefits at 66% that
he selected under the Verizon Directive and the assurances that Dov and his wife repeatedly
received concerning his actual selection (Id. ¶63). Dov never received a copy of this "Legacy
Plan" and is entirely unfamiliar with its terms (Id. ¶64).
On August 3, 2005, Verizon sent Dov a letter (the "August 3rd Letter"), confirming
Dov's entitlement to LTD payments at Full Benefits Levels, consistent with the Verizon
Directive and Confirmation, which indicated that his claim would be administered under the
2005 SPD and contradicting Unum's July 14th Letter. (Id. ¶165-66). Days later, Verizon
inexplicably terminated Dov's employment (Id. ¶67), as if he were still covered under the
Bell Atlantic Plan and not covered by the PGI and 2005 SPD.
Upon Dov' s termination, Dov's pension benefits ceased to accrue. And following
Dov's termination, Dov received LTD benefits at 50%, fully taxable, and subject to the
$420,000 Cap from the Bell Atlantic Plan (Id. ¶68).
Verizon Wrongfully Terminates Dov's LTD Benefits Altogether

Page 8 of 24

Making matters worse, in or about August 2006, Verizon, Unum and/or MetLife
terminated Dov's LTD benefits altogether (the "August 2006 Termination"), citing the 2004
SPD (Id. ¶71). The basis for the August 2006 Termination was the Mental-Nervous
Limitation (Id. ¶171-72).
Verizon and Metlife Reinstate Dov's Benefits, but at Different and Confusing Levels
In September 2006, Dov successfully appealed the August 2006 Termination and
thereafter, continued to receive LTD benefits going forward (Id. ¶173-75); however, Verizon
and its new administrator, MetLife, suddenly began paying him LTD benefits based upon the
$8,333 Cap contained in the 2004 SPD (not the $420,000 Cap as they had done previously),
and made the benefits fully taxable even though the 2004 SPD states that benefits paid
thereunder are not taxable ("September Determination") (Id. ¶75). Thus, defendants
appeared to be administering Dov's LTD benefits as if he were covered by the provisions
least favorable to him under two different plans.
Dov appealed the September Determination in November 2006, and demanded copies
of certain tape-recorded conversations ("Tape Recordings") that Verizon and/or MetLife
engaged in with Dov, and which Dov believes contain admissions by Verizon and its
representatives concerning Dov's entitlement to benefits (Id. ¶¶78-79, 90). In response,
Verizon denied Dov's appeal, mischaracterized it as a request for "additional benefits,"
further decided that Dov was covered under the 2004 SPD ("Verizon's Denial"), and ignored
Dov's request for the Tape Recordings (Id. ¶¶81-82). Dov immediately sought copies of the

7

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Page 9 of 24

administrative record detailing the circumstances surrounding Verizon's Denial and again,
demanded inter alia, copies of the Tape Recordings. (Id. ¶183-84). To date, Verizon and
MetLife refuse to produce the Tape Recordings and have produced the administrative record,
but with pertinent names and other important information redacted (Id. ¶¶85-86).
In April, 2007, Dov appealed Verizon's Denial and demanded that his LTD Benefits
be administered and paid pursuant to the 2005 SPD, retroactively, currently and
prospectively, at Full Benefits levels (Id. ¶88). Dov also reiterated his request for the Tape
Recordings (Id. ¶89). Verizon and MetLife failed to respond to this appeal, which, under the
terms of the 2004 and 2005 SPDs, constitutes a rejection of the same ("De Facto Rejection")
(Id. ¶95). This lawsuit ensued.
Verizon Purports to Grant Dov's Appeal in Part After Commencement of this Action
Shortly after Dov filed this action, Verizon purported to grant Dov's appeal in part,
ostensibly recognizing that its payment of Dov's LTD benefits under the auspices of multiple
plans, according him the least favorable provisions of each, was legally and morally
indefensible. Currently, Dov receives 50% of his pre-disability earnings, subject to the
$420,000 Cap, fully taxable.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
It is well-settled that, on motions to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, courts
are required to deem the allegations contained in the complaint true ? Accordingly,
2Kassner v. 2d Ave. Delicatessen , 496 F.3d 229, 238 (2d Cir. 2007) ("court is to accept as true all
facts alleged in the complaint"); Grandon v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 147 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir. 1998) ("in

complaints must be "liberally construed," with all reasonable inferences drawn favor of the
non-moving party.'
"The court's function on a motion to dismiss is not to weigh the evidence that might
be presented at trial, but merely to determine whether the complaint itself is legally
sufficient."' Therefore, the Verizon Defendants' motion should not be granted unless the
plaintiff cannot prove any facts in support of their claim, which entitles them to reliefs As
shown below, Dov's allegations state claims for relief with respect to the causes of action
that the Verizon Defendants seek to dismiss.

... Except as provided in subparagraph (B) [the deemer clause]', nothing in
this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any
law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.
29 U.S.C. §1144; also see , Metropolitan Life, 471 U.S. at 740. (recognizing that state laws
that "regulate insurance" are saved from preemption under ERISA); Unum Life Ins. Co. of
America v. Ward, 526 U.S. 358, 366-7 (1999) (accord); Franklin H. Williams, 50 F.3d at 148
(accord). Here, as discussed in greater detail infra, defendants' conduct is expressly
prohibited under New York decisional law, Acquista v. New York Life Ins. Co., 285 A.D.2d
73, 730 N.Y.S.2d 272 (1st Dep't. 2001) (the "Acquista Decision") which, as also discussed
infra, clearly "regulates insurance."
The Verizon Defendants argue that Dov's third claim, which seeks consequential and

7The Verizon Defendants have not argued that ERISA 's deemer clause excepts from exemption
state claims against Verizon, although they proffer that "Verizon is not an insurance company" with
respect to their argument in support of preemption (Def. Mem., p. 10). ERISA' s deemer clause provides:
Neither an employee benefit plan ... nor any trust established under such a plan, shall be
deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer, bank, trust company, or investment
company or to be engaged in the business of insurance ... for purposes of any law of any
State purporting to regulate insurance companies, insurance contracts, banks, trust
companies , or investment companies"
29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(B).
Nonetheless, the Verizon Defendants' potential advancement of an argument under ERISA's
deemer clause would fail on their motion to dismiss , because to the extent or capacity that Verizon acts as
an insurance company, receives money from insurance companies, or engages in the insurance business,
generally, is unclear at this stage. As determined in Trapanatto v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.-Aetna Health Plans,
where "there is no factual basis on which to properly gauge this [deemer clause] argument ... invocation
of the deemer clause is unpersuasive at this juncture." Trapan atto, 1996 WL 417519, at *8. Moreover,
defendants' potential advancement of an argument under the deemer clause would necessarily relate solely
to defendant-Verizon, as MetLife, Unum and the PGI clearly fall within the meaning of ERISA' s savings
clause, cutting against dismissal of defendants' third cause of action at least to MetLife, Unum, and/or the
PGI. In any event, since the Verizon Defendants did not raise this issue in their moving papers, they
cannot do so on reply.

compensatory damages caused by defendants' bad faith handling, denial and/or termination
of his benefits under the PGI pursuant to New York state law (Dov's "State Claim"), should
be dismissed as "clearly preempted by ERISA." (Def. Mem., pp.9-10). Although the
Verizon Defendants correctly note that Dov's State Claim "relates to" his "employee benefit
plan," which typically would fall under ERISA's broad preemptive sweep, the Verizon
Defendants fail to conduct a full (really, any) preemption analysis. Dov's State Claim
survives preemption under ERISA's savings clause, which exempts laws that "regulate
insurance."
The ERISA preemption analysis "begin[s] with the assumption that `Congress does
not intent to supplant state law, a presumption that is particularly strong for `state action in
fields of traditional state regulation."' Gerosa v. Savasta & Co.. Inc., 329 F.3d 317, 323 (2d
Cir. 2003); MetropolitanLife, 471 U.S. at 741 ("The presumption is against pre-emption, and
we are not inclined to read limitations into federal statutes in order to enlarge their preemptive scope"). This is especially true with respect to laws that regulate insurance, which
are expressly saved from preemption under ERISA 's savings clause (see discussion supra).
Laws that "regulate insurance" are not limited to codified statutory law. "Decisional
law that `regulates insurance' may [also] fall under the saving clause. Pilot Life, 481 U.S.
at 48 n.1 (citations omitted) ("The saving clause, § 514(b)(2)(A), covers `any law of any
State ...[and] includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the
effect of law, of any state) (emphasis added); also see Unum Life Ins. Co. Of Am. v. Ward,

Page 13 of 24

526 U.S. 358, 366-7 n.1 ("[c]ommon law rules developed by decisions of state courts are
"State Law" under ERISA").
Courts evaluate whether a law "regulates insurance" by looking to "common sense
and frequently, by also evaluating case law interpreting the phrase, `business of insurance,'
under the McCarran-Ferguson Act." Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 48; Unum Life, 526 U.S. at 36768. Both a common sense perspective and the analysis under McCarron-Ferguson firmly
support the finding that Dov's second cause of action is not preempted.
First, the common sense analysis focuses on whether the law in question is specifically
directed at the insurance industry or is one of general application. Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 50;
Unum Life, 526 U.S. at 368; Trapanatto v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 1996 WL 417519, at *7
(S.D.N.Y.). Here, any reading of the Ac ui a decision reveals that it is clearly directed
specifically at the insurance industry. The Acquista Decision precludes insurance companies
(not businesses or individuals generally) from denying and/or terminating insurance benefits
in bad faith. Acquista, 285 A.D.2d 73. In support of this proscription, the Court in Acquista
focused upon the public policy imperatives of insurance law generally and over-arching
relationship/dynamic between insureds and insurers specifically. Id. at 77-82.
Moreover, in justifying the need for the proscription against bad faith set forth in
Acquista, the Court relied exclusively upon grounds specific to the insurance industry,
stating:
We consider the need for this form of damages to be apparent. The problem
of dilatory tactics by insurance companies seeking to delay and avoid payment
12

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Document 19

Filed 10/31/2007

Page 14 of 24

of proper claims has apparently become widespread enough to prompt most
states to respond with some sort of remedy for aggrieved policyholders.
Acquista, 285 A.D.2d at 81. As set forth in the Amended Complaint, "from a common-sense
perspective," the Ac ui to Decision is aimed at, or specifically directed to the insurance
industry in New York and is integral to the relationship between insureds and insurers in
New York (Amended Complaint, ¶118) (emphasis added). Trapanatto, 1996 WL 417519,
at * 1 (finding that from a common sense perspective, state statute that required insurers to
reimburse policy holders for certain costs of medical treatment for children was "aimed at"
the insurance industry) (emphasis added); Lewis v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare. Inc., 78 F. Supp.
2d 1202, 1213 (N.D. Okla. 1999) (finding that from a common sense perspective, state
statute was "specifically directed" at the insurance industry because it required insurers to
pay claims promptly and in good faith) (emphasis added); Selby v. Principal Mutual Life Ins.
Co., 2000 WL 178191, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2000) (from a common sense perspective,
state statute was "specifically directed" at the insurance industry because it required insurers
to provide benefits in accordance with New York law).
The Verizon Defendants' comparison of this case to Pilot Life is inapposite, because
the "roots" of the Mississippi law prohibiting bad faith, which was preempted by ERISA in
that case, was "firmly planted in the general principles of Mississippi tort and contract law
[such that] my breach of contract, and not merely breach of an insurance contract, may lead
to [liability]." Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 50 (emphasis added). The Acquista Decision, unlike
the Mississippi law in Pilot Life, " is a rule firmly applied to insurance contracts, not a
13

Page 15 of 24

general principle guiding a court's discretion in a range of matters." num , 526 U.S. at 371.
Accordingly, the Acquista Decision survives preemption under the "common sense" inquiry,
because like the state laws in num , Trapanatt o, Lewis , and Selby, it imposes industry-wide
conditions on the insurance business , specifically.'
Second, as noted above, in determining whether a law "regulates insurance ," courts
interpret the phrase, `business of insurance,' under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. This
analysis includes consideration of three factors ("Factor(s)"): (1) whether the practice has the
effect of transferring or spreading a policy holder's risk; (2) whether the practice is an
integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and (3 ) whether
the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry ." Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 48-9;
MetLife, 471 U.S. at 743. These Factors also support holding that the Acquista Decision is
saved from preemption in this case.
The first Factor weighs against preemption because the Acquista Decision can easily
be read to affect the transfer or spread of a policy holder ' s risk. Among the reasons
consumers purchase insurance is to "protect himself/herself' against the risks of accidental
losses and the mental stress which could result from such losses." Lewis , 78 F. Supp. 2d at
1212-13. And insurance companies are "well -aware" that consumers seek this "peace of
mind." Id. Absent this " peace of mind," consumers would be unwilling to transfer or spread

'Upon establishing that the common sense analysis supports a finding that a state law claim is nQ
preempted, no further analysis under the McCarron -Ferguson Act is required . Trapan atto, 1996 WL
417519 at *7. Nonetheless, we undertake the McCarron-Ferguson Act analysis as well, inasmuch as it,
too, supports finding that Dov's claim is not preempted.

14

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Page 16 of 24

any risk to insurance companies.
The second Factor, which questions whether the practice is integral to the policy
relationship between the insurers and insured, also tends towards holding that the Ac uista
Decision regulates insurance. In determining that consequential damages may be appropriate
for "breach of the insurer's duty of good faith," the court in Acquista recognizes that "a
fundamental injustice may result when a traditional contract analysis is applied to
circumstances where insurance claims were denied despite the insurers' lack of a reasonable
basis to deny them." Acquista, 285 A.D.2d at 78-80 (emphasis added). This basis for the
Acquista Decision is plainly an integral part of the relationship between the insurer and
policyholder, because it expressly distinguishes itself from application to contracting parties
in general, and most importantly, "dictates the terms of the relationship between the insurer
and insured." See Unum Life, 526 U.S. at 374; MetLife, 471 U.S. at 743.
The third Factor, whether the practice is limited to the insurance business, also
supports holding that the Acquista Decision is exempted from preemption. As an initial
matter, defendants make no effort to proffer any authority in which liability under the
Acquista Decision has been applied outside the context of the insurance industry. See Lewis,
78 F. Supp. 2d at 1213 (recognizing lack of universal application weighs against
preemption); Franklin H. Williams, 50 F.3d at 150-51 (recognizing that statutes which merely
impact the insurance industry but that are based in contract or tort are often preempted). As
explained above, the Acquista Decision "does not merely have an impact on the insurance

15

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Filed 10/31/2007

Page 17 of 24

industry; it is aimed at it." See Unum, 526 U.S. at 375 (recognizing that the common sense
finding parallels the third McCarran-Ferguson Factor) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).
Accordingly, both common sense and the McCarran-Ferguson Factors dictate that the
Ac uista Decision distinctively and exclusively regulates insurance, thereby exempting Dov's
State Claim from preemption under ERISA.
II
DOV'S FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION STATES A CLAIM
Dov's fourth cause of action properly seeks lie novo consideration of Verizon's De
Facto Rejection. First, defendants cite no authority for their naked proposition that "[the
fourth cause of action] is not a `cause of action' under ERISA's civil enforcement provision,
ERISA 502(a), but simply an interpretation of the Plan's terms that would need to be
resolved as party of Count I as a matter of course" (Def. Mem., p.11). Moreover, allegations
regarding the appropriate standard of review properly withstand motions to dismiss. Nahoun
v. Employees' Pension Plan of Credit Suisse First Boston, 2005 WL 1476453, at *1
(S.D.N.Y. 2005); Erbe v. Billeter, 2007 WL 2905890, at *6 (W.D. Pa. 2007).
III
DEFENDANTS' FAILURE TO INCLUDE DOV IN THE PROPER
PLAN AND MAINTAIN HIS PENSION BENEFITS CONSTITUTES
BREACH OF A FIDUCIARY DUTY AND WARRANTS EQUITABLE
RESTITUTION AMONG OTHER REMEDIES
Breach of a fiduciary duty is an actionable claim under ERISA, warranting equitable
relief. See , Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 210 (2002);

Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 507 ( 1996); Simeon v. The Mount Sinai Medical
Center, 150 F. Supp. 2d 598, 603 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Under ERISA , plan fiduciaries are
required to:
discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries and(A) for the exclusive purpose of:
(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and
(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.
29 U.S.C. § 1104. Accordingly, "to participate knowingly and significantly in deceiving a
plan's beneficiaries in order to save the employer money and the beneficiaries' expense is
not to act `solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries . . ." Varity Corp. v.
Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 507 (1996).
ERISA further requires plan fiduciaries to furnish certain materials, particularly plan
summaries and descriptions, to participants or beneficiaries, using "measures reasonably
calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material." Simeon, 150 F. Supp.2d at 603
(defendants violated fiduciary duties by "failing to provide the plaintiff with required
information and misleading her such that she failed to enroll in the Plan and obtain its
benefits"), citing 29 U.S.C. § 1024(b);9 als sue, Swanson v. U.A. Local 13 Pension Plan, et

9To the extent that Dov did not assert a particular cause of action pursuant to ERISA § 1024(b),
this court should infer such a claim based on the facts asserted and conform the pleadings accordingly.
"[This] approach is consistent with the Second Circuit's holding that a pleading is sufficient where it sets
forth the factual allegations supporting the elements of a claim, even if it fails to identify the specific law
under which it brings a claim." Harrison v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 417 F. Supp. 2d, 424, 434 (2d Cir.
2006), citing Marburg Mgmt.. Inc. v. Kohn, 629 F.2d 705, 712 n. 4 (2d Cir. 1980).

al., 779 F. Supp. 690, 700 (W.D.N.Y. 1991) (suggesting that misinforming or misleading
plan participants may give rise to breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA to correctly and
adequately inform participants about their rights and obligations); Chambless v. Masters
Mates & Pilots Pension Plan, 602 F. Supp . 904, 910-11 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) ( finding trustees'
failure to fully disclose plan amendment, which resulted in forfeiture and/or reduction of
accrued and vested pension benefits constituted breach of a fiduciary duty).
The Verizon Defendants reject Dov ' s claim for "equitable restitution" as legal and not
equitable in nature, and thus, duplicative of Dov's claim for damages asserted in Dov's first
cause of action, (which is not at issue on this motion ) (Def. Mem ., pp.3-6). In doing so, the
Verizon Defendants parochially assert that money damages are rarely , if ever, awarded as
"other equitable relief' under ERISA (Id.). Contrary to the Verizon Defendants' assertions,
"[e]quity sometimes awards monetary relief, or the equivalent , and restitution is both a legal
and an equitable remedy that is monetary yet is distinct from damages ." Clair v. Harris Trust
& Savs. Bank, 190 F .3d 495, 498-99 (7th Cir. 1999) ( emphasis added). In Great-West, for
example, the Supreme Court confirmed that "whether [restitution] is legal or equitable
depends on the basis for the plaintiff s claim and the nature of the underlying remedies
sought." Great-West, 534 U. S. at 210. In recognizing that monetary equitable relief maybe
appropriate under ERISA, Great-West provides that "equitable relief must mean something

18

less than all relief," and defines "equitable restitution" as a "constructive trust or equitable
lien, where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff
could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant's possession." Id. at
213 (citations omitted).
The courts have declined to dismiss claims that request monetary relief for breach of
fiduciary duty as an equitable remedy under ERISA, where the relief requested falls outside
of ERISA's specific remedy provisions., Simeon, 150 F. SUPP. 2d at 603 (recognizing
that plaintiffs claim for employer's contribution to her plan due to defendants' failure to
disclose information properly under ERISA constitutes "other equitable relief' and "not
precluded by ERISA's specific remedy provisions"). Also see, Great-West, 534 U.S. at 2l 1
(recognizing that specific performance "to enforce an obligor's duty to make future monthly
payments, after the obligor had consistently refused to make past payments concededly due,"
is "other equitable relief' available under ERISA); Dunnigan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
277 F.3d 223, 229 (2d Cir. 2002) (recognizing that a monetary award of interest on late
payments of benefits is recoverable as "other equitable relief' under ERISA). This is
precisely the type of relief Dov seeks in this case.
As reflected in the Amended Complaint, Dov seeks equitable restitution of specific
pension funds that should have, but apparently did not accrue in his favor following his
wrongful termination, as a result of defendants' breach of fiduciary duties (Amended
Complaint ¶110). As reflected above, defendants ignored their fiduciary obligations under

19

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Document 19

Filed 10/31/2007

Page 21 of 24

ERISA. First, defendants failed to apprise Dov of the October 2001 Transfer Option, which
resulted in , inter alia, Dov's wrongful termination and defendants ' improper retention of
pension funds that should have accrued in Dov's favor . Moreover, Dov remains in the dark
with respect to which plan governs his benefits .

The record aptly demonstrates that

defendants sent Dov contradictory , confusing, and misleading communications, which
ultimately misinformed Dov regarding the status of his disability benefits and his entitlement
thereto . S discussion supra, regarding the discrepancies among Dov's benefits under the
Verizon Directive, the Verizon Confirmation, the Legacy Plan, Unum's July 14 Letter, and
Verizon's August 3rd Letter . Defendants' conduct is so egregious and inexcusable, and
suggestive of some ulterior, self-serving motive that it is aside from and in breach of their
"exclusive," fiduciary obligations under ERISA (Amended Complaint, ¶96).
In seeking to dismiss Dov's second cause of action , the Verizon Defendants further
allege that Dov failed to request "appropriate " equitable relief under ERISA (Def. Mem.,
p.8). Defendants are wrong -- Dov's claim to equitable relief under § 503(a)(3) is
"appropriate," because ERISA may not provide adequate relief elsewhere, (such as in §
502(a)(1)(B), as plaintiffs incorrectly assert). The situation in this case is directly analogous
to this Court's decision in Simeon, 150 F. Supp. 2d 598. In Simeon an employee sought
equitable relief under ERISA § 503(a)(3) to remedy her employer's breach of fiduciary duty,
for "failing to advise her in her right to enroll in the Plan and by failing to facilitate her
enrollment in the plan." Simeon, 150 F. Supp. at 601-602. Like the defendants in ime n,

20

Case 1:07-cv-06963-CM

Document 19

Filed 10/31/2007

Page 22 of 24

defendants in the case at bar failed to demonstrate that the ERISA plan administrators gave
Dov adequate notice of the existence of the Plan and the benefits to which he would be
entitled. Id. at 603. The Simeon court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss therein, and
stressed that there may be no specific provision providing specific relief for a violation of
this duty. Id.; also see, Varity Corp., 516 U.S. at 515 (recognizing that plaintiffs are entitled
to "other equitable relief' where ERISA otherwise may not provide a remedy). Dov is
entitled to the same consideration here. While ERISA may provide the appropriate vehicle
to redress Dov's claim for back payment of benefits wrongfully withheld, as Dov asserts in
his first cause of action, only ERISA's provision providing for "other equitable relief' can
certainly and appropriately restore Dov's pension benefits. Accordingly, Dov's second cause
of action should not be dismissed.
IV
DOV IS ENTITLED TO A JURY TRIAL
The Verizon Defendants also seek to strike Dov's request for a jury trial. Relying on,
inter alia, Sullivan v. LTV Aerospace & Def. Co., 82 F.3d 1251, 1257-59 (2d Cir. 1996), the
Verizon Defendants baldly assert that Dov is not entitled to a jury trial because the "Second
Circuit has held on numerous occasions that there is no right to a jury trial under ERISA"
(Def. Mem., p.11). As discussed infra, the Verizon Defendants are wrong because Dov's
claims arise under ERISA and independent state grounds.

21

Page 23 of 24

Although jury trials may be inappropriate in most cases10 arising under ERISA, Dov
is entitled to a jury on his State Claim. See, g., McCauley v. First Unum Life Ins. Co., 1998
WL 846121, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.) (recognizing that where a "common law claim is still at stake
[the plaintiff's] right to a jury trial remains intact"); Smith v. Rochester Tel. Bus. Marketing
Corp., 786 F. Supp. 293, 310 (W.D.N.Y. 1992) (refusing to strike jury demand in case
involving ERISA where state law claims were implicated). Accordingly, the Verizon
Defendants' motion to strike Dov's jury demand should be denied.
V
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COURT IS DISPOSED TO FIND THAT
TECHNICAL DEFICIENCIES RENDER DOV'S CLAIMS FACIALLY
DEFICIENT, DOV IS ENTITLED TO REPLEAD
To the extent that the Court agrees with the Verizon Defendants and it is determined
that Dov's allegations fail to state a proper cause of action under ERISA or state law, Dov
is entitled to seek leave to replead. See, Carpenters' Local Union No. 964 Pension Fund

10It is worth noting that the Verizon Defendants' outdated, bare allegation under Sullivan grossly
misstates the applicable law. In fact, the Southern District recognizes that the Seventh Amendment entitles
a litigant to a jury trial on ERISA claims that are "legal" in nature. 5-=.(L&, Bona v. Barash, 2003 WL
1395932, at *33 (S.D.N.Y.) (affording plaintiffs-ERISA plan beneficiaries a jury trial for legal damages
resulting from trustees' mismanagement of plaintiffs' funds). "The foundation supporting the rationale of
the Court in Sulli has ... been mortally eroded by [the Supreme Court's decision in] Great West."
Evan S. Schwartz & Michail Z. Hack, Supreme Court Ruling Undermines Jury Trial Ban, N.Y.L.J., June
15, 2006, at 5, (col. 1). And following Great-West, the court in Design Strategies noted that "at least two
circuits, and some in this [Southern] District, have stated that `when a breach of fiduciary duty claim is
predicated upon underlying conduct `which is actionable in a direct suit at common law,' the jury should
decide whether there has been a breach of fiduciary duty ... conduct that breaches a fiduciary duty might
also violate other legal rules; it might constitute a tort (such as fraud) or breach of contract." Desim
Strategies. Inc. v. Davis, 367 F. Supp. 2d 630, 638 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), citing Page Mill Asset Mgmt_ v.

Co., 323 F.2d 826, 837 (9th Cir. 1963); Halladay v. Verschoor, 381 F.2d 100, 109 (8th Cir. 1967); In Re
Evangelist, 760 F.2d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1985) (internal citations omitted)).

v. Silverman, 1995 WL 378539, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ( acknowledging that plaintiff
properly replead ERISA claims following dismissal without prejudice, of claims arising

to replead and cure deficiencies upon dismissal for failure to state a cause of action).
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons , Dov is entitled to denial of the Verizon Defendants'
motion in all respects.
