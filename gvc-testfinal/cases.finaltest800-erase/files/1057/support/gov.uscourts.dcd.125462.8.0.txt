DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
IN SUPPORT OF HIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
INTRODUCTION
This case arises under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the
Privacy Act of 1974 (“the Privacy Act” or “PA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Plaintiff, an organization by
the name of Federal Cure (“FedCure”), challenges a determination by the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (“BOP”), a component of the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), that FedCure
neither qualified for a fee waiver nor a fee reduction in connection with a FOIA request which
Plaintiff sent to the BOP for records pertaining to the use of ion spectrometer scanning
equipment in BOP facilities.1 At issue in this summary judgment motion is: (1) whether BOP
1

The merits of ion spectrometry technology and its use by the BOP is not before this
Court, only the propriety of the BOP’s denial of Plaintiff’s request for a fee waiver or reduction
in connection with its FOIA request. However, by way of background, Defendant here provides
some information about ion spectrometry for the benefit of the Court. Ion spectrometry
technology is designed to detect the presence of microscopic traces of illegal drugs on noninmates and their clothing and belongings. See, e.g., 72 Fed. Reg. 31178-01, *31178-79 (June 6,
2007) (explaining in considerable detail the scientific basis and policy rationale underlying the
technology and its use in the nation’s prisons); Gray v. Bruce, 2001 W.L. 1580940, **1, n. 1
(10th Cir. 2001) (noting that “[i]n ion spectrometer testing, a damp cotton swab is rubbed against

properly denied Plaintiff’s request for a fee waiver, and (2) whether Plaintiff qualifies for a fee
reduction under either the “representative of the news media” or the “noncommercial scientific
institution” fee categories. As is explained below, BOP’s decisions as to these matters were
entirely reasonable and lawful and should be sustained by this Court.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
By letter to BOP’s FOIA/PA unit dated February 25, 2005, Kenneth Linn, the Chairman
of FedCure, submitted a request for information under the FOIA and Privacy Act on behalf of his
organization. See Exhibit (“Ex.”) 1, Declaration of Wilson J. Moorer (“Moorer Decl.”) ¶ 3, Ex.
A to Moorer Decl.; Ex. 2 (February 25, 2005 Letter from Kenneth Linn of FedCure to the BOP)2;
see also Docket Entry No. 1, Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Obtain
Freedom of Information Act Information (“Compl.”) ¶ 10. Mr. Linn’s FOIA/Privacy Act request
was for the following:
1) all information about the accuracy of the ion spectrometer scanning method and
the number of visitors turned away at all BOP facilities (by facility) because of the
results of the scanning method since institution of its use, 2) all information
relating to the training methods used for personnel operating this equipment and
staff comments as to these methods and 3) all records of equipment failure and
repairs.

the clothing or skin of an individual and then placed in a machine for analysis” and that
“[a]ccording to the Federal Bureau of Prisons . . . the basis of ion drug and explosives detection
technology is the collection and vaporization of atmospheric particulate; ionized vapors drift
through the ion mobility spectrometer at different speeds, depending on their structure and size,
and the speed at which the ions move provides a distinct ‘thumbprint’ that identifies the original
substance.”); United States v. Belwood, 222 F.3d 403, 405 n. 5 (7th Cir.2000).

See Ex. 2 (February 25, 2005 Letter from Kenneth Linn of FedCure to the BOP); see also Ex. 1,
Moorer Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A; Compl. ¶ 11. In this initial request, Mr. Linn did not request a fee
waiver. See Ex. 2 (February 25, 2005 Letter from Kenneth Linn of FedCure to the BOP); see
also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl., Ex. A.
Mr. Linn’s February 25, 2005 FOIA request was received by BOP’s FOIA/PA office in
Washington, D.C. on March 7, 2005. See Ex. 2 (date stamp, indicating receipt of February 25,
2005 Letter by BOP’s FOIA/PA section on that date); Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A. Mr.
Linn’s February 25, 2005 FOIA request was logged into the BOP’s FOIA database on March 9,
2005 and assigned the FOIA Request Number 2005-03326. See Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 4.
In a letter dated April 4, 2005, BOP’s FOIA/PA office responded to Mr. Linn’s FOIA
request. See Ex. 3 (April 4, 2005 Letter from BOP to Plaintiff); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl.
¶¶ 4-5, Ex. B to Moorer Decl.. In that letter, BOP’s FOIA/PA office informed Mr. Linn that:
After a careful review of your request, it has been determined it will take an
estimated 142 hours of search time to locate the above requested information.
[i.e., the material which Plaintiff had requested.] In accordance with 28 C.F.R.
§ 16.11(c)(1)(ii), the cost for staff time involved in the search of this information
is assessed at $7.00 per quarter hour for professional time.
Therefore, you are being charged $7.00 per quarter hour for an estimated 142
hours for a cost of $3,976.00. This amount does not include a duplication fee of
.10 cents per page of information reproduced as a result of the search.
See Id. (emphasis in original); see also Compl. ¶ 12. The April 2005 letter further explained that:
In accordance with 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(i)(2), we can require advance payment of
fees in excess of $250.00. Therefore, should you require this office to proceed
with your request, please submit a check or money order, payable to the Treasury
of the United States, in the amount of $3,976.00 within 30 days to this office at
the above address so that we may begin retrieval and review of these records.

Moorer Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. B to Moorer Decl..
On August 18, 2005, BOP’s FOIA/PA office in Washington, D.C. received a faxed copy
of a letter from Mr. Linn dated April 20, 2005. See Ex. 4 (August 18, 2005 Fax Cover Sheet and
April 20, 2005 letter from Mr. Linn to BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 5,
Ex. C to Moorer Decl.3. In this letter, Mr. Linn requested that the BOP waive the $3,976.00 fee
which BOP had indicated would be charged for the search time required to respond to his FOIA
request as well as a waiver of any copy fees. Id.; Compl. ¶ 13.
Mr. Linn asserted in his April 20, 2005 letter that “FedCure is a non-profit organization
with less than $5,000.00 in yearly donations” and claimed that “[w]e publish a newsletter that is
received by members of the public as well as maintain a website with regular daily news
updates.” Id. He also argued in the letter that Fedcure qualified for a fee waiver because:
(1) “[w]e are considered a ‘noncommercial scientific institution’ since we are involved in the
social sciences, keep an extensive library, can be called a ‘think tank,’ and devote time and
resources to research and dissemination of information on matters of public interest”; (2) “[w]e
are a representative of the news media through our regular newsletters”; and (3) “[t]he
information sought is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations of the government and is certainly not in the commercial interest
of the requestor.” Id.
Mr. Linn further represented in the letter that FedCure had “received numerous requests
from the public for the information requested,” that it “intend[ed] to publish the response in [its]

newsletter and on [its] website,” that the “information had value to the public-particularly those
who regularly visit incarcerated federal inmates,” and that FedCure was “the world’s leading
expert in matters relating to federal inmates.” See Ex. 4 (April 20, 2005 letter from Mr. Linn to
BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also Ex. 1, Ex. C to Moorer Decl.
In a letter dated September 26, 2005, the BOP’s FOIA/PA Office responded to Mr. Linn’s
request for a fee waiver. See Ex. 5 (September 26, 2005 letter from BOP’s FOIA/PA office to
Mr. Linn); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶¶ 6-8, Ex. D to Moorer Decl.. It that letter, BOP’s
FOIA/PA office noted that “[t]he statutory test for evaluating fee waiver requests is whether
release of the information ‘is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in
the commercial interest of the requester,’ in which event a fee waiver or reduction is required by
law.” Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. §552 (a)(4)(A)(iii)). It also noted that the “six factors used in the
determination as to whether a sufficient contribution to the public understanding of government
operations or activities would result from disclosure, so as to warrant the granting of a fee
waiver” are as follows:
1) whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or
activities of the government”; 2) whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to
an understanding of government operations or activities; 3) whether disclosure of
the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the general
public at large; 4) whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to
public understanding of government operations and activities; 5) whether the
requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested
disclosure; and 6) whether any such commercial interest outweighs the public
interest in disclosure.
Id. BOP’s FOIA/PA office advised Mr. Linn that “[o]n the basis of all the information you
provided” as well as an analysis of the above mentioned six factors, “we have concluded that
5

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Page 8 of 50

your request for a waiver of fees is denied.” Id.; Compl. ¶ 14. It noted that, in reaching this
conclusion, it had analyzed the definitions of a “noncommercial scientific institution” and a
“representative of the news media,” set forth in 5 U.S.C. §552(a), and had determined that
FedCure did not satisfy either of these definitions. See Ex. 5, September 26, 2005 letter from
BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. D to Moorer Decl..
The September 26, 2005 letter repeated the fee information which had been set forth in
the April 4, 2005 letter, and advised Mr. Linn that he could either: (1) agree to pay the fee, in
which case his FOIA request would be processed; or (2) file a written appeal of the denial of his
request for a fee waiver with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)’s Office of Information and
Privacy (“OIP”). See Ex. 5, September 26, 2005 letter from BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also
Ex. D to Moorer Decl..
By letter dated November 1, 2005, and received on November 9, 2005, Mr. Linn appealed
the BOP FOIA/PA’s fee waiver denial to the OIP. See Ex. 6 (Mr. Linn’s November 1, 2005
letter to the OIP); see also Compl. ¶ 15; Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. E to Moorer Decl.. In his
appeal letter, Mr. Linn argued that FedCURE met the definition of a “representative of the news
media” and a “noncommercial scientific think tank,” and that the information it sought was in the
public interest. See Ex. 6 (Mr. Linn’s November 1, 2005 letter to the OIP). In an attempt to
support these legal contentions, Mr. Linn made the following assertions in his November 2005
letter: (1) “FedCure is the largest private organization dealing with federal inmate issues”;
(2) FedCure’s “website, which provides timely news for the public has been up for about two
years and has already had over 250,000 hits”; (3) “[i]ts chat site at Yahoo groups has as many as
100 requests for information each day”; (4) “FedCure is a 501(c)(3) non-profit” whose “directors

and staff serve with no pay”; (5) “[t]he primary function of FedCure is to provide information to
the public about the workings of the Bureau of Prisons”; (6) “FedCure has received hundreds of
questions and complaints about the workings of the Bureau of Prisons” and “[i]n particular,
FedCure has received hundreds of questions and complaints about ion spectrometer procedures
and the reasoning behind their use”; (7) “[t]he general public is interested in the use of these
machines” and “disclosure would ‘significantly’ answer the public’s questions”; and (8)
“FedCure has no commercial interest whatsoever in the disclosure.” See Ex. 6 (Mr. Linn’s
November 1, 2005 letter to the OIP); see also Compl. ¶ 15; Ex. E to Moorer Decl..
In a letter dated June 29, 2006, OIP informed Mr. Linn that it had concluded that BOP
had properly denied FedCure’s request for a waiver of fees. See Ex. 7 (OIP’s June 29, 2006
letter to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. F to Moorer Decl.; Compl. ¶ 16. OIP
described the statutory standard for evaluating fee waiver requests, set forth in 4 U.S.C.
§§ 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). See Ex. 7 (OIP’s June 29, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. F to
Moorer Decl.. OIP indicated that in determining whether FedCure had satisfied this statutory
standard, it had considered the six factor test set out in the implementing DOJ’s regulation at 28
C.F.R. § 16.11(k), and noted that “[t]he first four of these factors concern the ‘public interest’
requirement; the fifth and sixth concern whether your interest in the records is primarily
commercial.” Id.
OIP explained that “[a]lthough the records you seek concern, in part, the operations of
BOP, and you do not appear to have an overriding commercial interest in the records, you have
not satisfied other factors, most significantly factors two, three, and four of the statutory public
interest requirement.” Id.; Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 9. Specifically, OIP noted that Mr. Linn had
7

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 10 of 50

not adequately addressed the public interest requirement imposed by the FOIA, but instead had
merely paraphrased the statutory standard. See Ex. 7 (OIP’s June 29, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn);
Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. F to Moorer Decl.. OIP further indicated that Mr. Linn had failed to
adequately demonstrate that FedCURE is able to disseminate information to the public, noting
that FedCure’s “newsletter” was only available on its website and was released on an infrequent
and irregular basis, with gaps as long as two years between some issuances. See Ex. 7 (OIP’s
June 29, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn) at 2. Moreover, OIP noted that the public interest requirement
had also not been satisfied inasmuch as there was no evidence that FedCURE intended to
“extract, analyze, synthesize, and effectively convey” the highly technical information Mr. Linn
had requested for the benefit of the public. Id at 2. In addition, OIP explained that, for a variety
of reasons, FedCure had failed to demonstrate that it was either a “representative of the news
media” or a “noncommercial scientific institution.” See id. at 3-4. Accordingly, OIP denied
FedCure’s appeal. Id.
Mr. Linn submitted a “Reconsideration of Appeal Denial” to OIP dated July 10, 2006.
See Ex. 8 (Mr. Linn’s July 10, 2006 letter to OIP); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. G to
Moorer Decl.. In his reconsideration letter, Mr. Linn requested that the OIP reconsider its
decision, based on a recent U.S. District Court for District of Columbia opinion regarding the
granting of a fee waiver to a requester who had submitted a request to the BOP: Prison Legal
News v. Harley G. Lappin, Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Civil Action No. 05-1812, 2006
W.L. 1737483 (D.D.C. June 26, 2006). Id.
On November 8, 2006, OIP responded to Plaintiff’s request for “Reconsideration of
Appeal Denial.” See Ex. 9 (OIP’s November 8, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. 1, Moorer

Decl. ¶ 11; Ex. H to Moorer Decl.. In that letter, OIP informed Mr. Linn that it had determined
that its decision of June 29, 2006 was appropriate, and set forth several reasons why the decision
which Mr. Linn had cited in his July 10, 2006 request for reconsideration was distinguishable and
did not support Mr. Linn’s request for a fee waiver. Id.
On May 7, 2007, Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a Complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia, in which it alleged that BOP’s denial of its waiver was
improper, requested declaratory relief (a judgment that BOP’s denial of the fee waiver was
unlawful), injunctive relief (an order that BOP grant the requested fee waiver and produce the
requested documents without charging that fee), and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. See
Compl. generally For the reasons set forth below, this Court should uphold BOP’s
determinations that Plaintiff neither qualified for a fee waiver nor a fee reduction.
ARGUMENT
I.

Standard of Review
A.

Summary Judgment Standard

Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates summary judgment where
“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” See, e.g., Termorio S.A. E.S.P. v. Electranta S.P., 2007 W.L. 1515069, *12
(D.C. Cir. 2007); Kingman Park Civic Ass’n v. Williams, 348 F.3d 1033, 1041 (D.C. Cir. 2003);
Washington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 865 F.2d 320, 325 (D.C. Cir.
1989). As the Supreme Court has declared, “[s]ummary judgment procedure is properly regarded
not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a
whole, which are designed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every
9

action.” See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986) (emphasis added).
In this case, the agency Defendant has filed a declaration with this pleading by a Wilson
J. Moorer, a BOP employee with 19 years of experience at the BOP and three years of experience
in BOP’s FOIA/PA office, who is familiar with the fee waiver provisions of the FOIA, his
agency’s implementing regulations, and with Plaintiff’s specific FOIA request and fee waiver
request and the bases for his office’s denial of that request. See Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. generally.
Defendant has also attached relevant correspondence. Since Defendant’s declaration and this
correspondence demonstrate that BOP’s denial of Plaintiff’s fee waiver request was lawful, and
the pleadings and other filings show no genuine issue as to any material fact, the Defendant is
entitled to summary judgment.
B.

The FOIA Statute Provides for De Novo Review of Fee Waiver Decisions, but
this Review is Limited to the Record Before the Agency

The FOIA statute provides that “[i]n any action by a requester regarding the waiver of
fees . . . the court shall determine the matter de novo,” but instructs that “the court's review of the
matter shall be limited to the record before the agency.” See 5 U.S.C.A. § 552(a)(4)(A)(vii)
(emphasis added); see also Campbell v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 35 (D.C.
Cir. 1998); D.C. Technical Assistance Org. v. U.S. Dep’t of Housing and Urban Development,
85 F.Supp.2d 46, 48 (D.D.C. 2000) (noting that “[t]he decision of an agency to grant or deny a
fee waiver request is reviewed de novo, looking only to the administrative record before the
agency at the time of the decision”); Rozet v. Dep’t of Housing and Urban Development, 59
F.Supp.2d 55, 56 (D.D.C. 1999) (noting that “[d]enials of requests for fee waivers must be

10

reviewed de novo . . .”).4 Thus, this Court is required to review the record which was before the
BOP when the BOP rendered its decisions on plaintiff’s fee waiver request.5 This record
includes: (1) Mr. Linn’s initial FOIA request dated February 25, 2005; (2) BOP’s April 4, 2005
letter to Mr. Linn; (3) Mr. Linn’s letter dated April 20, 2005 transmitted via facismile on August
18, 2005; (4) BOP’s September 26, 2005 letter to Mr. Linn; (5) Mr. Linn’s November 1, 2005
appeal letter to OIP; (6) OIP’s June 29, 2006 appeal determination; (7) Mr. Linn’s July 10, 2006
Request for Reconsideration of the OIP’s appeal determination; and (8) the OIP’s November 8,
2006 determination on reconsideration. See Ex. 1, Declaration of Wilson J. Moorer, Ex. A-H to
the Moorer Decl.; see also Ex. 2-9.
C.

A Requester Has a Significant Burden to Overcome to Show Entitlement to a
Fee Waiver Under the FOIA Statute and DOJ’s Implementing Regulations

The FOIA statute provides that “each agency shall promulgate regulations . . . specifying
the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests under this section and establishing
procedures and guidelines for determining when such fees should be waived or reduced.” See 5

4

Before 1986, the standard of review for all FOIA fee issues was the Administrative
Procedure Act’s “arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law” standard, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701706. See Larson v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 843 F.2d 1481, 1482-83 (D.C. Cir.1988) (per
curiam); Rozet, 59 F.Supp.2d at 56, n. 2. In 1986, Congress amended the statute, changing the
standard of review of fee waivers to de novo review. See Freedom of Information Act of 1986,
Pub. L. No. 99-570, 1804(b)(1), 100 Stat. 3207-50; Rozet, 59 F.Supp.2d at 56, n. 2.
5

The de novo review standard of only the record existing before the agency at the time
the agency rendered its fee waiver denial is applied equally to plaintiffs and defendants in FOIA
cases. This standard prevents a requester from supplementing the record during litigation with
new or better reasons that the fee waiver should be granted than he or she articulated while
before the agency. See, e.g., Nat’l Treasury Employees Union v. Griffin, 811 F.2d 644, 648
(D.C. Cir.1987) (“Griffin”) (declaring that a plaintiff-requester’s “failure to demonstrate a public
interest before the agency cannot be remedied by doing so before a court”); see also Jarvik v.
C.I.A., 495 F. Supp. 2d 67, 71 (D.D.C. 2007).

U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i); see also id. at § 552(a)(3)(A) (requiring that FOIA requests be “made in
accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be
followed”). The FOIA further instructs that an agency’s “[f]ee schedules shall provide for the
recovery of only the direct costs of search, duplication, or review” and that “[n]o agency may
require advance payment of any fee unless the requester has previously failed to pay fees in a
timely fashion, or the agency has determined that the fee will exceed $250.” See 5 U.S.C.
§§ 552(a)(4)(iv), 552(a)(4)(v). The FOIA also directs that fees be set at different levels,
depending on whether the “records are . . . sought for commercial use” and whether the request is
made by “an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or
scientific research” or “a representative of the news media”:
[s]uch agency regulations shall provide that-(I) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search,
duplication, and review, when records are requested for commercial use;
(II) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication
when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an
educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or
scientific research; or a representative of the news media; and
(III) for any request not described in (I) or (II), fees shall be limited to reasonable
standard charges for document search and duplication.
See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).
The FOIA statute also provides that “[d]ocuments shall be furnished without charge . . . if
disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Thus, to
qualify for a fee waiver under the FOIA statute, a requester must satisfy a two-prong statutory
12

test. The requester must show that: (1) “disclosure of the information is in the public interest
because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or
activities of the government” and (2) that “disclosure of the information is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester.” See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); Larson v. CIA, 843 F.2d
1481, 1482-83 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“Larson”) (describing the provision as utilizing a “two-pronged
analysis”); Schrecker v. DOJ, 970 F. Supp. 49, 50 (D.D.C. 1997) (“Schrecker”).
The statutory requirements however are not all that a requester must satisfy to qualify for
a fee waiver. Pursuant to the statutory mandate it has been given to promulgate fee regulations,
see 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(3)(A), 552(a)(4)(A), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has promulgated
guidelines which “components” of DOJ are to follow in determining when fees should be
waived, and these regulatory requirements must be satisfied before a fee waiver may be granted.
See 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.11(a)-(k).6 BOP is a “component” of DOJ for purposes of these regulations.
See, e.g., 46 Fed. Reg. 7953-02, 7955, available at 1981 W.L. 111105, 7955 (Jan. 26, 1981)
(observing that “[t]he Bureau of Prisons, a component of the U.S. Department of Justice, is
responsible for providing custody and care to committed Federal offenders in an integrated
system of correctional institutions across the nation”); Cawthon v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 2006
W.L. 581250, *1, n. 1 (D.D.C. 2006); Prison Legal News v. Lappin, 436 F.Supp.2d 17, 21
(D.D.C. 2006) (noting BOP’s “status as a component agency of the DOJ”).
6

The statute and the regulations compiled by the agency must both be taken into
consideration when a fee waiver denial is being adjudicated. See, e.g., Schrecker, 970 F. Supp. at
50 (explaining that [s]atisfying these two prongs [of the test under the statute], while necessary,
is not always sufficient to justify a fee waiver” and proceeding to describe the regulatory
requirements applicable to such requests); D.C. Technical Assistance Organization, 85 F. Supp.
2d at 48; Campbell, 164 F.3d at 35; Samuel Gruber Education Project v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 24

DOJ regulations set forth a six-factor analysis to structure a DOJ component’s
consideration of the statutory two-prong test. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k). The first four factors
address the “public-interest” prong, and the latter two factors the “commercial-interest” prong.
Id. at § 16.11(k)(2). Of particular relevance to this case, in determining the public interest aspect
of the fee waiver issue, a DOJ component (and this Court) must consider the following four
factors:
(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records
concerns “the operations or activities of the government.” The subject of the
requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal
government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the
disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations
or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be
meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be
“likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or
activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in
either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to
contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the
public's understanding.
(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to
result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will
contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must contribute to the
understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject,
as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's
expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey
information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a
representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the
disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of
government operations or activities. The public’s understanding of the subject in
question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the
disclosure, must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.
Components shall not make value judgments about whether information that
would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or
14

activities of the government is “important” enough to be made public.
See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv) (emphasis added). It is not sufficient for a requester to
establish that he satisfies some of these criteria. Rather, “[f]or a request to be in the ‘public
interest,’ [all] four criteria must be satisfied.” See, e.g., Judicial Watch v. Dep’t of Justice, 365
F. 3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see also Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2000
W.L. 33724693, *5 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding that “since Judicial Watch has failed to show
compliance with three of the four factors, Judicial Watch is not entitled to a public interest fee
waiver or reduction”).
In addition, DOJ’s regulations provide guidance regarding what sort of individuals and
entities constitute a “representative of the news media” and a “noncommerical scientific
institution” for purposes of the FOIA statute and DOJ’s implementing regulations. See 28 C.F.R.
§§ 16.11(b)(5), 16.11(b)(6).
The requester bears the burden of establishing that the statutory and regulatory
preconditions to a fee waiver, including the public interest showings, are met. See, e.g., Judicial
Watch, 365 F.3d at 1126 (“[t]he burden of satisfying the public interest standard is on the
requestor”); Larson, 843 F. 2d at 1483 (noting that “[d]espite the alterations to the statute, the
burden for satisfying the public interest standard remains on the requester”); Griffin, 811 F.2d at

public interest to be served.”); Jarvik v. C.I.A., 495 F.Supp.2d 67, 71 (D.D.C. 2007) (“Jarvik”)

establishing these two elements in the administrative record”); Prison Legal News v. Lappin, 436

Justice, 829 F.Supp. 428, 434 (D.D.C. 1993) (“The requester of the waiver has the initial burden

Coast Fork v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 110 F.3d 53, 55 (9th Cir. 1997) (“...[R]equesters bear the
initial burden of satisfying the statutory and regulatory standards for a fee waiver.).
Furthermore, although the “FOIA is to be liberally construed in favor of waivers for
noncommercial requesters,” a request for a fee waiver must be formulated with “‘reasonable
specificity’” and be “based on more than ‘conclusory allegations.’” See Judicial Watch, Inc. v.
Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted); see also Jarvik, 495
F. Supp.2d at 71 (same); Prison Legal News, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 25; Fitzgibbon v. Agency for
Int'l Dev., 724 F.Supp. 1048, 1050 (D.D.C.1989) (the requesting party bears the burden of
“identifying, with reasonable specificity, the public interest to be served.”). Indeed, “the agency
may infer a lack of substantial public interest “[w]hen a public interest is asserted but not
identified with reasonable specificity, and circumstances do not clarify the point of the
requests.’” See Larson, 843 F.2d at 1483 (citing McClellan Ecological Seepage Situation v.
Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1285 (9th Cir.1987) and Griffin, 811 F.2d at 647).
In rendering its determination on plaintiff’s fee waiver request, BOP considered the
requirements set forth in the FOIA statute, as well as in 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2), and concluded
that FedCure had failed to satisfy the public interest prong of the FOIA statute and regulations
governing FOIA fee waivers. See Ex. 5, 7, 9; see also 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R.
§ 16.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv). As is explained below, this conclusion was reasonable and entirely
consistent with these authorities.

The Record Reveals that FedCure has Failed to Establish that it Satisfies the Public
Interest Requirement Imposed by the FOIA Statute and DOJ’s Regulations, and
Thus Does Not Qualify for a Fee Waiver
A.

FedCure Does Not Qualify for a Fee Waiver By Virtue of its Non-Profit
Status, Its Small Budget, or the Fact that its Directors and Staff Allegedly
Serve Without Pay

In its submissions to the BOP and OIP and its Complaint, FedCure has referenced its
status as a § 501(c)(3) non profit organization, alleged that it has a small budget and that its
directors and staff serve without pay, and suggested that these circumstances entitle it to a FOIA
fee waiver. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 3, 6 (twice noting that “FedCURE is a § 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization . . .”); Ex. 4 (April 20, 2005 letter from Mr. Linn to BOP, requesting fee waiver and
asserting that “Fed Cure is a non-profit with less than $5000.00 in yearly donations”); Ex. 6
(November 1, 2005 letter from Mr. Linn to OIP appealing BOP’s fee denial, and stating that
“FedCure is a 501(c)(3) non-profit” whose directors and staff serve with no pay”). When this
matter was before the OIP, the OIP noted with respect to this argument, that “[w]hile nonprofit
organizations often are capable of disseminating information, they do not by virtue of their status
presumptively qualify for fee waivers.” See Ex. 7 at 2. OIP’s judgment in this regard was
consistent with longstanding precedent.
In fact, the indigence of a FOIA requester does not entitle it to a fee waiver. See, e.g.,
D.C. Technical Assistance Organization, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 48 (observing that “[c]ourts in this
jurisdiction have consistently ruled . . . that indigence alone does not entitle one to a fee
waiver”); Ely v. Postal Serv., 753 F.2d 163, 165 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (rejecting the contention that
“indigency alone is justification for waiving fees”); Durham, 829 F. Supp. at 435 & n.10
(observing that “indigency alone does not constitute adequate grounds for a fee waiver”);

Crooker v. Dep’t of the Army, 577 F. Supp. 1220, 1224 (D.D.C. 1984).
Moreover, “[a]n entity's status as a non-profit or public interest organization does not
relieve it of the burden of meeting the requirements of the statutory test for receiving a fee
waiver.” See D.C. Technical Assistance Organization, 85 F. Supp.2d at 48; Judicial Watch, Inc.
v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 122 F. Supp. 2d 13, 17 (D.D.C. 2000) (“Judicial Watch I”) (finding that
an organization’s claim that it was a ‘a non-profit, non-partisan, tax-exempt 501(c)(3)
organization which as a public interest law firm specializes in deterring, monitoring, uncovering,
and addressing public corruption in government’” is “nothing more than a general description of
Judicial Watch's organizational mission” and explaining that “[t]his description in no way
identifies the public interest that would be served through the specific FOIA request at issue in
this case.”); see also McClain v. Dep’t of Justice, 13 F.3d 220, 221 (7th Cir.1993) (recognizing
that “[e]ven a request from a newspaper or nonprofit institution would not lead to an automatic
waiver of fees” and that “nonprofit status alone does not yield free access to facts” under the
FOIA statute); Nat’l Security Archive v. Dep’t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1384 (D.C. Cir.
1989). Rather, an entity such as FedCure must establish that it satisfies the statutory and
regulatory preconditions to a fee waiver request.
B.

Plaintiff’s Fee Waiver Request and Appeal Did Not Address the Overall
Public Interest Requirement With the Specificity Courts Have Demanded

As has been mentioned, to qualify for a waiver of search and copy fees under the FOIA, a
requester must make an adequate showing that the information requested is in the public interest
and that it is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. See 5 U.S.C.
§ 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) (“[d]ocuments shall be furnished without charge . . . if disclosure of the

18

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Page 21 of 50

information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester”); see also 28 C.F.R. §16.11(k)(2)(I)-(iv) (encompassing the
first four fee waiver factors). Although BOP found that Plaintiff did “not appear to have an
overriding commercial interest in the records” sought, see Ex. 7 at 1-2, it concluded that it had
run afoul of the statutory and regulatory public interest requirement.
Mr. Linn’s submissions did not adequately address the “public interest” requirement
imposed by the FOIA statute and regulations. With respect to this issue, they merely contained
(1) statements of FedCure’s organizational mission and bona fides, (2) paraphrases of the
relevant statutory and regulatory language, (3) expressions of general interest in the material
sought, and (4) vague and conclusory language. See, e.g., Ex. 4 (April 20, 2005 letter) at 1
(stating that “Fed Cure is a non-profit,” that “FedCure is the world’s leading expert in matters
relating to federal inmates”); id. at 1 (declaring that “[t]he information sought is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations of
the government and is certainly not in the commercial interest of the requestor” and that
“FedCure has received numerous requests from the public for the information requested”); see
also Ex. 6 (November 9, 2005 appeal letter, again noting that FedCure is a “501(c)(3) nonprofit,” stating that its “primary function” is to “provide information to the public about the
workings of the Bureau of Prisons”); id. at 1 (mentioning that it “has received hundreds of
questions and complaints about ion spectrometer procedures and the reasoning behind their
use”); id. at 2 (essentially paraphrasing the six part regulatory standard set forth in 28 C.F.R.
§ 16.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv), 16.11(k)(3)(i)-(ii)).

As OIP noted in its June 29, 2006 letter denying FedCure’s appeal of BOP’s fee waiver
denial, “[s]uch limited information is insufficient to qualify FedCure for a fee waiver.” See Ex. 7
at 2. Rather, as OIP observed, FedCure’s submissions are equivalent to the statements by a
requester which the D.C. Circuit found “conclusory and insufficient” in Oglesby v. Dep’t of the
Army, 920 F.2d 57 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“Oglesby”), in which a requester stated simply that “[t]he
information requested is beneficial to the public interest” and that “I am a writer and lecturer who
has disseminated such information in the past, and I intend to do so in the future.” See Ex. 7 at 2
(citing Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 66 & n.11). As OIP further noted, Mr. Linn had “not in any way
explain[ed] how, in what manner, or why he believ[ed] that FedCure’s request meets each of the
[regulatory] fee waiver factors.” See Ex. 7 at 2.
Plaintiff’s statements in this case on the public interest issue are also comparable to those
found to be insufficiently specific in Judicial Watch I, 122 F. Supp. 2d 13 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The
Plaintiff there was found merely to have provided a “description” of “its organizational mission”
and “conclusory assertion[s]” which do not “sufficiently specif[y] the link between the
information requested and the public interest.” See Judicial Watch I, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 17 (also
noting that the requester there had merely stated that “it is a ‘non-profit, non-partisan tax exempt
501(c)(3) organization which as a public interest law firm specializes in deterring, monitoring,
uncovering, and addressing public corruption in government,’” and that “‘[t]he subject of [its]
request is information concerning the operations and activities of the government”).
In contrast with the requesters in Prison Legal News v. Lappin, 436 F. Supp. 2d 17
(D.D.C. 2006) and Judicial Watch v. Rossotti, 326 F. 3d 1309 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“Rossotti”),
Plaintiff here has not “specifically explain[ed]” how the public will benefit from the information
20

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Page 23 of 50

sought in those records. See Prison Legal News, 463 F. Supp. at 26; Rossotti, 326 F. 3d at 1313.
Certainly, the courts’ conclusion in each of those two cases, that “we cannot imagine what else
[the plaintiffs] could have said to satisfy the government’s appetite for specificity,” does not
apply here. See Prison Legal News, 463 F. Supp. at 26; Rossotti, 326 F. 3d at 1313.
Ample authority supports the OIP’s conclusion that conclusory statements of the sort
FedCure has made to date do not satisfy the statutory and regulatory “public interest”
requirement. See, e.g., Judicial Watch, 326 F.3d at 1312 (holding that a request for a fee waiver
must be formulated with “‘reasonable specificity’” and be “based on more than ‘conclusory
allegations.’”); Prison Legal News, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 25; Jarvik, 495 F. Supp.2d at 71 (same);
Fitzgibbon, 724 F.Supp. at 1050 (the requesting party bears the burden of “identifying, with
reasonable specificity, the public interest to be served.”); Larson, 843 F.2d at 1483 (explaining
that “the agency may infer a lack of substantial public interest “[w]hen a public interest is
asserted but not identified with reasonable specificity, and circumstances do not clarify the point
of the requests.’”) (citing McClellan, 835 F.2d at 1285 and Griffin, 811 F.2d at 647).
This is particularly true, in light of the fact that it is the requester who has the burden of
demonstrating that the public interest requirement is met. See, e.g., Judicial Watch, 365 F.3d at
1126 (“[t]he burden of satisfying the public interest standard is on the requestor”); Larson, 843
F.2d at 1483 (noting that “[d]espite the alterations to the statute, the burden for satisfying the
public interest standard remains on the requester”); Griffin, 811 F.2d at 648 (noting that “[a]

C.

Plaintiff has Failed to Satisfy Regulatory Fee Waiver Factors II, III, and IV:
As It Has Not Shown that Disclosure Will Significantly Contribute to an
Increased and Meaningful Understanding by a Reasonably Broad Audience
1.

Plaintiff Probably Satisfies the First Regulatory Factor: Its Request
Directly Pertains to Identifiable Operations of the Government

In rendering its determination on plaintiff’s fee waiver request, the BOP took into
consideration each of the requirements set forth in 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv), which apply to
the public interest prong of the fee waiver analysis.
First, the BOP had to consider whether the subject of the requested records “concern[ed]
. . . identifiable operations and activities of the federal government, with a connection that is
direct and clear, not remote and attenuated.” See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(i). This threshold
requirement is normally easily met in that most records maintained by Federal agencies pertain in
some way to the operations or activities of the Federal government. In this case, the Plaintiff has
made a request for documents specifically pertaining to the use and maintenance and accuracy of
the ion spectrometer scanning method. See Ex. 2. There is little doubt that the documents
Plaintiff seeks concern, at least in part, the operations or activities of the government, as BOP has
acknowledged. See, e.g., Ex. 7 (June 29, 2006 letter from OIP to Mr. Linn) at 1-2 (noting that
“[a]lthough the records you seek concern, in part, the operations or activities of BOP . . .”).

22

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 25 of 50

However, merely meeting the threshold requirement under the public interest prong of the fee
waiver analysis is insufficient to justify a blanket fee waiver. See, e.g., Judicial Watch, Inc. v.
U.S. Dept. of Justice, 185 F.Supp.2d 54, 62 (D.D.C. 2002) (finding that the requester in that case
failed to show compliance with three of the four factors, and as such that it was not entitled to a
public interest fee waiver); Judicial Watch, 2000 W.L. 33724693, *5 (D.D.C. 2000) (same).
The regulations required BOP to proceed to consider the remaining three regulatory
factors which relate to the public interest requirement. As OIP concluded, in its June 29, 2006
letter, Plaintiff has “not satisfied [these] other factors, “most significantly factors two, three, and
four of the . . . public interest requirement.” See Ex. 7 at 1-2.

2.

Plaintiff has Not Satisfied the Second Factor as it has Not Shown that
Disclosure of the Technical Material it Seeks Will Be “Meaningfully”
Informative and Will Contribute to Increased Public Understanding

The second factor that BOP had to consider in ascertaining the public interest involved
with the disclosure of the information sought by Plaintiff was “[w]hether the disclosure” was in
fact “‘likely to contribute’ to an understanding of government operations or activities” inasmuch
as “[t]he disclosable portions of the requested records” would be “meaningfully informative
about government operations or activities in order to be ‘likely to contribute’ to an increased
public understanding of those operations or activities.” See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(ii). As OIP
noted in both its June 29, 2006 and November 8, 2006 letters to Mr. Linn, and as is discussed in
greater detail below in connection with the third factor, there were numerous reasons to doubt
that Plaintiff had the ability or intention to disseminate the information it had sought to the
general public. See Ex. 7 at 2; see also Ex. 9. Moreover, the OIP noted that “the large volume of
23

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 26 of 50

information” Plaintiff sought was “technical,” and it found “no evidence, of FedCure’s intention
to extract, analyze, synthesize, and effectively convey the information received to the public.”
See Ex. 7 at 2. Thus, OIP was of the view that (1) Plaintiff would only be able to share the
information it sought with a small pool of people, and (2) in view of the technical nature of this
information and Plaintiff’s intention to present it in undigested form, that only a small subset of
these individuals would understand the data being shared. As such, these findings gave the OIP a
sound basis for concluding that disclosure was not “‘likely to contribute’ to an understanding of
government operations or activities” inasmuch as “[t]he disclosable portions of the requested
records” would not be “meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in
order to be ‘likely to contribute’ to an increased public understanding of those operations or
activities.” See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).
3.

Plaintiff has Not Satisfied the Third Factor as it has Not Shown that
Disclosure to It Will Result in Information Being Effectively
Conveyed to, and Informing, a “Reasonably Broad” Audience

The third factor that DOJ’s regulations indicate is to be considered in connection with the
public interest inquiry is whether disclosure will contribute to the understanding of the public at
large, and not just a narrow segment of interested persons. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(iii)
(explaining that “[t]he disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad
audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the
requester” and that “[a] requester’s expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to
effectively convey information to the public shall be considered.”) (emphasis added); see also

Specifically, the requester must state how and to whom it intends to disseminate the
information it has requested, and the requester must demonstrate that he or she (or it) has the
ability and intention to effectively disseminate the information to the public. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R.
§ 16.11(k)(2)(iii); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see also
Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 185 F. Supp. at 62; Larson v. CIA, 843 F.2d 1481, 1483
& n. 5 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (finding “an inability to disseminate . . . information to the public” is
“alone . . . a sufficient basis for denying the fee waiver request”); Trupei v. Drug Enforcement
Admin., 2005 W.L. 3276290, *3 (D.D.C. 2005) (denying a fee waiver in part on the basis that
“Plaintiff did not state his intention to disseminate the information to the public or describe the
manner and means of dissemination”); Linn v. DOJ, 1997 W.L. 577586, *6 (D.D.C. 1997)
(observing that “[i]n addition to establishing that disseminating the requested information will
contribute to ‘public’ understanding[,] . . . Plaintiff must also establish that he has the ability to
disseminate the information to the public’).
The evidence provided by the Plaintiff to demonstrate its ability to disseminate the
materials requested to a reasonable segment of the general public is weak. Plaintiff has merely
claimed (1) that “it publish[es] a newsletter that is received by members of the public”; (2) that it
“maintain[s] a website with regular daily news updates”; (3) that its website “provides timely
news for the public”; (4) that its website has “been up for about two years” and “has already had
over 250,000 hits”; and (5) that “[i]ts chat site at Yahoo Groups has as many as 100 requests for
information each day.” see Ex. 4; Ex. 6; Ex. 8. In fact, an investigation by the OIP of Plaintiff’s
claims has revealed that Plaintiff’s “newsletter”: (1) only exists on its website; (2) is not
25

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Page 28 of 50

published with any regularity; and (3) is only available to those who visit its website. See Ex. 7;
Ex. 9. Specifically, as OIP explained in its June 29, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn:
The record . . . merely indicates that any information you receive will be available
to subscribers or visitors of FedCure’s website in a newsletter which, according to
FedCure, is only posted on its Web site. Importantly, upon viewing FedCure’s
Web site, it appears that the release of your newsletter is infrequent and irregular,
with gaps as long as two years between some issuances. Likewise, requests such
as yours that make no showing of how the information would be disseminated
other than by passively making it available to anyone who might seek access to it
on the Internet do not meet the burden for fee waiver purposes of demonstrating
with particularity that the information will be communicated to the public.

See Ex. 7 at 2. In its November 8, 2006 letter, OIP reiterated that “[t]he record before me
indicates that any information” Plaintiff receives “will be available to subscribers or visitors of
FedCure’s Web site in a newsletter, which according to FedCure, is only posted on its Website.”
See Ex. 9 at 1. Moreover, OIP noted in that letter that “FedCure . . . does not provide the public
with any printed material, and instead relies solely on passively making information available to
anyone who might seek access to the Internet.” See Ex. 9 at 1. In addition, OIP observed in that
letter that “a review of FedCure’s Web site, shows that the release of [its] newsletter is infrequent
and irregular with gaps as long as two years between some issuances” and that “[t]here is no
indication of the size of readership or number of subscribers to this newsletter.” See Ex. 9 at 1.
A perusal of FedCure’s website confirms the truth of OIP’s statement that “release of [the
organization’s] newsletter is infrequent and irregular, with gaps as long as two years between
some issuances.” See, e.g., http://www.fedcure.org/newsletter.shtml (page of FedCure’s website,
listing newsletter issuances, and revealing that no newsletter was released between June 2003
and the summer of 2005, that no newsletter was released between March 2006 and October 2006,

26

Page 29 of 50

and that no newsletter was issued between December 2006 and June 2007).
OIP also noted in its June 29, 2006 letter that while “FedCure’s request seeks a lot of
information, much of it technical . . . that would need to be collected from the seventy-one BOP
facilities that use the equipment,” there is “no evidence however, of FedCure’s intention to
extract, analyze, synthesize, and effectively convey the information received by the public.” See
Ex. 7 at 2. As OIP found, “[m]erely posting the required technical information on your website,
as you seem to suggest, without analysis is insufficient to meet the public interest requirement.”
Id. at 2. Courts have recognized that “[s]imply maintaining a website is not disseminating
information to a broad audience of interested individuals.” See, e.g., Brown v. U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, 445 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1360 (M.D. Fla. 2006), aff’d in 2007 W.L.446601 (11th
Cir. 2007) (unpublished).
Moreover, the evidence provided by the Plaintiff to demonstrate its ability to disseminate
the materials requested to a reasonable segment of the general public pales in comparison to the
means of communication illustrated in other cases decided within this Circuit. In Judicial Watch,
185 F. Supp. 54 (2002), for example, plans to disseminate information through faxes, press
releases, website, and radio and television appearances were found to satisfy the third factor of
the public interest prong of fee waiver test. See Judicial Watch, 185 F.Supp.2d at 62. In Judicial
Watch v. Rossotti, to take another example, the D.C. Circuit found the showing of the third
factor to be sufficient where the requestor described, in detail, nine methods used to disseminate
FOIA records to the public. See Rossotti, 326 F.3d at 1314. Among those nine methods, which
were explained in detailed and non-conclusory terms, included a newsletter with a monthly
circulation of over 300,000 copies nationwide; a website that has “logged up to 1,000,000
27

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

visitors in a single day; an Internet list serve with 60,000 subscribers who receive daily updates
on [Judicial Watch] lawsuits, congressional testimony, a nationally syndicated news and
information television show; a weekly radio-program which “airs nationwide on thirty-six radio
stations and the Internet.” Id. In Electronic Privacy Information Center v. Dep’t of Defense, 241
F.Supp.2d 5, 13 (D.D.C. 2003), to take a third example, an organization that produced a biweekly electronic newsletter with 15,000 subscribers for eight consecutive years was found to
qualify as an entity “disseminating news.” Plaintiff has not come close to making any of these
showings on the dissemination front.
Plaintiff’s showing on the dissemination issue also pales in comparison to that presented
in another case, upon which it relies, Prison Legal News v. Lappin, 436 F. Supp. 2d 17 (D.D.C.
2006) (“Prison Legal News”). Although Plaintiff argued during the pendency of its
administrative appeal that Prison Legal News supports its position, particularly with regard to the
dissemination issue, quite the opposite is true. See Ex. 8 (July 10, 2006 letter from Mr. Linn to
OIP). In fact, as OIP noted in its November 8, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn, the Prison Legal News
case is distinguishable and the case does not support Plaintiff’s position. See Ex. 9. As OIP
explained, “[w]hile the Court in Prison Legal News did suggest that a Web site could be a viable
distribution channel, it was not the basis of its finding that the plaintiff in that case (PLN) had the
intent and ability to disseminate the requested records.” See Ex. 9 at 1. As OIP further
explained, the Court in Prison Legal News “specifically stated that its finding was made
‘regardless of the viability of the PLN website as a mechanism for distributing the requested
information.’” See Ex. 9 at 1. This is certainly true. See Prison Legal News, 436 F. Supp. 2d at
26.)
28

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Page 31 of 50

Moreover, as the OIP noted, the Prison Legal News court found that the requester there,
in marked contrast with Plaintiff here, had “demonstrated an ability to disseminate information
by electronic means, specifically its distribution of a printed journal to the public, with a
readership population of approximately 18,000” and that in addition PLN “was able to
demonstrate that it has published a monthly newsletter since 1990, and was able to provide an
estimated number of subscribers and size of readership.” See Ex. 9 at 1; see also Prison Legal
News, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 19; id. at 26-27. As OIP found, this gave the court in Prison Legal
News a basis for determining that PLN had “a represented readership of ‘thousands each month’
and could “‘widely disseminate’ the requested information to the “‘relevant public.’” See Ex. 9
at 2; Prison Legal News, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 19, 26-27. Plaintiff, by contrast, does not provide
the public with any printed material, relies solely on passively making information available to
anyone who might seek access to it online on its website and its Yahoo chat room, publishes its
newsletter only on its website and on an infrequent basis, has provided no estimate of the size of
its readership or the number of subscribers to its newsletter. See Ex. 6; Ex. 7; Ex. 8; Ex. 9.
With specific regard to Plaintiff’s claim that its “chat site at Yahoo Groups has as many
as 100 requests for information each day,” see Ex. 6; Ex. 8; Compl. ¶ 9, OIP noted that it is
“aware of no authority to the effect that an Internet ‘chat room’ is a sufficient demonstration of
an ability to communicate to the public, nor that it is consistent with common practice.” See Ex.
9 at 2. Moreover, as OIP observed, “FedCure’s chat rooms are distinct from the PLN newsletters
that were affirmatively distributed to a defined membership.” Id. at 2. Moreover, it should also
be noted that whereas PLN’s “printed journal” was found to have “a readership population of
approximately 18,000,” see Prison Legal News, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 19, 26-27, a visit to

FedCure’s yahoo discussion group on September 16, 2007 revealed that as of that date, it only
had 1,660 members, with no indication provided of how regularly those members participated in
that forum. See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FedCure-org/. Between January and September
2007, the number of messages in that forum ranged from 218 and 677, suggesting that a small
percentage of the 1,660 members regularly participate in the forum or read postings there. Id.
Nor does the case of Linn v. DOJ, 1997 W.L. 577586 (D.D.C. 1997) (“Linn”), which
Plaintiff cited in its reconsideration request, help Plaintiff’s cause. See Ex. 8. As the OIP noted,
the requester in that case specified particular lobbying organizations that would disseminate the
information it received and indicated that “[t]heir member mailings number in the thousands
each month and they have both an interest and the ability to further disseminate the information.”
See Linn ,1997 W.L. 577586 at *6; Ex. 9 at 2. Moreover, the defendant in Linn did “not
challenge Plaintiff's claimed ability to disseminate the requested information,” whereas
Defendant in this case does. See Linn ,1997 W.L. 577586 at *6; Ex. 9 at 2. As OIP noted,
“[a]nswering questions as provided by anyone who might seek access to the site on Yahoo does
not demonstrate a comparable ability to transmit the requested information to the public.” See
Ex. 9 at 2.
Nor has Plaintiff explained its track record of conveying to the public information
obtained through FOIA requests. See Judicial Watch, Inc., 185 F. Supp. 2d 62 (referring to the
plaintiff’s past dissemination of information derived from FOIA requests as one factor leading to
the conclusion that plaintiff had fulfilled the third prong of the regulation’s public interest test.).
Collectively, based on the records available for review, FedCure has failed to demonstrate
that it has the “ability and intention to effectively convey” or disseminate the requested
30

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

information to a “reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject,” as opposed to
the individual understanding of the requester. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(iii); Judicial Watch,
185 F. Supp. 2d at 62 (emphasis added).
4.

Plaintiff has Not Satisfied the Fourth Factor as It has Not Shown that
Disclosure Will Significantly Increase Public Understanding

The fourth factor that the regulations required BOP to consider in resolving the public
interest prong of the fee waiver analysis was whether the disclosure of the information sought
was “likely to contribute ‘significantly’ to the public’s understanding of the government’s
operations or activities” and whether “[t]he public’s understanding of the subject in question, as
compared to the level of the public understanding existing prior to the disclosure” would be
“enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.” See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(iv). As has
been explained, there are many reasons to doubt that Plaintiff had the ability to disseminate the
information it had sought to the general public. See Ex. 7 at 2; see also Ex. 9. Moreover, the
OIP noted that “the large volume of information” Plaintiff sought was “technical,” and it found
“no evidence, of FedCure’s intention to extract, analyze, synthesize, and effectively convey the
information received to the public.” See Ex. 7 at 2. These findings suggested that Plaintiff
would only be able to share the information it sought with a small pool of people, and, in view of
the technical nature of this information and Plaintiff’s intention to present it in undigested form,
that only a small subset of these individuals would understand the data being shared. As such,
these findings gave the OIP (and give this Court) a sound basis for concluding that disclosure
was not likely to contribute ‘significantly’ to the public’s understanding of the government’s
operations or activities” and that “[t]he public’s understanding of the subject in question, as

31

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 34 of 50

compared to the level of the public understanding existing prior to the disclosure” would not be
“enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.” See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(2)(iv) (emphasis
added)
III.

FedCure has Not Established that it is a Member of the News Media or
NonScientific Commercial Institution
Plaintiff has argued that “[w]e are considered a ‘noncommercial scientific institution’

since we are involved in the social sciences, keep an extensive library, can be called a ‘think
tank’, and devote time and resources to research and dissemination of information on matters of
public interest.” See Ex. 4 at 1. Plaintiff has also claimed that “[w]e are representatives of the
news media through our regular newsletters.” See Ex. 4 at 1; see also Ex. 6 at 1 (claiming that
both of these propositions “should be obvious.”) Placement in either category would entitle
FedCure to favorable fee treatment by limiting fees to duplication costs only. See 5 U.S.C.
§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II); 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.11(a), (b)(5), (b)(6), (c)(1)(i), (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(1).
Because the statutory standard speaks to the use to which the requester will put the information
released to it, it is essential to any fee category analysis that the agency be provided sufficient
information about the requester’s intended use for the records in order for the agency to make a
proper fee category determination. See Nat’l Sec. Archive v. DOD, 880 F.2d 1381, 1382 (D.C.
Cir. 1989); Ex. 7.
The regulation defines a “[r]epresentative of the news media” as “any person actively
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the
public.” See 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(b)(6) (emphasis added). The regulations define a
“[n]oncommercial scientific institution” as one that is “operated solely for the purpose of

32

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 35 of 50

conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular
product or industry.” Id. at § 16.11(b)(5) (emphasis added). To date, Plaintiff has provided no
information that suggest that it should be placed in either of these categories.
The fact that Plaintiff maintains a website and a yahoo discussion group does not, by
itself, entitle it to claim status as a member of the news media. See, e.g., Electronic Privacy
Information Center v. Dep’t of Defense, 241 F.Supp.2d 5, 14, n. 7 (D.D.C. 2003) (noting that
“the Court is not convinced that a website is, by itself, sufficient to qualify a FOIA requester as a
‘representative of the news media’ entitled to preferred fee status” and that “[v]irtually every
entity in the Washington area-businesses, law firms, trade associations, etc.-as well as many
individuals, has a website, but certainly all are not entitled to news media status for fee
determinations”); see also Brown v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 2007 W.L. 446601,**2
(11th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (finding that the requester “[B]rown's status as the publisher of a
website does not make him a representative of the news media,” and that “Brown’s statements
regarding the purpose of his website and the traffic and notice it has received do not establish that
he broadcasts or disseminates news to the public at large”); Brown, 445 F. Supp. 2d at 1357- 58
& n. 10 (rejecting the proposition that “simply maintaining a website makes a FOIA requester a
‘representative of the news media.,’” and agreeing with the D.C. Circuit’s ruling in Electronic
Privacy Information Center that “the presence of a website alone does not qualify a FOIA
requester as a representative of the news media”).
Indeed, there is no indication on Plaintiff’s website that FedCure is “organized and
operated to publish or broadcast news to the public” or, for that matter, that it is “operated solely
for the purpose of conducting scientific research,” as the regulations require. See 28 C.F.R.
33

Page 36 of 50

§§ 16.11(b)(5), (b)(6). Rather, nearly every page of Plaintiff’s own website suggests that it is
primarily an advocacy organization, not a news organization or a center of scientific research.
See, e.g., http://www.fedcure.org/ (home pages of FedCure, declaring that “FedCURE is the
world’s leading advocate for America's, ever growing, federal inmate population,” referring to
“our efforts to reform the federal criminal justice system in the United States,” and that “[w]e are
working to reinstate parole; increase good time allowances; provide for compassionate releases;
restore PELL grants; and opportunities for successful reentry into the community, for all federal
offenders; and promote a system that incarcerates fewer people and provides humane conditions
for those who are incarcerated or under post-incarceration supervision via parole or supervised
release”) (emphasis added); see also http://www.fedcure.org/aboutus.shtml (group’s “[m]ission
[s]tatement” stating that “[a]dvocacy on behalf of the federal inmate population is the central
focus of Federal CURE, Inc. . .”)
In addition, there is nothing on FedCure’s website that indicates that the information it
posts is “news” as defined by 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(b)(6) (defining news as “information that is
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public,” and indicating that
“[e]xamples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public
at large and publishers of periodicals . . . but only in those instances where they can qualify as
disseminators of ‘news’ . . . who make their products available for purchase or subscription by
the general public.”). See http://www.fedcure.org/ generally; see also Ex. 7 (making this point).
While Mr. Linn’s claims that FedCure maintains “a website with regular daily news
updates” that “provides timely news to the public,” see Ex. 4, Ex. 6, these claims are belied by
FedCure’s own Web site. As has been stated previously, a review of FedCure’s website reveals
34

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 37 of 50

that the release and update of the newsletters are infrequent and irregular. See, e.g.,
http://www.fedcure.org/newsletter.shtml (page of FedCure’s website, listing newsletter
issuances); Ex. 7 at 3; Ex. 9. As the OIP noted in its June 29, 2006 letter, as of the date of that
letter, “there ha[d] been a total of only six [newsletters] since Winter 2003.” See Ex. 7 at 3.
This is true today. See http://www.fedcure.org/newsletter.shtml. The irregularity of its news
postings is one more reason that FedCure does not qualify for special fee treatment as a member
of the news media. See, e.g., Electronic Privacy Information Center, 241 F.Supp.2d at 14, n. 6
(observing that “[o]f course, not every organization with its own newsletter will necessarily
qualify for news media status . . . ” and that “[a]t a minimum, newsletters must be published
regularly, over a period of time, and must disseminate actual “news” to the public, rather than
solely self-promoting articles about that organization”) (emphasis added).
In addition, as the OIP noted, “at least four of the six newsletters posted contain
significant overlap of information with other newsletters.” See Ex. 7 at3 (noting specifically that
“the several paragraphs that comprise FedCure’s Summer 2005 newsletter are repeated virtually
verbatim in three subsequent newsletters, with minimal differences in overall content”).
Moreover, as OIP also noted, “at least two of FedCure’s six newsletters contain disclaimers that
advise the reader that ‘the content herein is presented for informational purposes only.’” See Ex.
7 at 3-4. A visit to FedCure’s website confirms that this is true. See, e.g.,
http://www.fedcure.org/April2003Newsletter.pdf at 30 (Winter 2003 newsletter, containing the
language cited by the OIP and also advising readers that “www.fedcure.org does not attest to
accuracy thereof”); http://www.fedcure.org/June2003Newsletter.pdf at 15 (June 2003 newsletter,
containing identical disclaimer language).
35

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Page 38 of 50

In its request for a fee waiver and appeal, Plaintiff argued that it “intend[ed] to publish the
response [it received from BOP to its FOIA request] in [its] newsetter and on [its] website.” See
Ex. 4 (April 20, 2005 letter from Mr. Linn to BOP) at 1. As the OIP noted “the large volume of
information” Plaintiff sought was “technical,” and it found “no evidence, of FedCure’s intention
to extract, analyze, synthesize, and effectively convey the information received to the public.”
See Ex. 7 at 2. However, the D.C. Circuit has ruled that a requestor who seeks information
simply in order to make it “available” in raw undigested form, without in any way manipulating,
extracting, analyzing, synthesizing, or exercising editorial control over it, does not qualify for
favored fee category treatment as a member of the news media under the FOIA. See Nat’l Sec.
Archive v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381 1386 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (noting that activities
that amount to a way “of making information available to the public . . .are insufficient to
establish an entitlement to preferred [fee] status”); id. at 1387 (explaining that “[a] representative
of the news media is, in essence, a person or entity that gathers information of potential interest
to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work,
and distributes that work to an audience”); see also Ex. 7. Thus, there are numerous reasons that
this Court should find that Plaintiff is neither a noncommercial scientific institution or a member
of the news media for FOIA fee purposes.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully submits that summary judgment should
be granted to it in this matter.

Civil Action No. 07–00843 (RBW)

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS NOT IN DISPUTE
Pursuant to Local Rule 7(h), Defendants submit this statement of material facts as to
which there is no genuine issue:
1. By letter to BOP’s FOIA/PA unit dated February 25, 2005, Kenneth Linn, the
Chairman of FedCure, submitted a request for information under the FOIA and Privacy Act on
behalf of his organization. See Exhibit (“Ex.”) 1, Declaration of Wilson J. Moorer (“Moorer
Decl.”) ¶ 3, Ex. A to Moorer Decl.; Ex. 2 (February 25, 2005 Letter from Kenneth Linn of
FedCure to the BOP); see also Docket Entry No. 1, Verified Complaint for Declaratory and
Injunctive Relief to Obtain Freedom of Information Act Information (“Compl.”) ¶ 10. Mr.
Linn’s FOIA/Privacy Act request was for the following:
1) all information about the accuracy of the ion spectrometer scanning method and
the number of visitors turned away at all BOP facilities (by facility) because of the
results of the scanning method since institution of its use, 2) all information
relating to the training methods used for personnel operating this equipment and
staff comments as to these methods and 3) all records of equipment failure and
repairs.

See Ex. 2 (February 25, 2005 Letter from Kenneth Linn of FedCure to the BOP); see also Ex. 1,
Moorer Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A; Compl. ¶ 11. In this initial request, Mr. Linn did not request a fee
waiver. See Ex. 2 (February 25, 2005 Letter from Kenneth Linn of FedCure to the BOP); see
also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl., Ex. A.
2. In a letter dated April 4, 2005, BOP’s FOIA/PA office responded to Mr. Linn’s FOIA
request. See Ex. 3 (April 4, 2005 Letter from BOP to Plaintiff); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl.
¶¶ 4-5, Ex. B to Moorer Decl.. In that letter, BOP’s FOIA/PA office informed Mr. Linn that:
After a careful review of your request, it has been determined it will take an
estimated 142 hours of search time to locate the above requested information.
[i.e., the material which Plaintiff had requested.] In accordance with 28 C.F.R.
§ 16.11(c)(1)(ii), the cost for staff time involved in the search of this information
is assessed at $7.00 per quarter hour for professional time.
Therefore, you are being charged $7.00 per quarter hour for an estimated 142
hours for a cost of $3,976.00. This amount does not include a duplication fee of
.10 cents per page of information reproduced as a result of the search.
See Id. (emphasis in original); see also Compl. ¶ 12.
3. The April 2005 letter further explained that:
In accordance with 28 C.F.R. § 16.11(i)(2), we can require advance payment of
fees in excess of $250.00. Therefore, should you require this office to proceed
with your request, please submit a check or money order, payable to the Treasury
of the United States, in the amount of $3,976.00 within 30 days to this office at
the above address so that we may begin retrieval and review of these records.
See Ex. 3 (April 4, 2005 Letter from BOP to Plaintiff) (emphasis in original); see also Ex. 1,
Moorer Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. B to Moorer Decl..
4. In a letter dated April 20, 2005, Mr. Linn requested that the BOP waive the $3,976.00
fee which BOP had indicated would be charged for the search time required to respond to his
FOIA request as well as a waiver of any copy fees. Id.; Compl. ¶ 13.

5. Mr. Linn asserted in his April 20, 2005 letter that “FedCure is a non-profit
organization with less than $5,000.00 in yearly donations” and claimed that “[w]e publish a
newsletter that is received by members of the public as well as maintain a website with regular
daily news updates.” Id. He also argued in the letter that Fedcure qualified for a fee waiver
because: (1) “[w]e are considered a ‘noncommercial scientific institution’ since we are involved
in the social sciences, keep an extensive library, can be called a ‘think tank,’ and devote time and
resources to research and dissemination of information on matters of public interest”; (2) “[w]e
are a representative of the news media through our regular newsletters”; and (3) “[t]he
information sought is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations of the government and is certainly not in the commercial interest
of the requestor.” Id.
6. Mr. Linn further represented in his April 20, 2005 letter that FedCure had “received
numerous requests from the public for the information requested,” that it “intend[ed] to publish
the response in [its] newsletter and on [its] website,” that the “information had value to the
public-particularly those who regularly visit incarcerated federal inmates,” and that FedCure was
“the world’s leading expert in matters relating to federal inmates.” See Ex. 4 (April 20, 2005
letter from Mr. Linn to BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also Ex. 1, Ex. C to Moorer Decl.
7. In a letter dated September 26, 2005, the BOP’s FOIA/PA Office responded to Mr.
Linn’s request for a fee waiver. See Ex. 5 (September 26, 2005 letter from BOP’s FOIA/PA
office to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶¶ 6-8, Ex. D to Moorer Decl.. It that letter,
BOP’s FOIA/PA office noted that “[t]he statutory test for evaluating fee waiver requests is
whether release of the information ‘is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
3

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 43 of 50

significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,’ in which event a fee waiver or reduction is
required by law.” Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. §552 (a)(4)(A)(iii)). It also noted that the “six factors used
in the determination as to whether a sufficient contribution to the public understanding of
government operations or activities would result from disclosure, so as to warrant the granting of
a fee waiver” are as follows:
1) whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or
activities of the government”; 2) whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to
an understanding of government operations or activities; 3) whether disclosure of
the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the general
public at large; 4) whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to
public understanding of government operations and activities; 5) whether the
requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested
disclosure; and 6) whether any such commercial interest outweighs the public
interest in disclosure.
Id. BOP’s FOIA/PA office advised Mr. Linn that “[o]n the basis of all the information you
provided” as well as an analysis of the above mentioned six factors, “we have concluded that
your request for a waiver of fees is denied.” Id.; Compl. ¶ 14. It noted that, in reaching this
conclusion, it had analyzed the definitions of a “noncommercial scientific institution” and a
“representative of the news media,” set forth in 5 U.S.C. §552(a), and had determined that
FedCure did not satisfy either of these definitions. See Ex. 5, September 26, 2005 letter from
BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. D to Moorer Decl..
8. The September 26, 2005 letter repeated the fee information which had been set forth in
the April 4, 2005 letter, and advised Mr. Linn that he could either: (1) agree to pay the fee, in
which case his FOIA request would be processed; or (2) file a written appeal of the denial of his
request for a fee waiver with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)’s Office of Information and

Privacy (“OIP”). See Ex. 5, September 26, 2005 letter from BOP’s FOIA/PA office); see also
Ex. D to Moorer Decl..
9. By letter dated November 1, 2005, and received on November 9, 2005, Mr. Linn
appealed the BOP FOIA/PA’s fee waiver denial to the OIP. See Ex. 6 (Mr. Linn’s November 1,
2005 letter to the OIP); see also Compl. ¶ 15; Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. E to Moorer Decl.. In
his appeal letter, Mr. Linn argued that FedCURE met the definition of a “representative of the
news media” and a “noncommercial scientific think tank,” and that the information it sought was
in the public interest. See Ex. 6 (Mr. Linn’s November 1, 2005 letter to the OIP). In an attempt
to support these legal contentions, Mr. Linn made the following assertions in his November 2005
letter: (1) “FedCure is the largest private organization dealing with federal inmate issues”;
(2) FedCure’s “website, which provides timely news for the public has been up for about two
years and has already had over 250,000 hits”; (3) “[i]ts chat site at Yahoo groups has as many as
100 requests for information each day”; (4) “FedCure is a 501(c)(3) non-profit” whose “directors
and staff serve with no pay”; (5) “[t]he primary function of FedCure is to provide information to
the public about the workings of the Bureau of Prisons”; (6) “FedCure has received hundreds of
questions and complaints about the workings of the Bureau of Prisons” and “[i]n particular,
FedCure has received hundreds of questions and complaints about ion spectrometer procedures
and the reasoning behind their use”; (7) “[t]he general public is interested in the use of these
machines” and “disclosure would ‘significantly’ answer the public’s questions”; and (8)
“FedCure has no commercial interest whatsoever in the disclosure.” See Ex. 6 (Mr. Linn’s
November 1, 2005 letter to the OIP); see also Compl. ¶ 15; Ex. E to Moorer Decl..
10. In a letter dated June 29, 2006, OIP informed Mr. Linn that it had concluded that
5

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 45 of 50

BOP had properly denied FedCure’s request for a waiver of fees. See Ex. 7 (OIP’s June 29, 2006
letter to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. F to Moorer Decl.; Compl. ¶ 16. OIP
described the statutory standard for evaluating fee waiver requests, set forth in 4 U.S.C.
§§ 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). See Ex. 7 (OIP’s June 29, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. F to
Moorer Decl.. OIP indicated that in determining whether FedCure had satisfied this statutory
standard, it had considered the six factor test set out in the implementing DOJ’s regulation at 28
C.F.R. § 16.11(k), and noted that “[t]he first four of these factors concern the ‘public interest’
requirement; the fifth and sixth concern whether your interest in the records is primarily
commercial.” Id.
11. In the June 29, 2006 letter, OIP explained that “[a]lthough the records you seek
concern, in part, the operations of BOP, and you do not appear to have an overriding commercial
interest in the records, you have not satisfied other factors, most significantly factors two, three,
and four of the statutory public interest requirement.” Id.; Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 9. Specifically,
OIP noted that Mr. Linn had not adequately addressed the public interest requirement imposed by
the FOIA, but instead had merely paraphrased the statutory standard. See Ex. 7 (OIP’s June 29,
2006 letter to Mr. Linn); Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. F to Moorer Decl..
12. In the June 29, 2006 letter, OIP further indicated that Mr. Linn had failed to
adequately demonstrate that FedCURE is able to disseminate information to the public, noting
that FedCure’s “newsletter” was only available on its website and was released on an infrequent
and irregular basis, with gaps as long as two years between some issuances. See Ex. 7 (OIP’s
June 29, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn) at 2. Moreover, OIP noted that the public interest requirement
had also not been satisfied inasmuch as there was no evidence that FedCURE intended to
6

Case 1:07-cv-00843-RBW

Document 8

Filed 09/18/2007

Page 46 of 50

“extract, analyze, synthesize, and effectively convey” the highly technical information Mr. Linn
had requested for the benefit of the public. Id at 2. In addition, OIP explained that, for a variety
of reasons, FedCure had failed to demonstrate that it was either a “representative of the news
media” or a “noncommercial scientific institution.” See id. at 3-4. Accordingly, OIP denied
FedCure’s appeal. Id.
13. Mr. Linn submitted a “Reconsideration of Appeal Denial” to OIP dated July 10,
2006. See Ex. 8 (Mr. Linn’s July 10, 2006 letter to OIP); see also Ex. 1, Moorer Decl. ¶ 10; Ex.
G to Moorer Decl.. In his reconsideration letter, Mr. Linn requested that the OIP reconsider its
decision, based on a recent U.S. District Court for District of Columbia opinion regarding the
granting of a fee waiver to a requester who had submitted a request to the BOP: Prison Legal
News v. Harley G. Lappin, Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Civil Action No. 05-1812, 2006
W.L. 1737483 (D.D.C. June 26, 2006). Id.
14. On November 8, 2006, OIP responded to Plaintiff’s request for “Reconsideration of
Appeal Denial.” See Ex. 9 (OIP’s November 8, 2006 letter to Mr. Linn); see also Ex. 1, Moorer
Decl. ¶ 11; Ex. H to Moorer Decl.. In that letter, OIP informed Mr. Linn that it had determined
that its decision of June 29, 2006 was appropriate, and set forth several reasons why the decision
which Mr. Linn had cited in his July 10, 2006 request for reconsideration was distinguishable and
did not support Mr. Linn’s request for a fee waiver. Id.
15. FedCure’s newsletter is only posted on its Website. See Ex. 7 at 2; Ex. 9 at 1.
FedCure does not regularly circulate a printed copy of its newsletter. See Ex. 7 at 2; Ex. 9 at 1.
There is no indication in the record of the size of readership or number of subscribers to
FedCure’s online newsletter. See Ex. 9 at 1.

16. The release of FedCure’s online newsletter is infrequent and irregular, with gaps as
long as two years between some issuances. See Ex. 7 at 2-3; Ex. 9 at 1; see also
http://www.fedcure.org/newsletter.shtml (page of FedCure’s website, listing newsletter
issuances, and revealing that no newsletter was released between June 2003 and the summer of
2005, that no newsletter was released between March 2006 and October 2006, and that no
newsletter was issued between December 2006 and June 2007). There have been a total of about
six online newsletters posted on FedCure’s website since the Winter of 2003. See Ex. 7 at 2.
17. At least four of the online newsletters FedCure has posted on its website contain
information which significantly overlaps with information found in other online newsletters. See
Ex. 7 at 3 (noting specifically that “the several paragraphs that comprise FedCure’s Summer
2005 newsletter are repeated are repeated virtually verbatim in three subsequent newsletters, with
minimal differences in overall content”).
18. At least two of FedCure’s online newsletters contain disclaimers that advise the
reader that “the content herein is presented for informational purposes only.” See Ex. 7 at 3-4;
see also http://www.fedcure.org/April2003Newsletter.pdf at 30 (Winter 2003 newsletter,
containing the language cited by the OIP and also advising readers that “www.fedcure.org does
not attest to accuracy thereof”); http://www.fedcure.org/June2003Newsletter.pdf at 15 (June
2003 newsletter, containing identical disclaimer language).
19. As of September 16, 2007, FedCure’s chat site at Yahoo groups had only 1,660
members. See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FedCure-org/. Between January and September
2007, the number of messages in that forum ranged from 218 and 677. Id.
20. Plaintiff’s own website suggests that it is primarily an advocacy organization, not a

news organization or a center of scientific research. See, e.g., http://www.fedcure.org/ (home
pages of FedCure, declaring that “FedCURE is the world’s leading advocate for America’s, ever
growing, federal inmate population,” referring to “our efforts to reform the federal criminal
justice system in the United States,” and that “[w]e are working to reinstate parole; increase good
time allowances; provide for compassionate releases; restore PELL grants; and opportunities for
successful reentry into the community, for all federal offenders; and promote a system that
incarcerates fewer people and provides humane conditions for those who are incarcerated or
under post-incarceration supervision via parole or supervised release”) (emphasis added); see
also http://www.fedcure.org/aboutus.shtml (group’s “[m]ission [s]tatement” stating that
“[a]dvocacy on behalf of the federal inmate population is the central focus of Federal CURE, Inc.
