Case No. 3:17-CV-72
(Judge MOON)
RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
MOTION TO COMPEL INSPECTION
AND IMAGING OF ELECTRONIC
DEVICES

Defendants Robert Ray and Christopher Cantwell oppose the Plaintiffs motion to
compel inspection and imaging of their electronic devices (DE 354) for the reasons set forth
below.
I. Defendants cannot afford to pay for third party ESI vendors.
The plaintiffs have cited this Court to Ashmore v. Allied Energy, Inc. 2016 WL
301169. That document is a district court order denying an attempt to shift or avoid costs of
ESI discovery. Responding Defendants join in citing that ruling to this Court, specifically the
discussion located at p. 5. therein where the Court observed that certain basic factual support
for the parties attempt to demonstrate undue burden was missing and therefore the Court
could not grant the requested relief.
As stated in Ashmore, the basic factual support mandated for an FRCP 26 undue
burden analysis in an ESI context requires some showing of “cost/financial information” so
that the Court can properly “take into account financially weak litigants when issuing
discovery orders.” Id. at 5.

a. The Responding Defendants have provided sufficient factual support to demonstrate
undue burden based on lack of funds
Each responding defendant has filed a declaration attached to this pleading averring
that they cannot afford to pay for third party ESI imaging of their electronic devices. The
declarations include a basis for the expected cost of the imaging based on one responding
defendant having already gone through the process in separate litigation.
Therefore, this Court has sufficient information before it to conclude that none of the
responding can afford third party ESI and it is accordingly unduly burdensome for them to be
requested or ordered to do so.
II. The plaintiffs proposed stipulation is grossly prejudicial as it does impose any
reciprocal obligations on the party plaintiffs
The defendants objected, among other reasons, when plaintiffs initially proposed an
ESI order because the order is entirely one sided. That is, it imposed no obligation whatsoever
on the party plaintiffs to comply with the conditions they want defendants to agree to. As such
it would grossly unfair and inequitable for the Court the enter the proposed order without
amending it to impose reciprocal obligations upon all parties. Further, the plaintiffs have no
case for support of their request that the Court do so.
III. Conclusion
Defendants do not allege that the ESI at issue is not properly subject to discovery.
Rather, they object that they are financially unable to bear the cost of third party ESI.
Therefore, responding Defendants request the Court to 1) deny the pending motion to
compel; and 2) order the parties to again meet and confer to see if there is an agreeable way to
engage in the necessary electronic discovery without recourse to third party ESI vendors
