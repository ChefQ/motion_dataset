DEFENDANT SPENCERâ€™S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL
INSPECTION AND ELECTRONIC IMAGING OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES
I.

Introduction

Defendant Richard B. Spencer (Mr. Spencer) hereby opposes
Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Defendants to Permit Inspection and
Imaging of Electronic Devices.
II.

Facts

The First Amended Complaint identifies only four (4)
alleged electronic communications1 by Mr. Spencer.
The other allegations about electronic communications
contained in the First Amended Complaint do not identify Mr.
Spencer; they either identify other Defendant alone or merely
refer to the defendants collectively.
In addition, although the First Amended Complaint
identifies "Discord" as the principal electronic communications
1

They are text messages, instant messages or e-mails that are alleged at Pars. 52, 166, 194, and 260. Of those,
one was to a reporter on August 11 (Par. 52), two (2) were also on August 11 (Pars. 166 and 184) and one (1) was
on August 12 (Par. 260).

"platform" through which alleged co-conspirators exchanged
messages, it does not in any way, shape or form alleged that Mr.
Spencer used Discord as a medium of communication.2
Indeed, at the hearing before Judge Moon on May 24, 2018,
lead counsel for Plaintiffs conceded that Plaintiffs had not
found a single communication by Mr. Spencer on Discord.3
On April 18, 2018, Mr. Spencer served Plaintiffs' counsel
with his Objections and Responses to Plaintiffs' First Request
for Documents (hereinafter the "Response").4

The Response

consisted of 79 pages, of which 1 page was a cover page, 3 pages
were objections and 75 pages were responses.
Mr. Spencer produced, inter alia, some 37 pages of
electronic communications and 17 pages of "links" to other
electronic communications.
At no time have Plaintiffs filed any motion to compel based
on any alleged deficiency in Mr. Spencer's Response.
Instead, Plaintiffs have filed the instant Motion, arguing
that they believe Mr. Spencer possesses additional responsive
communications and that he did not produce the referenced
electronic communications in the format they requested.

The Response -- although not the responsive documents -- are attached to the Motion as Exhibit 18. (Document
ID Nos. 3274-3287). The actual document production is attached hereto as Exhibits 1 through 5.

III.
A.
1.

Argument

There is No Need for Imaging of Mr. Spencer's Devices.
Plaintiffs Do Not Allege Any Misconduct by Mr. Spencer.
a.

Mr. Spencer's Document Production Has Been Adequate.

Plaintiffs argue that imaging of Mr. Spencer's electronic
devices is warranted because "Defendants' document production
has been inadequate."5

Plaintiffs' basis for this assertion

against Mr. Spencer appears to be the contentions set forth in
Plaintiffs' Exhibit 18, a letter, dated May 10, 2018, from
Plaintiff's counsel to Mr. Spencer, in which letter Plaintiffs
state that they have various reasons to believe that Mr. Spencer
did not produce all responsive documents or things.
For example, Plaintiffs contend that: (1) although they
received from other Defendants copies of various documents that
are responsive to the request to Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer
himself did not produce his copies thereof;6 (2) Mr. Spencer's
Response identified things he was producing that were not, in
fact, produced;7 and (3) Plaintiffs themselves are aware of (and

5

Motion at p. 8 (Docket Page No. 3176).
Exhibit 18 at Docket Page Nos. 3311-3312. Nowhere do Plaintiffs specifically identify those documents and
nowhere do they explain their purported materiality and how their "absence" from Mr. Spencer's production
suggests that he is purposefully withholding responsive documents.
7
Exhibit 18 at Docket Page Nos. 3311-3312. Plaintiffs have not filed a motion to compel production of those
things.

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 3 of 14 Pageid#: 3342

presumably have in their possession) various other responsive
documents or things.8
Yet, Mr. Spencer's Response consists of 79 pages, of which
75 pages contain actual responses and copies of and/or links to
responsive documents.

Of those 75 pages, some 37 pages consist

of electronic communications and 17 pages consist of links to
other electronic communications.

The totality of Mr. Spencer's

response and production make manifest that he is acting in good
faith; and the fact that, as evidence of inadequacy, what
Plaintiffs point to are documents in the possession of other
parties or in the public realm evidences that Mr. Spencer is not
hiding things.

These circumstance suggest nothing more than the

normal "inefficiencies" in discovery.
If, as Plaintiffs suggest (but do not demonstrate), Mr.
Spencer has additional responsive documents (not previously
identified), the appropriate recourse is a motion to compel
production and entry of an appropriate order that would not
saddle Mr. Spencer with the sort of costs associated with
imaging.9

8

Exhibit 18 at Docket Page Nos. 3311-3312. If, as is indicated by Plaintiffs' references to the "missing" things,
Plaintiffs already possess them or have access to others because they are publicly available, one questions why
imaging is needed.
9
Plaintiffs do note that, in his Response, Mr. Spencer identified various documents or things as having been
produced, but that they were not, in fact, produced. Counsel will address this defect with Mr. Spencer and remedy
any defect.

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 4 of 14 Pageid#: 3343

b.

Mr. Spencer Has Not Threatened to Destroy Evidence.

Plaintiffs argue that imaging of Mr. Spencer's electronic
devices is warranted because "Defendants threatened to destroy
and withhold relevant evidence."10
Yet, although Plaintiffs recite threats by Defendant
Parrott to destroy evidence, they do not cite any alleged such
threats by Mr. Spencer.11
2.

That Plaintiffs Allege Electronic Communications
Among Defendants Is Not Sufficient to Warrant Requiring Mr. Spencer to Submit His Devices to Imaging.

Plaintiffs argue that "[i]maging of Defendants' electronic
devices is warranted because electronic communications among the
Defendant and their co-conspirator are a key factual component
of this litigation."12

In so arguing, Plaintiffs reference

Paragraphs 68 through 142 of their First Amended Complaint and
the fact that, although certain Defendants, used cell telephones
to communicate, they did not produce any text messages.13
Plaintiffs do make broad allegations that Defendants
communicated through electronic means in Paragraphs 68 through
142 of the Amended Complaint, but their allegations that Mr.
Spencer so communicated are extremely limited.

5

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 5 of 14 Pageid#: 3344

For example, in only a limited number of those paragraphs
do Plaintiffs identify Mr. Spencer and, indeed, in only a
handful do they allege transmission of any electronic
communication by Mr. Spencer.
Indeed, although Plaintiffs allege that "[o]ne Internet
tool Defendants used extensively to plan and direct illegal acts
was the chat platform Discord,"14 they do not allege and cannot
allege that Mr. Spencer communicated through that platform.15
Moreover, although Plaintiffs complain that Defendants
Damigo, Heimbach, Hill, Parrott, Ray, Schoep, Tubbs, and
Vanguard America have not produced any text messages, they do
not make any such allegation about Mr. Spencer.

As noted above,

Mr. Spencer has produced many text messages.
B.
1.

There is No Need for Metadata.16

Much, If Not All, of the Information Plaintiffs
Seek is in Their Possession or Otherwise Available
to Them Through Other, Less Expensive Means.

14

First Amended Complaint at Par. 71. A fair reading of the First Amended Complaint indicates that, in Plaintiffs'
view, Discord was -- overwhelmingly -- the principal means of communication among all Defendants (except Mr.
Spencer).

15

At the hearing before Judge Moon on May 24, 2018, lead counsel for Plaintiffs conceded that Plaintiffs (who, in
the First Amended Complaint) extensively refer to specific communications through Discord, had not found a
single communication by Mr. Spencer on Discord. Transcript of Motion to Dismiss (5/24/18) (Docket Entry 321).
16

Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Spencer "waived any objection to producing documents with metadata because [he]
failed to timely object. Motion at p. 12 (Document ID No. 3180). Mr. Spencer did, however, object to "each
instruction, definition and document request to the extent it purports to impose any requirement or discovery
obligation greater than or different from those under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ..." (Response at p. 3
[Exhibit 14 at Document ID No. 3274]). Mr. Spencer submits that, given that Rule 34 does not affirmatively state
that a responding party must produce documents in such a form that metadata is revealed, this objection was
sufficient to preserve an objections to production of metadata.

6

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 6 of 14 Pageid#: 3345

Plaintiffs cannot justify the proposed intrusion and burden
on Mr. Spencer given that much, if not all of the information
they seek is already in their possession or readily available to
them by other means.
Plaintiffs complain as follows:
Virtually none of the documents produced by
Defendants contain metadata -- such as sender, recipient and date sent -- for the files
provided. Virtually none of the documents
produced by Defendants contain metadata -such as sender, recipient and date sent -for the files provided.17
Yet, Plaintiffs already have such information in their
possession -- in Mr. Spencer's Response.
For example, pages 15 through 41 of Mr. Spencer's Response
set forth numerous "iMessages" between Mr. Spencer and alleged
co-conspirators -- and set forth dates of the communications,
identify participants in the communications and contain the
content of the communications.18
Similarly, pages 42 through 49 of the Response set forth
various e-mails between Mr. Spencer and alleged co-conspirators
-- and set forth dates thereof, identify authors thereof and
recipient and set forth attachments.19
Similarly, too, pages 53 through 68 of Mr. Spencer's
Response set forth numerous "tweets" or "retweets" by Mr.
17

19

Motion at p. 4 (Document ID No. 3172).
See Defendant's Exhibit 1 attached hereto.
See Defendant's Exhibit 2 attached hereto.

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 7 of 14 Pageid#: 3346

Spencer -- and set forth the dates of the communications,
identify him as the author and provide the "link" to the
tweets.20
In short, there is no need to for imaging by any third
party.21
C.

If the Court Orders Generalized ESI Imaging by a
Third-Party Vendor, Plaintiffs Should Bear the Cost.

1.

Miscellaneous Factors Bearing on Allocation of Cost22
a.

Plaintiffs' Requests Are Vague and Overbroad.

Various of Plaintiffs' requests are overbroad and vague.
See, e.g., Request No. 4 (documents "concerning violence,
intimidation or harassment of Person on the basis of race,
religion or ethnicity ..."); Request No. 6 ("[a]ll documents
concerning and communications concerning or with any Plaintiff
or Defendant ...").
b.

Likelihood of Finding Relevant Information

As argued above, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that
imaging likely will lead to discovery of relevant information.
c.

Any Information Sought Can Be Derived From Other Sources.

20

See Defendant's Exhibit 4 attached hereto.
If the Court determines that Plaintiffs are entitled to production of such documents in "native format," it
should order that Mr. Spencer produce them in such format and not that he submit his electronic devices to a
third-party vendor for generalized imaging.
21

22

Mr. Spencer notes that this analysis with respect to the costs of third-party imaging also applies to the issue
whether third-party imaging is warranted at all.

8

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 8 of 14 Pageid#: 3347

The documents of Mr. Spencer to which Plaintiffs refer are
available from other sources that are readily accessible to
Plaintiffs.
For example, publications by Mr. Spencer are publicly
available.23

So, too, are "tweets" or "re-tweets"24 and any on-

line videos by Mr. Spencer.25
d.

Plaintiffs Have Not Made any Showing of Relative Benefit.
Plaintiffs have not made any concrete showing of any tangle

benefit to them of third-party imaging of Mr. Spencer's
electronic devices.

For example, as argued above, Plaintiffs do

not even argue that Mr. Spencer has threatened to destroy or has
destroyed evidence; nor have they demonstrated any likelihood
that there is further responsive information.
e. The Cost of Imaging is Much More Easily Borne by Plaintiffs.
1.

Plaintiffs, Whose Case is Being Financed by a WellFunded Charity, Will Not Sustain Any Economic Hardship.

Plaintiffs, Mr. Spencer believes, are not paying for legal
representation.26

Instead, as stated in a press release issued

on October 12, 2017 by an organization called "Integrity First
for America," this lawsuit is being financed by that

23

Exhibit 18 at Document No. 3312.
See Response at pp. 53-68).
25
Exhibit 18 at Document No. 3311.
26
Plaintiffs are represented by two of the largest and most powerful law firms in the United States and by a
smaller, but equally prestigious law firm. It beggars the imagination to think that Plaintiffs are paying any legal
fees.
24

9

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 355 Filed 10/16/18 Page 9 of 14 Pageid#: 3348

organization.27

And one source of funds that Integrity First for

America uses to finance this lawsuit is on-line contributions by
donors.28
Thus, there would be no economic hardship imposed on
Plaintiffs if the Court did not impose on Mr. Spencer the costs
of any third-party imaging.
2.

Economic Hardship to Mr. Spencer29

If Mr. Spencer is constrained to pay for imaging by a
third-party vendor, he would have to divert his economic
resources from maintaining legal counsel30 to hiring an
information technology (IT) expert whose function would be to
provide Plaintiffs with information they already have.

27

The referenced press release can be found at the following hyperlink:
https://www.integrityfirstforamerica.org.

28

See https://secure.givelively.org/donate/integrity-first-for-america.
Mr. Spencer recognizes that a party objecting to production on the grounds of burdensomeness ordinarily is
required to provide specific information about the nature and degree of the burden. To date, however, the
undersigned counsel has been unable to consult with any third-party imaging vendor about costs. One wellrespected vendor recommended by a colleague of counsel in the Northern Virginia bar indicated he has a conflict
of interest because he is providing services to two of the law firms representing Plaintiffs. In addition, other two
vendors that counsel contacted have not responded to his inquiries.
29

Mr. Spencer respectfully submits that the Court should not require him to provide the ordinary substantiation
of burdensomeness given that the cost of third-party imaging simply is not known to him or counsel.
Counsel is also concerned that, because of the politically charged nature of this case, it might prove impossible
to find a third-party vendor willing to assist in this matter.
30

It is important to note that Mr. Spencer is defending against not only this lawsuit, but also a lawsuit brought in
the Circuit Court for the City of Charlottesville by two other alleged victims of the events of August 12, 2017. See
Tadrint Washington, et al. vs. James A. Fields, et al., CL No. 17-442.

III.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons and those to be advanced at oral
argument, the Motion should be denied.
Alternatively, if the Court orders electronic imaging, it
should not enter the Stipulation and Order submitted by
Plaintiffs but should make various material modifications to it
(which modifications Mr. Spencer will detail at oral argument).31

31

Such modifications include requiring Plaintiff to pay for imaging, providing Mr. Spencer much more time than
set forth in the proposed order for accomplishing any imaging and permitting defense counsel to review the
results of the imaging not only for privilege, but also for relevance. (Counsel will further confer with Plaintiffs'
counsel about these.)
