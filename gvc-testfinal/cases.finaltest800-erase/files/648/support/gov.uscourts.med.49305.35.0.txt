DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT BECAUSE
18 U.S.C. § 1960 IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE AS APPLIED
AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT
THEREOF
Mr. Sal Mansy and TV Toyz LLC, the defendants, through undersigned counsel,
respectfully moves this Honorable Court to dismiss Count One of the superseding
indictment. This count allege that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1960 by unlawfully
operating a money service business. This statute is unenforceable as written.
Prosecuting Mr. Mansy under this statute violates the fair notice requirements of the Due
Process clause because multiple terms contained in § 1960 are so vague that they fail to
provide him with notice of what conduct is criminal and what conduct is not.
The statute seeks to impose a criminal penalty on those who transfer “property” in
the form of Bitcoin. The phrase “whoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages,
supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting
business, shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than 5
years, or both.” covers money not property and since the IRS has designated Bitcoin as
property, it makes sense that the statute fails to draw a clear line between criminal and
non-criminal conduct. In addition, § 1960 fails to identify with the requisite specificity
what constitutes a culpable state of mind. Finally, § 1960 states that conduct is criminal if

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 2 of 19

PageID #: 80

a person transfers money not property as the IRS has stated. According to § 1960, “the
term “money transmitting” includes transferring funds on behalf of the public by
any and all means including but not limited to transfers within this country or to
locations abroad by wire, check, draft, facsimile, or courier”. This phrase is also
unconstitutionally vague. For these reasons, the statute is unconstitutional as applied, and
the Court should dismiss the indictment.
INDICTMENT
The Indictment states in Count I that Defendants, between March 2014 and June
2015, in the Eastern District of Michigan, District of Maine, did knowingly conduct,
control, manage, supervise, direct and own all and part of a money transmitting business
affecting interstate commerce, which failed to comply with the money transmitting
business registration requirement set forth in Title 31, United States Code, section 5330,
and the regulations prescribed thereunder, including Title 31, Code of Federal
Regulations, Section 1010.100 (ff)(5). In violation of Title 18, United States Code,
Sections 1960 and 2. There are civil forfeiture provisions as well.
FACTS ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT
HSI Portland, ME has initiated this case to investigate individuals operating
unlicensed money service businesses (MSBs) using Bitcoin and/or operating on or
through “darknet” websites. HSI Portland will specifically target individuals seeking
face-to-face transactions involving bulk U.S. currency in exchange for digital Bitcoin
transfers. Such individuals are being targeted due to a potential ability or willingness to
facilitate unlicensed U.S. currency to Bitcoin conversions for people who desire the

greatest anonymity and who are potentially attempting to avoid BSA reporting
requirements and/or hide the source or destination of their financial activity.
On May 6, 2015, SA David Fife appeared before Magistrate Judge John Rich III
of the United States District Court for the District of Maine in Portland, ME, and swore to
a search warrant affidavit for the email account ‘salmans@yahoo.com.’ The search
warrant was issued the same date, and SA Fife submitted it to Yahoo! via email on May,
8 2015.
On June 15, 2015, SA Fife received a response via FedEx from Yahoo!
containing a CD-Rom and a letter explaining the results. In the letter, Yahoo! described
that they had decided to provide one year of emails instead of the entirety of the account,
and provided the phone number of a paralegal at the company should SA Fife have any
questions. Shortly after receiving this letter, SA Fife and the AUSA assigned to this case
called the paralegal, and asked that the Yahoo! provide more than just one year of emails
in its response, since a time frame was not specified in the search warrant. As a result,
Yahoo! provided three years of emails from the account, and sent this result on June 23,
2015, in the form of a new CD-Rom.
Between late June and late August, 2015, SA Fife reviewed the contents of the
email account as provided by Yahoo!. The account consisted of approximately 6,486
emails, many of which appeared to be in Arabic and a large number of which also
appeared to be spam. Many of the remaining emails appeared to deal with MANSY’s
online streaming television business TVTOYZ.COM, while a significant portion also
dealt with his online trade in ‘peptides’ and steroid/HGH-type compounds.

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 4 of 19

PageID #: 82

Within the email account, SA Fife encountered approximately 12 automated
emails from ‘www.localbitcoins.com’ associated with the sale and/or purchase of Bitcoin
spread across 2013, 2014, and 2015, with the earliest being from September 28, 2013.
Only four such emails were from 2015, and SA Fife found none of the email
correspondence between himself and MANSY detailed in previous reports nor any of the
automated emails from ‘www.localbitcoins.com’ to MANSY associated with SA Fife’s
purchases of Bitcoin from him. Of the 6,486 emails, SA Fife encountered only 52 that
mentioned Bitcoin in any way and/or appeared to pertain to MANSY’s Bitcoin business.
Among these, however, SA Fife encountered the June 24, 2014, email exchange between
MANSY and Coinbase referenced in ROI #9 of this case file, during which Coinbase
notified MANSY that it was not going to do business with him anymore due to his
apparent operation of an unlicensed money service business. SA Fife further encountered
an

and

‘www.localbitcoins.com,’ in which the latter informed MANSY that his account was
being placed on a “forced holiday” due to “irregularities” found within it. On the same
date, MANSY responded, “What’s going on is that how you treat good sellers? I still
<sic> over $100,000 every month with no problem why are you stopping my account.”
No further communicated from ‘www.localbitcoins.com’ regarding this issue was
encountered within the account; however, as detailed in ROI #6 of this case file, by
December 22, 2014, MANSY’s account was active again and he was able to successfully
sell Bitcoin.

HISTORY OF §1960
The U.S. Department of Justice has recently engaged in a number of high-profile
investigations and prosecutions of Bitcoin and digital currency-related companies and
entrepreneurs.
Two prominent and headline-grabbing examples: In 2014, the DOJ prosecution of
Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem, resulting in a guilty plea and sentence of two years
imprisonment. And more recently the DOJ, in coordination with the U.S. Department of
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), entered into a settlement
agreement with Ripple Labs Inc. to resolve a criminal investigation. That settlement
resulted in $700,000 in civil money penalties and the company having to undertake
extensive remedial measures.
What many of these law enforcement actions have in common, including the two
just mentioned, is a single federal criminal statute on which they rely, in whole or in part.
That statute is 18 U.S.C. § 1960, which makes it a federal crime to operate an unlicensed
money transmitting business. Of all the criminal charges federal prosecutors can
investigate and bring, few are as easy to prosecute and as hard to defend against as a 1960
charge.
To understand why this is so, you need to understand what 1960 says today, how
it has changed over time, what changed as a result of the Patriot Act in 2001, and how it
is commonly interpreted.

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 6 of 19

PageID #: 84

18 U.S.C. § 1960 TODAY
As it stands today, 1960 provides, in pertinent part:
Whoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part
of an unlicensed money transmitting business, shall be fined in accordance with this title
or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both. (Emphasis added.)
1960 then goes on to list three categories of unlicensed money transmitting businesses,
which are, in a summarized fashion:
1. Those operating in a state that requires that business to be licensed and makes it a
misdemeanor or felony not to do so.
2. Those that fail to comply with Treasury Department regulations covering such a
business (e.g., registering with FinCEN).
3. Those that transmit money known to the transmitter to come from or intended to
finance criminal activity.
Importantly, in the first two categories (state licensing and Treasury Department
compliance), 1960 on its face does not require the DOJ to prove that the defendant knew
that he, she, or it needed a specific state license or had to comply with Treasury
regulations.

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 7 of 19

PageID #: 85

A 1960 charge is a serious offense. It is a felony and punishable by imprisonment
of up to 5 years and/or a hefty fine. Also the property connected to a violation can be
seized and subjected to civil and criminal forfeiture.
18 U.S.C. § 1960 BEFORE 2001
Before 2001, 1960 was significantly different, and it was much more difficult to
prosecute. The Patriot Act amended the statute to eliminate the “loophole” requiring a
defendant to know that he, she, or it was operating illegally. Pre-2001, the relevant
opening portion of 1960 read:
Whoever conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of a
business knowing the business is an illegal money transmitting business, shall be fined in
accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both. (Emphasis
added.)
In addition, the first category of unlicensed money transmitting businesses before
2001 read:
[Those] intentionally operated without an appropriate money transmitting license
in a [s]tate where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony. . .
(Emphasis added.)
The second category (Treasury Department compliance) was unchanged with the
Patriot Act, and the last category, which focused on money laundering concerns (as noted
above), was a new addition.

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 8 of 19

PageID #: 86

The Patriot Act’s removal of “knowing the business is an illegal money
transmitting business” in the first part of 1960 and “intentionally” in the first category of
unlicensed money transmitting businesses has had major repercussions.
HOW 18 U.S.C. § 1960 HAS BEEN INTERPRETED
According to the DOJ and the few courts that have confronted the issue (with
reported decisions), 1960 is now a general intent crime, meaning there is no criminal
intent required to be guilty of committing it. A defendant only has to commit the specific
prohibited act to be found guilty (e.g., a defendant only has to be operating a money
transmittal business in State X without the required state license).
The changes to 1960 as a result of the Patriot Act are important for the emerging
Bitcoin and digital currency industries, which are under intense law enforcement
scrutiny. This is because only three states (SC, NM, MT) do not have money
transmission licensing regimes. For the 52 other states and territories, that do, the
requirements can be confusing and complex. Knowing if you need a state license is not
always so clear, especially with certain innovative business models. And the Treasury
Department has numerous requirements that are burdensome and complicated to
implement properly, even if registering with FinCEN is itself relatively easy and
straightforward.
It should also be emphasized that an individual or group of individuals can be
charged with a 1960 offense. 1960 is not limited to entities that are incorporated or
otherwise have some formal legal status.

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 9 of 19

PageID #: 87

Overall, as it stands today, the DOJ’s view on 1960 is that it does not matter if a
defendant knew he, she, or it had to comply with the law’s provisions, as long as the DOJ
can prove that that defendant did not comply, that defendant can be charged with and
found guilty of a 1960 violation. This view obviously provides the DOJ with tremendous
discretion in bringing a 1960 charge and with a relatively low hurdle for securing a
conviction. Thus, if an individual or business accidentally failed to get a state license or
violated a minor Treasury Department rule, for example, they could face a felony
prosecution.
All that said, attorneys defending a client charged with a 1960 violation have
argued that despite the Patriot Act changes to 1960, there remains a criminal intent
requirement, and some judges have agreed to a certain limited extent. For example, in
U.S. v. Talebnejad, a father, mother, and their son were charged with violating 1960
because they operated two money transmitting businesses in Maryland without the
necessary state license, where it is a crime do so “knowingly and willfully.” The district
court held that the federal prosecutor needed to prove that the family acted “knowingly
and willfully” as the state law requires. The prosecutor appealed, and the Fourth Circuit
reversed, finding that the Patriot Act amendments removed any intent requirement. A
dissenting appellate judge held that the Patriot Act only removed 1960’s previous intent
requirement if the underlying conduct was tied to a federal offense (category two:
Treasury Department compliance), not if the charge was predicated on a failure to abide
by state regulatory requirements (category one).

PageID #: 88

Defendant Mansy now argue that otherwise innocuous behavior may be
criminalized and punished without a showing of moral culpability because § 1960 and §
5330 now regulate previously unregulated businesses and purport to punish violators
regardless of whether business owners knew of their obligation to register with
authorities.
There is no guidance on Bitcoin cases, however, in the case out of Maryland we
might see some additional guidance.

UNITED STATES V. TALEBNEJAD
Federal authorities charged Farhad, Fatameh, and Abodlrahman Talebnejad with
operating an IVTS that allegedly sent $18 million to unidentified individuals in Iran.
Farhad Talebnejad investigated whether his business needed a Maryland license.
After consulting with a Maryland official, Farhad concluded he did not need one because
the Talebnejad’s business, the Shirazi Money Exchange, did not “sell[] drafts or
physically transmit[] money.” Nevertheless, because the Shirazi Money Exchange sent
money abroad through the United Arab Emirates without registering with Marylandor
federal authorities, the Talebnejads were indicted on two counts of violating § 1960.
The U.S. District Court for Maryland dismissed the indictment, concluding that §
1960(b)(1)(A) violated the Talebnejads’ due process rights.
First, it reasoned that because § 1960(b)(1)(A) incorporated Maryland state law,
which required knowing and willful mens rea, Maryland state law controlled. Congress’

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 11 of 19

PageID #: 89

attempt to “extinguish the mens rea requirement” was “inoperative in states such as
Maryland” that had prescribed a higher showing for violation of licensing statutes.

The court held that under Maryland law the government had to allege and prove
the Talebnejads’duty to acquire a state license. Any other reading could expose not only
owners to criminal liability, but also “any number of individuals affiliated with an
unlicensed money transmitting business.”
Second, the court found that § 1960(b)(1)(B) violated the Talebnejads’ due
process rights. The statute contained an intentional mens rea requirement, thus it had to
be shown that the “[d]efendant knew he was required to register his money transmission
business with the U.S. Treasury and that he intentionally failed to do so.”
The court reasoned that Congress created a strict liability offense in §
1960(b)(1)(B) because it did not expressly prescribe a mens rea element, unlike §
1960(b)(1)(A).
Subsection 1960(b)(1)(B) offended due process requirements because it lacked
mens rea, it did not involve public welfare or morality, and it was punishable with five
years imprisonment and possible forfeiture of millions of dollars.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, upholding § 1960(b)(1)(B) as a
valid general intent crime. Section 1960(b)’s mens rea term is found in § 1960(a):
“[W]hoever ‘knowingly conducts . . . an unlicensed money transmitting business.’”
Subsection 1960(b)(1)(B) defines an “unlicensed money transmitting business.”
Therefore, the government had only to allege and prove mens rea as to the crime’s factual

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 12 of 19

PageID #: 90

elements contained in § 1960(a), i.e. “that [the Talebnejads] were conducting a money
transmitting business that affected interstate commerce and that [it] was unregistered.”

The Fourth Circuit held that the lower court erred by incorporating the Maryland
mens rea into § 1960(b)(1)(A). Rather, the statute’s legislative history revealed that
Maryland law was relevant only insofar as it made violating the licensing statute
punishable under federal law.
Therefore, the question was whether “Congress exceeded constitutional bounds
when it declared that ignorance of state licensing requirements is not a defense to liability
under the federal statute.”
The court found that Congress had not—due process requires that Congress
specify a mens rea element as to the factual circumstances of a crime but not legal
elements, which, in the court’sopinion, it had. Although he found §1960(b)(1)(A) and (B)
facially valid, Judge Gregory dissented in part to “express [his] concern that these
provisions could raise substantial due process questions in some circumstances.”
First, because § 1960(b)(1)(A) incorporates state law, the government must allege
and prove all of the legal elements under Maryland law, in addition to those in the federal
statute.
It follows then that even though § 1960(b)(1)(A) does not provide its own mens
rea term, a successful prosecution would nevertheless require proof of the incorporated
state law’s mens rea elements.

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 13 of 19

PageID #: 91

Second, Judge Gregory explained that § 1960(b)(1)(A) and (B), while facially
valid, “might not provide constitutionally sufficient notice of possible regulation,” giving
rise to due process violations under particular factual circumstances.
In such cases and especially in this Bitcoin case, an “as-applied” challenge to §
1960(b)(1)(A)-(B) should be considered as a due process challenge on the fundamental
fairness of this vague and misleading use of §1960 to Bitcoin cases wherein there is no
real guidance for the courts .
The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that any law that
imposes criminal liability must give potential defendants fair warning of what conduct is
proscribed. Criminal liability cannot be imposed without “‘fair warning . . . in language
that the common world will understand of what the law intends to do if a certain line is
passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.’” United
States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265 (1997) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S.
25, 27 (1931)). Due process “bars enforcement” of a statute that uses “‘terms so vague
that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application.’” Id. at 266 (quoting Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391
(1926)).
When examining a statute with vague terms, courts may impose a “judicial gloss”
to supply the “clarity at the requisite level . . . on an otherwise uncertain statute[.]” Id.
This “gloss,” however, is limited. First, due process prevents a court from applying a
novel construction of a criminal statute in any given case; the statute, standing alone or as
previously construed, must make it reasonably clear at the time that the defendant
engages in the conduct targeted by the prosecution that the conduct was criminal. Id.; see

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 14 of 19

PageID #: 92

also id. at 265 n.5 (describing the principle that conduct may not be treated as criminal
unless it has been so defined by a competent authority before the conduct has occurred).
Second, the “gloss” must be just that – minor clarifications and limitations.
“Federal crimes are defined by Congress, not the courts[.]” Id. at 267 n.6 (citation
omitted). A judicial construction of a statute cannot effectively re-draft the legislation.
The “judicial gloss” may only go so far as necessary to give effect to congressional
intent. See id. A court “may impose a limiting construction on a statute only if it is
readily susceptible to such a construction.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521
U.S. 844, 884 (1997) (quotation omitted). This gloss cannot add omitted terms or
redefine existing ones. A court cannot “rewrite a . . . law to conform it to constitutional
requirements.” Id. at 884-85 (quotation omitted). Courts having to now interpret § 1960
in the current context of Bitcoin a so-called “virtual currency” will have to rewrite the
statute, adding omitted terms, and changing and interpeting others. As discussed below,
even with the existing constructions of the statute, § 1960 as it relates to Bitcoin and
Defendant Mansy § 1960 fails to give fair notice under the Due Process Clause.

ARGUMENT

THE PHRASE “WHOEVER KNOWINGLY CONDUCTS,
CONTROLS, MANAGES, SUPERVISES, DIRECTS, OR OWNS ALL
OR PART OF AN UNLICENSED MONEY TRANSMITTING
BUSINESS, SHALL BE FINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 15 of 19

PageID #: 93

TITLE OR IMPRISONED NOT MORE THAN 5 YEARS, OR BOTH”
IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE.
Another way in which § 1960 fails to provide fair notice of what conduct
constitutes a crime, and what conduct does not, is in the phrase “Whoever knowingly
conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed
money transmitting business, shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned
not more than 5 years, or both.” Under the plain terms of the statute, conduct is criminal
if the person operates a money transmitting business. This phrase is also constitutionally
flawed.
Initially, the fact that the phrase is written in the disjunctive, covering all
circumstances related to “money transfers”, creates a sweep of such breadth as to violate
the Constitution. It criminalizes conduct that does not into the statute. Bitcoin being a
form of property is not money and therefore the statute in it’s plain form is does not yet
encompass investment opportunities like trading Bitcoin.
No existing judicial gloss saves this phrase. Courts use the phrase when they infer
a scienter requirement – reasoning that evil motive, potential bad purpose, and acting
with the intent to injure the United States is the mens rea necessary to save the statute
from the constitutional graveyard. But the actual statute uses the phrase to describe the
type of business without any such “intent” element; no the state of mind. The phrase
modifies “is operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a State
where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under State law,
whether or not the defendant knew that the operation was required to be
licensed or that the operation was so punishable.” The statute lists the types “money

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 16 of 19

PageID #: 94

transfers” it covers, so long as they relate to the “transfer of funds on behalf of the
public”. Each term and element of § 1960 can only be defined using the other terms and
elements related to an unconnected Fin CEN regulation. Therefore, no judicial
interpretation of the statute serves to clarify any of the vague terms, because the statute
§1960 does not reference virtual currency. Only since, July 21, 2011, when FinCEN
published a Final Rule amending definitions and other regulations relating to money
services businesses (“MSBs”). Among other things, the MSB Rule amends the
definitions of dealers in foreign exchange (formerly referred to as “currency dealers and
exchangers”) and money transmitters. On July 29, 2011, FinCEN published a Final Rule
on Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access (the “Prepaid Access
Rule”). This guidance explains the regulatory treatment under these definitions of persons
engaged in virtual currency transactions. However, this MSB rule amendment was never
referenced in the statute, even though the statute references others: section 5330 of title
31, United States Code.
Should judicial constructions that delete or add to the statutory phrase modifying
the scope of information covered by the Act, use it as a modifier to the culpable intent,
obscure an element of the offense and constitute one of the most significant constitutional
flaws in the statute? Under the plain terms of the statute, the government must prove that
the defendant has reason to believe that he was operating a Money Transmitting
Business, but the statute fails to provide any guidance on what that looks like as it relates
to “virtual currency” like Bitcoin. Moreover, no judicial construction of the statute
identifies or deals with this conflict.
There are no guideposts here, only that the defendant has reason to believe that

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 35 Filed 05/17/16 Page 17 of 19

PageID #: 95

Bitcoin is in fact money or currency. This statutory requirement, however, is far too
abstract a standard to satisfy the requirements of the statute as read plainly. There is
nothing “narrow, objective, or definite” about the phrase or the limits on the type of
business that would bring Bitcoin within the realm of criminal conduct.
18 USC § 1960, fails with specific clarity to provide a defendant with fair notice
of what constitutes criminal conduct related to virtual currency. The phrase is too
abstract. Moreover, it contemplates punishing conduct even when no identifiable
government interest is harmed. No judicial construction limits the phrase; the only
constructions of the phrase employ it as a means of creating an additional scienter
requirement, rendering any further use, of the phrases cited above, circular. Using the
phrases in this way simply highlights the significant constitutional problems with the
statute. The phrase leaves only conjecture and surmise about what the government must
prove in order to secure a conviction. That conjecture and surmise is insufficient to give
fair notice under the Due Process Clause.

CONCLUSION
Section 1960 is a statute of alarming breadth and little definition. Because the
statute is vague, this Court should dismiss the indictment.
