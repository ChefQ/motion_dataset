TO ALL PARTIES HEREIN AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF
RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on March 3, 2008, at 10:30 a.m., or as
soon thereafter as this matter may be heard in Courtroom Seven before the
Honorable Thomas J. Whelan of the above -entitled Court, located at 940 Front
Street, San Diego, California 92101, Defendants Sprint Solutions, Inc. and Sprint
Spectrum L.P. (collectively "Sprint") will and hereby do move the Court pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for an order dismissing the claims of
Plaintiff Utility Consumers' Action Network ("ULAN") for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and to stay this case and refer Plaintiffs' fifth cause of action to the
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") pursuant to the primary jurisdiction
doctrine.

Unless requested by the Court, there will be no oral argument on this
motion, pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d)(1).

Sprint bases this Motion on the following grounds:

1.

Plaintiff UCAN has not suffered an injury in fact to itself and

therefore lacks standing to sue.

2.

Plaintiffs' fifth claim for relief based on alleged violation of the

Federal Communications Act must be referred to the Federal Communications
Commission under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the remainder of this case
stayed.
