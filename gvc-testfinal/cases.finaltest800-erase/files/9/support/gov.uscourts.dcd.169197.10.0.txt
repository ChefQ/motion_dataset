STATE OF WYOMING’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF UNOPPOSED MOTION TO INTERVENE
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Western Organization of Resource Councils and Friends of the Earth
(conservation organizations) ask this Court to halt federal coal leasing. Doc. 1 at
66. They argue that all coal leasing activities must cease until the federal
defendants supplement a 1979 programmatic evaluation of federal coal
management with an analysis of climate change impacts related to coal leasing. Id.

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 4 of 14

Wyoming is the largest producer of coal in the United States.1 Most of the
coal produced in Wyoming is mined from federal lands.2 As a result, the federal
coal leasing the conservation organizations seek to suspend generates hundreds of
millions of dollars in annual revenues for the State of Wyoming. To protect
Wyoming’s interests in those revenues, and the coal leasing regulatory system into
which it has invested its resources, Wyoming has moved the Court for leave to
intervene as a party-defendant as of right, or, in the alternative permissively, under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. This memorandum supports that motion.
ARGUMENT
I.

Wyoming is entitled to intervene as of right.
An applicant for intervention as of right must show: (1) the timeliness of the

motion; (2) “an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject
of the action”; (3) that “the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action
may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant’s ability to protect that
interest”; and (4) that “the applicant’s interest is [not] adequately represented by

existing parties.” Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1074 (D.C. Cir.
1998) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)). The applicant also must demonstrate
standing “because a Rule 24 intervenor seeks to participate on an equal footing
with the original parties to the suit[.]” City of Cleveland v. NRC, 17 F.3d 1515,
1517 (D.C. Cir. 1994). A “district court must grant a motion to intervene” if the
prospective intervenor meets these requirements. Amador Cnty., Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t
of the Interior, 772 F.3d 901, 903 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).
Wyoming meets these requirements. Wyoming has timely sought to
participate in this litigation at the outset. Wyoming is entitled to intervene as of
right because the relief the conservation organizations seek will harm Wyoming’s
multiple regulatory and revenue interests in federal coal leasing, and the federal
defendants cannot adequately represent the State of Wyoming’s interests in this
matter. Accordingly, the Court should grant Wyoming’s motion for leave to
intervene as of right. See WildEarth Guardians v. Salazar, 272 F.R.D. 4, 18-20
(D.D.C. 2010) (permitting Wyoming to intervene to defend federal coal leasing);
see also Order Granting Mot. to Intervene, WildEarth Guardians v. Salazar, No.
1:10-cv-01133, ECF Doc. 22 (D.D.C. Sept. 20, 2010).
A.

Wyoming’s motion is timely.

A motion to intervene must be timely filed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). Courts
judge timeliness of a motion to intervene “in light of all of the circumstances.”
3

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 6 of 14

United States v. British Am. Tobacco Austl. Svcs., Ltd., 437 F.3d 1235, 1238 (D.C.
Cir. 2006) (citation and quotation omitted). Accordingly, courts consider, among
other things, the “time elapsed since the inception of the suit, the purpose for
which intervention is sought, the need for intervention as a means of preserving the
applicant’s rights, and the probability of prejudice to those already parties in the
case.” Id. Courts measure timeliness “from when the prospective intervenor ‘knew
or should have known that any of its rights would be directly affected by the
litigation.’” Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2003)
(quotation omitted).
Wyoming has sought to participate from the outset of this litigation, before
the Defendants have answered the suit or filed the administrative record.
Wyoming’s intervention at this early stage, less than two months after the
conservation organizations filed their complaint, will not prejudice any of the
parties. For these reasons, Wyoming’s motion to intervene is timely. See Fund for
Animals, Inc. v. Norton, 322 F.3d 728, 735 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (motion within two
months of complaint filing is timely).
B.

Wyoming has protectable interests in coal leasing.

To satisfy the protectable interest requirement of Rule 24, a prospective
intervenor must show “an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the
subject of the action[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). The D.C. Circuit treats the
4

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 7 of 14

interest requirement under Rule 24(a)(2) as equivalent to standing. Jones v. Prince
George’s Cnty., Md., 348 F.3d 1014, 1018 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Thus, a party seeking
to intervene to defend government action must “establish that it will be injured in
fact by the setting aside of the government’s action it seeks to defend, that this
injury will have been caused by the invalidation, and the injury would be prevented
if the government action is upheld.” Am. Horse Prot. Ass’n, Inc. v. Veneman, 200
F.R.D. 153, 156 (D.D.C. 2001); see also Military Toxics Project v. EPA, 146 F.3d
948, 954 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (finding defendant intervenor must show that it “would
suffer concrete injury if the court grants the relief the [plaintiffs] seek”); Cnty. of
San Miguel, Colo. v. MacDonald, 244 F.R.D. 36, 44 (D.D.C. 2007) (stating
defendant intervenors must show “a real likelihood they will sustain a direct injury
if the plaintiffs prevail in obtaining any of the relief they are requesting”).
Federal coal leasing generates hundreds of millions of dollars in annual
revenues for Wyoming. Grenvik Aff. 3, ¶ 7. During just fiscal year 2013, federal
coal leasing yielded almost $1 billion in Wyoming revenues from severance and ad
valorem taxes, lease bonus payments, and mineral royalties. See id.; Garland Aff.
2, ¶ 5.3 Severance and ad valorem taxes on coal production provided Wyoming
with $507,348,457 in revenue during fiscal year 2013. Grenvik Aff. ¶ 3, ¶ 7; see
also Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 39-14-102(m), -103(a), -104(a) (imposing state taxes on

coal production). During the same period, federal coal leasing provided Wyoming
with $238,725,045 in coal lease bonus payments. Garland Aff. 2, ¶ 5; see also 30
U.S.C. § 191(a) (allocating royalty and bonus shares to states). Wyoming uses
these revenues to fund state programs, cities, counties, public schools and colleges,
and water and highway infrastructure projects. Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 39-13-111, 3914-801; see also Grenvik Aff. 4, ¶ 6; Garland Aff. 3, ¶ 6.
Given the fiscal importance of coal leasing, Wyoming has invested
substantial resources into its role as a regulatory partner in the federal coal leasing
regime. Wyoming participates in the review of every application to lease federal
coal reserves within the State as a member of the Powder River Regional Coal
Team. See, e.g., Notice of Public Meeting of Powder River Regional Coal Team,
78 Fed. Reg. 23,951 (April 23, 2013) (noticing meeting to discuss coal leasing
applications). Wyoming also acts as a cooperating agency in the evaluation of the
environmental impacts of every federal coal lease in Wyoming, through the
Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.4 The Wyoming Department of
Environmental Quality has created comprehensive programs to regulate the land,
water, and air quality impacts of coal mining, including a federally approved state
program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. See Wyo. Stat.

Ann. § 35-11-401 through -437 (establishing land quality regulatory program); 30
C.F.R. § 950.10 (federal approval of Wyoming program).
If this Court grants the conservation organizations the relief they seek,
federal coal leasing will grind to a halt. During that moratorium, none of the
additional recoverable coal reserves in Wyoming will be available for leasing and
mining. As a result, Wyoming will be deprived of the anticipated revenues on
which its programs rely until the federal government completes the lengthy NEPA
process the conservation organizations desire. In turn, Wyoming programs
dependent on coal leasing revenues will suffer from the loss of funds. The loss of
those governmental revenues “constitutes a concrete and imminent injury” that
would be “fairly traceable” to the conservation organizations’ success in this
litigation. Fund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 733; see also Akiachak Native Cmty. v.
Dep’t of the Interior, 584 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2008); Cnty. of San Miguel, 244
F.R.D. at 47. At the same time that Wyoming would suffer from the loss of coal
leasing revenues, Wyoming’s investments in the existing federal coal leasing
infrastructure would be stranded until leasing resumed. Cf. Idaho Farm Bureau
Fed’n v. Babbitt, 58 F.3d 1392, 1397 (9th Cir. 1995) (“A public interest group is
entitled as a matter of right to intervene in an action challenging the legality of a
measure it has supported.”) (citing Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v. Watt, 713 F.2d

7

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 10 of 14

525, 527 (9th Cir. 1983)); see also S.D. Farm Bureau, Inc. v. South Dakota, 189
F.R.D. 560, 564-65 (D.S.D. 1999).
If, on the other hand, this Court upholds the federal government’s coal
leasing actions, Wyoming will not be exposed to these risks of injury. Proven
reserves of coal will remain available for leasing, as they have been for years, and
leasing of those reserves will continue to generate revenues on which Wyoming
relies to provide public services. In turn, Wyoming’s investments in the coal
mining regulatory regime will retain their value. Because the conservation
organizations’ success in this action will concretely harm the State of Wyoming
and that harm will be avoided if the federal action is upheld, Wyoming has
protectable interests in this action and standing to intervene as a defendant.
C.

The conservation organizations’ claims threaten to impair
Wyoming’s interests in coal leasing.

To satisfy the impairment requirement, an intervenor must also show that
“disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s
ability to protect its interest[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). This Court considers the
“practical consequences” the action could have on the intervenor’s interests. Am.
Horse Protection Ass’n, 200 F.R.D. at 158 (citations omitted). Accordingly,
impairment can be shown in many ways. For example, a prospective intervenor’s
interest “may be impaired where a decision in the plaintiff’s favor would return the
issue to the administrative decision-making process, notwithstanding the
8

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 11 of 14

prospective intervenor’s ability to participate in formulating any revised rule or
plan.” WildEarth Guardians v. Nat’l Park Serv., 604 F.3d 1192, 1199 (10th Cir.
2010) (citation omitted); see also Fund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 735. Similarly,
impairment of interests will be found “when the disposition of the action would
result in a substantial change in the status quo with respect to those interests.”
District of Columbia v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 826 F. Supp. 2d 227, 234
(D.D.C. 2011); see also Fund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 735. And, of course, the
loss of revenues constitutes impairment for purposes of intervention. Fund for
Animals, 322 F.3d at 735 (citing Mova Pharm., 140 F.3d at 1076).
The conservation organizations’ claims threaten to impair Wyoming’s
financial and regulatory interests in federal coal leasing. If the conservation
organizations prevail, Wyoming will suffer a loss of revenues that would otherwise
continue to accrue from coal production. Wyoming’s interests in the coal mining
regulatory system also would be impaired if the conservation organizations
succeed because that success “would return the issue to the administrative
decision-making process” and “result in a substantial change in the status quo” of
federal coal leasing. WildEarth Guardians, 604 F.3d at 1199; District of Columbia,
826 F. Supp. at 234. Wyoming’s “loss of revenues during any interim period
would be substantial and likely irreparable,” and “there is no question that the task
of reestablishing the status quo if the [conservation organizations] succeed[] in this
9

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 12 of 14

case will be difficult and burdensome.” Fund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 735 (citation
omitted). Therefore, this action places Wyoming’s protectable interests at risk of
impairment.
D.

The United States does not adequately represent Wyoming’s
interests in coal leasing.

To intervene as of right, an intervenor must also show that the existing
parties do not adequately represent its interests. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). The
burden on an applicant to show that existing parties do not adequately represent its
interests is not onerous. Dimond v. District of Columbia, 792 F.2d 179, 192 (D.C.
Cir. 1986) (citations omitted). The applicant must show only that the representation
may be inadequate. Id. A government party will not be presumed to represent
adequately a proposed intervenor with “a more narrow and ‘parochial’ interest not
shared by the [government],” because the government “would be shirking its duty
were it to advance this narrow interest at the expense of its representation of the
general public interest.” Id. at 193 (citation omitted); see also Fund for Animals,
322 F.3d at 735-36 (holding that even where the interests of a federal agency and
another governmental entity overlap and the federal agency takes the other
government’s interests into account, the federal agency does not adequately
represent the other government’s interests).
In this matter, the federal defendants do not adequately represent
Wyoming’s interests in federal coal leasing. The federal defendants principal
10

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 13 of 14

interests are broadly representing the public and fulfilling their obligations under
federal law. Wyoming, by contrast, is interested in the revenues federal coal
leasing generates for Wyoming and the investments Wyoming has made in coal
mining regulation. Though Wyoming and the federal defendants are both generally
interested in seeing the conservation organizations’ claims fail, the federal
government’s broad interests preclude it from adequately representing the more
narrow interests, such as state severance tax revenues, that it does not share with
Wyoming. Accordingly, the existing parties do not adequately represent
Wyoming’s interests in this litigation.
II.

Alternatively, Wyoming should be allowed to intervene permissively.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(1)(B) provides that “[o]n timely

motion, the court may permit to intervene anyone who … has a claim or defense
that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.” The decision
whether to allow permissive intervention “is an inherently discretionary
enterprise.” EEOC v. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., Inc., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C. Cir.
1998) (citation omitted).
If allowed to intervene permissively, Wyoming will respond squarely to the
conservation organizations’ claims that federal coal leasing is unlawful absent
another programmatic environmental impact analysis. In defense of federal coal
leasing, Wyoming will present factual and legal arguments that show the
11

Case 1:14-cv-01993-RBW Document 10 Filed 01/30/15 Page 14 of 14

conservation organizations’ are not entitled to the relief they request. And, because
Wyoming has timely moved to intervene in this matter, the existing parties will not
be prejudiced by Wyoming’s participation. Accordingly, if the Court does not
allow Wyoming to intervene as a party-defendant as of right, it should grant
Wyoming permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).
CONCLUSION
For the forgoing reasons, the State of Wyoming requests leave to intervene
in this matter as of right pursuant to Rule 24(a), or alternatively, permissively
pursuant to Rule 24(b).
