Pursuant to Civil L.R. 6-3(a), Plaintiff John Lofton (“Lofton”) hereby moves to extend
the time for filing his Opposition to Defendant Carlson Companies, Inc.’s (“CCI”) Motion to
Dismiss to July 11, 2008 and the hearing date for CCI’s Motion to Dismiss to August 1, 2008.
CCI’s Motion is presently set for March 28, 2008. Under ordinary operation of Civil
L.R. 7-3(a), Lofton’s Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss is due on March 7, 2008.
I.

Lofton Sought the Defendants’ Stipulation to This Extension
Lofton sought to have all of the Defendants stipulate to this Motion. (Preston Decl. ¶

4.) The other Defendants indicated that they would not oppose this Motion, but CCI was not
able to provide a definitive response to Lofton’s request within the admittedly short time
frame at issue. (Id. ¶¶ 4-7.) Given the time needed to draft and file an effective Opposition and
CCI’s previous conduct in this case, Lofton has concluded that prudence requires filing this
Motion immediately, without waiting for a definitive response from CCI. Lofton’s counsel
takes to heart the admonition that it “should strive to be cooperative, practical and sensible,
and should turn to the courts (or take positions that force others to turn to the courts) only in
extraordinary situations that implicate truly significant interests.” In re Convergent Tech. Sec.
Litig., 108 F.R.D. 328, 331 (N.D. Cal. 1985). Lofton is, therefore, eager to withdraw this
Motion if CCI will stipulate to a suitable extension.
II.

Lofton Will Be Prejudiced Without the Extension
Lofton will be substantially prejudiced if the deadlines are not extended. Lofton needs

the requested extension to conduct adequate discovery to effectively oppose CCI’s Motion to
Dismiss.
Lofton is entitled to discovery. CCI’s Motion hinges on statements in its supporting
declarations which directly contradict the allegations in Lofton’s Complaint. (Cf. Pl.’s Compl.
¶¶ 13-14, 47, 61-62, 69, 70-71, 76-78 with CCI Mot. Dismiss 1, 3-4. 10, 12-13 16, 18 (citing
Cahill Decl. ¶¶ 27-28, Grinde Decl. ¶¶ 4-7).) “Discovery . . . should be granted where
pertinent facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction are controverted or where a more
satisfactory showing of the facts is necessary.” Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express
Co., 556 F.2d 406, 430 n.24 (9th Cir. 1977) (citation, punctuation omitted). CCI’s own

authorities state that discovery must be allowed on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction unless a defendant “meet[s] the relatively high burden of establishing that ‘it is
clear that further discovery would not demonstrate facts sufficient to constitute a basis for
jurisdiction.’” Orchid Biosciences, Inc. v. St. Louis University, 198 F.R.D. 670, 673 (S.D. Cal.
2001) (cited by CCI Mot. Dismiss 18 and quoting Wells Fargo, 556 F.2d at 430 n.24.) See
also eMag Solutions, LLC v. Toda Kogyo Corp., No. 02-1611, 2006 WL 3783548, *2 (N.D.
Cal. Dec. 21, 2006) (adopting Orchid’s reasoning). However, the current deadline for
Lofton’s Opposition effectively prejudices his right to discovery. (Preston Decl. ¶ 8.) Lofton
does not have enough time to take the discovery he needs to rebut CCI’s declarations before
March 7. (Cf. id. with Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(2), 34(b)(2), 36(a)(3) (30 day deadlines for
discovery requests).) The extension sought here will provide Lofton sufficient time to take
discovery to establish the Court’s personal jurisdiction over CCI. (Preston Decl. ¶ 9.)
The prejudice threatening Lofton is attributable to CCI’s conduct in this litigation.
Lofton first served discovery on CCI on January 8, 2008. (Id. ¶ 36.) Through a variety of
gambits detailed in the attached declaration, CCI has delayed responding to that discovery.
(Id. ¶ 34-44.) On February 18, CCI’s counsel sought (and received) an extension to extend its
discovery deadlines to March 4. (Id. ¶¶ 41, 43.) CCI’s counsel gave no indication that CCI
would file its Motion to Dismiss two days later, on February 20, 2008. (Id. ¶ 41.)
Thus, CCI will produce its discovery responses three days before Lofton’s Opposition
to CCI’s Motion is due. CCI’s counsel has already indicated that “in light of our objections to
jurisdiction and the fact that we are not the administrator of the WorldPoints Travel Rewards
Program,” Lofton’s counsel should anticipate that CCI’s responses “will most likely be
limited.” (Id. ¶ 7.) This statement obviously raises questions about how complete CCI’s
eventual discovery responses will be. Even if three days were enough time for Lofton’s
counsel to review CCI’s discovery responses and prepare an effective Opposition to CCI’s
Motion, it plainly cannot also resolve a motion to compel in that time frame.1 Given CCI’s

1
While Lofton’s outstanding discovery requests are generally relevant to the issues identified
28 in CCI’s Motion to Dismiss, Lofton cannot proceed on the outstanding discovery requests
alone. These requests did not (and could not) anticipate the arguments made in CCI’s Motion,

past conduct in this case, the limitations on Lofton’s time to oppose CCI’s Motion appear to
be the intended fruits of a deliberate gambit. (See id. ¶ 34-44.) Had CCI filed its Motion to
Dismiss at the outset of this case and had not delayed discovery from its opening stages,
Lofton could have taken the discovery he needed by now – eliminating Lofton’s present need
for this Motion. CCI cannot be heard to complain about any delay purportedly caused by the
extension requested in this Motion, where the ultimate cause of any such delay was CCI’s
own conduct.
III.

The Extension Will Not Substantially Effect the Schedule of the Case
The extension sought in this Motion will not delay this case. On February 21, the

Court set the case management conference for April 25, 2008. There are no pending discovery
cut-off dates that could be postponed by the extension. Pursuant to Civil L.R. 6-3(a)(5), a
detailed accounting of the previous time modifications in this case is provided in the attached
declaration. It suffices to say here that Lofton has accommodated a number of requests for
extensions by the Defendants.
Indeed, the extension sought should not delay proceedings at all because CCI’s Motion
to Dismiss is properly resolved at trial. The assertions on which CCI’s Motion depends
contest the basic facts underlying Lofton’s claims: e.g, did CCI participate in assessing
fraudulent overcharges against WorldPoints credit card holders when they redeemed their
WorldPoints for airline tickets? (Cf. Pl.’s Compl. ¶¶ 13-14, 47, 61-62, 69, 70-71, 76-78 with
citing Cahill Decl. ¶¶ 27-28.) Where resolution of CCI’s Motion overlaps with the substantive
merits of Lofton’s claims and the facts relevant to both are intertwined, the resolution of
CCI’s Motion should be deferred until trial:
Where the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the merits, a decision on the
jurisdictional issues is dependent on a decision of the merits . . . [I]t is
preferable that this determination be made at trial, where a plaintiff may present
his case in a coherent, orderly fashion and without the risk of prejudicing his
case on the merits
Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Associates, Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 n.2 (9th Cir.
1977). See also ADO Finance, AG v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 931 F. Supp. 711, 719 (C.D.

Cal. 1996) (where evidence supporting application of alter ego doctrine would tend to
establish both foreign corporation’s liability and the court’s jurisdiction, the “question of
personal jurisdiction will be best resolved at trial”). As CCI’s Motion is properly resolved at
trial, there is no reason to believe this extension would necessarily delay the resolution any
other aspect of this case.2

Lofton anticipates that, after he has had a reasonable opportunity to take discovery, his
Opposition will ultimately present facts sufficient for the Court to deny CCI’s Motion to
28 Dismiss with prejudice. Hence, Lofton does not seek to continue the hearing on CCI’s Motion
until trial in this Motion.
