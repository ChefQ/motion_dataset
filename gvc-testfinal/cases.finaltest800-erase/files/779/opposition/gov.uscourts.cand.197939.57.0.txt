SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

2

Plaintiff’s motion for a four month extension on Defendant Carlson Companies, Inc.’s

3

(“CCI”) motion to dismiss is nothing more than a transparent delay tactic, accompanied with an

4

incomplete disclosure of facts. The facts will clearly demonstrate that this case is in its infancy,

5

that Plaintiff knew since January 22 that CCI intended to file a motion to dismiss, that CCI’s

6

motion raises genuine issues regarding personal jurisdiction, that Plaintiff admits in his Complaint

7

that he is “ignorant” of the role of CCI in the alleged misconduct, that Plaintiff has not identified

8

any discovery needed to oppose CCI’s motion, and that, most of all, the urgency was created

9

solely by Plaintiff because he insists on having an injunction and class certification hearing before

10

CCI’s legitimate personal jurisdiction motion can be resolved. Plaintiff has been threatening a

11

very quick hearing on an injunction and class certification, and most recently scheduled a hearing

12

on those matters for April 4. CCI would have no problem in granting an extension for limited

13

discovery on jurisdictional matters if Plaintiff would likewise agree to proceed with the injunction

14

and class certification hearing after the personal jurisdiction challenge is decided. Unfortunately,

15

he will not agree.

16

II.

CCI’S PERSONAL JURISDICTION MOTION WAS NOT A SURPRISE.

17

Plaintiff complains that CCI gave him no indication that it would file a motion to dismiss.

18

He is not correct. To the contrary, CCI did notify Plaintiff of its objection to personal jurisdiction

19

and the very real possibility that CCI would file a motion to dismiss in the near future. In fact,

20

Plaintiff has known since January 22–over a month ago–that CCI objected to personal jurisdiction

21

when CCI asserted this objection as its Second Affirmative Defense in its Answer to Plaintiff’s

22

Complaint. (Le Dec. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4.) Moreover, the parties filed a stipulation on January 23, 2008

23

in which all the defendants except CCI agreed to restrictions on filing a motion to dismiss. (Id. at

24

¶¶ 7-11 & Ex. 5-10.) Plaintiff agreed:

25

IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED, by and between the undersigned
parties, that Bank of America Corp., FIA Card Services, N.A.,
Carlson Travel Network Associates, Inc., and Carlson Travel
Group, Inc. (that is, all Defendants besides Carlson Companies,
Inc.) will not notice or schedule the hearing for any motion to
dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint (or similar responsive motion in lieu
of an answer prior to April 2, 2008.

(Id. at ¶ 10 & Ex. 9-10.) Thus, Plaintiff knew that CCI was planning to file a motion to dismiss in

2

advance of the Plaintiff’s preliminary injunction hearing. His cries of surprise are inconsistent

3

with facts.

4

III.

5

PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE WHY HE IS ENTITLED TO
POSTPONE JURISDICTIONAL DISCOVERY UNTIL FOUR MONTHS AFTER
THE INJUNCTION AND CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES ARE DECIDED.

6

Nowhere in Plaintiff’s motion does he explain why he needs or is even entitled to a four

7

month extension. Plaintiff also has not made a requisite showing that jurisdictional discovery is

8

warranted. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co., 556 F.2d 406, at 430 n. 24 (9th Cir.

9

1977). While Plaintiff claims that he needs the requested time to conduct discovery to oppose

10

CCI’s motion, he does not explain what kind of discovery is needed, why he is entitled to it or

11

why it will take him four months to do so. He has not explained why he has not attempted this

12

discovery to date. He has not shown any danger to the public health or any other reason why his

13

injunction hearing has to occur before this Court determines the legitimate personal jurisdictional

14

issues.

15

Nevertheless, CCI has never told Plaintiff that it would not allow him to conduct

16

jurisdictional discovery, subject to Plaintiff’s demonstration that such discovery is warranted.

17

Plaintiff just simply has not met his prerequisite prima facie burden for jurisdictional discovery.

18

Wells Fargo, 556 F. 2d at 430. (“It is clear that plaintiffs bear the burden…of making an initial,

19

prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts at the pleading stage…”) Instead, Plaintiff complains

20

about CCI’s limited responses to Plaintiff’s pending merit based discovery. (Motion at 3:19-23)

21

This pending discovery, however, does not seek information about CCI’s jurisdictional contacts

22

with California. Rather, the requests seek information regarding the WorldPoints Travel Rewards

23

Program and transactions at issue in the Complaint, with which CCI had no involvement.

24

Therefore, it should be of no surprise to Plaintiff that CCI will have very little information to

25

disclose. Even so, while under no obligation to do so, CCI in good faith highlighted this to

26

Plaintiff’s attention ahead of time. (Le Dec. ¶ 18 & Ex. 14.) CCI even suggested that the parties

27

stay their efforts on this merit based discovery in the interest of time and economy. (Id.)

28

While CCI would be agreeable to jurisdictional discovery, Plaintiff has yet to provide a

detailed explanation of the kind of discovery he seeks. For example, is Plaintiff seeking written

2

discovery or depositions? Moreover, Plaintiff has still not explained why he needs or is entitled

3

to four months to conduct his discovery. Plaintiff cites to the thirty day discovery rule in his

4

motion. (Motion at 3:12-13.) But this still does not explain why Plaintiff needs 126 days!

5

IV.

CCI WILL BE SEVERELY PREJUDICED BY A FOUR MONTH EXTENSION.

6

CCI will suffer severe prejudice by a four month extension during which time it will be

7

forced to continue investing unnecessary time, effort and expenses litigating a case over which

8

the Court does not have jurisdiction. Plaintiff has made no offer to stay the merits of the case

9

during the period in which it seeks to delay resolution of CCI’s jurisdictional challenge. On the

10

contrary, Plaintiff unreasonably insists that CCI continue litigating the merits of the case.

11

Plaintiff expects CCI to complete its merit based discovery responses. Plaintiff also expects CCI

12

to oppose Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction and class certification and appear for

13

hearing on the motion on April 4. Notably, just yesterday, Plaintiff renoticed his preliminary

14

injunction hearing for April 4 as he had been threatening in the past. On the other hand, Plaintiff

15

offers absolutely no reason why the class certification and injunction hearing must be decided so

16

quickly. The burden and expense imposed upon CCI far exceeds any benefit Plaintiff would

17

derive, especially since CCI is not subject to this Court’s jurisdiction.

18

Plaintiff claims that the extension should not delay proceedings because CCI’s motion is

19

properly resolved at trial. His argument is based on the unsupported assumption that CCI’s

20

jurisdictional challenge “overlaps” with the merits of the case. (Motion at 4:15-28.) First, it is

21

unclear how Plaintiff could make that argument since his complaint alleges that he is “ignorant”

22

of the role of CCI in the alleged activity. Plaintiff misinterpreted of the standard set forth by Data

23

Disc Court as to when jurisdictional challenges are better addressed at trial. Data Disc held that

24

the jurisdictional facts must be “intertwined with the merits of the action”, not just “overlap.”

25

Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Associates, Inc., 557 F. 2d 1280, 1285 n. 2 (9th Cir. 1977).

26

There is no showing here that CCI’s jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the merits of

27

Plaintiff’s action. As demonstrated in CCI’s motion to dismiss, CCI was not the administrator of

28

the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Program and never made any travel purchases on behalf of

WorldPoints card holders. These facts can easily be established through declarations, such as the

2

ones attached to CCI’s motion. The “merits” at issue in Plaintiff’s case go to whether the travel

3

charges to the WorldPoints card holders were unfair and violated the CLRA, UCL and various

4

alleged fiduciary duties.

5

defendants purchased airline tickets for WorldPoints customers. That goes to whether Plaintiff

6

has sued the proper defendant and, in CCI’s case, whether jurisdiction is proper. Where there is

7

no demonstration that jurisdictional facts are enmeshed with the merits of the action, such as in

8

this case, a jurisdictional challenge is properly decided on a motion to dismiss before trial. Penny

Plaintiff does not prevail on his case simply by proving that the

IF THE COURT IS INCLINED TO EXTEND THE HEARING DATE ON CCI’S
JURISDICTIONAL MOTION, THEN CCI MAKES THIS CONDITIONAL
MOTION THAT THE COURT LIKEWISE EXTEND THE DATE FOR THE
HEARING ON THE MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND
INJUNCTION FOR A REASONABLE TIME AFTER THE JURISDICTIONAL
ISSUE IS DECIDED.

15

If the Court extends CCI’s hearing date on its motion to dismiss to a later date, this Court

16

should stay all merit based discovery against CCI in the interim, and reset the hearing date for

17

Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Class Certification for a reasonable time after the

18

personal jurisdiction motion is decided.

19

resolved first. Fir that reason, CCI noticed its motion to dismiss for hearing before Plaintiff’s

20

preliminary injunction. CCI should not be subjected to briefing and a hearing on Plaintiff’s

21

motion if it should properly be dismissed from the case.

22
23

CCI’s jurisdictional challenge must be heard and

Such a stay would be consistent with well established case law limiting the development
of the merits of a case while challenges to jurisdiction are pending.

24

Inasmuch as a dispositive motion is pending, the Court concludes
that allowing discovery which extends beyond jurisdictional issues
at this juncture would place a burden upon Defendant which far
exceeds any benefit Plaintiff would derive. Should Defendant
prevail on its motion to dismiss, any effort expended in responding
to merits-related discovery would prove to be a waste of both
parties’ time and resources. Should Defendant's motion be denied,
however, Plaintiff will still have ample time and opportunity to
conduct discovery on the merits.

PLAINTIFF DID NOT ATTEMPT IN GOOD FAITH TO REACH A
STIPULATION WITH CCI REGARDING AN EXTENSION.

8

Plaintiff filed this motion because CCI would not immediately agree to his terms for a

9

stipulated dismissal. Last Friday afternoon, Plaintiff sent CCI a proposal to dismiss CCI from

10

this lawsuit, conditioned upon a number of requirements. (Le Dec. at ¶ 14.) When CCI’s counsel

11

was unable to confer with their client and provide Plaintiff’s counsel with a response in 48 hours,

12

Plaintiff requested that CCI stipulate to a 120 day continuance. (Id. at ¶ 15 & Ex. 11.) Because

13

CCI’s counsel was unable to confer with their client and immediately respond to Plaintiff’s

14

proposed time extension in 24 hours, Plaintiff rushed to file this motion. (Id. at ¶¶ 17 & 18.)

15

Plaintiff did not give CCI adequate to his proposal, nor did he provide CCI with alternatives to his

16

proposed extension. Rather, he unreasonably and unrealistically expected CCI to immediately

17

accept his all or nothing proposed 120 day extension. Upon not hearing from CCI within hours

18

and despite assurances from CCI’s counsel that she was seeking client approval, Plaintiff filed

19

this motion. (Id. at ¶ 20.) It is evident that the time constraints of which Plaintiff bemoans are

20

caused by his own inactions.

21

VII.

CONCLUSION

22

For the foregoing reasons, CCI respectfully requests that this Court deny Plaintiff’s

23

request for a four month extension on Plaintiff’s opposition deadline and the hearing date on

24

CCI’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.

25

Plaintiff’s current March 7 opposition deadline and the current March 28 hearing date.

26

Alternatively, if the Court is inclined to grant Plaintiff an extension, CCI asks that the Court stay

all merit based discovery against CCI in the interim, and reset the hearing date and related

28

briefing schedule for a reasonable time after the personal jurisdiction motion is decided and that

On November 30, 2007, Plaintiff served his Summons and Complaint on CCI.

Approximately two weeks after filing his Complaint, Plaintiff filed his Motion for

On January 8, 2008, Plaintiff propounded special interrogatories, requests for

Attached hereto as Exhibits 1 through 3 are Plaintiff’s first set of discovery requests.

Upon learning of CCI’s objection to his proposal, Mr. Preston attempted to secure

a stipulation with the other defendants without CCI. Attached hereto as Exhibit 7 is a true and

10

Mr. Gagliardi forwarded to me. Mr. Preston wrote: “I’d like know whether or not CTG and

11

CTNA will consent to the stipulation without CCI.”

12

10.

CCI did not change its position. On January 23, 2008, Mr. Preston circulated a

13

revised proposed stipulation, wherein he carved CCI out of the following provision:

14

17

IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED, by and between the undersigned
parties, that Bank of America Corp., FIA Card Services, N.A.,
Carlson Travel Network Associates, Inc., and Carlson Travel
Group, Inc. (that is, all Defendants besides Carlson Companies,
Inc.) will not notice or schedule the hearing for any motion to
dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint (or similar responsive motion in lieu
of an answer prior to April 2, 2008.

18

Attached hereto as Exhibit 8 and 9 are true and accurate copies of emails from Mr. Preston to me,

19

wherein he wrote: “[P]lease take a look at the revised stipulation I circulated this morning. I

20

believe it should satisfy CCI’s prior objections.” (See Ex. 9.)

CCI was agreeable with the revised stipulation. Attached hereto as Exhibit 10 is a

On February 15, 2008, the Court reassigned this case from Judge Jenkins to Judge

Illston and vacated all hearings dates on previously noticed motions.

CCI filed its Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction on February 20,

2008. Because CCI’s jurisdictional challenge must be resolved first, CCI noticed its motion for

Page 11 of 11

On February 28, 2008, Plaintiff renoticed his motion for preliminary injunction

and class certification for hearing on April 4, 2008. Meaning that if the Court grants Plaintiff an

3

extension on his time to respond to CCI’s motion, Plaintiff’s motion will be heard first.
22.

As a result of Plaintiff’s actions yesterday, I contacted Mr. Preston this morning

5

and asked that he agree to continue the hearing and related briefing on his motion for preliminary

6

injunction and class certification if the Court determines that an extension is warranted on CCI’s

7

motion to dismiss, because CCI’s jurisdictional challenge must be resolved first. Attached hereto

8

as Exhibit 15 is a true and accurate copy of my email to Mr. Preston.
