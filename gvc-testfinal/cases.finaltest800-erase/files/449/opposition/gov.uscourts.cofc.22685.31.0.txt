DEFENDANT’S CROSS-MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant, United States of America, hereby cross-moves for summary judgment
pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rule of the United States Court of Federal Claims. Plaintiffs allege
that they possess ownership interest in two railroad rights-of-way located in Butler County and
Reno County, Kansas. Plaintiffs’ claims are premised on the allegation that they are the fee
simple owners of lands that are subject to a railroad easement. Plaintiffs allege that these
easements were abandoned or extinguished by operation of Kansas state law, and that the
decision of the Surface Transportation Board permitting the “railbanking” of the subject rightsof-way for future rail use and interim trail use pursuant to the National Trails System Act, 16
U.S.C. § 1247(d), constitutes a taking of their property interests in the right-of-way. Plaintiffs
have moved for partial summary judgment on title and liability issues. For the reasons set forth
in the supporting memorandum filed herewith, Defendant opposes Plaintiffs’ motions and crossmoves for summary judgment.

Defendant’s summary judgment memorandum addresses three issues. First, although
there is no dispute that the permanent takings claims alleged in the Plaintiffs’ complaints are
timely, the claim accrual date advanced by Plaintiffs is based on a misinterpretation of the
Federal Circuit’s precedential rulings. Under those rulings, the Biery Plaintiffs’ permanent
takings claims accrued on April 8, 2004, and the permanent takings claims alleged by the
Pankratz Plaintiffs accrued on June 5, 2005. Accordingly, Defendant moves for partial summary
judgment with respect to the proper claim accrual date for the permanent takings claims alleged
in the Plaintiffs’ respective complaints.
The second issue addressed in this memorandum is title, which is a threshold element in
all takings claims. In order for Plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof on this element, the must
establish: (1) that the railroads acquired only an easement in the rights-of-way at issue, and (2)
that each named Plaintiff is the fee owner of some or all of the lands burdened by that easement
on the date of the alleged taking. With respect to the first prong of this inquiry, there are
segments of the subject rights-of-way that the railroads acquired in fee. Plaintiffs have no
ownership interest in these segments and summary judgment must be granted in favor of
Defendant on the claims that relate to those segments. With respect to the second prong of this
inquiry, even for those segments in which the railroad acquired only an easement, Plaintiffs (with
one exception) have not met their burden of proving that they are the fee owners of the land
subject to that easement. Moreover, one of the Biery Plaintiffs has no ownership interest
whatsoever. The absence of proof on this aspect of the title issue requires the denial of
Plaintiffs’ motions for partial summary judgment at this time.
The third issue addressed in Defendant’s summary judgment memorandum is the
question of liability. For those portions of the subject rights-of-way where that were held by the

railroads as easements (and where Plaintiffs have established that they are the fee owners of the
land subject to those easement), there is no liability for a taking because the uses of the subject
rights-of-way authorized by the Trails Act – railbanking and interim trail use – are permissible
present uses of those rights-of-way under Kansas law.

In addition, contrary to Plaintiffs’

assertions, the railroads have not abandoned their property interests in the subject rights-of-way.
Instead, the actions of the railroads are fully consistent with an intent to preserve and maintain
the rights-of-way (which is permissible under Kansas law), and to retain the right to re-enter the
rights-of-way for the purpose of restoring rail service. Under Kansas law, these actions
demonstrate the railroads’ intent to preserve the rights-of-way, rather than to abandon them.
Alternatively, there is no liability in this case because, under Kansas law, a right-of-way acquired
for a public purpose can be converted from one public use (active rail use) to another
(railbanking and interim trail use) without infringing upon the rights of the servient estate holder
and without causing an abandonment of the right-of-way.
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in Defendant’s supporting memorandum, Plaintiffs’
motion for partial summary judgment should be denied and Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment should be granted.
