DEFENDANT’S PROPOSED FINDINGS OF UNCONTROVERTED FACT
Pursuant to RCFC 56(h)(1), Defendant submits these proposed findings of
uncontroverted fact.
PANKRATZ FACTS
1.

The railroad right-of-way at issue in Pankratz is a 10.6-mile right-of-way that extends
between milepost 483.62 in Augusta, Kansas and milepost 494.22, near Andover,
Kansas.

2.

This 10.6-mile right-of-way and rail line was originally constructed by the St. Louis,
Wichita & Western Railway Company (“SLW&W”) and formed a part of the Oswego to
Wichita line. Def. Ex. 3 (Historic Report, Ex. E to Abandonment Exemption). The
railroad acquired its interests in the segments of this 10.6-mile right-of-way that are at
issue in this case by means of two written instruments. The first is the condemnation
instrument, which includes segments of the subject right-of-way that abut the lands

owned by the six Plaintiffs.1 See Def. Ex. 10 (Pankratz Straup Decl. at ¶ 5); Def. Ex. 10-1
(Condemn. Commissioners’ Report, dated Nov. 4, 1879).2 The second is a quitclaim
deed by which the railroad acquired a portion of the right-of-way that abuts the property
owned by Plaintiff Colling. Def. Ex. 10-2. The railroad acquired other parcels along the
subject right-of-way not abutting the named Pankratz Plaintiffs by various conveyance
instruments in addition to the condemnation instrument.

3.

Construction of this railroad began in 1879 and was completed by May 1880. Def. Ex. 3
(Hist. Report). Through a series of railroad mergers, ownership of the subject right-ofway was transferred to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company (“BNSF”) in
1995. Id.

4.

On January 11, 2002, the STB issued or served an Acquisition Exemption notice in STB
Finance Docket No. 34139. A copy of this Acquisition Exemption appears at Tab J of
the Pankratz Plaintiffs’ Proposed Facts (Doc. 33-3, pp. 4-5). In the Notice of Exemption
filed by the County under 49 C.F.R. § 1150.31, the County proposed to acquire (by

1

Pankratz Plaintiffs include (1) Jeremey and Erin Pankratz; (2) Donald and Evangeline Wedell;
(3) Thad J. Colling; (4) the Thick Gon Mar Trust; (5) Michael and Marcia Woods; and (6) Floyd
and Becky Myers. The Pankratz Plaintiffs have indicated that they plan to file a motion for class
certification but have not done so yet. Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment is limited
to the claims of the named Plaintiffs, as is this cross-motion.

Defendant’s Exhibit 10 is the Declaration of Cindi Straup addressing certain title records
relating to the Pankratz Plaintiffs. The exhibits attached to her declaration are identified by
reference to the exhibit number assigned to the declaration (10) and the number assigned to each
exhibit attached to that declaration. Accordingly, exhibit 1 to Straup’s declaration is identified
as Defendant’s Exhibit 10-1.

donation) approximately 10.6 miles of rail line from BNSF.

5.

Butler County (the “County”) acquired this 10.6-mile railway line by donation from the
BNSF. The County intended to rehabilitate the line and locate an operator in order to
preserve the rail service in the area. Def. Ex. 2, p. 1 (BNSF Environmental Report);
Pankratz Pls.’ Proposed Facts, Tab J (Doc. 33-3, p. 4).

6.

When the County was unable to locate an operator, it filed a Notice of Exemption under
49 C.F.R. § 1152.50 seeking authority to abandon the 10.6 miles of rail line. See
Pankratz, Pls.’ Proposed Facts, Tab K (Doc. 33-3, pp. 6-7) and Tab M (Doc. 33-3, pp. 1516). The exemption became effective on August 4, 2004, meaning that on that date, and
absent any further orders from the STB, the County would be authorized to abandon the
rail line. Id., Tab C (Doc. 33-2); Tab K (Doc. 33-3); and Tab M (Doc. 33-3).

7.

The Abandonment Exemption issued by the STB stated in part that,
Pursuant to the provisions of 49 CFR 1152.29(e)(2), the County
shall file a notice of consummation with the Board to signify that it
has exercised the authority granted and fully abandoned the line.
If consummation has not been effected by the County’s filing of a
notice of consummation by July 2, 2005, and there are no legal or
regulatory barriers to consummation, the authority to abandon will
automatically expire.

The STB issued a decision on August 2, 2004, which modified the exemption served and
published on July 2, 2004, by making the exemption “subject to the condition that the
County consult with [the National Geodetic Survey (NGS)] and provide NGS with 90
days’ notice before disturbing or destroying any geodetic markers” that might be affected
by the proposed abandonment of the 10.6-mile rail line. Pankratz Pls.’ Proposed Facts,

9.

By a letter dated July 30, 2004, Prairie Travelers, Inc. (“PTI”) expressed an interest in
negotiating a railbanking and interim trail use agreement with the County. Def. Ex. 4.

10.

On September 9, 2004, Butler County faxed a letter to the STB in response to the letter
filed on July 30, 2004, by PTI. In the letter of September 9, the County notified the STB
that it “has not consummated the abandonment of the lines and is willing to negotiate for
trail use with Prairie Travelers.” Def. Ex. 5.

11.

On September 14, 2004, the STB issued a NITU which provided a 180-day period during
which the parties could negotiate a voluntary agreement. Pankratz Pls.’ Proposed Facts,
Tab C.

12.

Butler County and PTI did not reach a railbanking and interim trail use agreement during
the 180-day negotiating period provided by the NITU of September 14, 2004, nor did
either party request an extension of that negotiating period. The 180-day negotiating
period expired on March 13, 2005. See Tab C, p. 4 (“If an agreement for interim trail

Pankratz Pls.’ Proposed Facts, Tab C at 4 (Doc. 33-3, p. 11 of 20).

14.

By a letter dated April 26, 2005, Butler County Economic Development (“BCED”)
requested the issuance of a new NITU for the subject right-of-way. Def. Ex. 6. This
letter was received by the STB on May 2, 2005. Id.

15.

By letters dated May 16, 2005, and May 23, 2005, Butler County responded to BCED’s
request, and indicated that it had not yet abandoned the line and agreed to negotiate a
railbanking agreement. Def. Ex. 8–9.

16.

On June 2, 2005, the STB issued a Decision and NITU in response to the request from
BCED. Pankratz Pls.’ Proposed Facts, Tab D. The Decision and NITU of June 2, 2005,
modified the STB’s decision of September 14, 2004 (which authorized Butler County to
abandon the rail line at issue), to allow the County and BCED 180 days to negotiate a
railbanking and interim trail use agreement. Id., p. 2.

The railroad originally acquired its interests in the segments of the corridor that abut the
Biery Plaintiffs’ properties by way of several different conveyance instruments. Two of
these instruments are condemnation instruments in the form of commissioners’ reports.
See Def. Ex. 22 (Declaration of Cindi A.R. Straup for Biery v. United States (“Biery
Straup Decl.”)). In addition, the railroad acquired portions of the right-of-way that abut
