FEDERAL'S MOTION TO COMPEL
PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS BASED UPON CITY OF NEWARK'S
INTENTIONAL WAIVER OF PRIVILEGE

Third-Party Defendant, Federal Insurance Company ("Federal"), moves to compel
Third-Party Plaintiff, City of Newark (the "City'), to produce all privileged documents relating
to the issues set forth in the May 16, 2006 letter of the City's designated representative, Carol
Houck. In support thereof, Federal avers as follows:

1. On August 22, 2006, the City filed its Answering Brief in opposition to
Federal's Motion in Limine to Exclude the Deposition Errata Sheets of the City's designated
representative, Carol Houck.

2. . Attached as an exhibit to that Answering Brief was a letter from the City's
designee, Carol Houck, to the City's trial counsel, Paul Cottrell, relating to the legal issues at the

core of the City's allegations against Federal. The City's trial counsel intentionally attached that

letter to their submission to the Court.

3. On August 22, 2006, Federal requested that the City produce all
communications, regardless of privilege, between the City and its counsel relating to matters
raised in the letter, as well as the errata sheets. Federal requested an immediate response from
the City's counsel and notified the City's counsel that a failure to do so would result in Federal's
having to seek relief through the Court.'

4. The City refused to produce the requested documents.

5. The attachment of the May 16, 2006 letter to the City's Answering Brief
constitutes an intentional waiver of any privilege that the City has to communications relating to
the issues set forth in the letter, as well as Mr. Houck's errata sheets."

6. Accordingly, the City's claim of privilege is waived, and Federal is

entitled to all privileged documents relating to the issues set forth in the May 16, 2006 letter.

 

A copy of Federal's August 22, 2006 request to the City is attached hereto as Exhibit "A."
? This is not the first time that the City has waived privilege. The Court has previously ruled that any
privilege related to Roger Akin's memorandum, dated May 27, 2004, as City Solicitor was waived due to its
publication. (See D.I. 81).

WHEREFORE, for these reasons and those set forth in the accompanying

Opening Brief, which is incorporated herein by reference, Federal respectfully requests that the

Court compel the City to produce to Federal all privileged documents relating to the issues set

forth in the May 16, 2006 letter.

Respectfully submitted,
