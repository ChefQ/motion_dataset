CONCISE STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED
Whether this Court should exclude in advance of trial the testimony of four witnesses
regarding the recording agreements at issue in this case, when the ruling Plaintiffs seek
encompasses not only the “unexpressed intent” they claim is inadmissible but also includes
wholly relevant and probative evidence of industry custom and practice?
Defendants’ answer: No.

BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 3
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine No. 3 asks this Court to exclude the testimony of four

witnesses as to their “unexpressed understanding” of the meaning of the 1998 and 2003 Eminem
Agreements. While Defendants do not disagree that a party generally cannot introduce evidence
of its own unexpressed intent, Plaintiffs’ Motion seeks to exclude something entirely different —
evidence of custom and practice in the music industry. California law makes a clear distinction
between irrelevant, undisclosed subjective intent and relevant custom and practice evidence. It is
black-letter law that custom and practice evidence is relevant and admissible. Defendants’
witnesses are permitted to testify as to the meaning of the Controlled Composition clause, as
established by industry custom and practice.
At the very least, this is an issue the Court may handle much more easily on a question by
question basis at trial, which is the preferred course recommended by the Sixth Circuit over
broad-based in limine motions. See Sperberg v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 519 F.2d 708,
712 (6th Cir. 1975). Otherwise, the Court must consider the issue hypothetically based on what
testimony Defendants might present, rather than what testimony Defendants actually seek to
present. A pre-emptive, blanket exclusion of this broad category of all four witnesses’
“unexpressed understanding” of the entirety of the Agreements is wholly overbroad and
unnecessary, and would sweep in and deprive the Court and Defendants of the benefit of highly
relevant custom and practice evidence. Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied.
II.

ARGUMENT
A.
The Testimony of Paterno, Nieves, Hoffman and Rogell Is Relevant and
Admissible as Custom and Practice Evidence.
First, the Court must consider extrinsic evidence of a contract’s meaning where the

parties dispute it. Wolf v. Superior Court, 114 Cal. App. 4th 1343, 1350 (2004) (“‘Where the

1
8842598.1

meaning of the words used in a contract is disputed, the trial court must provisionally receive any
proffered extrinsic evidence which is relevant to show whether the contract is reasonably
susceptible of a particular meaning.’”) (quoting Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas
Drayage & Rigging Co., 69 Cal. 2d 33, 39-40 (1968)); see also Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 69 Cal.
2d at 39-40 (“[R]ational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible
evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.”). Extrinsic evidence aids the court in
determining whether the contract is “reasonably susceptible” to a meaning urged by a party.
Once extrinsic evidence demonstrates that the contract is “reasonably susceptible” to the
meaning urged, the court considers the extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract. Wolf, 114
Cal. App. 4th at 1351.
Second, it is well-settled under California law that evidence of custom and practice in an
industry is relevant and admissible as extrinsic evidence to illuminate contractual terms. Wolf,
114 Cal. App. 4th at 1354-55, 1357 (“[T]he proffered evidence regarding trade usage and custom
was relevant to prove an interpretation to which the agreements were reasonably susceptible in
the entertainment industry context.”); Ermolieff v. R.K.O. Radio Pictures, 19 Cal. 2d 543, 550
(1942) (“[I]f in reference to the subject matter of the contract, particular expressions have by
trade usage acquired a different meaning, and both parties are engaged in that trade, the parties to
the contract are deemed to have used them according to their different and peculiar sense as
shown by such trade usage. Parol evidence is admissible to establish the trade usage, and that is
true even though the words are in their ordinary or legal meaning entirely unambiguous.”).
Further, the rule that unexpressed, subjective intent is inadmissible does not bar custom and
practice evidence. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Zuckerman, 189 Cal. App. 3d 1113, 1141
(1987) (“While a party may not testify to his undisclosed subjective intent in entering into an
agreement, the rule does not preclude admission of evidence of the surrounding circumstances,

2
8842598.1

usage and custom in the industry, negotiations and discussion, or any other extrinsic evidence
which may shed light on the mutual intention of the parties.”) (emphasis added).
Here, the testimony that Plaintiffs seek to exclude from Mr. Paterno, Ms. Nieves, Mr.
Hoffman and Ms. Rogell is evidence of custom and practice in the music industry — not
evidence of the parties’ unexpressed intent. The parties dispute the meaning of the Controlled
Composition clause in the Eminem Agreements, specifically the phrase “will be licensed.”
Accordingly, the Court must admit extrinsic evidence, including custom and practice evidence,
at least provisionally to determine whether the language of the Controlled Composition clause is
reasonably susceptible to the meaning urged by either Plaintiffs or Defendants.
For example, Plaintiffs claim that Marnie Nieves’ testimony about the general
understanding within the music industry of the operation of Controlled Composition clauses like
the one at issue in this case is “unexpressed intent” that must be excluded. Mot. at 3. But the
testimony Plaintiffs point to is clearly custom and practice evidence, wholly admissible under
California law. Ms. Nieves testifies that in her experience in the “negotiation of these provisions
with attorneys that represent artists” it is a “common understanding” that Controlled
Composition clauses phrased as “is hereby licensed” and “will be licensed” have the same
operation. Pl’s Ex. C at 109-110. That is textbook custom and practice evidence, not
unexpressed intent. Plaintiffs have had or will have ample opportunity to cross-examine Ms.
Nieves on whether that is an accurate reflection of industry custom, and the Court can weigh the
evidence accordingly.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Objection Is Better Dealt With at Trial On a Case-By-Case Basis.

“Orders in limine which exclude broad categories of evidence should rarely be employed.
A better practice is to deal with questions of admissibility of evidence as they arise.” Sperberg v.
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 519 F.2d 708, 712 (6th Cir. 1975). In this case, Plaintiffs seek to
exclude the broad category of four witnesses’ understanding of whole contracts, not just the core
3
8842598.1

clause at issue. Even if the Court is inclined to agree with Plaintiffs that the witnesses’ testimony
consists of unexpressed intent rather than custom and practice evidence, the Court should
consider each witnesses’ testimony at trial and make a determination then whether the witness is
offering inadmissible evidence. Such an approach would ensure that custom and practice
evidence — which is clearly relevant and admissible — is not improperly excluded.
III.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs seek an overbroad order excluding relevant and admissible evidence of industry

custom and practice. Their Motion should be denied.
