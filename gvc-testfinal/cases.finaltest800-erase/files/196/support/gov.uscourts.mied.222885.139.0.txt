INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Eight Mile Style, LLC and Martin Affiliated, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)

move the Court to exclude the testimony of Defendants’ witnesses as to their unexpressed
understanding of the meaning of the 1998 and 2003 Recording Agreements. Any such testimony
is irrelevant under California law, which governs the interpretation of these two contracts, but
Defendants have indicated by their deposition designations that they intend to offer this
inadmissible testimony of at least some of their witnesses. All four of the witnesses described
below admitted in deposition that while they were involved with negotiating one or both of the
Recording Agreements, they had no recollection of any conversations with representatives of
F.B.T. Productions or Eminem regarding the wording, meaning or prospective application of the
“Mechanical Royalties” paragraph, yet they also testified as to their unexpressed understanding
and opinion about that paragraph’s application.
II.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
One aspect of this copyright infringement case revolves around the interpretation of a

portion of one section of the 1998 and 2003 recording agreements among Eminem, F.B.T.
Productions (Eminem’s production company), and Defendant Aftermath (the “Recording
Agreements”). Defendants allege the “Mechanical Royalties” provision in those contracts grants
them Digital Phonorecord Delivery (“DPD”) licenses in Plaintiffs’ Compositions, while
Plaintiffs argue it does not. The Recording Agreements state that California law governs their
interpretation.
During the discovery, Plaintiffs deposed four individuals employed by Aftermath or its
owner Interscope Records: Peter Paterno, Aftermath’s outside counsel, who oversaw the drafting

of the 1998 Agreement and whose form that agreement was based on; Marnie Nieves, Mr.
Paterno’s associate who helped draft the 1998 Agreement; Rand Hoffman, head of business and
legal affairs for Interscope Records, who oversaw the drafting of the 2003 Agreement, and Lisa
Rogell, an attorney in Interscope’s business and legal affairs department who helped draft the
2003 Agreement. In deposition, each of these individuals testified that they did not recall any
conversations with Plaintiffs or with Eminem’s representatives regarding the meaning or intent
behind the portion of the “Mechanical Royalties” provision at issue, but each also offered their
opinions about what that provision means.
a. Testimony of Peter Paterno
As Aftermath’s outside counsel, Mr. Paterno oversaw the drafting and negotiation of the
1998 Agreement, assisted by his associate, Marnie Nieves. Guilford Decl. Ex. A, Deposition of
Peter Paterno dated April 30, 2008 (“Paterno Dep.”) at 31:11-32:10, 82:13-83:25. Mr. Paterno
acknowledges the 1998 Agreement was based on a form he drafted, but does not specifically
recall any conversations with the representatives of F.B.T. who negotiated the agreement
regarding the “Mechanical Royalties” paragraph. Id. at 112:11-113:10.
Despite not recalling any discussions of the paragraph at issue, in deposition Mr. Paterno
went on to offer his opinions about what he understood the “Mechanical Royalties” section to
mean. Mr. Paterno testified he “didn’t think” the language of the “Mechanical Royalties”
paragraph required a separate license, but when asked for the basis of this opinion offered that he
was “just saying in general.” Id. at 72:22-73:11. Mr. Paterno also testified, for example, that he
“doubted” there were any discussions about the “Mechanical Royalties” language used in the
1998 Agreement, but also opined that he saw no difference in its wording, when compared to

2

another contract that had different language. Id. at 112:11-114:17. Mr. Paterno’s testimony
concerning the meaning of this language was based solely on his experience working in the
music business “for 30 years” and his impression of what others in the business “thinks” it
means. 1 Id. at 114:19-115:18.
b. Testimony of Marnie Nieves
In 1998, Marnie Nieves was an associate at Mr. Paterno’s firm and assisted him in
negotiating the 1998 Agreement. Guilford Decl. Ex. B, Deposition of Marnie Nieves (“Nieves
Dep.”) at 40:11-19. Ms. Nieves later left Paterno’s firm and had no involvement in negotiating
the 2003 Agreement. Id. at 18:10-16. In her deposition, Ms. Nieves testified she did not recall
the specifics of any conversations she had with F.B.T.’s representatives in the course of
negotiating the 1998 Agreement. Nieves Dep. at 15:21-16:18. She recalled nothing except that
she had some conversations and transmitted some documents back and forth; nothing more. Id.
at 17:5-9. She recalls nothing about conversations regarding the controlled composition clause.
Id. 20:12-19, 44:4-18.
Despite this void in her recollection, Ms. Nieves went on give her understanding of the
meaning and operation of the “Mechanical Royalties” paragraph in the 1998 Agreement,
maintaining its operation “is the same” as in clauses with different wording, and stating she
believed the provision in question applied to “the distribution of records,” despite not knowing if
it even contemplated permanent downloads. Id. at 109:8-19, 110:8-111:4. Defendants have
designated precisely these portions of Ms. Nieves testimony, indicating they intend to play them
for the Court at trial. Doc. No. 136 at 197.
1

Defendants have designated Mr. Paterno as an expert witness on this subject as well. Plaintiffs are separately
moving to exclude Mr. Paterno’s “expert” opinion as unqualified, among other reasons.

3

c. Testimony of Rand HoffmanMr. Hoffman began working for Interscope in early 1999, after the 1998 Agreement was
signed, and had no involvement with the drafting and negotiation of that agreement. Guilford
Decl. Ex. C, Deposition of Rand Hoffman dated May 28, 2008 (“Hoffman Dep.”) at 21:25-22:6,
29:5-9. Mr. Hoffman was, however, one of the primary negotiators of the 2003 Agreement,
along with Lisa Rogell. Id. at 46:23-47:2. Ms. Rogell “did the drafting” and Mr. Hoffman
“reviewed the drafts.”

Id. at 51:3-7.

Although Mr. Hoffman testified that he had some

conversations with F.B.T. and Eminem’s representatives, he did not recall any conversations
about the meaning of the language that is key to this case, “will be licensed to Aftermath and its
distributors/licensees,” nor was he involved in any way drafting that clause. Id. at 51:8-13,
112:7-21. Mr. Hoffman also testified that his entire understanding of the clause was based on
having “seen many controlled composition clauses” and “knowing” Mr. Paterno and the
representatives of Plaintiffs. Id. at 112:23-114:25.
Elsewhere in his deposition, Mr. Hoffman testified as to his unexpressed understanding
of this provision. For example, he testified as to his impression of what the language of the
“Mechanical Royalties” paragraph “seems to say,” id. at 107:25-108:1, and his opinion regarding
the language of the paragraph in the 1998 Agreement versus the language used in other
agreements. Id. at 110:14-22. Despite not recalling any conversations on this subject, Mr.
Hoffman also offered his opinion that the parties “contemplated” that permanent downloads
would be covered by the “Mechanical Royalties” provision, basing this on what “everybody in
1998 was familiar with.” Id. at 192:17-193:7. Defendants have not designated any of Mr.
Hoffman’s deposition testimony for use at trial, presumably because they have listed him as a

4

witness they intend to call in person at trial. Doc. No. 136 at 43-44.
d. Testimony of Lisa Rogell
Lisa Rogell was an attorney at Interscope Records who worked with Mr. Hoffman in
drafting the 2003 Agreement. Guilford Decl. Ex. D, Deposition of Lisa Rogell (“Rogell Dep.”)
at 123:7-24. Ms. Rogell testified she did not recall any discussion about the wording of the
portion of the “Mechanical Royalties” paragraph described above and does not recall who
suggested the language that made its way into the agreement. Rogell Dep. at 70:14-71:2.
Like the other witnesses described above, despite recalling no conversations with
F.B.T.’s representatives concerning the language of the “Mechanical Royalties” provision, or its
prospective application, Ms. Rogell offered her opinion about its meaning and effect. For
example, Ms. Rogell testified she “thought” the provision was “self-effectuating” (i.e., did not
require that subsequent licenses be entered into between the parties). Rogell Dep. at 66:2068:15.
III.

ARGUMENT
Under California law and statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of

the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. Cal. Civ. Code, § 1636
(2009). This is first ascertained from the contract and the 'clear and explicit' meaning of contract
provisions, interpreted in their 'ordinary and popular sense,' unless 'used by the parties in a
technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage', controls judicial interpretation.
Id., §§ 1636-38, 1644. “Where the language of a contract is clear and not absurd, it will be
followed,” and the Court goes no further than that language. Cal. Civ. Code § 1638; Shaw v.
Regents of University of California, 58 Cal. App. 4th 44, 53 (Cal. App. 3d Dist. 1997). Extrinsic

5

evidence is not admissible if it is offered to prove a meaning to which the language of the
contract is not “reasonably susceptible.” Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage etc.
Co., 69 Cal. 2d 33, 37 (Cal. 1968). Thus, extrinsic evidence offered in an attempt to depart from
the unambiguous language of a contract is not admissible. Weisenburg v. Thomas, 9 Cal. App.
3d 961, 965 (Cal. App. 1st Dist. 1970) (trial court committed reversible error in admitting
extrinsic evidence “that varied or contradicted the terms of the written contracts” and then basing
material findings of fact on such improperly admitted evidence); see also Am. Star Ins. Co. v.
Ins. Co. of the W., 232 Cal. App. 3d 1320, 1331 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 1991) (evidence of intent
unavailing against the plain language of a contract).
It is black letter law that a contracting party’s undisclosed, subjective intent, such as that
testified to by all four witnesses described above, is irrelevant to and therefore inadmissible to
prove the objective meaning of that contract’s terms. See, e.g., Reigelsperger v. Siller, 40 Cal.
4th 574, 579-80 (2007) (California Supreme Court held that a party’s intention as to whether or
not they would seek further services under a contract was irrelevant, inadmissible, and could not
be considered as evidence to relieve their contractual obligation to submit to the arbitration terms
in the contract) General Motors v. Superior Court, 12 Cal. App. 4th 435, 442 (1993); Berman v.
Bromberg, 56 Cal. App. 4th 936, 948 (1997); Houghton v. Kerr Glass Mfg. Corp., 261 Cal. App.
2d 530, 537 (1968). The subjective, unexpressed intent of a party is immaterial to a contract’s
meaning and therefore “entirely inadmissible to show the meaning of the contract.” Ribiero v.
Dotson, 187 Cal. App. 2d 819, 821 (1960); see also Alex Robertson Co. v. Imperial Casualty &
Indemnity Co., 8 Cal. App. 4th 338, 346 (1992). Under California law, “mutual consent is
gathered from the reasonable meaning of the words and acts of the parties, and not from their

6

unexpressed intentions or understanding.”

Reigelsperger,, 40 Cal. 4th at 579-80 (citing 1

Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005 Contracts § 116, p. 155)).To the extent that at the
time the Recording Agreements were signed any of these witnesses had such subjective
unexpressed intent or understanding with respect to the Mechanical Royalties paragraph as set
forth in their deposition, such “intent” or “understanding” was uncommunicated and immaterial
to the contract’s meaning.
Each of the four witnesses identified above testified they had no recollections of any
conversations concerning the “Mechanical Royalties” paragraph, specifically the portion at issue
herein. Each witness’s alleged understanding of that clause is thus wholly irrelevant to the
Court’s interpretation of that provision and should be excluded as a matter of law.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons described above, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion and exclude

the testimony of Ms. Nieves, Ms. Rogell, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Paterno as to their unexpressed
understanding of the meaning of the “Mechanical Royalties” provision of the 1998 and 2003
Recording Agreements.
