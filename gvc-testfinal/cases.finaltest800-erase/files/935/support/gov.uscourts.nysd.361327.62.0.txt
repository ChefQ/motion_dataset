10 Civ. 3105 (FM)

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
Defendant Gary Locke, Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce
(“Census” or the “Government”), by and through his attorney, Preet Bharara, United States
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, respectfully submits this memorandum in
support of his motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant
to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiffs allege that Census’ policies and practices governing temporary hiring for the
2010 Decennial Census have had a discriminatory impact on them in violation of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. (“Title VII”). Notwithstanding that the
challenged policies and practices are no longer in force, that the policies and practices that will
govern future Decennial hiring have not yet been formulated, and that temporary hiring for the
2020 Decennial is years away, Plaintiffs nevertheless contend they are entitled to prospective
equitable relief, including an injunction requiring Census to employ “Uniform Guidelines for

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 7 of 28

Employee Selection Procedures and related EEOC Guidance” in future hiring. (See First Am.
Compl. ¶ 130). They are wrong. Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs lack standing to seek
injunctive or declaratory relief.
Pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff seeking injunctive or
declaratory relief must show both the existence of an official policy, and a likelihood of “real and
immediate” future harm through application of that policy. Plaintiffs cannot show either. First,
the policies and practices they challenge in this lawsuit have expired: no individual will ever
again be subject to those policies. Second, Census’ development of policies and practices to
govern temporary hiring for the 2020 Decennial is in its infancy. These future policies and
practices are expected to differ substantially from those at issue here. Third, Plaintiffs fail to
allege that they will again apply for a Decennial position with Census, and thus cannot show they
will be subject to any of Census’ temporary hiring policies and practices in the future. And
finally, any attempt by Plaintiffs to save their claims for injunctive and declaratory relief by
relying upon non-Decennial positions must fail: no Plaintiff has ever applied for a non-Decennial
field position, and their assumption that the background screening policies governing nonDecennial hiring are the same or even similar to those governing Decennial hiring is wrong.
Indeed, under these circumstances, no individual – let alone any of the Plaintiffs – faces a
“real and immediate” threat that they will again suffer the same injuries from application of any
of Census’ hiring policies and practices, as is necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief must be dismissed pursuant
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).
For all these reasons, as elaborated below, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for
2

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 8 of 28

injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.1
BACKGROUND
I.

Plaintiffs’ Claims for Relief
In addition to seeking lost wages and benefits for their disparate impact claim, Plaintiffs

also seek prospective equitable relief, including an injunction prohibiting Census from engaging
in the policies and practices described in the First Amended Complaint “consistent with the less
discriminatory alternatives” proposed by Plaintiffs (Compl. ¶ 129), an injunction mandating that
Census implement certain policies and practices with respect to temporary employment (id. ¶
130), and a declaration that the polices and practices described in the First Amended Complaint
are unlawful and violate Title VII (id. ¶ 128). As all temporary positions associated with the
2010 Decennial have expired, Plaintiffs no longer seek injunctive relief with respect to the 2010
Decennial. (See id. ¶ 131).
II.

Census’s Decennial Operations
A.

Relevant Policies and Practices Governing the 2010 Decennial

The Census Bureau is charged by the Constitution and statute to conduct the Census of
Housing and Population, known as the Decennial. To conduct the 2010 Decennial, Census hired

1

Census’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief is
directed to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (hereinafter “Complaint”), which is the
operative complaint in this matter. As the Court is aware, however, Plaintiffs have filed a motion
to further amend their Complaint. That motion and its eventual resolution do not affect Census’s
motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, because Plaintiffs
request precisely the same prospective equitable relief in their proposed Second Amended
Complaint. Thus, any ruling on this motion would apply with equal force to the proposed
Second Amended Complaint.

over one million temporary workers, all of whom were required, pursuant to Executive Order
10,450, to undergo background checks.
Census’s Census Hiring and Employment Check (“CHEC”) Office was responsible for
conducting background checks of applicants. (See Declaration of Sandra Patterson, Assistant
Division Chief for the CHEC Office, dated June 28, 2011, (“Patterson Decl.”) ¶ 1). To
accomplish this, the CHEC Office submitted applicants’ biographical information to the FBI.
(Id. ¶ 2). The FBI, in turn, conducted an electronic search against its Criminal Justice
Information Services Division’s criminal database, and reported any tentative matches to CHEC.
(Id. ¶ 2; see also id. ¶ 3).
Applicants whose personal identifiers matched those contained in the FBI’s criminal
history record, and whose identified crimes could potentially be disqualifying for Decennial
work, were sent a letter (the “30-day letter”) from CHEC providing them with the opportunity to
dispute identification by submitting their fingerprints or, if there was no issue of
misidentification, to provide official court documentation concerning the disposition of their
criminal history. (Id. ¶ 3; see also Compl. ¶ 15). CHEC also employed a matrix of adjudication
guidelines to determine who ultimately is suitable for hire, based on criminal history (the
“adjudication criteria”). (See Declaration of Tara M. La Morte, dated June 28, 2011, Ex. 1; see
also Compl. ¶¶ 22-27).
CHEC “is no longer applying its policies and practices used to determine the suitability of
applicants for . . . the 2010 Decennial.” (Patterson Decl. ¶ 5). In fact, CHEC ceased sending 30day letters to 2010 Decennial applicants on July 31, 2010 (id. ¶ 6), and is no longer adjudicating
the criminal histories of any applicants (id. ¶ 8).

Development of Relevant Policies and Practices For the 2020 Decennial

While the basic design of the Decennial Census has remained fairly consistent since
1970, Census operations have become increasingly expensive, as Census has been forced to hire
additional personnel to knock on doors of residents who fail to respond to the mailed written
questionnaire. (See Declaration of Frank Vitrano, Associate Director for 2020 Census, dated
June 27, 2011, (“Vitrano Decl.”) ¶¶ 4, 5). Accordingly, as explained by Associate Director
Vitrano, who is responsible for overseeing the planning for the 2020 Decennial, Census is
examining alternative designs to conduct operations more efficiently, as well as alternative
methods for the public to respond to the questionnaire, including internet and telephone response
options. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 7).
Significantly, Census is not scheduled to determine these preliminary design alternatives
until 2015, when the agency submits its Fiscal Year 2015 budget to Congress. (Id. ¶ 8). At that
time, Census will begin operational development and systems testing for the activities associated
with implementation of the 2020 Decennial. (Id.). Thus, for example, the procedures and
systems needed to implement mail, internet, and telephone data collection will be developed and
tested beginning 2015. (Id.).
Accordingly, the development of basic administrative functions, including the
development of background screening policies, will not begin until 2015. (Id. ¶¶ 8-11; see also
Patterson Decl. ¶ 9). As Associate Director Vitrano explains, “early operational development
will supply key information needed to conduct the 2020 Census,” and may impact the number
and types of positions that would need to be filled. (Vitrano Decl. ¶ 9). Moreover, the
development of background screening policies “depend[s] heavily on knowing how . . . the
5

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 11 of 28

agency plan[s] to conduct the Decennial Census.” (Id. ¶ 11).
Other factors will also affect the scope and nature of background screening policies and
procedures for the 2020 Decennial. For example, the CHEC Office is monitoring federal
guidelines and regulations that will impact federal background checks, such as Homeland
Security Presidential Directive 12 (“HSPD-12”). (See Patterson Decl. ¶ 10). HSPD-12 imposes,
among other things, heightened background check requirements on any federal employee who
will have access to federal electronic systems. (Id.).
In light of Census’s anticipated substantial changes in operations and the need to
incorporate new federal requirements concerning background check processes, the CHEC Office
expects to have a different background screening process for whatever group of 2020 Decennial
employees Census decides to employ. (Id. ¶¶ 13, 14).
III.

Census’s Non-Decennial Operations and Background Screening Procedures
There are other positions at the Census Bureau that are subject to other application,

background check, and hiring processes. The Census Bureau also hires, through a wholly
different process, other employees to carry out the Bureau’s ongoing “non-Decennial”
operations, which include, for example, the Current Population Survey and the American
Community Survey. (See Patterson Decl. ¶ 16). These are continuing surveys. (See Declaration
of Viola Lewis Willis, Chief, Decennial Administrative Branch, dated June 27, 2011, (“Willis
Decl.”) ¶¶ 2, 5). Census also conducts one-time surveys between Decennials. (Id. ¶ 2).
Most employees hired for non-Decennial field operations are hired on indefinite

6

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 12 of 28

appointments. (Id. ¶ 5).2 In contrast, all Decennial field employees are hired on a temporary
basis. (Id. ¶ 6).
There are other differences between the field positions of Decennial and non-Decennial
employees. Unlike Decennial enumerators, non-Decennial Field Representatives have broader
responsibilities, including the use of laptop computers to ask survey questions and enter
responses and, for some surveys, the authority to issue reimbursements to survey responders and
pay for translator services. (Id. ¶¶ 3, 4, 6).
In light of the differences in the scope and nature of non-Decennial and Decennial
operations, the background check processes for non-Decennial operations are “fundamentally
different” than the background check process employed for the Decennial. (Patterson Decl. ¶
16).
As an initial matter, the background check screening of an applicant for a non-Decennial
position does not occur until after the relevant Regional Office makes a conditional offer of
employment to the applicant. (Id. ¶ 17). At that time, CHEC reviews information submitted by
the applicant and reports any inconsistencies to the Regional Director, as well as facts about the
applicant’s criminal, employment, and or educational record. (Id. ¶¶ 17, 18).
Unlike hiring for Decennial operations, it is the Regional Director – not CHEC – that is
responsible for making a suitability determination. (Id. ¶¶ 17, 18). Accordingly, CHEC does not
apply the “adjudication criteria” that were used for the 2010 Decennial. (Id. ¶ 18). Nor does the
non-Decennial hiring process include the use of a 30-day letter. (Id. ¶ 21).

2

The Census Bureau may hire employees on a temporary basis in connection with a onetime survey, which usually takes between six and nine months to complete. (Id.).
7

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 13 of 28

After an employee is hired, further background screening is conducted by the Office of
Personnel and Management, an independent federal agency. (Id. ¶ 20). The Office of Personnel
and Management sends the results of its investigation to the Census Bureau. (Id.).

General Standing Doctrine

Pursuant to Article III of the Constitution, the judicial power of the United States is
limited “to the resolution of ‘cases’ and ‘controversies.’” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). Standing
doctrine is one of several doctrines designed to effectuate Article III’s case or controversy
requirement. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). Broadly speaking,
standing requires a litigant to demonstrate a sufficient “personal stake in the outcome of the
controversy . . . to justify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on [his or her] behalf.” Warth
v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-99 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, standing is a

of a case, Pettus v. Morgenthau, 554 F.3d 293, 298 (2d Cir. 2009), Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(1) is an appropriate mechanism for challenging a litigant’s constitutional
standing to bring a claim, Alliance for Env’tl Renewal v. Pyramid Crossgates Co., 436 F.3d 82,

under Rule 12(b)(1), a district court may, if necessary, refer to evidence outside the pleadings.

“built on a single basic idea – the idea of separation of powers.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,
752 (1984). Allowing the judiciary to “oversee legislative or executive action” when
unnecessary to protect a complainant’s concrete interests would “significantly alter the allocation
of power away from a democratic form of government.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S.
488, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1149 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
To meet “the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, a
party invoking federal jurisdiction must allege the following three elements: (1) an “injury in fact
– an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b)
actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” id. at 560 (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted); (2) that the injury is “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the
defendant,” id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); and (3) that it is “likely, as
opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision,” id. at
561 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
2.

Standing to Maintain Claims for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

A plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating standing separately for each form of relief
sought. See Donahue v. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 116 (1st Cir. 2002). In seeking injunctive
and declaratory relief, a plaintiff must show a likelihood of encountering the same injury again in
the immediate future – otherwise there is no impending threat of injury in fact, and no remedial
benefit to be achieved from entry of a prospective judicial decree. See Summers, 129 S. Ct. at
1149; City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102-105 (1983) (injunctive relief); Golden v.
Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 108-09 (1969) (declaratory judgment).
The Supreme Court’s decision in City of Los Angeles v. Lyons is the seminal case on the
9

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 15 of 28

issue of litigants’ standing to seek equitable relief. In Lyons, the plaintiff alleged that he was
injured during a routine traffic stop by several Los Angeles police officers who, without
provocation, applied a chokehold to him. In addition to seeking damages, the plaintiff sought to
enjoin police officers’ use of chokeholds absent a threat of deadly force. The Supreme Court
held that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective relief, however, because while he “may
have been illegally choked by the police,” 461 U.S. at 105, that fact did nothing to establish a
“sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way,” id. at 111.
Thus, Lyons firmly established that a plaintiff lacks standing to sue for injunctive relief
based on allegations of “‘[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct.’” Id. at 102 (quoting O’Shea v.
Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974) (holding that class of plaintiffs claiming discriminatory
enforcement of criminal law did not allege case or controversy based on past harms from the
alleged unconstitutional practices)). Rather, he must show a “real and immediate threat” that he
will suffer the same injury in the future, to assure that the court does not entertain a suit based on
speculative or hypothetical harms. Id. at 105, 111. “[P]ast wrongs do not in themselves amount
to that real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make out a case or controversy.” Id. at
103.
Following Lyons, the Second Circuit has instructed that “a plaintiff seeking injunctive
relief must demonstrate both a likelihood of future harm and the existence of an official policy or
its equivalent.” Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 216 (2d Cir. 2004) (emphasis in original). Thus,
to maintain a claim for declaratory or injunctive relief, not only must a plaintiff show the
existence of an official policy sanctioning the alleged illegality, but she must also show that she
will be affected by the implementation of that policy in the future. Shain, 356 F.3d at 214, 216;
10

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 16 of 28

Clarry v. United States, 85 F.3d 1041, 1049 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that plaintiffs could not
maintain claim for injunction as to a repealed policy); see also Zwickler, 394 U.S. at 108-09
(reversing entry of declaratory judgment as to constitutionality of statute; although previously
convicted under statute, it was “most unlikely” Zwickler would again be subject to statute so as
to present a case or controversy of “sufficient immediacy and reality”). With respect to the latter
requirement, the Second Circuit warned that a plaintiff “cannot rely on past injury to satisfy the
injury requirement but must show a likelihood that he . . . will be injured in the future.” Shain,
356 F.3d at 215 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, the future threat of injury
“must be both ‘real and immediate,’ not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” Id. at 215 (quoting
O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 494; Zwickler, 394 U.S. at 110).
Finally, it is well-established that a litigant cannot challenge a policy or practice to which
he has not submitted. See Jackson-Bey v. Hanslmaier, 115 F.3d 1091, 1096 (2d Cir. 1997)
(citing cases).
As shown below (as in these cases), Plaintiffs’ allegations fall decisively short of
establishing the immediate threat of harm required to sue for declaratory and injunctive relief.4
4

Insofar as Plaintiffs seek prospective relief designed to shape the background screening
policies that will govern future Decennials, principles of standing supply the proper rubric to
analyze their claims. (See Compl. ¶¶ 129-131); E.g., Clarry, 85 F.3d at 1049. However, even if
Plaintiffs’ request for a declaration that the policies and practices they challenge are unlawful
(see Compl. ¶ 128), is analyzed under principles of mootness, the outcome is the same because,
as described below, the policies and practices they challenge are no longer in existence. See, e.g.,
Worth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d 854, 860-61 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding moot plaintiff’s request for an
injunction as to an agency policy that was repealed). Indeed, mootness is often described as
ensuring that a litigant maintains standing throughout the life of the lawsuit. See, e.g., Cook v.
Colgate Univ., 992 F.2d 17 (2d Cir. 1993); see also Catanzano v. Wing, 277 F.3d 99, 107 (2d
Cir. 2001) (“The mootness doctrine, which is mandated by the ‘case or controversy’ requirement
in Article III of the United States Constitution, requires that federal courts may not adjudicate
matters that no longer present an actual dispute between parties.” (citation omitted));

Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate the Existence of an Official Policy Sanctioning
the Conduct About Which They Complain, Nor Show Any Probability of
Future Injury

Plaintiffs cannot meet the stringent reasonableness standards necessary for future-injury
standing. Specifically, as discussed below, neither Plaintiffs – nor any other individual – will
ever again be subject to the challenged policies and practices. And beyond observing that the
relevant policies for the 2020 Decennial are likely to vary significantly, any further description of
those policies and practices would be speculative. Finally, Plaintiffs cannot credibly assert any
concrete plan to apply for the next Decennial, and any supposed interest in non-Decennial
positions is irrelevant. Under these circumstances, whether considered singly or in combination,
Plaintiffs simply do not face a “real and immediate threat” of future injury, as is necessary to
invoke the Court’s jurisdiction to obtain prospective equitable relief.
1.

The Challenged Policies and Practices Have Terminated

First, although Plaintiffs describe in detail the policies and practices purportedly
employed by Census in connection with the 2010 Decennial, it cannot be disputed that those
policies and practices are no longer in force. (See Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 5-8). Indeed, the last
appointments that were subject to the challenged policies and practices expired on June 18, 2011.
(Id. ¶ 7).

Blackwelder v. Safnauer, 866 F.2d 548, 550 (2d Cir. 1989) (observing that a claim becomes moot
“when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’”); The People of the Village of Gambell
v.Babbitt, 999 F.2d 403, 406 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding moot claims for equitable relief with
respect to sale of oil and gas exploration leases after sale completed and leases relinquished).
Notably, Plaintiffs acknowledge that equitable claims – other than backpay – with respect to the
2010 Decennial are no longer viable in light of the fact that the 2010 Decennial has concluded, as
evidenced by their decision to drop their claim to be restored as eligible applicants or employees.
(See Compl. ¶¶ 131-32).
12

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Plaintiffs may argue that their Complaint is also intended to encompass Census’s
supposed use of the challenged screening policies and practices in connection with nonDecennial hiring. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ conjecture, however, the policies and procedures
governing hiring and background checks for non-Decennial positions – positions for which they
never applied – are dramatically and materially different. As an initial matter, the initial and
final screening determinations for non-Decennial positions are not even made by Census’s
“CHEC” Office, which made background screening determinations for the 2010 Decennial.
(Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 18, 20). Rather, an entirely separate, independent agency – the Office of
Personnel and Management – conducts the final background check process. (Id. ¶ 20). Census’s
CHEC Office merely provides background information and reports any inconsistencies
concerning the information submitted by the applicant to the relevant Regional Directors of
Census Regional Offices, who are then responsible for making an initial suitability
determination. (Id. ¶¶ 17-19). Indeed, the policies and practices about which Plaintiffs complain
do not apply to non-Decennial hiring. Unlike the 2010 Decennial positions at issue in their
Complaint, there are no “30-day letters” (See Compl. ¶ 15) or “adjudication criteria” (see id. ¶¶
22-28) used in screening for non-Decennial positions. (See Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 16-22). Thus, any
supposed intent to apply for a non-Decennial position cannot supply standing to obtain injunctive
and declaratory relief regarding different policies and practices applicable to Decennial hiring.
See, e.g., Jackson-Bey, 115 F.3d 1091 (2d Cir. 1997) (citing cases including Doe v. Blum, 729
F.2d 186, 189-90 (2d Cir. 1984) (denying standing to plaintiffs – sexually active teenagers – who
never applied for and therefore were never denied desired family planning benefits)).
Accordingly, Plaintiffs face no likelihood of future injury from the policies and practices
13

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 19 of 28

they assert in their Complaint, and simply cannot rely on them as a basis to obtain an injunction
or declaratory judgment. See Shain, 356 F.3d at 215 (instructing that a plaintiff “cannot rely on
past injury to satisfy the injury requirement but must show a likelihood that he . . . will be injured
in the future”). On this point, the Second Circuit’s decision in Clarry is instructive. There,
former air traffic controllers who had been terminated for participating in a nationwide strike
sought a declaratory judgment and injunction against the FAA’s policy of inserting into its
contracts with private companies a prohibition against the employment of the strikers. 85 F.3d at
1049. However, because the policy had been repealed “before the plaintiffs filed their amended
complaint . . . . neither a declaratory judgment . . . nor an injunction prohibiting the FAA from
enforcing the policy would benefit the plaintiffs in any way.” Id. The Circuit thus held that the
plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the claim. Id. The same result pertains here.
2.

The Policies and Practices That Will Govern Employment Screening
for the 2020 Decennial Will Not Be Developed for Several Years, and
Are Likely to Be Materially Different

Nor does anything in Plaintiffs’ Complaint suggest any reasonable likelihood that Census
will institute policies and practices that are substantially similar to those challenged here, further
undermining any claim of immediate future harm.5 In fact, the record indicates that future
background screening policies are likely to change dramatically, and shows that any more
specific forecast as to what the policies may be would be speculative.
As the Vitrano Declaration explains, operational planning for the next Decennial – while
underway – is in its early stages. Indeed, Census is not scheduled to determine preliminary
5

Even if Census’ future criteria for temporary hiring were developed, any challenges to
those criteria would not be ripe, as the next period of temporary hiring will not occur for multiple
years. See infra Part II; (See Patterson Decl. ¶ 9; Vitrano Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10-11).
14

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 20 of 28

design alternatives, including, e.g., providing the public with alternative methods to respond to
the Census questionnaire, until 2015. (Vitrano Decl. ¶¶ 7-8). It is only at that time that Census
will begin conducting operational development and systems testing (id. ¶ 8), which, in turn, “will
supply key information necessary in determining the number and type of positions needed to
conduct the 2020 Census (id. ¶ 9). As a result, secondary research and development, which
includes the examination and development of background screening policies, will not occur until
sometime after 2015. (Id. ¶¶ 8, 10-11). As Vitrano, the Associate Director for the 2020 Census,
explains, “[m]ost of the activities included in the secondary research, including the development
of background screening policies, depend heavily on knowing how we plan to actually conduct
the Decennial Census.” (Id. ¶ 11).
In addition to these operational factors, other considerations also will affect the
development of future screening policies. Census is currently reviewing and monitoring new
federal mandates regarding federal background checks, including, for example, heightened
background check requirements imposed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12. (See
Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 10-13). As a result, Census “will likely make major changes for the 2020
Decennial.” (Id. ¶ 14).
Accordingly, Census’s development of screening and hiring policies for the next
Decennial is years away. In light of the operational development that must be done and new
legal requirements to incorporate, it is simply impossible to intelligently predict what policies
and practices Census might choose to adopt in connection with its future temporary hiring.
Notwithstanding the multitude of changing factors that will impact the timing and
substance of screening policies for the next Decennial, Plaintiffs may argue that Census is likely
15

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 21 of 28

to employ a similar screening process in the future, on the basis that the agency used similar
processes in connection with the 2000 Decennial. That argument, however, must be rejected.
Not only is it factually inaccurate, but it is belied by the experiences of several of the individual
and proposed Plaintiffs, as alleged in their Complaints. For example, Plaintiff Evelyn Houser
previously worked for the Census in 1990 (Compl. ¶ 54). Proposed Plaintiff Scotty Desphy was
hired as a temporary worker during the 2000 Decennial (see Proposed SAC ¶ 109), and Proposed
Plaintiff Chynell Scott has also worked for Census in the past (id. ¶ 96). Indeed, Plaintiffs allege
that Census changed its adjudication criteria in the midst of the 2010 Decennial. (Compl. ¶ 25).
Plaintiffs’ experiences are revealing: in fact, Census has changed its background check processes
from one Decennial to the next. (See Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 14-15). As an example of one
significant change, CHEC’s Assistant Division Chief lists the inclusion of the fingerprinting
component in the 2010 Decennial – a change that was not instituted until 2008. (Id. ¶ 15).
For these additional reasons, Plaintiffs lack standing to obtain prospective equitable
relief. Courts facing similar challenges to underdeveloped or non-final agency policies have
concluded likewise. In Worth v. Jackson, for instance, a HUD employee brought a Title VII
action challenging certain unwritten policies and practices that HUD had allegedly put into place
after repealing an official affirmative action plan. 451 F.3d 854, 855-56 (D.C. Cir. 2006).
Notwithstanding that HUD’s prior policy had expressly taken race and gender into account in
employment decisions, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the plaintiff lacked
standing to obtain prospective relief with respect to his claim that HUD would continue to do so.
Absent any written directive or policy, the plaintiff’s claim was speculative: “Thus, [w]hile there
is, of course, some chance that somewhere, at some time, [plaintiff] may again be exposed to a
16

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 22 of 28

prospective injury, that possibility seems to us far too remote and attenuated to establish a case or
controversy under Article III.” Id. at 860 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in
original); see also Feliciano v. Romney, 336 F. Supp. 1340, 1344-46 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (holding
that tenants’ request for an injunction against HUD concerning renewal project that may violate
federal legal requirements was nonjusticiable; although HUD approved guidelines for plan and
issued letters of consent, it had not yet made a firm financial commitment to the project).
3.

Plaintiffs’ Willingness to Perform Temporary Work or Non-Decennial
Work Is Insufficient to Create a “Real and Immediate” Likelihood of
Future Harm

Finally, although Plaintiffs have alleged a willingness to engage in temporary work, none
could credibly allege concrete plans to apply for the 2020 Decennial, as the associated hiring
process is undeniably in the far distant future. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 108. As such, Plaintiffs face
no immediate threat of encountering Census’ decennial hiring policies and practices – whatever
they may be – and thus, for this separate and independent reason, cannot establish the predicate
necessary to justify implementation of injunctive or declaratory remedies.
As an initial matter, Plaintiffs’ claims that they are “ready, willing, and able” to work for
Census if offered a “temporary position” is insufficient to confer standing. (See Compl. ¶¶ 58,
52, 68, 73, 78, 86). In Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, the Supreme Court held that “[s]uch ‘some
day’ intentions – without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of
when the some day will be – do not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ injury that our
cases require.” 504 U.S. at 564; see also Worth, 451 F.3d at 858 (holding Title VII plaintiff’s
“assertion that he ‘intends to apply for new positions and promotions at HUD on a regular basis
in the future’ is just the kind of speculative intention normally insufficient for standing
17

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 23 of 28

purposes”); see also Shain, 356 F.3d at 213, 216 (noting that plaintiff did not aver that he might
again be subject to the policy, and that inferences required to establish a sufficient likelihood of
future injury were too speculative); Town of Bethel v. Howard, 198 F.3d 235, *2 (2d Cir. 1999)
(holding that plaintiff’s failure to assert “plans (let alone concrete ones)” to engage in activity,
along with other factors, rendered case non-justiciable).
In any event, Plaintiffs cannot assert any “concrete plans” that would subject them to the
challenged policies and practices or any similar policies, given that those policies and practices
are no longer in effect and that screening processes for future Decennial positions are
nonexistent. See supra Parts I.B.1, I.B.2; Worth, 451 F.3d at 860; Clarry, 85 F.3d at 1049.
Nor can Plaintiffs manufacture standing through expressing an interest in non-Decennial
positions. As described above, the entire hiring structure, including background screening
policies and practices that apply to non-Decennial positions are materially different than those to
which Plaintiffs were previously subject. See supra Background & Part I.B.1. Thus, Plaintiffs
cannot point to those policies to show that they face a “real and immediate” threat of suffering
the same injury, which is a necessary prerequisite of equitable standing. Shain, 356 F.3d at 216
(mere existence of a policy is not sufficient to confer standing, even if individual was previously
subject to that policy; a showing of future harm is required). Moreover, none of the Plaintiffs (or
proposed Plaintiffs) ever applied for non-Decennial field positions, and thus have never suffered
any injury or adverse action as a result of those policies. (See Willis Decl. ¶¶ 7-12); see
Fitzgerald v. Thompson, 353 Fed. App’x 532, 535 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that failure to submit
application deprived plaintiffs of standing to challenge access); Jackson-Bey, 115 F.3d at 1096
(noting that plaintiff must actually submit to challenged policy to establish standing, and citing
18

Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 62

Filed 06/28/11 Page 24 of 28

cases); Clarry, 85 F.3d at 1050 (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge FAA
employment policy because they did not apply for requisite position). Simply put, any claim
based on non-Decennial policies would have to be exhausted through the administrative process
by the timely filing of a separate complaint in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1614, which could
ultimately become the subject of a separate lawsuit.
As such, Plaintiffs lack any present or probable future relevant connection to any
Decennial Census, and cannot demonstrate that absent injunctive and declaratory relief, injury
would “proceed with a high degree of immediacy.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2 (noting that a
plaintiff’s “mere profession of an intent” or allegation of injury “at some indefinite future time”
is insufficient to confer standing). Thus, for this additional reason, there is no basis in the
Complaint to conclude that any injury is “certainly impending,” as Article III requires. Lujan,
504 U.S. at 564-65 & n.2 (internal quotation marks omitted).

As to their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief, Plaintiffs are unable to take their
suit outside the realm of the hypothetical. Far from facing a “likelihood of substantial and
immediate irreparable injury” Lyons, 461 U.S. at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted), the
likelihood of future harm from the complained-of policies and practices here is essentially zero.6
Nor can Plaintiffs show how an injunction or declaratory judgment would redress their alleged
injuries. In the absence of these jurisdictional requirements, Plaintiffs claims for declaratory and
injunctive relief must be dismissed. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 109; id. at 105-06; Zwickler, 394
6

Of course, as in Lyons, Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law. See 461 U.S. at 111
(“The legality of the violence to which Lyons claims he was once subjected is at issue in his suit
for damages and can be determined there.”).

credibly a realistic threat from the policy.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).7
II.

Plaintiffs’ Claims for Prospective Injunctive Relief Are Not Ripe for Review
Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief regarding future Decennials fail for an additional

reason: they are not ripe for judicial review. Absent a concrete dispute concerning Census’
hiring decisions for the 2020 Decennial, judicial review of Census’ future hiring policies and
practices is premature.
Like standing, ripeness is a justiciability doctrine rooted in Article III. It is designed to
“‘prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in
abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial
7

That Plaintiffs sought to bring this action on behalf of a putative class is irrelevant. As
an initial matter, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ class claims. (See Op. & Order dated Mar. 14,
2011). But even if the Complaint included viable class allegations (and per the Court’s order, it
does not), “[a] class action allegation adds nothing to the standing inquiry since the named
plaintiffs must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been
suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport
to represent.” Carver v. City of New York, 621 F.3d 221, 228 n.6 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Dickerson v. Feldman, 426 F. Supp. 2d 130, (S.D.N.Y. 2006)
(citing Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care,
433 F.3d 181, 198 (2d Cir. 2005)); Does I Through III v. District of Columbia, 216 F.R.D. 5, 9
(D.D.C. 2003) (“[S]tanding and entitlement to equitable relief are threshold jurisdictional
requirements that must be satisfied prior to the certification of a class.” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Moreover, in this case, no member of the putative class as described in either
Plaintiffs’ Complaint or proposed Second Amended Complaint has standing to obtain injunctive
and declaratory relief.

interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete
way by the challenging parties.’” Connecticut v. Duncan, 612 F.3d 107, 112 (2d Cir. 2010)
(quoting Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. Dep’t of the Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-08 (2003)); see
also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 n.10 (1975) (“The standing question thus bears close
affinity to questions of ripeness-whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to warrant
judicial intervention-and of mootness-whether the occasion for judicial intervention persists.”).
Courts determine whether a case is ripe for review by examining (1) whether the issues presented
are fit for judicial review, and (2) what hardship the parties will suffer in the absence of review.
Duncan, 612 F.3d at 113 (citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967),
overruled on other grounds, Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977)).
In this case, an examination of both prongs of the ripeness inquiry reveals that Plaintiffs’
claims for injunctive relief are not justiciable. First, as these claims target future Decennial
screening policies and practices that have not yet been developed, see supra Part I.B.2, they are
not presently “fit” for judicial review. See Nevada v. Dep’t of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 84 (D.C. Cir.
2006) (observing that ripeness doctrine is intended in part to protect “the agency’s interest in
crystallizing its policy before that policy is subjected to judicial review” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Indeed, any judicial decisionmaking concerning Census’ theoretical future
policies and practices would necessarily be based on an incomplete, speculative, and
undeveloped record. Under these circumstances, judicial involvement is plainly premature. See,
e.g., Worth, 451 F.3d at 862 (“Even assuming HUD will someday apply a discriminatory policy
to Worth, absent concrete application of that policy, we lack ‘sufficient confidence in our powers
of imagination’ to ascertain its contours.” (quoting Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 301

(1998)); The People of the Village of Gambell v. Babbitt, 999 F.2d 403, 407-08 (9th Cir. 1993)
(holding that claim for declaratory and injunctive relief concerning Secretary’s sale of oil and gas
exploration leases not ripe; Secretary’s alleged past pattern of conducting lease sales does not
pose a specific, present controversy, and factual record necessary for decision cannot be
developed absent tangible prospect of leasing activity in the region).
Nor can Plaintiffs meet the “hardship” component of the ripeness inquiry. To satisfy the
hardship prong, Plaintiffs must show that withholding judicial resolution “creates a direct and
immediate dilemma” for the parties. Duncan, 612 F.3d at 115. “The mere possibility of future
injury, unless it is the cause of some present detriment” does not suffice. Id. (internal quotation
marks omitted).
Here, however, as the next Decennial will not occur until 2020, any temporary hiring for
that count is numerous years away. (See Patterson Decl. ¶ 9; Vitrano Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10-11).
Plaintiffs cannot point to any “direct and immediate” harm that would flow from withholding
judicial intervention on vague and undeveloped future temporary hiring policies and practices.
Nor do mere representations by Plaintiffs of their “interest” in non-Decennial positions satisfy
this requirement. Thus, as to Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief, this case is simply too
speculative for resolution by a federal court, and Plaintiffs’ “attempt to enlist the judiciary in
shaping agency policy” must be rejected. Worth, 451 F.3d at 862.
In short, as to Census’ future Decennial screening policies and practices, there is no “live”
controversy. For this independent reason, Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief must be

dismissed as non-justiciable.8
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Census respectfully requests that the Court dismiss
Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.

In addition to seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, Plaintiffs also seek
compensation for the amount of money they assertedly would have earned had they been hired in
connection with the 2010 Decennial. If the Court dismisses Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and
declaratory relief, Census may move to dismiss the remaining monetary claims of the individual
Plaintiffs as moot, pursuant to Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. “When a
defendant offers the maximum recovery available to a plaintiff, the Second Circuit has held that
the case is moot and there is no justification for taking the time of the court and the defendant in
the pursuit of minuscule individual claims which defendant has more than satisfied.” Ward v.
Bank of N.Y., 455 F. Supp. 2d 261, 267 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).
