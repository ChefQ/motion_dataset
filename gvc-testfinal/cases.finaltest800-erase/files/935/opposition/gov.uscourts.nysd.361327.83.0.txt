PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

When Plaintiffs first filed suit against Defendant in April 2010, alleging a massive
violation of Title VII, the Census Bureau was in the midst of what the Director called "the largest
non-military mobilization in the United States to count every resident in America." (Ex. 10,
Statement of Robert Groves dated Feb. 23, 2010 ("Groves Statement") at 2).' At that time,
Census was hiring temporary workers at a rate of 80,000 people per week. (Ex. 6 (Transcript of
Janet Cummings, May 6, 2010 ("Cummings Tr.") 24:19-11). Upon filing suit, each Plaintiff had
been explicitly or constructively barred from employment, and the Court had the capacity to
redress those injuries through issuance of declaratory and injunctive relief. Thus, Plaintiffs had
standing to challenge Defendant's discriminatory practice and seek injunctive relief, because
standing is assessed on the day that the suit commences. Once standing has been established, it
remains, and is not a mutable attribute that comes and goes, or that can be re-tested at other
points in the life of the litigation. The Court therefore should deny Defendant's challenge for
lack of standing.

Any assessment of the justiciability of Plaintiffs' injunctive relief claim after the
commencement of the suit must be conducted through the lens of mootness, where the defendant
carries the burden of showing that the violation could not reasonably be expected to recur.
Defendant cannot carry that burden here, since Census continues to conduct criminal background
checks for all "intercensal" (i.e. non-decennial) hiring, and it will continue to do so for at least a
portion of the temporary hires for the 2020 decennial. Similarly, Plaintiffs' injunctive claims are

ripe, especially since the actual determination of entitlement to and the shaping of an injunctive

 

* As used throughout this brief, "Ex." refers to exhibits attached to the Declaration of Samuel R. Miller
("Miller Decl."), filed herewith.
Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 83 Filed 08/01/11 Page 8 of 21

remedy will be performed after a liability finding and thus much closer 1n time to formulation

and implementation of the 2020 decennial policy.

To the extent that factual questions remain as to the practices for intercensal and 2020
decennial hiring, the Court cannot rule in Defendant's favor without allowing for full discovery
on the issue. In fact, in the Second Circuit it is an abuse of discretion for this Court to do so.
While Defendant has submitted some factual evidence with its motion, much of it contradicts the
public record or sworn testimony of Census officials, and the submissions raise more questions
than they provide answers, thus highlighting the impropriety of a ruling in Defendant's favor at

this time.

On a final point, Defendant's motion represents a continuation of Census's pattern of
avoiding accountability for its criminal background screening practices. Before this suit was
filed, Census had successfully shrouded these practices from public scrutiny, even from the U.S.
Congress. Through the suit, Census was forced to expose the 30-day letter process and arbitrary
"adjudication" criteria that lie at the heart of the discrimination affecting hundreds of thousands
of people. Now, through this motion, Defendant attempts to return to conducting its background
checks clandestinely, without being answerable to the Court. This is especially troublesome in
that it contravenes the nation's strong public policy-which ought to be exemplified rather than
flouted by a U.S. government agency-supporting the elimination of racial discrimination
through use of the judicial process, especially through the effective enforcement of Title VII of

the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

LEGAL STANDARD

When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), "the court must take all
facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff."
Doner-Hendrick v. New York Inst. of Tech., 11 CIV. 121 (SAS), 2011 WL 2652460 (S.D.N.Y.
July 6, 2011); Bonfiglio v. New York Presbyterian Hosp. Weill Cornell Med. Ctr., 10 CIV. 4939
(SAS), 2011 WL 2436706 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2011). In the context of a Rule 12(b)(1) challenge
to standing to seek a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief, Plaintiffs "must [1] allege personal
injury [2] fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and [3] likely to be
redressed by the requested relief." Hirsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 72 F.3d 1085, 1091 (2d Cir.

1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

ARGUMENT

I. Plaintiffs Have Standing to Pursue their Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Claims

Defendant argues that because the 2010 decennial census has now concluded, Plaintiffs
are unable to allege facts that establish an immediate threat of harm required for standing.
(Defendant's Motion to Dismiss ("Def's Mot. Dismiss") 11-12). Defendant ignores the most
basic rule of standing: Standing is determined by a snapshot of the justiciability of each
plaintiff's claims at the time of filing. See Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 787 (2d Cir. 1994)
("These constitutional minima are assessed as of the time the lawsuit is brought."*); Adanta Gas
Light Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 68 F.3d 409, 414 (11th Cir. 1995) (standing is
determined by "look[ing] to the state of affairs as of the filing of the complaint"), De/ Monte

Fresh Produce Co. v. United States, 570 F.3d 316, 324 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (same)." Thus, the

 

* Contradicting its argument that standing can be evaluated throughout the litigation, Defendant concedes
at one point that standing is appropriately resolved "at the outset of a case." (Def's Mot. Dismiss 8 n. 3).

3
Case 1:10-cv-03105-FM Document 83 Filed 08/01/11 Page 10 of 21

proper inquiry relating to standing is whether Plaintiffs alleged an injury caused by the defendant

for which the court could grant relief on the day the complaint was filed.

When a motion is brought early in the litigation to challenge a plaintiff's standing, courts
apply a low evidentiary threshold to find justiciability, recognizing the importance of discovery
on this jurisdictional issue. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 304 U.S. 355, 561 (1992)
(comparing the lower burden to establish standing at the motion to dismiss stage with the higher
burden on a motion for summary judgement); Nat'! Wrestling Coaching Ass'n v. Dep't of Educ.,
366 F.3d 930, 951 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (at motion to dismiss, "plaintiffs" burden is simply to make

the requisite allegations"); United States v. Diekemper, 604 F.3d 345, 350 (7th Cir. 2010).

Applying the Second Circuit test - i.e. (1) personal injury (2) traceable to the defendant
that is (3) redressable - Plaintiffs surpass the minimal threshold to establish standing. Hirsch, 72
F.3d at 1091. Defendant does not dispute that at the time Plaintiffs filed their complaint, the
background screening policy and practice used as part of the 2010 Decennial was in mid-stream,
and Plaintiffs alleged injuries that were traceable to these policies. In fact, some Plaintiffs
received actual rejection letters (Scott, Samuels, Desphy, Houser, Anderson) (Second Amended
Complaint ("SAC") 49 60, 71, 78, 100, 110), while others never received a response (Gonzalez,
Riesco, Daniels, Kargbo) (SAC 9] 83, 91, 94, 107), and yet others were so delayed in being
found eligible that they missed the hiring cycle (Johnson) (SAC 4 56). As of April 2010,
declaratory and injunctive relief would have redressed Plaintiffs' injuries by removing the 30-
day letter barrier and mandating a fair hiring process with adjudication criteria focused on a
realistic assessment of potential risk. (SAC 49 151-153). Substantial hiring continued for several
months thereafter and Defendant states that "the last appointments that were subject to the

challenged policies and practices expired on June 18, 2011." (Def's Mot. Dismiss at 12). Thus,
