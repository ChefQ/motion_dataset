INTRODUCTION

The motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Laverne Gaskins
confirms her complicity in an action against Plaintiff Hayden Barnes that she knew
was wrong. Through her acts and omissions, Gaskins shares responsibility for the
deprivation of Mr. Barnes' federal rights. Although Gaskins warned that Defendant
Ronald Zaccari's proposed course of conduct would violate Barnes' rights under
the First and Fourteenth Amendments as well as the Americans With Disabilities
Act ("ADA"), she nevertheless assisted in implementing the withdrawal decision.

Gaskins cannot now hide behind her post-hoc claims that she was merely
following orders and doing the bidding of Zaccari when she knew that assisting him
in implementing his plan necessarily meant violating Barnes' rights under federal
law. Government actors, such as Gaskins, are explicitly precluded from obtaining
qualified immunity where, as here, they knowingly participate in a course of action
that violates an individual's constitutional and federal rights. Additionally, Gaskins
failed to adhere to her legal obligation to bring the matter to the attention of higher
authority. Accordingly, this Court should deny Defendant Gaskins' motion for
summary judgment and instead grant | Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary

judgment.
Case 1:08-cv-00077-CAP Document 202 Filed 01/19/2010. Page 6 of 22

ARGUMENT
I. STANDARD OF REVIEW

Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.
R. Civ. P. 56(c); Eberhardt v. Waters, 901 F.2d 1578, 1580 (11th Cir. 1990). The

| standard of review for cross-motions for summary judgment does not differ from
-the standard applied when only one party files a motion, but simply requires a
determination of whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law
on the facts that are not disputed. American Bankers Ins. Group v. United States,
- 408 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir. 2005). The court must consider each motion on its
own merits, resolving all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is
under consideration. Id. The Eleventh Circuit has explained that "[c]ross-motions
for summary judgment will not, in themselves, warrant the court in granting
summary Judgment unless one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of |
law on facts that are not genuinely disputed." United States v. Oakley, 744 F.2d
1553, 1555 (11th Cir. 1984). Cross-motions may, however, be probative of the
absence of a factual dispute where they reflect general agreement by the parties as

to the controlling legal theories and material facts. Id. at 1555-56.

II. DEFENDANT GASKINS ADMITS THAT SHE ASSISTED
PRESIDENT ZACCARI IN AN EFFORT TO RETALIATE AGAINST
PLAINTIFF FOR HIS EXERCISE OF FREE SPEECH

Plaintiff and Defendant Gaskins agree on the following sequence of events.!
Gaskins, in-house counsel for VSU (Statement of Undisputed Material Facts J 1
(Dkt. # 174) (hereinafter "Gaskins' Statement of Facts"); Rule 56 Statement of
Undisputed Facts. Supporting Plaintiff Thomas Hayden Barnes' Motion for
Summary Judgment 0x00A7 5 (Dkt. # 179) ("hereinafter Barnes' Statement of Facts")'),
was approached by President Zaccari, who asserted that Barnes' Facebook.com
| collage was a threat. (Gaskins' Statement of Facts 0x00A7 3; Barnes' Statement of Facts
1 59-60). On April 26, 2007, Zaccari directed Gaskins to contact Elizabeth Neely,

the Board's Vice Chancellor for Legal Affairs, to determine how a university

 

' Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B)(2)(a), Plaintiff attaches a Statement of Disputed
Material Facts to this opposition.

' Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, Memorandum of Law in support, and
Statement of Facts were filed, along with a motion to file the documents under
seal, on December 23, 2009. (Dkt. #179). Gaskins' Motion for Summary
Judgment and related Statement of Facts and exhibits were not filed under seal.
(Dkt. #174). Pursuant to this Court's January 7 and January 14, 2010 Orders
pertaining to pending motions to file documents under seal, Plaintiffs Statement of
Facts and exhibits to his motion for summary judgment are not presently available
on the Court's ECF system. (Dkt. # 196, 201). Accordingly, any references herein
to Plaintiffs Statement of Facts refer to the document currently under seal.
Plaintiff attaches as exhibits to this opposition any documents referenced herein
that do not contain confidential information for the convenience of the Court.
Case 1:08-cv-00077-CAP Document 202 Filed 01/19/2010 Page 8 of 22

president could file a complaint against a student "for violation of the Student Code
of Conduct" and what processes would apply to such a situation. (Apr. 26, 2007 E-
mail from Gaskins to Neely (attached hereto as Ex. A); see also Gaskins' Statement
of Facts { 13). Neely responded by cautioning Gaskins that "[i]t is not good
practice for the President to be bringing a complaint against any student," as
student-conduct issues "should be handled by staff in Student Affairs. Once the
President has made a decision in a matter, there is no due process at the campus
| level." (Id.; see also Deposition of Elizabeth Evans Neely ("Neely Dep.") 14:5-16
(attached hereto as Ex. B)).

On May 1, 2007, Zaccari met with Defendant Gaskins in his office for a
conference call with Neely. (See Gaskins' Statement of Facts 4 18; Barnes'
Statement of Facts 0x00A7 102). Neely discussed various ways Barnes could be
administratively withdrawn from the university. (Deposition of Laverne Gaskins
("Gaskins Dep.") 61:19-21 (attached hereto as Ex. C)). Neely said that, as
President of VSU, Zaccari had the authority to withdraw Barnes. (Jd. at 53:22-24).
Gaskins raised "due process concerns [and] ADA concerns" about the process with
Neely and Zaccari. (/d. at 58:9-61:1; see Gaskins' Statement of Facts J 19). She
also expressed concerns about violating Barnes' First Amendment rights. Jd. at

60:16-18; Gaskins' Statement of Facts ] 19. But Neely dismissed Gaskins' words
Case 1:08-cv-00077-CAP Document 202 / Filed 01/19/2010 Page 9 of 22

39

of caution, saying, "[w]e'll worry about the lawsuit later.' Gaskins never agreed
with Zaccari that Barnes represented any kind of threat to campus security. (Ex. C,
Gaskins Dep. 135:25-136:4)).

On May 3, 2007, Zaccari convened a meeting with Defendant Gaskins and
other members of the VSU administration. (See Gaskins' Statement of Facts [ff 21-
24). Zaccari informed the group that he planned to administratively withdraw
Barnes. (Id.) Defendant Gaskins again raised due process concerns. (Id. { 24).

Thereafter, notwithstanding her professed knowledge that Zaccari's proposed
course of conduct would violate Barnes' federal rights, on May 4, 2007, Defendant
Gaskins prepared a memorandum for Zaccari providing a draft of a proposed
withdrawal letter. (Draft Withdrawal Notice and Gaskins Memorandum (attached
hereto as Ex. D); see Gaskins' Statement of Facts q 28). The memorandum
identified policies that "appear to be implicated" and again noted "due process
dictates that the student be apprised of what particular policy has been violated, an
opportunity to be heard and also be informed of the appeal process." (/d.) The
`Administrative Withdrawal notice was delivered to Barnes on May 7. (Barnes'
Statement of Facts 0x00A7 113).

On May 21, 2007, Barnes appealed his administrative withdrawal to the

Board. (May 21, 2007 Letter from Barnes to Board of Regents (attached hereto as
Case 1:08-cv-00077-CAP Document 202 Filed 01/19/2010 Page 10 of 22

Ex. E)). Under the process, letters were to be sent to Neely, the same Board
counsel who had told Zaccari he had unilateral authority to withdraw Barnes. (May
29, 2007 Letter from Neely to Barnes (attached hereto as Ex. F)).. On June 21,
2007, Zaccari sent his defense of the Administrative Withdrawal to Neely. (June
21, 2007 Letter from Zaccari to Neely (attached hereto as Ex. G)). Zaccari's
defense was prepared with Gaskins' assistance. (Ex. C, Gaskins Dep. 138:4-
139:19).

Ill. DEFENDANT GASKINS IN NOT ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED
IMMUNITY

A. Standard of Review

Defendant Gaskins asserts that she should be entitled to qualified immunity
protection. The doctrine shields government officials "insofar as their conduct
does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818
(1982).

Qualified immunity analysis proceeds in two steps. See Chesser v. Sparks,
248 F.3d 1117, 1121 (1th Cir, 2001). First, the court addresses the "threshold
question" of whether the facts as alleged, viewed in the light most favorable to
Defendant Gaskins, establish a constitutional violation. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.

194, 201 (2001).
