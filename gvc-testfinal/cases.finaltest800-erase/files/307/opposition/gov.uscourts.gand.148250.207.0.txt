DEFENDANT LAVERNE GASKINS’ STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFF’S STATEMENT OF PURPORTEDLY UNDISPUTED FACTS

Case 1:08-cv-00077-CAP

Document 207

Page 2 of 6

While the Plaintiff filed a response to this Defendant’s Statement of
Undisputed Material Fact in support of her Motion for Summary Judgment, he did
not file any formal statement of undisputed facts in support of his opposition brief.
However, he began the brief with a lengthy and argumentative statement of facts
with which he claims this Defendant agrees. That statement is incorrect, and this
Defendant files this statement to clarify her disagreement with portions of that
incorrect factual statement.
1.

At the bottom of page 3 and top of page 4 of his Opposition Brief, the
Plaintiff again flagrantly misstates the record, repeating a completely
untrue allegation from his Complaint that “Zaccari directed Gaskins to
contact Elizabeth Neely, the Board’s Vice Chancellor for Legal
Affairs, to determine how a university president could file a complaint
against a student ‘for violation of the Student Code of Conduct….’”
Even a casual reading of that contact, which was entirely in writing
and a part of the record of this case, shows that the communication
had nothing to do with determining how a university president could
file a complaint against a student. Rather, the document merely
conveys a direct inquiry from President Zaccari about where a
student’s appeal would lie in the event a president files a complaint
against a student. The Plaintiff, himself, admitted on deposition under

oath that the communication says no more than that, but his lawyers
insist on misrepresenting its contents. This Defendant has never
agreed with that mischaracterization, and does not do so now.
[April 26, 2007, e-mail exchange between Gaskins, Neely and
Zaccari, attached hereto as Exh. “A”]
2.

The Plaintiff claims, on page 5 of his Opposition Brief, that
“Defendant Gaskins prepared a memorandum for Zaccari providing a
draft of a proposed withdrawal letter.” The record shows without
dispute that Gaskins simply typed up what President Zaccari told her
to include in the draft of the withdrawal letter, with President Zaccari
dictating the terms of, and basis for, the withdrawal. [Exh. 1 to this
Defendant’s Reply Brief, Depo. of Gaskins, pp. 138, 139; Exh. 2 to
Reply Brief, Depo. of Ronald Zaccari, pp. 243-247] The record is
clear that Gaskins “prepared” that letter only in the sense of acting as
a scrivener, putting President Zaccari’s directed contents into written
form. The same deposition citations given above also establish that,
even in that scrivener’s role, Defendant Gaskins included a specific
notice in a memo on the draft, itself, that any withdrawal policy in
place at VSU would require due process and a right to a hearing, and

attached copies of those withdrawal policies, containing the express
due process requirements. Ibid.
3.

The Plaintiff claims on page 6 of his Opposition Brief that “Zaccari’s
defense [to the Plaintiff’s appeal] was prepared with Gaskins’
assistance.” This statement of fact is not material, as any action taken
after the Plaintiff’s withdrawal was complete is irrelevant in assessing
liability for that withdrawal. Anything done by Defendant Gaskins, or
any of the Defendants, after the Plaintiff’s withdrawal, during the
Plaintiff’s successful appeal of that withdrawal, was not a proximate
cause of the Plaintiff’s claimed constitutional injury, which was the
withdrawal, itself. Further, the undisputed evidence in this case
establishes that Gaskins made no substantive contribution to
President Zaccari’s defense on appeal. Her only action was to review,
at President Zaccari’s request, a letter prepared by President Zaccari
setting out his rationale for his withdrawal decision, after
President Zaccari asked her to put the letter in the proper format for
submission to the Board of Regents. [Depo. of Gaskins, Exh. 1 to this
Defendant’s Reply Brief, pp. 170-174]

This Defendant responded to the Plaintiff’s statement of facts in this
manner because the Plaintiff begins that statement by asserting that
the facts recited are agreed to by this Defendant. As shown above, that
statement is not accurate.
