SECOND MOTION TO WITHDRAW

COMES NOW, Angela Saad, Assistant Federal Public Defender, attorney of record for
defendant Christopher Robert Weast, and respectfully moves this Court for an order granting
Angela Saad and the Federal Public Defender for the Northern District of Texas, leave to withdraw
as attorney of record.

On August 6, 2014, Angela Saad, defense counsel, was served with a lawsuit from James
Joseph Smith, also referenced and known as Christopher Robert Weast. The suit is filed in the
348" District Court of Tarrant Count, cause number 348-273458-14. This lawsuit has also been
served on Christopher Curtis and Peter Fleury on August 8, 2014. The Federal Public Defender's
office is currently retaining counsel to represent all Assistant Federal Public Defender's named in
the civil lawsuit.

Due to the claims alleged in the lawsuit and the lawsuit pending in another court, the

Federal Public Defender's Office moves the Court to allow it to withdraw from its appointment,
Case 4:14-cr-00023-A Document 218 Filed 08/08/14 Page 2of3 PagelD 1140

and to allow defendant Christopher Robert Weast to represent himself. The allegations and need
to represent ourselves conflict with our duties to zealously represent our client while
simultaneously maintaining our ethical duty of loyalty.

WHEREFORE, the defendant prays that this motion be granted and the Federal Public

Defender's Office be allowed to withdraw.

Respectfully submitted,

JASON HAWKINS
Federal Public D
