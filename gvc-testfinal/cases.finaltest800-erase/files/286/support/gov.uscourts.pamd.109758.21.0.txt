The problem with the government's facile argument is that it

 

concedes that the Court has both the power to grant'my Motion for -
Reconsideration Doe. #1 7) and my Motion to Amend (Doe. #13).
Therefore, based on the government's own admissions, I would

"Alternatively, 5 te Court can recognize that I did ask for legal fees
as well as declaratory relief if my earlier filings. See Gov. Br. at 3.

AUDIT OF THE . FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS'
-MANAGEMENT OF INMATE PLACEMENTS IN
RESIDENTIAL REENTRY CENTERS AND HOME CONFINEMENT

EXECUTIVE su MMARY -

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) provides a variety of reentry:
programming to help incarcerated inmates successfully transition back into society.
As part of its release preparation, BOP has the authority to place inmates in
residential reentry centers (RRC), also known as halfway houses, and/or home (c)
- confinement while serving the remainder of their sentences. BOP may determine
_that an inmate should not be placed into either an RRC or home confinement

because, for example, the inmate poses a significant threat to the community. An
inmate placed in an RRC and/or home confinement remains in BOP custody.

RRCs provide a supervised environment that support inmates in finding (c)
employment and housing, completing necessary pregramming such as drug abuse
- treatment, participating in counseling, and strengthening ties to family and friends.
Home confinement provides similar opportunities, but is used for inmates. BOP
believes do not need the structure provided by RRCs. Inmates placed in home
. confinement are monitored and are required to remain at home when not working
or Participating Ir in release programing and other approved activities.

Pursuant to 5 the Second Chance Act of 2007, all federal inmates are eligible
for RRC and home confinement placement. However, BOP's placement decisions

_ are supposed to be driven by an individual assessment weighing an inmate's need
`for reentry services against the risk to the community. Inmates can be placed in

". RRCs for up to 12 months but can only spend a maximum of 6 months, or .

10 percent of the term of imprisonment, whichever is shorter, in home.

confinement. In fiscal year 2015, the BOP spent $360 million on RRC and home

confinement costs and, as of September 2016, BOP reported having 181 RRCs -

operated by 103: `different contractors.

`The Office of the Inspector General assessed BOP's RRC and home
confinement programs, including its placement policy and practices,. program
capacity planning and management, and strategic planning and performance
management. The audit covers inmates released from BOP custody from October
2013 through April 2016, either directly from BOP institutions, RRCs, or home
confinement.' Based on our analysis, we found that 94,252 inmates released fram.
BOP custody during the scope of our audit were eligible for placement in an RRC
and/or home confinement. BOP placed 79 percent of these eligible inmates into
RRCs and/or home confinement ~ 75 percent were initially placed in RRCs and only
4 percent went directly into home confinement. The remaining 21 percent were
released directly from a BOP institution.

Our audit found that BoP' s RRC and home confinernent olacement policies
and guidance, which are designed to identify individual inmate risks and needs

t.

while simultaneously weighing these against the safety of the community and
available resources, appear reasonable. In our judgment, the inmate's security -
level at the time of placement is the best indicator of inmate risk and need for -
transitional services because it incorporates key recidivism risk factors, as well the
inmate`s behavior during incarceration. As a result, we analyzed BOP's RRC and
home confinement placement practices based on the exit security level! of inmates
- released from BOP custody during the scope. of our audit,"

_ Our analysis determined that, contrary to BOP policy, BOP guidance, and
_ relevant research, BOP's RRC and home confinement placement decisions are not
based on inmate risk for recidivism or need for transitional services, Rather, we
found that BOP is placing the great majority of eligible inmates into: `-RRCs regardless
- of inmate risk for recidivism or need for transitional services, unless the inmate is

- deemed not suitable for such placement because the inmate poses a significant
threat to the community. As a result, low-risk, low-need inmates are far more
likely to be placed in RRCs than high-risk, high-need inmates. Specifically, we
- found that of the 94,252 inmates. released between October 2013 and

April 23, 2016, 90 percent of minimum security and 75 percent of low security
`inmates are placed in RRCs`and/or home confinement. However, only 58 percent of
high security level inmates were transitioned into the community through RRCs,
' while 42 percent were: released into the community directly from a BOP institution.*
We recognize this may be a result of the fact that many of the high security
inmates were considered a-public safety risk. Nonetheless, at the time they would
be placed in an RRC, on average these inmates are within 4 months of being
released into the community upon completion of their sentence. Thus BOP must
- weigh the immediate risk of placing high-risk inmates in RRCs against the risk of
releasing them back into society. directly from BOP institutions without transitional

reentry programming.

It also appears that BOP is underutilizing direct home confinement placement
as an alternative to RRC placement for transitioning low- risk, low-need inmates
.back into society. This underutilization of direct home confinement placement was
: `evident when we reviewed data on placement of minimum and tow security inmates
' and found that BOP placed only 6 percent of even those lower risk inmates directly
into home confinement, despite BOP policy and guidance stating that direct home
confinement placement is the preferred placement for low-risk, low-need inmates.
This is particularly concerning given that BOP guidance, as well as the research
_ cited in the guidance, indicates that low-risk inmates do not benefit from and may

in fact be harmed by RRC placement because, among other things, of their

exposure to high-risk offenders in those facilities, Moreover, the underutilization of

. `direct home confinement for low-risk, low need inmates results in fewer RRC

resources being available for high-risk, high-need inmates since the RRC inmate
population is already at or in excess of BOP's contracted capacity. In addition, this

 

4 During the scope of our audit, 11 high security inmates were placed directly into home
confinement.
