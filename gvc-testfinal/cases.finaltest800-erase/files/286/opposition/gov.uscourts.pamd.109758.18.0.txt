RESPONDENT’S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION
TO PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
This brief is filed to oppose a Rule 60(b)(6) motion for
reconsideration by Petitioner, Daniel Carpenter, of the Court’s May 11,
2011 Memorandum and Order (Docs. 15-16) dismissing his habeas corpus
action as moot due to Petitioner’s release from federal incarceration.
I.

Procedural History

Carpenter’s habeas corpus petition challenged the Bureau of
Prisons’ decision to deny him a period of home confinement or placement
in a Residential Re-Entry Center (RRC) at the end of his sentence. Doc.
1, Pet. The request for relief in the petition clearly states he seeks only
a request for early release on home confinement. Id. at 5-6.

Respondent initially opposed the petition on the basis that
Carpenter failed to exhaust administrative remedies before he filed his
petition or, alternatively, because the decision to deny Community
Corrections programs based on Carpenter’s history of pending federal
charges is consistent with BOP policy and the BOP has sole discretion
with respect to those decisions. 1 Doc. 10, Resp. Carpenter filed a traverse
on January 5, 2017. Doc. 11, Traverse.
Additionally, Carpenter filed a motion to amend his petition on
April 7, 2017. Doc. 13, Mot. to Am. In that document, he informed the
Court of his release from prison, but sought to amend his petition to seek
monetary damages in the amount of $10,000 for every day he believes he
should have served on home confinement rather than in prison. Id.
Respondent filed a Suggestion of Mootness on May 10, 2017 in light of
Carpenter’s January 26, 2017 release from prison. Doc. 14, Suggestion
of Mootness.

Petitioner states the government attached exhibits concerning
another inmate to the response. Upon further review, due to clerical
error, the United States Attorney’s Office attached incorrect exhibits in
support of the initial response. However, that error does not affect the
arguments presented to oppose the petition. In order to correct the record
in this case, the correct exhibits are attached hereto.

The Court dismissed the petition on May 11, 2017 as moot. Doc. 14,
Mem.; Doc. 16, Order. Carpenter opposes that decision with a Rule 60(b)
motion for reconsideration on May 23, 2017. Doc. 17, Mot. for Recons.
He asserts a case in controversy remains because, in addition to his
request for home confinement, he also sought attorney’s fees and
declaratory relief. 2 Id. at 4-5. He asks the Court to instruct him if he
needs to file a civil rights action for the damages claimed in his motion to
amend. Id. at 5.

Carpenter does not cite to a particular document wherein he seeks
attorney’s fees and declaratory relief. However, the petition contains
only a request for release on home confinement.

II.

Question Presented

Whether the court should deny the motion for reconsideration
because Carpenter fails to state a basis for relief.
III. Argument
A.

Rule 60(b)(6) relief is only invoked upon showing of
“exceptional circumstances.”
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) provides that the Court

may relieve a party from an order upon the showing of “any other reason
that justifies relief.”

Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).

Rule 60(b)(6) is best

described as “a catchall provision which allows a court to relieve a party
from the effects of an order for ‘any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment.’” Coltec Indus, Inc. v. Hobgood, 280 F.3d 262,
273 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6)). However, the Third
Circuit has consistently held that Rule 60(b)(6) “provides for
extraordinary relief and may only be invoked upon a showing of
exceptional circumstances.” Pappas v. Warden USP Allenwood, 608 Fed.
App’x 122, 123 (3d Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (denying motion for
reconsideration of district court decision to deny federal inmate habeas
relief based on challenge to decision of Discipline Hearing Officer)
(Coltec, 280 F.3d at 273). See also Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d
4

244, 255 (3d Cir. 2008); United States Steel Corp. v. Fraternal Ass=n of
Steel Haulers, 601 F.2d 1269, 1274 (3d Cir. 1979); Marshall v. Bd. of
Educ., Bergenfield, N.J., 575 F.2d 417, 425 (3d Cir. 1978).
B.

Carpenter is not entitled to habeas relief.
The decision to dismiss Carpenter’s habeas petition based on his

release from federal imprisonment is proper as habeas corpus is the
exclusive remedy for a prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his
confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release.

Preiser v.

Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973). Monetary damages are properly
pursued in a civil rights action against the appropriate defendants. See
id. Therefore, the court properly dismissed Carpenter’s petition, which
sought only release from prison on home confinement. Doc. 1, Pet.
Further, if the court were to convert his case to a civil rights action,
or if Carpenter were to independently file a separate civil rights action,
he would be obligated to pay the full $350.00 filing fee before proceeding
with his case because he is no longer entitled to be considered for in forma
pauperis status.

5

Based on the aforementioned, the court should deny the motion for
reconsideration because Carpenter cannot establish the “exceptional
circumstances” required for Rule 60(b)(6) relief. Coltec, 280 F.3d at 273.
V. Conclusion
In light of the aforementioned, this Court should deny Carpenter’s
motion for reconsideration.
