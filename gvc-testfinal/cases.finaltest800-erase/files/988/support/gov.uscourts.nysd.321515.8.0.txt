STATEMENT OF THE CASE
A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On February 28, 2008, Plaintiff commenced this action by filing a complaint. The
Complaint alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. 0x00A72000cente et seq. parallel State and Local statutes
relating to gender discrimination arising out of termination of employment. The Complaint also
alleged various state laws employment related claims. Named as defendants in this action were

North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One, Financial Corp. (sic)
On March 26, 2008 the then named defendants requested a pre-motion conference in
anticipation of a motion to dismiss. The thrust of the proposed motion was that the named

defendants had no employment relationship with plaintiff. A pre-motion conference was held on

April 14, 2008 and North Fork Bank was identified as plaintiff's employer and Capital One, N.A.

was identified as the successor by merger to North Fork Bank.

On May 2, 2008 plaintiff amended her complaint. Rather than name the proper
defendant, plaintiff added two additional defendants to wit: North Fork Bank and Capital One,
N.A., leaving as parties the original defendants, despite a request to correct this situation,
plaintiff has refused to name only the proper party defendant. Defendants now move for
judgment dismissing the complaint against all defendants.

B. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Plaintiff was employed for approximately six years with North Fork Bank. Her
employment was terminated in March, 2007. In June, 2007 plaintiff filed a charge with the
United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging gender

discrimination and retaliation against North Fork Bank. In September, 2007 Capital One, N.A..,

 
 

Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document8 Filed 05/27/2008 Page 5 of 12

successor by merger, responded to the allegations in the complaint. In December, 2007 a tight to
sue letter was issued with respect to the claim against North Fork Bank.

An action was commenced against North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One,
Financial Corp. in March, 2008. No action was commenced against North Fork Bank or Capital
One, N.A. until May, 2008. No charge was ever filed with the EEOC against North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc. or Capital One, N.A.

North Fork Bancorporation was a Delaware Corporation and was not in the business of
banking. Capital One Financial Corporation is a Delaware Corporation and was not and is not in
the business of banking. In December, 2006 North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. merged into
Capital One Financial Corporation and Capital One Financial Corporation thereby became the
successor by merger to North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. North Fork Bank was a federally
insured New York State chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc. Capital One, N.A. was and is a federally chartered national banking
association and a wholly owned subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation. In August,
2007 North Fork Bank merged with Capital One, N.A. and Capital One, N.A. thereby became
the successor by merger to North Fork Bank.

C. THE APPLICABLE STANDARD

A motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedures 12(b) should be granted if
under the set of facts set forth in the complaint no relief could be granted. Lind v. Vanguard |
Offset Printers, Inc., 857 Supp. 1060 (SDNY, 1994). Documents which are referenced in the
complaint or upon which the allegations in the complaint are based may be considered on a

motion to dismiss, Stuto v. Fleishman, 164 F3d 820 (2d Cir. 1999). Rossman v. Fleet Bank

 

 
 

Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document8 Filed 05/27/2008 Page 6 of 12

(R.L) Nat. Assn., 280 F3d 384 (3 Cir. 2002). Under these standards the motion to dismiss
should be granted.
ARGUMENT
POINT I
SINCE NORTH FORK BANCORPORATION, INC. AND
CAPITAL ONE, FINANCIAL CORP. DID NOT EMPLOY
PLAINTIFF THE MOTION TO DISMISS SHOULD BE GRANTED

Defendants submit that the documentary evidence establishes plaintifP s employment with
North Fork Bank. Accordingly, claims against North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One
Financial Corporation are not well founded and should be dismissed.

Plaintiffs complaint alleges a variety of claims all arising out of an employment
relationship, to wit: gender discrimination, retaliation, New York State Labor law, breach of
contract, etc. Plainly none of these claims lies against an entity which did not employ plaintiff.
Since North Fork Bank was plaintiff's employer, claims against North Fork Bancorporation, Inc.
and Capital One Financial Corporation are without basis.

Plaintiff's employment with North Fork Bank is conclusively established. Paragraph 14
of the amended complaint alleges plaintiff's employment as a branch manager at the entity doing
business as North Fork Bank. This is North Fork Bank. The exhibits to plaintiff's complaint all
reflect the employer as North Fork Bank. Plaintiff's W-2 previously submitted to this Court
reflects plaintiff's employer as North Fork Bank. Plaintiff's complaint to the EEOC reflects her

employer as North Fork Bank and North Fork Bank's response to the EEOC concedes such

employment. Plaintiffs employer was identified as North Fork Bank in open court at the pre-
Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document8 Filed 05/27/2008 Page 7 of 12

motion conference. Thus, it is beyond any dispute that plaintiff was employed by North Fork
Bank, a New York State chartered bank.

Since plaintiff was employed by North Fork Bank her only claim is against Capital One
N.A., the successor by merger to North Fork Bank. The certificate of merger as well as the New
York State Banking department document website demonstrates same. Capital One, N.A. was
identified as the successor by merger at the pre-motion conference. Thus, it is beyond any
dispute that Capital One, N.A. as successor by merger is the proper, and only proper party
defendant in this action. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss as to North Fork Bancorporation,
Inc. and Capital One, Financial Corp. (sic) should be granted.

POINT II
SINCE NO CLAIM FOR GENDER DISCRIMINATION WAS MADE
WITH THE EEOC AS TO NORTH FORK BANCORPORATION, INC. AND
CAPITAL ONE, FINANCIAL CORP., THE ACTION UNDER
42 U.S.C 2000e MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED AGAINST THEM

Defendants submit that the failure of plaintiff to file claims for gender discrimination and
retaliation with the EEOC against North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One, Financial
Corp. (sic) precludes the assertion of such claims in this action. Accordingly, the motion to
dismiss should be granted with respect to such claims.

42 U.S.C. 2000e provides, in relevant part, that it is a condition precedent to a Title VII
suit that a charge of discrimination be filed with the EEOC and a right to sue letter obtained. In
the instant case no such charge was filed, and no such right to sue letter issued with respect to
defendants North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One, Financial Corp. (sic). Thus, the

condition precedent contained in 42 U.S.C. 0x00A72000e was not met and the claims thereunder

 
 

 

Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document8 Filed 05/27/2008 Page 8 of 12

against North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One, Financial Corp. (sic) should be
dismissed.
POINT UI
- SINCE NO ACTION WAS TIMELY COMMENCED AGAINST
NORTH FORK BANK OR CAPITAL ONE N.A. WITH RESPECT TO GENDER
DISCRIMINATION UNDER 42 U.S.C. 0x00A72000e, THE MOTION TO DISMISS
AS TO THESE CLAIMS SHOULD BE GRANTED

Defendants submit that the failure of plaintiff to commence an action under 42 U.S.C.
0x00A72000e for gender discrimination and retaliation within 90 days of the right to sue letter against
North Fork Bank or Capital One, N.A. precludes such claims. Accordingly, the motion to
dismiss as to these claims should be granted.

42 U.S.C. 0x00A72000e provides, in relevant part, that an action under Title VII must be
commenced within 90 days of a right to sue letter by the EEOC. In the instant action a right to
sue letter with respect to North Fork Bank was issued in December, 2007 and the action against
North Fork Bank and Capital One, N.A. was not commenced until May, 2008, a period far in
excess of 90 days. Accordingly, plaintiff failed to comply with the condition precedent of 42
U.S.C. 0x00A72000e and the motion to dismiss as to such claims should be granted.

Plaintiff's claims against North Fork Bank and Capital One, N.A. do not relate back to
the initial filing under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15 and, therefore, are not timely. Under
Rule 15 an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:

"'_. (3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of
the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing
provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by
Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the

party to be brought in by amendment (A) has reviewed such
notice of the institute of the action that the party will not be
Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document8 Filed 05/27/2008 Page 9 of 12

prejudiced from maintaining a defense on the merits and
(B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake
concerning the identity of the proper party; the action could
have been brought against the party"

Since the amended complaint purported to bring in entirely new defendants, three tests
under Rule 15(c)(3) must be met. First, the claim must involve the same transaction. Second,
North Fork Bank and Capital One N.A. must have received notice within the time set forth in
Rule 4(m) such that they will not be prejudiced in mounting a defense on the merits. Third,
North Fork Bank and Capital One, N.A. know or should have known within such period that the
action would have been brought against them, but for a mistake concerning identity. Moreover,
the amendment fails to satisfy the purpose of the rule. Plaintiff fails to meet these tests for two
reasons. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss should be granted.

First, the purpose of Rule 15 (c) (3) as revealed by the Advisory Committee notes is to
address "name-correcting" amendments. The genesis of the Rule was to overturn the result in
Shiavone v. Fortune, 477 U.S.21, 106 SCt2379, 91 Ed2d 18(1986), where the proper defendant
was served, but "misnamed". In that case the defendant - Time, Incorporated - was misnamed
as "Fortune". Specifically, the Advisory Committee stated that:

"._. this paragraph has been revised to change the result in
Schiavone v. Fortune, supra with respect to a misnamed
defendant. An intended defendant who is notified of an
action within the period allowed by Rule 4(m).. . for
service of a summons and complaint may not under the
revised rule defeat the action on account of a defect in
pleading with respect to the defendant's name...

In the instant case the amendment sought is not a "name-correcting" amendment as

contemplated by Rule 15. Thus, the amendment does not relate back.

 
 

 

 

Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document8 Filed 05/27/2008 Page 10 of 12

The original complaint named North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One,
Financial Corp. (sic) and alleged their corporate status. These defendants were and are entirely
different corporate entities from North Fork Bank and Capital One, N.A. and the doctrine of
"mis-nomer" is not applicable. Lockleer v. Bergman & Bering, AB 224 FRD 377 (D.Md, 2004).
This situation is to be distinguished from a true "mis-nomer" situation such as that in Schiavone
supra, or that in Miller v. Northwest Region Library Board et al. 348 FSupp. 563 (MDNC, 2004).
There the "mis-nomer" consisted of naming "Northwest Region Library Board" rather than the
"Board of Directors of the Northwest Regional Library" and such mis-nomer was found to fall
squarely within Rule 15. Such is not the case here.

Second, assuming, arguendo that plaintiff overcomes the hurdle of "mis-nomer",
nonetheless plaintiff fails to satisfy the "mistake" prong of the test. Plaintiff knowingly made a
decision to name North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and Capital One, Financial Corp. (sic) as
defendants. Plaintiff did whatever due diligence she felt was appropriate in determining such
defendants' corporate status and making the necessary allegations. This decision was taken
notwithstanding the prior course of employment and conduct before the EEOC. Thus, the
doctrine of mistake is not available to plaintiff. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss should be

granted.
