PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Plaintiff Evelyn Jankousky ("plaintiff or "Jankousky") submits this
memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss of defendants North Fork Bancorporation,
Inc., Capital One, Financial Corporation, Capital One, National Association, and North Fork
Bank. Jankousky claims that during her employment as a bank manager at North Fork Bank
("the Bank"), the Bank discriminated against her on the basis of her sex, failed to pay her 2006
bonus in violation of state labor law, and retaliated against her for complaining about the
discrimination and illegal wage reduction. Jankousky also claims the Bank breached its contract
to pay her 2006 bonus, or, in the alternative is liable under common law theories for failure to
pay her 2006 bonus.

Rather than defend this action on the merits, defendants attempi iv delay the
litigation by claiming that Jankousky has sued the incorrect corporate entities. Defendants have
insisted on making this motion to dismiss despite the Court's admonition at the pre-motion
conference that such a motion appeared to be a "waste of time."! There is no dispute that

' " vleae rye ay b ~| ane tre +} Dawl
Jankousky Was a oranen Manager .Or wiC Daiin

from 2001 through March 2007. here is only an
issue as to which corporate entity is the appropriate defendant. In an effort to avoid wasting time
litigating this issue, plaintiff proposed to defendants that they agree to stipulate that Capital One,
National Association ("Capital One, N.A.") is the corporate entity that is liable as plaintiff's
employer and agree to proceed with the merits of this litigation. If defendants had agreed to this

proposal, plaintiff would have amended the Complaint to name Capital One, N.A. as the only

defendant. Defendants, however, rejected this proposition.

 

Transcript of Hearing before the Hon. Paul A. Crotty, 4/14/08, attached as Exhibit 1 to
the accompanying Declaration of Karen Cacace in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss
Complaint, dated June 13, 2008 ("4/14/08 Tr."), at 13.

Instead, defendants have proceeded with their argument that plaintiff's claims of
sex discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42
U.S.C. 0x00A72000e et_seg. ("Title VII") against Capital One, N.A. are precluded because the
Amended Complaint, which names Capital One, N.A. as a defendant, was filed more than 90
days after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") issued plaintiff a notice of
her right to sue. This argument is meritless because pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
i5(c)(i)(c), the Amended Complaint relates back to the date of the original Compiaint, in which
plaintiff named North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. d/b/a North Fork Bank and Capital One
Financial Corp. as defendants. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss Jankousky's Title VII
claims against Capital One, N.A. should be denied.

SLATEMENT OF FACTS

 

On May 22, 2007, Jankousky filed a charge of sex discrimination and retaliation
for complaining about sex discrimination with the EEOC against the Bank. (Amended
Complaint ("Am. Compl.") 46) The Bank, through its attorney Eric Bressler, filed a position
statement with the EEOC on September 19, 2007. (Afhrmation in Support of Motion to Dismiss
Complaint submitted by Eric Bressler, dated May 27, 2008 ("Bressler Aff."), Ex. G) On
December 5, 2007, the EEOC issued Jankousky a notice informing her of her right to sue in
federal court. (Am. Compl. 0x00A76)

According to defendants, during the pendency of the EEOC proceedings, the
Bank underwent a corporate merger. North Fork Bank was a wholly owned subsidiary of North
Fork Bancorporation, Inc. and North Fork Bancorporation Inc. merged into Capital One
Financial Corporation. Several months later, North Fork Bank merged into Capital One, N.A.,

which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation. (Defendants'

Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss ("Def. Mem.") at 3)

Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document9 Filed 06/16/2008 Page 6 of 11

On February 25, 2008, Jankousky filed the Complaint against North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc. d/b/a North Fork Bank and Capital One, Financial Corp. The defendants
were represented by Eric Bressler, the same attorney who had represented North Fork Bank in
the EEOC proceedings. On April 14, 2008, the Court held a pre-motion conference concerning
defendants' proposed motion to dismiss. At the conference, defendants' counsel represented that
Capital One, N.A. was the corporate successor to North Fork Bank. (4/14/08 Tr. at 10)
Accordingly, plaintiffs counsel stated that if Capital One, N.A. admitted that it was the
appropriate defendant, plaintiff would amend the Complaint to reflect that. (Id. at 12)
Defendants refused the Court's proposal to resolve the matter this way.

Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint on May 2, 2008 adding North Fork Bank
and Capital One, N.A. as deiendants. in a jeter to defendants' counsel, dated May 20, 2UU8,
plaintiff's counsel reiterated her position that she would dismiss all defendants except Capital
One, N.A. if defendants would stipulate that Capital One, N.A. was the proper defendant and
would agree to proceed with the merits of the litigation. (Bressler Aff., Ex. E) Defendants
refused to do so and proceeded with this motion.

ARGUMENT

I. STANDARD OF REVIEW

In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must
accept "all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw[] all reasonable inferences in the

plaintiff's favor." Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). Because

 

plaintiff has satisfied this standard, defendants' motion to dismiss should be denied.

I. PLAINTIFF'S TITLE VIE CLAIMS AGAINST CAPITAL
ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ARE TIMELY

 

Defendants do not contend that there is any deficiency in the substantive
allegations of Jankousky's Title VII claims against Capital One, N.A. Their only argument is
that the claims against Capital One, N.A. are time barred because the Amended Complaint was
filed more than 90 days after the EEOC issued plaintiff a notice of right to sue. This argument is
meritless because, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(c), the date of the
Amended Complaint relates back to the filing date of the original Complaint for purposes of
computing timeliness.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(c) provides that an amendment to a
pleading that changes the name of a party relates back to the date of the original pleading when:

within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons

and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment: (i)

received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in

defending on the merits; and (i1) knew or should know that the

action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake

concerning the proper party's identity.

Each of these requirements is salislied here.

Defendants do not dispute that plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint, which
named Capital One, N.A. as a defendant, within 120 days of the original Complaint, thereby
satisfying Rule 4(m). Nor does Capital One, N.A. allege that it will be prejudiced in any way in
defending this action because it was not named as a defendant in the original Complaint. As
Capital One, N.A. admits, it was aware of plaintiffs EEOC charge, which included the substance
of her claims. Indeed, Capital One, N.A., represented by Mr. Bressler, submitted a position

statement to the EEOC. (Bressler Aff., Ex. G) Thus, Rule 15(c)(1)(c)(i) is satisfied. See Deaner

v. Solomon, No. 02 Civ. 8772 (LAK), 2003 WL 1565949, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2003)

252337 vi 4

 
Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document9 Filed 06/16/2008 Page 8 of 11

(allowing plaintiff leave to amend complaint to add new defendant where new defendant failed
to establish "that the conduct of its defense would suffer in any way as a result of any delay").

In addition, Capital One, N.A. knew or should have known that an action would
be brought against it once the original Complaint was filed because Mr. Bressler represented the
original defendants in this action, North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., North Fork Bank's parent
company, and Capital One Financial Corporation, Capital One, N.A.'s parent company. Thus,

Rule 15(c)(1)(c)(ii) is satisfied. See Goodman v. Praxair, Inc., 494 F.3d 458, 473-74 (4th Cir.

 

2007) (finding that due to the identify of interests between corporate entities, the notice
requirement of Rule 15 was satisfied when a parent corporation was sued in the original
complaint and the subsidiary sued in the amended complaint).

Despite these facis, deiendanis claim that Rule 15 does not apply because this
case does not involve a "mis-nomer" of a defendant. (Def. Mem. at 7-8). Defendants support
their argument by attempting to distinguish this case from Schiavone v. Fortune, 477 U.S. 21
(1986). (Def. Mem. at 7) Schiavone, however, involved a similar situation. In Schiavone, the
plaintills brought iibei claims concerning slalemenis made in the magazine "Fortune." ihe
plaintiffs in Schiavone originally named "Fortune" as the defendant, which proved to be the
incorrect entity. Id. at 23. The plaintiffs later amended the complaint to name "Fortune, also
known as Time, Incorporated" as the defendant. Id. The Supreme Court found the relation back
doctrine did not apply. Id. at 29. Therefore, the court found that although the amended
complaint correctly named Time, Incorporated as a defendant, the amended complaint was
barred by the statute of limitations. Id.

In response to Schiavone, Congress amended Rule 15 to provide that "a complaint

may be amended at any time to correct a formal defect like misnomer or misidentification" as

252337 v1 5

 

 
Case 1:08-cv-01858-PAC Document9 Filed 06/16/2008 Page 9 of 11

long as within the time prescribed by Rule 4(m), the newly added party receives notice of the
claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15, 1991 Amendment, Paragraph c(3), Advisory Committee Notes.
Here, as in Schiavone, the Amended Complaint simply changes the corporate entity named as a
defendant. All of the substantive claims are the same and there is no prejudice to the newly
named defendant. Thus, this is precisely the type of case that Congress intended the amended
Rule 15 to apply to.

Accordingly, defendants' claim that the "relation back" doctrine does not apply to
this situation is incorrect. The filing date of the original Complaint should be used for purposes
of calculating the statute of limitations against Capital One, N.A. Because plaintiff filed the
original Complaint within 90 days of receiving her notice of right to sue from the EEOC,
plainuiil's Tite Vii claums against Capitai One, N.A. are umely. Thus, defendants' motion to
dismiss them should be denied. See Goodman, 494 F.3d at 475 (amended complaint naming
subsidiary of parent corporation named in original complaint related back to original complaint
for statutes of limitations purposes); VKK Corp. v. National Football League, 244 F.3d 114, 128-
29 (2d Cir, 2001) (amended complaint naming Loucndown Jacksonville, inc. as defendant
related back to original complaint naming Touchdown Jacksonville, Ltd. as defendant); Garg v.
Winterthur, 525 F. Supp. 2d 315, 317 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (granting leave to amend complaint and
summons to change name of defendant from Winterthur to Winterthur Life); Koal Industries
Corp. v. Asland, $.A., 808 F. Supp. 1143, 1157-58 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (amended complaint adding

officers of corporate defendant as defendants related back to original complaint).

 

2 Locklear v. Bergman & Beving, AB, 224 F.R.D. 377 (D. Md. 2004), the only case cited
by defendants in which the relation back doctrine did not apply, is entirely distinguishable. In
Locklear, the plaintiff originally named Hassleholms Mekanisk AB "Hassleholms" as a
defendant. Id. at 378. He later amended the complaint to replace Hassleholms with Luna AB
and Bergman & Beving AB as defendants. Id. at 379. The newly named companies had no

IH. THIS COURT HAS DIVERSITY JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF'S
STATE AND CITY LAW CLAIMS AGAINST CAPITAL ONE, N.A.

Defendants argue that if this Court dismisses plaintiff's Title VII claims against
Capital One, N.A., it should also dismiss plaintiff's state and city law claims against Capital One,
N.A. (Def. Mem. at 9) This argument is meritless because even if, as defendants argue,
plaintiff's Title VI claims against Capital One, N.A. should be dismissed, this Court would have
diversity jurisdiction over plaintiff's state and city law claims against Capital One, N.A.

Jankousky is a citizen of New York and the damages associated with her claims
exceeds $75,000. According to defendants, Capital One, N.A., is the only proper corporate
defendant and is a Louisiana association. (Bressler Aff., Ex. I) Thus, this Court has jurisdiction
over plaintiffs claims of sex discrimination and retaliation for complaining about sex
discrimination under the New York State Human Rights Law, New York Executive Law 0x00A7 296 et
seq. and the Administrative Code of the City of New York 0x00A7 8-101 et seq. pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
0x00A7 1332(a)(1). Similarly, this Court has diversity jurisdiction over plaintiff's common law claims for
breach of contract. or in the alternative. promissory estoppel. quantum meruit and unjust
enrichment.

Accordingly, even if this Court dismissed plaintiff's Title VII claims against Capital

One, N.A., defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs state and city law claims against Capital One,

N.A. for lack of jurisdiction should be denied.

 

corporate relationship to Hassleholms. In fact, Hassleholms, was not even a corporate entity, it
was a city in Sweden where Luna and Bergman were located. Locklear v. Bergman & Beving
AB, 457 F.3d 363, 364 (4th Cir. 2006). Because Luna and Bergman had no knowledge of the
plaintiff's claims until after the plaintiff filed the amended complaint, which was after the statute
of limitations expired, Rule 15 did not apply. 224 F.R.D. at 379.
