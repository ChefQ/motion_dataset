2 THE CLERK: Your Honor, this is the matter of Evelyn
3 Jankousky v. North Fork Bancorporation, et al, Docket No. 08-
4 cv-1858.
5 Could the plaintiff please state your appearance for

6 the record?

7 MS. CACACE: Karen Cacace from Vladeck Waldman for the

8 plaintiff Evelyn Jankousky.

9 THE COURT: Ms. Cacace.

10 MS. CACACE: And Maia Goodell, sir.

11 MS. GOODELL: Maia Goodell.

12 THE COURT: Ms. Goodell.

13 For the defendant?

14 MR. BRESSLER: For the defendant, Wickham, Bressler,

15 }}Gordon & Geasa, Eric J. Bressler.

16 THE COURT: Okay, Mr. Bressler.

17 MR. BRESSLER: 275 Broad Hollow Road, Melville, New
18 || York.

19 THE COURT: We're here on your application, Mr.

20 || Bressler.

21 MR. BRESSLER: That is correct, Your Honor.

22 THE COURT: And I also have a response from Ms. --
23 "it Cacace?

24 MS. CACACE: Yes.

25 THE COURT: Which indicates that you're wasting my

time because clearly Ms. Jankousky was employed by some entity
called North Fork, filed her EEOC complaint, you responded to
it, and you're suggesting generally that we've got the wrong
party here, right?

MR. BRESSLER: Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. BRESSLER: And, in fact, the documentary evidence
Supported by the -- proffered by the plaintiff in support of
the response I think demonstrates that.

THE COURT: Ms. Cacace.

MS. CACACE: Your Honor, as we said in our letter, we
filed our EEOC charge against North Fork Bank, which is where
Ms. Jankousky worked as a branch manager on Fifth Avenue. Her
W-2 form said just North Fork Bank. The respondent in the EEOC
proceeding represented by Mr. Bressler responded on behalf of
North Fork Bank, a division of Capital One NA.

When we -- they filed their full position statement,
there was some discussion about mediation. Mr. Bressler
represented them. After we received our right to sue notice,
we wanted to make sure we had the right corporate parties. We
did some more investigation, and it -- from the New York State
State Department records, we found the -- what we submitted,
the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., which appeared to be doing
business as North Fork Bank, which was then acquired by Capital

One Financial Corp., so that's why we sued the parties who we

did.

If it is appropriate for us to sue Capital One NA,
which appears to be a subsidiary of Capital One Financial
Corp., we -- you know, we would request that the Court allow us
to amend the complaint to include that defendant.

THE COURT: Mr. Bressler, what exactly is the object
of your application? I mean, where did the plaintiff get it
wrong? They named the wrong party, and because the statute of
limitations is past, they can't cure this defect. Is that it?

MR. BRESSLER: Well, that is one possible result of
the application. However, Judge, there is more to this than
that.

THE COURT: Where did this lady work?

MR. BRESSLER: She worked at North Fork Bank.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BRESSLER: North Fork Bank then became a division
of Capital One NA --

THE COURT: Right.

MR. BRESSLER: -- National Association, and it's a
national bank. To sue a Delaware-based holding company is
entirely improper. It has accounting implications. There are
real reasons why this is not a -- not an exercise in futility,
Judge. Why those people were named I don't know. Having gone
through the administrative process, and having been issued a

right to sue letter, I don't know the answer to that. I don't

know whether --

THE COURT: Well, the EEOC process was done by Ms.
Jankousky against what entity?

MR. BRESSLER: North Fork Bank.

THE COURT: Did you object --

MR. BRESSLER: A state chartered banking corporation,
which then became a division of Capital One NA, a national
bank, and the response so indicated. There is absolutely no
basis whatsoever for the lawsuit against my clients here.

THE COURT: Well --

MR. BRESSLER: Nor have I heard a good reason as to
why this was done. Certainly --

THE COURT: What is the appropriate entity for Ms.
Jankousky to sue? Assuming that she was discriminated against,
who should she sue?

MR. BRESSLER: Well, it seems to me, Judge, having
filed the complaint against North Fork Bank, Capital One NA
having responded to that, and Capital One NA existing today, I
would have thought, particularly given the fact that it's
condition-precedent, that an action would have been brought
against her employer, the person who appeared and defended in
front of the agency, not another entity.

And, yes, the statute would run if Your Honor
determined that this was not something that fell within the

meaning of Rule 15 and was simply a mistake. And I've not

heard that there was a mistake since counsel, as well as the
plaintiff herself, knew very well who she worked for. -

THE COURT: Well, I'm not really an expert on this,
but this is an evolving area of law of what constitutes an
appropriate notice. And you're not saying that you haven't
been notified, right?

MR. BRESSLER: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You're not saying that you haven't been
notified or your -- not you but your client hasn't been
properly notified of the pendency of this EEOC matter?

MR. BRESSLER: Well, as to the EEOC matter, Capital
One NA appeared as a defendant, absolutely.

THE COURT: And that's the successor to North Fork
Bank?

MR. BRESSLER: That is the successor to North Fork
Bank.

THE COURT: Well, I mean, what would satisfy you? If
Ms. Cacace changed the caption to Capitol One, would that
Satisfy you?

MR. BRESSLER: Well, no, Judge.

THE COURT: Why not?

MR. BRESSLER: Well, what would satisfy me would be a
dismissal. Whether the Court is going to order that or not is
something else, but at a very minimum, assuming arguendo, the

Court is not going to engage in that sort of dismissal, it

seems to me the wrong party is before the Court, and that has
to be remedied one way or another.

THE COURT: Well, I'm trying to figure out who is the
right party.

Ms. Cacace, can you help me on this? Because if the
right party -- as Mr. Bressler suggests, I guess I have to let
him make his application, but I think the remedy is for you to
right ~~ name the right party, whoever the right party is.

MS. CACACE: And that's what we would request leave to
do, Your Honor. If the correct party is Capital One NA as a
separate entity, we are happy to amend the complaint to include
that. I wouldn't at this initial stage want to dismiss the two
entities we have because the SEC documents and the New York
State, Division of State documents do indicate that North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc. is still operating.

And then the SEC documents filed by Capital One
Financial Corporation indicate that it acquired all of North
Fork Bancorporation in December of '06, so that's why we had
those parties there. But, you know, if Capital One NA is
willing to admit that they are the employer and they are the
appropriate party, we're happy to do that.

THE COURT: Mr. Bressler, you're looking frustrated.

MR. BRESSLER: Well, Judge, I would have thought based
upon what we have just discussed here today --~

THE COURT: Listen, I don't mean to be -- I mean, I'm

not overly persnickety on these things.

MR. BRESSLER: No, I understand.

THE COURT: So I don't want to walk up one side and
have you make a lot of motions and have me study those motions
and come back down. The remedy is to change the caption.

MR. BRESSLER: I understand that.

THE COURT: I mean, is there something substantive
attached to this wrongly named defendant? I mean, is there a
likely possibility that by any stretch of the imagination I'm
going to dismiss because the time has run?

MR. BRESSLER: I'm not at all --

THE COURT: On a legal basis.

MR. BRESSLER: Well, I'm not at all certain, Judge,
because I haven't heard enough here today from the plaintiff as
to why and how this occurred to determine whether, at least in
my view, the Court would be satisfied under Rule 15. I'ma
little frustrated because having heard everything that the
Court has just heard, I'm not hearing that there's going to be
a voluntary dismissal against the two named defendants, and
that is definitely going to necessitate motion practice, and
everything that goes with it. I don't believe there's a good-
faith basis for continuing now that we've had this discussion
against those two defendants.

THE COURT: Ms. Jankousky was employed by -- let's go

through it. Help me out here. She was employed by your client
