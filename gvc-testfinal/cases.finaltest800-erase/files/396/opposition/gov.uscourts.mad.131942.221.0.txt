Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 11 of 55

On its face, this case is no different from the myriad cases brought by individual plaintiffs
claiming that mortgage servicers breached trial loan modification agreements under the federal
Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) by not giving them permanent modifications.
These cases have been dismissed by literally hundreds of courts on a variety of grounds. Just as
significantly, the minority that have survived dismissal have invariably turned on individualized
facts specific to each plaintiff: their satisfaction of eligibility requirements, specific oral and
written representations made to them, even the jurisdiction where they bring suit.
This case differs in only two respects. First, Plaintiffs purport to bring it as a class action,
evidently figuring that claims which overwhelmingly fail individually have litigation value when
asserted on behalf of “a hundred thousand individuals.” Pls. Ex. 13 at ¶ 13. Second, Plaintiffs
are not even alleging they were entitled to modifications. Plaintiffs admit that many of them
may not have qualified for HAMP, and that some unknown (and unknowable) number of class
members may not have qualified either, but that Bank of America nevertheless harmed them by
not sending prompt rejection letters. The putative class thus amounts to a hodgepodge of
differently situated borrowers, including those who cannot establish a contract, those who cannot
establish their own performance, those who cannot establish damages, and those who can only
try to establish these things with individualized evidence of their personal course of dealings.
Plaintiffs do not deny the individualized nature of their claims; indeed, their trial plan
embraces it, contemplating multi-phased proceedings in which almost nothing is designated for
classwide resolution—but individualized discovery, summary judgment proceedings, and minitrials are necessary to assess liability, damages, and “any individual defense[s]” for a hundred
thousand claims. Dkt. #211 at 2. The plan is fatally defective for many reasons, but foremost
among them is that Plaintiffs need individualized evidence to establish threshold elements of

-1-

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 12 of 55

their claims at the liability phase, not merely at the individual mini-trial phase they contemplate
afterwards. A basic element of a breach-of-contract claim is the plaintiff’s own performance.
Plaintiffs do not even attempt to show that this can be established on a classwide basis. Another
basic element is damages. Plaintiffs do not attempt to show that this can be established on a
classwide basis, either. Holding individual trials for damages calculations does not resolve this
defect, because, as the First Circuit has held, the fact of damages across the class is a threshold
showing Plaintiffs must make to establish liability. But even if each phase could proceed exactly
as Plaintiffs envision, their proposal to kick the can down the road after three years of litigation
by certifying an unusual “liability only” class and then holding individual mini-trials that would
dwarf the purported “common” issues is a stark illustration why this case is fundamentally
unsuitable for class treatment. If, as Judge Saris has said, “[h]olding 11,000 individual damages
trials . . . is a management nightmare” (In re Pharm. Indus. Avg. Wholesale Price Litig., 230
F.R.D. 61, 95 (D. Mass. 2005)), what Plaintiffs propose here is a nightmare more than tenfold.
BACKGROUND
A.

The Home Affordable Modification Program
The Treasury Department launched HAMP in early 2009 to make mortgage payments

more affordable for homeowners at risk of foreclosure through a combination of interest-rate
reductions, term extensions, and principal forbearance. The program guidelines—first published
March 4, 2009, and since continuously revised and expanded through dozens of Supplemental
Directives (SDs), FAQs, waivers, and updates, most of which have now been incorporated into
or superseded by an official handbook that has itself undergone multiple revisions1—outline how

Mac each have their own versions of HAMP (see https://www.efanniemae.com/sf/

to assess and verify eligibility and how loans may be modified. Eligibility requirements pertain
to lien status, occupancy, unpaid principal balance, monthly payment amounts, and borrower
income, among other factors.

Borrowers also must supply documentation to verify their

income—the particular requirements for which have also undergone repeated revision2—and
complete credit counseling in certain circumstances.
If a loan is eligible, and the servicer is not precluded from doing so by other contractual
arrangements or investor requirements, it must consider the borrower for a modification. In
doing so, the servicer follows a series of steps (the “waterfall”) to adjust the monthly mortgage
payment to 31 percent of the borrower’s pre-tax monthly income. If the waterfall produces an
affordable payment, the servicer tests whether the cost of modifying the loan is less than the cost
of foreclosing (the Net Present Value, or NPV, test). If it is, the servicer may offer the borrowers
a Trial Period Plan (“TPP”) temporarily lowering their monthly payment. Until May 2010, Bank
of America offered TPPs to borrowers using variants of a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac form in
which borrowers promise: (i) to provide a Hardship Affidavit; (ii) to “provide[] documentation
for all income that I receive,” (iii) that the property is their “principal residence,” “has not been
condemned,” and has not undergone a “change in ownership,” (iv) that “all documents and
information I have provided . . . are true and correct,” (v) to “obtain credit counseling,” if
required, and (vi) “[t]hat all persons who signed the Loan Documents” signed the TPP. See App.
B (filed herewith) Ex. 10. The TPP does not take effect until both the servicer and the borrower
sign it, and the borrower will not receive a permanent modification if Bank of America
determines that he or she does not qualify. Id. at ¶ 2.F & G. If the borrower makes the trial

payments and otherwise satisfies the underwriting requirements, Bank of America offers a
permanent modification which the borrower must also sign and return.
Before Spring 2010, consistent with the HAMP guidelines at the time (compare App. A
Ex. 3 (SD 09-01) at 5 with App. A Ex. 6 (SD 10-01) at 1-2), Bank of America issued TPPs based
on borrowers’ unverified income representations and collected the documents needed to verify
incomes during the trial period.3 Unsurprisingly, this resulted in a vast number of borrowers
deemed ineligible for HAMP once their income was later verified.

Additionally, many

borrowers failed to submit complete documents, requiring Bank of America to request missing
items, sometimes numerous times. While Bank of America and other servicers accommodated
such delays by granting trial period extensions, this resulted in some borrowers’ spending
months in trial plans only to learn they were not eligible.
Treasury made a number of adjustments to address these challenges. Beginning in
August 2009, Treasury issued a series of waivers allowing servicers to extend trial periods to
allow borrowers to submit missing documents. See App. A Exs. 13-16. In October 2009, it
eliminated a requirement that had forced servicers to make repeated requests for updated
property valuation information. Id. Ex. 18 (SD 09-07) at 5-6. On December 23, 2009, Treasury
issued SD 09-10, prohibiting servicers from denying any modifications for TPPs scheduled to
expire on or before January 31, 2010 for any reason other than property specifications. Id. Ex.
22. Treasury also issued FAQ 1222-01, providing guidance for “situations where an eligible
borrower successfully completed the HAMP trial period but has not been converted by the
servicer to a permanent modification in a timely fashion” and requiring that eligible borrowers be

2009 forward was used to assess customer eligibility for and to place customers into Trial
modifications.”).

offered permanent modifications “made effective as of the date the modification would have
become effective if the servicer had converted the borrower in a timely fashion.” Id. Ex. 9 at 23; see also MHA HANDBOOK at 127-28. Ultimately, with the release of SD 10-01, Treasury
revised the HAMP guidelines, effective June 1, 2010, to require income verification before
offering a TPP. See App. A. Ex. 6.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Claims and Motion for Class Certification
Plaintiffs seek to certify 26 classes of borrowers who received TPPs from Bank of

America “in 2009 and the first part of 2010, pursuant to Treasury Directive SD-09.” Mot. at 12.
In other words, they do not seek certification on behalf of borrowers who received trial plans
after Treasury required that incomes be verified prior to trial plan issuance, or for anyone else in
the HAMP program in the last 3 or more years. Their theory is that Bank of America breached
their TPPs and violated various state UDAP statutes because they did not “tender” Plaintiffs
either a permanent HAMP modification agreement or a “written denial of eligibility” “prior to
the Modification Effective Date specified in the Trial Period Plan Agreement.” Mot. at 11-12.
While Plaintiffs’ claims sound in contract, they are not actually based on any contractual
language in the TPPs. In fact, nothing in the TPPs promises that Bank of America will provide
either a permanent modification agreement or a written eligibility denial prior to the
contemplated Modification Effective Date (“MED”).

The TPPs state that if the borrower

“compl[ies] with the requirements in Section 2” to make trial payments and the borrower’s
“representations in Section 1” regarding hardship, occupancy, income, and the provision of
supporting documentation “continue to be true in all material respects,” Bank of America “will
send [the borrower] a [permanent] Modification Agreement for [his or her] signature.” App. B
Ex. 10 ¶ 3. No deadline for sending the borrower the permanent modification agreement is

-5-

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 16 of 55

mentioned, which makes sense because borrowers had until the end of the day before the MED
to complete their trial obligations—meaning that a borrower’s eligibility for a modification might
not even be established until the MED. See App. C Ex. 6 at ¶ 36. And the TPPs contain no
commitment whatsoever to send ineligible borrowers a written denial letter, either by the MED
or at any other time. The provision addressing ineligible borrowers states, in full:

App. B Ex. 10 ¶ 2.F.
Thus, rather than basing their contract claims on an actual contract, Plaintiffs claim that
the obligations they allege arise from HAMP guidelines. See Mot. at 4 n.11. Plaintiffs’ expert
makes similar claims, citing to Treasury directives, not to any TPP. See, e.g., Pls. Ex. 13 ¶¶ 39,
40, n.48, n.51. But Plaintiffs’ reliance on the program guidelines is highly selective, as Plaintiffs
ignore all of the guidelines that contradict their theories. For example, Plaintiffs claim that
borrowers were injured if they failed to qualify for modifications but did not receive denials at
the end of their initial trial period—completely ignoring the Treasury directive extending trial
periods and prohibiting Bank of America from issuing denials “for any reason other than failure
to meet the HAMP property eligibility requirements.” App. A Ex. 22 (SD 09-10). Plaintiffs
claim that borrowers were injured if they received permanent modifications after the MED
contemplated by the TPP, but ignore the Treasury guidance specifically instructing servicers to
make such modifications retroactive to the MED. Id. Ex. 9 at 2-3. And Plaintiffs persist in their
theory that all borrowers, under all circumstances, should have had their eligibility evaluations
finalized by the end of their trials without acknowledging the four separate waivers issued

-6-

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 17 of 55

allowing servicers to extend trial periods to give borrowers more time to supply required
documents. Id. Exs. 13-16. Plaintiffs also ignore the contractual language appearing in some
(but not all) of their TPPs expressly providing for trial period extensions for borrowers who
made trial payments late. Compare, e.g., App. B Ex. 44 ¶ 4.E with, e.g., id. Ex. 10 (no ¶ 4.E).
C.

The Named Plaintiffs
Plaintiffs submit 43 class representatives (inclusive of couples), but mention only one of

them in their brief. Plaintiffs say that Antoun and Sabah Moussa “exemplify” their claims
because they made their trial payments, allege they were “repeatedly” asked “to send documents
they had already sent,” and thus claim they were wrongly denied a modification. Mot. at 10.
Plaintiffs fail to mention that the Moussas “repeatedly” failed to send a key financial document
until well after the MED. See App. B ¶ 7. Plaintiffs say nothing about the other 42 Plaintiffs,
but the reality is a patchwork quilt of different situations, legal theories, and applicable defenses:


Some of the Plaintiffs were offered a permanent HAMP modification with terms
retroactive to their original MED. Some accepted (see App. B ¶ 24 (Lopez)), and
some did not. See id. ¶ 16 (Carillo), ¶ 31 (Nelson).



Some of the Plaintiffs failed to make their trial payments, and thus do not even come
within the class definition. See id. ¶ 10 (George), ¶ 31 (Nelson).



Some of the Plaintiffs admit making untrue representations in their TPP. See App. C
Ex. 4 at 71:6-10, 72:1-23, 76:8-77:5, 134:23-135:10 (Galasso) & Ex. 7 at 11:8-14:13,
124:20-125:9 (Volpe).



Some of the Plaintiffs failed to provide required documents by their MED—or failed
to provide them at all—and thus did not perform their own obligations under the TPP.
See App. B ¶¶ 3-9 (Moussa), ¶ 10 (George), ¶ 12 (Alvarenga), ¶ 14 (Buckley), ¶ 15
(Cabrera), ¶ 17 (Cipowski), ¶ 18 (Dugree), ¶ 19 (Goldman), ¶ 26 (McManaman), ¶ 28
(Morrow & Clark), ¶ 29 (Kirkpatrick).



Some of the Plaintiffs failed to complete the credit counseling they were obligated to
complete under the TPP. See id. ¶ 10 (George), ¶ 13 (Balde), ¶ 21 (Hlavsa); App. C.
Ex. 15 at 121:4-122:7, Ex. 16 at 130:7-131:6. At least one of the named Plaintiffs
filed for bankruptcy during the trial period (see App. B. ¶ 20 (Golden)), and thus was
eligible for HAMP only “at the servicer’s discretion.” App. A. Ex. 3 (SD 09-01) at 2.

-7-

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 18 of 55

D.



Some of the Plaintiffs were deemed ineligible for a permanent modification based on
their verified income and monthly payment amounts or the fact that the property was
not their primary residence, and Plaintiffs’ only complaint is that they were not
notified of their ineligibility sooner. See App. B ¶¶ 3-9 (Moussa), ¶ 11 (Magno), ¶ 13
(Balde), ¶ 14 (Buckley), ¶ 15 (Cabrera), ¶ 17 (Cipowski), ¶ 18 (Dugree), ¶ 19
(Galasso), ¶ 20 (Golden). ¶ 21 (Hlavsa), ¶ 22 (Kunsky), ¶ 29 (Kirkpatrick), ¶ 30
(Soper). Plaintiffs do not articulate any theory that explains how such borrowers
were damaged.



Some of the named Plaintiffs entered into their TPPs with Wilshire Credit Corp., not
Bank of America, with MEDs before Bank of America even serviced their loans (see
id. ¶ 12 (Alvarenga); App. C ¶ 22 (Freeman), ¶ 27 (Hall)), including at least one
Wilshire declined for a permanent HAMP modification before transferring servicing
to Bank of America. App. B ¶ 12 (Alvarenga).



At least one of the Plaintiffs claims an oral contract with Bank of America. See id. ¶
21 (Hlavsa); App. C Ex. 8 at 95:3-96:13, 134:17-137:10.



Some of the Plaintiffs were offered other loan modifications after they originally
failed to qualify for HAMP. Some of those Plaintiffs turned those modifications
down, thus failing to mitigate their alleged damages. See App. B ¶ 9 (Moussa), ¶ 10
(George), ¶ 18 (Dugree), ¶ 27 (Mikhail), ¶ 30 (Soper). Others accepted the
modifications (see id. ¶ 11 (Magno), ¶ 13 (Balde), ¶ 15 (Cabrera), ¶ 25
(Manfredonia), ¶ 26 (Morrow & Clark)), and Plaintiffs offer no evidence, nor any
method by which such evidence could be adduced, that those modifications are less
favorable than the modifications Plaintiffs claim they should have gotten.4

Bank of America’s HAMP Compliance Efforts
Bank of America has converted more trial and permanent HAMP modifications than any

other loan servicer. The program has not been free of challenges, but Bank of America has
dedicated enormous resources to HAMP based on its commitment to promoting modifications as
an alternative to foreclosure that benefits homeowners, investors, and servicers. See App. A.
When Treasury rolled out HAMP, it estimated there were nearly three million eligible
borrowers. The first TPPs were issued within weeks, and servicers—across the board—faced
challenges implementing a program that demanded major new resources: underwriters to review

4

Beyond the 26 Plaintiffs specifically identified above, the applications, decisions, and
communications related to the remaining Plaintiffs are also inherently individual and require fileby-file analysis to understand. See App. C ¶¶ 18-37 and exhibits referenced therein.
-8-

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 19 of 55

documents and validate incomes, legal and business staff to reconcile HAMP compliance
demands with contractual obligations to investors, and technology and staff to run NPV
calculations. Compounding these problems was the fact that “[p]rogram rules had not been fully
developed . . . by the time the program began, and Treasury . . . had to revise guidelines
repeatedly, often causing confusion and delay.” App. A. Ex. 1 at 30.
Borrowers’ ability to obtain trial modifications based on unsupported oral representations
had particularly salient consequences, incentivizing borrowers to use trial plans to lower their
monthly payments even if they did not qualify—and “gam[e] the system by withholding required
documents . . . thereby avoiding to have to make payments until the end of the trial period and
still avoid foreclosure.” Id. at 23. Despite official recognition that “Treasury’s decision to
permit servicers to start trial modifications before receiving supporting documents has been
counterproductive, creating a large backlog of trial modifications, of which many will never
become permanent” (id. at 1), Bank of America went out of its way not to decline files and
continued attempting to place borrowers in modifications even after their trials expired. See
App. A. ¶ 31. But in Plaintiffs’ version of events, Bank of America responded by “issu[ing]
wrongful denials en masse to reduce its HAMP backlog” while simultaneously (and bizarrely)
pursuing a strategy to add to that backlog by “stringing homeowners along.” Mot. at 6.
Plaintiffs ignore these well-documented, industry-wide challenges and accuse Bank of
America of “deliberate bad faith.” Mot. at 2, 6. Plaintiffs do not support this theory with any of
the millions of documents, tens of thousands of emails, or dozens of depositions taken in this
case, instead relying on statements their lawyers have commissioned from a few exemployees/contractors, which were clearly drafted by Plaintiffs’ counsel to support their theory
that the outcomes they contest reflect indiscriminate (and inexplicable) corporate malevolence

-9-

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 20 of 55

rather than the obvious administrative challenges presented by a massively scaled program rolled
out on short notice with ever-changing guidelines. The declarations would not support class
certification even if they were credible, but they are demonstrably false:


Half of the declarants didn’t even work for Bank of America during the relevant
period. Compare Mot. at 12 (defining class as borrowers who received TPPs “in
2009 and the first part of 2010”), with Pls. Ex. 1 ¶ 2 (employed from June 2010
through August 2012); Pls. Ex. 5 ¶ 3 (employed from August 2010 to January 2011);
Pls. Ex. 7 at 2 (employed from April 2010 to November 2011).



The declarants wildly misrepresented their duties at the Bank, and most had only
minimal involvement with HAMP—or none at all. Simone Gordon, Theresa
Terrelonge, and Recorda Simon were call-center operators whose only involvement
with HAMP would have been to forward calls to other departments if a borrower
might qualify; See App. D (filed herewith) Ex. 5 ¶¶ 12-16, Ex. 8 ¶¶ 4-11 & 19, Ex. 9
¶¶ 4-12. Up until a few months before her termination in 2012, Gordon worked in a
call center responsible only for credit card customers. See id. Ex. 4 ¶¶ 4-20, Ex. 5 ¶¶
4-11. Bert Sheeks was a contractor responsible for processing customer complaints,
not HAMP applications. See id. Ex. 10 at ¶¶ 5-9. William Wilson claims he worked
as an underwriter, but he didn’t. See id. Ex. 1 ¶ 5, Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 4, 6; Ex. 3 ¶ 5. Steven
Cupples is the only declarant who actually worked as an underwriter, but he was
tasked solely with running income calculations and had no role in making eligibility
determinations as he claims. See id. Ex. 6 ¶¶ 6-7, 13 & 17; Ex. 7 ¶ 5, 13.



The declarants’ wild misrepresentations about their roles lead to impossible claims
about what they did and saw. In her role as a credit-card call center operator until the
end of 2011, Gordon would not have dealt with HAMP applications. See id. Ex. 4 ¶¶
4-20, Ex. 5 ¶¶ 4-5, 7-11. Gordon and Terrelonge each contrived allegations that they
received gift cards or cash to refer loans to foreclosure or deny HAMP modifications,
but they worked in departments that did not have the ability to do either of these
things. See id. Ex. 4 ¶¶ 4-20, Ex. 5 ¶¶ 4-5, 7-24; Ex. 8 ¶¶ 4-11, 13-26. The SEIBEL
database that Sheeks claims he used to deny HAMP applications and force borrowers
to restart the process was not used for HAMP; Sheeks was never instructed to close a
complaint file in SEIBEL without reason, but even if he had done so, it would have
had no effect on a HAMP application. See id. Ex. 10 ¶¶ 6-21. In Wilson’s roles, he
would have had neither the qualifications nor the authority to determine who was
eligible for HAMP. See id. Ex. 2 ¶¶ 6, 8 & 12, Ex. 3 ¶¶ 6, 10, Ex. 11 ¶¶ 3-6. Despite
Wilson’s claims that the bank used a “blitz” process to deny modifications as quickly
as possible, blitzes were used to help approve applications, not deny them: a “blitz”
describes the use of overtime hours on evenings and weekends (when CRMs had the
greatest chance of reaching borrowers) to call large numbers of borrowers to obtain
outstanding documentation needed to process their applications. See id. Ex. 2 ¶ 8,
Ex. 3 ¶ 14, Ex. 11 ¶ 14, Ex. 13 ¶¶ 5-8, Ex. 14 ¶¶ 6-9, Ex. 15 ¶¶ 8-11, Ex. 16 ¶¶ 6-9,
Ex. 17 ¶¶ 8-11, Ex. 18 ¶¶ 6-9. Wilson’s claim that the bank pushed HAMP-eligible
borrowers into “more profitable” non-HAMP modifications is also contradicted by
- 10 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 21 of 55

empirical data establishing that HAMP modifications were in fact more profitable.
See id. Ex. 12 ¶¶ 2-10.


The sole claim in the declarations with any pertinence to this motion (because it bears
on what borrowers had to do to satisfy eligibility requirements) is the claim that the
bank never issued TPPs based on borrowers’ unverified oral representations. In fact,
it was routine for Bank of America to do so, consistent with HAMP’s guidelines at
the time (see supra n.3 and App. D Ex. 6 ¶ 17; Ex. 7 ¶ 13. ), and many named
Plaintiffs received TPPs based on oral or other unverified representations. See, e.g.
App. C. Ex. 4 at 68:14-70:8, 70:23-71:5, 73:3-24 & Ex. 9 (Galasso); Ex. 5 at 49:1723, 50:5-17, 52:11-22; 53:3-10, 55:7-57:6 & Exs. 10-12 (Soper).



The declarants have a significant motive to manufacture false allegations against
Bank of America, since at least six of the seven were fired for inappropriate
behavior—including threatening violence against a coworker (Gordon), sending
inappropriate text messages to a member of his team (Cupples), and bullying his
associates (Wilson). App. D. Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 4, 6, 8, 12-14.



Other employees have attested that the bank bent over backwards to help borrowers
seeking HAMP modifications and that they were trained to explore HAMP as the first
option for borrowers in distress, give borrowers multiple opportunities to provide
required documents, and communicate regularly with borrowers about their
applications. See id. Ex. 13 ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. 14 ¶¶ 3-5, Ex. 15 ¶¶ 3-7, Ex. 16 ¶¶ 3-5, Ex.
17 ¶¶ 3-7, Ex. 18 ¶¶ 3-5. Bank employees were often contacted directly by borrowers
wishing to express thanks for their help on HAMP applications. See, e.g., id. Ex. 13 ¶
4, Ex. 14 ¶ 5, Ex. 15 ¶ 7, Ex. 16 ¶ 5, Ex. 17 ¶ 7, Ex. 18 ¶ 5.

In sum, the declarants could not have witnessed what they claim to have witnessed because they
were not in a position to do so—and would not have witnessed such things in any event because
Bank of America’s actual practices were diametrically opposite.
ARGUMENT
I. INDIVIDUAL CASES ASSERTING THE SAME CLAIMS AS PLAINTIFFS’ SHOW
WHY CLASS CERTIFICATION IS INAPPROPRIATE.
Literally hundreds of individual plaintiffs across the country have brought actions
alleging that their servicers breached TPPs by not offering them permanent HAMP
modifications. This substantial body of law (see Appendix) is significant for numerous reasons.
First, the majority of courts to address the issue have rejected the claims and held that
even borrowers who made their trial payments and satisfied the eligibility requirements do not

- 11 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 22 of 55

have a contractual claim for a permanent loan modification.5 Some reject the claims because the
TPPs “are indefinite and uncertain as to material terms of the permanent loan modifications,”
and thus “represent, at best, unenforceable agreements to agree.”6 Some reject the claims
because the plaintiffs (like the Plaintiffs here) seek to enforce alleged contracts which have not
actually been signed by both parties.7 Some reject the claims because the TPPs make the
servicer’s commitment to modify a loan contingent on the servicer’s sending the borrower a fully
executed permanent modification agreement, and thus borrowers who are never sent one have no

modification after the Ilardos successfully performed are rejected as unmeritorious”).

contractual right to a permanent modification.8 And, of course, some reject the claims because
of the plaintiffs’ failure to satisfy the permanent modification eligibility requirements.9
Second, even the few cases where the plaintiffs have survived dismissal turn on
individualized facts specific to their circumstances and course of dealings with their servicers.
Just as those individualized facts have proven dispositive in individual cases, they will certainly
prove dispositive of the claims of individual class members here—making it impossible to
litigate those claims with common proof. For example, Plaintiffs rely heavily on Young v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., 2013 WL 2165262, *6 (1st Cir. May 21, 2013), which reinstated a claim that
a TPP “required Wells Fargo to offer [the plaintiff] a permanent modification” on the ground that
the plaintiff alleged “that she performed all of her obligations under the TPP.” But Plaintiffs
cannot show with common proof that every class member performed all of their obligations.
Third, the different results and different rationales employed across this vast body of
precedent crystallize the problems inherent in Plaintiffs’ request to certify claims under 26
different states’ laws. Young is based on Massachusetts law. But Lucia, applying California
law, and Thomas, applying New Jersey law—to cite just two examples—reached the opposite
result on the question of whether borrowers’ performance of all their TPP obligations entitles
them to permanent modifications, and Plaintiffs also seek certification of claims subject to the
laws of these states, too. Breaking the class into 26 subclasses does not resolve this problem.

Plaintiffs still contemplate summary judgment proceedings that would require this Court to
interpret and apply the laws of all 26 class states. Plaintiffs also cite 12 states where the
proposed class representatives “filed their claims directly before this Court” and “hence there
would be no remand to a transferor court under § 1407(a),” leaving this Court to conduct the
trials and instruct the jury on the laws of these dozen states. Dkt. #211 at 2 & n.2.
Fourth, the myriad individual cases asserting the same claims Plaintiffs seek to certify
for class treatment make it impossible to sustain the argument that a class action is a “superior”
method for adjudicating such claims, as Rule 23(b)(3) requires. In imposing this requirement,
“the Advisory Committee had dominantly in mind vindication of the ‘rights of groups of people
who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.’”
Amchem Prods. Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997). Manifestly, individual borrowers
asserting claims based on HAMP TPPs have not lacked the ability to bring suit.
Finally, many of the borrowers who have brought individual claims are actually
members of the class Plaintiffs seek to certify. For example, Katy Brinson, Diana Hayes, Rusty
and Brenna Krouse, Tommy and Melissa Geske, Alma and Jose Gomez, and James Salvador all
come within Plaintiffs’ class definition—and they also all brought individual claims against
Bank of America, had their day in court, and lost. See Brinson, Hayes, Krouse, Geske, Salvador,
supra; Gomez v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2012 WL 929790 (D. Or. Mar. 19, 2012). A class action can
be a superior method of adjudicating claims when necessary to “avoid[] potentially inconsistent
adjudications,” In re Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2005 WL 3178162, *3 (D. Mass.
Nov. 28, 2005), but here class certification would have the opposite effect, inviting results
directly at odds with long-settled adjudications.

II. RULE 23(C)(4) DOES NOT PERMIT EVEN THE PARTIAL CERTIFICATION
PLAINTIFFS SEEK.
The Supreme Court held in Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1433 (2013), that
a class cannot be certified unless plaintiffs “establish[] that damages are capable of measurement
on a classwide basis.” Plaintiffs concede they have no method to do this, but try to evade
Comcast by seeking partial certification under Rule 23(c)(4) with a plan contemplating a “Phase
One” of liability trials for 26 state classes and a “Phase Two” of individualized proceedings on
damages and other issues. Dkt. #211 at 2.10 Plaintiffs rely on the statement in the Comcast
dissent that “a class may be certified for liability purposes only, leaving individual damages
calculations to subsequent proceedings” (Mot. at 13), but that principle, even if applicable in
other contexts, does not help Plaintiffs here. Under binding First Circuit precedent, establishing
the fact of damages for each class member is something Plaintiffs must do at the liability phase.
Brown v. Am. Honda (In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig.), 522 F.3d 6, 28
(1st Cir. 2008). And Plaintiffs propose no method for doing this on a classwide basis.
Damages are an essential element of Plaintiffs’ claims. See Linton v. New York Life Ins.
& Annuity Corp., 392 F. Supp. 2d 39, 41 (D. Mass. 2005) (Zobel, J.) (contract plaintiff must
demonstrate “that [plaintiff] suffered damages from the breach”). A person who has no damages
10

Plaintiffs argue that “[w]hen considering whether a class should be certified only for certain
issues pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4), the Court’s inquiry is whether the factors of 23(a) and 23(b) are
met with regard to the issues sought to be certified,” and that they need not show that common
issues predominate with respect to the case as a whole. Mot. at 13. As Plaintiffs recognize,
however, that is not the law in this Circuit. The First Circuit has never addressed whether Rule
23(c)(4) absolves plaintiffs of the requirement to establish that common issues predominate with
respect to the case as a whole, and courts elsewhere are split. Compare In re Nassau Cty. Strip
Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2006), with Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th
Cir. 1996). Bank of America respectfully submits that “[t]he proper interpretation of the
interaction between subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action, as a whole, must
satisfy the predominance requirement of (b)(3)” and that reading Rule 23(c)(4) to permit the
Court to “sever” individualized issues and only assess predominance based on what remains
“would eviscerate the predominance requirement.” Castano, 84 F.3d at 745 n.21.

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 26 of 55

cannot prevail on the liability questions that Plaintiffs propose for common resolution in “Phase
One.” Thus, the class cannot be certified without a common method for identifying (at the very
least) which borrowers have damages and which do not. In Brown, the First Circuit vacated a
certification based on a damages model that showed aggregate damages but failed to show which
class members were damaged in the first place, holding:
[P]laintiffs’ theory . . . must include some means of determining that each
member of the class was in fact injured, even if the amount of each individual
injury could be determined in a separate proceeding. Predominance is not
defeated by individual damages questions as long as liability is still subject to
common proof. . . . Establishing liability, however, still requires showing that
class members were injured. . . .
The plaintiffs might intend to use their damages model to prove both fact of
damages and the measure of those damages. If so, the district court would need
enough information to evaluate preliminarily whether the proposed model will be
able to establish, without need for individual determinations for the many millions
of potential class members, which . . . were impacted . . . and which were not.
522 F.3d at 28 (emphasis added). Similarly, In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. SGLI/VGLI
Contract Litig., 286 F.R.D. 155, 158 (D. Mass. 2012), denied certification on the ground that if
“the fact of actual injury is an element” of the claim, “each class member must prove that he or
she suffered some injury.” The Court found that “regardless of what measure of damages
Plaintiffs choose, it seems likely that they will have to show that each class member suffered
some actual, legally cognizable injury . . . to establish liability,” giving rise to “the necessity of
an individualized inquiry regarding injury for each proposed class member.” Id. at 159.11
While Plaintiffs declare without support that “all class members have been injured” (Mot.
at 4), they do not propose any method for determining whether this is in fact the case. Their

actually suffered damages as a result of defendants’ breach”); Orthocraft, Inc. v. Sprint
Spectrum, L.P., 2002 WL 31640477, *2 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2002) (“The critical issue . . . is that
the fact of injury as to each member of the class is a necessary element and would still require
individual analysis, . . . which defeats the typicality and commonality requirements”).

class includes multiple categories of borrowers (and many named Plaintiffs) who do not have
damages either from an economic perspective, as a matter of law, or both, including:


Borrowers who rejected permanent HAMP modifications offered to them. Nearly
one in ten borrowers in the random sample population is in this category. See App.
C. Ex. 13 at ¶ 31 & Table 4.



Borrowers who defaulted on their trial plan (at least 14% of the sample population)
and borrowers who did not return documents necessary for evaluating their eligibility
(at least 40% of the sample population). Id.



Borrowers who stopped making their mortgage payments, either during or after trial
periods. See Yacoubou v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 901 F. Supp. 2d 623, 636 (D. Md.
2012) (“no evidence of any quantifiable damages [plaintiff] suffered due to Wells
Fargo’s breach” because plaintiff “has not made any mortgage payments” “since
before this suit was filed”); Palacio v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 2012 WL 4928878, *6
(Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 4, 2012) (no damages where plaintiff “has not made a
mortgage payment since August 2008 and thus[] has lived in her home rent-free”).



Borrowers who received HAMP modifications, but after Plaintiffs say they should
have received them. See App. C. Ex. 13 at ¶¶ 48-51 (showing that “[t]here is no
damage to the borrower simply from having conversion to the permanent
modification occur at a date later than 3-4 months after beginning the TPP” because
the terms “are made retroactive to the contemplated effective date”).



Borrowers who subsequently received modifications (either HAMP or otherwise)
other than the HAMP modifications at issue here. See Legore, 898 F. Supp. 2d at 918
(finding that plaintiff “no longer has a claim for economic damages now that his loan
agreement has been permanently modified” under a subsequent agreement).



Borrowers who could not afford even a modified payment. See Gomes v. Bank of
Am., N.A., 2013 WL 2149743, *6 (D. Haw. May 15, 2013) (no harm to plaintiff
because “[n]othing in the record indicates that he would have been able to comply
with the terms of any loan modification offered him”).



Borrowers who did not experience foreclosures, negative credit reporting, or other
alleged grounds for damages (see TAC ¶ 538). See Nastrom v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., 2012 WL 5522795, *7 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2012) (“Plaintiffs also fail to
allege facts of an injury” from alleged promise of HAMP modification “as there is no
assertion that Defendants have foreclosed on their home”); Legore, 898 F. Supp. 2d at
918 (no damages from credit reporting absent “evidence that [plaintiff’s] credit scores
were detrimentally affected in a way that has resulted in economic damages”).

The litigation plan proposed by Plaintiffs simply is not a permissible way of adjudicating the
claims of a putative class that includes people with no injury—and would not be administratively

- 17 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 28 of 55

feasible even setting that defect aside. The striking thing about Plaintiffs’ motion is just how
very little they ultimately deem appropriate for class treatment and how much of the litigation
burden they leave for individual mini-trials. Even their list of purportedly “common liability
issues” amounts to 218 issues under the laws of 26 states. Dkt. #211-4. Once those 218 issues
are resolved, hearings on “individual damages claims” would occur that “would also resolve any
individual defense claimed by Defendant.” Dkt. #211 at 2. Judge Saris once remarked that
“[h]olding 11,000 individual damages trials in Part II is a management nightmare,” Pharm.
Indus. Wholesale Price, 230 F.R.D. at 95, but Plaintiffs here propose individual trials for a class
that allegedly “number[s] in the hundreds of thousands.” Pls. Ex. 13 ¶ 45.
III. PLAINTIFFS DO NOT SATISFY RULE 23(A).
A. There Is No Common Question of Law or Fact.
1. Commonality Is Defeated By the Necessity of Individualized Evidentiary
Inquiries Into Borrowers’ Performance Under TPPs.
One of the unusual features of Plaintiffs’ class definition is that it excludes borrowers
who failed to satisfy their obligations under the TPP to make trial payments, but does not
exclude borrowers who failed to satisfy other TPP obligations. Plaintiffs do not articulate any
basis for concluding that borrowers in the latter category have a claim if borrowers in the former
category do not, because there isn’t one. A party’s own performance under a contract is a
necessary condition for accusing the other party of breach. Amarin Plastics, Inc. v. Md. Cup
Corp., 946 F.2d 147, 151 (1st Cir. 1991); see also, e.g., LeBlanc v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2013 WL
3146829, *10 (W.D. Tenn. June 18, 2013) (“failure to fulfill the conditions of the TPP would
result in Bank of America having no liability”). Consequently, adjudicating Plaintiffs’ claims
will require individualized inquiries into whether each borrower satisfied their TPP obligations.

- 18 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 29 of 55

Such inquiries doomed class certification in Campusano v. BAC Home Loans Servicing
LP, 2013 WL 2302676 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2013). There, plaintiffs argued that claims for breach
of loan modification agreements could be adjudicated on a classwide basis because they were
based on standard form contracts, but the Court agreed with Bank of America that the alleged
standardization was irrelevant where the claims did not turn on the interpretation of contractual
terms, but on individualized examinations whether each borrower in fact satisfied those terms.
The Court found commonality lacking because the agreements “would lead to a host of
individual questions” such as, “Did both parties agree to this contract? Did this contract require
fulfillment of conditions precedent? Were those conditions fulfilled in this instance?” Id. at *6.
Rather than proposing a method to show that each class member fulfilled such conditions,
Plaintiffs simply assume it, declaring that “[a]ll class members performed their key duties.”
Mot. at 1. The “key duties” here include swearing to a legitimate hardship, making timely trial
payments, providing required documents, showing that the property is a principal residence,
completing credit counseling if required, and certifying that all of the documents and information
they have provided are true. App. A Ex. 10. Borrowers who fail to return documents, or whose
documents fail to substantiate the representations they made, have not performed their “key
duties” under the TPP and do not have a claim. Borrowers who may have converted their home
to a rental property, or who have not undergone required credit counseling, likewise did not
perform and have no claim. Whether these “key duties” have been performed in each case is
something Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing. They cannot do so by assuming what they
set out to prove. Nor can they do so by wishing those duties away, as when they state that “the
only remaining condition to satisfy was to timely make all required payments.” Mot. at 4.

- 19 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 30 of 55

Nor can Plaintiffs make the requisite showing without individualized documentary
evidence. See App. C Ex. 6 ¶¶ 22-31. In attempting to argue otherwise, Plaintiffs’ expert makes
a statement which is telling for what it leaves unsaid: that Bank of America has a database that
“can be queried to identify borrowers who had returned all necessary documents” (Pls. Ex. 13 ¶
64), as if the documentation requirements only exist as a gratuitous hoop to jump through and the
actual content of the documents is immaterial. In reality, the point of collecting documents is to
review them to assess eligibility. It is therefore impossible to assess a borrower’s eligibility
without a document review. See App. C Ex. 6 ¶ 25. Indeed, Plaintiffs base their motion on
allegations that the Moussas supplied the required documents but that Bank of America’s records
wrongly indicated otherwise. See Mot. at 10-11. When a claim is based on a discrepancy
between what borrowers say they supplied and what bank records indicate, it cannot be resolved
by reference to the electronic records alone. Only an intensive, manual review to confirm that
borrowers provided the required documents, and that the documents are sufficient to verify their
eligibility, can determine whether they performed under their TPPs. See, e.g., App. B ¶¶ 3-9.
2. Plaintiffs’ “Common Question” Cannot “Drive the Resolution of the Litigation.”
To satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs must identify “a
common contention” that “is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination
of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims
in one stroke.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011). The question
must be one that is “apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.” Id. Here, the supposed
“common question” Plaintiffs raise is “whether BoA breached their TPPs when it failed to
provide either a written denial or a permanent loan modification as of the Modification Effective
Date.” Mot. at 16. But this is not a question that can resolve the validity of each claim or drive
the resolution of the litigation, because resolving whether Bank of America “failed to provide
- 20 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 31 of 55

either a written denial or a permanent loan modification as of the Modification Effective Date” is
not enough to resolve “whether BoA breached their TPPs.” Id.
The most fundamental reason for this is that the TPPs do not actually promise that Bank
of America will send either a written denial or a permanent modification by the MED. See supra
at 5-6. Obviously, answering a question that will not actually determine the validity of any claim
cannot drive the resolution of those claims.12 But even if one were to indulge Plaintiffs’ legal
theory arguendo, the question they raise still cannot drive the resolution of the litigation due to
the disconnect between that theory and what their “common method” is capable of showing. In
ambiguously alleging an obligation to “provide” permanent modifications to eligible borrowers,
Plaintiffs conflate two different things: the offer of a modification, and its implementation.
Plaintiffs admit that Bank of America is not obligated to give every borrower who “complies
with the TPP’s written requirements” a permanent modification: it is required, at most, to “offer”
one. Pls. Ex. 13 ¶ 28. That is the theory on which Plaintiffs base their claims: that “upon
successful completion of the TPP, the Servicer must offer the homeowner a permanent
modification.” TAC ¶ 96. But Plaintiffs’ method for identifying class members does not even
try to identify who was not offered a modification; it is designed only to identify those who did

12

To whatever extent Plaintiffs believe HAMP guidelines impose obligations not reflected in
the contractual language, that is irrelevant to their claims. See Stovall, 2011 WL 4402680, at *12
(“The fact that she claims the letter itself did not comply with the HAMP guidelines is of no
matter as she is precluded from bringing a private right of action to enforce the HAMP
guidelines.”); Senter, 810 F. Supp. 2d, at 1339 (because “[t]he TPP Agreements do not explicitly
incorporate the terms of the HAMP Guidelines,” “the Court need not look to the HAMP . . .
Supplemental [D]irectives[] to ascertain the meaning of the contractual terms of the TPP
Agreements”); Shaw v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 2013 WL 789195, *4 (D. Mass. Mar. 1,
2013) (dismissing claim based on allegations that plaintiff “has a breach of contract claim against
BAC because it failed to follow HAMP program guidelines”); Bassie v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2012
WL 6530482, *3 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 13, 2012) (“breach of contract claim . . . premised upon alleged
violations of HAMP guidelines[] must be dismissed”).
- 21 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 32 of 55

not receive an “implementation.” Pls. Ex. 13 ¶ 79.13 The distinction is critical, because, as their
expert admits, it results in Plaintiffs’ including borrowers in their putative class who had
permanent modifications offered to them but did not accept the offers (and thus have no claim
for breach under Plaintiffs’ theory). App. C Ex. 14 at 80:5-16. Plaintiffs also include in their
class borrowers who did accept the offer and whose implementation is allegedly “untimely” only
because the borrower’s acceptance was untimely. App. C Ex. 6 ¶ 33. Resolving the supposed
“common question” whether borrowers received either a written denial or an implemented
modification without addressing whether modifications were offered and timely accepted will
not determine the validity of a single claim, and thus cannot drive the resolution of the litigation.
Even if Plaintiffs revised their method to base class membership on offers rather than
implementations, it still would not advance the litigation because Plaintiffs concede they have no
common method for determining whether a borrower was entitled to an offer. See App. C Ex. 14
at 39:9-16 (“Q. Did you make an effort to identify borrowers to whom the bank was required to
offer a permanent modification? A. No. . . .”). Without any means of distinguishing those who
were entitled to an offer from those who did not receive offers due to their own failure to
perform, it is impossible to assess who has a claim and who does not. See supra Part III.A.1.
3. Commonality Is Defeated By Material Differences in Applicable State Law.
Plaintiffs concede there are material differences among the 26 states’ laws applicable to
their claims (Dkt. #211 at 3). It is well-established that if Plaintiffs were seeking to certify a
13

Notably, however, while Plaintiffs rely on HAMP guidelines rather than actual contractual
language to establish Bank of America’s contractual obligations, HAMP guidelines do not
support this legal theory. See, e.g., Lucia, 798 F. Supp. 2d, at 1068-69 (“HAMP only requires
participating servicers to consider eligible loans for modification, but does not require servicers
to modify eligible loans.”) (citing Williams v. Geithner, 2009 WL 3757380, *6 (D. Minn. Nov. 9,
2009) (noting the “Congressional intent to afford discretion in the decision whether to modify
loans” and observing that “regulations promulgated by Treasury for administering the HAMP
clearly demonstrate that the Secretary allowed the exercise of some discretion, including
calculation of the NPV, to the servicers”)).
- 22 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 33 of 55

single class governed by 26 states’ laws, the need to “examine the laws of each state where
putative class members’ contracts were entered into” would “alone present[] an impediment to
certification.”14 Plaintiffs cannot end-run this rule by seeking 26 separate classes, because the
administrative challenge of applying 26 states’ laws is the same whether there are 26 classes or a
single class, particularly given Plaintiffs’ plan for this Court to apply the law of all 26 states in
summary judgment proceedings and conduct trials for the twelve class states with no remand
court. See Dkt. #211 at 2 & n.2; In re M3 Power Razor Sys. Mktg. & Sales Prac. Litig., 270
F.R.D. 45, 57-58 (D. Mass. 2010) (“Certification of subclasses . . . must continue to facilitate the
operation of the class action”) (citing Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1262 (11th Cir.
2004) (court “must be careful not to certify too many groups” because applying or instructing the
jury on the applicable law would be an “impossible task”)).
Plaintiffs try to downplay the extent of the state-law differences, but the vast universe of
case law involving similar claims shows that the differences are material and case-dispositive:


This Court previously held that lack of consideration for Plaintiffs’ TPPs did not
mandate dismissal of their claims under Massachusetts law, deferring decisions on
other states’ laws. Dkt. #66 at 8 n.3. But courts applying the law of other class states
have reached the opposite result. E.g., Karapetyan v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
2012 WL 3308883, *3-4 (E.D. Tex. June 6, 2012); Citimortgage, Inc. v. Crawford,
2013 WL 1225387, *4-5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 26, 2013).



As noted above, in Young, the First Circuit held, in a case governed by Massachusetts
law, that the plaintiff had stated a claim on the theory that she was entitled to a
permanent modification because “she performed all of her obligations under the
TPP.” But Lucia, 798 F. Supp. 2d at 1069, and Thomas, 811 F. Supp. 2d at 796,
reached the opposite result under California and New Jersey law, respectively.

that plaintiffs had stated a claim under Massachusetts law on the theory that “TPPs

barred a statute-of-frauds defense under Illinois law. Krouse, 2011 WL 6100406, at
*4, reached the opposite conclusion under California law, finding that the plaintiffs’
performance of “only the monthly TPP payments and the production of financial
documents” was not “a sufficient change in position to bar the statute of frauds.”



Ramirez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2011 WL 1585075, *4-5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 27,
2011), sustained a claim for breach of contract based on allegations of “oral
representations . . . that defendant would modify the loan.” But courts applying
Texas law, Montalvo v. Bank of America Corp., 864 F. Supp. 2d 567, 581-82 (W.D.
Tex. 2012), and Ohio law, Nachar v. PNC Bank, N.A., 901 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1018
(N.D. Ohio 2012), rejected claims based on oral agreements to modify loans.



Nash v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 2013 WL 1867357, *4 (E.D. Va. May 2, 2013),
held that the plaintiff need not have received a fully executed TPP to state a breachof-contract claim under Virginia law. But Stovall held that plaintiff’s “fail[ure] to
allege that she received a fully executed copy of the [TPP] “completely eviscerate[s]”
her breach-of-contract claim under Maryland law. 2011 WL 4402680, at *12.



Durmic v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, NA., 2010 WL 4825632, *4 (D. Mass. Nov. 24,
2010), rejected the argument that TPPs “lack material terms and constitute, at most, a
contingent agreement to attempt to come to an agreement in the future.” Nadan, 2011
WL 3584213, at *6, and Pace, 2013 WL 55825, at *3, reached the opposite result
under California and Georgia law, respectively.

Plaintiffs also assert UDAP claims under 20 state laws with vastly different elements and
defenses. In some states, plaintiffs must establish the “intent to deceive,” Dix v. American
Bankers Life Assur. Co., 415 N.W.2d 206, 209 (Mich. 1987); elsewhere, “[i]ntent to deceive
need not be proved.” State v. O’Neill Investigations, Inc., 609 P.2d 520, 535 (Alas 1980). Most
states require an “ascertainable loss of money or property,” ALAS. STAT. § 45.50.531(a); KY.
REV. ST. § 367.220(1); MO. REV. ST. § 407.025(1), or “pecuniary loss,” WIS. STAT. §
100.18(11)(b)(2); in New York, “pecuniary harm” is “not necessar[y].” Stutman v. Chem. Bank,
731 N.E.2d 608, 612 (N.Y. 2000). Some states permit recovery of “actual damages,” KY. REV.
ST. § 367.220(1), but in California, “damages cannot be recovered” and a plaintiff is limited to

- 24 -

“restitution” of “money or property in which he or she has a vested interest.” Kor. Supply Co. v.
Lockheed Martin Corp., 63 P.3d 937, 943, 947 (Cal. 2003). In HAMP cases, UDAP claims have
also been dismissed because they are not “sufficiently independent of HAMP” to evade the rule
that private litigants cannot sue to enforce HAMP guidelines,15 or because the failure of
common-law claims leaves plaintiffs without the requisite “predicate violation for a UCL claim.”
Jones v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 2013 WL 1704304, *12 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2013).
4. The UDAP and Other Common Law Claims Are Inherently Individualized.
Plaintiffs argue that their UDAP claims present common issues because “[m]any” of the
statutes have “objective criteria bearing on whether BoA’s actions with regard to TPPs were
‘unfair.’” Mot. at 17. Even if one sets aside the substantive differences in each state’s law, the
“objective criteria” in the statutes is irrelevant without a common glue uniting “BoA’s actions.”
Plaintiffs do not challenge standard language in every TPP, but rather individual borrowers’
outcomes based on what they did to perform under the TPP, what documents Bank of America
required them to provide, how Bank of America handled those documents, and how Bank of
America communicated with them. Put simply, any claim that Bank of America treated a
borrower “unfairly,” or in breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, cannot be
resolved without evidence of exactly how that borrower was treated. See Ramos v. Bank of Am.,
N.A., 2012 WL 1999867, *3-5 (D. Md. June 4, 2012) (“[E]very factual allegation in support of a
potential [Maryland CPA] claim must be grounded in Defendants’ actual conduct pursuant to the

2012 WL 760776, *2 (D. Nev. Mar. 8, 2012); Keosseian v. Bank of Am., 2012 WL 458470, *2

TPP.”). Consequently, such borrower-specific evidence has often been dispositive in whether
UDAP and fair-dealing claims in individual HAMP cases are dismissed or survive dismissal.16
Plaintiffs address only one aspect of the necessary analysis, arguing that reliance can be
assessed on a class-wide basis. Mot. at 20. This argument is foreclosed by the fact that
circumstances specific to individual borrowers have negated reliance in individual cases, e.g.,
Anderson v. PHH Mortg., 2012 WL 4496341, *3-4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2012); DeLeon v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., 2011 WL 311376, *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2011), thus can negate reliance for
individual members of the putative class here. Reliance is also an element of a promissory
estoppel claim, which numerous courts, e.g., Reitz v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 2013 WL
16

Compare, e.g., Young, 2013 WL 2165262, at *10 (dismissing claim for breach of covenant of
good faith and fair dealing based on plaintiff’s servicing history, even while declining to dismiss
breach-of-contract claim); Spaulding v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 714 F.3d 769, 771 (4th Cir.
2013) (affirming dismissal of Maryland CPA claim where appellant did not show reliance or
“suffer[] damages,” and because servicer did not misrepresent need for more documents);
Laguer v. OneWestBank, FSB, 2013 WL 831055, at *9 (Mass. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 2013)
(dismissing Ch. 93A claim because “[it] was not unfair . . . for OneWest to deny Laguer’s loan
modification requests after Laguer failed to respond” to document requests); Gomez, 2012 WL
929790 at *8-9 (dismissing UTPA claim where plaintiffs failed to “allege that the denial of a
permanent loan modification resulted in any harm to them”), with, e.g., Cave v. Saxon Mortg.
Servs., Inc., 2013 WL 1915660, at *10 (E.D. Pa. May 9, 2013) (denying dismissal of UTPCPL
claim based on servicer’s “representations to Plaintiffs after their trial periods ended, in assuring
them that they were still in trial periods and giving them erroneous and misleading information”
and evidence “that Plaintiffs relied on, and were deterred from seeking other remedies based on,”
those representations); McGann, 2013 WL 1337204, at *9 (denying dismissal of Illinois CFA
claim because plaintiff “detail[ed] specific instances” of conversations with PNC representatives
in which they “misrepresent[ed] whether [the servicer] would approve” the HAMP
modification); Whitmer v. CitiMortgage Inc., 2012 WL 6677785, *4 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 21, 2012)
(denying dismissal of CFA claim given that “[t]he complaint carefully details the specific
employees of defendant plaintiff spoke with . . . and what they told her”); Speleos v. BAC Home
Loans Serv., L.P., 2013 WL 1442336, *8 (D. Mass. Mar. 28, 2013) (denying summary judgment
on Ch. 93A claim based on “factual dispute as to whether, financially, the plaintiffs could have
made their monthly mortgage payments if their loan was modified”); Neal v. Residential Credit
Solutions, Inc., 2013 WL 428675, *4 (D. Md. Feb. 1, 2013) (denying summary judgment on
CPA claim based on allegations plaintiffs were “given false information . . . on which they relied
to their detriment” and “forewent an opportunity to refinance their mortgage”); Marchese v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2013 WL 136427, *11 (D. Md. Jan. 8, 2013) (denying dismissal of
CPA claim based on “myriad oral or written statements”).

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 37 of 55

3282875, *16 (E.D. Mo. June 27, 2013); White v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2013 WL
3071894, *4 (D. Md. June 17, 2013), have dismissed based on the plain language of the TPPs
and thus require individualized evidence of other representations to establish reliance.
5. Unsupported and Untruthful Declarations Signed by a Few Former Employees
and Contractors Do Not Demonstrate Commonality.
Plaintiffs submit several declarations nominally attributed to former employees and
contractors of Bank of America accusing the bank of a wide variety of intentional misconduct. It
is unclear what purpose Plaintiffs intend these declarations to serve other than being prejudicial
and inflammatory, since they would do absolutely nothing to demonstrate that this case warrants
class certification even if they were credible—and they are not credible. See supra at 10-11.
That is because none of the declarants claim, nor are they in a position to claim, personal
involvement with every class member’s loan, nor even a significant proportion of them. Any
claims they make about how they mistreated loans they handled, even if credited, cannot be used
to support conclusions about other loans. Thus, Plaintiffs’ insinuation that Bank of America
should be presumed to have subjected the entire class to a particular treatment just because a
former employee (falsely) claims to have treated some borrowers in that fashion is directly
analogous to the theory rejected by numerous courts in the wake of Wal-Mart that the way one
employee exercises his or her discretion can be extrapolated to support conclusions about the
whole class. E.g., Barrett v. Option One Mortg. Corp., 2012 WL 4076465, *3 (D. Mass. Sept.
18, 2012) (Zobel, J.) (decertifying class where plaintiffs “do not claim that all of [defendant’s
employees] exercised their discretion in the same way”) (citing Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554).
Plaintiffs challenge thousands of individual decisions. Commonality thus requires “some
glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552.
But the declarations do not establish any glue that unites them all. For example, Plaintiffs cite a

- 27 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 38 of 55

declarant’s claim that “BoA cleaned out its HAMP backlog with a ‘blitz’ in which each ‘team’
declined hundreds of files at a time.” Mot. at 7. The allegation is irrelevant because the
declarant claims he “began” to witness this after July 2011, Pls. Ex. 1 ¶¶ 4, 9, well beyond the
relevant period. The allegation is also irrelevant because Plaintiffs do not claim that any of their
own files went through a “blitz,” nor identify any loans that went through it—much less show
that every class member went through it. See Campusano, 2013 WL 2302676 at *7 (rejecting
theory “that BOA’s ‘uniform systemic practices’ fulfill the commonality requirement” where
“Plaintiffs have not submitted any evidence of even a single case in which these processes”
affected a class member; “Without any evidence linking the purported common conduct . . . to
the alleged harms suffered by the class (the breaches of the loan modification agreements), the
common conduct cannot allow the Court to resolve the claims of [the] class ‘in one stroke’”).
B. Plaintiffs Are Not Typical of the Purported Class.
The same factors that defeat commonality for the putative class defeat typicality for the
Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs who failed to perform under their TPPs (e.g., Cipowski, Cabrera, Goldman,
McManaman, Morrow & Clerk, Kirkpatrick, Balde, Hlavsa) cannot be typical of a class that
must establish performance to state a claim. Plaintiffs who failed to make timely trial payments
(e.g., George, Nelson) cannot be typical of a class whose very definition excludes such
borrowers. Plaintiffs who have no damages (e.g., Carillo, Nelson, Magno, Balde, Cabrera,
Galasso, Kunsky, Kirkpatrick) cannot be typical of a class that must show damages as an
element of their claims. See Gaines v. Boston Herald, Inc., 998 F. Supp. 91, 97-98 (D. Mass.
1998) (to show typicality, “Plaintiffs must show that they themselves have been injured, not
merely that an injury has been suffered by members of a class to which they belong”).
A plaintiff’s claim is typical if it “arises from the same event or practice or course of
conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and if his or her claims are based on
- 28 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 39 of 55

the same legal theory.” Pharm. Indus. Wholesale Price, , 230 F.R.D. at 78. Neither is true of the
Plaintiffs’ claims here. They do not arise from a singular “event” or “course of conduct” because
there is no singular event or course of conduct: this case challenges thousands of decisions made
for thousands of different reasons. And there is no single legal theory uniting the class as a
whole or the named Plaintiffs. Borrowers claiming an entitlement to a HAMP modification
plainly have a different theory of recovery than borrowers who admit they were properly denied
but merely challenge the timeliness of their rejections.
Finally, a plaintiff “cannot be considered typical” when “subject to unique defenses that
would divert attention from the common claims of the class.” In re Bank of Boston Corp. Sec.
Litig., 762 F. Supp. 1525, 1532 (D. Mass. 1991).

Many Plaintiffs (e.g., George, Dugree,

Mikhail) are subject to the defense that they failed to mitigate damages by refusing other
modifications after they did not qualify for HAMP. See Monroe v. Hughes, 1990 WL 267361,
*3 (D. Or. Dec. 18, 1990) (typicality defeated by failure to mitigate damages); accord Cerdant,
Inc. v. DHL Express (USA), Inc., 2010 WL 3397501, *8-9 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 25, 2010); Leshin v.
St. Charles Pontiac, Inc., 1997 WL 587678, *4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 18, 1997). Plaintiffs who failed
to make TPP payments (e.g., George, Nelson) or failed to satisfy other TPP obligations (e.g.,
George, Cipowski, Cabrera, Goldman, McManaman, Morrow and Clark) are subject to the
defense that their non-performance defeats their claims.

Plaintiffs who rely on “oral”

representations (e.g., Hlavsa) are subject to statute-of-frauds defenses. See Nachar, 901 F. Supp.
at 1018. Plaintiffs who allege incorrect credit reporting are subject to the defense that their
claims are preempted by federal law. See Miller v. Bank of Am., N.A., 858 F. Supp. 2d 1118,
1124 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (“UCL claim [predicated] on allegations that . . . BAC reported inaccurate
information to the credit reporting agencies” preempted by Fair Credit Reporting Act). Plaintiffs

- 29 -

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 221 Filed 07/12/13 Page 40 of 55

who entered into TPPs with entities other than Bank of America (e.g., Alvarenga, Freeman, Hall,
Volpe) are not only subject to a unique factual defense, but are outside the class definition.
IV.

PLAINTIFFS DO NOT SATISFY RULE 23(B).
As set forth supra Part II, predominance is defeated by Plaintiffs’ failure to show that the

mere fact of damages can be established classwide (cf. Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1433), and by the
substantial portion of this litigation they admit will need to be adjudicated in individual minitrials.17 Rule 23(b)(3) also requires Plaintiffs to show that a class action is a superior method for
adjudicating their claims, a conclusion foreclosed by the hundreds of plaintiffs who litigated
such claims individually. Some even come within Plaintiffs’ class definition, which is fatal to
superiority. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3)(B) (consideration of “the extent and nature of any
litigation concerning the controversy already begun by . . . class members”).
Finally, it is significant that Plaintiffs’ claims are based so heavily on allegations of noncompliance with Treasury guidelines.

Even if such allegations were true, that is an issue

between Bank of America and Treasury, not between Bank of America and Plaintiffs. Contract
claims on behalf of individual borrowers are not a superior means of adjudicating alleged
violations of supervisory guidelines. Cf. London v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 340 F.3d 1246, 1255
n.5 (11th Cir. 2003) (expressing “doubt” about superiority where claims are based on alleged
“failure to follow the requirements of a complex regulatory scheme, subject to different
reasonable interpretations”). For all the above reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied.

17

Plaintiffs suggest that their class can also be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) (see Mot. at 16
n.66), but this argument is waived by their failure to address any of the Rule’s requirements, see
In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 252 F.R.D. 83, 106 (D. Mass. 2008), and
foreclosed on the merits by their failure to identify any injunctive relief that would “benefit[] all
[class] members at once.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558.

CASE LAW REJECTING INDIVIDUAL HAMP CLAIMS
CASES HOLDING THAT PERFORMANCE UNDER TPPs DOES NOT CONFER A
CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO A PERMANENT MODIFICATION
Reitz v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC,
2013 WL 3282875, *10 (E.D. Mo.
June 27, 2013)

“[U]pon review of the initial TPP offer letter, the TPP
Agreement itself, and the HAMP Guidelines, it is clear
that the loan servicer (the defendant) is given discretion
in providing a loan modification. . . . Plaintiff fails to
point to any statement in any document which clearly
states that simply by making the payments and providing
information automatically qualified her for a loan
modification.”

White v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., 2013 WL 2071894, *4 (D. Md.
June 17, 2013)

“Th[e] language [in plaintiffs’ TPP] contradicts
Plaintiffs’ averments that timely payment of the reduced
TPP amounts was the sole action necessary to
contractually bind Chase to finalize their loan
modification. Finalization of Plaintiffs’ loan
modification was clearly conditional. . . . As a result,
Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim must be
dismissed. . . .”

Fed’l Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v.
Hassell, 2013 WL 823241, *5-6
(E.D. Mich. Mar. 6, 2013)

“Plaintiff . . . claims that the Trial Plan and the Partial
Reinstatement Agreement are binding contracts; that the
purported contracts required Wells Fargo to modify her
mortgage loan once she complied with its terms; that she
did comply with all its terms; and that Wells Fargo
breached the contracts when it failed to modify her
mortgage loan. The Court is not persuaded by Plaintiff’s
theory.”

Burr v. JP Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A., 2012 WL 1059043, *4 (S.D.
Tex. Mar. 28, 2012)

“[E]ven if the Burrs fulfilled all of their obligations under
the TPP as alleged in the Complaint, the TPP does not
guarantee the permanent modification of the Burrs’ loan
or obligate Defendants to modify the loan. The TPP
requires certain events to occur prior to the modification
and makes the modification dependent upon the
discretion of the Defendants.”

making timely payments and fulfilling the TPP document
requirements.”
Stolba v. Wells Fargo & Co., 2011
WL 3444078, *3 (D.N.J. Aug. 8,
2011)

“[T]he plain language of the relevant TPP documents

permanent modification does not guarantee that Plaintiff
would receive such modification.”

Prasad v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing LP, 2010 WL 5090331,
*2-4 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2010)

“[The TPP] makes clear that providing the requested
documents was simply a part of the application process,
which plaintiff was willing to complete in the hope that
BAC would modify his loan. Under the language of
Exhibit 2, a binding modification would not result unless
and until BAC determined that plaintiff complied with
the requirements. If BAC so determined, then it would
send plaintiff a modification agreement, including a new
monthly payment amount, which both plaintiff and
defendant would execute. Plaintiff has not alleged or
provided exhibits (1) that BAC determined plaintiff had
met the requirements, or (2) that BAC sent plaintiff a
loan modification with a new monthly payment that was
then executed by both plaintiff and BAC. As such, no
binding contract has been alleged. . . .”

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v.
Ilardo, 940 N.Y.S.2d 829, 840-41
(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2012)

“The Ilardos’ claims that the TPP was a binding contract
and the [servicer] breached it by failing to offer a
permanent modification after the Ilardos successfully
performed are rejected as unmeritorious. . . . [A]ny
permanent modification [was] subject to the subsequent
approval of Chase. . . .”

Brown v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 2011

“[T]he Plan states explicitly that modification is not

Geske v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
2012 WL 1231835, *6 (N.D. Tex.
Apr. 12, 2012)

“Because of . . . the discretion given to lenders under
TPPs in deciding whether to provide borrowers with an
executed Modification Agreement, courts have almost
uniformly concluded that TPPs are not enforceable
contracts based solely on a plaintiff's compliance with the
terms of the TPP.”

Ortiz v. America’s Servicing Co.,
2012 WL 2160953, *4 (C.D. Cal.
Jun. 11, 2012)

“[A] binding contract does not exist unless and until ASC
determined that plaintiff complied with the requirements
[of the TPP]. . . . Because plaintiff has not alleged that
defendants approved her for a permanent modification,
no binding contract was ever created.”

Pineda v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 2012
WL 2070317, *4 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 8,
2012)

“Defendant agreed to consider Plaintiffs’ request for a
loan modification, but it did not agree to provide one. . . .
[T]he [TPP] gave Defendant the discretion to determine
whether Plaintiffs qualified for a loan modification.
There is no indication that Defendant reached such a
determination.”

Bohnhoff v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
853 F. Supp. 2d 849, 854-55 (D.
Minn. 2012)

“[A] contract was not formed, because no offer to modify
was present. . . . [T]he TPP specifically stated that it was
‘not a modification of the Loan Documents.’ In other
words, the TPP is an offer to consider modification,
expressly conditioned on continued trial payments (for
three months or longer) and other criteria. . . . As a
result, no contract formed.”

Billingsley v. OneWest Bank, FSB,
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95118, *3-4
(D. Minn. July 9, 2013)

“[C]ourts in this district have consistently rejected
borrowers’ claims that lenders breached a Home
Affordable Modification Trial Period Plan when the
lenders did not permanently modify mortgages because
no enforceable contract to permanently modify the
mortgage was formed. . . . The Court concludes that

CASES HOLDING TPPs UNENFORCEABLE AS INDEFINITE “AGREEMENTS TO
AGREE”
Senter v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., 810 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1351
(S.D. Fla. 2011)

“Since the TPP Agreements are indefinite and uncertain
as to material terms of the permanent loan modifications,
such agreements represent, at best, unenforceable
agreements to agree that do not rise to the level of a valid
contract.”

Salvador v. Bank of Am., N.A., 456
B.R. 610, 617-19 (Bankr. M.D. Ga.
2011)

“It is clear from the terms of the TPP Agreement that the
document is nothing more than an agreement to negotiate
further with respect to the terms of a proposed loan
modification.”

Juarez v. SunTrust Mortg., Inc.,
2013 WL 1983111, *17 (E.D. Cal.
May 13, 2013)

“The trial plan did not obligate [defendant] to provide a
permanent modification, which was to be agreed upon
and executed separately from the trial plan.”

Pace v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 2013
WL 55825, *3 (M.D. Ga. Jan. 3,
2013)

“[A]lleged agreement to offer a permanent modification
of unspecified terms—such as interest rate, monthly
payment amount, principal, and loan maturity date— . . .
lacks a ‘meeting of the minds as to all essential terms’
and is unenforceable.”

Nadan v. Homesales, Inc., 2011 WL
3584213, *6 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 12,
2011)

“[A] purported agreement to modify the Nadans’ loan in
the future [is] an unenforceable ‘agreement to agree’
given the TPP’s absence of ‘essential terms of the
purported permanent modifications.’”

Reitz v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC,
2013 WL 3282875, *14 (E.D. Mo.
June 27, 2013)

“The nature and timing of the permanent loan agreement
is left undetermined as the TPP Agreement fails to
establish any of the terms governing the potential
permanent loan modification. The TPP Agreement is
indefinite and uncertain as to the essential terms of a
permanent loan modification, therefore, it fails to rise to
the level of a valid enforceable contract under Missouri
law.”

CASES HOLDING TPPs UNENFORCEABLE FOR LACK OF CONSIDERATION
Karapetyan v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., 2012 WL 3308883, *4
(E.D. Tex. June 6, 2012) (citations
omitted)

“Plaintiffs argue that the three payments that Plaintiffs
made pursuant to the TPP constitute valid consideration.
The Court disagrees. This is not new consideration under
Texas law. . . . The borrower making three trial-periodplan payments and submitting financial information was
not new consideration that would support the trial period
plan because the borrower was already contractually
obligated make payments and provide financial
information under the deed of trust. . . . Thus, Plaintiffs
cannot rely upon the TPP to create a binding contractual
obligation to enter into a permanent loan modification.”

Rackley v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., 2011 WL 2971357, *4 (W.D.
Tex. July 21, 2011)

“[A]n agreement to do what one is already bound to do
generally cannot serve as sufficient consideration to
support a contract modification. Plaintiff was already
obligated to disclose to JPMC his financial information
under his original loan document, and his payments both
during and after the Modification Effective Date went
toward that loan's debt. Consequently, no new
consideration supported Plaintiff's TPP sufficient to make
it an enforceable contract to modify his loan with JPMC.”

CitiMortgage, Inc. v. Crawford,
2013 WL 1225387, *5 (S.D. Ohio
Mar. 26, 2013)

“[Borrowers] have not adequately alleged consideration,
as neither the TPP payments nor [their] submission of
documents are sufficient. A promise ‘to pay a sum less
than that which [a party] was already obligated to pay’ is
not consideration. Consequently, the submission of TPP
payments does not qualify as consideration, as
Defendants already owed Plaintiff significantly more
under the terms of their mortgage. Similarly, the
‘submission of . . . documentation’ is not consideration.”

Reitz v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC,
2013 WL 3282875, *13 (E.D. Mo.
June 27, 2013)

“[T]he Court finds that the plaintiff’s TPP payments and
provision of financial information does not constitute
sufficient consideration for the TPP Agreement to qualify
as a binding contract between the parties entitling the
plaintiff to a modified loan mortgage.”

Graybill v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
2013 WL 978245, *15 (N.D. Cal.
Mar. 12, 2013)

“[T]he Graybills allege that they submitted information
to Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo agreed to consider that
information according to certain procedures, and they
applied in consideration for Wells Fargo’s promises to
consider their application. Unlike the cases where
Plaintiffs forego other financing options or pay a filing
fee, nothing in the FAC supports a plausible inference
that Plaintiffs provided any consideration.”

CASES HOLDING TPPs UNENFORCEABLE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SIGNED
BY BOTH PARTIES
Brinson v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2013
WL 147835, *5 (D. Alaska Jan. 13,
2013)

“Because BOA never sent plaintiff a signed copy of the
TPP, the court cannot conclude that BOA intended to be
bound, and thus the TPP never ripened into an offer.”

Goss v. ABN AMRO Mortg. Grp.,
LLC, 2012 WL 5986783, *7 (E.D.
Mich. Nov. 29, 2012)

“Defendant did not sign the Trial Period Plan. Thus, the
loan modification offer [plaintiff] signed ‘did not ripen
into a binding agreement, primarily because [it] bears
only [his] signature, and therefore, does not objectively
reflect a meeting of the minds regarding the essential
modification terms.’”

Fed’l Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v.
Hassell, 2013 WL 823241, *7 (E.D.
Mich. Mar. 6, 2013)

“It is beyond dispute that Wells Fargo did not sign the
Trial Plan. Thus, the loan modification proposal
[plaintiff] signed ‘did not ripen into a binding
agreement. . . .’”

Heikkinen v. Bank of Am., N.A.,
2012 WL 628608, *6 (E.D. Mich.
Feb. 27, 2012) (quoting Voydanoff v.
Select Portfolio Serv., Inc., 2011 WL
6757841, *7 (Mich. Ct. App. Dec.
22, 2011))

“[S]imilar to the plaintiff in Voydanoff, Plaintiff here
cannot establish a claim that Defendants breached an
agreement to modify her mortgage loan. It is undisputed
that Defendants did not sign the TPP. Thus, the loan
modification proposal she signed ‘did not ripen into a
binding agreement, primarily because [it] bears only [the
plaintiff]’s signature, and therefore, does not objectively
reflect a meeting of the minds regarding the essential
modification terms.’”

Avevedo v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 2012
WL 3134222, *8 (N.D. Ill. July 25,
2012)

“The offer to modify the plaintiffs’ loan was . . . not
binding unless and until CitiMortgage executed the TTP
and returned it to the plaintiffs. This never happened.
Thus, CitiMortgage was not required to modify the
plaintiffs’ loan, assuming that the plaintiffs held up their
end of the bargain.”

Krouse v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing, LP, 2011 WL 6100406,
*4 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2011)

“[P]laintiffs have submitted a copy of the TPP signed by
them only. . . . Plaintiffs have failed as a matter of law to
allege facts sufficient to establish that they entered into a
contract to permanently modify the terms of their loan.”
“Defendants contend that they never executed the TPP
agreement, and therefore the contract is unenforceable
under the statute of frauds. . . . [B]ecause the statute of
frauds applies, and no claimed exception to the statute
have been properly alleged or pled, Plaintiffs' breach of
written contract claim is dismissed.”

Stovall v. SunTrust Mortg., Inc.,
2011 WL 4402680, *12 (D. Md.
Sept. 20, 2011)

“Stovall’s conclusory assertion that SunTrust breached
the TPP Agreement by failing to extend a permanent loan
modification . . . is completely eviscerated by the fact
that she never received a fully executed copy of the
document, and was ultimately sent ‘a letter . . . informing
her that she had been denied for a loan modification.’”

Nungaray v. Litton Loan Servicing,
LP, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 442, 447 (Cal.
Ct. App. 2011)

“As a matter of law, there was no contract [where] . . .
[n]either Litton nor the Bank executed the Plan nor did
they prepare, execute, and forward a permanent
modification agreement.”

Morales v. Chase Home Fin. LLC,
2011 WL 1670045, *6 (N.D. Cal.
Apr. 11, 2011)

“Plaintiffs fail to allege . . . that they have met all the
conditions set forth in the TPP Contract for loan
modification, including receipt of a ‘fully executed copy
of a Modification Agreement,’ and therefore fail to allege
the existence of a binding contract regarding a permanent
loan modification.”

Herold v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 2011 WL
4072029, *2 (D. Ariz. Sept. 13,
2011)

“Even assuming a TPP could be an enforceable
contract, . . . neither plaintiff nor defendants ever signed
this document. Therefore, the TPP was merely an offer.”

CASES HOLDING THAT BORROWERS HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO A
PERMANENT MODIFICATION BECAUSE THE TPP EXPRESSLY MAKES THE
RIGHT CONTINGENT ON THE SERVICER’S SENDING A FULLY EXECUTED
PERMANENT MODIFICATION AGREEMENT
Pennington v. HSBC Bank USA,
N.A., 493 F. App’x 548, 554 (5th
Cir. 2012)

“The Penningtons’ claim for breach of the TPP fails for
a[] . . . basic reason: . . . The TPP expressly requires that
before the contract is final, the lender must send a signed
copy to the borrower. The Penningtons never alleged
that they received such a signed copy.”

Cal. 2011)

“Plaintiffs fail to allege, however, that they have met all
the conditions set forth in the TPP Contract for loan
modification, including receipt of a ‘fully executed copy

the existence of a binding contract regarding a permanent
loan modification.”

McGann v. PNC Bank, N.A., 2013
WL 1337204, *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29,
2013)

“[T]he plain language of the TPP Agreement states PNC
is not obligated to provide a HAMP loan modification
until both parties execute the TPP Agreement. . . .
Because PNC never executed and returned the [TPP], it
had no obligation to offer McGann a permanent HAMP
loan modification pursuant to the TPP Agreement.”

Helmus v. Chase Home Fin., LLC,
890 F. Supp. 2d 806, 815 (W.D.
Mich. 2012)

“By its plain terms, the TPP makes it clear that it was not
an offer, and would not become binding on Chase until
the contract was signed and returned to Plaintiffs, which
it was not. As a result, there was no offer for Plaintiffs to
accept.”

Thomas v. JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
811 F. Supp. 2d 781, 796 (S.D.N.Y.
2011)

“Plaintiffs’ claim . . . is contradicted by the express terms
of the TPP agreements, which state that any permanent
modification is subject to the subsequent approval of
Chase, and the receipt of a signed modification
agreement. . . . [P]laintiffs clearly never received a ‘fully
executed copy of the Modification Agreement.’”

Lund v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 2011
WL 1873690, *2 (D. Utah May 17,
2011)

“[The TPP] makes clear . . . that the modification would
not be made permanent until, among other things,
Plaintiffs received a fully executed copy of a
modification agreement.”

Pandit v. Saxon Mortg. Servs., Inc.,
2012 WL 4174888, *4-5 (E.D.N.Y.
Sept. 17, 2012)

“[T]he TPP cautioned borrowers that their loan would not
be modified unless, prior to the Modification Effective
Date, the Lender provided them with fully executed
copies of both the TPP and a Modification Agreement.
Defendant never provided Plaintiffs with executed copies
of either document.”

Brady v. Chase Home Fin., LLC,
2012 WL 1900606, *7 (W.D. Mich.
May 24, 2012)

“In the instant case, the TPP provided that the plan would
not take effect until Chase signed and returned a copy of
the TPP to Brady. Because Chase never sent Brady a
copy of a fully-executed TPP, the TPP never ripened into
an offer that Brady could accept. Accordingly, Brady
fails to state a breach of contract claim.”

Aug. 10, 2012)

“Pursuant to the language contained in the TPP, . . . the

countersigned the TPP. . . .”

Nachar v. PNC Bank Nat’l Ass’n,
901 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1019 (N.D.
Ohio 2012)

“[B]y its plain language, [the TPP] indicates that it is not
an offer of a permanent modification. The [TPP]
specifically states that it is not a modification of the Loan
documents, and further stipulates that if the Servicer does
not provide a fully executed copy of the [TPP] and
separate Modification Agreement, the Loan documents
will not be modified and the [TPP] will terminate. Prior
to expiration of the trial period, PNC . . . did not send
Plaintiff or John Nachar an executed copy of the [TPP] or
a separate Modification Agreement. As such, Plaintiff
has failed to establish the existence of a contract pursuant
to the [TPP], since it was not an offer of permanent
modification.”

Rummell v. Vantium Capital, Inc.,
Plaintiffs’ TPP stated that it would “‘not take effect

Lender's signature.’ Defendant CitiMortgage never
signed the 2009 TPP and never returned a signed copy to
Plaintiffs. Therefore, . . . the 2009 TPP did not ‘ripen

provide Plaintiffs with a loan modification.”

Supp. 2d 1202, 1210 (D. Ore. 2011)

“[E]ven if Plaintiff could establish that the TPP was a

“Smith[’s] assertion that she would not have fallen
