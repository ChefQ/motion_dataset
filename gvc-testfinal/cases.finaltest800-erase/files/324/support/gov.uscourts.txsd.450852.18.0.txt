release frot | her first hospitalization she filed her a Motion for Continuance of an

to withdraw due to her declining health. Her Motion was Denied.

On or about|January 6, 2003, counsel filed yet another, emergency Motion to
|

Continue the case or to allow her withdrawal, which, in an air of anger and

consternati

allowing her withdrawal, she was again admitted, this time comatose, to

Methodist

almost a minth (in February through March of that same year).

However, her repeated Motions for an abatement and/or to withdraw from
