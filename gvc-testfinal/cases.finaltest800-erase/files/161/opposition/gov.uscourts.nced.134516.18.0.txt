ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES

Case 5:14-cv-00178-H Document 18 Filed 06/11/14 Page 1 of 4

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8{a){2) requires only "a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief", in order
to "give the defendant notice of what the ...claim is and the grounds upon
which it rests", Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007),
quoting Conleyv. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41,47 (1957).
"A complaint attacked by rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need
detailed factual allegations" Id. At 555.
"We do not require heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face" Id. At 570.
A Plaintiff satisfies their burden if they allege facts sufficient to allow a court
to infer "more than the mere possibility of misconduct". Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129
W. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009).
When considering defendants motions, the court must construe the factual
allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. In Re
Stac Electr. Sec. Litig., 89 F.3d 1399, 1403 (9th cir. 1996); Jones v. General
Electric Co., 87 F.3d 209, 211 (7th cir. 1996)

All of Defendant's exhibits have nothing to do with impermissible purpose
credit pulls, those cases did not even get to the discovery face of the lawsuits,
they were dismissed for lacking signatures, having incorrect summons' and
for failure of all Plaintiffs to appear at Magistrate Judges scheduled hearings.
Plaintiff makes inferences or allegations of BU impermissible credit pulls, as
it is difficult to understand how a consumer is supposed to know why
another person or entity obtained the credit reports during foreclosure
litigation and not in the previous year.
In this instant case, Plaintiff alleges violations of the FCRA sec. 1681{b) in
that defendant started pulling the credit reports without permissible
purposes at the commencement of their foreclosure procedure and on
forward starting on February 2011, and according to sec. 1681p they were
done within (5)five years previous of the start of the lawsuit, and discovery

Case 5:14-cv-00178-H Document 18 Filed 06/11/14 Page 2 of 4

of the violations by Plaintiff were within (2) two years previous from the
start of the lawsuit
BankUnited admitted in their answer that they pulled Plaintiff credi~ reports
during the foreclosure litigation.

Litigation between two parties is not considered itself a business endeavor
with a permissible purpose to acquire credit reports, see Bakker v. McKinnan
152 F.3d 1007 (8th cir. 1998); Duncan v. Handmaker, 149 F.3d 424 (6th cir.
2008); Comeaux v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. 915 F.2d 1264 (9th cir.
1990)
Plaintiff discovered another violation while preparing the response to the
Motion to dismiss, this time, when Defendant BU obtained Plaintiffs credit
report AFTER his loan account had been discharged in his bankruptcy as of
August 3, 2009, thus creating another violation.
In light of the Plaintiffs ProSe status, the Court must hold him to a less
stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by an attorney. Haines v.
Kerner, 404 U.S. 519,520,92 S. Ct. 594,596,30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972).
In this case Plaintiff have stated facts that would indicate that there is enough
reason to pursue the production of further evidence through Discovery that
would justify Plaintiffs claim of Defendant having several violations of the
law.
Plaintiff makes a request at the present time in this answer to Motion to
dismiss, that if the Court found some deficiencies, that he be given leave of
court to file an amended pleading and include the new finding, allowing his
cause of action to go forward on the merits.
WHEEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request that this Honorable Court deny
Defendant's Motion to dismiss and to grant him leave to amend his complaint
to correct any deficiencies so justice may properly be served.

Respectfully submitted
Gustavo Romanello
