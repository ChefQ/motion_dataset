AFFIDAVIT OF IVAN CHAPA IN SUPPORT OF AFFIANT'S CONSTRUED 5

DOCKET NO.: 1:05 CR~254-JTC-3

 

AFFIANT IVAN CHAPA [S HEREBY PRESENTING NEW FINDINGS OF THE SUPREME COURT RULING
THAT WAS UNAVAILABLE DURING THE TIME AFFIANT FILED HIS MOTION THAT IS NOW
CONSTRUED AS A 2255 MOTION

 

in light of the United States Supreme Court's findings and ruling in the case

of Padilla v. Kenctucky, decided upon on March 31, 2010, which the justices found

 

that, when an attorney or attorneys fail to advise their clients of the risk
factors in pleading guilty, such amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel. The
justices ruled that lawyers must be truthful to their client toa avert

misunderstanding or miscarriage of justice.

The rights to counsel efficiency is a guaranteed right. However, when counsels
fail to be competent, incompetency and inadequate performance will only manifest

into serious constitutional violation.

PRESENTED FACTS OF INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL

 

Affiant Ivan Chapa hereby set forth this material affidavit as a true document
bearing upon oath and under the full penalty of perjury to be true, correct and

certain.

`

1. That, this new ruling of the Supreme Court shed light upon my own case.

2. That, after my arrest, my family hired Mr. Richard Alamia as my legal counsel
and attorney. After having not more than 2 to 3 phone calls with Mr. Alamta prior
to my guilty plea acceptance, I was assured by him that, my sentence would not be

more than 5 years, and that I would not be deported from the United States.

3. That, not only was I told that I would not be removed from the United States,
Mr. Alamia told me that in any event or attempt to remove me from the United

States, he would be my attorney and counsel at any immigration proceeding.

4. That, I was being misinformed and was tricked by Mr. Alamia's incompetency
and unprofessionalism, which causes me not to even think of taking my case to

trial.

5. That, because of my attorney's misguided information and untruthfulness, my

rights to constitutional due process was affected.

6. That, attached to this affidavit are affidavits of my family, those who were

also tricked and deceived by Mr. Alamia's legal advice.

7. That, my choice to go to trial or to plead guilty was affected by Mr. Alamia's
misrepresentation which resulted in violation of my rights to proper

representation.

8. That, because of Mr. Alamia's ineffectiveness, I entered into a plea deal with
the government not knowing that such would have affected my residency of the United
States. That, the consequences of risk factors prior to entering a guilty plea must
be highlighted by counsel. Thus, when counsels fail to inform their client about

the dangers ahead, such affects the defendant's decision making.

As in my case, counsel's incompetency affected my decision making. That, 1
have lived for most of my life in the United States and for counsel to assure me

that I would not be deported, I did believe in his honesty,

Specifically, I have requested of counsel's professional advice as to whether
the guilty plea would affect my removal from the United States, and counsel assured

me that it would not.
Respectfully presented,

i
SWORN TO AND SUBSCRIBED BEFORE ME, a Notary Public, on this 7 Maay of June 2010,
as a true document bearing upon cath and under the full penalty of perjury to be

true, correct and certain.

COUNTY OF HIDALGO

BEFOREME, THE NOTARY PUBLIC, DID PERSONALLY APPEAR ANIBAL ISA] CHAPA, WHOM DEPOSED AND
STATED UPON OATH THE FOLLOWING:

t, ANIBAL ISAl CHAPA, BROTHER OF IVAN DE JESUS CHAPA GONZALEZ, PRISON NO. 49858179, AM
WRITING THIS LETTER TO STATE THAT | HEREBY SET FORTH THIS AFFIDAVIT AS A TRUE MATERIAL
EVIDENCE BEARING UPON OATH TO BE THE TRUTH AND TRUTH ONLY, FACTS:

e 3, ANIBAL ISA] CHAPA, BROTHER OF IVAN DE JESUS CHAPA GONZALEZ, ARE A WITNESS THAT
MR, RICHARD ALAMIA GAVE FALSE PROMISES IN REGARDS TO MY BROTHER'S CRIMINAL CASE
ON OR ABOUT 2005. MR. RICHARD ALAMIA WAS PAID THE SUM AMOUNT OF $45,000 TO
REPRESENT MY BROTHER IN THE FEDERAL COURT ANDO | HAVE FACTS THAT MR. ALAMIA DID
NOT FULLY REPRESENT MY BROTHER CORRECTLY.

(R) {PERSONALLY RECEIVED A GUARANTEE FROM MR, ALAMIA THAT MY BROTHER IVAN DE JESUS
CHAPA GONZALEZ WAS ONLY GOING TO HAVE A SENTENCE OF 4 TO 5 YEARS IN PRISON IF HE
PLEADS GUILTY. THE TOTAL OF HIS SENTENCE WAS 12 YEARS, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT MR.
ALAMIA HAD NOT MENTIONED TO MY BROTHER NOR I, HIS FAMILY. MY BROTHER PLEAD
GUILTY BECAUSE HIS LAWYER, MR. ALAMIA, ADVISED HIM THAT PLEADING GUILTY WOULD
ALLOW FOR HIM TO ONLY RECEIVE 4 TO 5 YEARS IN PRISON, NOT 12. | ALSO READ THE FEDERAL
DOCUEMNTS CONCERING MY BROTHER'S CASE, WHERE IT CLEARLY STATED THE SENTENCE OF
MY BROTHER'S CASE WAS "10 YEARS TO LIFE," AND WHEN | ASKED THE LAWYER, HE SAID NOT
TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT WAS IN THE DOCUMENTS, HE SAID THOSE WERE JUST PAPERS THAT
DID NOT MEAN MUCH.

" 1AM ALSO A WITNESS THAT MR. ALAMIA DID NOT HAVE A LICENSE TO BE A LAWYER IN
GEORGIA, ONLY IN TEXAS WHERE HE RESIDES; HE NEVER TOLD US THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A
LICENSE TO PERFORM FEDERAL COURT DUTIES IN ANOTHER STATE. MR. ALAMIA NEVER VISITED
MY BROTHER TO ADVISE HIM OR TO SPEAK TO HIM, HE ONLY APPEARED 30 MINUTES BEFORE
MY BROTHER'S COURT HEARING WHICH 1S WHERE HE TOLD MY BROTHER TO PELAD GUILTY, HE
NEVER SPOKE NOR VISITED MY BROTHER TO ADVICE HIM BEFORE THE HEARINIG. i BELIEVE MY
BROTHER WAS NOT ADVISED WELL AND HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATION WAS NOT WHAT ANY
PERSON DESERVES. | BELIEVE MY BROTHER'S LAWYER DID NOT FULLY REPRESENT MY BROTHER
AND ADVISE HiM TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISONS, HIS INFORMATION WAS FALSE AND
MISLEADING, AND HE DID NOT HAVE A VALID LICENSE TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM HIS DUTIES IN
THE STATE THAT WE WERE HIRING HIM FOR.

(R) ANOTHER FALSE PROMISE BY MR. ALAMIA WAS THAT HE TOLD ME THAT MY BROTHER WOULD
SERVE HIS SENTENCE IN HIS HOME STATE, WHICH IS TEXAS, AND MY BROTHER STAYED IN
GEORGIA AND HAS BEEN SERVING HiS SENTENCE THERE.

e = =MY BROTHER WAS ALSO ADVISED BY MR. ALAMIA TO GIVE UP HIS RIGHT TO APPEAL HIS CASE,
SINCE HIS SENTENCED TIME WAS ONLY GOING TO BE 4 TO 5 YEARS, IT WOULD BE UNECESSARY
