GOVERNMENT’S SECONDRESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S CLAIMS UNDER PADILLA
V. KENTUCKY AS PRESENTED IN HIS MOTION TO VACATE, SET ASIDE OR
CORRECT SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 2255
COMES NOW the United States of America, by Sally Quillian
Yates, United States Attorney, Northern District of Georgia, and
Cassandra J. Schansman, Assistant United States Attorney, Northern
District of Georgia, and hereby files the Government’s Second
response to Defendant’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct
Sentence Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, specifically addressing the
Supreme Court’s recent holdings in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct.
1473 (March 31, 2010).

All of Defendant Chapa’s Motions should be

denied, for the reasons explained in this Response.
BACKGROUND
On July 12, 2005, a federal grand jury sitting in the Northern
District of Georgia returned an indictment against the defendant,
Ivan De Jesus Chapa, and others.

(Doc. 1).

Chapa was charged with

conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute at least five
(5) kilograms of cocaine, in violation of Title 21, United States
Code, Section 846 and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii); aiding and abetting the
possession and intentional distribution of at least five (5)

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 2 of 26

kilograms of cocaine in violation of Title 21, United States Code,

Section 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii); and aiding and abetting
the distribution of at least fifty (50) grams of cocaine base in
violation of 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).

(Id.)

On May 9, 2006, Chapa entered into a negotiated plea of guilty
to Count One of the indictment.

(Doc. 86).

Chapa was sentenced on

October 14, 2008, to a custodial sentence of 148 months, to be
followed by five years of supervised release.

(Doc. 212).

During

the course of his sentencing, the District Court assessed Chapa
with a role enhancement, which served to increase his total offense
level by two levels.

(Doc. 247).

Chapa filed a timely notice of appeal of his sentence on
October 22, 2008.

(Doc. 216).

However, his appeal was not

certified to the Eleventh Circuit until October of 2009.

(Docs.

248, 249). The Government filed a Motion to Dismiss Chapa’s appeal
based on the valid appeal waiver contained within Chapa’s plea
agreement, which was granted by the Eleventh Circuit on December
11, 2009.

(Doc. 250).

Chapa did not file a petition for a writ of

certiorari; therefore, his sentence became final on March 11, 2010,
90 days from the date of the Eleventh Circuit’s order.
Beginning on or about March 4, 2010, Chapa wrote a series of
letters to this Court requesting relief.
264, 267, 270, 272).

(Docs. 251, 257, 262,

On March 12, 2010, the Court ordered the

2

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 3 of 26

Government to respond to Chapa’s requests.

(Doc. 254).

The

Government filed its response on March 19, 2010, wherein the
Government argued Chapa’s correspondence should be construed as a
motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and, as
such, Chapa had waived his right to challenge his sentence.
255).

(Doc.

In support of this the Government noted that Chapa had

waived his right to collaterally attack his sentence.

Moreover,

Chapa had also filed a direct appeal with the Eleventh Circuit,
wherein the COurt affirmed the validity of Chapa’s waiver and
summarily dismissed his appeal on that basis.

(Docs. 216, 250,

255).
Subsequent to the Government’s response, but prior to this
Court’s ruling on the initial § 2255 motion, Chapa filed three
supplemental responses with this Court.

(Docs. 262, 264, 267).

The effect of all of these responses was to add an ineffective

on

the

ground

that

his

lawyer

misadvised him of the potential immigration consequences before he
entered his guilty plea, as discussed in the Supreme Court case
Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (March 31, 2010).
In Padilla, the Supreme Court held that, when the law is not
straightforward as to whether a non-citizen defendant’s guilty plea
will result in deportation, a criminal defense attorney may provide
constitutionally

deficient

performance

in

discharging

his

obligations under the Sixth Amendment if he fails to advise the

defendant of the risk of adverse immigration consequences.
1481-1484.

Id. at

Chapa asserts in his Motion that his counsel, Richard

Alamia, advised him in connection with his entry of a guilty plea
that he need not worry about his immigration status, (Doc. 267-3),
and that Mr. Alamia informed Chapa he would not be deported from
the United States because Chapa had lived in the United States for
most of his life.

(Docs. 262-2, 267-3).

Further, Chapa alleges

that Mr. Alamia informed him that in any effort to remove Chapa
from the United States, Mr. Alamia would represent him, (id.), and
that Mr. Alamia affirmatively misrepresented the effect that the
guilty plea would have on Chapa’s status. (Id.)

Chapa argues that

these facts require that he be granted an evidentiary hearing and
that his conviction be vacated pursuant to Padilla.
All of Chapa’s letters were submitted to this Court as a
Motion to Vacate Sentence under § 2255 on June 18, 2010.
267).

(Doc.

On July 23, 2010, this Court ordered the Government to

respond to Chapa’s newly raised arguments regarding the holding
from Padilla.

On July 29, 2010, this Court filed an order

informing Chapa of its intent to construe his letters as a Motion
to Vacate His Sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

(Doc. 270).

On August 9, 2010, Chapa filed a letter in response to the Court’s
July 29th order stating that he was not withdrawing his motion and
requesting that his letters be construed as a Motion to Vacate His
Sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. The Government now responds

4

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 5 of 26

to Chapa’s § 2255 claim and, consistent with the position adopted
by the Department of Justice, urges this Court to conclude that
Chapa’s Padilla claim is not retroactively applicable to cases on
collateral review, and therefore, Chapa’s §2255 claims should be
denied.

I.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY
AS PREVIOUSLY ARGUED, CHAPA HAS WAIVED HIS RIGHT TO
COLLATERALLY ATTACK HIS SENTENCE AND, ADDITIONALLY,
THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE WAIVER HAS BEEN DECIDED
IN A PREVIOUS APPEAL; THUS, CHAPA’S CLAIMS ARE
WAIVED.

The Government reiterates its previous arguments as outlined
in its Response to Defendant’s Correspondence Alleging Sentencing
Error as filed on March 19, 2010.

(Doc. 255).

Specifically, the

Government submits that, to the extent Defendant’s letter is
construed as a § 2255 motion, such motion should be denied in its
entirety because he has waived his right to collaterally attack his
sentence.

(Id.)

Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the

validity of Chapa’s appeal waiver when he previously filed a direct
appeal of his sentence. (Docs. 248-50).

Pursuant to that appeal,

the Eleventh Circuit summarily dismissed his appeal, based upon
Chapa’s valid and enforceable appeal waiver. (Doc. 250).

For this

reason, Chapa’s § 2255 motion should be denied.
II.

PADILLA V. KENTUCKY DOES NOT APPLY TO CHAPA’S §
2255 MOTION BECAUSE THE RIGHT RECOGNIZED IN PADILLA
IS NOT RETROACTIVELY APPLICABLE TO CASES ON
COLLATERAL REVIEW.

The Government having addressed Chapa’s other claims in its
5

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 6 of 26

previous response, (see Doc. 255), the only question remaining from
Chapa’s § 2255 pleadings is whether the Padilla claim he wishes to
present consists of a "right [which] has been newly recognized by
the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on
collateral review," thereby allowing him to vacate his plea and
sentence.

Although the Supreme Court authority in Padilla relied

upon by Chapa is fairly recent, several district courts have
concluded that Padilla does not create a "newly recognized" right
that is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
United States v. Guzman-Garcia, No. CR F 06-0390 LJO, 2010 WL
1791247, at *2 (E.D. Cal. May 3, 2010) ("Padilla did not newly
recognize a right upon which defendant may rely to reset the
running of the limitations period given that Padilla was decided
after defendant's section 2255 motion."); see also United States v.

this

A.

Summary of Retroactivity Analysis Under Teague

The starting point for a retroactivity analysis is Teague v.
Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). Teague’s general principle is that “new
constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable
to those cases which have become final before the new rules are
announced."

Id. at 310 (plurality opinion).

"Under the Teague

framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral
review, but a new rule is generally applicable only to cases that
are still on direct review."

309.

Teague, 489 U.S. at

Chapa’s conviction and sentence became final on March 11,

2010, 90 days from the date of the Eleventh Circuit’s order on his
direct appeal, prior to the Supreme Court’s Padilla decision which
was handed down on March 31, 2010.

7

Thus, the bottom-line question

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 8 of 26

for resolving Chapa’s motion is whether Padilla announces a new or
old rule for purposes of the Teague analysis.
A new rule for Teague purposes is one that was not so
"dictated" by precedent in effect when the defendant’s conviction
became final that it "was apparent to all reasonable jurists."
Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406, 413 (2004) (citation omitted); see
Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461, 467 (1993); Teague, 489 U.S. at
310.

In other words, a rule is new unless a court considering the

defendant’s claim at the time his conviction became final "would
have acted objectively unreasonably" in declining to grant relief.
O’Dell

v.

Netherland,

521

U.S.

151,

156

(1997);

Lambrix

v.

Singletary, 520 U.S. 518, 532 (1997) (the question is not whether
the rule is governed by prior precedent, but whether no "reasonable
jurist ... could have reached a conclusion different from the one"
the Supreme Court adopted).
Here, the Padilla decision announces a new rule.

Three

factors underlie this conclusion: (1) the Padilla opinions reflect
a wide divergence of viewpoints among the Supreme Court justices,
which shows that reasonable jurists could disagree about what the
Court’s precedents required; (2) the majority opinion in Padilla
breaks from a near-unanimous body of case law that reached the
contrary conclusion; and (3) the opinion is a novel application of
existing law.
1.

The Divergence of Views Among the
Justices Shows That Reasonable Jurists
8

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 9 of 26

Could Disagree About What the Supreme
Court's Precedents Required.
First, the divergence of views among the Justices themselves
establishes

that

reasonable

jurists

could

reach

different

conclusions than the one published in the majority opinion relied
upon by Chapa.

The existence of diverging viewpoints as to either

the reasoning underpinning the new opinion or its result is
evidence that reasonable jurists could disagree about what the
Court’s precedents required.

See O’Dell, 521 U.S. at 159-160.

In

Padilla, two concurring Justices disagreed with the majority’s
requirement that defense counsel must "attempt to explain" the
immigration consequences of a plea when the law is "succinct and
straightforward."
Roberts,

C.J.,

130 S. Ct. at 1487 (Alito, J., joined by

concurring

in

the

judgment).

The

concurring

Justices would have instead limited the Sixth Amendment duty to
refrain from "unreasonably providing incorrect advice," id., and
advising the defendant that "a conviction may have immigration
consequences, that immigration law is a specialized field, that the
attorney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client should
consult an immigration specialist if the client wants advice on
that subject." Id. at 1494. Two dissenting Justices, on the other
hand, concluded that the Sixth Amendment did not impose any
obligation to provide advice, competent or not, about immigration
consequences.

Id. at 1494-1497 (Scalia, J, joined by Thomas, J.,

dissenting).

In

recognized the novelty of the Padilla rule.

Justices

themselves

The concurring and

dissenting Justices all recognized that the Court’s imposition of
a Sixth Amendment duty to advise about immigration consequences was
a "dramatic expansion of the scope of criminal defense counsel’s
duties under the Sixth Amendment."

130 S. Ct. at 1492 (Alito, J,

concurring); Id. at 1495 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Alito’s
concurrence asserted that "this Court has never held" that the
Sixth Amendment extends to advice about immigration consequences,
and characterized the Court’s holding as a "dramatic departure from
precedent."

Id. at 1488.

Justice Alito also observed that "the

longstanding and unanimous position of the federal courts" was that
"reasonable defense counsel generally need only advise a client
about the direct consequences of a criminal conviction."
1487.

Id. at

Similarly, Justice Scalia’s dissent argued that the Court’s

precedents "have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice
directly related to defense against prosecution of the charged
offense."

Id. at 1495.

In this way, this Court need look no

further than the text of the Padilla opinion to readily conclude
that the Supreme Court announced a new rule for purposes of the
Teague analysis.
2.

The Near-Unanimous Body of Case Law That
Reached the Contrary Conclusion.

Second, courts also look at the lack of consensus on not only
the Supreme Court bench, but also among the federal and state
10

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 11 of 26

courts when examining whether a decision constitutes a new rule
under Teague.

See Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 415 (1990)

(finding that the rule announced in Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U.S.
675 (1988), was new in part because "in Roberson ... the Court
found [Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981)] controlling but
acknowledged a significant difference of opinion on the part of
several lower courts that had considered the question previously").
Here, federal and state courts before Padilla held a near-unanimous
view that the Sixth Amendment did not require counsel to advise
defendants on immigration consequences.

Prior to Padilla, the

Supreme Court had never suggested that defense counsel must advise
their clients about matters beyond the scope of the criminal
proceeding.

And, as the Padilla Court acknowledged, all of the

federal appellate courts to directly consider the issue had held
that the Sixth Amendment imposed no duty to advise on collateral
consequences.
courts agreed.

130 S. Ct. at 1481 & n.9.

The majority of the state

E.g., id. (citing cases).

This near-unanimity

establishes that prior decisions that reached a contrary conclusion
than

the

majority

reflect

a

"reasonable,

interpretation of Strickland and other precedents, and that the
Padilla rule was not dictated by precedent.

Cf. O’Dell, 521 U.S.

at 156, 166 n.3 ("Our conclusion that the rule of Simmons2 was new

federal courts .... By 1988, no state or federal court had adopted
the rule of Simmons.").
3.

Padilla Is a Novel Application of an Existing Rule.

A third consideration when applying the Teague bar against
retroactivity is that it applies not only to cases that announce
new rules, but also to novel applications of old rules.

See

Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222, 228 (1992) ("The interests in

predictability,

and

comity

rendered

constitutionally deficient representation under Strickland. These
questions usually can be answered by straightforwardly applying
Strickland to a different set of facts, while a select number of
cases present the broader and more substantive question of whether
the Sixth Amendment right to counsel even exists under the specific
circumstances.
The broader category of Strickland claims, where the court
simply applies the standard to a set of facts, generally do not
announce a novel or new rule. The starting point for this analysis
is Justice Kennedy’s suggestion that an application of an existing
rule is less likely to be treated as new for Teague purposes when

12

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 13 of 26

the rule establishes a broad standard that is designed to apply
across a range of factual scenarios.

See Wright v. West, 505 U.S.

277, 308-309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (holding that the
application of the sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard does not
create a new rule; "Where the beginning point is a rule of this
general application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of
evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent
case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one
not dictated by precedent.").

Using this reasoning, appellate

courts – including the Eleventh Circuit – generally consider the
Strickland test to be a rule of general application, and have used
Justice Kennedy’s language to analyze whether new applications of
Strickland are new rules for Teague purposes.

See, e.g., Newland

v. Hall, 527 F.3d 1162, 1197 (11th Cir. 2008) ("Strickland set
forth the paradigmatic example of a rule of general application; it
establishes a broad and flexible standard for the review of an
attorney’s performance in a variety of factual circumstances.").
Although Strickland cases thus generally do not announce new
or novel rules, the Padilla opinion falls into the more narrow
category of cases where the court resolves the more complex and
novel question of whether the Sixth Amendment applies at all. This
conclusion is made apparent by looking first at several examples of
the broader category of Strickland claims, where courts have
concluded that applications of the Strickland standard to specific

13

facts do not announce a new rule.

Strickland analysis would proceed.

Carolina, 430 F.3d 696 (4th Cir. 2005) (noting that prior cases had
established that Strickland applied to filing appeals).
In contrast, Padilla falls within the more narrow category of
cases that establish a new rule or novel application concerning the
Strickland

standard.

Unlike

Williams/Wiggins/Rompilla

and

Flores-Ortega, which all started from the established principle
that Strickland applied to the situations presented and then
resolved how the Strickland analysis would proceed, Padilla first
resolved an antecedent and more fundamental question: whether
Strickland applied at all, or whether advice regarding deportation
was "outside the scope of representation required by the Sixth
Amendment" as part of the criminal proceedings.

See Padilla, 130

S. Ct. at 1481; Id. at 1482 (holding that "advice regarding

15

and

opinions confirm that the primary rule announced in Padilla was
that an attorney’s "Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing
advice"

about

consequences,

even

though

such

consequences are outside the scope of the criminal proceeding. Id.
at 1488 (Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., concurring in the
judgment); Id. at 1495-1496 (Scalia, J.,joined by Thomas, J.,
dissenting).

As Justice Scalia noted, id. at 1495, and the Court

did not refute, the Court’s precedents had not suggested that the
Sixth Amendment governed legal advice not directly related to
defending the prosecution itself; the Padilla majority, therefore,
had to establish that new rule regarding the scope of the Sixth
Amendment itself in order to apply Strickland to Padilla’s claim.
Thus, Padilla extends the Sixth Amendment -- and therefore the
Strickland test -- to a new situation.

It is not simply an

application of Strickland to a situation clearly within its ambit
but never specifically addressed by the Court.

As a result, the

opinion constitutes a novel application of existing law, announces
a new rule, and is not retroactive under Teague.
It also is worth pointing out that the Padilla Court suggested
that the answer to the question "whether Strickland applies to
Padilla’s claim follows from" Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1984),

16

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 17 of 26

which considered a claim of misadvice as to parole eligibility.
130 S. Ct. at 1485 n.12 (while "Hill does not control the question
before us ... its import is nevertheless clear"). As Justice Alito
points out in his concurring opinion, however, Hill declined to
decide whether "there may be circumstances under which erroneous

474 U.S. at 60).

deemed

1491-1492

Thus, it is incorrect to say --

and the Court did not go so far as to suggest -- that Padilla’s
holding was dictated or compelled by Hill.

Lower federal courts

that confronted misadvice and non-advice claims before Padilla also
do not view Hill as having already decided how the Sixth Amendment
should apply.

See, e.g., United States v. Kwan, 407 F.3d 1005,

1015-1017 (9th Cir. 2005); Fry, 322 F.3d at 1200.

At most, a

defendant could argue that Hill suggests that misadvice might be
cognizable.

But the fact that a rule might follow from existing

precedent does not mean that it is not new, and in any event, the
existence of varying views as to whether a particular precedent
"controls" a ruling suggests that the rule is a new one.

O’Dell,

521 U.S. at 161 n.2 ("We have noted that ‘courts frequently view
their decisions as being "controlled" or "governed" by prior
opinions even when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached
by other courts.'") (quoting Butler, 494 U.S. at 415).

The Conclusion That Padilla Adopts a New Rule
Applies With Equal Force to Claims of Misadvice

Regarding Immigration Consequences of a Plea, as to
Claims of Failure to Advise at All.
The conclusion here, that Padilla adopts a new rule under
Teague, applies not only to claims involving a failure to advise of
immigration consequences, but also to claims like Chapa’s where he
asserts that his lawyer affirmatively gave him incorrect advice
that his plea would have no immigration consequences.

Padilla

announced a unified rule that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of
effective assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty
extends to advice about the deportation consequences of pleading,
and counsel’s conduct -- whether he failed to give any immigration
advice or gave erroneous advice – is judged under the Strickland
standard.

130 S. Ct. at 1483-1484.

The decision’s rationale does

not distinguish between non-advice and misadvice.

Id. at 1484

("There is no relevant difference between an act of commission and
an act of omission in this context.") (internal quotation marks
omitted). Rather, Padilla imposes a single duty: to act reasonably
with

respect

to

a

defendant’s

concerns

about

deportation by advising about the possibility of deportation in a
reasonably competent manner.

That duty flows from the Court’s

establishing, for the first time, that the Sixth Amendment extends
to advice about a matter outside of the scope of the criminal
proceeding.

That extension is a new rule for the reasons stated

above, and therefore the specific duties that flow from it are new
rules as well.

The

Padilla decision shows that seven Justices agreed on an analytical
approach that asked first whether the Sixth Amendment applied at
all, and then, based on the answer to that question, treated
non-advice and misadvice in the same way.

Given that the state of

the law before Padilla was that the Sixth Amendment did not impose
any duty to advise about collateral consequences in the context of
a guilty plea, it would have been reasonable to hold that erroneous
advice about such consequences also would not be the basis for an
ineffectiveness claim.

The dissenting Justices underscore that if

It should be noted that Chapa does assert that because of
his cooperation with the Government, his life and that of his
family might be in danger. (Docs. 257-3, 262-3). However, other
than his own statements made within his pleadings, he offers no
evidence to substantiate these claims and makes no distinction
between a potential danger here in the United States as opposed
to one in Mexico. Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit’s reference to
the threat of death in Downes-Morgan was a reference to the
imposition of a death penalty by the Nicaraguan government. 765
F.2d at 1541.

one’s starting point is that the Sixth Amendment does not require
advice beyond the criminal proceeding, it is reasonable to conclude
that

misadvice

is

not

cognizable:

when

"the

subject

of

the

misadvice ... was not the prosecution for which (the defendant) was
entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment
has no application."

130 S. Ct. at 1495 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

Moreover, there was no unanimity among the lower courts with
respect to misadvice claims.

Only three federal courts of appeals

(the Second, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits) had squarely held that
misadvice about immigration consequences could be ineffective. And
those decisions disagreed as to the basis for their holding,
indicating that Padilla’s rule was not compelled by existing
precedent.

The Eleventh Circuit premised its reasoning regarding

misadvice on an attorney’s duty to make sure that a defendant’s
plea is knowing and voluntary -- "certain considerations are so
important that misinformation from counsel may render the guilty
plea constitutionally uninformed" -- and stressed that its rule
applied only when the defendant faced death or imprisonment if
deported.

Downs-Morgan, 765 F.2d at 1541 & n.15.

The Second and

Ninth Circuits applied a broader rule, holding that giving grossly
erroneous misadvice could be deficient performance regardless of
the severity of the consequences of being deported.

See Kwan, 407

F.3d at 1015-1017; United States v. Couto, 311 F.3d 179,187- 188
(2d Cir. 2002).

Kwan and Couto did not explain in detail why

20

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

misadvice differed from non-advice, but the rationale seems to have
been

that

Accordingly, this lack of unanimity among the circuit courts
shows that Padilla’s conclusion was not compelled by lower court
decisions. To the contrary, it shows that reasonable jurists could
disagree about the application of Strickland to such circumstances,
and this lack of consensus is readily apparent among the justices
themselves.

Given the novel application of Strickland, the Court

should conclude that Padilla establishes a new rule that is not
retroactive for purposes of § 2255, even as applied to misadvice
claims, and deny Chapa’s request.
C.

Even if Padilla Is Retroactively Applicable,
Chapa’s Pleading Is Insufficient to Establish
Deficient Performance or Actual Prejudice and his
Padilla Claim Should Be Dismissed on that Ground.

AS discussed above, Chapa asserted a new claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel in his emergency letter docketed as of April
14, 2010, based upon the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Padilla.
(Doc. 262). This Court should deny Chapa’s § 2255 claim. However,

However, in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel, a defendant must prove both incompetence and
prejudice; however, "there is no reason for a court deciding an
ineffective assistance claim . . . to address both components of
the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one."
Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697; see also Chandler v. United States,

The plea and sentencing hearing transcripts in CHapa’s case
are silent with respect to providing any support for the notion
that Chapa’s counsel provided any inaccurate guidance about the
immigration status consequences of entering a guilty plea.
Docs. 88, 247).

The topic simply is not mentioned at all.

(See
The

only factual support for Chapa’s Padilla claim arises from Chapa’s
response and affidavit, where he asserts that his counsel misled
him regarding his deportation and removal status from the United
States.

(Docs. 262-2, 267-3).

Noticeably absent from any of

Chapa’s pleadings is a statement Chapa would not have entered a
guilty plea if he had known that the plea would affect his
immigration status.

To the contrary, he states in his response “I

am not challenging my guilty plea.”

(Doc. 272-2).

Courts already are concluding, however, that such self-serving
assertions of ineffective assistance, without any evidentiary
support, are insufficient to establish prejudice and support an
ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on Padilla.

See

United States v. Dwumaah, Crim. No. 1:05-CR-0157, 2010 WL 2294051,
at *1 n.4 (M.D. Pa. June 2, 2010) ("After considering Dwumaah’s
allegations, the court finds that, while they may suffice to show
constitutionally deficient representation under Padilla, they fail
to show prejudice. ...

Dwumaah claims that, if he had known that

his guilty plea would make him removable, ‘he would have gone to
trial instead of pleading guilty.’ ... Dwumaah also states that he

23

Case 1:05-cr-00254-RLV-AJB Document 277

Filed 09/13/10 Page 24 of 26

was prejudiced, ... and argues that ‘had [he gone] to trial, it was
highly probable that [he would have been] acquitted by a jury,’
....

However, such conclusory assertions do not show a reasonable

probability that the result of the proceedings would have been
different in the absence of his attorney’s alleged error.").

As

mentioned above and in contrast to Dwumaah, Chapa specifically
states in his pleadings that he is not challenging his guilty plea.
(Doc. 272-2). Therefore, since Chapa has failed to show any actual
prejudice, the Court can dismiss Chapa’s claim on this factual
ground, as well as the legal grounds argued earlier.
CONCLUSION
Chapa’s motion to vacate his sentence pursuant

28 U.S.C. §

2255 should be denied in its entirety based upon his valid sentence
appeal waiver.

Moreover, his claims under Padilla should be

dismissed because this newly established rule is not retroactive.
Even if it were retroactive, Chapa has failed to show prejudice
sufficient to demonstrate the result of the proceeding would have
been different.

Therefore, for all of the foregoing reasons,

Chapa’s § 2255 motion to vacate sentence should be denied.
