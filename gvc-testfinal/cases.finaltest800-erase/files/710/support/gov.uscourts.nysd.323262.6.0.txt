MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANT BAWAG'S MOTION TO REFER
COUNTS XXIV, XXV, AND XXVIII OF THE COMPLAINT
AS ALLEGED AGAINST BAWAG TO BANKRUPTCY COURT
Defendant Bank fiir Arbeit und Wirtschaft und Osterreichische Postsparkasse

Aktiengesellschaft ("BAWAG"), by and through its attorneys, Dechert LLP, respectfully submits
this memorandum of law in support of its motion for an order, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 157 and
the July 10, 1984 standing order of reference to bankruptcy judges of then-Acting Chief Judge
Robert J. Ward (the "Standing Order of Reference"), referring Counts XXIV, XXV, and XXVII
of the complaint in this action as alleged against BAWAG to the United States Bankruptcy Court

for the Southern District of New York (Drain, J.) (the "Bankruptcy Court").

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This case arises from the well-publicized collapse of Refco Inc. and its affiliates
(collectively, "Refco"), and their subsequent chapter 11 filings. See in re Refco Inc., et al., Case
No. 05-60006 (RDD) (Jointly Administered) (Bankr. $.D.N.Y.) (the "Refco Bankruptcy Cases").
Because the claims asserted against BAWAG by plaintiffs Kenneth Krys and

Christopher Stride, as Joint Official Liquidators of the SPhinX family of funds and a number of
Case 1:08-cv-03065-JSR Document6 ~~ Filed 04/02/2008 Page 7 of 26

other affiliated entities (collectively, "SPhinX") implicate core matters of bankruptcy jurisdiction
relating to the enforcement and interpretation of Bankruptcy Court orders entered in connection
with the Refco Bankruptcy Cases, this case should be referred to the Bankruptcy Court for
adjudication.

As detailed below, in May 2006, BAWAG paid the Official Committee of Unsecured
Creditors of Refco (the "Committee") in excess of $400 million and waived its claim for euro350
million (approximately $470 million) as part of a comprehensive settlement of all claims and
potential claims asserted in an adversary proceeding arising out of BAWAG's former
management's dealings with Refco (the "BAWAG Settlement"). An essential part of the
bargained for consideration in the BAWAG Settlement was a comprehensive and global release
of all claims against BAWAG, as well as "Claim Over" protection from potential claims for
contribution or reimbursement from third parties who had settled or who might settle in the
future with Refco. The BAWAG Settlement was so ordered by the Bankruptcy Court (Drain, J.),
and its terms were incorporated into Refco's confirmed chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the
"Plan") and the December 15, 2006 order confirming the Plan (the "Confirmation Order"). The
BAWAG Settlement affords BAWAG "exclusive jurisdiction" in the bankruptcy court for any
action seeking to enforce or to interpret its terms, "including any issues relating to Claims Over."
Brick Aff. Exh. A.'

In direct contravention of the "so ordered" BAWAG Settlement, including its "(Claim
Over" ban, SPhinX commenced this action against BAWAG (and more than fifty other
defendants) in New York State Supreme Court (the "Supreme Court") in an attempt to recover

the $263 million it voluntarily paid to the Refco bankruptcy estates (the "Refco Estates") to settle

 

1 "Brick Affidavit" or "Brick Aff." refers to the Affidavit of Brian H. Brick, sworn to April 2, 2008,
and submitted herewith in support of BAWAG's motion.
Case 1:08-cv-03065-JSR Document6 ~~ Filed 04/02/2008 Page 8 of 26

a preference action brought by the Committee against SPhinX shortly after the commencement
of the Refco Bankruptcy Cases (the "Preference Action"). On March 26, 2008, BAWAG
removed those claims asserted against it by SPhinX to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71452(a), and now seeks to refer such
claims to the Bankruptcy Court. Because SPhinX's attempt to recover from BAWAG the
amount it paid the Refco Estates to settle the Preference Action constitutes a "Claim Over" - in
direct violation of the BAWAG Settlement, as well as the Plan and the Confirmation Order -
plaintiffs' claims against BAWAG implicate core bankruptcy jurisdiction and must properly be
adjudicated by the Bankruptcy Court. See 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 157(b)(2). (Point .A.) Referral of the
claims against BAWAG to the same Bankruptcy Court judge before whom the Refco
Bankruptcy Cases are pending is proper because, inter alia, it is the bankruptcy judge who is
directed to determine whether proceedings are core or non-core. See 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 157(b)(3).
Alternatively, even were SPhinX's claims not a disguised "Claim Over" against
BAWAG within the meaning of the BAWAG Settlement, those claims are nonetheless property
of the Refco Estates and, as such, are plainly within the core jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court. None of the claims asserted by SPhinX against BAWAG are specific to SPhinX, and the
alleged injuries SPhinX suffered were no different than the injuries suffered by Refco's
numerous other creditors. Moreover, SPhinX's claims are very similar to the claims that were
asserted and settled by the Committee against BAWAG. And, to the extent SPhinX has alleged
that BAWAG is responsible for Refco's wrongdoing because BAWAG controlled Refco or was
its "alter ego," it is well settled that such claims belong to the Refco Estates and not to individual

creditors. (Point I.B.)
Case 1:08-cv-03065-JSR Document6 ~~ Filed 04/02/2008 Page 9 of 26

In addition, plaintiffs' attempt to prosecute claims that are the property of the Refco
Estates runs afoul of the explicit release and injunction provisions of the BAWAG Settlement,
the Plan, and the Confirmation Order, which, inter alia, release BAWAG from all claims
belonging to Refco and from all claims relating to Refco that could have been asserted by or on
behalf of Refco - including pursuant to principles of alter ego - and enjoin prosecution of any
action asserting claims or liabilities released pursuant to the Plan. For this reason too, plaintiffs'
claims constitute core matters appropriately within the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction. (Point
LC.)

Finally, and in the alternative, even were this Court not to find core bankruptcy
jurisdiction, plaintiffs' claims are indisputably "related to" the Refco Bankruptcy Cases. The
outcome of this proceeding will likely have a direct and substantial effect on the Refco
Bankruptcy Cases insofar as questions conceming the interpretation and enforcement of the
BAWAG Settlement, the Plan, and the Confirmation Order are directly relevant to - and will
directly impact - the debtors' nights and the administration of the Refco Estates. (Point IL.) For
all of these reasons, and as set forth herein, plaintiffs' claims against BAWAG should be referred

to the Bankruptcy Court.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. The Refco Bankruptcy Cases

Shortly after Refco's August 2005 initial public offering, certain Refco employees
discovered a $430 million inter-company receivable that had been improperly disguised during
the ends of Refco's fiscal reporting periods to look like a receivable owed by an unrelated third
party (the "RGHI Receivable"). In reality, the receivable was owed by an unconsolidated but

affiliated entity, Refco Group Holdings, Inc. ("RGHT"'), which was controlled by Phillip Bennett,
Case 1:08-cv-03065-JUSR Document6 ~ Filed 04/02/2008 Page 10 of 26

Refco's chief executive officer ("Bennett"). When the receivable was discovered, Bennett
sought - and received - a loan from BAWAG for euro350 million in an attempt to repay the
receivable.

Despite Bennett's efforts, Refco quickly spiraled toward collapse, and on October 15,
2005, Refco filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the
Bankruptcy Court.

On November 16, 2005, BAWAG commenced an adversary proceeding in the Refco
Bankruptcy Cases, Adv. Pro. No. 05-03161 (RDD) (the "Adversary Proceeding"), against Refco
and other parties alleging that Refco and Bennett had fraudulently procured the euro350 million
loan from BAWAG. On April 17, 2006, the Committee intervened in the Adversary Proceeding
and asserted counter-claims against BAWAG on behalf of the Refco Estates seeking to recover
(i) allegedly fraudulent transfers totaling at least $1.325 billion that had been transferred to
BAWAG from various Refco entities in the pre-petition period, and (ii) damages arising out of
BAWAG?'s alleged aiding and abetting of breaches of fiduciary duty by Bennett. Brick Aff. Exh.

G; see also BAWAG v. Refco Inc., et al., Adv. Pro. No. 05-03161 (RDD) (Bankr. $.D.N.Y.).

B. The BAWAG Settlement

The Committee and BAWAG entered into a comprehensive settlement that included a
resolution of all of their respective claims and potential claims in the Adversary Proceeding in
May 2006. The BAWAG Settlement, executed by the parties on June 2, 2006 in the form of a

stipulation, was approved by Judge Drain of the Bankruptcy Court in a July 6, 2006 Order."

 

Judge Drain's July 6, 2006 order approved the BAWAG Settlement "as if entered by the Court" but
made a few changes to the terms of the settlement that are not relevant here. Thus, all terms of the
BAWAG Settlement material to the issues set forth herein were adopted by the Bankruptcy Court as
set forth in the BAWAG Settlement. Brick Aff. Exh. B.
