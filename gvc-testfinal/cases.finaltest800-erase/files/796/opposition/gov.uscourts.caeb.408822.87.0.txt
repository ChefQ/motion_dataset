Debtor. DEBTOR'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF IN
OPPOSITION TO MOTION

FOR RELIEF OF AUTOMATIC STAY

HON. RONALD H. SARGIS

 

 

 

Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (hereinafter, ""Deutsche"), has requested an Order of this
Court granting relief from the Stay under 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7362(a). The hearing on that motion was
continued from December 9, 2010 to February 3, 2011, with instructions from the Court for the
parties to file further briefing on the issues by January 5, 2011.

Deutsche filed its unlawful detainer action in state court though it does not have standing to
bring the unlawful detainer suit, as it has no valid right, title or interest in the subject property.
Debtor challenges the rebuttal presumption of the validity of the trustee's sale deed now held by

Deutsche. Deutsche lacks standing as the true creditor or real party in interest, and for all of the

reasons submitted before this Court as follows:
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Debtor submits that Deutsche is not the true creditor with respect to the note and deed of
trust on Debtors residence located at 10040 Wise Road, Auburn, CA for the following reasons:

A. The Real Party in interest in the ownership and/or right to receive payments on the
subject property note and deed of trust is not Deutsche;

B. The alleged "beneficiary" of the original lender who foreclosed on Debtors property
(Quality Loan Services) was not in fact a beneficial interest holder and not the trustee of the note
and deed of trust and therefore the foreclosure was invalid, requiring the sale to Deutsche to be set
aside;

C. There has been no "default" on the note payments, as the loan level file shows the
loan is current; therefore there are no damages to Movant or any other entity in the chain of title
which supports a motion to lift the stay; and

D. Due to Debtor's note and Deed of Trust being securitized and being placed in a
Mortgage Backed Security ("MBS") Real Estate Investment Mortgage Conduit Trust ("REIMC"),
the note and the deed of trust were separated and the chain of title irreparably broken, so that parties
claiming to be trustee's or beneficial interest holders in fact were not the true trustee or the true
beneficial interest holder, thus making the foreclosure and sale of Debtor's home to be void.

INTRODUCTION
1. Not only is the Debtor the victim of fraud, unlawful and predatory lending and an
underlying conspiracy to commit fraud, but the Debtor is also facing the pending loss of his home
through a void sale initiated and advanced by Movant and other parties in violation of the notice and
standing requirements of California foreclosure law.

1. In addition, the challenged foreclosure is based upon a Deed of Trust and a Note in
the mortgage that is no longer held by the same entity or party. Further, the foreclosure is based
upon a Deed of Trust that was flawed at the date of origination of the loan. The "lender" on

the Deed of Trust, Accredited Home Lenders, Inc. ("Accredited ") was not the actual lender

or source of the monies that funded the loan. The money to fund the loan came from
investors. Accredited acted merely as a broker for the purpose of obtaining Plaintiffs' on
loan documents and, therefore, Accredited was merely the servicer of the loan but never the
lender or owner of the beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust or the obligation purportedly
secured thereby.

2. Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc. (""MERS") was named as the
beneficiary and as nominee of the "Lender" Accredited on the Deed of Trust, but MERS was not the
beneficiary and the "Lender" on whose behalf MERS was named as "nominee," was not the true
lender. The true beneficiary under the Deed of Trust or its successor in interest has never declared a
default or directed a foreclosure of this home as required under California foreclosure law. Neither
the beneficiary, the successor in interest to the beneficiary, the trustee nor the substitute trustee has
commenced the challenged foreclosure.

3. Quality Loan Service Corporation ("QUALITY LOAN") conspired to make, cause to
be made, and used documents issued and recorded to foreclose on the home in violation of the
procedures and notice requirements

4. Movant Deutsche is the putative owner of Debtor's property through a non-judicial

foreclosure sale. It "bought"!

the property from a "grantee" who was not a true grantee, but an
entity, QUALITY LOAN, that had no right title or interest in the note and deed of trust as more fully
described below. Deutsche is not a bona fide purchaser as it had knowledge that the note was
separated from the note and the deed and that grantee did not have clear title to convey the property
as described below.

5. Based on documents obtained by the Debtor, Debtor believes and takes the position
that the note and deed of trust on Debtors property was conveyed to a tax-free securitized mortgage
trust at the time of the execution of the Deed of Trust by Debtor. Debtor believes that the note and

Deed of Trust still reside, (were never properly conveyed, pursuant to the requirements of the

REMIC Trust and herefore cannot possibly be an asset) in said trust. Debtor's note and deed of trust

 

! The Trustee's Sale Deed notes that Deutsche paid $342,550.24, but $0.00 transfer tax. Debtor is informed and believes
Deutsche did actually pay any money as falsely noted in this Deed, but acquired the property on a credit swap.

was conveyed to the Accredited Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2 ("LOAN TRUST') on or about April
28, 2006. This trust allegedly holds the subject property loan rights. (See, Evidence of Trust
attached as Exhibit "A" to the Declaration of James Macklin.)

6. The trust is governed by the Accredited Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2 Master Sales
and Servicing Agreement ("MSSA"), (See Exhibit "B," attached to the declaration of James
Macklin.) This trust allegedly holds the subject property loan rights (See, Evidence of Trust attached
as Exhibit "A" to the Declaration of James Macklin). Deutsche Bank, as Indenture Trustee, is
merely a special Corporate Trustee with limited ministerial duties, as opposed to a common law
trustee with fiduciary duties and responsibilities and therefore, cannot be harmed at law or in equity
as they are not a Real Party in Interest and have never had any pecuniary or financial interest in the
subject property, nor have they been authorized to act in any remedial action(s) by majority vote of
the investors. According to the terms of the MSSA, Deutsche has never showed authorization by
the voting majority of the Investors of Accredited Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2, the true
"Creditor(s), as mandated by the language of section(s) 10.02 (a)(b)(c) and 7.01 et. seq. of the
Master Sales and Servicing Agreement. Deutsche merely relies upon defective and false documents
filed within state court and the Placer County Recorder's Office which are presumed to be
authoritative, but which, upon inspection by this Court, shall evidence the fatally defective and false
nature of these documents.

7. Debtor has ownership interest rights and possession of the subject property and has
never given up those rights either expressed or implied. Debtor would be irreparably harmed through
the loss of his unique and valuable property and has the only verifiable equitable interest in the
property between the two parties to this action. Deutsche is nothing more than a "Fictitious Payee"
and not a bona fide purchaser under the law.

8. David Boyer, Robert J. Jackson and Associates ("Boyer'') counsel for Deutsche in his
declaration, never offers any proof with admissible evidence, that the parties attempting to assign or
convey rights to affect the subject property in fact, have the right to do so. The documents relied

upon by Deutsche are false, null and void for the reasons stated below. Mr. Boyer only identifies

them as being recorded. A simple review of the Exhibits used by Mr. Boyer reveal violations of
law, with attendant criminal and civil penalties as alleged herein. (See Exhibit "C 1-3," Placer
County Recorder's Office documents on the subject property, attached to the declaration of James
Macklin.)

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

 

9. On or about September 27, 2010, Deutsche filed a Motion for Relief from Automatic
Stay under 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362 without Proof of Claim in the Bankruptcy Case, asserting that said claim
is secured by a lien against real property belonging to Debtor located at 10040 Wise Road, Auburn,
CA 95603 which is Plaintiffs' residence (hereinafter "the Property"). Deutsche refiled the current
motion for relief from stay on November 12, 2010. Attached to the motion for Relief from
Automatic Stay was a copy of a Trustee's Deed Upon Sale, between grantor QAULITY LOAN
SERVICE CORPORATION and grantee Deutsche, showing transfer tax of $0.00, and claiming that
grantee paid $342,550.24 for the property. Debtor believes this alleged sale was a credit bid and that
Deutsche actually paid no money for the property.

10. Although there was a purported assignment of the original lender Accredited
Mortgage Home Lender's Inc. (Accredited) Deed of Trust, Debtor is informed and believes that
such assignment was not done by Accredited but fraudulently conveyed by a third party known as
MERS, Inc, who has never had any interest whatsoever in the subject property. Deutsche did not
attach the complete County Recorder record on the subject property to its motion for relief from
stay, nor did it attach the complete County Recorder record to its unlawful detainer suit. It only
attached the Trustee Deed upon sale mentioned in paragraph 5 above, and the state court unlawful
detainer suit. None of the other assignments and/or substitutions are attached to either the motion or
the unlawful detainer suit. (See Exhibit "C," Placer County Recorder's Office documents on the
subject property, attached to the declaration of James Macklin.) Debtor maintains the reason for this
is that Deutsche knows and admits all those documents are false and fraudulent and do not reflect

accurately the conveyance of both the deed and the note, or in fact, any true conveyance at all.

Chain of Title

11. Based on the original deed of trust, Accredited is the alleged lender, the trustee was
Financial Title Company, and Mortgage Electronic Registration System was the nominee
beneficiary of Accredited. (See, Exhibit "G," Deed of Trust, attached to the declaration of James
Macklin.) Under the specific language of Debtor's deed of trust, only the lender, Accredited Home
Lenders Inc., may assign or convey the note and deed of trust.

12. Deutsche, the grantee under the Deed of Sale and Quality Loan Service Corporation
the grantor under the Trustee's Deed upon Sale are stranger to the original mortgage transaction,
having no relationship with Accredited. MERS (who has no assignment from Accredited)
purportedly assigned the Accredited Deed of Trust to Deutsche as nominee which assignment of
Deed of Trust (See, Exhibit "C-3," Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust, to the declaration of
James Macklin) was NOT recorded until November 30, 2009, which is AFTER notice of default
which was filed on December 8, 2008 by some other entity known as WINDSOR MANAGEMENT
COMPANY. (See Exhibit "D," Notice of Default, attached to the declaration of James Macklin).
Therefore, the Substitution of Trustee is void for substantive defect.

13. Pursuant to IRS Code 860D (a)(4), and the governing rules of the Master Sales and
Service Agreement of the Trust of the subject REIMC Trust, the asset Note must be conveyed into
the REMIC Trust within 90 days of the closing date, June 1", 2006 in this case. If the Deed "follows
the note", this is an impossibility under the evidence provided by Deutsche. This alleged action by
Deutsche would effectively either dissolve the tax free status of the REMIC Trust which allegedly
holds the beneficial interest, or, under the laws of the State of New York, under which the REMIC
Trust is established pursuant to 0x00A7 10.16 of the Master Sales and Service Agreement of the Trust, it
could not have been lawfully conveyed after the closing date of the trust.

14. As set forth in the Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay filed by Deutsche,
Deutsche asserts that it is the rightful owner under the Trustee Deed of Sale from some entity known
as QALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION as trustee.

15. | MERS purportedly acted as nominee for Accredited under fraudulent re-assignment

of trustee under the Deed of Trust to QALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION on November
25, 2009, (See Exhibit "C-2"). In fact MERS has already fraudulently re-assigned the trustee under
the Deed of Trust to another entity (Windsor Management Co.) BEFORE it allegedly assigned to
QALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION. (See Exhibit "C-1").

16. Although according to the county recorder record, Windsor Management Co., was
now the trustee, MERS substituted QALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION as the new
Trustee. THIS WAS NOT A CONVEYANCE OF THE DEED AND THE NOTE. QALITY LOAN
SERVICE CORPORATION never had an interest in the note and did not have the right to receive
the payments. Despite having no interest in the promissory note, QALITY LOAN SERVICE
CORPORATION recorded a false assignment of bothe the "note and deed of trust" to Deutsche
Bank on November 30, 2009. (See Exhibit "C-3").MERS and QALITY LOAN SERVICE
CORPORATION were never parties to the transaction, or entitled to payment from Plaintiffs. But
more importantly, how could QALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION sell the property
to Deutsche for the falsely purported amount of $342,550.24 on December 21, 2009 (See
Trustee's deed of Sale) when it had purportedly already previously assigned both the note and
the deed of trust, with the right to money due to Deutsche on November 30, 2009? If Debtor's
note and Deed of Trust resided in the REIMC Trust, and the REIMC Trust was closed in
2006, absent a vote of the certificate holders of the REIMC Trust, how could it be "reassigned"
three years later in 2009 by different parties that held it in 2006?

17. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that MERS is not a nominee with Power of Sale
under the ACCREDITED Deed of Trust and fraudulently attempted to assigned the ACCREDITED
Deed of Trust to others and that MERS never had any interest in the ACCREDITED Deed of Trust
or the promissory note secured thereby.

18. | Deutsche's fraudulent claim under the ACCREDITED Deed of Trust is entirely
unsecured and there is no security that attaches to the ACCREDITED Deed of Trust.

19. In this case, foreclosure and sale has been recorded, however the entity filing the

foreclosure has no pecuniary interest in the loan transaction. The foreclosing entity, QALITY LOAN

SERVICE CORPORATION , is a third party. The entity lacks standing and the capacity to
foreclose. The entity has no first hand knowledge of the loan, no authority to testify or file affidavits
as to the validity of the loan documents or the existence of the loan. The entity has no legal
authority to draft mortgage assignments relating to the loan. The foreclosing entity and its agents
regularly commit perjury in relation to their testimony. Deutsche, the grantor under the deed of trust,
had notice of the falsities as alleged herein (as evidenced by the purported pre-sale conveyance of
need and deed of trust, Exhibit C-3, which occurred prior to the sale)and therefore is not a bona fide
purchaser.

Securitization of Debtor's Note and Deed of Trust

20. In true fact ACCREDITED, the "Lender", on the original Promissory Note was not
the lender. The originators of the loan immediately and simultaneously allegedly securitized the
note through the means of conversion of an U.C.C. Article III negotiable Instrument into U.C.C.
Article VIX, non-negotiable paper. The beneficial interest in the note was never in the named
lender, who actually served as the broker, rather other unknown and unnamed parties to the
transaction provided funding, as principals, without the terms and conditions disclosed to
Debtor/Borrower. In this case, MERS, acting as nominee for ACCREDITED under the assignment
of ACCREDITED Deed of Trust, was never intended to be the assignee of the alleged mortgage
loan. The Servicer, QUALITY LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION, who acted as trustee for the
sale, was and is not in privity with the lender. The true owner or beneficiary of the mortgage loan
has not declared a default, cannot declare a default under its' Trust Agreement, and does not have an
interest in the Note that allows for any remedial actions to be undertaken by the Beneficial Interest
Holder(s).

21. Debtor is informed and based on information and belief alleges the obligations
reflected by the note allegedly secured by assignment of ACCREDITED Deed of Trust to MERS
have been satisfied in whole or in part because the investors who furnish the funding for these loans
have been paid to the degree that extinguishments of the debts has occurred with the result that there

exist no obligations on which to base any foreclosure on the property owned by Plaintiffs. The

servicer, master servicer, trustee and the Trust itself are the only Obligors to the alleged debt,
pursuant to section 9 of the note and the corresponding language of the controlling trust agreements.
See, Exhibit H to Declaration of James Macklin, the documents showing proof of payment.
Exhibit H shows the Debtor's loan payment level to be current. Movant has in the past and
continues to cloud the title and illegally collect payments and attempt to foreclose upon the property
of the Debtor when they do not have lawful rights to foreclose, and are not holders-in-due-course of
the notes.

22. The mortgage loan assigned to MERS, as nominee, is, at most, an unsecured debt.
The only parties entitled to collect on the unsecured debt would be the holder-in-due-course and
beneficial owner(s) of the original Promissory Note, the original "Lender of Record", if the asset is
still booked as an asset on the books of the lender, Accredited, and has not been sold and de-
recognized as an asset under FASB 140.

23. Certain individuals who were the employees of the Servicer QUALITY LOAN
SERVICE CORPORATION, and even the employees of the law firms, executed and notarized
forged documents as to the ownership of the loan. The affiants have committed counts of fraud,
perjury and forgery of the mortgage loan.

24. Deutsche, represented itself as a "Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as
Indenture Trustee" is merely a special Corporate Trustee with limited ministerial duties, as opposed
to a common law trustee with fiduciary duties and responsibilities. These rights, duties and
obligations do not include any remedial actions as they relate to the assets of the REMIC Trust (See
Exhibit "B," the Master Sales and Servicing Agreement ("MSSA") attached to the Declaration of
James Macklin, Trustees' Rights and Duties 0x00A7 3.04, 7.01 et.seq, 10.02. and 10.16). Unless
Deutsche as the Indentured Trustee has actual knowledge of a default, it cannot act. (See Exhibit
"F," The Indenture, 0x00A76.0land 0x00A76.01(d), attached to the declaration of James Macklin). By the terms
of the Indenture, Deutsche is prohibited from any action including foreclosure.

25. Importantly, Deutsche, as "Trustee" or custodian, must have the mortgages recorded

in the investors name as the beneficiaries of the MBS within 90 days of the "closing date" (IRS Rule

860D (a)(4)), as defined within the REMIC Trust Agreement. Every mortgage in the MBS should
have been publicly recorded in Placer County where the property is located with a mortgage in the
name of "Accredited Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2, under the pooling and servicing agreement dated
June 1, 2006." Such mortgage would have had been publicly recorded in the year 2006.

26. The loan servicers like WINDSOR MANAGEMENT COMPANY and QUALITY
LOAN SERVICE CORPORATION, are merely administrative entities, under limited power of
attorney, which collect the mortgage payments and escrow funds. The Servicer has no greater power
than its' Principal, the Trustee, (without the express voting majorities' authorization by majority
vote, signed individually, under penalty of perjury), and lacks the authority to bring any action on
behalf of the REMIC Trust. The Indenture Trustee, Servicer, Issuing Entity (REMIC Trust),
Depositor, Underwriter, and Master Trustee, U.S. Bank, N.A., have executed Trust Agreements,
under oath, with the Security Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"), as mortgage asset "pass-through" entities wherein they can never own or manage the
mortgage loan assets in the MBS. This allows them to qualify as a Tax Free Real Estate Mortgage
Investment Conduit ("REMIC") rather than an ordinary Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"). As
long as "AMLT 2006-2" is a qualified REMIC, no income tax will be charged to the trust.

27. The promissory note was never conveyed pursuant to the Trust mandates and the
mortgages were never conveyed or recorded pursuant to the proper chain of custody and Assignment
within the Trust Agreement(s).

28. In this scenario, even if the foreclosing entity produces a copy of a note, or even an
alleged original, the mortgage loan was not conveyed into the trust under the requirements of the
prospectus for the trust or the REMIC requirements of the IRS. Mere possession of an Instrument
does not confer the status of a person entitled to enforce the Instrument.

29. Consequentially, the end result is that the required MBS asset, or any part thereof
(mortgage note or security interest), was not legally transferred to the trust to allow the trust to ever
be considered a "holder" of a mortgage loan. Neither the "Trust" nor the Servicer QUALITY LOAN

SERVICE would ever be entitled to bring a foreclosure or declaratory action. The Trust will never
