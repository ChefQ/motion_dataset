DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY ("Movant") requests an order of the
court granting relief from the stay under 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7362(a). The Court has jurisdiction over this
matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7157 and 0x00A71334. This motion is brought for cause under 0x00A7362(d)(1).

Movant is the legal owner of real property commonly known as 10040 WISE RD, AUBURN,
CA 95603 (the "Property"). Movant acquired title to the Property at a foreclosure sale held on
12/14/2009, and perfected title to the Property in accordance with California law (a certified copy of

and correct copy of the Notice to Vacate and proof of service is attached as Exhibit "B" hereto).
After the notice period expired, a Complaint for Unlawful Detainer was filed in state court on
03/26/2010 (a true and correct copy of the Complaint is attached as Exhibit "C" hereto). The
Debtor filed the within Bankruptcy case on 09/16/2010. Movant seeks relief from stay to finalize its
Unlawful Detainer proceedings and to obtain possession of the Property.
I.
CAUSE EXISTS FOR RELIEF FROM STAY

Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7362(c), the automatic stay applies only to property of the Estate,
which is defined by 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7541(a)(1) as ". . . all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in

property as of the commencement of the case" (emphasis added). The Property was sold at a

 

foreclosure sale held on 12/14/2009, a Notice to Vacate as posted on the Property on 01/13/2010, and
the notice periods under applicable law expired, all prior to the filing of this Bankruptcy case.
Accordingly, the Debtor's legal and equitable rights to occupy the Property had already been
terminated as of the Petition date, the Property does not constitute a portion of Debtor's Bankruptcy
Estate, and no Stay is applicable with respect thereto.

WHEREFORE, Movant requests an order of the Court as follows:

1. For relief from the automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7362(a) with respect to
the real property at 10040 WISE RD, AUBURN, CA 95603.

2. That Movant may proceed with all available State law remedies to recover possession of
the Property, including without limitation the commencement and/or continuation of unlawful
detainer proceedings, and the disposal of any personal property remaining in the Property in
accordance with California law, and the Sheriff is authorized to evict the Debtor and all other
occupants from the Property, without further notice, hearing, or court order.

3. That the waiting period under Bankruptcy Rule 4001(a)(3) is waived.

4. That the Order be binding in any pending and subsequent Bankruptcy cases filed by
//
