Civil No. 02-1078L
Honorable Victor J. Wolski

MOTION FOR A SEVEN DAY ENLARGEMENT
OF THE FACT DISCOVERY DEADLINE

Pursuant to RCFC 6.1, Defendant requests a seven day enlargement of the deadline for
fact discovery to and including March 7, 2008.
On November 14, 2007, the Court issued an Order setting February 29, 2008 as the
deadline for the completion of fact discovery. Since the entry of that order, Defendant has
served written discovery upon Plaintiffs, conducted a sight visit, obtained from non-parties
documents and deposition transcripts from related litigation, interviewed several non-parties,
communicated with counsel for litigants in the related litigation, scheduled a review of
documents at Plaintiff’s counsel’s office, and scheduled depositions of the Plaintiff and several
non-party witnesses, all of which will be completed before the current fact discovery deadline.
On January 31, 2008, undersigned counsel contacted Mr. David Wolf and Mr. Thomas
Woitalla, to ascertain their availability for depositions in the later half of February in St. Paul,
Minnesota. Both gentlemen are non-parties who purchased lots from Plaintiff on the property at
issue in this case. Both gentlemen agreed to make themselves available for depositions. Mr.

Wolf, however, indicated that he had a long-planned vacation that would make him unavailable
during the weeks of February 18 and 25. Mr. Wolf indicated, however, that he could be
available during the first week in March. Mr. Woitalla similarly confirmed his availability for
the first week in March.
On February 1, 2008, pursuant to RCFC 6.1, undersigned counsel telephoned Plaintiff’s
counsel, Alan Fish, to ascertain whether Plaintiff had any objection to a seven day enlargement
of the fact discovery deadline to accommodate Mr. Wolf’s vacation plans.1/ On February 15,
2008, Plaintiff’s counsel informed undersigned counsel that Plaintiff opposes the request for a
seven day enlargement of the discovery deadline
The United States has not previously requested an enlargement of the fact discovery
deadline. Moreover, the short extension of time will not prejudice Plaintiff and will
accommodate a non-party witness.

When undersigned counsel first contacted Plaintiff’s counsel’s office on February 1, 2008, he
learned that Mr. Fish was on vacation and would not return to the office until February 11, 2008.
Undersigned counsel requested that Plaintiff’s counsel’s law partner, Rita Fish-Whitlock, return
the call in Mr. Fish’s absence. On February 6, 2008, having not heard from Plaintiff’s counsel or
his law partner, undersigned counsel faxed a letter to Ms. Fish-Whitlock to ascertain whether
Plaintiff had any objection to the short enlargement. On February 8, 2008, Ms. Fish-Whitlock
called undersigned counsel and indicated that, since she is not counsel of record, she did not feel
comfortable consenting to an enlargement and that undersigned counsel would need to await Mr.
Fish’s return. On February 11, 2008, undersigned counsel faxed a letter to Mr. Fish again asking
whether he had any opposition to the short enlargement of time to accommodate the non-party
witness. On February 14, 2008, having still not heard from Mr. Fish, undersigned counsel called
his office, but was told he was with a client. As a follow-up, undersigned counsel faxed another
letter to Mr. Fish on February 14, 2008, again asking for Plaintiff’s position regarding the short
enlargement of time. Finally, on February 15, 2008, Ms. Fish-Whitlock wrote to undersigned
counsel on Mr. Fish’s behalf and indicated that Plaintiff opposes Defendant’s request for a seven
day enlargement of the fact discovery deadline.
