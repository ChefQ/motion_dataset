GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM AND OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
The United States, by and through its attorney, Michael J.
Sullivan, the United States Attorney for the District of
Massachusetts, and Aloke Chakravarty and B. Stephanie Siegmann,
Assistant United States Attorneys, hereby responds to the
Defendants’ motion to dismiss dated October 5, 2006.

For the

reasons stated herein, and in the accompanying affidavits1, the
Government respectfully requests that the Defendants’ Motion be
denied.
INTRODUCTION
As alleged in the Indictment, in the early 1990's, defendant
Emmadeddin Muntasser (“Muntasser”) was involved in operating the
Boston branch office of the Al-Kifah Refugee Center (“Al-Kifah”).
Al-Kifah supported Muslim holy warriors (“mujahideen”) engaged in
violent, religiously-based military conflict overseas (“jihad”).

(“Youngquist Aff.”) and Sealed Affidavit of Special Agent James
Marinelli (“Marinelli Aff.”) filed herewith.

Al-Kifah also published a pro-jihad newsletter called “AlHussam,” an Arabic term meaning “the Sword.”
In April 1993, after media reports linked the New York
office of Al-Kifah to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,
Muntasser founded and incorporated Care International, Inc.
(“Care”), in Massachusetts, and served as its president.
Muntasser represented in Care’s articles of incorporation that it
was “organized exclusively for charitable, religious,
educational, and scientific purposes . . .”.

In June 1993,

Muntasser then filed an IRS Form 1023, Application for
Recognition of Exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code (“1023 Application”) with the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) seeking to exempt Care from taxation on the
grounds that it was a charitable organization. To obtain this
exemption, Muntasser was required to furnish complete and
truthful information to the IRS in the 1023 Application.
Muntasser stated in the application that Care would provide
charitable services such as “assistance to victims of natural and
man-made disasters . . . primarily in Bosnia and later in African
countries . . . [and] develop a program for orphan sponsorships.”
Muntasser also stated that Care was not an “outgrowth of (or
successor to) another organization.”

Finally, Muntasser stated

under the pains and penalties of perjury that the application was
“true, correct and complete.”

Based on Muntasser’s statements

2

signed under penalty of perjury, the IRS granted Care tax exempt
status.
Contrary to Muntasser’s statements in the application, Care
was, in fact, a successor to, Al-Kifah. Like Al-Kifah, Care
solicited and spent money to support and promote Muslim holy
warriors engaged in armed conflict overseas.

Care was initially

located at Al-Kifah’s Boston office, distributed pro-Jihad
publications, and assumed publication of Al-Kifah’s pro-Jihad
newsletter, Al-Hussam (“The Sword”). Had Muntasser disclosed in
the Form 1023 that it intended to solicit and spend money to
support and promote Muslim holy warriors engaged in armed
conflict overseas, the IRS would not have granted it tax-exempt
status.2
After obtaining its tax-exempt status, Care published
articles about the military operations and activities of the
mujahideen on its website and solicited tax-deductible donations
to support the mujahideen.

It also published and distributed an

English translation of “Join the Caravan,” a pro-jihad book
authored by Abdullah Azzam.
Between 1993 and 2002, Muntasser and defendant Muhamed

As described in the indictment although some of Care’s
activities may have been legitimate charitable activities, a
substantial part of their activities were in fact solicitation of
money for the purpose of supporting jihad – a fact, which if
known to the IRS, would have resulted in a denial of Care’s
applications for tax exempt status.

Mubayyid (“Mubayyid”), Care’s treasurer, filed annual tax returns
on IRS Forms 990 (“990 tax returns”) in which they stated that
Care distributed money for various charitable purposes, including
assistance to orphans and widows, food distribution, and welfare
assistance.

They never disclosed in these reports that Care was

soliciting and spending money to support and promote Muslim holy
warriors engaged in armed conflict overseas.

Had they done so,

the IRS would not have continued to accord them tax exempt
status.
As a result of these allegations, the Grand Jury returned an
indictment on May 11, 2005, charging both defendants with a
scheme to conceal material facts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1001(a)(1) (Count One), and conspiracy to defraud the United
States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count Two).

The grand

jury also charged Mubayyid with three counts of filing a false
tax return, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1) (Counts Three Five), and charged Muntasser with one count of making false
statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) (Count Six).
Defendants have now moved pursuant to Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss all six counts of the
indictment. The defendants’ motion advances several fragmentary
arguments why the indictment in this case is defective.
Essentially they assert four bases for the indictment to be
dismissed: (1) the First Amendment prohibits prosecution of the

4

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 5 of 53

defendants; (2) the defendants were not on fair notice of the
proscribed activity and the activity is constitutionally vague;
(3) the IRS could not have denied the defendants’ organization a
tax exemption as a matter of law; and (4) the defendants are
being selectively prosecuted for an impermissible reason.
Defendants’ motion in its entirety lacks merit and should be
denied.

The indictment does not violate defendants’ First

Amendment rights because they are not being prosecuted for their
religious beliefs or speech but for concealing facts from the
government in Care’s application for tax-exempt status and its
tax returns.

The IRS’ regulations put the defendants on fair

notice that concealing those facts was a crime, and neither the
First Amendment nor the IRS’ own regulations precluded the IRS
from taking those facts into consideration in deciding whether to
grant and continue to grant Care tax-exempt status. Finally, the
defendants have failed to meet their heavy burden of establishing
by clear evidence that their prosecution had a discriminatory
effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.
Consequently, the motion should be denied.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE INDICTMENT PASSES FIRST AMENDMENT SCRUTINY
A.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permit a defendant
to “raise by pretrial motion any defenses, objection, or request

that the court can determine without a trial of the general
issues.”

Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2). When considering a motion to

dismiss an indictment, a court assumes all facts in the
indictment are true3 and must view all facts in the light most
favorable to the government. United States v. Sampson, 371 U.S.
75, 78-79 (1962).

Consequently, arguments raised in a motion to

dismiss that rely on disputed facts should be denied.

United

States v. Covington, 395 U.S. 58, 60 (1969).
B.

THE CHARGING STATUTES ARE BEING APPLIED
CONSTITUTIONALLY TO THE CONDUCT ALLEGED IN THE
INDICTMENT.

The defendants claim that the government has applied the
charged statutes in a constitutionally impermissible manner.

A

challenger to the constitutionality of a statute must demonstrate
that “no set of circumstances exist under which the Act would be
valid.”

United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Kolender

v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.1 (1983).

The defendants cannot

substantiate such a claim with respect to conspiracy or false
statements charges.4

Because the allegations contained in an

The definitions contained in the indictment are binding
upon the court at this stage of the proceedings. See United
States v. Sattar, 314 F.Supp.2d 279 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)(refusing to
strike indictment’s definition of jihad and related terms)
4

The defendants likewise have not demonstrated standing to
contest the restriction of Care’s First Amendment Rights. The
defendants gloss over this fundamental constitutional
distinction. It goes without much elaboration, that in order to
assert a violation of a constitutional right, one must have
adequate standing to claim that their own right was violated.

indictment are considered to be true for purposes of a motion to
dismiss, factual issues involving varying interpretations must be
resolved at trial.

See United States v. Sattar, 314 F. Supp. 2d

279 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)(refusing to strike indictment’s definition of
jihad and related terms); United States v. Goba, 220 F. Supp. 2d
182 (W.D.N.Y. 2002)(admitting evidence of defendants’
interpretation of jihad such as publications and recordings);
United States v. Benkahla, 2000 WL 35455044 (E.D.Va. 2000)(same).
Defendants’ assertion that Care -- and they themselves
through Care -- was engaged in religious activity does not mean
that this prosecution implicates their Free Exercise rights.
That is because defendants are charged with fraud and lying, and
even defendants do not claim that fraud and lying were part of
their religious practice or beliefs.5

Committing fraud upon the

government is not protected activity, and that the fraud
incidentally includes the defendants’ speech, or is driven by the

Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)(explaining that
standing is a threshold question in every federal case); see also
United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727 (1980)(a criminal defendant
lacks standing to object, pursuant to Fourth Amendment, to
documents unlawfully seized from another person). The defendants
cannot assert Care’s constitutional rights on their own behalf.
See Wine and Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d
36, 49 (1st Cir. 2005)(“A party ordinarily has no standing to
assert the First Amendment rights of third parties.”)(citing
Eulitt v. Me. Dep’t of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 351 (1st Cir. 2004)).
5

See Church of Scientology v. Commissioner, 83 T.C. 381, 506
(1984)(“Were we to sustain petitioner’s exemption, we would in
effect be sanctioning petitioner’s right to conspire to thwart
the IRS at taxpayer’s expense.”)
7

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

defendants’ interpretation of their religion, does not change the
constitutionality of the prosecution.

See United States v.

Lanier, 920 F.2d 887, 893 (11th Cir. 1991)(“an overt act need not
be criminal, and may indeed by otherwise innocent”); United
States v. Al-Arian, 308 F. Supp. 2d 1322, 1342 (“The reason that
an overt act can include even protected speech is that it is the
agreement that is punishable in a conspiracy charge and not the
overt act itself.”)
It is axiomatic that several crimes are committed through
speech. Conspiracies are characteristically committed through
speech, whether they are to commit violence, narcotics
trafficking, or to violate the tax laws.

See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§

371, 373(a); 21 U.S.C. § 846; see United States v. Rahman, 189
F.3d 88, 117 (2nd Cir. 1999)(defendant’s speech and religious
conduct did not immunize him from prosecution);6 United States v.
Rowlee, 899 F.2d 1275, 1278 (2nd Cir. 1990)(First Amendment
inapplicable to tax protester).

However, if the evidence shows

In denying Sheikh Rahman’s motion to dismiss, District
Court Judge Mukasey stated quite aptly:
To be sure, [the crimes charged], like most others, may have
a component of speech in the course of their commission.
Indeed, it is the rare offense, particularly the rare
conspiracy or aiding and abetting offense, that is committed
entirely in pantomime. However, that speech – even speech
that includes reference to religion – may play a part in the
commission of a crime does not insulate such crime from
prosectuion. ‘[S]peech is not protected by the First
Amendment when it is the very vehicle of the crime itself.’

D.J.)(denying motion to dismiss based on First Amendment claims).

that the speech crosses the line into criminal solicitation,
procurement of criminal activity, or conspiracy to violate the
laws, the prosecution is permissible.

See United States v.

Spock, 416 F.2d 165, 169-171 (1st Cir. 1969); McConnell v. Fed’l
Election Comm’n, 540 U.S. 93 (2003)(holding that soliciting and
donating funds is more like expressive conduct than pure speech);
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 20-21 (1976).

The defendants’

solicitations for money for the mujahideen are simply not immune
from prosecution by committing their crimes through, or for,
political or religious activity.
1.

THE CONDUCT BEING PROSECUTED IS CONCEALING
MATERIAL INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

The point of this prosecution is that the defendants
concealed from the government crucial information which could
have affected the IRS determination of Care’s tax exemption
status. See Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499
(1943)(defining tax evasion as “any conduct, the likely effect of
which would be mislead or conceal.”); United States v. Hurley,
957 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1992).

That the activities which the

defendants concealed have religious overtones is of no
significance.7

Lying to the government was not a First Amendment

7

The defendants’ organization was not organizationally or
operationally created for, or engaged, in exclusively charitable
purposes. If they had disclosed the information necessary for
the government to realize this, they would not have received a
tax exemption. The defendants’ purposes of raising funds for the
mujahideen, was a substantial non-charitable purpose, if not also
9

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

protected activity. See e.g. United States v. Lindh, 212 F. Supp.
2d 541, 567 (E.D.Va. 2002)(“Discriminatory purpose cannot be
inferred from a recitation of historical facts that merely
provide context for criminal charges”).
Significantly, in Care’s 1023 Application and subsequent
Form 990 tax returns, the defendants never mentioned that there
was anything religious about their organization.

Nor did the

defendants file with the IRS as a church or religious
organization.8

In their tax filings, the defendants omitted any

reference to any religious justifications for their activity,
which they raise now for the first time.

They did not mention

that they would engage in any activity that was religiously
inspired, including publication and distribution of materials
which solicited money for armed fighters in overseas conflicts,
in the name of their religion.

There was no reference to jihad

or mujahideen in any document filed with the government.

independently illegal.
8

When filing for IRC section 501(c)(3) status, the IRS Form
1023 instructions which were applicable in 1993 lists the
requirements for religious organizations:
"To determine whether an organization meets the religious
purposes test of section 501(c)(3), the IRS maintains two basic
guidelines,
1) That the particular religious beliefs of the organization
are truly and sincerely held.
2) That the practices and rituals associated with the
organization's religious belief or creed are not illegal or
contrary to clearly defined public policy." See IRS. Pub. 577:
Instructions Section 501(c)(3) organizations, p. 23.

Criminally defrauding the government is not protected by the
First Amendment.

Employment Div., Dept. Of Human Resources v.

Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-879 (1990)(“We have never held that an
individual’s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an
otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to
regulate.”); Welch v. United States, 750 F.2d 1101, 1107 (1st
Cir. 1985)(holding that First Amendment does not protect someone
who assists in the creation of an operation of a tax evasion
scheme).
The defendants’ argument leads to the absurd conclusion that
any crime should be immune from prosecution if done in the name
of religion, or through the medium of speech.

The defendants in

this case do not stand charged with illegally associating with
any organization or entities, but rather are charged with
concealing certain jihad-related activities from the IRS, which
were material to the determination of whether they were entitled
to a benefit that they ultimately received, a tax exempt status.
See Boin v. Quranic Literacy Foundation for Relief and
Development, 291 F.3d 1000, 1026 (7th Cir. 2002)(“There is no
constitutional right to provide weapons and explosives to
terrorists, nor is there any right to provide the resources with
which the terrorists can purchase weapons and explosives . . .
Rather, such a [conspiracy charge] is aimed at prohibiting the
funding of violent acts that these organizations wish to carry

out.”)

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 12 of 53

Where, as here, the defendants’ conspiracy9 involved

actions which transcended First Amendment protected activity, a
motion to dismiss on these grounds cannot lie.
2.

THE DEFENDANTS’ ACTIVITIES DO NOT IMPLICATE THEIR
FREE SPEECH RIGHTS.

The mere fact that speech is used to carry out a crime does
not prohibit prosecution.

See Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S.

476, 489 (1993)(“The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit
the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a
crime or to prove motive or intent.”).

A defendant has no First

Amendment right to make false, fraudulent and misleading
statements to third parties.

United States v. Rasheed, 663 F.2d

843, 846 (9th Cir. 1981)(“The First Amendment does not protect
fraudulent activity performed in the name of religion.”)(citing
Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940)).

Similarly, as

detailed below, the Internal Revenue Code is not a restriction on
an individual’s free exercise of his religion.

See Muste v.

Commissioner, 35 T.C. 913, 918-919 (1961)(clarifying that “[I]t
is [permissible] to impose a tax on the income or property of a
preacher.”)

9

The indictment details many of Care’s activities which the
defendants concealed from the government in obtaining tax
benefits. For example, disseminating publications and statements
in support of sending money to mujahideen, and the use of zakat
as a vehicle to raise money to send to mujahideen were all
activities which were non-charitable in nature, and within the
scope of their criminal conspiracy.
12

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Page 13 of 53

Conspiracy to commit a crime, or to withhold information
from the government in order to evade taxes, is not protected
speech; it is an action, even if it consists of various instances
of speech.

See United States v. Rowlee, 899 F.2d 1275, 1278 (2nd

Cir. 1990)(First Amendment not applicable to conspiracy to
defraud IRS where defendant demonstrated to others how to avoid
taxes); United States v. Schulman, 817 F.2d 1355, 1359 (9th Cir.
1987); United States v. Kellev, 769 F.2d 215, 216-217 (4th Cir.
1985).
A defendant’s speech is not protected if his actions go
beyond mere words, and include affirmative conduct, including
facilitating tax crimes.10

See United States v. Kuball, 976 F.2d

529, 531-532 (9th Cir. 1992)(holding First Amendment does not
protect tax fraud).

Likewise, when speech, or religious

activity, is combined with conduct, such as criminal conduct, it
transcends the bounds of any First Amendment defense. See Rowlee,
899 F.2d at 1279-80; United States v. Freeman, 761 F.2d 549, 552
(9th Cir. 1985)(holding First Amendment question was for jury to
decide).
Finally, as discussed in greater detailed below, a defendant

10

“Speech is not protected by the First Amendment when it
is the very vehicle of the crime itself . . . The gist of the
crime of conspiracy is agreement to violate the law . . . Thus it
is both possible and permissible to charge that criminal statutes
were violated entirely by means of speech.” United States v.
Rahman, 1994 WL 388927,*1 S.D.N.Y. 1994).
13

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

whose speech is contrary to public policy, or incites imminent
lawless action, including violating the tax laws, is also not
protected by the First Amendment.

See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395

U.S. 444, 448 (1969); United States v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 565 (1st
Cir. 1991).
3.

DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO FREE EXERCISE OF THEIR
RELIGION WAS NOT RESTRICTED.

Similarly, defendants claim that this prosecution will
impermissibly require the Court to determine whether certain
practices -- such as contributing to armed struggle -- are part
of the Muslim religion, but that is a red herring as well.

It

makes no difference to this prosecution whether contributing to
armed struggle is a religious practice of Muslims or anyone else.
The IRS, could deny Care’s application for tax exemption
independent of infringing on their first amendment rights to free
exercise of religion.
(1982).

See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252

Accordingly, any conduct that impeded the IRS from

performing its government functions in ascertaining whether an
organization qualified for a tax exempt status could serve as the
basis of a criminal prosecution.
Courts have long held, that the freedom of religion clause
cannot be used as a blanket shield to prevent the government from
inquiring into the possible existence of criminal activity.
Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, 342-43 (1890). The watershed case
in this area was Employment Division, Department of Human

Resources of Oregon v. Smith (“Smith”), 494 U.S 872 (1990), in
which the Supreme Court confirmed that strict constitutional
scrutiny does not apply to facially neutral laws.

Similarly,

this content-neutral prosecution does not warrant strict
constitutional scrutiny.
This case does not hinge on the legitimacy of the
defendants’ religion, nor the motivation for their actions.
Defendants’ arguments notwithstanding, there is no recognized
“jihad” defense to soliciting support for overseas armed
conflict, nor for lying to the government.11

The IRS had a right

to know what activities Care was going to participate in so that
it could fairly determine whether Care was charitable.

If the

defendants’ organization was truly a religious one, such as a
place of worship, additional information should have been
supplied on the IRS Form 1023, and a separate tax exemption
analysis would have applied.12

The defendants’ beliefs are

immaterial to the critical question –- which is whether they

11

A First Amendment protection simply does not apply in a
case where the defendants are not being prosecuted for their
speech or the practice of their religion. See United States v.
Rahman, 189 F.3d 88 (2nd Cir. 1999)(“If the evidence showed that
[the defendant] conspired [. . .] or solicited others to commit
crimes [. . .] –- it would not constitute a defense that he was
justified in doing so within a framework of Islamic law.”).
12

See 26 C.F.R. §1.501(a)-1(b)(1)(iii) (requiring detailed
information with respect to religious organizations’ missions,
goals and organizational structure so that the IRS can determine
whether the organization is in fact a bona fide religious
organization eligible for tax-exempt status.).
15

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

disclosed sufficient, accurate information about their
organization and its activities, which would allow the IRS to
make a fulsome assessment of the charitable purpose and
activities of Care.

See 26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(3)-

1(b)(1)(v)(requiring submission of detailed statement of proposed
activities.)

One cannot fail to disclose to the IRS that they

were going to solicit money for armed fighters regardless of
their religious beliefs.
C.

IF THE COURT CHOOSES TO ENGAGE IN CONSTITUTIONAL
SCRUTINY THEN THE IRS’ RESTRICTIONS SHOULD NOT BE
ANALYZED WITH GREATER THAN INTERMEDIATE SCRUTINY

The court should not apply constitutional scrutiny in this
case because the defendants First Amendment rights are not
restricted by this prosecution.

Likewise, the defendants cannot

claim the IRS unfairly restricted their First Amendment rights,
because the IRS in fact granted them the tax exemption. However,
if the Court embarks on constitutional analysis as to the
potential government restrictions on the defendants, the
appropriate standard of constitutional scrutiny, would be at
most, intermediate scrutiny.

See Turner Broad. Sys. v. FCC, 512

U.S. 622, 661-662 (1994); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367,
376-382 (1968); but also see Kleindienst, 408 U.S. 753 (applying
rational basis review in rejecting First Amendment claims by
citizens wanting to associate with a foreign journalist.)

Under

intermediate First Amendment scrutiny, a law is constitutional
16

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 17 of 53

“if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if
it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if
the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free
expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First
Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the
furtherance of that interest.”

O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377.

“To

satisfy this standard, a regulation need not be the least speechrestrictive means of advancing the Government’s interest.
Rather, the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long
as the . . . regulation promotes a substantial governmental
interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the
regulation . . . [and does not] burden substantially more speech
than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate
interest.” Turner Broad. Sys., 512 U.S. at 662.

The tax code

easily satisfies this analysis in this case.
Because the tax laws are not aimed at the expressive
component of the defendants’ conduct, intermediate scrutiny
applies, because the regulation serves purposes unrelated to the

than merely substantial) state interests -- foreign policy,
national security, and the collection of taxes.

Here, the

ability of the IRS to preclude U.S. taxpayers from receiving a
tax exemption when they are soliciting money to support violent
combatants in holy war is a compelling, legitimate governmental
purpose, and it is largely the province of the executive to
enforce it.

See Boim v. Quranic Literacy Inst., 291 F.3d 1000,

1026 (7th Cir. 2002)(“the government’s interest in preventing
terrorism is not only important but paramount.”); Nichol v. Ames,
173 U.S. 509, 515 (1899)(“The power to tax is the one great power
upon which the whole national fabric is based.

It is as

necessary to the existence and prosperity of a nation as the air
he breathes to the natural man.”); Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222
(1984)(“[m]atters relating to the conduct of foreign relations .
. . are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of
government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or
interference.”).
Neither can the defendants find relief in Brandenburg v.
Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969).

In Brandenburg, the Supreme Court

articulated a test to determine the constitutionality of the
regulation of content-specific advocacy which was directed at
inciting lawless acts.

Brandenburg, 395 U.S. 444.

In this case,

the prosecution is based on content-neutral statutes and
regulations, and is not directed at the defendants’ advocacy.

See Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U.S. 753
(1994)(holding whether motive or through some other mechanism,
disproportionate punishment for those who hold a certain
viewpoint does not render a statute content or viewpoint.)
Nevertheless, even under the Brandenburg analysis, the
defendants’ solicitation of money for the global jihad would
otherwise qualify as incitement of imminent lawless conduct and
would be likely to result in such conduct.13 See United States v.
Al-Arian, 308 F. Supp. 2d 1322 (M.D. Fl. 2004); see also United
States v. Lindh, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 569 (“Those who choose to
furnish such material support to terrorists cannot hide or shield

§2339B (Material support to terrorists), §956 (Conspiracy to
injure persons or damage property in a foreign country), §960
(Neutrality act); cf. Rev. Rul. 75-384 (urging demonstrators to
commit violations of local ordinances and breaches of public
order does not qualify for exemption under section 501(c)(3).).
The authority of the government to regulate matters affecting
threats to national security cannot seriously be questioned.14

There is precedent in similar regulatory schemes for such
restriction, for example, the State department can revoke a
passport based on the risk that a holder’s activities may cause
in the realm of foreign policy or national security. See Haig v.

II.

THE DEFENDANTS WERE GIVEN FAIR WARNING THAT THEIR CONDUCT
WAS ILLEGAL
A.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

“Due process requires that a criminal statute provide
adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his
contemplated conduct is illegal, for ‘no man shall be held
criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably
understand to be proscribed.’” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 77
(1976)(per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted). A criminal statute must “give fair warning of the
conduct that it makes a crime.” Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378
U.S. 347, 350-51 (1964); McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 24,
27 (1931)(warning must be “in language that the common world will
understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is
passed”).

The defendants claim that the rule of lenity entitles

them to dismissal of the indictment.
The rule of lenity, a manifestation of the fair warning
(D.C. Cir 1950)(‘Axis Sally’ case, affirming conviction
propagandist for Nazis during WWII); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy,
342 U.S. 580 (1952)(upholding Alien Registration Act requirement
that alien not advocate overthrow of U.S. government).

requirement, “ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a
criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered.”
United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997).

However, the

constitutional doubt doctrine and the rule of lenity enter into
play only when no other means is available to resolve statutory
ambiguity.

See United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 59

(2000)(“Absent ambiguity, the rule of lenity is not applicable to
guide statutory interpretation.”)

The touchstone inquiry is

“whether the statute, either standing alone or as construed, made
it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant's
conduct was criminal.” Id. at 267.

The administrative

interpretation of a statutory obligation, such as the IRS’
regulation, is entitled to deference, and provides adequate
notice, if the statute is deficient in this regard. Babbit v.
Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon, 515 U.S.
687, 704 n.18 (1995).15
Finally, if the government proves a scienter requirement,
that the accused knowingly committed the crime, the fair warning

Significantly, Congress expressly considered the risk of
abusing the charitable exemption provisions of the tax code and
enacted the “exclusively” language to avoid overly-liberal
interpretations of charitable institution. See Senate Report No.
81-2375 at 29 (1950). The IRC and regulations are broad in their
scope of applicability, but are expressly authorized by the wide
grant of authority to administer the tax laws. See PGA Tour,
Inc. V. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 689 (2001)(stating “[t]he fact that
a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated
by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.”)

concerns are lessened, and hence raises the bar for a defendants’
due process claim.

See Vill. Of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside,

Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982); United States v.
Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2003)(citation omitted).
The Due Process concern is not that the defendant actually
knew that he was committing this crime, but rather “that a
legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law
enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357-58(1983)
(quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974)).

In this case,

the indictment states that the defendants knowingly and
intentionally engaged in the proscribed conduct, hence as a
factual matter, they knew the information that they were omitting
would be material to the IRS, hence, that is why they omitted it
- to obtain the tax benefit. See Vill. Of Hoffman Estates v. The
Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982); United
States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2003). This
allegation, and the evidence of the defendants’ awareness of
their criminal exposure lessens any fair warning concerns. United
States v. Ragen, 314 U.S. 513, 542 (1942).
Making material misrepresentations to the government is
clearly proscribed conduct. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S.
601, 610 (1973)(“[E]ven if the outermost boundaries of [the
statute] are imprecise, any such uncertainty has little relevance
here, where [taxpayers’] conduct falls squarely within the ‘hard

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Page 23 of 53

core’ of the statute’s proscriptions.”) In this case, the
statutes and IRS regulations requiring full and accurate
disclosure of material information are crystal clear. See 26
C.F.R. §1.501(c)(3)-1(b)(v)(“An organization must, in order to
establish its exemption, submit a detailed statement of its
proposed activities with and as part of its application for
exemption...”); United States v. Maxwell, 254 F.3d 21 (1st Cir.
2001)(holding publication in Federal Register satisfies
constitutional notice.). Similarly, the alleged mens rea in this
case is knowledge and intent, so the defendants have a harder row
to hoe because as a matter of fact, the indictment alleges that
they knowingly engaged in this scheme; indeed the defendants even
signed tax forms which iterated the questions that the IRS wanted
answered, and in which the defendants indicated that they shall
not lie.

See Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman

Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499(1982) (explaining that “a
scienter requirement may mitigate a law's vagueness, especially
with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that
his conduct is proscribed”); United States v. Ragen, 314 U.S.
513, 542 (1942)(“[a] mind intent on willful evasion is
inconsistent with surprised innocence.”).
B.

THE DEFENDANTS WERE ON FAIR NOTICE THAT THEIR
MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE ILLEGAL

The prosecution is based on the proposition that no person
is permitted to make material misrepresentations to the
23

government. 18 U.S.C. §§1001, 371; see also IRC §
501(c)(3)(organization must be exclusively for charitable
purposes); 26 C.F.R. §1.501(c)(3)-1 (interpretory regulations).
In the first instance, lying is malum in se, and all individuals
are on constructive, if not actual notice, that they are not to
conceal material information from the government. See United
States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003); see also
Tillinghast v. Edmead, 31 F.2d 81 (1st Cir. 1929)(describing
perjury as malum in se). Secondly, the statutory and regulatory
notice was not only clear based on the plain meaning of the
statutes, it was also actually provided and acknowledged by the
defendants in the forms that they completed.16
The type of information which the IRS felt was material was
also clear as a factual matter; indeed, the forms requested the
information explicitly. (See e.g. Form 1023, requesting detailed
description of the activity and operational information about the
organization, and the association of the organization with any
other organization). Compare with United States v. Welch, 750
F.2d 1101, 1112 (1985)(finding “frivolous, “self-assessment,” and
“substantially incorrect” were “commonly-understood terms in the

16

See Def. Exhibit 5, Form 1023 (“I declare under the
penalties of perjury that I am authorized to sign this
application on behalf of the above organization and that I have
examined this application, including the accompanying schedules
and attachments, and to the best of my knowledge it is true,
correct and complete.” See also Pub. 577, Form 1023 Instructions.

context of the federal income tax laws so that a person
exercising ordinary common sense could know what conduct is
prohibited.”) For example, the requirement that the defendants
provide a full and complete disclosure about their organization’s
activities, and disclose their relationship with Al-Kifah was in
no way ambiguous. See United States v. Damrah, 334 F. Supp 2d
967, 979-982 (N.D.Oh. 2004)(holding that the defendant was put on
fair notice that he was obligated to notify the INS that he was
affiliated with Al Kifah Refugee Center when asked about his
affiliations.)
The defendants alternatively appear to claim that they were
deprived of due process in the administrative context, that is
the IRS did not fairly announce the type of conduct which a
501(c)(3) application was required to report to the IRS.
Assuming ad arguendo that the defendants have standing to raise
this issue, due process scrutiny is lesser at the administrative
level than in a criminal context. See e.g., Kokinda, 497 U.S. at
725; United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987)
(affording due process right of review of administrative decision
only when the defendant was foreclosed from judicial review). The
executive is well within its discretion to decide which conduct
is entitled to special benefit.17

17

The IRS regulations that have

Political questions are typically the province of the
Executive to resolve. See Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292(1981);
People’s Mojehedin Organization v. Department of State, 182 F.3d

been uniformly applied and have operated successfully for several
decades. In the context of an application for charitable
exemption, there is no ambiguity as to whether the applicant is
required to disclose any non-charitable activities in which they
do or plan to engage, and whether they are a successor to another
organization. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 871-72 (1997) (the
vagueness inquiry is most rigorous in a criminal context, where
there is a high risk speech will be chilled); Vill. of Hoffman
Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498
(1982)(“The degree of vagueness that the Constitution toleratesas well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair
enforcement-depends in part on the nature of the enactment.”).
In this case, the defendant’s could have easily obtained
clarification (and right to judicial review) of whether their
activities were exclusively charitable by disclosing this
information to the IRS, as they were required to do.
Finally, in this case, the indictment emphasizes that the
defendants were aware of what type of information would be
material to the government.

The defendants made the deliberate

decision as to the type of activities that they wished to conceal
from the government. Indeed, the defendants’ decision to conceal
their religiously motivated activities from the IRS was neither

After the then-recent World

Trade Center bombing of 1993, and the publicized links with AlKifah, Muntasser chose to incorporate a new organization with no
connection on paper to Al-Kifah and file a 1023 application that
omitted any reference to Care’s relationship to Al-Kifah or
Care’s planned religiously motivated activities, designed to
support the mujahideen, to ensure that no decision-maker at the
IRS would deny Care’s application for tax exempt status.18
Consequently, neither the indictment, nor the law and IRS
guidelines are in this regard, are unconstitutionally vague.
III. THE IRS COULD HAVE CONSTITUTIONALLY DETERMINED THAT CARE WAS
NOT ENTITLED TO A TAX EXEMPTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AN
EXCLUSIVELY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION
A.

DENIAL OF DEFENDANT’S APPLICATION WAS APPROPRIATE
UNDER STATUTE AND REGULATIONS

The defendants curiously argue that the IRS could not have
denied the tax exemption to Care, consequently their omissions
and misrepresented activities could not, as a matter of law, be
material.19 Whether the IRS had the legal authority to deny
18

The defendants did not make any religious references in
their Form 1023 application. There is no mention of jihad or
mujahideen, or Islam or zakat in Care’s description of its
purposes or activities to the IRS. See Form 1023. The
defendants' application also mentions Afghanistan as only one of
six areas in which they would be providing humanitarian
assistance.
19

The defendants actually received the tax exemption which
they say that IRS could not constitutionally deprive them of;
consequently, the defendants’ claim is moot. See Dennis v.
United States, 384 U.S. at 867 (holding that defendant who
27

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Care’s tax exemption is irrelevant to the defendants’ material
misrepresentations.

See Bryson v. United States, 396 US. 64, 71

(1969); United States v. Barra, 149 F.2d 489 (2nd Cir.
1945)(affirming §1001 conviction based on failure to disclose
membership in Nazi Party on a form which he claimed was invalid);
United States v. Holroyd, 732 F.2d 1122, 1127 (2nd Cir. 1984)(26
U.S.C. §7206 case); United States v. Parten, 462 F.2d 430, 432
(5th Cir. 1972)(affirming §1001 conviction even if Customs
service had no right to require defendants to execute form on
which they lied). Nevertheless, even on the merits of the
argument, the IRS surely could have denied them the tax benefit
if they were aware of the defendants’ hidden activities, and
would have been obligated to do so.
The IRS has jurisdiction to determine whether an
organization is charitable within the meaning of the Internal
Revenue Code, and thus qualified for the benefits the Code
provides in support of charitable endeavors. The IRS applies
standards for determining the charitable organization tax
exemption that are detailed and time-tested, and require an
organization be both organized and operated exclusively for one

urging that his conduct be excused because the [requirements]

Jones University, 461 U.S. at 597-598; see also 26 C.F.R.
§1.501(c)(3)-1(a). The first prong of the test is whether the
organization was organized exclusively for charitable purposes.
26 C.F.R. §1.501(c)(3)-1(c)21(“The organizational test provides
in general that an organization is organized exclusively for
exempt purposes if its articles of incorporation limit it to
exempt purposes and do not expressly empower it to engage, other
than as an insubstantial part, in activities that do not further
exempt purposes.”)

The second prong of the test is whether the

organization operated exclusively for charitable purposes.

20

26

Section 501(C)(3) permits tax exempt status on the
following types of organizations (emphasis added):
Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation,
organized and operated exclusively for religious,
charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary,
or educational purposes, or to foster national or
international amateur sports competition (but only if no
part of its activities involve the provision of athletic
facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty
to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which
inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or
individual, no substantial part of the activities of which
is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to
influence legislation (except as otherwise provided in
subsection (h)), and which does not participate in, or
intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of
statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in
opposition to) any candidate for public office.
21
26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(3)-1(b) states the Organizational
test. The Organizational test requires that the organization’s
founding documents (1) limit its purpose to “one or more exempt
purposes,” and (2) do not expressly empower the charity to engage
in more than “an insubstantial part of its activities” in conduct
that fails to further its charitable goals.

If an organization fails either the

“organizational” or “operational” tests, it cannot qualify for
tax exemption under section 501(c)(3).23 26 C.F.R. §1.501(c)(3)1(a)(1).
Serving even one substantial non-exempt purpose will make an
organization ineligible for tax exempt status, even if all of its
other purposes are exempt.

Better Business Bureau v. United

States, 326 U.S. 279, 283 (1945).

Further, the requirements to

be organized and operated exclusively for I.R.C. 501(c)(3)
purposes continue after an organization’s application is
approved.

Failure of an organization to operate for exclusively

I.R.C. 501(c)(3) purposes can result in revocation of exemption,
which will be applied retroactively when the activities differ
materially from the activities and operations the organization
described in its application.

See Freedom Church of Revelation

v. United States, 588 F.Supp. 693 (D.D.C. 1983)(“Tax avoidance

26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(1) states:
Operational test-(1) Primary activities. An organization
will be regarded as operated exclusively for one or more
exempt purposes only if it engages primarily in activities
which accomplish one or more of such exempt purposes
specified in furtherance of an exempt purpose.
23

In administrative proceedings contesting the propriety of
a denial of tax-exempt status, the petitioner bears the burden of
demonstrating that the tax exemption was improperly denied. See
I.R.S. Rule 217(C)(2)(A); Nationalist Foundation v. C.I.R., T.C.
Memo 2000-318, 2000 WL 1507460 (2000). A criminal defendant
should similarly be compelled to proffer such justification, lest
they benefit from a lesser burden as a result of their
malfeasance.

schemes do not qualify as ‘other exempt purposes.’ Because more
than an insubstantial part of its activities is not in
furtherance of an exempt purpose, plaintiff has not met the
‘operational test’ set forth at 26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(3)1(c)(1)).”)24

Given this analytical framework, the IRS was well

within its jurisdiction to determine that Care did not qualify as
an exclusively charitable organization – provided defendants had
given it an opportunity to fully do so by truthfully and
completely describing its operations.
The legislative history of this provision also confirms the
IRS is empowered to take on the time-tested task of determining
whether an organization is charitable. See Bob Jones, 461 U.S. at
597-598. (“Guided, of course, by the Code, the IRS has the
responsibility, in the first instance, to determine whether a
particular entity is “charitable” for purposes of §170 and
§501(c)3.”) Since the Revenue Act of 1950, organizations who are
seeking a tax exemption as a charitable organization are required
24

The IRS engages in a quantitative as well as qualitative
test to determine whether a non-charitable activity of an
organization satisfies the “organizational test” by being
substantial activity toward a non-exempt purpose. The IRS
considered the question of substantiality of non-charitable
activity in IRS General Counsel Memo 34631 (October 4, 1971),
which stated: “[I]f only .01% of [a charitable organization’s]
activities were directed to robbing banks, it would not be
exempt. This is an example of an act having a substantial nonexempt quality, while lacking substantiality of amount. A very
little planned violence or terrorism would constitute
‘substantial’ activities not in furtherance of exempt purposes.”

81-814.

See Section 341 Revenue Act of 1950, 994 Pub.L.

That section provided, in pertinent part, that a charity

must provide information about its finances to the revenue
service, or face a penalty.

The legislative history to that Act

makes clear that the reporting requirements were designed, in
part, to determine whether the organization was engaged in any
business which was not “substantially related” to the reasons why
the organization was exempt.

See also 26 C.F.R. 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(No exempt

this arena similarly was unambiguously designed to prevent noncharitable activities of charitable organizations.26

CONSTITUTIONALLY APPLIED

The IRS was also well within constitutional precedent to
deny Care a tax exemption if their activities were substantially
non-charitable, illegal, or contrary to public policy. Better
Business Bureau v. United States, 326 U.S. 279, 283 (1945).
Vagueness and overbreadth challenges to criminal statutes are
examined in light of the facts of the case at hand. See Chapman
v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 467 (1991).

In an ‘as applied’

scenario, a statute is void for vagueness if it reaches a
substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. See
Jordan v. Pugh, 425 F.3d 820, 828 (10th Cir. 2005).
In First Amendment cases, courts will not void a challenged
statute unless it is shown to embrace a substantial amount of
protected speech, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly

Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113 (2000)(quoting

Broaderick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973).

The IRS

plainly can legitimately grant and deny tax exemptions based on
the charitable nature of an organization’s activities.

With

respect to the facts at hand, this scrutiny is easily satisfied,
first, because the regulatory action would occur independent of
the defendant’s religion or free speech rights, but rather
because the defendants would be supporting violent combatants,
and because the vast majority of the tax-exemption determinations
are made in a constitutionally valid fashion, First Amendment
rights are not violated.
In fact, tax fraud prosecutions based on a defendant’s
speech have repeatedly been upheld as Constitutional. See
Freeman, 761 F.2d at 552(“Words alone may constitute a criminal
offense, even if they spring from the anterior motive to effect
political or social change.”) When a taxpayer’s exercise of
speech is so closely related to the commission of tax fraud, the
First Amendment does not protect such speech. United States v.
Holecek, 739 F.2d 331, 335 (8th Cir. 1984)(holding First
Amendment inapplicable trial defense); United States v. Barnett,
667 F.2d 835, 842-43 (9th Cir. 1982). In fact, the government’s
research has not revealed one case in which the Supreme Court has
held that the Free Exercise Clause requires the government to
grant a person an exemption from a generally applicable, neutral

34

tax law.

The defendants present a poor case to make new law.

The breadth of the IRS’ discretion to determine that Care’s
activities are not “charitable” is not constitutionally
overbroad.

See Bob Jones, 461 U.S. at 590. This argument fails

because the IRS’ regulations clearly permit it to examine the
non-charitable nature of an organization before granting it
benefits, and as described infra, because the IRS can take such
action, even if it restricts a First Amendment protected
activity.27 See Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944)
(finding no constitutional infirmity in “excluding [Jehovah's
Witness children] from doing [in a child labor situation] what no
other children may do.”) Similarly, the defendants are not
entitled to an exemption for soliciting money for fighters, when
no other charitable organization would be.
The theory of prosecution, consequently, is not
constitutionally overbroad, and does not capture pure First
27

The government’s public policy regarding funding
mujahideen cannot have been more explicit since 1995. Since
Executive Order 12947, 60 Fed. Reg. 5079 (1995), which declared a
national emergency with respect to the Middle East peach process,
which threatened United States’ national security, foreign policy
and economy, the support of terrorist organizations has been
closely regulated. Pursuant to Executive Order 12947, the
Secretary of Treasury was authorized to and did prohibit
transactions with specially designated terorrists (“SDT”). Many
former mujahideen groups are now SDTs. The Department of
Treasury’s regulations promulgated to implement Executive Order
12947 are found at 31 C.F.R. 595. Specifically, Section
595.408(a) prohibits charitable contributions to SDTs, including
“donation[s] of funds, goods, services, or technology to relieve
human suffering, such as food, clothing, or medicine.” This
prohibition extends to inchoate offenses. 31 C.F.R. 595.205.

Amendment protected activity. See Hammerschmidt v. United States,
265 U.S. 182, 188 (1924)(“To conspire to defraud the United
States means primarily to cheat the Government out of property or
money, but it also means interfere with or obstruct one of its
lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft, or trickery, or
at least by means that are dishonest.”); Welch v. United States,
750 F.2d 1101, 1108-1110 (1st Cir. 1985)(holding that liability
for a fraudulent tax return does not implicate and cannot be
avoided by evoking the First Amendment); United States v.
Cambara, 902 F.2d 144, 146 (1st Cir. 1990).

As the IRS clearly

had the authority to regulate the charitable exemption given to
Care, the charging statutes do not violate the protections of the
First Amendment. See New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 761-762
(1982)(“It rarely has been suggested that the constitutional
freedom for speech ... extends its immunity to speech or writing
used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid
criminal statute.” quoting Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co.,
336 U.S. 490 (1949).); United States v. Rowlee, 899 F.2d 1275,
1278 (2nd Cir. 1990)(holding First Amendment defense inapplicable
to Klein conspiracy because the statute punishes the act of
conspiracy and does not implicate speech).
C.

PUBLIC POLICY ALSO PERMITTED THE IRS TO DENY CARE
TAX EXEMPT STATUS

Finally, even under First Amendment analysis, the IRS could
have denied Care an exemption on principles of public policy.
36

An

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

organization is not eligible to be tax exempt if the organization
engages in activities which are contrary to public policy.

See

IRC § 501(c)(3), Form 1023 Application; Rev. Ruling 71-447 (to
qualify for tax exempt status under Section 501(c)(3), an
institution must show that it falls within one of that section’s
categories and its activities may not be contrary to public
policy.)

The seminal case involving the Supreme Court’s

determination of whether certain activities of a charitable
organization warranted the revocation of tax-exempt status, is
Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 586
(1983)(“Bob Jones”)(“[A]n institution seeking tax-exempt status
must serve a public purpose and not be contrary to established
public policy.”).

In Bob Jones, the Court concluded that racial

discrimination in education was contrary to public policy, and
consequently, could not be shielded from federal income taxation
by claiming that the discrimination was being done pursuant to
religious beliefs. Id.

This position was also made explicit by

the IRS in a Revenue Ruling, 71-447, 1971-2 C.B. 230. The Court
cataloged the history of charitable tax exemptions, and made
clear that such tax exemption only makes sense if the charity’s
activities are consistent with local laws and public policy.

Id.

The Court concluded that the governmental interest in eradicating
racial discrimination substantially outweighed the tax burden on

37

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 38 of 53

the school’s exercise of their religious beliefs.28
The instant case presents a similar analysis, should the
Court decide to engage in it.

The governmental interest in

restricting the flow of money from the United States to
mujahideen in various countries across the world is compelling,
as is the interest in a fair and regular tax law.

The

governmental interests at stake in this case are paramount for
any government: national security, foreign policy, and the power
to tax.

Conversely, the First Amendment burden on an

organization for the denial of a tax exemption is far outweighed
by the governmental interests, especially, as described above,
when such an exemption does not restrict the defendants’ speech,
but rather, merely deprives the organization of a tax exemption.
The conduct to be deterred in this case, is the withholding
of material information about the purported use of and
destination of funds raised by an ostensible charity. The
concealment of any activity which may be for a non-exempt
purpose, or which may affect the determination of the exempt
status of the organization would be material to the IRS’
decision.29

See Green v. Connally, 330 F. Supp. 1150 (D.D.C.),

28

The IRS’ determination of whether an organization is,
although appealable, an executive function which is not an
element of any of the charged offenses. See e.g. United States
v. Molly-Butcher, 560 F.Supp. 550 (D.Ma. 1983)(where Commerce
Secretary’s determination of controlled commodity for Export Act
purposes is not element of offense).
29
To qualify as a tax exempt charitable organization, an
organization must be organized exclusively and operated

aff’d per curiam sub nom., Coit v. Green, 404 U.S. 997
(1971)(emphasizing that alleged charities which engage in illegal
activities cannot receive tax exemptions otherwise “Fagan’s
school for pickpockets would qualify for a charitable trust.”).
This is not protected conduct, and is contrary to public
policy.30

Even if such activity were inspired by the defendants’

religious beliefs, the potentially deterrent effect would not be
on the ability for the defendant to exercise his religion,
rather, it would be to encourage full disclosure of an
organizations’ activities.

This would hardly be a substantial

burden to First Amendment protected activity, and is required of
all other religious institutions which are exempted from paying
taxes.

See I.R.C. § 501(c)(3). Moreover, the organization can

always continue its activity without the tax exemption.

See

exclusively for exempt purposes. See Quality Auditing Company v.
Commissioner, 114 T.C. 498, 504 (2000)(emphasis added). If a
nonexempt purpose is substantial, the organization will not
satisfy the operational test regardless of the number or
importance of truly exempt purposes. See Income Tax Regulations
section 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(1); see also Better Business Bureau v.
United States, 326 U.S. 279 (1945); Church of Scientology v.
Commissioner, 83 T.C. 381 (1984), aff’d, 823 F.2d 1310, 1315 (9th
Cir. 1987.) A tax exemption can be denied to any organization
who bestows benefits on non-charitable class of beneficiaries.
See American Campaign Acad. V. Commissioner, 92 T.C. 1053, 1068
(1989). The mujahideen do not qualify as a charitable class.
30
Defendants’ citation to the 26 C.F.R. §1.501(c)(3)1(d)(2), the Treasury regulations prohibiting the IRS from
denying an exemption merely based on the unpopularity or
controversial nature of an organization is inapt. That
regulation does not foreclose the IRS from denying an exemption
for an organization engage in illegal activities or those
contrary to public policy. See e.g. Rev. Rul. 71-477. 1971-2
C.B. 230; Bob Jones, 461 U.S. at 597-598

By the same token, that someone else, even aid agencies
which were supported by and/or funded by the U.S. Government, may
have been doing the same thing as the defendants, ad arguendo, is
wholly irrelevant to whether the defendants concealed from the
Government that they were engaging in such activity.

See also

United States v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development,
03-CR-240-G, N.D.Tx. November 2, 2006)("[T]he fact that other
entities have supported the same organizations that the
defendants are being prosecuted for supporting is not probative
of the defendants' knowledge or intent in supporting those
organizations."). The defendants cannot correlate the potential
of the U.S. Government’s support for Afghan mujahideen at or
before the same time as the defendants were funding them with any
legal defense, aside from impermissible allusions to jury
nullification.

The U.S. Government’s foreign policy position on

this issue is irrelevant to this case. Consequently, the IRS
could have legally denied Care an exemption, and the defendants
have no Constitutional remedy.
IV.

DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO MEET HEAVY BURDEN OF PRODUCING
CLEAR EVIDENCE OF SELECTIVE PROSECUTION.
The Attorney General and United States Attorneys retain

“broad discretion” as to whom to prosecute.

Wayte v. United

States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985) (quoting United States v.
Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 380 n.11 (1982)).
40

“[S]o long as the

prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused
committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or
not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand
jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion.”

United States

v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting Bordenkircher v.
Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978)).

The decision whether to

prosecute, however, may not be based on “‘an unjustifiable
standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary
classification.’”

Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (citation omitted).

The United States Supreme Court has granted broad discretion
to the government as to whom to prosecute largely in recognition
of its conclusion that the “decision to prosecute is ill-suited
to judicial review.”

Wayte, 470 U.S. at 607.

The Supreme Court

explained in Wayte v. United States its assessment of the
inability of the courts to review such prosecutorial decisions:
such factors as the strength of the case, the
prosecution’s general deterrence value, the
Government’s deterrence value, the Government’s
enforcement priorities, and the case’s relationship to
the Government’s overall enforcement plan are not
readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts
are competent to undertake.
Id.
The Supreme Court has also voiced concern that judicial
inquiry of prosecutorial decisions threatens the performance of a
core executive constitutional function.

Armstrong, 517 U.S. at

465. “Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal

41

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 42 of 53

proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the
prosecutor’s motives and decisionmaking to outside inquiry, and
may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the
Government’s enforcement policy.”

Id.

Thus, the Supreme Court

has repeatedly announced that the standard of proving selective
prosecution claims “is particularly demanding, requiring a
criminal defendant to introduce ‘clear evidence’ displacing the
presumption that a prosecutor has acted lawfully.”

Reno v.

American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 489
(1999) (citing United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463-65
(1996)).
To overcome the presumption of prosecutorial good faith, the
defendant must prove by clear evidence that the decision to
prosecute had (1) a discriminatory effect and (2) it was
motivated by a discriminatory purpose.

Armstrong, 517 U.S. at

465; see United States v. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1997)
(to prove selective prosecution, defendant must demonstrate by
clear evidence “both that she has been singled out for
prosecution when others similarly situated have not been
prosecuted and that the prosecutor’s reasons for doing so were
impermissible.”) (citations omitted).

Failure to prove both of

these requirements is fatal to any selective prosecution claim.
The defendants cannot meet this burden.

The defendants have

failed to prove by clear evidence either a discriminatory effect

42

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 43 of 53

or a discriminatory purpose.
A.

Defendants have failed to establish discriminatory
effect.

In support of its motion to dismiss on selective prosecution
grounds, the defendants allege that they are being selectively
targeted “because of who they are and what religion they practice
. . .”

Def. Mot. at 44.

To establish a discriminatory effect in

a religious discrimination case, a defendant must show that
similarly situated individuals of a different religion could have
been prosecuted but were not.

See Armstrong, 571 U.S. at 465

(“in race case, the claimant must show that similarly situated
individuals of a different race were not prosecuted”); Magana,
127 F.3d at 8 (merely offering evidence that Spanish speaking
persons were prosecuted without identifying non-Spanish speaking
persons who could also be prosecuted but were not failed to make
prima facie standard for discovery on selective prosecution
claim).

Accordingly, the defendants must identify non-Muslim

individuals who could have been prosecuted for committing the
same type of crime in substantially the same manner as the
defendants but were not.

To meet this burden, the defendants

point to numerous organizations and alleged charities31 that were

31

According to IRS records, at least one of the
organizations that the defendants claim was a §501(c)(3)
charitable organization, American Friends for Afghanistan, was
never granted this status. See Youngquist Aff. at 7.
43

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 44 of 53

purportedly involved, in various degrees,32 in providing support
to the Afghan mujahideen like the defendants.

Nothing in the

defendants’ appendix, however, demonstrates that other non-Muslim
individuals were also involved in a complex conspiracy to
defraud, and scheme to conceal material information from, the
United States government, that could have been criminally charged
but were not.

See United States v. Hedaithy, 392 F.3d 580, 607-

08 (3d Cir. 2004) (non-Arab cheaters on English proficiency
examination used to determine foreign students admission
eligibility not similarly situated to defendants of Arab and/or
middle eastern descent because no evidence that non-Arab cheaters
engaged in widespread conspiracy or paid imposters to take exam);
Branch Ministries v. Rossotti, 211 F.3d 137, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2000)
32

The defendants appendix does not contain any examples of
other alleged charities that were, like the defendants,
soliciting money to directly support fighting or recruit
individuals to join the mujahideen in fighting overseas. For
instance, in response to IRS inquiries, Free Afghanistan Alliance
told the IRS “[w]e do not provide direct aid to any of the
resistance fighters. However, some supplies used to treat the
wounded in the hospitals and they would also receive benefit from
our provisions to refugee camps when they return from the field
for rest periods.” Def. App. at 00371. Similarly, the
Management Sciences for Health obtained funding from the United
States Agency for International Development from 1986 through on
or about 1994 to, among other things, expand and improve the
general health care for the civilian population and mujahideen.
Def. App. at 00636-738. The other activities identified in
defendants’ appendix consisted of proving literacy programs to
Afghans as well as the mujahideen and the distribution of
educational newsletters that presented a “full and fair
exposition of the pertinent facts on both sides of any issue.”
See, e.g., def. app. at 00381, 00249-271. Furthermore, the
majority of these activities occurred in the 1980s, well before
Muntasser’s incorporation of Care in April 1993.
44

(no selective prosecution where church failed to establish that
other churches engaged activities that involved “placement of
advertisements in newspapers with nationwide circulations
opposing a candidate and soliciting tax deductible contributions
to defray their cost.”); St. German of Alaska E. Orthodox Church
v. United States, 840 F.2d 1087, 1096 (2d Cir. 1988) (no
selective prosecution based upon (1) mere allegation that other
“better known” organizations not scrutinized in same way by IRS
without showing that such organizations committed same criminal
conduct as indicted church and (2) single instance of IRS’
failure to investigate religious organization for soliciting
donation of depressed real estate).

Accordingly, the defendants

have failed to meet the first prong of their selective
prosecution claim.
The defendants attempt to minimize their criminal
misconduct.

In fact, the defendants engaged in a long and

complex conspiracy to defraud the government and conceal material
information from several agencies of the government, including
law enforcement.

For instance, although one of the main

activities of Care in 1993-1995 was the biweekly and later
monthly publication and distribution of Al Hussam, a promujahideen newsletter, that encouraged individuals to join the
mujahideen, Islamic fighters, on the battlefield and that
discussed the importance of participating in violent jihad,

45

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 46 of 53

Muntasser did not disclose this non-charitable activity to the
IRS in its 1023 Application33 or the annual tax returns he signed
on behalf of Care for tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995.

In the

1023 Application, Muntasser also concealed from the IRS the
relationship between Care and Al-Kifah Refugee Center, the
Brooklyn office of which had been linked to the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing.

See Marinelli Aff. at 4-5.

In addition to

submitting materially false tax filings to the IRS, defendant
Muntasser lied to the FBI and concealed information from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (now known as Immigration
and Customs Enforcement).
The defendants fail to identify any specific individuals of
a different religious affiliation who are similarly situated but
who have not been prosecuted, but rather has assembled a mixture
of public filings and media reports about activities of

33

The September 1990 version of the 1023 Application, which
Muntasser signed under the penalty of perjury on June 1, 1993,
required that Muntasser “provide a detailed narrative of all the
activities of the organization - past, present, and planned. . .”
Despite this instruction, Muntasser failed to disclose that Care
had begun publishing Al-Kifah’s pro-mujahideen newsletter, AlHussam. Care published its first issue of Al-Hussam on April 16,
1993, three days after Muntasser signed its Articles of
Incorporation. See Sealed Affidavit of James Marinelli
(“Marinelli Aff.”) at 20 n. 9. On April 2, 1993, an issue of AlHussam was published, which indicated that it was the newsletter
of Al-Kifah. Id. As described in the sealed affidavit of James
Marinelli, these newsletters, in addition to the Zakat
Calculation Guides, which Care began distributing in or about
1994, were used to solicit money for the mujahideen.
Subsequently, beginning in 1999, Care’s website was used for this
same purpose.

organizations that largely occurred in the 1980s, which the
defendants contend are similar in nature to what they are charged
with committing in the indictment.
the defendants argument.

There are several defects in

First, they did not point to any

specific individuals of a different religious affiliation, known
to the government, that committed criminal offenses similar to
those alleged in the indictment, who were treated differently
than the defendants.

Second, none of the reported activities of

the other alleged charitable organizations was similar in nature
to the crimes charged in the indictment (i.e, tax fraud).
“Discrimination cannot exist in a vacuum; it can be found
only in the unequal treatment of people in similar
circumstances.”

Attorney General v. Irish People, Inc., 684

F.2d, 928, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1982).

Thus, in determining whether

persons are similarly situated, a court must examine all relevant
factors: the type of charged conduct; the manner in which the
conduct was committed; the deterrence value of a prosecution; the
relationship of the charged crime and perpetrator to the
Government’s enforcement priorities and enforcement plan; and the
strength of the evidence.

United States v. Olvis, 97 F.3d 739,

744 (4th Cir. 1996); see United States v. Smith, 231 F.3d 800,
810 (11th Cir. 2000) (similarly situated person is defined as
“one engaged in the same type of conduct, which means that the
comparator committed the same basic crime in substantially the

Page 48 of 53

same manner as the defendant -- so that any prosecution of that
individual would have the same deterrence value and would be
related in the same way to the Government’s enforcement
priorities and enforcement plan -- and against whom the evidence
was as strong or stronger than the defendant.”)

When these

factors are considered, the defendants have failed to identify
anyone similar situated to them.

Nor have the defendants

established that the government “could prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that someone else [of a different religious affiliation]
had engaged in the same type of conduct, committing the same
crime in that or substantially the same manner.”

Smith, 231 F.3d

at 811 (black defendant failed to carry burden of establishing
discriminatory effect).
Although the defendants speculate that others were similarly
situated to them and could have been prosecuted, speculation
does not meet the clear evidence standard for a selective
prosecution claim.

See United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59

(2d Cir. 1992) (“[m]ere assertions and generalized proffers”
insufficient to establish selective prosecution claim.)

In

Fares, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the
district count committed no error in denying a motion to dismiss
an indictment and for discovery on the grounds of selective
prosecution where the defendant, a Lebanese national whom the FBI
believed was a member of Hizballah, failed to present evidence of

48

Page 49 of 53

(1) similarly situated persons known to the government who had
not been prosecuted and (2) that the government’s decision to
prosecute him was invidious or made in bad faith.

Id. at 60.

Lastly, the defendants argue that charities are rarely
prosecuted and that no other charities have been prosecuted for
committing pro-mujahideen and pro-jihad conduct in connection
with the conflicts in Afghanistan.

As this Court itself has

recognized, however,
there is nothing inherently wrong or suspicious in a
prosecution that is legally and factually unique.
While the government may not, of course, single out a
defendant for prosecution on race, religion, or other
improper basis, it is not confined to routine
prosecutions or well-worn statutory theories.
Moreover, it is entitled to re-evaluate its priorities
and adapt to new threats.
United States v. Lewis, No. 05-40001, slip op. at 13 n.11 (D.
Mass. filed May 11, 2006).

As one court has recognized, “[t]he

reality resulting from limited law enforcement and judicial
resources is that not every criminal violation of the United
States Code can be prosecuted.”
800, 807 (11th Cir. 2000).

United States v. Smith, 231 F.3d

Accordingly, the government should

not be penalized for selectively prosecuting those individuals
who it deems constitute serious threats to security as long as
the prosecution was not based upon an impermissible consideration
such as race or religion.

See generally Marinelli Aff.; see also

United States v. Khan, 461 F.3d 477, 498 (4th Cir. 2006) (in
response to argument that government has not investigated or

prosecuted other alleged terrorist organizations as aggressively
as it prosecuted Muslim defendants believed to be members of
Lashkar-e-Taiba, the military wing of a Pakistani organization,
court concluded that “[t]he Executive branch has the right to
focus its prosecutorial energies on alleged terrorist groups that
present the most direct threat to the United States and its
interests.”).

Since September 11, 2001, the United States

government has focused its investigative efforts on charities
that were believed to be used as fronts to launder money and
assets to jihadists who believe that terror will result in the
establishment of an Islamic state.

See J. Millard Burr and

Robert O. Collins, Alms for Jihad (2006) 1-10.
B.

Defendants Not Being Prosecuted Because of Their
Religion.

Even if this Court were to find that the defendants have
made a prima facie showing of discriminatory effect, the
defendants have failed to present any evidence that their
prosecution was motivated by their religion or any other
impermissible reason.

They have only offered an unsubstantiated

claim that the government is retaliating against Muntasser for
bringing a lawsuit to adjudicate his naturalization petition.34
34

This bare allegation is also insufficient to establish a
claim of vindictive prosecution. To prove such a claim the
defendant must produce evidence of actual prosecutorial
vindictiveness or demonstrate a likelihood of vindictiveness
sufficient to justify such a presumption.
United States v.
Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 1997). Like the burden imposed
on defendants when raising a selective prosecution claim, this
50

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 51 of 53

Such an allegation does not constitute clear evidence of
discriminatory purpose required to support a motion to dismiss
for selective prosecution.

This allegation, which is based

largely on the timing of indictment, is, as discussed below,
directly rebutted by the affidavit of FBI/JTTF Special Agent
James Marinelli that establishes that the investigation of the
defendants culminating in their indictment began years before any
naturalization lawsuit was filed by Muntasser.

See United States

v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 174 (2d Cir. 2003) (no discriminatory
motive where most of investigation of Arab and Muslim defendant
occurred before September 11, 2001, the event on which defendant
based allegation of discriminatory motivation).
Further if, as Muntasser contends, he is being prosecuted in
retaliation for his naturalization lawsuit, then it is
inexplicable as to why would the government would simultaneously
bring charges against Mubayyid, who has not sued the government.
As the Supreme Court has noted,
‘[D]iscriminatory purpose’ . . . implies more than . .
. intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that
the decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a
particular course of action at least in part ‘because
of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon
an identifiable group.
burden is not met by mere allegation or speculation. The First
Circuit has issued caution: “courts should go very slowly in
embracing presumptions of prosecutorial vindictiveness in
pretrial proceedings.” Id. Here, like any allegation of
purposeful discrimination, any allegation of vindictiveness has
been completely rebutted by the affidavits filed by the
government in support of this opposition.

Wayte, 470 U.S. at 610 (quoting Personnel Administrator of
Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979)).
As demonstrated in the sealed affidavit of Special Agent
James Marinelli of the Federal Bureau Investigation, Joint
Terrorism Task Force, the investigation of the defendants began
long before any lawsuit was filed by Muntasser.

One of the

searches that yielded a wealth of evidence against the defendants
regarding the non-charitable activities of Care intended to
support the mujahideen occurred in October 2001, one year before
Muntasser even filed his naturalization petition.

In October

2002, when the defendant filed his naturalization petition with
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now known as
Immigration and Customs Enforcement), he concealed the fact that
he had traveled to Afghanistan and omitted any reference to being
a member of Al-Kifah Refugee Center and Care International.

When

Muntasser was interviewed in April 2003, he lied about traveling
to Afghanistan.

As demonstrated in the affidavits filed in

support of this Opposition and this memorandum, the government
chose to prosecute the defendants for legitimate purposes, most
importantly, deterrence, accountability, and incapacitation.

The

government clearly has a vested interest in ensuring that alleged
charitable organizations do not abuse the tax laws and improperly
use a tax exemption status to collect and channel money overseas
for terrorist related activities.

In conclusion, the defendants have failed to meet their
burden of presenting clear evidence of both discriminatory effect
and intent.

In contrast, the government has demonstrated the

absence of any impermissible considerations in is decision to
prosecute the defendants.

The government therefore respectfully

requests this Court to deny defendants’ motion to dismiss on
selective prosecution grounds.

Defendants.

AFFIDAVIT OF LAUREN A. YOUNGQUIST
I, Lauren A. Youngquist, Special Agent with the United
States Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, do
hereby depose and state as follows:

INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND OUALIFICATIONS
1.

I am a Special Agent with the United States Internal Revenue

Service ("IRS"), Criminal Investigation ("CI").
employed for more than 18 years.

I have been so

I am currently assigned as a

supervisory special agent overseeing a group of 10 special agents
8

within the Boston Field Office of CI.

I have held this position

since October 2005.
2.

Prior to October 2005, I was assigned to the White Collar

Crime Squad of the Boston Office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation ("FBI").
October 2005.

I was assigned to the FBI from 2001 to

While on assignment with the FBI, I also assisted

other squads on investigations including the Joint Terrorism Task
Force.

My duties as a special agent with the IRS-CI, include

conducting investigations involving violations of the Internal
Revenue Code, the Bank Secrecy Act, and related offenses.

In

particular, I have conducted and/or assisted in hundreds of
investigations involving tax fraud, money laundering and the
illegal structuring of financial transactions.

In my capacity as

a special agent with IRS-CI, I have received specialized training ,
in many subject areas including but not limited to the following:
tax law, criminal law, financial investigative techniques, Money
Laundering Control Act violations, and the Bank Secrecy Act
violations.
4.

The information contained in this affidavit is based on

my personal involvement in this investigation, my training and
experience, my review of documents, and information provided to
me by other law enforcement officers, revenue officers, and
employees of IRS.

This affidavit is submitted for the limited

purpose of supporting the Government's Opposition to Defendantsr
I

Motion to Dismiss.

Therefore, it does not set forth each and

every fact that I have learned during the course of this
investigation.

5.

I understand that the defendants have alleged that their

prosecution is unique and unprecedented.

Pursuant to the

Criminal Investigation's Management Information System database,
between October 1, 2001 through October 31, 2006, IRS-CI had 114

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161-2

Filed 11/21/2006

Page 3 of 8

criminal investigations with fraud scheme codes involving
charities.

I am unaware of the religious affiliation, if any of

these organizations, with the exception of Care International,
Inc. ("care")', because this information is not tracked.
6.

Between 2002-2006, 81 indictments were returned involving

conspiracies to defraud the IRS (Klein conspiracies) in violation
of 18 U.S.C. 5371 and 143 indictments were returned involving the
making or subscribing of materially false tax returns in
I

violation of 26 U.S.C. 57206(1) arising out of tax investigations
of IRS-CI Boston Field Office.
7.

I was involved in the investigation of Care and defendants

Emadeddin Muntasser ("Muntasser") and Muhamed Mubayyid.

As a

result, I have reviewed the tax filings of Care as well as the
evidence collected during this investigation that spanned several
years.

I also interviewed several witnesses, including revenue

agents and tax law specialists assigned to Tax Exempt and
Government Entities Division ("TE/GEU).

This IRS Operating

Division is responsible for processing applications for
charitable exempt status under 26 U.S.C. 5501(c)(3) and auditing
Form 990 tax returns of 5501 (c) (3) organizations.
8.

In 1987, because of perceived abuses of the laws applicable

'~lthough I am now aware that Care was a purported Muslim
oriented charity from their own publications and website, no tax
filing submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, the application
for 26 U.S.C. 501(c) (3) exempt status or any Form 990 annual tax
return, made any mention to their religious affiliation.

I

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

to tax exempt organizations, Congress created a new disclosure
requirement under 26 U.S.C. §6104 that required that tax exempt
organizations make their tax filings available to the public,
including Applications for Recognition of Exemption under Section
501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code ("1023 Application") and
Form 990 annual tax returns.

The legislative history indicates

that legislators believed that the increased availability of
information to the public would help assure that the double tax
benefits of deductibility of contributions and exemption from
I

income tax would thereby be limited to organization whose assets
were devoted exclusively to charitable purposes as required by
the tax laws.
9.

Based upon my personal involvement in this case and

training, I believe Care was not entitled to a charitable exempt
status under 26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3) for the reasons cited in the
Indictment.

Specifically, Care engaged in non-charitable

activities, which were concealed from the IRS, that made them
ineligible for a charitable tax exemption.

From 1993 to 2003,

through its agents, including the defendants, Care collected at
least $1.3 million in tax-deductible contributions, according to
their own tax returns filed with the IRS, all of which was tax
exempt.

None of this money should have been deemed tax

deductible resulting in a tax loss to the United States of
approximately $364,000.

Any defendant regardless of their

,

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

religious affiliation would be prosecuted under these
circumstances.
10.

It is undisputed by senior tax exempt specialists and

attorneys assigned to the Tax Division of the Department of
Justice that if defendant Muntasser had truthfully completed its
application for recognition of exemption or properly disclosed
the true nature of its activities, it would not have been issued
an IRS determination letter recognizing it exempt from tax and
eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions.
Thus, even if Care were able to solicit contributions, its
activities would not have been subsidized by United States
taxpayers as contributors would not have been eligible to take
charitable deductions against taxable income.
11.

Based upon the official policies that existed in 1993, the

IRS would have denied a charitable tax exempt status to an
organization that advocated engaging in criminal or other
activities contrary to public policy.
12.

The information requested in 1023 applications is material

and important to the IRSf ultimate determination as to whether an
organization is exclusively charitable and therefore qualifies
for a tax exemption status.

The September 1990 version of the

1023 Application, which Muntasser signed on June 1, 1993 under
the penalty of perjury to obtain charitable tax exempt status for
Care, allegedly a newly formed organization with no relationship

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161-2

Page 6 of 8

to any other organization, required applicants to "[plrovide a
I

detailed narrative description of

activities of the

organization - past, present, and planned.

. ."

(emphasis added).

I believe an applicant's failure to follow this instruction and
disclose non-charitable or disqualifying activities of an
organization would render the Form 1023 application materially
false.

Accordingly, Muntasser's omission of all of Care's

activities, including those involving the solicitation of money
for an illegal purpose, impeded the government's ascertainment of
whether Care qualified as a tax exempt organization.

Similarly,

Care omitted any information about its non-charitable activities
in its annual Form 990 tax returns, thereby concealing material

I

information from the IRS.
13.

The 1023 Application, which Muntasser signed, also required

that he state whether Care was an outgrowth or successor to
another organization.

Muntasser answered no to this question.

believe this answer was materially false.
at Def. App. at 0087.

I

See 1023 Application

Based upon my review of the evidence

collected in this case, Muntasser was a director of the Boston
office of Al-Kifah Refugee center2 from approximately 1991-1993.
After the media linked the Brooklyn Office of Al-Kifah to the
World Trade Center Bombing on or about April 11, 1993, Muntasser
2~lthoughMuntasser occasionally indicated the Boston office
of Al-Kifah was a §501(c) (3) charitable organization, no Al-Kifah
office was granted that status by the IRS.

Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS

Document 161-2

Page 7 of 8

incorporated Care as a new organization with the same address as
the Boston office of Al-Kifah.

On the Articles of Incorporation,

he indicated that he would serve as president of Care.

By the

I

time he signed the 1023 Application for Care, he had begun
transferring the assets of Al-Kifah to Care.
14.

I have been advised by tax law advisors and technical ruling

specialists at TE/GE, which adjudicated this application, that if
Muntasser had truthfully answered this question, they would have
requested all relevant information about Al-Kifah Refugee Center,
including but not limited to: information about its activities,
membership, and other affiliated offices and organizations;
whether its was a non-profit or for profit organization; and why
that organization had been dissolved and/or replaced by Care.

15.

According to the records of the IRS, one of the alleged

charities identified by the defendants as committing similar
activities as Care, American Friends of Afghanistan was never
granted tax exempt status under 26 U.S.C. §501(c) (3).
16.

In conclusion, had Muntasser, Mubayyid, or any other Care

officer provided truthful information about all of Care's
activities, including those non-charitable in nature, to the IRS,
the IRS would not have granted tax exempt status to Care in 1993
