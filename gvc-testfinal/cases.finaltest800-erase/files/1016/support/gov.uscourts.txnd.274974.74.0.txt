CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE
I certify that at 8:25 a.m. CDT Pat Conlon, Justin Anderson, and I called Richard
Johnston, one of the lawyers representing Defendant Healey. We were advised he was away at
a meeting. We then tried to reach Melissa Hoffer and were told that she was unavailable and in
a morning meeting. We next tried Christophe Courchesne, Chief of the Environmental
Protection Division, and reached him at 8:30 am CDT. Mr. Anderson advised Mr. Courchesne
that Plaintiff would this morning be filing a motion for leave to amend its Complaint to add two
new claims and to add the Attorney General for the State of New York as a co-defendant. He
also identified the claims to be added. Mr. Courchesne initially advised us that Defendant
Healey opposed the motion unless he got back to us by 9 am. Mr. Courchesne later emailed to
state that that Defendant Healey does not at this time consent to the relief sought by Plaintiff’s
motion. Plaintiff will supplement this Certificate of Conference if it turns out Defendant
consents to the relief sought by the motion.
