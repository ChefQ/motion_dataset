PURSUANT TO LCrR 6.1

 

 

MOTION TO INTERVENE AND TO QUASH
GRAND JURY SUBPOENA NO. 10218019

Pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules 6 and 17(c)(2) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the blogger who writes under the nom de plume
"Hannibal Lecter's Evil Twin" moves to intervene in the matter of a subpoena issued by a
federal grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia seeking documents related to his identity
and moves to quash that subpoena on the ground that the subpoena seeks material protected by
the First Amendment right to engage in anonymous political speech.

BACKGROUND

On February 8, 2011, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia issued
Subpoena No. 10218019 to Automattic, Inc., a company that owns the popular blog-hosting
service WordPress.' The subpoena demands "any records relating to the identity of the person(s)
that made a posting on http://hlet.wordpress.com/ who identified themselves as `Hannibal
Lecter's Evil Twin' on 12/2/2010, at 3:23, time zone PST." The subpoena indicates that

Automattic may comply "by promptly providing the requested documents by fax" to a United

 

' According to its website, more than 25 million people and organizations use WordPress to
power their home pages or blogs. See http://wordpress.org/. (This and all other Intemet sources

States Capitol Police Special Agent. A copy of Subpoena No. 10218019 is attached to this
motion as Exhibit A.

Automattic informed its customer - the author of the specified blog posting - of the
subpoena, and indicated that it would not contest the subpoena, but would delay responding so
that the author could seek legal counsel. The author contacted the American Civil Liberties
Union, which concluded that the subpoena presented a threat to the important right of
anonymous expression on the Internet, and therefore agreed to represent the author in seeking to
quash the subpoena.

FACTS
The Internet posting identified in Subpoena No. 10218019 is a derogatory screed about a
United States Senator. But as will be seen below, the posting is a clear example of political
speech that cannot justify the identification of an anonymous author through use of a grand jury
subpoena.

The blogger whose identity is sought by Subpoena No. 10218019 is an individual who
has been operating a blog since February 2009." In the "About" section of the blog, the author
describes it as a "rant blog," and wryly states, "Before I post anything here, I ask myself: How
could I make this even more likely to disqualify me from ever running for any political

office"?

A review of the blog reveals that the author uses it to vent about politics and current
events, and occasionally about things that occur in the author's personal life. Posts have

expressed the author's uninhibited views about politicians and other public figures, and have

also commented on movies and television shows, health care policy, abortion rights, same-sex

marriage, Wikileaks, and "The Metaphysics of Gun Control."*

First among nineteen "Categories" of blog posts listed along the right-hand side of the
blog's home page are four devoted to domestic politics: the "2012 Shit List," the "2014 Shit
List," the "2016 Shit List," and "Confirmed Kills." Each of the "Shit Lists" names one or more
U.S. Senators whose terms are expiring in the named year and who the author believes must be
defeated. The category labeled "Confirmed Kills" names two former U.S. Senators whom the
author had criticized and who were not re-elected in 2010.0x00B0

An examination of the blog shows that the author posted a series of rants about seven
senators on December 2, 2010. Two days earlier, the Senate had defeated a proposed ban on
"earmarks." The author was outraged that some Republican senators had voted against the ban,
and posted scalding comments about them, placing each post in the "Shit List" corresponding to
the year in which that senator is up for re-election. These posts declare - using vulgar and often
crude metaphorical language - that the senator in question should not remain in office after his or
her term expires.

For example, the post about Senator Lisa Murkowski states, "She can't be gotten rid of
for 6 years, short of a tragic but welcome botox accident."0x00B0 The post about Senator Richard
Shelby says, "We'll shoot our own dog if it snarls at us once. Unfortunately, this Dick is safe till

2016. But if he thinks we'll forget by then, he's wrong."' And the post about Senator Richard

5 George Voinovich of Ohio, who retired rather than seeking re-election, and Bob Bennett of
Utah, who was defeated in the Republican primary election. Needless to say, both are alive and
well.

Lugar says, "It's much more important to hang traitors on our side than to beat the other side."*
The full text of these seven postings is attached as Exhibit B.

The single blog entry targeted by Subpoena No. 10218019 is one of these seven postings.
The full post reads as follows:

Thad Chochran - Republican Senator from Mississippi

Thad Cochran isn't up for rejection till 2014. He's old as hell.
If we're lucky, he'll die before then from all the pork he's been consuming.

Citizens Against Government Waste rates him the top porker
in the Senate this year. Yep, he beat out all Democrats.

He voted against the earmark ban, shocker.

He's a slimy political animal. Let's put him down."

Senator Cochran's term expires in 2014; this post about him was therefore placed on the "2014
Shit List."

Senator Cochran has been mentioned only one other time in the author's 28 months of
blogging. On November 18, 2010, the author again lambasted Republicans who did not support
a ban on earmarks, listing several by name, and suggesting that "Sarah Palin should leave wolves
alone and shoot Murkowski voters."'0x00B0 Apparently the author couldn't think of Senator
Cochran's name at that moment, and so referred to him as "some stupid southern Republican

motherfucker from Mississippi or something whose name I'll remember eventually.""!

ARGUMENT
I. The Author Has a Right to Intervene to Protect His or Her First Amendment Rights

It is well established in this Circuit that a person whose information is sought from a third
party has a right to intervene to protect his or her interest in non-disclosure. Although the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not address intervention, "Federal courts have frequently
permitted third parties to assert their interests in preventing disclosure of material sought in
criminal proceedings." United States v. Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293, 311 n.67 (D.C. Cir. 1980)
(collecting cases).

Subsequent to Hubbard, this Court has at least twice granted motions to intervene to
challenge grand jury subpoenas. In the first, a political committee moved to intervene when a
grand jury sought documents in the possession of its attorney. This Court's order permitting
intervention is unreported, but the court of appeals noted that the motion was granted, see In re
Sealed Case, 46 F.3d 881, 883 (D.C. Cir. 1998), and held that the intervenor also had standing to
appeal this Court's order enforcing the subpoena - thus necessarily finding the intervention
proper. Id.

Similarly, in Jn re Grand Jury Proceedings, 201 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 1999), this Court
explained that

Even though the grand jury subpoenas sought to be quashed are directed to the

[law] firm and not to [the movant for intervention,] any asserted attorney-client

privilege attaching to these documents would be held by [the movant] as the

client. Where an individual's interest in protecting privileged materials from

compelled disclosure is threatened, and it is clear that [the subpoena's addressee]

will not risk a contempt citation in order to safeguard that interest, "a

paradigmatic case of entitlement to intervention as of right" exists. In re Katz, 623

F.2d 122, 124 (2d Cir. 1980). Therefore, the Court will grant [movant's] motion

to intervene.

Td. at 9.
Case 1:11-mc-00362-RCL Document1 Filed 06/23/11 Page 6 of 30

The D.C. Circuit discussed these principles at length in In re Sealed Case, 237 F.3d 657,
663-665 (D.C. Cir. 2001), where it held that the subject of a confidential Federal Election
Commission (FEC) investigation had a right to intervene in the FEC's subpoena enforcement
action against a third-party where the subject had a legally cognizable interest in maintaining the
confidentiality of documents that the FEC sought to disclose. The Court noted the similarity
between FEC investigations and grand jury proceedings, noting that both are entitled to a strong
presumption of secrecy. /d. at 667. In allowing intervention, the Court emphasized the
importance of allowing the real party in interest to seek to protect its nghts. See id. at 664-665.

In re Sealed Case was a civil proceeding, and intervention rested on Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 24. Other courts have explicitly applied Rule 24(a) in the grand jury context, see, e.g.,
In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 570 (1st Cir. 2001); In re Grand Jury Proceedings,
PHE, Inc., 640 F. Supp 149, 151-52 (E.D.N.C. 1986) ("the grand jury proceeding is an `action'
in which intervention is allowed if the movant can demonstrate a sufficient interest"). And our
Circuit has made it clear that the form of the motion is not dispositive: even if Rule 24 is not
available, third parties can "bring a simple motion to preserve their rights as contemplated in
United States v. Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293 (1980)." In re Sealed Case, 237 F.3d at 664.

Additionally, this Court has supervisory power over the grand jury, see United States v.
Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 346 n.4 (1974) ("The grand jury is subject to the court's supervision in
several respects. In particular, the grand jury must rely on the court to compel production of
books, papers, documents, and the testimony of witnesses, and the court may quash or modify a
subpoena on motion if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.") (internal quotation
and citations omitted), and thus has inherent authority to allow a third party to intervene if the

information sought by a subpoena impinges on the third party's legitimate interest. See In re
Case 1:11-mc-00362-RCL Document1 Filed 06/23/11 Page 7 of 30

Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d 61, 66-67 (1st Cir. 1987); In re Grand Jury (Schmidt), 619
F.2d 1022, 1026-27 (3d Cir.1980). See also Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 608-09
(1972) (noting that the district court had granted Senator Gravel's motion to intervene in grand
jury proceedings to seek to quash a subpoena directed to one of his aides).

Numerous courts have joined this Court in holding that third parties have standing to
move to quash a grand jury subpoena in order to protect their First Amendment rights. See Jn re
First National Bank, Englewood, Colo., 701 F.2d 115, 117-118 (10th Cir. 1983) (anti-tax
organization had standing to challenge grand jury subpoena directing its bank to produce its
records based on claims that the subpoena chilled its mghts under the First Amendment); Jnt'/
Longshoreman's Ass'n v. Waterfront Commission, 667 F.2d 267, 270-72 (2d Cir. 1981) (union
had standing to move to enjoin enforcement of subpoena issued to third party to protect its
members' First Amendment nights); United States v. Citizens State Bank, 612 F.2d 1091, 1094
(8th Cir. 1980) (advocacy organization had right to intervene in action to enforce IRS subpoena
on ground that production of documents would violate its First Amendment rights).

As shown below, the author has an important First Amendment interest in speaking
anonymously on the Internet that will not be protected unless he or she is allowed to intervene.
Intervention should therefore be granted.

II. The Subpoena Should be Quashed Because it Seeks to Infringe the Author's
First Amendment Right of Anonymous Political Advocacy

A. The First Amendment Limits the Investigative Powers of the Grand Jury

Although the grand jury is entitled to a wide range of information in performing its
function of determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been
committed, its "power is not unlimited." United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. at 346. In

particular, a grand jury's investigative powers "are constrained by any valid privilege, whether
Case 1:11-mc-00362-RCL Document 1 Filed 06/23/11 Page 8 of 30

established by the Constitution, statute, or the common law." Jn re Grand Jury Investigation of
Possible Violation of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1461, 706 F. Supp. 2d 11, 13 (D.D.C. 2009).

The First Amendment privilege is one of the privileges constraining the power of the
grand jury, and prosecutors must operate within its bounds. See, e.g., Branzburg v. Hayes, 408
U.S. 665, 708 (1972) ("Grand juries are subject to judicial control and subpoenas to motions to
quash. We do not expect courts will forget that grand juries must operate within the limits of the
First Amendment as well as the Fifth."); Bursey v. United States, 466 F.2d 1059, 1082 (9th Cir.
1992) ("No governmental door can be closed against the [First] Amendment. No governmental
activity is immune from its force. That the setting for the competition between rights secured by
the First Amendment and antagonistic governmental interests is a grand jury proceeding is
simply one of the factors that must be taken into account in striking the appropriate constitutional
balance.").

Thus, this Court has determined that "[i]n order to survive a First Amendment challenge"
to a grand jury subpoena duces tecum, "the government must show that they have a compelling
interest in the sought-after material and that there is a sufficient nexus between the subject matter
of the investigation and the information they seek." Jn re Grand Jury Investigation of Possible
Violation of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1461, 706 F. Supp. 2d 11, 18 (D.D.C. 2009); In re Grand Jury
Subpoena to Kramerbooks & Afterwards, Inc., Nos. 98-MC-135-NHfJ, 98-138-NHJ, 26 Med. L.
Rptr. 1599, 1600 (D.D.C. Apr. 6, 1998). The federal circuits that have addressed this issue have
applied the same standard. See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Duces Tecum, 78 F.3d 1307, 1312
(8th Cir. 1996) (government must "demonstrate a compelling interest in and a sufficient nexus
between the information sought and the subject matter of its investigation"); National

Commodity and Barter Ass'n v. United States, 951 F.2d 1172, 1174 (10th Cir. 1991)
Case 1:11-mc-00362-RCL Document 1 Filed 06/23/11 Page 9 of 30

("government must show a compelling need to obtain the documents . . . [and] that the records
sought bear a substantial relationship to this compelling interest''); In re Grand Jury Proceeding,
842 F.2d 1229, 1233 (11th Cir. 1988) (government must "`convincingly show a substantial
relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state
interest'") (quoting Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Comm., 372 U.S. 539, 546
(1963)); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 776 F.2d 1099, 1102-03 (2d Cir. 1985) ("the interests of
the state must be `compelling,'" and "there must be some `substantial relation' between the
governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed") (citations omitted); Bursey
v. United States, 466 F.2d 1059, 1083 (9th Cir. 1972) (government must establish that its
"interest in the subject matter of the investigation is `immediate, substantial, and subordinating'
[and] that is a `substantial connection' between the information it seeks to have the witness
compelled to supply and the overriding governmental interest in the subject matter of the
investigation") (quoting Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Comm., supra) (overruled in
part on other grounds by In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 863 F.2d 667, 670 (9th Cir. 1998)). A
subpoena for material protected by the First Amendment that cannot meet this standard is
necessarily "unreasonable or oppressive" under Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2), and therefore should

be quashed."

 

? The only circuit that has articulated a different standard is the Fourth, which stated in Jn re
Grand Jury 87-3 Subpoena Duces Tecum, 955 F.2d 229 (4th Cir. 1992), that a court should
"balance the government's need for documents against the possible constitutional infringement
... without placing any special burden on the government." Jd. at 234. This court rejected that
standard in Jn re Grand Jury Investigation of Possible Violation of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1461, 706 F.
Supp. 2d at 18-19, noting that the Fourth Circuit's "reading of Supreme Court precedent is
incorrect . . . because neither case [relied upon by the Fourth Circuit] held a First Amendment
right was implicated by the subpoenas being reviewed, and as such neither court considered
whether the substantial relationship would be the appropriate standard of review for a subpoena
implicating First Amendment interests." Jd. at 19.

As discussed below, the identity of an anonymous Internet speaker is strongly protected
by the First Amendment. A subpoena seeking the author's identity must therefore be quashed
unless the government can demonstrate that the grand jury has a compelling interest in obtaining
the author's identity and that there is a sufficient nexus between the author's identity and a
legitimate investigation into possible criminal activity. Neither showing can be made here.

B. The First Amendment Protects the Right to Speak Anonymously

Robust protection for the right to engage in anonymous communication - to speak, read,
view, listen, and/or associate anonymously - is fundamental to a free society. As the Supreme
Court explained in Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60 (1960):

Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an

important role in the progress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from time

to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and

laws either anonymously or not at all... . Before the Revolutionary War colonial

patriots frequently had to conceal their authorship or distribution of literature that

easily could have brought down on them prosecutions by English-controlled
courts. ... Even the Federalist Papers, written in favor of the adoption of our

Constitution, were published under fictitious names. It is plain that anonymity

has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes.

Id. at 64-65. The Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the importance of the right to speak
anonymously. See, e.g., Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York v. Village of Stratton,
536 U.S. 150, 166-168 (2002) (striking down ordinance requiring identification for door to door
canvassing; noting that "[t]he decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of
economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely be a desire to
preserve as much of one's privacy as possible" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)),
McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission 514 U.S. 334 (1995) (striking down state law

prohibiting distribution of anonymous campaign literature; observing that "[a]nonymity is a

shield from the tyranny of the majority," that "exemplifies the purpose" of the First Amendment
