Case No. 14-CV-0265-CVE-TLW

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO NUTRA PHARMA CORP’S
MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Caleb Salmon, pro se, and submits his Response to Nutra
Pharma Corporation’s Motion for Sanctions.

Doc. No. 86.

In response, Plaintiff would

respectfully show the Court as follows:

INTRODUCTION
Although Nutra Pharma Corporation fails to cite or apply the standard for sanctions, or to
clearly identify exactly what conduct violates the standard, it appears that Nutra Pharma Corp
(“NPC”) asserts that Plaintiff has sued the wrong company and has pled “scandalous and
spurious” allegations. However, Plaintiff carefully selected NPC as a defendant after many
hours of investigation, and legal precedent supports his claims. Plaintiff was highly conservative
and charitable in his characterization of NPC activities, given the likely truth. Finally, NPC has
misrepresented the existence of MyNyloxin.com. NPC claims that MyNyloxin.com was an
independent contractor performing marketing activities; however it was not created as a
separate entity after it made most of the robo-calls to Plaintiff. It was created after this
litigation commenced in an attempt to shield NPC from liability, in the hope that neither Plaintiff
nor this Court would discover when it was actually created.

STATEMENT OF INVESTIGATIVE FACTS
1.

Plaintiff filed suit against telemarketers calling from 321-332-1516 on December

12, 2013, 256-970-2626 on February 19, 2014, and 314-669-2629 on March 26, 2014, which left
very similar messages inviting Plaintiff to join “Johnny Cash” if he wanted “more money in his
life” and referred him to the websites “totalcashcontrol.com” and “yourtotalcashcontrol.com.”
Plaintiff received a call later from October 8, 2014 from 203-295-2626 using the same
phraseology. Doc. 49, ¶¶36-52.
2.

Plaintiff has spent over 200 hours researching, and briefing the Telephone

Consumer Protection Act of 1991, its regulations, and FCC opinions. Exhibit 1.
3.

After discovering that Steve Gewecke was responsible for making some of the

calls to his cell phone, he spent over 6 hours reviewing materials produced by Nutra Pharma
Corp, MyNyloxin, and their distributors prior to filing his First Amended Complaint. Doc. 49.
This included documents, filings, videos, press releases and investor reports. Exhibit 1.
4.

NPC sells a pain reliever made out of cobra poison. Rather than sell this product

through traditional channels such as Walgreens, CVS or Wal-mart, NPC sells it through a multilevel marketing system, where purchasers and users (“distributors”) may in turn sell it to other
people and make commissions from selling it. The more subscribers a distributor has below
them, the more money they can make. In September of 2012, Nutra Pharma Corp began using
TCN International, a.k.a. the “Text Cash Network” to “aggressively market and sell Nyloxin” to
40,000 distributors. Exhibit 2, 3, 4, 5.
5.

“Text Cash Network” morphed into “True Cash Network” in August of 2013 after

it began to market Nyloxin. Exhibit 6.

2

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 101 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/25/15 Page 3 of 9

6.

After Text Cash Network and True Cash Network were accused on the Internet

for having previously run pyramid schemes, the group dropped the use of those names and
referred to themselves as “MyNyloxin.com.” 1 Exhibit 3, 7, 8.
7.

After obtaining permission from this Court, Plaintiff issued subpoenas to several

layers of telecommunications contractors and subcontractors until he discovered the end users of
the first three phone numbers.
8.

The end user of 321-332-1516 sent on December 12, 2013 was Defendant Alan

Turnquist. Exhibit 9.
9.

The end user of 314-669-2629 sent on February 19 was Defendant Darrick

Patterson. Exhibit 10.
10.

The end user of 256-970-2626 sent on March 26 was Reba King. Exhibit 11.

11.

The owner of the “totalcashcontrol.com” and “yourtotalcashcontrol.com” sites

referred to in two of the voicemails from those numbers was Steve Gewecke. Exhibit 12.
12.

On April 3, 2014, Nutra Pharm Corp announced a telemarketing campaign

through the “MyNyloxin Telemarketing Division” aimed at making over “70,000 outbound
phone calls” per day to potential MyNyloxin distributors and customers.2 Exhibit 13.

1

Whether they actually operated pyramid schemes prior to marketing MyNyloxin is unknown at this time. Plaintiff
does not believe that NPC directly operated a pyramid scheme. However, failure to obtain retail outlets for its
product likely made it desperate to move product and forced it into partnership with unscrupulous marketers who
disregarded both the TCPA and SEC regulations. As argued herein, there is ample evidence that NPC knew or
became aware of the violations, yet accepted the benefits and failed to question the methods used. A brief
Internet search of the names involved would have placed NPC on notice of TCN’s prior activities.
2

NPC admits here that the people it was trying to reach with the telemarketing campaign were not current
customers or distributors but essentially “cold calls.”

13.

On April 29, 2014, Steve Gewecke was appointed president of MyNyloxin by Rik

Deitsch, the CEO of NPC, and NPC’s Board of Trustees. Exhibit 14.
14.

Plaintiff received the October 8, 2014 voicemail inviting him to visit

totalcashcontrol.com, a website owned by Steve Gewecke, after Gewecke had been appointed as
president of NPC. Doc. 49, ¶45.
15.

Text Cash Network, Inc. is a dissolved Wyoming corporation as of January 10,

2013. Exhibit 15.
16.

To Plaintiff’s best investigative knowledge, True Cash Network does not exist as

an independent corporate entity. Exhibit 1.
17.

MyNyloxin.com, Inc. was created on September 4, 2014, after Steve Gewecke

became president of it, after NPC began its telemarketing campaign, and after three of the
phone calls to Plaintiff. Exhibit 16.
18.

MyNyloxin.com uses Nyloxin®, a registered trademark of NPC. Exhibit 17.

19.

Steve Gewecke announced that MyNyloxin was using its Direct Response Media

Division to sell “media units.” Exhibit 18.
20.

A “media unit” is an amount of money paid by a distributor that is aggregated

together with investments from other distributors to purchase television advertising for
MyNyloxin. A distributor receives a return on the “media unit” from distributors below who
purchase media units, and also from a share of the product sold by the television advertisement
purchased. Exhibit 19.
21.

To Plaintiff’s best investigative knowledge, MyNyloxin’s “media units” are not

registered as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Exhibit 1.

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 101 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/25/15 Page 5 of 9

ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
Rule 11 requires that “claims...are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law” and
that the “factual contention have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely
have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.”
Fed.R.Civ.P 11(b)(2)-(3).

Because Defendant NPC has challenged the basis of Plaintiff’s

claims, he offers evidence to prove that he has performed substantial investigation that supports
his claims. Plaintiff’s claims against Nutra Pharma Corp as a principal liable for the actions of
its agents and partners are well-taken and solidly grounded in an FCC ruling and existing district
court authority in this Circuit. It is actually NPC that is without a defense in existing case law.
1. A Multi-Level Marketing Seller Can Be Liable for the Actions of Its Distributors Under
Classical Agency Principles.
A multi-level marketing seller (“MLM seller”) is liable for the wrongful acts of its
distributors under standard agency principles when the MLM seller has reason to know of its
acts. See Pontrelli v. Monavie, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114718, 4 (D.N.J. Aug. 19, 2014).
Monavie, the MLM seller in Pontrelli, clearly forbade its distributors from making false claims
about the curative properties of the product, yet knew of fantastical claims being made about the
juice’s curative properties and still accepted the financial benefits of the misrepresentations. Id.
at *8. Because the distributors used Monavie’s trademark with permission and “provided clear
policies and procedures for the Distributors to follow” the distributors were held to be agents of
Monavie, and Monavie was vicariously liable for their actions. Id. at *10-12.
Exactly like the distributors in Pontrelli, NPC’s distributors engaged in wrongful conduct
by autodialing Plaintiff’s cell phone and leaving prerecorded messages in violation of the TCPA.
5

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 101 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/25/15 Page 6 of 9

NPC knew of the violation because its president authorized a telemarketing campaign 70,000
phone calls per day. Unless NPC employed hundreds of telemarketers, it is unlikely it could
make that many dials manually.

Like Monavie, NPC has authorized its MyNyloxin.com

distributors to use its trademark. Exhibit 17. Like Monavie, NPC was well aware of the
telemarketing campaign and accepted the benefits of it. NPC can be held liable on standard
agency principles under the reasoning of Pontrelli. Plaintiff has more than met his duty to allege
facts that “likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation
or discovery.” Fed.R.Civ.P 11(b)(3).
2. A Multi-Level Marketing Seller Can Be Liable for TCPA Violations of Its Distributors
Under Ratification Agency Principles.
Agency principles broaden under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991
(“TCPA”). 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq. A principal may be held liable for the telemarketing actions
of its agent acting with classical authority, apparent authority, or by ratification. In the Matter of
the Joint Petition Filed by Dish Network, LLC, 28 F.C.C.R. 6574, 6584 (F.C.C. May 9, 2013)
(Review dismissed by D.C. Circuit).
A seller may be liable for the acts of another under traditional agency principles if
it ratifies those acts by knowingly accepting their benefits. Such ratification may
occur "through conduct justifiable only on the assumption that the person
consents to be bound by the act's legal consequences."
Id. at 6587(emphasis added). The District Court of Colorado immediately applied this “longawaited ruling” to rule that Dish Network LLC could be held liable “by ratification (such as
when the principal knowingly accepts the benefits of the actor's conduct).” Donaca v. Dish
Network, LLC, 303 F.R.D. 390, 394 (D. Colo. 2014).
[C]onsistent with the statute's consumer protection goals, potential seller liability
will give the seller appropriate incentives to ensure that their telemarketers
comply with our rules. By contrast, allowing the seller to avoid potential liability
6

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 101 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/25/15 Page 7 of 9

by outsourcing its telemarketing activities to unsupervised third parties would
leave consumers in many cases without an effective remedy for telemarketing
intrusions.
Donaca v. Dish Network, LLC, 303 F.R.D. 390, 394 (D. Colo. 2014) (quoting 28 F.C.C.R. 6574,
6588). Under the ruling of the FCC and Donaca, Plaintiff’s investigation indicates that NPC is
likely liable to Plaintiff under ratification principles as well Pontrelli’s classical agency
principles applied specifically to multi-level marketing companies.
3. Plaintiff’s Allegation that NPC Offered
MyNyloxin.com has Reasonable Basis in Fact.

Unregistered

Securities

Through

NPC and MyNyloxin’s Direct Response Media Division is troubling. It is relevant to a
claim under the TCPA because liability for an unsolicited advertisement under 47 C.F.R.
64.1200(a)(2) may be established if the seller or telemarketer encourages “investment
in...property, goods, or services.” 47 C.F.R. 64.1200(f)(9)-(12) Here, Plaintiff asserts that NPC,
through MyNyloxin, intended to encourage him to invest in these “media units.” Perhaps that
was how they intended to help him get “more money in his life today.”
The definition of security in the Securities Act of 1933 is a well-trodden path. The term
“security”
embodies a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation
to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of
the money of others on the promise of profits.
SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299 (U.S. 1946). “Investors provide the capital and
share in the earnings and profits; the promoters manage, control and operate the enterprise.” Id.
at 300. These “media units” were not registered under Regulation A or Regulation D under any
name affiliated with NPC or MyNyloxin.com, which is a requirement under the Securities Act of
1933. Plaintiff’s allegation that NPC engaged in the sale of unregistered securities in violation of
7

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 101 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/25/15 Page 8 of 9

SEC regulations was well-founded because (1) NPC and MyNyloxin’s media units are securities
(2) which are unregistered, (3) in violation of the SEC’s filing requirements and (4) support
Plaintiff’s allegations that NPC is engaged in telemarketing through MyNyloxin.com.
4. NPC Misrepresented MyNyolxin.com’s Existence.
NPC represented that MyNyloxin.com was “simply a distributor of NPC’s products with
its own separate corporate existence. If not an outright lie, it conveniently avoided the fact that it
did not have any corporate existence at the time most of the phone calls were made to Plaintiff,
and at the time Steve Gewecke was appointed as president of MyNyloxin by the CEO of NPC
and NPC’s Board of Directors. MyNyloxin.com was not created until after NPC realized it
had liability under the TCPA in what will be a failed attempt to create a distinction after the fact.
“[A] frivolous motion for sanctions is, in itself, sanctionable.”

Bond v. American

Medical Ass’n, 764 F. Supp. 122, 126 n.3 (N.D. Ill. 1991). Plaintiff will refrain from asking this
Court to sanction NPC on this occasion. However, he has more than carried his burden to show
that his allegations have substantial factual support, and NPC’s Motion for Sanctions should be
denied.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Plaintiff prays this Court DENY Defendant
NPC’s motion, and all other relief deemed just and proper.
Respectfully submitted,
