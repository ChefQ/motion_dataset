PLAINTIFF’S SURREPLY TO DEFENDANT’S REPLY MEMORANDUM
IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS
It is vitally important that the record is clear for purposes of this Court’s decision in this
case. In its Reply, defendant once again attempts to cast plaintiff’s lawsuit under the Federal
Records Act (“FRA”) and understanding of its discussion with defendants regarding the use of
outside email accounts as one in which the plaintiff is seeking information under the FOIA of
communications from the private email accounts of educational publishers. This arguments is
simply ridiculous and a non-sequitur.
Plaintiff is not interested in the private email accounts of outside vendors. The
information plaintiff is interested in and entitled to under the FOIA, and the information that
Education is required to capture under the FRA, are those emails that Education employees
receive from those outside vendors, regardless of the kind of email accounts those vendors use,
that are related to the Reading First and Early Reading programs. This information is covered by
the Federal Records Act and if defendant is allowing its employees to use private email accounts
to conduct official business this is the information that is not being captured in violation of the
FRA. Contrary to defendant’s assertion in its Reply brief, plaintiff has never confirmed that the

statements made by Education employees several times over related to those communications of
employees of educational publishers. Plaintiff seeks no such information, and the record should
be made clear.
In the alternative, and given the conflicting sworn Declarations regarding this issue,
plaintiff requests that the Court hear from the deponents directly in a conference set up with the
parties.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, CREW respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants’
motion to dismiss.
Respectfully submitted,
