Case No. 1:07CV00963-RMU

DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
SURREPLY
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a surreply makes no mention of the applicable legal
standard, let alone meets that standard. Instead, Plaintiff seeks to recast its allegations in an
effort to demonstrate that its Freedom of Information Act claim was properly characterized as a
sustainable claim under the Federal Records Act. Such argument hardly addresses a new matter
first presented in a reply brief as is required to justify a surreply. Defendant has maintained all
along that Plaintiff has not properly pled a claim under the FRA. Accordingly, this Court should
deny Plaintiff’s motion and strike the surreply lodged with that motion.
ARGUMENT
Plaintiff clearly has not met the standard for granting leave to file a surreply. “A surreply
may be filed only by leave of Court, and only to address new matters raised in a reply, to which
a party would otherwise be unable to respond.” United States v. Baroid Corp., 346 F. Supp. 2d
138, 143 (D.D.C. 2004) (emphasis added). Such matters must be “truly new.” United States ex
rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Ctrs. of America, Inc., 238 F. Supp. 2d 270, 277 (D.D.C.

2002). “A surreply is most appropriate where the new matter introduced is factual.” Id.; see,
e.g., Flanagan v. Wyndham Int’l, Inc., 231 F.R.D. 98, 101 (D.D.C. 2005) (granting moving party
leave to file surreply to respond to statements in a supplemental declaration filed with the
opposing party’s reply). Consistent with these authorities, leave should be denied here.
Plaintiff has not identified any “new matter” to which its surreply purports to respond.
Instead, Plaintiff makes another attempt to demonstrate that this action should withstand
dismissal. However, like Plaintiff’s Complaint, the recast allegations in the proposed surreply do
not provide the requisite basis for this Court to decide Plaintiff’s claim under the Federal Records
Act. Plaintiff is still unable to allege that the Department is not properly maintaining the records
Plaintiff seeks in accordance with the FRA – a fact confirmed by Plaintiff’s proposed surreply.
See Plaintiff’s Surreply to Defendant’s Reply Memorandum in Further Support of its Motion to
Dismiss at 1 (“if defendant is allowing its employees to use private emails accounts to conduct
official business this is the information that is not being captured in violation of the FRA”
(emphasis added)). Moreover, as Defendant previously has demonstrated, even if the alleged
policy authorizing Department employees to conduct official business through private emails
exists, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that its alleged injury is traceable to any such policy.
Defendant first made these arguments in its motion to dismiss and Plaintiff had every
opportunity to respond, if it could, in its Opposition. See Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for
Lack of Jurisdiction at 11 (identifying specific allegations demonstrating that “Plaintiff merely
speculates that documents responsive to its request are not properly being maintained”); id. at 13
(demonstrating that “to the extent that Plaintiff has suffered any injury at all, it is traceable to its
refusal to accept the denial of its fee waiver request and its failure to submit an appropriately

narrow FOIA request”); id. at 14 (demonstrating that Plaintiff’s allegations concerning whether
the Department “is properly retaining and disposing of emails from personal accounts” are
conditional or otherwise insufficient to provide the requisite factual basis). That Plaintiff failed
to respond adequately in its Opposition is an insufficient basis to permit a surreply. See Reply in
Support of Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction at 4, 6, and 9 (demonstrating
that Plaintiff’s Opposition failed to address arguments raised in Defendant’s motion to dismiss).
Plaintiff is simply not entitled to another filing to raise arguments that it could have raised in its
Opposition.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Department of Education respectfully requests that the
Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Surreply.
