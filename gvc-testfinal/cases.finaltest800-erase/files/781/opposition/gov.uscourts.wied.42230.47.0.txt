Case No. 06-CR-320

DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

I. Background
On December 5, 2006, a federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment charging
David R. Olofson with knowingly transferring a machinegun in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
922(o). Olofson has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, contending (1) that Congress’s
power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce does not allow it to criminalize intrastate
machinegun transfers, and (2) that the Second Amendment guarantees Olofson the right to
transfer a machinegun. For the reasons set forth below, each of these arguments is without
merit,1 and the government asks the Court to recommend that Olofson’s motion be denied.

Olofson acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent;
he raises the issues to preserve them for appeal.

II. Analysis
A.

Section 922(o) – even to the extent that it prohibits intrastate transfers of
machineguns – represents a valid exercise of Congressional power under the
Commerce Clause.
Congress can regulate three categories of activity under its commerce power: (1) the

use of the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the use of the instrumentalities of interstate
commerce; and (3) those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.
United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S.549, 558-59 (1995). An intrastate transfer of a machinegun
like that alleged to have been committed by Olofson cannot be justified under either of the
first two categories. Such transfers do, however, have a substantial affect upon interstate
commerce and therefore fall within the third category. United States v. Kenney, 91 F.3d 884
(7 th Cir. 1996); cf. Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (upholding the Controlled Substances
Act’s regulation of purely local activity because of its substantial effect on interstate
commerce); United States v. Stewart, 451 F.3d 1071 (9 th Cir. 2006) (holding that
criminalization of simple possession of a machinegun manufactured intrastate was valid
exercise of Congress’s commerce power).
As Olofson recognizes, this Court is bound by Kenney, which forecloses the argument
he makes here. Nonetheless, to preserve the issue for appeal, Olofson contends that Kenney
is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598
(2000), particularly given that his was alleged to have been an intrastate transfer.
In Morrison, the Court identified four considerations to guide the determination of

2

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 04/23/07 Page 2 of 6 Document 47

whether intrastate activity substantially affects interstate commerce and therefore falls within
Congress’s Article I, Section 8 authority: (1) whether the regulated activity is commercial or
economic in nature; (2) whether an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute
to limit its reach; (3) whether Congress made express findings about the effects of the
proscribed activity on interstate commerce; and (4) whether the link between the prohibited
activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated. Stewart, 451 F.3d at 1074 (citing
Morrison, 529 U.S. at 610-12); United States v. Peters, 403 F.3d 1263, 1272 (11 th Cir. 2005)
(citing Morrison, 529 U.S. at 610-12).
Olofson argues that the intrastate transfer of a machinegun falls short on each of these
factors. The type of analysis in which he engages, however, was rejected by the Supreme
Court in Raich. There, the Court considered whether the Controlled Substances Act could
constitutionally be applied to intrastate possession of marijuana for medicinal purposes. In
upholding that application of the Act, the Court noted that “Congress can regulate purely
intrastate activity that is not itself ‘commercial,’ in that it is not produced for sale, if it
concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the
interstate market. . . .” Raich, 545 U.S. at 18 (citing Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111
(1942)).
This principal applies with equal force to the regulation of the possession and transfer
of machineguns: The prohibition on possessing and transferring machineguns is an essential
part of the federal scheme of regulation of interstate commerce in dangerous weapons. See

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 04/23/07 Page 3 of 6 Document 47

United States v. Haney, 264 F.3d 1161, 1168-69 (10 th Cir. 2001).2 Where, as here, a general
regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the fact that a particular instance
falling under that statute may not have itself affected interstate commerce is of no
consequence. Raich, 545 U.S. at 17; Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558; Wickard, 317 U.S. at 128-29.
B.

The Second Amendment does not confer upon all individual citizens an
unqualified right to transfer machineguns.
It is well-established in this Circuit that criminal statutes do not run afoul of the Second

Amendment merely by prohibiting gun possession by certain categories of individuals. E.g.,
United States v. Price, 328 F.3d 958, 961 (7 th Cir. 2003)(upholding the federal felon-inpossession statute against Second Amendment attack); United States v. Hemmings, 258 F.3d
587, 594 (7 th Cir. 2001)(upholding constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 922(g)(9));
Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 710-11 (7 th Cir. 1999)(rejecting Second
Amendment challenge to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), which prohibits those convicted of
misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence from possessing a firearm). See also Lewis v.
United States, 445 U.S. 55, 65, n.8 (1980)(stating that predecessor statute prohibiting

Olofson also notes the lack of specific Congressional findings as to the affect of
transferring a machinegun on interstate commerce. The Raich Court responded to a similar
argument: “[W]e have never required Congress to make particularized findings in order to
legislate . . . While congressional findings are certainly helpful in reviewing the substance of a
congressional statutory scheme, particularly when the connection to commerce is not selfevident, and while we will consider congressional findings in our analysis when they are
available, the absence of particularized findings does not call into question Congress’ authority to
legislate.” Raich, 545 U.S. at 21. And, in any event, Congress has specifically found that as a
general matter “firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate commerce.” 18 U.S.C. §
922(q)(1)(C).

possession of firearms by convicted felons “do[es] not trench upon any constitutionally
protected liberties.”).

As Olofson recognizes, this controlling authority forecloses his

constitutional argument.
Moreover, the Second Amendment protects (at least under certain circumstances)
keeping and bearing arms. Olofson contends that the Second Amendment guarantees him the
right to transfer a machinegun. The type of activity with which Olofson is charged does not,
at least as a textual matter, fall squarely within the compass of the Second Amendment. Even
if, as Olofson suggests, the tide of judicial interpretation is moving toward the individual
rights model, it is not clear that the tide will sweep up all possessory and non-possessory
firearms activity.

III. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the government respectfully requests that the Court
recommend that Olofson’s motion to dismiss the indictment be denied.
