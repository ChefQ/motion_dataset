UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
Case No. 06-CR-320

v.
DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT
David R. Olofson, by counsel, moves to dismiss the indictment, which
charges him with transferring a machine gun, contrary to 18 U.S.C. § 922(o).
Olofson argues that Congress exceeded its authority to regulate interstate commerce
when it prohibited the intrastate transfer of a machine gun. Olofson also argues that
prohibiting the transfer of a machine gun infringes Olofson’s Second Amendment
right to keep and bear arms. Olofson, however, acknowledges that controlling
Seventh Circuit caselaw conflicts with his positions, and only raises these issues to
preserve the matters for appeal.
A.

Interstate Commerce

Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to
“regulate commerce . . . among the several States.” This power is intrepreted to

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 04/12/07 Page 1 of 5 Document 46

allow Congress to regulate three categories of economic activity: 1) the use of the
channels of interstate commerce; 2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce; and
3) those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce. United States
v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-59 (1995).
In United States v. Kenney, 91 F.3d 884 (7th Cir. 1996), the Seventh Circuit
held that § 922(o) is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s Commerce Clause
authority under the third category--that regulating machine guns is within the scope
of congressional power over activities having a substantial relation to interstate
commerce. Id. at 890.
Olofson argues that, as applied to him, § 922(o) exceeded Congress’s
authority to regulate interstate commerce because the indictment alleges purely
intrastate activities. Olofson also maintains that Kenney conflicts with the Supreme
Court’s decision in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000). In Morrison, the
Court established a four-part test to determine whether Congress exercised
authority over an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce: 1) whether
the regulated activity is commercial or economic in nature; 2) whether an express
jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach; 3) whether
Congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed activity on
interstate commerce; and 4) whether the link between the prohibited activity and the
effect on interstate commerce is attenuated.

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 04/12/07 Page 2 of 5 Document 46

Here, Olofson’s transfer of the gun was not commercial or economic
because he did not receive any money for the gun. Section 922(o) does not contain
a jurisdictional element limiting its reach. Congress has made no express findings
about how transferring an alleged machine gun affects interstate commerce. See
United States v. Stewart, 451 F.3d 1071, 1074 (9th Cir. 2006). Finally, the link between
Olofson’s transfer of the alleged machine gun and interstate commerce is attenuated
in that the government has not produced evidence that Olofson’s alleged machine
gun stimulated a demand for anything illegal. The government has not produced
evidence that Olofson received or possessed parts that were not legally available.
Further, the government cannot show that Olofson’s transfer of the alleged machine
gun affected demand as there is no evidence that the person to whom the gun was
transferred would have bought a machine gun from a commercial source had he not
received the gun from Olofson.
Olofson therefore argues that, as applied to this case, § 922(o) was not
a valid exercise of Congress’s authority to regulate activity that has a substantial
relation to interstate commerce. However, Olofson acknowledges that this Court is
bound by the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Kenney that holds to the contrary.
B.

Second Amendment

The Second Amendment states: “A well regulated Militia, being
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 04/12/07 Page 3 of 5 Document 46

Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Olfoson argues that the Second Amendment

gurantees to him the right to transfer a machine gun.
The Seventh Circuit holds that Second Amendment rights do not inure
to the individual, but to the people collectively. Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185
F.3d 693, 710 (7th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit concluded, “the
Second Amendment establishes no right to possess a firearm apart from the role
possession of the gun might play in maintaining a state militia.” Id.
The Seventh Circuit’s “collective rights” model is in conflict with two
circuit courts. The Fifth Circuit held in United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 260
(5th Cir. 2001) that the Second Amendment “protects individual Americans in their
right to keep and bear arms whether or not they are a member of a select militia or
performing active military service or training.” Similarly, the District of Columbia
Circuit held just one month ago that the Second Amendment protects an
individual’s right to keep and bear arms and that enjoyment of that right is not
contingent upon the individual’s membership in a militia. Parker v. District of
Columbia, 478 F.3d 370, 395 (D.C. Cir. 2007).
Olofson believes that the tide of judicial interpretation of the Second
Amendment is moving toward the individual rights model. Nevertheless, he
understands that this Court is bound by the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Gillespie
and only raises this issue to preserve his appellate rights.
