DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PARTIAL
RECONSIDERATION AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendants MARK P. BECKER, in his official capacity as Georgia State
University President, et al. (collectively, “Defendants”), through their undersigned
counsel, hereby respond to Plaintiffs Cambridge University Press; Oxford
University Press, Inc.; and SAGE Publications, Inc.’s (“Plaintiffs’”) Motion for
Partial Reconsideration and Supporting Memorandum of Law (Dkt. 237)
(“Plaintiffs’ Motion”) and show the Court the following in opposition thereof:
Plaintiffs are before the Court again, this time seeking reconsideration of the
Court’s Order related to the same issues addressed or implicated in many prior
briefs, i.e., whether Defendants infringed Plaintiffs’ copyrights. (Dkt. 141-66, 185-1-

Filed 11/08/10 Page 2 of 19

96, 202-04, 206-15, 219, 221-33.) Plaintiffs’ most recent submission is the fiftyfourth docket entry on this subject, and falls far short of the high burden they must
carry to justify a motion for reconsideration. Further, their arguments are, as stated
previously and held by this Court, without justification.

BACKGROUND
A.

Court’s Order

When faced with cross-motions for summary judgment, a district court is not
required to grant judgment as a matter of law to one side or the other; rather, the
court is to evaluate each party’s motion on its own merits, taking care in each
instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under
consideration. Invacare Corp. v. Healthdyne Techns., Inc., 968 F. Supp. 1578,
1582 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (Cooper, J.) (citing Heublein, Inc. v. United States, 996 F.2d
1455 (2d Cir. 1993)). That is precisely what this Court did here.
After evaluating each party’s multiple briefs, this Court correctly found that
there were undisputed material facts: (1) Defendants are officials of Georgia State
University (“Georgia State”) and the University System of Georgia (September 30
Order, Dkt. 235 at 7); (2) “The Board of Regents has general supervisory authority
over Georgia State’s operations” (id.); (3) “the Current Policy encourages
instructors to make fair use determinations and to use the fair use doctrine as a

-2-

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 3 of 19

means of using copyrighted works in their courses” (id. at 17); (4) Georgia State as
an entity is not capable of copying or reproducing copyrighted materials or making
the individual fair use determinations” (id. at 19); and (5) Georgia State cannot be
held directly liable for actions of the individual instructors (id.).
Based on these undisputed material facts, this Court properly and correctly
granted Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on direct infringement. In its
order partially granting Defendants’ motion (Dkt. 160), this Court appropriately
found that no evidence was presented that shows that “Defendants can be held
directly liable for copyright infringement which could have occurred after the 2009
Copyright Policy was enacted.” (Dkt. 235 at 19.) This Court also rightly found
that, as a matter of law and based on the evidence before it, Plaintiffs cannot
establish that Defendants can be held directly liable for actions of the individual
instructors through a respondeat superior theory.

(Id.)

As the Court noted,

“Plaintiffs cite no case in which a party was held directly liable, as opposed to
indirectly liable, for copyright infringements of another through the doctrine of
respondeat superior.” (Id. at 18.)
B.

Plaintiffs’ Motion

Plaintiffs’ Motion argues that reconsideration of the September 30 Order is
warranted because “the Order erroneously rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that

-3-

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 4 of 19

employers are strictly liable for direct copyright infringement committed by their
employees under respondeat superior.”1 (Dkt. 237 at 1, 6.)
II.

ARGUMENT AND CITATIONS OF AUTHORITY
A.

Plaintiffs Have
Reconsideration

Not

Met

Their

Burden

to

Warrant

Motions for reconsideration bear a high threshold of proof, which Plaintiffs
have not met.
Motions for reconsideration “shall not be filed as a matter of routine
practice” and should only be filed when “absolutely necessary.” LR 7.2E, NDGa.;
see also Isotec Int’l, Inc. v. Stankiewicz Int’l Corp., No. 04-cv-788, 2006 WL
1553829, at *1 (N.D. Ga. May 30, 2006) (Forrester, J.) (“A motion for
reconsideration is an extraordinary remedy.”). “Such absolute necessity arises
where there is ‘(1) newly discovered evidence; (2) an intervening development or
change in controlling law; or (3) a need to correct a clear error of law or fact.’”
The Coca-Cola Co. v. Pepsi-Cola Co., 500 F. Supp. 2d 1364, 1367 (N.D. Ga.
2007) (Story, J.) (quoting Bryan v. Murphy, 246 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1258-59 (N.D.
Ga. 2003) (Martin, J.)); see also Adams v. IBM Corp., No. 05-cv-3308, 2007 WL

1

Plaintiffs’ second ground for reconsideration—that the Court’s limit on the uses
at issue with regard to the remaining claim (Dkt. 237 at 19-25)—was addressed by
the Court’s Nov. 5, 2010 Order (Dkt. 240), and therefore is not addressed here.

14293, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 2, 2007) (Thrash, J.); Deerskin Trading Post, Inc. v.
United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc., 972 F. Supp. 665, 674 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (Hull, J.).
It is improper on a motion for reconsideration to “ask the court to rethink
what it ha[s] already thought through--rightly or wrongly.” Above the Belt, Inc. v.
Mel Bohannan Roofing, Inc., 99 F.R.D. 99, 101 (E.D. Va. 1983) (quoted in Weitz
Co. v. Transp. Ins. Co., No. 08-23183, 2009 WL 1636125, at *1 (S.D. Fla. June 11,
2009) and Vidinliev v. Carey Int’l, Inc., No. 07-CV-762, 2008 WL 5459335, at *1
(N.D. Ga. Dec. 15, 2008) (Thrash, J.)). Indeed, “[g]iven the narrow scope of
motions for reconsideration in this Court, there are a variety of circumstances
under which a motion for reconsideration is inappropriate.” Enwonwu v. Trans
Union, LLC, No. 03-CV-282, 2005 WL 1420857, at *2 (June 1, 2005) (Evans, J.);
see also P.E.A.C.H. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 916 F. Supp. 1557, 1560 (N.D.
Ga. 1995) (O’Kelley, J.). A motion for reconsideration should not, for example, be
used to tell the court how it “‘could have done it better’ the first time.” Enwonwu,
2005 WL 1420857, at *2 (internal quotation marks omitted). It also should not
“present the court with arguments already heard and dismissed or . . . repackage
familiar arguments to test whether the court will change its mind.” Id. Nor can a
motion for reconsideration “‘offer new legal theories or evidence that could have
been presented in conjunction with the previously filed motion or response, unless

-5-

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 6 of 19

a reason is given for failing to raise the issue at an earlier stage in the litigation.’”
Id.
Plaintiffs have not shown newly discovered evidence, a change in
controlling law, or clear error. Indeed, Plaintiffs merely repackage their prior
direct liability theory and claim “clear error in hopes that this Court will change its
mind. (Dkt. 237 at 6-7.) Plaintiffs are not entitled to a reconsideration of this
Court’s earlier ruling on such grounds, and this Court need not exercise its sound
discretion, see Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. State of Fla. Dept. of Health
and Rehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1216 (11th Cir. 2000), to grant this
extraordinary remedy, Whitesell Corp. v. Electrolux Home Prods., Inc., No. CV
103-050, 2010 WL 4025943, at *7 (S.D. Ga. Oct. 13, 2010) (Bowen, J.) (indicating
the grant of a motion to reconsider is an extraordinary remedy to be employed
sparingly) (citing Region 8 Forest Servs. Timber Purchasers Council v. Alcock,
993 F.2d 800, 805-06 (11th Cir. 1993)).

“In considering a motion for

reconsideration, a court must balance the need for finality and judicial economy
against the need to render just decisions.” Id. In the absence of any valid reason
for reconsideration, the balance here militates in favor of denial.
Indeed, having obtained only limited success through the arguments in their
original motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 142) and in opposition to Defendants’

-6-

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 7 of 19

(Dkt. 185), Plaintiffs—without any explanation or suggestion why any arguments
could not have been raised earlier—simply ask that the Court exercise its
discretion to reopen the matter and consider new legal theories. But Plaintiffs’
Motion presents no persuasive factual or legal basis for the Court to do so under
the circumstances.

Rather, Plaintiffs could have raised all such arguments

regarding direct infringement during summary judgment briefing.
Plaintiffs now argue that “Defendants are strictly liable for any direct
copyright infringements committed by GSU employees within the scope of their
employment regardless of whether they personally participated in, contributed to,
or benefited from the infringement.” (Dkt. 237 at 7.) The Court’s holding that
Defendants could not be held directly liable for the actions of individual instructors
was directly on point. Plaintiffs simply argue that it was “erroneous.” (Id. at 6.)
To paraphrase Judge Birch, this constitutes a second—but untimely—bite at
the apple. See Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., 555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir.
2009). The Court should not entertain these untimely arguments now and can rest
this Order entirely on that procedural basis. Besides, no error was committed—to
the contrary, the Court followed the case law to the letter.

There Is No Respondeat Superior Liability for State Government
in the Copyright Context

Plaintiffs allege that direct liability can be imposed through the principle of
respondeat superior, and, as such, Plaintiffs need only show direct infringement by
Defendants’ employees acting within the scope of their employment to establish
Defendants’ direct liability. (Dkt. 237 at 9-10 (citing, inter alia, Sygma Photo
News, Inc. v. High Soc’y Magazine, Inc., 596 F. Supp. 28, 33 (S.D.N.Y. 1984),
aff’d, 778 F.2d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 1985)).) To support their argument, Plaintiffs’ cite
various cases that actually undermine their position. And contrary to Plaintiffs’
assertion, as described in the case law, in copyright, the agency principles of
respondeat superior developed into vicarious infringement, not direct infringement.
See Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Akonic Solutions, Inc., 591 F. Supp. 2d 1098,
1109 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (citing Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Int’l Serv. Ass’n, 494 F. 3d
788, 802 (9th Cir. 2007)).
1.

Respondeat Superior Cannot Support the Injunctive Relief
Plaintiffs Seek

When a plaintiff sues a state official in his official capacity, the suit
represents simply “‘another way of pleading an action against an entity of which
[the named official] is an agent.’” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985)
(quoting Monell v. N.Y. City Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978)); see

-8-

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 9 of 19

also Hill v. DeKalb Reg. Youth Det. Ctr., 40 F.3d 1176, 1184 n.16 (11th Cir.
1994); Ritchie v. Wickstrom, 938 F.2d 689, 691 (6th Cir. 1991). Thus, an action
against a government official in his official capacity is an action against the
government itself and liability is therefore limited; it cannot rest on mere
respondeat superior theory—that one of the defendants supervised the one who
acted—for proof. See Lozano v. Smith, 718 F.2d 756, 768 (5th Cir. 1983) (holding
Sheriff not liable on basis of vicarious liability for the acts or omissions of his
deputies).

In other words, supervisory government officials cannot be held

vicariously liable solely on the basis of their employer-employee relationship. See
Kline v. North Tex. State Univ., 782 F.2d 1229, 1234 (5th Cir. 1986); see also
Reeves v. Thigpen, 879 F. Supp. 1153, 1178 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (respondeat superior
is an insufficient basis to hold a state agency liable for prospective injunctive
relief).
Rather, an official may be held liable only if (1) he is personally involved in
the acts causing a constitutional deprivation or (2) a sufficient causal connection
exists between his act and the constitutional violation. See Thompkins v. Belt, 828
F.2d 298, 304 (5th Cir. 1987); see also Clay v. Conlee, 815 F.2d 1164, 1170 (8th
Cir. 1987).

To hold supervisory officials accountable for the acts of their

subordinates, one must establish “more than a simple ratification of an

-9-

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 10 of 19

impermissible act when the ratification is based on independent legitimate
reasons.” Bowen v. Watkins, 669 F.2d 979, 988 (5th Cir. 1982). Negligence does
not suffice. See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir.
1989); Meriwether v. Coughlin, 879 F.2d 1037, 1048 (2d Cir. 1989); Howard v.
Adkinson, 887 F.2d 134, 137-38 (8th Cir. 1989). To prevail, Plaintiffs must show
that the named individuals were “personally involved” in the alleged violations, see
Watson v. Interstate Fire & Casualty Co., 611 F.2d 120, 123 (5th Cir. 1980), or
“affirmatively adopt[ed] policies which are wrongful or illegal.” Vela v. White,
703 F.2d 147, 153 (5th Cir. 1983). And while failure to supervise can suffice, it
only applies if that failure amounts to gross negligence or deliberate indifference,
as opposed to “ordinary negligence, inadvertence or managerial incompetence.”
Kline, 782 F.2d at 1235 (citing Bowen, 669 F.2d at 988).
Contrary to Plaintiffs’ position, the named defendants are not and cannot be
directly liable under a theory of respondeat superior for the action of their
employees without “personally participat[ing] in, contribut[ing] to, or benefit[ing]
from the infringement.”

(See Dkt. 237 at 7.)

No causal line between the

Defendants and the claimed copyright infringement was shown. See, e.g., Durmer
v. O’Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 69 n.14 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding § 1983 liability cannot
be proven through the doctrine of respondeat superior); Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d

- 10 -

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 11 of 19

1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989) (“A supervisor is only liable for constitutional
violations of his subordinates if the supervisor participated in or directed the
violations, or knew of the violations and failed to act to prevent them.”); West v.
Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (stating the plaintiff must show that the defendant
was personally involved in the deprivation); Kentucky, 473 U.S. at 166 (stating the
plaintiff must show that the official’s conduct caused the deprivation of a federally
protected right).

Plaintiffs did not and cannot prove that any of the named

defendants did something or failed to do something which he ought to have done
or refrained from doing, to proximately cause violation of Plaintiffs’ copyrights.
See Bowen, 669 F.2d at 988-89.
2.

The Cases Plaintiffs Cite Undermine Their Argument

The cases Plaintiffs’ cite do not support their theory. For example, Plaintiffs
cite Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H.L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304, 307 (2d Cir. 1963),
for the proposition that “the law holds the employer strictly liable for the direct
infringements committed by its employees through the doctrine of respondeat
superior.” (Dkt. 237 at 8.) The Shapiro Court, however, employed vicarious
liability, not direct; created a two-part test for determining vicarious liability; and
noted only that the concept was an outgrowth of the agency principles of
respondeat superior. See Shapiro, 316 F.2d at 307-08; see also Banff Ltd. v. Ltd.,

- 11 -

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 12 of 19

Inc., 859 F. Supp. 1103, 1107 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (calling Shapiro the “leading case
on vicarious copyright infringement” and indicating that for vicarious liability
there must be actual control, not just the potential to control).
Similarly, the district court in Sygma found secondary liability on “[t]he
principles of contributory infringement and respondeat superior” rather than direct
liability, and cited Shapiro. Sygma, 596 F. Supp. at 33. The Second Circuit
likewise relied on Shapiro in ruling that “[a]ll persons and corporations who
participate in, exercise control over, or benefit from the infringement are jointly
and severally liable as copyright infringers,” thereby calling out the precise
elements to prove vicarious liability. Sygma, 778 F.2d at 92.
In Letterese & Associates, Inc. v. World Institute of Scientology Enterprises,
International, the district court “assumed” liability and ruled that the infringement
was barred by laches and use was permissible under the fair use doctrine. 533 F.3d
1287, 1293, 1298 (11th Cir. 2008). The Eleventh Circuit determined that there
were genuine issues of material fact on those defenses and remanded for further
proceedings.

Id. at 1293, 1323.

It did not hold “defendant Scientology

organizations directly liable for copying of plaintiff’s book by their employees,” as
Plaintiffs suggest.

See id.; see also Dkt. 237 at 8.

And in Harper & Row

Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, the publication was liable for its own

- 12 -

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 13 of 19

publication of the copyrighted work, not, as Plaintiffs claim, for direct
infringement by [the] employee editor” (Dkt. 237 at 8) who wrote the piece that
contained the copyrighted material. 471 U.S. 539 (1985).
Finally, Plaintiffs contend that Sparks—a case this Court relied on for
finding respondeat superior liability is indirect liability—actually held that if an
employee accused of harassment was acting within the scope of his employment,
the employer would be strictly and directly liable for the harassment (“without the
need for any additional showing”), and, thus, Defendants should be strictly and
directly liable for the alleged infringements of the instructors. (Dkt. 237 at 9 n.3
(citing Sparks v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc., 830 F.2d 1554, 1559 (11th Cir.
1987))). Plaintiffs’ interpretation of Sparks is error. See Huddleston v. Roger
Dean Chevrolet, Inc., 845 F.2d 900, 904 (11th Cir. 1988) (“In order to establish
direct liability, that is, that defendant knew or should have known of the
harassment but failed to respond with prompt and effective action, plaintiff must
show that she ‘complained to higher management of the problem or . . .
demonstrate that the harassment was so pervasive that an inference of constructive
knowledge arises.’”).
Abrogation of Plaintiffs’ proposition was recognized by Turner v. Randolph
County, N.C., 912 F. Supp. 182, 185 (M.D.N.C. 1995) (citing Busby v. City of

- 13 -

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 14 of 19

Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir. 1991)). Similarly, another court noted the
“[a]pplication of the rule of Sparks, however, is limited.” Cabaniss v. Coosa
Valley Med. Ctr., No. 93-PT-2710-E, 1995 WL 241937, at *22 (N.D. Ala. Mar. 20,
1995). Indeed, the Cabaniss court ruled that “to establish respondeat superior
liability, plaintiff must show that the employer ‘knew or should have known of the
harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action.’” Id. (citing
Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11th Cir. 1982)).
Recognizing the limited holding of Sparks, the court in Sullivan v. Lake
Region Yacht & Country Club, Inc., ruled that “an employer is only liable for
sexual harassment by one of its supervisors, under a theory of respondeat superior.
‘Consequently, the plaintiff cannot prevail unless she can show that her employer
'knew or should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take
prompt remedial action.'’” 996 F. Supp. 1463, 1465 (M.D. Fla. Mar 18, 1998)
(citing Sparks, 830 F.2d at 1557 and quoting Henson, 682 F.2d at 904).
None of the case law cited by Plaintiffs in its motion for reconsideration
addresses, distinguishes, or contradicts the legal support justifying the Court’s
Order.

Nor does anything presented in Plaintiffs’ Motion cast doubt on this

Court’s decision to grant Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment of no direct
infringement. Both parties extensively briefed the facts and law on this and other

- 14 -

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 241

Filed 11/08/10 Page 15 of 19

issues. The latest pleading presents new issues that could have been timely raised
without demonstrating a clear and obvious error in the Court’s Order. There is
nothing more to consider or reconsider. Defendants submit that Plaintiffs’ Motion
should be denied.
III.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs have failed to set forth sufficient grounds on which this Court

should reconsider its grant of summary judgment of direct infringement to
Defendants. In particular, Plaintiffs have not shown any intervening change in
controlling law, any new evidence, any error in this Court’s summary judgment
rulings, or any persuasive argument that this Court’s summary judgment rulings
resulted in any injustice, manifest or otherwise. To the contrary, as shown by
Plaintiffs’ reliance on case law that actually supports the Court’s Order, there is no
error here.

All of the arguments laid out by Plaintiffs in their motion were

previously and exhaustively briefed by the parties, or could have been, and
considered by this Court. As such, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Reconsideration
should be denied.
