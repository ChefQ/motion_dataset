INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Cambridge University Press (“Cambridge”), Oxford University
Press, Inc. (“Oxford”), and SAGE Publications, Inc. (“SAGE”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) submit this motion for partial reconsideration of the Court’s
September 30, 2010 Order and supporting memorandum of law pursuant to L.R.
7.2(E). That rule authorizes reconsideration where necessary to correct clear error
or prevent manifest injustice.1 Two aspects of the Order warrant reconsideration
under this standard.
First, because the Order erroneously rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that
employers are strictly liable for direct copyright infringements committed by their
employees under respondeat superior – both generally and as applied to the
official-capacity defendants in this action – the Court improperly dismissed
Plaintiffs’ direct infringement claims and limited Plaintiffs to proving their case by
establishing liability under a contributory infringement theory.
Second, the Order directed further proceedings on the issue of potential
“ongoing and continuous” infringements by Defendants, including by way of
further discovery. At the same time, the Order limited the universe of evidence

See, e.g., Preserve Endangered Areas of Cobb’s History (P.E.A.C.H.) v. United
States Army Corps of Engineers, 916 F. Supp. 1557, 1560 (N.D. Ga. 1995), aff’d,

that Plaintiffs may use to make that showing to claimed infringements identified in
response to the Court’s August 11, 2010 and August 12, 2010 Orders, which only
asked for information during three terms in 2009 and gave Plaintiffs ten days to
identify such infringements. Yet there is reason to believe that not only were there
additional infringements during those terms, but also that “ongoing and
continuous” infringements continued during more recent academic terms,
including Spring 2010 (evidence as to which was introduced by Defendants
themselves as part of their summary judgment filings). Consequently, Plaintiffs
seek an expansion of the permissible scope of evidence and discovery relating
thereto to encompass additional conduct during 2009 as well as conduct in 2010 in
order to give the Court a more complete picture of the infringing activities that lie
at the heart of this lawsuit.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
In this copyright infringement case, Plaintiffs, leading academic publishers,
have alleged that Georgia State University (“GSU”) employees have infringed the
copyrights in Plaintiffs’ works on a continuing and systematic basis. In support of
that position, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment against Defendants –
officials at GSU responsible for and capable of halting the complained-of
infringements. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and, as part
811163.1

2

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 7 of 32

of that motion, appended a report listing activity on the GSU ERes system during
the Spring 2010 semester. Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ summary
judgment motion also was accompanied by five declarations from GSU professors
(the “Professor Declarations”) describing their experience under the newly adopted
GSU copyright policy, including during the Spring 2010 semester.
Following the summary judgment briefing, the Court issued orders on
August 11 and August 12, 2010 that directed the Plaintiffs to file within ten days
detailed information about any alleged infringements that occurred after the
implementation of GSU’s new copyright policy and that were reflected in GSU
courses taught during the 2009 Maymester or Summer 2009 or Fall 2009 terms and
directed Defendants to file a response ten days later. Order, Docket No. 226.
Plaintiffs filed the information they were able to collect in the time allowed on
August 20, 2010. Defendants filed responses to Plaintiffs’ submissions on August
31, 2010 and September 15, 2010.2
On September 30, 2010, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ summary judgment
motion. Cambridge Univ. Press, et al. v. Mark P. Becker, et al., No. 1:08-CV2

Hereinafter Plaintiffs’ Response to the August Orders, Docket No. 228, is
referred to as “Plaintiffs’ Response” or “Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Filing”;
Defendants’ Response, comprising Docket Nos. 230 and 233, is referred to as
“Defendants’ Response,” and the parties’ collective responses to the August Orders
are referred to as the “August Submissions.”

1425-ODE (Sept. 30, 2010) (“Order”) at 31. Relying in part on the Professor
Declarations, the Court granted Defendants’ motion as to Plaintiffs’ direct and
vicarious infringement claims but denied it as to Plaintiffs’ contributory
infringement claims, holding that the record as developed did not speak to the
question of “whether in practice the current [copyright] policy is encouraging
improper application of the fair use defense.” Id. at 29-30.
The Court explained that “in order to show that Defendants are responsible
for the copyright infringement alleged in this case, Plaintiffs must show that the
2009 Copyright Policy resulted in ongoing and continuous misuse of the fair use
defense.” Id. at 30. To do so, the Court instructed Plaintiffs to put forth evidence
of “a sufficient number of instances of infringement” of their copyrights. Id.
However, the Court limited the scope of further proceedings to the lists of claimed
infringements produced in response to the Court’s August 11, 2010 and August 12,
2010 Orders. Id.
ARGUMENT
I.

DEFENDANTS CAN BE HELD LIABLE UNDER EX PARTE YOUNG
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO DOCTRINES OF SECONDARY
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
As the Court recognized in its September 30 Order, Plaintiffs’ First

Amended Complaint alleged that GSU employees infringed Plaintiffs’ copyrights
811163.1

4

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 9 of 32

“by scanning, copying, displaying and distributing Plaintiffs’ copyrighted material
– including but not limited to each copyrighted work identified on Exhibit 1 – on a
widespread and continuing basis via the Georgia State website and other Georgia
State computers and servers.” Order at 16 (quoting Docket No. 39 at 29). In their
summary judgment briefing, Defendants sought to evade liability for these
infringements on the ground that the individual GSU officials and Regents sued in
their official capacities did not personally engage in the unauthorized copying and
distribution of Plaintiffs’ works.
The Court recognized that “the Board of Regents has general supervisory
authority over Georgia State’s operations and elects the President of Georgia
State.” Order at 7 (citing Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts,
Docket No. 187, at 10-11). The Court also found that “Georgia State/Defendants
have the right and ability to supervise the professors, instructors, and other
employees,” Order at 20, and it is undisputed that certain of the other named
defendants have supervisory authority over the staff of the GSU library and are
responsible for correcting noncompliance with federal copyright law. Defendants’
Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts, Docket No. 187, at 10-11. Given these
facts, Plaintiffs pointed to the doctrine of respondeat superior, as well as to a
related line of cases under Ex parte Young involving defendants sued in their
811163.1

5

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 10 of 32

official capacities, as authority for holding Defendants liable for the infringing acts
of GSU employees despite the fact that the named defendants were not actually
pressing the button on the scanner. See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in
Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Docket No. 185 (“Pl.
Opp. Mem.”), at 32-39.
In its September 30 ruling, the Court stated correctly that GSU would be
liable for copyright infringement under the doctrine of respondeat superior if two
showings are made with respect to the claimed infringements by GSU employees:
“(1) there must be an employer/employee relationship; and (2) the employee must
be acting within the scope of his/her employment.” Order at 17. The Court also
made a factual finding that “any employee who partook in any alleged
infringement was acting within the scope of his/her employment,” Order at 18.
Although this finding alone is legally sufficient to establish Defendants’ liability
for direct infringement, the Court nevertheless held that Defendants “cannot be
held directly liable for actions of the individual instructors through a respondeat
superior theory because respondeat superior applies in the copyright context as a
basis for finding vicarious liability, not direct liability.” Order at 18.
Because that determination was clearly erroneous, it warrants
reconsideration. See P.E.A.C.H., 916 F. Supp. at 1560. As the cases discussed

below and the record evidence regarding unauthorized copying and distribution at
GSU make clear, Defendants are strictly liable for any direct copyright
infringements committed by GSU employees within the scope of their employment
regardless of whether they personally participated in, contributed to, or benefited
from the infringement.
A.

GSU Is Liable for Infringing Conduct by Its Employees Within
the Scope of Their Employment Pursuant to the Doctrine of
Respondeat Superior

The acts of every employer sued for copyright infringement are, by
definition, acts of its employees undertaken on its behalf. Just as copyright law
provides that an employer is deemed the author of works created by employees
within the scope of their employment under the “work made for hire” doctrine of
copyright law, see 17 U.S.C. § 101 (definition of “work made for hire”), so too is
an employer legally responsible for acts of infringement committed by employees
within the scope of their employment. See 3 M. NIMMER & D. NIMMER, NIMMER
ON COPYRIGHT

§ 12.04[A][1] at 72-73 (2009) (“Nimmer) (“[Just as the [work for

hire] doctrine provides that the person who puts pen to paper, quill to canvas, or
finger to keyboard is not the ‘author’ of the work to the extent the employment
relationship exists, so the person who copies a work is by like measure not the sole
author of the infringement[.]”). Nimmer, § 12.04[A][1] at 72-73.
811163.1

7

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 12 of 32

Courts routinely hold employers responsible for direct copyright
infringement by their employees without recourse to secondary (i.e., vicarious or
contributory) infringement doctrines. See, e.g., Harper & Row Pub. Inc. v. Nation
Enters., 471 U.S. 539 (1985) (holding defendant Nation enterprises liable for direct
infringement by employee editor); Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of
Scientology Enters., Int’l, 533 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding defendant
Scientology organizations directly liable for copying of plaintiff’s book by their
employees); Princeton Univ. Press v. Michigan Document Servs., Inc., 99 F.3d
1381 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding defendant copy shop directly liable for copying by
employees).
While conceptually one could, as the Court has, characterize an
employer’s liability as “indirect” in such circumstances insofar as the employer
itself has not literally performed the infringing acts, it does not follow that the sole
basis for holding the employer liable is one or more of the secondary infringement
doctrines. Instead, as the foregoing cases illustrate, the law holds the employer
strictly liable for the direct infringements committed by its employees through the
doctrine of respondeat superior. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 2.04
(1999) (“An employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees
while acting within the scope of their employment.”); O.C.G.A. ¶ 51-2-2 (“Every
811163.1

person shall be liable for torts committed by his . . . servant by his command or in
the prosecution and within the scope of his business . . . .”); Shapiro, Bernstein &
Co. v. H.L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304, 307 (2d Cir. 1963) (“the normal agency rule
of respondeat superior applies to copyright infringement by a servant within the
scope of his employment”); Nimmer § 12.04[A][1] at 72 (“To the extent that the
infringer is the agent of another, the master can be held culpable for the
infringement.”).3
The distinction between indirect liability under respondeat superior and
secondary liability under the doctrines of vicarious and contributory infringement
is important. Copyright liability attaches to the employer once it has been
established that one or more of its employees has engaged in acts of direct
infringement. See, e.g., Sygma Photo News, Inc. v. High Soc’y Magazine, Inc., 596

3

Sparks v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc., 830 F.2d 1554 (11th Cir. 1987), cited by
the Court, see Order at 18, is not to the contrary. That case did not address
copyright infringement but, rather, involved a civil rights claim under Title VII and
the particular statutory definition of “employer” that applies to discrimination
claims. Although the court referred to respondeat superior liability as “indirect,” it
held that in situations where an employee accused of harassment is acting “within
the scope of employment,” and thus is acting as the agent of the employer, the
employer is “directly” and “strictly” liable for the employee’s harassment under
Title VII without the need for any additional showing. Id. at 1559. See also id. at
1558 (noting that “if Long was acting as an ‘agent’ of Pilot Freight when he
sexually harassed Sparks, Pilot Freight is directly liable to Sparks for Long’s
conduct”).

F. Supp. 28, 33 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), aff’d, 778 F.2d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that
the principle of respondeat superior imposes copyright infringement liability on
defendant publisher for infringing activities by its employees within the scope of
their employment). Under the Court’s interpretation of the doctrine of respondeat
superior, however, notwithstanding a demonstration by Plaintiffs that employees of
GSU have engaged in acts of direct infringement (which the record establishes, as
detailed in Section C below), Plaintiffs still would be faced with separately proving
the elements of contributory infringement as applied to GSU (accepting solely for
purposes of this motion the Court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ vicarious infringement
claims). Although Plaintiffs are confident that the current fact record supports
such a finding, they respectfully submit that it should not be their burden to make
that showing.
The test for vicarious infringement established in Shapiro, Bernstein and
adopted by the Eleventh Circuit in S. Bell Tel. and Tel. Co. v. Associated Tel.
Directory Pub., 756 F.2d 801 (11th Cir. 1985) (discussed by the Court at page 20
of the September 30 Order), was meant to extend traditional respondeat superior
liability to situations involving defendants who, while not themselves the
employers of the direct infringers, nonetheless share the hallmarks of an employer
– i.e., control and financial benefit. See, e.g., Gordon v. Nextel Comm., 345 F.3d
811163.1

922, 925-26 (6th Cir. 2003) (explaining that while “respondeat superior imposes
liability on an employer for copyright infringement by an employee,” the Shapiro
test applies “outside the employer-employee context”); Superhype Pub. Inc., v.
Vasiliou, 838 F. Supp. 1220, 1225 (S.D. Ohio 1993) (holding that “[t]hough an
employer can surely be liable for acts of infringement committed by an employee
under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the courts have created a much broader
umbrella of liability” for non-employers under the test for vicarious liability). That
vicarious liability test, however, was not meant to limit or replace traditional
employer liability for the direct infringements of employees under the theory of
respondeat superior, even if such liability is “indirect” in the sense that the
employee’s conduct is attributed to the employer.4 The case law clarifies that the

4

Indeed, the language quoted by the Court from Southern Bell related to the
potential personal liability of individuals who were held jointly and severally liable
with (i.e., in addition to) the defendant employers; their personal liability neither
superseded the employer’s liability nor created a new test to be applied to the
employers. Compare Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Starware Pub. Corp., 900 F. Supp.
433, 438 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (holding defendant employer liable for direct
infringement of plaintiff’s photographs), with Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Starware
Pub. Corp., 900 F. Supp. 438, 440-42 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (holding defendant officers
personally liable under Southern Bell tests of personal and vicarious liability); see
also, e.g., Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp., 983 F.2d 824, 833-34 (8th Cir. 1992)
(same); Nimmer § 12.04[A][1] at 72-73 (distinguishing liability of the employer
under respondeat superior from personal liability of “related” corporate officers).
Although Plaintiffs have named certain GSU officials as defendants here, Plaintiffs
do not seek to hold them personally liable; rather, as discussed in the next section,
811163.1

11

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 16 of 32

operative distinction is not whether the defendant is a direct or indirect infringer
but whether the defendant is liable as an employer (through the doctrine of
respondeat superior) or as a related party (through the doctrine of vicarious
infringement).
In short, because the Court found correctly that the GSU employees were
acting within the scope of their employment (in scanning, copying, displaying and
distributing Plaintiffs’ copyrighted material on ERes and uLearn), see Order at 18,
Defendants are responsible for infringements by those GSU employees under
respondeat superior to the extent the Court otherwise determines that the
challenged activities on the part of those employees constitute direct copyright
infringement. See generally Letterese, 533 F.3d 1287.
B.

Courts Hold “Official Capacity” Defendants Liable for
Unlawful Acts Committed Within the Scope of Their
Supervisory Authority

The above conclusion is not disturbed by the fact that the defendants in this
case are officials of a public institution rather than the employing entity itself.
Under Ex parte Young, the named defendants would be strictly liable in their
official capacities for GSU employees’ acts of direct infringement based on their

Defendants are named in their official capacities as representatives of their
employer, GSU, pursuant to Ex parte Young.

supervisory authority over the infringing conduct – no differently than would the
institution that employed those individuals in a private setting. Accordingly, the
Court can order prospective injunctive relief against the named defendants upon a
showing of direct infringements by GSU employees without having to address
theories of secondary infringement. See Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th
Cir. 1988); Pl. Opp. Mem. 35-36.
Under Ex parte Young, there is no need to show that state officials named as
official-capacity defendants personally violated federal law – either directly or
secondarily – to establish their liability for direct infringement by employees of the
state institution. See Pl. Opp. Mem. 35-39. For example, the plaintiffs in a classaction suit concerning inadequate funding for indigent legal services named as
defendants the governor of Georgia and the state judges responsible for providing
counsel to indigent defendants in Georgia courts. Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1013-14.
The Eleventh Circuit rejected the notion that an Ex parte Young defendant official
must have taken some action personally that violates the Constitution or federal
law, holding instead that “[p]ersonal action by defendants individually is not a
necessary condition of injunctive relief against state officers in their official
capacity.” Id.at 1015. Rather, “[a]ll that is required is that the official be
responsible for the challenged action.” Id. (emphasis added). See also Summit

Medical Associates, P.C. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326, 1341 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding
that plaintiffs properly named as defendants Alabama’s Governor and Attorney
General and the District Attorney because they were authorized to enforce the
criminal liability provisions of the challenged statute).
In sum, liability is attributed to the named Defendants based on the conduct
of others acting within Defendants’ supervisory authority and does not require any
additional showing – such as encouragement of the conduct or financial benefit
from it. The only relevant question is whether the named Defendants have the
authority to stop the direct violations about which Plaintiffs complain. See, e.g.,
Sandoval v. Hagan, 197 F.3d 484, 492, 500-01 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that the
Director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety could face a lawsuit alleging
unlawful promulgation of English-only drivers’ license exams), overruled on other
grounds by Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001); Bd. of Pub. Educ. for
Savannah v. State of Georgia., No. CV 490-101, 1990 WL 608208, at *4 (S.D. Ga.

Young exception applies only when the official is “personally or individually
involved in the unconstitutional action”) (citing Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1015-16).

of federal copyright law. See Salerno v. City Univ. of N.Y., 191 F. Supp. 2d 352,

Aleandri’s work was being infringed by employees of the university and of the
institute. In response, both the chancellor and the director moved to dismiss on the
ground that the plaintiffs had not alleged with specificity how the officers were
connected with the enforcement of the alleged violations of Aleandri’s copyright.
Id. The defendants also argued that Ex parte Young was unavailable because “the
state is the real party in interest in this matter.” Id. The court rejected both
arguments, explaining that Ex parte Young only requires a plaintiff to allege “some
connection between the official and the enforcement of the illegal act” and noting
that the defendants’ argument ignored the whole point of Ex parte Young, which is
to permit claims for prospective injunctive relief against state officials to ensure
state compliance with federal law. See id. at 357 (emphasis added).
The foregoing cases effectively carry the agency rationale of respondeat
superior into the context of state institutions, consistent with the Eleventh
Amendment. Injunctive relief against the official-capacity defendants enables the
plaintiff to obtain an effective remedy under Ex parte Young against unlawful

conduct by employees of the institution for whom the defendants are responsible.
As Plaintiffs explained in their opposition brief, Defendants have admitted that
they have the authority and/or duty to ensure, in one way or another, that GSU is in
or, as necessary, comes into, compliance with federal copyright law. See Pl. Opp.
Mem. at 38-39. And, as the Court found, “any employee who partook in any
alleged infringement was acting within the scope of his/her employment.” Order at
18. It follows, under the cases discussed above, that Defendants are liable for the
direct infringement under Ex parte Young even if they did not personally make or
distribute unauthorized copied of Plaintiffs’ works, without regard to whether their
liability is more properly characterized as “direct” or “indirect” and without any
need to invoke the doctrines of vicarious or contributory infringement.
C.

The Record Demonstrates Both Significant Direct Infringement
by GSU Employees and the Conceded Responsibility of the
Named Defendants

The September 30 Order reflects some uncertainty as to the nature of the
activities claimed by Plaintiffs to constitute direct infringement of their copyrights.
By way of clarification, the record establishes that ordinary usage of the ERes
system results in a variety of acts by GSU employees on the GSU computer system
that, unless excused by the fair use doctrine, plainly constitute acts of direct
copyright infringement – acts for which the Defendants are strictly liable and
811163.1

16

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 21 of 32

subject to injunctive relief under the doctrine of respondeat superior and Ex parte
Young, as described above. Specifically:
• When a member of the GSU library staff electronically scans copyrighted
materials in preparation for uploading them to the ERes system, an
unauthorized, permanent digital copy is created on a computer server
owned by GSU and operated by GSU information technology staff;5
• When a member of the GSU library staff uploads the digital copy to the
ERes system, an unauthorized digital copy is created on the ERes system
on a computer server owned by GSU and operated by GSU information
technology staff;6
• In order to send students copies of files through the ERes system,
unauthorized digital copies are first created and stored in the memory of a
computer server owned by GSU and operated by GSU information
technology staff and then distributed to each student in the class who
accesses the reading.7
It is uncontested that the GSU library personnel, information technology
specialists, and professors involved in posting materials to the ERes system are
employees of GSU – the first element necessary to establish Defendants’
respondeat superior liability. As to the second element, the Court has held that
“any employee who partook in any alleged infringement was acting within the

scope of his/her employment and therefore the second element of respondeat
superior is satisfied.” Order at 18. These findings, taken together, are enough to
hold Defendants liable for direct infringement without any additional showing of
financial benefit, material contribution, or the like.
The record also makes clear that Defendants have the requisite responsibility
for the direct infringements detailed above to be held liable for them and to be
subject to injunctive relief under Ex Parte Young. The Court found that “Georgia
State/Defendants have the right and ability to supervise the professors, instructors,
and other employees,” Order at 20, and it is undisputed that certain of the other
named defendants have supervisory authority over the staff of the GSU library and
are responsible for correcting noncompliance with federal copyright law.
Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts, Docket No. 187, at 10-11.
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court (1)
reconsider its holding, in the September 30 Order, that Defendants cannot be held
liable for direct infringement; (2) deny Defendants’ motion for summary judgment
as to Plaintiffs’ direct infringement claims; and (3) allow Plaintiffs to move
forward with those claims as well as with their contributory infringement claims.

THE SCOPE OF THE FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ORDERED BY
THE COURT SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO ENCOMPASS
UNAUTHORIZED CONDUCT IN 2009 AND 2010 BEYOND THAT
DETAILED IN PLAINTIFFS’ AUGUST RESPONSE
The Court has expressly directed Plaintiffs to make an evidentiary proffer as

to the “ongoing and continuous” nature of Defendants’ asserted infringements.
Yet the Order limits Plaintiffs’ ability to meet this burden by confining the
universe of evidence that Plaintiffs may use to make the required showing to
alleged infringements described in the August Submissions. As we describe, these
Submissions are incomplete as to the scope of potential infringement during the
three 2009 terms they encompass, and by definition do not include evidence of
ongoing infringement during the four academic terms that have ensued. That the
existence of such further evidence of ongoing and continuous infringement is not
merely speculative is revealed by the partial record as to the Spring 2010 semester,
which was discussed in the parties’ summary judgment motions. Those filings
highlighted significant infringing activity at GSU during this later semester.
Plaintiffs accordingly submit that the evidence of “ongoing and continuous”
infringing activity on which the September 30 Order asks the Plaintiffs to focus
should not be limited to the specific instances detailed in the August Submissions
(or, more generally, to the period between February 17, 2009 and September
2009). Plaintiffs instead respectfully request that the Court reconsider its Order
811163.1

and allow more complete discovery into, and the submission of evidence
concerning, instances of ongoing infringements at GSU during 2009 and 2010
beyond those identified subject to the limits of prior discovery.
A.

Plaintiffs’ Response to the August Orders Was Necessarily
Limited by Shortcomings in GSU’s Production as to the
Identified Academic Terms That Easily Can Be Rectified

Plaintiffs faced a number of difficulties in comprehensively responding to
the Court’s August Orders that limited their ability to depict the full scope of
infringement at GSU during the 2009 Maymester and Summer and Fall 2009
terms.8 For one, Plaintiffs were unable to include all of the material that was
posted to ERes during these academic terms because the ERes reports produced by
Defendants (and necessarily relied upon by Plaintiffs in their Response) were
incomplete. Pl. Supp. Filing ¶ 5(b). Specifically, the ERes reports for the 2009
Summer and Fall terms were generated and produced shortly after those terms
began. While the Summer 2009 term lasted through July 28, 2009, the ERes report
produced reflects usage and statistics only through July 1, 2009. Similarly,
although the Fall 2009 Semester presumably extended until December, the report
produced by Defendants covered material on the ERes system only through

8

These limitations were described in Plaintiffs’ Response. See Pl. Supp. Filing
¶ 5.

811163.1

20

Case 1:08-cv-01425-ODE Document 237

Filed 10/20/10 Page 25 of 32

September 15, 2009. Id. Thus, these reports do not include any additional course
material that professors may have posted to ERes later in those terms, nor do they
reflect data as to students who viewed such materials later in these terms.
Plaintiffs’ Response was further limited in that certain of the entries on the ERes
reports did not identify the specific material – the chapters or pages from certain
works – that was posted to ERes. See Pl. Supp. Filing ¶ 5(c).9
As indicated in the parties’ proposed scheduling orders submitted on
October 20, 2010, Defendants have indicated that they will produce complete ERes
reports for the 2009 Maymester and Summer and Fall 2009 terms as well as
“available” syllabi and fair use checklists for the courses and list of claimed
infringements set forth in response to the Court’s August Orders. Plaintiffs
respectfully request that the Court reconsider its Order to allow Plaintiffs to
supplement their August Response with any additional instances of claimed
infringements that may be revealed in these updated ERes reports and, to the extent
revealed by the syllabi, to add previously missing chapter and page details. To the
extent any additional instances of claimed infringements are identified, Plaintiffs
also request that Defendants be ordered to produce syllabi and fair use checklists

related to such works as well (as they have agreed to do for the works in the
August Response).
B.

Instances of Infringement Have Continued Beyond the
Semesters Referenced in the August Orders

Three academic terms (Spring, May and Summer 2010) have been
completed since the terms referenced in the August Submission. Currently, GSU
students are enrolled in the Fall 2010 term. A complete picture of ongoing
infringing activity warrants Plaintiffs’ being afforded discovery into ERes postings
of Plaintiffs’ works during these later terms.
There is good reason to believe that evidence of continuing infringement of
the type identified in the prior ERes reports and in the August Submissions would
be uncovered via discovery into ERes practices for these succeeding terms. By
way of example, the parties’ summary judgment briefs and Plaintiffs’ supplemental
declarations10 detailed instances of unlicensed uses of Plaintiffs’ works during the
Spring 2010 semester that reflect a pattern of activity remarkably similar to that
uncovered with respect to prior academic terms and depicted in the August

Submissions. Specifically, the Spring 2010 ERes report shows that about 1,000
unlicensed course materials already had been posted to ERes and accessed over
25,000 times just a few weeks into the Spring 2010 semester, including at least 60
works owned or controlled by Plaintiffs. Specific instances of unlicensed uses of
Plaintiffs’ works during this time period included, but were not limited to:
• 22 works owned or controlled by SAGE, all but one of which has been
distributed via ERes semester after semester at GSU;
• 23 works owned or controlled by Oxford, 14 of which have continued to be
distributed via ERes semester after semester at GSU; and
• 16 works owned or controlled by Cambridge, seven of which have continued
to be distributed via ERes semester after semester.11
Furthermore, many of the same professors identified in the August
Submissions as instructors of courses in which an allegedly infringed work was
assigned were reported on the Spring 2010 ERes report as continuing to post
multiple chapters from the same work, numerous excerpts for a single course, and
lengthy excerpts of 30, 40, 50, or even more pages from a single work.12 By way
of example, in Spring 2010:

• Professor Esposito posted 26 excerpts to ERes for her course EPRS8500,
including 30 pages from Handbook of Qualitative Research and 46 pages

• Professor Kaufmann posted numerous excerpts to ERes for EPRS8500,
including 74 pages from Handbook of Feminist Research, 41 pages from
Handbook of Narrative Inquiry, and 169 pages from Handbook of
Qualitative Research;
• Professor Lloyd posted numerous excerpts to ERes for RELS3305, including
44 pages from Critics of the Bible; 36 pages from The Cambridge
Companion to Karl Barth, and 45 pages from The Problem of Evil;
• Professor Orr posted numerous excerpts to ERes for MUS8830, including 49
pages from Ars Nova and the Renaissance, 29 pages from The Rise of
European Music, and 22 pages from The Motet in the Age of Du Fay;
• Professor Restivo posted at least 100 pages from Film Theory and Criticism
on ERes for COMM6020; and
• Professor Selwood posted numerous excerpts to ERes for HIST4540,
including 47 pages from Cheap Print & Popular Piety and 36 pages from
the Examinations of Anne Askew.13
To avoid the prospect of manifest injustice were Plaintiffs confined to the
limited record available to them to date in demonstrating a pattern of “ongoing and
continuous” infringements by GSU under the control and supervision of the
Defendants, Plaintiffs respectfully request that, in addition to allowing Plaintiffs to
fill out the record as to potentially infringing activity during the three academic
terms that were the subject of the August Submissions, the Court expand the

temporal scope of further proceedings to include discovery into, and a proffer of
evidence concerning, instances of claimed infringement that have occurred during
2010.
CONCLUSION
For reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs move the Court to reconsider
portions of its September 30 Order and (1) deny Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment as to Plaintiffs’ direct infringement claims and allow Plaintiffs to move
forward with those claims as well as with their contributory infringement claims;
(2) allow Plaintiffs to introduce evidence of infringements during the May,
Summer, and Fall 2009 terms beyond those indicated in the August Submissions
and order Defendants to produce syllabi and fair use checklists related to such
works; and (3) allow Plaintiffs to introduce evidence of infringements during the
Spring, May, Summer, and Fall 2010 terms, and order Defendants to produce ERes
reports from those terms and syllabi and fair use checklists related to claimed
infringing works from those terms to aid Plaintiffs in making such a showing.
