UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Case No. 17-CR-124

MARCUS HUTCHINS,
Defendant.
______________________________________________________________________________
DEFENDANT MARCUS HUTCHINS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO RECONSIDER
AND AMEND CONDITIONS OF RELEASE
______________________________________________________________________________
The Court should deny the government’s motion to reconsider and amend conditions of
release of defendant Marcus Hutchins. Mr. Hutchins is not a flight risk. The government’s
motion is premised on an incomplete recitation of the facts and the government’s failure to
account for its own statements to the Court. The facts establish that Mr. Hutchins should be, at a
minimum, placed on a curfew. Mr. Hutchins has been in full compliance with his pretrial release
conditions, which the government acknowledges, and Pretrial Services is in agreement that he
should be on curfew, which is part of its policy that defendants should be placed on the least
restrictive conditions that will still ensure their appearance.
18 U.S.C. § 3142 “does not seek ironclad guarantees, and the requirement that the
conditions of release 'reasonably assure' a defendant's appearance cannot be read to require
guarantees against flight.” United States v. Chen, 820 F.Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D.Cal.1992)
(citing United States v. Portes, 786 F.2d 758, 764 n. 7 (7th Cir. 1985).

1. Additional Facts Relevant to the Court’s Consideration
The government’s recitation of the facts in its “Background and Conditions of Bond” is
materially incomplete. The government fails to note the following pertinent facts that undercut
its own arguments and help demonstrate Mr. Hutchins is not a flight risk:
a. Following his arrest, Mr. Hutchins flew from Las Vegas to Milwaukee to
attend his August 14, 2017 arraignment with the approval of Pretrial Services
and consistent with his pretrial release conditions. He flew unaccompanied by
anyone from law enforcement or Pretrial Services. Mr. Hutchins arrived in
Milwaukee, established contact with the local Pretrial Service office, and
attended his arraignment.
b. At Mr. Hutchins’ arraignment and plea hearing, counsel for the government
asked that Mr. Hutchins continue on GPS monitoring, but noted that after
some period of compliance, if Pretrial Services determines GPS is no longer
necessary, the government would likely support that recommendation.
(Transcript at 10:2-6.) Counsel for the government also stated the government
was “fine” with no travel restrictions within the United States as long as
Pretrial Services had Mr. Hutchins’ passport and travel document. (Transcript
at 13:24-25.)
c. Following his arraignment, and with the approval of Pretrial Services and
consistent with his pretrial release conditions, Mr. Hutchins flew from
Milwaukee to Los Angeles. He was unaccompanied by anyone from law
enforcement or Pretrial Services, and he changed planes in Minneapolis. Mr.
Hutchins arrived in Los Angeles and established contact with the local Pretrial
Service office
2. Marcus Hutchins is Not a Flight Risk
Mr. Hutchins is not a flight risk, and at a minimum, he should be placed on curfew. As it
stands, while in Los Angeles, he is only permitted four hours of essential leave per week with
24-hour advance approval from Pretrial Services required. Thus, he is only permitted four hours
a week to perform basic life maintenance tasks such as shop for groceries and go to the bank.
The government’s motion is premised on facts known to the Court when it signed the
order permitting Mr. Hutchins to be on a curfew on August 24, 2017. Namely, that Mr. Hutchins
is a citizen of the United Kingdom with no ties to the United States. (See Mot. at 2.) That will

never change. But Mr. Hutchins’ ongoing full compliance with his pretrial release conditions
shows that those conditions should be loosened.
The government’s position is undercut by its own statements at Mr. Hutchins’
arraignment on August 14. At the arraignment, counsel for the government indicated that the
government would likely support the discontinuance of GPS monitoring after a period of
compliance if Pretrial Services recommended it. (Transcript at 10:2-6.) If the government is
willing to support GPS monitoring being removed if Pretrial Services deems it appropriate (a
much more significant loosening of conditions), it is inexplicable that the government now
opposes a simple curfew that Pretrial Services is recommending. This is particularly true
because Mr. Hutchins will still be on GPS monitoring, and his has demonstrated compliance with
his existing pretrial release conditions in significant ways (e.g., flying unaccompanied
throughout the United States).
Importantly, while the government’s motion expresses concern that Mr. Hutchins might
have a greater opportunity to leave the country if he is placed on curfew, the government does
not even mention the fact that Mr. Hutchins’ movements are currently monitored via GPS.
“Courts have recognized that electronic monitoring is an effective means of deterring flight."
United States v. Chavez-Rivas, 536 F. Supp.2d 962, 969 (E.D. Wis. 2008), citing United States
v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 815-16 (1st Cir.1990). GPS monitoring will still be in place when Mr.
Hutchins is on curfew. Furthermore, Mr. Hutchins does not have his passport. Pretrial Services
holds it. Any ability that Mr. Hutchins could have to flee the country is severely curtailed by
these two existing conditions.
The government also argues that the current conditions are “successful,” so there is no
need to modify them. (See Mot. at 3.) This argument should be rejected. The government is

3

essentially saying that because Mr. Hutchins has been compliant, nothing should change. Such a
rigid and unforgiving rule would mean a compliant defendant should never has his or her
conditions loosened, and is also unjust and inconsistent with the tenets of pretrial release. As the
Court is aware, pretrial release conditions are often modified and loosened after a period of
compliance.
The government further claims that Mr. Hutchins’ “conditions of bond are the only things
securing his presence in the U.S.” (See Mot. at 2.) Not true. The government overlooks the
important fact that Mr. Hutchins has pleaded not guilty and intends to defend himself vigorously
against the charges. Mr. Hutchins is a 23-year-old man who is already a worldwide hero as a
result of his vital role in stopping the WannaCry ransomware. He has an incredibly bright future
in front of him, and he does not intend to throw everything away by fleeing.
If the Court is going to place geographic restrictions on Mr. Hutchins while he is on
curfew, he should be restricted to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
Central District of California (which does not border Mexico). He should not be restricted to the
City of Los Angeles (which has jagged boundary lines that even native Angelenos often do not
know). For the Court’s convenience, a map of the City of Los Angeles and the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Central District of California are attached as Exhibit A.
As for the government’s proposal to limit the times of curfew, the defense understands
that 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. are the standard times. There is no reason to deviate in this instance.
Nor is there any cause to revoke Mr. Hutchins’ ability to travel throughout the United
States, as the government suggests in its motion (which is inconsistent with what it stated at the
arraignment). During his curfew times, Mr. Hutchins could travel throughout the jurisdiction of
the Central District of California, which is why that area is proposed. But he could not, for

example, board a bus to New York City at 6 a.m. and get back in time to meet his curfew. Mr.
Hutchins would be agreeable to a restriction that he cannot go any airports in the jurisdiction of
the Central District of California without prior approval from Pretrial Services.
***
For all the above reasons, the Court should deny the government’s motion to reconsider
and amend conditions of release of defendant Marcus Hutchins.
