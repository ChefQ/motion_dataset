CIVIL L.R. 6-3 TO ENLARGE TIME
TO RESPOND TO THE AMENDED
COMPLAINT PENDING THE
OUTCOME OF MOTION TO STAY

Case 3:07-cv-05568-JSW

SUMMARY OF OPPOSITION

1
2

Defendant Digital Networks North America, Inc.’s (“DNNA”) motion to

3

enlarge time for answer beyond the stipulated extension of time (“Motion”) should

4

be denied because:
1.

5

The Motion fails to identify or establish substantial harm or prejudice if

6

the Court does not extend the deadline to file its responsive pleading. Requiring

7

DNNA to file a responsive pleading in a timely manner does not cause substantial

8

harm or prejudice to the moving party.
2.

9

Failure to require DNNA to file a responsive pleading when due (and, in

10

advance of the motion for stay) prevents Plaintiff and the Court from having

11

information necessary to properly evaluate factors relevant to DNNA’s Motion for

12

Stay scheduled for hearing on January 18, 2008.
3.

13

DNNA’s request for stay is not a proper responsive pleading within the

14

requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. Rules 8 and 12 and thus should not delay the filing of

15

an answer.

16

FACTUAL SUMMARY

17
18

The Complaint for Patent Infringement in this case was filed on November 1,

19

2007, and personally served on DNNA’s registered agent on November 12, 2007

20

(see Docket #1 and 13). The responsive pleading deadline was thus December 3,

21

2007.

22

On or about November 26, 2007, Mr. Theodore Bell, counsel for DNNA,

23

called Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms. Melody Kramer, and requested an extension of time to

24

respond to the Complaint. Kramer Decl. ¶ 4. No particular reason for the request for

25

extension was made, however, Ms. Kramer agreed to an extension until January 4,

26

2008 and a Stipulation was filed with the Court. Kramer Decl. ¶ 5.

27
28

On November 27, 2007 an Amended Complaint was filed naming an
additional defendant (Docket #12).

The allegations against DNNA remained

1

essentially the same as those in the initial Complaint. DNNA was served with the

2

Amended Complaint via its counsel (Docket #23). Plaintiff’s counsel has conversed

3

with DNNA’s counsel and agreed that the response date for the Amended Complaint

4

would also be extended to January 4, 2008. Kramer Decl. ¶ 6.

5

On December 11, 2007, DNNA’s counsel called both of Plaintiff’s counsel

6

and attempted to obtain an agreement to further extend the response deadline to a

7

certain amount of time after the Court issues its ruling on DNNA’s motion for stay

8

(which had not been filed at the time of the telephone calls). Plaintiff, having

9

already granted a more than sufficient extension of time, did not agree to a further

10

extension. Kramer Decl. ¶ 7.

11

Ms. Kramer asked DNNA’s counsel for a specific reason as to why it wanted

12

to delay the filing of an answer for so long, and Mr. Bell responded that its

13

responsive pleading may not be an answer. Mr. Bell did not identify what alternate

14

pleading DNNA may intend to file. Mr. Bell also did not identify any prejudice,

15

harm, or other impediment to DNNA filing a responsive pleading in advance of a

16

ruling on DNNA’s motion for stay. Kramer Decl. ¶ 8.

17

ARGUMENT

18
19

21

DNNA’S MOTION FAILED TO IDENTIFY OR ESTABLISH
SUBSTANTIAL HARM OR PREJUDICE AS REQUIRED BY CIVIL
L.R. 6-3.

22

A motion to change time under Civil L.R. 6-3 is required to be supported by a

20

28

I.

declaration that:
(1) Sets forth with particularity, the reasons for the requested
enlargement or shortening of time;
(2) Describes the efforts the party has made to obtain a stipulation to
the time change;
(3) Identifies the substantial harm or prejudice that would occur if the
Court did not change the time . . .

(5) Discloses all previous time modifications in the case, whether by
stipulation or Court order;
(6) Describes the effect the requested time modification would have on
the schedule for the case.
Civil L.R. 6-3(a) (emphasis added).

5

DNNA’s motion is supported by the Declaration of Mr. Bell. It does not set

6

forth with sufficient particularity the reasons for the requested enlargement of time

7

as required by subparagraph (1) nor identify any substantial harm or prejudice if time

8

is not changed as required by subparagraph (3).

9

Mr. Bell uses boilerplate language about “serv[ing] the interests of justice”

10

and “avoid[ing] undue waste of DNNA’s time and resources” and speculates about

11

the outcome of the not-even–fully-briefed motion for stay. It does not explain how

12

the simple response to a 67-paragraph Amended Complaint on an already-stipulated

13

extension of time could cause substantial harm or prejudice to DNNA. To the extent

14

that DNNA infers that it intends to file some type of unidentified Rule 11 motion,

15

those deadlines are set forth in the Fed.R.Civ.P. and have no bearing on the statutory

16

responsive pleading date.

17

Mr. Bell likewise recites the verbiage that “substantial harm or prejudice will

18

occur,” but does not explain what any harm or prejudice would accrue to DNNA by

19

filing an answer or responsive pleading. A defendant is not substantially harmed by

20

filing a routine initial pleading, nor is it per se prejudiced by filing an answer before

21

a motion for stay is heard.

22

The effect of the requested time modification on the schedule of this case is

23

substantial. Plaintiff has already agreed to a month-long delay for DNNA’s answer

24

date. The motion for stay is scheduled for January 18, 2008, however, there can only

25

be speculation as to when the Court will be able to issue an order. Thus, DNNA is

26

requesting more than a tripling of the normal time for filing a responsive pleading

27

without providing a basis beyond not wanting to spend the minimal time or money

28

required to answer the allegations.

II.

A FAILURE TO FILE A RESPONSIVE PLEADING PRIOR TO
BRIEFING ON THE MOTION FOR STAY DENIES PLAINTIFF AND
THE COURT INFORMATION ESSENTIAL TO RULING ON THE
MOTION FOR STAY.
Courts are not required to stay judicial proceedings pending reexamination of

a patent. Nanometrics, Inc. v. Nova Measuring Instruments, Ltd., 2007 WL 627920,
at *1 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 26, 2007).
In determining whether to grant a motion for stay pending reexamination, the
court must weigh the competing interests presented by the specific set of facts. Jain
v. Trimas Corporation, 2005 WL 2397041, at *1 (E.D.Cal. Sept. 27, 2005); Gladish
v. Tyco Toys, 29 1993 WL 625509, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1718, 1719 (E.D.Cal. Sept. 16,
1993).
One of the factors to be considered is whether a stay will simplify the issues in
question and trial of the case. Predicate Logic, Inc. v. Distributive Software, Inc.,
Case No. 01cv1951, Doc. #126 at pp. 2 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2002) (Moskowitz, J.,
presiding), citing to Xerox Corp. v. 3Com Corp. 69 F.Supp.2d 404, 406-7 (W.D.N.Y.
Feb. 18, 1999).
Plaintiff cannot effectively argue, and the Court cannot properly evaluate this
factor, if the Defendant avoids identifying what matters are at issue between the
parties by failing to answer the Amended Complaint. Until an answer is filed, the
Court has no basis for assuming that there are ANY factual issues in dispute.
This is especially troublesome in light of the specific facts of this case. There
have been ongoing communications between the parties for more than two years,
during which Defendant DNNA has never denied infringement as accused by

Plaintiff. Kramer Decl. ¶ 9. The only issue disputed between the parties prior to the

2

filing of the complaint has been the appropriate licensing fee.

3

DNNA should be required to answer the Amended Complaint in advance of

4

hearing on the motion for stay and thus, this request for enlargement of time should

5

be denied.

III.

DNNA’s MOTION FOR STAY IS NOT A PROPER RESPONSIVE
PLEADING TO THE AMENDED COMPLAINT.
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 8 and 12 describe the various types of

pleadings to be filed by the parties upon commencement of a lawsuit. Rule 12, in
particular, outlines all the responsive pleadings that a party can file to a complaint,
including an answer and the various motions under Rule 12(b). A motion to stay
pending reexamination is not a motion that satisfies the requirement for answering or
otherwise responding to a complaint provided under Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 12.
DNNA wants to engage in motion practice before it has stated its position in
routine initial pleadings, but in a manner not authorized by Rule 12. Because the
motion for stay is not a motion delaying the obligation to respond to a complaint
under Rule 12, the responsive pleading deadline should not be modified.

CONCLUSION
Defendant DNNA’s motion to enlarge time for answer far beyond the
stipulated extension of time (“Motion”) should be denied because there is no
substantial harm or prejudice that would accrue to DNNA if the Court does not
extend the deadline to file its responsive pleading. Requiring DNNA to file a
responsive pleading in a timely manner does not cause substantial harm or prejudice
to the moving party.
Furthermore, allowing DNNA to further postpone the filing of a responsive
pleading when due (and, in advance of the motion for stay) denies Plaintiff and the

1

Court from evaluating factors relevant to the motion for stay, specifically, whether

2

the requested stay would simply issues for trial.

3

Finally, DNNA’s motion for stay is not a proper responsive pleading within

4

the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. Rules 8 and 12, and thus the delay in answering a

5

complaint allowed under Rule 12 should not be applied in this case.

6

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests the Court to deny Defendant DNNA’s

7

Motion Pursuant to Civil L.R. 6-3 to Enlarge Time to Respond to the Amended

8

Complaint, and not disturb the stipulated due date of January 4, 2008.
