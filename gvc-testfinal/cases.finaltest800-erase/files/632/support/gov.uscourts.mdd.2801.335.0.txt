Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 335 Filed 11/16/12 Page 3 of 6

The United States moves in limine to exclude the testimony of Mr. Colin M. Campbell –
Westvaco’s expert on Clean Air Act permitting and compliance matters – relating to two of his
five opinions:
1. That applicability of the preconstruction PSD permitting requirements should be
determined using the 1978 PSD rule, not the 1980 PSD rule, and that under the 1978 PSD
rule the DEP was not a “major modification” and, therefore, not subject to
preconstruction permitting requirements under that rule;1 and
2. That Westvaco could have applied for a permit under the 1978 PSD Rule and that if it
had the permit would not have required BACT because there was (according to Mr.
Campbell) no increase in the “allowable emissions” of SO2.2
As discussed in the accompanying memorandum, the two opinions are premised on legal
theories that the Court expressly rejected in its Memorandum and Order Re: Inapplicability of
BACT (Doc. No. 327) and constitute impermissible legal opinion testimony. The exclusion of
these irrelevant opinions will substantially shorten the amount of trial time devoted to Mr.
Campbell and his opinions. Accordingly, the United States respectfully requests that the Court
exclude testimony related to both opinions.

under “summary of opinions”), which is attached as Exhibit 1 to the United States’
Memorandum in Support.
