Defendant, Westvaco Corporation (“Westvaco”) hereby submits the following response
in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion In Limine to Exclude Certain Testimony by Colin M.
Campbell (Doc. No. 335).
I.

INTRODUCTION

At trial, Westvaco intends to offer the expert opinion of Colin M. Campbell, a nationally
renowned expert on the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) provisions of the Clean
Air Act and on permitting under those regulations. Part of the opinions Mr. Campbell will offer
concerns Westvaco’s conclusion in 1980 that the DEP did not trigger PSD review and the
obligation to implement Best Available Control Technology. Mr. Campbell will testify that,
even though the Court has disagreed with Westvaco’s interpretation of the applicability of PSD
to SO2 emissions from the power boiler, given the complex applicable legal regime and intricate
interplay between the 1978 PSD regulations and the 1980 regulations, it was reasonable for
Westvaco to conclude that the DEP was not subject to PSD review and BACT requirements
because the SO2 emissions from the power boilers were limited by its emissions cap.
The United States has filed a motion in limine to exclude certain portions of Mr.
Campbell’s testimony, arguing that Mr. Campbell’s testimony is not relevant in light of the
Court’s Memorandum and Order Re: Inapplicability of BACT (Doc. No. 327), and that those
portions of Mr. Campbell’s testimony amount to legal conclusions.1 To the contrary,
Mr. Campbell’s testimony does not run counter to this Court’s order; rather, it is relevant to
determining whether Westvaco believed in good faith that it was complying with the law, which
is a factor this Court may consider in determining whether to grant injunctive relief.

1 The Government has not sought to exclude all of Mr. Campbell’s opinions.

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 6 of 15

Furthermore, Mr. Campbell’s opinion is consistent with a long line of cases allowing experts to
explain to a trier of fact complex regulatory standards and requirements. His opinions
concerning these legal requirements will aid this Court in understanding the facts in evidence and
his ultimate opinion regarding the reasonableness of Westvaco’s conduct. As such, this Court
should deny the Government’s motion in limine.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Westvaco will present evidence at trial that it reasonably concluded that PSD permitting
did not apply to the DEP because SO2 emissions from the power boilers would remain below the
mill’s SO2 cap. Westvaco submitted its application to the State of Maryland for a permit to
construct the two new digesters on May 9, 1980. Robert Dickinson will testify that prior to
submitting the application he made a determination that the 1978 version of the PSD
regulations—which was applicable at the time—did not apply to the addition of the new
digesters because SO2 emissions were covered under the cap. After the 1980 version of the PSD
regulations were finalized, Mr. Dickinson reviewed them and determined that the analysis did
not change.
Mr. Campbell’s opinion will support the conclusion that this interpretation was
reasonable given the changes that the PSD regulations were undergoing at the time.
Mr. Campbell is a nationally renowned expert on the application of the PSD regulations to
industrial sources. Mr. Campbell frequently holds training courses on PSD that are widely
attended by industry lawyers, and state and federal regulators. Mr. Campbell has earned degrees
in mechanical engineering and economics, and has worked as a consultant on Clean Air Act
permitting and compliance matters since 1991. On numerous occasions, Mr. Campbell has
provided expert testimony in other cases on behalf of private permitees and state entities. See

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 7 of 15

Appendix A to Campbell Report (providing Mr. Campbell’s Curriculum Vitae and summarizing
his relevant experience). Mr. Campbell’s expertise and qualifications in this area are not
challenged by the Government.
Mr. Campbell reaches his conclusion on the basis of his decades of experience on the
application of the PSD regulations to industrial sources, as well as his analysis of the
applicability of the PSD regulations to the addition of the new digesters at the Luke Mill. As
explained in his expert report (attached as Exhibit 1 to the Government’s Memorandum),
Mr. Campbell considered whether a reasonable reading of the 1978 PSD regulations could lead
to the conclusion that the DEP was not a major modification under those rules, and also whether
the DEP was subject to the January, 1980 Stay of the 1978 PSD regulations. Campbell Report at
8-9. Given that conclusion, Mr. Campbell opines that a reasonable reading of 40 C.F.R. §
52.21(i)(9) and/or 40 C.F.R. § 52.21(i)(4)(v) of the 1980 regulations would be that the DEP is
exempted from the BACT requirements of the 1980 PSD Rules. Campbell Report at 9-12.
Consequently, given the interplay between the 1978 PSD regulations and the 1980 regulations,
Westvaco’s conclusion that the PSD and BACT requirements in the 1980 regulations was
reasonable.
III.
A.

ARGUMENT

Mr. Campbell’s discussion of the legal and regulatory framework applicable
in this case is not an inadmissible legal conclusion.
Federal Rule of Evidence 704 permits expert testimony on the ultimate issue in litigation.

See Fed. R. Evid. 704(a) (“An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate
issue.”). In addition, Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides that if “scientific, technical, or other
specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a
fact in issue, a witness who is qualified as an expert . . . may testify in the form of an opinion or

3

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 8 of 15

otherwise.” Fed. R. Evid. 702. As such, expert testimony on an ultimate issue may be excluded
pursuant to Rule 702 only if it does not assist the trier of fact. See Kopf v. Skyrm, 993 F.2d 374,
377-78 (4th Cir. 1993) (stating that, while “[a]n opinion is not objectionable simply because it
embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact, . . . such an opinion may be
excluded if it is not helpful to the trier of fact under Rule 702”) (internal quotation omitted).
To be sure, “testimony offering nothing more than a legal conclusion—i.e., testimony
that does little more than tell the jury what result to reach—is properly excluded under the
Rules.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 760 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing Woods v. Lecureux,
110 F.3d 1215, 1220 (6th Cir. 1997); see also Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 704.04[2][a] (2d
ed. 2001) (“The most common reason for excluding opinion testimony that gives legal
conclusion is lack of helpfulness. . . . The testimony supplies the jury with no information other
than the witness’s view of how the verdict should read.”). However, where an expert witness
provides his opinion as to the complex standards, regulations, and practices that govern a whole
industry, that witness’s testimony is admissible in order to provide the trier of fact with a greater
understanding of such a legal and regulatory framework and how that framework elucidates
certain facts at issue and might impact the ultimate issue in any particular case. In particular, Mr.
Campbell’s testimony in this case would assist the Court in understanding how a regulated entity
would have viewed these complex regulations at the time—over three decades ago. In an area of
similar complexity—e.g., statutes and regulations pertaining to taxation—courts consistently
have allowed expert testimony on the legal and regulatory tax framework and how that
framework interacts with the facts at issue in a given dispute.
In United States v. Stadtmauer, 620 F.3d 238 (3d Cir. 2010), for example, a panel of the
Third Circuit joined the majority of Circuits in allowing the admission of testimony by an IRS

4

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 9 of 15

agent describing the legal and regulatory tax framework and how those regulations interacted
with the facts in the case at bar, along with hypothetical situations targeted at elucidating the
facts at issue, id. at 269. As the court in Stadtmauer described, “In her direct testimony, [IRS
agent] Grant described how a partnership tax return is prepared, and explained where on the
return different categories of deductions were reported. Grant explained how she totaled the
expenses she determined were improperly deducted from each partnership return, and carried
them through to a summary chart for each partnership for each tax year, illustrating how the total
amount of improper deductions affected the net income reported to the IRS.” Id. The Third
Circuit found the admission of IRS Agent Grant’s testimony not to be an abuse of the district
court’s discretion, and held that “expert testimony by an IRS agent which expresses an opinion
as to the proper tax consequences of a transaction is admissible evidence.” Id. (quoting United
States v. Mikutowicz, 365 F.3d 65, 72 (1st Cir. 2004)); see also United States v. Bedford, 536
F.3d 1148, 1158 (10th Cir. 2008) (“[W]e agree that a properly qualified IRS agent may analyze a
transaction and give expert testimony about its tax consequences.” (quoting United States v.
Wade, 203 F. App’x 920, 930 (10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished))).
This principle extends to cases involving other industries that are subject to complex
statutory and regulatory schemes. A number of courts, including a panel of the Fourth Circuit,
have permitted experts to provide testimony concerning the legal and regulatory framework and
how that framework might impact the ultimate issue in any particular case. In United States v.
Offill, 666 F.3d 168 (4th Cir. 2011), a case cited by the Government in its motion in limine, the
Government offered an expert witnesses to testify about certain legal and statutory issues in a
prosecution involving a “pump and dump” stock scheme. The Government’s expert witnesses
testified as to certain complex and unfamiliar aspects of the securities industry, including a

5

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 10 of 15

discussion of specific statutes and regulations governing various securities transactions. The
witnesses also testified hypothetically as to certain situations that mirrored the factual allegations
in the case. The Court permitted the testimony, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that:
[t]he specialized nature of the legal regimes involved in this case and the complex
concepts involving securities registration, registration exemptions, and specific
regulatory practices make it a typical case for allowing expert testimony that
arguably states a legal conclusion in order to assist the jury. The jury in this case
needed to understand not only federal securities registration requirements but also
the operation of several obscure Texas Code provisions and their relationship to
the federal regime.
Id. at 175.
Other courts have agreed with the Fourth Circuit’s conclusion. A panel of the Ninth
Circuit in Hangarter v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 373 F.3d 998 (9th Cir. 2004),
allowed for the admission of an insurance industry expert’s testimony regarding “insurance
practices and standards” and “how insurance companies in general, and Defendants in particular,
adjust claims,” id. at 1016. The court in Hangarter rejected a challenge to the admission of such
testimony by that expert, Frank Caliri, after determining that his “testimony did not improperly
usurp the court's role by instructing the jury as to the applicable law.” Id. at 1017. As the Court
held, “[a]lthough Caliri’s testimony that Defendants departed from insurance industry norms
relied in part on his understanding of the requirements of state law, . . . ‘a witness may refer to
the law in expressing an opinion without that reference rendering the testimony inadmissible.
Indeed, a witness may properly be called upon to aid the jury in understanding the facts in
evidence even though reference to those facts is couched in legal terms.’” Id. (quoting Specht v.
Jensen, 853 F.2d 805, 809 (10th Cir. 1988)); accord Ford v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 72 F.3d 836,
841 (10th Cir. 1996).

6

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 11 of 15

Other district courts have reached similar conclusions in cases involving particularly
complex sets of legal and regulatory standards. See Schott v. I-Flow Corp., 696 F. Supp. 2d 898,
905 (S.D. Ohio 2010) (permitting expert to testify about “the complex regulatory scheme
applicable to medical devices [because] Plaintiffs do not offer her testimony as an opinion on the
ultimate issue of Ohio law, whether Defendant failed to adequately warn about its product, and
therefore Defendant’s objections are lacking in merit.”); In re Fosamax Prods. Liab. Litig., 645
F. Supp. 2d 164, 192 n.16 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (same); Applegate v. United States, 35 Fed. Cl. 406,
424-25 (Fed. Cl. 1996) (permitting a state official to testify as to state regulations in a regulatory
takings case after determining that “expert testimony reaching legal conclusions may be
admissible ‘where the testimony concerns state law or a technical provision peculiar to
the . . . industry’” (quoting Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 616, 623
(1992))).
Mr. Campbell’s testimony will fit squarely within the allowable parameters designated by
the Federal Rules and by these courts. Mr. Campbell is not providing an expert opinion as to the
proper legal standard that must be employed by the trier of fact in this case. To the contrary,
Mr. Campbell seeks to opine on the reasonableness of Westvaco to conclude at the time that the
DEP was not subject to PSD review and BACT. In order to achieve this, Mr. Campbell relies on
his more than two decades of experience to analyze how the 1978 and the 1980 PSD regulations
could reasonably have been applied to the DEP when Westvaco was determining PSD
applicability at the time. The fact that this analysis relies on the legal and regulatory standards
does not render his opinions inadmissible.

7

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 12 of 15

B.

Mr. Campbell’s testimony as to whether it was reasonable for Westvaco to
conclude that the DEP was not subject to PSD review is relevant and helpful
to the trier of fact.
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 401, evidence is relevant if “(a) it has any tendency

to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of
consequence in determining the action.” Fed. R. Evid 401 (emphasis added). In Daubert v.
Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) , the Supreme Court made clear that “the [trial]
court must ensure that the proposed expert testimony is relevant to the task at hand and will serve
to aid the trier of fact.” United States v. Smithers, 212 F.3d 306, 313 (6th Cir. 2000). A
defendant’s good faith effort to comply with the law is a factor a court may consider in deciding
whether the imposition of equitable relief is proper. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Tennessee Valley
Authority, 592 F. Supp. 2d 1357, 1368 (N.D. Ala. 2009) (refusing to impose injunctive relief in
part where the defendant had a good faith belief its emissions were in compliance with its
permit).
The Government’s argument that Mr. Campbell’s opinions are different than this Court’s
prior holding therefore misses the point. As explained in greater detail in Westvaco’s pretrial
brief, Mr. Campbell’s opinion is relevant to the reasonableness of Westvaco’s conclusion in
1980 that the DEP was not subject to PSD permitting and the obligation to implement BACT.
That evidence is relevant to this Court’s determination as to whether to grant the Government
injunctive relief in this case, and to Westvaco’s argument that the equities do not favor imposing
injunctive relief on Westvaco.2

2 As further support for the reasonableness of Westvaco’s conclusion and the company’s good

faith efforts to comply with the law, the evidence will show that Westvaco confirmed on at
[Footnote continued on next page]
8

Case 1:00-cv-02602-MJG Document 344 Filed 11/28/12 Page 13 of 15

C.

Mr. Campbell’s testimony will not expend an undue amount of additional
trial time.
Lastly, the Government contends that limiting Mr. Campbell’s testimony will have as a

desirable consequence the reduction of trial time required to be expended on Mr. Campbell’s
testimony. Of course, this cannot be reason alone to exclude Mr. Campbell’s testimony, and
neither Rule 702 nor Rule 704 include reduction of overall trial time as a factor for the court to
consider when determining whether to exclude testimony. Moreover, these aspects of
Mr. Campbell’s opinion are just part of the testimony he intends to offer in this case; they will
not substantially increase the time required for his testimony, and certainly will have little impact
on whether the trial will be completed in the time allotted by this Court.
IV.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny the Government’s motion in limine to
exclude these portions of Mr. Campbell’s opinions from trial.

[Footnote continued from previous page]

mill’s power boilers with the State of Maryland, and in each instance the State agreed.
