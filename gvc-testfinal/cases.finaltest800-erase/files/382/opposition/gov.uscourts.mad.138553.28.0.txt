Civil Action No. 11-cv-11448-RWZ

DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO T-MOBILE USA, INC.’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
FILE AN AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF AT&T MOBILITY
LLC’S MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Case 1:11-cv-11448-RWZ Document 28 Filed 09/29/11 Page 2 of 3

On September 15, 2011, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile”) filed a motion requesting
leave to file a Memorandum as an Amicus Curiae in Support of Plaintiff AT&T Mobility LLC’s
(“AT&T”) Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.
This matter concerns the enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate claims arising between
AT&T and Defendant Michael Princi. “[T]he threshold questions a district court must answer
before compelling or enjoining arbitration are these: (1) Did the parties seeking or resisting
arbitration enter into a valid arbitration agreement? (2) Does the dispute between those parties
fall within the language of the arbitration agreement?” John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Olick, 151 F.3d 132, 137 (3d Cir. 1998). “Once a court answers these questions in the
affirmative, the parties must take up all additional concerns with the arbitrator.” Elzinga &
Volkers, Inc. v. LSSC Corp., 838 F. Supp. 1306, 1309 (N.D. Ind. 1993). Here, AT&T does not
contest that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties. See AT&T Complaint ¶ 41
(“The arbitration agreement between ATTM and each defendant is a valid and binding contract
….”). Thus the sole issue is whether defendant’s Clayton Act claims are within the substantive
scope of the agreement to arbitrate.
T-Mobile is not a party to that agreement and does not have legal rights or obligations
that would be affected by arbitration under the agreement. T-Mobile’s proposed amicus brief
does not even attempt to address the sole issue before the Court. It would serve no purpose but
to clutter the record and to waste the Court’s and the parties’ time.
Defendant opposes T-Mobile’s motion for leave to file an Amicus Curiae memorandum
and respectfully requests that the Court exercise its discretion to deny leave for T-Mobile to file
the proposed amicus brief.
