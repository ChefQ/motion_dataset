Case 1:11-cv-11448-RWZ Document 20 Filed 09/15/11 Page 1 of 5

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

AT&T MOBILITY LLC,
Plaintiff,

Civil Action No. 1:11-CV-11448-RWZ

v.
MICHAEL PRINCI,
Defendant.
___________________________________/
T-MOBILE USA, INC.’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF
IN SUPPORT OF AT&T MOBILITY LLC’S
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND INCORPORATED
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile”) respectfully moves this Court for leave to file the
attached Amicus Curiae Brief in Support of AT&T Mobility LLC’s Motion for Preliminary
Injunction. T-Mobile’s Motion for Leave should be granted because:
1.

Defendant has initiated an arbitration against AT&T Mobility LLC (“AT&T”) in

which he seeks to block the multi-million dollar merger between AT&T and T-Mobile. TMobile’s parent stands to gain consideration amounting to $39 billion if T-Mobile’s merger with
AT&T closes. Moreover, the merger with AT&T will allow T-Mobile to obtain significant
benefits for its customers that would not be available absent the merger. In other words, TMobile has a direct and substantial interest in the consummation of its merger with AT&T. Yet
Defendant seeks to enjoin that merger in an arbitration where there will be no consideration
whatsoever of T-Mobile’s interests.
2.

In this litigation and through its Motion for Preliminary Injunction, AT&T seeks

to stop Defendant’s arbitration. T-Mobile has reasons separate and apart from AT&T’s reasons

1

Case 1:11-cv-11448-RWZ Document 20 Filed 09/15/11 Page 2 of 5

as to why Defendant’s arbitration should be enjoined. Specifically, T-Mobile seeks leave to
submit an Amicus Curiae Brief to discuss an issue not fully addressed by the parties – whether
the injunctive relief sought by Defendant in arbitration would impermissibly determine the rights
and duties of T-Mobile. It would. T-Mobile respectfully requests that this Court exercise its
discretion and grant T-Mobile’s Motion for Leave so that T-Mobile’s interests may be
considered. See U.S. v. Massachusetts Maritime Academy, 76 F.R.D. 595, 598 (D. Mass. 1977)
(“for the protection of [non-party’s] interests,” court permitted amicus curiae brief).
3.

AT&T’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction should be granted and Defendant’s

arbitration enjoined because Defendant asks the arbitrator to determine whether T-Mobile may
proceed with its merger with AT&T. Although Defendant seeks relief that will bind T-Mobile,
Defendant does not claim that he has any arbitration agreement with T-Mobile, and T-Mobile
has never agreed to submit the propriety of its merger with AT&T to arbitration. Arbitration is a
matter of consent, nor coercion. AT & T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am., 475
U.S. 643, 648 (1986). And T-Mobile has never agreed that an arbitrator can resolve this dispute.
4.

Although styled as an individual arbitration, Defendant seeks relief that would

resolve not only the dispute between Defendant and AT&T, but also the disputes that exist
involving many other parties (including the dispute now pending in federal court among AT&T,
T-Mobile, and the Department of Justice) regarding the propriety of this exact merger. A
proceeding with such a multiplicity of interested participants would bear much more semblance
to a class action than an individual, bilateral arbitration. T-Mobile has not agreed to participate
in a class arbitration, and the United States Supreme Court has held that class arbitration cannot
be compelled against unwilling participants. Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., 130
S. Ct. 1758, 1775 (2010). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear

2

Case 1:11-cv-11448-RWZ Document 20 Filed 09/15/11 Page 3 of 5

that arbitration is not an appropriate forum for resolving class disputes. Id.; see also AT&T
Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 1750-52 (2011).
5.

Even if this arbitration were allowed to proceed, and Defendant somehow

obtained the relief he seeks, that award would be set aside on a motion to vacate under 9
U.S.C.A. § 10(a) (4) on the grounds the arbitrator exceeded his authority by binding non-parties.
It is a waste of everyone’s resources to allow an arbitration to proceed that is so infirm that any
award would ultimately be vacated.
For these reasons, T-Mobile respectfully requests that this Court exercise its discretion
and grant T-Mobile’s Motion for Leave.
LOCAL RULE 7.1(A) (2) CERTIFICATION

Pursuant to local Rule 7.1(a) (2), I hereby certify that counsel for the movant has made
reasonable efforts to confer with all parties and non-parties who may be affected by the relief
sought in the motion in a good faith attempt to resolve or narrow the issue herein.
Counsel for AT&T and the Communications Workers of America do not oppose T-Mobile’s
filing of an amicus curiae brief in this matter; counsel for the Defendant objects to the filing of
an amicus curiae brief by T-Mobile.
Respectfully submitted this 15th day of September, 2011.
