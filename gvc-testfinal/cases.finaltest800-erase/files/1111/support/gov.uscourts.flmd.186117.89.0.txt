PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO CONDUCT MARCH 5 HEARING IN CAMERA
This Motion is an identical filing being made in cases 8:07-CV-00614-SDM-MAP,
and 8:07-CV-00616-SDM-MAP.
COMES NOW, Plaintiff, Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc., by and through its
undersigned counsel, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to hold the preliminary
pretrial conference set by this Court for March 5, 2008, in camera, and that the record be
kept confidential in order to protect valuable property rights, trade secrets, and other
confidential information from being made public.

It is anticipated that a significant portion of the preliminary pretrial conference will
involve motions that have been filed that relate to production or non-production of what
Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (“Odyssey”) considers to be privileged information, some
of which involves trade secrets and all of which involves confidential information.
Additionally, it is anticipated that there will be a discussion and dispute as to whether
documents and items that have been marked as confidential by Odyssey are in fact entitled to
confidential status. In order for the Court to determine whether the items are confidential,
they will have to be disclosed to the Court which, if done in open court, would destroy the
confidentiality of said items.

It is also anticipated that there will be some discussion

regarding the individual sites in information that has been provided to counsel for Spain in
confidence which, if discussed in open court, would again destroy the confidentiality of the
information.
The Middle District of Florida, in the case of United States v. McCorkle, 78
F.Supp.2d 1311, 1313 (M.D. Fla. 1999), has acknowledged that the parties to civil
proceedings may be entitled to in camera and sealed transcripts under certain circumstances.
In a civil case, the right of the public to have access to the proceedings is not a constitutional
right but a common law right. The court cited Wilson v. American Motors Corp., 759 F.2d
1568, 1570 (11th Cir. 1985) for the proposition that
“any denial of openness to civil proceedings must be narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling government interest. Wilson, 759 F.2d at 1571.”
The McCorkle court noted that, according to the case of United States v. Valenti, 987 F.2d
708 (11th Cir. 1993), the District Court may exercise its traditional authority and discretion to
deny access to sealed transcripts and in camera materials where the Court finds that the

2

denial of such access is necessary to preserve higher values. In the case of Del Monte Fresh
Produce Company v. Dole Food Company, 148 F.Supp.2d 1322 (S.D. Fla. 2001), the Court
was confronted with a situation where trade secrets had to be revealed by one of the parties
and there was a question as to what could be revealed by the other party. The Court held that
the determination of what would be open to disclosure had to be determined in an in camera
proceeding.

The reason is obvious since any discussion of the possibly confidential

information in open court would destroy the confidentiality.
There are cases that indicate that an affidavit is required in order to obtain an in
camera hearing based upon the confidentiality of information that will be disclosed.
However, it is respectfully submitted that this issue has been previously discussed by the
Court, and ample evidence has been presented as to why information that may be discussed
at the March 5 preliminary pretrial conference may be confidential.

Additionally, the

protective order by the Court by its very nature envisions the possible need for in camera
proceedings since the Court has set itself up as the ultimate arbiter of the confidentiality of
information presented to opposing counsel.
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that the March 5, 2008, preliminary
pretrial conference be held in camera and that the transcript not be disclosed to the public.
