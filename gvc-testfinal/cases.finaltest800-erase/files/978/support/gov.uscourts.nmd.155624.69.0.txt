Plaintiff - Petitioner,
vs No. 08-CV-00122 RLP/ACT

BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA FE, et al,

Defendants - Respondents.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO CERTIFY QUESTION TO THE
NEW MEXICO SUPREME COURT

Pursuant to NMSA 1978, 0x00A7 39-7-1 et. seq., Plaintiff moves this Court for order
requesting the New Mexico Supreme Court to answer a question of law that will materially
advance the litigation in this case for which there is no controlling appellate decision,
statute or constitutional provision. The New Mexico Supreme Court requires in a
Certification Order setting out certain criteria as set forth in NMSA 1978, 0x00A7 39-7-7.
Counsel has tracked those criteria in this motion.

Plaintiffs counsel has made a good faith effort to resolve this matter prior to filing
this matter. Defendants' counsel for the County, Abeyta, Salazar and Romero opposes
this motion.

Conventions:

"RP" means the record proper that was filed by opposing counsel and bates

numbered. It is the entire administrative record including all exhibits and discovery that

was not necessarily admitted into evidence.

Why this Court Should Certify the Question:
Case 2:08-cv-00122-JB-ACT Document 69 _ Filed 09/23/08 Page 2 of 6

New Mexico provides an avenue to courts in other jurisdictions and to our federal
courts to answer questions of state law. By certifying a question of significant public
importance avoids inconsistent results between the federal courts and the state courts on
state law questions and ensures a state law question is answered appropriately.

There are several examples where the federal courts and state courts have differed
on their respective interpretations of state law. Here are two: In Garcia v. Board of Educ.
of Socorro Consol. School Dist., 777 F.2d 1403 (10th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S.
814-, 107 S.Ct. 66, 93 L.Ed.2d 24 (1986), the Tenth Circuit ruled that the school board
was an arm of the state and therefore the Eleventh Amendment applied. The New Mexico
Supreme Court in Daddow v. Carlsbad Municipal School Dist., 120 N.M. 97, 898 P.2d
1235 (1995), held that the a school board is not an arm of the state. The Tenth Circuit
certified a question of law in State v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., 2004-NMSC-004,
135 N.M. 106, 85 P.3d 230. The result was that federal district court decision was
reversed.

Because the answer to this question to be certified involves state law, this Court
should not guess and instead allow the New Mexico Supreme Court to provide the
guidance and answer to avoid later inconsistent results, especially when the answer to this
question will affects tens of thousands of public employees through out New Mexico.
These public employees work for the state, county and municipality.

Question of Law to be Answered:

In the context of public employment and where there is no articulated standard of

review in the statute, regulation, policy, or ordinance, does the hearing officer review de

novo not only the evidence but also the penalty or sanction to be assessed?
Case 2:08-cv-00122-JB-ACT Document 69 _ Filed 09/23/08 Page 3 of 6

Facts:

 

On 9 September 2000, the County of Santa Fe promulgated Rules and Regulations
governing among other items, discipline of employees. Rule 8 governs the disciplinary
process, a copy of that entire Rule is attached as Exhibit 1. Rule 8.11 sets forth the
hearing procedures. The County bears the burden of proof by the preponderance of
evidence. Both sides have the ability to question witness under oath and both sides have
the ability to introduce into evidence documents. At the conclusion of the evidence, each
side is afforded an opportunity to make a closing statement. Rule 8 is silent on the
standard of review the hearing officer is follow in hearing an appeal from an ernployee.
Rule 8(C) does read in pertinent part: "The hearing officer may uphold, modify, or reverse
the decision of the County Manager, and may reinstate the employee and award back pay
and benefits."

The hearing officer sua sponte asked the question on whether she reviews
management's decision de novo or whether management's decision is supported by
substantial evidence, not arbitrary or capricious and not contrary to law. The parties
briefed the subject.

The hearing officer held that the appropriate standard of review was not de novo
but rather whether management's decision was supported by substantial evidence, was
not arbitrary and capricious and not contrary to law. Arbitrator's Decision at page 6-7 (RP
1142-43). The hearing officer affirmed the termination, but noted that if she were making
the decision de novo, should would not have terminated the worker but rather would have
demoted him to a non supervisory position and suspended him for a period of five weeks.

Arbitrator's Decision at page 17 fn. 2 (RP 1153).

Statement of Reformulation:

The New Mexico statute requires the acknowledgment that the Supreme Court of
New Mexico may reformulate the question in accordance with NMSA 1978, 0x00A7 39-7-7(A)(3).
Basis for Granting the Certification:

The answer to this question will affect tens of thousands of public employees who
are governed either by statutes, ordinances, collective bargaining agreements, or
regulations which have no articulated guidance on hearing officer's standard of review of
a management's disciplinary decision. For example, the City of Santa Fe personnel
ordinance contains no articulated standard of reviewing personnel decisions. City of
Santa Fe Rule 7.52(0)(2) states: "The hearing officer may uphold, modify, or reverse the
decision of the City Manager." (Exhibit 2). Likewise, the New Mexico State Personnel Act,
NMSA 1978, 0x00A7 10-9-1, ef seg. and its regulations, Rule 1.7.12 NMAC 2008, contain no
specific guidance. There does appear a line of substantial line of authority that the
default rule is where the scope of review is not stated, the hearing officer reviews the
employer's penalty de novo. National Academy of Arbitrators, THE COMMON LAW OF THE
WORKPLACE 0x00A7 10.23' (St. Antonie, ed. 2005); Elkouri and Elkouri, HOW ARBITRATION
WORKS 958-969 (6th ed. 2003); In re McInery Spring & Wire Co.., 21 LA 80, 82 (Smith,
arb. 1953). However, there is no direct New Mexico law on point. The closest case
counsel could locate is In re Termination Kibbe, 2000-NMSC-006 at J 10, 128 N.M. 629,
631 996 P.2d 419, 421, where the New Mexico Supreme Court held the appropriate
standard of review is de novo of employer's penalty by the hearing officer. However, the

decision in Kibbe is based on the statute which specifically provides for de novo review of

 

"This book is similar to a RESTATEMENT OF LAW in how it is presented and formatted.

the penalty by the hearing officer. Counsel was unable to locate any other New Mexico
authority.

The answer to this question will materially advance the conclusion of this case. This
is a major issue that would necessitate reinstatement with a demotion to a non supervisory
position with back pay and benefits. Arbitrator's Decision at page 17 fn. 2 (RP 1153). It
will also impact his civil rights claims in part. However, this Court would still need to
address the other issues raised in the motion to reverse the administrative decision.
