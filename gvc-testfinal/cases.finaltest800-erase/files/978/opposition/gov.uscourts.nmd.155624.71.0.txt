v.

CIV-08-122 LCS/ACT

BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA FE, in its

and official capacities, BERNADETTE SALAZAR,

Defendants.
DEFENDANTS BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS FOR THE COUNTY
OF SANTA FE, ROMAN ABEYTA, BERNADETTE SALAZAR AND
ANNABELLE ROMERO’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO
CERTIFY QUESTION TO THE NEW MEXICO SUPREME COURT
Defendants Board of County Commissioners for the County of Santa Fe, Roman
Abeyta, Bernadette Salazar and Annabelle Romero, by and through their attorneys, Brown &
German, Kevin M. Brown, hereby submit their Response to Plaintiff’s Motion to Certify
Question to the New Mexico Supreme Court.
New Mexico Rule of Appellate Procedure 12-607(A) gives the Supreme Court of
New Mexico the discretion to choose to answer unsettled questions of state law only if such
a question would be determinative of an issue in pending litigation and it is not resolved by
applicable state law. Plaintiff has filed this lawsuit seeking constitutional review of an
administrative decision. See First Amended Complaint [Doc. 58].

As this Court has

recognized, because Plaintiff is seeking this type of relief, New Mexico Rule of Civil
Procedure 1-075 applies to this matter. See Memorandum Order and Opinion [Doc. 53] at p.
9. Rule 1-075(Q) specifically states the scope of review this Court must utilize in considering
1

an agency’s decision. If a hearing officer’s decision supported by substantial evidence and in
accordance with law then the decision should be upheld. NMRA 1-075(Q)(2) and (4).
These provisions are in accordance with federal law regarding review of arbitration. See Hall
Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 128 S.Ct. 1396, 1403 (2008)(restating prior holding in
Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427 (1953), that “interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in
contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial
review for error in interpretation.”); First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 942
(1995)(Court will set aside arbitrator’s decision “only in very unusual circumstances.”). Thus
“[t]o warrant setting aside an arbitration award based on manifest disregard of the law, the
record must show the arbitrators knew the law and explicitly disregarded it.” Hollern v.
Wachovia Securities, Inc., 458 F.3d 1169, 1176 (10th Cir. 2006).
Plaintiff has misconstrued the Court’s role in this proceeding. Contrary to his
arguments, it is immaterial whether or not the hearing officer should have reviewed the
employer’s penalty de novo. Pursuant to Rule 1-075(Q) and the above cited federal law, the
Court must only determine whether the hearing officer’s decision not to apply that standard
of review in analyzing the penalty was supported by law. That question is clearly answered
in the affirmative.
In her Arbiter’s Decision, the hearing officer addressed Plaintiff’s argument that she
should conduct a de novo review on what she believes should be the appropriate discipline.
Arbiter’s Decision, Exhibit 2 to Plaintiff’s original Complaint [Doc. 1-3] at p.6. After being
briefed by the parties, she relied upon Douglas v. Veterans Administration, 5 MSPB 313 (1981),
Atlantic Richfield Co., 69 LA 484 (1977), and In re Pepsi Cola Bottlers of Akron, Inc. and Truck
Drivers Local 348, IBT, 1986 WL 38542, in holding that a reviewing authority such as herself
was “not free to simply substitute its judgment for that of the employing agency,” and that

the employer’s penalty must be upheld. Arbiter’s Decision at p. 6. These cases are not the
only law supporting such a position. See, e.g., West Chester Area School Board v. West Chester Area
Education Assoc., 1991 WL 320004 (“It is not the arbitrator’s job to substitute his judgment
concerning appropriate discipline for that of the School Board.”) By nature of his motion,
Plaintiff agrees that there are no controlling opinions issuing from New Mexico’s courts.
Plaintiff’s Motion fails to satisfy the first requirement of New Mexico Rule of
Appellate Procedure 12-607(A). Because the question which Plaintiff seeks to have certified
is not within the scope of this Court’s review (as determined by New Mexico Rule of Civil
Procedure 1-075(Q)), it is not determinative of an issue in pending litigation. Therefore it
does not fall within the scope of Rule 12-607(A) and is not subject to certification.
Moreover, the record before this court clearly reflects that the Arbitrator’s decision was
based upon applicable law and was not made in manifest disregard of any controlling
authority, and thus it should not be upset pursuant to Hall Street Assoc., First Options and
Hollern.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Certify Question to the New Mexico Supreme
Court should be denied.

Respectfully Submitted:
BROWN & GERMAN
