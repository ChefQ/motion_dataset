INTRODUCTION
Cheetah’s Motion should be denied because it fails to identify any error of law or fact, or

present newly discovered evidence, the only proper bases for reconsideration. Cheetah merely
reargues the issue and re-hashes previously rejected arguments regarding the Samsung ruling and
the patent figures raised in the briefing and Markman hearing.
Moreover, even if Cheetah could satisfy the high standard for reconsideration, which it
cannot, this Court’s construction of the terms “unmodulated optical signal,” “unmodulated,” and
the “modulate” terms 2 from U.S. Patent No. 7,339,714 (“the ‘714 Patent”) is correct and
supported by a thorough analysis of the full briefing and oral arguments of the parties as well as
the relevant intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. Accordingly, Cheetah’s Motion should be denied.

APPLICABLE LAW
Reconsideration under Rule 59(e) “is an extraordinary remedy that should be used

sparingly.” Templet v. Hydrochem Inc., 367 F.3d 473, 479 (5th Cir. 2004). “[S]uch a motion is
not the proper vehicle for rehashing evidence, legal theories, or arguments that could have been
offered or raised before the entry of judgment.” Id. (citing Simon v. United States, 891 F.2d
1154, 1159 (5th Cir. 1990)); see also Intel Corp. v. Commonwealth Sci. & Indus. Research
Organization, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131912, *20 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2009) (Davis, J.) (citing
Ross v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 745, 763 (5th Cir. 2005); LeClerc v. Webb, 419 F.3d 405, 412 n.13
(5th Cir. 2005) (“A motion for reconsideration may not be used to rehash rejected arguments or
introduce new arguments.”). Rather, reconsideration motions must “clearly establish either a
manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence.” Intel Corp., 2009 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 131912, *20 (citing Ross, 426 F.3d at 763 (quoting Pioneer Natural Res. USA, Inc.

The “modulate” terms are “to modulate,” “modulated,” and “modulation.”

A court abuses its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider only if it “bases its decision on an
erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id.

ARGUMENT
A.

There Is No Clear Error of Law in the Court’s Claim Constructions and
Cheetah Presents No Newly Discovered Evidence

Cheetah does not even attempt to satisfy the high standard for reconsideration. Cheetah
concedes that there is no “newly discovered” evidence, focusing exclusively on evidence that
was previously before the Court (i.e., the Samsung ruling and ‘714 patent specification), and then
rearguing its losing position. Intel Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131912, *20 (Motions for
reconsideration “cannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made
before the judgment issued.”). Cheetah also fails to point to any “clear error” in the Court’s
order, using the phrase only in a background legal section. Moreover, far from committing error,
as set forth below, the Court’s analysis was reasoned and correct. The Court’s opinion on the
relevant “modulate” terms spans six pages containing detailed analyses of both parties’ positions,
the Court’s prior ruling in Samsung, and intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. (See Court’s Claim
Construction Order, Dkt. 235, pp. 18-23).
B.

Even If Considered, Cheetah’s Arguments Fail on the Merits

Cheetah argues that the Court erred in its construction of the “modulate” terms because
Figure 15 of the ’714 patent allegedly describes an embodiment where the “optical signal”
carries information before it is “modulated,” and therefore “unmodulated” cannot mean a signal
that is not carrying information. (Cheetah’s Motion, Dkt. 237, p. 7 (emphasis in original)).
Cheetah also argues that the Court’s construction of these terms is inconsistent with its opinion
in the Samsung litigation. Cheetah is wrong on both counts.

Even if Figure 15 illustrates an optical signal that is carrying information, that does not
mean that an “unmodulated” signal is a signal that is already carrying information. It simply
means, accepting Cheetah’s premise, that Figure 15 does not show an unmodulated optical signal
(it shows a modulated signal). And not surprisingly, consistent with Figure 15, several claims of
the ’714 patent do not require an unmodulated optical signal. 3 Thus, Figure 15 is not helpful for
Cheetah. 4 Moreover, even if every claim did require an unmodulated optical signal, it is well
settled that ”not every claim must cover every disclosed embodiment.” (Court’s Claim
Construction Order, Dkt. 235, p. 11 (citing Baran v. Med. Device Techs., Inc., 616 F.3d 1309,
1316 (Fed. Cir. 2010))).
With respect to the Samsung litigation, Cheetah argues that the Court is being
inconsistent with its ruling there because the “the Court [in that case] held that Figure 15 is the
relevant embodiment for the asserted claims [18 and 19].” (Cheetah’s Motion, Dkt. 237, p. 2).
This court, however, already expressly considered the Samsung ruling and explained that its
decision was consistent with that ruling. (Court’s Claim Construction Order, Dkt. 235, p. 22). In
addition, this Court’s decision was consistent with the Samsung ruling because the Court’s
reference to Figure 15 was with respect to an entirely different claim term—“a first signal part
and a second signal part” — not to the “modulate” terms. See Samsung, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
119541, *11-12. The Court never said that Figure 15 was relevant to the “modulate” terms. Id.
at *8-11. Thus, the Samsung litigation is also not helpful for Cheetah.
3

For instance, independent claims 5 and 19 do not require an unmodulated optical signal.

4

Cheetah also refers to Figures 11g and 11h in the background section of its brief as alleged
components of Figure 15. (Cheetah’s Motion, Dkt. 237, pp. 3-5). These figures do not change
the analysis. In addition, Cheetah argues that these Figures do “not involve the ‘interference’
effects described by the Court.” (Id. at 4). This is incorrect. The specification expressly refers
to Figure 11g operating “in a diffraction mode” and “diffract[ing]” the signal. ‘714 Patent, col.
16, ll. 52-60.

Here, after analyzing all of the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence, the Court properly
recognized that an unmodulated optical signal does not carry any information, and that
modulation varies the signal to carry information. As the Court stated:
The ‘714 Patent describes a type of “modulation” (i.e., phase shift
modulation) that differs from more commonly used frequency
modulation (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM). In FM, an
information signal of 1s and 0s is used to “modulate” a carrier
wave to change its frequency between f1 and f2, according to the
pattern of 1s and 0s. Similarly, in AM, an information signal of 1s
and 0s is used to “modulate” a carrier wave to change its amplitude
between A1 and A2, according to the pattern of 1s and 0s. A
receiver (FM or AM) demodulates the received carrier wave to
extract the original pattern of 1s and 0s of the information signal.
In the modulation scheme of the ‘714 Patent, a carrier wave is not
phase-shifted in response to an information signal and its pattern of
1s and 0s. Instead, two lightwave signals are phase-shifted relative
to one another in response to an information signal having a
pattern of 1s and 0s such that, when they are combined
(interference), there are corresponding changes in the intensity of
an output lightwave signal. These changes in intensity reproduce
the information signal content pattern. Thus, the output lightwave
signal is “modulated” in its intensity according to the information
signal.
(Court’s Claim Construction Order, Dkt. 235, p. 21, n.7). Thus, the Court properly found that an
unmodulated signal does not carry information and the process of modulating the signal adds
information to it.
In contrast, Cheetah wants to interpret “unmodulated” as a signal that has not yet been
processed by the claimed invention (Cheetah’s Motion, Dkt. 237, p. 8), but this would render the
term unmodulated superfluous because any signal that has not yet been “processed” by the
invention would necessarily be unmodulated. This circular construction is legally incorrect and
has already been rejected by this Court. See, e.g., Bicon Inc. v. Straumann Co., 441 F.3d 945,
951 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (rejecting proposed construction because it rendered claim language

-5-

Case 6:11-cv-00390-LED Document 248

Filed 05/13/13 Page 6 of 8 PageID #: 4819

superfluous).
Cheetah finally argues that “Figures 1 and 7 [are] not relevant to the analysis of asserted
[c]laims 1 and 18” because claims 1 and 18 require “(i) an array of moving mirrors plus (ii) at
least one other moving mirror” and these figures, allegedly, do not depict “the claimed twomovable-mirror configuration.” (Cheetah’s Motion, Dkt. 237, p. 3). Cheetah misses the point
because those figures are relevant (as is the rest of the evidence relied upon by the Court) in
determining what the patent means by an “unmodulated” optical signal. (Court’s Claim
Construction Order, Dkt. 235, pp. 20-21 (describing how Figures 1 and 7 relate to the proper
construction of this term)). Moreover, the Federal Circuit has made clear that a patent figure
does not need to include every feature of a claim for it to be relevant to, and instructive for,
construing certain terms in a claim. See Altair Engineering, Inc. v. LEDdynamics, Inc., 2011 WL
836440, *3 (Fed. Cir. 2011). In short, the Court properly considered Figures 1 and 7 when
construing these terms.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants ask that the Court deny Cheetah’s Motion to

Reconsider in its entirety. See Intel Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131912, *20 (“A court abuses
its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider only if it ‘bases its decision on an erroneous view
of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.’”) (citing Ross, 426 F.3d at 763
(quoting Pioneer Natural Res. USA, Inc. v., 328 F.3d at 820)).
