UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY
PADUCAH DIVISION
CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:12CV-127-R
LWD PRP GROUP

PLAINTIFF

v.
ACF INDUSTRIES, LLC, et al.

DEFENDANTS

MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULE 12(B)(6)

Come the Defendants listed on Exhibit A, by counsel and pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and move this Court to dismiss all the claims brought by the Plaintiff,
LWD PRP Group.
There are no possible claims available to the Plaintiff under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). First, the Plaintiff
cannot pursue its alleged claim under CERCLA § 107(a). Such a claim is precluded by the
CERCLA § 113(f) claim that was otherwise available to the purported members of the Plaintiff
following their execution of a settlement agreement with the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“USEPA”). However, that Section 113(f) claim is now time-barred pursuant
to CERCLA § 113(g), which places a three-year statute of limitations on contribution claims
from the date of settlement. Plaintiff’s related claims under state law and for declaratory relief
are subject to dismissal on substantially the same grounds. Further, to the extent that the Plaintiff
alleges damages pursuant to as-yet-unconsummated negotiations with USEPA or the Kentucky
Department of Environmental Protection, those claims are either expressly not yet available to
Plaintiff or are otherwise not yet ripe for judicial review. Finally, because as the named Plaintiff
has not incurred (within the meaning of the statute) or otherwise paid any recoverable costs
under CERCLA, it cannot pursue the claims it asserts in the current litigation.
