PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY DISPOSITION
COMES NOW Plaintiff Robert Davis, by and through counsel, and for his Response in
Opposition to Defendant Union Pacific’s Motion for Summary Judgment and states as follows:
I.

CASE BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Robert Davis, was an employee of defendant on February 13, 2007. He was

employed as an Outside Locomotive Mover. As the title indicates, he moved locomotives around
defendant’s North Little Rock service track. On this day, while walking within defendant’s North
Little Rock yard between the lead track and the number three pit, Exhibit 1 he stepped on a large
rock. His ankle and knee twisted. As a result he suffered an injury to his lower extremity.
The walkway in this area is comprised of mostly small rocks but scattered throughout the
area are larger rocks that pose tripping hazards. The area in which he was walking does not support
any track or track bed. Some of defendant’s employees who are required to walk in this area had
complained about the presence of and danger of the larger rocks in this area before plaintiff was
injured. Plaintiff’s claims are analogous to a premises liability claim, i.e. defendant let exist a
known tripping hazard on its property when it had a duty to provide a safe walking area.

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 2 of 19

In this instance, the walkway just so happened to be comprised of ballast rock. The subject
of railroad ballast is complex.

The American Railroad Engineers and Maintenance-of-Way

Association, known as AREMA, the preeminent railroad engineering trade group, has studied this
subject and has put out numerous recommendations regarding ballast. Exhibit 2-1, 2-2 An entire
section in its Manual for Railway Engineering, Chapter 1 Roadway and Ballast: Ballast, is devoted
to some of the technical standards applicable to railroad ballast. Exhibit 2-3. Defendant has
adopted a set of ballast standards that echo the recommendations of AREMA. Exhbit 2-4 Every
branch of the military, all defense agencies and all Department of Defense field activities have also
adopted the AREMA ballast recommendations. Exhibit 2-5 A category of ballast, sometimes
identified as Class 2 or Size 5, refers to smaller type of ballast, measuring from 1” to 3/8”. Each one
of the previously identified entities, defendant included, have agreed that this smaller size of ballast
is appropriate for ballast in secondary main, branch and yard tracks to “facilitate easier walking
along the cars during loading and unloading operations” Id. At 6-28

LEGAL ANALYSIS
A.

Standard of Review - Summary Judgment

Summary judgment may be granted only if the moving party demonstrates (1) that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law. Rule 56 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The burden of
demonstrating the propriety of a summary judgment rests on the moving party. Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). A jury trial is favored in FELA cases and is considered to be
part of a railroad employee=s substantive remedy. Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., Inc., 319 U.S.
350, 354 (1943). The policy of providing an expansive remedy mandates that even marginal
claims should go to the jury. To deprive railroad workers of the benefit of a jury trial in close or

2

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 3 of 19

doubtful cases is to take away a goodly portion of the relief to which they are entitled. Blair v.
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 323 U.S. 600, 602 (1945).

The 7th Circuit noted, “The

lenient standard for avoiding summary judgment under the FELA merely mirrors the pro-plaintiff
slant of the substantive law.”

Harbin v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co., 921 F.2d 129, 131 (7th

Cir. 1990). A plaintiff's burden of proof in a FELA action is "significantly lighter” than in an
ordinary negligence case. Id. at 132 (emphasis added). Evidence scarcely more substantial than
pigeon bone broth is enough to place an FELA action before a jury. Id.
The FELA is a broad remedial statute which must be liberally construed to further its
humanitarian goal of holding railroads responsible for the physical dangers to which their
employees are exposed. Fonseca v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 246 F.3d 585 (6th Cir. 2001)
(citing Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 543 (1994)); Urie v. Thompson, 337
U.S. 163, 180 (1949). Summary judgment is strongly disfavored in FELA cases and close cases
should be allowed to proceed to trial. Bailey 319 U.S. at 354. The standard applied by federal
courts in determining whether the evidence is sufficient to send a case to the jury under the
FELA, is “significantly broader than the standard applied in common law negligence actions.”
Metcalfe v. Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company, 491 F.2d 892 (10th Cir.1973).
Citing Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S. 645, 66 S.Ct. 740, 90 L.Ed. 916 (1946), the Metcalfe court
held that “[o]nly when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion
reached does a reversible error appear.” Metcalfe at 895.
B.

Standard of Review – Statutory Construction

“Courts must presume the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a
statute what it says there.” See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 126 S.Ct.
2455, 2459, 165 L.Ed.2d 526(2006) (quoting Conn. National Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249,
253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391(1992)). “In statutory construction cases, ‘the first step
3

Filed 01/16/09 Page 4 of 19

is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard
to the particular distribute in the case.’” See Fullenkamp v. Veneman, 383 F.3d 478, 481 (6th Cir.
2004)(citation omitted). “The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by
reference to the language itself, the specific context in which the language is used, and the
broader context of the statute as a whole.” See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S.337, 341, 117
S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808(1997)(citation omitted); and McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136,
139, 111 S.Ct. 1737, 114 L.Ed.2d 194(1991)).
C.

Applicable Federal Statutes and Regulations: FELA v. FRSA preclusion
1.
The FELA was Enacted Prior to the FRSA and is Intended to be the
Exclusive Legislation Controlling Injured Railroad Employee’s Rights and
Remedies .

Congress enacted the FELA in 1908 with the purpose of providing railroad workers with
a remedy for personal injury suffered as a result of the negligence of employer railroads or
fellow workers. The statute states in pertinent part:
“Every common carrier by railroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person
suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier…for such injury . . . resulting
in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of
such carrier . . . .”
See 45 U.S.C. §51.
When Congress enacted the FELA in 1908, its clear and unambiguous focus was on
reducing railroad worker injuries and deaths resulting from accidents on interstate railroads. See
Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 181, 93 L.Ed. 1282, 69 S.Ct. 1018(1949). See also Wilkerson
v. McCarthy, 336 U.S. 53, 68, 93 L.Ed. 497, 69 S.Ct. 413(1949) (holding that the FELA “was
designed to put on the railroad industry some of the cost for the legs, eyes, arms, and lives which
it consumed in its operations.”). Under the FELA, a railroad is required to provide its employees
with a reasonably safe place to work. See Gadsden v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 140 F.3d

4

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 5 of 19

207 (2nd Cir. 1998) and Sinclair v. Long Island R.R., 985 F.2d 74 (2nd Cir. 1993). The FELA is
the exclusive remedy for railroad employees to recover damages for injuries resulting from the
negligence of his or her railroad employer. Lane v. R.A. Sims, Jr., Inc., 241 F.3d 439 (5th Cir.
2001)
2.
The FRSA was Enacted after the FELA and Does not Preclude FELA
Causes of Action.
Approximately 62 years after Congress enacted the FELA, Congress enacted the Federal
Rail Safety Act (hereafter “FRSA”) “to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and
reduce railroad-related accidents and incidents.” 40 U.S.C. §20101. The stated purpose of the
FRSA is therefore completely compatible with the purpose of the FELA, to promote safety and hold
railroads responsible for their negligence. Congress also gave the Secretary of Transportation the
authority to prescribe regulations and issue orders related to railroad safety “supplementing laws
and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970.” 49 U.S.C. §20103(a) (emphasis added). Thus by its
plain and unambiguous language, through its enactment of the FRSA, Congress intended to
supplement existing laws governing railroad safety like the FELA, not supersede, invalidate,
vitiate, preempt or preclude them.
To facilitate national uniformity of the laws that governed railroads, Congress also
enacted a preemption clause as part of the FRSA, 49 U.S.C. §20106. The confusion over the
meaning of §20106 prompted congress to amend it on August 3, 2007. “The amendment ‘reflected
Congress’s disagreement with the manner in which the courts, including our own in Lundeen I, had
interpreted §20106 to preempt state law causes of action whenever a federal regulation covered the
same subject matter as the allegations of negligence of a state court lawsuit.’ ” Bates v. Missouri &
Northern Arksansas Railroad Company, Inc., 548 F.3d 634, 637 (8th Cir. 2008) citing Lundeen v.
Canadian Pacific Railway Co., 532 F.3d 682, 688 (8th Cir. 2008).

5

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 6 of 19

Any case decided before August 3, 2007 where a court found that a claim was preempted or
precluded based on a court’s interpretation of §20106 is suspect.

Congress amended §20106 in

August of 2007 to read in pertinent part:
“(b) Clarification regarding State law causes of action.—
(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt an action under State law
seeking damages for personal injury, death, or property damage alleging that a
party-(A) has failed to comply with the Federal standard of care established by a
regulation or order issued by the Secretary of Transportation (with respect
to railroad safety matters), or the Secretary of Homeland Security (with
respect to railroad security matters), covering the subject matter as
provided in subsection (a) of this section;
(B) has failed to comply with its own plan, rule, or standard that it created
pursuant to a regulation or order issued by either of the Secretaries; or
(C) has failed to comply with a State law, regulation, or order that is not
incompatible with subsection (a)(2).”
This is clear indication that Congress did not intend for the FRSA to preempt state
legislation or causes of action. Furthermore, there is noting in §20106 that indicating that
the FRSA precludes legislation or causes of actions based upon federal law. If Congress
had intended any form of preclusion, it could have included such language in the August
3, 2007 amendment.
FRSA §20106(b)(1)(B) allows a state cause of action based upon a railroad’s
failure to adhere to its own standards enacted “pursuant to a regulation or order issued by
either of the Secretaries.” Defendant has enacted its own ballast standard as noted above.
As noted below, “ballast” is, in part, regulated by the FRSA. Defendant, therefore, has a
standard pursuant to a regulation of the Secretary of Transportation. As a result, by the
plain language of §20106, plaintiff is not preempted or precluded from pursuing a claim
that defendant did not adhere to its own ballast standards.

6

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 7 of 19

Plaintiff is alleging that defendant allowed a tripping hazard to exist in its
walkways and it therefore did not provide a safe work environment. A different way of
stating that same idea would be to say defendant placed or allowed Grade 1 ballast in an
area where Grade 2 ballast is mandated by and in violation of Union Pacific’s ballast
gradiation standards, and it therefore did not provide a safe work environment. The fist
way of stating the allegation is a simple claim of negligence that does not touch or
concern any federal regulation. The second way of stating the allegation frames the same
issue by recognizing that defendant violated its own ballast standards. Neither of these
two ways of stating the same claim are preempted or precluded by §20106.

3.
49 C.F.R §213.103 Does not Subsume Regulation of Ballast in Walkways
or Other Locations
The Secretary of Transportation delegated its authority to prescribe regulations and issue
orders related to railroad safety which supplement existing laws to the Federal Railroad
Administration (“FRA”). See 49 C.F.R. §1.49(c). Pursuant to this delegated authority, the FRA has
issued the following regulation regarding ballast contained in Part 213, Subpart D, titled Track
Structure:
§213.103

Ballast; general

Unless it is otherwise structurally supported, all track shall be supported by
materials which will –
(a)
Transmit and distribute the load of the track and railroad rolling
equipment to the subgrade;
(b)
Restrain the track laterally, longitudinally, and vertically under
dynamic loads imposed by railroad rolling equipment and thermal stress exerted by
the rails;
(c)
Provide adequate drainage for the track; and
(d)
Maintain proper track crosslevel, surface, and alinement.
49 C.F.R. §213.103.

7

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 8 of 19

49 C.F.R. §213.103 has its own preemption clause, which also unambiguously states that
only “State laws, regulations, or orders” are preempted by the regulations contained in Part 213 of
49 C.F.R. 49 C.F.R. §213.2 titled, Preemptive Effect, states as follows:
Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, issuance of these regulations preempts any State law,
regulation, or order covering the same subject matter, except an additional or
stringent law, regulation, or order that is necessary to eliminate or reduce an
essentially local safety hazard; is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of
the United States Government; and that does not impose an unreasonable burden on
interstate commerce.
By its own plain and unambiguous language, the FRA never intended to issue a regulation
that covered every possible area of railroad safety. The FRA makes it clear that the regulations
contained in 49 C.F.R. §213, particularly Subpart D concerning Track Structure, including 49
C.F.R. §213.103, prescribe only the “minimum” requirements for, among other things, ballast. See
49 C.F.R. §213.101(emphasis added)
A simple reading of 49 C.F.R. §213.103 evidences that the regulation does not address,
cover or substantially subsume the issue of ballast material that may be used to comprise employee
walkways in train yards. By its plain and unambiguous language, 49 C.F.R. §213.103 covers and
relates to nothing more than ballast used to support railroad track. It is a regulation that is designed
solely to ensure the integrity and alignment of railroad track, and not to protect or prevent railroad
workers from being injured on walkways contained in the train yard. To hold otherwise, would be
to ignore the plain language of the regulation itself, and indeed the entire plain and unambiguous
language of the provisions of Chapter 213 in total. Chapter 213 covers track safety, and track safety
alone – not employee walkways or walkway conditions. In this case, Plaintiff Robert Davis does
not claim that he was injured while walking on ballast that was supporting track, or that he was
injured as a result of inadequately supported track. As such §213.103 is inapplicable to this case.

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 9 of 19

If the employee walkway at issue were made out of asphalt or concrete as is often the case at
service tracks and other locations, there wouldn’t be a single word of §213.103 that would be
relevant to the present discussion. Defendant attempts to argue that one word that is the title to
§213.103 indicates that section subsumes all use of ballast anywhere and for any reason whatsoever.
That argument is not only counter to all logic and reason, it is counter to defendant’s own standards.
4.

Plaintiff’s Claim is not Based Solely Upon Defendant’s Failure to Use

Appropriately Sized Ballast.
Plaintiff’s allegations of negligence against Defendant are found in ¶7 of his Complaint.
Plaintiff has specifically alleged, among other things, that defendant was negligent for failing to
provide a safe place to work, for failing to provide reasonably safe conditions for work, failing to
provide reasonably safe walking areas and failing to inspect and maintain its ballast. As noted
previously, plaintiff’s main contention is that defendant allowed a tripping hazard to exist in its
walkways. The fact that these large rocks existed, had been complained about in the past, and yet
were not removed, is indicative that defendant did not properly maintain or inspect its walkways.
There is nothing about those allegations that have to do with the size of ballast defendant chose to
place in that area. Those allegations state that defendant chose the composition of its walkways,
then negligently allowed unsafe conditions to exist in those walkways.
If the offending tripping hazard had been a brake shoe, the end of a railroad tie, a piece of
scrap metal or any other item, there would be no discussion regarding preclusion. As it stands the
hazard was a piece of rock that was larger than and inconsistent with the surrounding smaller sized
rock. The issue isn’t about the size of the ballast defendant used in the area as much as it is that
defendant allowed larger rocks in that area inconsistent with the sized ballast defendant chose to
place in its walkways.

Defendant Bears the Burden of Proving That Plaintiff’s FELA Claims are
Precluded by The FRSA and Specifically 49 C.F.R. §213.103

Because preclusion, a doctrine analogous to federal preemption, is an affirmative defense, 1
defendant bears the burden of proving that plaintiff ‘s FELA claims are precluded by the FRSA and
specifically the provisions of 49 C.F.R. §213.103. See Fifth Third Bank v. CSX Corp., 415 F.3d

Defendant Has Failed to Prove That The FRSA and Specifically 49 C.F.R.
§213.103 Substantially Subsumes Plaintiff’s FELA Claims

In order to prove that plaintiff’s FELA claims are precluded by the FRSA, specifically 49
C.F.R. §213.103, as defendant contends, defendant must prove that the substance of 49 C.F.R.
§213.103 “substantially subsumes” plaintiff’s FELA claims. See Elston v. Union Pac. RR Co., 74
P.3d 478, 485-89 (Col.App. 2003)(citing CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664, 113
S.Ct. 1732, 1738, 123 L.Ed.2d 387 (1993)). A copy of Elston is attached as Exhibit 3, and is hereby
incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein
Although the motion at hand does not involve preemption of a state law claim, the same
analysis holds true:
Thus, the first issue is whether the FRSA covers the subject matter of railroad
walkways. To prevail on a claim that the FRSA has preemptive effect, the FRSA
regulations must not merely touch upon or relate to the subject matter, but must
substantially subsume it.
Id. (emphasis added).

Defendant CSX has specifically pled federal preemption as an affirmative defense in this case. See Defendant’s
Answer and Affirmative Defenses, p. 2, ¶8.

Defendant’s argument is based almost completely on cases citing preemption of
state law claims based upon §20106 or extrapolations of that theory to preclude federal
claims, i.e. Dickerson v. Union Pacific, 428 F.Supp.2d 909 (E.D. Ark. 2006). Clearly
this body of case law is no longer determinative in light of the amendment of §20106.
Furthermore, the majority of those cases deal with speed limits or other areas of
regulation, not the regulation of ballast.
Defendant relies almost exclusively on cases from the Eastern District of Michigan to
support its contention that ballast regulation is subsumed by the FRSA. Defendant failed to advise
this Court that of the reported cases that have decided whether the FRSA (and in some cases 49
C.F.R. §213.103) precludes a railroad worker’s FELA claims, the majority of those Courts have
ruled that the railroad worker’s claims are not precluded by the FRSA. See, e.g., Elston v. Union
Pac. RR Co., 74 P.3d 478, 485-89 (Co.App. 2003)(reversing trial court’s grant of summary
judgment holding that the FRSA and 49 C.F.R. 213.103 precluded plaintiff’s FELA ballast claims);

The fact is that of the 5 appellate courts that have weighed in on this issue, 4 of the 5 courts
have ruled against the defendant railroads, holding that the FRSA, and specifically 49 C.F.R.
§213.103, does not preclude railroad worker FELA ballast claims.2 The

reasons

why

the

overwhelming majority of appellate courts have rejected what defendant is now trying to sell to this
Court are as plain and unambiguous as the language of 49 C.F.R. §213.103 itself.
The plain language of the regulation evidences that it does not “substantially subsume”
plaintiff’s FELA claims. Plaintiff’s FELA claims concern and arise from defendant’s failure to
provide a reasonably safe workplace by failing to provide safe walkways on which to perform his
work duties. Plaintiff’s allegations are concerned with walkways and have nothing whatsoever to
do with tracks or the provisions of §213.03. Other than the fact that ballast rock is used, in this
instance, for both support of the track and for walkways, his claims have nothing in common with
any language in §213.03. If the walkways had been paved as opposed to made of ballast not a
single word in §213.03 would be applicable to plaintiff’s claims and defendant would have nothing

to argue regarding preclusion. Instead, merely because of the composition of the walkways in
defendant’s yards are similar to its track bed, defendant is claiming plaintiff’s claims are precluded.
This is arguing form over substance.
Nowhere in §213.103, in all of Part 213 of Chapter 49, or in the FRSA regulations as a
whole is there mention of employee walkways or yard walkway conditions. The above regulation
does not touch, cover or substantially subsume the issue or subject matter of employee walkways or
yard walkway conditions.
Evan a surface glance at the FRSA regulation relied on by CSX persuades us that it does
not touch, let alone pervasively cover, the railroad yard conditions that allegedly fell short of
the safe and healthy workplace environment that CSX was obligated to provide for its
employees. The regulation is concerned with the track and its immediately adjoining area
and not with railroad yards. The obvious concern, moreover, is with the safety of the train,
the prevention of derailments, and not the quality of the work place provided for employees.
Hendrix, 196 S.W.3d at 196-97 (quoting CSX Transp., Inc. v. Miller, 858 A.2d 1025, 1050
(Md.App. 2004)) at Exhibit 4.
As the Colorado Court of Appeals noted in Elston when discussing 49 C.F.R. 213.103:
These standards are directed at promoting a safe roadbed for trains, but offer no
indication whether a railroad has a duty to provide safe walkways for employees
alongside its tracks.
***
Because walkways are not covered by the FRSA, whether defendant complied with these
regulations is immaterial in determining whether a reasonable person in defendant’s
situation would have provided walkways alongside its tracks.
Elston, 74 P.3d at 488 (citations omitted) at Exhibit 3.
In Miller v. CSX Transp., Inc., the Maryland Court of Appeals found:
The federal District Court pointed out, as we have ourselves observed, that the FRSA
regulations were concerned with a “safe roadbed for trains and not a safe walkway for
railroad employees.” The Court flatly rejected the preclusion argument.
Every circuit that has considered the issue of walkways has concluded that the FRSA is
silent on the question of walkways. These regulations are directed toward creating a safe

roadbed for trains, not a safe walkway for railroad employees who must inspect the trains.
In view of the fact that this railroad requires its employees to perform numerous trackside inspections of its trains for various reasons, this Court declines to find anything in
the regulations cited by the Defendant that precludes this Plaintiff from asserting that the
railroad was negligent for failing to provide a safe place to walk.
Miller, 858 A.2d at 1051 (referring to and citing Grimes v. Norfolk So. Ry. Co., 116 F.Supp.2d 995,
1002-03 (N.D. Ind., Sept. 18, 2000)) at Exhibit 4.
Neither 49 C.F.R. §213.103 nor any other FRSA regulation touches, covers or substantially
subsumes the issue of what constitutes proper ballast materials, proper ballast size, proper grading,
proper incline(s), or proper maintenance/inspection for employee walkways. From a pure statutory
construction standpoint, 49 C.F.R. §213.103 does not cover or substantially subsume plaintiff’s
FELA claims. In order to grant the drastic relief that defendant is asking for, this Court would be
required to read into 49 C.F.R. §213.103 and the FRSA regulations that which simply is not there.
If §213.103 substantially subsumed regulation and standards for railroad ballast why would
AREMA, defendant and the government itself feel the need to enact additional standards for railway
ballast? Why would defendant acknowledge in its Ballast Gradiation Table that there are “Industry
Standards” for ballast size? See Exhibit 2- 4 Defendant itself acknowledges that the railroad
industry as a whole saw the need for further clarification of what type of ballast should be used for
what type of trackage. Every entity involved in railroad construction, maintenance, or operation has
adopted additional ballast standards. Despite the fact that defendant knew of that fact, it did not feel
the need to inform this Court of that fact.

The Cases Relied Upon by Defendant are Distinguishable or Were
Founded Upon Rejected Preemption Law

As noted above, Defendant relies upon federal district court cases from the Eastern
District of Michigan and one from Georgia – Ferra v. Canadian National/Illinois Central RR
(opinion dated May 4, 2007); Nickels v. Grand Trunk Western RR (opinion dated May 30,

14

Case 4:07-cv-00521-BSM Document 45

Filed 01/16/09 Page 15 of 19

2007); and Crabbe v. Consol. Rail Corp. (opinion dated November 1, 2007), and the Georgia
Court of Appeals case of Norris v. Central of Georgia Railroad Co.
An analysis of the Michigan federal district court cases uncovers that these cases are
either factually distinguishable from the case before this Court, or more importantly
improvidently relied exclusively on the Norris case as a basis for concluding that 49 C.F.R.
§213.103 substantially subsumes a railroad worker’s FELA claims based on improperly sized
ballast.
Unlike plaintiff’s claims, the Ferra district court ruling acknowledged that the plaintiff’s
claims in that case did not involve walkway and/or rail yard conditions. Unlike plaintiff’s claims
in this case, the Ferra plaintiff’s claims involved mainline track ballast, not yard track ballast.
There was no allegation of deficiencies involving walkways in Ferra. The Ferra district court
opinion as a factual matter simply does not apply to this case.
The Ferra, Crabbe and Nickels 3 district court opinions also relied exclusively on Norris v.
Central of Georgia Railroad Co., 635 S.E.2d 179 (Ga. App. 2006), as the singular legal basis for
concluding as a matter of law that the FRSA, and 49 C.F.R. §213.103 in particular, substantially
subsumed FELA ballast claims. The Ferra district court opinion states:
What is determinative is whether the regulations at issue cover or
substantially subsume the subject matter.
To the extent that [Ferra’s] FELA claim rests upon different ways by
which [Defendant] might have supported the mainline track to comply
with 49 C.F.R. 213.103, the negligence claim is precluded. The fact that
the regulation does not specify any size for the various purposes of the
ballast does not alter the fact that the regulation nonetheless “covers” or
“substantially subsumes” the subject matter of a ballast selection relative

The Nickels district court opinion relied exclusively on the district court’s opinion in the Ferra case. The Nickels
opinion cited no other cases to support its holding that the FRSA regulation, 49 C.F.R. §213.103, substantially
subsumed the plaintiff’s FELA claim. However, because the Ferra opinion relied exclusively on the Norris case, it
is presumed that the Nickels district court likewise relied on the Norris case.

to track maintenance. Norris, 635 S.E.2d at 183. The Court agrees with
the reasoning in Norris.
Id. (quoting Norris, 635 S.E.2d at 183, fn. 20). The above passage represents the district court’s
sole legal basis for finding that the regulation substantially subsumed the Ferra plaintiff’s FELA
claims.
The Georgia Court of Appeals in Norris, however, improvidently relied upon the New
York federal district court case of Tufariello v. Long Island R. Co., 364 F.Supp.2d 252
(E.D.N.Y. 2005), as its sole legal basis for concluding that the Norris plaintiff’s FELA ballast
claims were substantially subsumed by 49 C.F.R. §203.103. See Norris, 635 S.E.2d at 183.
Relying solely on Tufariello, the Georgia Court of Appeals held:
The fact that the regulation does not specify any size for the various purposes of the
ballast does not alter the fact that the regulation nonetheless “covers” or “substantially
subsumes” the subject matter of a ballast selection relative to track maintenance. FN20.
***
See generally Tufariello v. Long Island R. Co., 364 F.Supp.2d 252, 259-260
(E.D.N.Y. 2005)(applicability of preemption provision in the FRSA was not altered
where federal regulation concerning locomotive horns set a minimum level but did not
specify a maximum level).
FN20.

Id.
The district court’s conclusions allowing preemption in Tufariello, however, was flatly
rejected by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Tufariello v. Long Island R. Co., 458 F.3d
80, 85-6 (2nd Cir. 2006). A copy of Tufariello v. Long Island R. Co., 458 F.3d 80 (2nd Cir. 2006)
is attached as Exhibit 10, and is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
In Tufariello, a railroad worker brought a FELA action claiming that his employer
railroad failed to provide him adequate hearing protection. The New York district court granted
summary judgment for the railroad on the basis that the worker’s FELA claims were preempted
by FRSA regulations 49 C.F.R. §229.129, which establishes minimum sound levels for warning

devices on trains. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately reversed the district court’s
grant of summary judgment for the railroad, holding that the FRSA regulations, including 49
C.F.R. §229.129, “do not address the circumstances under which railroad employees must be
provided hearing protection.” See Tufariello, 458 F.3d at 86.
The Second Circuit’s rejection of the district court’s preemption ruling in Tufariello is
important for 2 reasons: 1) it vitiates the sole legal basis for the Norris Court’s preemption
ruling, thus rendering the Ferra, Nickels and Crabbe district court holdings unsupported at law
and inapplicable in the instant case; and 2) it is instructive in plaintiff’s case.
As the regulation in Tufariello may have arguably loosely touched on the subject matter
of the Tufariello plaintiff’s FELA claim – i.e., warning sounds leading to hearing loss due to
railroad’s failure to provide hearing protection – so too the regulation at issue in this case may
arguably loosely touch on the subject matter of plaintiff’s FELA claims – i.e., dangerous
walkways where ballast is located leading to knee injury. However, the Second Circuit in
Tufariello reminds us that to “substantially subsume” a plaintiff’s FELA claims, and thus justify
the drastic remedy of precluding a railroad worker’s sole avenue of recovery, requires that the
regulation do more than merely touch on or concern the subject matter of the claim.
III.

CONCLUSION
Defendant is asking this Court to effectively repeal by subsequent regulatory enactment

the 100-year-old federal negligence law that is the FELA, and replace it with a 68 word federal
regulation, the plain language of which evidences that it is devoted solely to a ensuring that
railroad tracks are properly supported in order to prevent train derailments.
Plaintiff’s FELA claims and 49 C.F.R. §213.103 are not in conflict. One (1)
complements and supplements the other. Together they effectuate the overriding purpose of both

the FELA and FRSA – to promote rail safety and reduce railroad related injuries. This was
Congress’ intent.
Allowing plaintiff’s FELA claims to go forward, and denying defendant’s Motion for
Summary Judgment, will frustrate neither the clear and unambiguous purpose of 49 C.F.R.
§213.103, nor the purpose of the FRSA regulations in general – national uniformity of railroad
safety laws to the extent practicable.
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied.
