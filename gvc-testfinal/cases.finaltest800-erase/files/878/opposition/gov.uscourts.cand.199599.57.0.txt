1

Marvell Semiconductor, Inc. (“Marvell”) argues that good cause exists for filing the

2

proposed surreply because “[t]he June 6th Covenant is new information . . . .” Marvell is

3

wrong—the June 6th Covenant is not new information. The June 6th Covenant is verbatim

4

the same covenant as the March 28th Covenant (exhibit A to the Motion to Dismiss) with the

5

sole exception that the June 6th Covenant applies to Marvell’s new Tavor chipset family as

6

opposed to the PXA90x family of chipsets that Marvell was selling at the time it filed its

7

declaratory judgment complaint.

8

Marvell previously described the March 28th Covenant for the PXA90x family of

9

chipsets as a “broad covenant not to sue.” Opposition at 5. Indeed, in its Opposition to the

10

Motion to Dismiss, Marvell complained that “Wi-LAN has not given an equally broad

11

covenant not to sue on Marvell Release 5 products which are either in, or about to enter, the

12

market, such as the Tavor family of chipsets.” Id. at 5. Pursuant to Marvell’s request,

13

Wi-LAN granted Marvell the same broad covenant not to sue on the new Tavor family of

14

chipsets.

15

Marvell’s proposed Surreply belatedly seeks to raise issues with the scope of the

16

covenant—issues Marvell did not raise previously—and it does so despite the fact that

17

Wi-LAN has provided the same broad covenant not to sue it provided for the PXA90x

18

family of chipsets.

19

covenant.

Marvell should not now be heard to complain about the scope of the

20

Furthermore, Marvell’s Motion to File a Surreply should be denied as the Proposed

21

Surreply is futile. Marvell argues that the “broad covenant not to sue” is limited in two

22

respects:

23

covenant excludes future products. Neither perceived limitation is sufficient for the Court to

24

maintain jurisdiction.

1) the covenant does not include Marvell’s affiliated companies; and 2) the

25

First, “conceivable claims against ‘affiliates’ of the plaintiffs . . . are insufficient to

26

generate the required actual cases or controversies that have been extinguished by [the]

27

covenant not to sue the plaintiffs on the claims of the [] patent.” In re Columbia Univ.

28

Patent Litig., 343 F. Supp. 2d 35, 49 (D. Mass. 2004).

Second, future products of unknown, undefined scope cannot be of “sufficient

2

immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” Cat Tech., LLC v.

3

Tubemaster, Inc., No. 2007-1443, slip op. at 10 (Fed. Cir. May 28, 2008) (citing

4

MedImmune, Inc. v. Genetech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007) (internal citation and

5

quotation marks omitted)). Marvell has the burden of establishing the immediacy and reality

6

of future products sufficient for declaratory judgment jurisdiction; but, Marvell has done

7

nothing more than advance an unsupported allegation of possible future products. As this

8

Court has explained, “‘[t]he residual possibility of a future infringement suit based on []

9

future acts is simply too speculative a basis for jurisdiction over [a] counterclaim for

10

declaratory judgments of invalidity.’” Sharper Image Corp. v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc., Nos. C

11

02-4860 CW; C 04-0529 CW, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32425, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 31,

12

2005) (quoting Super Sack Mfg. Corp. v. Chase Packaging Corp., 57 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed.

13

Cir. 1995)).

14

There is no new information justifying Marvell’s request for leave to file its proposed

15

Surreply. Wi-LAN, therefore, respectfully requests that the Court deny Marvell’s Motion

16

for Leave to File a Surreply.

17

Wi-LAN also respectfully submits that the record is clear that no case or controversy

18

exists to maintain declaratory judgment jurisdiction, and a hearing to decide this matter is,

19

therefore, unnecessary, especially in view of the covenants that Wi-LAN has provided, not

20

only for the PXA90x family of chipsets being sold at the time the Complaint was filed—

21

which is when jurisdiction must be established by Marvell—but also for the new Tavor

22

family of chip sets.
