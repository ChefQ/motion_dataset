Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-11, Marvell Semiconductor, Inc. (“Marvell”) respectfully

23

requests leave of Court to file a surreply in response to Wi-LAN, Inc.’s Reply in Support of Its

24

Motion to Dismiss Marvell Semiconductor, Inc.’s Suit for Declaratory Relief. The surreply that

25

Marvell requests leave to file is submitted herewith as Exhibit A.

26

There is good cause for filing the proposed surreply. Wi-LAN’s Reply was served on June 6,

27

2008. On that same day, Wi-LAN sent Marvell a new covenant not to sue (“the June 6th Covenant”)

28

and filed the June 6th Covenant as Exhibit A to the Reply. In its Reply, Wi-LAN’s makes arguments

in support of its Motion to Dismiss with reference to the June 6th Covenant. The June 6th Covenant

2

is new information that Marvell did not have on May 30, 2008, when it filed its Opposition.

3

Marvell requests leave to file a surreply to address facts and misleading arguments relating to

4

the new June 6th Covenant not to sue. 1 For example, Wi-LAN argues that, with the June 6th

5

Covenant, there is no remaining controversy between the parties. This is not true, and Marvell seeks

6

leave to file a surreply to respond to this argument.

Marvell’s attorneys provided Wi-LAN’s attorneys with a copy of the proposed surreply
(Exhibit A) and asked that Wi-LAN stipulate to its filing, but Wi-LAN refused to stipulate.
Marvell respectfully requests that, if this Motion is granted by the Court, the Court direct the
Clerk to enter into the record the surreply in Exhibit A.

SUPPORTING DECLARATION OF LINDA J. THAYER
12
I, LINDA J. THAYER, declare as follows:
13
1

I am an attorney licensed to practice before this Court and all courts of the State of

14
California, and am a member of Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner L.L.P., counsel
15
for Marvell in the above-entitled action.
16
2.

The matters stated herein are based upon my personal knowledge, and if called as a

17
witness, would testify as to the following statements.
18
3.

Exhibit A is a copy of the surreply that Marvell requests leave to file.

4.

On June 6, 2008, shortly after receiving Wi-LAN’s Reply and new covenant, I

19
20
contacted Wi-LAN’s counsel and requested that Wi-LAN stipulate to Marvell’s filing of a surreply.
21
5.

On June 9, 2008, Wi-LAN’s counsel responded that they needed to review a copy of

22
the surreply that Marvell intended to file before Wi-LAN would stipulate.
23
6.

Early today, I emailed Wi-LAN’s attorneys a copy of the surreply, filed herewith as

24
Exhibit A, and requested that Wi-LAN stipulate to its filing.
25
26

By addressing only this issue in the surreply, Marvell does not suggest that the Reply
contains no other matters requiring response. Marvell believes it can address those issues at the
hearing.

INTRODUCTION

2

Marvell filed this declaratory judgment action to obtain relief for itself—and those Marvell

3

partners making, using, importing, and selling, or about to make, use, import, or sell, its Release 5

4

CDMA chipsets, including “Tavor.” Wi-LAN’s most recent covenant to Marvell—delivered on

5

June 6, 2008, with its Reply—is limited in scope in several key areas, such that Marvell remains

6

fearful of liability for developing, making, and selling these products. First, Wi-LAN has refused to

7

include Marvell’s subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors and suppliers in any covenant not to sue,

8

intentionally leaving those entities exposed to future lawsuits from Wi-LAN. Second, Wi-LAN

9

limits its offer to past and existing products, ignoring Marvell’s representations that it has

10

substantially developed products about to hit the market and leaving those products in a state of

11

limbo. Wi-LAN’s carefully worded covenant also excludes so-called “derivative” products, those

12

future products based on the existing products which may differ in small detail from existing

13

products. Marvell does not want to, nor should it have to, halt its very active development and sales

14

efforts when it believes these products are also non-infringing. However, until this Court finds the

15

patents-in-suit invalid or all of Marvell’s products non-infringing, Marvell and its customers,

16

subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors, and suppliers, would have to live with that fear. If forced to live

17

under a cloud while Wi-LAN waits to enforce its patents, Marvell products may be irreparably

18

disadvantaged in the competitive marketplace. The very essence of the Declaratory Judgment Act is

19

that Marvell be allowed to get peace of mind now—either from Wi-LAN or this Court. Since Wi-

20

LAN has to date refused to give Marvell full peace of mind, Marvell asks this Court to exercise its

21

discretion to do so.

Marvell’s Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Distributors, and Suppliers Are

1

import, or sell Marvell’s Tavor family of chipsets. To date, Wi-LAN has refused leaving one to

2

assume that Wi-LAN is reserving the right to sue up and down the supply chain at some future

3

date—just like it is currently doing with the Texas Actions 1 involving another of Marvell’s product

4

lines. In the two Texas Actions, Wi-LAN filed suit against chip suppliers like Marvell, Broadcom

5

and Intel, computer makers like Apple, Dell, Lenovo and Sony, and retailers like Best Buy and

6

Circuit City. Jim Skippen, Wi-LAN's president and CEO, has publicly stated that suing multiple

7

companies in the product chain is Wi-LAN’s intentional plan to bring “maximum pressure” on the

8

companies to settle. 2

9

The Declaratory Judgment Act is designed to provide companies like Marvell an alternative

10

to waiting for a patent owner like Wi-LAN to employ “scare-the-customer-and-run tactics that

11

infect[ed] the competitive environment of the business community with uncertainty and insecurity.”

12

Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 482 F.3d. 1330, 1336 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Wi-

13

LAN has already brandished its patents (including the RE37,802 patent (“the ’802 patent”) at issue

14

here), both in pre-litigation communications and by filing the Texas Actions. Marvell filed this suit

15

to gain some assurance for itself and its customers, subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors, and suppliers

16

that they will be forever free from threat of suit with regard to the Marvell Release 5 CDMA

17

products. To that end, a covenant not to sue that does not also protect others in the Marvell product

18

supply chain only delays resolution of this existing controversy to a later date of Wi-LAN’s

19

choosing and is inconsistent with the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.

“the Texas Actions”).

Page 5 of 8

Wi-LAN’s Covenant Excludes Products Existing After June 6th

2

Wi-LAN’s covenant not to sue also excludes products about to hit the market and leaves

3

those products in a state of limbo. Wi-LAN’s June 6th Covenant described the covered products as

4

“Marvell’s Tavor UMTS Release 5 HSDPA chipsets, as those chipsets exist today or have existed in

5

the past.” However, Marvell has chipsets with this core processor technology in various stages of

6

development, from the PXA930 processor currently being sold in the recently-released Blackberry

7

Bold handset, 3 to variations and improvements on this core processor technology under development

8

by Marvell and its customers which have been simulated, validated, and taped out, but are not yet

9

released. Still others have finalized designs based on the fixed Release 5 standard, but have not yet

10

been taped out or implemented in a prototype; however, significant amounts of time and money have

11

been spent developing these products. Under a strict literal reading of the June 6th Covenant, Wi-

12

LAN could argue that any variation or improvement product released after June 6, 2008, is excluded

13

from the covenant.

14

As Marvell has explained in its Opposition, with this language, Wi-LAN also conveniently

15

left itself the argument that Marvell products that have been modified—even in slight,

16

inconsequential ways unrelated to the core processor technology—after June 6, 2008, also fall

17

outside the covenant and remain fair game. Marvell has such so-called “derivative” products already

18

in the pipeline and would like the freedom to release others. Without an assurance from Wi-LAN

19

that derivative products would not infringe (which Wi-LAN has not yet given even as to existing

20

products) or adjudication by this Court of the questions of whether products with the core processor

21

technology infringes and/or whether the Wi-LAN patents are invalid, Marvell is commercially

22

harmed, as it is effectively prevented from further expanding the product line based on the Tavor

23
24
3

25
26

In Marvell’s Opposition and the supporting Declaration of Shyam Krishnamurthy, the fact
that the Tavor PXA930M processor was to be released in the Blackberry Bold was redacted as
confidential. See Opposition, p. 4; Declaration of Shyam Krishnamurthy, ¶ 9. This information is
now currently available and therefore need not be redacted or kept confidential in future papers.

1

UMTS Release 5 HSDPA technology, even though it is confident that these derivative products also

2

do not or would not infringe the patents-at-issue in this suit.

3

Wi-LAN fashioned its June 6th Covenant after the one in Crossbow Tech, II, on a mistaken

4

belief that Crossbow Tech. II sets the standard for sufficiency of covenants not to sue. See Crossbow

5

Tech., Inc. v. YH Tech., 531 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1122 (N.D. Ca. 2007) [hereinafter “Crossbow Tech

6

II”]. However, sufficiency is determined by the specific facts of each situation, and the situation in

7

Crossbow Tech II bears no factual resemblance to the current case. In Crossbow Tech II, the

8

covenant not to sue was limited to the listed products “as they exist today or have existed in the

9

past,” in part because that is all the situation dictated. Id. Prior court decisions had so limited the

10

scope of relief available to Crossbow, that it decided to dismiss—with prejudice—its infringement

11

suit against the accused infringer. 4 Crossbow did not offer, and the accused infringer did not

12

demand, that the convent include future products because they were not relevant to that case. 5 The

13

court agreed that “the covenant in [that] case is exhaustive of all potentially infringing products that

14

Crossbow may sue for” and granted Crossbow’s motion, dismissing the case. Crossbow Tech. II, Id.

15

While the court found that the covenant as worded in Crossbow Tech II was sufficient under the

16

factual scenario of that case to remove subject matter jurisdiction, Crossbow Tech II does not stand

17

for the proposition that the exact same wording in other situations, like the one here, would also be

18

sufficient.

19

Wi-LAN also argues that its June 6th Covenant “directly parallels” the covenant that it gave

20

Marvell on its PXA90x chipsets, products which it has already admitted do not infringe. Reply, p. 3.

21
22
23
24
25

4

A few months before the decision in Crossbow Tech II, the Crossbow Court has dismissed
other defendants in the case and, shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court issued its decision in
Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.S. ---, 127 S. Ct. 1746 (2007), limiting liability for software
developed in the United States and exported to a foreign country to be copied and incorporated into
an infringing product. Crossbow Tech II, 531 F. Supp. 2d at 1119.
5

It should be noted that the covenant not to sue in Crossbow Tech II also involved an
individual accused infringer, having no subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors, and suppliers, and
therefore there was no need to include them. Additionally, the only infringement at issue was the
individual’s past development of a purportedly infringing device for a prior company.

1

But whether the June 6th Covenant “parallels” any earlier covenant is not the question, and is

2

irrelevant because Wi-LAN has agreed the PXA90x does not infringe. What matters is whether the

3

covenant granted by Wi-LAN fully resolves the existing controversy between the parties under the

4

law. For the reasons stated above, it does not.

5

B.

This Court Should Exercise Its Discretion to Hear This Action Because Doing So
Would Afford Marvell and Others Relief From Uncertainty Over Its Products

6
District courts are given the discretion, in declaratory judgment actions, whether to hear the
7
actions, and Marvell respectfully submits that this Court should do so in this case. Even pre8
MedImmune, the Federal Circuit counseled that"[w]hen there is an actual controversy and a
9
declaratory judgment would settle the legal relations in dispute and afford relief from uncertainty or
10
insecurity, in the usual circumstance the declaratory judgment is not subject to dismissal."
11
Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 998 F.2d 931, 937 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Since the Supreme Court’s
12
decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118 (2007), the Federal Circuit has urged
13
district courts to employ an even more lenient standard, stating that “an Article III case or
14
controversy will arise and the party need not risk a suit for infringement by engaging in the
15
identified activity before seeking a declaration of its legal rights.”

SanDisk Corp. v.

16
STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v.
17
Novartis Pharm. Corp., 482 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Federal Circuit adopted the "all
18
circumstances" test that the Supreme Court had suggested in MedImmune as the proper approach.
19
Under that approach, all the circumstances must show (1) that the party instituting suit has standing
20
and (2) that the issue presented is ripe. MedImmune, 549 U.S. at n.8 (a matter is ripe when there is
21
“hardship to the parties [in] withholding court consideration” citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387
22
U.S. 136, 149 (1967)).
23
24
III.

CONCLUSION

25
The Declaratory Judgment Act provides companies like Marvell with the option of not sitting
26
around waiting for Wi-LAN’s patent litigation shoe to fall. Marvell wants to go forward in the

marketplace with products that it believes do not infringe. Wi-LAN will not allow Marvell to do so.

2

Therefore, Marvell asks that this court deny Wi-LAN’s motion to dismiss as a controversy ripe for

3

judicial action exists between the parties. Denying Wi-LAN’s motion will afford Marvell the

4

opportunity to obtain some certainty over its product line that Marvell has not been able to get from

5

Wi-LAN directly.
