CIVIL ACTION NO.
08-11908 RWZ

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S RULE 56 (f) REQUEST
Defendants have filed a motion to strike the affidavit of plaintiff’s counsel filed pursuant
to F.R.Civ.P. 56(f). (Doc. 68). Plaintiff Wen Y. Chiang (“Chiang”) filed this request by the
Affidavit of Dean Carnahan (Doc. 63), pursuant to Rule 56(f), in opposition to defendants’
summary judgment motion.
On May 3, 2010, plaintiff served interrogatories and a document request on defendants.
Defendants did not serve their interrogatory answers or document request until June 25, 2010.
On or before July 8, 2010, Chiang filed motions for Court orders directing the three credit
reporting agencies (“CRAs”) to produce documents responsive to the Schedule A attached to the
Court orders. On July 14, 2010, the Court issued the requested orders. After receiving the
responses from the CRAs, on August 13, 2010, plaintiff filed motions requesting that the three
CRAs be held in contempt for violation of the Court’s orders. (Docs. 54, 55 and 56).1

The Court has not ruled on these motions for contempt. Plaintiff also filed a motion requesting a Confidentiality
Order to be signed by the Court, as requested by Experian. (Doc. 58). The Court has not ruled on this motion.

There is no merit to defendants’ motion to strike the Rule 56(f) affidavit. Defendants cite
the case of Great Northern Ins. Co. v. Architectural Env’ts, Inc., 2997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76003
(Dein,J.), quoting Adorno v. Crowley Towing & Transp. Co., 443 F. 3d 122, 127 (1st Civ. 2006).
The Adorno case discussed a motion for additional discovery filed after the discovery cut-off
date.2 First, Plaintiff has presented the Rule 56(f) affidavit of counsel in a timely manner, since
he quickly filed his motions for contempt and the motion for a Confidentiality order after
receiving the initial responses from the CRAs. Thus, plaintiff has continued in a proper and
timely manner to obtain the necessary discovery from the CRAs. Secondly, Chiang has shown
good cause for failure to discover the facts sooner, since he promptly sent the Court orders to the
CRAs and timely filed motions after he received the initial documents from the CRAs. Third, it
is probable that the CRAs have all of the documents ordered to be produced by the Court orders.
These documents should be produced in a timely manner after the Court rules on the motion filed
by Chiang. Finally, the documents sought from the CRAs will influence the outcome of the
pending summary judgment motion.
Defendants argue that Chiang should have filed a motion under Rule 56(f). However,
Rule 56(f) provides for an affidavit filed in response to a summary judgment motion and
that is exactly what Chiang filed.
Chiang does not know what the documents not yet produced by the CRAs will show
without seeing these documents. However, all of the documents set forth in Schedule A to the
Court orders are documents relevant to Chiang’s FCRA claim. Chiang needs these documents to
show more clearly that BOA violated the FCLA.
Plaintiff also filed a motion to add the three credit reporting agencies as defendants. The Court has not ruled this
motion.

The Ardono case is not on point, since in the present case, plaintiff has file an affidavit, specifically allowed by
Rule 56(f).

Defendants argue the plaintiff’s counsel’s affidavit does not explain the specific
documents he expects to obtain from the CRAs. However, these specific documents are set forth
in the Schedule A attached to each of the Court’s orders.
Defendants argue that they have produced ten (10) ACDVs that they received from the
CRAs. However, the records from the CRAs could show that defendants received more that ten
(10) ACDVs, showing that the affidavit submitted by defendants is false and that the
defendants are misleading to this Court.
Defendants argue that the affidavit of plaintiff’s counsel fails to show good cause for
failing to obtain the documents from the CRAs sooner. However, plaintiff’s counsel informed
the Court and defendants’ attorney that he would obtain discovery responses from defendants
first, then seek Court orders directed to the CRAs. Any delay has been caused by the CRAs’
violation of the Court orders.
Defendants argue that in a previous case between the parties, the CRAs did not have the
documents plaintiff’s counsel thought they had. This arguments is false, since the CRAs did not
go beyond their desktop computers and did not produce documents they had in storage or in
“archives” as one CRA representative stated.
There was no reason for plaintiff to seek Court orders directed to the CRAs sooner.
Defendants cannot dictate the strategy of plaintiff’s counsel. By obtaining discovery responses
from defendants first, then obtaining the records from the CRAs, erroneous or false statements in
defendants’ discovery responses can be revealed.
The only reason that plaintiff had to file a Rule 56(f) affidavit was that the CRAs violated
the Court’s orders.
