DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S
PURPORTED REQUEST PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 56(f)
In his opposition to the motion filed by Defendants FIA Card Services, N.A. (“FIA”),1
and Bank of America, N.A. (collectively “Defendants”) for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s
sole remaining Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claim, Plaintiff weakly argues that the
motion should be denied pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because
he lacks a basis in fact for opposing the motion. To the extent that this argument is construed by
the Court as a request pursuant to Rule 56(f), it should be rejected because the Plaintiff has failed
to comply with the requirements of Rule 56(f).
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) provides as follows:
Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion [for summary
judgment] that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts
essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for
judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or
depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is
just.

1 FIA was formerly known as MBNA America Bank, N.A. (and erroneously sued herein as
MBNA America Bank).

Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). However, in this jurisdiction, a Rule 56(f) "motion must (1) be presented
in a timely manner; (2) show good cause for the failure to discover the necessary facts sooner;
(3) set forth a plausible basis for believing that the necessary facts probably exist and can be
learned in a reasonable time; and (4) establish that the sought facts, if found, will influence the
outcome of the pending motion for summary judgment." Great Northern Ins. Co. v.
Architectural Env'ts, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76003 (Dein, J.), quoting Adorno v. Crowley
Towing & Transp. Co., 443 F.3d 122, 127 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Velez v. Awning Windows,
Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 39-40 (1st Cir. 2004) (affidavit or "its functional equivalent" required by Rule
56(f)); Brilmyer v. Univ. of Chi., 431 F. Supp. 2d 154, 160 (2006). Where, as here, the party
opposing summary judgment has not filed a Rule 56(f) motion, has not provided any indication
of the discovery it seeks to obtain in connection with its opposition or explained how such
information might influence the outcome of the pending motion for summary judgment, and has
not shown good cause for his failure to obtain the discovery sooner, neither denial of
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment2 nor any delay in its consideration are warranted.
In his opposition to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff asserts that he
“cannot present affidavits or certifications from the three [credit reporting agencies] since all
three have ignored the orders of this Court entered on July 14, 2010,” and that “these CRA
records are necessary for Chiang to support his opposition to the summary judgment motion.” In
the affidavit filed with the opposition, plaintiff’s counsel asserts only that the Court issued orders
directing the credit reporting agencies (“CRAs”) to produce records concerning the Plaintiff (to
the extent the CRAs have such records, of course), the CRAs have collectively produced only a

2 Plaintiff’s argument that Defendants’ motion should be denied is ludicrous. No suggestion has
been made that Plaintiff’s inability to marshal any relevant facts to oppose the motion for
summary judgment was caused by Defendants’ failure to produce records, and there is no good
reason why Defendants’ motion should be denied because Plaintiff waited until the eleventh hour
to request the discovery he now is complaining about.

few unspecified documents, and that Plaintiff therefore cannot present affidavits or certifications
in opposition to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff has not filed a motion
under Rule 56(f) asking the Court to either deny Defendants’ motion for summary judgment or
for a continuance, and his counsel’s affidavit does not describe the information Plaintiff expects
to obtain from the CRAs, how any such information might influence the outcome of the pending
motion for summary judgment, or show good cause for his failure to obtain the discovery sooner,
particularity in light of the fact that this action has been pending for almost two years.
The relief requested by Plaintiff in his opposition should be denied solely on the grounds
that he failed to file a motion under Rule 56(f). But even if his argument is construed by the
Court as a motion under Rule 56(f) it should be denied because Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the
other requirements for relief under the rule.
Nowhere in his affidavit does Plaintiff’s counsel offer any explanation of the specific
information he expects to obtain from the CRAs, set forth a plausible basis for believing that the
information exists and can be obtained in a reasonable time, or establish that the information
sought will influence the outcome of the pending motion for summary judgment. See Great
Northern Ins. Co. v. Architectural Env'ts, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76003 (Dein, J.). It
remains entirely speculative as to what information the CRAs might have, and whether that
information is material or relevant to this action or the issues raised by Defendant’s motion.
Under §1681s-2(b) of FCRA, if a credit furnisher is notified by a CRA about a consumer
dispute regarding the completeness or accuracy of the credit information furnished, the furnisher
has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation with respect to the disputed information, review
the relevant information provided by the credit bureau, and report the findings to the bureau. 15
U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b)(1); see also Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir.
2010). Thus, the obligation to conduct an investigation is triggered only by the furnisher’s actual
receipt of notification of a dispute by means of an ACDV.

In this case, Defendants produced copies of ten (10) ACDVs that it received from the
CRAS with respect to Plaintiff’s account, along with an affidavit confirming that these were the
only ACDVs received from the CRAs with respect to the Plaintiff’s account. Plaintiff has
offered no plausible basis for believing that Defendants received any other ACDVs with respect
to Plaintiff’s account, and in fact made no attempt to obtain discovery from the CRAs on this
issue until almost twenty months after this action was commenced. Since any information that
may be in the possession of the CRAs that was never provided to Defendants by the CRAs in one
of the ten ACDVs actually received by Defendants is irrelevant (because the Defendants’ duty to
investigate arises only upon receipt from a CRA of notice of a dispute), Plaintiff cannot satisfy
the requirements for obtaining relief under Rule 56(f)..
Moreover, the affidavit of Plaintiff’s counsel fails to show (or even attempt to show)
good cause for failing to obtain the discovery sooner. This action has been pending since
November 2008 and Plaintiff made no attempt to obtain discovery from the CRAs until early
July 2010, after all party discovery was complete.3 Plaintiff’s counsel has filed a number of
FCRA cases in this Court, including two against the Defendants4 and therefore should be
knowledgeable of the types of documents and information needed to prove his client’s case
under the statute. In fact, in a similar case that he filed on Plaintiff’s behalf against the
Defendants,5 Plaintiff’s counsel similarly waited until after all party discovery was complete to
request orders from the Court to compel the CRAs to produce records. Those efforts were
fruitless because the CRAs did not have the documents that Plaintiff’s counsel apparently was

3 Plaintiff also made no attempt to obtain discovery from Defendants until May 3, 2010, when he

served interrogatories and requests for production of documents. This was the only discovery he
requested of the Defendants.

N.A., No. 07-11733 (RWZ); Chiang v. MBNA and FIA Card Services, N.A., No. 06-12258

hoping they might have, even though he also had no plausible basis there for believing that such
documents existed. In light of his experience with FCRA claims, Plaintiff’s counsel reasonably
could have been expected to issue subpoenas to the CRAs (and obtain such orders from the Court
as might be necessary to compel the CRAs to respond to the subpoenas) immediately following
commencement of the action. His failure to wait until completion of discovery and his decision
to wait until the status conference scheduled by the Court to request appropriate orders is
inexplicable, and under the circumstances, should preclude Plaintiff from obtaining relief under
Rule 56(f).
