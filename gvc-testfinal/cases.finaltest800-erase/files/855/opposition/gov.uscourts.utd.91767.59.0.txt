INTRODUCTION
This is a federal securities class action brought by Lead Plaintiff State-Boston Retirement

System (“Plaintiff” or “State-Boston”), a large sophisticated institutional investor, on behalf of a
class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.
(“Nu Skin” or the “Company”) between May 4, 2011 and January 17, 2014, inclusive (the “Class
Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.1
Nu Skin sells personal skin care products and nutritional supplements all over the world.
Sales are made almost exclusively on a person to person basis, not in stores. The Company’s
growth can be attributed to the ability of current sales representatives to recruit new sales
representatives (i.e., their “downlines”), and for these new sales representatives to recruit their
own downline of newer sales representatives, and so on. Sales representatives are compensated
with commissions, not only for their own sales, but for sales made by downline sales
representatives whom they recruited. This is known in the industry as “multi-level marketing”
(or “MLM”) and “multi-level compensation,” and collectively, this model is often called a
“pyramid scheme” where the people at the top of the pyramid receive virtually all the benefits
and the people at the bottom do not fare as well.
In almost all countries, some form of MLM is permitted. One noteworthy exception is
the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “Mainland China”). Nu Skin began selling in
Mainland China many years ago. But the PRC’s strict prohibition on MLM and direct selling

1

“Defendants” include Nu Skin, M. Truman Hunt (“Hunt”) and Ritch N. Wood (“Wood”).
Hunt and Wood are referred to herein as the “Individual Defendants.”

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 12 of 66

(known well to Defendants) kept Nu Skin’s operations from growing at a rate that Mainland
China’s increasingly large population might warrant. That is, until 2011.
As detailed in the Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“Complaint”), over the course
of two and one half years, Defendants pursued a massive expansion into Mainland China
knowing that Nu Skin’s form of multi-level compensation violated many of the PRC’s
regulations on direct selling and pyramid schemes. During the Class Period, Defendants
repeatedly and misleadingly misrepresented how Nu Skin was operating its business in Mainland
China in order to create the appearance that the Company’s double-digit growth in Mainland
China was achieved in compliance with China’s laws and regulations when Defendants knew (or
at a minimum were reckless in not knowing) that Nu Skin was not in compliance. Further,
Defendants failed to disclose that Nu Skin’s internal controls were intentionally (or at least
recklessly) inadequate to supervise the training of new sales representatives and when faced with
a report halfway through the Class Period essentially exposing Nu Skin’s wrongdoing,
Defendants steadfastly denied the report. In reality, Nu Skin was operating the very same MLM
system in Mainland China that it was operating around the world – a system specifically
prohibited in Mainland China. Confidential witnesses and internal documents used to train new
employees confirm a Nu Skin business that was not complying with China’s direct selling and
anti-pyramid regulations and contradicted Defendants’ representations. In fact, Defendants were
permitting the establishment of downlines in China in direct violation of Chinese law.
The level of detail alleged in the Complaint and the information obtained through
confidential witnesses and internal Company documents adequately puts Defendants on notice of
the substance of Lead Plaintiff’s claims. Indeed, Defendants had little difficulty in analyzing the
Complaint, understanding the falsity and scienter arguments, and addressing those arguments in

2

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 13 of 66

their opposition papers. Further, the Complaint explicitly connects the allegedly false statements
and omissions about the Company’s growth in China and its purported compliance with Chinese
law to the factual allegations demonstrating their falsity and highlighting the true nature of the
facts as known (but concealed) by Defendants. When the Complaint is viewed holistically, as
required by Supreme Court precedent, accepting its well pled facts and all inferences therefrom
as true, Defendants’ scienter has been adequately demonstrated. The Complaint also
demonstrates how Plaintiff’s losses were caused by Defendants’ misrepresentations, as Nu
Skin’s stock price declined upon revelation of what was really happening in Mainland China.
No doubt recognizing that Plaintiff adequately alleges violations of the federal securities
laws, Defendants improperly reach well beyond the four corners of the Complaint in order to
contradict its allegations with their own version of what they purportedly did and said. As set
forth in detail in Lead Plaintiff’s accompanying Motion to Strike, Defendants improperly rely
upon newspaper articles published after the Class Period to support their claim that Nu Skin has
not (yet) been found to be operating a pyramid scheme. Defendants also identify other
companies doing business in China and claim that their compensation structures are similar to
that of Nu Skin, apparently arguing that if Nu Skin is circumventing Chinese laws, it is not alone.
Trying to turn a settlement with one agency in China into a quasi-governmental finding of lawful
operations - which it is not - Defendants repeatedly suggest that Nu Skin has been exonerated by
Chinese authorities of operating a pyramid scheme, ignoring the fact - as alleged in the
Complaint - that investigations are still open and that there has been no formal acquittal.
Desperate to divert the Court’s attention away from the robust allegations of the
Complaint, Defendants even resort to attaching a chart misleadingly portraying Lead Plaintiff as
a “serial plaintiff, whose claims have been rejected as inadequate on their face by multiple courts

in nearly a half dozen cases. . . ” Defs. Br. at 13. In reality, State-Boston is exactly the type of
institutional investor that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”) was
designed to encourage to become a Lead Plaintiff and who has had strong success in holding
public companies responsible for causing investment losses.2 By relying on these and other
untested “facts” found nowhere in the Complaint, Defendants essentially concede that the
Complaint adequately states a claim to relief that is cogent and compelling.
The Court’s function on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to make factual determinations or
“weigh potential evidence that the parties might present at trial, but to assess whether the
plaintiff's complaint alone is legally sufficient to state a claim for which relief may be granted.”
Sutton v. Utah State Sch. For the Deaf & Blind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999) (internal

denied.

Statement of Facts

Nu Skin is a global multi-level marketing company that distributes personal skin care
products and nutritional supplements directly to consumers in the Americas, Europe, and the

In fact, in five of the cases listed on Exhibit D to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, in
which the court addressed a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs’ complaint was upheld at least in part
(NII, BP PLC, MF Global, Bank Atlantic, and Safenet) and in five cases the court granted the
motion to dismiss. Of the five motions to dismiss that were granted – two are currently on appeal
(Netflix and Stratte McClure). A motion to dismiss is currently pending only in the Barclays and
Freeport cases and a motion for summary judgment is being briefed in the Dole/Murdock case.
Exhibit D also misleadingly captions the last column as “settled/voluntarily dismissed prior to
MTD” and lists three cases under this heading. In reality, three cases on the list achieved
settlements of between $12 million and $90 million (including Fitzgerald, MF Global, and
Safenet) and the fourth case (Wildrick) was dismissed as moot only when the Defendant
voluntarily provided the relief requested by State-Boston. In short, out of the 18 cases listed on
Exhibit D – only three were lost on a motion to dismiss, while five survived a motion to dismiss
and four were resolved favorably for the Class.

Asia Pacific region. ¶¶2, 40.3 Nu Skin boasts that one of its competitive advantages is its global
sales compensation plan under which “a distributor is paid consolidated monthly commissions in
the distributor’s home country, in local currency, for the distributor’s own product sales and for
product sales in that distributor’s downline distributor network across all geographic markets.”
¶43.
In order to continue to grow its sales, the Company must constantly increase the number
of its “active” distributors. ¶44. As one geographic market reaches saturation, the Company
must expand to other countries in order to continue signing-up new distributors. Id. Further, as
less successful distributors drop out, they must be replaced by new distributors in new markets.
Id. If that does not happen, the whole scheme collapses. Id. As detailed below, the MLM
structure utilized by Nu Skin in the rest of the world was not supposed to be employed in
Mainland China, where strict rules and laws prohibiting the payment of multi-level
compensation were in place.
Prior to the start of the Class Period, growth in Nu Skin’s business in some of its larger,
more developed markets including Japan and the United States was on the decline. ¶54. Sales in
Mainland China were growing at a slow rate as well. ¶55. To offset the slowdown in growth in
Nu Skin’s major, more developed markets, Defendants orchestrated a plan to substantially
expand Nu Skin’s presence in the PRC. ¶¶4, 57. The decision to focus the Company’s resources
on growing business in the PRC was made despite the known stringent regulations in China
prohibiting the type of multi-level marketing and multi-level compensation employed by Nu
Skin in all of its other markets and despite the limited success Nu Skin had achieved in
penetrating the Chinese market to that point as a result of those stringent regulations. ¶4.

1.

Plaintiff’s Allegations of Nu Skin’s MLM Practices in China

China’s direct selling and anti-pyramid scheme regulations, enacted at the end of 2005,
are extremely restrictive and contain various limitations, including but not limited to: a complete
prohibition on multi-level marketing; restrictions on the ability to pay multi-level compensation;
and restrictions on how compensation can be calculated for direct sellers.¶¶50, 62.4 The nature of
the legal system in China gives regulatory agencies at both the local and central levels of
government the ability to enforce laws regulating direct marketing and prohibiting pyramid
schemes. ¶61.
Beginning in 2007, Nu Skin was permitted to sell its products in Mainland China through
both its retail stores and, for those products and sales representatives which and who were
properly licensed, through direct selling in the Shanghai and Beijing municipalities. ¶51.
However, there were stringent restrictions on direct selling. ¶53. Because of these stringent
regulations and the enforcement of those regulations by Chinese authorities, from 2007-2010
Mainland China represented only a small perc
entage of Nu Skin’s overall sales. In fact, from 2008-2009, Nu Skin closed the majority
of its retail stores in Mainland China and eliminated close to 1,000 retail sales positions. Id.
In early 2011, faced with slowing growth in its established markets, Defendants
embarked on a plan to substantially expand Nu Skin’s presence in Mainland China, lured in large
part by the size of its population and Nu Skin’s lack of market penetration. ¶55. By the start of
the Class Period, Nu Skin had obtained direct selling licenses in ten provinces and three
4

Contrary to what Defendants argue in their motion, Defs. Br. at 19, and claim in their
SEC filings, China’s anti-pyramid and direct selling regulations are quite straightforward. See
translation of those laws and regulations attached as Exhs. A and B to the Complaint. (Dkt. No.
51). “Defs. Br.” refers to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and Supporting Memorandum. (Dkt.
No. 53).

6

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 17 of 66

municipalities in Mainland China. ¶56. In addition, the Company operated approximately 40
retail stores in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. Id. However, Nu Skin’s retail stores in China
were not numerous enough nor did they have nearly the foot traffic the Company needed to
substantially expand its business in a meaningful way. Id.
Therefore, Defendants made the critical decision to not only attempt to obtain direct
selling licenses in additional cities and provinces to create the appearance of a legitimate direct
selling business, but, more importantly, to jump start growth in Nu Skin’s business in Mainland
China in the only way Defendants knew how – to expand the number of people selling Nu Skin’s
products in China, luring them in with the Company’s MLM strategy, notwithstanding strict
Chinese regulations prohibiting it. ¶57.
To that end, Defendants authorized existing Executive Distributors inside and outside the
PRC to sign-up a record number of sales representatives in Mainland China as part of their
downlines. ¶58.5 Newly recruited Chinese citizens were encouraged to become sales
representatives and distributors with the promise of reaping millions of yuan6 in commissions by
creating and expanding their own downlines among family and friends in Mainland China. Id.
Without the promise of earning commissions on downlines in Mainland China, Nu Skin would
have been unable to entice the number of distributors and sales representatives it needed to
penetrate the Chinese market and satisfy the demands of the Company’s Executive Directors
outside China. Id.
5

In Nu Skin’s structure, Executive Distributors are distributors who have achieved a
certain level of sales. ¶42. Executive Distributors in the United States were permitted to receive
commissions on sales by sales promoters and direct sellers located outside the United States if
those sales people were in the Executive Distributor’s downlines.¶43.
6

Renminbi or RMB is the official currency of the PRC and the “yuan” is the basic unit of
the renminbi.

7

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 18 of 66

Defendants also actively encouraged Nu Skin’s Executive Distributors in Taiwan, Hong
Kong, and Southeast Asia to aggressively recruit new sales distributors and direct sellers in
Mainland China. ¶59. Defendants promised to allow multi-level compensation for its Executive
Distributors hailing from outside of Mainland China as well as to all of the sales representatives
and direct sellers recruited by those living in Mainland China. Id.
During the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly and misleadingly misrepresented how Nu
Skin was operating its business in the PRC in order to create the appearance that the Company’s
growth in Mainland China was achieved in compliance with China’s laws and regulations. ¶7.
For example, Defendants told investors that Nu Skin developed a “hybrid” system of marketing
the Company’s products in the PRC, creating “teams” that marketed Nu Skin products and
shared in commissions and that this “hybrid” system, purportedly in conformity with Chinese
law created a tremendous surge in sales. Id.
In reality, Nu Skin was operating the very same MLM system in Mainland China that it
was operating everywhere else. ¶8. Confidential witnesses and internal documents used to train
new employees confirm that Nu Skin was not complying with China’s direct selling and antipyramid selling regulations. Id. In fact, quite the opposite - Defendants were permitting the
establishment of downlines in China in direct violation of China’s rules prohibiting multi-level
marketing. Id. Moreover, Defendants knowingly or recklessly failed to put in place a system of
internal controls that would have ensured that new sales representatives and direct sellers were
trained in compliance with Chinese law. The training that did exist was lax and inconsistent and
scarcely enforced – another violation of China’s regulations on direct selling. Id.

Confidential Witness Accounts and Internal Company
Documents

Confidential witnesses confirm that during the Class Period, direct sellers, sales
representatives, and distributors throughout Mainland China were promised and paid
commissions based not only on their own sales but on sales of their downline sales
representatives whom they recruited. ¶¶60, 66-78. Confidential witnesses also confirm that the
Company flouted other provisions of China’s direct selling regulations. Id.
For example, the Complaint alleges the following based on information obtained from
confidential witnesses:7


CW1, an Independent Distributor at Nu Skin from September 2011
until December 2013 - based in San Francisco - confirmed that
during the Class Period, he wanted to expand his downline into
China and sat for a multiple-choice examination given by Nu Skin
so that he could sponsor distributors in China. CW1 ultimately
decided against expanding his downline into China but is
personally aware of the fact that Nu Skin allowed such expansion
and that a few of his fellow independent distributors did expand
their downlines into China. CW1 stated that distributors who had
downlines in China had a special distributor ID number which
indicated that the distributor was allowed to sponsor people in
China. ¶60.



CW2, a Nu Skin Sales Manager in Beijing from April 2013 until
November 2013 confirmed that Nu Skin’s compensation was
similar to a pyramid, and everyone was expected to develop his/her
own downline. ¶67.



CW3, a Sales Representative in the Tianjin province from April
2013 until November 2013, confirmed that neither he nor any Nu
Skin sales representatives he knew had a direct selling license. Id.
CW3 also did not attend sales training meetings although he
attended some marketing meetings to learn about new Nu Skin
products. Id.

This is only a selection of each confidential witness account. For the full accounts, see
¶¶60, 66-78.

9

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 20 of 66



CW4, a Sales Representative from the Guangzhou province from
August 2012 through August 2013 corroborated that Nu Skin sales
representatives in China had downlines and that CW4 was part of a
downline. ¶68.



CW5, a Sales Representative in Nanjing from August 2011 to
February 2012, corroborated the existence of downlines in China.
CW5 stated “you can say it is like a pyramid scheme.” CW5 stated
that a salesman’s income depended upon the sales revenue
generated by the representatives and others on his team. CW5
confirmed there were 7 or 8 sales people under him and his income
depended on his team’s performance. ¶69.



CW6, an Analyst at Healthy Business Building Incentive, an
outside consultant for Nu Skin in Shanghai from September 2013
to March 2014, confirmed that distributors in Mainland China
received a cut of their downlines’ revenues as long as the
distributors and their downlines meet minimum sales requirements.
¶71.



CW7, a representative from Sales Support at Nu Skin corporate in
Utah also confirmed that Sales Support Reps handling Chinese
accounts let him know that there were downlines being set up in
China and that in 2012 Nu Skin “definitely had downlines” in
China. The call center set up the downlines for distributors in
Mainland China so that people could be signed up as downlines in
China the same way that they could be signed up as downlines in
the U.S. and Japan. ¶75.



CW8, a former Marketing Specialist at Nu Skin from July 2012 to
February 2014, who reported to Nu Skin’s Vice President of
Marketing and Vice President of Global Product Marketing, also
confirmed that shortly after he began at Nu Skin in July 2012, the
number of distributors based in China increased dramatically and
that downlines were created for those distributors. ¶76.



CW9, a Nu Skin Independent Distributor from 2010 to the present,
confirmed that all of the Chinese downlines reported into sales
executives in the U.S. ¶77. CW9 also reported that Nu Skin’s
corporate office in Utah can “see every sale that is going on by
every distributor” in China because the computer systems were the
same. Id.



CW10, a Sales Representative in Shanghai from December 2013
through April 2014 confirmed that as part of Nu Skin’s sales team
hierarchy, sales representatives had to develop their own
downlines in order to earn the title of Sales Representative. ¶70.
10

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 21 of 66

Nu Skin sales materials shared with potential recruits in China in early 2013 detail Nu
Skin’s strategy to encourage its direct sellers and sales representatives in China to create at least
six “generations” or layers of recruits underneath them to maximize their compensation. ¶72.8 In
these documents, Nu Skin calls the downlines of its sales representatives - sales “teams” - and
calls its multi-level compensation “team rewards” or “team awards” – but in reality, this was a
thinly-veiled disguise for allowing multi-level marketing and multi-level compensation in direct
violation of Chinese laws and regulations prohibiting MLM and pyramid schemes. Id. The
Complaint alleges that Defendants knew their “team rewards” system and “payment by team”
was in direct contravention of China’s prohibition of MLM and pyramid schemes. There are no
special exceptions under Chinese law for the sharing of “team rewards” by sales teams. Id. The
expected surge in sales in Mainland China did not surprise Defendants or anyone back at Nu
Skin’s headquarters. Nu Skin was able to monitor sales by all distributors and direct sellers in
Mainland China through a linked computer system. ¶77.
(b)

Defendants’ Frequent Trips to China

Defendants Hunt and Wood participated in meetings with government regulatory
representatives in China and understood well the direct selling and anti-pyramid selling
regulations and the fact that multi-level compensation was not allowed in any province or city in
Mainland China. ¶79. For example, on March 31, 2011, one month before the beginning of the
Class Period, defendant Hunt met with Wang Chao, China’s Vice-Minister of the Ministry of
Commerce. ¶80. According to media reports, Wang cautioned Hunt about Nu Skin’s “earnest
performance of social responsibilities” and about the Chinese government’s direct-selling

11

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 22 of 66

regulations and prohibitions on pyramid-selling. Id. At that meeting, Hunt and representatives
from Nu Skin China were informed of the rules on market access and industrial management. Id.
Chao also warned Nu Skin that the PRC would thoroughly implement the Administrative
Regulations on Direct-Selling and the Regulations on Prohibiting Pyramid-Selling to ensure the
steady and orderly development of the direct-selling industry. Id.
Moreover, Hunt and Wood frequently traveled to Mainland China for conventions and
sales meetings (detailed in the Complaint) and were acutely aware that their expansion plans for
Nu Skin in Mainland China were proceeding exactly as planned. ¶81.
2.

Defendants’ Circumvention of Chinese Laws and Regulations During
the Class Period Results in Exponential Growth in Nu Skin’s Sales in
China

Throughout the Class Period, Defendants touted astounding growth in Mainland China
attributing it to enthusiasm for Nu Skin’s anti-aging products and general business momentum
all the while failing to reveal how the exponential growth was really achieved – through
(i) MLM; (ii) the required purchase of products by newly recruited sales representatives; (iii)
vast networks of downlines; and (iv) poorly trained sales representatives who sold products not
authorized for direct sales in Mainland China. ¶¶9, 141.
By the end of 2013, revenues from Mainland China, which were a mere $91.4 million or
6% of Nu Skin’s overall revenues in 2010, skyrocketed to over $1 billion in revenue or 32% of
the Company’s overall revenue – a growth rate for Mainland China of 292% (year-over-year).
¶245. During the Class Period, Defendants even boasted that Nu Skin’s China business would
continue to grow to ultimately account for 50% or more of the Company’s overall revenue.
¶¶206, 246. In fact, Defendants projected Nu Skin’s business in China would contribute at least
$5 billion per year going forward. ¶¶206, 246. Based on these stated growth levels, Nu Skin’s
stock price nearly tripled from April 2013 to early January 2014. See Defs.’ Exh. CC.

3.

Defendants’ Massive Insider Trading and Substantially Increased
Compensation

As they were touting the Company’s performance and prospects while withholding the
real reasons for the tremendous growth in sales in Mainland China, the Individual Defendants
unloaded huge amounts of Nu Skin stock for more than $40 million in proceeds. ¶¶249-267.
Moreover, as detailed below and in the Complaint, the Individual Defendants’ stock sales were
far out of line with their prior trading practices. Id. In addition, the Individual Defendants
doubled their total compensation from the Company at a time when they knew that the
Company’s stock price was artificially inflated by the false statements they were making about
the reasons for the Company’s extraordinary growth in China. ¶¶268-271.
4.

The Corrective Disclosures
(a)

August 7, 2012 Citron Report

On August 7, 2012, Citron Research, an online stock commentary website published an
analyst report entitled, “The Two Faces of Nu Skin” (“Citron Report”). ¶141. The Citron
Report revealed new information about Nu Skin’s operations in China and included seven
transcripts of interviews conducted by undercover Citron researchers in Mainland China with Nu
Skin retail store employees and/or sales promoters and independent distributors. ¶¶141-142.
Citron reported that Nu Skin’s operations in China were based on illegal MLM or pyramid
selling schemes which included the payment of multi-level compensation, as well as improperly
requiring new distributors to make purchases of Nu Skin products in order to participate in sales
commissions or salary. ¶¶141-142. The Citron Report warned that investors were exposed to
the massive risk that Nu Skin China’s operations would come to an abrupt halt as a result of Nu
Skin’s violation of the PRC’s and Hong Kong’s anti-pyramid sales laws. ¶141, According to the
report: “The consequences would be devastating. What would the Company be worth without its

13

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 24 of 66

China operation?” Id. Upon release of the Citron Report, Nu Skin’s stock declined $4.50 per
share, or more than 9%, to close at $44.36 per share on August 7, 2012. ¶143.
Defendants responded to the Citron Report almost immediately, filing a Form 8-K
completely denying all of Citron’s claims and continuing to misrepresent the nature of Nu
Skin’s business in the PRC. ¶144. The Form 8-K, signed by Wood, stated the following:
We are confident that our China operations are in compliance
with applicable regulations as interpreted and enforced by the
government of China. Nu Skin has an eight-year history of doing
business in China under these regulations, and the government has
regularly reviewed our business activities. In the past year the
government has issued Nu Skin new direct selling licenses in
several cities and municipalities. (emphasis added).
Id. Defendants successfully convinced analysts and investors that the Citron Report was not
credible. Based on these additional misrepresentations denying the disclosures in the Citron
Report, Nu Skin’s stock rebounded while investors remained deceived. ¶148. For the next year
and a half, Defendants continued to tout the Company’s growth in the PRC, which, they claimed,
was achieved while operating in compliance with Chinese law.
(b)

People’s Daily Articles

Defendants’ scheme fell apart on January 15, 2014, before the U.S. markets opened,
when People’s Daily, a government-run Beijing-based newspaper, reported that Nu Skin was
operating an illegal pyramid scheme in China, selling unlicensed products via direct selling and
exaggerating the earnings opportunities for those who sold Nu Skin products. ¶211. Further, the
article stated that Nu Skin employed unlawful and immoral business practices in violation of
PRC law. Id.9

9

As a result of this news, on January 15, 2014, the Company’s stock lost 15.5% of its
value, declining $21.24 per share to close at $115.23 per share. ¶212.

14

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 25 of 66

The next day, on January 16, 2014, again before the U.S. markets opened, People’s Daily
published additional information concerning its investigative report of Nu Skin. ¶213. As part
of its investigation, a People’s Daily reporter recorded a portion of Nu Skin’s 2014 Awards
Ceremony held in Beijing on January 11, 2014 and recorded conversations with a few of the
20,000 Nu Skin sales representatives from China who attended the awards. These Nu Skin sales
representatives informed the People’s Daily reporter that Nu Skin’s bonus system paid
commissions from downline sales within six levels. ¶213. This is in direct contravention of
Chinese regulations prohibiting pyramid schemes. Id.
(c)

Announcement of Investigations by Chinese Government

That same day, on January 16, 2014, two Chinese government agencies - China’s State
Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) and the Ministry of Commerce
(“MOFCOM”) announced they were independently conducting investigations of Nu Skin’s
business in Mainland China to verify the claims in the People’s Daily articles. ¶¶214-215. In
response, on January 16, 2014, the Company issued a press release and Report on Form 8-K
disclosing that its business practices were under investigation by Chinese authorities. ¶216.10
(d)

Nu Skin’s January 21, 2014 Letter to its Customers

On January 21, 2014, Nu Skin filed a Report on Form 8-K releasing a letter to its
customers in China (in English and Mandarin) admitting to violations of Mainland China’s
regulations on direct selling. ¶219. The letter read, in part:
As part of our initial review, we were disappointed to learn that
during our recent rapid growth, there were instances where some

On this news, on January 16, 2014, the Company’s stock declined an additional $30.43
per share, or 26.2%, to close at $84.80 per share. ¶217. Shares of Nu Skin fell further on January
17, 2014, to close at $79.47 per share that day, a decline of 6.2%.¶218. Nu Skin’s stock currently
trades at under $50 per share.

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 26 of 66

of our sales people failed to adequately follow and enforce our
policies and regulations. We sincerely apologize for these
unfortunate and unauthorized activities. We are undertaking an
internal review of the practices of our employees and sales force,
and fully intend to take corrective actions.
* * *
We express our sincere apologies to the public for any impact that
this has caused, and we hope that the public and the media will
give us an opportunity to improve ourselves in order to reinforce
our policies and procedures, enhance a sound supervision system,
and enhance our commitment to excellent customer service.
¶219.11
Between January 15, 2014 and January 21, 2014, Nu Skin’s stock price plummeted over
43%. ¶16. Because of the disclosure of wrongdoing and a severe lack of internal controls to
prevent such wrongdoing and the resulting investigations by multiple agencies of the Chinese
government, ultimately, Nu Skin:
(i)

was fined by one branch of the Chinese government for violations of the
regulations on direct selling (¶17)12;

11

On this news, shares of Nu Skin fell an additional 2.62% on January 21, 2014 to close at
$77.39 per share. ¶220.
12

Based upon information and belief, at least one investigation by Chinese authorities
regarding Nu Skin’s business was ongoing as of June 2014. ¶¶17, 234. While offering a panoply
of new “facts” in their motion to dismiss, Defendants do not offer up a single new fact to dispute
this allegation. Defs. Br. at 25 n.11. Further, Nu Skin’s Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended March 31, 2014 (filed on May 8, 2014 and referred to at ¶238) reported that the Chinese
government continues to investigate the Company. In that report, the Company disclosed:
Our operations in Mainland China are subject to significant
government scrutiny, and we could be subject to fines or other
penalties. …..The government in Mainland China recently
announced that it would inspect the direct selling industry over
the next several months, which has and will increase regulatory
scrutiny of the industry and our business. (emphasis added).

was forced to retrain its sales representatives in China (Id.);

(iii)

was required to shutter certain “working studios” improperly used by the
Company’s sales representatives in China to recruit new distributors and direct
sellers (Id.);

(iv)

suspended all business promotional meetings until at least May 1, 2014 (which
the Company called a “voluntary” suspension taken in connection with multiple
government investigations) and then when corporate-sponsored promotional
meetings resumed they were only allowed to be conducted inside of Nu Skin’s
offices (¶221);

(v)

suspended all recruitment of new sales representatives in Mainland China until
May 1, 2014 (Id.); and

(vi)

extended Nu Skin’s product refund and return policies in China. (Id.).13

Post-Class Period Events

In the wake of the People’s Daily series of articles, other media sources in China have
reported that Nu Skin direct sellers had been encouraged during the Class Period to establish
downlines among family and friends in order to qualify for group bonus schemes in clear
violation of the rules against MLM and pyramid selling. ¶¶222-224. Analysts who covered Nu
Skin continue to significantly reduce their forecasts for the Company for 2014 and 2015. ¶¶225227.
On May 6, 2014, in connection with the release of the Company’s first quarter 2014
financial results, the Company reported overall growth well below Wall Street estimates and
( … continued)
Id., at p. 25. Despite submitting every Nu Skin quarterly and annual report filed with the SEC
during the Class Period (and at least seven SEC filings that predate the Class Period), Defendants
do not submit as an exhibit Nu Skin’s 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 even though it
is cited in the Complaint.
13

Based on Nu Skin’s Class Period actions, Plaintiff alleges that Nu Skin was forced to
curtail its business in Mainland China post-Class Period which ultimately led to, among other
things, decreased sales in China, a massive drop in Sales Leaders in China and ballooning
inventory. ¶¶221-240.

17

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 28 of 66

reported that the number of Sales Leaders in Mainland China had decreased significantly during
the first quarter of 2014, from approximately 49,000 as of December 31, 2013 to approximately
24,000 as of March 31, 2014. ¶¶235-238. In sum, as detailed in the Complaint, Defendants’
conduct in China during the Class Period continues to negatively affect Nu Skin’s revenues and
growth rate. Nu Skin’s stock currently trades below $50 per share, down from a Class Period
high of more than $138 per share.

12(b)(6), all factual allegations are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).
To survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain
sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,
570 (2007); See also Gee v. Pacheco, 627 F.3d 1178, 1184 (10th Cir. 2010). “A claim has facial
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.

Plaintiff Has Plausibly Alleged That Defendants Made Materially False and
Misleading Statements And Omissions

Statements and Omissions Alleged to Be False and Misleading

To state a valid Rule 10b–5 claim, a plaintiff must first plead that the defendant made an
untrue or misleading statement of material fact or failed to state a material fact necessary to make
a statement not misleading. Adams v. Kinder-Morgan, Inc., 340 F.3d 1083, 1099-1100 (10th Cir.
2003). A plaintiff must “specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the ...

reasons why the statement is misleading....” 15 U.S.C. § 78u–4(b)(1). See Adams, 340 F.3d at
1095; In re Zagg Sec. Litig., No. 12-cv-852, 2014 WL 505152, at *4 (D. Utah Feb. 7, 2014). “A
common-sense, case-by-case approach will edify any determination of whether the facts alleged
are sufficient under this standard, requiring courts to determine whether, taken as a whole, the
facts alleged support a reasonable belief that the defendant’s statements identified by the plaintiff
were false or misleading.” Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc. v. AE Biofuels, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 2d
1056, 1066 (D. Colo. 2009) (internal quotations and citation omitted); Nova Leasing, LLC v. Sun
River Energy, Inc., No. 11–cv–00689, 2012 WL 1110397, at *8 (D. Colo. Mar. 28, 2012).
Here, the Complaint identifies the specific false and misleading statements – which are
prominently displayed by the use of underlining or a specific mention of the false portion of the
statement (such as “SOX certification only”).14 The Complaint then explicitly connects the
allegedly false (underlined) statements to the factual allegations demonstrating their falsity.
Where appropriate, the Complaint groups the false statements together by fiscal quarter (with the
only exception being certain investor conferences and the Citron Report) and highlights the true
nature of the facts as known, but undisclosed, by Defendants.15 Plaintiff also alleges that
Defendants made omissions during the Class Period and that Defendants failed to disclose
information when they had a duty to do so.16

(a)

Confidential Witness Accounts and Internal Documents
Support the Falsity of Defendants’ Statements and Omissions
and Corroborate the Pervasiveness of Downlines and the
Payment of Improper Multi-level Compensation in Mainland
China

A court should give weight to statements of a confidential witness where those statements
are supported by detail “regarding the basis of the informant’s knowledge and the knowledge
itself.” In re Thornburg Mortg., Inc. Sec. Litig., 824 F. Supp. 2d 1214, 1226 n.11 (D.N.M.
2011). This is especially true where confidential witnesses corroborate each other. See In re
Daou Sys. Inc. Sec. Litig., 411 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir. 2005); In re Cabletron Sys., Inc., 311
F.3d 11, 29 (1st Cir. 2002). Here, the Complaint identifies the confidential witnesses, specifies
each witness’s affiliation with Nu Skin, title, position, geographic area of employment, length of
employment, and job responsibilities, all of which establish the basis of these witnesses’
knowledge. See, e.g., ¶¶60, 66-71, 75-78.
The first-hand corroborated accounts by confidential witnesses support Plaintiff’s
allegations that (1) direct sellers, sales representatives and distributors in China were paid
downline commissions based on their sales as well as sales of their recruited sales representatives
below them, in direct violation of Chinese rules prohibiting multi-level marketing (¶¶67, 70, 71,
75, 76, 78); (2) new sales representatives and direct sellers were receiving little, if any, training
in violation of Chinese regulations on direct selling (¶67); and (3) Nu Skin sales representatives
were making unlicensed, direct sales of products outside of Nu Skin’s brick and mortar stores in
China. ¶¶67, 68, 77.
Accordingly, “the allegations based on the statements of the CWs are entitled to
significant weight because the complaint describes the bases of the CWs’ knowledge, the
positions they held, their exposure to the relevant conduct, and the relevant time frame.”
Mishkin v. Zynex, Inc., No. 09-cv-00780, 2011 WL 1158715, at *7 (D. Colo. Mar. 30, 2011).
20

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 31 of 66

Defendants make several meritless arguments attempting to discredit the information provided
by the confidential witnesses. Defendants make these arguments in their “Scienter” section.
Defs. Br. at 48-52. However, the pervasiveness of the MLM activities and payment of multilevel compensation discussed at length by the confidential witnesses supports both falsity and
scienter and will be addressed here. See, e.g., Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d
981, 1000 (9th Cir. 2009) (allegations of falsity may be indicative of scienter); Scott v. ZST
Digital Networks, Inc., 896 F. Supp. 2d 877, 892 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (same).17
Defendants argue that confidential witnesses are generally unreliable and courts should
apply a “steep discount” to unnamed sources. Defs. Br. at 48-49. This is not the standard,
particularly, where, as here, the confidential witnesses are only cited for the detailed information
provided based on their own, personal experience. See In re Thornburg Mortg., 824 F. Supp. 2d
at 1226 n.11.18

17

Defendants rely on Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 995-96 (9th
Cir. 2009) for the proposition that the confidential witnesses were not positioned to know the
information alleged. Defs. Br. at 33 n.18. But in Zucco, unlike here, some of the witnesses were
not employed at the defendant company during the time period in question and only had
secondhand information about the accounting practices that were alleged to be fraudulent. Id. at
995-96. Moreover, in Zucco one of the witnesses was a human resources employee, who had no
knowledge of the workings of the finance or corporate departments at the defendant company.
This is in stark contrast to the confidential witnesses in the Complaint, who were sellers of Nu
Skin products employed during relevant periods and aware of the Company’s practices and the
manner in which they were compensated.
18

Defendants’ reliance on Kapur v. USANA Health Sciences, Inc.,No. 07-cv-00177, 2008
WL 2901705 (D. Utah July 23, 2008) is misplaced. Defs. Br. at 49-50. In Kapur, the court
refused to credit information provided by confidential witnesses because it was not based on
first-hand knowledge, but rather was overheard during a discussion among “other employees.”
The court also did not give weight to internal documents cited by confidential witnesses because
the contents of those internal reports was not provided or described. Here, all of the information
provided by confidential witnesses is based on first-hand knowledge and several of the internal
documents relied upon by Plaintiff are attached to the Complaint.

21

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 32 of 66

Defendants also argue that the confidential witnesses lack reliability because none of
them is alleged to be a Direct Seller and none reference Direct Seller compensation. Defs. Br. at
31 n.16, 32-33. However, none of the confidential witnesses had to be a Direct Seller to establish
the Company’s violations. Payment to any employee or direct seller in Mainland China of multilevel compensation violates the PRC regulations. ¶62. The majority of the confidential witnesses
corroborate that they were employees during the Class Period and they were paid multi-level
compensation or that they were part of and created downlines in the PRC (many of which were
unprofitable for the witnesses and which led to their short tenure). ¶¶60, 66-71, 74-78. While
certain PRC restrictions concerning training relate only to Direct Sellers (see ¶62), the ban on
multi-level compensation in the PRC is not restricted to Direct Sellers. ¶62.19
2.

Defendants’ Puzzle Pleading Argument Must be Rejected

Defendants’ argument that the Complaint amounts to impermissible “puzzle” pleading
must fail. Defs. Br. at 35. The Complaint is carefully organized; alleges each specific material
misstatement and related omission, including date and circumstances of its making and the
speaker or signatory thereof; and after each group of misstatements, provides the reasons why
those specific statements were materially false and/or misleading by omission when made.

19

Defendants’ suggestion that the Court’s sanction in In re BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc.
Securities Litigation, 851 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1313-14 (S.D. Fla. 2011), aff’d sub nom. Hubbard v.
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., 503 F. App’x 677 (11th Cir. 2012) is somehow applicable to the
facts of this case or to the credibility of the confidential witnesses in this case should be rejected
outright. In Bancorp, after full discovery, the court discredited one allegation of only one of the
six confidential witnesses based on the fact that the witness did not work in the division where
the alleged misconduct occurred, which the court found to undercut her credibility. Id. at 131314. Here, the majority of the confidential witnesses sold Nu Skin products in China and were
paid or promised improper multi-level compensation and were aware of the Company’s practices
related to such sales. The confidential witnesses who were not sales representatives or
distributors in China have downlines in China or worked at corporate headquarters in connection
with sales support for the creation of downlines.

22

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 33 of 66

Courts have repeatedly found this style of pleading permissible. See In re Williams Sec.
Litig., 339 F. Supp. 2d 1242, 1261 (N.D. Okla. 2003); In re Intuitive Surgical Sec. Litig., No. 13cv-01920, 2014 WL 4145447, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 21, 2014); In re Cornerstone Propane
Partners, L.P. Sec. Litig., 355 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1081 (N.D. Cal. 2005). In Intuitive Surgical,
faced with the same argument as Defendants make here, the Court stated:
[T]he breadth of the CAC alone does not create the type of
“puzzle-like” complaint that warrants dismissal. See In re
Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P., 355 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1081
(N.D.Cal.2005) (finding that puzzle-pleadings “abuse the
principles of Rule 8 not because they are not short” but because
they are not plain). Plaintiff here has precisely detailed each
problematic statement, alleged that each statement is false and
misleading, and alleged the reasons as to why each statement was
false or misleading. . . Plaintiff's CAC fulfills the purpose of Rule
8 by putting Defendants on notice of the true substance of the
claims against them. See Splash, 160 F. Supp. 2d at 1074.
2014 WL 4145447, at *5.
The Complaint’s allegations are sufficiently particularized to provide Defendants with
fair notice. Indeed, Defendants’ arguments demonstrate that they are not “puzzled” by the
Complaint’s pleading because Defendants are able to identify the false statements and attempt to
refute them through the own version of the facts. Nothing more is required.20
20

Defendants’ cited cases are inapposite. In In re Level 3 Communications, Inc. Securities.
Litigation, No. 09-cv-00200, 2010 WL 5129524, at * 9 (D. Colo. Dec. 10. 2010), aff’d, 667 F.3d
1331, 1344-45 (10th Cir. 2012), the district court complained of difficulty “teasing out which
specific statements are at issue” and then matching those misrepresentations with the
corresponding adverse facts. Id. at *9. Despite the district court’s disfavor with plaintiffs’
method of pleading in Level 3, it was nonetheless able to match the alleged false statements with
the alleged adverse facts and determine that no claim for relief had been stated under the
PSLRA. Id. Similarly, in Alizadeh v. Tellabs, Inc., No. 13-cv-537, 2014 WL 2726676, at *5
(N.D. Ill. June 16, 2014), the court found it difficult to connect the specific false or misleading
statements to the factual allegations demonstrating that they were false. Here, in contrast, the
“connector” paragraphs are the last paragraph in each applicable section and these paragraphs
either state the reasons why the statements are false and misleading or refer back to an earlier
paragraph where the adverse facts were listed.

Nu Skin’s Risk Disclosures Failed to Adequately Disclose that the
Company Was Already Engaged in Practices that Violated the PRC’s
Prohibition on the Payment of Multi-Level Compensation

Defendants next argue that their false and misleading statements are immunized by risk
disclosures in the Nu Skin’s SEC filings which supposedly warned that the Chinese government
could, in the future, find Nu Skin’s compensation structure in violation of the restrictions on
multi-level compensation in the PRC. Defs. Br. at 19-21, 30. Defendants also argue that Nu
Skin disclosed the information Plaintiff alleges was not disclosed - that the Company paid its
employees and direct sellers in Mainland China multi-level compensation in violation of the
PRC regulations. Defs. Br. at 30.
Defendants’ reliance on “risk disclosures” in Nu Skin’s SEC filings should be rejected
for the following reasons: 1) by affirmatively and repeatedly speaking about Nu Skin’s
compliance with the PRC regulations, Defendants had a duty to disclose the full truth about the
Company’s payment of multi-level compensation in the PRC; 2) to the extent Defendants are
advancing a “truth on the market” defense – such a fact-intensive defense is not appropriate on a
motion to dismiss and, in any event, Defendants fail to adequately disclose the truth; and 3) any
such risk warnings are insufficient to invoke the PSLRA’s safe harbor.
(a)

Defendants Had a Duty To Disclose that the Company was
Improperly Paying Multi-Level Compensation in the PRC

During the Class Period, Defendants made unequivocal statements about the Company’s
compliance with the PRC regulations. One example is: “We are confident that our China
operations are in compliance with applicable regulations as interpreted and enforced by the
government of China.” ¶144. See also ¶¶99, 150. To avoid being misleading, Defendants’
statements concerning Nu Skin’s compliance with the PRC regulations triggered a duty to
disclose that the Company was improperly paying multi-level compensation at the time. See

24

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 35 of 66

Grossman v. Novell, Inc., 120 F.3d 1112, 1125 (10th Cir. 1997) (“if a defendant makes a
statement on a particular issue, and that statement is false or later turns out to be false, the
defendant may be under a duty to correct any misleading impression left by the statement.”);
Karacand v. Edwards, 53 F. Supp. 2d 1236, 1243-44 (D. Utah 1999) (duty to disclose what was
“needed so that what was revealed would not be so incomplete as to mislead.”) (internal
quotations and citation omitted).21
Further, Nu Skin’s “risk disclosures” during the Class Period were neither accurate nor
complete. The cautionary language in Nu Skin’s SEC filings consisted only of general warnings
about the risks inherent to Nu Skin’s direct selling model as implemented in China and was not
“specifically tailored” to risks from Nu Skin’s active payment of downline commissions to its
sales representatives, distributors and direct sellers. Defendants’ failure to disclose they were
actively paying such multi-level commissions during the Class Period – a violation of Article
7(1) of the PRC’s Regulation on Prohibition of Pyramid Selling (¶62) - rendered their statements
about compliance with applicable regulations materially misleading, which was not cured by any
general cautionary or risk-disclosing language. See Merchant Capital, 483 F.3d at 768-69.
Moreover, the disclosure that in the PRC Nu Skin uses the sales productivity of
individuals whom a sales representative trains and supervises in establishing an employee’s
salary, (Defs. Br. at 31), was not an accurate description of how the Company’s sales
representatives, distributors, and direct sellers were compensated during the Class Period.
Confidential witnesses and internal documents confirm that direct sellers, sales representatives,

See also SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747, 770–71 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding
that a duty to disclose all material information relating to a particular subject arises by
voluntarily “touting” the subject to investors); City of Monroe Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Bridgestone
Corp., 399 F.3d 651, 673 (6th Cir. 2005) (person or corporation has a duty to disclose it, if it
renders a prior disclosure objectively inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading).

25

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 36 of 66

and distributors in Mainland China were paid downline commissions based on a set percentage
of the sales of the sales representatives below them who they recruited (up to six levels down).
¶¶60-78. Defendants had a duty to disclose that these downline commissions, strategically called
“team rewards” or “team awards” by Nu Skin, were prohibited by the Chinese regulations
prohibiting multi-level compensation. ¶¶71-72.22
There can be little doubt that Nu Skin’s payment of downline, multi-level compensation
in violation of the PRC regulations is exactly the type of information “a reasonable investor
would consider ... important in determining whether to buy or sell stock.” Grossman, 120 F.3d at
1119. See also In re Williams Sec. Litig., 339 F. Supp. 2d at 1263. Indeed, the materiality of this
information is readily established by the steep decline in Nu Skin’s stock price upon its
revelation to the market. ¶¶143, 146, 212, 217, 218, 220.
(b)

Any “Truth on the Market” Defense Cannot Insulate
Defendants’ Statements and Omissions

Defendants further argue that the so-called “truth-on-the-market” defense invalidates
Plaintiff’s claims because all information material to investors was publicly available. Defs. Br.
at 30. In essence, Defendants assert that their misrepresentations are immaterial because the
information that Nu Skin was paying multi-level compensation in violation of the PRC
regulations was already known to the market. Defendants’ argument here also fails.
Misrepresenting reality as a mere risk is deceptive: “to warn that the untoward may occur
when the event is contingent is prudent, to caution that it is only possible for the unfavorable
events to happen when they have already occurred is deceit.” FindWhat Investor Grp. v.
22

For the first time in their motion (and not in any of the SEC filings attached to the
motion), Defendants claim that the portion of its employees’ compensation in China based on
sales of an employee’s team members is “not a commission.” Defs. Br. at 187. This unsupported
statement should not be accepted by the Court.

26

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 37 of 66

FindWhat.com, 658 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir. 2011) (internal quotations and citation omitted);
Rubinstein v. Collins, 20 F.3d 160, 171 (5th Cir. 1994) (“inclusion of general cautionary
language regarding a prediction [does] not excuse the alleged failure to reveal known material,
adverse facts”); In re Williams Sec. Litig., 339 F. Supp. 2d 1206, 1233 (N.D. Okla. 2003)
(“WCG Subclass”) (same).
The disclosure of the mere possibility that the Chinese government “could” in the future
find Nu Skin’s compensation structure in the PRC in violation of the rules against multi-level
compensation fails to disclose that the Company’s structure for the payment of commissions to
downline sales employees and distributors was, at the time Nu Skin’s risk disclosures were
issued, specifically prohibited by the PRC regulations. Defs. Br. at 20-21. See Va. Bankshares,
Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1097 (1991) (holding that to cure a misstatement, the
purportedly true statement must “discredit the other one so obviously that the risk of real
deception drops to nil”).
Moreover, the so-called “truth-on-the-market” defense is intensely factual and not
appropriate for consideration on a motion to dismiss. See e.g., Ganino v. Citizens Utils. Co., 228
F.3d 154, 167 (2d Cir. 2000); In re Bank of Am. Corp. Sec. Derivative & ERISA Litig., 757 F.
Supp. 2d 260, 300–02 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); In re Thoratec Corp. Sec. Litig., No. 04-cv-03168, 2006
WL 1305226, at *10 (N.D. Cal. May 11, 2006).
(c)

The PSLRA’s Safe Harbor Does Not Apply

Defendants also argue that the complained of statements qualify for protection under the
PSLRA’s safe-harbor provision for forward-looking statements. Defs. Br. at 34 n.21. See 15

27

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 38 of 66

U.S.C. § 78u–5(c)(1)(A).23 However, Defendants’ statements about Nu Skin’s compliance with
the PRC regulations concern then-existing conditions and cannot be construed as protected
forward looking statements.24 See In re Gold Res. Corp. Sec. Litig., 957 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1294
(D. Colo. 2013) (“The distinction must be made between statements of future projections and
statements of current or historical fact, as the latter are not protected by the safe harbor.”).
Further, as discussed above, the risk disclosures Defendants point to in their SEC filings are
woefully inadequate given Defendants’ knowledge at the time.
4.

Defendants’ Introduction of Facts Not Pled in the Complaint Must Be
Rejected

As set forth in more detail in Lead Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike, filed concurrently
herewith, Defendants attempt to turn the motion to dismiss process on its head. Rather than
respond to the allegations of the Complaint, Defendants choose instead to advance a counternarrative of their version of the facts taken entirely from disputed sources outside the four
corners of the Complaint. Defs. Br. at 15-26. However, Defendants do not formally request that
the Court take judicial notice of any facts or contentions comprising their version of the facts – in

23

The Safe Harbor provides that a defendant shall not be liable for a forward-looking
statement if it “is identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful
cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statement.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u–5(c)(1)(A). As defined
in the statute, a “forward-looking statement” is a projection of financial items, a description of
management's plans and objectives for future operations or economic performance, or the stated
assumptions underlying these projections. 15 U.S.C. § 78u–5(i)(1). The Safe Harbor does not
apply to the extent a statement was made by a person or entity having actual knowledge that it
was false or misleading. 15 U.S.C. § 78u–5(c)(1)(B).
24

Defendants incredibly argue that their statements during the Class Period that Nu Skin’s
business practices in China were in compliance with the law were forward looking statements.
(Defs. Br. at 34 n.21).

28

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 39 of 66

essence conceding that none of the self-serving facts or information they rely upon to contradict
the allegations of the Complaint are appropriate for judicial notice pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201.
Defendants’ attempt to establish a competing universe of facts and inferences that are
inconsistent with or contradict the well-pled allegations of the Complaint, without permitting
Plaintiff the opportunity to examine or challenge such contentions through the crucible of
discovery is completely improper. Defendants’ tactic should be rejected and their contradictory
competing factual contentions and exhibits stricken or disregarded.
C.

The Complaint Adequately Pleads Scienter

“The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, i.e., of the
smoking-gun genre, or even the most plausible of competing inferences.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. at
324. (internal quotations and citation omitted). Indeed, “[f]aced with two seemingly equally
strong inferences, one favoring the plaintiff and one favoring the defendant, it is inappropriate”
for a court to “make a determination as to which inference will ultimately prevail” because that
would “invade the traditional role of the factfinder.” Pirraglia v. Novell, Inc., 339 F.3d 1182,
1188 (10th Cir. 2003).
1.

Courts Examine a Complaint’s Scienter Allegations Holistically

The Supreme Court set forth a three-step process for reviewing allegations of scienter on
a motion to dismiss under the PSLRA. Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 322-23. First, the facts alleged in
the complaint must be taken as true. Id. at 322. Second, those facts must be considered
holistically, rather than in isolation, to determine whether scienter has been properly pled, as the
proper inquiry “is whether all of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong
inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that
standard.” Id. at 322-23. See also id. at 326 (“assess all the allegations holistically”). Third, in
determining whether pleaded facts give rise to a “strong” inference of scienter, courts can take
29

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 40 of 66

into account plausible, nonculpable opposing inferences that arise from the allegations of the
Complaint. Id. at 317, 323. To qualify as strong, an inference of scienter “must be cogent and at
least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.” Id. at 314. The inference
of scienter need not be irrefutable; it must only be strong in light of other explanations. Id.;
Pirraglia, 339 F.3d at 1188.
Proof of recklessness is sufficient to establish scienter. See Weinstein v. McClendon, 757
F.3d 1110, 1114 (10th Cir. 2014). “[A] defendant acts recklessly when his or her conduct
amounts to an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and presents a danger of
misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the
defendant must have been aware of the danger.” In re Zagg Sec. Litig., 2014 WL 505152, at *5
(citing City of Phila. v. Fleming Cos., Inc., 264 F.3d 1245, 1260 (10th Cir. 2001)).
The Complaint is replete with facts, that when considered holistically, give rise to a
strong and compelling inference that Defendants acted with knowledge, or at a minimum, acted
recklessly with a motive to deceive, including allegations regarding:


Nu Skin’s otherwise unexplainable rapid expansion of its MLM
business in Mainland China (i.e., the sheer magnitude of the
fraud);



Hunt and Wood repeatedly spoke to the market about Nu Skin’s
business and growth in China;



Hunt and Wood’s knowledge of the Chinese law which pre-dates
the Class Period;



Hunt and Wood’s frequent business trips to China on Nu Skin’s
behalf;



Nu Skin’s corporate office in Utah had access to sales by all
distributors, sales representatives and direct sellers in Mainland
China through a linked computer system;



Defendants’ affirmative statements discrediting the Citron Report;

30

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 41 of 66



confidential witness accounts and internal Company documents;



the importance of China’s growth to the Company’s future,
rendering it a core operation of the Company during the Class
Period; and



Hunt and Wood’s motive to deceive including massive insider
trading and substantially increased compensation during the Class
Period.

A reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter as to Hunt and Wood cogent
and “at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.”

(a)

Nu Skin’s Rapid Expansion of its MLM Business in Mainland
China Supports an Inference of Scienter

Prior to the start of the Class Period, growth in Nu Skin’s business in Japan and the
United States was on the decline. ¶¶55-57. To offset the slowdown in growth in these markets,
the Company focused on growing its business in the PRC despite the stringent regulations in
China prohibiting the very type of MLM and multi-level compensation employed by Nu Skin in
all of its other markets and despite the limited success Nu Skin had achieved in penetrating the
Chinese market as a result of those stringent regulations prior to the Class Period. ¶4.
In early 2011, Defendants began encouraging Nu Skin’s existing sales distributors around
the world, including its Chinese-speaking distributors in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast
Asia, to recruit sales promoters and distributors in Mainland China in much the same way they
recruited distributors around the rest of the world. ¶5. This included signing up sales distributors
in Mainland China, paying them commissions and requiring the new recruits to sell specified
minimum monthly sales levels of Nu Skin products while promising to reward them handsomely
for recruiting additional new downline sales distributors from whom they could share
commissions. Id.

31

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 42 of 66

Defendants’ rapid-fire growth scheme worked. Throughout the Class Period, Nu Skin
posted astounding double and triple digit growth in Mainland China. See e.g., ¶245. See also
Defendants’ Exhibits A (pg. 56), B (pg. 50), C (pg. 56).

This explosion in reported revenues in the PRC was only possible through MLM, vast networks
of downlines, and poorly trained sales representatives who sold products not authorized for direct
sales in Mainland China. ¶9.25 In light of the Company’s past violations of PRC multi-level
marketing restrictions (¶52), at the very least, this rapid growth should have raised a red flag for
Defendants.
(b)

That Hunt and Wood Repeatedly Spoke to the Market about
Nu Skin’s Business and Growth in China Supports an
Inference of Scienter

During the Class Period, the Individual Defendants participated in quarterly and annual
earnings conference calls.26 During these calls, Wood and Hunt spoke at length about and
answered questions about Nu’s Skin’s business in China. Id. For example, during the Class
Period, Hunt and Wood made the following statements about Nu Skin’s business in China:
25

Defendants also knowingly or recklessly failed to put in place a system of internal
controls that would have ensured that new sales representatives and direct sellers were trained in
a way that complied with Chinese law. ¶¶8, 92(c), 152(c). The training that did exist was lax and
inconsistent and not at all enforced – another violation of China’s regulations on direct
selling. ¶¶8, 62, 67-70, 92(c), 152(c). This too supports an inference of scienter.
26

▪Hunt: “[M]ainland China continued to grow at a rate of about
50%, year-over-year.” ¶94.
▪Wood: “As we continue to grow, China will just become more
and more profitable.” ¶95.
▪Hunt: “First, nearly 70% revenue growth in Mainland China is
making China a much more relevant factor in our overall results.
Our business there is obviously trending very strongly. . . . So we
continue to believe that China is enjoying very healthy momentum
and has a real likelihood to becoming our largest market within a
fairly short period of time.” ¶103.
▪Hunt: “And they are just -- they happen to be sitting on the
biggest direct selling opportunity in the history of the world. There
just aren't any other markets like it, with direct selling being as
robust as it within the Chinese communities globally and . . . It
just happens to be a phenomenal market in terms of size and
scale.” Id.
▪Wood: “it’s highly likely that China surpasses Korea next year as
the second largest business in our world, and by 2015, could likely
be the largest market in the Nu Skin world.” ¶134.
▪Hunt: “We are confident in the long-term growth potential of
Mainland China and believe we have the knowledge and resources
to capitalize on the opportunity.” ¶165.
▪Hunt: “Sales in the second quarter in mainland China were $198
million. . . .We continue to invest to sustain growth in this market
and are committed to working to ensure our long-term success
there. From what we are seeing we believe that the market
continues to have significant upside potential.” ¶190.
In addition, Hunt and Wood signed Nu Skin’s SEC filings during the Class Period which
reported on, among other things, the Company’s business and the growth in sales in Mainland
China.27

Hunt and Wood’s Knowledge of the Chinese Regulations
(Which Pre-Dated the Class Period) Supports an Inference of
Scienter

Nu Skin has been operating in China since the early 1990s. ¶46. From 2003 to 2005, Nu
Skin sold product in Mainland China only through retail outlets. ¶49. In 2006, shortly after the
PRC implemented regulations concerning direct selling and anti-pyramid-selling, Nu Skin began
its direct selling operations. ¶51. Shortly before the beginning of the Class Period, Defendant
Hunt and representatives from Nu Skin China met with high level Chinese government officials
who reiterated that the Chinese government would thoroughly implement the Administrative
Regulations on Direct-Selling and the Regulations on Prohibiting Pyramid-Selling. ¶80. Thus,
Hunt and Wood were familiar with the Chinese regulations well before the Class Period.
During the Class Period, Defendants discussed Nu Skin’s compliance with the Chinese
regulations governing direct selling and anti-pyramid selling. See e.g., ¶¶7, 99, 118, 144, 150,
151, 165, 204. Through these statements, Defendants demonstrated their knowledge of the PRC
regulations. For example, when the Citron Report was released raising concerns that Nu Skin
was operating a pyramid scheme in China, Defendants affirmatively and unequivocally denied
all of Citron’s claims and continued to misrepresent the nature of Nu Skin’s business in the PRC.
¶¶144, 145, 150, 151. In a Report on Form 8-K, signed by Defendant Wood, Nu Skin stated the
following with respect to its compliance with the laws in the PRC:
We are confident that our China operations are in compliance with
applicable regulations as interpreted and enforced by the
government of China. Nu Skin has an eight-year history of doing
business in China under these regulations, and the government
has regularly reviewed our business activities. In the past year the
government has issued Nu Skin new direct selling licenses in
several cities and municipalities. (emphasis added).
¶144. Indeed, Defendants successfully convinced analysts and investors that the Citron Report
was not credible. ¶145.
34

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 45 of 66

On August 16, 2012, Defendant Wood presented at the Canaccord Genuity 32nd Annual
Growth Conference in Boston. ¶150. According to an analyst report following Wood’s
presentation: “Nu Skin CFO Ritch Wood spent much of the presentation detailing Nu Skin’s
Chinese operations. In sum, Nu Skin has been operating in mainland China for roughly 10
years, first as a retailer then subsequently as a direct seller. The company notes being fully
regulatory compliant, and has safeguards in place similar to those in all of its other global
markets.” ¶151 (emphasis added). For the next year and a half, Defendants continued to tout the
Company’s growth in the PRC, which, they claimed, was achieved while operating in
compliance with Chinese law. ¶13.28
(d)

Hunt and Wood’s Frequent Business Trips to China on Nu
Skin’s Behalf Supports an Inference of Scienter

Hunt and Wood traveled frequently to Mainland China for conventions and sales
meetings and were acutely aware of Nu Skin’s operations in Mainland China. ¶¶79-81. The
Individual Defendants also participated in meetings with government regulatory representatives
in China including one meeting shortly before the beginning of the Class Period where defendant
Hunt met with Wang Chao, China’s Vice-Minister of Ministry of Commerce. ¶80.
(e)

Nu Skin’s Corporate Office in Utah Having Access to Sales by
All Distributors, Sales Representatives and Direct Sellers in
Mainland China Through a Linked Computer System
Supports an Inference of Scienter

Nu Skin’s corporate office in Utah had access to sales by all distributors, sales
representatives and direct sellers in Mainland China through a linked computer system. ¶77.
28

See Reese v. Malone, 747 F.3d 557, 580 (9th Cir. 2014) (court found that magnitude of
the violation, public attention on the Company, and contemporaneous documents demonstrating
management’s awareness of the company’s non-compliance, made it “absurd” to suggest that
management was not aware of BP’s significant, existing compliance issues that rendered their
statements misleading).

35

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 46 of 66

According to CW9, a Nu Skin Independent Distributor since 2010, Nu Skin’s corporate office in
Utah can “see every sale that is going on by every distributor” in China through Nu Skin’s
computer systems. ¶77.29 CW7, a former Sales Support Representative at Nu Skin who assisted
distributors in Nu Skin’s call center in Provo, Utah, corroborated that call center representatives
in Utah set up downlines for sales representatives and distributors in Mainland China in the same
way that they set up downlines for representatives and distributors in the U.S. and Japan. ¶75.
(f)

Defendants’ Affirmative Statements Discrediting the Citron
Report Support an Inference of Scienter

Defendants’ vehement denials of the information disclosed in the Citron Report (¶¶144,
150, 151) and affirmative statements to the contrary also support a strong inference of scienter.
Allegations that defendants took affirmative steps to discredit specific, objective public
allegations regarding the Company weigh in favor of a finding of scienter. See Matrixx
Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 131 S. Ct. 1309, 1324 & n.15 (2011) (describing the misleading
press release as the “[m]ost significant[ ]” fact in favor of a finding of scienter).30 Moreover,
Defendants tacitly admit they knew the truth by arguing that the truth was already in the market
by reason of a public disclosure. Defs. Br. at 30-31.

29

Even though based in the U.S., CW9 was familiar with Nu Skin’s operations in China
because in 2011 he took a trip to China in an attempt to recruit Nu Skin sales representatives for
his downline. ¶77. CW9 no longer actively recruits for Nu Skin, but at the height of his
relationship with Nu Skin, CW9 had more than 250 people in his downline. CW9 also stated that
all of the Chinese downlines reported to sales executives in the U.S. ¶77.
30

See also Reese, 747 F.3d at 572 (court found that defendant “bridge[d] the [scienter] gap”
by making a detailed factual statement contradicting important data to which defendant had
access, creating a strong inference that the defendant knowingly misled the public) (alteration in
original).

Confidential Witness Accounts and Internal Company
Documents Support an Inference of Scienter

The Complaint’s numerous first-hand accounts, provided by confidential witnesses who
worked in various positions at different geographical locations at the Company, support both a
finding of falsity (see discussion infra) and scienter. Courts in this Circuit have found that
allegations from confidential witnesses can support a finding of scienter. See, e.g., Better & YRC
Investors Grp. v. YRC Worldwide Inc., No. 11-cv-2072, 2012 WL 4433500, at *10-11 (D. Kan.
Sept. 25, 2012) (court considered confidential witness accounts which corroborated defendants’
knowledge or reckless disregard of concealed facts); In re SemGroup Energy Partners, L.P. Sec.
Litig., 729 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1290 n.1 (N.D. Okla. 2010); Mishkin, 2011 WL 1158715, at *6.
Indeed, an allegation of “falsity may itself be indicative of scienter where it is combined
with allegations regarding a management’s role in the company that are particular and suggest
that the defendant had actual access to the disputed information, and where the nature of the
relevant fact is of such prominence that it would be absurd to suggest that management was
without knowledge of the matter.” Zucco Partners, 552 F.3d at 1000 (internal quotations
omitted); see also Scott, 896 F. Supp. 2d at 892.
Here, multiple witnesses’ consistent accounts strengthen the inference of scienter. See In
re Daou Sys. Inc., 411 F.3d at 1015; In re Cabletron Sys., Inc., 311 F.3d at 29. For example,
CW2, a former Nu Skin Sales Manager in Beijing, CW4, a former Sales Representative from
Guangzhou, CW5, a former Sales Representative in Nanjing, and CW10, a former Sales
Representative in Shanghai all based in Mainland China – corroborate the existence of downlines
in China. ¶¶67-70. Moreover, the confidential witnesses based in the U.S. corroborated the
accounts of the witnesses based in China. ¶¶60, 75, 76. Thus, the corroborative confidential

37

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 48 of 66

witness accounts along with internal Company documents also support a strong inference of
scienter.
(h)

The Allegations of Core Operations Support an Inference of
Scienter

Following Tellabs, Courts have upheld a strong inference of scienter where the fraud
involved a company’s core operations—as is the case here. The Second, Third, Seventh, and
Ninth Circuits have recognized that allegations of fraud arising from a company’s core
operations can support an inference of scienter. As the Seventh Circuit reasoned in Makor Issues
& Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs Inc., (“Tellabs II”), it would be “exceedingly unlikely” for a CEO to be
unaware of problems affecting the company’s major products. 513 F.3d 702, 711 (7th Cir.
2008).31
As set forth above, during the Class Period, Nu Skin became increasingly dependent on
Mainland China for a disproportionate share of its gross revenues and all of its growth. In 2010,
revenues from Mainland China were $91.4 million representing 6% of Nu Skin’s overall
revenue. By the end of 2013, those numbers skyrocketed – to over $1 billion in revenue
representing 32% of the Company’s overall revenue – a growth rate for Mainland China of 292%
(year-over-year). ¶245.

31

In South Ferry LP v. Killinger, the Ninth Circuit concluded that “[a]llegations that rely on
the core-operations inference are among the allegations that may be considered in the complete
PSLRA analysis.” 542 F.3d 776, 784-85 (9th Cir. 2008). The Third Circuit in Institutional
Investors Group v. Avaya, Inc., referring to the “core business inference,” 564 F.3d 242, 268 (3d
Cir. 2009), specifically recognized that the “perceived importance of margins supports an
inference that [Avaya’s CFO] was paying close attention to these numbers.” Id. at 271. See also
New Orleans Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Celestica, Inc., 455 F. App’x 10, 14 n.3 (2d Cir. 2011)
(allegations of a company’s core operations, “can provide supplemental support for allegations
of scienter, even if they cannot establish scienter independently. That view finds support in
decisions by this court and district courts within this circuit.”).

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 49 of 66

The Chinese market was of critical importance to Nu Skin’s growth during the Class
Period as growth in Nu Skin’s other important regions such as the U.S. and Japan was faltering.
¶¶54, 55, 246. Defendants repeatedly touted the growing market in Mainland China as the
driving force behind the Company’s current and future growth. For example:


At the start of the Class Period, Wood commented that Nu Skin
was fortunate that emerging markets such as China have “more
than made up” for declines in Japan and the U.S. ¶¶87, 246.



At the start of the Class Period, Hunt highlighted the “encouraging
trends” Nu Skin was seeing in “emerging markets” such as
Mainland China: “we believe that these emerging markets could
easily represent half of our business or more by 2015.” ¶84.
Defendant Wood echoed the sentiment: “I would expect greater
China . . . to become a more and more key player to our overall
business.” ¶85.



Hunt: “I would point out how quickly emerging markets are
becoming a larger component of our revenue mix. The greater
China region obviously knocked the cover off the ball with 150%
growth in the second quarter.” ¶133.



Wood stated that Nu Skin expected its emerging markets to
account for 40 percent of its projected 2015 revenue, “with
tremendous opportunity in Mainland China and Southeast Asia.”
¶150.



Hunt boasted that Nu Skin’s China business would continue to
grow to ultimately account for 50% or more of the Company’s
overall revenue. ¶¶206, 246. (“So, as we stretch towards our $10
billion sales target, it won’t be at all surprising if China is 50% or
more of that.” ¶206.);



Dan Chard, Nu Skin’s President of Global Sales & Operations:
“So, it takes us to Greater -- to Mainland China. This is now our
largest market and our fastest growing market and we believe that
it represents a significant opportunity for us to expand and grow
our business.” ¶208.

Analysts who covered Nu Skin echoed the Company’s statements regarding Mainland China
being a core market for Nu Skin. See, e.g. ¶100 ("However, NUS’s emerging markets business is
on a strong trajectory, especially in China. . .”). Given the exponentially growing size of Nu

39

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 50 of 66

Skin’s Chinese market, its critical importance to the growth of Nu Skin’s overall business, and
its potential to become the Company’s revenue life-blood, the illegal practices implemented by
Defendants for deployment in China could not have occurred without the Individual Defendants’
knowledge and approval. ¶248.
Even cases relied on by Defendants concede that: ‘“[a]llegations that rely on the coreoperations inference are among the allegations that may be considered in the complete PSLRA
analysis’, in accordance with the holistic approach outlined in Tellabs.” Prissert v. EMCORE
Corp., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1372-73 (D.N.M. 2012) (Defs. Br. at 40) (emphasis added).32
(i)

Allegations of Hunt and Wood’s Motive, Including Massive
Insider Trading and Substantially Increased Compensation
During the Class Period, Support an Inference of Scienter

Plaintiff analyzed the trading by the Individual Defendants that occurred during the Class
Period (989 days) and during the period immediately preceding the Class Period beginning
August 17, 2008 and ending May 3, 2011 - also 989 days (the “Control Period”). The massive
insider trading by Hunt and Wood during the Class Period, compared to much smaller pre-Class
Period insider sales, together with allegations of increased compensation, further supports a

32

The Court in Board of Trustees of the City of Ft. Lauderdale General Employees’
Retirement Systems v. Mechel Oao, 811 F. Supp. 2d 853 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (Defs. Br. at 38) held
that the allegations of core operations, by themselves, in that case, were not independently
sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter. Although Plaintiff does not rely on the
allegations of core operations alone to support a strong inference of scienter, here the pervasive
nature of the improper conduct in China and the astronomical growth in revenue in China during
the Class Period “of such prominence that it would be ‘absurd’ to suggest that management was
without knowledge of the matter.” South Ferry LP, 542 F.3d at 786. Further, Yates v. Mun.
Mortg. & Equity, LLC, 744 F.3d 874, 889 (4th Cir. 2014) (Defs. Br. at 41) is also
distinguishable. In that case, the alleged accounting error concerned only a small percentage of
the Company’s shareholder equity and only one of the defendants’ funds. Here, Mainland China
was Nu Skin’s growth engine – its main driver of revenue growth – with 2013 revenues from
Mainland China surpassing 30% of Nu Skin’s total revenues - and projections that it could reach
$ 5 billion by 2015.

40

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 51 of 66

strong inference of scienter. See Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 325 (acknowledging that motive can be a
relevant consideration in the scienter analysis).
(i)

The Individual Defendants’ Class Period Insider Sales
Were Inconsistent With Their Prior Trading

The Individual Defendants’ Class Period stock sales exceed $40 million compared to
Control Period stock sales of $15.6 million – an increase of more than 150%. ¶250. 33 Hunt’s
sales during the Class Period totaled $16.17 million versus $10.74 million during the Control
Period. ¶254. Wood’s sales during the Class Period totaled $24.53 million versus $4.85 million
during the Control Period – an increase of more than 500%. ¶255. Class Period insider sales
which are inconsistent with prior trading practices support an inference of scienter. See In re
Nature’s Sunshine Prods. Sec. Litig., 486 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1311 (D. Utah 2007) (a strong
inference of scienter may be shown from insider trades at times and in quantities that were
suspicious in light of the insider’s total stock holdings).34
(ii)

Trading Pursuant to 10b5-1 Trading Plans Does Not
Negate the Inference of Scienter

While a large percentage of Defendant Hunt and Wood’s stock sales appear to have been
made pursuant to 10b5-1 trading plans, in each case the circumstances of those sales are

33

The Complaint also details Hunt and Wood’s stock and option awards during the Class
Period. ¶270.
34

In re Level 3 Commc’ns, Inc. Sec. Litig., 667 F.3d at 1346 (Defs. Br. at 42) is
distinguishable because in that case the individual defendants held (as opposed to sold) a
substantial percentage of their Level 3 holdings. Here, the Individual Defendants sold much
more stock than they retained. According to Defendants’ Form 4 summaries, Defendants sold
between 60-90% of their Nu Skin holdings during the Class Period. See Defs. Ex. BB. Elam v.
Neidorff, 544 F.3d 921, 928 (8th Cir. 2008) is distinguishable because in that case, the “stock
sales at issue represent only a small portion of each seller’s overall holdings” (5.3% and 2.4%),
id. at 928, much less than the 60% and 90%, sold by Hunt and Wood, respectively. Defs. Ex. BB.

41

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 52 of 66

sufficiently suspicious to overwhelm any inference that they were made in good faith.35 Sales
pursuant to a trading plan should occur with a prescribed, regular pattern or be made at regular
intervals, for example, 500 shares a month on the 10th day of the month. Such was not the case
here. The Individual Defendants sold irregular amounts of shares at irregular intervals under their
10b5-1 plans. ¶262. For example, neither Hunt nor Wood sold on a monthly or bi-monthly basis
or sold a set number of shares with any particular frequency. ¶253.
Further, although Hunt and Wood filed reports on SEC Form 4’s disclosing their trades
and indicating that certain of them were made pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, no further information
is available on the 10b5-1 plans, either in the Individual Defendant’s Form 4’s or in
Defendants’ motion to dismiss, such as when the plans were adopted and if they were
amended during the Class Period.36 Without discovery, investors cannot understand the details
pertaining to the plans’ creation and amendments, whether any trades pursuant to the plans were
canceled, or what criteria, such as share price, may have triggered sales pursuant to the plans.37

35

The SEC created an affirmative defense to insider trading claims for trades made
pursuant to a binding agreement or plan (“10b5-1 plans”) only if the plan is entered into by an
insider “[b]efore becoming aware” of inside information, and was established “in good faith and
not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions” against insider trading. 17 C.F.R. §
240.10b5-1(c).
36

Trading plans are not a cognizable defense to scienter allegations on a motion to dismiss
where they were adopted or amended during the class period. See Cent. Laborers’ Pension Fund
v. Integrated Elec. Servs. Inc., 497 F.3d 546, 554 (5th Cir. 2007); George v. China Auto. Sys.,
Inc., No. 11-cv-7533(KBF), 2012 WL 3205062, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2012); In re Biogen
Idec, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 05-cv-10400, 2008 WL 4810045, at *14 (D. Mass. Oct. 25, 2008); see
also In re Questcor Sec. Litig., No. 12-cv-01623, 2013 WL 5486762, at *16 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 1,
2013) (10b5-1 trading plan created near the beginning of the class period did not negate the
suspicious nature of the defendant’s stock sales).

Further, whether Defendants’ trading plans were legitimately adopted or were put in
place after learning of material, nonpublic information cannot be resolved on a motion to
dismiss. See, e.g., In re UTStarcom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d 964, 976 n.16 (N.D. Cal.
2009) (“The Court finds that, although evidence of the nondiscretionary nature of Defendants’

(iii)

The Substantial Increase in the Individual Defendants’
Compensation During the Class Period Supports an
Inference of Scienter

During the Class Period, the Individual Defendants’ total compensation from Nu Skin
rose dramatically. Hunt’s total compensation from 2011 to 2013 nearly doubled from $5 million
to almost $10 million. ¶¶269-270. Wood’s total compensation from 2011 to 2013 more than
doubled rising from $1.56 million in 2011 to $4.14 million in 2013. Id. While not an independent
basis to support scienter, together with all of the other indicia of scienter explained above, the
Court should consider the Individual Defendants’ desire to increase their compensation as
additional evidence of Defendants’ motive. See In re Thornburg Mortg., 824 F. Supp. 2d at
1243 (court should consider allegations of motive).38
D.

The Complaint Adequately Alleges Loss Causation
1.

Defendants Ignore the Standards for Pleading Loss Causation in the
Tenth Circuit

Loss causation is subject only to the notice pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P.
8(a)(2). See e.g., YRC Worldwide Inc., 2012 WL 4433500, at *9. To adequately plead loss

( … continued)
sales may ultimately provide the basis of an affirmative defense at a later stage of the litigation, it
suffices that, at the pleading stage, Plaintiffs have alleged significant and suspiciously timed
securities sales.”); In re ArthroCare Corp. Sec. Litig., 726 F. Supp. 2d 696, 722 (W.D. Tex.
2010) (“the existence of such a plan is an affirmative defense, which requires evidence of the
plan itself and of details such as the date the plan was entered into and whether it wholly
removed trades from the defendant’s discretion.”); In re EVCI Colls. Holding Corp. Sec. Litig.,
469 F. Supp. 2d 88, 100 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (same).
38

In this Circuit, the scienter of “senior controlling officers of a corporation may be
attributed to the corporation itself to establish liability as a primary violator of § 10(b) and Rule
10b–5 when those senior officials were acting within the scope of their apparent authority.” See
Adams, 340 F.3d at 1106-07 (citing Suez Equity Investors, L.P. v. Toronto Dominion Bank, 250
F.3d 87, 100–01 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that the scienter of an agent of a corporate defendant is
attributable to the corporation as a primary violator of § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5)).

43

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 54 of 66

causation in the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff must “identify a ‘causal connection’ between the loss
and the misrepresentation.” In re Williams Sec. Litig.-WCG Subclass, 558 F.3d 1130, 1136-37
(10th Cir. 2009).
Although “[l]oss causation is easiest to show when a corrective disclosure reveals the
fraud to the public and the price subsequently drops,” this is not “the only or even the preferred
method of showing loss causation.” Id. at 1137. For instance, a plaintiff can plead loss
causation by alleging “a leakage theory that posits a gradual exposure of the fraud rather than a
full and immediate disclosure.” Id. at 1138. For any loss causation theory, the key inquiry is
whether a plaintiff has shown “some mechanism for how the truth was revealed.” Id. Although
a corrective disclosure must somehow “relate back” to the misrepresentation, a “disclosure need
not precisely mirror the earlier misrepresentation” to be corrective. Id. at 1140; see also
Nakkhumpun v. Taylor, No. 12-cv-01038, 2013 WL 5446081, at *14 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2013).
Remarkably, Defendants fail to pay even lip service to Tenth Circuit standards for
pleading loss causation. While Defendants’ loss causation section relies heavily on Eleventh
Circuit authority, it does not cite any decisions within this Circuit. This is because the decisions
in this Circuit establish pleading standards that are not favorable to Defendants’ arguments.
(a)

The Complaint Alleges a Series of Corrective Disclosures that
Demonstrate How the Truth about Nu Skin Was Revealed

The Complaint alleges that the truth about Defendants’ misrepresentations gradually
leaked into the market in a series of corrective disclosures, each of which is addressed below.
(i)

August 7, 2012, Citron Report

The Complaint alleges that the Citron Report was a partial corrective disclosure. ¶¶13,
141-143, 286. Defendants’ sole argument regarding the Citron Report is to baldly assert that
media allegations of fraudulent conduct cannot constitute a corrective disclosure. Defs. Br. at

44

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 55 of 66

55. Defendants are wrong. There is no rule that a short-seller report cannot support loss
causation, especially where it reveals new, nonpublic information and is accompanied by a stock
drop. See, e.g., Snellink v. Gulf Res., Inc., 870 F. Supp. 2d 930, 942 (C.D. Cal. 2012). Moreover,
subsequent revelations confirm the corrective nature of the Citron Report disclosures.
Defendants cannot dispute that the Citron Report revealed new, nonpublic information
about Nu Skin - namely, specific facts uncovered during an in-depth investigation including
taped and transcribed conversations with Nu Skin sales representatives and direct sellers in
Mainland China. ¶¶141-142. This specific information partially revealed the risk that the
Company’s Chinese operations were based on illegal multi-level marketing or pyramid selling.
Defendants also cannot seriously dispute that disclosures in the Citron Report related back to
Defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and that Nu Skin’s stock price dropped 14.12% on
August 7-8, 2012, following the Citron Report’s publication. ¶286(a).
The revelations in the Citron Report were partially counteracted by public statements
made by both Nu Skin and analysts disputing the Citron Report, including a television
appearance by a Deutsche Bank analyst during which he defended the Company. ¶¶144-147. As
a result, Nu Skin’s stock partially—but not fully—rebounded, with its price rising 6.24% on
August 9, 2012 and the market continued to be misled by Defendants. ¶148.
(ii)

January 15-16, 2014 People’s Daily Articles

Before the market opened on January 15, 2014, the Chinese government-run newspaper
People’s Daily reported that, based on its own investigation, Nu Skin was operating an illegal
pyramid scheme China, causing the Company’s stock to lose 15.5% of its value on that day.
¶¶211-12. Before the market opened on January 16, 2014, People’s Daily published additional
details about its investigation, further bolstering its conclusion that Nu Skin was operating an
illegal pyramid scheme, which, along with the announcement of government investigations
45

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 56 of 66

discussed below, caused the Company’s stock price to fall an additional 26.2% on that day.
¶¶213, 217.
The publication of a news article can constitute a corrective disclosure, e.g., In re Enron
Corp. Sec., Derivative & “ERISA” Litig., No. MDL-1446, 2005 WL 3504860, at *16 (S.D. Tex.
Dec. 22, 2005). As Defendants’ own cited authority holds, a third-party source can support loss
causation if it discloses new information. See Meyer v. Greene, 710 F.3d 1189, 1198 (11th Cir.
2013) (Defs. Br. at 53-54). Defendants do not dispute that the People’s Daily articles reveal
information related to their alleged misrepresentations and were accompanied by stock drops.
Instead, Defendants contest these corrective disclosures on the basis that the articles: (i) merely
“repackaged” facts in the Citron Report (Defs. Br. at 53-55); and (ii) report only “suspected”
unlawful conduct (Defs. Br. at 55-57). These arguments are misplaced.
Even a cursory review of the two People’s Daily articles shows that, contrary to
Defendants’ assertions, both articles revealed new information about Nu Skin’s practices in
Mainland China based on the People’s Daily’s own independent investigation – which included
new interviews with Nu Skin Sales Representatives and distributors. ¶¶211, 213.39 Not only did
the People’s Daily articles report on employee interviews and Nu Skin sales and promotional
conferences that occurred less than one week before the articles’ publication, the articles also
reported on readers’ submissions to the paper, Nu Skin training videos in which Nu Skin
distributors were interviewed, and interviews of legal experts. See Complaint at Exs. E & F. The
nonpublic, independently-obtained information in the People’s Daily articles (which had not
been previously disclosed) make them readily distinguishable from the public information held
39

Translations of the People’s Daily articles are attached to the Complaint as Exhibits E
and F. (ECF No. 51).

46

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 57 of 66

to be insufficient in Meyer. See 710 F.3d at 1198 (rejecting the corrective nature of a slide show
presentation stating that the information therein was “obtained from publicly available sources”)
(internal quotations omitted).
That the People’s Daily investigation unearthed facts similar to those disclosed by the
Citron Report does not render such facts stale or repackaged. The People’s Daily articles were
published almost a year-and-a-half after the Citron Report and were based on the People’s
Daily’s own independent investigation and included information not even in existence at the time
of the Citron Report. ¶¶211, 213.
In Scott v. ZST Digital Networks, Inc., No. 11-cv-03531, 2012 WL 538279 (C.D. Cal.
Feb. 14, 2012), the court rejected the same argument made by Defendants, holding that:
[The] citation to a previous article containing allegations of
wrongful behavior at the [c]ompany cannot overcome the
Plaintiff’s pleading of loss causation. Plaintiff alleges that [the
company’s] stock price fell precipitously” on the date the second
article was published, and accordingly the plaintiff had given the
defendants “more than ‘some indication’ as to the causal
mechanism which is alleged to connect the purported revelation
and the drop in the Company’s share price.
Id. at *11.
Defendants further argue to be corrective, the articles must have “prov[en] widespread
misconduct” and “substantiate[d] [the newspaper’s] suspicions in all relevant respects.” Defs.
Br. at 56-57 (emphasis added). Such an extreme pleading requirement for loss causation is
wholly inconsistent with the case law in the Tenth Circuit. See Nakkhumpun, 2013 WL
5446081, at *14 (holding that “a court cannot be too exacting in [its] demands for a connection
between the initial misrepresentation and subsequent revelation”) (internal quotations omitted)
(alteration in original). Defendants’ proposed standard would require either an admission of
fraud or a definitive finding of fraud. This is not the law.

47

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 58 of 66

Moreover, Defendants’ cited cases (Defs. Br. at 55-56) do not support such a pleading
requirement and are otherwise distinguishable. In Bach v. Amedisys, Inc., No. 10-cv-395, 2012
WL 6947008 (W.D. La. June 28, 2012), rev’d, Pub. Emps.’ Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Amedisys Inc.,
No. 13-cv-30580, 2014 WL 4931411 (5th Cir. Oct. 2, 2014) (Defs. Br. at 55-57), one alleged
corrective disclosure was a Citron report which acknowledged that “it is not yet concluding that
Amedisys is committing fraud” and more scrutiny is needed, while the other was an article
containing a statistical analysis of public information. Bach, 2012 WL 6947008, at *9-10.
Notably, the Fifth Circuit recently reversed Bach, holding that a series of partial disclosures,
including a Citron report, article, and government investigations, coupled with a later change in
the company’s practices in response to the investigations, “collectively constitute and culminate
in a corrective disclosure that adequately pleads loss causation.” Pub. Emps.’ Ret. Sys. of Miss.,
2014 WL 4931411, at *8.
Unlike in Defendants’ cited cases, the People’s Daily articles were based not on public
information or speculation or opinion, but on previously undisclosed facts and specific instances
of illegal conduct unearthed during an investigation.40 Further distinguishing Defendants’ cited
cases is the context in which the articles were published—Nu Skin’s prior violations of China’s
multi-level marketing restrictions (¶52) and the Citron Report. Given this context, and the
announcement of the government investigations discussed below, it is evident that Plaintiff has

40

In In re Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. Securities Litigation, 639 F. Supp. 2d 1038
(N.D. Cal. 2009) (Defs. Br. at 56), the alleged corrective disclosure was based on a statistical
analysis of public information. Bach, 2012 WL 6947008, at *8; In re Maxim, 639 F. Supp. 2d at
1046-47. Lastly, in Janbay v. Canadian Solar, Inc., No. 10-cv-4430, 2012 WL 1080306
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2012) (Defs. Br. at 56), the alleged corrective disclosure was speculative
based on no new undisclosed facts and did not correspond with a drop in the company’s stock
price. Id. at *16.

48

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 59 of 66

adequately pled that the People’s Daily articles partially revealed the truth about Nu Skin’s
misrepresentations.
(iii)

January 16, 2014 Announcement of Government
Investigations

Before the market opened on January 16, 2014, two Chinese government agencies
announced that they were commencing investigations into Nu Skin’s marketing and sales
practices. ¶¶214-16. On that day, Nu Skin’s stock price fell 26.2%. ¶217. Defendants do not
dispute that these disclosures revealed new information, related back to their alleged
misrepresentations, and were accompanied by a stock drop. Instead, Defendants rely on the
supposedly “[w]ell-established” rule that the announcement of a government investigation alone
cannot constitute a corrective disclosure. Defs. Br. at 57. In reality, this rule is not wellestablished—it has not yet been addressed in this Circuit—and has been expressly rejected by
several courts. See In re Gentiva Sec. Litig., 932 F. Supp. 2d 352, 385, 387-88 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)
(examining cases, including two cases that Defendants cite, and rejecting the argument that the
announcement of an investigation is insufficient).
Regardless, even Defendants’ own out-of-Circuit cases (Defs. Br. at 57) hold that the
announcement of a government investigation may constitute a partial corrective disclosure when
it is coupled with confirmation of misconduct. See Meyer, 710 F.3d at 1201 n.13 (holding that
an investigation is sufficient when “coupled with a later finding of fraud or wrongdoing”); see
also Durham v. Whitney Info. Network, Inc., No. 06-cv-00687, 2009 WL 3783375, at *21 (M.D.
Fla. Nov. 10, 2009).41
41

Defendants’ cited case, In re Almost Family, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 10-cv-00520,
2012 WL 443461, at *13 n.9 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 10, 2012) (Defs. Br. at 57), is distinguishable
because there the company was later exonerated by a Senate report. See also Pub. Emps.’ Ret.
Sys. of Miss., 2014 WL 4931411, at *7-8 (distinguishing Almost Family and holding that “[t]he
(continued … )
49

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 60 of 66

Here, the Complaint alleges numerous previous and subsequent disclosures confirming
that Nu Skin had been engaged in an illegal pyramid scheme in China and disclosing the
significant negative impact this revelation would have on the Company’s business prospects.
¶¶221-40. Specifically, in the months after Nu Skin’s acknowledgement of wrongdoing on
January 21, 2014:


Nu Skin disclosed that it had settled certain government
investigations, would reform its sales practices, and would pay a
fine, primarily for improper direct sales and promotional activities
in violation of Mainland China’s Regulations on Direct Selling
Administration (¶¶230-31);



Nu Skin was required to disgorge its illegal sales revenue,
strengthen the education and supervision of its sales personnel, and
close certain “working studios” (¶232); and



A Chinese governmental agency announced that it would look into
increasing its regulation and scrutiny of the direct sales sector
(¶233).

These subsequent disclosures are entirely consistent with the conclusions in the People’s Daily
articles that prompted the investigations in the first place. Also – once Defendants stopped their
misconduct, sales growth in Mainland China decreased substantially. ¶¶18, 221, 237-240.
(iv)

January 21, 2014 Nu Skin Admissions in Form 8-K

Before the market opened on January 21, 2014, Nu Skin filed, on Form 8-K, a letter to its
customers acknowledging that: “during our recent rapid growth, there were instances where
some of our sales people failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations”
such as making “improper descriptions of Nu Skin’s distinct business model in China that
confuse it with Nu Skin’s business model in other markets.” ¶219. Given that this admission
( … continued)
district court erred in imposing an overly rigid rule that government investigations can never
constitute a corrective disclosure in the absence of a discovery of actual fraud”).

50

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 61 of 66

came just days after the publication of the two People’s Daily articles about Nu Skin’s multilevel marketing activities, prompting the commencement of two government investigations, it is
apparent that these statements relate to the subject of these articles and investigations.42
Defendants make the hyper-technical argument that Nu Skin’s admission was not to
violating China’s regulations on direct selling but to violating its own policies and regulations.
Defs. Br. at 57-58. First, presumably it is Nu Skin’s policy to comply with government
regulations. Second, Defendants are essentially insisting upon a mirror-image rule, which the
Tenth Circuit has expressly rejected. See In re Williams Sec. Litig., 558 F.3d at 1140 (a
“disclosure need not precisely mirror the earlier misrepresentation”). Despite Defendants’ hope
to the contrary, this is not the law. Nu Skin’s argument illustrates why: “If a fact-for-fact
disclosure were required to establish loss causation, a defendant could defeat liability by refusing
to admit the falsity of its prior misstatements.” Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Flowserve Corp.,
572 F.3d 221, 230 (5th Cir. 2009).
(b)

Investors’ Losses Were Caused by the Materialization of Risks
Previously Concealed by Defendants

Under the “materialization of the concealed risk” theory of loss causation, a plaintiff must
allege that: (i) “the risk that caused the loss was within the zone of risk concealed by the
misrepresentation”; and (ii) the security “lost value because the concealed risk materialized.”
Nakkhumpun v. Taylor, No. 12-cv-01038, 2014 WL 321156, at *3 (D. Colo. Jan. 19, 2014).

42

Defendants also argue without support that this disclosure is not corrective because the
stock price only dropped 2.6% on January 21. Defs. Br. at 58. Contrary to Defendants’
contention, the negative price reaction is consistent with the leakage theory alleged in the
Complaint. This is sufficient on a motion to dismiss. See Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S.
336, 346 (2005) (plaintiff need only provide the defendant with “fair notice of what the
plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”) (internal quotations and citation
omitted).

51

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 59 Filed 10/28/14 Page 62 of 66

Here, Defendants’ misrepresentations concealed the risk that Nu Skin’s illegal marketing and
sales practices would result in government investigations, monetary penalties, disruption of
business, and lost revenue. These risks materialized during each of the specific corrective
disclosures dates alleged. ¶¶285-290. These facts establish loss causation under the
materialization of the concealed risk theory. See In re SemGroup Energy Partners, 729 F. Supp.
2d at 1301.
E.

The Control Person Allegations are Adequately Pled

Defendants contest Plaintiff’s Section 20(a) claims only on the basis that the underlying
Section 10(b) claim should be dismissed. Defs. Br. at 58-59. Because those arguments fail, the
Court should sustain Plaintiff’s claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied in full.43
