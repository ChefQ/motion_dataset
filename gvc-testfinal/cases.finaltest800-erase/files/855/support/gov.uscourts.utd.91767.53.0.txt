Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 8 of 67

INTRODUCTION
Beginning on January 15, 2014, the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the
Chinese government, published a series of negative articles about Provo-based direct marketer
Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (“Nu Skin” or the “Company”), primarily accusing Nu Skin’s Chinese
business (“Nu Skin China”) of operating an illegal pyramid scheme and violating China’s strict
prohibition on the payment of multi-level compensation (i.e., paying commissions to Nu Skin
China sales personnel based not only on their own sales but also on sales made by others in the
organization). Within days of the publication of the first of these articles, the first securities
fraud class action lawsuits were brought against Nu Skin and its senior executives. In those
initial complaints, plaintiffs appeared to presume that the Chinese government would find Nu
Skin in violation of these laws, subject it to draconian sanctions, and possibly shut down its
operations in China. Plaintiffs thus claimed that Nu Skin was liable for securities fraud because
it failed to warn its investors that it was violating these Chinese laws and would suffer such
dramatic consequences in the future.
However, things did not turn out the way Plaintiffs’ counsel had foreseen. The
Chinese authorities completed their investigation in late March 2014, and did not find Nu Skin
liable for violating either the anti-pyramid scheme laws or the multi-level commission laws. Nu
Skin was neither subjected to significant penalties nor required to alter its business model.
Instead, the Chinese authorities fined it approximately $500,000 for violations unrelated to these
pyramid and multi-level compensation issues. Nu Skin’s stock rallied dramatically in response.
In light of these developments, one might have expected Plaintiffs to voluntarily
dismiss their claims, or at least to modify their approach to this litigation. They have done

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 9 of 67

neither. Instead, Plaintiffs continue to claim that Nu Skin committed securities fraud by failing
to inform investors that it was violating the same Chinese laws that it was not found to have
violated in the recently concluded government investigations. The Amended Complaint
therefore fails to state a claim and should be dismissed for the reasons set forth below.
STATEMENT OF RELIEF SOUGHT AND GROUNDS FOR MOTION
Pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6), 9(b), and 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a), et
seq., Defendants Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.; M. Truman Hunt (“Hunt”); and Ritch N. Wood
(“Wood” and, collectively, “Defendants”) hereby respectfully move for an order dismissing the
Amended Complaint, with prejudice, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be
granted. As set forth below, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim under Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder
(“Rule 10b-5”), or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for the following reasons.
First, the Amended Complaint fails to plead an actionable false or misleading
statement. Given the fact that Chinese regulators recently completed their investigation of Nu
Skin China and did not find it in violation of China’s anti-pyramid selling or multi-level
commission laws, Plaintiffs have no valid basis to claim that Nu Skin misled investors by not
informing them that it was violating those same laws. Moreover, the specific facts about its
compensation model that Plaintiffs accuse Nu Skin of keeping from the market were actually
disclosed in the Company’s public filings long before the People’s Daily articles were published.
Accordingly, the alleged omissions cannot be material as a matter of law.

-2-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 10 of 67

The Amended Complaint should also be dismissed for failure to satisfy Rule 8 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because it fails to identify the specific statements alleged to
be false or misleading and explain why each statement is actionable. The Amended Complaint
instead quotes large blocks from lengthy Nu Skin public statements and then offers a laundry list
of reasons why these groups of statements are false and misleading, leaving the Court to divine
which statements are purportedly false and why. Such “puzzle pleading” is impermissible.
Next, the Amended Complaint fails to meet its heavy burden of pleading
particularized facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter. Rather than alleging
particularized facts, Plaintiffs attempt to establish scienter through boilerplate allegations that
China is an important part of Nu Skin’s business and that Nu Skin’s senior executives sold stock
and were well compensated during the three-year-long proposed class period. Such pleading has
been repeatedly rejected by courts in similar circumstances. The Amended Complaint also tries
to rely on conclusory hearsay statements from low-level confidential witnesses who do not even
claim to have communicated with anyone in Nu Skin management, a tactic that courts routinely
reject as a basis for pleading scienter.
Finally, the Amended Complaint should be dismissed because it fails to
adequately plead loss causation. To plead loss causation, Plaintiffs must allege an actionable
corrective disclosure (e.g., an admission by Nu Skin or a finding by a government body that a
prior Nu Skin statement was false or misleading). No such corrective disclosure occurred here.
Instead, Plaintiffs rely on a repackaging of previously alleged facts, the announcement of a
government investigation, and media speculation about potential violations of law. Established
precedent demonstrates that none of these allegations is sufficient to establish loss causation.

BACKGROUND
Nu Skin is a leading maker of premium-quality anti-aging personal care products
and nutritional supplements, which it sells in over 50 countries around the world. This product
suite covers a broad array of health and beauty applications. For example, Nu Skin’s ageLOC
products use an innovative scientific approach to address the signs and sources of aging. Exhibit
(“Ex.”) A (2011 10-K) at 3. 1 Similarly, the Company’s LifePak product is a nutritional
supplement designed to improve overall health and diet. Id. at 5-6. Dozens of other Nu Skin
products include everything from weight management systems, to supplements that target
specific nutritional needs, to highly nutritious meals called “VitaMeal.” Id. at 6.
Nu Skin’s Success and Growth
Since its founding in 1984, Nu Skin has enjoyed dramatic growth. In 2013 alone,
Nu Skin reported a record $3.2 billion in revenue, with year-over-year growth of nearly 50%.
Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 1. Its growth in China has been especially strong in recent years. Nu Skin
saw 67% growth in Mainland China from 2010 to 2011, 74% from 2011 to 2012, and 292% from
2012 to 2013, with revenues increasing from $91.4 million to over $1 billion during that time.
Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 56; Ex. B (2012 10-K) at 50; Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 56. During the same
span, the number of Sales Employees in Mainland China increased from fewer than 2000
employees to roughly 12,000. Ex. L (2010 10-K) at 21; Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 21; Ex B (2012
10-K) at 17; Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 17.

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 12 of 67

Contrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestion, Nu Skin’s growth has not been confined to
China. For example, in 2013, Nu Skin experienced 11% growth in North Asia, 48% growth in
Greater China (excluding Mainland China), 15% in South Asia/the Pacific, 30% in the Americas,
and 7% in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 56-58. Nu
Skin had also reported significant growth in most of these markets over the past several years.
See Ex. B (2012 10-K) at 50-51 (2012 growth of 6% in North Asia, 40% in South Asia/the
Pacific, 15% in the Americas, and 14% in EMEA); Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 55-57 (2011 growth of
9% in North Asia, 29% in South Asia/the Pacific, and 8% in Europe).
Nu Skin’s Global Business and Compensation Model
In most countries, Nu Skin operates through a direct selling model. Pursuant to
its global business model, Nu Skin sales personnel—who are independent distributors, not Nu
Skin employees—sell Nu Skin products to customers outside of traditional retail stores. In so
doing, Nu Skin’s distributors may contact friends and relatives, engage in door-to-door sales, or
pursue other means of selling Nu Skin’s products.
Nu Skin’s independent distributors are compensated pursuant to Nu Skin’s global
compensation plan. Under that plan, distributors earn commissions not only on their own sales,
but also on the sales of distributors that they bring into the sales organization and subsequently
train and lead. Nu Skin permits this “multi-level” compensation for up to six generations of
distributors. Accordingly, a Nu Skin distributor who leads a large sales organization (sometimes
referred to as “Sales Leaders”) can earn substantial sums. For example, a Sales Leader can earn
a 5-20% commission on sales to his or her own network of consumers, 5% on every sale made
by the individuals that the Sales Leader has recruited into the organization and trained, an

-5-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 13 of 67

additional 5% commission on sales made by salespersons recruited by the Sales Leader’s
recruits, and so on, up to six levels deep into the organization. 2
Nu Skin’s Business and Compensation Model in China Differs from the Global Model
Nu Skin’s business and compensation model in China is distinctly different from
its global model due to China’s unique regulatory requirements. In 1998, China imposed a ban
on direct selling, which was not lifted until 2005. Thus, Nu Skin did not conduct direct sales in
China at that time, but instead operated a limited number of retail stores selling products under a
legacy brand. In 2003, Nu Skin expanded its retail network and began selling Nu Skin-branded
products.
In 2005, China passed legislation allowing direct selling, but under limited
circumstances and with strict licensing, regulatory, and other requirements. Among other things,
in order to engage in direct selling, Nu Skin must obtain a direct selling license for the
geographic territory in question (e.g., province, city, etc.), and each individual that wishes to
engage in direct selling must complete an examination administered by Nu Skin and obtain a
direct selling card from the Company. Nu Skin promptly started applying for direct selling
2

Nu Skin describes its global distributor/Sales Leader compensation model as follows:
Our Sales Leaders can receive “multi-level” compensation under our global sales
compensation plan for product sales to their consumer groups as well as the sales made
through the network of Sales Leaders they have developed and trained. Our distributors
are not required to recruit or sponsor other distributors, and we do not pay any
commissions for recruiting or sponsoring other distributors. While all of our distributors
can sponsor other distributors at any time, our Sales Leaders and those in qualification to
become Sales Leaders are the distributors who generally are actively sponsoring other
distributors. Pursuant to our global sales compensation plan, we pay consolidated
monthly commissions in a Sales Leader’s home country, in local currency, for product
sales in the Sales Leader’s own consumer group and for product sales in the Sales
Leader’s organization of Sales Leaders across all geographic markets. Ex. B (2012 10-K)

licenses and now possesses such licenses for a significant portion of the country. Also in 2005,
China formalized an “anti-pyramid” law that, among other things, imposes a ban on paying sales
personnel in China the types of multi-level commissions that Nu Skin pays in most other
countries.
In light of the Chinese regulatory scheme, Nu Skin now operates in China
pursuant to a “hybrid” model that includes both “Direct Sellers” and “Sales Employees.” Direct
Sellers are persons who pass an exam administered by Nu Skin and obtain authorization from Nu
Skin to engage in direct selling in a particular territory. They are not Nu Skin employees, but
instead are akin to independent contractors. Nu Skin’s Direct Sellers in China can sell Nu Skin’s
products anywhere in their authorized territory. Nu Skin compensates these Direct Sellers
through sales commissions. However, unlike under its global model, Nu Skin’s Direct Sellers in
China only earn commissions on their own personal sales, and not on the sales of any other
individuals. Nu Skin has relatively few Direct Sellers in China.
The other part of Nu Skin’s hybrid model in China is comprised of Sales
Employees—individuals who are employed by Nu Skin and are not Direct Sellers. Because
these Sales Employees have not met the requirements to become Direct Sellers, they can only
sell Nu Skin products at Nu Skin retail locations. However, these Sales Employees are free to
engage with potential customers in the field to promote and market Nu Skin’s products, solicit
new business, and drive customers to the retail stores located throughout China. The great
majority of Nu Skin’s sales force in China is comprised of Sales Employees.
To comply with China’s laws barring multi-level commissions, Nu Skin
compensates its Sales Employees in China in two ways. First, like Nu Skin’s Direct Sellers in

-7-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 15 of 67

China, its Sales Employees receive sales commissions on personal sales to their customers. In
addition, Nu Skin pays a monthly salary to its Sales Employees in China that is adjusted on a
quarterly basis. This salary is based on various factors, including their compliance with
Company policy and applicable laws and regulations, their individual sales productivity, the
effectiveness of their leadership, training, and supervision of other Sales Employees, and their
ability to attract and maintain customers and promote the Nu Skin brand. In evaluating the
effectiveness of a Sale Employee’s ability to lead, train, and supervise a sales team, Nu Skin
takes into consideration not only the employee’s own sales productivity, but also the sales
productivity of the group of salespeople developed and supervised by that Sales Employee,
which is a factor commonly used by organizations to evaluate the performance of sales managers
in a sales organization.
Nu Skin is far from the only direct selling company doing business in China
today. To the contrary, most of the major direct selling organizations in the world (e.g., Amway
and Mary Kay) do a substantial amount of business in China, with the revenues of many of these
organizations significantly exceeding Nu Skin’s China-based revenue. All of these companies
are subject to the same direct selling and anti-pyramid regulations. Moreover, while the details
vary, a great many of these businesses employ a model similar to Nu Skin’s, under which they
pay commissions only on direct sales, but also compensate their sales personnel in other ways for
developing and supervising other successful sales personnel.
Nu Skin Disclosed the Nature of its Business in China and Warned Investors of Potential Risks
While Nu Skin is proud of its achievements and excited about its future in China,
and while it believes that it complies with Chinese laws and regulations, Nu Skin has

-8-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 16 of 67

nevertheless gone to great pains to educate its investors about its business and compensation
model in China, and to caution investors about the risks and uncertainties inherent in operating
there. First, in each of Nu Skin’s quarterly and annual reports, it explains that its business in
China operates under a model that differs from its global model. See, e.g., Ex. B (2012 10-K) at
11 (“Because of restrictions on direct selling and multi-level commissions in China, our sales
employees, contractual sales promoters and direct sellers do not participate in our global sales
compensation plan, but are instead compensated according to a separate compensation model
established for that market.”). Nu Skin also tells its investors that, in establishing the salary level
for Sales Employees in China, it uses “the sales productivity of a sales leader and the sales
promoters and employees he/she leads and supervises,” as well as various other factors. Ex. A
(2011 10-K) at 26.
Moreover, while Nu Skin believes its business and compensation models in China
comply with Chinese law, because interpretation of Chinese law is uncertain and subject to
change, Nu Skin has warned its investors in every quarterly and annual disclosure going back for
years that its business in China was subject to significant regulatory risk and that it was possible
the government would find its conduct (or the conduct of individual salespeople) unlawful and
impose serious sanctions. For example, Nu Skin disclosed in each filing, “The regulatory
environment in China remains complex.” Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 17. Nu Skin also noted, “Our
operations in China have attracted significant regulatory and media scrutiny since we expanded
our operations there in January 2003.” Id. Nu Skin further explained that these regulations are
“subject to discretionary interpretation,” and “[i]nterpretations of what constitutes permissible
activities by regulators can vary from province to province and can change from time to time

-9-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 17 of 67

because of the lack of clarity in the rules regarding direct selling activities and differences in
customs and practices in each location.” Id.
Furthermore, Nu Skin has consistently explained that, while it “structured [its]
business model in China based on . . . [(1) its] interpretation of applicable regulations,”
(2) “guidance . . . from government officials,” (3) its “understanding of the practices of other
international direct selling companies operating in China,” and (4) its “understanding as to how
regulators are enforcing the regulations,” the nature of China’s political system “gives regulatory
agencies at both the local and central levels of government broad discretion to interpret and
enforce regulations in a fashion that promotes social order.” Id. at 26. As a result, Nu Skin
noted, “we face a risk that regulators may change the way in which they currently interpret and
enforce the direct selling regulations,” which could result in significant sanctions, including
preventing Nu Skin from continuing to operate its hybrid model in China. Id. Nu Skin
explained specifically, “If our business practices are found to be in violation of applicable
regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced in the future, in particular our use of the sales
productivity of a sales leader and the sales promoters and employees he/she leads and supervises
in setting his/her quarterly compensation level, then we could be forced to change our business
model and/or sanctioned, either of which could significantly harm our business.” Id.
Finally, Nu Skin has also made it very clear that it had been expanding rapidly in
China and, particularly in light of the influx of large numbers of new sales personnel in recent
years, there was a substantial risk that the conduct of individual salespeople could be found to
violate Chinese law. Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 26-27. For example, Nu Skin noted that “[w]e have
experienced rapid growth in China, which could strain our ability to effectively manage our

-10-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 18 of 67

operations.” Id. at 27. The Company also emphasized that “[i]nsufficient management of such
growth could result in . . . inappropriate claims or promotions by our sales force[] and
governmental inquiries and investigations, all of which could harm our revenue and ability to
generate sustained growth and result in unanticipated expenses.” Id.
Nu Skin added that “[t]he most significant area of risk for such activities relates to
improper product claims and claims regarding the business opportunity of being a distributor.”
Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 23. Nu Skin further noted that it “experience[s] problems with distributors
from time to time,” and, because of the dramatic growth in the number of salespeople, Nu Skin
disclosed an “increase[d] . . . risk [product] materials could contain problematic product or
marketing claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations,” potentially resulting in
“fines or other legal action if our distributors violate applicable laws and regulations.” Id.
Moreover, because of distributor uncertainty regarding Nu Skin’s China model, Nu Skin warned
investors that “confusion can result as to how those working in China should promote the
business in China,” which can “lead to governmental reviews and investigations of our
operations in China,” with regulators enjoying “broad latitude to conduct investigations.” Id. at
26. Nu Skin concluded, “[w]e anticipate that our business will continue to attract significant
governmental scrutiny” as its sales force continues to expand rapidly. Id.
The People’s Daily Allegations
In January 2014, some of the concerns that Nu Skin had been sharing with its
investors for years came to fruition. The People’s Daily, the Chinese government’s official
newspaper—which can reflect the policy positions of the government—published a series of
articles alleging that Nu Skin China had violated Chinese law by, inter alia, operating a pyramid

-11-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 19 of 67

scheme, paying multi-level commissions to sales personnel, making false and unsupported
product claims, and making false claims of celebrity and government endorsements of Nu Skin’s
products. The Chinese government announced an investigation into these allegations within
hours of their publication. Nu Skin’s stock dropped sharply following these events, suggesting
investors were deeply concerned that the Chinese government would impose harsh sanctions.
The Chinese Government’s Findings
However, to paraphrase Mark Twain, rumors of Nu Skin’s demise were greatly
exaggerated. Although Nu Skin’s stock price plummeted, the People’s Daily’s central
allegations never resulted in any government sanction, fine, or action. Following a roughly twomonth investigation that involved extensive interviews, document collections, and intense
scrutiny of all aspects of Nu Skin China’s business, the government did not find that Nu Skin
was operating a pyramid scheme, that its compensation practices were unlawful, that it was
paying multi-level commissions, that its employees’ contacts with customers outside the stores
constituted illegal direct selling, or that the overwhelming majority of the other allegations made
against Nu Skin China had merit. Instead, the government issued only a fine of approximately
$540,000 against Nu Skin China, and that fine was based on two violations of Chinese
regulations that have nothing to do with Plaintiffs’ complaint here. 3

3

Nu Skin was fined approximately $16,000 for the manner in which it described certain
technical aspects related to the science behind its anti-aging products. Nu Skin was also fined
approximately $524,000 based on sales by some of its licensed Direct Sellers of certain Nu Skin
products that were licensed for sale in Nu Skin’s retail stores, but not licensed for sale by Direct
Sellers. Additionally, the Chinese government imposed approximately $260,000 in fines on six
Nu Skin Sales Employees for certain unspecified inappropriate promotional activities.

-12-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 20 of 67

But Plaintiffs paid the government’s actual findings no heed. Instead, the
Amended Complaint continues to tout in vitriolic terms the exact facts that the Chinese
government itself has implicitly rejected. This is not surprising. Lead Plaintiff State-Boston
Retirement System (“State-Boston”) is a government pension plan located in Boston,
Massachusetts that has commenced approximately twenty securities fraud and other class actions
in state and federal courts over the past decade, most alleging causes of action similar to those
asserted here. And, in most of those cases, State-Boston has been represented by Labaton
Sucharow LLP, its law firm here. Ex. D (list of actions drawn from publicly available
databases). This serial plaintiff, whose claims have been rejected as inadequate on their face by
multiple courts in nearly a half dozen cases, 4 was apparently undeterred by the Chinese
government’s own conclusions and thus brings this action, regardless of its lack of merit.
The Aftermath of the People’s Daily Allegations
Despite the absence of significant government sanctions, Nu Skin’s business in
China has suffered during 2014. Once the People’s Daily made its allegations and the Chinese
government began its investigation, thousands of Nu Skin’s Sales Employees in China left the
Company. In addition, to show the Chinese government it was a responsible corporate citizen,
Nu Skin voluntarily put a temporary hold on hiring new Sales Employees and Direct Sellers, and
also temporarily stopped conducting promotional meetings. As a result, Sales Employees and
Direct Sellers who left the Company were not immediately replaced, and Nu Skin’s financial
4

All but three of the eighteen cases set out in Exhibit D hereto were either dismissed on
the merits, have a motion to dismiss pending or forthcoming, or were settled or voluntarily
dismissed prior to a motion to dismiss. See id. In one of the three exceptions, State-Boston lost
a motion for judgment as a matter of law following trial, and its counsel here was sanctioned for
conduct relating to the firm’s use of confidential witnesses (see infra § II.D n.31).

-13-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 21 of 67

performance in China suffered accordingly. While Nu Skin believes its business in China has
stabilized, it will take time to dissipate the harm to its business resulting from the actions taken in
response to the People’s Daily allegations.
*

In sum, Nu Skin has warned its investors for years about the risk and uncertainty
inherent in the Chinese regulatory landscape. When that risk appeared likely to materialize, its
stock price declined. The stock price then recovered significantly when the Chinese authorities
did not find that Nu Skin’s business model or compensation system violated Chinese law. The
Amended Complaint, however, turns a blind eye to this sequence of events. Instead, Plaintiffs
ask this Court to interpret China’s laws and find violations of those laws where China’s own
regulators did not. The Court should decline this invitation and dismiss the Amended Complaint
with prejudice.
STATEMENT OF FACTS 5
I.

Nu Skin’s Business and Compensation Model In China Differs From Its Global
Model
As set forth above, and as Nu Skin has long disclosed, its business and

compensation models in China differ significantly from its global model. The models differ in
two principal respects.

5

Except where otherwise noted, Defendants refer to allegations set out in the Amended
Complaint (the “Am. Compl.”).

-14-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 22 of 67

A.

Nature of Nu Skin’s Relationship With Its Sales Personnel
1.

In most markets, Nu Skin sells its products exclusively through

independent distributors who purchase inventory from Nu Skin and sell the product to their
customers. These distributors operate entirely through direct selling. Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 1.
2.

By contrast, in China, Nu Skin operates under a hybrid model under which

it utilizes both Sales Employees 6 and Direct Sellers. Ex. B (2012 10-K) at 8. 7 Nu Skin has
explained to its investors that its Sales Employees in China do not engage in direct selling:
[W]e currently are unable to operate under our global direct selling
business model in China as a result of regulatory restrictions on direct
selling activities in this market. Consequently, we have developed a
hybrid business model that utilizes retail stores with an employed sales
force and contractual sales promoters to sell products through fixed
locations, which we supplement with a direct sales opportunity in those
locations where we have obtained a direct sales license.
Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 10 (emphasis added). In other words, Nu Skin China has made clear that
its model is a hybrid one incorporating aspects of direct sales and retail sales.

6

In addition to its part-time and full-time Sales Employees, Nu Skin also utilizes the
services of “contractual sales promoters” and “independent marketers” in China. All of these
individuals are compensated in a similar manner (and a manner different from Nu Skin’s Direct
Sellers). Therefore, for purposes of this motion, Defendants will refer to full-time employees,
part-time employees, independent marketers, and contractual sales promoters as “Sales
Employees,” unless otherwise noted.

7

As Nu Skin has repeatedly disclosed, it “currently ha[s] very few direct sellers in
Mainland China,” see, e.g., Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 8, and the Company therefore operates
“mostly” through the Sales Employees described above. Am. Compl. ¶ 200. For example, the
Company disclosed in is 2012 annual report that it had 12,707 Sales Employees, working out of
roughly 40 retail stores. See Am. Compl. ¶ 56; Ex. B (2012 10-K) at 8, 17. Similarly, in 2013,
the Company reported it had 11,320 Sales Employees in Mainland China. Ex. C (2013 10-K) at
17.

-15-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 23 of 67

3.

While Nu Skin China’s Sales Employees cannot sell outside of its retail

locations, 8 the Company explains that they can (and are expected to) solicit potential customers
outside of retail stores in order to drive traffic to those stores:
We rely on our sales force to market and sell products at the various retail
locations supported by only minimal advertising and traditional
promotional efforts. Our sales force may also refer individuals to join our
sales force as sales employees, contractual sales promoters or direct
sellers. Our retail model in China is largely based upon our ability to
attract customers to our retail stores through our sales force, to educate
them about our products through frequent training meetings, and to obtain
repeat purchases.
Id.
4.

Nu Skin’s relatively few Direct Sellers in China are not Sales Employees.

Instead, as noted above, their role is similar to that of Nu Skin’s independent distributors in other
parts of the world; they purchase inventory from Nu Skin and then resell these products directly
to their customers. Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 8. Moreover, Nu Skin’s Direct Sellers are not required
to conduct their sale transactions through Nu Skin’s retail stores, but instead may consummate
sales of Nu Skin’s products anywhere in their authorized direct selling territory. See id.
B.

Compensation of Nu Skin Sales Personnel
5.

Under Nu Skin’s global model, its independent distributors are only paid

commissions, not salaries. As discussed above, these distributors earn commissions both on the
sales that they personally make and on the sales of any distributors that they introduce to Nu
Skin and bring into their sales organizations. There is no discretion applied in determining the
level of compensation, as the level of compensation is fixed by specific formula and terms. Ex.

8

See, e.g., Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 10.

-16-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 24 of 67

B (2012 10-K) at 11.
6.

In China, however, neither Nu Skin’s Direct Sellers nor its Sales

Employees receive commissions on sales made by others. Instead, Nu Skin pays commissions in
China to both its Direct Sellers and its Sales Employees based only on their personal sales. Ex.
B (2012 10-K) at 8. Nu Skin’s Direct Sellers in China receive only commissions, and those
commissions are capped at 30% of their sales volume. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 73, 150. Nu Skin Sales
Employees in China receive commissions on their personal sales and also receive salaries. Ex. C
(2013 10-K) at 8.
7.

The salaries of Nu Skin Sales Employees in China are paid monthly, but

are set on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the Company, based on its evaluation of their
performance. These salaries vary from quarter to quarter and are based on a number of different
objective and subjective performance factors, including sales productivity, leadership, training,
and compliance with the law and Company policy. See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 144. As Nu Skin
has repeatedly disclosed, one of the various factors relating to training and leadership that
impacts a Nu Skin employee’s salary in China is the performance of the team that the employee
leads and supervises. See, e.g., id. In other words, an employee’s salary can increase or decrease
based in part on the sales performance of the sales organization that he or she develops and
supervises. This element of Sales Employee compensation (which is not a commission) has been
disclosed to investors dozens of times over the past several years and is a common factor used by
other sales organizations in reviewing performance and setting compensation. For example, Nu
Skin has stated:
a.

“our current method of compensating our employed sales representatives and
contractual sales promoters [in China] includ[es] our use of the sales productivity
-17-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 25 of 67

of an individual and the group of individuals whom he or she trains and
supervises as one of the factors in establishing salary and compensation.” Ex. E
(2009 Q1 10-Q) at 23.
b.

in China we “use . . . the sales productivity of a sales leader and the sales
promoters and employees he/she leads and supervises in setting his/her quarterly
compensation level.” Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 26.

c.

In 2012, Defendant Ritch Wood, Nu Skin’s Chief Financial Officer, stated at an
investor conference that Nu Skin China paid Sales Employees salaries that
comprised 40% of the total aggregate sales compensation in China and were
based in part on “the productivity of both the employee and his/her sales team.”
Am. Compl. ¶ 150. 9
8.

Analysts also understood this portion of Nu Skin’s compensation model in

China and reported on it. For example, on August 8, 2012, Canaccord issued an analyst report
noting that “Nu Skin utilizes an employed work force in China for the vast majority of its sales
reps with a salary that is reset quarterly, commission rates dependent upon individual sales
volume, and organizational volume driving salary rates.” Am. Compl. ¶ 145. Similarly, on
August 20, 2012, Canaccord issued a second analyst report reiterating that Nu Skin China
“maintains an employed sales force where salaries are paid for group success.” Id. ¶ 151.
9.

The “hybrid model” described above was developed in response to

regulations on the direct selling industry that were promulgated in China in 2005. See, e.g., Am.
Compl. ¶ 64. As explained by the Company:
Because of restrictions on direct selling and multi-level commissions in
Mainland China, we have implemented a business model for that market
that is different from the business model we use in our other markets . . . .
Our sales employees, contractual sales promoters, direct sellers and
independent marketers in Mainland China do not participate in our global
sales compensation plan, but are instead compensated according to a
separate compensation model established for Mainland China. Sales
employees, contractual sales promoters, direct sellers and independent
marketers all earn commissions on their product sales at established
commission rates. Sales employees also receive a salary, which is
reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis.
Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 8.
C.

Risk of Regulatory Action Based on Sales and Compensation Practices
10.

As noted above, Nu Skin has also long recognized and disclosed to the

public that China’s anti-pyramid and direct selling regulations were vague and subject to
uncertainty, and that regulators at both the local and state level had broad discretion in
interpreting these laws. For example, in 2009, the Company stated that “[t]he direct selling
regulations in China are restrictive and there continues to be some confusion and uncertainty as
to the meaning of the regulations and the specific types of restrictions and requirements imposed
under them,” and that “[i]t is also difficult to predict how regulators will interpret and enforce
these regulations.” Ex. E (2009 Q1 10-Q) at 23.
11.

And Nu Skin warned that, in such a regulatory environment, its China

compensation model might invite regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions. For example, in
its Q1 2009 10-Q, issued two years before the class period began here, Nu Skin disclosed:
In particular, our business would be harmed by any determination [by the
government in China] that our current method of compensating our
-19-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 27 of 67

employed sales representatives and contractual sales promoters, including
our use of the sales productivity of an individual and the group of
individuals whom he or she trains and supervises as one of the factors in
establishing salary and compensation, violates the restriction on multilevel compensation under the rules.
Ex. E (2009 Q1 10-Q) at 23. Nu Skin included a substantially similar or identical disclosure in
every 10-Q and 10-K from that time to the present. See supra n.9.
12.

More generally, Nu Skin has also warned investors that, in light of the

unpredictable regulatory environment in China, there was substantial risk that the Company’s
activities, including its fundamental business model, might be challenged by the government.
For example, its Q1 2009 10-Q stated that “[o]ur operations in China are subject to significant
regulatory scrutiny, and we have experienced challenges in the past, including interruption of
sales activities at certain stores and fines being paid in some cases.” Ex. E (2009 Q1 10-Q) at 23.
The disclosure went on to explain that, “[e]ven though we have now obtained a direct selling
license, government regulators continue to scrutinize our activities and the activities of our
employed sales representatives, contractual sales promoters and direct sellers to monitor our
compliance with applicable regulations as we integrate direct selling into our business model.”
Id.
13.

The 10-Q concluded:

“Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our
employed sales representatives, contractual sales promoters or direct
sellers, are not in compliance with applicable regulations, could result in
the imposition of substantial fines, extended interruptions of business,
termination of necessary licenses and permits, including our direct selling
licenses, or restrictions on our ability to open new stores or obtain
approvals for service centers or expand into new locations, all of which
could harm our business . . . . The direct selling regulations in China are
restrictive and there continues to be some confusion and uncertainty as to
the meaning of the regulations and the specific types of restrictions and

-20-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 28 of 67

requirements imposed under them. It is also difficult to predict how
regulators will interpret and enforce these regulations.”
Id. Each 10-Q and 10-K since then has included substantially similar or identical cautionary
language. 10
14.

Nu Skin’s disclosures have also noted that Nu Skin China had been the

subject of investigations and regulatory scrutiny in the past, had paid fines on multiple instances
in prior years, and could face “more significant sanctions,” Ex. A (2011 10-K) at 26, including
potentially being “forced to change our business model,” id., or “extended interruptions of
business, termination of necessary licenses and permits, including our direct selling licenses, or
restrictions on our ability to open new stores or obtain approvals for service centers or expand
into new locations, all of which could harm our business.” Ex. I (2010 Q1 10-Q) at 23.

Publication of the Citron Report in August 2012
15.

On August 7, 2012, and in a supplemental report published on August 16,

2012, well-known short-seller Citron Research published a report (the “Citron Report”) that was
substantially identical in material respects to the People’s Daily articles and to the allegations set
out in the Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs do not dispute this fact and, indeed, refer to the Citron
Report as a “partial corrective disclosure.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 141-42, 149, 286(a).

in the People’s Daily articles which lie at the crux of this litigation. For example, Citron alleged

that Nu Skin China had “support[ed] the creation of a multi-level pyramid compensation
scheme,” and “is in fact operating as an MLM” (Ex. V (August 7, 2012 report) at 3), and “is
composed of many pyramids,” featuring employees with as many as “2,000 full-time downlines”
and providing that “every new distributor has 6 uplines who will help train the new distributors,”
with “every one of your uplines . . . mak[ing a] 5% commission from your sales.” Ex. W
(August 16, 2012 report) at 2. The Citron Report also cited undercover witnesses and documents
purportedly demonstrating these pyramid selling and MLM activities. Ex. V (August 7, 2012
report) at 4-5. Citron additionally alleged, just as Plaintiffs do here, that Nu Skin China needed
to use a sophisticated computer system in order to calculate compensation in China based on
downline performance. Id. at 6.
17.

Similarly, just like Plaintiffs here, Citron alleged violations of the PRC’s

direct selling laws, contending that Nu Skin China had “violate[d] laws regulating direct selling,”
Ex. V (August 7, 2012 Citron Report) at 3, and engaged in “a blatant violation of direct selling
principles.” Id. at 4; see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 141-42.
18.

Finally, Citron made miscellaneous allegations that Nu Skin China had

“promise[d] unlimited riches for . . . new recruit[s] to join the pyramid” (Ex. V (August 7, 2012
Citron Report) at 5), engaged in “[b]rainwashing and chanting slogans” (id. at 8), and “requir[ed]
purchases in order to participate in sales commissions or salary” (id. at 3), as well as making
claims regarding its ageLOC product based on “pseudo-scien[ce]” and falsely claiming
endorsements from a major scientist. Ex. W (August 16, 2012 Citron Report) at 3, 5, 11-14, 17.
Citron concluded by noting the likelihood of severe government sanctions due to this alleged
misconduct. (Ex. V (August 7, 2012 Citron Report) at 10.)

19.

Following the issuance of the Citron Report, Nu Skin reiterated the fact

that Nu Skin China relied on group productivity as one of the various factors it considers in
establishing the salaries of its Sales Employees, Am. Compl. ¶ 144 (quoting August 7, 2012 8K), and analysts then discussed whether Nu Skin China’s practices violated the law. For
example, Andrew Left of Citron appeared on television and debated a Deutsche Bank analyst,
with Left asserting, “‘If you look at my diagrams on my website, you can see reps drawing out
pyramids when recruiting,’” adding that “‘they most definitely run an MLM in China,’”
including “‘get[ting] paid for recruiting sellers down the pyramid, which constitutes an MLM
scheme.’” Id. ¶ 147.
III.

Publication of Substantially Identical Allegations by People’s Daily in January 2014
20.

Approximately 18 months after publication of the Citron Report, the

People’s Daily made substantially identical allegations in two articles published on January 15
and 16, 2014. The state-controlled newspaper reported that Nu Skin China was “suspected of”
operating a pyramid scheme and providing multi-level compensation, Am. Compl., Ex. E at 12,
and engaging in direct selling of products that were not licensed for direct selling. Id. at 8; see
also id., Ex. F at 9. More specifically, the People’s Daily asserted: (i) Nu Skin China’s
“personnel is in pyramid or ladder-shaped structure” (Am. Compl., Ex. E at 12); (ii) “[a]ccording
to national relevant laws, such bonus system and personnel composition are suspected of
pyramid schemes” (id.); (iii) salespeople “may gain commissions at 5% of the sales of their
‘subordinate’” (id., Ex. F at 9); and (iv) Nu Skin China required new salespeople “to purchase
Nu Skin products for 500” RMB as part of a pyramid scheme. Id. at 10.

-23-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 31 of 67

21.

The paper also reported that Nu Skin salespersons promoted Nu Skin as a

“get rich quick” scheme—join Nu Skin if “you want to earn 1 million yuan in half a year” (Am.
Compl., Ex. E at 9)—and that the Company “was suspected of mind control, so called
‘brainwashing.’” Id. at 12.
22.

The Company’s closing stock price on January 14, 2014 was $136.47.

Following publication of the first People’s Daily article on January 15, the Company’s stock
price fell 15.5% to $115.23. Am. Compl. ¶ 286(b), (e).
IV.

The Response to the People’s Daily Articles
23.

On January 16, the Chinese government announced an investigation into

the accusations made by the People’s Daily. Id. ¶¶ 214-15. Following that announcement, Nu
Skin’s stock fell another 26.4%, to $84.80. Id. ¶ 286(c).
24.

On January 21, 2014, Nu Skin filed an 8-K acknowledging instances in

which some of its salespeople failed adequately to follow and enforce Nu Skin’s policies and
regulations (not Chinese laws or regulations) and announcing additional training of its
employees. Id. ¶ 219. Nu Skin also stated it was voluntarily suspending business promotional
meetings and its acceptance of new Direct Sellers and Sales Employees until the government’s
investigation was complete. Id. ¶¶ 219, 221. Nu Skin’s announcement did not acknowledge
Company wrongdoing—to the contrary, it emphasized Nu Skin China’s intention to improve the
education of its salespeople regarding how to accurately describe the Company’s fully compliant
China business model. Id. ¶ 219. Nu Skin’s stock fell just 2.62% following the issuance of the
8-K. Id. ¶ 220.

-24-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 32 of 67

25.

On March 24, 2014, Nu Skin announced the conclusion of all material

investigations in China. Id. ¶¶ 230-34. 11 Similarly, the Chinese government announced the
results of the investigation on its website. See id. ¶¶ 230-33. 12 The investigations resulted in a
fine of about $540,000, based on findings that: (1) certain products licensed only for sale in the
Company’s retail locations had been sold by some of the Company’s Direct Sellers, and (2) Nu
Skin China lacked adequate scientific support for certain product claims. See, e.g., Am. Compl.
¶¶ 230, 287-89. At the same time, six Beijing Sales Employees were fined $241,000,
collectively, for improper promotional activities. Am. Compl. ¶ 231. Nu Skin also agreed to
improve the education and supervision of its Direct Sellers and Sales Employees and to close
certain promotional workshops being run by certain Sales Employees in Beijing. Am. Compl.
¶ 232.
26.

The Chinese government investigation was most notable for what it did

not conclude. It did not find that Nu Skin was a pyramid scheme, engaged in unlawful MLM
activities, violated the direct selling regulations because its Sales Employees engaged in
promotional activities outside the stores, or needed to change its business or compensation
model. Id. ¶¶ 230-32. Not surprisingly, the government’s decision was greeted as “very good
news,” and Nu Skin’s stock rebounded nearly 20% upon the announcement that the Chinese

11

The Amended Complaint vaguely alleges the existence of “at least one investigation by
Chinese authorities” of Nu Skin as of June 2014, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 234 (emphasis in original),
but does not even suggest that this investigation is connected to Plaintiffs’ allegations here in any
way.

Allegations in the Amended Complaint
27.

Notwithstanding the fact that the government did not adopt the People’s

Daily’s fundamental allegations, which echoed the allegations made by Citron, the Amended
Complaint largely repackages them here. The Amended Complaint asserts that Nu Skin made
false statements and omissions regarding its financial performance in China and its China
business model and operations, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 83-210, because it failed to disclose that it was
violating China’s anti-pyramid and direct selling laws, in three principal ways.
28.

First, the Amended Complaint asserts that Nu Skin paid “sales

representatives [i.e., Sales Employees] in Mainland China on the basis not only of their own
sales but also of the sales productivity of the sales people [they] recruited.” Id. ¶ 65 (emphasis
added). The complaint cites various purported confidential witnesses and two alleged Company
documents in support of this allegation. See id. ¶¶ 65-78.
29.

Second and relatedly, Plaintiffs allege that Nu Skin China’s Direct Sellers

were compensated based in part on “sales productivity” of their sales team, even though there is
an absolute bar on compensating Direct Sellers in China for anything other than their personal
sales. Id. ¶¶ 65-66. Plaintiffs again rely on the same smattering of confidential witnesses and
two documents to support this claim. See id. ¶¶ 65-78.
30.

Third, Plaintiffs allege that, because Nu Skin China Sales Employees did

not possess direct selling licenses, their practice of promoting and marketing Nu Skin products
with potential customers outside of Nu Skin’s retail stores violated Chinese direct selling

-26-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 34 of 67

regulations, even though the products in question were actually purchased at Nu Skin’s retail
stores. See, e.g., id. ¶ 78.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On April 7, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a stipulated motion to consolidate the cases,
appoint a lead plaintiff, and appoint lead counsel. On June 30, 2014, pursuant to a stipulated
briefing schedule—and months after the Chinese government issued its findings—Plaintiffs filed
the Amended Complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD
To state a claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, a
securities fraud complaint must plead six elements: (1) a material false or misleading statement;
(2) made with scienter; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance on
the statement; (5) economic loss; and (6) a causal connection between the material
misrepresentation or omission and the loss, commonly referred to as “loss causation.” See Dura
Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005).
In addition, the PSLRA requires plaintiffs to “specify each statement alleged to
have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an
allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint
shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1);
Weinstein v. McClendon, 2014 WL 3057190, --- F.3d ----, at *2 (10th Cir. July 8, 2014) (same).
A complaint must also “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the
defendant acted with the required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2)(A); Weinstein, 2014
WL 3057190, --- F.3d ----, at *3.

ARGUMENT
I.

Plaintiffs Fail Adequately to Plead Falsity.
A.

Plaintiffs Fail to Allege a False Statement or Omission of Material Fact.
The Amended Complaint should be dismissed first and foremost because

Plaintiffs have not alleged an actionable misstatement or omission. To plead falsity, Plaintiffs
must allege both a false statement or omission of fact and that the statement or omission was
material. See, e.g., In re Gold Res. Corp. Sec. Litig., 957 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1292 (D. Colo.
2013). But it is hornbook law that “[m]ateriality . . . depends on the information that already
exists in the market” and that, “unless the statement significantly altered the total mix of
information available, it will not be considered material.’” Slater v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc.,
719 F.3d 1190, 1197 (10th Cir. 2013) (quoting Grossman v. Novell, Inc., 120 F.3d 1112, 1119
(10th Cir. 1997)); see Kapur v. USANA Health Scis., Inc., 2:07–CV–177, 2008 WL 2901705, at
*9 (D. Utah July 23, 2008).
The Amended Complaint alleges that (i) Nu Skin’s quarterly and annual earnings
releases and related documents containing statements about Nu Skin’s growth and financial
performance in China; 13 and (ii) certain Nu Skin statements about the nature of its business and
compensation model in China 14 were false and/or misleading, because Nu Skin failed to disclose

13

See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 83-90, 93-96, 98-100, 102-05, 107-08, 110-18, 120-28, 130-36, 139,
153, 155-60, 162-63, 165, 167-70, 174, 176-82, 185, 187-91, 193-94, 196-201, 203-04, 206, 208.
14

See id. ¶¶ 89, 99, 108, 118, 126, 128, 139, 144-45, 147, 150-51, 153, 159, 165, 169, 172,
200 (describing Nu Skin’s hybrid model in China and explaining how its Sales Employees and
Direct Sellers are compensated).

-28-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 36 of 67

that it was violating various Chinese laws and regulations. 15
Thus, Plaintiffs must allege facts demonstrating that Nu Skin violated Chinese
law. Plaintiffs cannot rely on mere boilerplate allegations that Nu Skin China was a “pyramid
scheme” or engaged in illegal multi-level marketing, see, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5-9, 57-59, 64-65,
82, 92, 152, because such allegations lack the requisite particularity to be actionable under the
law of this Circuit. See, e.g., Grossman, 120 F.3d at 1124 (“Mere conclusory allegations of
falsity are insufficient.”); Arena Land & Inv. Co., Inc. v. Petty, 906 F. Supp. 1470, 1482 (D. Utah
1994), aff’d, 69 F.3d 547 (10th Cir. 1995) (rejecting “conclusory allegations” of fraudulent
scheme).
Instead, the Court may examine only non-conclusory, factual allegations of
alleged illegal behavior that have been pleaded with specificity. Although the Amended
Complaint is far from a model of clarity, it appears that Plaintiffs’ factual allegations related to
the alleged violations of Chinese law are as follows:
1.

Nu Skin violated Chinese law by compensating its Sales
Employees in China not only for their personal sales, but also
based on the sales of others within their individual sales
organizations, see, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 65;

2.

Nu Skin violated Chinese law by compensating its Direct Sellers in
China based not only on their personal sales, but also on the sales
of others, see, e.g., id.; and

15

The Amended Complaint also includes what appear to be Plaintiffs’ general critiques of
the direct selling and multi-level marketing industries. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40-45. These
gratuitous remarks are not linked to any statement by any defendant and thus cannot give rise to
an action for securities fraud.

-29-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 37 of 67

3.

Nu Skin Sales Employees violated Chinese direct selling
regulations because they solicited the purchase of Nu Skin
products outside of Nu Skin retail stores without direct selling
licenses. See, e.g., id. ¶ 78.

When examined in turn, none of these allegations is sufficient to plead falsity.
1.

Nu Skin’s Compensation of Its Sales Employees Based on Group
Productivity Has Long Been Publicly Disclosed and Was Not Found
to Violate Chinese Law.

Plaintiffs’ first substantive basis for claiming falsity is that Nu Skin China
violated Chinese law with respect to the compensation of its Sales Employees, by creating “sales
‘teams,’” Am. Compl. ¶ 10, paying “compensation based on group or team sales volume,” id.
¶ 73, and employing a system in which “one’s income depended upon the sales revenue
generated by the representatives and others on his team.” Id. ¶ 69. These allegations fail for two
principal reasons. First, as discussed above, Nu Skin has repeatedly disclosed the very practices
that Plaintiffs accuse it of concealing. Second, these facts are publicly known, and Chinese
regulators have not found them to violate Chinese law.
Previous public disclosures render any subsequent statements regarding, or
omissions of, that information immaterial as a matter of law. See, e.g., Slater, 719 F.3d at 1197;
Grossman, 120 F.3d at 1119. For example, in Slater, plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that a company
had failed to disclose its exposure to the deterioration of mortgage-backed loans in a stock
offering document. See 719 F.3d at 1199-1200. The Tenth Circuit rejected the argument,
finding no material omission because the company’s prior 10-Qs, issued prior to the stock
offering, informed investors that defendant held billions of dollars of such assets. Id. at 1200-01.
The court also made clear that the prior disclosures need not be identical to the alleged

-30-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 38 of 67

omissions, but rather that “the only information that was needed . . . was that [defendant] actually
had direct exposure to that market; more detailed information was not necessary or required.”
Id. at 1201.
Here, Nu Skin has disclosed for years that the salaries of its Sales Employees are
based on various factors relating to their duties, including, among others, “the sales productivity
of an individual and the group of individuals whom he or she trains and supervises.”
Statement of Facts ¶ 7 (emphasis added). As set forth in detail above, Nu Skin disclosed its use
of group productivity in setting salaries for Sales Employees in China in every quarterly and
annual report during the purported class period, in public statements rebutting the Citron Report,
and in other statements to investors and analysts. See id. Defendant Wood also made a number
of public statements regarding the matter. Id. Moreover, Nu Skin affirmatively disclosed the
risk of future enforcement based specifically on this element of its compensation model in China.
Id. (“our business would be harmed by any determination that our current method of
compensating our employed sales representatives . . . including our use of the sales productivity
of an individual and the group of individuals whom he or she trains and supervises . . . violates
the restriction on multi-level compensation”). Because Plaintiffs cannot allege falsity where the
allegedly omitted facts were disclosed, claims based on this omission theory should be
dismissed. See Slater, 719 F.3d at 1197; Kapur, 2008 WL 2901705, at *9. 16

16

To the extent that Plaintiffs contend Nu Skin China compensated Sales Employees not
only based on group productivity, but through a direct 5% commission on downline sales, those
allegations rest entirely on the conclusory, hearsay statements of a handful of confidential
witnesses who never even allege that they themselves provided or received downline
commissions. Because such allegations lack sufficient indicia of reliability, they are not
actionable. See infra § II.D.

-31-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 39 of 67

Furthermore, as set forth above, following a months-long investigation into
numerous aspects of Nu Skin’s business in China, including its compensation practices, the
Chinese government issued detailed findings that included no finding of pyramid selling, the
payment of multi-level commissions, or any other illegal compensation practices. Statement of
Facts ¶¶ 25-26. Nu Skin cannot be held liable for failing to disclose the illegality of its
compensation practices when those practices have been publicly disclosed by Nu Skin, were
further brought to the attention of investors and Chinese regulators by short sellers, market
analysts, and the People’s Daily, were investigated, and were never found to be illegal. 17
2.

Plaintiffs Allege No Specific Facts Showing the Use of Group
Productivity in Setting Compensation of Direct Sellers.

Plaintiffs next contend that Nu Skin China compensated its Direct Sellers based
on group productivity. Nu Skin agrees that it cannot compensate its Direct Sellers in China in
this manner. However, Plaintiffs have not pled falsity for this allegation for the simple reason
that Plaintiffs fail to allege any specific facts that support this claim, relying instead on
boilerplate assertions. See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 59 (“Notwithstanding China’s rules against
paying multi-level compensation, Defendants promised to not only allow multi-level
compensation to its Executive Distributors hailing from outside of Mainland China but to all of
the direct sellers recruited by those living in Mainland China.”).
Plaintiffs’ confidential witnesses do not support a claim that Nu Skin paid its
Direct Sellers based on group productivity. First, none of the confidential witnesses is alleged to
17

If Plaintiffs are suggesting that the existence of an investigation requires the court to infer
illegal conduct, the subsequent termination of those investigations without findings supporting
Plaintiffs’ allegations “effectively negat[es]” any such inference. See, e.g., City of Austin Police
Ret. Sys. v. ITT Educ. Serv., Inc., 388 F. Supp. 2d 932, 941-42 (S.D. Ind. 2005).

-32-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 40 of 67

have been a Direct Seller. Second, none of Plaintiffs’ confidential witnesses ever specifically
references Direct Seller compensation or claims that Direct Sellers are paid based on group
productivity. Finally, none of the confidential witnesses claims to be in a position to know how
Direct Sellers (as opposed to its Sales Employees) were compensated in China. 18
Similarly, the documents cited in the Amended Complaint do not support falsity.
The only document cited that addresses this issue clearly states that “Direct Sellers will not get
paid in any form on the sales volume of other Direct Sellers and Sales Employees.” Id. ¶ 73
(emphasis in original). The other two documents referenced by Plaintiffs make no statement
about compensation to Direct Sellers by Nu Skin China. See id., Exs. C-D. 19
3.

Plaintiffs Fail to Allege That The Marketing Efforts of Sales
Employees Conducted Outside of Fixed Retail Stores Constitute
Unlicensed Direct Selling.

Finally, Plaintiffs assert that Nu Skin’s public statements were false and
misleading because Nu Skin violated Chinese law by allowing its many thousands of Sales
Employees (who admittedly do not have direct selling licenses) to market Nu Skin’s products to
customers outside of Nu Skin’s fixed retail stores and then “take their customers to the retail
18

See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 60, 67-78 (citing two U.S. “Independent Distributors,” a “Sales
Manager” (i.e., a Sales Employee), multiple “Sales Representatives,” an “Analyst,” a “Sales
Support Representative,” and a “Marketing Specialist,” none of whom had any involvement in
direct selling or overseeing the compensation of Direct Sellers, and none of whom discusses
compensation of Direct Sellers). As discussed below, statements from confidential witnesses
who had no involvement in, or knowledge of, compensation of Direct Sellers in China are
entitled to minimal weight, at best. See, e.g., Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d
981, 995-96 (9th Cir. 2009) (declining to credit witnesses who “were simply not positioned to
know the information alleged”).
19

Moreover, Plaintiffs are again asking this Court to do that which Chinese regulators have
not: find that Nu Skin’s compensation of its Direct Sellers violates China’s anti-pyramid
regulations. See Statement of Facts ¶¶ 25-26.

-33-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 41 of 67

stores to complete the sales transaction.” Am. Compl. ¶ 78. But Nu Skin has never claimed that
its China Sales Employees limit their marketing efforts to its retail stores. To the contrary, Nu
Skin has consistently disclosed that its Sales Employees in China sell products “through”—not
“at”—“fixed locations.” Id. ¶ 64 (citing 2011 10-K); Statement of Facts ¶ 3. Nu Skin has even
touted the fact that marketing by its Sales Employees comprises a major part of its business
strategy in China:
We rely on our sales force to market and sell products at the various retail
locations supported by only minimal advertising and traditional promotional
efforts . . . . Our retail model in China is largely based upon our ability to attract
customers to our retail stores through our sales force [and] to educate them
about our products through frequent training meetings . . . .
Statement of Facts ¶ 3 (quoting Ex. A, 2011 10-K at 10) (emphasis added). Given the fact that
Nu Skin’s business is based primarily on face-to-face interactions with customers, investors
unquestionably understood that Sales Employees speak with customers in the field, attract them
to retail stores, and complete transactions inside those stores. 20 Moreover, the government did
not find this practice to violate Chinese law during its recent in-depth investigation. 21

20

Indeed, Plaintiffs’ own allegations show that it would be absurd to suggest all of Nu Skin
China’s tens of thousands of Sales Employees operated solely within retail stores at all times. As
explained above, Nu Skin China had roughly 12,000 Sales Employees for just 40 stores, an
average of three hundred employee for every store. See Statement of Facts ¶ 2 n.7. In
combination with Nu Skin’s disclosures that its Sales Employees interacted with customers in
the field, but that sales transactions occurred in retail stores, these figures alone render Plaintiffs’
suggestion that Nu Skin did not disclose that its Sales Employees in China promoted and
marketed its products outside of its retail locations utterly implausible.
21

Finally, Plaintiffs appear to contend that Nu Skin’s statements that it believed it was
complying with applicable Chinese laws were false and misleading. See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 99.
However, these statements were forward-looking expressions of belief about how China’s
government would interpret the applicable regulations, accompanied by meaningful cautionary
language. See, e.g., id. (“Although management believes that the Company is in compliance . . .
no assurance can be given that the Company’s compliance with applicable statutes, laws, rules

B.

The Amended Complaint Engages in Impermissible “Puzzle Pleading.”
Even if Plaintiffs had adequately pled a false statement or omission of material

fact, however, the Amended Complaint should still be dismissed for impermissible “puzzle
pleading.” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires a complaint to contain “a short and
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” As courts in this
circuit have noted, “excerpt[ing] long passages including numerous statements” and then setting
forth a series of reasons why these statements are false, without sufficiently identifying the
aspects of the statements alleged to be false and/or misleading or the reasons that each such
statement is allegedly actionable, constitutes impermissible puzzle pleading. In re Level 3
Commc’ns, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 09–cv–00200, 2010 WL 5129524, at *9 (D. Colo. Dec. 10,
2010), aff’d, In re Level 3 Commc’ns, Inc. Secs. Litig., 667 F.3d 1331 (10th Cir. 2012)). 22

and regulations will not be challenged by foreign authorities . . . .”). These statements are
protected by the PSLRA safe harbor and cannot form the basis for liability. See § 78u–
5(c)(1)(A)–(B). Moreover, in light of the recently completed Chinese investigation, these
statements have not been shown to be materially false.
22

For example, in Level 3 Commc’ns, plaintiffs included a series of long block quotes—
with portions bolded and italicized for emphasis—followed by paragraphs setting forth multiple
reasons why the group of statements cited were allegedly false and/or misleading. See, e.g., Ex.
Z (No. 1:09–cv–00200, Dkt. No. 100 (Amended Complaint)) ¶¶ 54-70 (false statements
regarding company’s integration of an acquisition); id. ¶¶ 71-77 (false statements relating to
progression of merger and expertise in relevant field). While certain alleged bases for falsity
clearly corresponded to certain statements, the court nonetheless found that this “puzzle
pleading” was an improper means of pleading a claim, holding that this approach “leaves the
court to the task of teasing out which specific statements are at issue” overall. Level 3, 2010 WL
5129524, at *9. Similarly, in In re Alamosa Holdings, Inc., 382 F. Supp. 2d 832, 857-58 (N.D.
Tex. 2005), a consolidated case involving the firm serving as Lead Counsel in this action (as well
as other plaintiffs and counsel), plaintiffs again excerpted a series of long block quotes, with
portions emphasized, and with each set of statements again followed by bullet points containing
a half dozen reasons for falsity. See, e.g., Ex. AA (Case No. 5:03-cv-289, Dkt. No. 30
(Complaint)) ¶¶ 77-86. Even though it was apparent that plaintiffs in that case—as here—
contended that the statements were misleading because the company’s performance was based

The Amended Complaint here presents a classic case of puzzle pleading. Over
roughly sixty pages, Plaintiffs list literally dozens of different statements and omissions that they
then link to a laundry list of alleged reasons for falsity in only the vaguest of terms. 23 Because
Plaintiffs’ approach leaves it to this Court, and Defendants, to speculate as to which of the
various rationales for alleged falsity are applicable to which statements, Plaintiffs’ amended
claims should be dismissed as impermissible puzzle pleading. See, e.g., Level 3, 2010 WL
5129524, at *9, *12; Alamosa, 382 F. Supp. 2d at 857-58.
II.

Plaintiffs Fail to Meet Their Heavy Burden of Pleading Facts Giving Rise to a
Strong Inference of Scienter.
Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint also fails for the separate reason that they have

failed to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. As this Court recently held:
With regard to the element of scienter, the PSLRA requires that plaintiffs alleging
securities fraud must “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that
on illegal conduct, the court dismissed, finding that, “[h]owever easy the puzzle, assembling
puzzles is not the duty of the Court . . . . The Court will not waste its resources attempting to
construe which statements are actionable and why each is actionable.” In re Alamosa, 382 F.
Supp. 2d at 857-58; accord, e.g., Alizadeh v. Tellabs, Inc., No. 13 C 537, 2014 WL 2726676, at
*5 (N.D. Ill. June 16, 2014) (dismissing puzzle pleading complaint “because it requires the Court
and the defendant to piece together exactly which statements Plaintiffs are challenging and what
allegations contradict those statements”); Constr. Workers Pension Fund v. Navistar Int’l Corp.,
No. 13 C 2111, 2014 WL 3610877, at *5-*6 (N.D. Ill. July 22, 2014) (dismissing complaint
where “[m]any of the Consolidated Amended Complaint’s paragraphs include block quotes, with
liberal use of bold and italics, leaving Defendants and the Court to speculate which statements or
parts of statements [plaintiff] alleges are inaccurate . . . . [A]fter quoting [the relevant statements]
at length, [plaintiff] merely sets out . . . that these statements were false and misleading for a
laundry list of reasons . . . .”).
23

See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 92 (“The statements identified in ¶¶ 83-86, 88 . . . 89 regarding
Nu Skin’s business growth in Mainland China were false and materially misleading because the
following facts were known by Defendants but concealed from the investing public . . . .”); id.
¶ 101 (“The statements identified in ¶¶ 93-96, 99 regarding Nu Skin’s business in Mainland
China were false and materially misleading for the reasons set forth in ¶ 92.”).

the defendants acted with the required state of mind” . . . . A complaint will survive[]
only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as
compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.’”
Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 324 . . . .
The requisite “scienter” for a § 10(b) claim is “a mental state embracing intent to
deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 319. Proof of recklessness
is sufficient to establish a § 10(b) claim. In this context, a defendant acts
recklessly when his or her conduct amounts to an extreme departure from the
standards of ordinary care, and presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers
which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must
have been aware of the danger. City of Philadelphia v. Fleming Companies, Inc.
264 F.3d 1245, 1260 (10th Cir. 2001). In the context of a claim based on nondisclosure of material facts, a plaintiff must show that the defendant 1) knew of
the material fact; and 2) knew that failure to reveal the fact likely would mislead
investors. Id. at 1261.
In re Zagg Sec. Litig., 2:12-CV-852, 2014 WL 505152, at *5 (D. Utah Feb. 7, 2014) (emphasis
added) (citations omitted) (Benson, J.). “The pleading rule for scienter is ‘stringent,’” Kapur,
2008 WL 2901705, at *11 (citations omitted), and scienter allegations based merely on motive
and opportunity—such as those on which Plaintiffs rely almost exclusively here—“are typically
not sufficient in themselves to establish a strong inference of scienter.” See id. (quoting Fleming,
264 F.3d at 1262).
Because the standard for pleading scienter is so high, conclusory and boilerplate
scienter allegations cannot suffice. See, e.g., Weinstein, 2014 WL 3057190, --- F.3d ----, at *3
(rejecting pleading with “little . . . to support the conclusory allegation that these allegedly
misleading omissions and statements were motivated by the intent to defraud or by a reckless
disregard”); Anderson v. First Sec. Corp., 249 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1266(D. Utah 2002) (dismissing
where “Plaintiffs’ scienter allegations [we]re conclusory and ha[d] no supporting facts that any
corporate officer directed the decision . . . or knew anything about it”).

-37-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 45 of 67

Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendants accountable for alleged violations of law
that the Chinese government, following its investigation, failed to substantiate. Indeed, Plaintiffs
never allege scienter based on purported management awareness of the actual conduct that the
Chinese government found in violation of its regulations (i.e., lack of adequate scientific support
for certain product claims and direct sale of certain products only authorized for sale in retail
stores). On this basis alone, the Amended Complaint fails.
Additionally, the nature of the allegations in question (i.e., failure to disclose a
violation of foreign law) strongly militates against a finding of scienter. For example, in Board
of Trustees of City of Ft. Lauderdale Gen. Employees’ Ret. Sys. v. Mechel OAO, 811 F. Supp. 2d
853, 870 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), plaintiffs alleged that defendant’s disclosures were misleading
because the company failed to disclose that its results were enhanced by its violation of Russia’s
anti-monopoly laws. Plaintiffs did not allege facts showing that the company’s senior
management knew its activities were illegal, id., and defendant had disclosed in its public filings
that the relevant anti-monopoly provisions were “‘vague in certain parts and subject to varying
interpretations.’” See id. at 876. The court held that plaintiff failed to plead scienter, given that
“the far more compelling inference is that Defendants simply failed to anticipate [the relevant
agency’s] evolving interpretation of a facially vague statute of recent vintage with limited
judicial and regulatory precedent or guidance.” Id. at 882. 24 Here, where Nu Skin’s public
24

Accord, e.g., In re Open Joint Co. “Vimpel-Communc’ns” Sec. Litig., No. 04 Civ. 9742,
2006 WL 647981, at *7-*8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2006) (rejecting scienter claim based on finding
of tax evasion by Russian government, where “Russian tax laws present[ed] an uncertain
terrain,” and defendant had disclosed that “‘Russia’s federal and local tax laws and regulations
are subject to frequent change, varying interpretations and inconsistent enforcement’” and that
“‘uncertainty related to Russian tax laws exposes [the Company] to significant fines and
penalties and to enforcement measures’”) (quotation marks and alterations in original).
-38-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 46 of 67

disclosures similarly warned investors of the fluid and unpredictable regulatory environment, and
where, unlike in Mechel, Nu Skin has not been found to have committed the violations Plaintiffs
claim should have been disclosed, any inference of scienter is clearly outweighed by the far more
likely inference that Nu Skin and its management did not believe the company to be operating in
violation of Chinese anti-pyramid and multi-level compensation laws.
Moreover, the Amended Complaint lacks any specific facts suggesting that Nu
Skin’s management (including the individual defendants) was aware of or involved in any form
of alleged misconduct. Plaintiffs have failed to come forward with any documents or other
communications with management regarding these issues, or with any other facts suggesting
management knowledge of the alleged illegal activity. Instead, Plaintiffs assert four bases for
scienter: (1) the Company’s China operations are a core aspect of its business; (2) stock sales
made by individual defendants Hunt and Wood during the class period; (3) Hunt and Wood’s
overall compensation; and (4) statements and documents provided by confidential witnesses.
Each of these allegations is clearly inadequate under well-established case law in this Circuit. 25
A.

The “Core Operations” Theory Does Not Support a Finding of Scienter.
Plaintiffs first allege that, “[g]iven the exponentially growing size of Nu Skin’s

Chinese market, its critical importance to the growth of Nu Skin’s overall business, and its
potential to become the Company’s revenue life-blood, the illegal practices implemented by
Defendants for deployment in China could not have occurred without the Individual Defendants’

25

Plaintiffs also cite meetings that Hunt and Wood participated in with senior Chinese
government officials and their knowledge of applicable Chinese laws. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 79-82.
However, at most, these allegations show only that Hunt and Wood were aware of the existence
of the relevant laws—not that they were aware of the alleged violation of those laws.

-39-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 47 of 67

knowledge and approval.” Am. Compl. ¶ 248. This request that the Court simply assume the
existence of scienter fails as a matter of law.
First, courts routinely hold that the “core operations” theory provides minimal
support for a finding of scienter. See, e.g., Bricklayers of W. Penn. Pension Plan v. Hecla Min.
Co., No. 2:12–cv–00042–BLW, 2013 WL 5423875, at *4 (D. Id. Sept. 26, 2013) (noting this
theory “rarely succeeds” absent other evidence of scienter); Percoco v. Deckers Outdoor Corp.,
Civ. No. 12–1001–SLR, 2013 WL 3584370, at *5 (D. Del. 2013) (“Only in rare instances can
core operations alone allow inferences of scienter . . . .”). Indeed, it is only in the ‘“rare
circumstance’” where “the nature of the relevant facts . . . is ‘of such prominence that it would
be “absurd” to suggest that management was without knowledge of the matter’” that courts find
the theory at all persuasive. Prissert v. EMCORE Corp., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1364, 1372-73
(D.N.M. 2012) (quoting S. Ferry LP, # 2 v. Killinger, 542 F.3d 776, 786 (9th Cir. 2008)).
For example, in In re Gold Resource, plaintiffs alleged that defendants made
material misstatements about the company’s growth and production in its Mexican operations.
See, 957 F. Supp. 2d at 1287-88, 1299-1300. In that case, the company employed just seven
U.S. employees and more than three hundred in Mexico. Id. at 1287. Plaintiffs proffered as
evidence of scienter the fact that “the errors were related to core operations.” Id. at 1300. The
court rejected that argument, noting the mere fact that defendant was a “small-sized company”
could not constitute independent evidence of scienter, particularly where “‘the relevant personnel
are separated by nearly 2,000 miles and international borders.’” Id. at 1301. The court
concluded that plaintiffs could not just rely on the proportion of defendant’s business located in
the relevant area to presume scienter. Id. at 1301-02; accord, e.g., Tyler v. Liz Claiborne, Inc.,

-40-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 48 of 67

814 F. Supp. 2d 323, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (noting that “the operation in question [must]
constitute nearly all of a company’s business”).
Here, the alleged legal violations occurred at one Nu Skin subsidiary located
across the globe that comprised roughly 12% of Nu Skin’s total revenue in 2012 and 32% in
2013. See Ex. B (2012 10-K) at 7; Ex. C (2013 10-K) at 48. Given that Nu Skin generated more
than $2 billion in revenue in 2012 and over $3 billion in 2013, see Ex. B (2012 10-K) at 6; Ex. C
(2013 10-K) at 1, with business units throughout the world that each generate hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenue, Nu Skin China falls far short of comprising “nearly all of [Nu
Skin’s] business.” Tyler, 814 F. Supp. 2d at 343; see In re Gold, 957 F. Supp. 2d at 1300-01.
Moreover, even if China constituted an overwhelming percentage of Nu Skin’s
business during the class period (which it did not), the failure to predict how a regulator will
interpret uncertain and complex foreign laws cannot support a finding of scienter under a core
operations theory. See, e.g., Yates v. Mun. Mortg. & Equity, LLC, 744 F.3d 874, 889 (4th Cir.
2014) (rejecting core operations theory where errors were “not especially obvious” and
concerned complex accounting issue facing just one portion of one of defendant’s funds).
Mechel, discussed supra, provides another analogous example. In that case, the court held that,
even if it considered the relevant business unit to be a core operation, that did not mean that
plaintiff could plead scienter based on the mere fact that this business unit was ultimately found
to be violating Russian anti-monopoly law. Indeed, the Mechel court held that to interpret the
core operations doctrine to imply scienter whenever any issue arose in a core business would
impose “no cognizable limit” on the doctrine, which would “eviscerate the cogent and
compelling inference of scienter required by Tellabs.” Id. at 873.

B.

Defendants’ Stock Sales Do Not Raise a Strong Inference of Scienter.
The second basis for scienter proffered by Plaintiffs is that Hunt and Wood sold

$40 million of stock, in trades alleged to be “suspiciously-timed and out of line with their prior
trading practices,” and that, “[w]hile a large percentage . . . were made pursuant to 10b5-1
plans,” the circumstances were “sufficiently suspicious to overwhelm any inference that they
were made in good faith.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 249-50, 260. None of these facts supports an
inference of scienter.
1.

Defendants’ Trades Were Made Pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Plans.

First, it cannot be disputed here that 10 of the 11 trades relied on by Plaintiffs
were made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. Ex. BB (Form 4s summary). 26 It is well established
in this and other circuits that trades made pursuant to 10b-5 plans generally do not provide strong
evidence of scienter. See, e.g., Elam v. Neidorff, 544 F.3d 921, 928 (8th Cir. 2008) (“Stock sales
pursuant to Rule 10b-5 trading plans can raise an inference that the sales were prescheduled and
not suspicious.”); Garden City Employees’ Ret. Sys. v. Anixter Int’l, Inc., 09-CV-5641, 2012 WL
1068761, at *13 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29, 2012) (“Defendants’ stock sales were made pursuant to a
10b–5 trading plan, adopted before the sale, which negates an inference of scienter”).
For example, in Level 3, plaintiffs asserted as a basis for scienter that “certain
defendants engaged in sales of their personal holdings of Level 3 stock and that these defendants
had not traded any Level 3 shares in the prior two years.” 667 F. 3d at 1346. Despite this

26

The single non-10b5-1 plan sale during the class period was Hunt’s sale of 50,000 shares
(7% of his overall holdings during the class period) on February 13, 2013 at $42/share. See id.
As set forth in detail below, Nu Skin’s stock price increased by approximately 350% following
this sale and prior to the end of the purported class period.

-42-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 50 of 67

marked change in trading habits, the Tenth Circuit rejected plaintiffs’ contention, noting that “the
sales were made pursuant to ‘automatic transactions’ set up prior to the class period to pay
withholding taxes that became due” and that Defendants retained substantial holdings after the
sales. Id. The court concluded that “[t]hese considerations rebut any inference of scienter we
might otherwise draw regarding these sales.” Id. at 1346-47. 27
Here, it is undisputed that all but one of the trades at issue were preapproved, and
Plaintiffs proffer no facts calling into question the timing, mechanism, or structure of
Defendants’ Rule 10b5-1 trading patterns. Plaintiffs’ suggestion that automatic trades outside
the control of the individual defendants, over a period of three years, were somehow inherently
“suspicious” is simply inconsistent with the law of this circuit. Level 3, 667 F. 3d at 1346.
2.

Defendants’ Sales Were Routine and Consistent With Historical
Trading Patterns.

Even if these trades had not been preapproved, however, Plaintiffs’ own
allegations show that there is nothing suspicious about Defendants’ sales during the class period.
The trades occurred over an inordinately long period of time, were consistent with historical
trading patterns, and largely occurred well before the stock peaked.
Courts have repeatedly noted that multi-year class periods such as the purported
class period in this case, involving a small number of trades that are made in line with historical
practices, do not support a finding of scienter. See Yates, 744 F.3d at 891 (noting that plaintiffs’

27

Similarly, in Yates, plaintiffs alleged defendants sold substantially more shares during the
class period than the control period. 744 F.3d at 891. In declining to find scienter on this basis,
the court noted that “[t]he fact that [defendants] traded . . . under non-discretionary Rule 10b5–1
plans further weakens any inference of fraudulent purpose.” Id. Indeed, even though one
defendant had created his plan after the start of the class period, allegations showing nothing
more than prearranged trades still “mitigate[d] any inference of improper motive.” Id.
-43-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 51 of 67

“inordinately long [class] period of 44 months . . . makes it difficult to infer intent from the mere
fact of a stock sale, as it is not unusual for insiders to trade at some point during their tenure with
a company.”); Teachers’ Ret. Sys. of La. v. Hunter, 477 F.3d 162, 185 (4th Cir. 2007) (rejecting
claim that even large stock sales made in “exceedingly long” 46-month period were suspicious);
In re Dell, Inc. Sec. Litig., 591 F. Supp. 2d 877, 897 (W.D. Tex. 2008) (sales of “large number of
shares” not probative of scienter where period four years long, with trading consistent over time).
As Plaintiffs concede, Defendants collectively made fewer than a dozen trades
during the three-year class period (four by Defendant Hunt and seven by Defendant Wood). Am.
Compl. ¶ 253. Moreover, all of these trades were consistent with Defendants’ trading history.
Indeed, viewed as a percentage of Defendants’ holdings, Hunt and Wood actually sold fewer
shares during the class period than during the three-year control period proposed by Plaintiffs
themselves. Id. ¶ 251; see Ex. BB (Form 4s summary) (Hunt sold 57.70% of his shares owned
during class period, compared to 63.82% of his shares during control period, while Wood sold
89.11% of his shares owned during class period, compared to 92.21% during control period).
The consistency of Hunt’s and Wood’s trading patterns strongly undercuts any inference—let
alone a strong inference—of scienter. See, e.g., Constr. Laborers Pension Trust of Greater St.
Louis v. Neurocrine Bioscis., Inc., No. 07CV1111, 2008 WL 2053733, at *7 (S.D. Cal. May 13,
2008) (rejecting scienter allegation where each individual defendant “sold less . . . stock during
the class period than in” either of the preceding two years); In re Travelzoo Inc. Sec. Litig., 11
Civ. 5531 GBD, 2013 WL 1287342, at *10 and n.9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2013) (sale of even 95%
of holdings not suspicious, where defendant sold 50% of holdings before class period).
Finally, the sales in question occurred at times that were far from suspicious. Nu

-44-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 52 of 67

Skin’s share price more than tripled during the class period. However, all but one of the
individual defendants’ sales occurred at times when Nu Skin’s share price was at the low end of
its range during the class period, and far closer in price to the prevailing price during the control
period than during the class period. For example, Hunt’s sales ranged from $40-$42 per share,
with the last sale occurring in February 2013, before the stock price subsequently peaked at $140
in early 2014. Ex. BB (Form 4s summary); Ex. CC (stock price chart). Similarly, except for one
trade, Wood’s sales topped out at $59.75, less than half of the stock’s high, and, even after a lone
trade by Wood at $125.39 in December 2013, he still retained nearly 37,000 shares, worth many
millions of dollars. See id.
The below chart summarizes Hunt and Wood’s trades in comparison to the stock
price movement before and during the class period:

Defendants also attach hereto as Exhibit CC a graph similarly depicting the fact that the vast
majority of the trades at issue occurred near the start of the class period, and at a time when the
stock price was much closer to the control period than it was to its ultimate peak in early 2014.
It defies credulity to suggest that Hunt and Wood traded on insider knowledge
when they sold shares over several years, largely prior to the subsequent dramatic increase in
share price, and in a manner not significantly different from their trading history. See, e.g., In re

Plaintiffs’ third scienter allegation is that “[t]he Individual Defendants’

compensation structure at Nu Skin emphasizes incentive-based payoffs,” including a base salary,
bonus, stock awards, options awards, cash awards, and other compensation, and that “[t]he
Individual Defendants knew that disclosing the true nature of Nu Skin’s MLM business in China
would have led to serious regulatory problems, distributor attrition, lost sales and reduced stock
prices immediately, thus impairing their incentive compensation component where they made
most of their money.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 268, 271.
Courts in this Circuit and across the country have repeatedly rejected the
suggestion that management compensation can give rise to a strong inference of scienter, holding
that these types of incentives are always present. For example, in Level 3, plaintiff argued that
incentive-based stock options supported a finding of scienter. The Tenth Circuit rebuffed that
contention, finding that “[t]his type of incentive-based compensation . . . is common among
executives at publicly traded companies and does not ordinarily indicate scienter.” 667 F.3d at

29

Plaintiffs also allege no suspicious trading by management or directors other than Hunt
and Wood, further undercutting any suggestion of scienter. See Yates, 744 F.3d at 890.

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 55 of 67

1346. Similarly, in City of Philadelphia, plaintiffs attempted to show scienter by, inter alia,
alleging a motive “to ‘protect and enhance their executive positions and the substantial
compensation and prestige they obtained thereby;’ and . . . to enhance the value of their own . . .
stock.” 264 F.3d at 1256. The Tenth Circuit again declined to adopt that argument, finding that
“motives . . . that Defendants desired to protect their own positions with the company and the
value of their own . . . stock [] are also insufficient, as again they are motives shared by all
company executives.” Id. at 1269. 30
Here, as in each of these cases, Plaintiffs allege nothing more than that Hunt and
Wood received substantial salaries, bonuses, and stock- and cash-based compensation during the
class period. These facts fail to give rise to an inference of scienter as a matter of law.
D.

Plaintiffs’ “Confidential Witnesses” and Purported Nu Skin Documents Do
Not Support Any Finding of Scienter.
Finally, Plaintiffs’ use of confidential witness statements and two purported (but

not authenticated) Company documents fail to give rise an inference of scienter, both because the
sources are unreliable and because the information in them is irrelevant to Plaintiffs’ allegations.
At the outset, it is important to note that courts in this Circuit are generally
suspicious of confidential witnesses. For example, in FX Energy, plaintiffs alleged that
optimistic predictions made by an energy company concerning two of its drilling projects were
30

Numerous courts are in accord. See, e.g., Grossman v. Novell, 909 F. Supp. 845, 851 (D.
Utah 1995) (“[Plaintiff’s] argument that the individual defendants wanted to keep their jobs and
maintain their stature in the community is legally insufficient to establish motive to commit
fraud. Those desires are nearly universal in our society.”); Wolfe v. Aspenbio Pharma, Inc., No.
11–cv–00165, 2012 WL 4040344, at *9 n.20 (D. Colo. Sept. 13, 2012) (“The allegedly ‘very
high’ salaries of the other individual defendants are not sufficient to support the required
inference of scienter.”); In re Dell, 591 F. Supp. 2d at 897-98 (salary, short-term bonuses, and
long-term bonuses merited little weight in scienter analysis and were not “surprising or
suspicious”).
-48-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 56 of 67

false, because defendants omitted evidence that the data was unreliable and other information
contradicting these optimistic assessments. 2009 WL 1812828, at *1-*4. One of plaintiffs’
bases for pleading scienter was a confidential witness, “who allegedly informed Defendants that
[the wells in question] were bad prospects.” Id. at *10. Judge Waddoups first noted that this
witness might “‘have axes to grind’ . . . be ‘lying[,]’ or maybe ‘[doesn’t] even exist.’” Id. at 10
(quoting Higginbotham v. Baxter Int’l, Inc., 495 F.3d 753, 757 (7th Cir. 2007)). The court then
explained that it was “reasonable to apply a steep ‘discount’ to Plaintiffs’ unnamed source,”
particularly where “the complaint d[id] not make clear to whom the witness spoke, when the
conversations occurred, or what was said in response to the witness.” Id. 31
Courts in this and other Circuits give scant weight to confidential witness
statements where (i) the complaint fails to demonstrate the personal knowledge of those
witnesses; (ii) the statements are conclusory or rely on hearsay or speculation; and/or (iii) the
statements were not demonstrably made to Company management. For example, in Kapur,
defendant, a multi-level marketing company, was accused of operating a pyramid scheme. 2008
WL 2901705, at *1-*2. Plaintiffs relied on confidential witnesses who made statements about
the company’s product quality and its sales and recruiting tactics. Id. at *2-*3. The complaint
described each witness by title and role, including a “senior-level finance manager” who claimed

31

These concerns about confidential witnesses’ reliability are more than hypothetical. See
In re BankAtl. Bancorp, Inc. Sec. Litig., 851 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1313-14 (S.D. Fla. 2011), aff’d
sub nom. Hubbard v. BankAtl. Bancorp, Inc., 503 F. App’x 677 (11th Cir. 2012) (sanctioning
lead counsel in this case under Rule 11 for failing to make a reasonable inquiry into one specific
confidential witness statement that the court ultimately determined lacked sufficient evidentiary
support, which “a reasonable inquiry by counsel would have revealed”). During discovery in
that case, other confidential witnesses relied on by the same firm also contradicted statements
attributed to them in the pleadings. See generally id. at 1310-12.

-49-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 57 of 67

certain documents were regularly sent to and discussed with senior management. Id. at *3.
Judge Kimball refused to rely on these confidential witnesses to show either falsity or scienter.
For example, the court refused to credit a confidential witness statement that he or she had heard
from other employees that consumers were not happy with the products, finding that “sole
reliance on a conclusory statement, notably based on hearsay, of a confidential witness is
insufficient to satisfy the PSLRA particularity requirement.” Id. at *16. Further, even the
confidential witness statement indicating that management regularly received and discussed
certain reports fell short, absent evidence that these reports actually revealed the alleged pyramid
scheme. Id. at *17.
Here, as in those decisions, the statements of Plaintiffs’ confidential witnesses do
not meet the heightened pleading burden under the PSLRA. First, all ten of Plaintiffs’
confidential witnesses are low-level employees, not members of management. Plaintiffs do not
allege that any of the confidential witnesses ever spoke with or provided documents to
management, or had any personal knowledge whatsoever of corporate policy or practice within
Nu Skin China. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 67-78. For this reason alone, even crediting everything these
witnesses said as true, their statements have no probative value in showing management’s state
of mind and are therefore irrelevant to the Court’s scienter inquiry. See, e.g., In re Cisco Sys.
Inc. Sec. Litig., No. C 11–1568 SBA, 2013 WL 1402788, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2013)
(“Plaintiffs rely on confidential witness statements to show . . . that Defendants were aware that
Cisco was facing a litany of issues . . . . Yet, there are no facts alleging that any of the
confidential witnesses had direct contact with either [defendant CEO or CFO] . . . .
Consequently, the statements of the confidential witnesses are insufficient to establish a strong

-50-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 58 of 67

inference of scienter.”); In re Am. Apparel, Inc. S’holder Litig., No. CV 10–06352, 2013 WL
174119, *18 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 16, 2013) (rejecting confidential witness statements where plaintiffs
did “not link the [alleged conduct] to those higher up in the company”); In re Citigroup Inc. Sec.
Litig., 753 F. Supp. 2d 206, 245 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“Fatal to plaintiffs’ claims, however, is that
they do not allege with specificity that any of the confidential witnesses relied upon in the
Complaint presented information to the individual defendants.”). 32
The confidential witness allegations also rely entirely on conclusory or hearsay
assertions that fail to establish their own first-hand knowledge. For example, while several
confidential witnesses allege that Nu Skin China sales personnel received commissions based on
the sales of others, no confidential witness actually alleges that he or she ever paid or received
such a commission. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 67-71. Moreover, most of these statements come from
low-level employees who worked for Nu Skin for very brief time periods (i.e., four months to a
year), with no facts showing any of these witnesses had personal knowledge of broader policies
or practices across Nu Skin China. The allegations therefore lack sufficient indicia of reliability,
a separate and independent reason that they do not support a finding of scienter. See, e.g.,
Kapur, 2008 WL 2901705, at *16 (“sole reliance on a conclusory statement, notably based on
hearsay, of a confidential witness is insufficient to satisfy the PSLRA particularity
requirement”); Zucco, 552 F. 3d at 996 (rejecting statements from witnesses who were “simply
32

Accord, e.g., Szymborski v. Ormat Techs., Inc., 776 F. Supp. 2d 1191, 1201 (D. Nev.
2011) (statements by confidential witnesses who were not alleged to have had contact with
management did not raise strong inference of scienter); Local 295/Local 851 IBT Employer Grp.
Pension Trust & Welfare Fund v. Fifth Third Bancorp., 731 F. Supp. 2d 689, 721 (S.D. Ohio
2010) (finding that confidential witness statement fails to establish scienter where “there are no
facts alleged from which it can be inferred that the confidential witness had sufficient contact
with any of the Defendants to impute their knowledge of misconduct to the Defendants”).

not positioned to know the information alleged,” “report[ed] only unreliable hearsay,” or
“allege[d] conclusory assertions of scienter”). 33
Finally, the two documents upon which Plaintiffs rely lack any: (i) authenticating
information; (ii) indicia that they were ever shared with Nu Skin management; (iii) indicia that
they are official Nu Skin documents or reflect Company policy; (iv) author or recipient
information; or (v) specific allegations regarding what they are or how they were used, other than
the naked assertion that they were “shared with potential recruits in China in early 2013.” Am.
Compl. ¶¶ 72 and n.22. Such vague and unauthenticated documents cannot support a finding of
scienter. See, e.g., Leventhal v. Tow, 48 F. Supp. 2d 104, 113 (D. Conn. 1999) (rejecting reliance
on internal memoranda that, inter alia, failed to establish any authors and recipients).
In sum, Plaintiffs’ confidential witness and documentary “evidence” of scienter is
unreliable and unconnected to Nu Skin management in Provo, Utah—halfway around the world
from China. This evidence does not support a strong inference of scienter.
III.

The Amended Complaint Fails Adequately to Allege Loss Causation.
Finally, the Amended Complaint fails to plead facts demonstrating loss

causation—i.e., that the alleged misrepresentations or omissions caused the alleged loss. Dura,
33

Other aspects of the statements are similarly deficient. See Am. Compl. ¶ 60
(“Independent Distributor” in San Francisco “is personally aware of the fact that a few of his
fellow independent distributors did expand their downlines into China,” but fails to explain basis
for awareness, which is likely hearsay); id. ¶ 67 (bald statement that “Nu Skin’s compensation
was similar to a pyramid,” with no explanation of its basis); id. ¶ 67 n.19 (assertion by
salesperson that no one he knew had direct selling licenses, with no explanation of who those
individuals were and no claim that any of them were held out as Direct Sellers rather than Sales
Employees); id. ¶¶ 68-71 (general statements about Nu Skin China’s compensation system, with
no facts showing personal knowledge); id. ¶ 75 (confidential witness stating that fellow
employees “let him know that there were downlines being set up in China” with no additional
details); id. ¶¶ 76-77 (conclusory or hearsay statements about creation of downlines in China).

-52-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 60 of 67

544 U.S. at 342. In pleading loss causation, Plaintiffs must allege a specific “causal connection
between the material misrepresentation and the loss.” Id. Plaintiffs must do more than simply
allege that the stock price was previously inflated as a result of a misrepresentation, because the
securities laws are not meant to “provide investors with broad insurance against market losses.”
Id. at 345.
Here, Plaintiffs point to three disclosures occurring between January 15-21, 2014
as the bases for loss causation: (1) the People’s Daily articles on January 15-16, Am. Compl.
¶ 286(b)-(c); (2) the announcement of Chinese government investigations of Nu Skin on January
16,” id. ¶ 286(c); and (3) Nu Skin’s January 21 8-K filing. Id. ¶ 286(d). Each of these
allegations fails under well-established law.
A.

The People’s Daily Articles Cannot Constitute Corrective Disclosures for
Two Independently Sufficient Reasons.
1.

Repackaging Publicly Available Information Does Not Establish Loss
Causation.

It is well-settled that publicly known information that has been repackaged in a
negative media or short-seller report cannot constitute an actionable corrective disclosure. For
example, in Meyer v. Greene, 710 F.3d 1189 (11th Cir. 2013), influential investor David Einhorn
made a negative presentation about a company, leading to a stock drop of “20% on unusually
high volume.” Id. at 1193. The court rejected the notion that this presentation constituted a
corrective disclosure and dismissed the case for lack of loss causation. Id. at 1200. The Court
explained that a restatement of publicly known facts could not constitute loss causation:
[The] material portions of the Einhorn Presentation were gleaned entirely
from public filings and other publicly available information . . . . Because
a corrective disclosure obviously must disclose new information, the fact
that the sources used in the Einhorn Presentation were already public is
-53-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 61 of 67

fatal . . . . [T]he mere repackaging of already-public information by an
analyst or short-seller is simply insufficient to constitute a corrective
disclosure . . . . [T]he decline in the value of [the company’s] shares in the
wake of the Einhorn Presentation was not due to the fact that the
presentation was revelatory of any fraud, but was instead due to changed
investor expectations after an investor who wielded great clout in the
industry voiced a negative opinion about the Company.
Id. at 1198-00 (emphasis in original); accord, e.g., Hunter, 477 F.3d at 186-87 (lawsuit by
former CEO could not support loss causation claim where “complaint disclose[d] nothing new,”
and decline likely occurred because allegations were repackaged by influential figure).
Here, Nu Skin’s stock price fell in January 2014 because an influential
newspaper, which Plaintiffs describe as the “mouthpiece for the PRC,” made the allegations, not
because the articles contained new, previously undisclosed information. Indeed, as shown
below, the People’s Daily articles merely repeat the 2012 Citron Report in all relevant respects
(Statement of Facts ¶¶ 16-21):
Substantive Allegation

Citron Allegations

People’s Daily Allegations

Operation of a Pyramid
Scheme

“What Nu Skin Actually Does:
Pyramid Selling”; Nu Skin China
“support[ed] the creation of a
multi-level pyramid
compensation scheme.”

Nu Skin China’s “personnel is
in pyramid or ladder-shaped
structure . . . . According to
national relevant laws, [Nu
Skin China’s] bonus system
and personnel composition are
suspected of pyramid
schemes.”

MLM Activities

Nu Skin China “is in fact
operating as an MLM,” and
“every new distributor has 6
uplines who help train the new
distributors,” with “every one of
your uplines . . . mak[ing a] 5%
commission from your sales.”

“‘Superiors’ may gain
commissions at 5% of the sales
of their ‘subordinate’; the main
source of the senior direct
distributor’s income is the
commissions on his
‘subordinate’s’ sales.”

-54-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 62 of 67

Product Buy-In

Nu Skin China “requir[ed]
purchases in order to participate
in sales commissions or salary.”

Nu Skin China required new
recruits “to purchase Nu Skin
products of 500 Yuan” in order
to become a salesperson.

False Product Claims

Nu Skin China made claims
regarding its ageLOC product
based on “pseudo-scien[ce]” and
falsely claimed endorsements
from a major scientist.

Nu Skin China made claims
about its ageLOC product that
were “totally made up” and
falsely claiming endorsements
from two major scientists.

Unrealistic Promises of
Wealth to New Recruits

Nu Skin China “promise[d]
unlimited riches for . . . new
recruit[s] to join the pyramid.”

Nu Skin China asked a reporter
if “you want to earn one million
Yuan in half a year.”

“Brainwashing”

Nu Skin China “engaged in
“[b]rainwashing and chanting
slogans.”

Nu Skin China implement[ed]
“mind control, so called
‘brainwashing.’”

As demonstrated above, the People’s Daily’s simple repackaging of facts or allegations already
disclosed by Citron (or facts disclosed by Nu Skin itself) cannot be a corrective disclosure. See
Meyer, 710 F.3d at 1198-00; Hunter, 477 F.3d at 186-87. Plaintiffs therefore cannot plead loss
causation based on Paragraph 286(b) of the Amended Complaint.
2.

Media Allegations That a Risk of Fraudulent Conduct Exists Do
Not Constitute a Corrective Disclosure.

Plaintiffs’ claim also fails because media reports suggesting a company may be
engaging in misconduct are not corrective disclosures. For example, in Bach v. Amedisys, Inc.,
10–395–BAJ–CN, 2012 WL 6947008 (W.D. La. Mar. 15, 2013), the court held that neither a
Citron Research report nor a Wall Street Journal article, each of which suggested that the
defendant had manipulated data in order to inflate Medicare billings, could constitute a
corrective disclosure. Id. at *4, *9-*10. The court found the Citron Research report contained
“no new disclosure of fraud or improper behavior . . . but only an opinion that the possibility of

-55-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 63 of 67

fraud exists and the issue should be investigated further.” Id. at *9. The court then concluded
that, “[t]o allow a securities fraud action to proceed on the basis of media speculation of fraud,
such as is alleged to have been presented by the Citron[] report[,] would require the Court to
expand securities law to insure investors against media allegations of possible risks.” Id. at *10.
The court similarly held that the Wall Street Journal article, which also included certain
additional allegations, could not constitute a corrective disclosure. Id.
Other courts have similarly found that even a growing chorus of media and
analyst reports speculating about misconduct does not constitute a corrective disclosure. See,
e.g., In re Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. Sec. Litig., 639 F. Supp. 2d 1038, 1045-46 (N.D. Cal.
2009) (finding articles regarding possible backdating insufficient and noting that “plaintiff must
identify disclosures revealing more than a ‘“risk” or “potential” for widespread fraudulent
conduct’”) (quoting Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., 540 F.3d 1049, 1063–64
(9th Cir. 2008)); Janbay v. Canadian Solar, Inc., 10 CIV. 4430, 2012 WL 1080306, at *16
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2012) (“[T]he raising of questions and speculation by analysts and
commentators does not reveal any ‘truth’ about an alleged fraud . . . .”).
Here, the People’s Daily articles did not reveal facts proving widespread
misconduct at Nu Skin China, but rather suspected misconduct based on scattered witness
statements and documents. Am. Compl., Ex. E at 12 (“According to national relevant laws, such
bonus system and personnel composition are suspected of pyramid schemes.”); id., Ex. F at 9
(“The reporter discovers in the investigation that some parts of Nu Skin’s business model and
hierarchical structure are suspected of violation of national laws.”); id. at 10 (Nu Skin China
“suspected of ‘brainwashing’”) (all emphasis added). And the investigation prompted by those

-56-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 64 of 67

articles failed to substantiate those suspicions in all relevant respects. Because these speculative
allegations thus identify nothing more than a “risk” that the Chinese government would find
widespread illegality, these allegations cannot support the loss causation claimed in Paragraph
286(b) of the Amended Complaint. Bach, 2012 WL 6947008, at *9-*10.
B.

Announcement of a Government Investigation Cannot Constitute a
Corrective Disclosure.
Plaintiffs similarly cannot rely on the January 16 announcement of Chinese

government investigations to establish loss causation. Well-established case law holds that
disclosure of a government inquiry cannot be a corrective disclosure. See, e.g., Durham v.
Whitney Info. Network, Inc., 06-CV-00687, 2009 WL 3783375, at *20-*21 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 10,
2009) (announcement of SEC investigation not a corrective disclosure); In re Almost Family,
Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 3:10-cv-00520, 2012 WL 443461, at *13 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 10, 2012)
(“Numerous federal district courts have held that a disclosure of an investigation, absent an
actual revelation of fraud, is not a corrective disclosure.”). While “stock prices may fall upon the
announcement of an SEC investigation . . . that is because the investigation can be seen to
portend an added risk of future corrective action,” not because “the investigations, in and of
themselves, reveal to the market that a company’s previous statements were false or fraudulent.”
Meyer, 710 F.3d at 1201. Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot rely on the January 16 announcement of
Chinese government investigations as a basis for pleading loss causation.
C.

Nu Skin China’s 8-K Was Not a Corrective Disclosure Because It Did Not
Reveal Any Violation of Chinese Law.
Finally, Plaintiffs cannot rely on Nu Skin’s January 21 8-K as evidence of loss

causation, because, contrary to Plaintiffs’ claim, that disclosure does not admit that Nu Skin

-57-

Case 2:14-cv-00033-JNP-BCW Document 53 Filed 08/29/14 Page 65 of 67

violated China’s regulations on direct selling. See Am. Compl. ¶ 219. 34 Instead, Nu Skin’s 8-K
merely stated, “during our recent rapid growth, there were instances where some of our sales
people failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations.” See id. (emphasis
added). Because Plaintiffs’ claims here depend on a finding that Nu Skin violated Chinese law,
not the Company’s policies and regulations, the 8-K was not a corrective disclosure and cannot
establish loss causation. Moreover, Nu Skin’s stock price fell just 2.6% following issuance of
the 8-K, Am. Compl. ¶ 220, further undercutting any notion of loss causation based on that
release.
***
In sum, loss causation requires a corrective disclosure. Here, where Nu Skin has
not admitted to violating either China’s anti-pyramid or its multi-level commission laws, and
where the Chinese government has investigated Nu Skin and has found no such violations, there
can be no such disclosure. Plaintiffs’ attempt to rely on media speculation, the announcement of
an investigation, and the Company’s statements about compliance with its own policies (not
compliance with law) cannot substitute for an actual corrective disclosure. Accordingly, the
Amended Complaint should be dismissed for failure to allege loss causation.
IV.

Plaintiffs’ Control Person Claim Falls With Their Substantive § 10(b) Claim.
For the reasons set out above, Plaintiffs’ claim under § 10(b) of the Securities Act

fails as a matter of law. “Because plaintiff[s’] complaint does not allege a primary violation of

34

As set out above, while Nu Skin’s 8-K announced voluntary measures such as
temporarily suspending sales meetings in response to the investigation, those measures were not
based on any finding or acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the Company and may not be used
to infer illegal conduct.

the securities laws, [their] Section 20(a) claim also fails.” Level 3, 667 F.3d at 1347.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendants respectfully submit that the Amended
Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.
