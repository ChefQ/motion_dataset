CIVIL ACTION
FILE NO. 1:08-CV-0421-TWT

DEFENDANT LFP PUBLISHING GROUP, LLC’S RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFF’S STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AS TO
WHICH THERE IS NO GENUINE ISSUE TO BE TRIED
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and LR N.D.Ga. 56.1B, Defendant LFP
Publishing Group, LLC (“LFP”) hereby submits its response to Plaintiff’s
Statement of Material Facts As To Which There Is No Genuine Issue To Be Tried:

Dockets.Justia.com

I.

RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED
FACTS
(1)
Plaintiff is the personal representative of the Estate of Nancy E. Benoit, who

died intestate in Fayette County, Georgia in June of 2007. See Verified Complaint
¶ 1.
RESPONSE:

Because LFP has not yet obtained any discovery from

Plaintiff, LFP does not yet know whether this assertion is true, or should be
disputed. Pursuant to Rule 56(f), LFP intends and requests the opportunity to
obtain discovery from Plaintiff and others to establish with certainty whether
Plaintiff in fact owns the rights to pursue her asserted claim for right of publicity
on behalf of decedent Nancy Benoit. LFP incorporates herein, in full, its Brief in
Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Liability and,
In the Alternative, Rule 56(f) Motion for an Extension of Time to Respond to
Plaintiff’s Summary Judgment Motion (“LFP Opposition Brief”) and the Affidavit
of S. Derek Bauer, Esq. (“Bauer Affidavit”), filed contemporaneously herewith.

2

(2)
Defendant LFP Publishing Group, LLC is the publisher of “Hustler
Magazine.” See Answer of Defendant LFP Publishing Group, LLC ¶ 2.
RESPONSE:

This fact is admitted and undisputed.
(3)

Defendant published nude and partially nude images (the “images”) of
Nancy E. Benoit in its “March 2008” edition. See Answer ¶ 8.
RESPONSE:

This fact is admitted and undisputed.
(4)

At no time has Defendant ever sought or obtained the permission of Nancy
E. Benoit or the Estate of Nancy E. Benoit to publish for commercial purposes the
images of Nancy E. Benoit. See Verified Complaint, Exhibits A, B, C, and D.
RESPONSE:

This fact is admitted and undisputed.

However, LFP

shows through the LFP Opposition Brief and Bauer Affidavit that the question of
whether Plaintiff is in fact the owner of the right she asserts on behalf of the Estate
of Ms. Benoit remains unresolved and unproven, as does the question of whether
Ms. Benoit did not license, release or otherwise convey rights to the images of Ms.
Benoit at issue to Defendant Samansky or another individual or entity. Both of

3

these unresolved questions are material and preclude Plaintiff’s request for entry of
summary judgment as to liability against LFP.
(5)
At no time has the Defendant ever compensated Nancy E. Benoit or the
Estate of Nancy E. Benoit for the use, for commercial purposes, of the images of
Nancy E. Benoit. See Verified Complaint, Exhibits A, B, C, and D.
RESPONSE:
II.

This fact is admitted and undisputed.

LFP’S LR 56.1B.(2)(b.) STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FACTS
WHICH ARE MATERIAL AND PRESENT A GENUINE ISSUE FOR
TRIAL
(1)
Whether Plaintiff is the owner of the right to exploit Ms. Benoit’s image and

likeness, including the specific images of Ms. Benoit published by LFP, and is
therefore the real party in interest.
(2)
Whether the images published by LFP were or are intended for commercial
exploitation by Ms. Benoit or Plaintiff.
(3)
Whether under the actual facts and circumstances to be proven, LFP’s
publication of the images of Ms. Benoit was for “commercial purposes,” as that

4

term is defined for purposes of the Georgia common law claim for right of
publicity.
(4)
Whether LFP was unjustly enriched by its publication of the images of Ms.
Benoit.
Respectfully submitted this 5th day of November, 2009.
