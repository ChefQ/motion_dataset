(1)
Plaintiff is the duly appointed and serving personal representative of the
Estate of Nancy E. Benoit, deceased, of Fayette County, Georgia.
(2)
Defendant is the publisher of “Hustler Magazine.”
(3)
Hustler published nude and partial nude images (the “images”) of Nancy
E. Benoit in its so-called “March 2008" edition. See Exhibits A, B, C, and D,
respectively to Plaintiff’s Verified Complaint; see also Answer of Defendant LFP
Publishing Group, LLC (the “Answer”), ¶¶ 8, 21, and 33.
(4)
Hustler did not seek or obtain the permission of Nancy E. Benoit, or
anyone authorized to act on behalf of Nancy E. Benoit, or the Estate of Nancy E.
Benoit, to use, publish, or make any other commercial use of the images. See Exhibits
C and D to Plaintiff’s Complaint.

(5)
Hustler did not compensate Nancy E. Benoit, or the Estate of Nancy E.
Benoit, for its use of the images for commercial purposes. See Exhibits C and D to
Plaintiff’s Complaint.
(6)
In the case of Toffoloni v. LFP Publishing Group, LLC, 572 F.3d 1201
(11th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held
that Hustler’s use and publication, for commercial purposes, of the images of Nancy
E. Benoit in its “March 2008” edition “[does] not qualify for the news worthiness
exception to the right of publicity” held by Nancy E. Benoit during her life and by her
Estate after her death. See Toffoloni, supra at 1213.
(7)
Thus, there is no genuine issue with respect to the fact that Hustler used
and published the images of Nancy E. Benoit for commercial purposes in its “March
2008” edition of Hustler Magazine. Defendant has admitted same.
(8)
There is no genuine issue with respect to the fact that Defendant’s use
and publication of the images of Nancy E. Benoit for commercial purposes were

without the permission of Nancy E. Benoit, or someone authorized to act on her
behalf, and without the permission of Plaintiff, as the personal representative of the
Estate of Nancy E. Benoit.
(9)
There is no genuine issue with respect to the fact that Defendant did not
compensate Nancy E. Benoit or the Estate of Nancy E. Benoit for its use and
publication, for commercial purposes, of the said images of Nancy E. Benoit.
Defendant has admitted same.
(10)
Based upon the Verified Complaint, facts admitted by the Defendant, and
the opinion and judgment of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Toffoloni v. LFP
Publishing Group, LLC, supra, Plaintiff moves for an Order declaring that Defendant
LFP Publishing Group, LLC is liable to Plaintiff for Defendant’s violation of
Plaintiff’s right of publicity, with Plaintiff’s damages to be decided by a jury.
