NON-PARTY, CITRUS HEALTH CARE, INC.'S, MOTION REQUESTING LEAVE TO
FILE ITS REPLY TO DEFENDANT, THADDEUS BEREDAY'S RESPONSE TO
CITRUS HEALTH CARE, INC.'S MOTION TO QUASH AND MEMORANDUM IN
SUPPORT

Pursuant to M.D. Fla. Loc. R. 3.01(c), Non-Party Citrus Health Care, Inc. ("Citrus"), by and

through undersigned counsel, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court permit Citrus to file
a reply or further memorandum - of a length no greater than ten (10) pages - to Defendant,
Thaddeus Bereday's Response to Citrus's Motion to Quash, and Memorandum in Support. In
support thereof, Citrus states:

1, On or about January 21, 2010, Defendant, Thaddeus Bereday ("Bereday") served
Citrus with a Subpoena to Produce Documents, Information, or Objects or to Permit Inspection
of Premises that contained a compliance date of February 16, 2010 ("Non-Party Subpoena"),

2. On or about January 23, 2010, Citrus's counsel contacted Bereday's counsel by
telephone, during which Citrus orally objected to the Non-Party Subpoena and informed
Bereday's counsel that court intervention would be sought should the Non-Party Subpoena not
be withdrawn. Citrus waited, but Bereday did not withdraw its Non-Party Subpoena.

3, On February 15, 2010, Citrus filed its Motion to Quash, Or In the Alternative,
Motion for a Protective Order. ("Motion to Quash"). :

4, On March 4, 2010, approximately 17 days after Citrus filed its Motion to Quash,
Bereday filed its memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Quash ("Memorandum in
Opposition"). |

5. In its Memorandum of Opposition, Bereday cites to Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(2)(B) and
case law as mandating that any objection (including motions to quash) must be delivered in
writing within 14 days of service of a subpoena. Because the Motion to Quash was filed at 14
days from service, Bereday claims the Motion to Quash was untimely filed and thus resulted in a
waiver of Citrus's ability to object to or quash the Non-Party Subpoena. Citrus requests to
respond in turn with case law showing that not only did Citrus make a timely objection by
telephone, but that Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(2)(B) does not require a person served with an
objectionable subpoena to follow its directives in lieu of filing a motion to quash pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(3) within the compliance period contained in a subpoena rather than 14 days
from date of service.

6. Finally, the Memorandum in Opposition was itself untimely filed pursuant to
Local Rule 3.01(b), as it was filed more than ten days after the Motion to Quash was filed.

LOCAL RULE 3.01(g) CERTIFICATION

Pursuant to M.D. Fla. Loc. R. 3.01(g), the undersigned certifies that he has consulted
with counsel for Bereday and has been informed that Bereday objects to this Motion.

WHEREFORE, Non-Party Citrus respectfully request that this Honorable Court grant it
permission to file a short ten (10) page or less reply to Bereday's response memorandum to

address Bereday's newly raised factual and legal conclusions.
