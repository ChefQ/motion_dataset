DEFENDANT THADDEUS BEREDAY'S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
CITRUS HEALTH CARE, INC.'S MOTION REQUESTING LEAVE TO FILE TO
REPLY BRIEF

Defendant Thaddeus Bereday respectfully submits this opposition to Citrus Health Care,
Inc.'s ("Citrus") Motion Requesting Leave to File Its Reply Brief ("Motion"). In its Motion,
Citrus asserts that a reply brief - of up to 10 pages - is needed to make the following arguments:
that "the Motion to Quash was filed at 14 days from service [of the subpoena]"; that Citrus "did
make a timely objection by telephone"; and that Mr. Bereday's opposition brief was "untimely
filed pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(b), as it was filed more than ten days after the Motion to Quash
was filed." Motion "5-6.

Two of these arguments are wrong. Citrus did not file its motion to quash "at 14 days
from service" of the subpoena. Citrus was hand-served with the subpoena on January 21 and
filed its motion to quash on February 15 - i.e., 25 days from service. Motion {9 1,3. In
addition, Mr. Bereday's opposition was timely pursuant to the Court's December 1, 2009
Amendment to Time Calculations and Rule 6(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See

Amended Local Rule 3.01(b) ("Each party opposing a motion or application shall file within

fourteen (14) days after service of the motion") (emphasis added); Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(d)
Case 8:07-cv-01940-VMC-EAJ Document 186 Filed 03/11/10 Page 2 of 3

(extending time to respond by 3 days in the event of electronic service). In fact, Mr. Bereday's
memorandum was filed a day early in light of the fact that Citrus filed an amended motion to
quash on February 16. Thus, two of the three arguments in Citrus' Motion for Leave require no
further briefing.

Citrus also requests leave to submit case law showing Citrus made a timely objection by
telephone and that its motion to quash was timely. Mr. Bereday's counsel disagrees that any
objection was made during counsel's January 23 telephone call, but that disagreement does not
matter. Citrus' argument is foreclosed by Rule 45(c)(2)(B), which requires written objections.
Further, Mr. Bereday does not argue that the motion to quash itself was untimely. Rather, it is
Mr. Bereday's position that any objections were waived by Citrus' failure to timely object and
Citrus has not met its burden under Rule 45(c)(3) because the subpoena served by Mr. Bereday is
valid on its face and reasonable in its scope. There is no need for further briefing on the validity

of, or burden associated with, the subpoena.
