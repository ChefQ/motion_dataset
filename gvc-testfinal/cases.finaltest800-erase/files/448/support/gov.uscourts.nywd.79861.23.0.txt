Docket No. 10-CV-569-RJA

MARK ELLIOT ZUCKERBERG
and FACEBOOK, INC.,

Defendants.
STATE OF NEW YORK )
COUNTY OF ERIE ) SS.:
CITY OF BUFFALO )

TERRENCE M. CONNORS, ESQ. being duly sworn, deposes and says that:

1. Iam an attorney at law admitted to practice before this Court and a
partner in the law firm, CONNORS & VILARDO, LLP, attorneys for Plaintiff,
PAUL D. CEGLIA, (hereinafter "Plaintiff'). As such, I am familiar with the
pleadings and proceedings in this matter.

2. I make this affidavit in support of Plaintiffs motion to remand this
action to New York state supreme court.

3. As explained in the accompanying memorandum of law, the motion
to remand is based upon the concern that this Court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction because of a lack of diversity. At issue is Defendant Zuckerberg's
domicile.

4. The issue of Mr. Zuckerberg's domicile was addressed in prior
litigation. See ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, et. al, 482 F. Supp. 2d 3 (D. Mass
2007). In that litigation, ConnectU LLC alleged a number of state law causes of

action against Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"). Exhibit E

 
 

Case 1:10-cv-00569-RJA Document 23 Filed 08/09/2010 Page5of7

(U.S. District Court, District Court of Massachusetts (Boston), Civil Docket for Case
#: 1:04-cv-11923-DPW), Docket Item 1.

5. On October 14, 2005, nearly a year after the lawsuit was filed, Mr.
Zuckerberg made a motion to dismiss that suit for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. In particular, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that he was a domiciliary of New
York State, and thus that diversity jurisdiction did not exist. Exhibit A (Defendant
Facebook's Motion to Dismiss); see also Exhibit E, Docket Items 94, 100.

6. Although at all times relevant to that litigation Mr. Zuckerberg had
been residing in California, he argued that he lacked sufficient intent to remain in
that state and that his domicile remained in New York, the place of his birth.
Exhibit A; Exhibit B (Transcript of Motion Hearing) at 14-20, 36, 53-63, 66-68, 135,
I-170, I-172, I-211- L215.

7. The Honorable Douglas P. Woodlock of the District of
Massachusetts considered the questions surrounding Mr. Zuckerberg's domicile
significant enough to refer the dismissal motion to a Magistrate Judge to conduct
discovery and explore evidence pertinent to the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.
See Exhibit E, Docket Item 172.

8. That discovery included the production of documents, a June 8,
2006 deposition of Mr. Zuckerberg, as well as a full day evidentiary hearing on the
issue on June 22, 2006. That evidentiary hearing consisted almost entirely of Mr.
Zuckerberg's oral testimony, including over four hours of cross-examination, on the
issue of his domicile. See ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, 482 F. Supp. 2d 8, 32 (D.

Mass. 2007); ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82, 87 (1* Cir. 2008).

 

 
 

 

Case 1:10-cv-00569-RJA Document 23 Filed 08/09/2010 Page6of7

9. Throughout discovery, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that he had been a
New York domiciliary since birth, and that there was a presumption that his
domicile in New York continued. See Exhibit B at I-170, 1-172, I-211, I-215.

10. Mr. Zuckerberg was successful in convincing the court he
remained a New York domiciliary, consequently establishing a lack of diversity
jurisdiction and the absence of federal court subject matter jurisdiction. See
ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, 482 F. Supp. 2d at 11-12; Exhibit FE, Docket Item 230.
The First Circuit's subsequent decision reversed the District Court on other grounds
and its decision did not disturb the District Court's finding that Mr. Zuckerberg was
a domiciliary of New York.

11. In this litigation, Mr. Zuckerberg now alleges he is a domiciliary of
California. See Defendant's Notice of Removal { 5.

12. It is anticipated that Mr. Zuckerberg will provide documents to
Plaintiff this afternoon that suggest he is a resident of California, see Exhibit C
(letter offering these items), but residence does not equal domicile.

13. Inspection of the public record reveals that Mr. Zuckerberg has
maintained indicia of New York domicile, including some he relied upon in the prior
litigation to prove New York domicile. See Exhibit D (proof of a current, valid New
York driver's license and proof of active voter registration in Dobbs Ferry, New
York).

14. These indicia include a valid New York driver's license and valid
New York voter registration. Compare ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, 482 F. Supp.

2d at 30-31, with Exhibit D.

 

 
 

 

Case 1:10-cv-00569-RJA Document 23 Filed 08/09/2010 Page 7 of 7

15. Federal law is clear that, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction and
subject matter jurisdiction, there is a presumption that domicile continues.

16. The party asserting diversity jurisdiction bears the burden of proof
to establish by clear and convincing evidence that domicile has changed.

17. Given the mere assertion of jurisdiction proffered by defendant,
the facts from the public record, and the presumption of continuing domicile
defendant must rebut to prove this Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction,
Defendant Zuckerberg has not met his burden and remand is required. The items
Defendant Zuckerberg will be providing to Plaintiff this afternoon for inspection
suggest that Zuckerberg resides, at least in part, in California, but these items are
not dispositive of domicile and do not end the inquiry.

18. In the alternative, in the event that Defendant Zuckerberg can
provide evidence to meet his burden and rebut the presumption that his domicile
remains in New York, the facts and law summarized in the accompanying
memorandum of law demonstrate that jurisdictional discovery is necessary to
resolve the issue of Defendant Zuckerberg's domicile.
