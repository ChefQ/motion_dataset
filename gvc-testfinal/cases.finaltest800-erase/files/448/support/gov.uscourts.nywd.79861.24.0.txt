PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

On July 8, 2010, the defendants removed this matter from New York state
court to federal court. In their notice of removal, the defendants asserted that
"complete diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1332 existed between the
Plaintiff and Defendants at the time Plaintiff filed the Complaint, and has existed
at all times from that date until the filing of this Notice of Removal." The notice
also chided the complaint for alleging that defendant Zuckerberg resides in New
York, and the notice asserted that Zuckerberg "was at the time of the

commencement of this action, and still is, a domiciliary and citizen of California."

In prior federal litigation that also involved the disputed origins of Facebook,
Zuckerberg took the opposite position in arguing that a federal court could not
exercise subject matter jurisdiction over him. In that case, the district court
conducted an evidentiary hearing following depositions and documentary discovery,
and in the hearing Zuckerberg presented a mountain of evidence that he was, in
fact, a New York domiciliary with the same citizenship as the plaintiffs who were
claiming he stole the idea and code for Facebook from them. Even though he had
already moved to California, where he now apparently resides, Zuckerberg asserted
that he was still a New York resident without any fixed intention to remain
domiciled at any address other than Dobbs Ferry, New York. The district court
accepted Zuckerberg's representations and proof and found in his favor that he was

a New York domiciliary.
Case 1:10-cv-00569-RJA Document 24 Filed 08/09/10 Page 7 of 16

Federal law is clear that for purposes of measuring subject matter
jurisdiction and citizenship, a person's state of domicile presumptively continues
unless rebutted with sufficient evidence of change. Here, Zuckerberg will not be
able to rebut the proof that he is a New York domiciliary because some of the
hallmarks of domicile that he relied upon to convince the district court he was a
New York domiciliary in the prior case remain in place. In other words, if he was a
New York domiciliary after he moved to California in 2004, then he is

presumptively still a New York domiciliary today.

Defendant's mere notice of removal is insufficient to rebut that presumption.
Consequently, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because defendant
Zuckerberg remains a New York domiciliary and his citizenship is not diverse from

plaintiffs. Even if Zuckerberg can establish current residence in California,

residence does not equal domicile, as Zuckerberg himself argued four years ago and _

as he asserted in the notice of removal in this case. Zuckerberg never took steps to
change some of the hallmarks of domicile and citizenship he used offensively in
prior litigation, and those same hallmarks compel the same conclusion the district
court reached in 2007: he is a domiciliary of New York. As a result, remand is

required because this Court does not possess subject matter jurisdiction.

In the event that Zuckerberg presents proof of California residence that calls
into question his current domicile, at the very least plaintiff is entitled to discovery

and, if necessary, a hearing, on the issue of Zuckerberg's citizenship and domicile.

FACTS

 

In 2004, defendant Zuckerberg and Facebook were parties in a lawsuit in
federal district court in Massachusetts. See ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, 482 F.
Supp. 2d 3 (D. Mass. 2007), rev'd on other grounds, 522 F.3d 82 (1st Cir. 2008). The
suit, originally premised on diversity jurisdiction, was brought by Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, three Harvard undergraduates who
alleged that they hired Zuckerberg to help them code and complete their budding
social network (originally called "HarvardConnection," but later re-named
"ConnectU"). See ConnectU LLC v. Zuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2008).
The plaintiffs alleged that instead of performing the work for which he had been
hired, Zuckerberg stole the source code and other elements of the network's
business plan and applied it to Facebook. See id.

Approximately one year after the suit was filed, Zuckerberg argued that the
district court could not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over him because he and
the plaintiffs were New York domiciliaries. Td. at 86-87. The district court allowed
intensive jurisdictional discovery, including written discovery and depositions on
the jurisdictional issues and Zuckerberg's domicile. The court then conducted a full-
day evidentiary hearing of the jurisdictional issues. Td. at 87. That hearing
consisted almost exclusively of Zuckerberg's testimony-as to his domicile, and

included four hours of cross examination. Hxhibit Bto Connors Aff.' In depositions

and documents, as well as at the evidentiary hearing, Zuckerberg set about proving
that despite living away from his parent's house since his sixteenth birthday, he
nevertheless still was domiciled in New York. Exhibit B at 129. Moreover, he made
a number of statements suggesting that even though he had moved to California, he
intended to remain a New York domiciliary in the future. Those statements are

summarized below:

* He stated that he had no intention to remain in California at the time of his
testimony. See Hxhibit B at 66.

- He maintained his New York voter registration and New York driver's
license. Exhibit B at 135, 1-170, 1-211, 1-214.

* He traveled to the East Coast often, both to develop business interests as well
as to visit his parents. Exhibit B at 67.

* He used and would continue to use his parent's address as a place to receive
important papers, documents and bank statements, given the transient

nature of his life in California. See Exhibit B at 18, 102, 106, I-172, 1-177, I-
200.

- He regarded to his parent's address as "home," a place he could always return
to. See Exhibit B at 17, 18, 36, 102.

- He had not purchased a dwelling in California, and instead was living in a
series of houses and apartments that included short-term leases. Exhibit Bat
14-17, 18-20, 53-63.

The district court in Massachusetts accepted Zuckerberg's representations and

evidence and found him to be a New York domiciliary. See ConnectU, 522 F.3d at

87.

 
Case 1:10-cv-00569-RJA Document 24 Filed 08/09/10 Page 10 of 16

In the time since that judicial finding some of these factors remain in place.
Although Zuckerberg apparently continues to reside in California, it does not
appear he has purchased a residence. His New York driver's license is still valid.
His New York voter registration status is "active." It is unclear the extent to which
he continues to travel to New York and conduct business in New York.

ARGUMENT
I, This Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Remand is Required.

28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1441 (a) provides that a defendant or defendants may remove "any
civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States
have original jurisdiction." Jd. Here, defendants claim that this Court has original .
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1332 because there is complete diversity of
citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. See Notice of Removal
{4 6, 7.

Because the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and removal is a
purely statutory right that limits states' judicial powers, the removal provisions are
to be strictly construed against removal. See Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets,
313 U.S. 100, 108-09 (1941), superseded by statue on other grounds as recognized in
Breuer v. Jim's Concrete of Brevard, Inc., 538 U.S. 691, 692 (2003); Gribler v.
Weisblat, No. 07 Civ. 11436, 2008 WL 563469, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2008);
Compania Naviera S.A. v. Perushahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi

Negara, 428 F. Supp. 1035, 1037 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).
