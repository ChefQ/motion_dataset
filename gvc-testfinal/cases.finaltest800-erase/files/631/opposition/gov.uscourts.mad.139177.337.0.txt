PLAINTIFFS MOMENTA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SANDOZ, INC.'S
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO REMOVE STAY

Plaintiffs Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sandoz, Inc. (collectively, "Momenta")
hereby oppose the Motion to Remove Stay filed by defendants Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
International Medication Systems, Ltd., Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Watson Pharma, Inc.
(collectively, "Amphastar").

Amphastar asks that the stay be lifted so that it may file a motion for summary judgment
in which it would contend that its conduct is protected from liability under 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 271(e)(1).
Section 271(e)(1) provides an exemption from liability for certain otherwise infringing conduct.
Amphastar's motion should be denied. Two separate petitions for a writ of certiorari may result
in Supreme Court review that would affect the scope of Section 271(e)(1) and could resolve the
related conflict between the Federal Circuit's recent decision in this case and its earlier decision
in Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen IDEC, 659 F.3d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 2011). This Court
should maintain the stay, and thus defer further consideration of the statutory interpretation

question that would be presented by Amphastar's proposed summary judgment motion, pending

55844741
rulings on those petitions. The continued maintenance of the stay will conserve the Court's, and
the parties,' resources at least until it is known whether further appellate guidance will be
forthcoming in this case or Classen. Amphastar will suffer no prejudice from the maintenance of
the stay because it is continuing to sell its enoxaparin during the period of the stay.

The Classen Case. The Federal Circuit held in Classen that activity that is undertaken
after an alleged infringer has obtained pre-market approval from the FDA is not exempt from
infringement liability under Section 271(e)(1). Classen, 659 F.3d at 1070-72 ("The statute does
not apply to information that may be routinely reported to the FDA, long after marketing
approval has been obtained."), When this Court granted Momenta's motion for a preliminary
injunction, it held that Classen was controlling and, on that basis, rejected Amphastar's
arguments regarding the scope of Section 271(euro)(1). (Memorandum and Order, at 23.) (Docket
No. 92.) However, on August 3, 2012, a 2-to-1 majority of a panel of the Federal Circuit
adopted the statutory interpretation that is rejected in Classen: "We therefore hold that post-
approval studies ... fall within the scope of the 0x00A7 271(e)(1) safe harbor." Momenta, slip op. at 20
(Docket No. 322.). In dissent, Chief Judge Rader observed that the panel majority's decision in
this case "ignores the binding precedent of Classen" and "cannot be genuinely reconciled with
Classen." Momenta, slip op. at 3, 16 (Rader, C.J., dissenting).

A petition for writ of certiorari has been filed in Classen. The Supreme Court has
requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding this petition. GlaxoSmithKline v. Classen
Immunotherapies, Inc., No. 11-178 (U.S. Solicitor General Invitation June 25, 2012). There is,
therefore, a significant, and greatly enhanced, chance that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari
in the Classen case. See David C. Thompson and Melanie F. Wachtell, An Empirical Analysis of

Supreme Court Certiorari Petition Procedures: The Call for Response and the Call for the Views

55844741
of the Solicitor General, 16 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 237, 273-74 (2009) (concluding that certiorari
petitions in paid cases were granted in 42% of all cases where the Supreme Court requested the
Solicitor General's views, and that those petitions are more than 46 times more likely to be
granted than when the Solicitor General's views have not been requested).

If, as expected, the Solicitor General responds to the Supreme Court's request for his
views in December 2012, the Supreme Court will likely decide whether to grant certiorari in
Classen in January 2013. A Supreme Court decision in Classen would likely resolve important
issues relevant to this case regarding the scope of Section 271(e)(1). In these circumstances, it
makes sense for this Court to postpone further briefing or decision on a motion for summary
judgment in this case at least until the Supreme Court rules on the Classen petition. Cf, Taunton
Gardens Co. v. Carla Hills, 557 F.2d 877, 879 (1st Cir. 1977) (staying further proceedings
pending resolution of a related appeal in the D.C. Circuit); Warner-Lambert Co. v. United Retail
& Wholesale Employee's Teamster Local No. 115 Pension Plan, 791 F.2d 283, 286-287 (3d Cir.
1986) (staying mandate pending Supreme Court's consideration of certiorari petition in another
case with recognized circuit conflict).

The Present Case. Momenta is preparing a petition for writ of certiorari in the present
case. The petition will seek further review of issues relating to the scope of Section 271(e)(1) as
applied to the facts of this case -- ie., many of the same issues as would be presented by
Amphastar's proposed summary judgment motion. A ruling on that petition is expected in mid-
2013. Because of the conflict between the Federal Circuit panel decision in this case and the
panel decision in Classen, there is an enhanced chance that this petition will be granted (or held
pending a decision in the Classen case if certiorari is granted in that case). See, e.g., Warner-

Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17, 23-24 (1997) (differences of opinion

5584474v1
among judges of the Federal Circuit on patent law matters are sufficient to warrant certiorari);
and, see, e.g, Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 534 (1987) (granting certiorari
to review the entry of a preliminary injunction). This Court should allow appellate proceedings
regarding the preliminary injunction order in this case, and the scope of Section 271(e)(1), to be
concluded before it again addresses the Section 271(e)(1) issue. The Court should have the
benefit of whatever Supreme Court guidance may be forthcoming in this case before it rules on
the same or similar issues. E.g., Lotus Development v. Borland Int'l, Inc., Nos. 95-1793, 95-
1885, 1995 U.S. App. Lexis 37394 (1st Cir. Dec, 28, 1995),

Moreover, Amphastar requests that the stay in this case be lifted so that it may seek a
judgment dismissing this case. Any such judgment would likely subsume this Court's
preliminary injunction order and thus could impair the jurisdictional basis for Momenta's
certiorari petition. See Cornish v. Kappos, 425 Fed. Appx. 885, 885-86 (Fed. Cir. 2011);
Brennan v. William Paterson College, No. 11-4296, 2012 U.S. App. Lexis 16944, at *17-18 Gd
Cir. Aug. 14, 2012). Simple fairness suggests that Momenta's anticipated certiorari petition
should first be considered on its merits by the Supreme Court before this Court takes an action
that could adversely affect Momenta's appellate rights.

Finally, Amphastar will not be prejudiced if the stay in this case remains in place. E.g.,
Lotus, 1995 U.S. App. Lexis 37394, at *4. Amphastar has been selling, and, presumably will

continue to sell, its enoxaparin during the pendency of the stay. In the circumstances, the wiser

 

1 In Lotus, the district court granted a stay on similar but less compelling facts. After the First
Circuit had reversed the district court's entry of an injunction, the defendant sought to move for
final judgment. The district court stayed all further proceedings pending a denial or decision on
the merits of plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari, also commented that since the injunction
was no longer in place there was no prejudice to the defendant. 1995 U.S. App. Lexis 37394, at
*3-4, Here, the reasons for maintaining the stay are even more compelling because a petition for
certiorari is also pending in Classen.

5584474v1
and fairer course is to await the Supreme Court's consideration of the certiorari petitions

described above so as to minimize the risk that issues addressed now will have to be readdressed

later and to avoid any risk that Momenta's appellate rights with respect to its anticipated

certiorari petition will be prejudiced.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above, the Defendants' Motion to Remove Stay should be denied.
