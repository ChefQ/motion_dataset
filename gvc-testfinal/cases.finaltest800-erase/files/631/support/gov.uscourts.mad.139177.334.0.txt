Case 1:11-cv-11681-NMG Document 334 Filed 11/28/12 Page 2 of 7

Defendants Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., International Medication Systems, Ltd.,
Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Watson Pharma, Inc. (collectively “Amphastar”) respectfully
move to lift the stay entered by this Court on August 14, 2012, on the grounds that the Federal
Circuit has denied the petition for rehearing en banc filed by plaintiffs Momenta
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sandoz, Inc. (collectively “Momenta”). Because the Federal Circuit
has disposed of Momenta’s petition and fully concluded its proceedings in this case, the stay is
no longer warranted and this Court should now decide, in accordance with the Federal Circuit’s
August 3, 2012 ruling, whether the case is “amenable to summary judgment of non-infringement
in favor of Amphastar” on safe harbor grounds.

Momenta Pharmas., Inc. v. Amphastar

Pharmas., Inc., 686 F.3d 1348, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
As brief background, on August 3, 2012, the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the
preliminary injunction issued in this case last year. A few days later, Amphastar and Momenta
jointly moved to stay the case, with a limited exception for summary judgment briefing on the
safe harbor issue. (See Dkt. No. 327.) This Court granted a stay of the entire action on August
14, 2012. (See Dkt. No. 330.) On September 4, 2012, Momenta filed a petition with the Federal
Circuit for rehearing en banc of the panel opinion. The Federal Circuit invited a response from
Amphastar, which Amphastar filed on October 15, 2012. On November 20, 2012, the Federal
Circuit denied Momenta’s petition for rehearing en banc. (See Nov. 20 Order, attached as
Exhibit A.)
In accordance with this Court’s August 14 stay order, Amphastar now respectfully
requests that the stay be removed so that it may file a dispositive motion on the grounds
suggested in the Federal Circuit’s August 3 opinion. See Momenta Pharmas., 686 F.3d at 1361.
In jointly seeking the original stay after the Federal Circuit vacated the injunction in this case,

1

Case 1:11-cv-11681-NMG Document 334 Filed 11/28/12 Page 3 of 7

Amphastar and Momenta informed the court that “[t]he parties agree that, until further appellate
proceedings with respect to the Federal Circuit decision are completed, a stay is appropriate in
order to conserve the parties’ and the Court’s resources.” (See Dkt. No. 330.) In the November
14, 2012 status report, the parties noted that they were still “awaiting a ruling by the Federal
Circuit on the Petition for Rehearing,” and reiterated that “[t]he parties agree” that the stay
remained appropriate “until disposition of the rehearing petition by the Federal Circuit[.]” (See
Dkt. No. 332.) Because the Federal Circuit has now disposed of Momenta’s petition, the stay is
no longer warranted.
Momenta will not be prejudiced if the stay is lifted so that Amphastar may file its
dispositive motion for judgment on the safe harbor issue; in fact, the parties’ original August 9,
2012 joint motion to stay contemplated the filing of the exact same “motion for summary
judgment based solely upon the issue that is addressed in the decision of the Court of Appeals.”
(See Dkt. No. 227.) Although at the time Momenta planned to oppose Amphastar’s dispositive
motion on the merits, “the parties d[id] not intend that this stay extend to briefing or decision on
that particular motion.” See id. Moreover, because the Court denied all pending motions
without prejudice when it stayed the action (see Dkt. No. 230), Momenta need not expend any
resources beyond those associated with the dispositive motion it already anticipated back in
August.
Momenta has indicated that it intends to seek further review in the Supreme Court, but
that is no reason to maintain the stay. As noted, the parties’ joint motion to stay back in August
contemplated the same dispositive briefing on safe harbor immediately, and the intervening en
banc rehearing denial makes Momenta’s prospects for avoiding Amphastar’s dispositive safe
harbor defense even more remote. Beyond that, the chances of the Supreme Court granting a

2

Case 1:11-cv-11681-NMG Document 334 Filed 11/28/12 Page 4 of 7

petition for a writ of certiorari are small. The Supreme Court typically grants review of less than
1% of all petitions for certiorari filed—it granted review in just 77 out of 7,857 petition last
Term.

See also David C. Thompson and Melanie F. Wachtell, An Empirical Analysis of

Supreme Court Certiorari Procedures, 162 GEO. MASON L. REV. 237, 275-276 (2009) (certiorari
granted in 78 of 8,517 petitions in the Supreme Court’s 2005 term, or less than 1%). The odds
are barely better for paid petitions. See id. (3.5% granted). Worse still, the Supreme Court is
particularly disinclined to grant review when a case comes before it—as Momenta’s petition
will—in an interlocutory posture. See Virginia Military Inst. v. United States, 508 U.S. 946
(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in denial of certiorari) (“We generally await final judgment in the
lower courts before exercising our certiorari jurisdiction.”) (citing cases); see also Goldstein v.
Cox, 396 U.S. 471, 478 (1970) (“[T]his Court above all others must limit its review of
interlocutory orders.”).
Finally, Amphastar will suffer prejudice if the conclusion of this litigation is further put
off while Momenta awaits a certiorari decision. Momenta’s petition would not be due for 90
days, with up to 60 days in additional extensions possible, and Amphastar’s response would not
be due for another 30 to 60 days thereafter. See SUP. CT. R. 13.1, 13.5. The Supreme Court
could also call for the views of the Solicitor General, or simply hold the petition while it
deliberates on whether to grant it. All told, this means that resolution of the litigation could be
put off for nearly a year before the Supreme Court renders its decision on certiorari. To borrow
Momenta’s words opposing Amphastar’s February 2, 2012 Motion to Stay pending the Federal
Circuit’s decision (which this Court denied, see Dkt. Nos. 148, 151), “[t]he convenience *** of
delay pending receipt” of the Supreme Court’s certiorari decision “does not outweigh

3

Case 1:11-cv-11681-NMG Document 334 Filed 11/28/12 Page 5 of 7

[Amphastar’s] (and the judicial system’s) interest in achieving a prompt, final resolution of this
case.” (See Dkt No. 150, at 4-5).
Meanwhile, if the case remains stayed, Amphastar will continue to suffer the uncertainty
and prejudice that attend the long-delayed resolution of litigation.

Particularly where the

likelihood of relief is so slim, there is no basis to force Amphastar to wait such a long time
before even initiating the summary judgment process and face for an even longer time all the
uncertainty and risk that litigation entails before it can be allowed to obtain a definitive ruling
from this Court that its actions did not infringe Momenta’s patents. The fact is, the Federal
Circuit has already recognized on safe harbor grounds that Amphastar could not have infringed
Momenta’s patents.1 And “[o]rdinarily, where a party has won on appeal after losing in the
district court, it is appropriate to put the appellate court decision into effect pending the Supreme
Court’s ruling” on certiorari. Wald v. Regan, 708 F.2d 794, 803–804 (1st Cir. 1983) (denying
stay of mandate), judgment rev’d on the merits, 468 U.S. 222 (1984). Amphastar is therefore
entitled to a definitive ruling in this court, and should not be forced to remain in litigation limbo
while Momenta makes a highly speculative attempt at Supreme Court review.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth herein, Amphastar respectfully requests that the Court remove
the stay entered on August 14, 2012. If the Court grants the requested relief, Amphastar is
prepared to file its dispositive motion promptly or at any schedule the Court deems appropriate
and convenient.

1

Given its holding in Amphastar’s favor, the Federal Circuit did not have the occasion to
address Amphastar’s additional arguments establishing the invalidity of Momenta’s patents and
its infringement claims.
