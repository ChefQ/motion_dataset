DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
______________________________________________________________________________
Defendants respectfully submit this Motion to Dismiss defendant Brandon Byrd for Lack
of Personal Jurisdiction and Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s fraud claim for failure to state a claim.
In support thereof, the defendants state as follows:
INTRODUCTION
This Court does not have jurisdiction over Brandon Byrd (“Byrd”), one of the defendants
in this suit. The sole connection between Byrd and the State of Colorado is that Byrd submitted
information to plaintiff, a Colorado corporation, via the internet. Plaintiff fails to demonstrate in
its Third Amended Complaint (“Complaint”) that Byrd knew Plaintiff was a Colorado
corporation when he allegedly submitted the information or that he, in any other way,
purposefully availed himself of the laws of the State of Colorado. Indeed, Plaintiff fails to allege
any basis upon which Byrd could have anticipated being haled into court in Colorado, a state he
never so much has visited.

Moreover, Plaintiff’s fraud claim should be dismissed for the alternative reason that it
fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).
STATEMENT OF FACTS
The facts relevant to this motion are simple: Plaintiff is a Colorado Corporation that
operates a website for the purpose of generating insurance leads that are then sold to agents and
brokers. (Compl. ¶¶ 7, 10-14). Defendant Byrd is a resident of Sandy Springs, Georgia, who has
never been to Colorado nor had any other knowing contacts with the state. (Byrd Aff. ¶¶ 1-4,
attached hereto as Exhibit A). Plaintiff has alleged that defendant, through his internet service
provider, completed its online insurance application numerous times, and in each instance
provided “false” information. (Compl. ¶¶ 56-59). Plaintiff alleges that these submissions are
actionable under theories of fraud and tortious interference with business relations. (Compl. ¶¶
54-73).
Plaintiff claims this Court has jurisdiction over defendant because defendant allegedly
aimed tortious conduct at plaintiff and plaintiff felt that harm in Colorado. (Compl. ¶ 3).
Plaintiff alleges that the defendant Byrd knew his activities were aimed at Colorado, but this is
controverted by Byrd’s affidavit (Byrd Aff. ¶¶ 1-4).
ARGUMENT
I.

PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THIS
COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER DEFENDANT
A.

Legal Standard for Personal Jurisdiction

In a diversity action, a court only has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if jurisdiction
is consistent with the state's long-arm statute and if jurisdiction does not offend the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Benton v. Cameco Corp., 375 F.3d 1070, 1075 (10th Cir.
-2#1238348 v1

Case 1:07-cv-00630-DME-MEH

2004). Since the Colorado long arm statute allows jurisdiction to the full extent of the
Constitution, the jurisdictional analysis here reduces to a single inquiry whether jurisdiction
offends due process. Id. Due process requires that defendant have sufficient minimum contacts
with the forum state such that he would “reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.” Id.
citing World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1990). Plaintiff bears the
burden of proving jurisdiction exists. Id. at 1074.
Minimum contacts can be satisfied either through the doctrines of specific or general
jurisdiction. General jurisdiction “is not related to the facts giving rise to the suit” and requires a
more stringent minimum contacts showing than specific jurisdiction. Id. at 1081. To establish
general jurisdiction, plaintiff must “demonstrate the defendant’s continuous and systematic
general business contacts.” Id. at 1081 (emphasis added); Schneider v. Cate, 405 F. Supp. 2d
1254, 1259 (D. Colo. 2005) (“General jurisdiction arises where the defendant’s forum state
contacts are so systematic and continuous as to justify jurisdiction even where those contacts are
not directly related to the cause of action.”). In this case, the defendant has never been to
Colorado, let alone conducted business in Colorado. Defendant has no systematic or continuous
contacts with the State, nor has Plaintiff alleged such contacts, leaving specific jurisdiction as the
sole avenue for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over this defendant.
Specific jurisdiction is appropriate where the defendant has purposefully directed his
activities at the forum state and where the cause of action stems from the defendant's forum state
contacts. Id. Specific jurisdiction involves a two part inquiry. OMI Holdings, Inc. v. Royal Ins.
Co. of Canada, 149 F.3d 1086, 1091 (10th Cir. 1998). First, a defendant must have minimum
contacts with the forum state. Id. This test requires analyzing two related but distinct questions:
(1) whether the defendant purposefully directed his contacts at the forum state; and (2)
-3#1238348 v1

Case 1:07-cv-00630-DME-MEH

Page 4 of 12

"whether the plaintiff's claim arises out of or results from actions by the defendant himself that
create a substantial connection to the forum state." Id. (emphasis in original). If a defendant is
found to have sufficient minimum contacts to justify specific jurisdiction, it is still necessary to
determine whether the exercise of specific jurisdiction "offends traditional notions of fair play
and substantial justice." Id. These two prongs operate on a sliding scale. The stronger the
minimum contacts, the greater the burden on the defendant to show that jurisdiction is
unreasonable. Schneider, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 1262.
In ascertaining the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction, the district court must accept
as true the allegations set forth in the complaint to the extent they are uncontroverted by
defendant's affidavits. Therefore, in light of the affidavit filed with the Court, the plaintiff must
offer more than mere “conclusory allegations,” and specifically must present competent evidence
to controvert the defendant’s affidavit in order to be entitled to have those facts interpreted in its
favor. See Ten Mile Industrial Park v. Western Plains Service Corp., 810 F.2d 1518, 1524 (10th
Cir. 1987).
B.

There is no Personal Jurisdiction over Defendant.

The only basis for jurisdiction alleged in the Complaint is defendant’s alleged tortious
conduct. Thus, the applicable minimum contacts analysis is that of Calder v. Jones, and its
progeny, addressing personal jurisdiction in tort actions. 465 U.S. 783 (1983). The Tenth
Circuit, applying Calder v. Jones, has made clear that mere injury of a forum resident by an outof-state defendant is, taken alone, insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction:
The mere allegation that an out-of-state defendant has tortiously interfered with
contractual rights or has committed other business torts that have allegedly
injured a forum resident does not necessarily establish that the defendant
possesses the constitutionally required minimum contacts. Instead, in order to
resolve the jurisdictional question, a court must undertake a particularized
-4#1238348 v1

inquiry as to the extent to which the defendant has purposefully availed itself of
the benefits of the forum's laws.
Far W. Capital v. Towne, 46 F.3d 1071, 1079 (10th Cir. 1995). Thus, the exercise of personal
jurisdiction requires something more than the mere effect being felt in the forum state.1
Defendant must have purposefully availed himself of the benefits of the forum state’s laws. And
such purposeful availment, at the very least, requires knowledge by defendant that his activities
involved the forum state.
In this case, plaintiff, a Colorado corporation, maintains a website on the Internet, where
anyone, anywhere may submit information to obtain a rate and policy quotation for various types
of insurance. Plaintiff’s suit is based on the core allegation that defendant submitted false
information to plaintiff via its website. (Compl. ¶¶ 33). Plaintiff alleges that it felt the effect of
these submissions in Colorado. (Compl. ¶ 3).
Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to establish that defendant had sufficient minimum
contacts to be haled into court in Colorado. Plaintiff fails to demonstrate, other than bald
conclusory statements in Paragraph 3 of the Complaint, that defendant in any way expressly
aimed his activities to Colorado. Indeed, plaintiff cannot establish that defendant knew he was
dealing with a Colorado company. There are simply none of the usual indicia of minimum
contacts in this case for jurisdiction to lie. In support of this motion, the defendant affies that he
has never been to Colorado, has never had any communication with plaintiff other than
automated responses from plaintiff’s website, that he did not know plaintiff was a Colorado

1

Nearly all other circuits agree with the Tenth Circuit that personal jurisdiction requires more
than mere effects in the forum state. See, e.g., IMO Indus., Inc. v. Kiekert, AG, 155 F.3d 254 (3d
Cir. 1998) ( surveying Circuits and concluding jurisdiction in intentional tort action requires
forum must be the “focal point” of the harm suffered and that defendant “expressly aimed his
conduct at the forum”).

corporation and that many of the submissions were made through localinsurance.com, an affiliate
of the plaintiff that is located in California. (Byrd Aff. ¶¶ 1-5). On similar facts, and with more
purposeful contacts by defendant directed at the forum state, courts have rejected jurisdiction.
See, e.g. ESAB Group, Inc. v. Centricut Inc., 126 F.3d 617 (4th Cir. 1997) (rejecting jurisdiction
of forum state where only connection with forum state was that defendant obtained sales leads
from company headquartered there; holding such contact does not “manifest behavior
intentionally targeted at and focused on South Carolina, such that [defendant] can be said to have
entered South Carolina in some fashion; allegations that the loss was felt in South Carolina,
where Plaintiff was headquartered “when unaccompanied by other contacts, is ultimately too
unfocused to justify personal jurisdiction.”); see also Griffis v. Luban, 646 N.W.2d 527 (Minn.
2002) (holding defendant’s posting of alleged defamatory statements to internet newsgroup
about forum state resident insufficient to confer jurisdiction in forum state).
In Far West Capital, the Tenth Circuit concluded that there was no jurisdiction where
there was “no evidence that defendants’ alleged torts had any connection to [the forum state]
beyond plaintiff’s corporate domicile.” 46 F.3d at 1080. The same can be said here. Plaintiff
has not met its burden of showing defendant’s minimum contacts with Colorado. Plaintiff has
not established any quantum of contacts that defendant had with Colorado such that defendant
could have expected to be haled into court here. And defendants affidavit confirms that no such
contacts exist. Nor has Plaintiff shown that defendant purposefully directed or aimed conduct at
Colorado. To find jurisdiction in this case would allow Plaintiff to assert jurisdiction anytime
anyone, anywhere submits information to its website, whether or not they know the location of
plaintiff’s domicile thus always allowing plaintiff to sue in its home state, without regard to the

Case 1:07-cv-00630-DME-MEH

Page 7 of 12

due process rights of defendant. Such far-reaching jurisdiction cannot be said to be reasonably
anticipated by defendant and offends notions of fair play and substantial justice.
In addition, in order to satisfy the minimum contact analysis under Colorado law, the
alleged injury must be direct, not consequential or remote. Amax Potash Corp. v. TransResources, Inc., 817 P.2d 598 (Colo. Ct. App. 1991); Wenz v. Memery Crystal, 55 F.3d 1503,
1508 (10th Cir. 1995). The plaintiff has failed to allege any specific harm caused by the alleged
tortuous interference. Rather, the allegations are in the nature of an impact to its reputation and
business relationships, and that it incurred costs to prevent recurring conduct. Neither of these
concepts are the direct result of any alleged fraud or tortuous interference claim. They are both
remote and consequential, at best.
Another factor considered in determining jurisdiction is the burden on the defendant.
Though not dispositive, this factor aids the Court in its assessment of the reasonable exercise of
personal jurisdiction. See World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 292. In the case at bar, the
defendant is an individual who has never traveled to the forum state. The plaintiff is a
corporation that generates between $7.2 Million and $21.6 Million annually from its sale of leads
to its agents, and claims to do business in all 50 states. The allegations in the complaint reveal
that the “value” of the alleged submitted requests is between $1,500 and $4,500. (See Exhibit
B).
In terms of actual requests for quotes, plaintiff claims to receive over 200,000 requests
for quotes each month. In its complaint, plaintiff contends that between October, 2006 and
February 17, 2006, plaintiff received over 500 “false submissions” from the defendant (See
Compl. ¶¶ 11, 19). Therefore, according to its own statistics, plaintiff received somewhere in the
neighborhood of 800,000 requests for quotes during this same period. Mathematically, the

defendant’s submissions represent approximately 0.0625% of the quotes received, a nominal
amount, which should be considered when compared to the inconvenience and costs that will be
borne by defendant should he be forced to appear and defend in Colorado.
II.

PLAINTIFF’S FRAUD CLAIM SHOULD BE DISMISSED PURSUANT TO RULE
12(B)(6) FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM.
A motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) should be granted if all the allegations of

the complaint, if true, are insufficient to state a claim within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ .P. 8(a).
McDonald v. Kinder-Morgan, Inc., 287 F.3d 992, 997 (10th Cir. 2002). In considering a
12(b)(6) motion, the court takes all well-pleaded allegations of the Complaint as true. However,
“conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice
to prevent a motion to dismiss." Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Association, 987 F.2d 278,
284 (5th Cir. 1993); see also Ruiz v. McDonnell, 299 F.3d 1173, 1181 (10th Cir. 2002). “Thus,
Rule 12(b)(6) requires dismissal if, taking all well-pleaded facts as true and construing them in
the light most favorable to plaintiff, it is clear that it can prove no set of facts entitling it to
relief.” See Perkins v. Johnson, No. 06-cv-01503, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10799, at *1-2 (D.
Colo. 2007) (citing Rocky Mountain Helicopters v. Bell Helicopters Textron, 24 F.3d 125, 128
(10th Cir. 1994)).
Plaintiffs must allege five elements to establish a claim for fraud under Colorado law: 1)
a false representation of a material existing fact; 2) knowledge on the part of the one making the
representation that it was false; 3) ignorance of the falsity on the part of the one to whom the
representation was made; 4) an intention that the representation be acted on; and 5) damages.
Concord Realty Co. v. Continental Funding Corp., 776 P.2d 1114 (Colo. 1989). A claim for
fraud requires proof that plaintiff relied upon the misrepresentation, and that reliance must have

been justified given the circumstances.” See Black v. First Federal Savings & Loan, 830 P.2d
1103 (Colo. App. 1992). Robert K. Schader, P.C. v. Etta Indus., 892 P.2d 363, 366 (Colo. Ct.
App. 1994). Moreover, fraud must be alleged with particularity in the Complaint. See Colo. R.
Civ. P. 9(b)(“In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake shall be stated with particularity.”); State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Parrish, 899
P.2d 285 (Colo. App. 1994) (“Colorado law requires that one who alleges fraud must plead it
with particularity so that the allegation cannot be easily made, and those accused of such
wrongdoing can be put on specific notice and have the ability to make a focused response.”).
Plaintiff has failed to plead its fraud claim with particularity. The central allegation of
plaintiff’s fraud claim is that defendant submitted information that “falsely indicated” that certain
persons were interested in receiving price quotations from plaintiff, when such persons were not
actually interested in receiving such quotations. (Compl. ¶¶ 54-60). Plaintiff has not identified
any single fraudulent representation, has not explained the content of any fraudulent
representation and has not put defendant on notice of what precisely it claims was fraudulent
about the submissions.
Moreover, the Complaint fails to allege any actual misrepresentation made to plaintiff
and that plaintiff relied on any of defendant’s alleged misrepresentations. See Black v. First
Federal Savings & Loan, 830 P.2d 1103 (Colo. App. 1992) (misrepresentation and reliance are
necessary elements of proving fraud). In order to understand the plaintiff’s claim, it is necessary
to understand the “representations” at issue. A copy of the relevant pages of the plaintiff’s
website is attached hereto as Exhibit C.2 As demonstrated by Exhibit C, plaintiff receives the

completed and submitted form, which is matched against its electronic database and “within
moments” the information is directed to the appropriate agent who had previously agreed to
purchase the type of lead generated by the form. Plaintiff is merely a conduit through which the
information is passed along to the appropriate agent. Thus, there is no misrepresentation that is
made to plaintiff, and plaintiff cannot, under any set of facts demonstrate that it justifiably relied
upon the contents of the submitted form since plaintiff never even views the information before
passing it along and instead simply transmits the form to the agent. Likewise, plaintiff has not
alleged justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, since, again, plaintiff only passes the
information along, without reviewing the information or relying on its content. Plaintiff has
failed to allege essential elements of a fraud claim and its claim should be dismissed. See, e.g.,
Catalan v. Vermillion Ranch Ltd. P'ship, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 567 (D. Colo. 2007), quoting
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1263 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that in order to sufficiently plead a
claim of fraud under F.R.C.P. § 9(b) that each of nine (9) allegations including “(1) a
representation, (2) that is false, (3) that is material, (4) the speaker's knowledge of its falsity or
ignorance of its truth, (5) the speaker's intent it be acted on, (6) the hearer's ignorance of the
falsity of the representation, (7) the hearer's reliance, (8) the hearer's right to rely on it, and (9)
injury must be present and that "failure to adequately allege any one of the nine elements is fatal
to the fraud claim.”). In this case, the plaintiff has failed to allege that a representation was made
to plaintiff and that plaintiff relied on the representation.
