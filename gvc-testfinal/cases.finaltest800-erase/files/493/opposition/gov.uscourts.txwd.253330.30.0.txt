Case No. 5:07-CV-00650
JUDGE ORLANDO GARCIA

DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL

I. Introduction
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is not well-taken, wastes the Court’s and the
parties’ resources, falsely accuses Defendant and its counsel of unethical conduct,
attempts to deflect attention away from Plaintiff’s decision to dispense medication
to a young child without physician approval – for which she was terminated – and it
should be denied as a matter of fact and law because:
•

Defendant has produced a complete and unaltered copy of
Plaintiff’s personnel file to her counsel, has allowed Plaintiff’s
counsel to review the original personnel file at Defendant’s facility
and has agreed to provide a color copy of Plaintiff’s personnel file to
Plaintiff’s counsel;

•

Defendant has no documentation regarding an alleged incident on
April 2, 2002 on the San Saba Unit, most likely because – as
reflected on the “counseling” form for that incident – the original
document was mailed to Plaintiff’s home for her to review, respond

and return it to the facility, which she never did. Moreover,
Defendant was owned by a different corporate entity in 2002 than
today and its current corporate parent does not have the former
corporate parent’s documents.
Plaintiff may not like those facts but it does not change them. There is nothing to
compel because Defendant has provided Plaintiff with what she has requested that
it has in its possession, custody or control. Respectfully, this could have and should
have been resolved between counsel rather than wasting the Court’s resources and
time by filing this Motion, just as Plaintiff’s request to extend the discovery period
was handled and agreed to by undersigned counsel.
II. Factual Summary
On February 18, 2008, Plaintiff served Defendant with 114 discovery
requests and a letter requesting to review Plaintiff’s original personnel file and
documents concerning a 2002 disciplinary issue.
Munday (“Munday Declaration”) at ¶ 3 and Ex. 1.

See Declaration of Chelsea
Apparently, Plaintiff’s counsel

had sent a letter via facsimile on January 16, 2008 requesting review of the
personnel file but had used the wrong area code and faxed it to the wrong phone
number. Munday Declaration at ¶ 4 and Ex. 2. Defendant initially believed that
Plaintiff had already received a copy of the personnel file, see Munday Declaration
at ¶ 5 and Ex. 3, and upon realizing that Plaintiff’s counsel had not previously
requested a copy despite their disclosure many months prior, provided a copy of the
personnel file via overnight mail. See Munday Declaration at ¶ 5 and Ex. 4.

Plaintiff again requested to see the original documents, and, as undersigned
counsel had offered to do previously if Plaintiff’s counsel had some question about
the documents’ authenticity, Defendant’s counsel agreed to allow an in person
inspection. See Munday Declaration at ¶ 6. Undersigned counsel then began the
process of coordinating the document review with Defendant’s Human Resources
Director and local counsel. Munday Declaration at ¶ 7.
In the meantime, Plaintiff sent a letter proposing March 18-20 as potential
dates for the review. See Munday Declaration at ¶ 7 and Ex. 5. Over the course of
the next few days, undersigned counsel continued to work with Defendant on a
proposed solution because Defendant’s Human Resources manager, the only
employee with access and authorization to allow such a review, would be out of the
office on vacation on the dates Plaintiff requested to review the file.
Declaration at ¶ 7.

Munday

Instead of postponing the review and refusing Plaintiff’s

request, Defendant sought another appropriate individual to conduct the review
and at 10:00 am on March 14, 2008, undersigned counsel informed Plaintiff’s
counsel it was still looking for such an appropriate person and would let her know
immediately once that was done. Munday Declaration at ¶ 7 and Ex. 6.
At 3:12 p.m., undersigned counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel via email that
the review could take place as proposed and that an appropriate representative
would be available on March 19, 2008, a date Plaintiff had previously told
Defendant she was available. Munday Declaration at ¶ 8 and Ex. 7. Nonetheless,
Plaintiff filed the pending Motion to Compel. See Docket Entry No. 25.

Since filing the Motion, Plaintiff’s counsel has viewed the personnel file.
Munday Declaration at ¶ 9. Apparently, there is some continuing confusion over
what documents constitute Plaintiff’s “personnel file,” because the “personnel file”
(along with other documents) have been produced in a variety of different forums
(e.g., to the Texas Board of Nursing, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, this litigation).

Undersigned counsel has attempted to clear up

whatever confusion there may be, see Munday Declaration at ¶ 9 and Exs. 8-10, but
Plaintiff’s counsel has refused to accept that explanation and persists in pursuing
this Motion.
III. Legal Analysis
A.

DEFENDANT HAS PRODUCED A COMPLETE COPY OF
PLAINTIFF’S PERSONNEL FILE, HAS AGREED TO
PRODUCE
A
COLOR
COPY
OF
PLAINTIFF’S
PERSONNEL FILE AND HAS ALLOWED PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL TO INSPECT PLAINTIFF’S PERSONNEL
FILE.

Defendant has agreed to everything that Plaintiff has requested in her
Motion regarding her personnel file.1 Her Motion therefore is moot and must be
denied. United States v. Mack, 48 F. Supp. 2d 708, 710 (S.D. Tex. 1999) (holding
motions concerning issues that had already been discussed were mooted and
therefore denied); Coopervision, Inc. v. Ciba Vision Corp., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
57111, *9-10 (E.D. Tex. 2007) (denying as moot a motion to compel documents that
had already been produced).
Plaintiff has also requested to depose the individual who physically bates numbered the
documents. If Plaintiff’s counsel wants to travel to Nashville, Tennessee and depose the individual
in undersigned counsel’s law firm copy department who placed the bates numbers on the documents,
she is welcome to do so but that is, respectfully, a waste of everyone’s time, energy, effort and money.

DEFENDANT HAS PRODUCED ALL DOCUMENTS IN
ITS
POSSESSION,
CUSTODY
OR
CONTROL
REGARDING AN ALLEGED INCIDENT IN APRIL OF
2002.

After a diligent search, Defendant has no documents in its possession,
custody or control regarding the alleged incident in April of 2002. As set forth
herein, the likely explanation for the lack of documentation is that Plaintiff took the
original disciplinary write-up home with her to review, respond to and return but
she never did. This is an important issue for Plaintiff because it is the only possible
fact – tenuous and remote in time as it is – that she has to support her allegation
that her termination in October of 2006 was in retaliation for filing a complaint
with the State four years earlier.
The documents to which Plaintiff’s counsel refers in her Motion and which
were attached an exhibit to Plaintiff’s deposition, were produced by Plaintiff, not
Defendant.

See Docket Entry 25 at Ex. E2.

Plaintiff’s Motion mocks Defense

counsel’s inquiries regarding the purported incident by claiming that Defendant
must know about the incident because of two questions counsel asked in Plaintiff’s
day long deposition and a fax cover sheet (which has no attachments) that she sent
to someone at The Brown Schools, which was Defendant’s prior corporate parent.
See Docket Entry 25 at 2-3 and Exs. D; E3. Undersigned inquiries were sincere and
remain sincere for the reasons stated herein.

The law is clear that a Motion seeking information that does not exist is moot
and must be denied. In re Merscorp Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10054, *14 (S.D.
Tex. 2008) (denying as moot a motion to compel depositions that already took place,
information that did not exist and documents the parties had stipulated were not
relevant).

That is exactly the situation here. Undersigned counsel has explained

this fact to Plaintiff’s counsel without avail.
IV. Conclusion
For the reason set forth herein, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel and, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(B), should award Defendant its
fees and costs for having to respond to this Motion.2

Attorneys for Defendant

Undersigned counsel estimates that Defendant has incurred approximately $2,000.00 in
attorneys’ fees in responding to Plaintiff’s Motion, see Munday Declaration at ¶ 10, and is willing to
submit proof of same if the Court determines that such an award is appropriate.
