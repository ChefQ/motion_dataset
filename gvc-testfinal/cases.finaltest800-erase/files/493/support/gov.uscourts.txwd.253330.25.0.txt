KIMBERLY GILYARD, RN'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT TO RESPOND TO PRODUCTION OF
ORIGINAL EMPLOYMENT RECORDS AND INCIDENT REPORTS

Kimberly Gilyard, RN (`Plaintiff') asks the Court to compel Texas Laurel Ridge
Hospital, LP d/b/a Laurel Ridge Hospital ("Defendant") to respond to production of original
employment records to Kimberly Gilyard, RN's discovery requests.

A. Introduction

1, Plaintiff is Kimberly Gilyard, RN; Defendant is Texas Laurel Ridge Hospital, LP
d/b/a Laurel Ridge Hospital.

2. Plaintiff sued defendant for discrimination, retaliation and harassment.

3. On February 18, 2008, (See Exhibit A); March 5, 2008, (See Exhibit B); and
March 11, 2008, (See Exhibit C) and continues to stall (See Exhibit D), counsel requested to
review the original personnel file of Kimberly Gilyard together with all original documents
including Incident Reports and any other relevant documentation related to the April 7, 2002

incident on the San Saba Unit. Defendant has not complied with this discovery request and the

Court should compel Defendant to comply.
ase,5:07-cv-00650-OLG Document 25 Filed 03/17/08 Page 2 of 25

4, Plaintiff conferred with Defendant in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute
without Court action, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(2)(B) and as shown in
the attached certificate of conference, and copies of correspondence (See Exhibit A-D), but was
unable to resolve the dispute. Plaintiff conferred with Defendant in a good faith effort to resolve
the dispute without Court action, as required by the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(2)(B)
and as shown the attached copies of repeated correspondence (See Exhibit A-D), but has been
unable to resolve the dispute.

B._ Argument

5. The Court may compel responses to discovery if a party does not (i) answer
questions submitted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30 or 31; (it) make a designation
under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a); (ii) answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33; or (iv)
respond to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34. FED R. Crv. P. 37(a)(2)(B).

6. Discovery may be obtained about any matter not privileged that is relevant to the
subject matter of the case. FED. R. Civ. P. 26(b). Information is discoverable if it appears
"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." Id.

7. The Court should grant Plaintiff's Motion to Compel for the following reasons:

a. Defendant has not provided Plaintiff with access to records which are material
and relevant to Plaintiffs claims and defenses in this lawsuit. The information
responsive to Plaintiffs request is necessary to this litigation because Defendant
has affirmatively represented that the material documentation (Plaintiffs reports to
State Agencies) do not exist. See Gilyard Deposition page 63, line 24-64, and line
15 (See Exhibit E).

b. Incredibly, counsel for Laurel Ridge stated that he "has no idea what the April 7,
2002 incident on the San Saba Unit" is. Plaintiff not only produced the
documents on January 11, 2008 as a supplement to discovery (P00106-00114)
(see Exhibit "E-2") but counsel-even examined Plaintiff on the subject at the time

of her deposition. (See Gilyard Deposition page 63, line 24-64, and line 15
attached as Exhibit E.
 

Gase 5:07-cv-00650-OLG Document 25 Filed 03/17/08 Page 3 of 25

c. Defendant's retaliation against Plaintiff for reporting violations of law to a State
Agency began in April 2002 when Defendant learned that Plaintiff had reported
violations of law and continued to report violations of staffing regulations through
the date of Plaintiff's discharge in October 2006. Defendant has alluded to
violations of patient confidentiality laws and HIPPA associated with Plaintiff's
production of key documents to the EEOC all retained in support of her defense
of disciplinary actions. This evidence is material as Plaintiff can show that
Defendant's destruction of original documents in front of Plaintiff, and
necessitated Plaintiff retaining copies of records as Defendant could not be trusted
to maintain original documents and Plaintiff had to safe guard evidence.
d. Exhibit "E-3" attached is evidence that Plaintiff provided a copy of E-2 to
defendant's corporate Human Resources department on April 29, 2002. This
should be among Defendant's corporate records.
8. Kimberly Gilyard, RN asks that the Court award sanctions against Texas Laurel
Ridge Hospital, LP d/b/a Laurel Ridge Hospital for its refusal to comply with a lawful discovery
request. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(A). Plaintiff asks the Court to award sanctions against
Defendant. The affidavit of Elizabeth L. Higginbotham, RN, JD, in support of the sanction, is
attached as Exhibit F.

9, The sanction requested is the least severe sanction available to meet the wrong.

C. Conclusion

10. | Defendant has no reasonable or credible basis to prevent Plaintiff's counsel from
inspecting material evidence. Therefore, Court should compel Defendant to respond adequately
and should award Plaintiff sanctions associated with obtaining compliance with the rules.

Respectfully submitted,

Subject: Re: Gilyard v. Laurel Ridge

Dear Mark, ,

I have made at least three requests to view the original personnel file. I want to see the entire original file.
As you have local counsel in San Antonio, I am certainly able to drive there and view the records; there is no
need for either of us to fly anywhere. Regarding the depositions, I want four separate days as I anticipate
that the nurses--Shelly, Shaun, Shawn and Kathy will take three full days and the three doctors can be done
back to back in one day.

With regard to your request to depose my clients, 1 am happy to produce Barbara Starks after the depositions)
that I have requested are done as she obviously has personal knowledge of how black and white nurses are
treated differently after alleged medication errors.

Concerning Ms. Warren, please advise your client to cease retaliating against her by assigning insufficient
staff to her Unit for the purported excuse that the MHWs are "refusing" to work with her. This is a violation of
licensing standards and is subject to TDFPS and DSHS reporting. If your facility cannot provide sufficient
staff, Ms. Warren will be forced to invoke Safe Harbor to protect her license and the patients. Please advise
Ms. Fincher that Laurel Ridge must abide by the law and accept a Safe Harbor refusal. Ms. Fincher has in the
past stated that Safe Harbor does not exist and advised nurses to "turn in your keys and your badge" if they
tried to refuse an assignment.

Regards,
Liz Higginbotham

Lie

Tranks for your email. i don't want to quibble with you over how many times that
you have requested the file but | do want to get it straight. ('m only aware of your
letter of February 18 and your letter of yesterday requesting to review {he original
file, NW there is another request, please let me know. In any event, | am going to
send you a copy of the original file, with Bates Numbers, today and you should have
it tomorrow. We will coordinate with our local counsel ana send you @ Coupie dates
that you can view the original at their offices in San Antonio.

Let's go ahead and get a couple of dates for the depositions of Ms. Starks and Ms.
Warren. Jam fine with doing those two after the ones that you have requested but 4
do not want to make a separate trip tar them. | proposed the first two weeks of
April for depositions in ane of my recent letters to you. De those dates work? De
you have any interest in double tracking the deps so we can get done in half the
time?

     

With respect to Ns. Warren, do you have some knowledge that MAWs have net
refused to work with her? lf not, why de say itis a "purported" excuse? De
have Ms. Fincher on tape saying that Safe Harbor does not exist and advisine nurses
to turn in thely keys and badge if they tried to refuse an assignment? Niayow you ae
and if so, please let me know, because our cllent denies that same is occurring. |
can't exactly advise my client to stop doing something that they're not doing but I
will pass your message along to therm. just as | have your others.
