DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO UNITED STATES MOTION
FOR ORDER REGARDING WAIVER OF
CLIENT--ATTORNEY PRIVILEGE

 

 

Comes now the Defendant, Albert Gonzalez, acting pro se,
and respectfully submits Defendant's Response To United States
Motion For Order Regarding Waiver Of Client-Attorney Privilege,
ana states the following:

On 03/24/2011, Defendant filed a Motion under 28 U.S.C.
$2255 to vacate his conviction and sentence. On April 8, 2071,
the United States filed a Motion seeking an Order from the
Court regarding waiver of attorney-client privilege. The
Government cites a number of cases from various federal circuits
in support of it's argument "that when a 2255 petitioner calls
into question the representations of his former lawyers he/she
waives tne attorney-client privilege rights under the Sixth
Amendment". Three of the cases cited by the Government are
unreported decisions from the District of Massachusetts that
are relevant to the waiver of attorney-client privilege rights.
Due to Defendant's incarceration and limited access to unreported

decisions defendant has no way of knowing what the unreported

tT.

decisions hold or how they apply to the issue of attorney-
client privilege rights. The Government cites the following
unreported decisions: Tibbs v. United States, Civil No.
02-11265-NG (D-Mass.)(Woodlock,J.); Vavlitis v. United States,
Civil No. 97-10902-EFH (D.Mass.)(Harrington,J.} and Devaney v.

United States, 97-10957-WGY (Young,J.).

In Lebron v. Sanders, 553 F.3d 152 (2nd Cir. 2009) the

 

Court held "Opposing counsel was required to have provided
pro se habeas petitioner who was prison inmate proceeding in
forma pauperis, printed copies of opinions cited in opposing
counsel's submissions to district court that were cither
unreperted or reported exclusively on fee-based electronic

database" Id. at 154.

CONCLUSION

The Defendant respectfully moves the Court te direct the
opposing counsel for the United States to provide Defendant
with printed copies of the above cited unreported opinions
and direct that further cited unreported opinions be accompanied
by a printed copy;

Further Defendant requests that the Court hold in abayance
it's ruling on the United States's Motion For Order Regarding
Waiver Of Attorney-Client Privilege until such time that the
United States provides Defendant with copies of the refered to

unreported cases and Defendant has had opportunity to respond

to United State's Motion.
Respectfully submitted

 

Albert Gonzalez, pro se.
