Defendant,

DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE REGARDING WAIVER OF
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILIGE RIGHTS

Comes now the Defendant, Albert Gonzalez, acting pro se,
and respectfully submits defendant's response to United States's
request that Defendant waive his Attorney-CGlient Privilege rights
in regards to Defendant's pending motion under 28 U.S.0. $2255,
and states the following.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

On 03/24/2011, Defendant filed a motion under 28 U.S.C.
$2255 to vacate his conviction and sentence. On April 8, 2011,
the United States filed a Motion seeking an Order from the Court
directing that Defendant has waived his attorney-client privilege
rights by raising claims in his 2255 motion that his attorney's
had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. On 04/21/2011,
Defendant filed a motion requesting that attorneys for the United
States provide Defendant with copies of three (3) unreported
cases cited in the United States's April 8, 2011, motion regarding
defendant's waiver of attorney-client privilege rights. On June
2, 2001, Defendant received the requested three unreported
cases mailed to him on 05/24/2011, by counsel for the United
States.

LIMITED WAIVER OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE RIGHTS

i Albert Gonzalez, the Defendant herein agree to a limited
waiver of my attorney-client privilege rights. My waiver is
restricted to the scope of the ineffective assistance of counsel
claim I have raised in my pending motion under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A72255.

DEFENDANT'S REQUEST FOR ORDER DIRECTING UNITED STATES
ATTORNEY'S NOT TO EXCEED THE SCOPE OF DEFENDANT'S
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE WAIVER

The Defendant requests an Order from the Court directing the
Government attorneys not.to exceed the scope cf Defendant's
waiver of his attorney-client privilege rights. The United States's
request for an Order "authorizing and directing Attorney's Rene
Palomino and Martin Weinberg to disclose to counsel for the
United States correspondance, notes and memoranda chronicling
verbal communications, and such other information and matters as
may be reasonably necessary to respond to the 0x00A72255 Motion
submitted by Gonzalez in this case".

Although the Government states "necessary to respond to the
0x00A72255 Motion", the request is overbroad and the Government's
interpretation of what is "reasonably necessary" if not restrained
by the Court will no doubt exceed the scope of Detendant's

waiver of his attorney-client privilege rights.0x00B0 (U.S. Motion

page 4, Exhibit A).

o

 

: / Defendant submits that a pre-evidentiary hearing waiver of
his attorney-client privilege rights violates his due process
rights under the 5th amendment. Because Defendant cannot cross-
examine an affidavit on the truth or correctness of the statements
nade therein, Defendant preserves his right pursuant to HARRIS

v. NELSON, 394 U.S. 286, 22 L Ed 2d 281, 89 S.ct 1082 (1968), for
obtaining interrogatories from affiants where affidavits are
submitted into evidence.

privilege rights concerning and limited to the ineffective
assistance of counsel claims raised in his pending 0x00A72255
motion, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court enter
an Order directing counsel for the United States to limit or
restrict thier request to attorneys Rene Palomino and Martin
Weinberg, for the disclosure of priviliged communications
specifically to the ineffective assistance of counsel claims

raised in Defendant's pending 0x00A72255 motion.
