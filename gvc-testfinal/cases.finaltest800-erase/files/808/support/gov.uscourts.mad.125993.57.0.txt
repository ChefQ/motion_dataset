MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF ONE WEEK TO RESPOND TO
PETITION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 2255
The United States, by its undersigned counsel, moves this Court for a one week extension
of time in which to respond to the Petition Under Section 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct
Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody filed by Albert Gonzalez (the “Petition”).
On July 6, 2011, the government moved that it be permitted to file its response to Gonzalez’s
Petition under 28 U.S.C. §2255 three weeks after his counsel disclosed formerly attorney-client
privileged communications as directed by the Courts. In his Petition, Albert Gonzalez put these
communications squarely in issue, and by filing his Petition waived his privilege with respect to
them. The United States required access to the formerly privileged communications between
Gonzalez and his counsel to respond to the Petition.
By electronic orders on July 7, 2011 in 08-CR-10223-PBS and 09-CR-10292, and on August
30, 2011 in 09-CR-10382-DPW, the Courts granted the government’s motion without objection.
Disclosure was slowed by Mr. Weinberg’s need to consult with his former client, but was completed
by letter dated November 10, 2011. The government’s response is therfore due on December 1,
2011.

Case 1:09-cr-10382-DPW Document 57 Filed 11/30/11 Page 2 of 2

The government requests a one week continuance until December 8, 2011 in which to

requested.
Respectfully submitted,
