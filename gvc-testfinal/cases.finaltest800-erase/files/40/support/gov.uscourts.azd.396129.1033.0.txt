Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Motion

17 For Reconsideration Of Portions Of Court's Order At Dkt. #1009 RE: Fourth Amendment
18 Suppression Issues. LRCiv 7.2(g) states that a motion for reconsideration may be brought if
19 there is “manifest error or a showing of new facts or legal authority that could not have been
20 brought to its attention earlier with reasonable diligence. Any such motion shall point out
21 with specificity the matters that the movant believes were overlooked or misapprehended by
22 the Court, any new matters being brought to the Court’s attention for the first time and the
23 reasons they were not presented earlier, and any specific modifications being sought in the
24 Court’s Order.” Id. The defendant separates this motion for reconsideration into three
25 primary sections: (1) Manifest Errors of Fact, (2) Manifest Errors of Law, and (3)
26 Modifications Of The Order Being Sought. All listed errors are manifest errors.[1] In light

Preparing a motion addressing all manifest errors of fact and law would take longer
than

Manifest Errors of Fact

1.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 5, ln. 6-8: “The rental application

9 listed a fake California driver's license bearing a number that belonged to a female with a
10 different name...”; (b) Dkt. #1009, p. 8, ln. 27-28: “Defendant provided a forged California
11 driver's license in Brawner's name, along with a driver's license number assigned to a living
12 female.”; (c) Dkt. #1009, p. 9, ln. 1-6: “Defendant rented a storage unit using the identity of
13 Daniel Aldrich, a deceased person, with a fraudulent driver's license number assigned to
14 another living person. [] Defendant... used yet another person's driver's license number in
15 connection with the Stout identification...”; (d) Note: this is only a sampling. The Court
16 repeatedly noted how IDs used by the defendant had driver license numbers that did not
17 correspond to the names on the IDs.;
18

Correction Supported By Evidence: Whenever there was an ID card from the

19 evidence, the driver license number on the card was invented, i.e., made up.[2] The
20 defendant also made this clear in a prior declaration.[3] Therefore, the Court erroneously
21 counted each ID card as two assumed identities. In other words, the Court counted each
22 made-up driver license number as an additional so-called “fraudulent identity” entirely
23 separate from any identity actually used by the defendant. Because the defendant could not
24 have known that the made-up ID numbers actually belonged to other people, it was manifest

See defendant's Declaration RE: Daniel Rigmaiden had no plans for a “quick escape”
26 or “quick departure,” made no “preparations to flee,” was not ready to “abandon the
apartment on a moment's notice,” and did not maintain a storage unit as part of an “escape
27 plan”, p. 5-6, ¶ 12 (EXHIBIT 01).

1 error for the Court to engage in double counting during its hyperbole. See Flores-Figueroa v.
2 United States, 129 S.Ct. 1886 (2009) (if defendant obtains fake ID card under his name but
3 uses ID number of another person, government must prove he knew the ID number belonged
4 to another person). In the present case, the government did not and cannot allege, let alone
5 prove, prior knowledge regarding the made-up ID numbers on driver licenses. Therefore,
6 while determining the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy, the Court factually
7 erred by counting each made-up ID number as an additional so-called “fraudulent identity”

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 7, ln. 23-24: “It is also true,

10 however, that Defendant was prepared to abandon the apartment on a moment's notice.”; (b)
11 Dkt. #1009, p. 8, ln. 7-10: “Given Defendant's preparations to flee and his admission that he
12 would have done so had he learned of the government's investigation, it could be argued that
13 Defendant had already formed an intent to abandon his aircard, computer, and apartment.”;
14 (c) Dkt. #1009, p. 34, ln. 19-20: “Defendant argues that he would have fled and never been
15 found if the warrant had been served...”;
16

Correction Supported By Evidence: First, the defendant never stated that he was

17 prepared to abandon his apartment at all. The defendant had no intent and made no
18 preparations to abandon his apartment.[4] He stated that he would move[5] after packing up
19 his belongings and cleaning the apartment[6]—something a person does when properly
20 ending a 10-month lease, not something someone does when “fleeing” as the Court
21 fallaciously asserted in its order. Likewise, the defendant did not state that he would “flee on
22

or “quick departure,” made no “preparations to flee,” was not ready to “abandon the
24 apartment on a moment's notice,” and did not maintain a storage unit as part of an “escape
plan”, p. 1, ¶ 2 (EXHIBIT 01).
25 5.
See Dkt. #824-1, p. 322 (Had the defendant been given notice that the government
was violating his civil rights via the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS, “within the 18 day period
26 after the aircard had been located... the defendant would have... packed up his belongings
and permanently moved from apartment No. 1122.” (emphasis added)).

Dkt. #824-2, p. 4, ¶ 14 (“Had I received notice of the aircard locating mission, within
a

I
would have permanently left apartment No. 1122 after packing up my belongings and
28

1 a moment's notice.” The Court's assertion has no basis in fact and is unsupported by the
2 record. The defendant made very clear in his declaration that he would have moved within
3 a day after packing up his belongings and cleaning his apartment. One day is not a
4 “moment's notice,” but a reasonably estimated move out period considering the defendant's
5 studio apartment was only 489 ft².[7] In fact, this is more time than it would take most people
6 to pack up and move from a 489 ft² space. The defendant calculated in extra time
7 considering he had no car and had no driver license.[8]

Furthermore, the defendant never made an admission that he would flee “had he

9 learned of the government's investigation.” The Court's assertion has no basis in fact and is
10 unsupported by the record. The defendant made very clear in his declaration that he would
11 have moved within a day after packing up his belongings and cleaning his apartment only if
12 he would have been served with a copy of the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order.[9] By
13 being served with a copy of the unconstitutional order—which contains no details of the
14 underlying investigation—the defendant would have only learned of the government
15 violating his Fourth Amendment rights. Obviously a difficult concept for the Court and
16 government to grasp, the defendant highly values his Constitutional rights and would have
17 moved in order to prevent further degradation of those rights by overzealous government
18 agents.[10] By moving, the defendant would have eliminated the poisonous fruits of the
19 government's illegal search.[11] This is the same remedy (i.e., the suppression remedy) used

1 by courts when seeking to alter government activity so that it complies with the Fourth
2 Amendment. It was then and it is now the defendant's belief that making such a stand
3 against overzealous government activity is every citizen's right and duty.[12] The defendant's
4 original declaration (Dkt. #824-2) contained no reason for the move and it was manifest error
5 for the Court to make up its own reason and present it as fact.
6

The Court also claimed that “Defendant argues that he would have fled and never

7 been found...” The Court's assertion has no basis in fact and is unsupported by the record.

8 The defendant never claimed that he would have “fled and never been found.” The
9 defendant made clear in his reply brief that “there would have been nothing for the
10 government to seize and nobody for the government to arrest during the in-person search
11 of apartment No. 1122 on August 3, 2008.”[13] Contrary to the Court's assessment,
12 “forever” does not exist within the single, lone day of August 3, 2008. The defendant's point
13 is clear: had he been served with a copy of the unconstitutional N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS
14 order, the August 3, 2008 “in-person search of apartment No. 1122 would have never
15 produced evidence or the defendant[]”[14] because he would have “moved from apartment
16 No. 1122 with all of his belongings before the government's execution of the N.D.Cal. 0817 70460-HRL/PVT search warrant.”[15] Whether the government would have followed the
18 defendant to his new home or stopped him along the way is unknown. Whether a new search
19 warrant for his new home would have been obtained and executed is unknown. The
20 government submitted no scenarios for the Court to consider. What is clear is that the
21 August 3, 2008 execution of the N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT search warrant would not
22 have produced evidence had the government served the defendant with a copy of the
23 N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order. Nothing more, nothing less. The Court's hyperbole only

3.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 8, ln. 3-7: “The government also

3 asserted during oral argument, without contradiction from Defendant, that Defendant's rented
4 storage unit was found to contain $70,000 in cash, a United States passport issued to
5 Defendant in the name of Andrew Johnson (a deceased individual), and a computer with
6 back-up information from Defendant's laptop, all apparently awaiting a quick departure.”;
7 (b) Dkt. #1009, p. 9-8, ln. 27-28 & 1-2: “What's more, while living in the apartment under

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:

CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 false pretenses, Defendant had $70,000 in cash, a false passport, and a copy of his laptop
9 computer in a storage unit (also rented under false pretenses) ready for a quick escape.”;
10

Correction Supported By Evidence: First, the purpose of the defendant maintaining a

11 storage unit was simply for the storage of property.[16] The defendant did not maintain a
12 storage unit to facilitate a quick departure. The government and Court's assertions to the
13 contrary are ludicrous and entirely contrary to fact and truth.
14

Second, the defendant never agreed to the government's assumption that the items in

15 the storage unit were there for a “quick departure” or “quick escape,”[17] as the Court
16 fallaciously asserted in its order. The March 28, 2013 hearing was not an evidentiary hearing
17 and the government presented no evidence that the defendant was required to rebut.
18 Nevertheless, the government's claim made for the first time on March 28, 2013 was framed
19 as an assumption, not a fact supported by evidence:

22
23
24

I think it's a very safe assumption that if Mr. Rigmaiden wanted to drop out of
sight and change identities, he could have done it instantaneously. We know he
could have done that, because when we executed the search warrant for the
storage unit, we found a facially valid U.S. passport in the name of Johnson...
He had over $70,000 in cash... and, oh, by the way, a backup computer with all
of his information...

plan”, p. 3-4, ¶ 6 (EXHIBIT 01).

Third, there was no computer in the storage unit as assumed by the government.[18]

2 The items that were seized from the storage unit are listed in the return on the record at Dkt.
3 #846-3. As the return shows, there was no computer or laptop in the storage unit.
4

Fourth, not only did the defendant have no plans for a “quick escape,” he could not

5 have made a “quick escape” considering he did not own a car and had no driver license.[19]
6 This is why the defendant indicated in his earlier declaration that it would take him “a day”
7 to move from his apartment after cleaning it—hardly a “quick escape.”

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8

Fifth, the government failed to present any evidence that the storage unit was part of a

9 plan for a “quick escape.” For example, the government presented no statements by the
10 defendant, and no files or emails from the defendant's home computer detailing an escape
11 plan involving the storage unit or any escape plan for that matter. Agents have been
12 searching through the defendant's data for 3+ years and found no such evidence. This is why
13 the government framed its statement at the March 28, 2013 motions hearing as an
14 assumption, not a fact.
15

Sixth, the storage unit records and the combination to the lock for the storage unit was

16 found in the defendant's apartment during the August 3, 2008 search.[20][21] It does not
17 logically follow that a person would keep the combination and rental records of a storage
18 unit at the very location he planned to “escape” from. In addition to having no basis in fact,
19 the Court and government's assertions have no basis in common sense.
20

4.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 8, ln. 13-14: “Defendant purchased

21 the aircard in May of 2006 using the name of a living person, Travis Rupard.”;
22

Correction Supported By Evidence: The defendant did not purchase the aircard using

23 the name of Travis Rupard. This point was reiterated in numerous briefs and other
24 documents that have been on the record for months. As the defendant's declaration states, he

1 purchased his aircard using cash without giving a name.[22] In fact, the defendant purchased
2 several aircards in 2006 before deciding which one to activate after the purchases were
3 made. It was manifest error for the Court to adopt the government's unsupported assertion
4 over the defendant's uncontested declaration.
5

5.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 8, ln. 17-19: “He used a fraudulent

6 Visa card in Johnson's name to purchase the computer, and procured the Visa card by using
7 Johnson's Social Security Number.”; (b) Dkt. #1009, p. 8, ln. 19-20: “The Ninth Circuit has

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 held that a defendant does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in computer
9 equipment obtained through fraud.”;
10

Correction Supported By Evidence: A recurring theme, the Court builds a straw man

11 to better suit an application of Caymen, 404 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2005) (defendant used a
12 stolen credit card to purchase a computer). The Court presented the facts as if the defendant
13 had used a fraudulent credit card to purchase his home computer; resulting in monetary loss
14 to a victim. Contrary to the Court's straw man, the defendant purchased his computer using a
15 “stored value card,” i.e., a prepaid debit card funded with his own money. The defendant's
16 uncontested declaration states that he used a WiredPlastic card of which he purchased and
17 funded himself[23]—not a credit card belonging to another person, as fallaciously asserted by
18 the Court in its order. There is a crucial difference, i.e., the “fraud” and “theft” factual
19 elements present in Caymen are not present here.
20

6.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 10, ln. 18-20: The Court

21 commented on the facts of Bautista, 362 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2004) in order to distinguish them
22 from the facts of the present case. To distinguish the two cases and support a finding that the
23 defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his home, the Court noted the
24 following about the search in Bautista: “Third, law enforcement officers conducted no
25 investigation of the defendant's use of the stolen credit card before entering the room...”;
26

Correction Supported By Evidence: In the present case, it is also a fact that the

1 government conducted no investigation into any of the so-called “fraud” of which the Court
2 relied to support its finding that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in
3 his home residence. The government knew nothing about the defendant's use of the Steven
4 Brawner name to rent the apartment until after FBI technical agents had operated the
5 StingRay to locate the apartment.

7.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 13, ln. 18-20: “The intrusion that

7 allowed agents to locate the aircard – using a mobile tracking device to send signals to and

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 receive signals from the aircard – was not a 'severe intrusion.'”;
9

Correction Supported By Evidence: The government already conceded that “the

10 aircard tracking operation was a Fourth Amendment search and seizure.”[24] A Fourth
11 Amendment search and seizure, by definition, is a “severe intrusion.” Additionally, see
12 Section II(B), infra, explaining how both the Court and government agreed to accept and not
13 challenge the defendant's identification/classification of independent government actions into
14 separate Fourth Amendment searches and seizures.
15

8.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 33, ln. 6-9: “Moreover, the warrant

16 specifically required the government to 'expunge all of the data' at the conclusion of the
17 tracking mission. [] The government explained that this was done precisely because the
18 device captured information from cell phones and aircards unrelated to this investigation.”;
19 (b) Dkt. #1009, p. 31, ln. 16-19: “[T]he evidence presented by the government and
20 Defendant shows that the third-party information was deleted from the mobile tracking
21 device immediately after the aircard was located.”;
22

Correction Supported By Evidence: The government's purpose for deleting all data

23 gathered by the StingRay and KingFish was not to protect third-parties. If that was the case,
24 the government would have still preserved the data relating specifically to the defendant's
25 aircard. Additionally, if that was the case, the government would have immediately deleted
26 the third-party data on July 17, 2008, after use of the equipment had concluded, rather than

1 wait until after the defendant's arrest on August 3, 2008.[25] Clearly, deleting all data,
2 including the evidence relating to the defendant's location, was done to hide details of the
3 device from the defense. Additionally, the government had at least 18 days to rummage
4 through third-party data seized from third-party cell phones and aircards prior to deletion.
5 The Court's claim that the third-party data and actual evidence in this case was deleted
6 “immediately after the aircard was located” is just more fallaciousness and contradiction to
7 prior findings.[26] The government did not have third-party privacy interests in mind.

Manifest Factual Errors: (a) Dkt. #1009, p. 48, ln. 18-20: “As the government

9 argues, 'agents were using a relatively new technology, and they faced a lack of legal
10 precedent regarding the proper form of a warrant to obtain the location information they
11 sought.'”;
12

Correction Supported By Evidence: It is common knowledge that the FBI has been

13 using cell site emulators since the 1990s.[27] In February of 2009, one FBI agent testified
14 that he alone used such equipment more than 300 times over the last nine years.[28] This was
15 not “new” technology to the government in the year 2008. It was only “new” to countless
16 judges—including the judge presiding over this case—who were kept in the dark for a
17 number of years prior to the defendant exposing the government's warrantless and illegal use
18 of the equipment.

Correction Supported By Evidence: First, the Court failed to recognize that Quality

5 Alarm Service assisted FBI Agent Richard J. Murray in his effort to physically seize the
6 geolocation data from the physical readers at the Domicilio apartment complex. The
7 subpoena was used as if it were a warrant executed by a federal agent. On July 24, 2008,

8 FBI Agent Murray and an employee from Quality Alarm Service went to the Domicilio
9 apartment complex to physically retrieve the defendant's historical electronic gate key access
10 records from various gates.[29]
11

Second, the data was not retained by the alarm company, it was stored by Domicilio

12 and the transactions were between the defendant and Domicilio.[30] Domicilio was not the
13 target of the subpoena.
14

Third, other than to law enforcement, the uselessness of the geolocation data to

15 Domicilio and Quality Alarm Service's business model is unsurprising considering it was
16 kept in an inaccessible, crashed database of which a Domicilio employee had only recently
17 learned about.[31]

The Court overlooked the defendant's argument that the N.D.Cal.
08-90330MISC order was not executed by the FBI technical agents
who operated the equipment used to locate the aircard.

To recap the defendant's argument regarding non-execution: (1) there was no return

4 filed with any court, (2) no one was ever served with the order, (3) the government is unable
5 to produce evidence purportedly gathered under the order, (4) the government is unable to
6 produce a single agent who can say he/she executed the order, and (5) the issuing magistrate
7 permitted the government to arbitrarily edit the order's terms prior to execution and without

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 judicial oversight. The mere existence of an order—which may have been edited by the
9 government after it was issued—and a prosecutor's self-serving assertion that it was executed
10 by unnamed agents is not sufficient to show that it was actually executed or that purported
11 executing agents apprised themselves of the terms of the order. See Beier v. City of
12 Lewiston, 354 F.3d 1058, 1069 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[T]he mere existence of a warrant provides
13 little useful information to the officers.”); United States v. Whitten, 706 F.2d 1000, 1009-10
14 (9th Cir. 1983) (“Officers conducting a search should read the warrant or otherwise become
15 fully familiar with its contents...”). It was manifest error for the Court to ignore this
16 argument.
17
18

1. The government's claim that non-technical agents witnessed the
FBI technical agents operate the StingRay and KingFish lacks
credibility.

19

During the March 28, 2013 hearing, AUSA Battista responded to the Court's question

20 asking how the government might prove that the order was actually executed:
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

[THE COURT:] ... Mr. Rigmaiden has argued that there is no evidence
in this case that the warrant, Document 330, or Order 330, was used in the
process of the mobile tracking device operation, was in the hands of the agents
or was actually giving them guidance in the process. What is your response to
that?
MR. BATTISTA: Your Honor, obviously the government is not willing
to disclose the identity of the technical agents, but there are witnesses who
have observed the technical agents doing their activities and can hearsay the
fact that they personally have spoken to the technical agents, and the technical
agents were provided a copy of the order and reviewed the order....
So the government, through -- if the Court needs it, the government is
prepared through hearsay testimony to say that the agents had been spoken to,
they were provided a copy of the warrant, they did review the warrant, they

were observed operating the equipment,...
March 28, 2013 Motion Hearing Transcript, p. 67-68 (emphasis added).

3 In other words, the government asserted that it would be willing to bring in the case agents to
4 hearsay testify that they saw the FBI technical agents operate the StingRay and KingFish
5 while the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order was in hand. AUSA Battista's claim made on
6 March 28, 2013 directly contradicted his claim made in support of a different argument
7 raised on September 22, 2011:

CR08-814-PHX-DGC

[THE COURT:] Mr. Rigmaiden has been arguing that the government
was using a StingRay produced by Harris. This document seems to support
that.

THE COURT: Yeah, please.

[MR. BATTISTA:] In the law enforcement world, there's a StingRay
and then there's the generic term “StingRay” meaning all types of devices. The
five case agents were using the term “StingRay” as the term “Kleenex.” They
did not operate the equipment. They did not know what the equipment is.
They didn't receive any training on the equipment.
...None of the five investigators know the make, model, manufacturer of
the exact equipment. There were tech agents out there. They're the ones who
possessed the equipment, operated the equipment.
...They don't know. It could be a StingRay. It could not be. It could be
something else. They didn't know what it was. They didn't see it...
September 22, 2011 Motion Hearing, Partial Transcript of Proceedings, p. 3536 (emphasis added).

21 The above discrepancy raises the classic lawyer question: “Were you lying then, or are you
22 lying now?” Rather than continue to ignore it, the defendant requests that the Court address
23 the defendant's argument regarding the government's failure to execute the N.D.Cal. 0824 90330MISC-RS order. Especially in light of AUSA Battista's post hoc recharacterization of
25 relevant facts designed to quell the Court's concerns raised on March 28, 2013. This is, in
26 effect, new evidence considering the defendant only recently received the transcript for the
27 March 28, 2013 hearing.

The Court overlooked the independent search/seizure concessions
established at the January 27, 2012 status conference and ignored
the defendant's scope arguments applying those concessions to the
N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC and 08-90331MISC-RS orders.

3

As the below quoted transcript shows, both the Court and the government agreed on

1

4 January 27, 2012 that (1) the defendant would be permitted to identify and classify separate
5 government actions into independent Fourth Amendment searches and seizures, and (2) the
6 government would not later argue that each independent government action fails to meet the
7 definition of a search and/or seizure—unless the defendant makes a silly argument such as

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 classifying “the act of driving the vehicle[]” as a Fourth Amendment search:[36]
9

[THE DEFENDANT:] But, I mean, even with the Government
conceding that a search and seizure occurred, like I was saying earlier, I have
to prove specific action[s] for searches and seizures. At least that's my
interpretation of the cases I've read.

10
11

So I can't just subtract that whole [factual] section out of my
[suppression] motion just because they conceded that some type of search,
some type of seizure occurred. They haven't actually identified what they
searched or what they seized.
…

12
13
14

THE COURT: ... Tell me in a nutshell what it is you're saying, because I
agree, Mr. Rigmaiden needs to know --

15
16

MR. BATTISTA: Sure.

17

THE COURT: -- what he should have to address.

18

MR. BATTISTA: Well, Your Honor, I think the position of the
Government is that, you know, we are conceding in the abstract that what the
Government did and the Court can assume is a search or seizure. But the
defendant still has the burden of showing that he had an expectation of privacy
in whatever was searched or seized....
...

19
20
21

[THE COURT:] Well, so for purposes of what Mr. Rigmaiden is going
to be writing, and to be very clear, the Government is conceding that the
actions it took in the air card locating mission were sufficiently intrusive to
constitute a Fourth Amendment search and seizure if the defendant had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the air card, in the laptop, in the
apartment, in the signals that were sent out by the air card, et cetera?

22
23
24
25

MR. BATTISTA: Correct, Your Honor.

26

THE COURT: So it sounds like you do need to address reasonable
expectation of privacy, Mr. Rigmaiden.

[THE COURT:] Mr. Rigmaiden doesn't have to prove [for example] that
the Government wrote data to the air card in order to show that the action was
sufficiently intrusive to constitute a Fourth Amendment search, because the
Government is conceding the intrusiveness part of the Fourth Amendment
analysis.
MR. BATTISTA: Correct, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you agree with that? Namely, you agree that you are
conceding that -- well, it's what I've already said, that the air card locating
mission was sufficiently intrusive to trigger Fourth Amendment protection if he
has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, he doesn't have to prove
the intrusiveness of any particular action in order to establish it was sufficiently
intrusive for a Fourth Amendment violation.
MR. BATTISTA: That's correct.... So but that, I think the defendant's
concern there is that goes more to possibly the Government having exceeded
the scope of the order. I think that's what the defendant has said.
[THE COURT:] Do you have things you wanted to say on this, Mr.
Rigmaiden?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. Does that mean [][I] don't have to prove all
of these individual, specific actions were searches and seizures? Like the
Government is now conceding that if, as a factual matter, I can prove that they
wrote data to the air card, then that was a Fourth Amendment search and
seizure. And if as a factual matter I can prove that they deactivated encryption
or read data from the air card, seized stored data on the air card, as long as I
can prove all of that as a factual matter, then I don't have to actually prove that
those are Fourth Amendment searches and seizures, because they are already
admitting that they are. Is that what the Government -THE COURT: The way I think I would say it, and see if this is right, Mr.
Battista, is -MR. BATTISTA: I'm listening, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Yeah, I want you to hear this. Let's take writing data to
the air card as one example. Let's take increasing power consumption on the
laptop as a second example. And let's take locating the air card precisely in the
apartment as a third example.
It seems to me what the Government has conceded is that any one of
those three is sufficiently intrusive to constitute a Fourth Amendment search if
Mr. Rigmaiden had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment and
the laptop and the air card.

27

We are not going to come back if he, for example, asserts that this
increased power consumption on the computer and argue, well, even if he had
a reasonable expectation of privacy in the computer, even if you find that,
Judge, increasing power isn't sufficiently intrusive to constitute a Fourth
Amendment search. You are not going to make that argument because you are
conceding intrusiveness. Is that correct?

28

MR. BATTISTA: Your Honor, I think that we would be willing to

25
26

- 16 -

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 17 of 48

concede that it is part of the search. I mean, I think we may end up arguing
with the defendant as to whether or not it's reasonable or not reasonable,
whether or not it exceeded the scope of the warrant or whatever. But I think
the -- obviously two and three that the Court mentioned, we would be
conceding that it was -- that that was part of the air card mission -- that would
possibly have been part of the air card mission. And that we had conceded
that all of the -- those aspects or similar aspects of the air card mission can
be considered a search by the Court.
...

THE COURT: Here's where I see it coming up. Let's say in his motion
to suppress he has three pages where he argues that you had Verizon write data
to the air card. Let's leave that one. Let's say he has three pages saying that
you wrote data to the air card, your device did that, puts in all of his facts. It
seems to me what you cannot come back and argue is, even if that's true,
Judge, writing data to an air card is not sufficiently intrusive to constitute
a Fourth Amendment search.

January 27, 2012 Status Conference, Partial Transcript of Proceedings, p. 1323 (emphasis added).

12

Contrary to the discussion at the January 27, 2012 hearing, the government argued in

13 its response brief (Dkt. #873) that the government actions identified/classified by the
14 defendant into independent searches and/or seizures were not searches or seizures at all, but
15 merely Dalia[37] style details of “how the Aircard is to be located or what actions will be
16 taken to locate the Aircard.” Dkt. #873, p. 51. Following the government's lead, the Court
17 then ignored all of the defendant's scope arguments, adopted the government's application of
18 Dalia, and denied the defendant's Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #824-1).
19

The Court dishonored the conditions and concessions upon which the suppression

20 issues were to be decided. It was manifest error for the Court to disregard the defendant's
21 scope challenges corresponding to what should have been uncontested, independent Fourth
22 Amendment searches and seizures. Other Courts have also recognized the types of
23 independent searches and seizures that were recognized by the Court and government on
24 January 27, 2012:
25

The “search” for which the Government seeks authorization is actually
two-fold: (1) a search for the Target Computer itself, and (2) a search for
digital information stored on (or generated by) that computer....
Here... the installation of software which will “extract” (i.e. seize) the
computer data... is itself a search or seizure that separately requires a warrant.

7 (2) the aircard, and (3) the host laptop computer used with the aircard.[38] Likewise, the

The government claimed[41] that it was relying upon the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS

20 order to justify the nine conceded, independent searches and seizes listed above. As the
21 defendant explained in his Motion To Suppress, the following places/items were searched by
22 the government during its asserted execution of the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order: (1)
23 private residences and other private areas, (2) the aircard, and (3) the host laptop computer

In its order at Dkt. #1009, the Court only addressed the defendant's scope challenges

6 relating to the “location search” conducted by the FBI using the StingRay and KingFish.
7 From the nine independent searches and seizures listed above, the Court only arguably

CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 addressed ¶ No. 5 (interrogation signals) ¶ No. 7 (triangulation techniques) when rejecting
9 the defendant's scope arguments relating to the “location search”:[44]
10

The Tracking Warrant precisely identified the object to be located,
found probable cause to believe that location of the aircard would produce
evidence of the crimes identified in the warrant and the identification of
individuals involved in those crimes, and placed a time limit on the location
effort. As noted above, the warrant also specifically recognized that the aircard
may be located in a private residence.
Dkt. #1009, p. 34 (emphasis added).
However, the Court failed to address the remainder of the defendant's scope

16 challenges relating to the rest of the independent searches and seizures conceded by the
17 government. During the January 27, 2012 status conference, the Court clearly distinguished
18 the “location search” from the other independent searches and seizures applicable to the
19 defendant's scope challenges:
20
21
22
23

THE COURT: Yeah, I want you to hear this. Let's take writing data to
the air card as one example. Let's take increasing power consumption on the
laptop as a second example. And let's take locating the air card precisely in the
apartment as a third example.
It seems to me what the Government has conceded is that any one of
those three is sufficiently intrusive to constitute a Fourth Amendment search...

24
25 43. See id.
26 44. The Court also failed to address, in the context of the “location search,” the issue of
the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order not listing the host laptop computer along with the
27 aircard. Agents were aware at the time that the aircard was a PCMCIA card requiring a
laptop computer to function. This is an additional scope violation not considered by the
28 Court while it analyzed the “location search.” Furthermore, the Court did not address the
seizure of the aircard's transmitted signals, which is also an item not listed in the order.

2 Therefore, it was manifest error for the Court to apply Dalia as a means to ignore the rest of
3 the defendant's scope challenges. An application of Dalia should only apply to actions such
4 as “the act of driving the vehicle[]”[45] as was discussed on January 27, 2012.
5

Dalia clearly does not apply considering, for one thing, the government conceded to

6 the independent Fourth Amendment activity of using the StingRay and KingFish to intrude
7 into the defendant's aircard for the purpose of downloading the defendant's stored data.[46]

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 This was a search of the aircard itself for the purpose of seizing stored data within the
9 aircard. The N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order does not authorize the government to
10 search the aircard and it does not list the aircard's stored data as an item to be seized.
11 Another example, the government conceded to using the defendant's electricity[47] and to
12 denying the defendant access to the Internet.[48] This was a seizure of electricity and a
13 seizure of aircard Internet access service. The N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order does not
14 authorize the government to seize the defendant's electricity and aircard Internet access
15 service. The same reasoning applies to seizing location finding response signals transmitted
16 by the aircard, geolocation information, the host laptop computer, etc. See Dkt. #824, p.
17 302-345.
18

Additionally, there was no probable cause findings[49] to support what the government

19 has already conceded were independent Fourth Amendment searches and seizures. The
20 probable cause finding in the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order only applied to the use and
21 monitoring of a mobile tracking device—the order did not state that there was probable cause
22 to search and seize anything at all. See Dkt. #1009, p. 23-24.

Even if the N.D.Cal. 09-90330MISC-RS order authorized use of a
cell site emulator with the phrase “mobile tracking device,” it was
manifest error for the Court to not suppress evidence obtained
using the second, handheld “mobile tracking device” within the
Domicilio apartment complex.

The defendant has shown, without contradiction from the government, that the FBI

5 technical agents used two separate cell site emulators (i.e., devices the Court and government
6 call “mobile tracking devices”).[50] In his Motion To Suppress, Dkt. #824-1, Section V(F)
7 (1), the defendant argued that the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order did not authorize the

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 government to use the vehicle-transportable (i.e., StingRay) and man-portable (i.e.,
9 KingFish) cell cite emulators to locate the aircard. The Court disagreed. See Dkt. #1009.
10 However, even if the phrase “use and monitor a mobile tracking device” applied to cell site
11 emulators, the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order only authorized use of one “mobile
12 tracking device,” not two. Any evidence gathered by the second “mobile tracking device” is
13 beyond the scope of the order and must be suppressed. See United States v. Juichang Chen,
14 979 F.2d 714, 719 (9th Cir. 1992) (Because evidence was gathered using an unauthorized
15 third camera, “[t]he government has agreed to suppress all of the fruits of camera 3, and,
16 under the facts of this case, this is a sufficient remedy.”). It was manifest error for the Court
17 to not suppress all evidence obtained by the second “mobile tracking device” used by the
18 FBI, i.e., the handheld cell site emulator used by agents while within the Domicilio
19 apartment complex.

The Court misunderstood the defendant's argument regarding the
operative section of the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC order failing to
command or authorize use of a mobile tracking device,
notwithstanding the probable cause finding.

The Court misconstrued the defendant's scope argument as claiming: “Judge Seeborg's

24 probable cause finding applied only to information provided by Verizon and not to locating
25 the aircard.” Dkt. #1009, p. 24. The defendant did not make this argument. The defendant
26 argued that the operative section of the order, that which commands the search, did not
27 command or authorize anyone (i.e., the government or Verizon Wireless) to use a “mobile

1 tracking device.” See Dkt. 824-1, p. 309, Section V(F)(1)(b). The N.D.Cal 08-90330MISC2 RS order suffers the same fatal flaw suffered by the warrant discussed in United States v.
3 Robinson, 358 F. Supp. 2d 975 (D.Mont. 2005). In Robinson, law enforcement relied upon a
4 warrant to search a residence while “the operative portion of the warrant, that which
5 commands the search, d[id] not include a reference to the residence...” Id. at 977. The
6 Robinson court found that a warrant is invalid if it “omits the residence from the command
7 section[]” even if the warrant contains “an explicit finding of probable cause to search the

8 residence.” Id. at 979.[51] In the present case, the operative section of the order does not
9 command or authorize use of a “mobile tracking device.” It was manifest error for the Court
10 to overlook this controlling issue.

E.

In light of the Ninth Circuit's Oliva opinion, the Court erroneously
applied Dalia to the separate issue of the government failing to
describe its surveillance technology in the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISCRS order.

First, the Court was apparently misled by the government's response to the defendant's

15 Motion To Suppress which incorrectly asserted that “defendant argues that the execution
16 exceeded the scope because the warrant did not specifically authorize the FBI to use a cell
17 site simulator...”[52] Using its straw man, the government argued that Dalia allows the
18 government to omit crucial details in orders when using new technology to conduct Fourth
19 Amendment searches and seizures.[53] In reply to the government's Dalia argument, the
20 defendant pointed out to the Court that he did not argue at Dkt. #824-1 that the government's
21 failure to explain the technology was a Fourth Amendment violation.[54] In fact, in the
22 hundreds of pages identifying and classifying the numerous independent Fourth Amendment

24

51.
The Robinson Court rejected the government's “cut and paste” error argument and
25 found that “[t]he Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement has no exception for a mistake in
cutting and pasting, nor does it authorize a reviewing court to divine what seems obvious but
26 is clearly outside the scope of the application and warrant authorizing the search.” Id. at 976.

1 searches and seizures that were conceded by the government,[55] the defendant did not once
2 attempt to distinguish Dalia on the grounds that the StingRay/KingFish technology was not
3 explained.[56] As the defendant already explained, Dalia is entirely irrelevant to how the
4 parties agreed the suppression issues would be decided. See Section II(B), supra. However,
5 in dealing with the government's application of Dalia at Dkt. #900, the defendant asserted
6 that it is still a Fourth Amendment violation when the government fails to explain new
7 surveillance technology. The defendant argued that new surveillance technology should be

8 explained so that issuing magistrates will have the “opportunity to understand all the
9 resulting necessary Fourth Amendment implications prior to deciding whether to issue the
10 order as drafted by the government.”[57] The defendant presented this argument for the first
11 time in his reply considering the government raised the issue for the fist time in its response.
12 Thereafter, the ACLU and EFF filed an Amici brief in large part supporting the defendant's
13 counter to the government's attempt to apply Dalia. Apparently, this series of events caused
14 the Court to experience confusion over what was discussed at the January 27, 2012 status
15 conference. See Section II(B), supra. Determining the Court's confusion before it was even
16 revealed, the defendant went to great efforts during the March 28, 2013 motions hearing to
17 explain the independent Fourth Amendment searches/seizures while stressing that “[t]his
18 issue is completely separate from the [] order not explaining the technology at issue, which
19 is a separate Fourth Amendment violation altogether.”[58]
20

In light of this motion for reconsideration, the defendant hopes that the Court will now

21 honor what was discussed and agreed upon on January 27, 2012. However, if the Court still
22 insists on dishonoring the concessions established at the January 27, 2012 status conference,
23 it is still manifest error for the Court to ignore the controlling Ninth Circuit case law
24 55. See Dkt. #824-1.
25 56. In a separate section, the defendant argued that the government cannot claim good
faith for scope violations considering it did not put forth effort to describe the technology to
26 the issuing magistrate, which would have allowed him to decide whether additional
independent searches and seizures required authorization in the order. See Dkt. #824-1, p.
27 354-355.

We agree that if the government seeks authorization for the use of new

It was manifest error for the Court to consider the N.D.Cal. 0890330MISC-RS order application and affidavit while it was not
incorporated by reference or present during use of the StingRay

The Court concludes, however, that “mobile tracking device” is a reasonable
description of the mobile device used by the government to track the aircard.
The Tracking Warrant authorized “the use and monitoring of a mobile tracking
device for the Target Broadband Access Card/Cellular Telephone,” while “the
agents are stationed in a public location and the Target Broadband Access
Card/Cellular Telephone is . . . inside private residences, garages, and/or other
locations not open to the public or visual surveillance[.]” Id. at 28-29. The

1 Despite the above, the Court relied upon United States v. Smith, 424 F.3d 992 (9th Cir. 1992)
2 to find in its order that “Defendant apparently 'confuses the well-settled principle that a
3 warrant's overbreadth can be cured by an accompanying affidavit that more particularly
4 describes the items to be seized with the contention... that an affidavit incorporated by
5 reference must always be attached for the search warrant to be valid – even if the warrant is
6 not overbroad without the attachment.'” Dkt. #1009, p. 33 (citation omitted). It is the Court
7 who is confused, not the defendant. The Ninth Circuit made clear in Smith that “failure to

9 affidavit was facially valid standing alone.” Id. at 1007-1008. Clearly, if the N.D.Cal. 0810 90330MISC-RS order “was facially valid standing alone,” the Court would have had no need
11 to rely upon the underlying application and affidavit as it did in its order.[60] It was manifest
12 error for the Court to consider the unincorporated/unaccompanied underlying application and

The Court made numerous manifest errors of law relating to the
government's digital data search.
1. It was manifest error for the Court to overlook the defendant's
temporal scope argument relating to digital data.

The N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT and 08-70502-PVT warrants used by the

19 government to search and seize digital data from the seized computer system state that the
20 government may only expose and search for files “[f]or the period January 1, 2005, through
21 the present[.]”[61] In a prior filing[62] and during oral arguments, the defendant pointed out
22 that 70.88% of the files on the seized “T” drive were dated prior to that time period.[63]
23 60. While the Court cited the underlying documents after a heading labeled “Probable
Cause,” the defendant never challenged the underlying probable cause statement and the
24 quoted section of the Court's order was clearly a scope analysis acting as the foundation for
all other findings relating to scope and particularity.
25
61. E.g., Submission Of Documents Related To Original Northern District Of California

27 62. The defendant had to submit his own technical declarations considering the Court
denied the defendant's motion for appointment of an expert.
28
63. See March 28, 2013 Motion Hearing Transcript, p. 15-16 (“The warrant also

1 Evidence of this fact is on the record at Dkt. #962-1. In other words, the number of files on
2 the “T” drive dated prior to January 1, 2005 is a whopping 37,941 out of 53,521 files.[64]
3 With that in mind, the Court found that “the government [] conduct[ed] a thorough, file-by4 file review of the items seized pursuant to the search warrant.” Dkt. #1009, p. 41 (emphasis
5 added). Additionally, the defendant proved that government personnel opened and read
6 using “human eyes” and/or software 53,342 files out of a total of 53,521 files (99.66% of all
7 files) on the defendant's “T” drive (i.e., “filesalot.dcv”),[65] which is the drive containing the

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 bulk of the seized evidence in this case. Therefore, the government illegally viewed the
9 37,941 files on the “T” drive that were beyond the temporal scope of the warrant.
10

The defendant also proved that the software used by IRS-CI Agent Daun during her

11 forensic examination had features allowing for compliance with temporal scope limits
12 contained in warrants.[66] Therefore, “right off the bat, the government could have very
13 easily only exposed [the] 29.12 percent of files [on the 'T' drive] which would have been
14 after January 1st, 2005, as opposed to exposing 99.66 percent of the files.”[67] This
15 argument also applies to all other drives considering, as the Court noted, the government
16 conducted a thorough, file-by-file review of all seized drives. By viewing all files, e.g., even
17 those files too old to be covered by the warrant, the government conducted an impermissible
18 general search. In denying one of the defendant's arguments, the Court noted that “the SCA
19 Order that authorized disclosure of the IP addresses was limited as to time, seeking only
20 those addresses accessed by the aircard between March 1 and July 9, 2008.” Dkt. #1009, p.
21 20. What a double standard. It was manifest error for the Court to not consider the temporal

prohibited the government from seizing any file from a period prior to January 1st, 2005.
Between 62.65 percent and 73.97 percent of all files on any given seized drive were dated
prior to that time period. And I explained this in my technical declarations on the record at
962-1, 963-1, 964-1, and 965-1. For the T drive specifically, which is a drive the
government seized the bulk of the evidence, 70.88 percent of all files were beyond just the
temporal scope of the warrant.”). Note: the defendant made these arguments as soon as his
technical analysis was complete. Again, the Court refused appointment of an expert.

2. It was manifest error for the Court to overlook the core of the
defendant's minimization argument relating to digital data.
The N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT and 08-70502-PVT warrants expressly required

6 that government agents employ means designed to “locate and expose only those categories
7 of files, documents, or other electronically stored information that are identified with

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:

CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 particularity in the warrant...”[68] The Court found as follows regarding the government's
9 failure to comply with the express minimization requirements:
10

16

Defendant argues in a supplemental filing that Agent Daun violated the
protocol’s requirement that she minimize the examination of out-of-scope
materials while searching the copies of Defendant’s computer and storage
devices because she looked at files herself rather than conducting a key-word
search for relevant files. Doc. 934-1 at 13-14. The Court is not persuaded that
Agent Daun’s method of viewing the files constitutes a violation of the
protocol. Even the best key-word searches miss relevant information, and the
Court cannot fault the government for conducting a thorough, file-by-file
review of the items seized pursuant to the search warrant. See United States v.
Giberson, 527 F.3d 882, 889 (9th Cir. 2008) (rejecting argument that
government was required to rely on folder names or other limited means of
searching computer files, noting that such searches may miss critical evidence
hidden as part of criminal activity).

18 However, the defendant provided “keyword searches” as one of many options the
19 government could have pursued in order to comply with the warrants' minimization terms.

21 The defendant's argument was clear:

25
26
27

[T]the defendant need not posit any effective alternative search method
considering file-by-file, “human eye” review is the epitome of doing absolutely
nothing in terms of limiting agent exposure to out-of-scope data.” Although
no specific guidelines were provided, the relevant warrants required that the
government do something and by doing nothing the government clearly
violated the warrants' minimization terms.

In any event, the Court erred when it relied upon United States v. Giberson, 527 F.3d

2 882, 889 (9th Cir. 2008) to reject the defendant's argument. The search warrant in Giberson,
3 as well as the search warrants addressed in all other Ninth Circuit cases, do not contain the
4 express minimization terms incorporated into the warrants in the present case. Furthermore,
5 the Ninth Circuit previously made clear that “it is important to preserve the option of
6 imposing [][search] conditions when they are deemed warranted by judicial officers
7 authorizing the search of computers.” United States v. Payton, 573 F.3d 859, 864 (9th Cir.

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 2008). The purpose of these conditions, like the conditions relevant here, are “to protect
9 privacy and other important constitutional interests.” Id. By doing absolutely nothing to
10 comply with the minimization terms incorporated into the warrants by the issuing
11 magistrates, the government exceeded the scope of the warrants. The government failed to
12 even comply with the temporal scope limits and needlessly exposed 37,941 out-of-scope files
13 on just one hard drive. See Section II(F)(1), supra. This minimization violation alone shows
14 a fishing expedition.
15

With concerns of how computer searches are conducted in the Northern District of

16 California, the Court's own reasoning dictates following District Judge Ronald M. Whyte,
17 with his finding that using software and word searches is a good way to comply with the
18 minimization requirements contained in the “Computer Search Protocol For The Northern
19 District Of California”:
20
21
22
23
24
25

“By using software and word searches, the government avoided looking at
documents that were likely to be outside the scope of the warrants.” With this
method, “only those documents that had a likelihood of being within the scope
of the warrant were examined by human eyes. Thus, potential Fourth
Amendment concerns were minimized.”
United States v. Fu-Tain Lu, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144395, CR-09-00341
RMW (N.D.Cal., Sept. 16, 2010).
It was manifest error for the Court to overlook the government's failure to do anything

26 at all to comply with the minimization terms contained in the N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT
27 and 08-70502-PVT warrants.

[T]he government did not deliberately violate the protocol. It sought the
advice of the Northern District of California concerning interpretation of the
protocol, and the interpretation was not clearly unreasonable. CF. United
States v. Koch, 625 F.3d 470, 478 (8th Cir. 2010).

10 Court ignored binding Ninth Circuit precedent:

16

We reject the conclusion of the district court that the officers are insulated by
qualified immunity because of their reliance on the approval given by an
attorney and the magistrate who signed the warrant.... [T]he fact that a warrant
was reviewed by two Assistant United States Attorneys and signed by a
magistrate does not amount to 'exceptional circumstances' on the basis of
which a reasonable officer could rely... The officers applying for the warrants
in this case did not ask for, nor did they receive any such specific assurances
from the magistrate issuing the warrant.
Marks v. Clarke, 102 F.3d 1012, 1028 (9th Cir. 1996).

17 In light of Marks, it was manifest error for the Court to find that the government acted in
18 good faith based on its own self-serving assurances – if those assurances even occurred.
19 Additionally, the warrants at issue expressly state that “[t]he government must promptly
20 notify the judge who authorized issuance of the search warrant (or, if that judge is
21 unavailable, to the general duty judge) if a dispute arises about rights or interests in any
22 seized or searched item...”[69]

The government erred in not seeking an extension of the warrant to permit

the evidence on the laptop and storage devices would have been found under
the Amended Warrant.

[T] he Supreme Court has held that violation of a magistrate judge’s directives
in executing a search warrant does not necessarily require suppression. In
Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385 (1997), the magistrate who executed the
search warrant specifically deleted the portion of the warrant that authorized
officers to make a no-knock entry. When the search warrant was executed,
however, officers concluded that the defendant was about to dispose of drugs
and made a no-knock entry. The defendant argued before the Supreme Court
that this action directly violated the magistrate’s warrant and required
suppression. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the officers’ actions
were reasonable in light of the circumstances they encountered when they
arrived at the scene. Id. at 396-97.

14 Additionally, the Court misunderstands exigent circumstances as discussed in Richards.
15 First, if analyzed in the context of a Hudson no-knock style technical violation, the search
16 was unreasonable, the seized data would not have come to light but-for the 30-day search
17 window violations, no attenuation can be realized, and suppression is merited. The
18 government had two options under the warrants after expiration of the 30-day deadlines: (1)
19 stop searching for data, or (2) obtain an extension of time to continue the search. Because
20 the challenged violations involve the government's failure to stop searching after 30 days,
21 determining but-for causality is done by examining the search as if the government had, in
22 fact, stopped searching. Under this examination, no evidence would have been obtained by
23 the government after the first 30 days and, as a result, the necessary but-for causality is
24 satisfied. The government's failure to obtain an extension of time is a separate violation that
25 occurred after the government violated the terms to stop searching after 30-days. It was
26 manifest error for the Court to skip over the challenged violation and venture into
27 hypothetical land—especially when the government had absolutely no plans to obtain an

70.

Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 592 (2006)

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 34 of 48

1 extension of time and never informed the issuing magistrates that agents violated the terms
2 of the warrants.
3

Having established but-for causality under Hudson for the 30-day search window

4 violations, attenuation is determined[71] by examining the two factors discussed in Hudson:
5 (1) evidence relation to violation, and (2) suppression remedy relation to purpose.[72] Under
6 this examination, there is no attenuation of the evidence considering (1) the causal
7 connection between the evidence and violation is not too remote,[73] and (2) suppression of

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 the evidence bears a relation to the purposes of which the 30-day search windows were to
9 serve, i.e., limiting lengthy human-eye exposure to private data.[74] Therefore, suppression
10 is merited under Hudson.
11

Second, in an attempt to sidestep Hudson, the government justifies its 30-day search

12 window violations by relying on Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 395-96 (1997), a pre13 Hudson knock-and-announce violation case. In Richards, the Supreme Court said that “the
14 reasonableness of the officers' decision[] [to commit a technical violation] must be evaluated
15 as of the time [the violation occurred].” Id. The Richards decision was based on the
16 reasoning that a magistrate cannot “anticipate[] in every particular the circumstances that
17 would confront the officers when they [conduct a search].” Id. In other words, in order to
18 justify a technical violation, the government must show how exigent circumstances
19 prevented it from first seeking authorization from a magistrate. For example, in pre-Hudson
20 United States v. Granville, 222 F.3d 1214 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth Circuit suppressed
21 71. “Our cases show that but-for causality is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition
for suppression.” Hudson, 547 U.S. at 592.
22
72. “Attenuation can occur, of course, when the causal connection is remote. Attenuation
23 also occurs when, even given a direct causal connection, the interest protected by the
constitutional guarantee that has been violated would not be served by suppression of the
24 evidence obtained.” Id. at 593 (internal citation omitted).
73. Just like in Thompson, because the violations “were all executed in the course of
25 enabling the executing agents to conduct their search and seizure..., the unreasonableness
cannot be separated from the search and subsequent seizure.” United States v. Thompson,
26 667 F. Supp. 2d 758, 767 (S.D. Ohio 2009).
th
27 74. Compare United States v. Ankey, 502 F.3d 829, 836 (9 Cir. 2007) (“The Supreme
Court made it clear that, because the knock-and-announce rule protects interests that 'have
28 nothing to do with the seizure of... evidence, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable' to knockand-announce violations.” (quoting Hudson, 547 U.S. at 594)).
- 34 -

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 35 of 48

1 evidence for a knock-and-announce violation considering law enforcement's “failure to
2 comply was not justified by exigent circumstances.” Id. at 1220 (applying Richards). In the
3 present case, the government has identified no exigent circumstances justifying its 30-day
4 search window violations or its failure to request extensions of time from a magistrate over
5 the course of a 3+ year long unauthorized search period.
6

Turning back to Hudson, the government's mere unexercised option to seek an

7 extension of time does not act to attenuate the evidence from the noted violations or

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 eliminate but-for causality. For example, had the court in Hudson found that the knock-and9 announce violation was an unattenuated but-for cause of obtaining the evidence, the
10 government would have been hard pressed to claim that the evidence was admissible simply
11 because agents could have gone back to the magistrate at any time—either before or after the
12 violation—to have the no-knock authority added to the warrant's terms. In the present case,
13 one can only speculate as to whether the government would have applied for an extension of
14 time in some hypothetical parallel universe, or whether the extension would have been for an
15 additional week, an additional 3+ years, or even been granted at all. Furthermore, one can
16 only speculate as to whether the issuing magistrate would have imposed additional
17 restrictions when issuing the extension or whether the government would have complied
18 with those restrictions or engaged in additional Fourth Amendment violations. In sum, once
19 the necessary but-for causality is established, the government's mere unexercised option to
20 properly conduct a search is not an avenue to attenuation. There is absolutely no support in
21 case law for the Court's reasoning.
22

Furthermore, the government having the evidence in its possession is not a means to

23 obtain now what was illegally obtained then, or a means to show attenuation vis-a-vis the
24 original violations. For example, if unattenuated but-for causality had been found in
25 Hudson, the government would have been hard pressed to claim that the finding was
26 extraneous simply because the evidence was already in the government's possession (e.g., in
27 a government storage locker), which could then be searched and seized using a new warrant.
28 Furthermore, the warrants at issue in the present case required destruction of all out-of-scope
- 35 -

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 36 of 48

1 data after 60 days. Had the government complied with those terms, there would have been
2 no evidence to search after 60 days—let alone 3+ years. It was manifest error for the Court
3 to not suppress evidence in this context.

5. It was manifest error for the Court to find no Fourth
Amendment violation in light of IRS-CI Agent Daun waiting six
months to start here forensic examination while all other agents
searched clones of the defendant's computer.
The Court found acceptable IRS-CI Agent Daun taking six months to even begin here

Defendant argues that Agent Daun waited six months to be[g]in[] her
“forensic analysis” of relevant files, but notes that she and others were
reviewing information on copies of the computer and storage devices during
this six-month period. Doc. 934-1 at 5–6. In Metter, by contrast, the
government conducted no review of seized materials for a period of 15 months
after the search warrant was executed.
Dkt. #1009, p. 46, fn. No. 11.

18

Nor can the Court conclude that the government unreasonably delayed its
search of the device copies. Searches were started immediately, and extended
over the ensuing months given the volume of the information to be reviewed.
See United States v. Metter, 860 F.Supp.2d 205, 211-16 (E.D.N.Y. 2012)
(finding suppression the appropriate remedy where the government retained
copies of seized computer hard drives for more than 15 months without any
review to determine whether the imaged electronic documents fell within scope
of search warrants).

20 First, unlike the warrants at issue in the present case, the warrant in Metter contained no
21 express time limits designed to limit exposure to out-of-scope data. The Ninth Circuit
22 follows the reasoning that “judges issuing warrants may place conditions on the manner and
23 extent of such searches, to protect privacy and other important constitutional interests.”
24 Payton, 573 F.3d at 864. Second, it was further manifest error for the Court to disregard the
25 six month delay in isolating in-scope data from out-of-scope data merely because “[s]earches
26 were started immediately[.]” Dkt. #1009, p. 45. The immediate searches noted by the Court
27 were conducted in further violation of the warrants terms and the defendant's Fourth
28 Amendment rights. During the six month period of which IRS-CI Agent Daun failed to even

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 37 of 48

1 begin her forensic analysis, three additional untrained case agents were accessing their own
2 personal clones of the defendant's entire computer system with no mechanism in place to
3 shield them from out-of-scope data. Therefore, the six month delay in the present case was
4 far more intrusive than the stagnant fifteen month delay found unconstitutional in Metter.
5 Third, it was further manifest error for the Court to justify the delay “given the volume of the
6 information to be reviewed.” Dkt. #1009, p. 45. IRS-CI Agent Daun candidly admitted that
7 she could have been finished with the entire forensic examination in roughly 60 days, i.e.,

8 “by late March or early April [of 2009].”[75][76] Note: IRS-CI Agent Daun began her
9 forensic examination on February 2, 2009. Furthermore, the defendant explained during oral
10 arguments that the forensic software IRS-CI Agent Daun had available “let's you run in a
11 single automated session a collection of powerful analytic tools. Since you can run the
12 evidence processor unattended, you can work on other aspects of the case while this tool is
13 processing data.”[77] Under the circumstances of this case, it was manifest error for the
14 Court to find that it was reasonable for the government to take six month to even “begin
15 review of [][seized] data to determine whether any irrelevant, personal information was
16 improperly seized.”[78]—while numerous agents arbitrarily accessed clones of the
17 defendant's entire computer without any mechanism in place to shield their eyes from out-of18 scope data.

Defendant rented the apartment using the name of a deceased individual,

apartment, and connected to the Internet with the aircard purchased with a false

Dkt. #1009, p. 9-10.
The Court made a series of manifest factual errors. See Section I, supra. Had the

15 Court paid proper attention to the evidence and uncontested facts, the paragraph above would
16 read as follows:

Defendant rented the apartment using the name of a deceased individual,
provided a forged California driver’s license to support the false identity, used
the driver’s license number from another person in support of the forged
license, and provided a forged tax return to support his purported ability to pay
rent. Defendant used the laptop he had procured using his own money
through fraud in the apartment, and connected to the Internet with the aircard
purchased with his own physical cash and while presenting no name at all a
false identity while using the account with Verizon that he maintained using a
false identity. Even the electricity that lighted the apartment and powered the
computer and aircard was purchased in a false name under the same name as
was used to rent the apartment. What is more, while living in the apartment
under false pretenses, Defendant had $70,000 in cash, a false passport, and a
copy of his laptop computer in a storage unit (also rented under false pretenses)
ready for a quick escape.

25 The Court's attempt to multiply the purported “fraud”—which is really just simple “false
26 pretenses” as the Court candidly admits—will not pass. The Court bolstering a finding of
27 colloquial “fraud” via a fallacious presentation of the facts is manifest error. Evidence in
28 support of the actual, uncontested facts—as used to edit the Court's paragraph above—is

2. It was manifest error to find that the defendant was not
“legitimately on the premises” under Rakas and Jones.
As noted above, the Court is relying upon what it describes as “false pretenses” to

10 support its finding that the defendant had committed some sort of “fraud” and, therefore, was
11 not “legitimately on the premises” while in his home residence and, therefore, had no
12 reasonable expectation of privacy. A false representation, or “false pretense” as the Court
13 puts it, is only one element of a fraud claim. “Under California law, the indispensable
14 elements of a fraud claim include a false representation, knowledge of its falsity, intent to
15 defraud, justifiable reliance, and damages.” Fanucchi & Limi Farms v. United Agri Prods,
16 414 F.3d 1075, 1088 (9th Cir. 2005). It is clear from the record that the defendant had no
17 intent to defraud Domicilio, Verizon, or Lenovo and no party can claim any type of damages.
18 There is a gaping hole in the Court's “fraud” theory. The defendant did not have a “wrongful
19 presence” in his home and he was certainly “legitimately on the premises” for each month he
20 paid his rent using his own money. At most, there was breach of contract with no damages—
21 but not “fraud”—which is addressed further in Section II(E)(5), infra.
22

However, if by “fraud” the Court means that some type of alleged criminal activity

23 destroyed the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy in his home, this theory also
24 fails. See, e.g., United States v. Pollock, 726 F.2d 1456, 1465 (9th Cir. 1984) (defendant who
25 moved a laboratory to his friend's house to avoid detection and who used that site to
26 manufacture drugs had a legitimate expectation of privacy).[79] The Court did note its
27

79. See also United States v. Skinner, ___ F.3d ___, No. 09-649, p. 7, fn. 1 (6th Cir., Aug.
28 14, 2012) (“We do not mean to suggest that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy

1 personal opinion that the defendant “[h]aving utterly disregarded the privacy rights of Travis
2 Rupard, Steven Brawner, and Andrew Johnson, not to mention the many other names used in
3 his scheme, Defendant cannot now credibly argue that he had a legitimate expectation of
4 privacy in the devices and apartment he acquired through the fraudulent use of their
5 identities.” Dkt. #1009, p. 13. It was entirely inappropriate for the Court to take into
6 account his personal opinions regarding the criminal provisions the government asserts were
7 violated. See United States v. Williams, 124 F.3d 411, 417 (3rd Cir. 1997) (“[I]n reviewing

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:

8 the issuance of a search warrant,... it does not follow that a judicial officer, in weighing the
9 public interest, may properly take into account his or her personal opinions regarding the
10 need for or the importance of the criminal provisions that appear to have been violated.”
11 (citations omitted)).
12
13
14

3. Even if the defendant was not “legitimately on the premises,” it
was manifest error for the Court to apply the Jones test as the
sole test to determine reasonable expectation of privacy.
The Court stated that the Ninth Circuit in Cunag relied upon Rakas v. Illinois, 439

15 U.S. 128 (1978) to find that “when an individual is not legitimately on the premises, he does
16 not enjoy the protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment.” Dkt. #1009, p. 11 (citing
17 United States v. Cunag, 386 F.3d 888, 893 (9th Cir. 2004)). The Court went on to
18 acknowledge the Ninth Circuit's second finding in Cunag, which was based on Bautista,[80]
19 i.e., “one who procures a hotel room by fraud does have a reasonable expectation of privacy
20 so long as the hotel has not taken affirmative steps to evict him.” Dkt. #1009, p. 11 (citing
21 Cunag, 386 F.3d at 895). However, the Court then found that “the Ninth Circuit had already
22 concluded, under Supreme Court precedent, that Cunag was not lawfully in the room and
23 therefore had no legitimate expectation of privacy, [therefore] the Court regards th[e Bautista
24 reasoning] [] of Cunag as dicta.” Dkt. #1009, p. 11. As explained below, the Court has it
25 illegally possessed.”); United States v. Barajas-Avalos, 359 F.3d 1204, 1214 (9th Cir. 2004)
(Interpreting Sandoval to hold that “a search of the interior of a makeshift tent violated the
26 appellant's reasonable expectation of privacy even though he was camped illegally...” (citing
Sandoval, 200 F.3d at 661)); United States v. Davis, 849 F.2d 414, 415 (9th Cir. 1988) (“We
27 also reject the government's assertion that there is a contraband exception to the fourth
amendment.”).

1 backwards. The actual dicta in Cunag is the quote from Rakas and the controlling law is the
2 reasoning based on Bautista.
3

In the present case, the Court conducted a “legitimately on premises” test as the sole

4 test when finding that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his home.
5 See Dkt. #1009, p. 9. In conducting this sole test, the Court found that the defendant's
6 “presence in the apartment was wrongful” and stopped there. Id. This is where the Court
7 made its mistake. The Supreme Court in Rakas did away with solely using the “legitimately

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 on premises” test as established in Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960). The Rakas
9 Court made clear that “the phrase 'legitimately on premises' coined in Jones creates too
10 broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth Amendment rights.” Rakas, 439 U.S. at 142. As
11 further explained in Rakas, while “wrongful presence” can still be considered, it is not to be
12 held as controlling:
13
14

We would not wish to be understood as saying that legitimate presence on the
premises is irrelevant to one's expectation of privacy, but it cannot be deemed
controlling.

15

Rakas, 439 U.S. at 148 (emphasis added).

16 Because the “legitimately on premises” test was held to not be controlling in Rakas, the
17 actual dicta in Cunag was the statement that Cunag had no privacy interests simply because
18 he was not “legitimately on the premises.” The Cunag court understood the impropriety of
19 this dicta and went on to analyze whether steps had been taken to evict Cunag from his room.
20 It was manifest error for this Court to not also take these steps in the present case.
21

The Court's manifest error becomes even more evident in light of United States v.

22 Young, 573 F.3d 711 (9th Cir. 2009). In Young, the Ninth Circuit agreed that “Young
23 maintained a reasonable (although fraudulent) expectation of privacy in his hotel room and
24 the luggage he left in the hotel room, because hotel staff had not evicted him from the
25 room.” Id. at 717 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit decided Young at least five years
26 after Cunag and still applied what this Court regarded as “dicta.”

4. When finding that the defendant was not “legitimately on the
premises,” it was manifest error for the Court to consider facts
unknown to the agents as of the time of the search.
Even if this Court were to continue to ignore controlling Ninth Circuit precedent and

4 find that the defendant fails the “legitimately on premises” test as the sole test, the defendant
5 still had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his apartment. First, the Supreme Court made
6 clear that “[t]he reasonableness of an official invasion of the citizen's privacy must be
7 apprised on the basis of the facts as they existed at the time that invasion occurred.”

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:

CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 115 (1984) (emphasis added). In the context of
9 using the StingRay and KingFish, the Court found that the “place [i.e., real property] to be
10 searched could not be specified because it was unknown...” Dkt. #1009, p. 29. Therefore,
11 all the so-called “fraud” relied upon by the Court to find that the defendant was not
12 “legitimately on the premises” cannot be considered. At the time the invasion occurred,
13 Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 115, the government had no information regarding the defendant
14 renting his apartment and paying his electricity under the name of Steven Brawner. Just as
15 the Ninth Circuit found in Young, this defendant still had a reasonable expectation of privacy
16 even if there was “fraud” and even if the defendant was not “legitimately on the premises”
17 considering those facts came to light after the government invasion:
18

21

Cunag involved a defendant who had been conclusively evicted from his hotel
room after hotel management confirmed that the room had been procured
through credit card fraud. The lockout was done with the clear intention of
permanently removing Cunag from the room, as demonstrated by the
simultaneous filing of the crime report with the police. Here, hotel
management was unaware of the possibility that Young had procured the
room through fraud.

22

5. The Court's manifest error in finding that the the defendant
was not “legitimately on premises” based on breach of contract
has the potential to bread tyrannical government misconduct.
If applied liberally by government investigators and prosecutors, the tyranny that

26 could potentially result from the Court's ruling addressing the defendant's reasonable
27 expectation of privacy is saddening. In an attempt to distinguish controlling Ninth Circuit
28 case law, the Court partially relied upon United States v. Johnson, 584 F.3d 995 (10th Cir.
- 42 -

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 43 of 48

1 2009), as well as similar out-of-circuit cases. See Dkt. #1009, p. 12. In Johnson, the Tenth
2 Circuit found that a defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a storage unit
3 because the renter violated the rental agreement by entering into the contract using a false
4 name. See id. The Tenth Circuit applied Utah contract law and found that the agreement
5 “was a contract voidable at the storage unit owner's option. At all times, then, [][the renter's]
6 contractual right to the storage unit was in jeopardy of recession.” Id. at 1004. Based on this
7 breach of contract, the Johnson court found there was no reasonable expectation of privacy

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 in the storage unit. See Id. Just like Domicilio of whom the defendant rented his home, the
9 storage facility in Johnson was not defrauded of anything of value, which is a required
10 element of “fraud.”[81] Therefore, the “fraud” theory upon which this Court basis its
11 decision is more appropriately categorized as “breach of contract.” At most, the defendant
12 breached the leasing contract he had with the Domicilio apartment complex by using a false
13 name.[82] It was this breach of contract that the Court based its finding that the defendant's
14 “presence in the apartment was wrongful[.]” Dkt. #1009, p. 9. As explained below, finding
15 that a person had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a rented home simply because there
16 was a violation of the lease will only further tyrannical government misconduct.
17

The Johnson court's theory of contract law controlling one's reasonable expectation of

18 privacy has repeatedly been rejected by the Supreme Court in the context of home
19 residences. “In defining the scope of that interest, we adhere to the view expressed in Jones
20 and echoed in later cases that arcane distinctions developed in property and tort law between
21 guests, licensees, invitees, and the like, ought not to control.” Rakas, 439 U.S. at 143 (listing
22 cases). This is sound legal reasoning. Otherwise, law enforcement could justify an illegal
23 search and seizure, after the fact, by pointing to any violation of a leasing contract to
24 establish that a defendant's “presence... was wrongful” while inside his home. Dkt. #1009, p.
25 9. For example, a prosecutor can now show a lack of privacy expectations because of
26 81. The words “to defraud” usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick,
deceit, chicane, or overreaching. See McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 358 (1987).
27
82. The pro se, incarcerated defendant does not have access to California contract law
28 resources. Therefore, the defendant does not concede that entering into a contract using an
alias is breach of contract in California.

1 Sparky, the household pet goldfish. “After all, your Honor, the defendant's presence in the
2 leased apartment was wrongful considering the leasing contract clearly forbids fishtanks of
3 any kind.” As another example, federal agents could measure a resident's hedges to see if
4 they comply with height requirements established by the Home Owner's Association. “Your
5 Honor, the defendant was wrongfully on the premises. His hedges had not been cut for what
6 we estimate to be six months. Because this 'fraud' upon his neighbors was a clear violation
7 of the home owner's agreement, there was no reasonable expectation of privacy.” The Court

8 may dismiss the defendant's concerns as puffery. But, “[t]he difference between puffery and
9 prosecution may depend on whether you happen to be someone an AUSA has reason to go
10 after.” United States v. Nosal, 676 F.3d 854, 862 (9th Cir. 2012). “[W]e shouldn't have to
11 live at the mercy of our local prosecutor.... By giving that much power to prosecutors, we're
12 inviting discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement.” Id.
13
14

6. Even if the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy
in his home residence, he still had a possessory and property
interest in his aircard and computer.

15

In its order, the Court found the following:

16

Citing Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022 (9th Cit. 2012),
Defendant asserted at oral argument that he need not show a reasonable
expectation of privacy to make out a Fourth Amendment violation because the
Fourth Amendment also protects property interests, and he had a property
interest in his apartment, laptop, and aircard. Lavan did not concern a search,
but instead concerned the City’s seizure and destruction of personal property
belonging to homeless people that was left on City sidewalks. In addition, for
the reasons discussed above, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant had a
legitimate Fourth Amendment property interest in the apartment, laptop, or
aircard procured through fraud.

17
18
19
20
21
22
23

Dkt. #1009, p. 14 fn. No. 3.
First, the defendant made the same seizure arguments at Dkt. #824-1. The defendant

24 identified conceded Fourth Amendment seizures conducted by the government under United
25 States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984) and under Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56,
26 61 (1992). The defendant also identified conceded Fourth Amendment searches that
27 involved trespassing to obtain information under United States v. Jones, 556 U.S. ___, 181 L.
28 Ed. 2D 911 (2012), which do not require a reasonable expectation of privacy.
- 44 -

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1033 Filed 05/23/13 Page 45 of 48

Second, the Court erred by only analyzing property interests and not possessory

2 interests. The Supreme Court made clear in Jacobsen that “A 'seizure' of property occurs
3 when there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that
4 property.” Id. at 113 (emphasis added). The government already conceded that the
5 defendant had possessory interests. See Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To
6 Suppress (Dkt. #873, p. 60) (The government agreed that the defendant “personally
7 possessed, obtained, or maintained the items.”). Therefore, the defendant has the requisite

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PORTIONS OF COURT'S ORDER AT Dkt. #1009 RE:
FOURTH AMENDMENT SUPPRESSION ISSUES
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 “standing” to challenged the conceded Fourth Amendment searches and seizures classified
9 under Jacobsen, Soldal, and Jones.
10

Third, the defendant had legitimate ownership of his aircard and laptop computer. As

11 noted in Section I, supra, ¶ No. 4, the defendant purchased his aircard using his own
12 physical cash while providing no name at all and the laptop was also purchased with the
13 defendant's own money. The government does not contest these facts. Additionally, the
14 aircard and laptop were not connected to Verizon Wireless while the FBI was operating the
15 StingRay and KingFish. Therefore, the Travis Rupard Verizon Wireless account holds no
16 relevancy to any property, possessory, or privacy interests. As for legitimate property
17 interests, if the defendant did not own the aircard and laptop then who did? Furthermore,
18 even if those items were owned by someone else, they were in the defendant's possession
19 and this “raise[s] the questions at issue in cases where a guest is still using a room that he
20 obtained by fraudulent use of a credit card.” Caymen, 404 F.3d at 1199 (footnote omitted)
21 (citing United States v. Cunag, 386 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Bautista, 362
22 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2004)). It was manifest error for the Court to ignore these points.

It was manifest error for the Court to completely ignore the
defendant's arguments relating to the N.D.Cal. 08-90331MISC-RS
Pen/Trap oder used to force the aircard to generate real-time cell
site information.

At Dkt. #824-1, the defendant raised numerous challenges to the N.D.Cal. 08-

27 90331MISC-RS oder used to justify use of the SF-Martinez DCS-3000 Pen/Trap device. It
28 was manifest error for the Court to ignore every single one of those arguments.

4 government's destruction of evidence relating to all data obtained from Verizon Wireless
5 under the purported execution of the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order. The memorandum
