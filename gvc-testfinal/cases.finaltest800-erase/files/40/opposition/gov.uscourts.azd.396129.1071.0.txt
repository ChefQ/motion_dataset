vs.

CR-08-0814-PHX-DGC
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION

Daniel David Rigmaiden,
Defendant.

18
19

The United States, through undersigned counsel, opposes Defendant’s motion for

20

reconsideration under Local Rule 7.2(g). “Motions for reconsideration ‘are disfavored

21

and will be granted only upon a showing of manifest error or new facts or legal authority

22

which could not have been raised earlier with reasonable diligence.’ Mere disagreement

23

with an order is an insufficient basis for reconsideration. Nor should a motion for

24

reconsideration be used to ask the Court to rethink its analysis.” Ariz. Dream Act

25

Coalition v. Brewer, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2013 WL 2128315 at *25 (D. Ariz. May 16,

26

2013).

27

As argued below, Defendant fails to show any manifest error or new facts or law

28

that would affect the Court’s May 8, 2013, Order denying his motion to suppress.

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 2 of 11

1

Accordingly, his motion for reconsideration should be denied.

2

I.

3

Defendant’s Alleged Manifest Factual Errors.
1.

Use Of False Identities. Defendant fails to identify any errors that would

4

affect the reasoning in the Court’s May 8, 2013, Order. Defendant used numerous false

5

identities, and the driver’s license numbers he provided were assigned to real people.

6

Furthermore, evidence provided in discovery shows that Defendant operated a website

7

(www.fakeid.tv) where he sold fake California driver’s licenses. See also CR 845-1

8

(search warrant affidavit for apartment) at 24 ¶ 27. Defendant fails to explain why it

9

matters, for purposes of deciding the motion to suppress, whether he knew the numbers

10
11

he used were already assigned to real people.
2.

Abandonment Of Apartment. Defendant again fails to identify any error.

12

The Court may draw inferences from the available evidence when considering a motion

13

to suppress. See United States v. Williams, 630 F.2d 1322, 1327 (9th Cir. 1980); see also

14

United States v. Cervantes-Gaitan, 792 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir. 1986). Defendant

15

admitted in a declaration that he used a false identity to rent the apartment, and that if he

16

had learned of law enforcement’s attempts to locate the aircard he would have cleared out

17

of the apartment within a day and stopped using the aircard. See CR 824-2 at ¶¶ 3, 14.

18

That alone amply supports the Court’s finding that Defendant was prepared to abandon

19

the apartment and flee. If more were needed, the Court could consider Defendant’s boasts

20

about additional countermeasures he had planned as well as his actual flight when law

21

enforcement attempted to arrest him, as detailed in the search warrant affidavits. See,

22

e.g., CR 845-1 (search warrant affidavit for apartment) at 46-48 ¶¶ 91, 93, 100

23

(countermeasures), 51 ¶ 108(i) (flight).

24

3.

Cash, Passport, And Backup Computer In Storage Unit. The storage unit

25

contained an external hard drive with an encrypted backup copy of contents of his laptop.

26

In addition to quibbling over whether an external hard drive is a computer, Defendant

27

continues to quibble over whether a 24-hour escape is a “quick escape,” but he fails to

28
-2-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 3 of 11

1
2

identify any factual errors that would affect the reasoning in the Court’s Order.
4.

Travis Rupard Aircard. Defendant claims that he purchased the aircard

3

without providing any name. The United States obtained no information during the

4

investigation about the actual purchase of the aircard. Nevertheless, Defendant activated

5

the aircard and maintained the aircard under the false identity Travis Rupard, which is the

6

name listed in Verizon’s subscriber records.

7

5.

Fraudulent Andrew Johnson Visa Card. Defendant is correct that the Visa

8

card was tied to a prepaid account, but the fact remains: he used a fraudulent visa card

9

obtained through the use of a deceased person’s name and social security number to

10
11

purchase the laptop. There is no error.
6.

Investigation Of Defendant’s False Identities. Defendant again identifies no

12

specific error or modification sought. To the extent it matters, the United States had

13

already attempted to peel back some of the layers of false identities (including “Travis

14

Rupard” and “Patrick Stout”) before it began the aircard tracking operation.

15
16
17

7.

Sending Signals To Aircard As “Severe Intrusion.” Defendant identifies no

specific error or modification sought.
8.

Expunction Of Data. Defendant does not dispute that the data was

18

expunged. He speculates that the FBI had improper motives in doing so, but the United

19

States has provided a declaration from an FBI supervisory agent as well as an excerpt of

20

the relevant FBI policy to show that it is, in fact, routinely done at the conclusion of a

21

tracking operation. See CR 674-1 (declaration). Defendant identifies no specific error or

22

modification sought.

23

9.

New Technology And Lack Of Legal Precedent. In the Fourth Amendment

24

context, cell phone tracking is relatively new technology and there is—and certainly was

25

in 2008—a lack of legal precedent. Defendant identifies no specific error or modification

26

sought.

27

10.

Gate Access Records. Defendant identifies no specific error or modification

28
-3-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 4 of 11

1

sought.

2
3

11.

Encrypted Data. Defendant identifies no specific error or modification

sought.

4

12.

Search Incident To Arrest. The Court’s description is correct: “After a foot

5

chase through the surrounding area, Defendant was apprehended by local police officers

6

who happened to be on the scene. Agents searched the suspect incident to his arrest and

7

found a set of keys in his pocket.” CR 1009 at 5. The local law enforcement officers were

8

acting at the express request for assistance from federal agents armed with a federal arrest

9

warrant. Federal agents were present during the arrest. It is of no consequence to the

10

motion to suppress who actually found the keys.

11

13.

Search Of Apartment. Again, the Court’s description is correct: “An agent

12

took the keys to unit 1122 and confirmed that they fit and turned the door lock. The agent

13

waited for the arrival of other agents with the search warrant before entering the

14

apartment.” CR 1009 at 5. It does not appear that the agent who took the keys to Unit

15

1122 ever entered the apartment, but he certainly did not do so before the arrival of the

16

warrant and the search team.

17

II.

18

Manifest Legal Errors.
A.

Execution Of Tracking Warrant. Defendant first argues that the Court

19

overlooked his arguments that the tracking warrant was not executed by the FBI. The

20

United States is unable to discern Defendant’s argument on this issue.

21

B.

Independent Searches And Seizures. Defendant also argues that the Court

22

overlooked the independent searches and seizures involved in the aircard tracking

23

operation and ignored all of his arguments about the scope of the Fourth Amendment

24

search and seizure. In making this argument, however, Defendant overlooks the

25

distinction between 1) analyzing at the outset whether the warrant was sufficiently

26

particular to authorize the aircard tracking operation, and 2) analyzing after the fact

27

whether the warrant was executed reasonably in light of the Fourth Amendment. The

28
-4-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 5 of 11

1

warrant must specify the aircard to be located, but, under Dalia v. United States, it need

2

not specify the precise manner in which the warrant would be executed. See 441 U.S.

3

238, 257 (1979).

4

Here, the Court concluded that the warrant was sufficiently particular, and it

5

properly relied on Dalia to reject Defendant’s argument that the warrant failed to specify

6

the various searches and seizures that might occur during its execution. See CR 1009 at

7

25-27 & n.7. The Court also concluded that the aircard tracking operation was not a

8

severe intrusion, even assuming all of Defendant’s allegations were true. See CR 1009 at

9

13; see also CR 873 (Gov’t Resp. Mot. Suppress) at 53-54 (citing cases on

10

reasonableness of execution). Thus, the Court properly considered and rejected

11

Defendant’s scope arguments.

12

C.

Use Of Two Devices. Similarly, Defendant argues that the warrant only

13

authorized the use of one device, not two. The Court already rejected this argument. CR

14

1009 at 24-25. Moreover, United States v. Chen, 979 F.2d 714 (9th Cir. 1992), which

15

Defendant cites in his motion for reconsideration, provides no support for his argument.

16

In Chen, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the use of multiple cameras for video

17

surveillance was “motivated by considerations of practicality rather than by a[n

18

improper] desire to engage in indiscriminate ‘fishing,’” and it reversed the district court’s

19

suppression of the video evidence. 979 F.2d at 718. Here, the use of two devices at

20

different times rather than a single device simply allowed the FBI to execute the warrant;

21

it did not broaden the scope of what was to be accomplished (that is, locate the aircard).

22

D.

Authorization To Use Mobile Tracking Device. Defendant further argues

23

that the warrant did not authorize anyone to use a mobile tracking device to locate his

24

aircard, citing United States v. Robinson, 358 F. Supp. 2d 975 (D. Mont. 2005). Robinson

25

is irrelevant. In Robinson, the warrant authorized the search of a pickup truck but it failed

26

to explicitly authorize the search of a related residence. See 358 F. Supp. 2d at 977 & n.2.

27

The district court suppressed evidence obtained from the residence because the warrant

28
-5-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 6 of 11

1

did not authorize the search of that location with particularity, as required by the Fourth

2

Amendment. Id. at 980-981. But see Kennith J. Melilli, What Nearly A Quarter Century

3

Of Experience Has Taught Us About Leon And “Good Faith,” 2008 Utah L. Rev. 519,

4

554-555 (2008) (criticizing Robinson). Here, however, the warrant described the aircard

5

to be tracked with particularity, including its description, telephone number, and ESN

6

number. As explained in the Court’s Order, the manner in which the warrant would be

7

executed—including the equipment that law enforcement might use—need not be

8

precisely described. See CR 1009 at 25-27.

9

E.

Dalia v. United States And New Technology. Defendant argues that Dalia

10

v. United States does not apply to searches and seizures using new technology, but

11

neither of his cases even cite Dalia. See United States v. Oliva, 705 F.3d 390, 399 (9th

12

Cir. 2012) (rejecting motion to suppress based on defendant’s allegation that wiretap

13

authorized “unlawful roving bugs”); In Re Warrant To Search A Target Computer At

14

Premises Unknown, 2013 WL 1729765 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2013) (denying warrant

15

application).

16

F.

Incorporation Of Affidavit By Reference. Defendant argues that the Court

17

improperly considered the affidavit. To the extent the Court even needs to consider the

18

affidavit, the case Defendant cites—United States v. SDI Future Health, Inc.—supports

19

the Court’s analysis. See 568 F.3d 684, 699 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that language “noting

20

‘the supporting affidavit(s)’ as the ‘grounds for application for issuance of the search

21

warrant’” is sufficient to incorporate by reference); id. at 701 n.10 (stating that “we have

22

never required actual reliance on an affidavit to meet the second prong for incorporation

23

into a warrant”).

24

G.

Computer Search Protocol. Defendant complains that law enforcement

25

agents’ review of his computer was too thorough. In particular, he complains that law

26

enforcement reviewed information outside of the date range on the warrant.

27

The warrant authorizes the seizure of evidence relating to “possible violations of

28
-6-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 7 of 11

1

the following [enumerated] statutes . . . [f]or the period January 1, 2005, through the

2

present.” See CR 845-2 (search warrant for apartment) at 4. This temporal limitation

3

applies to the violations being investigated, not the type of evidence that may be relevant.

4

For example, electronic copies of identity theft evidence, such as birth certificates or lists

5

of social security numbers, would have plainly been within the scope of the warrant, even

6

if those electronic copies were created prior to January 1, 2005. See CR 845-2 (search

7

warrant for apartment) at 6 ¶ 3 (“Records . . . containing personal identifiable information

8

on indviduals, whether living, deceased or fictictious . . . who may have been a victim of

9

identity theft”). Moreover, date stamps on computer files can sometimes be unreliable.

10

Law enforcement was under no obligation to ignore digital evidence date-stamped prior

11

to January 1, 2005.

12

Defendant also argues that the Court “ignored binding Ninth Circuit precedent” in

13

Marks v. Clarke, 102 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 1996), when it found that the United States

14

acted in good faith in its interpretation of the computer search protocol. See CR 1033 at

15

32. Marks sheds very little light on the issue before this Court, as it deals with a separate

16

issue: qualified immunity for officers who executed a facially invalid warrant. Id. at

17

1028. In Marks, police officers executed a general warrant that authorized the search of

18

all people present at two locations without probable cause. Id. at 1026. Here, in contrast,

19

the search warrant particularly described the items to be seized and there was ample

20

probable cause to believe that evidence would be found on the computers. The protocol at

21

issue did not undermine the validity of the warrant; it merely set forth procedures to

22

follow in its execution. See CR 845-2 at 14-16.

23
24
25

In addition, Defendant re-argues many of the same points he made in his prior
voluminous pleadings, which have already been considered and rejected by the Court.
H.

Reasonable Expectation Of Privacy. The United States agrees with the

26

Court’s decision that this defendant in this case lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy

27

in the apartment, laptop, and aircard. Defendant challenges the Court’s finding of facts in

28
-7-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 8 of 11

1

support of its decision. CR 1033 at 38. The United States recognizes that there is no

2

evidence in the record regarding the source or sources of funds for the purchase of the

3

aircard, the maintenance of the aircard account, the payment of rent, etc., and that a hard

4

drive and not a computer was found in defendant’s storage unit. The Court’s original

5

findings of fact read as follows:

6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14

The Court concludes that Defendant’s presence in the apartment was
wrongful in the same sense as the burglar’s discussed in Rakas. Virtually
everything about Defendant’s actions related to the apartment was
fraudulent. Defendant rented the apartment using the name of a deceased
individual, provided a forged California driver’s license to support the false
identity, used the drivers’ license number from another person in support of
the forged license, and provided a forged tax return to support his purported
ability to pay rent. Defendant used the laptop he had procured through
fraud in the apartment, and connected to the Internet with the aircard
purchased with a false identity while using the account with Verizon that he
maintained using a false identity. Even the electricity that lighted the
apartment and powered the computer and the aircard was purchased in a
false name. What is more, while living in the apartment under false
pretenses, Defendant had $70,000 in cash, a false passport, and a copy of
his laptop computer in a storage unit (also rented under false pretenses)
ready for a quick escape.

15

CR 1009 at 9-10.

16

findings with respect to this issue, see CR 1033 at 38, the United States offers the

However, since defendant has offered a proposed amended set of

The Court concludes that Defendant’s presence in the apartment was
wrongful in the same sense as the burglar’s discussed in Rakas. Virtually
everything about Defendant’s actions related to the apartment was
fraudulent. Defendant rented the apartment using the name of Steven
Brawner (False Identity #1), a deceased individual, provided a forged
California driver’s license to support the false identity, used the valid
drivers’ license number from another person (False Identity #2) in support
of the forged license, and provided a forged tax return to support his
purported ability to pay rent. Defendant used the laptop he had procured
through fraud in that he purchased it through the use of a Visa card
account obtained and maintained using the name of Andrew Johnson,
a deceased individual (False Identity #3) in the apartment, and connected
to the Internet with the aircard purchased by defendant with a false identity
while using the account with Verizon that he maintained using a false
identity of Travis Rupard, a living individual (False Identity #4). Even
the electricity that lighted the apartment and powered the computer and the
aircard was purchased in a false name, Brawner. What is more, while
living in the apartment under false pretenses, Defendant had $70,000 in
cash, a false facially valid U.S. passport Defendant had obtained using
his Andrew Johnson false identity, and a copy on a hard drive of all of

his primary fraudulent identity and fraudulent scheme programs
Defendant also maintained on his laptop computer in a storage unit (also
rented under false pretenses under the name of Daniel Clifton Aldrich, a
deceased person (False Identity #5) ready for a quick escape. By
Defendant’s own admission, had he become aware of law
enforcement’s interest in him, he would have vacated his apartment
within 24 hours. There is little doubt the contents of the storage unit
would have aided a relocation by Defendant on short notice and the
reestablishment of his criminal operations under an identity other than
Steven Brawner.

Taken as a whole, the depth and breadth of defendant’s fraudulent conduct appear to have
never been considered by a court before. In an earlier stage of the litigation in this case,
the United States did state “Defendant still had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
apartment itself, even though he rented it under an assumed identity, because the
apartment complex had not yet discovered the fraud and attempted to evict him.” See CR
465 at 22 n.3 (citing United States v. Cunag, 386 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2004)). The United
States also noted Cunag in its response to Defendant’s Motion to Suppress. See CR 873
at 57. This being said, as the United States continued to work through this issue as
presented through the voluminous and extensive factual and legal arguments brought by
Defendant, its thinking and arguments were refined in the course of further research and
consideration of the relevant facts. As a consequence at this time, the United States
believes that the Court’s decision in this case is the correct one, the singular fraudulent
conduct in Cunag pales in comparison to Defendant’s fraudulent conduct in this case.
Fraudulent conduct which in turn facilitated the ongoing violation of the privacy of many
others through the assumption of their identities in order to file fraudulent tax returns and
the secret use of innocent third parties’ personal computers via botnets and/or proxies. In
this case, under these facts, the Court’s findings with respect to defendant’s lack of any
reasonable expectation of privacy are appropriate.
I.

Objections To Pen/Trap Order, No. 08-90331. Defendant argues that the

Court ignored his arguments regarding the hybrid order, No. 08-90331, but he fails to
explain how this should affect the Court’s Order.
J.

Alleged Destruction Of Evidence. Defendant also argues that the Court
-9-

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 1071 Filed 06/21/13 Page 10 of 11

1

ignored the arguments in one of his supplemental memoranda, CR 830-2, but he does not

2

explain how this should affect the Court’s Order.

3

III.

Conclusion.

4

As argued above, Defendant fails to show any manifest error or new facts or law

5

that would affect the Court’s May 8, 2013, Order denying his motion to suppress.

6

Accordingly, his motion for reconsideration should be denied.
