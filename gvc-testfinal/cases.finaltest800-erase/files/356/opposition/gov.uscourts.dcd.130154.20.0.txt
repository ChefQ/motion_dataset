UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Lawrence Sinclair,
Case No.: 1:08-cv-00434-HHK
Plaintiff,
PLAINTIFF ’S RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR
SUBSTITUTE FILING

vs.
TubeSockTedD, mzmolly and
OWNINGLIARS,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/

Plaintiff, Lawrence Sinclair, by and through his undersigned counsel, responds to the motion
to substitute filings of Defendant mzmolly and Democraticunderground.com [D.E. #19], and states:
The motion is only a half-hearted attempt to address a significant defalcation by Mr. Levy
and leaves the social security records and other confidential information of Plaintiff on this Court’s
PACER system for the public to view. Rather than immediately agreeing to a temporary sealing to
prevent further harm, Mr. Levy simply draws attention to his error and enlarges the harm that
Plaintiff suffers. As such, until Mr. Levy certifies that he has removed all the prohibited information
from his filings, Plaintiff continues to demand the exhibits be sealed.
Second, in relation to the “Certificate of Conference” filed by Mr. Levy as part of his clients’
motion, Mr. Levy proves that he is as reckless with the facts as he is with his improper exhibit
filings. While undersigned counsel has no recollection of the putative statements attributed to him
by the public posturing Mr. Levy, his continue use of base ad hominem argument to advance his
cause deserves recognition and sanction by this Court.
