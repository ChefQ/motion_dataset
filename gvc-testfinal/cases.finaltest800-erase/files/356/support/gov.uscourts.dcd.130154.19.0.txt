No. 1:08-cv-00434-HHK

MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE FILING
Democratic Underground and defendant mzmolly move the Court to substitute the attached
documents for three of the attachments filed with their Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Discovery. The documents to be replaced, Documents 12-5 (Exhibit H to L to Styles Affidavit), 1213 (Affidavit of William Tobias Morrow), and 12-14 (Affidavit of Ronald Alexander), contain
personal identifying information. The proposed replacement filings, which are filed with this
motion, are identical except that the identifying information has been covered by labels stating
“Redacted.”
CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE
On the morning of May 5, 2008, I both telephoned and emailed Sinclair’s counsel, Mr.
Sibley, seeking his consent to this motion, without prejudice to his right to pursue the motion
previously filed early Saturday morning (DN 14) for sanctions for the filing of a document
containing personal identifying information. When I finally reached him by telephone, Mr. Sibley
stated that he had just responded to my email, then added that he would not consent to this motion
because he wants to have all of the documents filed in support of the Opposition to the Motion to
Compel Discovery sealed until I had reviewed all pages filed to ensure that they did not contain

further identifying information. I indicated that I understood that this was raised by his previous
motion, which he has the right to pursue, but asked that for now he consent to my motion to get the
documents in question replaced. Mr. Sibley responded that he was preparing to file a motion
containing indications that Sinclair’s information was being posted all over the Internet. When I
started to ask for details, he responded that I should wait to see what they were going to file; that I
should “grab the ankles” and do as he insisted to please his client; but that I could “do as you damn
please.” Before I could respond, he hung up. His email responding to my request is also attached
to this motion.

I have been trying to call you but, each time I call, after a single ring, I
get a message "all circuits are busy now."
I have contacted the ECF desk to get the pages containing personal

as soon as possible, I need to file a motion. In order to get this done as
quickly as possible, I am asking for your consent to substitute pages that
cover the personal information with the word "Redacted." This consent would
be without prejudice to your right to pursue the additional relief that you
seek in your own motion.
Please advise whether I may represent that you consent. I'll continue to
try calling, or you can call me back. I should be in the office all day,
except for an early afternoon meeting.

Interesting way to get it:

Powdered cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use. LOL. HILARITY! Go Larry! I said during the most recent
debate that I was being reminded of Blackwellian campaigning. Now I’m being reminded of Scott Pullins!

Obama deserves the respect that all human beings are entitled to and this nonsense is just going too far. God bless

ridiculous.

Thanks for stopping by Goldie. I too hope the process doesn’t become this ridiculous, but it probably will. Hotly
contested modern-day elections seem to be…and we are certainly used to it in Ohio. (see recent Governors race)

I hope more comes out about this guy. My thinking is he is a crackhead who got paid to say this and make this video
(If you look closely, he’s clearly reading off of cue cards). No respected news outlet will likely touch this, but you can
be sure it will get regurgitated again and again among your brethren conservatives blogospherios.

so what if he is reading. he delivered it without breaks or word skips, and wanted to get it concise. anyone with any
prepared statement would do the same.

i dont know why people are so against this larry guy. eveyrone is saying nasty things about him, but if he shows his
face and gives his name and offers himself up to talk about it, he potentially has something to say. parts of it could be
true….

He did screw the state SENATE part up, so maybe it wasn’t written down after all. If you give any credence to this jerk

Actually, Eric, you seem to be somewhat biased on this topic and not what I’d consider an open-minded host. With
that in mind, I don’t see the point of stating my opinion, because it would either be pandering to your opinion or inviting

I always felt like there was something about Obama that just didn’t ring true. Call it your gut level instincts or the little
voice in your head. I do not like the way he can’t look someone in the eye and hedging on issues but I still don’t know
what his strength’s are. Praise the Lord and pass the biscuits is his basic theme song. Let’s hear what his plan for the
country is. The man hasn’t sold me on anything.

It’s not a good argument to stick up for Obama, and say, that because this guy is reading, then what he’s saying is
fake; because if you look, every time that Obama is speaking to a crowd, he has teleprompters to his left and his right.

Right on people. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The man in the tape is a mental patient who
wasn’t in Chicago in 1999 because he was in a mental institution. The media did its job and didn’t follow the memo like
Fox News did with the false Muslim smear. Obama was not a State Rep. - since 1996 Obama was a State Senator.
Obama didn’t use a limo and there isn’t any record to back up even one of the dates he mentions. Also for someone
making 300K/week he would know the right drug terms. The crack and powder would be ice and dust.

Finally!!! I have been waitng for the “stuff” to start “oozing out” around the Obama tightly packaged WINS. This is what
happens with “Front-runner ” status. “Stuff” starts happening. Larry is consenting to a lie-detector test. Obama isn’t
even addressing this. It is not going to go away, whether he does or not. It is apparent, Larry isn’t going away either.
Larry, I believe you!! Follow through with your suit because that is the only protection you will have: that and having
made this public. Thank you as well for exposing yourself for the good of the country whether they appreciate it or not.
Slick-O needs to tell the truth about this, as you said, and stop “gaming” people as he has been doing. He’s a
democrat and welcome in this party regardless to his sexual appetite. Now those republicans, that he has attracted,
might not be too happy with this.

What’s known about the source of the Sinclair’s video? Who posted it on YouTube? Sinclair? He wrote his own cue
cards, set up a camera, took pictures of himself and posted them? All on his own, all of the sudden, after a decade,
with no reason why it would come out now? What’s his motivation? Can the YouTube posting be tracked to a
particular computer?

If the Clintons thought it were true, why wouldn’t they give the guy a shave and have him show up and file charges of
some kind? Sound’s more like a Karl Rove kind of strategy. Wierd innuendo and accusations. More swift boating.

Where does Sinclair live now? Does he even have a son?
His story seems awfully fishy to me.

This is utter BS!

Who is this guy? What was his occupation in 1999? What club did this allegedly happen at? Any photos of him and
State Sen. Obama together? What did they talk about?

This is a blatant attempt to smear Obama’s character without any merit. If you believe this, then you MUST believe
that Jeff ‘Bulldog’ Gannon was sneaking into the White House to have gay orgies with Karl Rove, GW Bush, and Ken
Mehlman!

A reporter in chicago did his research and found that this man was in a mental institution in the time he specified.
Not only that, but the graduation he mentioned was two weeks before the date he mentions. Keep in mind that an
insane man would pass a polygraph test, because he would really believe it happened.

The burden of proof is on Larry.
He is the accuser. Filing a lawsuit does not constitute proof of anything, anyone can file a lawsuit. Also, if you look at
the lawsuit in detail on smokingun.com you can see that Larry doesn’t even have an attorney, he is acting as his
own…..you know the old saying “A man who represents himself has a fool for an attorney”. If I was a betting man I
would say his case will be dismissed and Larry Sinclair’s story will be relegated to the trash bin.

hi my name is larry sinclair I am an ugly, crazy, toothless crackhead who is obsessed with Barack Obama. I am
delusional and am trying to get attention. I performed oral sex on Dick Cheney and George Bush, while Ron Paul sat
by watching and masturbating. Hillary Clinton videotaped the whole thing to watch by herself. This information needs
to be told.
I am challenging Ron Paul to take a polygraph test which I will submit to as well. Ron Paul has done greatly to prevent
this.

Thank you

I guess that is why when I watch him during one of his campaign speeches, he appear strained and yellowish/pale
complexion. Almost like he was sick and feeling weak.

Well there is something strangely effeminate about Barack Obama. He does dress in a metrosexual fashion and that
could be one step either way, so they say. Maybe that is why white woman like him so much, we see his feminine side
showing, and we do so love our homosexual pals.

If that is not true they should have addressed this accusation immediately. Instead they allowed it to traverse the world.

Wow, the only thing surprising about this is that some people actually expect Barack to respond to something like this.
Any crackhead or mentally distrubed individual can make a YouTube video with outrageous allegations about a
candidate for president (and this just proves that some people do.) If Barack wasted his time responding to everyone
with a webcam (supposing he even knows about this), he would never have time to get his message out.

any more our business than I thought Bill Clinton’s was.

But let’s get right and let all the sex talk alone unless it is something that directly affects the campaign, that includes
Obama, Clinton and Edwards.

To anyone who gives any credibility to this story I question your sanity. The hyperbole from some of these comments
is simply astounding.

Do you have any critical thinking skills? Would you be just as likely to believe a YouTube video about alien abduction?
I suppose you also believe it if someone said that the sun revolves around the earth and that the earth is flat. Think
people. WAKE UP.

“If that is not true they should have addressed this accusation immediately. Instead they allowed it to traverse the
world.”

Think for a minute Terry1. I know I’m asking a lot but for crying out loud. Do you really think that any candidate is
going to waste their time tracking down every baseless assertion made by some YouTube hack? Take your head out

I think Obama should deal with this because you can be sure the Republicans will drag it out as soon as he gets the
nomination and Swift Boat the hell out of him. I don’t know if I believe this guy, and could care less about Obama’s
sexual proclivities, but the drug aspect is worrisome. To clarify some things said on this blog that this guy does not say
or do: 1. He says Obama left for a while and then returned with the drugs, not that Obama was carrying them with him.
2. He also has 3 other videos online, one where he very clearly shows his teeth, so toothless he is not. 3. The person
on this blog who asserts Larry was in an institution should show what proof he has of that allegation. (Just because he
doesn’t look like a rich, upscale person, doesn’ t mean people on this blog should make things up. That solves nothing.
Dismissing this won’t make it go away, so it needs to be dealt with before the nomination. The biggest thing that
bothers me is why the media isn’t picking this up? Faux News in particular always jumps on anything to nail the
Dems… unless the Repub henchmen are waiting to slay the giant with this after he’s nominated. That is a scary
thought to me… more scary than finding out the truth of this allegation. I care less about either Obama or Hillary than I
care about the future of this country. Either one works for me, but what doesn’t work is another Republican in office
and John McCain scares the bejeesus out of me.

To all the posters who claim Obama should take a lie detector test, my response is that all presidential candidates
should do the same to clear the table of rumors that hound all the candidates. We could, for example demand that
McCain be wired up and asked if he in fact gave away information to the enemy when he was tortured. This claim has
been “out there”.

In other words, lets give all the candidates the “anal probe”. As an apolitical observer, I will just sit back and enjoy.

NOT TRUE! First of all if this was true there is no way Obama would be running for President knowing that such
allegations could destroy his life and embarrass his wife & kids. There is no way he would put his wife and kids
through this. OBAMA LOVES HIS WIFE & KIDS DEARLY - HE WOULD NOT EMBARRASS THEM IN THIS WAY.
WHY WOULD HE RUN FOR PRESIDENT KNOWING THAT EVERYTHING YOU’VE EVER DONE IN YOUR LIFE
WILL SURFACE TO THE PUBLIC DISPLAY OF THE WHOLE WORLD. I am from Chicago and the Chicago media &
politics are tough and unforgiving. When he ran for the US Senate his opponents and the media turned every stone
looking for the dirt on Obama to no avail.

Larry Seems like a needy person seeking attention. He’s acting as his own attorney, (because no self-respecting
attorney would file such garbage) And he doesn’t want to be investigated. Hum. His only ace is the “lie detector” test.
All garbage.
Someone get him some help and off the internet.

Lie detectors generally have a very positive image among people - there’s a common perception that they are
accurate and reliable. Actually, it would be better to describe it as a misperception because lie detectors are neither
accurate nor reliable

An expose on private polygraph firms aired by 60 Minutes in 1986 underscores the subjectivity of the process and its
susceptibility to confirmation bias due to the contamination of an examiner’s diagnosis with information obtained
outside of the formal polygraph test. As summarized by Ben-Shakhar (1991, 236):

Three different polygraph firms were independently called to test an alleged theft of a camera and lens from a
photography magazine office employing four employees. In fact, nothing was stolen from the office, but the polygraph
examiners were told that it could only have been done by one of the four employees. Each polygraph examiner was
told that “it might have been—,” with a different employee being fingered in each case (a decidedly weak fingering). In
each case, the polygraph examiner identified the “fingered” employee as deceptive, and cleared the other “suspects.”
Moreover, all polygraph examiners expressed complete confidence in their decisions. This demonstrates not only that
polygraph examiners can go wrong, but that their judgment and decision-making processes are infected by a
systematic and powerful source of bias, a bias caused by contamination.
(source: Skeptical Inquirer Magazine)

It’s really sad so many people believe that a polygraph would be definitive. This is scary.

Nuf said.

The thing with a polygraph is that if this guy believes he is telling the truth, then it won’t register as a lie. He could have
met someone he *believes* to be Senator Obama, and it will come out clean on the poly. The poly doesn’t proove
truth, but detects deception. Also, if this guys is a pathological liar and truly believes his story then the machine will not

The Obama’s demolish the ignorant and absurd stereotypes about Black Americans. Not only to America, but to the
world. Their image forces some people to actually do something they may have never done before, think.

Think about how stupid your midset has been about an entire group of people. Think about how ridiculous your
grandfathers and fathers and uncles sounded when they cracked those racist jokes. Think about petty and
meaningless the media is when they project one-sided stories, always making the non-white person seem like the
‘bad-guy.’ Think about all the excuses you yourself may have used to justify why ‘those people’ make you life harder,
when in realtiy, you life is hard because you, yourself mad it that way. And you’re upset because you thought your skin
color would get you further, but it didnt.

This ‘Larry Sinclair’ guy is irrelavant. If he had any type of importance, we would be watching him on TV instead of
hearing about Britney Spears every damn day.

He is a Black man, with his intelligent, flawless black wife and their beautiful family. Is this the best they can do in their
futile attempts to smear him? Give me a break.

There’s a new debunking site that just showed up at http://larrysinclair.com. It really needs some links.. fast. This
idiocy can and will get more and more traction as the campaign wears on. There is no overestimating the gullibility and
overarching stupidity of the American electorate.

Larry Sinclair was in a mental hospital during the time he says he was in Illinois. He was suffering from sever
psychosis due to schizophrenia. He currently resides in a government subsidized home for the mentally ill and
disabled.

LARRY SINCLAIR IS A VERY SICK MAN, HE NEEDS HELP!!!

People, we can’t just believe any crazy claim from a youtube video!

Also, anyone can file a lawsuit. There are thousands of frivolous lawsuits dismissed every year, this will no doubt be
one of them.

Larry is a sick man who is after a quick buck and his 15 minutes of fame, nothing else….nothing more.

Smokinggun.com says Sinclair lives at 600 W Superior St. #604 Duluth MN 55802. That is what Larry filed in Court
which is public record for anyone to see. According to H.U.D. records which are also public, that address is a building
with 154 units called Gateway Tower and is a complex for the elderly and disabled. Perhaps Sinclair’s disability is that
he is mentally ill? He claims that he was a drug dealer himself but he needed Obama to get him some cocaine? And
then a public official is going to go run and get a stranger some drugs like a street runner? If Sinclair was making the
kind of money he claims he was making according to his interviews–$250,000 a month(?), why is he broke now and
living in H.U.D. housing?

You claim that “Larry Sinclair was in a mental hospital during the time he says he was in Illinois. He was suffering from
sever psychosis due to schizophrenia.” Where does that information come from. It’s important for the Wikipedia article
we’ve started on this madness:

In answer to all the whining that the NY Times, as well as the MSM aren’t carrying the Sinclair story, neither are
Limbaugh, FOX, nor the NY Post, all of which hate Obama. The story isn’t being carried because, as a blogger named
Mau put it: All this guy ( Sinclair ) proves is that he’s a drug addicted cock sucker in search of an easy buck’

Add to this that Sinclair is a Ron Paul operative:

FYI#1: CNN, MSNBC & FOX all know about this, and others. They have researched this story and will not air it
because it is libelous, inaccurate, and fraud based on the ranting of a very sick man with a self-admitted mental
disorder and self-admitted criminal history where he says, “…I actually revealed some things about myself that could
put me away for quite a bit of time…”

FYI#2: We are finding hints that Larry Sinclair was in a mental hospital during the time he says he was in Illinois. He
was suffering from sever psychosis due to schizophrenia.(Maybe drug induced? He’s a self admitted heavy user or
was)

FYI#3: We have found some discrepancies about graduation dates and that there are multiple graduation dates, but
none seem to coordinate with Mr. Sinclair’s libelous statements.

FYI#4: In Larry’s radio Interview he revealed that he has a past that could have him put behind bars. It’s about 2/5
near 1/2 way into the interview, JUST before a break.

“…I actually revealed some things about myself that could put me away for quite a bit of time…”

FYI#5: Though RON PAUL did not do this, some of his supporters are really pushing this video in their blogs, chats
and postings. Another even attachs posters of this rebuttal…The Ron Paul Fringe is pushing this more than Clinton. A
Google search finds more Ron Paul supporters doing this than Clinton. RON PAUL is a Fine man with great intension
for this nation, it is misguided followers as well as Clinton’s.

Here are some posts for others that may sway your opinion. PLEASE RESEARCH for yourself. DON’T Blindly believe
ANYTHING you read.

kujayhawklaw says, “I got really worked up about this. I insulted his methods to the point I got him to call me
personally at home. He was friendly, but requested that I start sites against him because controversy helps him sell
his message. Nice guy, but a fraud.”

asdffd says, “I just asked this guy on his video if he had ever been convicted of fraud. Soon after he made a post
saying he would be busy for a few days and not be able to post for awhile. When I tried to make a follow up comment
my comment wasn’t posted- I think he blocked me from posting. I think the truth is going to come out about Larry
Sinclair and it ain’t gonna be pretty. The first video he made- it looks like it was made in a hotel room. I wonder if
someone put him up to it.”

PoliticalJunk says, “LARRY SINCLAIRE BLOCKED MY SCREEN NAME TO COMMENT ON HIS VIDEO: YOU can
check out this website to know the Federal LAWSUIT: It shows his Address with is a HUD FACILITY for ELDERLY
and DISABLE PEOPLE (Mentally disable people too!) In a radio interview he even said he had mental problems as a
child.”

Larry has accepted $10,000 to take a lie detector test via a tabloid website. He claims his intentions are selfless to
expose Obama… They have promised another $90,000 if he passes for it for the exclusive. The price of ruining a
man’s life and robbing a nation of a great man, $100,000 and the loss of Larry’s soul and hurting millions.

NEW:Larry Sinclair lives at 600 W Superior St. #604 Duluth MN 55802. That is what Larry filed in Court which is public

This story is totally believable. Larry, although not attractive to straights, is very attractive. He is obviously a very
submissive bottom, limousine driver (that is a turn-on right there, I mean talk about power/stardom, etc), and drug
supplier. That is a hot night out.

Let’s look at Obama’s home life. Michelle obviously wears the pants. Barak is looking to ease the tension, like many
men, and simply wants to get away from the nags. Larry is a nice diversion without attachments. Wasn’t the Gurnee
Mall open during this time period. Shopping gives Barak the perfect cover. Look Honey, I got this for you. (of course
he’s not thinking STD). Of course, whenever these stories come out, the person is always a bimbo and is branded
crazy, drugged up, vengeful, or a political tool of the right/left.

What is the big deal if Barak and Michelle have an open-marriage? What if Obama is GAY??? Or Bi? Who cares! Live
and let live as long as you are not hurting anyone. If this is a political trick by Hilary, Barak should embrace it and point
out the hypocrisy of being pro-Gay, while Gay-bashing.

Barak will win in Nov. I believe it.

The Neo and Theo-Fascist Right are so desperate to stop Obama, having to rely, so totally, on a individual who is a
drug taking and ( likely ) dealing cock-sucker who has a long history of fraud and of mental illness. It’s even more
hilarious when these reactionaries claim that Larry Sinclair’s integrity is greater than that of the New York Times and
the MSM. This is the equivalent of stating that Hitler had far greater morality than Roosevelt.

Larry Sinclair may have been in a mental hospital during the time he says he was in Illinois. He was suffering from

Larry claims he was off his meds for a week so as to take the polygraph but if they have not accounted for the role that
Larry’s brain tumor might have on his beliefs (and also his clearly demonstrated erratic behavior) then they may be
measuring nothing more than delusions caused by the brain tumor. We have reason to believe that his condition is
fairly advanced given he said he had little more than a year to live (Globe Magazine).

Hi,

This is Larry Sinclair. First. I am posting this message in venues where I know my situation is discussed.First off, let
me apologize for the roller coaster ride I have put some of you through(myself included). I have been going through
various issues as of late, and have been having quite a tough time. I sincerely appreciate all the support I have
received from ALL OF YOU(you know who you are). However, I think it’s time this all was finished. I was not being
honest. I did not give oral sex to Barak Obama, nor have I ever met him. I have just been extremely lonely lately, and I
guess I needed attention. I want to assure you all the money I recieved from this(both from whitehouse.com and The
Globe Magazine) will ALL go to charity. When all is said and done, I will NOT HAVE PROFITED from this. Now that I
have disclosed this, I hope you all will respect my right to privacy, and let it rest. I have made some good friends
during this, and will always cherish and respect the ones who have helped me.

Thank you,
Larry Sinclair

Some of you people are obviously cracked out yourselves. This guy has made unbelievable claims, and he went to
reputable news sources who quickly researched and threw it away. there are some inclined to believe that the press
loves Obama and for that reason will not address Sinclair’s claims, but when has the press EVER been able to pass
up a halfway apparent political sex scandal. For the press to report on a sex scandal, they need official proof of sexual
misconduct (court docs), hard evidence (photos, tapes, letters, etc), or the account of a participant. if someone is
saying they had sex, that’s 90% of the story right there, all other evidence is used to corroborate, but nothing of what
this guy said panned out, NOTHING.

I wonder why this gyes story is so hard for people to believe. The media has done such an awesome job at protecting
Obama and slamming the Clinton’s any chanmce they get. For once be open minded and try to be non bias. He
admitted to doing drugs so why is it such a stretch that he had oral sex with a man. Hello, stop the damn free
pubvlicity for him and do your job which is cover both sides of the story.
I’m so sick of the media protecting this guy. He’s not even qualified to be running in my opinion.

It’s not JUST the Globe article that trashed his credibility, (Not the Boston Globe…The Globe Magazine…no, not the

long, long way. I mean, think about it. If a tabloid that believes Bigfoot exists won’t believe Larry Sinclair then you’re

years he wants to share this story, why not when he(Obama)was a senator. i think that this guys is just bitter cause
he’s not part of the team on the way to the white house with Mr. Obama.

Larry Sinclair answers critics' claims that he's a toothless idiot
in a recently released follow-up video.
The most bizarre sideshow of the campaign so far is back in business again -- Larry Sinclair, the whacko who
made farsical claims in a YouTube video that he'd engaged in oral sex and cocaine use with Barack Obama, is

back Case
in the1:08-cv-00434-HHK
news. Case 1:08-cv-00434-JDB

First, he's filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against Obama, a well as Obama campaign head David Axelrod and
the Democratic National Committee:

Sinclair filed suit against Obama and his campaign guru David Axelrod in Minnesota district
court for allegedly attempting to abridge Sinclair's right to free speech, and for waging an
intimidation campaign against him.

Sinclair points to these remarks, made in a community blog on the official Democratic National Committee
website, as evidence supporting his lawsuit.
And apparently Obama's camp is trying to use Sinclair's attack to smear Hillary Clinton.

The whole thing is completely crazy, but that alone isn't enough to make it problematic for the
Senator. According to several political blogs, the Obama team is looking into any connections
Sinclair might have with the Clinton campaign.

In an attempt to prove or disprove Sinclair's wild accusations, whitehouse.com, a satirical website not connected
to any governmental agency or the White House (which uses web address whitehouse.gov), has offered Sinclair
an opportunity to prove his claim in a polygraph test, taking him up on his offer made in his original YouTube
video. Sinclair would receive $10,000 just for taking the test, pass or fail, and would receive $100,000 if the
polygraph results support his claim about Obama.

Alright, Larry Sinclair. We've seen your video saying you had a couple of hot nights with Barack
Obama. You "performed oral sex" on him while he smoked crack a few years back in Illinois.

It's a pretty good story but we have to admit that it sounds a bit far-fetched. Please pardon us for
being skeptical though Larry, it's just these crazy times we live in.

But the laughs just keep on coming. In the federal lawsuit filed by Sinclair (page 1, page 2, page 3) he listed his
home address in Duluth, Minnesota, and bloggers have looked into that address seeking to learn more about
Sinclair.
From the dearmurray.com website:

As it turns out, the address listed [for Sinclair] on the court filings is for an "elderly assisted care"
facility in Duluth, MN.
A section 236 HUD housing complex for the elderly and handicapped.
See p. 12 of the HUD report for Minnesota housing:
http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/hto/state/mn.pdf
Gateway Tower
Units: 154
Occupancy Eligibility: Elderly and Handicapped

Living in an assisted-care housing facility would be quite a step down from the big-spending big shot image
Sinclair tried to project in his original video.
And recently the same folks at dearmurray.com researched the original release of the Sinclair video, and came
to the conclusion that Ron Paul supporters were behind Sinclair.

"Mr. Sinclair" has given zero proof and absolutely few details about his life to support any sort of
credibility.
There appears to be substantial proof, however, that this is originating and/or being perpetuated
from the Ron Paul support base.

More to come. I'm sure there will be lots more finger-pointing, denials, and theatrics ahead.
Update:
I just came across a radio interview conducted by a conservative internet radio talk show (caosblog.com) where
Sinclair addresses the issues, and states he's negotiating with whitehouse.com over the details for taking the
polygraph test. Sinclair makes it sound as if the deal is moving forward and will happen.
Sinclair mentions in the hour-long interview that he's talked extensively with a Chicago Tribune newspaper
reporter who is investigating and fact-checking Sinclair's claims, and goes into more details about his lawsuit in a
radio show linked here.
Sinclair also says he's now being accused of working for Obama, and that he's doing this so that Obama can lay
claim that he's being attacked and smeared by Clinton.
He goes on the say he's not working for any campaign, and that reporters are telling him that the media won't
touch this story unless they can speak directly to the limo driver Sinclair claims introduced him to Obama.
Sinclair says the limo driver has requested that his name not be released at this time but is willing to 'go public'
once the story is picked up by the mainstream media.
Apparently the MSM is starting to make inquiries, and Sinclair mentions that he's talked to the Minneapolis StarTribune, Chicago Sun-tmes, and the New York Times.

Thanks for the backlink, folks! He's threatening to sue me now, too, for slander. My lawyer has offered to
represent me for free, so here's hoping he does!
1. Posted by Murray | February 17, 2008 10:01 PM

Isn't this the sort of story that Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler if confirmed, pays a million dollars for? And
what would end this story or keep it alive is for someone to talk to some of Larry Sinclair's friends,
neighbours and relatives and find out what type of person this guy is. As I suspect it will be the
description of someone who likes to invent stories or is very vulnerable to being persuaded that
something did happen like those people who give first person accounts of being involved in alien
abductions.

stories about Pres. Clinton and his sex escapades and some of Sen Clinton which I will not stoop to go
into because unsubstantiated and I will not try to slander someone's good name for political gain for

Clintons, I don't think they want to Go There!

If this person reside in a skill nursing facility due to his disability then it appeared that this individual could
have another condition why he is in the SNF. He appeared he can able to do his ADLs and capacity to
create such things and because of that more likely he has other physical and mental conditions that
qualified him to be in that environment. Government subsidized care required substantiated medical
conditions in order to qualify. The question is, if he is disable, then how long he has been that way? Is it
congenital or due to other reasons such as car accident? There are thousands of questions why he is in
this facility and that alone raises the validity of his case.
4. Posted by stclaire, San Diego | February 18, 2008 11:46 AM

Sinclair answered that question in one of the interviews, stating that he has a non-congenital, physical
disability only.
Perhaps questions about his disability will be included in the poiygraph test.

I am hoping also that the test will include her past mental condition. People should also take in
consideration that this type of test is not exactly 100%. People with extreme neurophysical superiority
can possibly beat this mode of testing. Whoeve is paying for this test, they should also consider asking
Sinclair permission (in writing) to research his past medical records. Mind you, even childhood past
medical conditions will indicate something. They should not rely on this test. They have to dig deeper. If

How do you know Sinclair's not telling the truth? He's got specific dates and places -- should be easy for
a few MSM journalists to take a few days and ask the right questions.
If Obama used crack in 1999, then that's it for him. Do you even want to know? Most Obama fans
probably don't.
7. Posted by Zevon | February 18, 2008 12:29 PM

Specific dates and places could be all connected into a possible story. In order to sensetionalized a "Me"
story, I myself sometimes could do that specially if you are going back to an almost ten years old
scenario. The most odd of this story, this individual came up with this recent allegation and elected not to
expose this story when the senator became famous right after the 2004 democratic convention or even
right after the release of his famous books. This individual could not have the ability to predict that he is
running for president unless he is a gifted fortune teller. The disparity of sequence of events will even
induce question in the minds and intelligence of common people and that including me.
Alright, enough with this. I have laundry and cooking to do.

I listened to the Larry Sinclair interview from yesterday at blogtalkradio. The strangest thing he said was;
he's not going to release any physical or factual evidence (like receipts, etc) because of how the story is
being twisted by the blogosphere.
This is the first indication to me that he is crazy and might be lying. His not releasing anything factual is
WHY there is speculation. He could stop all the chaotic speculation, and probably the threats, by
revealing the very information he doesn't want to.
That's crazy.
He could've said it is being litigated or something else that would've made sense. Now it just smacks of
being made up with no physical proof.

Sinclair has stated that he lots of physical proof (credit card receipts, and I'm not sure what else) that he

Physical proofs after almost 10 years and pursue this issue now that he is running for president, that is
very incovenient. There's also that possibility that in some degree, a pocket of white people will never
accept a black person to be their leader. I came acrossed few insulting and degrading blogs referenced
to what I just mentioned.

15. Posted by stclaire, San Diego | February 19, 2008 7:03 AM

A polygraph test is highly reliable but not admissible as evidence in court. If they were unreliable cops
wouldn't ask spouses of homicide victims to take them to rule them out as suspects. If the guy takes the
test and passes next Tuesday I will believe him especially if Obama refuses to take one to prove his
innocence. If he proves to be a liar he should be taken out and shot after we waterboard him to find out
who really put him up to it.

Gee, let's ask Tucker Carlson and John Fund - hardly standard-bearers for the liberal media - since they
were both falsely acccused of sexual improriety by two DIFFERENT crazy people. Look it up.
Type in either one of their names and the word "rape" into Google and you'll see it for yourself.
Any loon can make a charge against someone.
As Carlson said, it used to be that when a sex scandal broke, if the actual charge wasn't true, at least
something was - the candidate or person accused did something sexual.
Then he was accused of rape in Louisville by some woman. He spent thousands of dollars not only
proving he wasn't there at the time of the alleged rape - but also that he had never been to Louisville in

his wife strikes me as a ball buster. There are a lot more black men invloved in the "down low" than most
people would think. These guys don't see themselves as gay, they just think they're cool. Like these

How is this different from the bogus letter that Dan Rather reported on about President Bush? The
answer - The liberal media is not jumping all over this even though there is no evidance.
I also like the bit about Obama's camp blaming Clinton. He probably thinks that the Hillary is in charge of
everything evil. Next the Obamanation will say that Hillary is charge of the VRWC.

even remotely believable. Someone is hoping to put doubts about Obamas drug use at a crucial time in
the primaries. I have my own suspicions but it's interesting the BJ was included in the story

Wizbang Blue: Jimmy Carter's Endorsement of Barack Obama
It's become quite predictable, the way in which the Obama campaign has managed and released the endorsements during the
campaign. Every time Barack's ass ends up in hot water the campaign rolls out another high-profile endorsement. When Obama
flubbed, flailed and failed miserably in last Wednesday Philadelphia debate... Shazam!, former Clinton White House notable Robert
Reich's endorsement of Barack Obama is announced. The fact is that Reich has been excoriating Clinton for months now, and the
endorsement was kept in the campaign's pocket and deployed when it could do them the most good. So when an endorsement is

Obama was a sitting state senator for the 14 District (Hype Park) who
was running for US Congress for the 1st Congressional District (which
is the South Side of Chicago) in late 1999. This is public record - look it
up. He announced in late September 1999. He was the underdog w/
name recognition around 11%
His opponent’s, sitting Congressman Bobby Rush, son was shot in
October 1999 - causing a huge outpouring of support for gun control.
Look it up. Obama suspended his campaign in deference to this for a
few weeks.
Russell Tupper
Kirkland, WA

Around the same time then Illinois Gov. Ryan joined forces w/Chicago
Mayor Daley tried to get some gun control legislation through a special
session of the state legislator. Obama missed the vote, because he was in
Hawaii for most of December. Look it up.
So - if Sinclair is to believed, about a month after Obama, sitting state
senator from Hyde Park, announces as a candidate in, what was to that
point, the biggest political race of his life and where he is a big
underdog and desperately trying to get his name recognition up in the
south side of Chicago and right before he flies out to Hawaii - where it’s
documented makes a huge mistake in not being there in Springfield a
for the gun control vote in December, Obama take the time to have ***
sex and cocaine with Sinclair - not ONCE, but TWICE?
Since Obama was on the routinely on the FRONT PAGE of Chicago
Papers in NOVEMBER OF 1999 as he was RUNNING FOR
CONGRESS does it seem REMOTELY plausible that he would risk the
biggest race of his career to have ANONYMOUS *** SEX and DO
DRUGS in or near the VERY SAME CONGRESSIONAL district he
was running for office in?

OBAMA IS MABUS, THE ANTI-CHRIST, THE BEAST 666!!!
1.- He will come as a man of Peace (Obama promises peace in Iraq,
defeat for the United States,a country he claims to serve.)
2.- He will come mounted on a white Female horse(Obama mother is
white who had 12 African husbands and lovers)
3.- He will come to deceive( Obama says he's a Christian but in fact he
was born a Muslim, practices the Islamic religion, prays Friday’s facing
Mecca)
4.- He will make himself the most powerful man on earth, if elected,
Mabus will be his name.
5.- He will try to destroy the Jewish People and Israel( Obama has said
he loves Arabs specially Palestinians, hates Israel and Jews. Admires
Hitler, Osama etc)
6.- He will present himself as good and righteous but in fact he's Satan
himself. Violence and Murder is in his heart
7.- Obama will help Iran and Al Qaida in their evil projects.
8.- Barack Hussein Obama is the “King of the South” predicted in the
Bible.(Daniel .11, Kenya is south of Jerusalem)
9.- Obama comes to implant muslim Sharia Law upon America.

10.- Obama will enslave American women forever with Sharia Law.
11.-Mabus will finish his term on 2012,predicted to be the end of the
world.
11.- Mabus will use Mind Control to obtain control of the ignorant
masses, only those who read this note will be free from his mental hold.
12.-Mabus has come to destroy the finest country in the world, America.
Mabus has come to steal your soul and your children's souls.
13.- It's written and will come to pass, Mabus will try to destroy the
world with nuclear weapons but his first attack will be against Israel and
the Jewish people. The beast 666 hates G-d's chosen people.
Obama is the Anti-Christ, beware of him and don't let you be deceived
by Him.
Supporters of Obama: 1.5 billion Muslims, Oprah, Louis Farrakanh,
Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and all American Muslims.

This time is your turn to suffer America, the next 4 years will be pure
hell if Mabus becomes your King.

Lots of str8 guys get oral sex from gays; its very common. If women
knew what their husbands really are up to, the divorce rate would
skyrocket.
But lots of people don't do cocaine. On the other hand, respectable
people don't do cocaine - whatever made you think ANY member of the
senate was respectable. lol. u've gotta be joking.

If voters thought experience is more important than ideas then Grey
Davis would still be goveror of California. Anyway, McCain’s retort
about earmarks will likely be a significant theme of his. What else can
he talk about? Will we talk about providing Social Security to Mexican
citizens in Mexico? No. Will we talk about federal funds provided to
sactuary cities? No. Will we talk about the changing demographics of
the country, where the population aged 20 and under in 2050 will be
70% Mexican? No. Will we talk about Social Security investment
accounts? No. Will we talk about providing water to Mexico? No. Will
we talk about Mexican debt - and how that is related to providing water
to Mexico. No. Will we talk about the impact of the mortgage crisis on
student loans? No. Will we talk about the nation’s parks? No. Will we
talk about gays in the military? Yes. Will we talk about abortion? Yes.
Will there be more Swift Boat Veterans? No because the bomb that
started the Forestal fires came from McCain’s aircraft. There is a reason
conservatives don’t like McCain - and it’s because McCain doesn’t talk
about issues that matter. He’ll pander to any Mexican - any retiree - any
one with money - any military contractor. The *only* man who wanted
to focus on issues was Tancredo and the media didn’t give him a
chance.

hi my name is larry sinclair I am an ugly, crazy, toothless crackhead
who is obsessed with Barack Obama. I am delusional and am trying to
get attention. I performed oral sex on Dick Cheney and George W Bush,
while Ron Paul sat by watching and masturbating. Hillary Clinton also
tossed Dick Cheneys salad. I really want to get attention because I have
no life.

The burden of proof is on Larry.
He is the accuser. Filing a lawsuit does not constitute proof of anything,
anyone can file a lawsuit. Also, if you look at the lawsuit in detail on
smokingun.com you can see that Larry doesn't even have an attorney, he
is acting as his own.....you know the old saying "A man who represents
himself has a fool for an attorney". If I was a betting man I would say
his case will be dismissed and Larry Sinclair's story will be relegated to
the trash bin.

Look - if this was true, Larry had plenty of chance to come out with this
before now. Instead he comes out when Obama starts winning. Now he's
getting frantic with his activities and filing this lawsuit when at a time
when Obama has big momentum. And Larry says that he doesn't care
who people vote for? This suit will be thrown out of court, mark my
words, but I believe the aim of it is simply to stop enough people from
voting for Obama for him to continue this momentum. This is in the
midst of many other - non Larry related - false attacks that are aimed at
derailing the momentum.
I know that Larry had passed on information to a Chicago Tribune
reporter because he said so himself on additional videos he posted. I am
now seeing posts saying that a Chicago Tribune reporter looked into it
and found that Larry was actually in a mental institution at the time of
the alleged incident.

No one should base their vote on allegations that cannot be
substantiated.

But lots of people don't do cocaine. On the other hand,

think ANY member of the senate was respectable. lol.

Nor would it matter if he were gay, nor would it matter if he used
Marijuana or something in earlier years.
Yes you are absolutely right, it shouldn't matter about about a persons
private sexual activity, but try telling that to Bill Clinton, after what the
republicans did to him in the 90's. We live in the real world of politics,

Well, is this the truth or not, or just another hack job by someone or
some people representing the Clintons? I viewed all four videos
(basically the same)and all the guy is asking for is Obama to get honest.
Why didn't he bring this up in 2004?

3.- He will come to deceive( Obama says he's a
Christian but in fact he was born a Muslim, practices
the Islamic religion, prays Friday’s facing Mecca)
4.- He will make himself the most powerful man on
earth, if elected, Mabus will be his name.
5.- He will try to destroy the Jewish People and Israel
( Obama has said he loves Arabs specially
Palestinians, hates Israel and Jews. Admires Hitler,
Osama etc)
6.- He will present himself as good and righteous but
in fact he's Satan himself. Violence and Murder is in
his heart
7.- Obama will help Iran and Al Qaida in their evil
projects.
8.- Barack Hussein Obama is the “King of the South”
predicted in the Bible.(Daniel .11, Kenya is south of
Jerusalem)
9.- Obama comes to implant muslim Sharia Law upon
America.
10.- Obama will enslave American women forever with
Sharia Law.
11.-Mabus will finish his term on 2012,predicted to be
the end of the world.
11.- Mabus will use Mind Control to obtain control of
the ignorant masses, only those who read this note will
be free from his mental hold.
12.-Mabus has come to destroy the finest country in the
world, America. Mabus has come to steal your soul
and your children's souls.
13.- It's written and will come to pass, Mabus will try
to destroy the world with nuclear weapons but his first
attack will be against Israel and the Jewish people.
The beast 666 hates G-d's chosen people.
Obama is the Anti-Christ, beware of him and don't let
you be deceived by Him.
Supporters of Obama: 1.5 billion Muslims, Oprah,
Louis Farrakanh, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and all
American Muslims.
This time is your turn to suffer America, the next 4
years will be pure hell if Mabus becomes your King.

Well I happen to think manlove is hot. I think Larry's story might have
more traction if he weren't a skank as in UGLY. First rule of scandal always bring the pretty. I love the idea of a Jimbo eruption. But I want
hot, sexy and pretty for my trouble. So Larry my advice to you lose
the trailer park hat, shave, get a some hair color and a trim and lose
the gut. If that doesn't help find a hot surrogate and you just might get
my full attention. Otherwise go find Bill and give him a blow job. I'll

For those of you who may have fallen for Mr. Sinclair's little
"practical joke" about Senator Obama, you are forgiven. It's
unfortunate that lonely people feel they have to lie to make friends,
but there it is. It turns out that Larry was in a mental hospital at the
time he says he met Barack Obama. Sorry, Larry. Game over.

save his life with 3 months of rehab.

A mazzzzing, I say, amazing what a man can achieve with a little help
from some classy friends, some rocky crack and a cigar shaped crack
pipe with the word "obama" graffitied onto the side of it.
Larry, boy, I say, Larry, somewhere there is a "very appropriate" job
for your kind in the current administration.
Your ability to "suck-up" will be highly valued and make you highly
favored..."Your-a-great-a merikan!"

After thinking about this, I'm thinking that it is a case of mistaken
identity and that Larry really believes this happened but just not with
who he thinks it did.

Hey, I'm serving in the US ARMY overseas, I just wanted to say this:
Everyone Larry has been proven a LIAR!
It has been proven by the media that he was in Walter Reed Mental
Hospital at the time he said he was in Illinois.
Also, Larry Sinclair now lives in a home for the mentally ill and
disabled.
HE WAS NOT IN ILLINOIS AT THAT TIME!!
Larry Sinclair is a seriously mentally ill individual, he is suffering
from SEVER psychosis, due to schizophrenia.

I think that could be true too, probably due to Larry Sinclair's severe
psychosis.

In the interview in the Remse show Larry Sinclair gives many details
about the story which don't seem improvised. But he gives no
evidence whatsoever that the other guy involved WAS indeed Obama.
He could have been any other (perhaps African-American) man, even
one with power (a politician, a businessman...). There are indications
about this, not based on what Sinclair said, but based on certain things
he did NOT say about "Obama". Remse never asked him: "HOW
ARE YOU SURE THE GUY WAS OBAMA?".

So, for Sinclair it would be quite easy to semi-lie: All he had to do is
call this guy "Obama", and keep the rest of the story (more or less)
intact. Once Sinclair got to convince himself (for whatever reasons)
that the unknown man he did drugs with nine years ago was "Senator
Obama", the rest of the story will unfold coherently in his mind.
