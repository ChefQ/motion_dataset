Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 8 of 49

Lead Plaintiffs Anthony Vidmar, Robert Ulrich, Mauro DiBacco, Charles E. Vernell, Jr,
and Nettie J. Vernell (“Plaintiffs”) submit the following memorandum in opposition to the
motion to dismiss their Amended Class Action Complaint (“Complaint”), filed by Defendants
Integral Systems (“Integral” or the “Company”), Alan W. Baldwin (“Baldwin”), John B.
Higginbotham (“Higginbotham”), William M. Bambarger (“Bambarger”), and Hemi G. LeeGallagher (“Lee-Gallagher,” collectively “Defendants”).
I.

INTRODUCTION
This straight-forward case arises from Integral’s restatement of three quarters of

unaudited financial reports to remove $10 million of prematurely recorded revenue which
significantly inflated the Company’s reported net income during the Class Period.1 Defendants’
motion to dismiss concedes that the operative complaint adequately pleads all but one element of
a securities fraud claim. With respect to that single element, scienter, Defendants rely upon a
series of implausible arguments to try to persuade the Court that the four categories of
accounting errors at issue – which were only fully explained to investors months after the fact, at
the urging of the SEC – were all just innocent mistakes. None of their arguments are persuasive.
First, Defendants seize upon out-of-context and obscure provisions to create a false
appearance of accounting “complexity” with respect to simple Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“GAAP”) provisions which have long stood as Integral’s own revenue recognition
policies.2 Belatedly located for the sole purpose of this motion, these provisions were never
disclosed to investors as part of Integral’s Class Period accounting policies. Additionally, the
1

The Class Period runs from February 4, 2008 and December 10, 2008, inclusive.

See Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, filed Oct. 26, 2009, Dkt.
No. 17 (“Def. Mem.”) at 12-16 and 29-32.

-1-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

claim that the accounting errors only came to light when top-tier auditor Ernst & Young agreed
to come aboard, to bring “quality and accuracy” to Integral’s financial reporting (Def. Mem. at
8), is belied by two facts: (1) Integral had previously engaged Ernst & Young as its outside
auditor before dismissing the firm several years earlier – in favor of Grant Thornton, who later
resigned and was replaced by Bernstein & Pinchuk;3 and (2) Bernstein & Pinchuk’s audited
reports for 2006 and 2007 were not restated.
Next, Defendants seek to use Integral’s self-inflicted internal control problems over basic
revenue recognition (which admittedly led to the material weaknesses at the root of the
restatement) as a shield.

Specifically, Defendants argue that they and other members of

Integral’s accounting team were in a period of “transition” into their positions, thereby
immunizing them from liability to investors for admittedly inflated revenue and income figures.
(Def. Mem. at 23-25 and 34-35.) Quite the opposite is true. Not only did three of the four
Individual Defendants join senior management prior to the Class Period,4 but all became officers
after the commencement of a three-year Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
investigation into former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Gary Prince’s role at Integral. As
described in a July 30, 2009 SEC Cease-and-Desist Order (entered in conjunction with Integral’s
offer of settlement), Integral had relied heavily upon former CFO Gary Prince for every aspect of
its accounting and public reporting for many years. (Compl. ¶¶ 36-37.) Thus, when they

at Ex. 1 (Form 8-K, filed January 6, 2004) (dismissing Ernst & Young) and Ex. 2 (Form 8-K,
filed Jan. 23, 2006) (Grant Thornton resignation).

Only Higginbotham came to the Company during the Class Period. (See Amended Class
Action Complaint, filed on September 21, 2009, Dkt. No. 14 (hereinafter cited as “Compl. ¶
__”), at ¶¶ 14-18.)

-2-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

assumed their offices, the Individual Defendants were well aware of Integral’s need to fill the
vacuum which arose upon Prince’s termination in early 2007 so as to ensure that Integral’s
publicly-reported financial figures were accurate. Although Baldwin claimed that he fit that bill
(Id. at ¶ 3), in 2008, Defendants consciously and recklessly chose to prematurely recognize
revenue on both routine transactions and two of the Company’s largest contracts – against
Prince’s express advice. (Id. at ¶¶ 38, 185.)
Defendants also deride Plaintiffs for alleging scienter based solely upon the Individual
Defendants’ executive positions.

(Def. Mem. at 20-22.)5

Not so.

Plaintiffs allege that

Defendants were well aware of Integral’s undisclosed accounting weaknesses and/or the revenue
recognition decisions made with respect to the items at issue. In an interview, Baldwin boasted
of his expertise with respect to the reporting required of public companies (Compl. ¶ 3) and,
during two conference calls, he discussed critical accounting personnel hires he and Bambarger
had made. (Id. at ¶¶ 49, 76.) Higginbotham, whose departure from Integral in August 2009 is
claimed to be “for reasons unrelated to this lawsuit,” (Def. Mem. at 4), had come to Integral with
the goal of “turning around a company he said had suffered from accounting lapses.”6

5

To criticize the allegations against each of them as “generic pabulum,” Defendants
cherry-pick general charging allegations, see Def. Mem. at 20-21 (citing Compl. ¶¶ 20, 182-83,
190, 199, 204), but ignore the allegations referenced in text and, inter alia, Compl. ¶¶ 184-86,
189, 191-96, 200-01, 210.

6

The claim that Higginbotham left for unrelated reasons – as opposed to leaving after
specifically addressing the accounting issues noted herein – is belied by an August 10, 2009,
Space News article, quoted in the text, which added: “One of Higginbotham’s tasks in taking the
Integral job was to clean up accounting practices that were recently the subject of a settlement
with the [SEC].” Peter B. de Selding, Satellite Company’s Chief Resigns Amid Lower
Expectations, Space News, August 10, 2009, http://www.space.com/news/090810-busmonintegral-higginbotham.html (Friedman Decl. Ex. 3). In fact, Integral’s announcement of
-3-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 11 of 49

Bambarger specifically described the accounting rationale used by the Company with respect to
the items at issue, both during the Class Period and in post-Class Period correspondence with the
SEC. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 27, 29, 30, 48, 61(c), 74-75, 91.)
Regarding motive, the Individual Defendants contend that scienter is negated because
they would have suffered financially had they exercised overpriced options. Although they
grumble about being “harmed” by such option grants, none bought shares during the Class
Period. (Def. Mem. at 27-28.) To the contrary, Baldwin, who remained at Integral after stepping
down as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), sold all of his stock in August 2008 – at a price near
the Class Period high. (Compl. ¶ 196.)
For three quarters, in unaudited financial statements, Defendants recklessly recognized
revenue in violation of GAAP, Integral’s accounting policies, and against the advice of Integral’s
long-time accounting maven.

When the need to restate was made public, Integral’s price

plummeted. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Injured investors are entitled to redress.
II.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Integral builds satellite ground systems and equipment for command and control,

integration and test, data processing, and simulation.

The Company has a domestic and

international customer base that includes government and commercial satellite operators,
spacecraft and payload manufacturers, and aerospace systems integrators. (Id. at ¶ 2.) During
the Class Period, from February 4th until December 11th, 2008, Integral prematurely and
improperly accounted for revenue from warranties, equipment, and product sales with respect
to a number of contracts, chief among them the Next Generation Global Positioning System
Higginbotham’s departure prominently highlighted his achievement of “significant gains in
compliance and governance.”

-4-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

(“GPS OCX”) contract and the Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System
(“RAIDRS”) contract with the Federal Government, which, along with one additional contract,
were responsible for 50-60% of the Company’s government contract revenues, and 25-30% of
the Company’s total revenues. (Id. at ¶ 21.)
Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges in detail how Defendants artificially inflated Integral’s stock
price by prematurely recording revenues in violation of Sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The Complaint names
as defendants both Integral and four individuals who were intimately involved with the contracts
and/or accounting practices at the core of the restatement, to wit, (i) Baldwin, who served as
President, CEO and a director of Integral until July 9, 2008, at which time he resigned as CEO
but continued serving as President until December 10, 2008, then stepped down as President and
continued serving as a director; (ii) Higginbotham, who became CEO and a director of Integral
on July 9, 2008, and became President on December 10, 2008; (iii) Bambarger, who served, at
all relevant times, as Integral’s CFO and Treasurer; and (iv) Hemi G. Lee-Gallagher, who served,
at all relevant times, as Integral’s Corporate Controller (collectively, the “Individual
Defendants”). (Id. at ¶¶ 14-18.)
The misleading financial statements began with the Company’s earnings report for the
first quarter of fiscal year 2008 (“Q1’08”), issued on February 4, 2008.

(Id. at ¶ 43.)

Announcing record financial results and raising earnings projections, Integral also indicated that
it had accelerated license revenue from the GPS OCX contract, a subcontract for Northrop
Grumman (id. at ¶ 24), into Q1’08, instead of recognizing it throughout the fiscal year. (Id. at ¶¶
43-45.) In a conference call later that day, Defendant Bambarger discussed the GPS OCX

-5-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 13 of 49

contract, reiterating “we negotiated favorable contract terms that included upfront delivery of the
licenses under the contract, allowing us to recognize license revenue and profit in the first
quarter, rather than during the entire fiscal year, as we had originally planned.” (Id. at ¶ 48.)
During that call, Defendant Baldwin boasted that Integral had made a number of key hires in the
accounting department, including a senior corporate controller, a senior contract administrator,
and a senior treasury analyst. (Id. at ¶ 49.) On February 7, 2008, Integral filed its Q1’08 results
with the SEC on Form 10-Q, affirming its announced results, explaining Integral’s critical
accounting policies, and certifying the accuracy of the financial information. (Id. at ¶¶ 50-60.)
On April 28, 2008, Integral issued a press release announcing its financial results for
Q2’08, highlighting that “[t]he results for the first six months of 2008 include a large amount of
license revenue generated from the GPS OCX contract.” (Id. at ¶ 71.) Later that day, in a
conference call, Defendant Bambarger again explained Integral’s Q1’08 accounting reversal,
which allowed for a “very high profit” on the GPS OCX contract. (Id. at ¶ 75) (GPS OCX
license revenue was “originally anticipated to be spread throughout the remainder of this year
and even a little into the next fiscal year”). In response to a question about any similar “one
time” financial events in Q2’08, Bambarger noted one “major significant event that would be out
of the ordinary;” with respect to the RAIDRS contract, “we did accelerate some contract cost at
the request of the customer and that has an effect on revenue and project cost almost equal.” (Id.
at ¶ 74.) During the call, Baldwin again boasted that he and Bambarger had been “beefing up”
the accounting staff by “a lot of very talented people.” (Id. at ¶ 76.) The Form 10-Q for Q2’08,
filed May 7, 2008, attributed revenue and gross profit increases in Integral’s Ground Systems
Segment “primarily” to the GPS OCX Q1’08 license revenue. (Id. at ¶¶ 79-80.) The Form 10-Q

-6-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 14 of 49

also set forth the same accounting policies and the same internal controls reassurances that were
contained in the Q1’08 Form 10-Q. (Id. at ¶¶ 81-85, 87.)
On July 24, 2008, Integral announced its financial results for Q3’08 in a press release and
conference call, in which Defendant Bambarger stated: “Revenue was higher by 14% over the
prior year for our Government business, due to GPS and RAIDRS projects and higher license
and maintenance revenue than we had over the prior year.” (Id. at ¶ 99.) On August 7, 2008,
Integral filed its quarterly report for Q3’08 on Form 10-Q and continued to highlight the GPS
OCX contract, stating, “The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the GPS OCX
(Next Generation Control Segment) contract which included $2.4 million of license revenue.”
(Id. at ¶ 101.) The Form 10-Q set forth the same accounting policies and the same internal
controls reassurances that were contained in the earlier-filed Form 10-Qs. (Id. at ¶¶ 102-106,
108.)
On December 11, 2008, Integral shocked investors when it revealed that its unaudited
financial statements for the interim periods ended December 31, 2007, March 31, 2008, and June
30, 2008, should no longer be relied upon due to an error in the accounting treatment for certain
transactions with respect to the timing of revenue recognition. (Id. at ¶ 125.) As a result,
Integral would have to restate its previously-filed financial results for those three periods
(hereinafter, the “Restatement” and the “Restatement Period”).

Integral estimated the

approximate net impact of the adjustments would result in a decrease of $10 million in revenues,
a decrease of $3 million in gross profit, a decrease of $4 million in operating income, and a
decrease of $0.13 in earnings per share. (Id. at ¶ 125.) On this news, shares of Integral declined

Filed 11/30/09 Page 15 of 49

$6.38 per share, or 28.61%, to close at $15.92, on unusually heavy trading volume. (Id. at ¶
126.)
Following this announcement, Defendants gradually released the details surrounding the
Restatement, to obscure the fact that they had violated basic revenue recognition principles. (Id.
at ¶ 5.) First, during the December 11, 2008 conference call, only three types of accounting
errors were briefly identified. (Id. at ¶¶ 128-130.) Later, in its December 24, 2008, Form 10-K
for fiscal 2008, the Company vaguely described four types of accounting errors, gave line item
changes for each restated quarter, and admitted to material weaknesses in internal controls over
accounting procedures, including revenue recognition. (Id. at ¶¶ 132, 134.) The Restatement
also admitted that Integral’s internal controls – created to ensure timely recognition of revenue –
were ineffective, and that deficiencies in the internal controls caused the material misstatements
of previously recognized revenue, gross profit, and net income. (Id. at ¶ 134.)
On February 12, 2009, in response to a number of questions posed by the SEC, the
Company explained, inter alia, the four restated items, identifying the accounting error, the
correct GAAP principle and/or company policy that should have been followed, and the total
dollar amount of each type of error. (Id. at ¶¶ 5(c), 63-65, 88(d).) The Company also provided
dates on which the actual and expected revenue was or would ultimately be recognized. (Id. at ¶
136.)
On March 20, 2009, the Company responded to an additional SEC inquiry, as to why the
explanations in the February 12, 2009 letter had not been disclosed to investors. (Id. at ¶ 137.)
In its response letter, the Company stated that it believed that the Restatement, as set forth in the

-8-

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 16 of 49

Form 10-K, complied with GAAP and the securities laws, but agreed nonetheless to supplement
its disclosures in its next periodic filing. (Id. at ¶ 137.)
On May 6, 2009, providing additional details not previously given to the SEC, Integral’s
Form 10-Q for Q2’09 explained the accounting bases for the Restatement, and specified both the
restated items and the quarters in which each error occurred. (Id. at ¶¶ 5(e), 64, 92, 138.)
Finally, on August 5, 2009, the Company reported that by the end of Q3’09, it had
recognized $10 million of the $10.5 million removed from the books for the first three quarters
of fiscal 2008, and would finally recognize the remainder in Q4’09 and Q1’10. (Id. at 5(f).)

ARGUMENT
A.

Defendants Bear a Heavy Burden to Obtain Dismissal of the Complaint

The Supreme Court’s decision in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S.
308 (2007), reaffirms that, even for motions to dismiss securities fraud actions, courts must
accept the factual allegations in a plaintiff’s complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences
from them. See id. at 322; see also Matrix Capital Mgmt. Fund, LP v. BearingPoint, Inc., 576
F.3d 172, 176 (4th Cir. 2009). Moreover, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court should not
require “heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that
is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Twombly’s
requirement of “facial plausibility” is satisfied “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct
alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009). Significantly, a motion to dismiss
merely tests “the sufficiency of the complaint and, most importantly, does not resolve contests
surrounding the facts, the merits of the claim, or the applicability of defenses.” Iron Workers

Local 16 Pension Fund v. Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Co., 432 F. Supp. 2d 571, 577 (E.D. Va. 2006)
(internal quotations omitted).
To state a claim for securities fraud, a plaintiff must allege:

“‘(1) a material

misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the
misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the
misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’” BearingPoint, 576
F.3d at 181 (emphasis in original) (quoting Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,
Inc., 552 U.S. 148 (2008)). In their motion, Defendants tacitly acknowledge that the Complaint
meets all but one element of the securities fraud claims – scienter. As described below, the
Complaint more than adequately meets the requirements for pleading scienter.
B.

Taken as a Whole, the Complaint Presents a Strong Inference of Scienter

Under the PSLRA, plaintiffs must allege facts that give rise to a “strong inference” of
scienter. Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 314; BearingPoint, 576 F.3d at 181. When analyzing scienter,
courts should ask, “When the allegations are accepted as true and taken collectively, would a
reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference?”
Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 314. In the Fourth Circuit, scienter may be alleged by pleading either
intentional misconduct or recklessness, which is conduct “[s]o highly unreasonable and such an
extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the
plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the
defendant must have been aware of it.” BearingPoint, 576 F.3d at 181 (internal quotations
omitted); Public Employees’ Ret. Ass’n v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 551 F.3d 305, 313 (4th Cir.
2009); In re PEC Solutions, Inc. Sec. Litig., 418 F.3d 379, 387 (4th Cir. 2005). When evaluating

- 10 -

scienter allegations, courts in this circuit use a “flexible, case-by-case analysis.” PEC Solutions,
418 F.3d at 389 (citing Ottmann v. Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc., 353 F.3d 338, 344-45 (4th
Cir. 2003)).
1.

Defendants’ Violations of Basic GAAP Rules and Integral’s Own
Accounting Policies, Which Necessitated a Restatement, Give Rise to a
Strong Inference of Scienter

Defendants seek to paint a picture of a company “in transition” that made four accidental
accounting errors – two on very significant projects – while dealing with complicated GAAP
provisions. Further, they claim that only after Integral finally secured the services of a top-flight
auditor, Ernst & Young, was it able to reach the correct accounting determination for each of
these transactions. The very straight-forward facts alleged and applicable GAAP principles do
not support Defendants’ version of events.
a.

Application of Integral’s Long-Standing Revenue Recognition
Policies and Basic GAAP Precluded Recognition of the
Revenue at Issue

Four years prior to the Class Period, Ernst & Young served as Integral’s outside auditor.
Following the filing of the Form 10-K for fiscal 2003, Integral dismissed Ernst & Young. (See
Friedman Decl. Ex. 1.) For the next two years, Grant Thornton served as Integral’s outside
auditor before resigning on January 17, 2006. (See id. and Ex. 2.) Thereafter, until its dismissal
in September 2008, Integral employed the services of Bernstein & Pinchuk. (Compl. ¶ 115.)
Through this succession of auditors, Integral’s relevant revenue recognition policies remained
constant:
With respect to contract revenue, Integral stated, in 2003:
Revenue under cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts is recorded on the basis of direct costs plus
indirect costs incurred and an allocable portion of the fixed fee. Revenue from fixed-

- 11 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 19 of 49

price contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the
cost-to-cost method for each contract. (Friedman Decl. Ex. 4, Form 10-K, filed Dec. 12,
2003, at F-9).
… and in 2007:
Revenue under a fixed-price contract is recognized using a percentage of completion
method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs. Under a cost-plus
contract, we are reimbursed for allowable costs within the contractual terms and
conditions and are paid a negotiated fee. The fee may be fixed or based on performance
incentives. Revenue recognition under a cost-plus contract is based upon actual costs
incurred and a pro rata amount of the negotiated fee. (Def. Ex. A, 2007 Form 10-K, at
25).
With respect to software sales and services, Integral stated, in 2003:
Most of the Company’s contracts include the license of proprietary software products.
Sales of the Company’s software products take many forms. The Company sells (i)
software only (a “Software-Only Sale”), (ii) software and services together, or (iii)
software, services and hardware together. In addition, depending on a customer’s
requirements, the Company may or may not provide post-contract customer support
(“PCS”).
The Company’s recognition of revenue for sales of Company software products depends
on customer requirements and the nature of the contracts involved. In accordance with
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, for a Software-Only Sale, the Company
recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangements exists, delivery has occurred, the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable. In situations where software is sold together with services
and/or hardware, the Company recognizes software license revenue on a percentage of
completion basis.
With respect to PCS, the Company recognizes PCS revenue on a percentage of
completion basis when PCS is part of a broader fixed price contract that includes
software and services. Alternatively, when PCS services (i.e. software maintenance and
support) are awarded to the Company under a separate maintenance contract, the
Company recognizes PCS revenue on a straight-line basis pro rata over the term of the
maintenance contract. (Friedman Decl. Ex. 4, at F-9).
… and in 2007:
Many of our contracts include the sale of company-owned proprietary software products.
Sales of our software products may take many forms. We sell (1) software only (a
“Software-Only Sale”), (2) software and services together, or (3) software, services, and

- 12 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 20 of 49

hardware together. In addition, depending on a customer’s requirements, we may or may
not provide post-contract customer support (“PCS”).
Our recognition of revenue from sales of software products depends on specific customer
requirements and the nature of the contracts involved. In accordance with SOP 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” for a Software-Only Sale, we recognize revenue when
all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured. In situations where software is sold together with services and/or
hardware, we recognize software license revenue on a percentage of completion basis.
We recognize PCS revenue on a percentage of completion basis when PCS is part of a
broader fixed-price contract that includes software and services. Alternatively, when PCS
services (i.e., software maintenance and support) are awarded to us under a separate
maintenance contract, we recognize PCS revenue on a straight-line basis pro rata over the
term of the maintenance contract. (Def. Ex. A, at 26).
The purpose of GAAP, as adopted in Integral’s policies set forth above, is “to provide a
reliable degree of predictability.” In re Raytheon Sec. Litig., 157 F. Supp. 2d 131, 148 (D. Mass.
2001). Sometimes, the application of simple accounting principles may involve certain factual
details; this does not make the proper GAAP determination too complex to preclude a finding of
scienter. In re MicroStrategy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 115 F. Supp. 2d 620, 638 & nn.35-36 (E.D. Va.
2000) (scienter alleged with respect to premature revenue recognition in violation of SOP 97-2).
Defendants concede that an “obvious” revenue recognition error gives rise to an inference
of scienter. (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing cases).) Contrary to Defendants’ efforts to complicate
matters, the straight-forward application of Integral’s policies and GAAP to the simple facts
involved would not allow Defendants to prematurely recognize any of the revenue at issue.
Defendants’ after-the-fact attempts to create the illusion of complexity are transparent; they
cannot mask the fact that each of these errors is obvious.

GPS OCX Software Contract

As a preliminary matter, software sales range from those that provide a license for a
single software product to those that, in addition to the delivery of software or a software system,
require significant production, modification, or customization of software. Defendants contend
that because the software licenses under the GPS OCX contract were delivered and paid for,7
Integral could recognize all $2.4 million of the license revenue when it was received, in Q1’08.
The basis for this claim is Integral’s purported application of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 81-1, ¶ 39 – a provision that permits
(otherwise) early revenue recognition where a contract can be “segmented.” (Def. Mem. at 12,
30; Def. Ex. Q.) Defendants are wrong for several reasons.
First, the GPS OCX contract did not meet the criteria for segmenting. SOP 81-1, ¶ 39
only allows the segmentation of contract elements “each of which the contractor negotiated
separately . . . and agreed to perform without regard to the performance of the others.” SOP 811, ¶ 40, further requires, inter alia, as proof that segmentation is legitimate, that separate bids
were made on each element and that the customer had the right to accept or reject each element.
(Def. Ex. Q.) On its face, the GPS OCX contract was not severable; it was submitted as part of
Northrop Grumman’s bid to the Air Force. (Compl. ¶ 24.) Further, the press release announcing
the contract award specifically noted the period of performance was through March 2009, and
Baldwin described the contract elements to include “systems-requirement analysis,” “preliminary
systems design,” and development of the “initial OCX system to work with existing GPM 2R-M
7

Although Defendants stress the receipt of payment for the licenses (Def. Mem. at 12),
they also acknowledge (id. at 13, 30), that revenue is not automatically recognizable upon
payment. In re The Baan Co. Sec. Litig., 103 F. Supp. 2d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 2000) (applying SOP
97-2).

- 14 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 22 of 49

satellites.” (Compl. ¶ 61(c)(i)&(ii).) The 18-month subcontract clearly did not provide for bids
for software licenses, alone, which the Air Force could accept or reject; nor could Defendants
point to any evidence in Integral’s public disclosures to support such an assertion.
Second, Defendants’ sudden reliance on SOP 81-1’s segmenting rules is disingenuous:
Integral’s stated contract revenue policies contain no reference to “segmenting” of long-term
contracts or any explanation of SOP 81-1, ¶ 40’s prerequisites for segmentation.
Third, no matter what type of contract GPS OCX is,8 all of Integral’s stated policies
concerning contract revenue did not permit the Company to recognize prepaid amounts as earned
revenue simply because software licenses were delivered “up front.” In particular, the “contract
revenue” policy states that revenue on fixed-fee contracts is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis, predicated upon the ratio of costs incurred to total costs. Similarly, revenues
on cost-plus-fee contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred, with the fee recognized
on a pro rata basis. None of Defendants’ press releases or public filings concerning the GPS
OCX contract made any reference to the $2.4 million as having been recognized as either a
percentage of overall costs (fixed-fee) or a cost incurred under the contract (cost-plus-fee) –
either at the time of the original decision to recognize the revenue, nor in the subsequent
iterations of the reasons Integral restated. Thus, if Defendants had, in fact, secretly applied SOP
81-1, ¶ 39 to calculate Q1’08 revenue, at some point – in the many explanations of the
transaction given between December 2008 and May 2009 – there necessarily would have been a

8

At different times, Defendants inexplicably described GPS OCX as a fixed-fee contract
(where the amount of payment does not depend on the amount of resources or time expended), a
cost-plus contract (intended to reimburse all costs and some amount of profit), and a combined
sale of software and services. (Compl. ¶ 61(c)(iv).)

- 15 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 23 of 49

connection made between the revenues recognized and the costs associated with the purported
software license “segment” of the contract. No such explanation was ever given.
Fourth, even if the 18-month subcontract is characterized as a “software and services”
sale, immediate recognition of the license revenue violated Integral’s own accounting policy.
Under the contract, Integral was required to perform a systems-requirement analysis and to
develop both a preliminary systems design and an OCX system to work with existing satellites.
Clearly, this was not a “software only” sale. As set forth above, Integral’s policy was straightforward: “In situations where software is sold together with services and/or hardware, we
recognize software license revenue on a percentage of completion basis.” (Def. Ex. B, Form 10Q, filed Feb. 7, 2008). Consequently, Bambarger explained to the SEC on February 12, 2009:
“The Company improperly recognized upfront license fee revenue of $2.4 million. Through its
Restatement, the Company applied percentage-of-completion accounting under SOP 81-1 for the
entire contract, which resulted in the deferral of $1.3 million of revenue initially recognized.”
(Compl. ¶ 63.)9

9

Defendants’ dissection of SOP 97-2’s provisions is a red herring. (See Def. Mem. at 13.)
While revenue may be recognized under certain circumstances – persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured (SOP 97-2, ¶ 8) – when significant production, modification
and customization of computer software is not required, no judgment call on that issue was
needed here. Integral’s revenue recognition policy drew a clear line, which applied SOP 97-2, ¶
8, exclusively to “software only” sales. Whenever services and/or hardware were also included
as additional elements to be delivered under a contract, Integral predetermined that production,
modification and/or customization of the software element was sufficient to trigger percentageof-completion accounting. (Cf. Compl. ¶ 145 (SOP 97-2, ¶ 13, provides that “delivery” of one
element, for the purposes of ¶ 8, does not occur if undelivered elements are essential to its
functionality).)

- 16 -

Filed 11/30/09 Page 24 of 49

Fifth, and finally, the correct approach to revenue recognition was so obvious that
Integral stated, in its Q1’08 earnings release, that it had “previously anticipated” recognizing the
GPS OCX license revenue throughout the entire year. (Id. at ¶ 45; see also id. at ¶ 48 (revenue
was recognized earlier than “originally planned”).)10 Under GAAP, a public company may not
“manage” earnings – it must recognize revenues in the quarter in which they are earned. Thus,
when a company prepares its revenue forecasts, it does so mindful of GAAP and its own
policies. Defendants were well aware of the correct accounting for the GPS OCX contract.
ii.

RAIDRS

Integral improperly recognized as revenue in Q2’08 a reimbursement payment of $5.1
million for a deposit Integral paid to purchase antennas to be delivered and installed in 2009.
Defendants employed percentage-of-completion (ratio of costs incurred to total costs) accounting
rules to this contract. In this method of accounting, revenue is recognized as work on a contract
progresses – allowing for ratable recognition of corresponding revenue and profits during the
course of the project, rather than waiting until project completion – based upon the costs incurred
in providing the services required under the contract. Generally, revenue is recognized in the
same proportion as costs incurred to date compared to expected costs to complete the contract.
However, specific rules also apply to ensure the percentage of costs incurred and revenues
accordingly recognized do not misrepresent the actual progress of project completion.
One such rule, SOP 81-1, ¶ 50, expressly applies to the monies received on the RAIDRS
contract: The cost of “expensive components to be installed into the deliverable items . . . should
not be included in the [percentage-of-completion] measurement before the components are
10

Bambarger later indicated the revenue was planned to be recorded over the life of the 18month contract. (Compl. ¶ 75.)

- 17 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 25 of 49

installed if inclusion would tend to overstate the percentage of completion otherwise
determinable.”11 Whereas the RAIDRS contract was valued at $21 million and the equipment on
which the $5.1 million deposit was paid was not due to be installed for another year, Defendants
initially recognized revenue prematurely upon receipt of the deposit.12 Specifically, under SOP
81-1, ¶ 50, revenue recognition was improper because it would appear as if nearly 25% of the
project was completed at that point – when it was not. On restatement, citing SOP 81-1, ¶ 50,
Bambarger thus explained to the SEC (Compl. ¶ 91):
The Company made large dollar advance purchases of equipment . . . [and] incorrectly
included [them] in its progress towards completion calculations . . . and overstated the
percentage of completion . . . In accordance with paragraph 50 of SOP 81-1, the
Company removed the advance purchases . . . result[ing] in a net deferral of $7.0 million
in contract revenue. 13
To avoid the inference arising from their “obvious” violation of the simple, straightforward rule set forth in SOP 81-1, ¶ 50 – the uninstalled antennas should have been excluded
from the percentage-of-completion measurement – Defendants located an obscure provision,

11

The entire provision, quoted in ¶ 30 of the Complaint, uses the words “in some
circumstances.” While Defendants leap on these words as a basis to recognize the revenue, (Def.
Mem. at 14), the “circumstances” in which the costs should not be included are those where
doing so would “overstate” the percentage-of-completion ratio. On restatement, Defendants
admitted that their improper inclusion of the antennas deposit did precisely that. (Compl. ¶ 91.)
12

The total amount ultimately deferred due to this accounting error was $6.3 million.
(Compl. ¶ 29.) This amount either represented a second deposit reimbursement in Q3’08 or that
portion of the negotiated fee which was also prematurely recognized on this cost-plus contract.

13

Revenues prematurely recognized on advance equipment purchases on a commercial
project were also reversed in the Restatement – for the same reasons given with respect to the
RAIDRS project, to wit, failure to apply SOP 81-1, ¶ 50. With respect to that contract,
Defendants also admitted that the earning process was contractually tied to performance
milestones and revenue should not have been recognized until the equipment was used in the
project. (Compl. ¶ 88(e).) The total amount of revenues deferred on both projects was $7
million.

- 18 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 26 of 49

which they refer to as Contract Accounting Co5, to try to argue that their initial revenue
recognition determination was viable. Due to the lack of risk of non-payment on government
contracts, Co5 provides that on a cost-plus contract, “[o]rdinarily, it is acceptable to accrue the
fees as they come billable.” (Def. Mem. at 14.) Thus, Defendants desperately suggest that Co5
provides authority for the immediate recognition of the antenna downpayment reimbursement.
(Id.) However, Co5 deals with revenue recognition of the fee portion of a cost-plus-fee contract.
Here, the $5.1 million at issue was not a fee but an equipment cost.

(See Compl. ¶ 74

(Bambarger: “we did accelerate some contractor cost at the request of the customer and that has
an effect on revenue and project cost almost equal”).)

Co5 does not provide cover for

Defendants’ obvious GAAP violation.14
Next, in keeping with their theme that scienter is absent because applicable GAAP was
“difficult to interpret” (Def. Mem. at 2), Defendants ask the Court to believe that it was not until
Ernst & Young brought “its greater resources, knowledge and own views” (id. at 8) to the yearend audit, that Integral was able to figure out that the equipment at issue – for which only a
deposit was paid and would not be delivered until 2009 – had not yet been installed in early
2008. (Id. at 14.) The Court need not indulge such implausible suggestions.
iii.

Post-Contract Services (Warranty) Revenue

During each quarter of the Restatement Period, on fixed-price contracts where Integral
provided both software and services, the Company failed to properly recognize revenue for postcontract services (“PCS”) across the warranty period. Instead, Integral prematurely recognized
14

Indeed, with respect to recognition of the fee component, Co5, ¶ 104, urges government
contractors to use principles of “conservatism” – and to apply the “usual rule [of accrual] of
deliveries or percentage of completion” – to “safeguard against too early proportionate
payment.” (Def. Ex. S.)

- 19 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 27 of 49

total revenue under the contract, including $1.9 million in warranty revenue, upon contract
completion, rather than waiting until such revenues were sufficiently earned across the postcontract warranty period. However, applicable GAAP, in particular FASCON 5, ¶ 83, and
various provisions cited in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (“SAB”) 101, generally prohibit
the recognition of revenues not yet earned because one has not yet performed the services for
which the monies are paid. (See Compl. ¶¶ 142-43 (quoting provisions in full).) A specific
provision, EITF 00-21, requires the severance of post-contract services that have independent
objective value to the customer from the remainder of the contract, with revenues on the former
to be recognized over the warranty period and the latter on a percentage-of-completion basis.
Powerful evidence that Integral knew the proper GAAP to apply is set forth right in its
critical accounting policies, quoted above. Because Integral also sold maintenance services
separately, its stated policy for such services was, in accordance with GAAP, to recognize
revenue on a straight-line, basis pro rata over the contract period, i.e., ratably recognized in equal
amounts as the services are provided and the revenue is earned. Integral knew it could not
recognize separately-sold service revenue upon contract execution, for example, because it was
not yet earned until such time as the service period expired. Yet Integral made the obvious error
of prematurely recognizing this type of revenue because it also provided other services and
software under the same contract.15

15

Yet again, Defendants ask the Court to believe the Restatement was occasioned by a
judgment call under SOP 97-2 as to whether the software component was “incidental” to the
sale. (Def. Mem. at 15.) Not so. The explanation of the error ultimately provided to the SEC
stated that Integral “improperly accounted for the PCS-related services element within its
percentage of completion calculation” – even though it had “vendor specific objective of the fair
value of the PCS-related services” (because they were also sold separately) – rather than properly

“Software Only” Sales Revenue

Certain off-the-shelf software was sold by two Integral subsidiaries without significant
production, modification or customization.

Thus, pursuant to Integral’s stated policy for

software only sales, each of the four elements of SOP 97-2, ¶ 8’s four-part test needed to be met
before revenue could be recognized, to wit: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably
assured.

Inexplicably, Defendants applied percentage-of-completion accounting to certain

software only sales rather than waiting until either customer acceptance (pursuant to contract) or
delivery of the software. Almost $300,000 was prematurely recognized due to this blatant
violation of both GAAP and Integral’s stated policy. (Compl. ¶¶ 34-35.)
Yet again Defendants claim that the “intricacies of SOP 97-2” were called into play to
make a judgment as to whether “significant customization” was required. (Def. Mem. at 16.)
This is a ruse. Typically, when this question is being asked on restatement, it is because revenue
recognition needs to be deferred until the period(s) during which the customization is provided or
accelerated because no such customization was necessary. Here, the Restatement determined
that revenue needed to be deferred even though there was no significant customization required.
Thus, it is clear that “customization” is being used as a pretext: Integral made “software only”
sales and, as Defendants admit (Def. Mem. at 16), failed to wait until delivery to recognize the
revenue. This is an obvious violation of GAAP and the Company’s stated policy.16

“deferring and recognizing revenue for the PCS-related services over the service period.”
(Compl. ¶¶ 33, 138).
16

Defendants claim that Integral’s policy was incorrect and that the error was not obvious
because Bernstein & Pinchuk failed to notice it and instead gave Integral a “clean” audit opinion.
(Def. Mem. at 31.) This is not the case. Integral’s policy expressly adopts SOP 97-2, ¶ 8’s four- 21 -

In Addition to the Obvious Nature of the Revenue Recognition
Errors, Other Indicia of Scienter Are Present

While violations of GAAP may be indicative of a violation of Section 10(b), they are not
determinative. Baan, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 14. Other facts and circumstances which surround
GAAP errors contribute to a finding of scienter. Courts have found the following circumstances,
present here, to support a finding of scienter.
i.

Violation of a Company’s Own Revenue Recognition
Policy

Because a corporation and its executive officers are presumed to have knowledge of the
corporation’s own policies, their transgression “evidences knowing or reckless behavior.”
Chalverus v. Pegasystems, Inc. 59 F. Supp. 2d 226, 234 (D. Mass. 1999). Thus, violations of a
company’s own revenue recognition policies support an inference of scienter. Provenz v. Miller,
102 F.3d 1478, 1490 (9th Cir. 1996); In re Ravisent Techs., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 00-CV-1014,
2004 WL 1563024, at *9 (E.D. Pa. July 13, 2004); MicroStrategy, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 638;
Chalverus, 59 F. Supp. 2d 226, 234. Here, as set forth above, with respect to the GPS OCX and
RAIDRS contracts and off-the-shelf software only sales, Defendants violated Integral’s own
revenue recognition policies.
ii.

Violations of GAAP/Company Policy as to a Small
Number of Large Sales

Where the number of sales at issue is small in number yet represents a large portion of
earnings, defendants are presumed to have greater awareness of them. Consequently, violations

part test. By recognizing revenue before delivery, Integral failed to comply with its stated
policy. For this reason, a claim of good faith reliance on accountants, e.g., under SEC v. Caserta,
75 F. Supp. 2d 79, 94 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), is not available here. In re Winstar Commc’ns., Nos. 01CV-3014, 01-CV-11522, 2006 WL 473885 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2006) (so holding).

of company accounting policies and/or GAAP as to such highly significant transactions are
indicative of scienter. Ravisent, 2004 WL 1563024 at *9 (premature recognition of even one
contract would grossly overstate results of operations due to company’s limited number of
customers); Raytheon, 157 F. Supp. 2d at 148 (majority of irregularities related to defendant’s
seven largest contracts); MicroStrategy, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 638-39 (premature revenue
recognition on three contracts, representing 50% of third quarter revenue and 25% of fourth
quarter revenue). In fact, the MicroStrategy court remarked that “problems with a transaction
with a major impact on revenues . . . support a strong evidence of scienter,” and that it “strain[s]
credulity” to conclude otherwise. Id. at 639, 657.
Here, Defendants repeatedly credited the GPS OCX and RAIDRS contracts – in
particular, the GPS OCX license revenues – for Integral’s increased gross profits and revenues in
the Restatement Period. (See Compl. ¶¶ 45, 46, 50, 71, 73, 79, 80, 99, 101.) An inference of
scienter is thus raised by the fact that in Q1’08 and Q2’08, these key contracts were the primary
cause of revenue overstatements of 10% and 19%, respectively, and net income overstatements
of 39% and 30%, respectively. (Compl. ¶¶ 61(a), 88(a).)
Defendants instead focus upon the purported minor impact on the results for all of fiscal
2008 – a $10 million revenue reduction (6%) and a $3 million (5%) reduction in gross profits.
(Def. Mem. at 25 n.4.) However, assessing the overall impact for fiscal 2008 intentionally masks
the more striking effect on individual restated quarters – something which Defendants may not
do. Batwin v. Occam Networks, Inc., No. CV-07-2750, 2008 WL 2676364, at *13 (C.D. Cal.
July 1, 2008) (4% overall revenue reduction ignores that individual quarters were off by 30% and
40%). Additionally, the Fourth Circuit warned that “courts should be wary when defendants

- 23 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 31 of 49

focus on the size of revenues in an effort to minimize the materiality of misstatements of
income.” BearingPoint, 576 F.3d at 184-85 (citing Crowell v. Ionics, Inc., 343 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18
(D. Mass. 2004) (the “focus on revenue” is “an old chestnut that securities fraud defendants
frequently try on judges and juries”)).17
Defendants also argue that the revenue was eventually recognized, primarily in 2009.
(Def. Mem. at 16.) This argument was rejected in Occam, 2008 WL 2676364, at *13. With
good reason: investors are owed the truth every day and are guaranteed quarterly financial
reporting which includes management’s certification as to its accuracy. Integral’s investors were
not required to hold their shares until all of the misreported revenues were eventually earned
such that Defendants could finally proclaim “no harm, no foul.”
iii.

Defendants Made a Conscious Choice to Prematurely
Recognize Revenue

Certain GAAP violations are more indicative of scienter than others: While “the failure
to detect an inaccuracy” “could easily be inadvertent,” “violations involving the premature or
inappropriate recognition of revenue suggest a conscious choice to recognize revenue in a
manner alleged to be improper, and may therefore support a stronger inference of scienter.”
Baan, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 21.18

17

In fact, the two cases cited by Defendants had minimal bottom line impacts. See In re
Dell Inc. Sec. Litig., 591 F. Supp. 2d 877, 894-95 (W.D. Tex. 2008) (net income was reduced
less than 1%); In re Allscripts, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 00 C 6796, 2001 WL 743411, at *10 (N.D.
Ill. June 29, 2001) (loss increased only 2%).
18

Several cases cited by Defendants are distinguishable on this very basis. See Hanger
Orthopedic, 353 F.3d at 350-51 (failure to discover verbal revenue recognition policies of
acquired company until six months after merger); In re Comshare, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 542,
546 (6th Cir. 1999) (side letters issued by foreign subsidiary affected revenue recognition).

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 32 of 49

Here, as explained above, Defendants (save for Higginbotham), had prepared forecasts
containing an expectation to recognize revenue on the GPS OCX contract over the course of the
contract.

As both Integral’s press release and Bambarger (during a conference call with

investors) explained, the decision to immediately record the revenue came as a result of the
negotiation of “favorable contract terms” which resulted in upfront delivery of the software
licenses. Clearly, Defendants sought a way to accelerate GPS OCX revenue recognition. They
were aware of their actions – and how those actions would affect the financial statements.
With respect to the RAIDRS contract, Bambarger indicated that the government had
made a specific request to prepay for the antennas that were going to be delivered and installed
in 2009. (Compl. ¶ 74.) Thus, the issue of how to account for this large advance payment – $5.1
million represented more than 11% of initially reported revenues of $44.9 million in Q2’08 (id.
at ¶ 69) – which would not be earned as revenue until the next year, was placed squarely before
Defendants. (Indeed, Bambarger described this transaction as the only “major significant event
that would be out of the ordinary” in Q2’08. (Id. at ¶ 74.) In light of the admittedly unique
nature of the transaction, Defendants either chose to recognize revenue prematurely or were
reckless in not ensuring it was recorded in compliance with GAAP. Cf. Baan, 103 F. Supp. 2d at
22 (inference of scienter arises when defendant is quoted in an article – as was Baldwin here,
(Compl. ¶ 3), discussing compliance).

The Policy Violated Was Simple to Understand and
Apply

As opposed to cases where complex19 or cutting edge20 accounting issues are presented,
the premature recognition of revenue in violation of well-established, simple rules gives rise to a
strong inference of scienter. As explained in MicroStrategy, what such rules boil down to is
compliance with the old adage, “don’t count your chickens before they hatch.” 115 F. Supp. 2d
at 638. Here, this occurred on several items. Regarding the RAIDRS contract, SOP 81-1, ¶ 50,
plainly states not to include expensive equipment in the percentage-of-completion calculation if
it is not yet installed; Defendants admitted they violated this rule.21 (Compl. ¶ 91.) On the GPS
OCX contract, Integral’s simple stated rule was, in accordance with SOP 81-1, to employ
percentage-of-completion accounting in all instances where services and/or hardware were sold
in addition to software; Defendants admitted they violated this rule. (Id. at ¶ 64.) With respect
to off-the-shelf “software only” sales, the simple rule stated in Integral’s policy is not to
recognize revenue before delivery; Defendants admitted they violated this rule. (Def. Mem. at
16.)22
19

Merzin v. Provident Financial Group, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 674, 676 (S.D. Ohio 2004),
(Def. Mem. at 31-32), involved errors in a financial model created to predict income and
expenses on nine auto lease securitization transactions; defendant’s outside auditor changed
positions, reclassifying off-balance sheet operating leases as on-balance sheet direct finance
leases. Id. at 682 n.2. Unlike here (with the exception of the PCS services policy), a
disagreement later arose between two auditors. Id. at 682-83 & n.2. Here, three quarters of
unaudited financial statements misapplied revenue recognition policies in place since Ernst &
Young’s last tenure; the financial statements for 2006 and 2007, audited by Bernstein & Pinchuk,
were not restated.
20

Inexplicably, Defendants devote several paragraphs trying to unfavorably compare this
case to In re E.spire Commc’ns, Inc. Sec. Litig., 127 F. Supp. 2d 734 (D. Md. 2001), arguing,
with respect to the GAAP violation, that scienter cannot arise where reading the GAAP rule is
not sufficient to determine the proper accounting. (Def. Mem. at 32-33.) However, E.spire
involved accounting for a new animal, “indefeasible rights of use” (“IRUs”) – long-term leases
- 26 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Regarding the fourth category, citing Beaver County Ret. Bd. v. LCA-Vision Inc., No.
1:07-CV-750, 2009 WL 806714 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 25, 2009), Defendants argue that a simple rule
regarding recognition of warranty revenue may be difficult to apply, thereby failing to give rise
to an inference of scienter. The policy applied in LCA with respect to lifetime warranty revenue
on Lasik eye surgery was that it was to be initially deferred and recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the warranty, unless LCA’s prior experience dictated otherwise. Id. at *19.
Because both the rule and the underlying commitment (a lifetime warranty on a surgical
of portions of a telecommunications company’s fiber optic network – and brand new GAAP
concerning the passage of title under such arrangements. E.spire, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 738. As
both the complex lease provisions and applicable GAAP were new and evolving, E.spire bears
no resemblance to a case where the applicable GAAP provisions were authored in 1981 (SOP
81-1) and 1997 (SOP 97-2).
21

Shockingly, Defendants argue that application of this rule was not simple because it is
fact-intensive. (Def. Mem. at 30.) It is almost comical for Defendants to compare the very basic
fact of whether a yet-to-be-delivered, multi-million dollar piece of equipment was or was not yet
installed with facts in the cases cited. See In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Sec. Litig., 312 F. Supp. 2d
549, 567 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (proper revenue recognition would require knowledge of a customer’s
carrying costs); In re Galileo Corp. Shareholders Litig., 127 F. Supp. 2d 251, 265 (D. Mass.
2001) (in a case where there was no restatement, the question of whether there is a lack of
reasonable assurance of collection is a judgment call based upon knowledge of customer’s
finances). In E.spire, not only did the court find the underlying contracts to be complicated
concerning the issue of title transfer, but the transactions at issue took place during the year in
which the new GAAP pronouncement, FIN 43, was enacted. 127 F. Supp. 2d at 746-47.
22

Defendants even suggest that scienter must be negated due to purported complexity
because they incorrectly applied the same basic rule on two separate occasions. (Def. Mem. at
30-31.) To reach this conclusion, however, would be to reward Defendants simply because they
blatantly utilized the wrong accounting treatment twice – an approach that is at odds with the
underlying facts. By recognizing revenue on delivery of licenses on the GPS-OCX contract,
Defendants violated Integral’s stated policy, which predetermined that significant customization,
production or modification would occur where software was sold with services and/or hardware,
requiring percentage-of-completion accounting. On off-the-shelf sales, Defendants violated the
same stated policy, to wit, where significant customization does not occur, revenue is not
recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, but must await delivery. Also, while the results
were wrong both times, they did not go in opposite directions – both resulted in premature
revenue recognition.

procedure) was more complicated than Integral’s stated straight-line policy (which covered
warranties no longer than 360 days), so was the application: the error made by LCA was in
measuring the amount of deferred revenues it could recognize over certain time periods. Id.
Here, in contrast, Defendants deferred none of the warranty revenue, recognizing all of it before
it was earned, before the commencement of the warranty period.23

A Misleading Description of the Reasons for a
Restatement Gives Rise to an Inference of Scienter

The description of the reasons for the Restatement given on December 11, 2008, was
vague and only included three of the four categories of errors. A fourth category of error was
included in the Form 10-K, two weeks later, along with an admission of material weaknesses in
internal controls over Integral’s revenue recognition process. (Compl. ¶¶ 5(a)&(b), 134.) The
SEC did not deem these explanations sufficient, however, and grilled Integral on a number of
issues, inter alia, the dollar amounts of each error type and when the revenues were expected to
be earned. On February 12, 2009, Integral responded to these questions, explaining the GAAP

23

Defendants try to get mileage from the fact that their stated PCS revenue recognition rule
– which violated GAAP and needed to be changed – was publicly disclosed. (Def. Mem. at 15,
34.) However, in In re Paincare Holdings Sec. Litig., No. 6:06-cv-362, 2007 WL 1229703, at *7
n.8 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2007), scienter was negated because the incorrect policy also resulted in
understatements of net income, a fact not present here. Also, the fact that Bernstein & Pinchuk
gave Integral a clean audit opinion despite the fact that its PCS services revenue policy was not
in compliance with GAAP is not dispositive of liability. See In re LDK Solar Sec. Litig., 584 F.
Supp. 2d 1230 (N.D. Cal. 2008); Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., No. 98-6879, 2000 WL 1140306, at
*6 (S.D. Fla. July 31, 2000); Marksman Partners, L.P. v. Chantal Pharm. Corp., 927 F. Supp.

Baker, 166 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1376-80 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (dismissing auditors but not corporation
and officers). This is especially true, where, as here, the audited financial statements for 2006 and
2007 were not restated.

provisions applied in the Restatement.24 (Id. at ¶ 5(c).) Only after the SEC urged Integral to
share these details with investors did Integral include them in a public filing, the Q2’09 Form 10Q, filed five months after the Restatement was first announced. Even that filing contained new
details not previously shared with the SEC. (Id. at ¶¶ 5(e), 64, 92.)
The slow dribbling out of the truth, which, when viewed in light of the information
finally provided in May 2009, demonstrates the blatant nature of the accounting errors, smacks
of a cover-up. “[C]ommon sense dictates that actions taken after the fraud occurred can be
circumstantial evidence that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind.” SEC v. Lucent
Techs., Inc., 363 F. Supp. 2d 708, 717 (D.N.J. 2005) (cover ups are indicative of scienter).

Defendants’ False Sarbanes-Oxley Act Certifications Give Rise to a
Strong Inference of Scienter

“[T]he affixing of a signature is not a mere formality, but rather signifies that the signer
has read the document and attests to its accuracy.” Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc., 228 F.3d 1057,
1061 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Thus, in promulgating the certification rules mandated
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), the SEC warned that “[a]n officer providing a false
certification potentially could be subject to . . . both Commission and private actions for violating
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.” SEC Release No. 8124, RIN
3235-AI54, 2002 WL 31720215, at *9 (Aug. 28, 2002). Here, Baldwin, Higginbotham and
Bambarger executed the company’s SOX certifications for the first three quarters of 2008,
certifying that they inter alia, designed internal controls over Integral’s financial reporting to
“provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
24

Bambarger’s February 12, 2009 letter to the SEC did not state that Integral erroneously
applied SOP 81-1, ¶39, or Accounting Standard Co5 in its initial accounting for these
transactions – underscoring that these provisions were recently located, solely for this motion.

of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.” These Defendants also certified that they disclosed all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses which are “reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information.”
In the Form 10-K filed two weeks after the end of the Class Period, however, Defendants
admitted that during the Restatement Period, Integral had material weaknesses over its internal
controls with respect to (i) recognizing revenue in compliance with its stated policies;25 (ii)
recognizing revenues in proper periods in accordance with “appropriate measures of progress
towards completion”; (Compl. ¶ 134.)26 and (iii) properly allocating revenues to delivered and
undelivered elements in a multiple-element revenue arrangements.27 Defendants also admitted
that Integral did not have “an adequate level of skilled accounting resources,” specifically,
“accounting personnel with an adequate level of knowledge and experience.” (Compl. ¶ 134.)
Moreover, Integral expressly admitted that these deficiencies caused the material revenue
misstatements. (Id.)
Because of the increased level of oversight over financial reporting that management is
expected to undertake and affirmatively guaranty, courts have held that the execution of false
SOX certifications are a factor in determining whether, taken collectively, a complaint’s scienter
25

This refers to the off-the-shelf sales – clearly covered by SOP 97-2’s four-part test set
forth in Integral’s stated policy – and the GPS OCX contract. As to the latter, the admission that
stated policies were not followed yet again emphasizes the disingenuous nature of Defendants
now trotting out SOP 81-1, ¶ 39, and claiming that Integral thought it properly recognized all of
the license revenue in Q1’08 by “segmenting” the contract.
26

This refers to Integral’s failure to apply SOP 81-1, ¶ 50, to the advance equipment
purchase reimbursements on the RAIDRS contract and the smaller commercial contract.
27

This refers to the premature recognition of warranty revenue before the running of 30-,
60- and 360-day warranty periods.

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

allegations give rise to a strong inference of scienter. Backe v. Novatel Wireless, Inc., 607 F.
Supp. 2d 1145, 1163 (S.D. Cal. 2009) (relevant factor); Croker v. Carrier Access Corp., No. 051011, 2006 WL 2038011, at *11 (D. Colo. July 18, 2006) (a factor to be considered “in the totality
of the circumstances”). Defendants argue, unconvincingly, that there are no specific allegations of
“red flags” indicating that they should have known about the admitted deficiencies when they
executed the certifications.

(Def. Mem. at 23-24.)

To the contrary, under the unique

circumstances of this case, the false SOX certifications were recklessly executed, giving rise to
liability.
First, the SOX certifications were executed in 2008, long after former officer Gary Prince
was terminated in the wake of the SEC’s formal investigation into his role at Integral,
specifically, whether he was acting as an accountant on Integral’s behalf before the SEC.
Integral’s 2007 Form 10-K indicated that the Company was cooperating with the investigation,
including responding to the SEC’s subpoena. (Def. Ex. A at 21.) In light of the high-profile
nature of this investigation of Integral and several of its former officers, Defendants were aware
of Prince’s importance to the Company. (Compl. ¶¶ 36-37 (2009 consent decree stated that
Prince “trained and supported the inexperienced CFOs who succeeded him. . . . suggested how
accounting entries should be handled. . . . prepared quarterly financial forecasts. . . . drafted the
MD&A section of periodic filings . . . reviewed and edited the entirety of each filed periodic
report.”).)28

28

Defendants appear to rely upon the facts that Prince was a discredited felon and that he
left the year before the Class Period began to negate scienter. (Def. Mem. at 24.) To the
contrary, despite his status as a felon, Integral was totally dependent upon Prince to be an
accounting jack-of-all-trades for the Company – even hiding his role for years so that he could
- 31 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 39 of 49

Second, Defendants suggest that the allegation that Prince alerted them to incorrect
revenue recognition by early 2008 was too vague to be credible as a “red flag” that there were
possible internal control problems. (Def. Mem. at 24 (putting words in quotation marks to
suggest that the allegation is trumped up).) However, the transcript of the December 11, 2008,
conference call submitted in support of Defendants’ motion demonstrates that former director
Bonnie Wachtel stated she had received an e-mail from Prince telling her that Integral was not
listening to him when he warned Defendants (save for Higginbotham) that revenue recognition
“over the quarters” was not being properly recorded. In December 2008, she recounted raising
this issue during the February 2008 shareholders meeting. (Def. Ex. F at 14.) 29
Third, in light of the Company’s complete reliance on Prince for these very types of
determinations for so many years, Defendants specifically acknowledged in Class Period
conference calls with investors (during which both Baldwin and Bambarger spoke) that Integral
had needed to hire key senior accounting personnel – and that they had done so in Q1’08 and
Q2’08. (Compl. ¶¶ 49, 76 (“we’ve been beefing up or busy building the staff in terms of . . .
finance and accounting . . . [s]o there has been a lot of very talented people that have been
continue doing it. The lack of competent accounting personnel that followed in the wake of his
termination was admittedly still a problem during and after the Class Period.
29

To refute this red flag, Defendants may point to Wachtel’s statement that she was assured
(in February 2008) that the outside auditors approved of the accounting at issue. Def. Ex. F at
14. However, Defendants cannot shield themselves from liability by claiming that they relied
upon Bernstein & Pinchuk’s advice. See In re New Century, 588 F. Supp. 2d 1206, 1231 (C.D.
Cal. 2008) (in finding plaintiffs pled a strong inference of scienter “the fact that the [company’s]
independent auditor may have approved the accounting methods will not shield [the officers] from
liability for deception such methods may have caused” (citing Marksman Partners, 927 F. Supp. at
1297)). Moreover, Defendants cannot specifically point to a clean audit opinion on the original
accounting treatment for the restated items, id., as the restated quarters were not the subjects of
formal audit opinions. In any event, as explained in n.23, above, when a company’s own
accounting policy is violated, good faith reliance on outside auditors is not an available defense.

- 32 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

added.”).) In light of these facts, Defendants (save for Lee-Gallagher) recklessly executed the
SOX certifications for each of the restated quarters.30
Defendants weakly assert that scienter for their false SOX certifications is negated
because the Company was in a period of “transition” (Def. Mem. at 34-35), with several
defendants relatively new to the Company and/or their positions during the Class Period.31 Not
only were Defendants keenly aware of the accounting deficiencies Integral faced when they took
their positions (because of the Prince investigation), but Baldwin touted his expertise in the area
of SEC reporting compliance. Defendants were highly paid executives who are supposed to be
competent in their roles as stewards over the financial reporting of a public company; affording
them immunity because they were just getting started would set a very dangerous precedent.

30

Defendants may try to argue on reply, as have others, that an admission of material
weakness, indicating that prior SOX certifications were false, adds nothing to plaintiffs’
allegations because restatements are routinely accompanied by such mea culpas. Not so. A
study by former SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner of restatements filed in 2005 revealed that
only one half of them also contained admissions of material weaknesses. (Friedman Decl. Ex. 5.,

Behind the Trend, The CPA Journal (Dec. 2006), at 5.) In light of the fact that the SOX
certifications are supposed to report conditions which might result in accounting errors, “there
should be more companies reporting material weaknesses than restating.” (Id. at 2.) But the
authors found the reverse to be true – leading them to conclude that “it appears the auditors may
have been cutting companies some slack.” (Id.)
31

The weakness of the “in transition” argument is demonstrated by its lackluster support –
the citation of only two cases following the signal “Cf.” The facts of both cases bear little
resemblance to the instant action. BearingPoint, involved the malfunction of a new billing
system while the company was trying to integrate 30 worldwide acquisitions and thousands of
employees. 576 F.3d at 188. In In re Gildan Activewear, Inc. Sec. Litig., 636 F. Supp. 2d 261,
273-74 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), plaintiffs alleged that defendants misrepresented that an acquisition had
gone more smoothly than it had, using a loss of customers following abandonment of a business
line as proof. The court noted that there was no evidence of when defendants should have been
aware of the problem – presumably, what Defendants are referring to as a “transition” issue.
Here, the complaint is replete with allegations of what Defendants knew concerning the gaping
holes in Integral’s accounting resources – and when they knew it.

The Complaint Alleges Individual Defendants’ Direct Involvement
with the Specific Contracts and/or Accounting Principles at Issue

Contrary to Defendants’ contention, the Complaint does not merely rely on the Individual
Defendants’ positions within the Company to allege scienter. (Def. Mem. at 21-22.) Rather, the
Complaint details each Individual Defendants’ duties, their direct involvement with the
Company’s day-to-day affairs, and the Individual Defendants’ knowledge of and involvement
with the specific contracts and/or the specific accounting practices at issue, all of which give rise
to a strong inference of scienter. See Latham v. Matthews, Nos 6:08-cv-2995-RHB, 6:08-cv3183-RHB, 2009 WL 3052223, at *21 (D.S.C. Sept. 4, 2009) (finding an inference of scienter
when the complaint alleged that defendants were “personally” or “intimately” involved with the
activities that were the subject of the misleading statements); Ravisent, 2004 WL 1563024, at * 8
(finding scienter where, inter alia, the complaint alleged that individual defendants with strong
accounting backgrounds improperly recognized revenue under the applicable accounting rules).
For example, with regard to Defendant Baldwin, who served as President, CEO, and a director of
Integral during the relevant time, the Complaint alleges:
•

Baldwin boasted in a February 18, 2008 interview with the Washington Post that
he had “a very strong background in accounting and in the public disclosure that’s
required in running a public company;” (Compl. ¶ 3);

•

During two conference calls, Baldwin represented to investors that he and
Defendant Bambarger had added additional key accounting and contract
administration personnel to strengthen the Company’s accounting processes; (id. at
¶¶ 49, 76); and

•

Baldwin personally signed Integral’s periodic reports filed on Form 10-Q on
February 7, 2008, and May 7, 2008, and certified the Company’s financial results,
sound internal controls, and that he was responsible for creating the internal
controls in each of these reports. (Id. at ¶¶ 189, 190).

The allegations relating to Defendant Bambarger – who served as CFO and Treasurer of
Integral during the relevant time period – also do not merely rely on his job description, but
rather indicate his specific involvement in the accounting related to the contracts in question:
•

Bambarger was involved in adding accounting and contract administration
personnel to strengthen the Company’s accounting processes; (id. at ¶¶ 49, 76,
109(h));

•

On February 4, 2008, Bambarger indicated that the Company had initially planned
to recognize revenue from the GPS OCX contract during the entire fiscal year, but
later decided to recognize the revenue up-front; (id. at ¶ 48);

•

On April 28, 2008, Bambarger explained that there was “significant accelerated
revenue” on the GPS OCX contract, which Integral initially had anticipated would
be spread throughout 2008 and 2009 (the period of the contract); (id. at ¶¶ 74-75);

•

On April 28, 2008, Bambarger explained why Integral recorded revenue for the
$5.1 million downpayment reimbursement on the RAIDRS contract; (id. at ¶ 74);

•

Bambarger was responsible for ensuring that Integral properly reported its
financial statements, and personally signed all of Integral’s financial reports,
including the Forms 10-Q filed on February 7, 2008, and May 7, 2008, and August
7, 2008, and certified the Company’s financial results, sound internal controls, and
that he was responsible for creating the internal controls in each of these reports;
(id. at ¶¶ 203-204); and

•

Bambarger authored correspondence with the SEC concerning the Restatement.
(Id. at ¶¶ 5(c)&(d).)

Similarly, the Complaint makes further specific allegations regarding Defendants
Higginbotham and Lee-Gallagher:
•

Higginbotham was CEO, President, and a director of Integral during the relevant
time period and thus was responsible for ensuring that Integral properly reported
its financial statements and the true nature of the Company’s internal controls and
had a duty of oversight that required him to implement reporting or information
systems or controls and review information related to Integral’s operations to be
informed of risks; (id. at ¶ 199);

- 35 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 43 of 49

•

Higginbotham personally signed Integral’s Form 10-Q on August 7, 2008 and
certified the Company’s financial results, sound internal controls, and that he was
responsible for creating the internal controls in that report; (id. at ¶ 198);32

•

Lee-Gallagher was the Controller of the Company during the relevant time period
and thus was responsible for ensuring that Integral properly accounted for the
Company’s revenues; (id. at ¶ 209); and

•

Lee-Gallagher personally signed all the Forms 10-Q filed on February 7, 2008, and
May 7, 2008, and August 7, 2008. (Id. at ¶ 208.)

These allegations of the Individual Defendants’ involvement with the specific contracts
and/or the specific accounting practices at issue give rise to a strong inference of scienter. See
Latham, 2009 WL 3052223, at *21.

Financial Incentives and Insider Sales Create A Strong Inference of
Scienter

Allegations of insider trading contribute to an inference of scienter when the timing and
amount of the trades are “unusual or suspicious.” In re Inspire Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., 515 F.
Supp. 2d 631, 639 (M.D.N.C. 2007) (quoting Teachers’ Ret. Sys. v. Hunter, 477 F.3d 162,
183 (4th Cir. 2007)); Microstrategy, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 643-44. When considering whether the
timing of an insider’s sales is unusual, courts look at the defendant’s history and pattern of stock
sales, as well as whether the sales were made near the high point of the stock’s sales price.
Hunter, 477 F.3d at 184; E.spire, 127 F. Supp. at 743 (comparing trading patterns before class
period with trading patterns during class period).
Here, Baldwin exercised 29,235 options on August 4, 2008, and 25,765 options on
August 5, 2008, thus exercising all of the options that were exercisable during the Class Period.
32

Higginbotham had come to Integral with the goal of “turning around a company he said
had suffered from accounting lapses.” Peter B. de Selding, Satellite Company’s Chief Resigns
Amid Lower Expectations, Space News, August 10, 2009 (http://www.space.com/news/090810busmon-integral-higginbotham.html). (Friedman Decl., Ex. 3.)

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Def. Ex. O. Baldwin immediately sold those shares on the same days that he exercised the
options, thereby selling 100% of his stock holdings during the Class Period. (Compl. ¶ 196;
Def. Ex. O.) The timing of these sales was unusual, because Baldwin had never previously sold
any Integral stock, but then exercised and sold all of his exercisable options within two days,
making these sales out of line with his history of trading. (Id. at ¶ 196.) Additionally, Baldwin
sold all of his shares for over $47 per share, near in both time and price to the Class Period high
of $52.71 per share on August 14, 2008. (Id. at ¶ 3.) The timing of Baldwin’s stock sales is both
unusual and timed to maximize his benefit, giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.
In determining whether the size of an insider’s sale of stock is unusual, courts in this
Circuit and elsewhere compare the number of shares sold to the insider’s total holdings and
exercisable options available. E.spire, 127 F. Supp. at 743; Microstrategy, 115 F. Supp. 2d at
645. Numerous courts have found that sales of all or a significant portion of an insider’s stock
contribute to a strong inference of scienter. No. 84 Employer-Teamster Joint Council Pension
Trust Fund v. Am. W. Holding Corp., 320 F.3d 920, 939 (9th Cir. 2003) (sales of 88-100% of
shares are probative of scienter); Lefkoe v. Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, No. WMN-06-1892, 2009 WL
3003247, at *7 (D. Md. May 1, 2009) (sales of 74% of shares create an inference of scienter); In
re Proquest Sec. Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 728, 743 (E.D. Mich. 2007) (inference of scienter arises
when CEO sold 100% of his stock shortly before retiring and continuing to serve on the board of
directors); In re Focus Enhancements, Inc. Sec. Litig., 309 F. Supp. 2d 134, 163 (D. Mass. 2001)
(sales of 37%, 83%, and 100% of insiders’ stocks create inference of scienter); Microstrategy,
115 F. Supp. 2d at 646 (sales of 56-91% of shares at unusual time probative of scienter); New
England Health Care Employees Pension Fund v. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., No. 1:98-cv-99-M,

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

1999 WL 33295037, at *9 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 16, 1999) (sales of 80-100% of shares probative of
scienter). Here, Baldwin exercised options to sell 100% of the shares available to him during the
Class Period; his actions are highly probative of scienter. (Compl. ¶ 196; Def. Ex. O.)
Defendants’ argument that the timing of Baldwin’s sales near the time that he stepped
down as CEO negates an inference of scienter overlooks the fact that Baldwin remained in a
position of control even after stepping down as CEO. (Def. Mem. at 26-27.) After resigning as
CEO, Baldwin continued to serve as President for an additional five months and as a director
thereafter. (Compl. ¶ 15.) The cases cited by Defendants deal exclusively with insiders who –
unlike Baldwin – left the defendant corporation.33 In contrast, where a defendant remains on as a
director after stepping down from an executive position, heavy stock sales following the office
resignation can be indicative of scienter. Proquest, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 743 (rejecting argument
that sales following resignation from office negated scienter where former CEO continued to
serve on the board of directors).
Higginbotham’s eligibility for bonuses in the form of stock options also contributes to a
strong inference of scienter. Courts around the country have held that eligibility for bonuses in
the form of stock options is indicative of scienter when the determination of an award of a bonus
is based primarily on the company’s financial performance. In re Cardinal Health Inc. Sec.
Litig., 426 F. Supp. 2d 688, 737-38 (S.D. Ohio 2006) (finding an inference of scienter where an
executive’s bonus was related to the defendant’s financial condition); Am. W. Holding, 320 F.3d
at 944 (same). Here, Higginbotham was eligible for annual bonuses of stock options, including

33

See In re K-tel Int’l, Inc. Sec. Litig., 300 F.3d 881, 896 (8th Cir. 2002); Greebel v. FTP
Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 206 (1st Cir. 1999) (no inference of scienter where senior officers
sold within months of leaving the company).
- 38 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

an annual bonus of 50,000 shares that was unique to his employment contract, as well as an
additional bonus of up to 900,000 shares under the Company’s 2008 Stock Incentive Plan.
(Compl. ¶¶ 200-201.) In fact, after only a month on the job, Integral awarded Higginbotham a
bonus of 50,000 options under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. (Id. at ¶ 201.) The potential for
obtaining these bonuses was closely tied to the performance of Integral’s stock, as explained by
the Company: “Stock options are intended to align the interests of the Named Executive
Officers with the interests of stockholders by tying a portion of executive compensation to longterm stock price appreciation.” (Friedman Decl. Ex. 6 at 28 (Proxy Statement, Form 14A, filed
Jan. 21, 2009).) Therefore, the connection between Higginbotham’s bonus potential and the
Company’s stock price is sufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter based on his
motive to keep that price inflated. See Am. W. Holding, 320 F.3d at 944.
Higginbotham’s failure to sell shares held under option during the Class Period does not
negate an inference of scienter because he did not exercise those options. PEC Solutions, 418
F.3d at 389 (an inference of scienter is negated when insiders actually exercise their options but
do not sell shares during the class period). Bambarger’s and Lee-Gallagher’s failure to sell any
stock during the Class Period similarly fails to negate an inference of scienter, as Defendants
claim (Def. Mem. at 27), because neither held any stock during the Class Period.
Defendants’ insistence that they were somehow personally harmed by inflated share
prices during the Class Period – because the price of options granted at that time would also be
inflated – is wholly without merit because they did not actually purchase any stock during the

- 39 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

Filed 11/30/09 Page 47 of 49

Class Period. (See Def. Mem. at 27-28.)34 Thus, unlike class plaintiffs – who actually invested
in Integral during the Class Period – any “harm” to Defendants is purely hypothetical. The fact
remains that Defendants (save for Baldwin) were eligible for bonuses of up to 900,000 options
under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (Compl. ¶¶ 201, 206, 210), which, as explained above,
specifically linked the eligibility for the bonus to the stock price, thus giving them a motive to
maintain an inflated stock price in order to profit from the options granted during the Class
Period, and creating a strong inference of scienter. See Am. W. Holding, 320 F.3d at 944.35
IV.

PLAINTIFFS’ SECTION 20(A) AND 20A CLAIMS ARE ADEQUATELY PLED
A claim for control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act requires

only that Plaintiffs allege a primary violation of the securities laws and control by the
Defendants. Microstrategy, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 661. Plaintiffs have done so. (Compl. ¶¶ 182201.) For a Section 20A claim, Plaintiffs must allege: (i) a primary violation; (ii) that plaintiffs’
purchase of defendant company’s stock was contemporaneous with an insider’s sales of stock;
and, (iii) that damages are available under Section 20A. Id. at 661-62. Plaintiffs so allege. (Id.
at ¶¶ 238-47.) Defendants’ only argument that there is no liability under Sections 20(a) and 20A
is premised on the lack of an underlying 10(b) violation. (Def. Mem. at 35.) As Plaintiffs have

34

The cases cited by Defendants concerned individuals who owned stock but did not sell it
during the class period. See Shuster v. Symmetricom, Inc., 35 Fed. App’x 705, 707 (9th Cir.
2002) (noting that the defendants “actually lost money”); Grillo v. Tempur-Pedic Int’l, Inc., 553
F. Supp. 2d 809, 821-22 (E.D. Ky. 2008) (noting the decline in value in defendants’ holdings).
35

The fact that Higginbotham, Bambarger, and Lee-Gallagher did not sell any stock during
the class period does not negate the strong inference of scienter created by Baldwin’s cash-out of
all his stock. A strong inference of scienter may be sufficiently alleged against all defendants
where one defendant sold a large portion of his stock and others sold none. Lefkoe, No. WMN06-1892, 2007 WL 6890353, at *6 (D. Md. Sept. 10, 2007).

- 40 -

Case 8:08-cv-03387-RWT Document 21

demonstrated above that there is an underlying 10(b) violation, liability is proper under Sections
20(a) and 20A.
V.

CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied in its

entirety.

In the alternative, should the Court find any infirmity in the allegations of the

Complaint, Plaintiffs request leave to amend. See Fed R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The Fourth Circuit
has stated that “leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires” in order to “give[]
effect to the federal policy in favor of resolving cases on their merits instead of disposing of
them on technicalities.” BearingPoint, 576 F.3d at 193 (internal quotations omitted).
