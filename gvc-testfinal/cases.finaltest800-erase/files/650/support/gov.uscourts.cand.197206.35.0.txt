TO DEFENDANT AND CROSS-COMPLAINANT CAROLYN PESTANO AND HER
ATTORNEYS OF RECORD IN THIS ACTION:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on March 6, 2008 at 8:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as
this matter may be heard, in Courtroom 9 of the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, located at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California 94102,
the Honorable William H. Alsup presiding, Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant AT&T Mobility IT
LLC, will and does hereby move this Court for an Order Dismissing the First, Second, Fifth

and Sixth Counterclaims asserted by Carolyn Pestano (`"Pestano"), without leave to amend.

This Motion will be made on the grounds that (1) the First Counterclaim for breach of
the "Settlement and Release Concerning Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 Total Subscriber Base" ("SMF
Release") fails to state a claim because it does not allege a breach of the SMF Release; (2) the
Second Counterclaim for breach of the "AT&T Wireless Exclusive Dealer Agreement" is
expressly barred by the terms of the SMF Release; (3) the Fifth Counterclaim for negligent
misrepresentation fails because Pestano cannot allege justifiable reliance because under the
`Advanced Payment Agreement" and "Cingular Wireless Exclusive Dealer Agreement"
Pestano's alleged assignor, Viva Wireless, Inc. ("Viva") explicitly represented and agreed
that it did not and would not rely upon the types of assertions which Pestano alleges
constitute the alleged negligent misrepresentations; and (4) the Sixth Counterclaim for
"Unfair Competition (0x00A717200)" fails to state a claim because no remedy is available to

Pestano under such claim.

This Motion shall be based upon this Notice of Motion, the attached Memorandum of
Points and Authorities, the Declaration of Marc Miguel; the pleadings and records on file
herein and upon such other matters as may be presented to the Court at the time of the

hearing.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES'
I. INTRODUCTION AND ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant AT&T Mobility H, LLC, ("AT&T Mobility")
respectfully requests this Court to dismiss the First, Second, Fifth and Sixth Counterclaims
asserted by Defendant and Cross-Complainant Carolyn Pestano ("Pestano"), without leave to
amend, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for "failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted."

The First Counterclaim for breach of the "Settlement and Release Concerning
Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 Total Subscriber Base" ("SMF Release") must be dismissed, without
leave to amend, because it does not allege a breach of the SMF Release. See Declaration of
Marc Miguel ("Miguel Decl.") 0x00A7 5, Exh. C.

The Second Counterclaim for breach of the "AT&T Wireless Exclusive Dealer
Agreement" ("Original Dealer Agreement") must be dismissed, without leave to amend,
because it is barred by the express terms of the "release" provisions agreed to by Viva in the
SMF Release. Miguel Decl. 45; Exh. C at section 2.

The Fifth Counterclaim for negligent misrepresentation must be dismissed, without
leave to amend, because Pestano cannot allege justifiable reliance - a necessary element of a
negligent misrepresentation claim. Specifically, under the express provisions of the
"Advanced Payment Agreement" ("APA") and "Cingular Wireless Exclusive Dealer
Agreement" ("Dealer Agreement") Pestano's alleged assignor, Viva Wireless, Inc. ("Viva")
explicitly represented and agreed that it did not and would not rely upon the types of
assertions which Pestano alleges caused Viva to enter into the APA for the purpose of
opening new retail locations. Miguel Decl. {J 4 and 6, Exh. B at section 2.3.6 and 3.1, Exh.

D at sections | and 13.

 

The following portions of this Memorandum of Points and Authorities are the subject

of a concurrently filed motion to seal: page 4 at lines 16-25; page 5 at lines 6-8 and 25-28,
page 6 at lines 1-6 and 10-17; page 7 at lines 12-15, 21-22, and 24-28; and page 8 at lines 1-

Case 3:07-cv-05463-WHA Document35 Filed 02/06/2008 Page 7 of 17

The Sixth Counterclaim asserted by Pestano is a claim for violation of California
Business & Professions Code Section 17200 et. seg. ("Section 17200"). See Counterclaims
at J 60-67. None of the remedies Pestano seeks for the alleged violation of Section 17200
are available. Further, the Sixth Counterclaim cannot be amended to seek either of the two
remedies afforded by Section 17200 - injunctive relief or restitution - because the
Counterclaims complain of past acts that cannot be enjoined and the allegations set forth in
the Counterclaims reveal that neither Pestano, nor Viva gave to AT&T Mobility, money or
property "to which it was not entitled." Day v. AT&T Corporation, 63 Cal. App. 4th 325,
340 (1998); Counterclaims J{ 60-67.

Accordingly, AT&T Mobility respectfully requests that this Court dismiss the First,
Second, Fifth and Sixth Counterclaims without leave to amend.

I. ARGUMENT

A. The Legal Standard.
A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests for legal sufficiency of
the claims alleged in the complaint. A complaint should not be
dismissed "unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove
no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 -- 46
(1957). On the other hand, "conclusory allegations of law and
unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim." Epstein v. Washington Energy Co., 83 F.3d
1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 1996). Dismissal without leave to amend is proper
only if the complaint cannot be cured by amendment. Oki
Semiconductor Co. v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat'l Ass'n, 298 F.3d 768, 772
(9th Cir. 2002).

Ramirez v. United Airlines, Inc., 416 F. Supp. 2d 792, 795 (N.D. Cal. 2005). |

"Ordinarily, a court may look only at the face of the complaint to decide a motion to

dismiss." Van Buskirk v. Cable News Network, Inc., 284 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir. 2003). If,

however, the claims alleged are based upon contracts not attached to the pleadings, the court
may utilize the doctrine of incorporation to consider the contracts upon which the claims are
based. See United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003) ("Even if a document
is not attached to a complaint, it may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the
plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff's
claim."); Van Buskirk, 284 F.3d at 980. Here, this Court may consider the Original Dealer
Agreement, Dealer Agreement, SMF Agreement and APA under the doctrine of
incorporation because these agreements form the basis for each of Pestano's Counterclaims.
B. The First Counterclaim Fails to Allege a Breach of the SMF Release.
The First Counterclaim for breach of the SMF Release must be dismissed because it
fails to allege an actionable breach.
The First Counterclaim alleges that AT&T Mobility breached the SMF Release by
failing to pay Viva "$735,833.44." Counterclaims 0x00A70x00A7 31-32. The SMF Release, however,
does not require AT&T Mobility to pay Viva $735,883.44. Miguel Decl. Exh. C at Section
1. Under the SMF release, Viva was to be paid:
[T]he sum of $22,655.45 each month for 24 months ("Monthly
Payment"). The first Monthly Payment will be in or about March 2006
for the month of February, 2006 and the Monthly Payment will be in
effect under this 2/1/06 SMF Release for 24 consecutive months, or for
as long as the Dealer Agreement is in effect, whichever is shorter.
Dealer will no longer be eligible for this Monthly Payment upon the
termination or expiration of its Dealer Agreement under any
circumstances. In addition to the Monthly Payment, Cingular shall
pay Dealer the one time sum of $192,152.64 (`One Time Payment") not
later than April 30, 2006.

Id. (Emphasis added). Viva admits that it terminated the Dealer Agreement. Counterclaims

0x00A70x00A7 25-27. The Counterclaims fail to allege that AT&T Mobility did not pay Viva the One

Time Payment of $192,152.64 or any of the Monthly Payments while the Dealer Agreement
was operable. See Counterclaims.

As there is no allegation that AT&T Mobility did not pay Viva the One Time Payment
of $192,152.64 or any of the Monthly Payments while the Dealer Agreement was operable,
the Counterclaims admit that Viva terminated the Dealer Agreement (Counterclaims at 27),
and the SMF Release explicitly states "Dealer will no longer be eligible for this Monthly
Payment upon the termination or expiration of its Dealer Agreement under any
circumstances" (Miguel Decl Exh. C at Section 1), there is no basis for the claim that the
SMF Release "required AT&T to pay the Company [Viva] $735,883.44" (Counterclaims at
| 31-32) and thus, no ground for the alleged breach of the SMF Release. Without a breach
of the SMF Release, the First Counterclaim fails and must be dismissed. Reichert v. General
Insurance Co. of America, 68 Cal. 2d 822, 830 (1968) (The elements of a cause of action for
breach of contract are: a valid contract; plaintiff's performance or excuse for non-
performance; defendant's breach; and resulting damage); Golden Eagle Refinery Company,
Inc. v. Associated International Insurance Co., 85 Cal. App. 4th 1300, 1308-1309 (2001).

C. The Second Counterclaim is Barred by the SMF Release.

The Second Counterclaim alleges breach of the Original Dealer Agreement for failure
"to pay [Viva] certain compensation based on subscription revenues for subscribers enrolled
by the Company." Counterclaims 0x00A70x00A7 36-37. This claim is explicitly barred by the terms set
forth in Section 2 ("Release") of the SMF Release. See Miguel Decl. 45, Exh. C at sections
2 and 3.

The SMF Release was entered into by Viva and AT&T Mobility's predecessor,
Cingular Wireless II, LLC, following the acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. See
Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 5, Exh. C. Under the SMF Release, Viva and Cingular Wireless II, LLC:

[A]greed to settle on a value for all SMF [Subscriber Management
Fees] that Dealer [Viva] is or will be able to earn from all subscribers in
both Dealer's Pre-9/1/05 Blue Subscriber Base [Pre-acquisition AWS

subscriber base] and in Dealer's Eligible Subscriber base through and

including January 31, 2006 ("Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 Total Subscriber

Base"). As a result, all Pre-9/1/05 Blue SMF and all SMF for which

Dealer would be eligible under the Dealer Agreement based on all

subscribers Dealer activated through and including January 31, 2006

("Dealer's Total Pre-2/1/06 SMF") are eliminated in exchange for the

monthly payment described below.
Miguel Decl. Exh. C at "Background", 0x00A7 2. In other words, the SMF Release settled all
claims concerning "compensation based on subscription revenues for all subscribers enrolled
by [Viva]" (Counterclaims 0x00A7 36) under the Original Dealer Agreement. Jd.

Section 2 of the SMF Release sets forth the release and states: "Dealer hereby forever
releases, waives and discharges Cingular . . .and any successor. . . from any and all claims or
causes of action known or unknown that Dealer may have, individually or jointly with
another party, including but not limited to claims for attorneys' fees, that are related to
Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 Total Subscriber Base and Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 SMF (including the
former CSAs) under the Dealer Agreement." Miguel Decl. Exh. C, Section 2.

The claim set forth in the Second Counterclaim is a claim "related to Dealer's Pre-
2/1/06 Total Subscriber Base and Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 SMF." /d. and Counterclaims 0x00A7] 36-37.
Accordingly, the Second Counterclaim is barred by the release set forth in the SMF Release
and must be dismissed, without leave to amend.

D. The Fifth Counterclaim is Barred by the APA and Dealer Agreement.

The Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent Representation must be dismissed, without
leave to amend, because it is barred by the express terms of the APA and Dealer Agreement.
See Miguel Decl. 0x00A70x00A7 4 and 6, Exh. B at 2.6.3 and 3.1 and Exh. D at sections | and 13.

"'The elements of fraud, which gives rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of
falsity (or "scienter"); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance;

and (e) resulting damage.' (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638 [49 Cal. Rptr.
