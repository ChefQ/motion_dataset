UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO: 14-61753-CIV-BLOOM/Valle
KRISTIAN E. MIERZWICKI,
Plaintiff,
v.
CITIGROUP INC.,
Defendant.
___________________________________/
DEFENDANT, CITIBANK, N.A.'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S
MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE OF THE TRIAL IN THIS MATTER AND AN
EXTENSION OF TIME OF ALL DEADLINES SET FORTH IN THIS COURT'S
DECEMBER 3, 2014 PRE-TRIAL SCHEDULING ORDER
Defendant, CITIBANK, N.A. ("Citibank"), by and through the undersigned counsel,
hereby files its Response in Opposition to Plaintiff, KRISTIAN E. MIERZWICKI's ("Plaintiff"
or "Mierzwicki") Motion for Continuance of the Trial in this Matter and an Extension of Time of
All Deadlines Set Forth in this Court's December 3, 2014 Pre-Trial Scheduling Order [ECF No.
84] ("Motion"), and states as follows:
1.

This case is about 21 manually-dialed "wrong number" phone calls1 Citibank

made to Plaintiff's cell phone.
2.

Plaintiff is attempting to secure a wind-fall from these wrong number calls by

asserting several, but all equally inapplicable, claims against Citibank under various consumer
protection statutes.2

1

The number of Citibank calls at issue was previously thought to be 28, but investigation has revealed that 21 calls
were completed to Plaintiff's cell phone number.
2

Citibank's Motion to Dismiss or to Strike Second Amended Complaint and for Sanctions [ECF No. 83] is
currently pending.

3.

As this Court has noted previously, Plaintiff has had five attorneys represent him

since this case was initiated. The latest attorney for Plaintiff was retained on July 15, 2015 [ECF
No. 84 at 1].
4.

Since that time, Plaintiff has not sought any discovery. Indeed, the status of

discovery was first raised by Plaintiff's counsel in Plaintiff's Motion, which provides as a
purported basis for a continuance that Citibank has not served written responses to Plaintiff's
discovery requests.
5.

In April 2015, Citibank produced, with the agreement of Plaintiff's prior counsel,

the relevant documents evidencing the subject calls made by Citibank to Plaintiff's cell phone:
dialer records and call notes. Counsel for Plaintiff at the time accepted Citibank's document
production to assist with mediation and settlement negotiations. Plaintiff's counsel indicated
that, because documents were produced and settlement was being pursued, written responses to
discovery were not necessary at that time.
6.

Shortly thereafter in May 2015, the parties reached a tentative settlement but

Plaintiff refused to consummate the agreement and his counsel then withdrew.
7.

Neither Plaintiff, nor his two subsequent attorneys, ever requested written

discovery responses be served by Citibank.
8.

Citibank is prepared to produce written responses and objections to Plaintiff's

discovery, but the fact that same remain outstanding is not grounds to continue the trial,
especially in light of the fact that Citibank produced responsive, relevant documents six months
ago and Plaintiff has not requested an enlargement of discovery deadlines at any time in this case
until now.

9.

The fact that Plaintiff has failed to pursue discovery is consistent with Plaintiff's

handling of this case since its inception.
10.

The Court's Scheduling Order [ECF No. 21] set numerous deadlines which

Plaintiff altogether ignored.
11.

February 2, 2015 was the deadline to amend pleadings and join parties; Plaintiff

attempted to amend his complaint and add additional defendants to this case in late July 2015.
Plaintiff asserted more new claims in his Second Amended Complaint filed on September 9th.3
12.

June 23, 2015 was the discovery deadline. Plaintiff took no steps to enlarge the

time to conduct discovery.
13.

September 14, 2015 was the deadline to file a pretrial stipulation and

accompanying filings. Plaintiff never provided draft stipulation, proposed jury instructions or
verdict form, let alone contacted Citibank's counsel to begin the process of agreeing on a joint set
of materials.
14.

On September 18, 2015, this Court sua sponte entered its Order [ECF No. 80]

directing the parties' compliance with the Court's Scheduling Order [ECF No. 21] by, inter alia,
filing a joint pretrial stipulation on or before September 25, 2015.
15.

The following business day, counsel for Citibank requested Plaintiff's counsel to

provide a draft pretrial stipulation for review and comment in order to comply with the Court's
directives. Counsel for Plaintiff represented that a draft pretrial stipulation would be provided on
Wednesday, September 23rd. Same was never provided. Upon follow up, counsel for Plaintiff
assured undersigned counsel in writing that a draft would be provided by the evening of
September 24th. Again, nothing was provided.

16.

Instead of preparing and providing the draft pretrial stipulation so that the parties

could comply with the Court's directives, Plaintiff's counsel utilized that time to prepare
Plaintiff's Motion, filing it at 9:48 p.m. on September 24th.
17.

Because of the refusal to comply with the Court's directives, Citibank is filing

contemporaneously herewith its Pretrial Statement in lieu of a Joint Pretrial Stipulation.
CONCLUSION
18.

The circumstances Plaintiff finds himself in are self-inflicted. Having initiated

litigation, he is obligated to comply with the directives of this Court. Failure to do so does not
give rise to prejudice warranting a continuance.
19.

The only party at risk of being prejudiced with respect to Plaintiff's Motion is

Citibank. Citibank has had to expend significant time and expense in defending this case for
more than a year. If this case is continued, discovery is re-opened and the trial is reset, the time,
expense and prejudice to Citibank will increase exponentially. The Motion must be denied.
WHEREFORE, Defendant, CITIBANK, N.A., prays that this Honorable Court enter an
Order denying Plaintiff's Motion in its entirety.
Respectfully submitted,
