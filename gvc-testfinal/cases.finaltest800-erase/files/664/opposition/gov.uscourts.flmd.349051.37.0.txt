PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT, WORLD
WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.’S, MOTION TO
STAY DISCOVERY DUE TO PENDING MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff, DONALD ANDERSON, by and through undersigned counsel, files his
Response to Defendant, WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.’S, Motion to Stay
Discovery due to Pending Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 36), and in support, states the following:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff

initiated

this

action

against

Defendant,

WORLD

WRESTLING

ENTERTAINMENT, INC. (“WWE”) as a result of Plaintiff being physically attacked by the
WWE’s employee and/or agent, Defendant, THADDEUS MICHAEL BULLARD SR. a/k/a
TITUS O’NEIL (“O’NEIL”). On May 14, 2018, WWE filed its Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 17),
which alleges this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the WWE. On May 23, 2018, Plaintiff
filed his Response to this Motion (Doc. 19). On September 26, 2018, Plaintiff served WWE with
initial discovery requests (Doc. 36-7 and 36-8), some of which seek discovery on issues relevant
to WWE’s Motion to Dismiss.

On October 24, 2018, WWE filed its Motion to Stay Discovery due to Pending Motion to
Dismiss (Doc. 36). It appears the main argument being raised in the Motion to Stay is that the
WWE does not want to voluntarily respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests to prevent a future
argument that the WWE has waived its purported personal jurisdiction defense.
Plaintiff is agreeable to waive any argument he has that the WWE gives up its purported
personal jurisdiction defense if WWE responds to Plaintiff’s discovery requests served on
September 26, 2018. Accordingly, Plaintiff is respectfully requesting this Court deny WWE’s
Motion to Stay Discovery. In addition, if the Court does deny the WWE’s Motion to Stay
Discovery, then obviously the WWE would not “voluntarily” be responding to Plaintiff’s
pending discovery requests.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
I. MOTIONS TO STAY DISCOVERY ARE DISFAVORED
Discovery should be stayed only in the rarest of circumstances. Hovermale v. School Bd.
of Hillsborough County, Fla., 128 F.R.D. 287, 289 (M.D. Fla. 1989); APR Energy, LLC v.
Pakistan Power Res., LLC, No. 3:08-CV-961-J-25MCR, 2009 WL 2762064, at *2 (M.D. Fla.
Aug. 28, 2009). The primary “purpose of discovery under the Federal Rules is to require the
disclosure of all relevant information so that the ultimate resolution of disputed issues in any
civil action may be based on a full and accurate understanding of the true facts.” APR Energy,
2009 WL 2762064, at *3 (citing United States v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682
(1958)). Minimal judicial supervision is envisioned in the operation of discovery unless the
parties encounter a dispute and request judicial intervention. APR Energy, 2009 WL 2762064, at
*3. This Court advocates that parties practice discovery “with a spirit of cooperation and
civility.” Id.

As such, courts do not favor motions staying discovery and such motions are rarely
granted. Hovermale, 128 F.R.D. at 289; APR Energy, 2009 WL 2762064, at *2. Staying
discovery is “not favored because when discovery is delayed or prolonged it can create case
management problems which impede the Court's responsibility to expedite discovery and cause
unnecessary litigation expenses and problems.” S.D. v. St. Johns Cnty. Sch. Dist., No. 3:09-cv250-J-20TEM, 2009 WL 3231654, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 1, 2009)(denying motion to stay
discovery pending decision on motion to dismiss), modified by S.D. v. St. Johns Cnty. Sch. Dist.,
No. 3:09-CV250-J20TEM, 2009 WL 4349878, at *4-5 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 24, 2009)(amending
order to stay discovery only as to individual government-official defendants who asserted a
defense of qualified immunity, but permitting full discovery as to the school district defendant).
As motions staying discovery are disfavored, the party seeking a protective order staying
discovery has the heavy burden to demonstrate good cause, and must make “a particular and
specific demonstration of fact as distinguished from stereotyped and conclusory statements”
supporting the need for a protective order. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Se. Floating Docks, Inc., 231
F.R.D. 426, 429-30 (M.D. Fla. 2005); Feldman v. Flood, 176 F.R.D. 651, 652 (M.D. Fla. 1997);
Gulf Oil Company v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 102 n. 16 (1981).
II. WWE HAS NOT ESTABLISHED GOOD CAUSE
NOR PREJUDICE TO JUSTIFY A STAY OF DISCOVERY
The Discovery Practices Manual for this Court explicitly states that “Normally, the
pendency of a motion to dismiss ... will not justify a unilateral motion to stay discovery pending
resolution of the dispositive motion.... However, unusual circumstances may justify a stay of
discovery in a particular case upon a specific showing of prejudice or undue burden.” Middle
District Discovery Manual (2015) at p. 5, section I(E)(4). As stated above, the party moving to
stay discovery bears the heavy burden of showing good cause and reasonableness for such an
3

extraordinary measure. See Feldman, 176 F.R.D. at 652. There has been no factual undue
burden alleged and the only factual prejudice alleged is the WWE’s argument that it potentially
may waive its personal jurisdiction defense if it voluntarily responds to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests. As stated above, Plaintiff is agreeable that the WWE will not waive its personal
jurisdiction defense if it responds to the pending discovery requests. In addition, if the Court
denies the WWE’s Motion to Stay Discovery then the WWE would not voluntarily be
responding to the discovery requests. Accordingly, Plaintiff believes that the WWE has not met
its burden, and thus, is respectfully requesting that this Court deny the motion.
III. WWE’S MOTION TO DISMISS DOES NOT JUSTIFY A DISCOVERY STAY
When determining whether to grant a motion staying discovery premised upon the
movant's pending motion to dismiss, “a court must balance the harm caused by a delay in
discovery against the possibility that the dispositive motion might be granted.” McCabe v. Foley,
233 F.R.D. 683, 685 (M.D. Fla. 2006)(citations omitted). In doing so, the court must take a
“preliminary peek” at the merits of the motion to dismiss to see if it “appears to be clearly
meritorious and truly case dispositive.” McCabe, 233 F.R.D. at 685 (citation omitted, emphasis
added).
A “preliminary peek” at the WWE’s Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiff’s Response reveals
a strong possibility that the motion would be denied. As discussed in detail within Plaintiff’s
response to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff believes he has established that jurisdiction over the
WWE is authorized under Florida’s longarm statute and that exercise of jurisdiction over the
WWE comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice under the Due
Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition, the allegations against the WWE, in
part, arise from WWE’s business operations in Florida. Specifically, the claims against the

4

WWE for its negligent retention, training and supervision occurred at its Performance Center in
Orlando, Florida. See, Amended Complaint ¶¶ 5e, m, n, and o, 12, and 101. Also, the vicarious
liability counts for Battery, Assault, and Negligent and Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress against WWE rely on the allegations that O’NEIL’S violent propensities were enhanced,
encouraged, trained, approved and promoted by the WWE in Orlando, Florida. Id. ¶¶ 5e and n,
60, 66, 71, 77, 104, and 115. Further, the preparation for the WWE show being filmed at the
time the assault took place was conducted in Orlando, Florida, which partially forms the basis for
the Negligence and Gross Negligence claims alleged against the WWE. Id. ¶¶ 5e, m, and o, 12,
82, and 89. None of these allegations have been refuted.
Thus, the motion to dismiss is “not so clear on its face that there is ‘an immediate and
clear possibility that it will be granted’ ” so as to justify a complete stay of discovery. See Koock,
2009 WL 2579307, at * 2 (citing Feldman, 176 F.R.D. at 653)(denying motion to stay discovery
because defendant's motion to dismiss “not so clear on its face that there is ‘an immediate and
clear possibility that it will be granted’”).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated hereinabove, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court deny
WWE’s Motion to Stay Discovery due to Pending Motion to Dismiss. If the Court denies the
WWE’s Motion to Stay Discovery, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the WWE be required to
respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests within fifteen (15) days of the Court denying the
motion.
