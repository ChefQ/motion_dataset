9. As of the filing of this Motion, WWE’s Motion to Dismiss is still pending with this
Honorable Court.
Grounds for Motion
I.

Voluntarily Participating in Discovery will Waive Personal Jurisdiction Defense
WWE does not voluntarily submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of this Court,
and does not intend for any of its acts to be viewed as a waiver or as an express or implied submission to that jurisdiction. WWE does, however, recognize that the courts
have found an entity’s participation in discovery to be just such a waiver, including the
following:
1. A personal jurisdiction defense can be waived by express submission, conduct, or failure to assert the defense including fully participating in litigation including lengthy discovery and motion practice. In re Trasylol Prods.
Liab. Litig., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30300, *153 (2011).
2. A waiver of the personal jurisdiction defense can be found when a Defendant “. . .participate[s] (and failed to participate) in discovery, submit[s] a
joint Scheduling Report, giv[es] testimony at his deposition, attend[s]

hearings with the Magistrate Judge, and attend[s] mediation, even after he
filed a motion to vacate for lack of personal jurisdiction.” Appelbaum v.
Rickenbacker Grp., Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194178, *2-3.
3. If WWE substantively responds voluntarily to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories
and Request to Produce, WWE risks any discovery response being unintentionally and unwillingly construed as WWE’s submission to the Court’s
jurisdiction.
II.

Motion to Stay Discovery is Appropriate in this Case
1. “District courts enjoy broad discretion in deciding how best to manage
the cases before them.” McCullough v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.,
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4057, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 11, 2017) (quoting
Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., 123 F.3d 1353, 1366 (11th Cir.
1997). This includes the “broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to control its own docket.” Id. (quoting Clinton v.
Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 683 (1997)).
2. A Court must balance the harm produced by a delay in discovery against
the possibility that the dispositive motion will be granted and entirely
eliminate the need for such discovery. Pagano v. Quicken Loans Inc.,
2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109672 (June 29, 2018) citing Feldman v. Flood,
176 F.R.D. 651, 652 (M.D. Fla. 1997).
3. Plaintiff is not prejudiced as this Motion, if granted, has no bearing on
Co-Defendant, Thaddeus Bullard, Sr. a/k/a Titus O’Neill.

Memorandum of Points and Authorities
I.

Voluntarily Participating in Discovery Can Be Construed as a Waiver of a Personal Jurisdiction Defense
The Court should stay discovery in regards to WWE while WWE’s Motion to Dismiss for

Lack of Personal Jurisdiction is pending in order to prevent WWE from waiving this defense by
voluntarily participating in litigation.
When a party voluntarily participates in litigation to a significant degree, a Court may find
that that party has waived their lack of personal jurisdiction defense. In re Trasylol Prods. Liab.
Litig., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30300, *153 (2011). In In re Trasylol, defendants had a pending
Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction stemming from plaintiff’s inability to properly
serve the defendant. Id. In ruling on defendant’s motion, the court analyzed whether the defendant
had waived their lack of personal jurisdiction defense. Id. The court held that because the defendant had only appeared in a limited capacity to remove the case to federal court and to collect fact
sheets on the plaintiffs, they did not waive their lack of personal jurisdiction defense. The court
went further comparing defendant’s conduct to other cases where a waiver was found where other
parties had engaged in significant discovery and litigation and stated that defendant’s conduct
had not risen to such a level. Id.
The limited activities WWE has performed in the instant case are analogous to those by
the defendants in In Re Trasylol. WWE has only removed the case to federal court and complied
with Court orders relating to the trial scheduled by the Plaintiff in this case. None of WWE’s
activities are substantive conduct related to the merits of Plaintiff’s case. WWE had filed their
Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction since the inception of the federal action.

Case 8:18-cv-00901-MSS-AAS Document 36 Filed 10/24/18 Page 5 of 8 PageID 322
CASE NO.: 2018-CA-807-ES
WWE would be in danger of waiving its defense of lack of personal jurisdiction if WWE voluntarily participated in Plaintiff’s discovery requests. The In Re Trasylol court specifically noted in
its reasoning that the defendants in that case had not “engaged in the kind of extensive discovery
or motions practice that has persuaded other circuits to find a waiver of the defense.” Id. At 153.
Similarly, in Appelbaum v. Rickenbacker Grp., Inc., the court found that defendant had
waived his defense of lack of personal jurisdiction when he “participated in discovery, submitting
a joint Scheduling Report, giving testimony at his deposition, attending hearings with the Magistrate Judge, and attending mediation, even after [filing] [his] motion for lack of personal jurisdiction.” Appelbaum v. Rickenbacker Grp., Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194178, *2-3. While the
court’s decision cited additional activities that the defendant had participated in besides initial
discovery, in this instant case, initial discovery is the only one of these activities that has happened
thus far. As the Appelbaum court makes clear, participating in initial discovery is one of the first
actions a defendant can take to begin the actions necessary that will eventually culminate in waiving a lack of personal jurisdiction defense.
II.

Motion to Stay Discovery is Appropriate in this Case
Defendant WWE can show good cause and reasonableness that the motion to stay dis-

covery should be granted in the instant case. Additionally, WWE can show that the risk of harm
produced by a delay in discovery is outweighed by the possibility that WWE’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction will be granted and entirely eliminate the need for discovery.
“To prevail on a motion to stay [discovery], a movant must show ‘good cause and reasonableness,’ and the Court ‘must balance the harm produced by a delay in discovery against
the possibility that the [dispositive] motion will be granted and entirely eliminate the need for

such discovery.’” McCullough v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4057,
at *1 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 11, 2017) (quoting McCabe v. Foley, 233 F.R.D. 683, 685 (M.D. Fla.
2006). This standard was used by the court in Pagano v. Quicken Loans, Inc. 2018 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 109672, at 3 (M.D. Fla. June 29, 2018). In Pagano, the defendant argued that discovery
should be stayed because the court lacked pendent personal jurisdiction, which the plaintiff denied. Id. Both parties cited no case authority regarding their respective basis for or against lack
of pendent personal jurisdiction. Id. The court ruled against the stay because of the defendant’s
lack of case authority. Id.
In the instant case, WWE has shown good cause and reasonableness to grant a discovery
stay. As discussed in the previous section of this Motion, voluntarily participating in Plaintiff’s
initial discovery requests endangers WWE of waiving their lack of personal jurisdiction defense. If the relief sought in this motion is not granted, and WWE is then forced to either respond to Plaintiff’s initial discovery requests thereby risking waiving their lack of personal jurisdiction defense or, in the alternative, if WWE does not respond to Plaintiff’s initial discovery
requests to preserve its lack of personal jurisdiction defense, then WWE risks violating the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding timely responses to discovery which would put WWE
in jeopardy of sanctions. Thus, a discovery stay prevents WWE from either unfavorable outcome.
Secondly, if the Court grants WWE’s Motion, the harm produced by a delay in discovery is minimal to Plaintiff because there is a strong possibility that WWE’s motion will be
granted and entirely eliminate the need for discovery. The facts that give rise to Plaintiff’s
Amended Complaint occurred in Norfolk, Virginia. WWE is incorporated under the laws of

Delaware and its principal place of business is in Connecticut. Co-Defendant, Thaddeus Michael Bullard, Sr. is a California resident. WWE’s only tie to the Middle District of Florida is a
training center located in Orlando, FL. WWE has cited extensive case authority showing that
WWE does not have the sufficient minimum contacts with the Middle District of Florida to sustain personal jurisdiction for this case.

Order staying discovery and for all other relief the Court deems just and proper.
