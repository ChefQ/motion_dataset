Fiduciary Duty, Violation of the Consumer Protection Act, and for Injunctive Relief, his claim rests
entirely upon the assertion that First American and Foreclosurelink violate Title 61 of the Revised
Code of Washington (RCW) through the scope of the agency between First American as the
foreclosure trustee and Foreclosurelink as its agent. This assertion is premised upon a citation to a
Washington statute that is not even in effect and overlooks the provisions of Title 61 of the RCW
explicitly and implicitly allowing the use of agents, as well as case law addressing the issue.

Specifically, First American and Foreclosurelink have submitted affidavits which set forth
the licensing status of First American, its conduct as a nonjudicial foreclosure trustee, the form of
nonjudicial foreclosure notices, the duties performed by Foreclosurelink, and the limited nature of
the agency as limited to specific foreclosure in which the assistance of Foreclosurelink is sought by
First American. In addition, RCW 61.24.010(4) specifically permits the use of agents to conduct
auctions, provides for the trustee to utilize services of others to publish and mail notices, and does
not in any way prohibit the use of an agent by a trustee. The facts and arguments set forth in section
IV. infra demonstrate that Plaintiffs theory is fundamentally flawed.

The Plaintiffs failed theory permeates throughout his causes of action, none of which he can
establish as a matter of law against either First American or Foreclosurelink. The first cause of
action for Infliction of Emotional Distress fails because the Plaintiff cannot establish any of the
elements of the tort as required by Washington law, particularly because a plaintiff must establish
that the conduct at issue must be "so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go
beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a
civilized community." Grimsby v. Samson, 85 Wash.2d 52, 59-60 (1975). The second cause of
action for Slander of Title fails because the Plaintiff admitted he defaulted in payments under the
Deed of Trust under which First American was the trustee, and cannot establish malice in the
recording and delivery of nonjudicial foreclosure notices.

The third cause of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty fails to create a disputed issue of
material fact because the Plaintiff cannot show that First American or Foreclosurelink failed to
deliver nonjudicial foreclosure notices as required by Washington law or that they engaged in any

conduct that caused the Plaintiff to believe that nonjudicial foreclosure would not proceed. The

fourth cause of action for Violation of the Consumer Protection Act fails as a matter of law because
the Plaintiff cannot establish either first or fourth element of the claim. Specifically, Plaintiff cannot
show that under RCW 19.86.020, First American or Foreclosurelink engaged in an unfair or
deceptive act or practice, or that it proximately caused injury to the plaintiff in his or her business
or property. Johnson v. Cash Store, 116 Wash.App. 833, 846 (Wash.App.2003).

Finally, Plaintiff's separate cause of action for an injunction to stop the foreclosure that
Defendant Block was pursuing through First American is moot, as Plaintiff has reached a settlement
with Mr. Block by which he admitted the default and agreed to terms of repayment. In conjunction
with that settlement, First American caused the recording of a Notice of Discontinuance of Trustee's
Sale. As a result, there exists no pending foreclosure process for the Plaintiff to enjoin, making the
relief sought by this cause of action moot.

Il. UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS

First American is licensed by the State of Washington as a title insurance company, WAOIC
number 461. First American has been admitted as a title insurance company in the State of
Washington since January 2, 1969. (Affidavit of First American, { 6). First American maintains an
office located at 2101 4th Avenue, Suite 800, Seattle, WA 98121, at which personal service can be
made upon it, and has maintained that office address at all times relevant to this litigation. (First
Am. Aff., J 7).

First American serves as a nonjudicial foreclosure trustee under certain deeds of trust
encumbering real property located in the State of Washington. First American is familiar with the
requirements of Washington law with regard to the conduct of nonjudicial foreclosures, and has
verified that the form of its nonjudicial foreclosure notices complies with Washington law.
Specifically, First American has verified that the form of its Notice of Default, Notice of
Foreclosure, and Notice of Trustee's Sale comply with the Revised Code of Washington sections
61.24.030 and 61.24.040. (First Am. Aff., J 8).

In connection with acting as a nonjudicial foreclosure trustee, First American also will
prepare a trustee's sale guarantee that identifies the current property owner, existing encumbrances,

address of persons or entities entitled to notice of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale, and identifies

matters that may constitute exceptions to the foreclosing beneficiary obtaining title to real property
free and clear of claims or encumbrances upon completion of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale. The
trustee's sale guarantee does not equate to an owner or lender's policy of title insurance, but provides
certain guarantees in connection with the processing of a nonjudicial foreclosure. (First Am. Aff.,
4 9).

First American has contracted with Foreclosurelink, Inc., to act as an agent of First American
for purposes of: preparing the appointment of successor trustee to cause First American to become
the trustee; preparing nonjudicial foreclosure notices; causing notices to be mailed to parties required
to receive notice; coordinating the posting and publishing of the Notice of Trustee's Sale; and,
arranging for an auctioneer to conduct the actual nonjudicial foreclosure sale. The form of the
Appointment of Successor Trustee, Notice of Default, Notice of Foreclosure, Notice to Guarantor,
and Notice of Trustee's Sale actually generated for any nonjudicial foreclosure sale comes from a
format approved of by First American in order to comply with Washington law. The identity of and
addresses for persons or entities to be served with nonjudicial foreclosure notices contained within
the Notice of Default, Notice of Foreclosure, and Notice of Trustee's Sale comes from the trustee's
sale guarantee generated by First American, as well as from information provided by the beneficiary
or servicer of the loan for the foreclosing beneficiary. (First Am. Aff., 0x00A7 10; Affidavit of
Foreclosurelink, { 7.)

Foreclosurelink only serves as an agent for First American when specifically agreed upon for
specific nonjudicial foreclosures of real property. Foreclosurelink does not have authority from First
American to serve as the agent for First American for purposes of a nonjudicial foreclosure without
the prior written consent of First American, and is authorized to sign documents only as the agent
of First American. Unless specifically agreed upon in writing for a limited purpose, Foreclosurelink
does not have a power of attorney to execute documents on behalf of First American in connection
with any nonjudicial foreclosure sale. (First Am. Aff., 0x00A7 11, Foreclosurelink Aff., J 8).

Foreclosurelink was the agent for First American Title Insurance Company (`First
American"), the substituted trustee under the below-referenced Deed of Trust, for purposes of

assisting in the delivery of non-judicial foreclosure notices concerning the non-judicial foreclosure

ofa Home Equity Line of Credit Deed of Trust and Security Agreement ("Deed of Trust") dated June
9, 2004, encumbering the real property commonly known as 31210 Carnation Duvall Road
Northeast, Carnation, Washington 98014, aka 9424 Carnation Duvall Road Northeast, Carnation,
Washington 98014 ("Subject Property"). (First Am. Aff., { 12, Foreclosurelink Aff., 0x00A7 9). This
Deed of Trust is junior in priority to a first priority deed of trust under which defendant Mortgage
Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., is the beneficiary of record.

Foreclosurelink contacted First American concerning a potential nonjudicial foreclosure of
the Subject Property when Foreclosurelink was contacted by Norm Pomeranz, an agent acting on
behalf of Tom Block. Mr. Block was the beneficiary by assignment of the Deed of Trust. First
American agreed to serve as the successor trustee under the Deed of Trust for purposes of
commencing a nonjudicial foreclosure. Accordingly, Mr. Block executed an Appointment of
Successor Trustee on January 4, 2007, appointing First American as the successor trustee. The form
of the Appointment of Successor Trustee was previously approved by First American, including the
request to return it after recording to Foreclosurelink. A true and correct copy of the Appointment
of Successor Trustee is attached to the supporting affidavits as Exhibit A. (First Am. Aff., 0x00A7 12,
Foreclosurelink Aff., 0x00A7 9).

Foreclosurelink subsequently prepared a Notice of Default also dated January 4. 2007, and
sent the Notice of Default to Plaintiff and the other parties entitled to notice by first class mail and
certified mail, pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Code of Washington 61.24.030(7). The
form of the Notice of Default was previously approved by First American, as well as Foreclosurelink
mailing the notices. The information for the mailing of the Notice of Default came from the trustee's
sale guarantee prepared by First American. The Notice of Default was also posted in a conspicuous
place on the Subject Property. (First Am. Aff., J 13, Foreclosurelink Aff., J 10).

On February 8, 2007, Foreclosurelink prepared a Notice of Foreclosure and a separate Notice
of Trustee's Sale, sending both notices to Plaintiff and the other parties entitled to receive notice by
first class mail and certified mail. The Notice of Foreclosure specified the office address of First
American in Seattle as the office to serve any process. The Notice of Trustee's Sale was recorded

in the Official Records of King County on February 9, 2007. Both the Notice of Foreclosure and

Notice of Trustee's Sale were in a form previously approved by First American, and the information
for the mailing of the notices came from the trustee's sale guarantee prepared by First American.
The Notice of Trustee's Sale was also published in the Daily Journal of Commerce and posted on
the Subject Property. (First Am. Aff., yen 14, Foreclosurelink Aff., 4 11).

On April 24, 2007, at the request of Mr. Block, a Notice of Discontinuance of the Trustee's
Sale was prepared by Foreclosurelink and recorded on April 26, 2007. The form of the Notice of
Discontinuance was previously approved by First American. (First Am. Aff., 4 15, Foreclosurelink
Aff., 7 12).

On October 24, 2007, Norm Pomeranz, the agent for Mr. Block, request the initiation of a
new nonjudicial foreclosure process due to a default by the Plaintiff. Foreclosurelink subsequently
prepared a Notice of Default dated October 30. 2007, and sent the Notice of Default to Plaintiff and
the other parties entitled to notice by first class mail and certified mail, pursuant to the provisions
of the Revised Code of Washington 61.24.030(7). The form of the Notice of Default was previously
approved by First American, as well as Foreclosurelink mailing the notices. The information for the
mailing of the Notice of Default came from the trustee's sale guarantee prepared by First American.
The Notice of Default was also posted in a conspicuous place on the Subject Property. A true and
correct copy of the Notice of Default is attached to the supporting affidavits as Exhibit B. (First Am.
Aff., 9 16, Foreclosurelink Aff., | 13).

On November 30, 2007, Foreclosurelink prepared a Notice of Foreclosure and a separate
Notice of Trustee's Sale, sending both notices to Plaintiff and the other parties entitled to receive
notice by first class mail and certified mail. The Notice of Foreclosure specified the office address
of First American in Seattle as the office to serve any process. The Notice of Trustee's Sale was
recorded in the Official Records of King County on December 4, 2007. Both the Notice of
Foreclosure and Notice of Trustee's Sale were in a form previously approved by First American, and
the information for the mailing of the notices came from the trustee's sale guarantee prepared by
First American. The Notice of Trustee's Sale was also published in the Daily Journal of Commerce
and posted on the Subject Property. True and correct copies of the Notice of Foreclosure and Notice

of Trustee's Sale are attached to the supporting affidavits as Exhibits C and D, respectively. (First

Am. Aff., 917, Foreclosurelink Aff., 14). First American did not proceed with a sale due to the
present litigation and communication with Mr. Block. (First Am. Aff., 0x00A7 18, Foreclosurelink Aff.,
q 15).

The use of agents to assist in the preparation and delivery of nonjudicial foreclosure notices
is common for nonjudicial foreclosures processed within the State of Washington. The handling of
the nonjudicial foreclosure notices as agent for First American in this matter is consistent with both
First American and Foreclosurelink's procedures generally. (First Am. Aff., J 19, Foreclosurelink
Aff., J 16).

The Plaintiff originally filed the present litigation in the Superior Court for the County of
King. The operative complaint was the First Amended Complaint ("FAC") when the case was
removed to Federal Court. The Plaintiff subsequently entered into a settlement with Defendant Tom
Block, the beneficiary under the Deed of Trust who appointed First American as the successor
trustee. The Plaintiff and Mr. Block reach an agreement on payment of the loan that had been in
default. (See Discovery Responses by Plaintiff, attached as Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Peter
Salmon.) A Notice of Discontinuance of Sale was recorded by First American based upon this
settlement on July 3, 2008, as instrument number 20080703001010 in the official records of King
County, Washingion. (A true and correct copy of the Notice is attached as Exhibit A to the Request
for Judicial Notice.)

TW. LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate where "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure
materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and
that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party
is entitled to summary judgment if, after satisfying its initial burden, the non-moving party fails to
present specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477
U.S. 317, 324 (1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1066 (1988). "The mere existence of a scintilla of
evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient" to defeat a motion for
summary judgment. Triton Energy Corp. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995). Factual

disputes whose resolution would not affect the outcome of the litigation are irrelevant to the

consideration of a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,
248 (1986). Viewed another way, summary judgment is appropriate where the nonmoving party fails
to present admissible evidence as to each and every essential element of their claim. Celotex, 477
USS, at 324; see Lujan v. Nat'] Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 884 (1990) (failure to "make a
sufficient showing of an essential element" of one's case requires dismissal). Mere disagreement or
the bald assertion that a genuine issue of material fact exists will not preclude the use of summary
judgment. California Architectural Bldg. Prod., Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466,
1468 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1006 (1988).

IV. THE REVISED CODE OF WASHINGTON GOVERNING NONJUDICIAL

FORECLOSURE TRUSTEES PERMITS THE USE OF AGENTS AND THE SCOPE

OF THE AGENCY BETWEEN FIRST AMERICAN AND FORECLOSURELINK

The entirety of Plaintiffs claims against First American and Foreclosurelink are premised
upon the contention that Foreclosurelink is actually acting as the nonjudicial foreclosure trustee
under the Deed of Trust at issue even though it does not qualify to serve under RCW 61.24.010, and
that even if First American sought the assistance of an agent to assist with foreclosure notices, the
agent must qualify as a "title insurance agent" within the meaning of RCW 48.17.010(5). As set
forth herein, these arguments are fundamentally flaws and mis-state Washington law.

A. The Applicable Washington Nonjudicial Foreclosure Statutory Authority Permits the

Use of an Agent by the Trustee

No portion of the Revised Code of Washington governing nonjudicial foreclosures bars the
use of agents to assist with the delivery of notices. Indeed, the statutory scheme governing the
Notice of Sale expressly contemplates the use of an agent for the conduct of the sale and implicitly
authorizes the use of agents for other notices.

Specifically, RCW 61.24.040(4) provides that "the trustee or its authorized agent shall sell
the property at public auction." Therefore, the individual or entity that serves as the trustee does not
have to personally conduct the sale. The Washington Supreme Court has specifically found that an
agent engaged to conduct the actual sale can create liability for the nonjudicial foreclosure trustee

even where that auctioneer was argued not to have apparent authority to open bidding at an

insufficient amount. See Udall v. T.D. Services, 159 Wash.2d 903, 912 (Wash.2007). The Udall
Court analyzed the scope of the agency relationship between the trustee and the auctioneer it utilized
under general principles of agency law as applied by Washington courts.

The other portions of RCW 61.24.040 also contemplate the use of agents for notices by
utilizing the word "cause" to describe the obligations imposed on the trustee. For example,
subdivision (3) provides that the trustee shall "cause" the notice of sale to be published; subdivisions
(1)(b) through (f) provide that the trustee shall "cause" the notice of sale to be mailed to the required
persons. If the Washington legislature intended that the trustee personally deliver each of those
notices, it could have simply barred the use of agents to assist with delivery of required notices or
would not have utilized the terminology "cause" to be mailed, and instead would have required the
trustee to mail or publish the notices personally. It did not choose to do this; rather, the practice of
utilizing agents for nonjudicial foreclosures in Washington is common for First American as a
trustee and Foreclosurelink as an agent. Courts in other jurisdictions have also recognized this
practice as common and accepted. See Russell v. Lundberg, 120 P.3d 541, 544 (Utah.App.2005).

First American, as a Washington licensed title insurance company authorized to serve as a
trustee under RCW 61.24.010(1), has approved the form of the Notice of Default, Notice of
Foreclosure, and Notice of Trustee's Sale utilized in this foreclosure and in others. (First Am. Aff.,
{ 8). It has also internally verified that these notices meet the requirements of the Revised Code of
Washington. It specifies an actual office address in the State of Washington in the Notice of
Foreclosure that any borrower or party in interest can contact in connection with a nonjudicial
foreclosure. (First Am. Aff., J9 7, 14, 17). Foreclosurelink performs its duties in accordance with
the agreement between First American and Foreclosurelink, and the affidavits of First American and
Foreclosurelink show that all of the activity with regard to the present foreclosure demonstrates
compliance with that agreement. As a result, the Plaintiff simply cannot demonstrate any conduct
or action by either First American or Foreclosurelink that violates RCW 61.24.005 et seq.

B. Plaintiffs Contention that an Agent for a Nonjudicial Foreclosure Trustee must be
Licensed as a Title Insurance Agent Misapprehends Washington Nonjudicial
Foreclosure Law and Relies on a Statute Not in Effect

The contention that Foreclosurelink must qualify as a "title insurance agent" in order to serve
as an agent for First American for purposes of nonjudicial foreclosure notices is a flawed premise
for multiple reasons. First, RCW 48.17.010 subdivision (15) cited by Plaintiff at paragraph 2.12 of
the FAC does not even come into effect until July 1, 2009, and therefore cannot provide a legal basis
for Plaintiff's assertion. Even if that definition applied to the case at bar, it fails to establish any
violation of the nonjudicial foreclosure statutory scheme by either First American or Foreclosurelink.

Under the current version of RCW 48.17.010, an "Agent" means "any person appointed by
an insurer to solicit applications for insurance on its behalf. If authorized so to do, an agent may
effectuate insurance contracts. An agent may collect premiums on insurances so applied for or
effectuated." However, Title 48 of the Revised Code of Washington has a section entitled "Scope
of code" providing that "All insurance and insurance transactions in this state, or affecting subjects
located wholly or in part or to be performed within this state, and all persons having to do therewith
are governed by this code." No portion of this Tile of the Revised Code of Washington even
purports to regulate the conduct of nonjudicial foreclosure sales.

Indeed, the Washington Supreme Court has noted that the nonjudicial foreclosure statutory
scheme was created to provide a more efficient remedy for creditors coupled with the waiver of the
right to pursue a deficiency associated with a judicial foreclosure action. The three goals of the
Washington deed of trust act are: (1) that the nonjudicial foreclosure process should be efficient and
inexpensive; (2) that the process should result in interested parties having an adequate opportunity
to prevent wrongful foreclosure; and (3) that the process should promote stability of land titles. Cox
vy. Helenius, 103 Wash.2d 383, 387 (1985). This comprehensive statutory scheme governs the
entirety of the nonjudicial foreclosure process. The Plaintiff's attempt to utilize another statutory
scheme to define who can serve as an agent also violates the settled principle of Washington law that
the more specific statute governs over the more general. See Waste Management of Seattle, Inc. v.
Utilities & Transp Comm'n, 123 Wash.2d 621, 630 (Wash.1994),
