year. Mr. Buse has resolved his claims against the foreclosing entity, Defendant Tom Block,

2

and those claims have been dismissed, pursuant to the terms of a Settlement Agreement which

3

has been presented to the Court as an attachment to the Declaration of Peter Salmon filed by

4
Defendants ForeclosureLink and First American in support of their Motion. Mr. Buse has also
5
6

settled his claims against Defendants Greenpoint and MERS and is in the process of completing

7

the documentation of those settlement terms. See, Declaration of Melissa A. Huelsman filed in

8

support of this Response (“Huelsman Dec.”), ¶2. The parties to those agreements expect to

9

have that process completed by the end of this week. Id.

10
11

The claims remaining against Defendants ForeclosureLink and First American are
related to the manner in which they engaged in the conduct of the foreclosure sale process.

12
Whether or not Mr. Buse was delinquent on the loan is not relevant to the analysis of the claims
13
14

being made against these defendants. Rather, the assertion is that these Defendants were

15

violating the requirements of the Washington Deed of Trust (“DTA”), RCW 61.24, et seq.

16

when they initiated the foreclosure sale and caused false documentation to be recorded in the

17

records of King County, Washington.

18
19

Without restating the entirety of Mr. Buse’s Factual Portion of his Complaint, it is
important to note as regards the claims against these defendants that Defendant Block executed

20
21
22

an Appointment of Successor Trustee document on January 4, 2007 appointing Defendant First
American as the successor trustee, after he acquired ownership of Mr. Buse’s second mortgage

23

loan. However, the document’s return address was at the offices of Defendant

24

ForeclosureLink. A copy of that Appointment of Successor Trustee document is attached to

25

the Affidavit of ForeclosureLink filed in support of the MSJ (“ForeclosureLink Aff.”) as

26

Exhibit “A”. That document was not recorded until January 9, 2007, which was the date that it

became effective under Washington law. RCW 61.24.010(2). Nevertheless, Defendant First

2

American, by and through its purported agent, Defendant ForeclosureLink, served Mr. Buse

3

with a Notice of Default document, at a time when neither of those defendants had been

4
properly appointed as the trustee. A copy of the Notice of Default is attached to the
5
6

ForeclosureLink Aff. As Exhibit “B”.

7

The Notice of Trustee’s Sale initiated by Defendant ForeclosureLink as the ostensible

8

agent of Defendant First American was recorded on December 4, 2007 in the records of King

9

County, Washington. The only address listed for contact with the foreclosing trustee on that

10
11

document is an address in Fair Oaks, California. There is no Washington address on the
document for contacting the alleged trustee, Defendant First American and the return address

12
for the recording is Defendant ForeclosureLink’s office in Fair Oaks, California. A copy of the
13
14

recorded Notice of Trustee’s Sale is attached to the ForeclosureLink Aff. as Exhibit “D”. A

15

copy of an additional document entitled Notice of Foreclosure is attached to the

16

ForeclosureLink Aff. as Exhibit “C” showing that a motion to enjoin the sale should be served

17

upon Defendant First American at an address in Washington. (Another Notice of Trustee’s

18
19

Sale was recorded earlier in the year as well, and that sale was discontinued after Mr. Buse
resolved his dispute with Mr. Block.)

20

22

In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants ForeclosureLink and First American
submit Affidavits which describe the terms and nature of the written agreement entered into

23

between these two defendants. Marsha Townsend, Vice President of ForeclosureLink and Jerry

24

Jeffers, Assistant Vice President and Chief Title Officer, both testify about this purported

25

agreement, but neither one of them bothers to provide this Court with the writing itself, in

26

contravention of the Best Evidence Rule, ER 1002. In fact, at Paragraph 6, Ms. Townsend

states that “the business records are available for inspection and copies can be submitted to the

2

Court if required.” ForeclosureLink Aff., ¶6. Ms. Townsend does not explain why she cannot

Townsend asserts that its trustee sale documents “comply with Washington law”. Id., ¶7.

10
11

Ms. Townsend goes on to assert that
Foreclosurelink only serves as an agent for First American when specifically
agreed upon for specific nonjudicial foreclosure of real property.
Foreclosurelink does not have authority from First American to serve as the
agent for First American for purposes of a nonjudicial foreclosure without the
prior written consent of First American, and is authorized to sign documents
only as the agent of First American. Unless specifically agreed upon in writing
for a limited purpose, Foreclosurelink does not have a power of attorney to
execute documents on behalf of First American in connection with any
nonjudicial foreclosure sale.

12
Id., ¶8. Yet again, Ms. Townsend does not provide the Court with the documentation
13
14

evidencing the “specifically agreed upon” terms of Mr. Buse’s foreclosure sale to support her

15

assertions, these “specific” documents which give Defendant ForeclosureLink these particular

16

powers nor the “limited” power of attorney. Id. Instead, both Defendants ForeclosureLink and

17

First American just ask this Court to rely upon the assertions of these corporate officers rather

18
19

than actually providing the documentation.
In contradiction to the assertions made in Paragraph 8, Ms. Townsend, in Paragraph 9,

20
21
22

begins by stating that it was Defendant ForeclosureLink which first contacted Defendant First
American about the trustee’s sale which Mr. Block needed to have conducted. Id., ¶9. This

23

information is also provided by Mr. Jeffers, whose affidavit is virtually identical to that

24

presented by Ms. Townsend except for the reversal of roles – she is testifying for Defendant

25

ForeclosureLink and he for First American. Jeffers Aff. Still, both Ms. Townsend and Mr.

Jeffers both assert that it was Defendant ForeclosureLink – the purported agent – who

contacted Defendant First American about conducting a foreclosure sale in the State of

2

Washington. In Ms. Townsend’s Affidavit on behalf of Defendant ForecloosureLink she does

3

not assert that it is authorized under Washington law to conduct foreclosure sales except by

4
way of its purported agency relationship with Defendant First American. ForeclosureLink Aff.,

¶7-9. Mr. Jeffers, on the other hand, does assert that Defendant First American is authorized to

conduct foreclosure sales in the State of Washington based upon its licensing as a title

9
10
11

Both of the Affidavits of Ms. Townsend and Mr. Jeffers also assert that all work on the
foreclosure was done by Defendant ForeclosureLink, except for a title insurance guaranty
issued by Defendant First American, which Defendant ForeclosureLink used to obtain

12
addresses for notification. ForeclosureLink Aff., ¶9-14; Jeffers Aff., ¶9-17. Further, while Mr.
13
14

Jeffers makes blanket assertions about his maintenance and familiarity with the records of

15

Defendant First American as it pertains to Mr. Buse’s foreclosure, the majority of his testimony

16

is about the work that Defendant ForeclosureLink undertook and performed, and he does not

17

provide any description regarding how he or Defendant First American has any personal

18
19

knowledge about what Defendant ForeclosureLink did or did not do in connection with this
particular foreclosure sale(s). Id. Mr. Jeffers does not report that he has access to Defendant

ForeclosureLink’s records. He does not report that these defendants share a record keeping

how it is that Defendant First American allegedly came into possession of a document, such

3

that it could maintain it in its files for purposes of now providing it to the Court, if it was

4
properly returned to Defendant ForeclosureLink.
5
6

As noted in the Amended Complaint, Defendant ForeclosureLink’s employees were the

7

only persons who signed the foreclosure documents, and its contact information is the only

8

information on any of the foreclosure documents. Ms. Townsend tries to provide this Court

9

with an expert opinion about the “use of agents to assist in the preparation and delivery of

10
11

nonjudicial foreclosure notices is common for nonjudicial foreclosures processed within the
State of Washington.” ForeclosureLink Aff., ¶16. Since Ms. Townsend has not been proffered

12
as an expert witness, her testimony on this subject should also be stricken. It may also be
13
14

interpreted as Ms. Townsend’s attempt to instruct this Court as to the proper interpretation of

15

the law of the State of Washington, which is a decision left entirely to this Court and not to Ms.

16

Townsend. Mr. Jeffers also attempts to similarly instruct this Court and/or provide

17

undesignated expert testimony about “common practices” in Washington state. Jeffers Aff.,

18
19

¶19. More importantly though, the Defendants are choosing to ignore that even if their actions
have become “common practice” in the State of Washington, it does not mean that they are in

conformity with the law of the State.

Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, affidavits, depositions and

drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Wilson v.
Steinbach, 98 Wn.2d 434, 437, 656 P.2d 1030 (1982). The court should grant
the motion only if, from all of the evidence, reasonable persons could reach but
one conclusion. Id.

19

A court should not resolve a genuine issue of credibility at a summary judgment

20

hearing. Amend v. Bell, 89 Wn.2d 124, 129, 570 P.2d 138, 95 A.L.R.3d 225 (1977). An issue

21

of credibility is present when the party opposing the summary judgment motion comes forward

22

with evidence which contradicts or impeaches the movant's evidence on a material issue.

Defendant ForeclosureLink has attempted to evade the requirements for acting as a
trustee in the State of Washington by using Defendant First American as a “front”, since it is a
title insurance company licensed in the State of Washington and therefore it would be able to

4
act as a trustee. RCW 61.24.010. The relevant portion of the Deed of Trust Act (“DTA”)
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

specifies quite clearly who may act as a foreclosing trustee. It states, in pertinent part:
(1) The trustee of a deed of trust under this chapter shall be:
(a)
Any domestic corporation authorized to insure title to real
property under the laws of this state, or its agents; or
(b)
Any title insurance company authorized to ensure title to real
property under the laws of this state, or its agents; or . . .
RCW 61.24.010.
Defendant First American, as a licensed title insurance company, does not qualify as a

12
trustee under these provisions, but Defendant ForeclosureLink (which is not even licensed to
13
14

engage in business in this state) is not so authorized. Huelsman Dec., ¶3. RCW

15

61.24.010(a)(b) allows the “agent” of a title insurance company to act on its behalf, but

16

“agents” for title insurance companies are defined under that licensing statute. RCW 48.17, et

17

seq. Under RCW 48.17.010(15) a “title insurance agent” is defined as “a business entity

18
19

licensed under the laws of this state and appointed by an authorized title insurance company to
sell, solicit or negotiate insurance on behalf of the title insurance company.” Further, RCW

20
21
22

48.29.160 verifies that, “To be licensed as [an] agent of a title insurer, the applicant must own
or lease and maintain a complete set of tract indexes of the county or counties in which such

23

agent will do business.” There is no indication whatsoever that Defendant ForeclosureLink has

24

such an index in King County, or even that it has any business address located in the State of

25

Washington. It is clear that Defendant ForeclosureLink – the actual foreclosing trustee – is not

26

authorized to act as a trustee in the State of Washington and its “agent” status with Defendant

First American does not meet the criteria defined in the statute and is nothing more than a

2

sham.

3

Supporting Mr. Buse’s position as to the correct interpretation of the meaning of the

4
word “agent” in the DTA is an amendment made to the DTA by the Washington Legislature
5
6

this year. The Bill to amend the DTA, HB 5810, was passed by both the House of

7

Representatives and the Senate, and is currently being forwarded to Governor Gregoire for

8

signature. See, Huelsman Dec., ¶4. A copy of the history of the Bill, the Bill itself which was

9

approved by both houses of the Washington Legislature, and the last Senate Bill Report to the

10

Senate about the Bill and its history are attached to the Huelsman Declaration as Exhibit “1”.

11

Page 10 of the Bill shows the change that was made to the DTA to clarify the intent of the

12
Legislature in using the word “agent” in RCW 61.24.010(b), which refers only to a “title
13
14

insurance agent as defined under chapter 48.17 RCW, not in a more generic use of the word in

15

a legal context. The DTA, once signed by Governor Gregoire, will now clearly state that in

16

order for a title insurance company to use an “agent” to conduct foreclosure sales in the State of

17

Washington, that “agent” must also be licensed in this State. Id. The Senate Bill Report

18
19

discusses in detail some of the more complex changes to the DTA and states, regarding the
other more minor changes to the DTA such as the “agent” definition, that they were “changes

20
21
22

for clarification”. Id. Again, this supports Mr. Buse’s position in this case.
This too is consistent with the rest of the portion of the DTA devoted to identifying

23

those persons or entities who may engage in the business of acting as a foreclosing trustee.

24

RCW 61.24.010(1) specifies that a foreclosing trustee must be:

25
26

(a) “a domestic corporation incorporated under Title 23B, 30, 31, 32 or 33 RCW
of which at least one officer is a Washington resident”; or
(b) a title insurance company or title insurance agent; or
(c) an attorney who is licensed to practice in the State of Washington; or

(d) a professional corporation or limited liability company owned and operated
by attorneys licensed to practice in the State of Washington; or
(e) any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government; or
(f) “any national bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association chartered
under the laws of the United States”.

4
RCW 61.24.010(1) (emphasis added). Clearly, the Washington Legislature was quite
5
6

concerned with foreclosing trustees being Washington state residents and having a physical

7

presence in the state. RCW 61.24.010(1)(a). The only entities which may be a foreclosing

8

trustee without being licensed by the State of Washington in some fashion are federal

9

government agencies and national banks (and clearly these entities cannot be regulated by the

10

state). If the Washington Legislature had intended to allow out-of-state entities like Defendant

11

ForeclosureLink to conduct foreclosures in this state, it would have included language allowing

12
them to so operate. It specifically declined to do so, and just amended the DTA to “clarify”
13
14

that the relationship in which these defendants have admittedly engaged are prohibited.

16

1.
The Deed of Trust Act requires that the foreclosing entity and its agent,
the trustee, conform exactly to the requirements of the statute in conducting a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.

17

When the Washington Legislature enacted the DTA permitting non-judicial

15

18
19

foreclosures rather than requiring lenders to file a lawsuit in order to obtain title to a residential
property following default by a homeowner, they carefully crafted a process which contained

20
21
22

“safeguards” for the homeowner and explicit requirements for conducting a foreclosure sale.
RCW 61.24, et seq. Nowhere in the DTA is there language excusing the foreclosing trustee

23

from complying with its requirements if the trustee responsibilities are inconvenient. RCW

24

61.24, et seq. As noted by the Court in Queen City Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Mannhalt, 111

25

Wn.2d 503, 760 P.2d 350 (1988), citing to 1 V. Towne, Wash. Prac. § 605 (2d ed. 1976),

fiduciary duty imposed upon a trustee is exceedingly high.” Cox v. Helenius, 103 Wn.2d 383,

3

693 P.2d 683 (1985). As noted by the dissent in Queen City,

4
5
6
7

Relatively unsophisticated borrowers used to be able to rely on the judiciary to prevent
overreaching by lenders who make it their business to obtain every advantage from the
foreclosure process. See, RCW 61.12. Since the judiciary is not involved in deed of
trust foreclosures under the Act, only the words of the Act itself stand between the
borrower and the lender eager to foreclose. Unless we strictly construe the Act, that
protection will erode away to zero.

8
Queen City, supra, at 515.
9
10

The Washington DTA has three objectives: (1) that the nonjudicial foreclosure process

11

remains efficient and inexpensive; (2) that the process provides an adequate opportunity for

12

interested parties to prevent wrongful foreclosure; and (3) that the process promotes the

13

stability of land titles. Cox v. Helenius, supra, at 387. “Because the deed of trust foreclosure

14
15

process is conducted without review or confirmation by a court, the fiduciary duty imposed on
the trustee is exceedingly high.” Id. at 388-89. In Cox, the Washington Supreme Court noted

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23

that even if the plaintiffs had not properly acted to restrain the sale, it would have nevertheless
been voided because of the trustee’s action. Id. The Cox Court noted:
Washington courts do not require a trustee to make sure that a grantor is protecting his
or her own interest. However, a trustee of a deed of trust is a fiduciary for both the
mortgagee and mortgagor and must act impartially between them. G. Osborne, G.
Nelson & D. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law § 7.21 (1979).
The trustee is bound by his office to present the sale under every possible
advantage to the debtor as well as to the creditor. He is bound to use not
only good faith but also every requisite degree of diligence in conducting the
sale and to attend equally to the interest of the debtor and creditor alike.

Cox at 389 (emphasis added). The same standard should be applied here. Defendant First

4

American may have been properly appointed as the foreclosing trustee, but it did not act as the

5

trustee in conformity with the statute. Instead, Defendant First American was completely

6

uninvolved in the foreclosure process except for providing a trustee’s sale guarantee and the

7

only entity involved in conducting the foreclosure was Defendant ForeclosureLink, in

8
contravention of the requirements of the DTA. In the case of Udall v. T.D. Escrow Services,

10

Inc., 130 P.3d 908, 911 (Wash. Ct. App. 2006), rev’d on other grounds, 154 P.3d 882 (Wash.

11

2007), the Court of Appeals reiterated the obligations of a trustee in a foreclosure and reminded

12

us of the requirements of the DTA, which include “an opportunity for interested parties to

13

prevent wrongful foreclosure.” Id. at 911. Here, “interested parties”, such as Mr. Buse, was

14
15

required to take action to stop the foreclosure in order to prevent a foreclosure from being
conducted by an unlicensed out of state entity, Defendant ForeclosureLink.

16
RCW 61.24.030(4) provides in part that a nonjudicial foreclosure cannot be held unless

17
18

all of its requirements have been met. Courts universally hold nonjudicial foreclosures of

19

deeds of trust by unauthorized persons void. 27 Cal. Jur. 3d Deeds of Trust § 260 (1987). Hall

20

v. Crowley, 12 Cal. App. 30, 33, 106 P. 426 (1909) states the obvious:

21

Numerous authorities are cited and discussed by appellants’ counsel to the point
that “a sale under a deed of trust by a person not authorized to act is void” – a
proposition so elementary that it should be known to every student before he is
admitted to practice.

3

& Loan Ass’n, 118 Ariz. 473, 477, 578 P.2d 152 (1978) best states the reasons for this rule:

4
A mortgage generally may be foreclosed only by filing a civil action
while, under a Deed of Trust, the trustee holds a power of sale permitting
him to sell the property out of Court with no necessity of judicial action.
The Deed of Trust statutes thus strip borrowers of many of the
protections available under a mortgage. Therefore, lenders must strictly
comply with the Deed of Trust statutes, and the statutes and Deeds of
Trust must be strictly construed in favor of the borrower.

Id.
Defendant First American, as the foreclosing trustee, had a statutorily defined duty to
Mr. Buse under the DTA. The specific nature of the duty had been defined by the Washington

12
Supreme Court’s decision in Cox, supra, at 388. The DTA was amended in 2008 to require that
13
14

the trustee act “impartially” as between the borrower, grantor and beneficiary, and it is again

15

being amended this year to require that the trustee “has a duty of good faith” to the parties.

16

RCW 61.24.010(4). In most states, “a trustee is treated as a fiduciary for both the borrower and

17

the lender.” 13 Baxter & Dunaway, The Law of Distressed Real Estate (Clark Boardman

18
19

Company, Ltd., November 1990). In McPherson v. Purdue, 21 Wn. App. 450, 452-3, 585 P.2d
830 (1978), the court approved the following statement describing the duties of a trustee from

23
24
25
26

California law:
Among those duties is that of bringing “the property to the hammer under every
possible advantage to his cestui que trusts,” using all reasonable diligence to obtain the
best price.
Id. at 452-3. Similarly, the Court in Cox, supra, adopted the following view:
Because the deed of trust foreclosure process is conducted without review or
confrontation by a court, the fiduciary duty imposed upon the trustee is “exceedingly
high”.

Id. The Cox Court also found that the four primary duties of the trustee were that he is bound

2

by his office to use diligence in presenting the sale under every possible advantage to the debtor

3

and creditor; trustee make take reasonable and appropriate steps top avoid sacrifice of the

4
debtor’s property and interest; once a course of conduct is undertaken that is reasonably

abandoned without notice to the grantor; and when an actual conflict of interest arises between

the roles of attorney for the beneficiary and trustee, the attorney should withdraw from one

9

position in order to prevent a breach of fiduciary duty. Id. Here, Defendants ForeclosureLink

10

and First American appear to have taken very intentional steps to create the false appearance of

11

complying with the statute (DTA) and have even gone so far as to falsely assert to this Court

12
that their actions are in conformity with the statute, while not reporting on its actual

C.
Even if the Court is uncertain yet whether the actions of Defendants
ForeclosureLink and First American violate the requirements of the DTA, there are genuine
issues of material fact as to nature and contents of the agreement between Defendants
ForeclosureLink and First American.
As noted above, Mr. Buse maintains that these defendants did not meet their burden of

19

proof sufficient to obtain a summary judgment order from this Court as there remain genuine

20

issues of material fact. Neither of these defendants have provided this Court with the

21

documentary evidence to support a myriad of the assertions they make through the testimony of

22

their employees, and there are numerous contradictions in the testimony, as discussed in the

Facts section above. Specifically, the “agency” agreements which govern the relationship

defendants caused him emotional distress because their actions go beyond the bounds of

2

decency.

3

Under the standard articulated by the Washington Supreme Court in Kloepfel v. Bokor,

4
149 Wn.2d 192, 196, 66 P.3d 630 (2003), symptoms resulting from a significant stress matter
5
6

meet the standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage. The potential loss

7

of one’s home to foreclosure can certainly engender this sort of response. The tort of outrage is

8

committed when a defendant engages in conduct that is “so outrageous in character, and so

9

extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as

10
11

atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community” will constitute intentional infliction
of emotional distress. Id. (quoting Grimsby v. Samson, 85 Wn.2d 52, 59, 530 P.2d 291

12
(1975)), (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts §46 cmt. d); see also, Reid v. Pierce County,

15

1002 (1989); Rice v. Janovich, 109 Wn.2d 48, 61, 742 P.2d 1230 (1987). Emotional distress

symptomatology is defined in the Restatement of Torts as including “all highly unpleasant

17

mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger,

19

chagrin, disappointment, worry and nausea.”
Mr. Buse can prove his claim of “slander of title” against these defendants because they

20
21
22

made false statements about the nature of their relationship to the title to his property.
Specifically, Defendant First American was appointed the trustee and then allowed Defendant

23

ForeclosureLink to act as the trustee under the false assertion that it was an “agent” of

24

Defendant First American, when in fact it was not an “agent” either under the definition in the

DTA or under a generic definition of an “agent”. Defendant ForeclosureLink initiated the

617 P.2d 704 (1980).

9

Mr. Buse’s cause of action for breach of fiduciary is among his primary claims and is

10

the clearest of all claims, based upon the facts and law as described above. Defendants First

11

American and ForeclosureLink, as its purported agent, acting as the trustee under a Deed of

12
Trust signed by Mr. Buse, breached their duties to him by way of the non-compliance with the
13
14

requirements of the DTA. In essence, the defendants assert that because Mr. Buse was in

15

default at various times in this process, he cannot be harmed by their intentional breach of their

16

duties to him and the requirement that they adhere to the terms of the DTA. This argument is

17

nonsensical. These defendants’ duties to Mr. Buse only mattered once he defaulted and a

18
19

foreclosure sale was being initiated. The trustee only acts to enforce the terms of the Deed of
Trust after a default has occurred. It makes no sense at all to assert that a trustee may breach

20
21
22

its duty to act in conformity with the DTA if the borrower has defaulted because it does not act
until the default occurs, yet this is essentially the argument being made by the Defendants. And

23

flowing from this breach of fiduciary duty is Mr. Buse’s claim for violations of the Consumer

24

Protection Act, RCW 19.86, et seq. The actions of Defendants ForeclosureLink and First

25

American were not limited to Mr. Buse’s foreclosure sale. As evidenced by the Affidavits filed

26

in support of their Summary Judgment Motions, these defendants have been continuously and

1

repeatedly acting in contravention of the requirements of the Deed of Trust Act. These acts do

2

constitute an unfair and deceptive act or practice such that it caused damage to Mr. Buse’s

3

property by falsely asserting Defendant ForeclosureLink had the legal authority to conduct the

4
foreclosure sale.
5
6

The Consumer Protection Act (“CPA”) declares unlawful “unfair or deceptive acts in

7

the conduct of any trade or commerce.” RCW 19.86.020. The CPA defines “trade or

8

commerce” broadly, to include “sale of assets or services, and any commerce directly or

9

indirectly affecting the people of the state of Washington.” RCW 19.86.010(2). The CPA

10
11

expressly confirms its provisions “shall be liberally construed” to fulfill its objective of
protecting the public against “unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent acts or practices.” RCW

12
19.86.920. The CPA is subject to enforcement by the Attorney General, by other state
13
14

governmental entities, and by private individuals. RCW 19.86.080, 090.

15

To establish a private CPA claim, the plaintiff must generally establish the following

16

five elements: (i) that the defendant committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice; (ii) that

17

the act or practice occurred in the scope of trade or commerce; (iii) that the act or practice

18
19

affects the public interest; (iv) that the plaintiff suffered injury; and (v) that the injury was
caused by the act or practice. See, Cashmere Valley Bank v. Brender, 116 P.3d 421 (2005); see

20
21
22

also, Jeckle v. Crotty, 120 Wn. App. 374; 85 P.3d 931 (2004); Micro Enhancement Intern, Inc.
v. Coopers & Lynbrand, LLP, 110 Wn. App. 412; 40 P.3d 1206 (2002). Whether a given

23

practice is “unfair or deceptive” is a normally a question for the finder of fact. Burbo v. Harley

24

C. Douglass, Inc., 125 Wn. App. 684; 106 P.3d 258 (2005); see also, Guijosa v. Wal-Mart

25

1

profits, speed along the foreclosure sale and benefit each other rather than acting in conformity

2

with the DTA.

3

The next element in a CPA claim is showing that the act occurred in the course of trade

4
or commerce. This element generally requires some sort of commercial relationship between
5
6

the defendant and the homeowner. See, Merchant v. Peterson, 38 Wn. App. 855, 860; 690 P.2d

7

1192 (1984); see also, Holiday Resort Community Association v. Echo Lake Associates, LLC,

8

135 P.3d 499, 504 (2006). However, there does not need to be privity of contract or a specific

9

contractual relationship between the parties. Holiday Resort at 504. Here, it is clear that these

10

Defendants engaged in the challenged wrongful acts in the course of “trade or commerce” – the

11

servicing of a mortgage loan and the completion of a foreclosure sale under the terms of the

12
Note and Deed of Trust. RCW 19.86.010(2).
13
14

The next element in a private CPA claim is showing that the unfair or deceptive act

15

“impacts the public interest.” Whether the practice impacts the public interest is also a question

16

of fact, but is generally determined according to such factors as (i) whether the acts were

17

committed in the course of the defendant’s business; (ii) whether the defendant advertised to

18
19

the general public; (iii) whether the defendant actively solicited the plaintiff or others; and (iv)
whether the defendant occupied a superior bargaining position to the plaintiff. Cotton v.

20
21
22

Kronenberg, 111 Wn. App. 258, 274; 44 P.3d 878 (2002). These, and potentially other relevant
factors, are to be viewed in light of the context and circumstances in which the alleged unfair or

23

deceptive practices took place. Cotton at 274. In this case, it is clear that the regular unfair and

24

deceptive actions evidenced herein by these Defendants would have an impact upon the public

25

interest since they regularly engage in the improper and illegal foreclosures against Washington

26

state residential properties. Their actions are part of a regular course of business practices

which will result in wrongful foreclosures and improper loan servicing of other individuals in

2

this state. To be blunt – they must be stopped.

3

Another more recent case of importance in determining liability under the CPA is the

4
Washington Supreme Court’s decision in Indoor Billboard v. Integra Telecom, 162 Wn.2d 59;
5
6
7

170 P.3d 10 (2007), where the Court held that the “proximate cause” standard should be
applied to CPA claims. The Court found:
We conclude where a defendant has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or
practice, and there has been an affirmative misrepresentation of fact, our case
law establishes that there must be some demonstration of a causal link between
the misrepresentation and the plaintiff's injury. Indoor Billboard urges us to
adopt a per se rule and hold that payment of Integra's invoice is per se sufficient
to establish the proximate cause of plaintiff's damages. We reject Indoor
Billboard's per se rule because mere payment of an invoice may not establish a
causal connection between the unfair or deceptive act or practice and plaintiff's
damages. Proximate cause is a factual question to be decided by the trier of fact.
Payment of an invoice may or may not be sufficient to establish a causal
connection between the misrepresentation of fact and damages, but payment of
the invoice may be considered with all other relevant evidence on the issue of
proximate cause.

8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

We hold that the proximate cause standard embodied in WPI 15.01 is required to
establish the causation element in a CPA claim. A plaintiff must establish that,
but for the defendant's unfair or deceptive practice, the plaintiff would not have
suffered an injury.

Id. at 84.

CONCLUSION

21
22

Based upon the foregoing, Mr. Buse maintains that Defendants ForeclosureLink and
First American have not met their burden required to obtain a summary judgment order because

23
the Washington DTA clearly requires conformity with all of its requirements and these
24
25
26

defendants have not complied with the statute. Moreover, there are other genuine issues of
material fact which are in dispute and which must be reserved for determination by the trier of
fact.
