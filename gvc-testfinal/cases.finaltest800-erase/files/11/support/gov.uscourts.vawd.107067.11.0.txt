Civil Action No. 6:17cv00034

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS
BY THE BLUE RIDGE REGIONAL JAIL AUTHORITY
Defendant Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority, by counsel, submits this memorandum in
support of its motion to dismiss this action by plaintiff Katherine Painter. It is respectfully
submitted that the Complaint fails to state any claim against Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority.
ALLEGATIONS
The Complaint allegations show that immediately upon plaintiff “call[ing] the Prison
Rape Elimination Act (‘PREA’) hotline” and reporting that she had been assaulted to
administrators for Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority: (1) the plaintiff was transferred to a
different facility, where she does not allege that she had any problems; (2) a criminal
investigation was opened of the plaintiff’s report of assault; and (3) Timothy Farrar was arrested
the same day the police interviewed him.1
The Complaint shows no basis for considering Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority to
have done anything wrong.
The plaintiff nevertheless claims, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that her “constitutional

right to be free from unlawful sexual harassment, abuse, and assault” and “cruel and unusual
punishment while imprisoned at the Lynchburg Adult Detention Facility” were violated not just
by Farrar, but also by the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority.2
“[P]leading hypothetically and in the alternative,”3 plaintiff asserts a “COUNT II-§1983Monell” claim against Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority.4 In an effort to pursue a claim against
Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority, however, plaintiff merely ticks off a list of boilerplate,
formulaic conclusions, “[u]pon information and belief,” that are devoid of facts to state any claim
against the Authority.5
It is respectfully submitted that the facts the plaintiff alleges, as opposed to her conclusory
assertions that are entitled to no weight even on a motion to dismiss, provide no basis for liability
on the part of Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority.
The Complaint alleges that on April 1, 2015, the plaintiff was sent to the Lynchburg
Adult Detention Center “to serve time.”6 The Complaint alleges that defendant Farrar was a

Complaint ¶¶ 112-13. The Complaint includes cryptic phrases referring to “related state
law claims” (Complaint ¶ 6) and “supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims” (Id. ¶
7), but plaintiff has not included any state law claims in her Complaint, and the statute of
limitations for any such state law claims has long passed. See Va. Code § 8.01-243.2; Lucas v.
Woody, 287 Va. 354, 363, 756 S.E.2d 447, 451 (2014); Gemaehlich v. Johnson, 2013 WL

correctional officer who worked the night shift at the Lynchburg Adult Detention Center,
operated by the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority.7
On April 24 and May 2, 2015, the Complaint alleges that Farrar engaged in sexual
conduct with plaintiff that Farrar coerced.8 “Approximately two days” later, Farrar “requested
oral sex, which Plaintiff refused because she had spoken with her significant other and ‘knew
[she] didn’t have to listen anymore.’”9 The Complaint alleges that defendant Lynchburg Adult
Detention Center correctional officer Pitts was also working the night of April 24, 2015, “seated
at a nearby desk using a computer” when Farrar entered the plaintiff’s cell and assaulted her.10
The Complaint alleges that, “After these assaults, Plaintiff feared reporting Farrar to his
fellow Correctional Officer because she feared she would be transferred to another jail and
retaliated against by Defendant Farrar’s friends and family.”11
The Complaint alleges that “[s]ometime between April 24, 2015 and May 7, 2015,” the
plaintiff asked a Lynchburg Adult Detention Center correctional officer “what she should do if
she had ‘a problem’ with a guard,” and the officer “told her that he did not want to be involved
because he did not ‘want to have to come to court.’”12

“Sometime between May 2, 2015 and May 10, 2015, Plaintiff’s mother and significant
other visited Plaintiff in the Lynchburg Adult Detention Facility, and Plaintiff reported her sexual
assaults to them,” the Complaint alleges.13 The Complaint alleges that the plaintiff also “wrote a
letter to fellow inmate Meredith Lee, referring to the assaults she experienced.”14
The Complaint alleges that, “On May 5, 2015, a Sergeant Polk sent a memo addressed to
‘All Intake Officers,’ stating that Sergeant Polk was aware that intake officers had been granting
‘special privileges’ to Plaintiff and holding ‘long conversations’ with her.”15 The Complaint
alleges that on May 7, 2015, the plaintiff “made a written request to speak with a Lieutenant
Rivers, the Internal Affairs Investigator for the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority,” which a
Lynchburg Adult Detention Center correctional officer Woody retrieved and brought to the
intake desk. The Complaint alleges that Farrar “confronted Plaintiff, informing her that
Defendant Woody [sic] did not want to turn the requests in to Lt. Rivers or send them up the
chain of command.”16
On Friday, “May 8, 2015, Plaintiff called the Prison Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”)
hotline and reported her sexual assaults.”17

On Monday, “May 11th, 2015, after a meeting with administrators for Defendant Blue
Ridge Regional Jail Authority at which Plaintiff described her sexual assault, Plaintiff was
transferred to the Amherst Adult Detention Center,” where plaintiff does not allege she had any
problems.18
“After Plaintiff’s reports of sexual assault, an investigation was opened by the City of
Lynchburg Police Department and Blue Ridge Regional Jail Internal Affairs.”19
The Complaint alleges that “[o]n May 13, 2015, Defendant Farrar” was interviewed by a
City of Lynchburg Police Detective and “immediately placed under arrest for carnal knowledge

rather than May 13.21
The Complaint alleges that during his interview by the Police Detective, Farrar said that
“he was aware of instances in the past at Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority in which
correctional officers had had sexual contact with inmates.”22 The Complaint alleges that there
had previously been one complaint about Farrar from a female inmate, on December 23, 2014,
with that inmate having allegedly complained that Farrar “asked her to unzip her jacket and to
show Farrar the tattoo on her stomach, and that Defendant Farrar made a remark about the inmate
‘flashing’ him,” and that Farrar said to that inmate that “she owed the jail a fee of $1.00, and that
Farrar and the inmate could ‘take it out in trade.”23

Lynchburg Adult Detention Center had ended immediately upon his arrest.24
The Complaint lists nothing but a scattershot of cryptic and vague conclusions – not
shown by the facts alleged – in an effort to pursue a claim that Blue Ridge Regional Jail
Authority should be held liable for purported “unconstitutional customs, practices, and/or
policies[.]”25
It is respectfully submitted that plaintiff’s allegations show no basis for a claim against
the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority, and this action should be dismissed as against the
Authority.
ARGUMENT
I.

Standards On Motion To Dismiss
As the United States Supreme Court has stressed, “A pleading that offers ‘labels and

conclusions’ or a ‘formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do’.”Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555
(2007). A claim against a particular defendant cannot survive a motion to dismiss unless “the
plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the
defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.
A claim that is not supported by “[f]actual allegations . . . enough to raise a right to relief
above the speculative level” cannot survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Twombly, 550

U.S. at 555. “Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s
liability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of “entitlement to relief”’.”
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557.
In recent years, the United States Supreme Court has stressed the imperative of courts
conducting a penetrating evaluation of complaints at the outset, reflecting the “policy that
plaintiffs may proceed into the litigation process only when their complaints are justified by both
law and fact.” Francis v. Giacomelli, 588 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 2009) (discussing “the high
costs of frivolous litigation” and “the recognized problems created by ‘strike suits’” in recent
years, for the Supreme Court’s emphasis on early evaluation of complaints).
Indeed, the Complaint allegations “upon information and belief” with respect to the Blue
Ridge Regional Jail Authority are especially insufficient under the prevailing pleading standards.
“[P]laintiff’s allegations upon ‘information and belief’ [are] ‘exactly the type of pleading that
Iqbal and Twombly sought to foreclose’.” Gemaehlich v. Johnson, 2013 WL 589234 *3 (W.D.
Va. 2013) (dismissing claim), aff’d, 599 F. App’x 473 (4th Cir. 2014), citing Skillstorm, Inc. v.
Elec. Data Sys., LLC, 666 F. Supp. 2d 610, 619–20 (E.D. Va. 2009).
As the United States Supreme Court emphasized in Iqbal, “the question presented by a
motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed
upon the discovery process,” and “‘[i]t is no answer to say that a claim just shy of a plausible
entitlement to relief can, if groundless, be weeded out early in the discovery process through
careful case management’[.]” 556 U.S. at 684-85.
It is respectfully submitted that plaintiff fails to state a claim against Blue Ridge Regional
Jail Authority.

II.

Plaintiff Fails To State A Claim Against Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority
Plaintiff fails to state a claim against the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority, and it

respectfully submitted that this action should be dismissed for the independently-sufficient
reasons set forth below.
a. Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority Is Not A “Person” Subject to § 1983 Liability
Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides:
Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or
usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to
be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured . . . .
Numerous decisions have held that Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority is not a “person”
subject to liability under § 1983. Newman v. Blue Ridge Reg’l Jail Auth., 2009 WL 1468807 *1
(W.D. Va. 2009) (plaintiff “fails to state a claim against the Lynchburg Adult Detention Center
and Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority because these entities are not persons subject to suit
under § 1983"); Dammones v. Lynchburg Adult Detention Center, 2012 WL 6566684 *1 (W.D.
Va. 2012) (“Neither the Jail nor a group of person, like the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authorities,
is a ‘person’ subject to 42 U.S.C. § 1983"); Scott v. Blue Ridge Reg’l Auth., 2005 WL 2429759
*1 (W.D. Va. 2005) (the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority is not subject to suit under § 1983,
dismissing the claims against it), appeal dismissed, 201 F. App’x (4th Cir. 2006); Nowlin v.
Harris, 2006 WL 2434965 *2 (W.D. Va. 2006) (plaintiff has no basis for a claim against Blue
Ridge Regional Jail Authority, which is not a “person” subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983);
Sprinkle v. Blue Ridge Jail Auth., 2006 WL 1867332 *1 (W.D. Va. June 30, 2006) (“Because the
Jail Authority is not a ‘person’ amenable to suit under § 1983, any claims against the Jail
9

Case 6:17-cv-00034-NKM-RSB Document 11 Filed 06/09/17 Page 9 of 19 Pageid#: 47

Authority must be dismissed”).26
It is respectfully submitted that the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority should therefore
be dismissed as a defendant in this action.
b. Plaintiff’s Allegations Do Not Show “§1983-Monell”
Liability On The Part Of Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority
Even if the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority were considered to be a “person” subject
to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiff’s allegations do not show a basis for “§ 1983-Monell”
liability such as plaintiff asserts in Count II of her Complaint.
The law is well-settled that there is no basis for vicarious liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983
for the alleged violations of others. Thus, while in the caption of the Complaint plaintiff refers to
Farrar and Pitts each as “an Agent of the Blue Ridge Jail Authority,” and plaintiff alleges that
Farrar and Pitts were employed by Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority, Complaint ¶¶ 114, 115,
that provides no basis for liability on the part of Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority under §
1983.
As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held in Ross v. Reed, 719
F.2d 689, 698 (4th Cir. 1983), “respondeat superior liability has no place in § 1983
jurisprudence.”

26

Accord Bowen v. New River Valley Reg’l Jail, 2006 WL 3327622 *1, 3 (W.D. Va.
2006) (granting motion to dismiss of New River Valley Regional Jail Authority because it “is not
a ‘person’ for purposes of § 1983"); Stilwell v. Southwest Virginia Reg’l Jail Auth., 2006 WL
2524076 *1 n.1 (W.D. Va. 2006) (“Southwest Regional Jail Authority is not a ‘person’ and
therefore, is not a proper defendant in a § 1983 action”).
To the extent this basis for dismissal were considered to implicate the subject matter
jurisdiction of this federal court, the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority has included that the
motion to dismiss is made pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(1) as well as Rule 12(b)(6).
10

Case 6:17-cv-00034-NKM-RSB Document 11 Filed 06/09/17 Page 10 of 19 Pageid#: 48

Under § 1983, governmental entities are not liable under the theory of respondeat
superior for unconstitutional conduct by their employees. See Monell v. Dep’t of
Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978).
Lavender v. City of Roanoke Sheriff’s Office, 826 F. Supp. 2d 928, 934 (W.D. Va. 2011).
A municipality “may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its
employees or agents,” because it is only when the “official policy[] inflicts the injury that the
government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.” Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436
U.S. at 694. The “official policy” must be “the moving force” causing the alleged constitutional
violation. Id.
With respect to plaintiff’s claim against the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority,
plaintiff’s Complaint takes the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink conclusory pleading approach –
with a myriad of speculative, vague, and conclusory alternative variations referred to as
“unconstitutional customs, practices, and/or policies,” or “an expressly adopted official policy or
a longstanding practice or custom,” or “actual and/or constructive knowledge of the deficient
policies, practices and customs alleged,”27 in an apparent effort to cover all bases for any
conceivable sort of potential municipal liability.
The scattershot of conclusory assertions and buzzwords plaintiff invokes does not mask
that the actual facts alleged do not show a basis for a claim against Blue Ridge Regional Jail
Authority. “While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be
supported by factual allegations.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. Plaintiff’s conclusions are not
supported by factual allegations sufficient to make out any claim of municipal liability on the part
of Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority, however.

11

Case 6:17-cv-00034-NKM-RSB Document 11 Filed 06/09/17 Page 11 of 19 Pageid#: 49

Peeling away the layers of conclusory allegations that “are not entitled to the assumption
of truth,” and examining what remains, as Iqbal instructs, shows no basis for holding the Blue
Ridge Regional Jail Authority liable for the incidents of Farrar’s alleged misconduct with the
plaintiff in April and May 2015. Plaintiff does not allege that there was a specific written policy
or policies, or the language of any such policy, that plaintiff claims violated her constitutional
rights. Nor does plaintiff allege facts showing any unwritten policy or custom of Blue Ridge
Regional Jail Authority that caused the alleged violation of her constitutional rights, nor that the
alleged violation was caused by the conduct of a final policymaker.
A policy is a “Course of action consciously chosen from among various
alternatives respecting basic governmental functions, as opposed to episodic
exercise of discretion in the operational details of government.” A custom exists
when the “persistent and widespread” practices of government officials are “so
permanent and well-settled as to [have] the force of law.”
Lavender v. City of Roanoke Sheriff’s Office, 826 F. Supp. 2d at 935 n.4 (dismissing claims
against sheriff’s office) (internal citations omitted, other alterations in original).
Far from showing that Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority had any “persistent or
widespread” practice or any chosen policy that caused plaintiff’s violation, plaintiff’s allegations
show that as soon as plaintiff made Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority aware of the incidents, it
took immediate action. Plaintiff was immediately transferred to another facility for her
protection, the matter was investigated and turned over to law enforcement, and Farrar was
prosecuted.
The only other incident to which the Complaint refers is an alleged incident in 2014
involving Farrar and a female inmate, in which Farrar allegedly asked the inmate to show him the
tattoo on her stomach and make a remark about her “‘flashing’ him,” and the inmate complained
12

Case 6:17-cv-00034-NKM-RSB Document 11 Filed 06/09/17 Page 12 of 19 Pageid#: 50

that Farrar told her she “owed the jail a fee of $1.00, and that Farrar and the inmate could ‘take it
out in trade.’” The inmate is alleged to have said that she “felt [terrified’ and ‘vulnerable’.” The
Complaint does not allege that the other female inmate even had any physical contact with
Farrar, or any other conduct similar to what plaintiff alleges with respect to her own incidents, or
that the incident was substantiated upon investigation.
As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated:
[A] municipal policy or custom giving rise to § 1983 liability will not be inferred
merely from municipal inaction in the face of isolated constitutional deprivations
by municipal employees. . . . [M]unicipal liability may not be rested simply upon
a failure to adopt policies that in retrospect can be seen to be a means by which
particular unconstitutional conduct of its employees might have been averted.
Milligan v. City of Newport News, 743 F.2d 227, 229-30 (4th Cir. 1984) (affirming dismissal for
failure to state a claim). See also Godfrey v. Faulkner, 2015 WL 273848 *4 (W.D. Va. 2015)
(“[s]uch a ‘formulaic recitation of the elements’ is inadequate to support a § 1983 municipal
liability claim”; a “[p]laintiff must identify ‘numerous particular instances of unconstitutional
conduct in order to establish a custom or practice,’” dismissing action); Gemaehlich v. Johnson,
2013 WL 589234 *3 (W.D. Va. 2013), aff’d, 599 F. App’x 473 (4th Cir. 2014) (allegations as to
prior inmates having been injured or even died in the jail were nevertheless the “kind of
threadbare recitals [that] do not ‘show’ prior instances of excessive force,” and are not sufficient
to show a “pervasive and unreasonable risk of constitutional injury,” dismissing claims against
sheriff); Lavender v. City of Roanoke Sheriff’s Office, 826 F. Supp. 2d at 934 (the “pleadings are
essentially boilerplate, devoid of specific facts” of deliberate indifference or tacit authorization of

13

Case 6:17-cv-00034-NKM-RSB Document 11 Filed 06/09/17 Page 13 of 19 Pageid#: 51

a particular practice that led to the alleged violation of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights).28
Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing that Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority had any
policy or custom on which to base municipal liability for what plaintiff alleges Farrar did.
“Furthermore, even where such a ‘policy’ of municipal inaction might be inferred, it must
still be shown to have been the ‘moving force of the constitutional violation’ specifically charged
in order to create municipal liability.” Milligan, 743 F.2d at 30. Plaintiff’s allegations also fail
to satisfy this element of her municipal liability claim. Plaintiff alleges no facts showing that
Blue Ridge Regional Jail was in any way the “moving force” of the alleged constitutionally
violative conduct of Farrar.
As this Court has stated in a case in which a defendant employee of Pamunkey Jail
confessed, pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of raping the plaintiff, and at least one other
female inmate, as he was transporting the plaintiff from the Jail to the Fluvanna Womens’
Correctional Center:
Plaintiff alleges the existence of a policy or custom of transporting female inmates
alone with male guards. There is no evidence of what the policy of the jail
actually is, but for the purposes of this motion we assume that there is an explicit
rule adopted after due deliberation permitting this practice. The Court finds a
policy or custom of transporting female inmates alone with male guards is not
unconstitutional, because the majority of men, and the majority of prison guards,
are not rapists merely waiting for an opportunity to assault a woman. This is not
to say that this policy is wise, or that a different policy would not have protected
the Plaintiff’s undeniable right to bodily integrity more effectively. But absent a
showing that transportation by a male guard alone is tantamount to a sentence of
rape for any women unfortunate enough to suffer it, the policy cannot be said to
have caused the rape. Rather, the policy failed to prevent the rape, which is

Plaintiff’s allegations also are not sufficient even to show negligence on the part of Blue
Ridge Regional Jail Authority. In any event, negligent conduct does not violate the Constitution
and is insufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327,
328, 332 (1986).

inadequate as a matter of law to support liability.
Doe v. Cunningham, 2006 WL 2819600 *2 (W.D. Va. 2006) (emphasis in original) (“[n]or does
a mere oversight in policymaking, leaving gaps in which employees can violate citizen rights,
result in liability”).29 See also Carter v. Morris, 164 F.3d 215, 218, 220 (4th Cir. 1999) (“Where a
plaintiff claims that the municipality has not directly inflicted an injury, but nonetheless has
caused an employee to do so, rigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied to
ensure that the municipality is not held liable solely for the actions of its employee,” and “a
plaintiff cannot rely upon scattershot accusations of unrelated constitutional violations to prove
either that a municipality was indifferent to the risk of her specific injury or that it was the
moving force behind her deprivation”; “[n]or does this meager history of isolated incidents
approach the ‘widespread and permanent’ practice necessary to establish municipal custom”).

Doe v. Cunningham was decided under the pleading standard that was subsequently
rendered obsolete by Twombly and Iqbal. Thus, in light of the pleading standard then that
dismissal should not be granted “unless it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would be
entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim,” this
Court allowed discovery “limited to the question of the prevalence of rape of inmates by guards
at the Pamunkey jail,” 2006 WL 2819600*2, before then entering summary judgment in favor of
the Jail. Doe v. Cunningham, 2007 WL 990141 (W.D. Va. March 29, 2007). It is respectfully
submitted that none of that action would have survived the pleadings stage as to the entity under
the pleading standards that apply now. The “‘no set of facts’ language has been questioned,
criticized, and explained away long enough,” “has earned its retirement,” and “is best
forgotten[.]” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 562-63 (2007).
There is no “duty on the courts to conjure up unpleaded facts that might turn a frivolous
claim of unconstitutional . . . action into a substantial one[.]” Id. (ellipsis in original). Accord
McCleary–Evans v. Md. Dep't of Transp., 780 F.3d 582, 587 (4th Cir. 2015) (“Iqbal and
Twombly articulated a new requirement . . . rejecting a standard that would allow a complaint to
‘survive a motion to dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility that a plaintiff
might later establish some “set of [undisclosed] facts” to support recovery’,” affirming
dismissal), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 1162 (2016).

Nor do plaintiff’s cryptic references to “[f]ailing to properly train correctional officers”30
provide any basis for municipal liability on the part of the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority. In
Virginia, criminal justice training academies, established pursuant to Virginia law, dictate the
level and kind of training required for jail officers like those named as defendants in this action.
See, e.g., Va. Code § 15.2-1706 (“all jail officers . . . must be certified through the successful
completion of training at an approved criminal justice training academy in order to remain
eligible for appointment or employment”); see similarly Grayson v. Peed, 195 F.3d 692, 697 (4th
Cir. 1999) (“the State Department of Criminal Justice Services tells the Sheriff what he must do
to train his employees”), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1067 (2000). Plaintiff does not allege that the
officers lacked that training, and no higher level of training is constitutionally required.
Furthermore, only where an alleged “failure to train reflects a ‘deliberate’ or ‘conscious’
choice” is there any potential for § 1983 liability. Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989)
(“only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of person with
whom the police come into contact”). As the United States Supreme Court discussed in Canton
v. Harris, “[t]hat a particular officer may be unsatisfactorily trained” is not sufficient to fix
liability for inadequate training, “[n]either will it suffice to prove that an injury [] could have
been avoided if an officer had had better or more training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the
particular injury-causing conduct.” 489 U.S. at 390-91.
The standard for alleging a claim based on allegedly improper training is as high as it is
for allegedly wrongful policies. Revene v. Charles County Commissioners, 882 F.2d 870, 874

(4th Cir. 1989) (affirming dismissal of § 1983 claim against policymakers). Indeed, in
Westmoreland v. Brown, the plaintiff inmate brought a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against
defendants including policymakers, alleging that their policies had caused him to be harmed by a
jail guard who had arranged for plaintiff to be attacked in jail. 883 F. Supp. 67, 69-70 (E.D. Va.
2005). In support of his claim, the plaintiff had even alleged in his complaint the exact number
of assaults, on a per month basis, that had occurred at the jail where the plaintiff was
incarcerated. Id. at 75-76. Nevertheless, the court concluded that such allegations did not rise to
the level of “substantial risk of harm” nor knowledge on the part of the policymakers necessary
to hold the policymakers liable, and the court dismissed the claim against defendants on the basis
of the pleadings alone. Id. at 76.
The court in Westmoreland v. Brown further held that any causal nexus between the
policies and the particular harm to the plaintiff was “far too attenuated to permit a recovery
here.” 883 F. Supp. at 76-77. As the court stated:
[W]here a guard betrays his duty to protect the inmates under his charge and
instead orchestrates a particular violent attack on one inmate, that attack could
occur in a facility with ideal capacity and supervision because the mechanism in
place to protect that inmate has been undermined. [Plaintiff’s] complaint offers
nothing beyond conclusory legal assertions that such a causal nexus exists in this
case. This is legally insufficient to save his complaint . . . .
Id. at 77. See also Gordon v. Kidd, 971 F.2d 1087, 1097 (4th Cir. 1992) (“A plaintiff must
identify a deficiency in the training program closely related to the injury complained of and must
further show that the injury would have been avoided ‘under a program that was not deficient in
the identified respect’”); Fisher v. Washington Metro Area Transit Authority, 690 F.2d 1133,
1143 (4th Cir. 1982) (incidents that occur “by unauthorized subordinate conduct -- or by sheer

accident beyond the control of an official -- cannot be charged to [the defendant supervisor]
under developed § 1983 doctrine”).
It is respectfully submitted that even if the Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority were
considered an entity subject to suit for purposes of § 1983, plaintiff fails to state a claim against
the Authority, and this action should be dismissed as against the Authority.
CONCLUSION
Based upon the foregoing, Blue Ridge Regional Jail Authority respectfully submits that
this action should be dismissed with prejudice as against the Authority, along with such other and
further relief as is just, including an award of the attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the defense
of this action.
