Defendant Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. (“Booz Allen” or “the firm”), by counsel, pursuant
to Federal Rule 56, submits this Memorandum in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment:
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Carla Calobrisi (“Plaintiff”) voluntarily resigned from as an in-house attorney

with Booz Allen effective October 31, 2011, where she was making approximately $260,000 a
year, not including a $50,000 annual bonus. Plaintiff resigned at a time of her own choosing
after spending nearly four months helping to recruit, interview and hire her replacement.
Plaintiff now contends that this voluntary decision was the product of discrimination and
retaliation notwithstanding the fact that the Record is devoid of any evidence that Plaintiff’s age
or gender played any role in any employment decision throughout her entire tenure.
As fully set forth below, toward the end of 2010 Booz Allen was preparing to reenter the
commercial and international markets after a three-year hiatus stemming from a non-compete
agreement. As a result, the Law Department, like all other departments within the firm, was
making strategic decisions with respect to personnel to ensure that the firm was best positioned to
capture work in these new areas. While Plaintiff’s then-supervisor, William Meyers, had hoped
that this time of transition would be her “time to shine,” the General Counsel, CG Appleby,
concluded that Plaintiff’s area of responsibility overseeing the firm’s Real Estate, Commercial
and International practice areas was too broad for a single attorney to lead after the non-compete
expired.

As a result, Mr. Appleby – the same person who hired and promoted Plaintiff

throughout her tenure at Booz Allen – appointed two other female attorneys in his Law
Department, Debra Storms (age 46) and Karen Tinsky (age 36), to oversee the firm’s
Commercial and International practice areas, leaving Plaintiff as the lead for the firm’s Real
2

Estate practice group. Mr. Appleby made this decision not because of Plaintiff’s gender or age,
but because Plaintiff’s core skill set was real estate, while Ms. Storms and Ms. Tinsky were
commercial and government contract attorneys, respectively, who had deep experience in
counseling clients on substantive legal issues in commercial and international government
contracting.

Accordingly, based upon these and the other undisputed material facts set forth

below, summary judgment is proper on all counts.
II.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff filed her Complaint on May 31, 2013 in the D.C. Superior Court alleging gender

and age discrimination and retaliation in violation of the D.C. Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”)
(Counts I, III, V), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, (Counts II, VI), and the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act (“ADEA”) (Counts IV, VII). Booz Allen removed the case to the D.C.
District Court on June 24, 2013. On July 1, 2013, Booz Allen moved to dismiss Plaintiff’s
DCHRA claims, and to transfer Plaintiff’s remaining ADEA claims to the Eastern District of
Virginia. The D.C. District Court dismissed Plaintiff’s DCHRA claims with prejudice and
transferred the remaining claims. The parties exchanged written discovery, Plaintiff took 10
depositions and Booz Allen took 6 depositions. As the record is devoid of any evidence to
support Plaintiff’s claims of discrimination and retaliation, and because discovery revealed no
disputed issue of material fact, Booz Allen moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s
discrimination and retaliation claims and seeks dismissal of the Complaint with prejudice.

III.

STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS
Plaintiff’s Employment History
1.

Booz Allen is a professional services consulting firm that provides services to

government and commercial clients. The Law Department is Booz Allen's in-house legal team
which provides legal counsel to Booz Allen in all areas relating to the firm's operations,
including risk management, ethics and compliance, government and commercial contracts,
employment law, international law, intellectual property, investigations, securities law. The Law
Department is responsible for supporting policy formulation, responding to inquiries from
investigative agencies, managing litigation, and enhancing compliance with the firm's Code of
Business Ethics and Conduct. (Ex. 1, Third Meyers Decl., ¶ 5.)
2.

In approximately April of 2000, Booz Allen’s part-time attorney, Lisa Franzen, who

handled all of its real-estate matters, including corporate registrations, leases and associated
powers of attorney, left Booz Allen. (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff was hired on April 10, 2000 as a Senior
Associate and Associate General Counsel to replace Ms. Franzen. (Id.) CG Appleby was the
General Counsel at the time of Plaintiff’s hire and was the ultimate decision maker who approved
her hire. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-13; Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 154:9-155:1.) In 2004, Mr. Appleby promoted
Plaintiff to Principal. (Id., 190:12-16.) By 2011, her salary had risen to $263,272, and she was
one of the highest paid Principals in the entire firm. (Ex. 1, Third Meyers Decl., ¶ 7.)
Booz Allen’s Business Model
3.

At the time of Plaintiff’s hire in 2000, Booz Allen had two sides to its business:

federal government and commercial. (Ex. 1, Third Meyers Decl., ¶ 8.) In 2008, Booz Allen spun
off its commercial and international business lines as part of a transaction with the Carlyle
4

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 5 of 32 PageID# 3732

Group. (Id.) As a part of this transaction, Booz Allen entered into a non-compete agreement
with Booz & Company (the entity that acquired Booz Allen’s commercial and international
business portfolio), which prohibited Booz Allen from doing any business in the commercial
markets and most international areas for a period of three years until July 30, 2011. (Id.)
4.

In 2009, Mr. Appleby named Plaintiff as the lead for the Real Estate, Commercial and

International practice group. (Ex. 3, Jan. 31, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 37:18-38:3.) In this role,
Plaintiff was primarily responsible for the firm’s real estate work, including that work in foreign
countries. (Id., 42:8-18.) Plaintiff also served as the head of the firm’s limited remaining work
in the commercial and international areas. (Ex. 4, Meyers Dep. Tr. 40:6-43:5.) In this capacity,
she advised Booz Allen’s internal clients on any real estate issues in conjunction with the
remaining international contracts, and on Booz Allen's routine business transactions with its own
vendors. (Id.) Plaintiff’s role, however, did not involve providing regular advice and counsel to
the firm’s business leaders on the core government contracting issues that were associated with
the remaining commercial or international business. (Ex. 2, Pl. Dep. Tr. 36:17-21.)
The Law Department Prepared to Reenter the Commercial and International Markets
5.

Toward the end of 2010, Mr. Appleby, as General Counsel, began to strategize about

how best to structure the Law Department to support the firm’s reentry into the commercial and
international markets upon the July 2011 expiration of the non-compete with Booz & Company.
(Ex. 3, Jan. 31, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 9:14-10:20.) Based upon his knowledge of the firm’s
anticipated surge of work associated with the reentry into the commercial and international
markets, Mr. Appleby decided that it would no longer be feasible for one attorney to oversee the
three practice areas of real estate, commercial and international. (Ex. 5 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 26:205

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 6 of 32 PageID# 3733

16; Ex. 3, Jan. 31, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 11:17-15:20; Ex. 27, Dec. 19, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr.
27:8-28:17, 63:19-34:3.)

As a result, Mr. Appleby decided to divide the Real Estate,

International and Commercial practice group into three separate areas and have a single attorney
oversee each of the new practice groups to allow the Law Department to better serve the needs of
its internal clients. (Ex. 3, Jan. 31, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 11:17-15:20, 19:12-18, 21:1-4, 38:1322, 42:1-18; Ex. 27, Dec. 19, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 27:8-28:1, 63:19-64:3.)
6.

Mr. Appleby (age 65) decided Plaintiff (female, age 55) would remain the Real Estate

practice lead, which was viewed as her primary strength. (Ex. 27, Dec. 19, 2014 Appleby Dep.
Tr. 65:5-66:7.) He then decided that Debra Storms (female, age 46) and Karen Tinsky (female,
age 36) would lead the firm’s Commercial and International practices. (Id., 28:2-17; 65:5-14.)1
7.

Before joining Booz Allen’s Law Department, Ms. Storms was responsible for the

commercial legal work for a U.S. subsidiary of a German company in her role as that company’s
General Counsel. (Id., 31:17-32:2; Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 74:7-20). In addition, during her
nine-year tenure at Booz Allen, Ms. Storms drove the firm’s intellectual property work, including
acquiring patents and copyrights, and led any litigation stemming from those efforts. (Ex. 4,
Meyers Dep. Tr. 166:5-19.) She was also the lead attorney who handled any export matters for
the firm. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 73:3-21; Ex. 6, Storms Performance Assessment.)

1

Mr. Appleby did not consult with anyone outside the Law Department in making this
decision, including the firm’s Leadership Team or other Senior Partners, such as Ralph Shrader,
Sam Strickland or Horacio Rozanski. (Ex. 3, Jan. 31, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr., 57:8-58:1, 66:1421; Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 60:21-61:13.) Similarly, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Meyers and Mr. Manya had
no conversations with the Leadership Team, including Dr. Shrader, Mr. Strickland or Mr.
Rozanski, concerning Mr. Appleby’s decision. (Ex. 4, Meyers Dep. Tr. 154:1-15.)
6

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 7 of 32 PageID# 3734

8.

Ms. Tinsky’s expertise was in government contracts. During the three-year non-

compete with Booz & Company, she performed the majority of the substantive legal work in the
limited areas of the international markets that Booz Allen could operate. (Ex. 7, Manya Dep. Tr.
80:9-81:12.) Specifically, and unlike Plaintiff who merely did leases and registrations, Ms.
Tinsky counseled all internal clients on the firm’s engagements with USAID, Millennium
Challenge Corporation, State Department and the foreign military sales work. (Id., 97:1-12.)
Moreover, like Ms. Storms, Ms. Tinsky provided legal support to internal clients regarding the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence. (Id., 80:9-81:12;
Ex. 8, Tinsky Performance Assessment.)
9.
36:17-19.)

By contrast, Plaintiff was not a government contracts attorney. (Ex. 2, Pl’s Dep. Tr.
Indeed, Plaintiff had not performed the volume or complexity of work in the

commercial and international markets that Mr. Appleby anticipated that the firm’s internal clients
would need upon reentry. (Ex. 27, Dec. 19, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 51:1-21.)

Plaintiff’s

involvement in international or commercial matters was episodic and at the periphery of the
firm’s business, usually limited to operational matters such as registering offices in foreign
countries, negotiating leases for office space and executing powers of attorney. (Ex. 7, Manya
Dep. Tr. 95:18-96:7, 97:1-12, 111:10-22.) Thus, Mr. Appleby believed Ms. Storms and Ms.
Tinsky had more experience providing legal counsel on the commercial and international matters
that the firm would face. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 72:5-74:22.) Mr. Appleby concluded that the
firm would not be best served by Plaintiff being the lead of the Commercial or International
practice groups after the reentry. (Ex. 27, Dec. 19, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr. 49:17-51:12.)

7

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 8 of 32 PageID# 3735

10.

In conjunction with this change, based upon his understanding of the demands and

responsibilities that would be required for the Real Estate practice lead position, and the types of
expectations and benchmarks required for Principal level positions across the firm, Mr. Appleby
decided that the Real Estate practice lead position was more appropriately scoped as a Senior
Associate position. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 36:2-18.) Indeed, at the time this decision was
made, the parallel positions for both the Commercial and International practice groups leads were
also Senior Associate positions. (Ex. 1, Third Meyers Decl., ¶ 11.)
11.

On January 20, 2011, Mr. Appleby called a meeting in the firm’s McLean, Virginia

headquarters, where the Law Department is located, and met with Robert Osborne, the firm’s
incoming General Counsel effective July 2011, and the Deputy General Counsels – William
Meyers (Plaintiff’s supervisor) and Douglas Manya. (Ex. 3, Jan. 31, 2014 Appleby Dep. Tr.
16:21-18:13.) At this meeting, Mr. Appleby outlined his decision regarding the new structure for
the Law Department.

After discussing Mr. Appleby’s strategy and thinking behind his

reasoning, Messrs. Osborne, Meyers and Manya supported the decision. (Id.)
12.

Mr. Osborne supported the decision because he had observed several deficits in

Plaintiff’s knowledge regarding critical contracting legal principals. During 2010, Plaintiff, on
repeated occasions, had failed to negotiate basic contractual terms that would have protected the
firm from liability and that Mr. Osborne reasonably expected to have known about Plaintiff given
her level at the firm. (Ex. 9, Osborne Dep. Tr. 50:12-59:5.) For example, not only had Plaintiff
included a personal guarantee in a contract that she presented to Mr. Osborne to sign, when
negotiating a contract for cyber-security services which posed significant risk to the firm,
Plaintiff did not understand that she could negotiate different terms than the boilerplate liability
8

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 9 of 32 PageID# 3736

provisions contained in the master services agreement. (Id.) Accordingly, Mr. Osborne did not
believe Plaintiff was best poised to lead either the Commercial or International practice group as
she was not a subject matter expert in either area. (Id., 88:9-89:16.)
13.

On January 26, 2011, Mr. Appleby, along with Messrs. Osborne and Meyers, met

with Plaintiff to discuss the changes to her position. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 28:18-29:5.)
Together they told Plaintiff of the Law Department’s restructuring, and told her that her position
had been re-scoped. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 200:3-201:8.) Plaintiff was notified that the position
change would not go into effect until April 1st (the beginning of Booz Allen’s next fiscal year),
that she would remain eligible for a Principal level bonus, and that there would be no change in
her salary as a result of the restructuring. (Id., 21:22-22:7.) The firm expressed its desire for
Plaintiff to stay with the Law Department at this meeting, throughout her remaining tenure, and
even afterward. (Id., 292:17-293:13.) Plaintiff said she would think about it and would get back
to them with a decision about whether she wanted to continue on in a Senior Associate role. (Id.
292:17-293:15; Ex. 10, Talking Points Memorandum.) The decision to restructure the Law
Department and Plaintiff’s role within that new structure was finalized by the end of January.
(Id.; Ex. 11, Pl.’s Answers to Interrog., at 3, 25 (calling it a “done deal.”)
Plaintiff Continues to Question Her New Role
& Receives Her 2011 Annual Assessment
14.

After January 26th, 2011 Plaintiff continued working with her clients on real estate

matters. There was some transition as Ms. Tinsky and Ms. Storms stepped into the commercial
and international work. (Ex. 12, Feb. 1, 2011 Emails between C. Calobrisi & W. Meyers.)
15.

While Plaintiff’s position change to Senior Associate was not shared with other

employees in the Law Department or with her clients, Plaintiff contacted several colleagues and
9

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 10 of 32 PageID# 3737

internal clients to express confusion about the restructuring and why her position had been rescoped from a Principal to a Senior Associate. One such individual Plaintiff contacted was Betty
Thompson, the firm’s Chief Personnel Officer. Plaintiff told Ms. Thompson that her position had
changed from a Principal to a Senior Associate and she was concerned about whether she could
continue to participate in the Diverse Women’s Mentoring Circle, a Booz Allen-sponsored group
designed to help advance the professional growth of its female internal professionals. (Ex. 2,
Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 272:2-274:21; Ex. 13, Thompson Dep. Tr. 29:1-5.) Plaintiff told Ms. Thompson
that she didn’t know why the change had been made (Id. 29:6-14) and wondered if it had
anything to do with her being a woman (Id. 31:11-32:6). When Ms. Thompson directly asked
Plaintiff if she had any reason to believe that the decision was because of her gender, Plaintiff
responded that she didn’t know. (Id. 31:11-32:6.) Based upon Plaintiff’s apparent confusion
about why the decision had been made, Ms. Thompson told Plaintiff that if she did not have
clarity about why the decision happened she should go back and ask. (Id. 29:6-14, 55:11-21.)2
16.

Consistent with the firm’s general practice, Caroline Wilkie, the HR manager who

supported the Law Department, drafted a Memorandum for Mr. Meyers to present to Plaintiff
outlining the terms of her new position. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 40:13-41:6, 42:1-4.) The
memorandum stated, “I acknowledge that I have read this memo and approve and voluntarily
accept the terms and conditions of the aforementioned transfer” because if Plaintiff did not in fact
agree to continue on in the new Senior Associate role, she would either need to find another
2

After the meeting with Plaintiff, Ms. Thompson contacted Sarah St. Clair in the firm’s
Human Resources department, and Mr. Meyers, in his role as Plaintiff’s supervisor, to confirm
about the reasoning behind Plaintiff’s re-slotting. (Ex. 13, Thompson Dep. Tr. 30:4-31:1, 51:152:9.) Ms. Thompson was informed that the re-slotting was not performance-based but was
instead the result of the Law Department’s attempt to better serve the firm as it reenters the
commercial and international markets. (Id., 47:16-49:11.)
10

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 11 of 32 PageID# 3738

Principal position within the Firm or transition out of the Firm. (Id., 43:4-44:19; Ex. 14, Apr. 5
Signed Memo.) On April 5th, Mr. Meyers presented the Memorandum to Plaintiff. (Id.; see also
Ex. 25, Third C. Wilkie Decl., ¶¶ 4-10.)
17.

Both before and after the April 5, 2011 meeting, Messrs. Meyers, Appleby, and

Osborne reiterated to Plaintiff that she was a valued member of the Law Department and that
they each wanted her to stay and succeed in her new role. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 293:4-15; Ex. 15,
Apr. 5, 2011 Emails between C. Calobrisi & W. Meyers.)
18.

In an effort to best position Plaintiff moving forward in her new role, Mr. Meyers

worked diligently to support Plaintiff in her 2011 assessment. For example, when Mr. Meyers
received Plaintiff’s self-assessment he noted several places where Plaintiff was making negative
comments about Ms. Tinksy. (Ex. 16, Apr. 6, 2011 Emails between W. Meyers & C. Calobrisi.)
Mr. Meyers shared his experience with Plaintiff that such comments would most likely not be
received as she intended, and in fact, could be viewed by some individuals in the Assessment
Review Group as reflecting negatively on Plaintiff. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 105:3-106:9.)
19.

Similarly, Mr. Meyers pressed Plaintiff’s assessor not to include negative, although

accurate, performance feedback in Plaintiff’s 2011 assessment. Jennifer Gleich (who had been
selected to do Plaintiff’s 2011 assessment as she was a peer to Plaintiff) learned from Mr.
Osborne, in the course of conducting the assessment, that Plaintiff had failed to remove a
personal guarantee in a lease that she had reviewed and presented to Mr. Osborne for signature.
(Ex. 17, Gleich Dep. Tr. 73:19-75:4.) In reviewing the lease himself prior to execution, Mr.
Osborne found the personal guarantee language and refused to sign it until it was removed. (Ex.
2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 103:14-104:5.) Mr. Meyers was concerned that including such feedback in
11

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 12 of 32 PageID# 3739

Plaintiff’s assessment could be extremely problematic since Plaintiff was the lead real estate
attorney and was already dispirited as a result of the Law Department’s restructuring. (Ex. 17,
Gleich Dep. Tr. 72:12-73:16.) Mr. Meyers preferred that the performance failure be orally
presented to Plaintiff during the assessment debrief instead of permanently placed on her
personnel record. (Id., 72:12-73:16, 78:11-79:6.)
20.

Ms. Gleich ultimately declined to “voice track” the information to Plaintiff because

she felt that the best way to help Plaintiff was to be direct with her about her performance
shortcomings. (Id.) Ms. Gleich felt particularly strongly about including the personal guarantee
issue since Plaintiff had shared with Ms. Gleich at a lunch earlier in the year that Plaintiff in fact
did not always read all of the terms in the leases she reviewed, despite the fact that she was the
only lawyer reviewing them. (Id., 75:5-16.)
21.

Ms. Gleich received feedback during the assessment that Plaintiff needed to focus on

the Real Estate practice group with positive energy and enthusiasm. In the course of conducting
interviews with several of Plaintiff’s internal clients, they had noted that Plaintiff had repeatedly
voiced her unhappiness with the restructuring and having her position slotted as a Senior
Associate position and that they did not want her to continue focusing on it. (Id., 59:20-60:22.)
22.

Notwithstanding, Plaintiff received a "Meets Expectations" rating and a bonus of

$52,000. (Ex. 18, Pl.’s 2011 Assessment; Ex. 1, Third Meyers Decl. ¶ 12.)
23.

On or about May 31, 2011, Ms. Gleich and Mr. Meyers met with Plaintiff to present

Plaintiff with the findings from her performance of the last year and to discuss what Plaintiff
should focus on for the upcoming year. (Ex. 17, Gleich Dep. Tr. 36:9-19.) At that meeting Ms.
Gleich walked Plaintiff through the themes identified in the assessment. (Id. 99:7-100:5.) After
12

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 13 of 32 PageID# 3740

completing that portion of the discussion, Ms. Gleich began reviewing the development needs for
the upcoming year. (Id., 101:2-7.) Ms. Gleich shared with Plaintiff the need for her to have
energy and enthusiasm for her role moving forward, at which point Plaintiff became upset and
again began questioning why the downslotting decision had been made. (Id., 101:2-102:1.)
24.

At that point in the meeting, Mr. Meyers told Plaintiff the reasons the decision had

been made had been previously shared with her, but stated that if she had a concern about why
the decision was made that Booz Allen would open an investigation. (Id., 102:3-7.) Mr. Meyers
reiterated his previous comments that Plaintiff was a valued member of the team and that he
hoped she would embrace where she was. (Id., 104:6-14; 105:5-12.) The conversation ended
with Mr. Meyers again indicating that if Plaintiff wanted, Booz Allen would open an
investigation.

(Id., 105:5-12.)

In response, Plaintiff stated she did not want the firm to

investigate. (Id., 109:3-11; Ex. 26, June 30, 2011 Memo.)

Plaintiff Decides to Resign & Assists in Hiring Her Replacement
25.

Ultimately, in June of 2011, over four months after Plaintiff was notified of the

restructuring, Plaintiff informed Mr. Meyers that she was not comfortable in the Senior Associate
role and instead, intended to resign from the firm and pursue an executive coaching certification
program from Georgetown University. (Ex. 19, June 1, 2011 Email from W. Meyers to C.
Calobrisi.) Plaintiff asked Mr. Meyers to provide her a letter of recommendation in connection
with her application for this program, which he did. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 174:8-18; see also Ex.
20, Recommendation Letter.)

Mr. Meyers and Plaintiff discussed various options for her

transition. She ultimately agreed to stay with the firm until the Law Department had identified

13

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 14 of 32 PageID# 3741

her replacement. (Ex. 5, 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. 116:6-117:5.) The firm offered to cancel its search
for her replacement if she would decide to stay with the firm. (Ex. 26, June 30, 2011 Memo.)
26.

Plaintiff subsequently began notifying peers in the Law Department and internal

clients at the firm that she was voluntarily resigning from the firm. (Ex. 21, June 13, 2011 Email
from C. Calobrisi stating “I wanted to let you both know that I am retiring from the firm. It is all
good and I am very happy about my decision.”) In an effort to make sure that Booz Allen
framed Plaintiff’s departure in a way that Plaintiff desired, Mr. Meyers asked Plaintiff how she
was characterizing her departure. (Ex. 22, June 9, 2011 Emails from W. Meyers to C. Calobrisi.)
Plaintiff stated that she was characterizing it as a retirement. (Id.) Mr. Meyers offered that the
Department would like to host a celebration to recognize her contributions to the firm if she
wanted one. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 24:1-16; Ex. 4, Meyers Dep. Tr. 212:6-22.)
27.

Plaintiff agreed to stay and help hire her replacement. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 95:17-

96:2.) Between late June 2011 through August 2011 Plaintiff assisted with the interview process
for her replacement. (Id., 306:11-307:22.) Plaintiff voluntarily selected October 31, 2011 as her
last date of employment, and admitted at her deposition that she could have stayed longer.
(Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 285:12-286:6.)
28.

The firm hired Kamaal Jones (male, age 31). Mr. Jones began as a Senior Associate

on September 9, 2011 with a starting salary of $185,000 ($75,000 less than Plaintiff). (Ex. 23, K.
Jones Offer Letter.) During the interview process, Plaintiff rejected a candidate for the position
who was about the same age as she and others who were older than Mr. Jones before
recommending instead that Mr. Meyers offer the position to Mr. Jones. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s 307:4-22.)
Plaintiff felt that Mr. Jones was the most qualified. (Id. 308: 4-6.)

Plaintiff’s Lack of Evidence of Discrimination and Retaliation
29.

Plaintiff claims that she was discriminated and retaliated against because of her

gender and age. (Compl. ¶¶ 103-106, 117-120, 126-135.) Plaintiff’s bases for these claims is
Mr. Appleby’s decision to restructure the Law Department; to have three separate lawyers lead
the Real Estate, Commercial and International work; and to rescope her position from a Principal
to Senior Associate position. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 39:19-42:12.)
30.

The sole evidence in support of her gender discrimination claim is Mr. Appleby’s

decision to make Debra Storms (female, age 46) and Karen Tinsky (female, age 36) the leads for
the firm’s Commercial and International groups. (Id. 39:19-45:8.) The sole evidence in support
of Plaintiff’s age discrimination claims is that: (a) on no more than three occasions(all after the
decision to rescope was made and communicated to her), Mr. Osborne and Mr. Meyers allegedly
stated that as a part of the Law Department’s restructuring they wanted to hire “younger” lawyers
(Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 340:3-19); and (b) Mr. Meyers referenced the idea of “retirement” to
Plaintiff when she discussed leaving the firm (id., 20:6-9, 24:1-25:15).
31.

Plaintiff, however, conceded at deposition that:
a. Ms. Storms had more experience than she did in dealing with intellectual property and
related matters and that it was “easy to understand that [Ms. Storms] would have been
the one to who did the lion’s share of that work.” (Id. 34:11-20; see also 33:4-16.);
b. She had no experience handling anti-boycott matters (Id., 36:14-16), did not support
the firm’s USAID work (Id., 49:16-50:9), and in fact conceded that she was not a
government contracts lawyer (Id., 36:17-37:7), all of which were core components of
the firm’s anticipated commercial and international work upon expiration of the noncompete with Booz & Company; and
c. She has no knowledge of Ms. Tinsky’s experience in international government
contract law prior to coming to Booz Allen and admitted that Ms. Tinsky – and not
Plaintiff – regularly reviewed federal government contracts for the firm’s clients who
15

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 16 of 32 PageID# 3743

were actually engaged in delivering services and solutions to internationally based
clients. (Id., 32:15-3.)
32.

No evidence exists that Mr. Appleby considered Plaintiff’s gender or age when

deciding how to restructure the Law Department, or that he made any comments referencing
Plaintiff’s gender or age beyond a statement to Plaintiff prior to 2008 that he was “happy to have
[Plaintiff] in the Law Department because of [her] experience.” (Id., 16:8-17:11, 26:7-18.)
33.

Plaintiff also testified that she has no evidence that Messrs. Osborne, Meyers or

Manya made any comments about her gender that she considered to be discriminatory. (Id.,
26:16-19, 31:11-18.) Similarly, there is no evidence that Mr. Appleby (or Mr. Osborne, Mr.
Meyers or Mr. Manya) discussed Plaintiff’s gender or age during their conversation where Mr.
Appleby shared his strategic decision regarding how he was going to redeploy Ms. Storms, Ms.
Tinsky and Plaintiff to lead the Commercial, International and Real Estate practice groups.
34.

Indeed, the firm hired Mr. Jones – the attorney who assumed the Real Estate practice

lead upon Plaintiff’s resignation – at the Senior Associate level, the same level the position was
offered to Plaintiff. (Id., 295:21-296:8.) Moreover, as of January 20, 2011, 66.67% of the Law
Department was over the age of 40 and 29.17% was over the age of 50. (Ex. 1, Third Meyers
Decl. ¶ 13.) Lastly, the contemporaneous documents undisputedly establish that Mr. Meyers
sought Plaintiff’s clarification as to how she wanted to characterize her departure and Plaintiff,
not Mr. Meyers, indicated that she was telling others that she was retiring. (Ex. 22.)
35.

Plaintiff’s retaliation claims stem from her contention that she made “complaints” to

Ms. Thompson and Mr. Meyers about the decision to have Ms. Storms and Ms. Tinsky lead the
firm’s Commercial and International work and having her position rescoped to the Senior
Associate level. (Compl. ¶¶ 55, 61.) As a result of these so-called complaints, Plaintiff contends
16

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 17 of 32 PageID# 3744

that she was forced to sign the April 2011 Memorandum summarizing the terms of her new
Senior Associate role and ultimately forced to resign effective October 31, 2011. (Id. ¶ 63.)
36.

Booz Allen, however, has a non-retaliation policy, and concerns or reports of

misconduct or suspected retaliation may be made under this policy through multiple avenues.
(Ex. 24, EEO Policy.) During Plaintiff’s deposition, she admitted that she failed to utilize any of
these avenues, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiff herself had conducted investigations under
the policy. (Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 326:5-13.) In fact, it is undisputed that Plaintiff never asked
anyone at Booz Allen to conduct an investigation into the reasons behind the Law Department’s
restructuring, despite Mr. Meyers’ explicit offer to do so. (Id., 217:7-9.) Importantly, all of the
decisions regarding Plaintiff’s new role within the Law Department were made prior to any of
the “complaints” to Mr. Meyers or Ms. Thompson. (Ex. 11, Pl.’s Answers to Interrog. at 3, 10.)
IV.

ARGUMENT
A.

Summary Judgment Standard.

Summary judgment must be granted if a party fails to make a showing sufficient to
establish the existence of any essential element of the party’s case on which that party has the
burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P.
56(c). A movant need only show an absence of evidence or support for the opposing party’s
case. See id. If the nonmovant fails to identify specific facts that demonstrate a genuine and
material issue for trial, then the court must grant summary judgment “to prevent factually
unsupported claims and defenses from proceeding to trial.” Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co., 818
F.2d 1126, 1128 (4th Cir. 1987); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986)
(holding that “existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an
17

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 18 of 32 PageID# 3745

otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment”) (emphasis added).

“Mere

unsupported speculation is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion if the undisputed
evidence indicates that the other party should win as a matter of law.” Francis v. Booz, Allen &
Hamilton Inc., 452 F.3d 299, 308 (4th Cir. 2006).
B.

Title VII and the ADEA.

Title VII makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate
against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added).
In a Title VII sex discrimination case, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that her employer
“intentionally” discriminated against her because of her sex. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing
Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000); St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506–08 (1993).
The ADEA prohibits employers from terminating an employee who is at least 40 years of
age “because of” the person’s age. 29 U.S.C. §§ 623(a)(1), 631(a). A plaintiff must demonstrate
that the employer engaged in disparate treatment “because of” the employee’s age and,
accordingly, age must be the “but-for” cause of such treatment. Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557
U.S. 167, 177–78 (2009) (rejecting “mixed motive” theory of liability for claims brought under
the ADEA); EEOC v. Balt. Cnty., 747 F.3d 267, 272–73 (4th Cir. 2014). Plaintiff’s burden of
demonstrating the “but-for” causation applies not just at trial, but also at summary judgment. See
Harris v. Powhatan Cnty. Sch. Bd., 543 F. App’x 343, 346 n.3 (4th Cir. 2013).
Lacking direct evidence of discrimination under either the ADEA or Title VII, Plaintiff’s
case proceeds under the familiar burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas

18

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 19 of 32 PageID# 3746

Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802–04 (1973).3 See Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt.,
Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (applying McDonnell Douglas to ADEA
claim). Under this approach, Plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case of discrimination
under both the ADEA and Title VII. If she is able to do so, then “the burden shifts to the
employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment
action.” Hill, 354 F.3d at 285. Then, “the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the employer’s stated reasons ‘were not its true reasons, but
were a pretext for discrimination.’” Id.
C.

A Powerful Inference Against Discrimination Exists Because Plaintiff was
Hired by the Same Person Who Decided on the Alleged Adverse Action.

When the person who hired a plaintiff also made the alleged adverse employment
decision, the Court need not show “strict fealty to proof schemes.” Proud v. Stone, 945 F.2d 796,
798 (4th Cir. 1991). This is because “[w]hen the hirer and the firer are the same individual, there
is a powerful inference relating to the ‘ultimate question’ that discrimination did not motivate the
employer.” Id.; see also Spruill v. Kip Killmon’s Tysons Ford, Inc., No. 1:12cv806, 2012 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 146180, at *16 (E.D. Va. Oct. 10, 2012) (Trenga, J.).
It is undisputed that the same person—Mr. Appleby (age 65)4—decided to hire Plaintiff
and also made many of the decisions Plaintiff now contends are discriminatory. Mr. Appleby

3

Although direct evidence is not required to proceed under a mixed-motive sex
discrimination case under Title VII, the ultimate question regarding whether Plaintiff was a
victim of intentional discrimination must be answered with sufficient evidence upon which one
could find that her gender “actually motivated” the decision. Hill, 354 F.3d at 285–86.
4
A similar presumption exists when the decision maker is in the same protected category
as plaintiff. See Miller v. Locke, No. 1:08-cv-1149, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49707, at *19 (E.D.
Va. June 12, 2009) (Trenga, J.) (granting summary judgment in part because the decision makers
were in the plaintiff’s protected class, as were more than a third of plaintiff’s co-workers).
19

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 20 of 32 PageID# 3747

decided to hire Plaintiff in 2000, to promote her in 2004 and to appoint her as the practice lead
for the firm’s Real Estate, Commercial and International operations in 2008. (See Statement of
Facts (“SOF”) ¶ 2). In addition to making the decisions so favorable to Plaintiff, he also made
the decisions she now claims are discriminatory. (SOF ¶¶ 6, 9–10.)5 Thus, the undisputed facts
establish that Mr. Appleby is the equivalent of “the hirer and the firer,” that is, the person who
hired and promoted Plaintiff but who also made the allegedly discriminatory decisions. Proud,
945 F.2d at 798; see also Spruill, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146180, at *16. Accordingly, the Court
need not follow the McDonnell Douglas proof scheme and instead should require Plaintiff to
rebut the “powerful interference” on “the ‘ultimate question’ that discrimination did not motivate
the employer.” Proud, 945 F.2d at 798; see also Spruill, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146180, at *16.
Plaintiff cannot state any undisputed material fact tending to satisfy her burden on this “ultimate
question” and for this reason the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Booz Allen.
D.

Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Prima Facie Case of Sex or Age Discrimination.

Even if the Court adheres to the McDonnell Douglas proof scheme, Plaintiff nevertheless
cannot satisfy her prima facie burden.

To establish a prima facie case of sex or age

discrimination, Plaintiff must show that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered
an adverse employment action; (3) she was performing her job duties satisfactorily; and (4) the
position remained open or was filled by similarly qualified applicants outside the protected class.

5

There is no dispute that Mr. Appleby was the decision maker in this case. Plaintiff claims
that Mr. Osborne told her during the January 26, 2011 meeting that it was “his” decision. (Ex. 2,
Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 265:3–6.) While this fact is disputed, what Mr. Osborne said at the January 26th
meeting is immaterial. First, Plaintiff conceded that she “believe[d] it was a consensus decision,”
including Mr. Appleby (id., 199:21-200:1); and second, it is undisputed that Mr. Appleby made
the ultimate decisions at issue prior to the more relevant January 20, 2011 meeting he had with
Messrs. Osborne, Manya and Meyers (SOF ¶¶ 6, 9–11).
20

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 21 of 32 PageID# 3748

Bonds v. Leavitt, 629 F.3d 369, 386 (4th Cir. 2011); Hill, 354 F.3d at 285; see also Nathan v.
Takeda Pharms. Am., Inc., 890 F. Supp. 2d 629, 639–41 (E.D. Va. 2012) (Trenga, J.).6 Plaintiff
has failed to establish a preponderance of the evidence showing her duties were assumed by
others outside of her protected classes. St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993)
(“[P]laintiff . . . must first establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a ‘prima facie’ case.”).
First, the undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff (female, age 55) was replaced by Debra
Storms (female, age 46) and Karen Tinsky (female, age 36). (SOF ¶ 6.) Despite the fact that Ms.
Storms and Ms. Tinsky are female, Plaintiff nevertheless contends that distributing her work to
these women constitutes gender discrimination.7 Simply put, Plaintiff cannot satisfy her prima
facie burden because her work was given to other women. Brinkley v. Harbour Rec. Club, 180
F.3d 598, 609 (4th Cir. 1999) (requiring a plaintiff to show that her position remained open or
was filled by similarly qualified applicants outside the protected class).
Second, with respect to Plaintiff’s claim of age discrimination, Plaintiff must show that
she was replaced by employees who were “substantially” younger than she was. See generally
O’Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 313 (1996); Dugan v. Albemarle Cnty.
Sch. Bd., 293 F.3d 716, 721 (4th Cir. 2002). In this case, the nine-year difference between
Plaintiff and Ms. Storms is insubstantial, particularly given that plaintiff has “not presented one
iota of evidence” that Booz Allen considered Plaintiff’s age. See DeBord v. Wash. Cnty. Sch.
6

It is undisputed that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class, i.e., over 40 and female,
and that she was adequately performing her job. Moreover, for purposes of summary judgment,
Booz Allen concedes arguendo that Plaintiff’s re-scoped job (of which she was notified in
January 2011) constitutes an adverse employment action.
7
See Ex. 2, Pl.’s Dep. Tr. 39:19–22 (“Q: [I]s it still your contention in this case that the
giving of the commercial work to Ms. Storms occurred because of your gender? A: Yes.”); id.
at 42:4–11 (“Q: Do you still contend that the moving of the international work to Ms. Tinsky
was also because of your gender? . . . A: Yes.”).
21

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 22 of 32 PageID# 3749

Bd., 340 F. Supp. 2d 710, 715–16 (W.D. Va. 2004). In this regard, Plaintiff has failed to produce
“evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on an illegal
discriminatory criterion.” O’Connor, 517 U.S. at 313 (alterations omitted).
Third, Plaintiff has also failed to demonstrate that her Commercial and International roles
were filled by “similarly qualified” employees. Bonds, 629 F.3d at 386; Hill, 354 F.3d at 285;
see also Nathan, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 639–41. To make this showing, Plaintiff should demonstrate
that her replacements are “similarly situated with respect to performance, qualifications, and
conduct” and that Ms. Tinsky and Ms. Storms “possessed analogous attributes, experience,
education, and qualifications.” Balderston v. Fairbanks Morse Engine Div. of Coltec Indus., 328
F.3d 309, 322 (7th Cir. 2003). Here, the undisputed material facts show that Booz Allen
reasonably concluded that Plaintiff was less qualified than Ms. Tinsky and Ms. Storms for the
significant Commercial and International work it anticipated as a result of the expiration of the
non-compete. (SOF ¶ 10-14, 48-49.)8 Accordingly, based upon these undisputed material facts
Plaintiff cannot carry her prima facie burden for her gender or age discrimination claims. See
Brinkley v. Harbour Rec. Club, 180 F.3d 598, 610–11 (4th Cir. 1999).
E.

Defendant’s Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason for Its Actions.

Even assuming that Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Booz
Allen has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the actions Plaintiff alleges are
adverse. As it has consistently stated, Booz Allen restructured the Law Department to prepare
8

Plaintiff cannot overcome these undisputed facts by pointing to her own belief that she
was equally qualified to perform the work as Ms. Storms or Ms. Tinsky. It is well-settled in this
Circuit that an employee’s perception of their qualifications is irrelevant. See King v. Rumsfeld,
328 F.3d 145, 149 (4th Cir. 2003) (“‘It is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant,
not the self-assessment of the plaintiff.”)
22

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 23 of 32 PageID# 3750

for reentry into the commercial and international markets at the expiration of the Booz &
Company non-compete. (SOF ¶¶ 3, 5, 9.) No evidence suggests the firm’s decision was related
to Plaintiff’s age or gender. (SOF ¶¶ 3, 5, 9, 32.) Booz Allen slotted the Real Estate practice
group lead as a Senior Associate because of the position’s anticipated demands and
responsibilities, bringing the position in line with the other two practice leads already slotted as
Senior Associates. (SOF ¶ 10.) Plaintiff had a “relative lack of experience” in “area[s] most
important to the present and future needs of the company” and the business decision therefore
constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Fields v. Verizon Servs. Corp., 493 F. App’x
371, 376 (4th Cir. 2012); see also Perry v. Computer Scis. Corp., 429 F. App’x 218, 220 (4th Cir.
2011) (finding the existence of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason when an employer does
not promote an employee who lacks the needed experience with its global activities during a
departmental reorganization). The decision to restructure of the Law Department similarly
serves as “a strategic business decision [which] constitutes a legally sufficient justification.”
Fields, 493 F. App’x at 377 (citing Mereish v. Walker, 359 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir. 2004)).
F.

The Undisputed Facts Demonstrate that Plaintiff Cannot Establish Pretext.

Booz Allen’s articulation of its legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons shifts the burden
“back to [the plaintiff] to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer’s stated
reasons ‘were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.’” Hill, 354 F.3d at 285.
Plaintiff must demonstrate that Defendant’s explanation for its decisions is not true or “is
unworthy of credence.” Reeves, 530 U.S. at 143. Plaintiff cannot establish pretext “by focusing
on minor discrepancies that do not cast doubt on the explanation’s validity, or by raising points
that are wholly irrelevant to it.” Bonds, 629 F.3d at 386. At this stage, “[i]t is the perception of
23

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 24 of 32 PageID# 3751

the decision maker which is relevant.” Id.; see also Holland v. Wash. Homes, Inc., 487 F.3d 208,
215–18 (4th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff cannot cite any admissible evidence giving rise to an inference
that Defendant’s consistent explanation for why it reorganized the Law Department and rescoped Plaintiff’s job was a pretext for intentional discrimination.
If Plaintiff alleges pretext by references to “younger” lawyers or her “retirement,” (SOF
¶¶ 26, 30, 34) such allegations are insufficient to rebut Plaintiff’s legitimate, nondiscriminatory
reasons. “[A]ny comments related to an interest in a younger work force . . . were not part of any
discussions associated with Plaintiff” and are insufficient to establish pretext. Miller, 2009 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 49707, at *19 (citing Duke v. Uniroyal, 928 F.2d 1413, 1417 (4th Cir. 1991)).
Notably, Messrs. Appleby, Osborne, Meyers and Manya “were all over the age of forty and
within the same protected class as Plaintiff.” Id. In fact, two-thirds of the Law Department was
over the age of forty and nearly thirty percent were over fifty years old.9 (SOF ¶ 34.)
Any pretext argument pertaining to Mr. Meyers’ reference to “retirement”—Plaintiff’s
characterization of her departure (SOF ¶¶ 26, 30, 34)—fails. This Court has specifically held
that “pretext is not established by the simple fact that [the employer] once asked [the employee]
about her plans for retirement.” Montgomery v. Ruxton Health Care, IX, LLC, No. 3:06cv024,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30898, at *27–28 (E.D. Va. Apr. 26, 2007) (Payne, J.).10 Moreover,
discussions about retirement occurred well after Mr. Appleby decided to reorganize the Law

9

In Miller, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49707, at *19, the Court found significant that a full
one-third of the practice area was over the age of forty. That significance is amplified in this
case given the substantially higher proportion of employees over forty and fifty. (SOF ¶ 34.)
10
See also Sprenger v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, 253 F.3d 1106, 1113 (8th
Cir. 2001); Lewis v. St. Cloud State Univ., 467 F.3d 1133, 1137 (8th Cir. 2006) (explaining that
a supervisor’s “reasonable inquiries into an employee’s retirement plans do not permit an
inference of [age] discrimination”).
24

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 25 of 32 PageID# 3752

Department, and only in response to Plaintiff’s own comments about her desire to stop working
for Booz Allen. Accordingly, any comment Mr. Meyers made in response to Plaintiff about her
retirement is insufficient for her to establish pretext.
Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, summary judgment in Booz Allen’s favor is
warranted and Plaintiff’s gender and age discrimination claims must be dismissed with prejudice.
G.

Defendant did not Retaliate Against Plaintiff.

Plaintiff alleges Booz Allen retaliated against her when the firm “constructively
discharged” her after she complained of discrimination. (SOF ¶ 35.) To establish a prima facie
case for retaliation, the plaintiff must prove three separate elements: (1) that she engaged in a
protected activity; (2) that her employer took an adverse employment action against her; and
(3) that there was a causal link between the two events. EEOC v. Navy Fed. Credit Union, 424
F.3d 397, 405–06 (4th Cir. 2005).
1.

Plaintiff did not engage in protected activity.

Plaintiff contends she engaged in protected activity when she asked Senior Vice President
of Human Resources Betty Thompson and her supervisor, William Meyers, whether her
demotion was the result of discrimination. (SOF ¶¶ 15, 24, 35.) To constitute protected activity,
Plaintiff must show she reasonably believed the complained-of conduct was unlawful. See
Nathan, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 644. Whether Plaintiff “reasonably believed” she was opposing
unlawful conduct must be measured by an objective standard applied as a matter of law. Id.
(citing Jordan v. Alt. Res. Corp., 458 F.3d 332, 339 (4th Cir. 2006)).

25

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 26 of 32 PageID# 3753

Plaintiff did not even subjectively believe she was opposing unlawful conduct because
she expressed uncertainty about the reasons for the job change.11

Even if Plaintiff had a

subjective belief that she was opposing unlawful activities, such belief would be insufficient to
show she engaged in protected activity. See Nathan, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 645 (granting summary
judgment because “no evidence, other than [Plaintiff’s] subjective belief,” existed to support
claim for discrimination). Nonetheless, Plaintiff’s belief is objectively unreasonable because the
Commercial and International practice areas were delegated to women, and two-thirds of the
Law Department was over the age of forty. (SOF ¶ 34.) No reasonable person would believe
that the decision to reorganize the Law Department and align all three positions as Senior
Associates constituted discrimination under such circumstances. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s isolated
comments or questions to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Meyers do not constitute protected activity.
2.

The adverse action is not causally related to her alleged protected
activity.

Even if the Court finds that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity, the undisputed
evidence shows that Plaintiff did not suffer any materially adverse action causally related to her
alleged protected activity. In order to state a claim for retaliation, Plaintiff must establish that her
challenged action was “materially adverse, ‘which . . . means it well might have dissuaded a
reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.’” Nathan, 890 F.
Supp. 2d at 646 (citing Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006)).
Moreover, Plaintiff must establish that the materially adverse employment action was causally
11

The undisputed facts establish that when Plaintiff “complained” to Ms. Thompson, Ms.
Thompson specifically asked Plaintiff if she thought the job change was because of her gender,
and Plaintiff responded she didn’t know. (SOF ¶ 15.) Plaintiff exhibited this same uncertainty to
Mr. Meyers. (SOF ¶ 24.) This conclusion is highlighted by the fact that Plaintiff declined Mr.
Meyers’ offer to open an investigation. (SOF ¶ 24.)
26

related to her protected activity. Navy Fed. Credit Union, 424 F.3d at 405–06. To satisfy this
standard, Plaintiff must adduce “evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that
a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.” Nathan, 890 F.
Supp. 2d at 647. Any direct evidence Plaintiff cites must “evince retaliatory animus with respect
to [her] protected activity.” Mehta v. Potter, No. 1:07cv1257, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47203, at
*30–31 (E.D. Va. June 4, 2009) (Trenga, J.). As such, any retaliation could only have occurred
after Plaintiff alleges she engaged in protected activity. Nathan, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 646 n.21. It
is undisputed that Plaintiff questioned Ms. Thompson in March or April 2011 and discussed her
belief of discrimination with Mr. Meyers in May 2011. (SOF ¶¶ 15, 24, 35; Compl. ¶¶ 58, 61.)
In other words, this “protected activity” occurred after the alleged “demotion” in January 2011
and thus the “demotion” cannot form the basis for retaliation. (SOF ¶¶ 11, 13.)
To avoid this obvious conclusion, Plaintiff seems to assert that Mr. Meyers’ presentation
to Plaintiff of a memorandum, which merely described the previously discussed details of her
new position, constitutes an adverse action. (SOF ¶ 25.) The memo, however, is neither an
adverse action nor causally related to Plaintiff’s “protected activity.” Human Resources manager
Caroline Wilkie prepared the letter consistent with the firm’s general practice for an employee’s
position or title change. (SOF ¶ 25.) No evidence suggests Ms. Wilkie knew of Plaintiff’s
alleged protected activity, thus eliminating causation. To the contrary, the undisputed evidence
proves the decision to re-scope Plaintiff’s job and all of the consequences thereof, including any
alleged salary freeze, was made in January 2011, well before any alleged protected activity.
(SOF ¶¶ 15–17.) Plaintiff herself conceded in her Interrogatory Answers that the decision was a
“done deal” well before any alleged protected activity. (SOF ¶ 13.) Furthermore, “it is worth
27

noting that even if the memorandum may be considered a materially adverse action, the
undisputed record reflects a clear, non-retaliatory reason for its issuance that is not pretextual.”
Gordon v. Napolitano, 863 F. Supp. 2d 541, 552 (E.D. Va. 2012). The firm issued the memo to
advise Plaintiff about her new role and make sure the expectations associated with the change
were clear given the firm’s new fiscal year. (SOF ¶ 16.) Thus, there is no factual basis –
disputed or otherwise – that Booz Allen engaged in any conduct that would dissuade a reasonable
person from engaging in protected activity.
3.

Plaintiff was not “constructively discharged.”

Plaintiff alleges her resignation was not voluntary; rather, she alleges Booz Allen
constructively discharged her.

How Plaintiff’s constructive discharge claim relates to her

discrimination and retaliation claims is unclear, so Defendant will address it here. Constructive
discharge occurs “if an employer deliberately makes the working conditions intolerable in an
effort to induce the employee to quit.” Honor v. Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 383 F.3d 180,
186 (4th Cir. 2004). Plaintiff must prove “(1) the deliberateness of Booz Allen’s actions,
motivated by [discriminatory] bias, and (2) the objective intolerability of the working
conditions.” Id.; see also Freeman v. Dal-Tile Corp., 750 F.3d 413, 425 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding
that a plaintiff must “present sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether [her
employer] deliberately attempted to induce her to quit” and “that her working conditions at the
time she resigned were objectively intolerable.”). The Fourth Circuit has held that claims of
constructive discharge must be “carefully cabined” since they can be “open to abuse by those
who leave employment of their own accord.” Goldsmith v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., 987
F.2d 1064, 1072 (4th Cir. 1993). For this reason:
28

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 29 of 32 PageID# 3756

[T]he law does not permit an employee’s subjective perceptions to govern a claim
of constructive discharge. Every job has its frustrations, challenges and
disappointments; these inhere in the nature of work. An employee is protected
from a calculated effort to pressure him into resignation through the imposition of
unreasonably harsh conditions, in excess of those faced by his co-workers. He is
not, however, guaranteed a working environment free of stress.
Id. Recognizing that demotion can “in some cases constitute a constructive discharge,” the Court
holds that “dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or
difficult or unpleasant working conditions are not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person
to resign.” Id. (citing Williams v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 434 (4th Cir. 2004)).
Here, the undisputed facts are clear that Plaintiff was not constructively discharged:
 Booz Allen expressed desire for Plaintiff to remain, and told her she remained eligible for
a Principal-level bonus that year and no salary change would occur. (SOF ¶¶ 13, 17.)
 After the meeting, little changed about Plaintiff’s day-to-day responsibilities and Messrs.
Meyers, Appleby, and Osborne reiterated to Plaintiff that she was a valued member of the
Law Department and that they wanted her to stay. (SOF ¶¶ 6, 13-14, 17.)
 Mr. Meyers took steps to make Plaintiff’s 2011 assessment as positive as possible. The
firm gave Plaintiff a $52,000 bonus in 2011. (SOF ¶¶ 18–22.)
 Mr. Meyers provided Plaintiff with a glowing letter of recommendation at her request
after learning of her intent to resign. (SOF ¶ 25.)
 Plaintiff decided to not only stay with the firm until her replacement was hired, but
assisted with the interview process for her replacement and voluntarily selected her own
departure date. Mr. Meyers offered to cancel the candidate search if Plaintiff would stay.
(SOF ¶¶ 25, 27–28.)
These facts preclude a claim for constructive discharge when compared to the working
conditions of plaintiffs in other cases in which no constructive discharge was found. See e.g.,
Honor, 383 F.3d at 187 (claiming the work environment was “miserable” and “professionally
unfulfilling” and citing other Fourth Circuit cases involving yelling, poor evaluations, and
forcing work while injured). Even if the working conditions were intolerable, no evidence exists
29

Case 1:14-cv-00996-AJT-MSN Document 256 Filed 01/23/15 Page 30 of 32 PageID# 3757

that Booz Allen deliberately created these conditions to pressure Plaintiff to resign. Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s allegations of constructive discharge must fail.
H.

Plaintiff Failed to Avail Herself of Booz Allen’s Attempts to Prevent and
Correct Discrimination and Retaliation.

Booz Allen has a non-retaliation policy that provides for multiple avenues to report
concerns of misconduct or suspected retaliation. (SOF ¶ 36.) Plaintiff was familiar with the
policy and she had conducted investigations under the policy. (SOF ¶ 36.) Plaintiff admitted
that she failed to utilize any of these avenues, and it is undisputed that Plaintiff declined Mr.
Meyers’ direct offer to have the firm investigate her concerns. (SOF ¶¶ 24, 36.)
An employer is entitled to summary judgment when (1) the employer exercised
reasonable care to prevent and correct illegal activity, and (2) the Plaintiff unreasonably failed to
take advantage of such preventative or corrective opportunities provided. Lissau v. S. Food
Serv., 159 F.3d 177, 182 (4th Cir. 1998); see also Walton v. N.C. Dep’t of Agric. & Consumer
Servs., 494 F. App’x 300, 302 (4th Cir. 2012) (discussing the Faragher/Ellerth defense). Booz
Allen exercised reasonable care to prevent discrimination and retaliation by promulgating and
enforcing its policies prohibiting such illegal behavior and offering to investigate Plaintiff’s
claims. Plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of such opportunities. Accordingly, Booz
Allen is entitled to summary judgment on this ground as well.
V.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein and those that may be stated in its reply memorandum and

advanced at the hearing, Defendant respectfully moves this Court to grant it summary judgment
as to all counts, and dismiss Plaintiff’s claims in their entirety with prejudice.
