PLAINTIFF EMERSON HALL ASSOCIATES, L.P.’S
BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF ITS
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT
_____________________________________________________________________________
On December 29, 2015, Defendant Travelers Casualty Insurance Company of
America (“Travelers Insurance”) filed a motion to amend the pleadings to assert a
counterclaim. (DN28.) The Court granted the motion, and Travelers Insurance filed
its amended pleading on January 21, 2016. (DN34.) In this amended pleading,
Travelers Insurance accuses Plaintiff Emerson Hall Associates, L.P. (“Emerson

Hall”) of engaging in fraud both to obtain coverage and to receive payments under
the policies issued by Travelers Insurance. For reasons explained in Emerson Hall’s
proposed amended complaint, Travelers Insurance’s accusations are false, reckless,
defamatory and malicious. Wisconsin law has long recognized that an insurance
company’s baseless accusations of fraudulent conduct by its insureds may give rise
to a bad faith claim; therefore, Emerson Hall respectfully moves the Court for an
order granting Emerson Hall leave to amend its complaint so that it may include
Travelers Insurance’s false accusations of fraud as an additional basis for its bad
faith claim against Travelers Insurance.
In addition, Emerson Hall’s proposed amended pleading clarifies the factual
bases for its claims, including the breach of contract claim. Although the
substantive claim remains the same, the factual allegations are refined and better
explained, which Emerson Hall believes will assist the parties as they engage in
discovery and prepare this case for trial. Therefore, Emerson Hall respectfully
requests leave to amend its complaint for clarification purposes as well.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Rule 15(a) states that leave to file an amended complaint “shall be freely
given when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The Supreme Court has
explained the meaning of “freely given” as used in Rule 15(a)(2):
“Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend ‘shall be freely given
when justice so requires’; this mandate is to be heeded. If the
underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff
may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an
opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of
any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad
faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated

2

failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,
undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of
the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave sought
should, as the rules require, be ‘freely given.’ Of course, the
grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the
discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant
the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the
denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that
discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal
Rules.”

Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 230, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222, 230 (1962)
(internal citations omitted).
Whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading is within a court’s discretion.

929, 107 S. Ct. 3215, 96 L. Ed. 701 (1987). In deciding a motion to amend a
pleading, “[i]t is also proper for the court to consider judicial economy and the most
expeditious way to dispose of the merits of the litigation.” Pabst Brewing Co. v.

Corrao, 176 F.R.D. 552, 557 (E.D. Wis. 1997) aff’d, 161 F.3d 434 (7th Cir. 1998).
Wisconsin courts recognize that any perceived undue prejudice to the opposing
party may be eliminated by extending discovery and rescheduling trial dates. See

Aida Eng’g, Inc. v. Red Stag, Inc., 629 F. Supp. 1121, 1128 (E.D. Wis. 1986).
ARGUMENT
As the parties have engaged in written discovery and early motion practice,
the need for amending pleadings has become apparent. (See Murdock Aff. ¶ 3.)
Travelers Insurance recently amended its pleadings to assert a counterclaim
against Emerson Hall. Prior to Travelers Insurance’s amended pleading, Emerson
Hall did not know that the basis for Travelers Insurance’s attempt to limit coverage

3

or outright refusal to provide coverage was based on Travelers Insurance’s belief
that Emerson Hall engaged in fraud. Travelers Insurance’s counterclaim, however,
filed on January 21, 2016, reveals its basis, as it alleges that it denied coverage
because it believes that Emerson Hall fraudulently obtained the policy, fraudulently
obtained coverage, and fraudulently received insurance payments. This newly
revealed basis for denial of Emerson Hall’s claims constitutes grounds for a bad
faith claim.
Moreover,

Emerson

Hall’s

prior

counsel

recently

withdrew

from

representation, and Emerson Hall’s new counsel was retained two weeks ago. As
new counsel reviewed the case, it became clear that amending the pleadings was
necessary to clarify the factual bases for Emerson Hall’s claims, as it appears that
prior counsel misunderstood the facts or did not clearly articulate them. Tidying up
these issues now will help the parties focus their efforts as they prepare the case.
Good cause exists for allowing Emerson Hall to amend its pleadings:
(1) Emerson Hall has not delayed in its request to amend, filing this motion just two
weeks after retaining new counsel; (2) amendment of the complaint will not unduly
prejudice any of the parties to this case, as the parties are still in early discovery;
and (3) Emerson Hall’s proposed amendment is not futile because it has asserted
valid theories of recovery and facts supporting those theories. Therefore, Emerson
Hall respectfully requests that the Court grant it leave to amend the pleadings.

I.

There Was No Undue Delay in Emerson Hall’s Request to Amend the
Complaint.
On December 29, 2015, Travelers Insurance filed a motion to amend and for

leave to file a counterclaim, and on January 21, 2016, Travelers filed its amended
counterclaim against Emerson Hall. (DN28; DN34). In the amended counterclaim,
Travelers Insurance accuses Emerson Hall of fraudulently obtaining coverage and
fraudulently claiming a covered loss under the Traveler Insurance policies. (DN34,
¶¶ 66–142.) Travelers Insurance’s counterclaim is the first instance where it
disclosed that its basis for withholding policy benefits and attempting to
retroactively deny coverage and recover payments previously made is its belief that
Emerson Hall engaged in fraud.
Good cause exists for Emerson Hall’s proposed amendment to its bad faith
claim because Travelers Insurance only recently revealed its asserted basis for
denying coverage for Emerson Hall’s claims. Emerson Hall’s proposed amendment
primarily relates to and is in response to the amended counterclaim filed by
Travelers on January 21, 2016.
In assessing the timing of Emerson Hall’s request, it is important to note that
Travelers Insurance filed its motion to amend its pleading while Emerson Hall’s
counsel was asking for permission to withdraw from the case. (See DN26, DN28.)
The filing of the motion to withdraw essentially stayed the case until the motion
was decided. The Court allowed Emerson Hall’s prior counsel to withdraw from
representation (see DN39), and Emerson Hall then filed a pro se motion to stay the
case while it sought out new counsel (see DN41). Emerson Hall recently retained

5

new counsel, who filed an appearance on March 7, 2016. (See DN42, DN43). This
motion to amend—Emerson Hall’s first request to amend its pleadings—is being
filed two weeks after retaining new counsel. Emerson Hall has not unduly delayed
in filing its request to amend.
II.

Granting Leave to File the Amended Complaint Will Not Cause Undue
Prejudice to Travelers Insurance.
Amendment of the complaint will not unduly prejudice any of the parties to

this action. In its own motion to amend, Travelers Insurance acknowledged that
additional pleadings and a modified scheduling order were anticipated and likely.
(See DN29, p. 1.) Since that time, the case has been stayed pending the appearance
of substitute counsel for Emerson Hall, and a scheduling conference is set for
March 23, 2016.
This case is not on the eve of trial. Discovery has not closed. Only written
discovery has been exchanged to date, and no depositions have been taken. In fact,
nothing substantive has happened in the case since Travelers Insurance’s amended
pleading was filed on January 21, 2016. Thus, allowing Emerson Hall to amend its
complaint will cause no undue prejudice to Travelers Insurance.
Emerson Hall’s proposed amendments to the complaint also will help the
parties expeditiously prepare this case for trial. Discovery on Travelers Insurance’s
amended counterclaim and Emerson Hall’s amended bad faith claim will involve the
same subject matter and should be dealt with at the same time. Emerson Hall also
revised other allegations in its complaint related to its breach of contract claim in
an effort to clarify its claim and expedite discovery. The substance of the allegations

6

is the same; however, additional allegations are provided in support of this claim,
such as references to policy provisions and clarification of the factual bases for
Emerson Hall’s claim for breach of contract. These revised allegations will not
expand the scope of the case. (See Murdock Aff. ¶¶ 4, 5.)
This amendment is necessary because it appears from Travelers Insurance’s
amended counterclaim that there is a misunderstanding as to the basis of aspects of
Emerson Hall’s claim. For example, in paragraphs 129 through 131 of the amended
counterclaim, Travelers Insurance accuses Emerson Hall of seeking a double
recovery for a $32 per month utility allowance per rental unit. (DN34, ¶¶ 129–131.)
What Emerson Hall seeks to clarify, however, is that it is seeking recovery of the
extra expenses it had once the utilities reverted back to Emerson Hall on account of
the property becoming uninhabitable. This clarification is set forth in the amended
complaint, along with others. The result of the amendments is that the parties will
be better able to efficiently and narrowly focus their discovery efforts as they
prepare this case for trial.
III.

The Proposed Amendment Is Not Futile.
A motion to amend may be denied as futile if it lacks a valid theory of

recovery or fails to allege facts supporting the theory alleged. Aida Eng’g, 629 F.
Sup. at 1127. Here, Emerson Hall’s proposed amendment is not futile because it has
asserted valid theories of recovery and alleged facts supporting the theories alleged.
Emerson Hall proposes to amend its complaint to assert that Travelers
Insurance’s use of fraud allegations as a basis for denying coverage constitutes bad
faith. Wisconsin courts have long recognized that insurance companies who attempt
7

to avoid their coverage obligations by baselessly accusing their insureds of engaging
in fraud or other wrongful conduct may give rise to a bad faith claim. For example,
in Miller v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 683 F.3d 805 (7th Cir. 2012), the insurance
company refused to provide coverage on the basis that it believed that the insureds
had falsely represented their knowledge of the conditions of the loss when they
obtained coverage. Id. at 812. In affirming the district court’s bad faith finding, the
Seventh Circuit noted that that insurance company’s denial of coverage rested on
“dubious justifications,” as there was no evidence that the insureds had known
about the loss before obtaining coverage. Id. Likewise, in Upthegrove Hardware,

Inc. v. Pennsylvania Lumbermans Mut. Ins. Co., 146 Wis. 2d 470, 483, 431 N.W.2d
689, 695 (Ct. App. 1988), the insurance company was determined to have acted in
bad faith by accusing its insured of arson without having a good faith belief that the
fire was caused by arson. See also Weiss v. United Fire & Cas. Co., 197 Wis. 2d 365,
390–91, 541 N.W.2d 753, 762 (1995) (insurance company acted in bad faith where it
recklessly accused its insured of arson without a proper investigation). Thus, bad
faith is a valid theory of recovery in this case.
As for the breach of contract claim, courts across the country have allowed
insureds to assert breach of contract claims when insurance companies fail to
provide coverage as required by the insurance policy. See, e.g., Miller, 683 F.3d at
809. Thus, breach of contract is a valid theory of recovery in this case.
Emerson Hall also has alleged facts to support the theories alleged. Rule 8 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a party to include in its complaint a

8

short and plain statement of the claim showing that the plaintiff is entitled to relief,
as well as a demand for appropriate relief. Although bare legal conclusions will not
satisfy the rule, “detailed factual allegations” are not required. Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Emerson Hall’s
proposed amended complaint contains more than sufficient detail with withstand a
Rule 8 challenge. (See Murdock Aff. ¶ 6, Ex. A.)
CONCLUSION
Emerson Hall’s proposed amendment does not bring any new claims; rather,
it clarifies the bases of its claims and asserts a new bad faith ground, which was
only recently revealed by Travelers Insurance. In its own motion to amend,
Travelers Insurance acknowledged that additional pleadings and a modified
scheduling order were anticipated and likely. (See DN29, p. 1.) Since that time, the
case has been stayed pending the appearance of substituted counsel for Emerson
Hall, and a scheduling conference is set for March 23, 2016. Thus, Emerson Hall’s
proposed amendment will not impact any existing schedule.
Pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), Emerson Hall has established good cause, as set
forth above, for an order permitting Emerson Hall to file the proposed amended
complaint included with this motion. (See Murdock Aff. ¶ 6, Ex. A.) Therefore,
Emerson Hall respectfully requests that the Court grant its motion to amend the
pleadings.
