Case 2:06-cv-00526-DB-DN Document20 _ Filed 01/19/2007 Page2of3

The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1915(e), permits the court to appoint
counsel to represent an indigent plaintiff. But "[t]he burden is upon the applicant to convince the
court that there is sufficient merit to his claim to warrant the appointment of counsel." McCarthy
v. Weinberg, 753 F.2d 836, 838 (10th Cir. 1985). For the reasons set forth in the Church
Defendants' motion to dismiss, Ruston's claims are frivolous. Counsel should not be appointed.

Ruston's claims should be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1915(e)(2)(B)() and (ii).

DATED this arr, of January, 2007.
