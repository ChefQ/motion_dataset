"MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

Comes now, Plaintiff, Lester Jon Ruston, and files this, his Motion for

Appointment of Counsel, and would show as follows:
I.

That the Plaintiff is indigent and was granted I.F.P. status in this
matter. The Court has refused to issue service, for reasons unknown, despite
Rule 4(c)(2) of the Fed.R.Civ.P. and 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1915. Plaintiff asserts that
he cannot afford counsel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1915(e)(1), and that he does
need counsel to effect service properly upon the Defendants, and assist in
gaining immediate injunctive relief. The Defendants continue to engage in acts
of "witness tampering" with the U.S. Attorney of the N.D. Texas, Dallas Division,
in furtherance of R.1.C.0. Racketeering Acts (see Exhibit A attached~7 pages),
which clearly shows the U.S. Attorney has engaged in "fraud" to cover up the
alleged civil and constitutional deprivations by the Defendants. When these
conditions exist, the Courts have ruled the appointment of counsel is approp-
riate in Moore v. Mabus, 976 F.2d 268 (5th Cir. 1992).

| II.

Defendant, Allison Ruston-Smith has conspired to commit kidnapping, bribery,
torture, witness tampering with Dallas County, which is "public record" in
Ruston v. Dallas County, et al. 3:06-CV-1582-M N.D. Tex., Dallas Division, a

related civil matter. Defendants Smith and Margaret Ruston committed fraud in

-1-

 
Case 2:06-cv-00526-DB-DN Document19 Filed 01/16/2007 Page2of9

2001, as alleged in this complaint, and continue to engage in attempts to have
Plaintiff harmed, while in illegal custody. When these conditions exist, the
Courts have ruled the appointment of counsel is appropriate in Montgomery v.
Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 499 (3rd Cr. 2000).

Ill.

Plaintiff has attempted to obtain pro-bono counsel, Jamie Zenger, Federal
Public Defender, Center for Constitutional Rights and the ACLU to assist, with-
out success. When these conditions exist, and Plaintiff is in danger, the courts
have ruled appointment of counsel is appropriate in Zarnes v. Rhodes, 64 F.3d 285
(7th Cir. 1995).

Wherefore, premises considered, Plaintiff, Lester Jon Ruston, does file
this, his Motion to Appoint Counsel, and does move the Court to Grant this motion
for all reasons alleged herein, and in attached #xhibit A.

Respdctfully Submitted,
