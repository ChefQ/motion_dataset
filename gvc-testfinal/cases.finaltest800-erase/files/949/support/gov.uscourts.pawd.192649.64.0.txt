I.

INTRODUCTION
Defendant Accuray Incorporated (“Accuray”) hereby moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of

Civil Procedure 37(a), to compel Plaintiff Best Medical International, Inc. (“Best Medical”) to
produce the Initial Patent Disclosures required under Local Patent Rule 3.1 and this Court’s Case
Management/Scheduling Order issued on May 12, 2011 (Doc. No. 55). Without explanation,
Best Medical has failed to produce the most basic documents required by the Local Patent Rules
and the Court’s Order.
Pursuant to this Court’s Case Management/Scheduling Order, the parties were required to
exchange their Initial Patent Disclosures on May 26, 2011. Best Medical requested an extension
of that deadline. Accuray stipulated to extend the deadline until June 1, 2011, and the Court
granted the extension (Doc. No 59). Even after receiving this extension of time, however, Best
Medical failed to produce meaningful disclosures. As further discussed below, Best Medical has
failed to produce critical documents called for under Local Patent Rule 3.1 – documents that are
uniquely within its possession, custody and control, such as invention disclosures and other
documents relating to the conception and reduction to practice of the claimed invention, as well
as sales and offers for sale of the claimed invention. Best Medical has not even produced the
prosecution history of the patents-in-suit!
Accuray has made good faith efforts to resolve this issue with Best Medical, but has
received no response. Indeed, by letters dated June 3, 2011 and June 9, 2011, Accuray
specifically pointed out the various deficiencies in Best Medical’s document production and
requested that Best Medical immediately supplement its disclosures. See Exhibits 1 and 2, June
3, 2011 letter from Madison C. Jellins to Brit Groom; June 9, 2011 letter from Madison C. Jellins
to Brit Groom. Best Medical has not responded to (or even acknowledged) Accuray’s June 3rd
and June 9th letters, much less cured the deficiencies in its production.

While Local Patent Rule 3.2 permits a plaintiff to supplement its Initial Patent
Disclosures document production at the time it serves its Disclosure of Asserted Claims and
Infringement Contentions, Best Medical did not make use of that opportunity to cure the
deficiencies in its production. Instead, after having been put on notice of specific deficiencies in
its document production, Best Medical did not produce a single document to Accuray when it
served its Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Infringement Contentions on June 13, 2011. Nor
did Best Medical answer Defendant’s letters requesting production or an explanation. Given
Best Medical’s refusal to remedy its Initial Patent Disclosures despite several opportunities,
Accuray is left with no other recourse than to seek the Court’s assistance to compel meaningful
disclosures.
Accuray has maintained from the inception of this case that Best Medical did not have a
reasonable basis for filing suit. Apparently, Best Medical now agrees, at least with respect to the
‘619 patent. Just minutes before serving its Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Infringement
Contentions, Best Medical’s in-house counsel, Brit Groom, contacted Accuray’s litigation
counsel by e-mail. Best Medical did not address the deficiencies in its Initial Disclosures, but
instead advised Accuray that it intends to drop its claims related to one of the patents-in-suit,
U.S. Patent No. 5,596,619 (the “’619 patent”). See Exhibit 3, June 13, 2011 E-Mail from Brit
Groom to Madison Jellins. In that e-mail, Best Medical indicated that it has decided to file a
motion to dismiss Count 1 of the Amended Complaint (Doc. No.34 ) –which alleges direct
infringement of the ’619 patent against Accuray – “after working on the claims chart this
weekend and preparing for today’s Disclosure of Asserted Claims.” (Exhibit 3). The most
reasonable inference that can be drawn from this statement is that, in preparing its claim charts
for its Infringement Contentions, Best Medical concluded that it does not have a viable claim

2

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 64 Filed 06/15/11 Page 4 of 10

against Accuray for direct infringement of the ’619 patent. Best Medical’s admission that it is
unable to prepare a claim chart for the ’619 patent reinforces Accuray’s belief that Best Medical
failed to conduct a proper factual investigation and analysis pursuant to Rule 11 prior to filing its
initial Complaint (based solely on the ’619 patent) in August, 2010 (Doc. No. 1) or its Amended
Complaint (based on the ’619, ’1751 and ’2832 patents) in December, 2011 (Doc. No. 34). See
Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.
Given this recent development and its history of pursuing specious claims, if Best
Medical actually intends to maintain an action based on the sole remaining patent in this case, it
must supplement its Initial Disclosures immediately.
II.

Local Patent Rule 3.1 Requires Plaintiff to Produce Specific Documents
Under Local Patent Rule 3.1, Best Medical was required to produce the following

categories of documents with its Initial Disclosures:
All documents (e.g., contracts, purchase orders, invoices, advertisements,
marketing materials, offer letters, beta site testing agreement, and third party or
joint development agreements) sufficient to evidence each discussion with,
disclosure to, or other manner of providing to a third party, or sale of or offer to
sell or other manner of transfer, the claimed invention prior to the date of
application for the patent in suit. A party’s production of a document as required
herein shall not constitute an admission that such document evidences or is prior
art under 35 U.S.C. § 102.
All documents evidencing the conception, reduction to practice, design and
development of each claimed invention, which were created on or before the date
of application for the patent in suit or a priority date otherwise identified for the
patent in suit, whichever is earlier; and
All documents evidencing communications to and from the U.S. Patent Office for
each patent in suit and for each patent on which a claim for priority is based.

U.S. Patent No. 7,266,175.

2

U.S. Patent No. 6,038,283.

3

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 64 Filed 06/15/11 Page 5 of 10

Local Patent Rule 3.1. Local Patent Rule 3.1 further provides that “[t]he producing party
shall separately identify by production number which documents correspond to each
category.” Id.
III.

Best Medical’s LPR 3.1 Document Production Violates the Local Patent
Rules and This Court’s Order
Best Medical’s document production consists of only 61 pages, and omits key documents

that were required to be produced under the Local Patent Rules and this Court’s Case
Management/Scheduling Order (Doc. No. 55). For the Court’s reference, Best Medical’s
document production pursuant to Local Patent Rule 3.1 is attached in its entirety as Exhibit 4
hereto. As the Court will see from Exhibit 4, Best Medical produced only the following
documents with its Initial Patent Disclosures:
(1) the text of U.S. Patent 5,596,619 (which Best Medical now seeks to dismiss from
this suit) which appears to have been printed from the website of the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (Exhibit 4 at P-12 to P-35);
(2) a patent assignment abstract of title for the ’619 patent, which appears to have been
printed from the website of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Exhibit 4 at P-36);
(3) a “Statement under 37 CFR 3.73(b)” regarding the assignment of an unidentified
patent (Exhibit 4 at P-37);
(4) the text of U.S. Patent 6,038,283, which appears to have been printed from the
website of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Exhibit 4 at P-38 to P-60);
(5) a “Statement under 37 CFR 3.73(b)” regarding the assignment of an unidentified
patent (Exhibit 4 at P-61); and
(6) information regarding Accuray’s CyberKnife VSI system, which appears to have been
printed from Accuray’s website (Exhibit 4 at P-1 to P-11).

4

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 64 Filed 06/15/11 Page 6 of 10

Noticeably absent from Best Medical’s LPR 3.1 document production were documents in
each of the categories specified in Local Patent Rule 3.1. For example, Best Medical did not
produce a single document relating to:


the conception, reduction to practice, design and development of the claimed
invention;



the communications to and from the U.S. Patent Office during the prosecution of
the patents-in-suit; or



any sales or offers for sale or disclosures of the claimed invention.

It is inconceivable that Best Medical does not have at least the following documents in its
possession, custody or control: (i) the file history of the patents-in-suit, (ii) invention disclosures
related to the patents-in-suit, (iii) inventor notebooks and other design documents related to the
conception and reduction to practice of the claimed inventions; (iv) drawings and schematics
related to the conception and reduction to practice of the claimed inventions; and (v) sales
invoices, contracts, purchase orders, marketing materials, and/or development agreements related
to the claimed inventions, among other relevant documents. Nevertheless, Best Medical has
failed to produce any of these documents. Most importantly, Best Medical has failed to provide
any explanation as to why it did not produce these documents, and has ignored two letters from
Accuray which specifically pointed out these deficiencies and requested immediate production of
these materials. (Exhibits 1 and 2).
Best Medical’s failure to produce these critical documents without any explanation and
its failure to respond to Accuray’s letters on this issue violates both the Local Patent Rules and
this Court’s Case Management/Scheduling Order (Doc. No. 55). Best Medical should be
compelled to cure these deficiencies immediately.

IV.

Best Medical Has Repeatedly Pursued Baseless Claims and Violated this
Court’s Rules
Since the inception of this case, Best Medical has engaged in a pattern of conduct which

raises legitimate questions as to whether it conducted a proper pre-filing investigation pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and has acted in good faith in bringing this case. Best Medical first asserted
specious, legally unfounded claims of direct and indirect infringement against four of Accuray’s
Individual Employees. Best Medical’s claims against the Individual Employees were ultimately
dismissed (Doc. No. 46), but only after the Individual Defendants had been dragged through this
suit for months and prevailed on two motions to dismiss. (Doc. Nos. 33, 46). In its Amended
Complaint, Best Medical added two patents (the ‘283 patent and the ‘175 patent) (Doc. No 34).
The allegations based on the ’175 patent against Accuray were dismissed entirely upon
Accuray’s second motion to dismiss. Best Medical’s specious allegations against Accuray for
indirect infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,038,283 ultimately were also dismissed upon
Accuray’s second motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 46).
Now, as discussed above, on the date that its Infringement Contentions were due, Best
Medical informed Accuray’s counsel that it intends to move to dismiss its claim for infringement
of the ’619 patent. Best Medical stated that it decided not to pursue this claim “after working on
the claims chart this weekend and preparing for today's Disclosure of Asserted Claims.” (Exhibit
3). This admission that Best Medical is unable to draft an infringement claim chart based on the
’619 patent raises legitimate questions of whether Best Medical pursued its claims against
Accuray (and the Individual Defendants) for over ten months before conducting a proper
infringement analysis under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.
To make matters worse, Best Medical has disregarded this Court’s rules on more than
one occasion. For example, Plaintiff previously disregarded this Court’s November 15, 2010

6

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 64 Filed 06/15/11 Page 8 of 10

Order which permitted it to “file a brief no more than eight pages in rebuttal to Accuray’s Reply
Brief [in support of its original motion to dismiss].” (Doc. No. 28) As the Court noted in its
Order granting Accuray’s motion to strike Plaintiff’s Sur-Reply Brief, Plaintiff intentionally
disregarded the applicable rules in an attempt to obtain unfair advantage. (Doc. No. 33 at p. 2)
Now, with its Initial Disclosures, Plaintiff has again disregarded the rules of this Court by
withholding key documents that were required to be produced – documents that Accuray needs
in order to prepare its Invalidity Contentions – and refusing to respond to Accuray’s June 3rd and
June 9th letters regarding these deficiencies. This appears to be yet another deliberate effort to
evade mandatory requirements intended to establish a fair and level playing field and, as such,
should not be condoned. See id.
V.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants request that the Court enter an order compelling

Best Medical to produce proper Initial Patent Disclosures, including all of the documents
required to be produced under Local Patent Rule 3.1.
