NOTICE OF MOTION

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT Riverbed Technology, Inc. ("Riverbed") hereby
moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss Quantum Corporation's
("Quantum's") patent infringement claims under U.S. Patent No. 5,990,810 ("the '810 Patent") for
lack of standing. Quantum did not own or have all substantial rights in the '810 Patent when it
filed its complaint on August 14, 2007 and therefore this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
over Quantum's claims.

This motion is set for hearing on February 14, 2008 at 8:00 a.m. Riverbed believes that
this motion should be heard on an expedited basis and that discovery and all Patent Local Rule
disclosures relating to Quantum's claims under the '810 patent should be stayed pending the
resolution of its motion to dismiss. Riverbed will be requesting that Quantum stipulate to an
expedited hearing and stay of discovery today and intends to move the Court on these issues if
Quantum does not agree by the close of business on January 10, 2008.

This motion is based upon the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the
supporting declaration of Todd M. Briggs and its accompanying exhibits, and such other matters

as may be presented at the time of the hearing and allowed by the Court.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I. INTRODUCTION

This motion presents a critical jurisdictional issue that should be resolved at an
early stage in this litigation. When Quantum filed this action on August 14, 2007, it alleged in its
original complaint that it was the exclusive licensee of the '810 Patent. Subsequent discovery has
revealed that Quantum's contention was false. In truth, as of the filing date of its complaint,
Quantum held no rights in the `810 Patent. Quantum was neither an assignee, nor an exclusive
licensee, nor even a bare licensee. After Riverbed's discovery exposed this truth, i
ee
Fo However, under well-settled Federal Circuit law, initial standing defects in patent

infringement cases cannot be cured by post-filing assignments or licensing agreements. Thus, | |

a cis 20: 1c

Quantum's lack of standing. Because Quantum did not have standing when it filed the present
lawsuit, its patent infringement claims under the `$10 Patent should be dismissed for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b\(1). Riverbed's
counterclaims for declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity of that patent should
also be dismissed. Riverbed's counterclaim for patent infringement under U.S. Patent No.
7,116,249 against Quantum, however, should proceed in this Court according to schedule since

this Court has proper jurisdiction over this claim.

 

' Riverbed has filed a declaratory judgment action against Quantum, A.C.N. 120, and Rocksoft for
invalidity and non-infringement of the `810 Patent in Delaware on today's date. Both Quantum and
Riverbed are incorporated in the state of Delaware. Riverbed should be allowed to proceed on its claims in
Delaware even if Quantum attempts to refile an action in the Northern District of California or another
district court. See, e.g., PE Corp. v. Affymetrix, Inc., 2001 WL 1180280, at *3 (D. Del. 2001) (granting
defendant's motion to dismiss original action filed in Delaware where plaintiff did not have standing to
assert the patent-at-issue and defendant had filed declaratory judgment action in Southern District of New
York prior to filing the motion to dismiss).

Case 3:07-cv-04161-WHA Document35 Filed 01/09/2008 Page 5of12

I. BACKGROUND

A. Quantum Claims Standing As An "Exclusive Licensee" To The `810 Patent In
Its Complaint

On August 14, 2007, Quantum brought suit against Riverbed for infringement of
the `810 Patent. In its complaint, Quantum purported to be the "exclusive licensee" to the *810
Patent, which it also alleged was owned by its subsidiary, Rocksoft Limited ("Rocksoft").
(Docket No. 1, 7 8.) In answering the complaint, Riverbed asserted a number of affirmative
defenses, including failure to state a claim and lack of standing. In addition, Riverbed
counterclaimed against Quantum for, inter alia, declaratory judgments of invalidity and non-
infringement of the `810 Patent. (Docket No. 20.)

B. Riverbed's Discovery Relating To Quantum's Standing

On November 2, 2007, the parties held their Rule 26(f) conference, and discovery
commenced immediately thereafter. In its first set of interrogatories, Riverbed propounded an
interrogatory requesting all facts supporting any contention by Quantum that it had standing to sue
for infringement of the `810 Patent, "including a detailed description of all grants and transfers of
any ownership interest in the `810 Patent since the filing of the patent application that resulted in
the issuance of the `810 patent." (Briggs Decl., Ex. A, Interrogatory No. 8.

Cc. Quantum's First Response To Riverbed's Interrogatory Shows An Incomplete
Chain Of Title To Quantum

On December 3, 2007, Quantum responded to Riverbed's first round of discovery.
In answering Interrogatory No. 8, Quantum gave no written explanation for its contention that it
had standing to assert the `810 Paterit. (Briggs Decl., Ex. B.) Instead, pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 33(d), Quantum produced documents that showed various assignments between
Trustus Pty. Ltd. ("Trustus") and Rocksoft Limited ("Rocksoft") culminating in an assignment
dated November 1, 2004 where "Trustus hereby assigns absolutely to Rocksoft . . . title and

RE! Recognizing the
deficiency, Riverbed wrote to Quantum on December 10, 2007, requesting that Quantum
supplement its response to demonstrate that a complete chain of title or transfer of rights existed or
admit that it lacked standing to assert the `810 patent. (Briggs Decl., Ex. E.) On December 17,
2007, Quantum responded to Riverbed's request for more complete information, stating in a letter
that it was "investigating [the issue] further" and would supplement its responses by December 24,
2007. (Briggs Decl., Ex. F.)
D. Quantum's Supplemental Response To Riverbed's Interrogatory Shows That

Quantum Attempted To Repair The Chain Of Title After The Filing Of Its

Complaint

On December 24, 2007, Quantum provided its supplemental response to Riverbed's
Interrogatory No. 8. (Briggs Decl., Ex. G.) In this response, Quantum provided more detail as to
the relationships between Quantum, Rocksoft, and A.C.N. 120 and produced four pages of
responsive documents pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33(d) (labeled QU 000663-
666). Quantum stated that A.C.N. 120 "owns" Rocksoft Pty. Ltd. as a "wholly-owned subsidiary"
and that Quantum is the "parent company" to both A.C.N. and Rocksoft Pty. Ltd. (Briggs Decl.,

Ex. G at 20-22.)

 

3 Quantum's supplemental response also explained that Rocksoft Limited had changed its name to
Rocksoft Pty. Ltd. "during the last 12 months." (Briggs Decl., Ex. G at 20-22.)

Il. ARGUMENT

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) authorizes the dismissal of a claim for
lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because a party's standing to sue is a matter of the Court's
jurisdiction, Rule 12(b)(1) is an appropriate vehicle to challenge standing. See White v. Lee, 227
F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000) ("Because standing . . . pertain[s] to a federal court's subject-
matter jurisdiction under Article III, [it is] properly raised in a motion to dismiss under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), not Rule 12(b)(6)."). When considering a motion to dismiss
under Rule 12(b)(1), the Court is not confined to the face of-the pleadings, but may review
evidence and affidavits in making its decision. McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d
558, 560 (9th Cir. 1988). The Court therefore "need not presume the truthfulness of the
plaintiff['s] allegations." White, 227 F.3d at 1242.

A, Quantum's Claims For Infringement Of The '810 Patent Should Be Dismissed
By This Court

"Standing is a `threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of
the court to entertain the suit.'" Alcatel USA, Inc. v. Orckit Commc'ns., No. C 99-04468 SI, 2000
WL 502846, at *2 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)). The rule
is no different for patent cases: a plaintiff suing for patent infringement must establish, as a
fundamental prerequisite to a court's jurisdiction, that it has standing to sue. See Paradise
Creations, Inc. v. UV Sales, Inc., 315 F.3d 1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The burden of
establishing standing falls on the party asserting that it exists, in this case Quantum. See Ortho
Pharm. Corp. v. Genetics Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 1032-33 (Fed. Cir. 1995).

To have standing to sue for damages for patent infringement, a party must
generally hold legal title to the patent during the time of the alleged infringement. See Rite-Hite
Corp. v. Kelley Co., Inc., 56 F.3d 1538, 1551-52 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc); Arachnid, Inc. v.
Merit Indus., Inc., 939 F.2d 1574, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In this case, by purporting to be an
exclusive licensee, Quantum has admitted that it does not hold legal title to the `810 patent | |

Case 3:07-cv-04161-WHA Document35 Filed 01/09/2008 Page 9 of 12

The only other basis for Quantum to have standing is to show that it has obtained,
through assignment or license, "ail substantial rights" in the `810 patent." See Prima Tek If, L.L.C.
y. A-Roo Co., 222 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2000); see also Alcatel, 2000 WL at *2 ("[I]f `all
substantial rights' are transferred to a licensee, the licensee, in certain circumstances, becomes a
`virtual assignee,' and has standing alone to sue infringers."). A defect in initial standing,
however, "cannot be cured after the inception of the lawsuit." Paradise Creations, 315 F.3d at
1310 (holding that post-filing addition of a party with standing will not cure a lack of initial
standing). Where, as here, standing to sue for patent infringement depends on a written
instrument, that instrument must be executed before the filing of the complaint. See Enzo APA &
Son, Inc. v. Geapag AG, 134 F.3d 1090, 1093-1094 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Gaia Techs., Inc. v.
Reconversion Techs., Inc., 93 F.3d 774, 779-780 (Fed Cir. 1996) amended by 104 F.3d 1296 (Fed
Cir. 1996).

Despite being given multiple opportunities to demonstrate that it held all substantial
rights in the `810 Patent before filing suit, Quantum could only show that, at best, PF

 

0x00B0 Although it is well-settled in the Federal Circuit that an exclusive license must transfer all substantial
rights and must be in writing "to be considered a virtual assignment to assert standing," Enzo APA & Son,
Inc. v. Geapag AG, 134 F.3d 1090, 1093-94 (Fed. Cir. 1998), in this district there is a lone unpublished
order to the contrary wherein a parent company was found to have standing as an exclusive licensee solely
through its relationship with the true patent owner, its subsidiary. Atmel Corp. v. Authentec, Inc., No. C 06-
2138 CW (N_D. Cal. June 11, 2007) (order denying defendant's motion to dismiss). The Atmel order
should not be followed for several reasons. First, it is wrongly decided under Federal Circuit law because it
holds that an exclusive license that confers initial standing need not be in writing. See Enzo, 134 F.3d
1093-94. Second, even if it is a correct application of the governing law, which it is not, the decision is
distinguishable because there the patent owner had never granted rights in the patent-at-issue to any party
other than the named plaintiff, the hamed plaintiff had "always acted as the exclusive licensee," and the
named plaintiff joined the true owner of that patent before the motion to dismiss was filed. Jd. None of
those facts are present here. Third, following Atmel would give rise to exactly the same undesirable
outcome that motivated the Federal Circuit in Gaia and Enzo to dismiss for lack of standing: "Permitting
non-owners . . . the right to sue, so long as they eventually obtain the rights they seek to have redressed,
would enmesh the judiciary in abstract disputes, risk multiple litigation, and provide incentives for parties
to obtain assignment in order to expand their arsenal and the scope of litigation. Inevitably, delay and
expense would be the order of the day." Enzo, 34 F.3d 1093-94; Gaia, 93 F.3d at 780.

ne cderal Circuit law clearly

prohibits initial standing defects from being cured through nunc pro tunc agreements. Enzo, 134
F.3d at 1093 (holding that nune pro tunc license agreement reflecting earlier oral agreement
entered into after lawsuit was filed could not cure standing defect); Gaia, 93 F.3d at 781 (vacating
full jury trial on the merits where plaintiff attempted to cure standing defect through a post-filing
nunc pro tunc patent assignment). Indeed, not even a motion to amend to join the true patent
owner could have cured Quantum's lack of standing. See Paradise Creations, 315 F.3d at 1310
(motion to join patentee cannot cure initial lack of standing where "[named plaintiff] held no
enforceable rights whatsoever in the patent at the time it filed suit, and therefore lacked a
cognizable injury necessary to assert standing"); Alcatel, 2000 WL at *4 (denying plaintiff's
request to amend complaint in order to show standing "because there is no set of facts which
would grant plaintiff standing as of [the filing date]"). In sum, once it initiated this lawsuit, there
was nothing Quantum could do and nothing it now can do to retroactively gain standing.

Thus, because Quantum held no rights in the `810 Patent as of August 14, 2007 and
therefore lacked standing when it filed suit against Riverbed, this Court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over Quantum's claims under the `810 Patent and those claims should be
dismissed.

B. Riverbed's Counterclaims For Non-Infringement And Invalidity Of The '810
Patent Should Be Dismissed By This Court

If the named plaintiff lacks standing to assert a patent, it "[cannot] defend a claim
of non-infringement [of that patent] on behalf of . . . the real party in interest," the patent owner, or
the holder of ali substantial rights in the patent. H.R. Techs., Inc. v. Astechnologies, Inc., 275 F.3d
1378, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Thus, when granting a motion to dismiss on lack of standing

grounds, it is proper for the court to dismiss all counterclaims targeting the patent-at-issue because
