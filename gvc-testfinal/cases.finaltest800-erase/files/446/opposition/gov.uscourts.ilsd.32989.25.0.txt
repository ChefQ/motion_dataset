Case No. 05-190-GPM
Judge G. Patrick Murphy

DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMICUS BRIEF
Ordinarily, the carriers would not object to the filing of an amicus brief. However, the
Motion for Leave to File comes months after the parties briefed and submitted their motions for
summary judgment, and, if anything, demonstrates the resolution of this case is necessary for
productive collective bargaining to take place over the underlying labor dispute.
The proffered amicus brief adds nothing to the issues before the Court. The amicus
claims that the carriers’ proposal regarding the FELA is not a mandatory subject of bargaining.
We said we agree with that proposition in our previous briefs. But the amicus does not purport
to explain why the carriers’ alternative wage reduction proposal is not a mandatory subject of
bargaining, which it plainly is, however “impossible” it may be for the amicus to conceive of
wage reductions. We also frankly question whether a nonparty that has not been granted leave to
intervene as a party should be allowed to use an “amicus” brief as a vehicle for an attempt to
embellish the record the parties to this case have made.

In these circumstances it would not be inappropriate for the Court to reject the proffered
filing. If the Court does grant leave to file, we believe the contentions advanced by the amicus
are fully answered in our previous briefs, so we shall not burden the Court with further briefing.
In any event, it has become clear that the underlying collective bargaining dispute cannot
be resolved as long as this case remains pending, so Defendants respectfully urge the Court to
issue a decision as expeditiously as possible and send the parties on their way.
