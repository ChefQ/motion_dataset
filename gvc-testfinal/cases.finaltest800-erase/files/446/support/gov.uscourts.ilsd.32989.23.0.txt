MOTION OF THE RAIL LABOR BARGAINING COALITION
FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF

The Rail Labor Bargaining Coalition ("RLBC") hereby moves for leave to
file an amicus curiae brief in support of the position asserted by the plaintiff,
United Transportation Union, in this litigation. As shown below, the RLBC is
encountering conduct by the National Carriers Conference Committee ("NCCC"),
allegedly in derogation of the carriers' bargaining obligation under 0x00A7 2, First of the
Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. 0x00A7 152, First, during this round of national handling
that is quite similar to the carriers' conduct at issue in this proceeding. That fact

alone assures that the movant possesses a special interest in this case, and that the
Case 3:05-cv-00190-GPM -CJP Document 23 Filed 03/06/06 Page2of5 Page ID #485

matters asserted in the proposed amicus brief accompanying this motion are
relevant to its final disposition.

This motion is supported by the following facts and circumstances:

l. The RLBC is an unincorporated association comprised of seven (7)
so-called "standard rail labor organizations," '/ each of which represents craft or
class employees working for the nation's rail carriers, including the defendant
Class I freight railroads which are parties to this action (Exh. B). Nearly one-half
of all unionized employees in the industry are represented by the RLBC's
members.

2. As the designated "representative" of its organization members, the
RLBC bargains with the NCCC which represents many, if not all, Class I rail
carriers in this round of national handling. The NCCC serves as bargaining agent
for each of the defendants (Exh. A).

3. The current round of national handling began on or about November
1, 2004 when the NCCC served 0x00A7 6 Notices, advising RLBC members and other
standard rail labor organizations, including plaintiff United Transportation Union,
of changes the carriers proposed to make in the rates of pay, rules and working

conditions of their employees (Exh. A). On January 3, 2005, the RLBC served a 0x00A7

 

i American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA); Brotherhood of Locomotive

Engineers and Trainmen (BLET); Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes
(BMWED); Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS); International Brotherhood of
Boilermakers (IBB); National Conference of Firemen and Oilers (NCFO); and the Sheet
Metal Workers International Association (SMWIA).
Case 3:05-cv-00190-GPM -CJP Document 23 Filed 03/06/06 Page3of5 Page ID #486

6 Notice on the NCCC, advising of wage, rule and benefit changes common to all
seven crafts that it sought to obtain during bargaining (Exh. B). */

4. The NCCC's 0x00A7 6 Notice to each of the RLBC's organization
members contained a proposal calling for the development of "a joint legislative
proposal governing employee compensation for on-the-job injuries . .. ." to
replace the current fault-based system prescribed by the Federal Employers'
Liability Act. The Notice went on to state: "If a joint legislative proposal . . . is
not developed and enacted, all rates of pay will be reduced by an amount that
represent the excess costs to the railroads attributable to FELA" (Exh. A).

5. The NCCC's notice of intended change in national legislation is not
a "rate of pay, rule or working condition" over which the RLBC and its member
organizations are obliged to bargain by the Railway Labor Act. To the contrary,
the carriers' proposal will hinder and delay wage negotiations and frustrate
agreement over pay rates.

6. No substantive discussions over rates of pay occurred between the
RLBC and the NCCC during 2005 before December 16", when the NCCC
declared an impasse and requested the National Mediation Board to proffer
arbitration under 0x00A7 5, First of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. 0x00A7 155, First (Exh.
C). The purpose of the NCCC's request was to obtain a release from mediation

which, in turn, would lead to the parties' exercise of self-help in support of their 0x00A7

 

2 Other notices not germane to this litigation were served by RLBC-represented

organizations on the NCCC and the carriers it represents during this bargaining round.
Case 3:05-cv-00190-GPM -CJP Document 23 Filed 03/06/06 Page 4of5 Page ID #487

6 Notices, or the appointment of an Emergency board under 0x00A7 10 of the RLA, 45
U.S.C. 0x00A7 160. It was objected to by the RLBC (Exh. D).

7. The NCCC did not withdraw its joint legislative proposal before
declaring an impasse. Although the NCCC advised the National Mediation Board,
on February 13, 2006, that it was "voluntarily withdrawing [its] release request," it
continues to stand on its joint legislative proposal, along with all other proposed
changes described in its 0x00A7 6 Notice. The stated reason for withdrawing its release
request was to "ensure that [the NCCC's] dispute with the RLBC does not reach a
crisis point while . . . [its] bargaining dispute with UTU (and other organizations)
remains unresolved" (Exh. E).

WHEREFORE, the RLBC has a special interest in the subject-matter of this
litigation and is able to present information pertinent to the UTU's second claim
for relief due to the progress of the bargaining dispute between the RLBC and the

NCCC; thus, the RLBC's motion for leave to file the accompanying amicus brief

should be granted.
