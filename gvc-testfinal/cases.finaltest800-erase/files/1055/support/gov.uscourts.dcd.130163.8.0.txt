EDWARD ADAMS

Cr. No. 08-0058 (TFH)

MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT THEREOF
Defendant Edward Adams, through counsel, respectfully moves the Court, to suppress, as
evidence against him, controlled substances seized from him at the time of his seizure on February
16, 2008, statements made to the police after his arrest on or about the same date, and certain items
of evidence taken from his bedroom pursuant to a search of his mother’s house also on February 16,
2008.
I.

BACKGROUND

Officers of the Metropolitan Police Department state that they conducted a traffic stop of Mr.
Adams in the 700 block of Fourth Street, NW, on February 16, 2008.1 The police allege that Mr.
Adams made an illegal turn from the middle laane of H Street, NW. The police further allege that
upon approach the automobile that Mr. Adams was driving, they smelled the odor of burned
marijuana. Mr. Adams was asked whether he had any controlled substances on him and allegedly
stated that he had “weed” in his pants. He was ordered out of the car, searched and the marijuana
recovered. The police then conducted a further patdown after allegedly witnessing Mr. Adams adjust
his crotch area as if concealing something. Observing a bulge, and then feeling a “hard object”, the

All fact allegations are based upon discovery and information and belief as to the
government’s case in chief.

police searched further and recovered a quantity of cocaine base from his crotch area.2 Also seized
from his person was a scale; recovered from the trunk of the car, which did not belong to Mr. Adams,
was a bag containing a cooking pot, a coffee pot, a strainer, and a thermometer. Additionally, Mr.
Adams made a written and videotaped statement after his arrest. A search of his bedroom at his
house pursuant to a consent form signed by his mother produced other items of evidence.
II.

THE EVIDENCE MUST BE SUPPRESSED
Mr. Adams was stopped because of a traffic violation. There is no indication of Mr.

Adams engaging in any drug trafficking or other illegal activity prior to the traffic stop. The
questioning about the marijuana and the subsequent patdowns and searches stemmed from the claim
that the officers smelled burned marijuana. However there was no marijuana found anywhere in the
automobile. There was no marijuana residue found in the car, nor any roach clips or the like that
might be associated with the smoking of marijuana.3 In short, there was no articulable suspicion
concerning criminal activity that warranted the patdowns and the search.
The determination of whether there is probable cause to arrest someone requires a “practical,
commonsense” inquiry. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983); United States v. Warren, 310
U.S. App. D.C. 1, 42 F.3d 647 (D.C. Cir. 1995).

“The touchstone of the Amendment is

reasonableness.” United States v. Douglas Proctor, No. 05-3132, slip op. (D.C. Cir. June 19, 2007);
See United States v. Askew, 482 F.3d 532, 538 D.C. Cir 2007) (Rehearing en banc granted,
judgment vacated, July 12, 2007). Where, as here, the seizure is based upon the supposed odor of
marijuana where nothing remotely associated with marijuana is found, the seizure is flawed, and the

The base ultimately weighed approximately 121 grams.

evidence must be suppressed.
Similarly, the seizure here cannot be justified as a Terry stop. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1
(1968). The police seized Mr. Adams and forced him to exit his automobile without any evidence
that he possessed or had used drugs. In this light, there was not probable cause for the seizure of
Mr. Adams, and the tangible evidence seized from his person must be suppressed. Additionally,
the statements and the evidence seized from his home must be suppressed as the products of an
illegal arrest. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963).
Additionally, the search of Mr. Adams’ room at is mother’s home was not only without
probable cause because of the illegal arrest, it was also not effected pursuant to legal consent. Mr.
Adams’ room at home was kept locked. It was a place where he had an expectation of privacy and
which could be entered only with a warrant. Although her home, his mother had no ability to
consent to a search of his locked room.
For the foregoing reasons, and any others that may appear to the Court, Mr. Adams and
counsel ask that the instant motion be granted.

Respectfully submitted,
