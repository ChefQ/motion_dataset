NOTICE
Section 1924, Title 28, U.S. Code (effective September 1, 1948) provides:
‚ÄúSec. 1924. Verification of bill of costs.‚Äù
‚ÄúBefore any bill of costs is taxed, the party claiming any item of cost or disbursement shall attach thereto an affidavit,
made by himself or by his duly authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the facts, that such item is correct and
has been necessarily incurred in the case and that the services for which fees have been charged were actually and
necessarily performed.‚Äù
See also Section 1920 of Title 28, which reads in part as follows:
‚ÄúA bill of costs shall be filed in the case and, upon allowance, included in the judgment or decree.‚Äù
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain the following provisions:
Rule 54 (d)
‚ÄúExcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall
be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs, but costs against the United States, its
officers, and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on one
day‚Äôs notice. On motion served within 5 days thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.‚Äù
Rule 6(e)
‚ÄúWhenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period
after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, 3 days shall be
added to the prescribed period.‚Äù
Rule 58 (In Part)
‚ÄúEntry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs.‚Äù
