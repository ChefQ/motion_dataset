UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
PALM BEACH DIVISION
Case No. 9:12cv80898-Ryskamp/Hopkins
ADT LLC,
Plaintiff,
v.
ALARM PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY
FLORIDA, LLC, et al.,
Defendants.
___________________________________/
ADT’S OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OF COSTS
ADT opposes defendants’ motion for entry of a judgment for costs. [DE 532.]
As shown below, the Court should defer a ruling on the motion until ADT’s appeals have
been decided. Moreover, the bill does not meet the statutory verification requirement.
See 28 U.S.C. § 1924. Finally, the bill must in any event be reduced by $23,561.40 for
the amounts claimed for Gunster Yoakley’s in-house printing and copying charges. In
opposition, ADT states:
BACKGROUND
In this case, ADT argued that defendants’ use of the APT mark in unannounced
door-to-door sales calls at customers’ homes, combined with a pitch that they were
visiting to “upgrade” the customers’ existing ADT alarm systems, created a likelihood of
confusion at the customers’ doorsteps that was barred by Section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). Despite ADT’s several efforts, [e.g., DE 413; DE 501 at
78-80] the Court refused to recognize this “initial interest” confusion as a Lanham Act

Case 9:12-cv-80898-KLR Document 537 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/10/2015 Page 2 of 8

violation if the defendants disclosed their lack of ADT affiliation at the time of sale. The
Court rested its conclusion on the absence of an Eleventh Circuit decision recognizing
that initial interest confusion is actionable under Section 43(a). [DE 478 at 2, citing
Suntree Technologies, Inc. v. EcoSense Int’l, Inc., 693 F. 3d 1338, 1347 (11th Cir.
2012).] Every other circuit court of appeals that has considered the question has
concluded that initial interest confusion violates the Act. [DE 501 at 79-80.] The Court
refused to instruct the jury on initial interest confusion. While the Court’s verdict form
attempted indirectly to poll the jury on the question, its language was unclear, and the
instructions gave the jury no guidance in answering it.
ADT has appealed the judgment. [DE 530.] ADT’s appeal will ask the Eleventh
Circuit to address this question of first impression in the Circuit.
ARGUMENT
“In the exercise of sound discretion, trial courts are accorded great latitude in
ascertaining taxable costs.” Loughan v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 749 F.2d 1519,
1526 (11th Cir. 1985). “In exercising its discretion to tax costs, absent explicit statutory
authorization, federal courts are limited to those costs specifically enumerated in 28
U.S.C. § 1920.” Financial Business Equipment Solutions, Inc. v. Quality Data Systems,
Inc., No. 08-cv-60769, 2009 WL 1423931, *2 (S.D. Fla. May 18, 2009), following
Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 445 (1987). “Upon objection
of certain charges,” it becomes the moving party’s “burden to undertake the line by line
analysis to support the taxable costs” as allowable under Section 1920. McDaniel v.
Bradshaw, No. 10-cv-81082, 2011 WL 6372788, *3 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 20, 2011); accord,
e.g., Parrot, Inc. v. Nicestuff Distributing Int’l, Inc., No. 06-cv-61231, 2010 WL 680948,

*15 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 24, 2010), citing Duckworth v. Whisenant, 97 F.3d 1393, 1399 (11th
Cir. 1996).
I.

The Court Should Exercise Its Discretion And Defer Ruling
On The Bill Of Costs Pending A Decision On ADT’s Appeal.
As this Court has recognized, ADT’s appeal will present a controlling issue of

first impression in the Eleventh Circuit. Should the Eleventh Circuit affirm the Court,
and decline to recognize initial interest confusion as a violation of Section 43(a) of the
Act, its affirmance will create a split with contrary decisions of the Federal, Second,
Third, Fifth (pre- and post-division), Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits –
no Circuit Court has ever adopted this Court’s position – and will likely lead to a
certiorari petition in the Supreme Court. As Judge King recently wrote:
Certainly, a trial judge has the discretion of staying consideration of
Motions for Fees and Costs and entry of a judgment thereon in those
instances where the appellate issue is based upon a split of decisions
between Circuits, a case of first impression or should be stayed
pending an imminent appellate decision on a similar legal issue.
Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. v. Crum & Forster Specialty Ins. Co., No. 10-cv-24590,
2012 WL 3291986, *3 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 13, 2012) (emphasis in original).
In this case, two of Judge King’s three reasons for deferring a ruling on costs are
present. ADT’s appeal presents an issue of first impression in the Circuit. If the Court’s
ruling is affirmed, the affirmation, as noted above, will create a split among the Circuits.
Given the uncertain outcome of the appellate questions presented, the Court should await
the conclusion of appeals before awarding costs in this case. ADT is filing concurrently
with this opposition a companion motion for stay pending appeals.

II.

The Bill Must Be Denied Because It Is Not Verified.
Moreover, the bill must be denied in its entirety because it does not comply with

the statutory verification requirement. See 28 U.S.C. § 1924. Section 1924 requires:
Before any bill of costs is taxed, the party claiming any item of cost
or disbursement shall attach thereto an affidavit, made by himself or
by his duly authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the
facts, that such item is correct and has been necessarily incurred in
the case and that the services for which fees have been charged were
actually and necessarily performed.
28 U.S.C. § 1924. Defendants have offered no affidavit to attest to the costs listed in the
bill – that the costs were necessarily incurred in the case, that the bill accurately reflects
the costs, and that the defendants have in fact paid the costs as invoiced. Because the bill
fails this basic statutory requirement, it must be rejected on this ground alone.
III.

The Court Should Disallow Undifferentiated Copying
Charges Allegedly Incurred By Defendants’ Law Firm.
Finally, the Court should disallow the $23,561.40 of the bill attributed to in-house

copying charges by the Gunster Yoakley law firm. As shown above, it is the defense’s
burden to prove its entitlement to reimbursement of copying charges. Defendants state
that they paid outside vendors $8,819.08 to copy trial exhibits and other materials
underlying defendants’ Rule 1006 summaries for trial. ADT would not have objected to
these vendor charges, had they been verified as necessarily incurred and paid. ADT does
object, however, to defendants’ request for over $23,000 in undifferentiated in-house
Gunster Yoakley printing and copying costs incurred over the two-year course of the
litigation for several reasons, each dispositive.
First: As shown in the previous section, defendants have offered no proof that
they have been billed for these charges, let alone paid them. Defendants offer only an

	  

4	  

Case 9:12-cv-80898-KLR Document 537 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/10/2015 Page 5 of 8

unverified 180-page log of all the prints and copies of all documents that Gunster
Yoakley ever made over the course of the litigation, with no detail to establish the nature
or purpose of any given charge. [DE 532-1 at 55-236.] This fails the defendants’ burden.
“As the prevailing party alone knows the purpose of the copies, it cannot simply make
unsubstantiated claims” for reimbursement. Monelus v. Tocodrian, Inc., 609 F. Supp. 2d
1328, 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2009). There is no proof here that the defendants are required to
pay Gunster Yoakley for any of these prints or copies. Nor is there any proof that the
defendants in fact paid for them. Absent such evidence, the defendants fail their burden
of proof, and their bill must be rejected.
Second: Defendants have not carried their burden of proving that any of these
charges were for copies “necessarily obtained for use in the case.” 28 U.S.C. § 1920(4).
The log [DE 532-1 at 55-236] nowhere attempts to correlate alleged charges with
documents that were required for use in the case, as opposed to the nonrecoverable costs
of prints made “for the convenience of a party, for the purposes of investigation, or
simply to aid a party in a more thorough preparation of the case.” George R. Hall, Inc. v.
Superior Trucking Co., 532 F. Supp. 985, 994 (N.D. Ga. 1982). Defendants’ bill already
accounts for the typically-allowed copying charges (e.g., trial exhibits) in its separate
request for reimbursement of the $8,819.08 defendants paid to outside copying services.
The Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly held that “costs such as general copying” are “clearly
nonrecoverable.” Duckworth v. Whisenant, 97 F.3d 1393, 1399 (11th Cir. 1996). Accord,
e.g., Watson v. Lake County, 492 Fed. Appx. 991, 998 (11th Cir. 2012) (vacating award
of costs for copying unsupported by evidence of how particular charges fell within the
statutory language); Gary Brown & Assocs., Inc. v. Ashdon, Inc., 268 Fed. Appx. 837,

	  

5	  

Case 9:12-cv-80898-KLR Document 537 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/10/2015 Page 6 of 8

845-46 (11th Cir. 2008) (affirming trial court denial of copying charges because they
were “not stated with requisite specificity”).
This lack of specificity in the Gunster Yoakley charges for printing and copying
requires denial of this category of costs. “The party seeking costs must not only show
that the costs claimed are recoverable, but must also provide sufficient detail and
sufficient documentation regarding those costs in order to permit challenges by opposing
counsel and meaningful review by the Court.” Doria v. Class Action Services, LLC, 261
F.R.D. 678, 685 (S.D. Fla. 2009). “Where the movant has failed to itemize copies
necessarily obtained for use in the case and those that were made for their own
convenience, an award of costs may be denied.” Tiara Condominium Ass’n, Inc. v.
Marsh USA, Inc., 697 F. Supp. 2d 1349, 1372 (S.D. Fla. 2010). Absent specificity
showing entitlement to payment under Section 1920(4), the Court must deny this portion
of the bill.
Third: The Gunster Yoakley printing and copying costs should not be taxed
because these are elements of the firm’s overhead, and law firm overhead expenses are
not proper subjects of a bill of costs. See Association for Disabled Americans, Inc. v.
Integra Resort Mgmt., Inc., 385 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1303-04 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (law firm’s
ordinary copying charges “should not be recoverable because they are overhead” of the
firm); accord Doria, 261 F.R.D. at 686. Defendants acknowledge that the 180-page
Gunster Yoakley print log lists not only copies made in the case, but also the costs of
printing original documents from their word processors, because the firm’s cost tracking
system combines the two categories. [DE 532-1 at 10 n.6.] Defendants try to justify this
conflation by including these printing costs as an allowable item under 28 U.S.C.

	  

6	  

Case 9:12-cv-80898-KLR Document 537 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/10/2015 Page 7 of 8

§ 1920(3), which provides “printing” as an element of costs. [DE 532-1 at 9.] But
Section 1920(3) is referring to the costs of outside printing services, as for typeset briefs,
see, e.g., Corsair Asset Mgmt, Inc. v. Moskovitz, 142 F.R.D. 347, 352 (N.D. Ga. 1992),
not a law firm’s in-house word processing costs of printing original documents for
copying, filing or service. See id.; accord, e.g., Jones v. Siegelman, No. 00cv1703, 2002
WL 1162406, *2 (M.D. Ala. May 24, 2002); El–Fadl v. Central Bank of Jordan, 163
F.R.D. 389, 390 (D.D.C. 1995) (“the costs of a word processor, printer and paper are part
of the overhead of any modern law office”; disallowing costs of printing original
documents because the “recovery for word processing charges under the guise of printing
charges is disallowed as outside the scope of § 1920”).
As the Court may itself observe from a review of the Gunster Yoakley print log
[DE 532-1 at 55-236], the defendants have billed indiscriminately for all of Gunster
Yoakley’s printing and copying charges that the firm ever allocated to this matter for over
two years. The log does not record which charges are for prints of original documents,
(which are not reimbursable) and which are copies. Nor does the log record which
charges were for copies necessarily made for the litigation, and which were not. The
billing records make it clear that Gunster Yoakley is attempting to shift its overhead to
the bill of costs, without any effort to meet the requirements of Section 1920.
As shown in Part I above, the Court should exercise its discretion and defer
consideration of the bill of costs pending appeal. As shown in Part II, the bill must be
disallowed in its entirety under 28 U.S.C. § 1924 because it is unverified. Finally, the
Court must in any event disallow the portion of defendants’ bill attributable to Gunster

Case 9:12-cv-80898-KLR Document 537 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/10/2015 Page 8 of 8

Yoakley’s in-house printing and copying charges because the bill does not establish
defendants’ entitlement to recovery of these costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1920.
CONCLUSION
The motion should be denied.
