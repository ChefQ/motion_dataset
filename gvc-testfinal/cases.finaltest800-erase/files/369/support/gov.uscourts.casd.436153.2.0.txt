INTRODUCTION

22
23

Ares Armor is under immediate threat of having their customers personal

24
25
26

information and its legal goods being seized by the ATF. Agents from the San
Diego ATF office are scheduled to arrive Wednesday March 12th, 2014 at 11:00

27

a.m. to demand Ares Armor hand over its customer list and turn over roughly

$300,000 in inventory of EP Armory polymer 80% lower receiver. Said meeting

2

was set upon the CEO of Ares Armor, Dimitrios Karris, learning that if it did not
3
4
5

agree to the BATFE’s terms that all of the Ares Armor facilities would be raided
and criminal charges would be brought against the Ares Armor staff. If it does not

6
7

comply ATF agents plan to simply seize the private information of thousands of

8

law abiding Americans along with roughly $300,000 in legal inventory. As shown

9

in the various parts of this motion and its accompanying filings, the BATFE is
10
11
12

intentionally misinterpreting Federal law in an attempt to coerce Ares Armor to
hand over the private information of thousands of law abiding Americans.

13
14

Immediate judicial intervention is desperately needed to preserve the civil rights of

15

both Ares Armor and its customers.

16

This Motion is being drafted in great haste due to the urgency of this matter.
17
18
19

This matter was brought to the attention of undersigned counsel the evening prior
to this filing and any discrepancies in analysis will be cured in a preliminary

20
21

injunction as soon as possible.

22

STATEMENT OF FACTS

23

Ares Armor is a business that primarily deals in gun parts, holsters, cases,
24
25
26

apparel, and backpacks and something called an “80% lower”. These are blocks of
metal or plastic that is shaped into the rough form of a lower receiver. These

27
28

receivers are 80% completed and you can use a drill press at home to finish the

remaining 20% and build your own gun. Ares Armor has been coerced by BATFE

2

agents to turn over their customer details as detailed in the accompanying
3
4

declarations.

The Temporary Restraining Order Should Issue
The factors to be weighed in considering whether to grant a temporary

9

restraining order and a preliminary injunction are the same. See Ohio Republican
10
11
12

Party v. Brunner, 543 F.3d 357, 361 (6th Cir. 2008). The proper legal standard for
relief requires a party to demonstrate "that he is likely to succeed on the merits that

13
14

he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the

15

balance of equities is in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”

16

Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 55 U.S. 7, 19, 129 S.Ct. 365, 374, 172
17
18
19

L.Ed.2d 249 (2008).
In Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 2011)

20
21

the Ninth Circuit held if requirements (2) and (4) are satisfied, and the balance of

22

hardships “tips sharply in the plaintiffs’ favor,” the plaintiff need only raise

23

“serious questions going to the merits” to be entitled to injunctive relief. Id. at
24
25
26

1134-35 (holding that this aspect of the Ninth Circuit’s sliding scale test survived
Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008)). As shown

27
28

below irreparable harm is likely because the plaintiffs have made out a colorable
ARES ARMOR PI - 3

Case 3:14-cv-00548-JLS-BGS Document 2 Filed 03/11/14 Page 4 of 9

claim that their constitutional rights have been threatened. See Sanders County

2

Republican Cent. Committee v. Bullock, 698 F.3d 741, 744 (9th Cir. 2012)
3
4
5

(holding that colorable claim of constitutional violation satisfies irreparable harm
element). For the same reasons, an injunction would be in the public interest.

6
7

Accordingly this merits section of should be evaluated under Cortell’s lessor

8

standard of review. However, even if evaluated by the Winters standard, Ares

9

Armor is entitled to injunctive relief.
10

Ares Armor Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits

11
12

a. The ATF’s Attempts to Coerce

13
14
15
16

Conversely, if, under all the circumstances, it has appeared that the consent
was not given voluntarily -- that it was coerced by threats or force, or
granted only in submission to a claim of lawful authority -- then we have
found the consent invalid and the search unreasonable…
Where there is coercion, there cannot be consent.

17

19

The ATF’s Planned Seizure Violates The Fourth Amendment

20
21
22

"[T]he basic purpose of th[e Fourth] Amendment, as recognized in countless
decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals

23

against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials." Camara v. Mun. Court, 387
24
25
26

U.S. 523, 528 (1967). Here , the privacy and security of Ares Armor and
thousands of its customers will be violated if this Court does not grant injunctive

27
28

relief because the ATF’s conduct is willfully violative of constitutional safeguards.

1

The ATF Mischaracterizes “EP 80% Lower Receivers” as Firearms As a

2

Pretense to Seize Customer Information
3
4

Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968, 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44 allows for an

5
6
7
8

individual to make a firearm for personal use. Ares Armor currently possesses but
no longer distribute a type of 80% lower receiver called “EP 80%”. Ares Armor
stopped distributing the EP Armory product after it was informed the BATFE was

9
10

mischaracterizing them as firearms. Ares Armor is not a licensed firearms dealer so

11

it is illegal for them to sell firearms. However the only difference between this

12
13
14

product and other 80% lower receivers is that a part called the trigger pocket is
colored black. ATF agents subsequently contacted Ares Armor and demanded

15

private customer information of all persons who purchased “EP 80%” lowers. In
16
17

the declarations attached to this filing the full chain of event are spelled out.

18
19
20
21

This appears to be a thinly veiled ruse to gather the personal information of
Ares Armor’s customers via coercing Ares Armor through threat of criminal
penalties and seizure of inventory. Rather than comply to governmental pressure

22
23

Ares Armor sues on behalf of itself and its customers.

24
25
26

Ares Armor Has Standing to Sue On Behalf of Itself And Its Customers
The Court has permitted persons who would be subject to future prosecution

27
28

or future legal action to represent the rights of third parties with whom the
ARES ARMOR PI - 5

Case 3:14-cv-00548-JLS-BGS Document 2 Filed 03/11/14 Page 6 of 9

1

challenged law has interfered with a relationship. Here, Ares Armor clearly has

2

standing as they face imminent seizure of inventory and customer files. As such
3
4

they have standing to protect the privacy rights of their clients as well.

5
6
7
8

See Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 -189 (1973) (doctors have standing to
challenge abortion statute since it operates directly against them and they should
not have to await criminal prosecution in order to determine their validity);

9
10

Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 62 (1976) (same); Craig v. Boren,

11

429 U.S. 190, 192 -197 (1976) (licensed beer distributor could contest sex

12
13
14

discriminatory alcohol laws because it operated on him, he suffered injury in fact,
and was ''obvious claimant'' to raise issue); Carey v. Population Services Intl., 431

15

U.S. 678, 682 -684 (1977) (vendor of contraceptives had standing to bring action
16
17

to challenge law limiting distribution).

18
19
20
21

There can be no dispute that Ares Armor’s customers have a reasonable
expectation of privacy as to their purchases made in the sanctity of their home.
Accordingly, the BATFE’s attempt to coerce Ares Armor imputes the Fourth

22
23
24

Amendment rights of its customers as well. As shown, Ares Armor is likely to
succeed on the merits.

In the Absence of a Preliminary
3

Injunction Ares Arms will Suffer Irreparable Harm

4
5
6
7
8

Ares Armor will suffer irreparable harm if not granted an injunction. Unless
immediate relief is granted on Wednesday a team of federal agents will arrive at

9

Ares Armor’s doorstep expecting its owners to handover it’s customer list in
10
11
12

exchange for a reprieve from further government harassment. After their The
United States Supreme Court has long held that “the loss of … freedoms, for even

13
14

minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury”. Elrod v.

15

Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976). Indeed, when liberties are infringed, irreparable

16

injury is presumed. 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice &
17
18
19

Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995) (“When an alleged deprivation of a
constitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of

20
21

irreparable injury is necessary.”).

22

The Balance of Equities Mandates Relief

23

This matter is analogous to Klein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d 1196
24
25
26

(9th Cir. 2009). In Klein the plaintiffs challenged a prohibition of their
fundamental right to free speech. Klein, 584 F.3d 1196. The Court ruled that

27
28

since the state action affected “anyone seeking to express their views in this
ARES ARMOR PI - 7

Case 3:14-cv-00548-JLS-BGS Document 2 Filed 03/11/14 Page 8 of 9

1

manner in the City of San Clemente[,] the balance of equities and the public

2

interest thus tip sharply in favor of enjoining the ordinance.” Id. at 1208.
3
4
5

It Serves the Public Interest to Grant Relief.

6
7
8

The Ninth Circuit has stated “all citizens have a stake in upholding the
Constitution” and have “concerns [that] are implicated when a constitutional right

9

has been violated.” Preminger v. Principi, 422 F.3d 815, 826 (9th Cir. 2005). A
10
11
12

injunction maintaining the status quo while this matter is litigated would advance
the shared interest of all citizens in enforcing the Constitution’s guarantees and

13
14

reinforce this “Nation’s basic commitment to foster the dignity and well-being of

15

all persons within its borders.” Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 264-65 (1970).

16

As a practical matter the private information of thousands of U.S. citizens is about
17
18

to be illegally seized by Federal agents under color of authority.

III. CONCLUSION
3
4
5

Here in America our Article III Courts are the guardians of ordered
liberty. Without immediate relief Ares Armor and the private information of

6
7

thousands of law abiding citizens will be illegally seized by Federal agents. Any

8

and all defects will be cured. For the time being please issue an order enjoining the

9

BATFE from seizing Ares Armor’s customer list and inventory.
