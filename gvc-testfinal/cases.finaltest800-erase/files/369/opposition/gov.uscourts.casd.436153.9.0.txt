FACTUAL BACKGROUND

22

The United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives

23 (ATF) is conducting a lawful criminal investigation of the illegal manufacture,
24 distribution, sale, and possession of AK-15 variant lower receivers, which are
25 considered firearms under the Firearms Control Act, 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3).
26

An AR-15 is the semi-automatic, civilian version of the .223 caliber M-16

27 machine gun used by the United States Military. The receiver is the only part of the
28 weapon that is considered a firearm; therefore, it is the part of the weapon that must

Case 3:14-cv-00548-JLS-BGS Document 9 Filed 03/17/14 Page 2 of 7

1 bear a manufacturer’s mark and a serial number. (All other parts of the AR-15 are
2 considered parts, not firearms.)

But the lower receivers at issue in ATF’s

3 investigation do not bear either a manufacturer’s mark or serial number.
4

Dealing in firearms without a license is illegal under 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1)(A).

5 Dealers of firearms are required to conduct a background check prior to transfer under
6 18 U.S.C. § 922(t)(1). And, because these firearms were manufactured for sale, they
7 are required to have a manufacturer’s marking and a serial number.

18 U.S.C.

8 § 923(i). Otherwise, there is no way to track them if they are involved in a crime.
9

Plaintiff Lycurgan Inc, dba Ares Armor (“Ares Armor”) is part of ATF’s

10 investigation because it is in possession of approximately 6,000 of these unserialized
11 AR-15 lower receivers. Further, Ares Armor is not a federal firearms licensee, so it
12 cannot legally engage in the business of dealing in these firearms, let alone ones that
13 do not bear the required manufacturer’s mark and serial number.
14

On March 10, 2014, ATF Division Counsel Paul Ware contacted an attorney

15 representing Ares Armor about the AR-15 lower receivers and requested that Ares
16 Armor agree to voluntary surrender them to ATF. See Declaration of Paul Ware.
17 This request was in lieu of obtaining a search and seizure warrant for these items
18 pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41. Id. Ares Armor’s attorney agreed that it would turn
19 over the firearms on March 12, 2014. Id. This agreement was confirmed at 5:00 p.m.
20 on March 11, 2014. Id.
21

But, while using one attorney to lull ATF into believing that it would voluntary

22 surrender the firearms, Ares Armor was, through another attorney, simultaneously
23 preparing a lawsuit and applying for a temporary restraining order preventing ATF
24 from taking possession of this contraband. Indeed, Ares Armor’s CEO freely admits
25 to this ruse. See Declaration of Dimitrios Karras (ECF #1-2 at 2, par. 9(b) (“I agreed
26 to their terms in order to delay an impending and unjust raid against Ares Armor long
27 enough to obtain legal protection under the law.”). When an ATF agent appeared to

2 was informed about the Temporary Restraining Order issued by the Court on March
3 11, 2014.
On March 14, 2014, this Court issued and order (1) extending the injunction to

9 Skomal, and executed by ATF agents on March 15, 2014.

ARGUMENT

12

A. Legal Standard for Issuing a Temporary Restraining Order
An injunction is Aa drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be

13

14 granted as a matter of course.@ Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 130 S. Ct.
15 2743, 2761 (2010). Plaintiff has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence
16 that injunctive relief is appropriate. See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Teamsters, 415
17 U.S. 423, 442B43 (1974). Because they are extraordinary remedies, a plaintiff seeking
1/
18 a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction Amust establish (1) that he is
19 likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the

20 absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4)
21 that an injunction is in the public interest.@ Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008);
22 see also Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (Aa party seeking a preliminary
23 injunction must demonstrate, among other things, a likelihood of success on the
24 merits.@) (internal quotations and citations omitted)); Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S.

The standard for a temporary restraining order is the same as for a preliminary
injunction.

27 (9th Cir. 2001);

1 968, 971, 976 (1997) (overturning a preliminary injunction issued when a plaintiff had
2 established only a >fair chance of success on the merits= of his claim).
3

The Ninth Circuit recognizes the Winter test. Am. Trucking Ass=ns v. City

4 of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009). However, the Ninth Circuit has
5 articulated an alternate version of this test whereby A>serious questions going to the
6 merits= and a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support
7 issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a
8 likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.@
9 Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011).
10

Under this approach, the first prong, Aserious questions going to the merits@

11 requires more than showing that Asuccess is more likely than not@; it requires a
12 plaintiff to demonstrate a Asubstantial case for relief on the merits.@ Leiva-Perez v.
13 Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir. 2011). And even where success on the merits is
14 likely or Aserious questions@ are raised an injunction Ais not a remedy which issues as
15 of course.@ Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311 (1982).
The standards for enjoining a criminal prosecution are even higher. Under the
16
17 Supreme Court’s decision in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 45 (1971), only when
18 the moving party demonstrates equitable relief is “absolutely necessary for [the]
19 protection of constitutional rights,” and only “under extraordinary circumstances,
20 where the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate,” may a court civilly
21 enjoin a criminal prosecution. See also Henkel v. Bradshaw, 483 F.2d 1386, 1388
22 (9th Cir. 1973) (same); Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 120 (1951) (“the maxim
23 that equity will not enjoin a criminal prosecution summarizes centuries of weighty
24 experience in Anglo-American law.”).
25

B. Plaintiff is Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits

26

Plaintiff cannot satisfy any of the four elements of the Winter test.

Case 3:14-cv-00548-JLS-BGS Document 9 Filed 03/17/14 Page 5 of 7

1

Plaintiff’s complaint alleges two claims for relief: (1) a violation of the Fourth

2 Amendment predicated on 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and (2) an undefined reasonable
3 expectation of privacy for its customers. See Complaint (ECF #1) at 8-9. Neither of
4 these grounds prohibits ATF from conducting a lawful investigation into illegal
5 trafficking of AR-15 lower receivers.
6

First, the first claim for relief does not state a claim against ATF – a federal

7 agency -- under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because that statute applies only to individuals
8 acting under color of state law. See Billings v. United States, 57 F.3d 797, 801 (9th
9 Cir. 1995) (“Because § 1983 provides no cause of action against federal agents acting
10 under color of federal law, . . . we conclude that the district court properly dismissed
11 [plaintiff’s] § 1983 claims.”) (internal citation omitted).
12

Second, on the merits, the Fourth Amendment prohibits only warrantless

13 searches for which no exception to the warrant requirement applies. See generally
14 United States v. Cotterman, 709 F.3d 952, 959-60 (9th Cir. 2013). But the issuance of
15 a legal warrant eliminates any arguable Fourth Amendment objection to ATF taking
16 possession of the AR-15 lower receivers. See, e.g., Marks v. Clarke, 102 F.3d 1012,
17 1030 (9th Cir. 1996) (obtaining a particularized search warrant satisfies the Fourth
18 Amendment).
19

Plaintiff withdrew its consent to voluntarily turn over the lower receivers in its

20 possession to ATF. And that was its right. But it has no Fourth Amendment right to
21 resist the execution of a lawfully issued search and seizure warrant.
22

Third, the specific items that ATF agents may seize pursuant to any search

23 warrant is the province of the magistrate judge who will issue the warrant and
24 determine its proper scope. But Plaintiff can establish no probability that a United
25 States Magistrate Judge will issue a warrant in violation of law. To the contrary, the
26 Court must presume the opposite. See, e.g., United States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, 716

1 (9th Cir. 2004) (there is “a presumption that an affidavit in support of a search warrant
2 is valid.”).
3

In sum, Plaintiff has no probability of succeeding on the merits of its attempt to

4 enjoin a lawful criminal investigation, or establishing that the ATF will conduct this
5 investigation in violation of its (or anyone else’s) Fourth Amendment rights. Plaintiff
6 therefore cannot satisfy the first prong of the Winter test.
7

9

C. Plaintiff Has an Adequate Remedy at Law; It Cannot Establish Irreparable
Harm
Plaintiff also cannot establish that it will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction

10 does not issue. Plaintiff has an available remedy if it believes that ATF has seized its
11 property in violation of law. Specifically, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g)
12 provides:
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

Motion to Return Property. A person aggrieved by an unlawful
search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may
move for the property's return. The motion must be filed in the district
where the property was seized. The court must receive evidence on any
factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If it grants the motion, the
court must return the property to the movant, but may impose reasonable
conditions to protect access to the property and its use in later
proceedings.
In light of Rule 41(g), Plaintiff cannot establish any possibility of irreparable

20 harm if an injunction does not issue prohibiting ATF from using lawful processes to
21 seize evidence and contraband relevant to its investigation.
22

D. The Balance of Equities Do Not Tip in Plaintiff’s Favor

23

Plaintiff cannot establish that the balance of equities tip in its favor. There are

24 no equities that favor enjoining a lawful, good faith criminal investigation into the
25 illegal trafficking of firearms.

E. The Public Interest Weighs Strongly Against Enjoining ATF’s Investigation

2

For the same reasons that Plaintiff cannot establish that the equities tip in its

3 favor, Plaintiff also cannot establish that the public interest is served by enjoining
4 ATF’s investigation.

To the contrary, the public interest is served by ATF’s

5 enforcement of federal law regulating firearms, which, in this case is aimed to prevent
6 approximately 6,000 AR-15 rifles that bear no serial numbers (and therefore are
7 untraceable) from reaching the streets.
8

In sum, Plaintiff cannot meet any of the four elements of the Winter test, and

9 certainly cannot meet the heightened standard for enjoining a lawful criminal
10 investigation.
11

III

12

CONCLUSION

13

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s request for a

14 temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction.
