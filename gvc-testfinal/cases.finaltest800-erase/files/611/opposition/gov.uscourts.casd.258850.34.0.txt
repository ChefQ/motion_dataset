I. INTRODUCTION

Defendants Sprint Solutions, Inc. and Sprint Spectrum, L.P. ("Defendants" or "Sprint")
assert that Plaintiffs failed to follow the Court's directive in its April 25, 2008 ruling to amend the
Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") and "connect facts with specific provisions of the FCA."
However, there is a fundamental difference between a fact and a legal argument. Contrary to

Defendants' assertion that "plaintiffs added only argument and more confusion, not facts

justifying a statutory cause of action," the SAC explains in paragraphs 74-80 how the numerous
facts detailed in the SAC connect to the relevant law and why Defendants are subject to the
provisions of the Federal Communications Act ("FCA") under those circumstances. Simply put,
Sprint charged taxes, fees, and surcharges that are solely related to telecommunications services
and appears to have improperly acted as a common carrier in doing so. Such charges are unjust
and unreasonable as they are assessed on services other than for telecommunications service or, in
the case of unretrievable text messages, for no services at all. It is not, as Sprint suggests,
because information services are exempt from such charges - although at least in the context of
taxes, they are. Sprint has violated the FCA because the charges in question do not apply to such
services and cannot be imposed on such services.

As Plaintiffs have complied with the directive of the Court to submit a more definite
statement connecting the facts to the relevant law, this motion to dismiss must be denied.

II. LEGAL STANDARD APPLIABLE TO THIS MOTION

As detailed in the accompanying Opposition to the Motion to Strike, Rule 12 motions are
disfavored and subject to a high degree of scrutiny by the courts. "Rule 12(b)(6) must be read in
conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires a `short and plain statement of the claim showing that
the pleader is entitled to relief." [Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); 5A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R.
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 0x00A7 1356]." Ticketmaster L.L.C. v. RMG Techs., Inc.,
536 F.Supp.2d 1191, 1194 (C.D. Cal. 2008). The Court must accept as true all material
allegations in the SAC as well as all reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, and must read
the SAC in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Pareto v. F.D.I-C., 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir.
1998).

A Rule 12 motion can only be granted if there is either a "lack of a cognizable legal
theory" or "the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory." Balistreri v.
Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). Courts are particularly hesitant to
dismiss claims at the pleadings stage if such claims could be better examined following the
development of facts during discovery. McGary v. City of Portland, 386 F.3d 1259, 1279 (g

Cir. 2004). While Sprint asserts the SAC is not sufficiently detailed to explain how Sprint's

conduct violates the FCA, its couple of pages of argument fail to cite any authority that establish
liability cannot be found under the FCA as a matter of law under the facts as plead. While the
"[flactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level", a
complaint "does not need detailed factual allegations." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 8. Ct.
1955, 1964-65, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). As long as the facts detailed in the SAC as a whole
assert a cognizable legal theory under which Sprint may be found liable under the FCA, the
motion to dismiss must be denied.

Ill. SPRINT'S CONDUCT REQUIRES APPLICATION OF THE FCA

The SAC alleges the following facts. Sprint operates primarily as a common carrier
(SAC, 475). When Sprint provides wireless broadband Internet access to its customers by
providing them a data services card, it does not distinguish between those services and the
commercial mobile radio services (i.e., wireless cellular telephone service) it also provides (SAC,
177). Sprint allows both phone and text messages to be sent to the wireless phone number
associated with the data services card, despite a customer's inability to receive such messages
because a data services card provides no such function (SAC, 28, 29). For example, Sprint
denied Plaintiff Taylor's request to block text messages on his account despite Sprint's ability to
block the receipt of text messages. Sprint also refused Plaintiff Taylor's request to place a note
on his account that he should not be charged for any text messages because the wireless phone
number on his account is not associated with a wireless phone, and he does not have nor did he
request text messaging service. Instead, Sprint required him to expend time and resources calling
customer service each time he received an improper text message and complain to the customer
service representative, who would only remove a text message if the representative believed
Plaintiff did not have a wireless phone on his account (SAC, 29).

To further add to customers' confusion, Sprint uses a uniform bill that includes all
notifications and announcements concerning Sprint's commercial mobile radio services (SAC,
{77). For example, Plaintiff Taylor's bill includes a "Total Minutes Used" section, which
continuously states "You have not used any minutes this bill period." (SAC, Exhibit 1 at 1.)

Plaintiff Taylor does not have a wireless phone account in which minutes may be used. Even the

description of Plaintiff Taylor's Data Plan includes a reference to wireless phone capabilities,
stating: "Voice Capabilities Will Incur A Charge Of $.20 Per Minute" (SAC, Ex. 1 at 4). Sprint
also uses the same customer service representatives and phone numbers to handle customer
inquiries and complaints for wireless broadband Internet access and commercial mobile radio
services (SAC, Ex. 1 at 1), and the same Terms and Conditions apply to both services (SAC,
77).

Based on these facts, the reasonable consumer is lead to believe by Sprint's conduct that
there is no distinction within Sprint between providing wireless broadband Internet access and
commercial mobile radio services and that Sprint is choosing to offer such services as a
telecommunication service, thereby subjecting Sprint to the provisions of Title Il the FCA. See
FCC Declaratory Ruling in Matter of Appropriate Regulatory Treatment for Broadband Access
to the Internet Over Wireless Networks, 22 FCC Red. 5901, 5913-14 (May 23, 2007). Yet when
facing a nationwide class claim challenging fees improperly imposed and potential violation of a
federal cause of action, Sprint reverses course and claims it makes such a distinction, arguing it
should be allowed to capitalize on its misleading actions when the taxes, fees, and surcharges
associated only with telecommunications services are improperly assessed on customers who only
access information services. In what capacity Sprint is offering such services is a disputed fact
and issue for summary adjudication or trial - not this motion. It is also a separate factual
question whether Sprint is effectively offering such services as a telecommunications service and
whether the charges in question are legal under the circumstances.

The SAC alleges how Defendants have taken every action to treat wireless broadband
Internet access as if they are offering a telecommunications service even though it is not, and how
Sprint is treating wireless broadband Internet access customers in the same manner as commercial
mobile radio services customers. Yet Sprint is charging wireless broadband Internet access
customers for using text messaging services, even though it is a service not contracted for or
accessible by wireless broadband Internet access customers. Sprint is also illegally assessing
taxes, fees, and surcharges associated with telecommunications services to wireless broadband

Internet access subscribers. If Sprint insists on acting as a common carrier while offering

wireless broadband Internet access, Sprint should specify what telecommunications services
trigger such charges and should be held to the rules that govern such conduct.
IV. THE SAC EXPLAINS WITH FACTS WHY THESE CHARGES ARE UNJUST

AND UNREASONABLE

Defendants assert that plaintiffs concede the taxes, fees, and surcharges assessed are "just
and reasonable". However, the justness and reasonableness of such charges assumes such
charges are properly assessed in the first place - which, as alleged in the SAC, they are not.

Contrary to Defendants' assertion, the services at issue are exempt from certain taxes. For
example, Congress has explicitly placed a moratorium on the taxing of Internet access under the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, which was enacted as a note to section 151 of the FCA. See 47 U.S.C.
151-Note. Title XII, Section 1201 of that Act provides "It is the sense of Congress that no new
Federal taxes similar to the taxes described in section 1101(a) should be enacted with respect to
the Internet and Internet access during the moratorium provided in such section." See Ex. 1
attached hereto.' Wireless broadband Internet access provided by Sprint provides a method for
accessing the Internet and is therefore exempt from these types of taxes. As a result, it is per se
illegal to impose taxes on the data card services at issue.

Sprint seems to be of the belief that they could assess taxes, fees, and surcharges for
telecommunications services on any service or product they provide. However, the law does not
allow for such conduct. Assessing taxes, fees, and surcharges for telecommunications services
when a customer has not contracted for such service is per se unreasonable. The notion raised by
Defendants that the charges at issue here are "just and reasonable" as a matter of law would be
akin to a department store asserting it could assess sales tax to its employee's income because it
has both employees and merchandise. While a common carrier may charge just and reasonable
rates for telecommunications services, it is axiomatic that Defendants must first provide such
services to its data plan customers. Here, the customers did not contract for telecommunications

services, and it is unjust and unreasonable for Sprint to charge such customers for taxes, fees, and

 

1 This moratorium has been extended until 2014. See 47 U.S.C. Section 151 Note, Section
1101 (a). ;

surcharges for telecommunications services that they did not contract for and were not in fact
provided by Defendants, and which are illegal to impose.

To apply Defendants' analogy, if they sold lemonade to their customers by charging a
monthly fee, assigned a phone number to the glass, charged the customer for text messages sent
to phone number assigned to the glass, and charged them taxes, fees, and surcharges associated
with telecommunications services, Defendants would claim such conduct is not governed by the
FCA. It is absurd that Defendants believe they are entitled to assess charges for
telecommunications services and claim the protections afforded a common carrier for doing so, as
they do in their Motion, but then are unwilling to accept the responsibilities associated with
conducting themselves in that capacity. Unless Sprint is willing to concede these charges were
not properly imposed on the class because they were on information service accounts (as they did
with other similar charges, see SAC 931), this claim must be permitted to proceed.

V. THE FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION STATES A CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF

MAY BE GRANTED

Plaintiffs assert numerous facts within the SAC, as detailed above, to establish the
necessary elements for a claim to recover damages under the FCA. First, Plaintiffs assert that
Defendants are assessing charges that are only proper in connection with providing a wire or
radio communication service. Second, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants are acting as common
carriers, as established through their conduct as alleged throughout the SAC. Third, Plaintiffs
assert that the data plan service customers have not contracted for or receive telecommunications
services, but rather have only contracted with Defendants to provide information services, and as
a consequence may not be assessed charges in connection with telecommunications services.
Fourth, they allege it is unlawful under the FCA to assess taxes for such services when it is not
permitted under the law. Taken together, these combined facts are connected to the law sufficient
to assert a cause of action under the FCA.

Under 47 U.S.C. 0x00A7206, if a common carrier such as Sprint:

shail do, or cause or permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this chapter

prohibited or declared to be unlawful ..., such common carrier shall be liable to

the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in

consequences of any such violation of the provisions of this chapter, together with

a reasonable counsel or attorney's fee, to be fixed by the court in every case of

recover, which attorney's fee shall be taxed and collected as part of the costs in the

case.
Therefore, if Sprint imposes unjust and unreasonable charges because such charges cannot be
legally imposed and does so while purportedly acting as a common carrier, Sprint is liable to its
customers injured as a result thereof. Plaintiffs have properly stated a cognizable legal theory
upon which relief can be granted under the FCA.
VI. CONCLUSION

Based on the above, Sprint's motion to dismiss the Fifth Cause of Action must be denied.
