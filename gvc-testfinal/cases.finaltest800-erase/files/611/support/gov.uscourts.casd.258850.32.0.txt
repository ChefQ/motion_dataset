TO PLAINTIFFS UTILITY CONSUMERS' ACTION NETWORK
AND ERIC TAYLOR AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Defendants Sprint Solutions, Inc. and Sprint
Spectrum L.P. (collectively "Sprint") will and hereby do move this Court for an order
dismissing the Fifth Cause of Action in Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). This motion has been noted for hearing on
Friday, June 27, 2008 at 9:30 a.m., or as soon thereafter as this matter may be heard by the
Honorable Robert J. Bryan, Visiting Judge to the United States District Court, located at
940 Front Street, San Diego, California, 92101. However, unless otherwise ordered by the

Court, no oral argument will be held on this motion.

This motion is made on the grounds that the Fifth Cause of Action in the

Second Amended Complaint fails to state a cause of action under 47 U.S.C. 0x00A7 201(b).

This motion is based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum

of Points and Authorities in support thereof, the pleadings and papers on file herein, and

upon such other matters as may be presented to the Court at the time of the hearing or of

which the Court may take judicial notice.
