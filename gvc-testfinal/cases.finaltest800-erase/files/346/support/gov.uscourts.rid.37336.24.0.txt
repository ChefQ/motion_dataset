POLICY REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF A LICENSE OR
PERMIT TO CARRY A CONCEALED PISTOL OR REVOLVER PURSUANT TO
| RHODE ISLAND GENERAL LAWS, 11-47-11. |

INTRODUCTION

The Town of Bristol is authorized by Rhode Island General Law 11-47-11 to issue a license or
permit to carry a concealed pistol or revolver to a person twenty-one (21} years of age or over
having a bona fide residence or place of business in Bristol, or a person twenty-one (21) years
of age or over having a bona fide residence within the United States who has already been
issued a concealed weapon permit by another state or subdivision of the United States. The
concealed weapon license may be issued only if the Town determines that the applicant has
good reason to fear an injury to his or her person or property or has any other proper reason
for carrying a pistol or revolver, and that he or she is a suitable person to be so licensed.

Pursuant to Rhode Island General Law 11-47-18, an eligible person may make application with
the Attorney General for a license or permit to carry a pistol or revolver.

Pursuant to Rhode Island General Law 11-47-15, the applicant must also qualify to obtain a
permit. The right to carry a loaded, concealed firearm In public is different from the right to
purchase or possess a handgun in one's own home or business. The privilege to carry a
concealed firearm is limited to those who demonstrate a need for, and an understanding and

acceptance of, this responsibility.

Rhode tsland General Law 11-47-13 provides for the revocation of any such license or permit
_ for just cause at any time by the granting authority.

The Town of Bristol wilt exercise its discretion in a manner designed to protect the public at

 

~ large as well as the individual applicant for a pisto! permit.

- The Town of Bristol does not discriminate in the issuance of a pistol permit on grounds of race,
sex, national origin, or any other reason prohibited by law.

Procedure

An applicant for a pistol permit must submit a completed application to the Bristol Police
Department, 395 Metacom Ave. Bristol, Rhode Island. A Fee of $100.00 (non-refundable),
payable by check or money order to the Town of Bristol shal! be assessed for processing fees
and to allow the department to electronically file the fingerprints through the local, state, and -
federal law enforcement database systems. The Bristol Police department will complete the
required background that may include a check of court records and other sources for pending
criminal cases, restraining orders and/or discrepancies in the applicant's background, including

prior history or mental illness.

The Town of Bristol will not issue a pistol permit to any applicant who is prohibited from -
possessing or carrying a firearm under any State or Federal Law (e.g 18 U.S. 922(g}) or pursuant -

to any court order.

If this initial check does not disqualify the applicant from obtaining a pistol permit, the Town of
Bristol shall review the application on an individual basis to determine whether there has been
proper showing of need, as required by the statute, and whether the applicant is qualified.

Proper Showing of Need

In considering each individual application for a pistol permit, the Town of Bristol must
determine whether or not the applicant has demonstrated a proper showing of need to carry a
loaded firearm in public, and consider the individuai's demonstration of skill and responsibility
to safely carry and use a firearm in compliance with all State, Federal and local laws. Because a
loaded, concealed firearm in untrained hands presents danger to the public and the applicant,
the Town of Bristo! must consider countervailing risks to the publicin assessing need.

While there cannot be any set formula or criteria to limit or restrict the Town of Bristol's
discretion to issue or deny a concealed weapon license, the Town will afford a hearing to each
~~ applicant before ruling on the application. The Town of Bristol considers the following factors

in assessing an applicant's proper showing of need.

1.. Has the applicant demonstrated a specific articulable risk to life, limb or property? If
so, has the applicant demonstrated how a pistol permit will decrease the risk?

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 24 Filed 02/12/16 Page 6 of 15 PagelD #:.344

| 2, Can the applicant readily alter his or her conduct, or undertake reasonable
| measures other than carrying a firearm, to decrease the danger to life, limb or
| property?

! 3. Are there means of protection available to the applicant other than the possession
_ Of firearm that will alleviate the risk to his or her person or property?

; 4. Has the applicant demonstrated the skill, training and ability to properly use a
. firearm in accordance with Rhode Island laws?

5. Has the applicant presented a plan to properly secure the firearm so that it does not
fall into unauthorized hands?

6. How greatiy will the possession of a firearm by the applicant increase the risk of
harm to the applicant or to the public?

7. Has the applicant demonstrated that he or she will not use the firearm for an
unlawful or improper purpose, and that he or she has not used a firearm for n
unlawful or improper purpose in the past?

8. Does past unlawful, dangeraus or violent conduct of the applicant justify denial of
the license by the Town even if it is not sufficient to disqualify the applicant as a
matter of law from possessing a firearm?

9, Hasa protective order been issued relative to the applicant pursuant to chapter 15-
5, chapter 15-15, or chapter 8-8.1 of the general laws?

10. Are there other factors deemed lawful and appropriate by the Town to demonstrate
that the applicant is or is not a person suitable to possess a firearm in public.

 

After assessing the above factors, the Town shail grant or deny the concealed weapon permit,
and in the case of a denial, shall state its reasons therefore in writing, In certain cases, the
i Town may issue a concealed weapon permit with restrictions in lieu of a denial.

In addition to these reasons, the Town will give consideration to those persons who seek
| renewal of existing permits who have demonstrated through their actions and experience a
_ level of responsibility commensurate with that expected of one who is privileged to. carry a
