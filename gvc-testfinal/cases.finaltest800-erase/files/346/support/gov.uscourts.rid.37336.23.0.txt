DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT, AND IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I.

INTRODUCTION
This case stems from the denial of Plaintiff Jarren Gendreau’s (“Gendreau”) concealed

carry weapon permit (“the Permit”) application (“the Application”) by the Chief of Police, Josue
D. Canario (“Chief Canario”), for the Town of Bristol, Rhode Island (“the Town”). As discussed
more fully below, because no dispute of material fact exists, this Court should grant summary
judgment in favor of Defendants pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
II. FACTS AND TRAVEL
A. History and Background of the Rhode Island Firearms Act
In 1927, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed the Firearms Act. P.L. 1927, ch. 1052.
The current version of the Firearms Act is a comprehensive regulatory scheme governing the sale,
possession, and use of various weapons, along with criminal penalties for violation. R.I. Gen. Laws
§ 11-47-1 to -63. Among these provisions are two sections governing the licensure of concealed
pistols and revolvers. R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11, 18. The first provides that municipal
governments “shall issue” a license to their residents upon meeting several criteria, and the second

-1-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 2 of 18 PageID #: 285

provides that the state Attorney General “may issue” a license upon meeting certain, somewhat
different, criteria. Id. The former, which is applicable in the case at bar, reads in pertinent part:
The licensing authorities of any city or town shall . . . issue a license or permit to
the [applicant] to carry concealed upon his or her person a pistol or revolver
everywhere within this state . . . if it appears that the applicant has good reason to
fear an injury to his or her person or property or has any other proper reason for
carrying a pistol or revolver, and that he or she is a suitable person to be so licensed.
R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11.
Pursuant to § 11-47-11, if the applicant is deemed “suitable,” there are two paths to
demonstrating eligibility for a concealed weapon permit: the applicant must demonstrate that they
have either (1) “good reason to fear an injury to his or her person or property,” or (2) that they
have “any other proper reason” to be so licensed. R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11(a). The General
Assembly tied the “reason” requirement to obtain a permit to an individual’s fear of injury to their
person or property, which is a high standard to meet. Id. The Rhode Island Firearms Act affords
the local licensing authorities broad discretion to determine if an applicant for a permit is
“suitable,” and if the applicant has a “proper reason” to carry a concealed firearm. See R.I. Gen.
Laws § 11-47-11.
B. Gendreau’s Application and Procedural Posture
Gendreau applied for the Permit on or about February 23, 2012. Gendreau’s Permit
application is attached hereto and herein incorporated as Exhibit A. In his application, Gendreau
set forth three reasons why he claimed he “has good reason to fear an injury to his or her person
or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a pistol or revolver.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 1147-11. Gendreau asserted that: (1) he is an “avid firearms collector with over $4,000.00 invested
in both firearms and firearms accessories;” (2) he “occasionally deposit[s] large sums of money
for [his] father, who owns an apartment complex and a curtain store located in Fall River” and

-2-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 3 of 18 PageID #: 286

with whom he “occasionally travel[s] . . . during business tractions;” and (3) he is “actively seeking
employment in the security field.” Ex. A. at 7.
On May 1, 2012, a panel appointed by Chief Canario conducted an interview with
Gendreau in accordance with the Town’s regulations. A transcript of the interview is attached
hereto and herein incorporated as Exhibit B. The panel recommended that Chief Canario deny
Gendreau’s Application. In its recommendation, the panel suggested that the request be reviewed
again if Gendreau obtained a letter from his employer indicating that he needed a Permit for his
position. See Memorandum from Patrolman John Nappi to Chief Canario dated May 3, 2012,
attached hereto and herein incorporated as Exhibit C at 1, 2. It should be noted that the panel
recommended approving two of the three applications reviewed by the panel on the day of
Gendreau’s interview. Id. After considering the panel’s recommendation, on June 26, 2012, Chief
Canario notified Gendreau in writing that his Application was denied. See Decision letter from
Chief Canario to Jarren R. Gendreau dated June 26, 2012, attached hereto and herein incorporated
as Exhibit D.
Following the denial, Gendreau filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Rhode Island
Supreme Court on February 25, 2013. The Court granted Gendreau’s petition on September 18,
2013. The Court determined that the letter Chief Canario sent to Gendreau did not adequately
describe the reasons for denial of the Application. The Court ordered Chief Canario to clarify his
reasoning and provide Gendreau a new decision articulating the factual basis for the denial. See
Order of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, dated September 18, 2013, attached hereto and herein
incorporated as Exhibit E. The Rhode Island Supreme Court further stated that it “shall retain
jurisdiction of this mater,” and gave explicit instructions to Gendreau should he still be aggrieved
by Chief Canario’s amended decision: “[Gendreau], if aggrieved by [Chief Canario’s amended]

-3-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 4 of 18 PageID #: 287

decision, may invoke the Court’s jurisdiction by filing an amended writ of certiorari in this same
docket within thirty (30) days of the issuance of [Chief Canario’s] decision.” Ex. E at 2.
On October 16, 2013, Chief Canario issued an amended decision, which is attached hereto
and herein incorporated as Exhibit F. Gendreau did not file an amended petition for certiorari by
November 15, 2013 as ordered by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. In fact, more than two years
later, Gendreau has still not amended his petition. According to the Gendreau v. Canario docket
sheet, attached hereto and herein incorporated as Exhibit G, Gendreau’s case has since been
closed. More than eight months after abandoning his first appeal, Gendreau filed this action
claiming federal and state constitutional issues previously raised before the Rhode Island Supreme
Court.
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure reads in pertinent part as follows: “The
court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any
material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
“[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and
determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986). “[T]his standard mirrors the standard
for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), which is that the trial judge
must direct a verdict if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to
the verdict.” Id. at 250-51 (citations omitted). Where the parties do not genuinely dispute the
material facts but dispute only the law, as is the case here, summary judgment is appropriate. See
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).

IV. ARGUMENT
A. Jurisdiction
1. The Rhode Island Supreme Court has previously granted certiorari to
Gendreau on the matters raised in Counts II and III, has stated it shall “retain
jurisdiction in this matter,” and was the proper forum for these matters to be
decided.
The issues raised in Counts II and III of the complaint are state matters that Gendreau has
already brought before the Rhode Island Supreme Court, which stated: “This Court shall retain
jurisdiction of this matter.” Ex. E at 2. As this Court would be attempting to apply the precedent
of the Rhode Island Supreme Court in its evaluation of these claims, and that court has stated
unambiguously that it intended to interpret the Firearms Act of its own accord, this Court should
permit the Rhode Island Supreme Court to do so. By abandoning his appeal at the Rhode Island
Supreme Court, Gendreau forfeited his right to judicial review. The Rhode Island Supreme Court
has been clear on the appeal process for denied applications under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11,
having stated: “unless a right of appeal is specifically provided by statute, the proper procedure for
denial by a town council of a license application is by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.”
Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 1048 (R.I. 2004).
Given the previous procedural history and the nature of the claims, this Court should
decline to extend supplemental jurisdiction over the Rhode Island-specific issues raised by Counts
II and III of the complaint. In Gadomski v. Tavares—the only other decision reported thus far
interpreting R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11—the Rhode Island Supreme Court articulated its standard
of review for this type of appeal as follows: “[I]t is well settled that “[o]ur review of a case on
certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been
committed.” 113 A.3d 387, 389 (R.I. 2015). This is a deferential standard identical to that
employed for appeals from other administrative agencies. See Town of Richmond v. Wawaloam
-5-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 6 of 18 PageID #: 289

Reservation, Inc., 850 A.2d 924, 933 (R.I. 2004). As such, deference should be given to findings
of fact that are supported by “substantial evidence” in the record. Lischio v. Zoning Bd. of Review
of Town of N. Kingstown, 818 A.2d 685, 690 n. 5 (R.I. 2003). Substantial evidence is “such
relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, and
means [an] amount more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” Id.
2. Gendreau’s claims are barred by res judicata.
In Rhode Island, res judicata attaches to the decisions of administrative agencies that act in
a quasi-judicial capacity. See Wawaloam Reservation, Inc., 850 A.2d at 933. Agencies act in a
“quasi-judicial” capacity when they provide the parties “substantially the same rights as those
available in a court of law, such as the opportunity to present evidence, to assert legal claims and
defenses, and to appeal from an adverse decision.” Id. In Huntley v. State, the Rhode Island
Supreme Court held that res judicata applied in a similar situation to the case at bar, although the
forums were reversed. 63 A.3d 526, 532 (R.I. 2013). In Huntley, the plaintiff had filed a pro se
complaint in this Court, alleging employment discrimination against the State of Rhode Island.
Before being legally permitted to file her lawsuit, she first needed a “right to sue” letter from the
Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights. Id. Some ten months after the case was dismissed,
when she received the right to sue letter and was represented by counsel, she re-filed her claim in
Providence Superior Court. Id. The Rhode Island Supreme Court held that “[t]he doctrine of res
judicata bars the relitigation of all issues that were tried or might have been tried in an earlier
action. In essence, the doctrine . . . serves as an absolute bar to a second cause of action where
there exists identity of parties, identity of issues, and finality of judgment in an earlier action.” Id.
The Rhode Island Supreme Court also held that “[t]he principle underlying the rule of res judicata
is that a party who once has had a chance to litigate a claim before an appropriate tribunal usually

-6-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 7 of 18 PageID #: 290

ought not to have another chance to do so. This principle serves the twin aims of both judicial
efficiency and finality.” Id. The Rhode Island Supreme Court also said that “[l]itigation is publicly
funded dispute resolution, and the public has a right to expect that the resources of the judicial
system not be wasted. The use of res judicata reflects confidence in the judicial system—one
opportunity to litigate a claim or an issue suffices to ensure each party of her day in court.” Id.
(quoting Richard D. Freer, Introduction to Civil Procedure § 11.1 at 512 (2006)). Accordingly, the
Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court’s dismissal.
As the Rhode Island Supreme Court treats appeals under the Firearms Act with the same
standard of review as any other administrative appeal, it would follow that res judicata would
similarly apply. See Gadomski, 113 A.3d at 389; Huntley, 63 A.3d at 532. Here, by abandoning
his appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Gendreau accepted Chief Canario’s decision as a
final decision on the merits. See Wawaloam Reservation, Inc., 850 A.2d at 933. Also, as Gendreau
had the opportunity to have his “day in court,” and since he had the “chance to litigate a claim
before an appropriate tribunal,” he “ought not to have another chance to do so.” See Huntley, 63
A.3d at 532. As such, the claims in Counts II and III should be dismissed. As res judicata applies
to all claims “that a party raised or could have raised in the previous proceeding,” Count I, which
stems from the same facts between the same parties, should also be dismissed. See Wawaloam
Reservation, Inc., 850 A.2d at 932.
B. Because the United States Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on concealed
carry as being presumptively constitutional, Gendreau’s Second Amendment
rights were not violated.
In District of Columbia v. Heller, the United States Supreme Court declared longstanding
prohibitions on gun ownership, including prohibitions on concealed carry, to be lawful. See 554
U.S. 570, 626 (2008). The Court stated as follows:

-7-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 8 of 18 PageID #: 291

“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is
not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases,
commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not
a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
whatsoever and for whatever purpose. For example, the majority of
the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that
prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the
Second Amendment or state analogues.” Id. (citations omitted).
Heller confirmed that the Second Amendment means that the government cannot prohibit the
ownership of certain types of guns for protection in one’s home. Id. at 635. This constitutional
right has been extended no further. See id. at 626-27.
Applying Heller, the First Circuit stated as follows: “[a]s examples of ‘longstanding’
restrictions that were ‘presumptively lawful’ under the Second Amendment, the Court listed: (1)
laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons . . . . These restrictions, as well as others
similarly rooted in history, were left intact by the Second Amendment and by Heller.” U.S. v. Rene
E., 583 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2009). Three years later, the First Circuit Court of Appeals explained
in Hightower v. City of Boston that “[w]e have interpreted this portion of Heller [supra] as stating
that laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons are an example of longstanding
restrictions that are presumptively lawful under the Second Amendment.” 693 F.3d 61, 73 (1st Cir.
2012). (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). Plaintiff’s brief does not cite to
a single First Circuit case post-Heller that interprets this passage. While, as Plaintiff points out,
some circuits have found a more expansive right, the First Circuit has not, and this Court is bound
by its precedent.
In fact, a majority of circuits to consider this issue have ruled similarly to the First Circuit
that this passage of Heller permits restrictions—or in some cases, outright bans—on concealed
carry. See, e.g., Drake v. Filko, 724 F.3d 426, 434 (3d Cir. 2013); Kachalsky v. Cty. of
Westchester, 701 F.3d 81, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2012); United States v. Masciandaro, 638 F.3d 458, 466
-8-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 9 of 18 PageID #: 292

(4th Cir. 2011); Peterson v. Martinez, 707 F.3d 1197, 1210-11 (10th Cir. 2013) (holding that “the
Second Amendment does not confer a right to carry concealed weapons.”); see also 79 Am. Jur.
2d Weapons and Firearms § 5.
Here, in paragraph 43 of his complaint, Gendreau claims that the Town and Chief Canario
are infringing on his right to bear arms insofar as requiring a “proper showing of need” violates
the Second Amendment. Gendreau’s argument ignores Supreme Court precedent stating that
restrictions on concealed carry are presumptively valid, as well as the First Circuit’s binding
precedent that further supports the legislature’s right to restrict concealed carry. See Heller, 554
U.S. at 626; Hightower, 693 F.3d at 73; Rene E., 583 F.3d at 12. The right to bear arms does not
exist in the absolute sense claimed by Gendreau; it may be the subject of restrictions including
specifically, those on concealed carry. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 626; Hightower, 693 F.3d at 73;
Rene E., 583 F.3d at 12. It is impossible to violate, abridge, or burden a right that does not exist,
and there simply is no right to unrestricted concealed carry under the Second Amendment. See
Heller, 554 U.S. at 626; Hightower, 693 F.3d at 73; Rene E., 583 F.3d at 12.
Moreover, Plaintiff claims that the Town and Chief Canario are attempting to claim “carte
blanche” authority in making determinations regarding concealed carry permits, when by his own
statements, that is clearly not the case. See Plaintiff’s Memorandum at 33. By creating and
implementing a policy governing the “proper reason” requirement, the Town has placed reasonable
limits on its own discretion. The statute requires an applicant to show a “proper reason” to obtain
a concealed carry license. R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11. With no definition included in the statutory
scheme and no guidance as to what qualifies as a “proper reason,” other than the preceding clause
anchoring the reason requirement to a risk of physical harm to person or property, it is the role of
the licensing authority to exercise its discretion to determine what reasons are proper. See id. Had

-9-

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 10 of 18 PageID #: 293

there been no policy in place, and no guidelines made available, it would be far more likely for an
arbitrary decision to be rendered. Here, the Town promulgated rules to provide for transparency
for issuing these permits. If the General Assembly did not intend for the licensing authorities to
determine what reasons were “proper,” they would have defined “proper reason[s]” in the statute.
See id. As restrictions on concealed carry are presumptively lawful, requiring a proper reason is
well within the plenary power of the Legislature, and by their enactment of § 11-47-11, delegated
to the local licensing authority. See id.; Heller, 554 U.S. at 626.
Plaintiff claims that firearms law is preempted by statute and is not within the scope of the
Town’s authority. Plaintiff’s Brief at 2. Plaintiff ignores, however, that the preemption statue
specifically states that “[t]he control of firearms, ammunition, or their component parts regarding
their ownership, possession, transportation, carrying, transfer, sale, purchase, purchase delay,
licensing, registration, and taxation shall rest solely with the state, except as otherwise provided
in this chapter.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-58 (emphasis added). Section 11-47-11 clearly gives
discretion to the local licensing authorities. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11; Gadomski, 113 A.3d
387, at 390; Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1048. This is precisely the type of situation that would fall under
the exception to the preemption rule in § 11-47-58. Section 11-47-11 would be in direct conflict
with § 11-47-58 if the preemption clause precluded the local licensing authorities from exercising
discretion.
C. This Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction as to Counts II and III of
the complaint and is able to reach them only via supplemental jurisdiction;
however, as Count I fails, this Court should decline to extend supplemental
jurisdiction to Counts II and III.
The jurisdiction of United States federal courts is not without limit. U.S. Const. art. III, §
2. Courts must have subject matter jurisdiction over an issue to hear a case. Id.; 28 U.S.C. §§ 12511630. In cases where there is a prayer for relief from a federal controversy in addition to a related
- 10 -

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 11 of 18 PageID #: 294

non-federal controversy over which the Court would otherwise not have subject matter
jurisdiction, the court may optionally exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the matter:
“[I]n any civil action of which the district courts have original
jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction
over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within
such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. . . .
The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction
over a claim under subsection (a) if . . . the claim raises a novel or
complex issue of State law, . . . [or] the district court has dismissed
all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367.
The First Circuit has further identified circumstances under which the district courts should decline
to extend supplemental jurisdiction:
“[A] federal court should consider and weigh in each case, and at
every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy,
convenience, fairness, and comity in order to decide whether to
exercise jurisdiction over a case brought in that court involving
pendent state-law claims. When the balance of these factors
indicates that a case properly belongs in state court, as when the
federal-law claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages
and only state-law claims remain, the federal court should decline
the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the case without
prejudice.” Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 264-65 (1st Cir. 1992).
1. Counts II and III raise novel issues of State law, and the Rhode Island
Supreme Court is the proper body to decide those issues.
The Rhode Island Supreme Court has not ruled definitively on what qualifies as a “proper
reason” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11. Gendreau’s claim otherwise relies solely on dicta in a
footnote in Gadomski that states the petitioner in that case “may” have shown a proper reason for
a Permit. 113 A.3d at 391 n.5. The Gadomski court’s ruling was essentially identical to the Rhode
Island Supreme Court’s order to Chief Canario after granting Gendreau’s petition for certiorari:
the applicant must be provided with the factual basis for the denial of the Permit. Compare Ex. E,
with Gadomski, 113 A.3d at 392. The Court did not squarely rule on whether Gadomski had

- 11 -

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 12 of 18 PageID #: 295

demonstrated a proper reason. Gadomski, 113 A.3d at 392. Chief Canario provided Gendreau with
the factual basis for denial on October 16, 2013. Ex. F. As Gendreau failed to file an amended
petition for certiorari by November 15, 2013, per the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s order, his
case was closed, and he forfeited his right to appeal.
The Rhode Island Supreme Court will now wait for a new, and proper, appeal to be filed
via petition for a writ of certiorari in order to interpret R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11. As the question
of law posed here has not yet been answered by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and Gendreau
seeks more than just the application of settled law, this Court should decline to extend
supplemental jurisdiction over Counts II and III of the complaint.
D. Defendants’ decision did not violate Article 22 of the Rhode Island Constitution
as there is no constitutional or statutory right to carry a concealed weapon in
Rhode Island.
In Mosby, the Rhode Island Supreme Court interpreted for the first time the meaning of
the “keep and bear arms” provision of the Rhode Island Constitution. R.I. Const. art I, § 22; Mosby,
851 A.2d at 1043. The Court reasoned:
“We discern no jurisprudential support in this state for the dissent's
conclusion that the term ‘bear arms’ extends beyond the military
context. . . . Although we conclude that the ‘bear arms’ language of
art. 1, sec. 22 is employed in the military context, we also recognize
an individual right flowing to the people to keep and bear arms.
However, . . . we are of the opinion that, when viewed in its entirety,
the [Firearms Act] serves to vindicate an individual's right to keep
and bear arms and that the licensing scheme set forth in the Firearms
Act is reasonable legislative regulation of weapons that falls
squarely within the state's police power.” Id.
As the Rhode Island Supreme Court has interpreted “bearing arms” to refer to the context of
military or militia service, there is no right to carry a concealed weapon in Rhode Island outside
of that context, which is not at issue in this case. See id. The Rhode Island Supreme Court has
upheld the right of the people to own firearms within their homes and places of business, and that
- 12 -

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 13 of 18 PageID #: 296

right has not been abridged here. Gendreau has not been prevented from owning a firearm, only
from carrying it concealed on his person in public. See id.
E. Defendants’ decision did not violate the Firearms Act because the General
Assembly gave the Town the ability to establish, within the confines of § 11-4711, the standards for licensure within its community.
The General Assembly, in enacting § 11-47-11, included a reason requirement for
licensure. R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11. The sole example provided as to what constitutes a “proper
reason” is whether an applicant “has good reason to fear an injury to his or her person or property.”
Id. Such a standard is intentionally difficult to meet, as the General Assembly clearly wanted to
limit the class of persons who could obtain a concealed carry permit. See id.
Gendreau offered several purported “proper reasons” why he should be licensed under §
11-47-11. Ex. A. at 7. Each of Gendreau’s reasons are independently flawed and are discussed
below.
1. Ownership of a valuable firearms collection is an entirely self-fulfilling
criteria, and should not be considered a “proper reason” under § 11-47-11.
Anyone legally able to purchase a firearm is similarly able to purchase multiple firearms.
Should a person elect to spend their money, there is no limit on how many firearms one may
“collect.” Should this Court permit the ownership of multiple firearms as a “proper reason,”
anyone who can afford to purchase multiple firearms will be able to, in effect, purchase a
concealed carry permit. There is no support for such a justification within the text or meaning of
the statute. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11. Furthermore, as a matter of public policy, individuals
with greater monetary assets should not be allowed to carry a concealed weapon for no reason
other than their ability to spend money on additional firearms. Nowhere in § 11-47-11 is there a
suggestion that being a “gun enthusiast” is a proper reason. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11.

- 13 -

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 14 of 18 PageID #: 297

Gendreau also stated that he regularly transports his firearms to a bona fide gun range in
Massachusetts on a weekly basis. Ex. A at 14. No action taken by the Town or Chief Canario
would prevent Gendreau from carrying otherwise lawfully owned firearms in his vehicle to a
shooting range, so long as those firearms are properly secured for transport. See R.I. Gen. Laws §
11-47-10.
2. Seeking a uniformed security position cannot be a proper reason for
concealed carry licensure under § 11-47-11, as the statute permits only
concealed carry, and does not permit open carry, as the permit available
under § 11-47-18 does.
If Gendreau were to be issued a permit under § 11-47-11, he would still be unable to legally
carry a firearm visible on his person in a security position. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11. Section
11-47-11 reads in pertinent part “[t]he licensing authorities of any city or town shall . . . issue a
license or permit to the person to carry concealed upon his or her person a pistol or revolver
everywhere within this state for four (4) years from date of issue.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11(a)
(emphasis added). Whereas, § 11-47-18, the Attorney General’s discretionary permit application
authority, provides that “[t]he attorney general may issue a license or permit to any person . . . to
carry a pistol or revolver, whether concealed or not, upon his or her person upon a proper showing
of need.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 (a) (emphasis added).
The General Assembly included open carry exclusively within the scope of the Attorney
General’s licensing statute. Compare R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11(a), with R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-4718(a). Gendreau is not able to claim an unpermitted use as a “proper reason” under § 11-47-11. If
Gendreau seeks the ability to openly carry a firearm for employment purposes, the only option is
to seek a permit from the Attorney General. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18(a). It is noteworthy
that during his interview, Gendreau focused on this issue as the primary reason he sought the

Permit, but conceded that he would need to apply for an open carry permit through the Attorney
General to obtain employment in Rhode Island. See Ex. B at 4.
Should Gendreau obtain employment in such a capacity where he would be required to
carry a concealed weapon and obtained a letter from his employer to that effect, Chief Canario
indicated that he would consider a new application from Gendreau at that time. Ex. C at 1, 2.
3. Occasionally carrying large sums of money is not a de facto “proper reason,”
and is subject to the discretion of the licensing authority in determining
whether the comparative risks posed to the applicant outweigh the risks to
public safety by permitting the concealed carry permit.
The only potentially proper reason Gendreau claimed for needing a permit under § 11-4711 is that he, on occasion, carries money in furtherance of his father’s business interests. Ex. A. at
14. However, in this instance a Rhode Island concealed carry permit does not mitigate this danger
because the potentially dangerous activities are not conducted within the State of Rhode Island.
Id. Gendreau’s father owns rental property and a curtain store in Fall River, Massachusetts, and
when his father is on vacation, Gendreau “occasionally” manages the business. Id.
While carrying large amounts of money could conceivably give an applicant a “reason to
fear an injury to his or her person or property,” the frequency with which large sums of money are
carried and the surrounding circumstances determine whether that constitutes a “good” reason. See
R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11(a). The General Assembly intended for the local licensing authority to
weigh the factors to determine the strength of the applicant’s reason. See id. A plain reading of the
statute affords the local licensing authority the discretion to determine the veracity of the
applicant’s claim. See id.
Here, Chief Canario evaluated Gendreau’s purported “good reason” to fear an injury to his
person or property, and concluded that because of the nature, location, and infrequency of the risk,

- 15 -

Case 1:14-cv-00337-M-LDA Document 23 Filed 02/05/16 Page 16 of 18 PageID #: 299

a concealed carry permit was not warranted in this situation. Such a determination is within the
sound discretion of the local licensing authority. See id.
Furthermore, as the danger enumerated by Gendreau is primarily outside the borders of the
State of Rhode Island—the only location the permit would allow him to carry a concealed
weapon—this reason is facially inadequate to support issuance of a concealed carry permit. See
id. The statute permits the bearer of a permit to carry “everywhere within this state” Id. (emphasis
added). Possessing a Rhode Island permit to carry a concealed weapon does not extend into
Massachusetts. Id.; see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, § 131F. If Gendreau were to carry a firearm in
his intended manner, he would be violating the concealed carry laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, § 10; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, § 131F.
4. If Gendreau has a lawful reason for carrying a concealed firearm in
Massachusetts, he must apply to the licensing body therein, and comply with
whatever regulations and restrictions Massachusetts places on such permits.
Gendreau has argued that his need for a concealed carry permit stems from desired uses
outside the State of Rhode Island, specifically, within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Ex.
B at 2-4. Gendreau claims that to obtain a similar permit in Massachusetts he must first obtain one
in Rhode Island. Ex. A at 14. Nowhere in § 11-47-11 is the Town or Chief Canario required—or
even authorized—to aid a citizen in obtaining a permit in a different state where they may
potentially have a proper reason for licensure, when no such reason exists in the area covered by
the permit. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11.
It appears that Gendreau’s actual grievance is with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, where he purports to need access to a concealed firearm. That, however, is a matter
for a different day and a different court. If Gendreau is aggrieved by the decision of the licensing
authority in Massachusetts, he should seek review of that decision in the appropriate venue.
