POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

Summary Judgment is Proper because the Undisputed Facts
Establish that, as a Matter of Law, Gilbert Qualified as an
Administrative Employee Exempt from Overtime Compensation.
Pursuant to Federal Rule 56, a party against whom a claim

is asserted may move for summary judgment in the party’s favor
as to all or any part thereof.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b).

Summary

judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers
to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law.

APC Properly Classified Gilbert’s Position as a Safety
Supervisor as an Administrative Employee Exempt from
Overtime Compensation Under the AWHA and FLSA.
Gilbert brings claims for overtime under both the AWHA and

FLSA.

Under the AWHA, a non-exempt employee is entitled to

overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty hours
per week or eight hours per day.

AS 23.10.060(b).

Here, Gilbert’s duties as a Safety Supervisor fit squarely within
the definition of administrative employee under both the AWHA and
the FLSA.
1.

Gilbert’s duties satisfy the AWHA definition
of an administrative employee.

The Alaska Administrative Code defines the administrative
employment exemption to require proof of six factors, specifying
that an “administrative employee” is a worker:
A) whose primary duty consists of work directly
related to management policies or supervising the
general business operations of the employer;
(B) who customarily and regularly exercises discretion
and independent judgment;
(C) who performs work only under general supervision;

FLSA or regulations adopted under it.

Page 16 of 35

AS 23.10.145. The federal

regulations define the phrase as follows:
(a) The phrase “directly related to management
policies or general business operations of his
employer or his employer’s customers” describes those
types of activities relating to the administrative
operations of a business as distinguished from
“production” or, in retail or service establishment,
“sales” work. In addition to describing the types of
activities, the phrase limits the exemption to persons
who perform work of substantial importance to the
management or operation of the business of his
employer or his employer’s customers.
* * *
(c) As used to describe work of substantial importance
to the management or operation of the business, the
phrase ‘directly related to management policies or
general business operations’ is not limited to persons
who participate in the formulation of management
policies or in the operation of the business as a
whole. Employees whose work is ‘directly related’ to
management policies or to general business operations
include those whose work affects policy or whose
responsibility it is to execute or carry it out. The
phrase includes a wide variety of persons who either
carry
out
major
assignments
in
conducting
the
operations of the business, or whose work affects
business operations to a substantial degree, even
though their assignments are tasks related to the
operation of a particular segment of the business.
* * *
(5) The test of ‘directly related to management
policies or general business operations’ is also met
by many persons employed as advisory specialists and
consultants of various kinds, credit managers, safety
directors, claim agents and adjusters, wage-rate
analysts. . . ., and many others.

Gilbert customarily and regularly exercised
discretion and independent judgment.

Prong (B) of the state test for an administrative employee
is one “who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and
independent judgment”. Again, none of the phrases contained in
the test is defined in the state statute or the regulations. The
phrase “discretion and independent judgment" is defined at 29
CFR 541.207(a) and provides, in part:
(a) In general, the exercise of discretion and
independent judgment involves the comparison and the
evaluation of possible courses of conduct and acting
or making a decision after the various possibilities
have been considered. The term as used in the
regulations in subpart A of this part, moreover,
implies that the person has the authority or power to
make an independent choice, free from immediate
direction or supervision and with respect to matters
of significance.
Further, the regulations expressly state that the exercise of
discretion

and

independent

judgment

necessarily imply that the decisions made by the
employee must have a finality that goes with unlimited
authority and a complete absence of review.
The
decisions made as a result of the exercise of
discretion and independent judgment may consist of
recommendations for action rather than the actual
taking of action.
The fact that an employee’s
decision may be subject to review and that upon
occasion the decisions are revised or reversed after
review does not mean that the employee is not
exercising discretion and independent judgment within
the meaning of the regulations in Subpart A of this
part. . . .
29 CFR 541.207(e) (emphasis added).

The federal regulations

also define “customarily and regularly”, terms not defined in
the state act:
The work of an exempt administrative employee must
require the exercise of discretion and independent
judgment customarily and regularly.
The phrase
“customarily and regularly” signifies a frequency
which must be greater than occasional but which, of
course, may be less than constant.
The requirement
will be met by the employee who normally and
recurrently is called upon to exercise and does
exercise discretion and independent judgment in the
day-to-day performance of his duties. The requirement
is not met by the occasional exercise of discretion
and independent judgment.
29 CFR § 541.207(g).
In Brock v. On Shore Quality Control Specialists, Inc.,
1987 WL 31398 (W.D. Tex. 1987), the court was considering the
interpretation of this part of the test. The Brock court held
that pipeline inspectors were administrative employees exempt
from the overtime requirements of the FLSA.

Plaintiff’s argument that the inspectors merely apply
the specifications set by the contract or by a certain
prescribed industry standards is not supported by the
evidence.
Although the inspectors did work pursuant
to specifications set by the contract, the evidence
showed that their powers included the ability to
deviate from those specifications when the situation
required.
The evidence indicated that on numerous
occasions, sometimes on a daily basis, the inspectors
deviated from prescribed standards.
There is no
question from a review of the evidence that the
inspectors
were
not
mechanically
applying
the
standards set by prescribed specifications.
Id. at 7. The court rejected the employees’ argument that they
simply applied the specifications of the code to guide them in
their judgments.

The court stated that although the code sets

out general guidelines for welding of pipes, the code requires
the exercise of a great deal of discretion in deciding whether

primarily performed work requiring the exercise of discretion
