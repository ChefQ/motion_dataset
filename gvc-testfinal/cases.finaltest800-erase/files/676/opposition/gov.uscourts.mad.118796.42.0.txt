DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF COURT ORDER
I.

INTRODUCTION
On November 14, 2008, Plaintiff Wen Y. Chiang (“Plaintiff”) filed this action attempting

to assert various claims against Defendants FIA Card Services, N.A. (“FIA”),1 and Bank of
America, N.A. (collectively “Defendants”), all of which were entirely premised on the propriety
of Defendants’ credit furnishing conduct in 2008 in connection with Plaintiff’s account ending in
1736 (the “1736 Account”). Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on December
15, 2008, asserting additional claims for Constitutional violations based on the same alleged
conduct and account. This Court dismissed all of Plaintiff’s claims on the pleadings, with the
exception of his Count IV brought under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), which
is the only remaining claim.
On September 11, 2009, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) without
leave of court. In paragraph 10 of the SAC, Plaintiff attempted to expand the scope of his claims
to include allegations with respect to a second account, ending in 9211 (the “9211 Account).
1 FIA was formerly known as MBNA America Bank, N.A. (and erroneously sued herein as

MBNA (A Bank of America Company).

Defendants therefore moved to strike Plaintiff’s SAC in its entirety or, in the alternative,
paragraph 10, by which Plaintiff attempted to expand the scope of the case to include the 9211
Account. On November 25, 2009, the Court granted Defendants motion in part, striking
paragraph 10 of Plaintiff’s SAC and noting that “references to account ending in 9211 appear for
the first time in the Second Amended Complaint, and that account was the subject of another
case, CA 06-12258-PBS.”
On April 7, 2010, the parties participated in a scheduling conference wherein the Court
confirmed that the only account at issue in this case is the 1736 Account.
Defendant now moves the Court to reconsider its order striking paragraph 10 of the SAC.
Defendant’s motion should be denied because, as the Court has already noted, the 9211 Account
is not at issue in this case and paragraph 10 was therefore properly stricken. Accordingly,
Defendants respectfully request the Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration.
II.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED
A district court has substantial discretion and broad authority to grant or deny a motion

for reconsideration. See Ruiz Rivera v. Pfizer Pharms., LLC, 521 F.3d 76, 82 (1st Cir. P.R.
2008), citing United States v. Parcel of Land, 896 F.2d 605, 611 (1st Cir. 1990). A court
appropriately may grant a motion for reconsideration "where the movant shows a manifest error
of law or newly discovered evidence." Id. (citing Kansky v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New
England, 492 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2007)); see also Brown v. United Air Lines, Inc., 656 F. Supp.
2d 244, 248 (D. Mass. 2009) (To prevail [on a motion for reconsideration] the moving party
must either present previously unavailable evidence or show that a manifest error of law was
committed.) Likewise, a motion for reconsideration should be granted if the court "has patently
misunderstood a party . . . or has made an error not of reasoning but apprehension." Id., see also
Elgin v. United States, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28623 (D. Mass. Mar. 11, 2010) (same). A
district court's decision to grant or deny a motion for reconsideration is reviewed under Rules
59(e) and 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for manifest abuse of discretion. See
Kansky v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New England, 492 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2007); DiMaio

Family Pizza & Luncheonette, Inc. v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 448 F.3d 460, 462 (1st Cir.
2006).
Furthermore, a court has broad authority to manage its own docket. See O'Connell v.
Hyatt Hotels of Puerto Rico, 357 F.3d 152, 155 (1st Cir. Puerto Rico 2004) ("In an era of
burgeoning case loads and thronged dockets, effective case management has become an essential
tool for handling civil litigation. Rule 16 provides the district courts with many of the devices
necessary to manage its docket.") (internal citations omitted); Otoki Group, Inc. v. Gibraltar,
P.R., Inc., 16 Fed. Appx. 3, (1st Cir. Puerto Rico 2001) ("A district court has inherent authority
to manage its docket. . . ."); U.S. v. Ottens, 74 F.3d 357, 359 (1st Cir. Mass. 1996), citing United
States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 291 (1st Cir. 1990) ("It is the province of the district court to
manage its docket.").
Here, Plaintiff filed this action nearly a year and half ago, and for the first twelve months
that this case was pending, Plaintiff made no attempts to include the 9211 Account in this action.
As this Court properly noted, the only account at issue in the Complaint and FAC was the 1736
Account. The 9211 Account was not referenced until Plaintiff filed his SAC, and the Court
rightfully struck paragraph 10 which attempted to expand the scope of the case to include the
9211 Account. In addition, as this Court has also noted, the 9211 Account was the subject of
another action by Plaintiff for alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.2
Moreover, this Court has broad authority to manage its docket, and at the April 7, 2010
status conference, the Court explained that it will exercise its authority to limit this case to the
1736 Account.3 Plaintiff has a lengthy history of filing frivolous and trivial lawsuits against the
2 The 9211 Account was at issue in a Fair Credit Reporting Act case that Plaintiff brought against Defendants that is
pending before Judge Saris (CA 06-12258-PBS). Plaintiff could have, but chose not to, seek leave of court to add
the claims he now asserts in the prior action. Furthermore, limiting this action to the 1736 Account does not
preclude Plaintiff from seeking relief on the 9211 Account in a separate action if there are in fact grounds to do so.
3 If this case is limited to the 1736 Account, as it should be, Defendants are prepared to voluntarily dismiss without
prejudice, or consent to the Court’s dismissal without prejudice, of its counterclaim for breach of contract of the
9211 Account.

defendants and, unless the Court establishes clear boundaries with respect to the scope of this
case, there will be no end to Plaintiff’s attempts to improperly add claims and unnecessarily
complicate this litigation.
Plaintiff does not, and simply cannot, allege any mistake of law or point to any newly
discovered evidence to warrant reconsideration of the Court’s order. The Court made it clear at
the April 7 status conference that this case is limited to the 1736 Account, and its order striking
paragraph 10 of the SAC is consistent with this directive. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration should be denied.
III.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated herein, Defendants request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion
for Reconsideration and specifically issue an order confirming that this action is limited to the
1736 account.
