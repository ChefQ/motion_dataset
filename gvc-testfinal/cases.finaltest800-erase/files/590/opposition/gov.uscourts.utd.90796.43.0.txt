INTRODUCTION
This case belongs in Utah, not New York. Aereo made a deliberate decision to launch its
infringing service in Utah, to steal the signals of television stations based in Salt Lake City and
St. George, and to offer that content over the Internet to subscribers located in Utah for a
monthly fee. The infringement at issue in this case is taking place exclusively in this district, not
in New York; it is harming local broadcasters in this district, not in New York; and the key
witnesses and evidence are in this district, not in New York. None of the plaintiffs in this case
are parties to the New York action, and none of the copyrights at issue in this case are at issue in
New York. Yet Aereo has moved this Court to force local Utah plaintiffs to litigate their claims
on the other side of the country. It is no secret that the primary reason Aereo wants to escape
this District for New York is to ensure that the court deciding this case will be bound by aberrant
Second Circuit precedent favorable to Aereo — precedent that numerous scholars and courts
agree is incorrect because it is based on an a clear misreading of the Copyright Act.1 Indeed, in

the past year alone two courts outside the Second Circuit have enjoined a service identical to
Aereo, rejecting the Second Circuit case law Aereo exclusively relies on.2
Aereo has not met its burden of establishing that the appropriate factors weigh in favor of
transferring this case to New York.3 To the contrary, they weigh heavily in favor of allowing the
plaintiffs to proceed in Utah, their chosen forum. Plaintiffs KSTU, KUTV, and KMYU all
maintain their offices in Utah and employ hundreds of Utahns. They have no connection to New
York. The witnesses who will testify to the irreparable harm caused by Aereo‘s infringement
also reside in Utah. And the retransmission device that — under Aereo‘s own theory of the case
— is a critical piece of evidence that would need to be inspected by the parties and their experts,
is physically located in Utah.
Aereo‘s arguments in favor of transfer have no merit. Although Aereo claims it is a
small start-up company that cannot afford to litigate in Utah, it is in fact backed and funded by
billionaire media mogul Barry Diller through his conglomerate IAC/Interactive Corp. (―IAC‖).4

billion dollars at their disposal.5 Moreover, Aereo is currently in the middle of a massive
expansion with the goal of being in 22 cities by the end of this year.6 Aereo knew from the
outset that its business model would lead to litigation and prepared for it. Just last week, Aereo‘s
CEO Chet Kanojia told the New York Business Journal that he was not concerned about legal
fees incurred battling broadcasters, stating that Aereo ―has sufficient money to pay our [legal]
bills. Our investors are prepared to create a new ecosystem.‖7
Aereo also insinuates that some of its executives who may testify in this case reside in
New York, but that is not the case. Of the four executives Aereo identifies, two live in
Massachusetts, one lives in Ohio, and one lives in California. And although Aereo claims that
this case should be transferred to New York because that is where a lawsuit against it by New
York broadcasters has been pending for a year and a half, this case cannot be consolidated with
the New York action without severely prejudicing the plaintiffs or substantially delaying the
New York litigation. Fact discovery is closed in the New York case, cross-summary judgment
motions have been fully briefed, and the trial is expected to take place in the first half of next
year.8 The facts relevant to this case (e.g., Plaintiffs‘ copyrighted content, Plaintiffs‘ harms, and
Aereo‘s Utah retransmission system) are not and have never been in issue in New York, meaning
the court there would have to reopen discovery and start from scratch. In fact, Aereo recently

asked a court in Boston to transfer the lawsuit brought by a Boston broadcaster against Aereo to
New York, and its motion was denied for exactly that reason.9
If Aereo is forced to litigate in multiple jurisdictions it has only itself to blame. Aereo
commits new acts of infringement against new copyright owners whenever it launches in a new
market because ―each act of infringement is a distinct harm giving rise to an independent claim
for relief.‖10 Plaintiffs seeking protection from Aereo‘s infringement have the right to choose
their forum. Aereo does not have the right to engage in infringement across the country and then
force all the plaintiffs it has harmed into Aereo‘s chosen forum. Although it always intended to
operate nationwide, Aereo limited its initial launch to New York to guarantee that the first
infringement case filed against it would be in the Second Circuit, so that it could take advantage
of that court‘s misreading of the Copyright Act.11 Aereo‘s gambit paid off: It has so far
managed to avoid the otherwise universal fate of companies that broadcast television
programming over the Internet without a license — a ruling that they are committing copyright
infringement and an order enjoining them from continuing. Having avoided a preliminary
injunction in New York, Aereo is now expanding across the country, attempting to hide behind
aberrant Second Circuit law to shield its geographically expanding infringement through the
vehicle of motions to transfer. This is not about concerns for efficiency — this is Aereo gaming
the system. Aereo‘s motion should be denied.

B.

Aereo And Its Billion-Dollar Backers.
6.

Aereo describes itself as a ―small start-up company,‖ and claims that it faces

―overwhelming litigation costs‖ if it is made to defend its infringement in this district.18
7.

In actuality, Aereo is backed by Barry Diller, through his media conglomerate

8.

IAC‘s family of websites is one of the largest in the world: It owns Ask.com,

IAC.19

About.com, Match.com, Ok Cupid, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast, Urbanspoon, and Vimeo,
among others.20 It has global reach: Its website touts that its network of sites has over one
billion monthly visits across more than 30 countries.21
9.

So far, Aereo has received over $68 million in financing from IAC and other

institutional investors.22
10.

Mr. Diller, the public face of Aereo, is reportedly worth around two billion

dollars, and also controls Expedia, Inc., which operates well-known websites such as
expedia.com, hotels.com, and hotwire.com, and as well as more than 150 other travel booking
sites in more than 70 countries.23

C.

Aereo’s Attempt To Immunize Its Infringement With Aberrant Second Circuit
Law.
11.

Aereo is a subscription service that allows subscribers to watch television over the

Internet.24 This lawsuit alleges that Aereo infringes the copyrights of local broadcast stations
and owners of some of the copyrighted content they broadcast by capturing local broadcast
signals and retransmitting them over the Internet to Aereo subscribers.25
12.

Plaintiffs allege that this is copyright infringement because retransmitting

broadcast television programs violates the copyright owners‘ exclusive right to under the
Copyright Act to perform their copyrighted works publicly.26
13.

Under a provision of the Copyright Act known as the ―Transmit Clause,‖ ―[t]o

perform . . . a work ‗publicly‘‖ is, among other things, to ―transmit or otherwise communicate a
performance or display of the work . . . to the public, by means of any device or process, whether
the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same
place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.‖27

―[D]evice‖ and

―process‖ are defined broadly to include any device or process ―now known or later
developed.‖28

14.

Aereo alleges that it is not publicly performing Plaintiffs‘ copyrighted programs

because the device or process it uses is not covered by the Transmit Clause.29 Aereo‘s defense is
based on case law from the Second Circuit, in which that court held that the public performance
right is limited to transmissions to the public made using only certain devices and processes.30 A
service that follows the Second Circuit‘s technological ―guideposts‖ is free, according to that
court, to transmit copyrighted audiovisual works like television programs and movies to the
public without obtaining authorization from, or compensating, the copyright owners.31
15.

Within the last year, two courts outside the Second Circuit have enjoined services

identical to Aereo‘s and, in so doing, both courts expressly held that the Second Circuit read the
statute incorrectly.32 Numerous scholars also agree that the Second Circuit misread the statute.33
16.

Aereo designed its retransmission device to fall within the loophole in the

Transmit Clause it perceived the Second Circuit to have invented.34 It then deliberately limited
its service to New York, guaranteeing that the initial lawsuit would be in Aereo‘s chosen
forum.35 As Judge Chin of the Second Circuit pointed out in a scathing dissent from the opinion
blessing Aereo‘s system, ―it is telling that Aereo declines to offer its subscribers channels

broadcast from New Jersey, even though its antennas are capable of receiving those signals, for
fear of being subject to suit outside the Second Circuit.‖36
17.

Aereo avoided a preliminary injunction in New York, because the district court

was constrained by prior Second Circuit precedent (the Cablevision case).37 In denying the
plaintiffs‘ motion, however, the district court made clear that it would have decided the case
differently had it not been bound by Cablevision.38 The Second Circuit affirmed that decision,
expressing its own misgivings about the result, but concluding that it was bound by Cablevision
as well.39

Once Aereo escaped an injunction in New York, it immediately began to expand

its operations. As part of that process, it put one of its retransmission devices in Utah.40 It is
currently retransmitting the signal of local broadcast stations throughout the state, like KSTU,
KUTV, and KMYU. Aereo‘s infringement in Utah is limited to Utah — Aereo admits that no
one outside of the state can receive its retransmissions of Utah stations‘ broadcasts. 41 Now that
Aereo has launched in Utah, it is the first time the local station plaintiffs had the need, or the
opportunity, to challenge Aereo‘s infringement.

D.

The Status Of The New York Action Against Aereo.
19.

None of the plaintiffs in this case are parties in the New York case, and none of

the copyrighted programs at issue here are at issue in the New York case.42
20.

In the year and a half since the New York case began, it has proceeded through

motions for a preliminary injunction, a two-day evidentiary hearing, and an appeal to the Second
Circuit. Cross-motions for summary judgment are fully briefed and have been pending since
July. Fact discovery closed on October 30, and trial is expected early next year.
21.

There has been substantial discovery in the New York case aimed at precisely

establishing the design and function of the transmission device at Aereo‘s New York facility,
including site inspections and expert testing, since a key issue in that case is whether that device
complies with the Second Circuit‘s guideposts.43
22.

Aereo‘s Utah facility has never been inspected in the New York case, and news

reports indicate that Aereo‘s various devices around the country do not operate identically.44
E.

Aereo’s Declaratory-Judgment Action Against CBS And Its Owned-And-Operated
Stations, None Of Whom Are Parties In This Case.
23.

In May of this year, in another transparent attempt to keep its legal fight from

proceeding in courts outside of the Second Circuit, Aereo filed a declaratory-judgment suit in the
Southern District of New York against CBS and its owned-and-operated stations nationwide,
seeking a declaration that Aereo is not violating their copyrights.45

24.

A fully briefed motion to dismiss has been pending in that case since July.46

25.

None of the plaintiffs in this case are parties to Aereo‘s declaratory-judgment

action.47 Although KUTV is a CBS affiliate, it is not owned and operated by CBS and is not a
party to the declaratory-judgment action in New York.48
26.

Contrary to Aereo‘s assertions, its declaratory-judgment case does not seek a

determination ―with respect to all of the broadcasters‘ rights nationwide‖ — rather, it seeks an
order declaring that Aereo‘s service does not infringe any of CBS‘s copyrights, and that it
otherwise complies with the Copyright Act.49
27.

No CBS copyrights are at issue in this case; KUTV has sued to enforce its own

rights in its local programming only.50 Aereo did not ask the New York court for any relief that
would affect the rights of the parties in this case.51
F.

Litigation Against Aereo And Its Clones Is Proceeding Around The Country.
28.

Currently, several cases against Aereo and its clones are pending around the

country.
29.

Beyond the cases in New York, Aereo has been sued in the District of

Massachusetts by Hearst Stations, Inc., doing business as a local Boston broadcaster, WCVB.
When Aereo asked that court to transfer its case to New York, it declined, holding that Hearst,

which controls television stations across the country, was a ―hometown plaintiff for the purposes
of th[at] litigation,‖ and was entitled to its chosen forum.52
30.

There is likewise ongoing litigation in federal district and appellate courts in

California and the District of Columbia with an Aereo clone called FilmOn X, which operates an
identical service.53 In the first case, BarryDriller, a district court in the Central District of
California enjoined FilmOnX from operating within the Ninth Circuit.54

When FilmOn X

continued to expand, another lawsuit was filed against FilmOn X in the District of Columbia.55
That court enjoined FilmOn X as well, joining the California court in rejecting the Second
Circuit‘s interpretation of the statute, which it called ―baldly wrong.‖56
ARGUMENT
The Tenth Circuit has emphasized the heavy burden on the party moving for transfer,57
directing this Court to ―honor the plaintiff‘s choice of forum ‗unless the balance in the
defendant‘s favor is shown by clear and convincing evidence.‘‖58 Aereo has fallen far short of
meeting its burden here.

A.

The Relevant Factors Weigh Heavily In Favor Of Keeping This Case In Utah.
1.

The Plaintiffs’ Choice Of Forum Is Entitled To Substantial Deference.

This Court has recognized that a plaintiff‘s choice of forum should be accorded ―great
weight.‖59 The plaintiffs filed this action in the District of Utah for a very good reason — it is
the district where Aereo‘s infringement is taking place,60 where Aereo‘s equipment that enables
the infringement is located,61 where the local broadcasters maintain their offices,62 employ
hundreds of people,63 where the populace served by plaintiffs‘ programming resides,64 and the
only place where the people to whom Aereo offers its Utah service can receive it, meaning that
the infringement at issue occurs exclusively in this district and nowhere else.65 Because this case
was brought by Utah companies ―based on Defendant[‘s] actions taken against and directed to
Plaintiffs in [Utah],‖ causing harm to ―their [Utah] based business[es],‖ and because the
plaintiffs‘ allegations ―show the facts giving rise to this action are materially related or have a
significant connection to [Utah],‖ ―this factor weighs against transferring this action.‖66
Aereo argues that the locations of some of the plaintiffs‘ parent corporations defeat their
hometown status. That is not the proper analysis. The local broadcast station plaintiffs are longestablished Utah businesses, with offices and employees located in Utah. Utah is their home

state. The employees who are key witnesses in this case reside in Utah. The cases cited by
Aereo do not say anything about the location of a parent company being relevant in a transfer
analysis.67 Aereo has not provided any basis to deviate from the Tenth Circuit‘s rule that the
plaintiff‘s choice should ―rarely be disturbed.‖68
2.

Aereo, Not The Plaintiffs, Is Guilty Of Forum Shopping.

Aereo‘s accusation that Plaintiffs have engaged in forum shopping rings hollow. It is
Aereo that gamed the system by limiting its initial launch to New York so as to ensure that the
first round of litigation against it would occur there, enabling it to take advantage of the aberrant
precedent established by the Second Circuit in Cablevision.69 This case is the first opportunity
that KSTU, KUTV, and KMYU have ever had to challenge Aereo‘s infringement in court, and
they have chosen their home forum. This is not forum shopping.70
Aereo suggests that if this Court rules on the merits it will somehow ―reverse‖ either the
Second Circuit or the District of Massachusetts (which had not issued its decision when the
plaintiffs filed this case). First, Plaintiffs specifically excluded the Second Circuit from their
request for a preliminary injunction.71 And second, this Court has the discretion — but certainly

not the obligation72 — to exclude Massachusetts from any injunction it issues, just as the District
of Columbia and California courts limited their injunctions.73
3.

The Convenience Of The Witnesses Tips Decidedly In Favor Of This District.

The convenience of the witnesses is ―the most important factor‖ in analyzing a motion to
transfer.74 To meet its burden of establishing that the plaintiffs‘ forum is inconvenient, the
movant must (1) identify the witnesses and their locations; (2) indicate the quality or materiality
of their testimony; and (3) show that any such witnesses were unwilling to come to trial, that
deposition testimony would be unsatisfactory, or that the use of compulsory process would be
necessary.75 Aereo never so much as mentioned — let alone attempted to meet — this burden.
This district is more convenient for the witnesses in this case. Station Managers Tim
Ermish and Kent Crawford, who will testify about KSTU‘s, KUTV‘s, and KMYU‘s copyrighted
local programming, their Internet offerings, their business relationships, their advertising sales,
as well as the harms that Aereo will cause to their abilities to negotiate retransmission consent
agreements, their advertising revenue, and their abilities to continue to provide high-quality local

programming to the residents of this state, both reside in this district.76 Likewise, all the other
employees of the local broadcasters, who may also be called upon to testify about the harms that
Aereo causes, live and work in Utah.77
By contrast, Aereo has not identified a single material witness who resides in New York.
Rather, Aereo misleadingly states that the four Aereo executives it identified live ―in either New
York or Massachusetts.‖78 In reality, none of the four people Aereo identified resides in New
York.79 Aereo‘s CEO Chet Kanojia and CTO Joseph Lipowski live in Massachusetts.80 Aereo‘s
Principal Antenna Engineer, Jim Bingham, lives in Ohio, and its Director of Marketing lives in
California.81 To the extent Aereo claims it would be more convenient for its employees to travel
to New York, numerous courts have held that the convenience of witnesses who do not reside in
either the original forum or the proposed transferee forum is irrelevant to the transfer analysis.82

77

16

Case 2:13-cv-00910-DN Document 43 Filed 11/08/13 Page 23 of 29

Moreover, transferring this case to New York to accommodate Aereo‘s executives at the expense
of the local Utah plaintiffs would just ―shift the inconvenience from one side to the other,‖ which
the Tenth Circuit has held is ―obviously‖ not a valid ground for a transfer.83
The only potential witnesses that Aereo has identified in New York are two third parties,
Nielsen, a company that measures television viewership and operates nationwide, and CIMM, a
small think tank that studies ways that the television industry might improve measurement for
cross-platform viewing.84

Aereo claims that Nielsen is an important witness based on its

assertion that the plaintiffs in New York are relying on the fact that Nielsen does not currently
measure Aereo‘s users.85 The arguments being made by a different set of plaintiffs in a different
case are not a relevant consideration. Plaintiffs here do allege that Aereo threatens to undermine
their position in advertising sale negotiations that rely on Nielsen ratings, but that is just one of
the multitude of irreparable harms described in Plaintiffs‘ motion.86 Moreover, to the extent that
Nielsen‘s measurement of viewership is relevant, it is unlikely that it will be necessary to call
Nielsen employees to testify, as Nielsen publicly announces what it intends to try to measure and
can or cannot measure.87 It is unclear what Aereo expects CIMM to testify about.88 Finally,
Aereo has failed to make the required showing that either Nielsen or CIMM would refuse to
come to trial, or that their ―deposition testimony would be unsatisfactory,‖ or that ―the use of

compulsory process would be necessary.‖89
4.

The “Technology” Aereo Claims Immunizes It From Liability Is In Utah.

Aereo‘s defense is that the antenna contraption it uses to retransmit Plaintiffs‘ content
over the Internet is not the type of ―device or process‖ covered by the Transmit Clause. 90 The
precise technical workings of Aereo‘s New York device have been the subject of multiple site
inspections and expert examinations in the New York case. This is because those parties must
litigate whether Aereo‘s device is the type of ―device or process‖ covered by the Transmit
Clause — even though that statute, on its face, covers ―any device or process.‖91 Plaintiffs‘ view
is that under a correct reading of the Transmit Clause, the technological architecture of Aereo‘s
system is irrelevant. Nonetheless, under Aereo‘s theory of the case, the retransmission device it
is using in Utah is a critical piece of evidence that will have to be inspected by the parties and
their experts.
5.

A Judgment Issued By This Court Would Be Equally As Enforceable As One
Issued By The Southern District Of New York.

A judgment issued by this Court would be enforceable in any district in the nation. 92 It is
baffling that Aereo has made an argument otherwise — surely Aereo is not suggesting that it
would decline to comply with an order issued by this Court.

6.

There Are No Obstacles To A Fair Trial In This District.

It is unclear why Aereo thinks it cannot get a fair trial in this district, or why it believes
that litigating in Utah would ―put an ultimate decision on the merits at risk.‖93 As discussed
above, Aereo is no thinly funded startup. Aereo has not produced a shred of evidence that
litigating this case in Utah would be cost-prohibitive, and there is no reason to credit Aereo‘s
assertion to this effect, given its CEO‘s public statements to the contrary.94
7.

The Relative Congestion Of Dockets Does Not Outweigh The Other Factors.

This factor is relatively unimportant95 and insufficient to counterbalance the other
transfer factors.96 Given the array of factors supporting litigation in this district, the fact that the
median time to resolution in Utah may be longer by a matter of months does not justify transfer.
We are confident this Court can resolve this matter in a timely manner that is fair to all parties.
8.

Plaintiffs Are Entitled To Have A Local Court Determine Aereo’s Liability
For Local Infringement.

Aereo claims this factor is ―neutral,‖ but actually it weighs against transfer. This case
should be adjudicated by a local court because, although governed by federal law, the issue is
fundamentally local: Aereo is misappropriating Utah programming broadcast by Utah stations
and selling it to Utah residents. These local ties are not overridden simply because this case

enforceable regardless of the issuing court. Defendants‘ argument that enforcement would be
easier in New Jersey because Plaintiffs would have to docket a Colorado judgment or settlement
in New Jersey before they could enforce does not tip the balance in Defendants‘ favor.‖).

involves some programming that other entities broadcast in other areas. In any event, the
inclusion of national programming in this case does not support transfer to New York, since none
of the programming at issue in this case is at issue in New York.
9.

Aereo Has Not Identified Any Other Practical Considerations That Weigh In
Favor Of Transferring This Case.

Finally, Aereo argues that it would be more efficient to transfer this case to New York
because the WNET case is pending there.97 The opposite is more likely. Any theoretical
efficiency to be gained by transfer is outweighed by the fact that this case cannot be consolidated
with the infringement action in New York because that case is substantially more advanced than
this one. In denying a very similar motion to transfer brought by Aereo in the Boston case, the
Boston district court held that the New York case is ―already quite advanced and therefore
transfer is virtually guaranteed to either delay litigation or unfairly burden‖ plaintiffs. 98 In so
holding, the Boston court joined a long line of authority denying transfer where a related case in
another district was ―considerably more advanced,‖99 or at a ―quite different‖ stage,100 or where
transfer and consolidation might cause ―protracted delay.‖101 Moreover, to the extent Aereo is

claiming that litigation in New York is preferable because Judge Nathan has ―preexisting
familiarity with the issues in this case,‖102 plaintiffs respectfully submit that this Court is more
than qualified to address the legal issues presented here.103
Aereo has suggested that, to avoid delaying the New York case or prejudicing plaintiffs,
this case could be transferred to New York but not consolidated with the infringement case
pending before Judge Nathan. But that just means the Utah action would start from scratch in
New York, creating no efficiency whatsoever.104

In fact, it would be less efficient than

proceeding in Utah, since the Utah witnesses would have to travel to New York, and the key
piece of evidence — Aereo‘s retransmission device — is located in Utah.
Aereo‘s backup suggestion, consolidating this case with the New York declaratoryjudgment action it filed against CBS, would also create no real efficiencies. A fully briefed
motion to dismiss has been pending in that action since July.105 Moreover, none of the plaintiffs
before this Court are parties to Aereo‘s declaratory-judgment case, there are no Utah stations in
that case, there are no Fox affiliates or entities in that case, and the copyrights at issue here are
not at issue in that case. Therefore, even if Aereo survives the motion to dismiss, consolidation

would not prevent duplicative discovery. To the contrary, discovery would be substantially
complicated by the addition of multiple new parties, new copyrights, and the need for discovery
into Aereo’s Utah retransmission device.
Finally, courts have rejected transfers to districts with similar pending litigation where,
among other reasons, the “commencement” of the other action “suggests forum shopping,”106
where the other litigation is between one party to the present case and an unrelated party,107 or
where the other transfer factors simply outweighed the benefits of transferring the case.108 All of
those criteria are present here.
CONCLUSION
Aereo’s motion to transfer should be denied.
