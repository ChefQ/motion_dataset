STATEMENT OF RELIEF SOUGHT
Defendant Aereo, Inc. moves pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to transfer this case to the
Southern District of New York, where the Honorable Alison J. Nathan is presiding over three
suits between Aereo and various television broadcasters (including Plaintiffs’ affiliated entities)
concerning the same technology, the same conduct, and the same legal issues. In support of this
motion, Aereo respectfully submits declarations from Chaitanya Kanojia and Alex Feerst (with
exhibits), and the following memorandum.
I.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
This case is part of a multi-front war brought by the nation’s largest broadcasting

companies against a much smaller opponent. In March 2012, the nation’s largest broadcasters—
including Fox, CBS, NBC, and ABC—sued Aereo in the Southern District of New York in two
cases, seeking a preliminary injunction. They lost. The plaintiffs appealed to the Second
Circuit, which affirmed. After a CBS executive publicly threatened to sue Aereo in every state
in the nation into which it expands, Aereo brought a declaratory judgment action in May 2013
against CBS in New York. This case is also pending before Judge Nathan. Shortly thereafter, in
July 2013, another broadcaster, Hearst Corporation (through an ABC affiliate), sued Aereo in the
District of Massachusetts, again seeking a preliminary injunction. Again, they lost. Fox
Broadcasting Company, KSTU (a Fox affiliate), and KUTV (a CBS affiliate) have now come to
this Court, using the same outside counsel as in the New York case, seeking to litigate the same
issues for a third time.
The New York court has already invested considerable time mastering the legal,
technological, and factual issues presented here. The New York case, like this case, concerns

2

Case 2:13-cv-00910-DN Document 30 Filed 10/22/13 Page 3 of 19

whether a consumer’s use of Aereo’s technology to watch and record an individual copy of
broadcast television constitutes copyright infringement. Details such as which specific
copyrights are at issue may differ, but the legal issues and underlying material facts presented to
the Southern District of New York are virtually identical to those alleged here.
Transferring this case to New York would advance the interests of judicial efficiency by
eliminating the need for this Court to plow through the lengthy record and associated legal issues
already addressed by another court. It would make litigation much more efficient for the parties
by allowing discovery in this case to be coordinated with discovery in the pending actions.
Transfer is also in the interest of justice. The judicial system has an interest in ensuring that
Aereo wins or loses on the merits. The broadcasters’ strategy of serial litigation around the
country puts that interest at risk by threatening to make outcome turn on litigation cost, rather
than the merits. For these reasons, Aereo respectfully requests a transfer of this case to the
Southern District of New York.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

Aereo and its Technology.

Aereo is a small start-up company founded in 2010 and based in Long Island City, New
1

York. Its core technology allows consumers to use a small individual remote antenna and DVR
to record and watch their individual copies of local broadcast television on internet-connected
2

devices like laptops, iPhones, and iPads. Aereo began offering its technology in Utah in August

2013. Aereo has some physical facilities in each area it offers its technology, including Utah.

4

5

But most of the company’s employees are located in New York and Boston. The Aereo
6

technology at issue in this case was developed at those east coast offices. Aereo makes its
strategic, development, engineering, finance, and marketing decisions in New York and Boston;
most of the employees and records likely relevant to the issues in this case—from product
7

function to damages—are located there too.
B.

Plaintiffs are Incorporated and Based Almost Entirely Outside Utah.

Plaintiff Fox Broadcasting Company (“Fox Broadcasting”) is a Delaware corporation
8

based in Los Angeles. It is apparently a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox, a Delaware corporation
headquartered in New York (apparently the successor to News Corporation, the entity named in
9

plaintiffs’ corporate disclosure statement).

Community Television of Utah, LLC (“Fox 13”), which does business as KSTU Fox 13,
is a Delaware LLC owned and operated by Local TV, LLC.

The New York Cases Concerning Similar Factual and Legal Issues.

In March 2012, seventeen broadcast entities sued Aereo in the Southern District of New
17

York in two actions for copyright infringement.

Those two actions are now consolidated.

18

The plaintiffs included large media conglomerates and various subsidiaries of them (including
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, CBS Broadcasting Inc., NBCUniversal Media, and
American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.) and local stations, including Fox affiliates WNYW-TV
19

and WWOR-TV.

The factual allegations were materially the same as in this case.

21

Extensive fact and expert

Aereo produced its entire source code along with hundreds of thousands of

pages of technical and schematic documents, custodian emails, member information, and
22

marketing materials.

Aereo gave the broadcasters Aereo memberships, allowed an inspection
23

of Aereo’s facility by plaintiffs’ expert, and produced an antenna board for expert analysis.
Aereo produced two detailed expert reports on how its technology functions; the plaintiffs
24

deposed both experts.

The plaintiffs proffered their own experts with respect to the Aereo

technology. The broadcasters also deposed many Aereo personnel as fact witnesses, including
its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Principal Antenna Engineer, and Director
25

of Marketing.

After two rounds of briefing, a two-day evidentiary hearing in May 2012, and another
26

round of post-hearing briefing, the court denied plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.
In the fifteen months since the court’s denial of a preliminary injunction, discovery has

continued unabated. Aereo provided an updated version of its entire source code and produced
its entire member database, including information about how members use the Aereo

After an executive of CBS publicly threatened to sue Aereo in every place it launched its
service, and in order to prevent piecemeal litigation across multiple jurisdictions, Aereo filed for
declaratory judgment in the Southern District of New York against CBS and its licensing
entities.

32

In that suit, Aereo seeks a determination with respect to all of the broadcasters’ rights
33

under the Copyright Act.

This declaratory judgment action involves the same technology, the

same Aereo witnesses and documents, and the same essential issues that have been the subject of
the two consolidated Southern District of New York actions. Defendants have moved to dismiss
34

the case.

That related action is also pending in front of the same Southern District of New
35

York judge.

The Boston Case Against Aereo.

On April 23, 2013, Aereo publicly announced its plans to launch its technology in
Boston, Massachusetts on May 15, 2013.
37

30.

36

Aereo became generally available in Boston on May
38

On July 9, 2013, Hearst Stations Inc. sued Aereo in the District of Massachusetts.

Hearst
39

Television, Inc. owns nearly 30 television stations and has CBS, ABC, and NBC affiliates.

On

October 8, 2013, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and Aereo’s
40

motion to transfer the Boston litigation to New York.

The Boston court denied Aereo’s

transfer motion, reasoning that: (1) the actions pending in New York were at an advanced stage
and therefore would probably delay litigation or burden Hearst; and (2) because Hearst limited
its suit to local programming only and sued in its capacity as owner of a local station, it was a
“hometown plaintiff.”

41

Location of Witnesses and Evidence.

Plaintiffs’ irreparable harm theory in the New York and Boston cases rests in part on the
claim that it may not be possible to measure viewership through the Aereo technology. Without
knowledge of who is viewing, they assert, their negotiating position is undermined and they lose
advertising revenue. And the broadcasters contend that entities such as the Nielsen Company and
the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (“CIMM”) do not and perhaps cannot measure

Aereo viewership.

As a result, the parties are taking discovery into how companies such as

Nielsen in fact plan to gather data from services like Aereo and incorporate that information into
43

their ratings numbers, a process apparently underway.

This evidence is central to Aereo’s

response to plaintiffs’ damages and irreparable harm theories. Aereo has issued a deposition
subpoena for the Nielsen Company on this topic; Nielsen is located in New York.

44

Aereo has

also noticed a deposition for CIMM on this topic; CIMM is also located in New York.

These

non-party witnesses can be compelled to attend a trial in New York but not one in Utah.

ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standard.

Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the
interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division
where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have
consented.” The Court has broad discretion to transfer this case to any such forum according to
an “individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.”

46

The question of

“whether to dismiss or transfer an action filed in an improper venue is within the district court’s
47

sound discretion.”

B.

This Action Could Have Been Brought in the Southern District of New York.

“Civil actions, suits, or proceedings arising under any Act of Congress relating to
copyrights … may be instituted in the district in which the defendant or his agent resides or may
be found.”

48

Aereo has its headquarters is in the Southern District of New York and is therefore

subject to personal jurisdiction there. This satisfies the threshold requirement for transfer under
28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a).
C.

Transfer to the Southern District of New York Would Further the
Convenience of the Parties and the Interest of Justice.

The court considers a number of factors in ruling on a motion to transfer: (1) the
plaintiff's choice of forum; (2) the accessibility of witnesses and other sources of proof, including
the availability of compulsory process to insure the attendance of witnesses; (3) the cost of
making the necessary proof; (4) the enforceability of a judgment if one is obtained; (5) relative
advantages and obstacles to a fair trial; (6) difficulties that may arise from congested dockets; (7)
the possibility of the existence of questions arising in the area of conflict of laws; (8) the
advantage of having a local court determine questions of local law; and (9) all other
49

considerations of a practical nature that make a trial easy, expeditious and economical.

As

discussed below, these factors favor transfer in this case.
1.

Plaintiff’s choice of forum is not dispositive

Plaintiffs’ decision to bring this action in Utah is generally entitled to some deference,

48

28 U.S.C. § 1400 (a).
Chrysler Credit Corp. v. County Chrysler, Inc., 928 F.2d 1509, 1516 (10th Cir. 1991) (citation
omitted).
49

10

Case 2:13-cv-00910-DN Document 30 Filed 10/22/13 Page 11 of 19

but that deference is lessened “where plaintiff does not reside in the forum.”

50

Fox 13 is a

Delaware LLC owned by a Delaware corporation headquartered in Chicago. Fox Broadcasting
is a Delaware company based in Los Angeles that is the wholly-owned subsidiary of another
Delaware company based, like Aereo, in New York. KUTV is a Maryland-based Nevada LLC
owned by a Maryland-based Maryland corporation, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.

51

None of

the parties is incorporated in Utah and only Fox 13 (held by a series of entities based elsewhere)
appears to be based there. KSTU and KUTV, the two putatively local plaintiffs, are owned by
media conglomerates incorporated and based outside Utah. As a result, Plaintiffs’ choice of
52

forum does not receive the deference afforded plaintiffs litigating at home.

In evaluating this factor, the Court should also consider whether plaintiffs have engaged
in strategic forum shopping.

53

Plaintiffs ask this Court to impose an injunction that would be

operative everywhere except in the Second Circuit. But, the New York court already rejected an
injunction request by plaintiffs that was not circumscribed geographically. Meanwhile, the New
York court is evaluating the propriety of a nationwide injunction (in the declaratory relief case
brought by Aereo) clarifying that use of Aereo’s technology is not infringement. Further, Hearst

See Hall-Kimbrell Envt’l Servs., Inc. v. Archdiocese of Detroit, 878 F. Supp. 1409, 1416 (D.
Kan. 1995) (granting motion to transfer where plaintiff previously “commence[d] a virtually
identical action against [the defendant] and is currently defending a similar action in [another
forum],” and where plaintiff “has engaged in a strategic plan something akin to forum
shopping”).

Case 2:13-cv-00910-DN Document 30 Filed 10/22/13 Page 12 of 19

sought a nationwide injunction against Aereo in the District of Massachusetts and the court has
already denied it. That order is now pending appeal to the First Circuit. Plaintiffs’ request in
this case for an injunction that would cover territory in the First Circuit threatens to remotely
reverse the decision of the Boston court. Worse, it sets this Court on a potential collision course
with the First Circuit. The broadcasters’ attempt to litigate these issues again in a different court,
having already lost preliminary injunction fights in both New York and Boston, is forum
shopping. Such efforts should be rejected by the Court.
2.

Many witnesses are in New York and Boston, lowering the cost of
necessary proof in New York

“The convenience of witnesses is the most important factor in deciding a motion under §
54

1404(a).”

Aereo is headquartered in the Southern District of New York.

55

Aereo is not aware

of any Aereo witnesses located in Utah, as evident from discovery taken by plaintiffs in the New
56

York cases.

Important non-party witnesses are also located in New York, beyond the subpoena

power of this court. For example, in both the Boston and New York cases plaintiffs’ irreparable
harm theory relies on the presumed inability of ratings companies like Nielsen to adequately
57

measure Aereo’s users.

This is a subject of discovery in the New York case.

outside this district, and in the transferee forum, this factor counsels in favor of transfer.

61

Aereo has only limited technological facilities in Utah and stores few records there.
Aereo’s technology was developed in Boston and New York.

62

Aereo maintains its records

regarding its technology, structure, and operation, as well as financial information, in New York
and Boston.

Both live on

These witnesses will have to travel across the country to testify if the case is not

transferred, making Aereo’s cost of necessary proof greater in Utah.
3.

The enforceability of any judgment issued

The enforceability factor favors transfer to the jurisdiction where the defendant resides.

67

This factor therefore favors transfer to New York, where Aereo is based. So, too, does the

See Star Stone Quarries, Inc. v. Garland, 300 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1182 (D. Utah 2003)

13

Case 2:13-cv-00910-DN Document 30 Filed 10/22/13 Page 14 of 19

completeness of the relief that can be afforded. The New York court can evaluate Aereo’s
conduct on a nationwide basis. Plaintiffs ask this Court to exempt from its scrutiny Aereo’s
conduct in the Second Circuit, guaranteeing piecemeal, and more expensive, litigation.
4.

Relative advantages and obstacles to a fair trial

Transfer to New York would eliminate “potential obstacles covering compulsory
attendance of witnesses, and other evidence outside the control of the parties,” as explained
above.

68

Moreover, overwhelming litigation costs are an obstacle to a fair trial, particularly

when they put an ultimate decision on the merits at risk. Aereo is a recent startup; it confronts an
array of large and well-funded litigation adversaries. Particularly in this circumstance, the cost
of seriatim and geographically dispersed litigation is a compelling consideration in favor of
transfer.
5.

Difficulties that may arise from congested dockets

Statistics relevant to docket congestion include “median time from filing to disposition,
median time from filing to trial, pending cases per judge, and average weighted filings per
69

judge.”

As of June 2013, median time from filing to disposition for civil cases in Utah is 11
70

months; in Southern District of New York it is 8.3.

Median time from filing to trial for civil
71

cases in Utah is 38 months; in Southern District of New York it is 26.6.

The number of

pending cases per judge in Utah was 456 and average weighted filings was 507; in Southern

District of New York the corresponding figures are 333 pending cases per judge and 469
weighted filings.

72

All of the above figures suggest that the Southern District of New York

docket is less congested that the docket in the District of Utah. It is also significant that the serial
litigation of the issues presented here would unnecessarily congest the dockets of multiple
districts, undermining the policies reflected in this factor.
6.

Potential conflict of laws and the advantage of having a local court
determine questions of local law

The law at issue here is federal copyright law, making conflict of law and local law issues
73

irrelevant.

74

The merits are also not “unique to [the] particular locale.”

In the Massachusetts

case, the court found that plaintiff’s “decision to limit the scope of the suit … to local
programming” weighed in favor of keeping the suit local.
76

so limit themselves.

75

Here, however, plaintiffs declined to

Because Plaintiffs have sued on a mix of local and national programming

(some of which is also at issue in other suits against Aereo), and the law at issue is federal, not
77

state law, the merits of this case are not unique to the locale, making this factor neutral.

7.

All other considerations of a practical nature that make a trial easy,
expeditious and economical

This case is at heart a re-run of the Southern District of New York litigation. The
presence of “a related case in the transferee forum is a powerful reason to grant a change of
78

venue.”

That is true for reasons having to do with both the courts and the parties. The New

York court has preexisting familiarity with the issues in the case, and transferring the case would
eliminate the need for this Court to duplicate work already done in New York. Transferring the
79

case to New York would also create substantial efficiencies for the parties.

In declining to transfer the Boston case to New York, Judge Gorton noted that because
80

the New York cases are “quite advanced,” transfer there would delay litigation.

That delay

would only result if the cases were consolidated, rather than merely proceeding in front of the
same judge. And, while the two cases filed against Aereo on March 1, 2012 are at an advanced
stage, the declaratory judgment action in front of the same judge was filed only a few months

could be had in simultaneous litigation in two separate districts on issues that are so closely
related.”). See also Nature’s Way Products, Inc. v. Zila Nutraceuticals, Inc., No. 2:06cv00667,

ago and is still in its infancy.

This case could be coordinated with the declaratory judgment

action for pretrial proceedings, avoiding the duplication of discovery.
Each new case broadcast companies and their affiliates file in another jurisdiction makes
the case for transfer more compelling. Each new case increases the burden of duplicative work
on the defendant and on courts, intensifies the risk of disparate findings on similar factual and
legal issues, and encourages plaintiffs to seek out yet more forums for the same grievance.
Allowing this case to proceed would waste judicial resources by retreading the same issues, lead
to the risk of inconsistent results on virtually identical facts, and prejudice Aereo.
IV.

CONCLUSION
This case is the third shot at Aereo. At some point, the interests of efficiency and justice

outweigh the plaintiffs’ choice of forum. The television networks have affiliates in every
circuit—but that does not entitle them to twelve swings at a preliminary injunction on the same
facts and law. Aereo should not be forced to litigate the same issues in jurisdictions across the
country against the coordinated efforts of the entire broadcast industry. For the reasons stated
above, Aereo respectfully requests the Court transfer this action to the Southern District of New
York.
