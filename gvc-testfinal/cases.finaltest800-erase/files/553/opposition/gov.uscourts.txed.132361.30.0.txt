No. 2:11-cv-00424-MHS-CMC
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

GEOTAG, INC.’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT
7-ELEVEN, INC.’S MOTION TO STAY
Plaintiff GeoTag, Inc. (“GeoTag”) hereby responds to Defendant 7-Eleven, Inc.’s (“7Eleven”) Motion to Stay filed on June 1, 2012 (Dkt. 29) as follows.
Defendant 7-Eleven requests the Court stay this action in favor of the declaratory
judgment action filed by Microsoft and Google pending in Delaware. 7-Eleven does not
present any evidence or argument explaining how the Delaware litigation would resolve
GeoTag’s claims against it in this litigation. Instead, 7-Eleven relies entirely on the
arguments previously made to the Court by other defendants in other actions. But none
of those arguments even suggested that the Delaware litigation could resolve all or even
most of the issues regarding GeoTag’s claims against 7-Eleven. Indeed, 7-Eleven does
not present any evidence or argument that GeoTag’s claims against it share any common
issues with the Delaware litigation.
This Court in Levine v. Casio America Inc., Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-00056MHS (E.D. Tex. May 2, 2012) recently denied a motion stay for similar reasons. In that

lawsuit, the Court declared that, “[a]lthough some issues may be resolved in [the other
pending lawsuit], the Court is unpersuaded that the resolution of that case would entirely
resolve the instant matter. Ultimately, judicial economy would be better served by
allowing both cases to proceed contemporaneously.” Id. at 3. The same is true in this
case.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny 7-Eleven’s motion.
