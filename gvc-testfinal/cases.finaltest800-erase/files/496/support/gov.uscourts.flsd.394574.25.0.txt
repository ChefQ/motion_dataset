Privileged Mail – Inmates are permitted to send sealed letters to a
specified group of persons and organizations, such as courts,
counsel, officials of the confining authority, state and local chief
executives, administrators of grievance systems, and members of the
paroling authority. Staff, in the presence of the inmate, may be
allowed to inspect the outgoing privileged mail for contraband before
it is sealed. Mail to inmates from this specified group of persons and
organizations may be opened only to inspect for contraband and only
in the presence of the inmate, unless waived in writing, or in
circumstances which may indicate contamination. ...

See Exhibit “A” - C.O.P. 929.00 and Inmate Mail Notice.
2.

The Palm Beach County detention facilities house approximately 3000

inmates. The property section of the jail is held accountable for the proper acceptance,
storage and releasing of inmate’s personal property. The property section also initiates
inmate’s accounts, makes deposits and withdrawals, and processes funds for release while
maintaining accurate records and ledgers for all financial transactions. The property section
also processes all inmate incoming and outgoing mail including privileged correspondence.
[See Exhibit “B” - Affidavit of Michelle DeLaura.]
3.

All incoming inmate mail is reviewed to insure it is properly addressed so the

recipient can be appropriately identified. All incoming mail is opened, inspected, and
monitored to insure there is no contraband, which includes illegal substances, contained
in the mail. The mail is monitored for encoded messages, gang affiliations, criminal activity,
security threats, and any other material which may disrupt the facility and pose a potential
threat to security. Privileged correspondence is opened and inspected in the presence of
the inmate. [See Exhibit “B”.]
4.

All outgoing mail, except privileged correspondence, must be sent to the mail
4

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 5 of 21

room for processing unsealed. Once the outgoing mail is reviewed and inspected for plans
to escape, plans of violence, threats to others, and any other material which poses a
potential threat to security and others, the mail is sealed and brought to the US Post Office.
[See Exhibit “B”.]
5.

There are generally four (4) Correction Support Personnel assigned to

process inmate mail.

During the years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 the mail room

processed approximately 11,000 letters monthly. The Sheriff’s Office implemented a
“postcard only” policy on September 19, 2011 [see Exhibit “A”], which has greatly reduced
the number of letters in envelopes that are being processed. The new policy restricts the
use of envelopes for non-privileged incoming mail only allowing money orders to be mailed
using an envelope. Otherwise, general, non-privileged correspondence must be sent into
the facility using a postcard that conforms to the policy. [See Exhibit “B”.]
6.

The postcard only policy was implemented as a method to address the daily

concerns of receiving potentially dangerous and hazardous materials in the mail through
the use of an envelope. The property section was continually receiving greeting cards
contained in envelopes that consisted of multiple layered parts. Senders placed drugs,
tobacco, money, and other contraband items between the layers of the card and glued the
layers together in an attempt to conceal the hazardous items within an envelope. It was
also common for the mail staff to discover drugs and drug paraphernalia concealed in the
seams of an envelope. Often, senders would include a small stack of multiple page letters
in an envelope where they would hide contraband between the pages. There have been
numerous incidences where drugs, tobacco, money, metal pins, and other dangerous
contraband have been located while opening and inspecting letters arriving in envelopes.
5

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 6 of 21

These types of incidents have occurred and still occur through the use of fake legal mail
as legal mail can be sent into the facility in an envelope. Fire Rescue has responded to a
number of suspicious white powder incidences that occurred while opening incoming mail
envelopes. The occurrence of a chemical biological incident (white powder incident) results
in a facility shut down and all inmate movement ceases. This affects the inmates, the staff,
the general public, the court system, and every other entity associated with the detention
facility. [See Exhibit “B”.]
7.

Since the implementation of the postcard only incoming general mail policy,

the number of incidences involving attempts to introduce contraband into the facility by way
of an envelope containing cards or multiple pieces of paper has greatly diminished.
However, even the limitation regarding the use of a postcard for incoming general, nonprivileged mail has not prevented all attempts to introduce contraband into the facility. [See
Exhibit “B”.]
8.

A review of records regularly generated and maintained by jail staff reveals

the following examples, which are not exhaustive, of security problems related to incoming
mail.

06/05/2008 2.1 Grams of suspected marijuana was found hidden in an incoming
anniversary card.
06/09/2008 1.7 grams of marijuana was found in an incoming anniversary card.

09/24/2012 While searching incoming inmate legal mail in the presence of the
inmate, it was discovered to be personal mail containing unauthorized

10/04/2012 Staff located a suspicious yellow and white substance while
processing incoming inmate postcards addressed to inmate Ali,
Zaheer.
[See Exhibit “B” and photographs attached thereto.]
9.

The postcard only policy has resulted in a significant decrease in the

introduction of contraband through the use of correspondence contained within an
envelope. It is the envelope and the need to physically open each envelope to inspect the
contents of incoming mail that greatly increases the possibility that contraband will be
introduced into the jail facility. Postcards are not contained in envelopes and do not contain
multi-layered cards or sheets of paper and do not have to be opened and inspected by
staff. The lack of an envelope has reduced the introduction of contraband into the jail and
is less time consuming and easier to inspect and process, making it less likely, through
human error, that contraband contained in an envelope will enter the facility.
[See Exhibit “B” – Affidavit of Michelle DeLaura and photographs attached thereto.]
10.

The jail facility also allows visitation with family and friends as an alternative

form of communication between inmates and members of the public. [See Exhibit “C” -

C.O.P. 930.00.]3 Furthermore, the inmates have access to telephones to make collect
calls. Telephone conversations also offer an alternative means of communication outside
of the United States mail system. Consequently, Plaintiff could have an inmate call him as
an additional form of communication. [See Exhibit “D”.]

Plaintiff admits that visitation is allowed. [DE 1–Notice of Removal–Complaint, paragraph

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
ARGUMENT
The standard of review which must be applied by the Court as contained in Rule
56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure reads in pertinent part as follows:
The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
If the party seeking summary judgment meets the initial burden of demonstrating the
absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party,
in this case, the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is then required to come forward with sufficient
evidence to rebut the showing with affidavits or other relevant and admissible evidence.
See Avirgan v. Hull, 932 F.2d 1572, 1577 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 913 (1992).
It is the non-moving party’s burden to come forward with evidence on each essential
element of his or her claim sufficient to sustain a jury verdict. See Earley v. Champion
International Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir. 1990). See also Matsushita Electronic
Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) [Plaintiff must produce
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.].

42 U.S.C. SECTION 1983 OFFICIAL CAPACITY CIVIL RIGHTS
CLAIM AGAINST THE DEFENDANT SHERIFF RIC BRADSHAW (PBSO)
There is no dispute that this case involves the formal implementation of an official
policy that limits incoming, non-privileged general mail to the use of a postcard. The policy
does not apply to legal or privileged mail. [See Exhibits “A” and “B”.] Thus, a single incident
of unconstitutional behavior by a subordinate employee of the official policy making

11

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 12 of 21

authority is sufficient to bring a Section 1983 cause of action.

See e.g. Monell v.

Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). It is the Defendant Sheriff’s position
in this case, however, that his official policy limiting incoming , non-privileged general mail
to the use of a postcard is constitutional.
THE POSTCARD ONLY MAIL POLICY
The Sheriff’s incoming postcard only policy does not amount to censorship or a
restriction upon permissible and legitimate correspondence between members of the public
and inmates.4 In that sense, the difference between sending a postcard and sending a
letter in an envelope is limited to the amount of space available to write the intended
message. The policy does not limit the amount of postcard mail which can be sent, thus
multiple postcards can be sent. Therefore, when considering the security concerns posed
by incoming mail in envelopes, the Sheriff’s policy should be viewed as a limitation on the
amount of paper (space) available to communicate in writing rather than a restriction on the
message. [See Exhibits “A” and “B”.]
To the extent that the Plaintiff has some right, under the First Amendment applicable
to state governmental action through the Fourteenth Amendment, as a free citizen, to
communicate with inmates in the Palm Beach County Jail, that right is not unfettered and
is not governed by the legal standard stated in the Plaintiff’s Complaint, namely that the
Sheriff must have a compelling government interest to implement the policy in the least
restrictive manner.
As stated, the policy in question restricts incoming mail which enters the corrections

4

Of course, attempts to communicate in code, make escape plans, or otherwise commit a
crime, would be prohibited.

12

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 13 of 21

facility. Courts have previously held that the issue of the constitutionality of incoming
postcard only inmate mail policies requires only a finding that the policy is reasonably
related to legitimate penological interests. See United States Middle District of Florida case
Ditullio v. White, Case No. 8:10-cv-294-T-26AEP (Jan. 28, 2010); Covell v. Arpaio, 662
F.Supp.2d 1146 (D. Ariz. 2009); Gieck v. Arpaio, 2008 W.L. 2604919 at *5 (D. Ariz., June
23, 2008); Gibbons v. Arpaio, 2008 W.L. 4447003 at *6 (D. Ariz., October 2, 2008); and
United States Middle District of Florida case Gambuzza v. Parmenter, Case No. 8:09-CV1891-T-17-TBM (May 28, 2010).
The Defendant recognizes that a jail does not form a barrier separating prison
inmates from the protections of the Constitution, including the First Amendment.
Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 407 (1989). Inmates have a constitutional right to
send and receive mail and the First Amendment provides protection against censorship of
prisoners’ correspondence. Rodriguez v. Ames, 224 F.Supp.2d 555 (W.D.N.Y. 2002);
Koutnik v. Brown, 396 F.Supp.2d 978 (W.D. Wis. 2005); Covell v. Arpaio, 662 F.Supp.2d
1146 (D. Ariz. 2009). However, the Plaintiff here is not an inmate. It is the Defendant’s
position that the constitutional analysis should be the same as it would be if the Plaintiff was
an inmate as the question still involves legitimate institutional security concerns. The courts
have repeatedly stated that the judiciary “is ill-equipped to deal with the difficult and delicate
problems of prison management” Thornburgh, at 407. As a result, the courts afford
“considerable deference to the determinations of prison administrators who, in the interest
of security, regulate the relations between prisoners and the outside world.” Id. at 407-408;
see also Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003).
In setting the standard for review of prison or jail regulations, the Supreme Court in
13

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 14 of 21

Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), held that when a prison regulation impinges on
inmates’ constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate
penological interests. The Court at pages 89 - 90 specifically noted:
In our view, such a standard is necessary if ‘prison
administrators ..., and to the courts, [are] to make the difficult
judgments concerning institutional operations.’ Jones v. North
Carolina Prisoners’ Union, 433 U.S. at 128. Subjecting the
day-today judgment of prison officials to an inflexible strict
scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to
anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions
to the intractable problems of prison administration. The rule
would also distort the decision making [sic] process, for every
administrative judgment would be subject to the possibility that
some court somewhere would conclude that it had a less
restrictive way of solving the problem at hand. Courts
inevitably would become the primary arbiters of what
constitutes the best solution to every administrative problem,
thereby ‘unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the involvement of the
federal courts in affairs of prison administration.’ Procunier v.
Martinez, 416 U.S. at 407.
The Court in Turner then set forth the factors to be considered in determining the
reasonableness of a particular regulation. First, there must be a valid, rational connection
between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify
it. Second, there should be alternative means of exercising the right that remains open to
prison inmates, further considering that where other avenues remain available for the
exercise of the asserted right, the courts should be particularly conscious of the measure
of judicial deference owed to corrections officials in gauging the validity of the regulation.
Third, a court must consider the impact the accommodation of the asserted constitutional
right will have on guards and other inmates and on the allocation of prison resources
generally. Here, the Court noted that in the necessarily closed environment of the
correctional institution, few changes will have no ramifications on the liberty of others or on
14

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 15 of 21

the use of the prison’s limited resources for preserving institutional order.

When

accommodation of an asserted right will have a significant ripple effect on fellow inmates
or on prison staff, courts should be particularly deferential to the informed discretion of
corrections officials. Finally, the Court held that the absence of ready alternatives is
evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation and that, by the same token, the
existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not
reasonable, but is an exaggerated response to prison concerns. The Court specifically
recognized: “This is not a ‘least restrictive alternative’ test: prison officials do not have to
set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the
claimant’s constitutional complaint. But if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative
that fully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological
interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the
reasonable relationship standard.” Id. at 89-90.5
The Supreme Court’s holding in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 413-14 (1974),
sets forth standards for evaluating claims of censorship of outgoing mail.6 In that case, the
Court recognized that although censorship of inmate outgoing mail may be justified under
certain limited circumstances, simple efforts to eliminate unflattering or unwelcome opinions

5

Applying this standard, the court in Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d 1054, 1060 (9th Cir. 1999)
stated: “To show a rational relationship between a regulation and a legitimate penological interest,
prison officials need not prove that the banned material actually caused problems in the past, or
that the materials are ‘likely’ to cause problems in the future. Moreover, it ‘does not matter whether
we agree with’ the defendants or whether the policy ‘in fact advances’ the jail’s legitimate interests.
The only question that we must answer is whether the defendants’ judgment was ‘rational,’ that is,
whether the defendants might reasonably have thought that the policy would advance its interests.”
(citations omitted).
6

Martinez has been limited by the holding of Thornburgh, supra.

15

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 16 of 21

or factually inaccurate statements would not suffice. Even so, the Court recognized that
if corrections officials could show that substantial governmental interests of security, order,
and rehabilitation existed as it pertained to a particular regulation or act and that the
limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary or essential
to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved, the regulation would
withstand scrutiny. In addition, the Court stated: “This does not mean, of course, that
prison administrators may be required to show with certainty that adverse consequences
would flow from the failure to censor a particular letter. Some latitude in anticipating the
probable consequences of allowing certain speech in a prison environment is essential to
the proper discharge of an administrator’s duty.” Id, at 414. It is clear the rule of Martinez
is directed toward acts of censorship, not regulation as to the format utilized in the exercise
of the freedom of speech allowed to inmates. Martinez offers no comment related to
restriction of the means utilized to communicate by mail where there is no effort on the part
of corrections officials to censor the content of a message; it has limited application to the
facts of this case and cannot be applied as a per se standard to be applied to any review
of an act or regulation related to incoming, general mail. To the extent Martinez survives
Thornburgh, Martinez acknowledges some right that a free citizen has to receive mail from
an inmate in an uncensored manner. Mr. Althouse, however, has no right to send any form
of communication he chooses into a jail facility. In addition, the Sheriff’s policy only restricts
incoming mail for security reasons.
Courts have addressed the issue of postcard only regulations in the context of
incoming mail. In Covell v. Arpaio, 662 F.Supp.2d 1146 (D. Ariz. 2009), a prisoner held in
the county jail brought an action claiming that the sheriff violated his First Amendment
16

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 17 of 21

rights by instituting a policy that restricted incoming mail to metered postcards. The court,
of course, recognized the rights of inmates under the First Amendment to send and receive
mail, but also recognized that these rights are limited by the fact of incarceration and they
may be curtailed to achieve legitimate correctional goals. The court applied the test set
forth in Turner v. Safley, recognizing that the standard is deferential to the professional
judgment of prison administrators. The court then looked at the four factors individually.
As to the first prong, the court concluded that there was a rational connection to a
legitimate governmental interest in the regulation: jail security. The court noted that when
the inmate does not present enough evidence to refute a common sense connection
between the prison regulation and the objective that the government argues the policy is
designed to further, then the first prong of the Turner test is satisfied. The court concluded
the second prong was satisfied because the alternative means of exercising the right at
issue, such as metered postcards, telephones and jail visits, although all less than ideal,
were sufficient. Alternatives provided by the jail need not be ideal, only available. In terms
of the third prong, the adverse impact of accommodation, the court noted that eliminating
stamped mail allowed the jail’s limited security staff to devote more time to prison security
assignments. Here, the court again noted the deference to the informed discretion of
correction officials. Finally, the court found that the plaintiff failed to meet the burden of
showing that there were obvious or easy alternatives to the regulation or that it constituted
an exaggerated response, particularly that there was a way to accommodate the right at
a de minimis cost to the valid penological purpose.
In addition, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida has
dismissed a complaint filed by an inmate challenging a postcard only regulation applied to
17

incoming mail in the Manatee County Jail. The court cited to the limitation of privileges and
rights that accompanies incarceration and the need to strike a balance between the rights
of prisoners and the discretion given prison administrators to govern the order and security
of a corrections facility. The court found the postcard only policy to be reasonably related
to legitimate penological interests. Gambuzza v. Parmenter, 8:09-cv-1891-T-17TBM (M.D.
Fla. 2010). Although the cases which address the constitutionality of incoming general mail
postcard only policies involved inmate Plaintiffs, it follows that these opinions equally apply
to non-inmate citizens who seek to send mail to an inmate. Obviously the opinions of
courts that have held that an incoming postcard only mail policy is constitutional have
applied equally to the persons sending the mail into the facility as well as to the inmates
receiving it. This is true despite the fact that the citizen sending the mail was not a party.
It would be impossible to have a policy that would allow Plaintiff to send mail in envelopes
into the jail and yet forbid the inmate from receiving it unless it was a postcard.
In the instant case, the legitimate penological interests are obvious. First, incoming
envelopes containing multiple pages of paper or multi-fold greeting cards presents a
significant opportunity to introduce contraband into the jail.7 Second, the amount of jail staff
time that is taken up in opening and inspecting mail in envelopes exceeds the time that is
necessary to inspect postcards. Finally, the inspection of a postcard, rather than a sealed
envelope, increases the likelihood that staff will discover an attempt to introduce
contraband into the jail facility, as the jail receives thousands of incoming mail pieces
monthly. [See Exhibit “B”.]

In Koutnik v. Brown, 396 F.Supp.2d 978 (W.D. Wis. 2005), a prison inmate sued
alleging that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was prevented from mailing
a letter that contained a drawing believed to contain encoded references to gang activities.
The court granted summary judgment. In doing so, the court recognized that the First
Amendment provided protection against censorship of prisoner’s incoming and outgoing
correspondence, but also that legitimate governmental interest may justify the imposition
of certain restraints on inmate correspondence.

The court noted the two different

standards that have been utilized distinguishing between incoming inmate mail and
outgoing inmate mail and that a less deferential standard applies to the censorship of
outgoing prisoner mail. The court cited to Thornburgh v. Abbott, supra, and Procunier v.
Martinez, supra, for the proposition that corrections officials must show that the regulation
or practice in question furthers an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated
to the suppression of expression and that the limitation of the First Amendment freedoms
is no greater than necessary or essential to protect a particular governmental interest
involved. The less deferential analysis was applied because the implications for prison
security with outgoing correspondence are of a lesser magnitude than the implications for
incoming materials. Even applying this standard, the court held that it should not unduly
limit the discretion of prison officials in rejecting outgoing mail and should ask only whether
the restrictions are generally necessary to protect the interest at stake.
This case is unusual because the Plaintiff is not an inmate. This case also involves
the limitations of incoming mail, not outgoing mail. Therefore, there is no reason to apply
a different federal constitutional analysis to the issues raised then is required by Turner.
This case does not invoke censorship of inmate, outgoing mail and rather, involves security
19

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 20 of 21

concerns posed by incoming mail, which otherwise is not limited in quantity. In Perry v.
Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, 664 F.3d 1359 (11th Cir. 2011), the Eleventh
Circuit Court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the Defendant, applying the Turner
reasonableness standard where the Plaintiff in that case was not an inmate.
Finally, the Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that his rights as found in Florida’s
Constitution have been violated. [Article I, Section 4 – see DE1–Notice of Removal –
Complaint, paragraph 16.] To the extent Plaintiff has such a right, it mirror’s Plaintiff’s
rights, if any, as found in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because
the Sheriff’s incoming postcard only inmate mail policy is reasonably related to legitimate
penological concerns, the Plaintiff’s rights, if any, under Florida’s Constitution have not
been violated.
In Simon v. Celebration Company, et.al., 883 So.2d 826 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004), the
court affirmed dismissal of Count II of the Plaintiff’s Complaint which sought declaratory
relief under Florida law, alleging a violation of Article IX, Section 1 of Florida’s Constitution.
The court in Simon found that a constitutional provision must be self executing in order to
create a private cause of action, citing Tucker v. Resha, 634 So.2d 756 (Fla. 1st DCA 1994).
The court went on to note that the test for determining whether a constitutional provision
should be construed as self executing or not self executing, depends upon whether the
constitutional provision lays down sufficient rules such that the right may be determined or
enjoyed or protected without the aid of legislative enactment, citing Gray v. Bryant, 125
So.2d 846 (Fla. 1960). The court in Simon went on to conclude that Article IX, Section 1
is not self executing because the language leaves too many issues unresolved. The same
can be said for the provision of Florida’s Constitution [Article I, Section 4] upon which the
20

Case 9:12-cv-80135-KAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2012 Page 21 of 21

Plaintiff, Mr. Althouse, relies. This section of Florida’s Constitution is not self executing.
See also Fernez v. Calbrese, 760 So.2d 1144 (Fla. 5th DCA 2000).
In addition, Plaintiff seeks, in his declaratory judgment claim, “further relief as the
Court deems appropriate”. To the extent Plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages,
courts in Florida have recognized that Florida’s Constitution does not provide for a private
cause of action included within Florida’s waiver of sovereign immunity in the form of a state
constitutional tort. Resha v. Tucker, 670 So.2d 56 (Fla. 1996); Garcia v. Reyes, 697 So.2d
549 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997).
The motion should be granted.
