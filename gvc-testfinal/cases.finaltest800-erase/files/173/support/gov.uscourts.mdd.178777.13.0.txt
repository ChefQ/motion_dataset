Defendants,

 

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO REMAND
Plaintiff, Rodney Anthony Robertson ("Mr. Robertson'), through his
undersigned counsel, moves this Honorable Court to remand this action pursuant to 28
U.S.C.A. Section 1447(c) to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, where
this action was filed, and in support thereof, state as follows.

1. On April 2, 2010, Mr. Robertson filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore
City, Maryland against Defendants Brian Iuliano, M.D. ("Dr. luliano"),
Neurosurgery Services, LLC, Neurosurgery Associates, Inc., and St. Agnes
Healthcare, Inc. LLC ("St. Agnes"). Mr. Robertson alleges that Defendants failed
to obtain informed consent in connection with surgery performed on his back.

2. On May 24, 2010, Dr. Iuliano, a now resident of the State of Washington and former
resident of Maryland, removed the case to Federal District Court.

3. Removal is premised on the allegation of diversity jurisdiction.

4. St. Agnes, Neurosurgery Services, LLC, and Neurosurgery Associates, Inc are

1
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document 13 Filed 06/23/10 Page 2 of 17

Maryland entities with their principal place of business in the State of Maryland (the

"Maryland Defendants").

. None of the Defendants had been served, including the forum defendants, prior to

filing of the Notice of Removal Remove. It is unclear from his petition when he

received a copy of the Complaint.

. Removal is improper under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) as St. Agnes, Neurosurgery Services,

LLC, and Neurosurgery Associates, Inc are all Maryland entities.

. Removal is improper under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) because none of the Defendants had been

served prior to the filing of the Notice of Removal and were not joined.

. Dr. Iuliano's Notice of Removal is defective as it has not been timely filed.
WHEREFORE, Mr. Robertson respectfully requests this Honorable Court issue

an Order directing the Clerk to remand this action to the Circuit Court for Baltimore

City.

PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO REMAND

Plaintiff, Rodney Anthony Robertson ("Mr. Robertson"), through his
undersigned counsel, submits this memorandum in support of his motion to remand to
the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland.

BACKGROUND

On June 22, 2006, Mr. Robertson had back surgery. Defendant Brian A. Iuliano,
M.D. (Dr. Juliano") performed the procedure at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore City. Mr.
Robertson was discharged on June 24, 2006. Approximately 2 weeks later, Mr. Robertson
had problems with the surgical wound site. He was diagnosed with an infection at the
surgical site secondary to the back surgery. On July 27, 2006, Mr. Robertson underwent an
irrigation and debridement of the wound by Dr. Iuliano. Mr. Robertson continued to
experience back and left and right leg pain. On November 21, 2006, Mr. Robertson
underwent an exploration of the previous surgical site. During the procedure, Dr. Iuliano

found necrotic material. Mr. Robertson was diagnosed with diskitis and infection. He was
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document 13 Filed 06/23/10 Page 5 of 17

not discharged until December 6, 2006. As a result of the infection, there was an
obliteration of the disc space and deformity of the L4-5 vertebral bodies.

On April 2, 2010, Mr. Robertson filed the Complaint in the Circuit for
Baltimore City, asserting claims against Dr. Iuliano, St. Agnes Healthcare,
Inc. ("St. Agnes"), Neurosurgery Associates, Inc., and Neurosurgery
Services, LLC. The Complaint alleges that Defendants failed to obtain
informed consent.

Mr. Robertson is a citizen of the State of Virginia, and Dr. Juliano is
a citizen of the State of Washington. St. Agnes, Neurosurgery Associates,
Inc., and Neurosurgery Services, LLC are Maryland entities with their
principal places of business in Maryland.

Before any of the Defendants were served, Dr. Iuliano filed a Notice of
Removal. The Notice of Removal failed to identify the date upon which the Dr.
Iuliano first acquired a copy of the Complaint. The stated basis for removal is the
diversity of citizenship between Mr. Robertson and Defendants under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71332.
Dr. Iuliano argues that 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) does not preclude removal because the
citizenship of Maryland Defendants is not to be considered because none of them have
been served. Notwithstanding the lack of service on the Maryland Defendants, 28

U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) precludes removal.

ARGUMENT

A. Removal is Improper Because Three of the Four Defendants are Forum
Defendants

1. Standard of Review
The U.S. Supreme Court has noted that removal is disfavored and that Congress
intended to limit instances of removal from state to federal courts.! The Fourth Circuit
has long held that. any doubts in removal jurisdiction should be decided in favor of
retained state jurisdiction. The burden of establishing federal jurisdiction is placed
upon the party seeking removal." "Because removal jurisdiction raises significant
federalism concerns, we must strictly construe removal jurisdiction."* Doubts
regarding removal are to be resolved in favor of remand to the state court.*
2. Diversity Jurisdiction
Removal of an action from state court to Federal District Court pursuant to 28
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1441(a) is appropriate only when the Federal Court has original jurisdiction.0x00B0
Federal District Courts have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the action is
between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.0x00B0 In
diversity cases, the "forum defendant rule" - imposes an additional requirement.' It
provides that a case can be removed on the basis of diversity jurisdiction "only if none of

the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in

 

' American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U.S. 6, 10, 71 8. Ct. 534, 95 L. Ed. 702 (1951) (noting that
an "important [Congressional] purpose [of the 1948 revision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]
was to limit removal from state courts").

which such action is brought."(R)

Diversity jurisdiction is designed to protect out-of-state defendants from local bias."
In cases involving multiple defendants where at least one is a citizen of the forum state, the
forum defendant rule precludes removal because the likelihood of local bias against all

defendants is too remote to warrant removal.'0x00B0

3. The Forum Defendant Rule
28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) states:
An civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded
on a claim or filing arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the
United States shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence
of the parties. Any other such action shall be removable only if none of the
parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the
State in which such action is brought.
Federal district courts are divided on whether a defendant can avoid the forum-defendant
rule by monitoring state court dockets and removing the case before the plaintiff can obtain

service on any of the forum defendants. Some cases have held that the plain language

allows defendants to remove where the forum defendants have not been served.'! But the

 

Id. See e.g., Lively v. Wild Oats Markets., Inc., 456 F.3d 933, 939 (9th Cir. 2006).

0x00B0 McSparran v. Weist, 402 F.2d 867, 876 (3d Cir. 1968); S. Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1958
U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 3099, 3102 (the "purpose of diversity of citizenship legislation . . . is to provide a
separate forum for out-of-state citizens against the prejudices of local courts and local juries by making available to
them the benefits and safeguards of the federal courts").

10x00B0 See Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 106 F.3d 494, 499 (3d Cir. 1997) (insofar as
"diversity jurisdiction exists because of a fear that the state tribunal would be prejudiced towards the out-of-state
plaintiff or defendant, that concern is understandably allayed when that party is joined with a citizen from the forum-
state").

Inc., 184 F. Supp.2d 826, 828 (S.D. Ind. 2002), Clawson v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 451 F. Supp.2d
731, 736 (D.Md. 2006). Dr. Iuliano cites to McCall v. Scott, 239 F.3d 808 (6th Cir. 2001) to support its position.
The court's pronouncements, however, were dictum as the court held that the issue had been waived.

Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document 13 Filed 06/23/10 Page 8 of 17

better reasoned line of cases precludes such avoidance because it runs counter to

Congressional intent and the policy underlying federal diversity jurisdiction."

a. The Plain Language
Dr. Iuliano has stated in his Notice of Removal that "the alleged in-forum status of
unserved Defendants is immaterial to the propriety of removal." The argument states that
the plain language of the defendant forum rule requires exclusion of all defendants who
have not been "properly joined and served." Application of this principal, although neat,

results in outcomes counter to the purpose of the rule.
b. Congressional Intent

"Congress intended the ` joined and served' part of the forum defendant rule to
prevent gamesmanship by plaintiffs, who might name an in-state defendant against whom
he or she does not have a valid claim in a complaint filed in state court to defeat otherwise
permissible removal by the non-forum defendant(s)."'* In Ethington, on Friday, December
14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed an action in the superior court of New Jersey alleging state law
claims. They provided a courtesy copy of the complaint to the defendants the same day. On
December 17, 2007, the next business day, certain New Jersey corporate defendants,
removed the case to the Federal District Court of New Jersey. Service of process could not
have occurred due to the rules of the State of New Jersey. The clerk of the Superior Court

was required to forward a tracking number related to the case within 10 days after filing of

v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. 575 F .Supp.2d 640 (D.N.J. 2008); Oliver v. American Motors Corp., 616

Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document 13 Filed 06/23/10 Page 9 of 17

the complaint. Service of process could occur until the tracking number was received. The
New Jersey defendants argued that removal was proper under the plain reading of the
statute because no forum resident defendant had been properly joined or served. The Court

disagreed.

The tactics employed by defendants such as in the instant case turns Congressional
intent on its head by allowing defendants to employ gamesmanship, specifically by
rushing to remove a newly filed court case before the plaintiff can perfect on
anyone. Given that Congress intended the "properly joined and served" language to
prevent litigant gamesmanship, "it would be absurd to interpret the same `joined and
served' requirement to actually condone a similar kid of gamesmanship from
defendants" in instances such as the case at bar.'*

* OH

The approach advocated by the GE Defendants would, in addition to eviscerating
the forum defendant rule, likewise eviscerates a plaintiff's well-established right to
choice of forum, by essentially precluding a plaintiff from ever being able to litigate
a case in the defendants' own home state courts if the defendants are sophisticated
litigants.'

c. Application of the Plain Meaning May Lead to Absurd Results

Pursuant to the argument that the plain meaning of the forum defendant rule
precludes consideration of unserved forum defendants' citizenship, a forum defendant sued
by an out-of-state plaintiff could remove a case to Federal Court provided that such
defendant does so prior to being "properly joined and served." Such a result is at odds with

the purpose behind diversity jurisdiction.

not possibly have anticipated the tremendous loophole that would one day manifest from technology enabling forum
defendants to circumvent the forum defendant mule by, inter alia, electronically monitoring state court dockets.

The goal of statutory construction is to actualize legislative intent.'0x00B0 Usually, the
best indication of the drafters' intent is the statute's plain language. However, the approach
should not be followed if it leads to a result that is plainly contrary to the intent of the
drafters. As stated in Sullivan, a literal application of 0x00A71441(b) would allow defendants to
always avoid the imposition of the forum defendant rule as long as they are monitoring
state dockets and avoiding service. (citations omitted).'' The Court in Sullivan also noted
that "the growing trend among district courts wrestling with this latest ligation fad is to

grant a timely motion to remand."'(R)

This Court has wrestled with the issue previously. Judge Davis, formerly of this
Court, refused to apply the plain language application.'" In Oxendine, the non-forum
defendant removed the case before the Maryland defendants had been served. The Court
determined that complete diversity was present. The Court held that the forum defendant

rule precluded removal.

Under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1441(b), the presence of "properly joined and served" defendants
that are citizens of the forum state defeats the right of removal on the basis of
diversity of citizenship. To be sure, there is a line of cases which holds that if the in-
state defendants had not been served at the time of removal, an out-of-state
defendant may remove where, as here, there is complete diversity. See Wensil v. EI.
Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 792 F.Supp. 447, 448 (D.S.C.1992); McCall v. Scott,
239 F.3d 808, 813 n. 2 (6th Cir.2001); In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 184
F.Supp.2d 826, 828 (S.D.Ind.2002). Nevertheless, I am persuaded to adhere to the
tule followed by the majority of courts that have rejected this interpretation of 0x00A7
1441(b).

Section 1441(b) provides that an action based on Section 1441(b) provides that an
action based on diversity "shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest
properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such
