DEFENDANT ST. AGNES HEALTHCARE, INC.'S
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO REMAND

Defendant St. Agnes HealthCare, Inc., by its attorneys, Craig B. Merkle , Shannon Madden
Marshall and Goodell, DeVries, Leech & Dann, LLP, hereby submits this Opposition to Plaintiffs
Motion to Remand, and in support hereof, states:

1, There is no dispute that the propriety of the removal by Defendant Brian Iuliano,

M.D., a resident of Washington, is governed by 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b).

2. There is no dispute that the plain language of 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) clearly permits
removal where there is complete diversity between the parties and there has been
no service on any forum Defendant(s) at the time of removal by a non-resident
Defendant.

3. There is no dispute that there is complete diversity in this case, and that no forum
Defendant had been served at the time of removal by Dr. Iuliano, a non-resident

Defendant.
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document15 Filed 07/12/10 Page 2 of 13

4. Accordingly, applying the unambiguous statutory text of 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b),
removal is proper and Plaintiff's Motion to Remand should be denied.

5. There is no valid basis here for application of the rarely-invoked "bizarre" or
"absurd" results doctrine so as to alter the clear meaning of the statute.

6. There is no reason for this Court to look behind the statute's plain meaning and
attempt to divine legislative intent or policy concerns inherent in the drafting of
28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b); the unambiguous statutory language is the beginning and the
end of judicial inquiry.

7. In further support hereof, see the attached Memorandum of Law in Support of this
Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Remand and the authorities cited
therein.

WHEREFORE, for these reasons and those set forth more fully in St. Agnes Health Care, Inc.'s
attached Memorandum of Law in Support of its Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Remand, this
Defendant respectfully requests that Plaintiffs Motion to Remand be DENIED.

Respectfully submitted,

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT
OF ST. AGNES HEALTHCARE, INC.'S
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO REMAND

Defendant St. Agnes HealthCare, Inc., by its attorneys, Craig B. Merkle , Shannon Madden
Marshall and Goodell, DeVries, Leech & Dann, LLP, hereby submits this Memorandum of Law in
Support of its Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Remand.

Preliminarily, Co-Defendant Brian Juliano, M.D. has recently filed an Opposition to Plaintiff's
Motion to Remand, and an accompanying Memorandum of Law in Support, setting forth the factual
summary and procedural history of this matter to date. Accordingly, this Defendant will not herein
reiterate the background factual and procedural details for this Court. Rather, this Defendant will defer
to the factual and procedural background set forth in Dr. Iuliano's Memorandum of Law.

I. Argument

In support of its Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Remand, Defendant St. Agnes HealthCare,

Inc. submits the following:
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document15_ Filed 07/12/10 Page 6 of 13

A) Section 1441(b) is clear and unambiguous; as such, this Court need look no further than
the statute to determine that removal is proper here.

In a civil action based on federal diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71441(b) provides that such
actions "shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as
defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought." Plaintiff here does not dispute that
there is complete diversity of citizenship between the parties; Mr. Robertson resides in Virginia, Dr.
Tuliano resides in the Washington, and no corporate Defendant resides in Virginia. Plaintiffs Motion to
Remand at 2. Plaintiff further concedes that no forum Defendants had been served at the time of
removal. Jd. Indeed, Plaintiff acknowledges that 0x00A71441(b) applies to this case. Plaintiff's
Memorandum in Support of his Motion to Remand at 2 (curiously claiming that 0x00A71441(b) "precludes
removal.") Thus, there is no debate about the applicability of 0x00A71441(b) to this dispute.

Even further, Plaintiff makes no claim that the relevant statutory language is misleading or
ambiguous. He offers no authority concluding that there is any such ambiguity. Rather, Plaintiff
concedes, if indirectly, that the plain language of 1441(b) would allow for removal here. See, e.g.,
Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of his Motion to Remand at 8, section d. (arguing "Application of
Plain Language Not Applicable..."). Accordingly, the instant dispute is straightforward -- whether a
plain and unambiguous statute should apply as it is written. Under basic tenets of statutory construction,
it must be so.

The first inquiry in statutory interpretation is to assess whether the language is plain and
unambiguous. United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 4, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997). When
the statutory text is unambiguous - as it is here - a court "must apply the statute according to its terms."
Carcieri v. Salazar, 129 S. Ct. 1058, 1063-1064, 172 L. Ed. 2d 791 (2009) (citing Dodd v. United States,

545 U.S. 353, 359, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U.S.
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document15_ Filed 07/12/10 Page 7 of 13

526, 534, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004); Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters
Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6, 120 S.Ct. 1942, 147 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000); Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S.
470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917)). The Supreme Court has specifically cautioned that the
courts are not vested with discretion to alter an otherwise clear statute: "We have stated time and again
that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it
says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial
inquiry is complete." Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., Inc., 534 U.S. 438, 461-462, 122 S. Ct. 941, 956,
151 L. Ed. 2d 908 (2002) (citing Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254, 112 S.Ct.
1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (quoting Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66
L.Ed.2d 633 (1981)) (citations omitted). The Barnhart Court further explained that when statutory
language is clear, no further "canon or interpretive tool" is necessary. Barnhart, supra, 534 U.S. at 461.
For a plain and unambiguous statute, "we will not alter the [statutory] text" in favor of "policy
preferences." Id. at 462.

Here, there is no dispute that, applying the plain statute to the instant facts, removal is proper
under 0x00A71441(b). As such, this Court need not consider legislative history or intent, or minority decisions
from courts that strayed from elementary rules of statutory construction. Rather, as Plaintiff does not
contest the applicability and the plain meaning of 0x00A71441(b), "judicial inquiry is complete," and removal
is proper.

Despite Plaintiff's claim that courts are "split" over the propriety of removal in these cases, a
vast majority of courts apply the plain statutory meaning and concur that removal is proper: See, e.g.,
Stewart v. Auguillard Const. Co., Case No. 09-6455, 2009 WL 5175217 (E.D.La. Dec. 18, 2009);

No. 06-6280, 2007 WL 1521138 (D.N.J. May 22, 2007); Clawson v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc.,
451 F.Supp.2d 731 (D.Md.2006); Ozt v. Consol. Freightways Corp. of Del., 213 F.Supp.2d 662
(S.D.Miss.2002); Mask v. Chrysler Corp., 825 F.Supp. 285 (N.D.Ala.1993); Wensil v. EI. DuPont De
Nemours and Co., 792 F.Supp. 447 (D.S8.C.1992); Republic Western Ins. Co. v. Int'l Ins. Co., 765
F.Supp. 628 (N.D.Cal.1991); Windac Corp. v. Clarke, 530 F.Supp. 812 (D.Neb.1982); see also 14B
Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure 0x00A7 3723 at 624 (3d ed. 1998). These cases
collectively illustrate that the plain statutory language is most often deemed controlling, and that it
permits removal in these circumstances.

Further, Plaintiff's proposed statutory interpretation would improperly omit the `"`and served"
language inserted by Congress. It is axiomatic to statutory construction that one cannot selectively
ignore words in a statute. Rather, "[i]n construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to
every word Congress used." Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d
931 (1979); see also 2A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction 0x00A746:6 (70x2122 ed.) ("No clause,
sentence or word shall be construed as superfluous, void or insignificant if a construction can be found
which will give force to and preserve all the words of a statute.") Plaintiff's proposed interpretation of
the statute violates this basic statutory construction principle, and thus should not be adopted by this

Court.
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document15_ Filed 07/12/10 Page 9 of 13

B. Plaintiff cannot trump the plain meaning of 1441(b) by invoking the "bizarre" or
"absurd" result doctrines, legislative history or Congressional intent.

Because the plain meaning of the statute is against him, Plaintiff urges this Court to ignore
Congress's chosen text, and to deem it "absurd" or "bizarre." Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of his
Motion to Remand at pp. 6-8. However, it is rare that an allegedly "absurd" or "bizarre" result will bar
application of unambiguous statutory language, again because deference must be given to the plain
statutory text. See Hutchins v. Bayer Corp., 2009 WL 192468 (D.Del.2009) at 6; (citing 2A Sutherland
Statutes and Statutory Construction 0x00A7 46:7 (7" Ed.) (""[T]he absurd results doctrine should be used
sparingly because judicial speculation that the legislature could not have meant what it unmistakably
_ said risks corrupting the separation of powers doctrine.'") As the Hutchins Court found, even if
permitting removal before service on a forum defendant may be perceived as "unseemly," it does not
approach the level of "absurd" or "bizarre." Jd. See also Vitatoe v. Mylan Pharm., Inc., Case No. 08-
CV-85, 2008 WL 3540462 (N.D.W.Va. Aug. 13, 2008) at 6 ("No absurd result or `procedural trap' is
produced by applying a literal application of the statute."); Waldon v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., Case No.
07-01988, 2007 WL 1747128 (N.D.Cal. June 18, 2007) at 3 (finding "no compelling reason to depart
from the plain text of section 1441(b)").. Plaintiff here offers no compelling basis for the judicial
activism he seeks.

Although examination of Congressional intent and legislative history is not warranted here, if it
were, it would by no means necessarily favor remand. Plaintiff asserts that by restricting removal to
`Joined and served" defendants, Congress has unwittingly created an unintended "loophole" for
removal. Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of his Motion to Remand at 6, fn. 15. Yet Plaintiff fails to
consider that the "properly joined and served" language in Section 1441(b) was first adopted in 1948.

See Hutchins v. Bayer Corp., 2009 WL 192468 (D.Del.2009) at 9 (examining statutory history and
Case 1:10-cv-01319-RDB Document15_ Filed 07/12/10 Page 10 of 13

concluding that in the absence of Congressional action to revise the statute, it must be interpreted
pursuant to its plain meaning). Despite subsequent statutory revisions, this so-called "loophole" has yet
to be "closed" by Congress. Thus, even assuming arguendo that legislative history and intent were
appropriate areas of judicial inquiry here, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended what it
wrote, and that the plentiful decisions upholding removal over the last decade were not undesired
consequences of an unintended "loophole." As the Supreme Court has explained, it is only "the rare
cases [in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the
intentions of its drafters." United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S.Ct. 1026,
103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989). In any case, it is not for the judiciary to correct a supposed legislative
"loophole." See Carreon v. Alza Corp., 2010 WL 539392 (N.D.Cal.) (addressing 1441(b), and
concluding that "nothing precludes Congress from amending the statute if a significant problem has now
actually arisen; indeed, that is the essence of the legislative function.") Further, contrary to Plaintiff's
position, the plain application of 0x00A71441(b) permitting removal has been interpreted to align with
Congressional intent. See Hutchins v. Bayer Corp., 2009 WL 192468 (D.Del.2009) at 7 (finding that
removal in accordance with the plain statutory language "does not conflict with Congressional intent.")
Thus, though the plain meaning analysis obviates the need to consider legislative history and intent,
even these factors do not weigh in favor of remand.
II. Conclusion

Plaintiff asks this Court to reject the express language that Congress enacted into law 62 years
ago and, instead, to substitute its own policy preferences using the purported legislative history as a
cover. As demonstrated above, many other federal judges faced with this precise issue have ruled that

an unambiguous law that has been in force for decades cannot be disregarded based on a personal view
