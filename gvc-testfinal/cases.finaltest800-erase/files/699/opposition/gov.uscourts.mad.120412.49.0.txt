UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
NOROTOS, INC.,
Plaintiff,
v.

Civil Action No: 09-CV-10215-NG

OPS-CORE, INC.,
Defendant.
DEFENDANT OPS-CORE, INC.’S OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Ops-Core, Inc. (“Ops-Core”) submits the following memorandum in
opposition to plaintiff Norotos, Inc.’s (“Norotos”) motion for summary judgment of infringement
of claim 22 of United States Patent No. 6,751,810 (the “’810 Patent”). As discussed below,
Norotos’s motion should be denied because claim 22 cannot be construed to cover an assembly
of the VAS Shroud manufactured by Ops-Core with a helmet mount. Moreover, because all
asserted claims of both the ’810 Patent and United States Patent No. 6,938,276 (the “’276
Patent”) contain the same limitations as claim 22, Ops-Core’s motion for summary judgment of
non-infringement as to all claims should be granted.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The facts material to the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment are largely
undisputed. Claim 22, like all other asserted claims of both the ’810 and ’276 Patents, requires,
among other elements, “a shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an insert, a lock and a
release mechanism . . . wherein the external surface is smooth with rounded edges and corners at
the periphery, such that the shell has no projections on which a shroud line may catch and is

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 2 of 23

shaped to match the contour of the headgear; wherein the insert is adapted to receive a lock
plate[.]”
It is undisputed that Ops-Core’s accused product, the VAS Shroud, does not include a
lock or a release mechanism. Norotos’s motion, therefore, relies solely on the argument that an
assembly of the VAS Shroud with a helmet mount infringes claim 22. See Plaintiff’s
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of its Motion for Partial Summary
Adjudication of Infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,751,810 (“Norotos Motion”) at 4. Such an
assembly, however, fails to meet all the limitations of the claim. Accordingly, Norotos’s motion
for summary judgment should be denied and Ops-Core’s motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of all asserted claims should be granted.
ARGUMENT
As discussed below and in Ops-Core’s motion for summary judgment, an assembly of the
VAS Shroud and a helmet mount cannot infringe claim 22 because (1) the claim requires that the
shell, insert, lock and release mechanism all be located on a single structure, a “shroud plate,”
and that structure cannot include a mount arm; (2) the accused assembly would not meet all the
limitations of claim 22 because (a) it would not be “smooth” with “no projections on which a
shroud line may catch” and (b) it would lack an insert “adapted to receive a lock plate”; and (3)
the assembly of a helmet mount to the VAS Shroud is supported by prior art which Norotos has
differentiated from the ’810 Patent in reexamination arguments.
I. Claim 22 Should Be Construed to Require That the Shell, Insert, Lock and
Release Mechanism Be Located on a Single Structure That Does Not Include a
Mount Arm
In order to decide the infringement issues presented by the parties’ cross-motions for
summary judgment, the Court must first construe the disputed claim terms. See, e.g., Freedman

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 3 of 23

Seating Co. v. Amer. Seating Co., 420 F.3d 1350, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Ops-Core requests
that the Court construe the disputed terms of claim 22 as follows:
Claim Term

Proposed Construction

Shroud plate

A comparatively flat structure, thinner than it is
wide or long, that may be composed of one or
more integrally related pieces, but that does not
include an arm-shaped structure

Comprising

Including or containing

Insert

A part or component of a shroud plate that
permits insertion of a lock plate

Lock

A mechanism that locks the shroud plate to a
helmet mount, and that is located on the shroud
plate and not on the helmet mount

Release mechanism

A mechanism that releases the lock attaching
the shroud plate to a helmet mount, and that is
located on the shroud plate and not on the
helmet mount

Smooth with rounded edges and corners at the
periphery, such that the shell has no
projections on which a shroud line may catch

Having no sharp edges or projections such as
hook-shaped portions

Adapted to receive a lock plate

Capable of receiving a lock plate, without any
other structure precluding insertion of the lock
plate

Ops-Core’s proposed constructions are supported by the ordinary meanings of the claim
terms, the specification and prosecution history, as discussed below.1
A.

“Shroud Plate”

The term “plate” has consistently been construed to mean a flat, comparatively thin piece
of material, of more or less uniform thickness. See, e.g., Leoutsakos v. Coll’s Hosp. Pharmacy,

1

The remaining terms of claim 22 either are not disputed for purposes of the summary judgment motions or require
no construction.

Inc., 95 Fed. Appx. 835, 2004 WL 1010162, *3 (Fed. Cir. May 4. 2004) (noting dictionary
definition of “plate” as “a perfectly flat sheet of material of uniform thickness throughout” and
finding that claim limitation “planar plate member” did not cover a “largely open frame
comprised of cylindrical tubes”); Neles-Jamesbury, Inc. v. Fisher Controls Int’l, Inc., 989 F.
Supp. 393, 397 (D. Mass. 1998) (noting that “[t]he ordinary meaning of the term ‘plate’ is a
structure that is thinner than it is wide or long and that is generally flat and solid” and construing
term in patent at issue to mean “a structure that is thinner than it is wide or long and that may be
flat, curved or twisted and perforated such as a screen or net but that is not a tube”); Briggs &
Riley Travelware, LLC v. Paragon Luggage, Inc., No. 01-3448, 2002 WL 3181, *3 (S.D.N.Y.
December 13, 2002) (noting dictionary definition of “plate” as a “flat, comparatively thin,
usually rigid sheet, slice, leaf, or lamina of metal or other substance, of more or less uniform
thickness and even surface”).
Accordingly, the term “shroud plate” should be construed to mean a comparatively flat
structure, thinner than it is wide or long. While such a structure may, for example, be curved to
fit the shape of a helmet or other headgear and may have holes or perforations (see NelesJamesbury, Inc., 989 F. Supp. at 397), it cannot include an arm-shaped structure such as a helmet
mount.
B.

“Comprising”

The term “comprising” is a term of art in the patent context, and is generally construed to
mean “including” or “containing.” See, e.g., Amgen, Inc. v. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., 494 F. Supp.
2d 54, 68-69 (D. Mass. 2007); Orion IP, LLC v. Xerox Corp., No. 607-138, 2008 WL 3914891,
*6 (E.D. Tex. August 21, 2008) (citing D. Chisum, CHISUM ON PATENTS §8.06[1][b][ii][A]).

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 5 of 23

The shroud plate must therefore “comprise,” i.e. contain or include, the shell, insert, lock and
release mechanism.
Moreover, the limitation of “a shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an insert, a
lock and a release mechanism” requires that the shroud plate comprise, i.e. contain or include,
those four elements simultaneously. An infringing device must fulfill all requirements of claim
22 at a point in time when it comprises all four elements, not as separate assemblies fulfilling
some requirements in one configuration and other requirements in another.
C.

“Insert”

This term should be construed to mean a part or component of a shroud plate that permits
insertion of a lock plate. The specification states that “[t]he insert is designed as a bay for a lock
plate or adapter plate.” See ’810 Patent col. 3 ll. 17-19. The “shroud plate” must include an area
(“insert”) able to receive a lock plate.
D.

“Lock”

This term should be construed to mean a mechanism that locks the shroud plate to a
helmet mount, and that is located on the shroud plate and not on the helmet mount. Norotos
argues that “whether the ‘lock’ and ‘release mechanism’ elements are located with the ‘insert’ or
located with the ‘lock plate’ makes no difference in the engagement.” See Norotos’s Opposition
to Ops-Core’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 38) at 17. While this may be true
mechanically, Norotos’s suggested alternate embodiment, in which the lock is part of the lock
plate, is not covered by claim 22. Consistent with the claim language and written description, all
of the patent drawings show a shroud plate consisting of a single structure, with an insert at the
center and a lock and release mechanism or button located at the top and bottom of the shell, as
in Figure 2 of the ’810 Patent.

5

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 6 of 23

As explained in the specification, the embodiment
shown in Figure 2 (at right) includes a shroud plate (10) that

Shroud plate
(10) from FIG.
2 of ‘810 patent

comprises a shell (13), an insert (16), a lock (18) and a
release mechanism or release button (26). See ’810 Patent
col. 2 ll. 30-36, col. 3 ll.15-16, 37-56. Note that the “shroud
plate” (10) is a different entity from the lock plate (17). The
other drawings likewise show the insert, lock and release
mechanism as located on the shroud plate and not on a

Lock plate (17)
from FIG. 9 of

detachable mount arm or other device. In fact, there is
nothing in the specification to support the construction of any
of the claims to cover an embodiment where the lock is part
of the lock plate (17) instead of the shroud plate (10), or to convey to a person of ordinary skill in
the art that the inventor of the ’810 Patent had possession of such an embodiment of the
invention. If Norotos’s proposed construction were accepted, claim 22 would fail to meet the
written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. section 112 and 37 CFR 1.75(d)(1)2 and would be
invalid. See ICU Med. Sys., Inc. v. Alaris Med. Sys., Inc., 558 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir.
2009); Lizardtech, Inc. v. Earth Resource Mapping, Inc., 424 F.3d 1336, 1344-45 (Fed. Cir.

“The claim or claims must conform to the invention as set forth in the remainder of the specification and the terms
and phrases used in the claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the description so that the meaning of
the terms in the claims may be ascertainable by reference to the description.” 37 CFR 1.75(d)(1).

To the extent that claims are ambiguous, they should be construed to preserve validity if possible. See ACS Hosp.

“Release mechanism”

This term should be construed to mean a mechanism that releases the lock attaching the
shroud plate to a helmet mount, and that is located on the shroud plate and not on the helmet
mount. The arguments made by Norotos and accepted by the examiner during reexamination
narrow the claim to require that the lock and release mechanism be located on the same structure
as the shell, not on an attached mount arm.
During reexamination of the ’810 Patent, Norotos sought to distinguish its invention over
the prior art cited by Ops-Core, including the US HMA Operator’s Manual. See generally
Declaration of Thomas J. Daly in support of Norotos’s motion for summary judgment (Docket
No. 42) (“Daly Dec.”), Exhibit J. The Operator’s Manual discloses a helmet mounting bracket
that does not incorporate a lock or release mechanism, but instead has an opening for insertion of
a helmet mount that includes these elements, as in the drawing below:

See Daly Dec., Exhibit F at 29.

7

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 8 of 23

In response to the examiner’s initial rejection of all claims of the ’810 Patent, Norotos
modified claim 1 and argued that it was patentable over the US HMA Operator’s Manual
because it required the release button to be located on the bottom edge of the shell:
[H]aving the release button on the bottom edge allows the lock to
be located on the top edge of the insert. As such, to mount a lock to
the shroud plate, a user can insert a lower portion of the lock plate
into the lower edge of the insert using a relatively small force and
then snap the upper portion of the lock plate against the lock to
attach the lock plate to the shroud plate using a relatively large
force. Since the user uses the larger force to snap the top portion of
the lock plate into the shroud plate in a motion away from the
user’s face, the user is less likely to smash the night vision goggles
attached to the lock plate into his or her face if the lock plate does
not engage the insert than if the lock were located on the bottom
edge of the insert instead of the release button requiring a large
force toward the user’s face to snap the lock plate into the insert.
See Daly Dec., Exhibit J (November 18, 2009 Amendment) at 12 (emphasis in original).
The examiner accepted these arguments in allowing the amended claims:
The patent owner argued that having a release button centrally
located along the bottom edge of the shell is not an obvious design
choice because such location of the release button allows the
release button to be protected by the structure of the mount and/or
by the night vision goggles themselves from accidental
disengagement.
See Daly Dec., Exhibit K (March 8, 2010 office action) at 12 (emphasis added).
Statements made by a patent owner to distinguish prior art during reexamination, like
statements made during the original prosecution, may narrow the scope of a claim. See Spectrum
Int’l, Inc. v. Sterilite Corp., 164 F.3d 1372, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (affirming summary
judgment of non-infringement where patent owner’s proposed claim construction had been
disclaimed during reexamination). Because Norotos was able to distinguish its invention over the
US HMA Operator’s Manual only by arguing that the release mechanism was located on the

8

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 9 of 23

bottom edge of the shell, Norotos relinquished any possible interpretation of the claims to allow
this element to be located on a separate device. See Spectrum Int’l, Inc., 164 F.3d at 1379.4
If claim 22 were construed to cover an assembly of a shell or plate (such as the VAS
Shroud) with a helmet mount that contained the lock and release mechanism, the claim would be
anticipated by the US HMA Operator’s Manual, which discloses just such an assembly. Even if
the plain meaning of the claim language and specification did not clearly require a single
structure, any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of an interpretation that preserves the
validity of the claim. See ACS Hosp. Sys., Inc., 732 F.2d 1572, 2577 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
F.

“Smooth with rounded edges and corners at the periphery, such that
the shell has no projections on which a shroud line may catch”

In rejecting the original claims of the ’810 patent, the examiner cited as prior art the US
HMA Operator’s Manual, which discloses a helmet mounting bracket as shown in the diagram
below:

4

The USHMA Operator’s Manual and other prior art do not, as Norotos argues, support a broader construction of
claim 22 by showing that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have understood based on these references “that
the ordinary meaning of ‘lock’ would not require the lock be a unitary part of the shroud plate.” See Norotos Motion
at 8-9. Norotos points to nothing in any of these references to suggest that “lock” had a special meaning in the
relevant art at the time of the invention. Moreover, Norotos’s reliance on Texas Digital Systems, Inc. v. Telegenics,
Inc., 308 F.3d 1193, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 2002) for the proposition that “a court will give a claim term the full range of its
ordinary meaning as understood by persons skilled in the relevant art” (Norotos Motion at 8) is misplaced. See
Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1320 (finding that Texas Digital’s approach “improperly restricts the role of the specification in
claim construction”).

9

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 10 of 23

In finding the claims anticipated by the prior art, the examiner stated:
Since the claim does not specifically define a part/dimension of the
shell that is smoothed and it does not require the entire
outer/exterior surface of the shell to be smooth, but merely recites,
“the shell . . [.] has a smooth surface with rounded edges and
corners” . . . [t]herefore, the examiner defines a surface of the shell
as circled in the diagram #2 above as the smooth surface as
claimed. This surface portion of the shell is clearly a smooth
surface with rounded edges and corners and without any
projection.
See Daly Dec., Exhibit K (March 8, 2010 office action) at 9, 11 (emphasis in original).
A smooth surface with rounded edges was, therefore, not sufficient to differentiate the
invention of the ’810 patent from the prior art. To overcome the prior art, Norotos proposed new
claims 21 and 22 with additional wording to differentiate them from the prior art cited for the
rejection of claim 1:
. . . wherein the shell extends around at least a portion of the insert
and has an external surface that faces away from the headgear
when the shroud plate is attached to the headgear, a back surface
that faces toward the headgear when the shroud plate is attached to
the headgear and a periphery; wherein the external surface is
smooth with rounded edges and corners at the periphery, such that
the shell has no projections on which a shroud line may catch.
See Daly Dec., Exhibit J (November 18, 2009 Amendment) at 5 (emphasis added).
Norotos argued that amended claim 22 was patentable over the prior art, particularly the
US HMA Operator’s Manual, because “the shell has no
projections on which a shroud line may catch.” Id. at 13.
According to Norotos’s argument, to overcome the patent
examiner’s objections, the entire external surface must be
free of projections.

10

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 11 of 23

Norotos ignores this distinction when it argues that the VAS Shroud infringes Claim 22
in part because it “makes use of rounded edges and corners at the periphery” as demonstrated in
the photograph on the previous page. See Declaration of Jonathon R. Prendergast (Docket No.
45), ¶11 and Exhibit G. Only a few areas are shown with rounded edges and, most importantly,
the photograph shows only a portion of the accused assembly as it lacks a lock or release
mechanism. According to Norotos, the lock and release mechanism must be provided by
attaching a helmet mount that includes these elements. The helmet mount in the accused
assembly, however, cannot provide these elements because it has the “sharp edges and/or hookshaped portions” that would violate the claim limitations that there be “no projections on which a
shroud line may catch,” as shown in the photographs below:

“Adapted to receive a lock plate”

This term should be construed to mean that the insert is capable of receiving a lock plate,
and is not obstructed by a helmet mount or other structure. The plain meaning of the claim

11

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 12 of 23

language is supported by the specification of the ’810 Patent, which is “‘the single best guide to
the meaning of a disputed term.’” Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
(citing Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996) and Irdeto
Access, Inc. v. Echostar Satellite Corp., 383 F.3d 1295, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 1994)). The written
description reiterates that “[t]he present invention, therefore, provides for a shroud plate for
headgear comprising a shell, an insert, a lock, [and] a release mechanism wherein the shell
extends around at least a portion of the insert[.]” See ’810 Patent col. 2, ll. 1-4. The written
description further summarizes the invention as “a shroud plate to act as an interface between a
helmet mount and a helmet.” ’810 Patent col. 1, ll. 5-9, 59-61 (emphasis added). In order to act
as an “interface” between the helmet mount and the helmet, the shroud plate cannot include
either a helmet mount or a helmet. Similarly, the lock plate cannot be part of the “shroud plate”
because the “shroud plate” has an “insert” that is “adapted to receive a lock plate”. The simple
construction that follows from these relationships is shown below:

Shroud
Plate

Helmet

Helmet
Mount

The Shroud Plate is an interface between the Helmet and the Helmet Mount
Shroud

The Shroud Plate is adapted to receive the Lock Plate

Therefore the Shroud Plate receives the Lock Plate which is an essential part of

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 13 of 23

Accordingly, the helmet mount cannot be a part of the shroud plate of Claim 22. This,
however, is the basis of Norotos’s argument that the VAS Shroud, which has no lock or release
mechanism, infringes the claim. In order for the VAS Shroud to “comprise” a lock and release
mechanism, the term “shroud plate” would need to be construed to include a helmet mount of the
type disclosed in the US HMA Operator’s Manual. Such a helmet mount cannot, however,
provide the lock and release mechanism because the helmet mount cannot be part of the “shroud
plate”. In simple terms, the lock and release mechanism must be on the shroud plate without
involving the helmet mount because the shroud plate must still be able to receive the helmet
mount, as shown in the photographs below:

1. The Norotos “Shroud
Plate” of the ‘810 patent,
shown above, is able to
receive the lock plate of
the night vision Mount.
Because the “Shroud
Plate” has a lock and
release mechanism, the
Mount is greatly
simplified.

2. Ops-Core’s VAS Shroud
has no lock or release
mechanism so it cannot
receive or secure the lock
plate. It lacks two of the
required components and
cannot perform the
functions of the Norotos
“Shroud Plate” therefore it
cannot infringe.

See Rogers Dec., ¶¶4-6 and Exhibits 3-5.

13

3. Norotos argues that the
VAS Shroud becomes an
infringing assembly when
the HMA Helmet Mount is
attached as shown above.
Incorporating the Mount
however means that the
assembly cannot receive a
lock plate, a required
function of the shroud plate
in Claim 22.

There Is No Presumption Against Interpreting Claim 22 to Require a
Unitary Structure

In an effort to avoid the plain meaning of claim 22, Norotos argues that the claim should
be construed to allow the lock and release mechanism to be “separate components” because “[a]
device will not be limited to a single unitary body unless the patentee explicitly disavows a
multi-component device.” Norotos Motion at 8.
In support of this argument, Norotos cites two unreported cases from other jurisdictions,
neither of which even purports to stand for such a general principle of claim construction. In
Freni Brembo, S.p.A v. Alcon Components, Ltd., No. 04-5271, 2005 WL 1377858 (N.D. Ill. May
31, 2005), the court agreed with the plaintiff that the term “single part” meant “one piece” and
did not include assembled pieces. 2005 WL 1377858, **2-3. In Graco Children’s Products v.
Regalo International LLC, 2000 WL 1123260, **3-4 (E.D. Pa. August 8, 2000), the court
construed the claim limitation of a “unitary central hub member” to include a hinged structure
assembled from more than one component. The parties in that case did not, however, dispute that
the hub member could be more than one piece, only whether it could or could not fold. See 2000
WL 1123260, **3-4 (“Regalo contends that the ’437 Patent requires a unitary central hub
member that may be composed of several pieces but acts as one piece, or a unit, and does not
fold.”) (emphasis added). Norotos cites no authority suggesting that there is any general
presumption against construing claims to require a unitary structure; rather, this determination,
like other issues of claim construction, simply depends on the claim language and other intrinsic
evidence. As discussed above, the language of claim 22, read in light of the specification and
prosecution history, requires construction of the term “shroud plate” as a single structure
comprising a shell, insert, lock and release mechanism.

The Doctrine of Claim Differentiation Does Not Require Construction
of Claim 22 to Cover an Assembly of a Shroud and Helmet Mount

Finally, the doctrine of claim differentiation does not, as Norotos argues, require that
claim 22 be construed to cover an assembly of a shroud and helmet mount in order to
differentiate it from dependent claim 13. While claim differentiation generally prohibits reading
limitations from a dependent claim into an independent claim, so as to render the dependent
claim superfluous, the doctrine “cannot broaden claims beyond their original scope.” CurtissWright Flow Control Corp. v. Velan, Inc., 438 F.3d 1374, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2006). See ICU
Med. Sys., Inc., 558 F.3d at 1376 (claim differentiation is “not a rigid rule but rather is one of
several claim construction tools”); Bionx Implants, Inc. v. Innovasive Devices, Inc., 45 F. Supp.
2d 75, 78 (D. Mass. 1999) (Gertner, J.) (finding that defendant’s proposed construction of
asserted claim would not render second claim superfluous).
Claim 13 requires “[a] shroud plate according to claim 22 wherein the shell and the insert
comprise one piece.” See Norotos Motion at 7. Construing claim 22 to require a single structure
would not render claim 13 superfluous because the shell, insert, lock and release mechanism may
all be located on a single structure without the shell and insert being one piece. In the
embodiment of the invention manufactured by Norotos, for example, the insert, like the lock and
release button, is a separate piece that is permanently attached to and is integral with the shroud
plate:
Lock
Insert

Shell
Release
mechanism
15

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 16 of 23

See Rogers Dec., ¶9 and Exhibit 8.
The specification further explains that the insert may be incorporated into the shell in
several different ways, including but not limited to the shell and the insert being one piece:
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention further
comprises an aluminum insert or receiving plate 16. The insert 16
could also be made of titanium or other suitable materials. The
insert 16 is designed as a bay for a lock plate or adapter plate 17
(see Fig. 9) and functions as the interface between a helmet mount
and a helmet 12. The shroud plate 10 may comprise an insert 16
that is integral with a shell 13 essentially making the plate one
piece. The shroud plate 10 may comprise two integrally related
pieces, the shell 13 and the insert 16, to optimize weight and
durability. A lightweight shell minimizes the weight a user must
bear while a durable lock plate ensures a sturdy interface between
a helmet mount and a helmet. However, it is also possible that the
shroud plate 10 may be one piece made from one material, for
example all nylon or all aluminum.
’810 Patent col. 3 ll. 15-29 (emphasis added). The specification thus confirms that dependent
claim 13, in which the shell and insert comprise “one piece,” is narrower than independent claim
22, in which the shell and insert may comprise “two integrally related pieces.” Accordingly,
there is no need to broaden the scope of claim 22, as Norotos proposes, in order to differentiate it
from claim 13.
II. Even if a Single Structure Is Not Required, the Assembly of the VAS Shroud and
a Helmet Mount Does Not Infringe
Because claim 22 requires a shroud plate consisting of a single structure that includes a
shell, insert, lock and release mechanism, the VAS Shroud in combination with a helmet mount
does not infringe. Even if the claim were held to cover a combination of the VAS Shroud and a
helmet mount, however, such an assembly still would not infringe because it would not meet all
the claim limitations.

The Accused Assembly Is Not “Smooth” With “No Projections”

Claim 22 requires a shroud plate “wherein the external surface is smooth with rounded
edges and corners at the periphery, such that the shell has no projections on which a shroud line
may catch.” The specification emphasizes the absence of projections as a feature distinguishing
the invention from the prior art:
[P]revious helmet attachment mechanisms have comprised sharp
edges and/or hooked shaped portions which may interfere with or
even seriously injure a user. For instance, a hook portion may
catch the shroud line of an opening parachute, cutting the line or
violently jerking the user's head and neck.
’810 Patent, col. 1, ll. 39-44.
In the reexamination of the ’810 Patent, Norotos argued that amended claim 22 was
patentable over the prior art, particularly the US HMA Operator’s Manual, because of the
absence of projections:
[R]ather than having a smooth surface, the shroud plate taught by
the US HMA reference has projections, such as the “keepers”
projecting from a side edge of the shroud plate, that could snag a
shroud line and pose a serious safety threat to a user of the
mounting bracket. As such, the US HMA reference does not teach
a shell having “a smooth surface with rounded edges and corners at
the periphery, such that the shell has no projections on which a
shroud line may catch.”
See Daly Dec., Exhibit J (November 18, 2009 Amendment) at 13 (emphasis in original).
The examiner found this argument persuasive in distinguishing claim 22 over the prior
art:
Claims 21 and 22 are allowed because the art of record, considered
alone or in combination, neither anticipates nor renders obvious a
shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an insert, a lock and a
release mechanism, . . .wherein the external surface is smooth with
rounded edges and corners at the periphery, such that the shell has
no projections on which a shroud line may catch . . . .”
See Daly Dec., Exhibit K at 10 (emphasis in original).

When a helmet mount is attached to the shroud plate, the resulting assembly is no longer
“smooth with rounded edges and corners at the periphery, such that the shell has no projections
on which a shroud line may catch.” The assembly instead has the “sharp edges and/or hookshaped portions” that the specification describes as characteristic of the prior art, as shown in the
photograph below:

The Accused Assembly Does Not Include an Insert “Adapted to
Receive a Lock Plate”

The assembly of the VAS Shroud with a helmet

Shroud plate (10)

mount also fails to meet the limitation that the insert be
“adapted to receive a lock plate.” This limitation is
illustrated by Figures 2 and 9 of the patent at right, which
show the insert as integral with the shroud and capable of
receiving a separate lock plate.

When a helmet mount is attached to a shroud plate such as the VAS Shroud, however, the
resulting assembly no longer has an insert “adapted to receive a lock plate” because the mount
precludes a lock plate from being attached to the insert, as shown in the photograph below:

.

See Rogers Dec., ¶8 and Exhibit 7.
Therefore, even if claim 22 could hypothetically cover an assembly rather than a single
structure, it does not cover the accused assembly of the VAS Shroud with a helmet mount
because such an assembly lacks the required ability to receive a lock plate.
III. The assembly of a helmet mount to the VAS Shroud is supported by prior art
which Norotos has differentiated from the ’810 Patent in reexamination
arguments
Norotos claims that Ops-Core asserted conflicting interpretations of the claim language in
its successful effort to have the patents-in-suit reexamined. However, Ops-Core has been
consistent in arguing that an adapter plate such as the VAS Shroud mounted to a helmet to
facilitate the attachment of a mount for a night vision device is well known in the art and was
documented at least as early as the 1997 US HMA Operator’s Manual. When the Patent and
Trademark Office examined the additional prior art cited by Ops-Core, all of the original claims
of both the ’810 and the ’276 patent were rejected.

See Rogers Dec., ¶¶2-3 and Exhibits 1-2.
The examiner’s rejection of all claims based on the prior art confirms that the ’810 patent
cannot be construed to cover products with the same features as the prior art US HMA
Operator’s Manual. Norotos states that it was “ultimately able to overcome the anticipation
rejection of claim 1, but did so without amending the language cited above and without

20

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 49

Filed 11/24/10 Page 21 of 23

otherwise limiting the shroud plate to be only a monolithic piece.” However, Norotos was
required to amend claim 1 as follows:
A shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an insert, a lock
and a release [mechanism] button wherein the shell extends around
at least a portion of the insert and has a smooth surface with
rounded edges and corners and is shaped to match the contour of
the headgear, the insert is adapted to receive a lock plate; the lock
is adapted to secure the lock plate to the insert; [and] the release
[mechanism] button allows for removal of the lock plate from the
insert, and the release button is centrally located at a bottom edge
of the shell.
See Daly Dec., Exhibit L (April 26, 2010 Amendment) at 2 (emphasis in original).
It is clear from the statements made by the Examiner that the release mechanism was
understood to be a part of the shroud plate and that the critical location of the release button
relative to the “shell” (located along the bottom edge of the shell) provided unique and
unanticipated benefits. See Daly Dec., Exhibit K (March 8, 2010 Office Action) at 12.
With regard to Claim 22, the Examiner stated:
Patent owner further argued that the US HMA fails to disclose an
external surface of the shell is smooth with rounded edges and
corners at the periphery, such that the shell has no projection on
which a shroud line may catch because the shroud plate of US
HMA has projections, such as the “keepers” projecting from a side
edge of the shroud plate (see page 3, paragraph 2 of Remarks).
The Examiner agrees. Accordingly, claims 21 and 22 are found
allowable over US HMA and the other prior art of record.
See Daly Dec., Exhibit M at 2 (emphasis added).
The photographs below further demonstrate that the Vas Shroud is similar to the helmet
mounting bracket disclosed in the US HMA Operator’s Manual, which Norotos has argued is not
the same as the “shroud plate” of the ’810 patent.

Norotos amended its claims and overcame the examiner’s objections by differentiating
the invention of the ’810 Patent from the prior art. Because Norotos’s proposed construction of
claim 22 to cover the VAS Shroud would also cover the prior art, thus rendering the claims

22

invalid, the Court should reject that construction and should construe the claims as proposed by
Ops-Core.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Norotos’s motion for summary
judgment of infringement of Claim 22 of the ’810 Patent and should grant Ops-Core’s motion for
summary judgment of non-infringement of all asserted claims of both the ’810 and ‘276 Patents.
