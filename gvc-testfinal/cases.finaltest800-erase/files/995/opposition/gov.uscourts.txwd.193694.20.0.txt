2. Plaintiff sued defendants for breach of contract, tortious interference with an
existing contract, defamation, various violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
negligence in the hiring, training, supervision, and retention of certain employees, and

malice, in the 37" Judicial District of Bexar County, Texas.

3. Intervenor filed a motion to intervene on October 1, 2006.

B. Argument

4. Intervenor does not have the right to intervene in this lawsuit under Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) because he does not have an interest in the subject matter of
this suit. David v. Butts, 290 F.3d 1297, 1300 (1 1" Cir. 2002); In re Troutman Enters.,
Inc., 286 F.3d 359, 363 (6" Cir. 2002); Joe Doe No. 1 v. Glickman, 256 F.3d 371, 375
(5" Cir. 2001). This suit involves a private transaction that took place between only the
plaintiff and these defendants. It involves an apartment lease transaction and a credit

report transaction. The intervenor was not a party to whatever may have happened here.

C. Conclusion
5. This so-called intervention is stupid and pointless. The pleading is completely
unintelligible. It is also a waste of court resources. For these reasons, plaintiff asks the

court to deny intervenor's motion to intervene as a party-plaintiff.
