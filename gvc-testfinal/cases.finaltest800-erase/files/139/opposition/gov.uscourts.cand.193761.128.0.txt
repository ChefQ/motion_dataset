I. INTRODUCTION
By Order of July 7, 2008 (Docket 123), this Court granted the Spanos Defendants’ request to
notice a motion for reconsideration of this Court's Order (Docket 98) denying their motions to dismiss.
This Court further ordered that, pursuant to Local Rule 7-9(c), the motion for reconsideration be limited

24
25

to the issue of whether the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Garcia v. Brockway, 526 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2008)

26

(en banc) constitutes a change in the law such that this Court should reconsider that portion of its order

27

denying the Spanos Defendants' motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. As this Court

recognized, in denying Defendants’ motions to dismiss, the repeated breaches of the law alleged by
Plaintiffs constitute a continuing violation of the FHA that was ongoing at the time Plaintiffs filed their

3

Complaint. This holding, as will be shown, remains unaltered by the subsequent decision of the Ninth
4
5

Circuit in Garcia. Hence, this Court should not reconsider its holding that none of the claims of the

6

Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the Spanos Defendants are barred by the statute of

7

limitations. National Fair Housing Alliance, et al. v. A.G. Spanos Construction, Inc. et al., 542 F. Supp.

8

2d 1054 (N.D. Cal. 2008).

II. ARGUMENT

10
11
12
13

Defendants’ only basis for reconsideration is its bald claim that, in deciding Garcia, the Ninth
Circuit held the continuing violation doctrine, enunciated by the Supreme Court in Havens Realty Corp.
v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380-81, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), to be “inapplicable to [all]

14
15

‘design and construction’ claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).” Memorandum In Support of

16

Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (Dkt. 126) at 2. This is wholly unsupported by a fair reading of

17

Garcia.

18
19

In Garcia, the Ninth Circuit Court affirmed the validity of the continuing violation doctrine.
Quoting Havens, the Garcia majority said: “‘where a plaintiff, pursuant to the Fair Housing Act,

20
21

challenges not just one incident of conduct violative of the Act, but an unlawful practice that continues

22

into the limitations period, that complaint is timely when it is filed within [the statutory period running

23

from] the last asserted occurrence of that practice.’” (footnote omitted). Garcia v. Brockway, 526 F.3d

24

456, 461-62 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc). The Garcia majority went on to note that Congress subsequently

25
26

codified the Havens’ continuing violation doctrine by amending 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A) to include

27

both “the occurrence [and] the termination of an alleged ‘discriminatory practice’ as events triggering the

28

statute of limitations.” (emphasis added). Id. at 462.

Unlike Havens, however, the practice in each of the Garcia cases was an isolated one—“the
failure to ‘design and construct a multifamily dwelling according to FHA standards.” (footnote omitted).

3

(emphasis added). Id. at 461. Therefore, the Garcia majority said, the statute of limitations was
4
5

triggered at the conclusion of the design and construction phase of the single multi-family dwelling

6

involved, which was the date the last certificate of occupancy was issued; and, since in each case before

7

the Court the triggering event happened more than two years prior to plaintiffs bringing their lawsuits,

8

both lawsuits were barred. Id. According to the Ninth Circuit, plaintiffs simply failed to plead facts

9
10

sufficient to warrant the application of Havens' continuing violation doctrine. 526 F.3d at 460-62.

11

Nowhere does the Ninth Circuit categorically reject its use where discrimination in the design and

12

construction of multiple apartment complexes under § 3604(f)(3)(C) has been alleged, as is claimed by

13

the Spanos Defendants.

14
15

The practices pled by Plaintiffs here are exactly the type of conduct that the Ninth Circuit

16

recognized, in Garcia, as a legitimate continuing violation. Like Havens and unlike Garcia, the practices

17

pled by Plaintiffs are “‘based not solely on isolated incidents …, but a continuing violation manifested in a

18

number of incidents –including at least one that [was] asserted to have occurred within the [limitations]

19

period.’”

526 F.3d at 462 (footnote omitted). Plaintiffs' FAC alleges multiple violations of the FHA in

20
21

the design and construction of dwellings in approximately 82 apartment complexes including as many as

22

19 that were constructed within two years of the filing of this litigation. See FAC pp. 16-18. Thus, this

23

Court acknowledged that Plaintiffs’ claim “challenges not just one incident of conduct violative of the

24

Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period.” 542 F.Supp.2d at 1061.

25
26

The Spanos Defendants' request for reconsideration is no more than a rehash of a claim made in

27

their motions to dismiss that this is "really just a series of discrete, individual FHA violations and

28

therefore the statute of limitations begins to run at the completion of the construction of each complex."

Id. This court correctly rejected that argument, held that Havens applied to the facts of this case, and
said that Defendants have offered no "intelligible argument why the reasoning of Havens is not applicable

3

… ." Id. Even though Defendants may now rely upon Garcia, they still fail to provide an "intelligible
4
5

argument" why Garcia prevents Havens from applying here.
Defendants’ only new reasoning comes from its citation to the Ninth Circuit’s general concern for

6
7
8

designers and builders, who have sold off their inaccessible units, and who may have difficulty avoiding
liability in a private civil action by simply fixing the violation.1 526 F.3d at 461. Of course, this concern

9
10

is not relevant to those designers and builders who continue to have an ownership interest, as they may

11

avoid liability by bringing the units into compliance. Likewise, this concern is not relevant to those

12

designers and builders who, although no longer owners of the inaccessible units, sold the units to third

13

parties who are receptive to retrofitting their property.2 Even those designers and builders who

14
15

encounter non-cooperating current owners do not indefinitely face exposure to liability in a private civil

16

action. When Congress amended the FHA in 1988 it rewrote § 3613(a)(1)(A) so that the limitations

17

period begins “after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice”

18

(emphasis added). See also House Report No. 100-711, at 33, reprinted 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2179, 2194

19

(“[T]he statute of limitations is measured from the date of the last asserted occurrence of the unlawful

20
21
22

practice.”) (emphasis added). Thus, there is finality for these designers and builders two years after the
cessation of the unlawful practice of designing and/or building units that do not comply with §

23
24
25
26
27

As the Garcia, Court notes, the FHA does not provide for a statute of limitations for civil actions
brought by the Attorney General for equitable relief. 526 F.3d at 460.
2
It simply does not follow that new owners will consistently resist making their property accessible to
and usable by a wider population. As this court recognized, the remediation work can be timed as to
minimize inconvenience to their renters, such as between tenancies. 542 F. Supp. 2d at 1067. Of course
here the Spanos defendants are not required to repurchase inaccessible buildings in order to make the

3604(f)(3)(C). This is the same exposure to liability in a private civil action that is faced by those who
engage in other forms of housing discrimination, such as discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

3

For all such repeat offenders, the statute of limitations is measured from the date of the last asserted
4
5

occurrence of the unlawful practice. In amending § 3613(a)(1)(A) to incorporate the continuing violation

6

doctrine, Congress clearly intended to hold such repeat violators liable for past transgressions until a

7

reasonable period had transpired after they ceased the unlawful practice. The FHA recognizes no

8

exception for discrimination in the design and construction of multifamily housing; and Defendants

9
10
11

continue to fail to provide an "intelligible argument” why this Court should take the extraordinary step of
fashioning an exception here.

units accessible because the new owners have been joined as parties to allow this Court to order such
relief as it deems appropriate. 542 F. Supp. 2d 1054.
