Procedure 12(b)(6) on the grounds that:

(1) Plaintiffs first cause of action for violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. 0x00A71983
fails to identify any deprivation of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution;

(2) Plaintiffs second cause of action for breach of contract fails because Plaintiff
voluntarily incurred attorney's fees when no legal claim or cause of action had been asserted
against him;

(3) Plaintiff's third cause of action for tortious interference with contract fails because
punitive damages are not recoverable for the breach of an obligation arising from contract;

(4) Plaintiff's fourth cause of action for violation of Cal. Lab. Code 0x00A71102.5 fails
because Plaintiff was not an "employee" of the County within the meaning of the statute;

(5) Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for violation of Cal. Lab. Code 0x00A7203 fails because
among other reasons, the $14,000 in incurred attorney's fees does not constitute "wages" or
"labor" as defined by the statute;

(6) Plaintiff's sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails
because the conduct complained of is protected by an absolute privilege, and emotional distress
damages are not available for a breach of contract;

(7) Plaintiff's seventh cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress
fails because Defendants did not owe Plaintiff a duty of care.

In addition to the foregoing, all causes of action directed against the individual board
members should be dismissed because they are entitled to absolute legislative immunity under
California Civil Code Section 47. It is also requested that the action be dismissed for failure to
provide a short and plain statement of the claim as required by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
8(a). In the alternative, Defendants moves for a more definite statement pursuant to Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure 1 2(e).

The Motion will be based on this Notice of motion and Motion, the Memorandum of
Points and Authorities filed herewith, the Declaration of Daniel P. McKinnon, the pleadings and
papers filed herein, and upon such other oral or documentary evidence of showing as may be

made at the hearing of said motion.

I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff JOHN J. SARSFIELD ("Plaintiff") is the former District Attorney for the County

of San Benito. Plaintiff is suing defendants COUNTY OF SAN BENITO ("County"), JAIME
DE LA CRUZ, REB MONACO, ANTHONY BOTELHO, and DON MARCUS (collectively
"Defendants") for damages arising out of an alleged breach of a settlement agreement and his
tenure as District Attorney. De La Cruz, Monaco, Botelho, and Marcus are being sued in their
official capacity as members of the County Board of Supervisors.

Plaintiff alleges seven causes of action: 1) Violation of Civil Rights under 42 U.S.C.
Section 1983; 2) Breach of Contract; 3) Tortious Interference with Contract, 5) Violation of
California Labor Code 0x00A71102.5; 6) Violation of California Labor Code 0x00A7203; 6) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; and 7) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. Plaintiff is
seeking general damages in excess of $1 million, unspecified damages for mental anguish and

emotional distress, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.

iI.

PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS
On August 12, 2004, County employees Katie Fancher ("Fancher") and Julie Roybal

("Roybal") filed a complaint against the County and Plaintiff in the San Benito County Superior
Court (San Benito County Superior Court Case Number CV-04-00117). The complaint alleged
that Plaintiff, as their supervisor, engaged in sexual harassment and gender discrimination against
them. In January 2005, the County and Plaintiff entered into a confidential settlement agreement
with Fancher and Roybal.

On March 11, 2005, Fancher and Roybal filed a Writ of Mandate pursuant to the
California Public Records Act in the San Benito County Superior Court, requesting the release of
documents relating to the County's investigation of the sexual harassment complaint (San Benito
County Superior Court Case Number CU-05-00042). The only parties to this action were

Petitioners Fancher and Roybal and the Respondent County. The County filed an Opposition to

the Writ, arguing the requested records were privileged because they were prepared in
anticipation of litigation and therefore protected from disclosure.

Although Plaintiff was not a party to the action, he voluntarily injected himself into the
Writ proceeding by filing an amicus curie brief through counsel. As a result, Plaintiff claims to
have incurred $14,000 in attorney's fees, which he sought to recover from the County under an
indemnity provision in the confidential settlement agreement. The County refused to indemnify
Plaintiff for his attorney's fees and this lawsuit ensued.

Despite the constitutional averments, Plaintiff has only pled a cause of action for breach of
contract. The entire focus of Plaintiff's Complaint involves the alleged breach of the confidential
settlement agreement. Plaintiff alleges that the County breached the settlement agreement by: 1)
disclosing details of the settlement to the public, and 2) by not indemnifying Plaintiff for the
$14,000 in attorney's fees. The remainder of Plaintiff's fourteen-page Complaint incorporates
each claim for relief into a rambling narrative containing immaterial background information,
political griping followed by legal conclusions, and perfunctory references to non-existent
constitutional rights.

By its Motion, Defendants request the Court to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for the
following reasons:

e Plaintiff's first cause of action for violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. $1983
fails to identify any deprivation of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution;

0x00B0 Plaintiff's second cause of action for breach of contract fails because Plaintiff
voluntarily incurred attorney's fees when no legal claim or cause of action had been asserted
against him;

(R) Plaintiff's third cause of action for tortious interference with contract fails because
punitive damages are not recoverable for the breach of an obligation arising from contract;

(R) Plaintiff's fourth cause of action for violation of California Labor Code 0x00A71102.5
fails because Plaintiff was not an "employee" of the County within the meaning of the statute;

e Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for violation of California Labor Code 0x00A7203 fails

because among other reasons, the $14,000 in incurred attorney's fees does not constitute "wages"

or "labor" as defined by the statute;

0x00B0 Plaintiff's sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails
because the conduct complained of is not outrageous, is protected by an absolute privilege, and
emotional distress damages are not available for a breach of contract;

(R) Plaintiff's seventh cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress
fails because Defendants did not owe Plaintiff a duty of care.

In addition to the foregoing, all causes of action directed against the individual board
members should be dismissed because they are entitled to absolute legislative immunity. Finally,
Plaintiff's Complaint centers around a political dispute between publicly elected officials of the
executive and legislative branches of local government and this Court should use its discretion to
abstain from deciding the matter. Accordingly, the Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to

Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Iii.
LEGAL ARGUMENT

A. The Court has Authority to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint Pursuant to Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6)

Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant can move
to dismiss a complaint if the facts as alleged in the complaint fail to state a claim for which relief
can be granted. F.R.C.P., Rule 12(b)(6). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate
when it clearly appears that the plaintiff cannot prove a set of facts to support the claim that
would entitle him or her to relief. See Conley v. Gibson, (1957) 355 U.S. 41, 45-46.

In deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must (1) construe the complaint in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff; (2) accept all well-pleaded facts as true; and (3) determine
whether plaintiff can prove any set of facts to support a claim that would merit relief. Cahill v.
Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., (9th Cir. 1996) 80 F.3d 336, 337-338. However, the court need not "accept
any unreasonable inferences or assume the truth of legal conclusions cast in the form of factual
allegations." Ileto v. Glock Inc., (9th Cir. 2003) 349 F.3d 1191, 1200.

Further, the court need not accept as true, allegations that contradict facts which may be
