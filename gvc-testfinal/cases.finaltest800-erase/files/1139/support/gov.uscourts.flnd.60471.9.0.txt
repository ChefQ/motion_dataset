MOTION OF DEFENDANTS KOPPERS INC. AND BEAZER EAST, INC. TO
DISMISS PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS FOR EQUITABLE AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF, VIOLATION OF THE WATER QUALITY ASSURANCE ACT AND
NEGLIGENCE PER SE AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT'

Defendants Koppers Inc. ("Koppers") and Beazer East, Inc. ("Beazer"), by their
attorneys, respectfully move this Court, pursuant to Fed. R, Civ. P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss

Plaintiffs' claims for equitable and injunctive relief (Count I), violation of the Water

 

' Pursuant to Beaulieu v. Board of Trustees of University of West Florida, No. 3:07cv30/RV/EMT, 2007
WL 2020161 (N.D. Fla. July 9, 2007), Defendants are not obligated to file an answer to the unchallenged
counts of plaintiffs' complaint until after the Court has ruled on Defendants' partial motion to dismiss. See
2007 WL 2020161, at *2 (holding that a partial motion to dismiss extends the moving party's period of
time to answer under Rule 12(a)(4) until after the Court has ruled on the motion to dismiss); see also Oil
Express Nat'l Inc. vy. D'Alessandro, 173 F.R.D. 219, 221 (N.D. Ill. 1997) ("[A] partial motion to dismiss
allows for altering the time limits of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a) with respect to answering those claims not
addressed in Defendants' motion.").

Quality Assurance Act (Count ID, and negligence per se (Count V). Plaintiffs' claim for
equitable and injunctive relief should be dismissed because plaintiffs have failed to allege
a prima facie case warranting any equitable relief. Plaintiffs' claim for violation of
Florida's Water Quality Assurance Act should be dismissed because plaintiffs have failed
to allege that any alleged discharge violated any standard set by the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection ("FDEP"). Plaintiffs' purported negligence per se claim
fails because plaintiffs allege, in conclusory fashion, violations of statutes that are
designed to protect the general public instead of a particular class of people. Defendants
submit the following memorandum of law in support of this motion.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

In this putative class action, a group of purported property owners in Gainesville,
Florida, attempt to assert claims for injunctive relief, violation of Florida's Water Quality
Assurance Act ("WQAA"), negligence, negligence per se, strict liability, trespass and
nuisance based on the alleged emission of chemicals and dust during and after
commercial wood treatment operations conducted at a Superfund site ("the Site") that has
been monitored and regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for decades.
Plaintiffs seek damages for diminished property value, loss of use and enjoyment of
property, stigma and increased risk of adverse health effects. (Complaint, J 38.)
Plaintiffs have named several defendants, including Koppers and Beazer - each of whom

owned and operated a portion of the Site at different times.
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 3 of 10

Plaintiffs' claim for equitable and injunctive relief should be dismissed because
plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts showing that they lack an adequate remedy at
law and are at serious risk of continuing irreparable harm if the relief is not granted.
Plaintiffs' claim for violation of Florida's Water Quality Assurance Act should be
dismissed, as plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that any discharge violated any
standard set by the FDEP. Plaintiffs' purported negligence per se claim fails because
plaintiffs allege, in conclusory fashion, violations of statutes that were designed to protect
the general public instead of a particular class of people. Therefore, the Court should
dismiss, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs' claims for equitable and
injunctive relief (Count I), violation of the Water Quality Assurance Act (Count II), and
negligence per se (Count V).

ARGUMENT
A. APPLICABLE PLEADING STANDARD.

Prior to the Supreme Court's decisions in Twombly and Iqbal, a complaint could
not be dismissed for failure to state a claim "unless it appear[ed] beyond doubt that the
plamtiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to
relief." Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). Twombly "retired" Conley's "no
set of facts test" and emphasized that the plaintiff's "[flactual allegations must be enough
to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007). In other words, the plaintiff must provide sufficient factual

allegations to "state a claim to relief that 1s plausible on its face." Jd. at 570.
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 4 of 10

In Igbai, the Court re-emphasized that "[a] claim has facial plausibility when the
plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that
the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937,
1949 (2009) (emphasis added). Complaints must have "more than an unadorned, the-
defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Jd. The mere possibility that a defendant
acted unlawfully, or the existence even of factual allegations that are consistent with the
defendant's liability, are imsufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Jd And
"It]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory
statements, do not suffice." Jd. Only where "there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a
court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to
an entitlement to relief." Jd This is a "context-specific task that requires the reviewing
court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Jd; see also Sinaltrainal v.
Coca-Cola Co., 578 F.3d 1252, 1260-61 (11th Cir. 2009).

B. PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM FOR EQUITABLE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Plaintiffs seek money damages in this action. (Complaint, yen 14.) Plaintiffs request
compensation for alleged "loss of the use and enjoyment of their homes and properties,
loss of value of their homes and properties due to...stigma..., permanent diminution of
the value of their homes and properties, and increased risk of adverse health effects."
(Complaint, 9 38.) Despite this request for money damages, Plaintiffs also seek to have
this Court grant injunctive relief which would enjoin all activity at the Site. (Complaint,

4/60.) Plaintiffs' claim for equitable and injunctive relief should be dismissed.
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 5 of 10

To state a claim for such injunctive relief, Plaintiffs must, at a minimum, allege
facts showing that they lack an adequate remedy at law and are at serious risk of
continuing irreparable harm if the relief is not granted. Sibley v. Lando, 437 F.3d 1067,
1073 (11th Cir. 2005); Weaver v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 172 F.3d 771, 773 (11th Cir.
1999). Plaintiffs simply allege that they "are without adequate remedy at law" and "will
suffer irreparable harm ifthe Court does not grant the injunctive and other equitable relief
requested in this count," but plaintiffs do not allege sufficient facts supporting either of
these necessary elements. (Complaint, ff 58-59.) Plaintiffs are not excused from
alleging such facts merely because they assert their claims as part of a putative class
action. See, e.g., Drayton v. Western Auto Supply Co., No. 01-10415, 2002 WL
32508918, at *4-5 (11th Cir. Mar. 11, 2002) (holding putative class representatives not
entitled to injunctive relief absent allegations of irreparable harm). Therefore, plaintiffs
have failed to state a prima facie claim for any equitable relief, and Count I of the
complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. See County of Monroe v. Priceline.com,
Inc., No. 09-10004, 2009 WL 4890664, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2009) (dismissing claim
for injunctive relief).

Cc. PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM FOR VIOLATION OF FLORIDA'S WATER
QUALITY ASSURANCE ACT.

Plaintiffs' claim for violation of the Florida Water Quality Assurance Act
("WQAA") alleges that airborne emissions and "waterborne transport of contamination"
from the Site contaminated their property. (Complaint at f0x00A7 24, 25, 32, 62, 63.)
Plaintiffs claim that they are exposed to "dangerous and undesirable levels of toxic and

dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances," but do not allege that any claimed
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 6 of 10

discharge from the Site violated any standard of the FDEP and caused a particular injury
to them. (See Complaint, 0x00A7 18.) Because Plaintiffs have failed to allege that any
discharge violated any FDEP standard, they have failed to state a claim for violation of
the WQAA and the Court should dismiss that claim.

The WQAA prohibits the "discharge [of] pollutants or hazardous substances into
or upon the surface or ground waters of the state or lands, which discharge violates any
departmental `standard.""" FLA. STAT. ANN. 0x00A7376.302(1)(a) (West 2010) (emphasis
added). Here, Plaintiffs merely allege that they have been exposed to "dangerous and
undesirable levels of toxic and dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances."
(Complaint, 0x00A7 18.) This is not sufficient to state a claim under the WQAA.'

For example, in The St. Joe Company v. Leslie, 912 So. 2d 21 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
2005) the plaintiffs brought a class action complaint, including a Section 376.313 claim,
alleging that pollution from paper mill waste products caused soil and water
contamination in the defined class area. In reversing the trial court's certification of the
class, the appellate court noted that plaintiffs could not prevail on their Section 376.313
claim in the absence of "evidence that the waste, which the class representatives saw
being dumped, exceeded DEP's standards." The St. Joe Co., 912 So. 2d at 25. Like the

plaintiffs in St Joe, Plaintiffs here cannot prevail on their Section 376.313 claim because

 

* "Standard" is defined as "any rule of the Department of Environmental Protection relating to air and water
quality, noise, solid-waste management, and electric and magnetic fields associated with electrical
transmission and distribution lines and substation facilities." It does not include "rules . . . which relate
exclusively to the internal management of the department, the procedural processing of applications, the
administration of rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, the publication of notices, the conduct of
hearings, or other procedural matters." FLA. STAT. ANN. 0x00A7 403.803.

? The Complaint does reference the "Soil Cleanup Target Level" for dioxin. (Complaint, 28.) As the Soil
Cleanup Target Level relates to soil, and not "air and water quality," it is not an FDEP "standard" within
the meaning of the WQAA. See FLA. STAT. ANN. 0x00A7 403.803.
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 7 of 10

they have failed to allege that any emission from the Site violated any FDEP standard.
Thus, Plaintiffs' claim for violation of Florida's Water Quality Assurance Act should be
dismissed.

D. PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENCE PER SE.

Plaintiffs' negligence per se claim - alleged in a single paragraph as part of
Plaintiffs' negligence claim - relies on unspecified violations of the Florida Water
Quality Assurance Act ("WQAA") and Aw and Water Pollution Act ("AWPA").
(Complaint, { 82.) Plaintiffs' reliance on those statutes is dubious. The WQAA and
AWPA are designed to protect the environment and general public in the State of Florida
and not a particular class of people of which Plaintiffs claim to be members. Florida law
does not provide a cause of action for negligence per se when the statute that the
defendant allegedly violated is not designed to protect a particular class of people.
Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for negligence per se, and the Court should
dismiss that claim.

In Florida, a statutory violation constitutes negligence per se in only two limited
circumstances: (1) if the statute is designed to protect a particular class of persons who
are unable to protect themselves; or (2) if the statute establishes a duty to take precautions
to protect a particular class of persons from a particular type of harm. Any other alleged
statutory violation constitutes mere evidence of negligence. deJesus v. Seaboard Coast
Line R.R. Co., 281 So. 2d 198, 201 (Fla. 1973). Accordingly, when a plaintiff alleges
that the defendant violated a statute designed to protect the general public, rather than a

particular class of people, he cannot maintain a claim for negligence per se based on that
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 8 of 10

violation. See, e.g., Chevron USA, Ine. v. Forbes, 783 So. 2d 1215, 1219-20 (Fla. Dist.
Ct. App. 2001).

Despite Plaintiffs' unsupported allegations to the contrary (Complaint, 0x00A7 82), the
WQAA and AWPA are not designed to protect a particular class of people. Instead,
those statutes are designed to protect the general public. The WQAA seeks to preserve
surface and ground waters in the State of Florida. When it enacted the WQAA, the
Florida legislature declared that "[s]pills, discharges, and escapes of pollutants . . . and
hazardous substances _. . pose threats of great danger and damage to the environment of
the state, to citizens of the state, and to other interests deriving livelihood from the state."
FLA. STAT. 0x00A7 376.30(2\(b) (2010). When it enacted the AWPA, the legislature similarly
declared that "pollution of the air and waters of this state constitutes a menace to public
health and welfare" and specifically stated "the provisions of this act are enacted in the
exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace,
safety, and general welfare of the people of this state." FLA. STAT. 0x00A7 403.021(1), (5).

Because the WQAA and AWPA are designed to protect the general public and
not the plaintiffs specifically, Plaintiffs cannot rely on alleged violations of those statutes
to state a claim for negligence per se. The Court should dismiss plaintiffs' negligence
per se claim.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.

12(b)(6) Plaintiffs' claims for equitable and injunctive relief (Count I), violation of the

Water Quality Assurance Act (Count ID, and negligence per se (Count V). Defendants
Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document9 Filed 12/29/10 Page 9 of 10

further request any further and alternative relief that the Court deems just and appropriate
under the circumstances.
