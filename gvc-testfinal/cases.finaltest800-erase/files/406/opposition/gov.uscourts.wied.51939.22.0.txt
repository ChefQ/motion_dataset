DEFENDANT YAHOO! INC.’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ALTER
OR AMEND THE JUDGEMENT PURSUANT TO RULE 59(e), F.R.C.P. AND REQUEST
FOR CLARIFICATION
______________________________________________________________________________
Plaintiff Beverly Stayart (“Plaintiff”) continues her seemingly endless quest to sustain her
frivolous claims, this time in the form of a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59
that fails to provide any compelling reason for the Court to reverse its prior dismissal of her
(second) complaint. 1 The Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion and order Plaintiff to pay
Yahoo!’s attorney’s fees and costs associated with its response, because:
•

There has been no intervening change in controlling law. The only “new
authority” Plaintiff cites is a decision by the Eastern District of California that
contains reasoning similar to cases dating back to 2004 that the parties briefed
extensively on Yahoo!’s motion to dismiss.

•

The Court’s prior order is sufficiently clear in holding that Plaintiff’s allegations
do not support a finding that Yahoo! “used” her name in advertising or trade as

This Court’s decision on a motion to alter or amend a judgment lies within its discretion and is
reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. Obriecht v. Raemisch, 517 F.3d 489, 492 (7th
Cir. 2008); Harrington v. City of Chicago, 433 F.3d 542, 546 (7th Cir.2006).

Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 04/11/11 Page 1 of 8 Document 22

required by Wis. Stat.§ 995.20(b). Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts
demonstrating that Yahoo! gained any benefit from her name or undertook any
task other than providing publicly available information to its users.
•

A.

No material mistakes of fact have occurred. Rather, Plaintiff’s motion again
misrepresents the content of her complaint in an attempt to save her baseless
claim and improperly re-hashes matters of factual interpretation previously
briefed to and rejected by this Court
No Change in the Law Has Occurred

Plaintiff’s suggestion that Jurin v. Google Inc., 2:09-c.v.-03065-MCE-KJM, 2011 WL
572300 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2011) makes a “change in the applicable law” warranting
reconsideration or amendment of the judgment distorts Rule 59(e) standards and, in reality, is
nothing more than a thinly-veiled attempt to re-argue law already presented to this court. 2 Not
surprisingly, only an intervening change in controlling law is sufficient to provide a tribunal with
reason to alter or amend a prior judgment. See, e.g., Cosgrove v. Bartolotta, 150 F.3d 729, 732
(7th Cir. 1998) (Rule 59(e) motion is appropriate when there is “an intervening change in the
controlling law.”). Plainly, a district court in California’s analysis of a different set of factual
allegations is not controlling law in this Court.
Moreover, a Rule 59(e) motion presented under the guise of a change in controlling law
may not be used simply to re-litigate issues that have already been decided. Sigsworth v. City of
Aurora, Ill., 487 F.3d 506, 512 (7th Cir. 2007). Stated differently, “[a] motion that merely
republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal
no reason to change its mind.” Musch v. Domtar Indus., Inc., 07-CV-524-BBC, 2008 WL
5111310 (W.D. Wis. Dec. 4, 2008) aff'd, 587 F.3d 857 (7th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ahmed v.
2

The parties cited and discussed Jurin v. Google, Inc., 695 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (E.D. Cal. 2010), the
earlier opinion in this case, in their prior briefing, but the Court did not rely on Jurin in its order.
The speciousness of Stayart’s belated attempt to attach unwarranted significance to Jurin is
transparent. Were Jurin a significant change in controlling law, Plaintiff could have advised the
Court of it via a Notice of Supplemental Authority prior to this Court’s March 8, 2011 order, as
Yahoo! did when the Seventh Circuit issued its decision in Stayart v. Yahoo!.

-2Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 04/11/11 Page 2 of 8 Document 22

Ashcroft, 388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004)). That is all Plaintiff has done here.
The Court has already addressed very the arguments Plaintiff makes based on Jurin in its
March 8, 2011 order. Specifically, in her response to Yahoo!’s motion to dismiss, Plaintiff cited
a number of cases that, like Jurin, hold that the sale of a trademarked keyword for advertising
purposes constitutes a “use in commerce” under the Lanham Act. (Dkt. 15 at 15). On reply,
Yahoo! argued that these cases were distinguishable because the sale of a trademarked name is
irrelevant to the Court’s analysis in this case. (Dkt. 16 at 6-7).
Yahoo!’s argument, on which the Court relied, is unaffected by Jurin. In fact, Plaintiff
cited and Yahoo! distinguished a similar case in which the court found that a search engine itself
“used” a trademarked term by suggesting it and selling it as a keyword. Gov’t Employees
Insurance Co. v. Google, Inc., 330 F. Supp. 2d 700, 703 (E.D. Va. 2004) (“GEICO”); (Dkt. 15 at
7-8 (citing GEICO)). Plaintiff does not explain how Jurin is an intervening change in law in
light of GEICO. See also Rescuecom Corp. v. Google, Inc., 562 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2009)
(recommendation and sale of trademarked terms as adwords could constitute “use in commerce”
under the Lanham Act). Nor does Plaintiff’s brief explain why Jurin is not distinguishable on
the same grounds as GEICO, which addressed the sale of the plaintiff’s trademarked term to
competitors under the Lanham Act—not the mere suggestion of the trademarked term as an
alternate or additional search term to a consumer running searches as the complaint alleges here.
Even if Jurin were somehow a change in controlling law and distinguishable from
GEICO, it is distinguishable from this case. A comparison of Ms. Stayart’s allegations to Mr.
Jurin’s reveals stark differences. Whereas Plaintiff here alleges non-commercial participation on
a limited number of Internet sites, the plaintiff in Jurin was a company that “markets and sells its
trademarked “Styrotrim” building material to homeowners, contractors and those in the
construction and remodeling industries. Jurin v. Google Inc., 2:09-CV-03065 MCEKJM, 2011
-3Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 04/11/11 Page 3 of 8 Document 22

WL 572300 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2011) Further, the parties that used the term “Styrotrim” in their
advertisements on Google were plaintiff’s competitors. Id. Indeed, Google did not even
challenge the plaintiff’s standing to sue under the Lanham Act in Jurin. Id.
There is no allegation in the complaint that Plaintiff’s name had any value comparable to
that associated with “Styrotrim,” or that Plaintiff made any effort to create value in her name,
that Yahoo! could have profited from had it attempted to use her name, or that Yahoo! suggested
or sold Ms. Stayart’s name as a keyword for advertising when Plaintiff attempted to purchase the
“Levitra” keyword. (Dkt. 16 at 5). 3 Instead, the record is clear that Yahoo! did nothing more
than search publicly available information about an individual with no particularly strong value
attached to her name and display it to its users.
In sum, Plaintiff’s citation of a district court decision that: (1) issued from another
circuit; (2) issued before this Court’s order; (3) mirrored the holding in a different case the
parties briefed on Yahoo!’s motion to dismiss; and (4) is readily distinguishable from the present
case, falls woefully short of the requirements of Rule 59.
B.

The Court’s Order Requires No Clarification

Plaintiff’s request for “clarification” is no more than an obvious attempt to advance an
argument already discussed at length in the parties’ prior briefs. (Dkt. 15 at 5-6 (discussing
Plaintiff’s internet activities); 13-16 (arguing that Yahoo! “used” Plaintiff’s name)). 4

This

Court’s order is clear: Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a finding that
Yahoo! used her name for advertising or trade purposes, derived a commercial benefit from it, or

3

In her motion for reconsideration, Plaintiff attempts to recast her complaint to align her
allegations with Jurin, arguing that “Yahoo encourages internet advertisers to bid on the
keyword phrase ‘bev stayart levitra.’” (Dkt. 21 at 11). Notably, Plaintiff does not support this
statement with a citation to her complaint, because the allegation simply is not there.
4
To the extent Plaintiff desires clarification to file yet another suit, it is unclear how she could
given the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion. See Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 789
F.2d 589, 593 (7th Cir. 1986).
-4Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 04/11/11 Page 4 of 8 Document 22

that Plaintiff suffered any substantial damages. (Order at 4). The Court should simply ignore
Plaintiff’s request regarding clarification of factual findings. The Court did not engage in any
fact finding, instead it evaluated her complaint, and found that the allegations were insufficient.
Plaintiff does not dispute that use in advertising or trade purposes is required under Wis.
Stat. §995.50(2)(b). Instead, she argues that the Court improperly grafted a “commercial value”
requirement onto Wisconsin law in addition to the “use” requirement. (Dkt. 21, 6-7). To the
contrary, this Court did not require a showing of “commercial value,” but merely stated that had
Plaintiff provided some allegations supporting commercial value in her name, she may have
presented allegations that would support an inference that Yahoo! had reason to use her name for
advertising or trade purposes. Alleging commercial value is thus one way of demonstrating the
property right a plaintiff must have in her name to state a claim under Wis. Stat. § 995.50. 5 The
Court’s order thus makes clear that Plaintiff must allege “use” beyond “search[ing] publicly
available materials on the internet and return the results of the search.” (Order at 4).
This decision does not conflict with Stayart v. Yahoo!, Inc., 651 F. Supp. 2d 873 (E.D.
Wis. 2009). The Court’s statement in that case that Plaintiff could file a “pure appropriation”
invasion of privacy claim does not mean that claim would survive a motion to dismiss. Indeed,
the Court only discussed the claim in light of the CDA, stating that “the Court cannot say with
certainty that a potential right to publicity claim under Wisconsin law is without merit, meaning
that the intellectual property exception could save Stayart's claims.” Id. at 887 (emphasis added).
This Court resolved the issue without resort to the CDA, and even if it had, the prior order
recognized such a claim still might not survive under the CDA. There is thus no conflict.

No Mistakes of Fact Occurred

See Dkt. 10 at 14-18 ((citing Hirsch v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., 90 Wis. 2d 379, 387, 280
N.W.2d 129, 132 (1979) and arguing that a plaintiff must have a property right in her name to
bring suit under § 995.50); Dkt. 16 at 7-8 (rebutting plaintiff’s arguments, which are nearly
identical to those presented in this motion).
-5Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 04/11/11 Page 5 of 8 Document 22

Plaintiff repeats sections of her complaint in her motion for reconsideration in the vain
hope that if a Court reads her complaint for the third time it will, for no particular new reason,
change its mind as to its interpretation. In order to support an alteration or amendment of a
judgment, however, Plaintiff must “clearly establish[] a manifest error of law or fact.” Cnty. of
McHenry v. Ins. Co. of the W., 438 F.3d 813, 819 (7th Cir. 2006). “A ‘manifest error’ is not
demonstrated by the disappointment of the losing party.

It is the ‘wholesale disregard,

misapplication, or failure to recognize’” facts or law. Oto v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 224 F.3d 601,
606 (7th Cir. 2000); Sedrak v. Callahan, 987 F. Supp. 1063, 1069 (N.D.Ill.1997).
Plaintiff has not met this high bar here where the Court already considered and rejected
Plaintiff’s interpretation of the allegations in her complaint. The Court specifically addressed the
facts Plaintiff presented in her complaint and repeated in her latest filing. (Order at 2-4).
Plaintiff makes no compelling argument to revisit those facts beyond the claim that the Court did
not specifically state its opinion on each fact presented. Oto, 224 F.3d at 606 (“Rule 59 is not a
vehicle for rearguing previously rejected motions.”) The mere fact that the order does not recite
or address every fact the Plaintiff raises cannot serve as basis for re-arguing the motion to
dismiss where the Court simply and correctly rejected Plaintiff’s previously-raised arguments.
In any event, Plaintiff, not the Court, is mistaken.

In her motion, Plaintiff again

misrepresents the complaint, claiming that “Here, Yahoo encourages internet advertisers to bid
on the keyword phrase ‘bev stayart levitra.’” (Dkt. 21 at 11). But as Yahoo! pointed out in its
reply on the motion to dismiss and the paragraphs preceding this statement in Plaintiff’s own
motion make clear, the Complaint does not and cannot allege any such thing. (Dkt. 16 at 2-3).
Amendment through a responsive pleading cannot defeat a motion to dismiss—and neither can
an amendment in a motion to alter or amend the judgment. Perkins v. Silverstein, 939 F.2d 463,
470 n. 6 (7th Cir.1991); Stayart, 651 F.Supp.2d at 889.
-6Case 2:10-cv-00043-LA Filed 04/11/11 Page 6 of 8 Document 22

Nor was there any mistake of fact regarding Plaintiff’s failure to allege facts to support
$75,000 worth of damages. As this Court stated:
As to the amount in controversy requirement, when a defendant
challenges whether a plaintiff has satisfactorily alleged the
jurisdictional minimum, the plaintiff must support the allegation
with competent proof and establish the jurisdictional minimum by
a preponderance of the evidence. McMillian v. Sheraton Chicago
Hotel & Towers, 567 F.3d 839, 844 (7th Cir. 2009). To do this, the
plaintiff must do more than “point to the theoretical availability of
certain categories of damages.” Id.
(Order at 3). As Yahoo! previously argued under Wis. Stat. § 995.50(1)(b), only compensatory
damages are recoverable.

Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration does not explain how an

individual, whose name courts have repeatedly found has no commercial value, could have
provided a benefit to Yahoo! in excess of $75,000 or otherwise suffered $75,000 in
compensatory damages. See Griffith v. Fenrick, 486 F. Supp. 2d 848 (W.D. Wis. 2007) (holding
that a famous actor did not demonstrate more than $75,000 in damages). Additionally, there are
no allegations in the complaint regarding physical ailments, mental health issues, missed work
days, prescription drug costs, or reduced quality of life—which are hallmarks of a plaintiff who
has actually suffered the type of emotional damage required to support the outrageous sums
Plaintiff seeks here. Plaintiff’s claims of attorney’s fees and punitive damages are insufficient to
pull her nominal damages up to the jurisdictional threshold. As Yahoo! argued (and Plaintiff
fails to address in her motion), a plaintiff must have more than $75,000 in attorney’s fees at the
time of filing to support jurisdiction. Hart v. Schering-Plough Corp., 253 F.3d 272, 273 (7th Cir.
2010). Likewise, Plaintiff does not explain how such a small compensatory loss could support
punitive damages in the outrageous sum of $75,000. 6

Plaintiff previously cited Beverly v. Choices Women’s Medical Ctr., Inc., 587 N. E. 2d 275
(N.Y. Ct. App. 1991) in support of a large damages award. This Court rightly rejected that case,
because unlike Plaintiff, the plaintiff in Beverly “testified that she suffered physical and mental
injury as a result of the publication of her picture in the calendar. The plaintiff also testified as to

D.

Yahoo! is Entitled to Fees and Costs for Responding to Plaintiff’s Motion

As stated above, Plaintiff’s motion is frivolous and is nothing more than an attempt to
impermissibly reargue issues adequately presented to this court on Yahoo!’s motion to dismiss.
Yahoo! thus requests that this Court order Plaintiff to pay its legal fees and costs associated with
opposing this frivolous motion. Melrose v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., 898 F.2d 1209, 1216 (7th
Cir. 1990) (upholding imposition of attorney’s fees as sanctions where, even though portions of a
motion were successful, other portions were frivolous).

Additionally, under Wis. Stat.

§ 995.50(6), courts are to award a prevailing defendant its attorneys’ fees and costs for defending
against frivolous right of publicity claims. Yahoo! thus intends to file a motion seeking all of its
attorney’s fees to date after this Court rules on Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.
E.

Conclusion

Yahoo! respectfully requests that this Court bring Plaintiff’s continued quest to re-litigate
issues to a merciful end. As stated above, Plaintiff has not identified a change in controlling law,
material mistakes of fact, or a sufficient need for clarification of the Court’s order. As such, the
Court should deny Plaintiff’s frivolous motion and order her to pay Yahoo!’s attorney’s fees and
costs in responding.
