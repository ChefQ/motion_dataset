PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a) and 65(b) and Local Rule 65.1, Plaintiff Morris D.
Davis moves for a temporary restraining order or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction
reinstating him as the Assistant Director of the Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade ("FDT"')
Division at the Congressional Research Service ("CRS"), a service unit of the Library of
Congress ("Library"). In the alternative, Plaintiff seeks a temporary restraining order and/or a
preliminary injunction prohibiting the Library from filling the Assistant Director position and
from terminating Plaintiff's temporary current employment as the Special Advisor to the
Director of CRS, pending resolution of the merits of this matter.

Plaintiff files this motion now in order to ensure that he can obtain relief prior to January

20, 2010, when he will be terminated from his current temporary position at CRS. After that
Case 1:10-cv-00036-RBW Document 2 _ Filed 01/08/10 Page 2 of 3

date, he will no longer be employed by the Library, and substantial further irreparable harm will
result, as it is possible that Plaintiff may later be barred from recovering monetary relief because
of sovereign immunity.

Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a hearing on the motion for a temporary
restraining order or, in the alternative, preliminary injunction, such that the Court can adjudicate
the matter before January 20, 2010. Plaintiff proposes the following schedule: the Library's
opposition to this motion shall be due by 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 13, 2010; Plaintiffs
reply shall be due by 3:00 p.m. on Friday, January 15, 2010; and the hearing, if one is required,
shall occur on Tuesday, January 19, 2010, or as soon thereafter as the matter can be heard,
depending on the Court's availability.

Defendant has been on notice of Plaintiffs intention to file this lawsuit and to seek
injunctive relief since December 4, 2009. To eliminate the need to move for a temporary
restraining order or an expedited preliminary injunction, Plaintiff subsequently proposed that the
parties enter into a scheduling agreement, under which Plaintiff agreed to give the Library ten
business days to respond to his motion for a preliminary injunction and the Library agreed to
extend Plaintiffs temporary position at CRS until February 4, 2009. The Library tentatively
agreed to that proposal. The Library subsequently informed Plaintiff that it was no longer
agreeable to that proposal.

The grounds for this motion are that Plaintiff has a substantial probability of success on
the merits of his claim that his termination violated the First and Fifth Amendments to the
Constitution of the United States and that the Library and CRS's policies on outside speaking
and writing are unconstitutional on their face and as applied to him; that absent immediate relief

Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm; that the requested injunctive relief will not injure the
Case 1:10-cv-00036-RBW Document 2 _ Filed 01/08/10 Page 3 of 3

Library and the balance of hardships tips in Plaintiff's favor; and that the public interest supports

granting the requested relief, all as shown more fully in the accompanying Memorandum of

Points and Authorities, the Declarations of Morris D. Davis, Kerri Dumbaugh, Louis Fisher,

Frederick Mulhauser, Morton Rosenberg, Harold Relyea, Dennis Roth and Ben Wittes, and all

other papers filed herewith.
