UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
TALLAHASSEE DIVISION
MARION P. HAMMER,
Case No. 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS
Plaintiff,
v.
LAWRENCE T. “LOL”
SORENSEN, CHRISTOPHER
RISICA, HOWARD WEISS,
and PATRICK SULLIVAN,
Defendants.
/
PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO SORENSEN’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 and Local Rule 7.1, Plaintiff,
Marion P. Hammer (“Hammer”), responds in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss
[Doc. 28] (the “Motion”) filed by Defendant, Lawrence T. “Lol” Sorensen
(“Sorensen”), and states as follows:
I.

Introduction
Dismissing this case would send the wrong message at a time when everyone

needs to be reminded that there are limits to how people can treat those with whom
they disagree. The legality of Mr. Sorensen’s conduct is judged by what a “civilized
community” considers “decent” and “tolerable.” [See Doc. 28, pp. 8-9] Reaffirming
the guideposts of decency and civility through cases such as this one is critical

{BC00167074:1}

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 2 of 18

because the Internet and social media have connected everyone on platforms where
communication is effortless and instantaneous, yet detached and impersonal, and
where the limits of what reasonable people can be forced to tolerate are devolving.
Not everything one says or does behind the veil of a computer or cell phone
screen is automatically shielded by the First Amendment. People must be held
accountable when they use the Internet to engage in conduct – not speech – that a
civilized society should never tolerate and the First Amendment does not protect.
The ideals the First Amendment protects will be lost if people are allowed to
use it as both a shield and a sword. Consequently, protected speech inherently
excludes words and actions that are intended to intimidate, harass, and silence others:
In a society where the expression of opinion is given the fullest
protection, public figures must expect criticism that may be untrue,
unjustified, or hurtful. They need not, however, passively accept
statements or conduct transcending mere criticism which threaten
personal or family safety… [such that]… personal abuse is not in any
proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by
the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act would raise no
question under that instrument.
Smith v. State, 532 So.2d 50, 53 (Fla. 2d DCA 1988) (quoting Cantwell v.
Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309-10 (1939)). Here, Mr. Sorensen’s emails crossed
the line. Legitimizing his actions by granting them free speech protection would be
a disservice to the First Amendment.

{BC00167074:1}

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 3 of 18

It is undisputed that Mr. Sorensen sought out Ms. Hammer’s e-mail address
and “intentionally”1 sent her two unsolicited e-mails that embedded graphic photos
of gunshot victims to show her the “handiwork of the assault rifles you support.”
Mr. Sorensen sent pictures of mutilated human bodies to a 79-year-old woman he
wrongfully blames for violent acts committed by criminals because he was angry
and wanted to attack, intimidate, bully, and silence Ms. Hammer for her support of
the Second Amendment.
Mr. Sorensen’s contention that his subjective intent was to “express an
opinion regarding the national debate on gun rights” is inconsequential at the
dismissal stage.

[See Doc. 28, p.7]

Issues such as intent and whether a

communication is a threat are questions of fact to be left to the jury. U.S. v. Taylor,
972 F.2d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir. 1992). Moreover, Mr. Sorensen’s self-serving
argument about his purpose rings hollow. Mr. Sorensen is an experienced attorney
and mediator who certainly knows how to communicate effectively and elicit a
dialogue with people of differing viewpoints. But that is not what Mr. Sorensen
chose to do. He did not “ask [Ms. Hammer] to consider the damage that can be done
by firearms…” [See Doc. 28, p. 3] His e-mails are devoid of any mention of “gun
control.” He did not express any ideas or opinions on regulating assault rifles. In
fact, he did not invite Ms. Hammer to debate or comment on anything. Mr. Sorensen

See Doc. 26, p. 3.

{BC00167074:1}

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 4 of 18

was not engaged in anything akin to “anti-war protests.” [Id. p. 4] His e-mails did
not do anything to “inform the public [or] protest violence.” [Id.]
There are countless legitimate ways Mr. Sorensen could have expressed his
opinions on gun control or tried to start a dialogue with Ms. Hammer. Sending her
photos of bodies torn apart by criminals without any expression of an opinion about
gun control is not one of them. Ms. Hammer saw Mr. Sorensen’s emails as a threat—
a graphic depiction of what was going to happen to her because of her support for
the Second Amendment. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 5, 7, 8, 33, 40, 49] It is certainly plausible that
a reasonable person would likewise perceive Mr. Sorensen’s e-mails as harassment,
a threat, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.
II.

The First Amendment Affords Sorensen No Protection
The statutory, equitable, and common law claims asserted by Ms. Hammer

are not barred by the First Amendment. Her claims are based on conduct directed
specifically at her, not protected public speech.

Accordingly, Mr. Sorensen’s

reliance upon cases such as Falwell and Snyder [Motion pp. 3, 5] is misplaced.
The conduct prohibited by Florida’s stalking statute, § 784.048, Florida
Statutes, “is clearly criminal and is unprotected by the First Amendment.” Bouters v.
State, 659 So.2d 235, 237 (Fla. 1995) (“While the First Amendment confers on each
citizen a powerful right to express oneself, it gives the [citizen] no boon to jeopardize
the health, safety, and rights of others.”). The statute prohibits unprotected conduct,

{BC00167074:1}

4

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 5 of 18

which has never been thought to present a First Amendment problem.2 Burroughs
v. Corey, 92 F.Supp.3d 1201, 1208 (M.D. Fla. 2015) (citing U.S. v. Stevens, 559 U.S.
460, 468-69 (2010)).
Statements uttered predominantly to communicate express or implied3 threats
are not constitutionally protected. Eckhardt, 466 F.3d at 943-44 (citing Parker v.
Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 760 (1974)). Similarly, where the overreaching purpose of
communications is to harass and frighten, they are not protected speech. Id. at 944.
Threats and harassment are forms of conduct the First Amendment does not protect:
Harassment is not speech: it is wrongful conduct. The
Florida Supreme Court has recognized that the
government has a strong and legitimate interest in
preventing the harassment of individuals… Prohibiting
harassment is not prohibiting speech, because harassment
is not protected speech.
Harassment is not
communication, although it may take the form of speech.
Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, Inc. v. Siegel, 867 So.2d 451, 464 (Fla. 5th
DCA 2004) (concurring opinion) (quotations and citation omitted).

“Because

harassment is improper conduct, it may be prohibited, or at least regulated, through
an injunction.” Id. (citing Kimball v. Florida Dep’t of Health & Rehabilitative
Servs., 682 So.2d 637 (Fla. 2d DCA 1996) (holding that persons subject to

Similarly, the “thrust” of Federal statutes such as the Telephone Harassment Act is
“to prohibit communications intended to instill fear in the victim, not to provoke a
discussion about political issues of the day.” U.S. v. Eckhardt, 466 F.3d 938, 943
(11th Cir. 2006).
3
At minimum, Mr. Sorensen’s emails qualify as implied threats.

harassment may obtain injunctive relief); see also Gilbreath v. State, 650 So.2d 10,
12 (Fla. 1995) (prohibiting harassment is not prohibiting speech because harassment
is not protected speech).
Speech uttered incident to a tort also is actionable and can be prohibited
without violating the First Amendment. Murtaugh v. Hurley, 40 So.3d 62, 65-66
(Fla. 2d DCA 2010); Chevaldina v. R.K./FL Management, Inc., 133 So.3d 1086 (Fla.
3d DCA 2014); Zimmerman v. D.C.A. at Welleby, Inc., 505 So.2d 1371 (Fla. 4th
DCA 1987).
Mr. Sorensen’s contention that Ms. Hammer is seeking a prior 4 restraint is
also flawed because any injunction entered in this proceeding would be imposed
after a trial.

Advanced Training Systems, Inc. v. Caswell Equipment Co.,

352 N.W.2d 1, 11 (Minn. 1984) (“[T]he special vice of a prior restraint is that
communication will be suppressed, either directly or by inducing excessive caution
in the speaker, before an adequate determination that it is unprotected by the First
Amendment.”) (citing Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Commission on Human Relations,
413 U.S. 376, 390 (1973)); Balboa Island Village Inn v. Lemen, 156 P.3d 339, 349
(Cal. 2007) (“[A]n order based on a continuing course of repetitive conduct,

The Court already addressed Ms. Hammer’s request for a preliminary injunction.

First Amendment, has been held to not be a prior restraint if it is clear and sweeps
no more broadly than necessary.”); Alexander v. U.S., 509 U.S. 544, 552-54 (1993).
III.

The Court Does Not Lack Subject Matter Jurisdiction
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim under

§ 784.0485(1), Florida Statutes, which creates a private right of action for an
injunction against harassment and cyberstalking. The reference in this statute to a
victim having “standing in the circuit court” does not limit this court’s jurisdiction.
§ 784.0485(1)(a), Fla. Stat.
A state legislature’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to a specific state court
does not bar federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction from possessing subject
matter jurisdiction. Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Hardaway Co., 945 F. Supp. 247,
250 (M.D. Fla. 1996). In a diversity case, a plaintiff should obtain the same relief
as would be available in the state court. Id. at 251; see also American Enterprises
Collision Center, Inc. v. Travelers Property and Casualty Co. of America, 2010 WL
11507334, *2 (M.D. Fla Feb. 5, 2010).
Harvick, cited by Mr. Sorensen [Doc. 28, p. 6], is a pro se case based on
original (not diversity) jurisdiction. In Harvick, a claim under § 784.048, Florida
Statutes, was dismissed based on lack of jurisdiction and failure to properly plead.
But that decision has no analysis of the jurisdictional issue – particularly the issue
addressed in Roberts and American Enterprise – and the pleading deficiencies

{BC00167074:1}

7

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 8 of 18

supporting the dismissal (which the decision does not specifically identify) are not
present here. Ms. Hammer’s pleading contains all the information required by
§ 784.0485(3), it is verified, and it is further supported by Ms. Hammer’s
Declaration [Doc. 4].
IV.

Mr. Sorensen Violated § 784.048
Mr. Sorensen’s two e-mails transmitting gruesome images of gunshot victims

qualify as harassment and cyberstalking under section 784.048, Florida Statutes.
These emails comprise a series of acts over a period of time, however short, that
communicated images and were directed to Ms. Hammer, causing substantial
emotional distress and serving no legitimate purpose. §784.048(1)(a)-(b), (d), Fla.
Stat. Each of the required elements of an action for an injunction under the statute
are pleaded. Mr. Sorensen’s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.
First, Mr. Sorensen’s contention that a sufficient course of conduct is not
alleged misses the mark. A “course of conduct” under the statute is established by
just two similar acts over a period of time, “however short.” T.B. v. State, 990 So.2d
651, 654 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008); Jeter v. McKeithen, 2015 WL 3747690, *4 (N.D. Fla.
June 13, 2015).
Second, receiving unsolicited graphic images of gunshot victims would cause
any reasonable person in Ms. Hammer’s shoes to suffer substantial emotional
distress. Leach v. Kersey, 162 So.3d 1104, 1106 (Fla. 2d DCA 2015) (holding that

{BC00167074:1}

8

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 9 of 18

whether a communication causes substantial emotional distress is governed by a
reasonable person standard); Goudy v. Duquette, 112 So.3d 716, 717 (Fla. 2d DCA
2013); Williams v. City of Minneola, 575 So.2s 683 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991) (stating
that gratuitous display of autopsy photos can cause severe emotional distress). The
operative situation in which Mr. Sorensen’s e-mails must be viewed include the
increasingly threatening social climate where people affiliated with the NRA have
been and are under attack. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 7, 22-28, 30-32, 40-44]
Third, Ms. Hammer plausibly alleges Mr. Sorensen’s emails served no
legitimate purpose. Contrary to what is argued in the Motion [p. 7], Ms. Hammer
does dispute that Mr. Sorensen’s “intent was to express an opinion regarding the
national debate on gun rights.” In fact, his emails express no such “opinion.” Rather,
Mr. Sorensen forced Ms. Hammer to unwillingly view photos of gunshot victims as
soon as she opened5 his emails with misleadingly innocuous subject lines (“Assault
Rifle Support Results” and “One more instructive photo”) that also contained thinlyveiled threats about the “handiwork” of assault rifles and the “destruction” they
cause. As set forth above, Mr. Sorensen is an experienced attorney well-capable of
using the English language to convey his arguments and opinions. His failure to use
his professional skills to express anything resembling an opinion, thought, or request

The photos at issue were embedded in the bodies of Mr. Sorensen’s emails. They
were not attachments Ms. Hammer had to open to view.
5

{BC00167074:1}

9

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 10 of 18

about gun control speaks volumes as to his true intent. Regardless, a jury should
decide the legitimacy of Mr. Sorensen’s intent and purpose.
Fourth, Ms. Hammer alleges that Mr. Sorensen’s emails communicated
images and language that conveyed a threat. [Doc. 1, ¶¶ 5, 49] These images of
gunshot victims were sent to one person solely to show the “handiwork” of assault
rifles in the midst of a highly-charged and violent social climate. Such images and
the accompanying text “connote something they do not literally say, yet both the
actor and the recipient get

the message.”

Planned Parenthood of

Columbia/Williamette, Inc. v. American Coalition of Life Activists, 290 F.3d 1058,
1085 (9th Cir. 2002). When communications containing such images are sent
privately and targeted at a single individual—as is the case here—it further supports
the conclusion that a threat exists. Id. at 1085-86. Viewed in full context, images
such as those Mr. Sorensen directed to Ms. Hammer are not political hyperbole, nor
are they merely vituperative, abusive, and inexact. Id. at 1085. Consequently, the
act of sending such images is conduct, not speech.

Id. at 1087.

Holding

Mr. Sorensen accountable for communicating these images to intimidate
Ms. Hammer from advocating for the Second Amendment is proper and does not
impinge on legitimate protest or advocacy. Id. at 1088.

{BC00167074:1}

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 11 of 18

V.

Harassment Can Be Enjoined
As set forth above (pp. 5-6), harassment is actionable and can be enjoined.

Kimball, 682 So.2d at 639; Gilbreath, 650 So.2d at 12; see also Murrell v. The
Florida Bar, 122 So.2d 169 (Fla. 1960). Moreover, this suit falls into the class of
cases where equity compels a remedy. The availability of injunctive relief to protect
personal liberty (regardless of the label under which it is sought) is not novel:
Personal liberty and private property are fundamental
rights in this country. The very purpose of law is to protect
these rights. Any unlawful interference with them by false
statement, acts of coercion, intimidation, malice or overt
implications that threaten mischief or injury to them may
be enjoined.
Paramount Enterprises v. Mitchell, 140 So. 328, 332-33 (Fla. 1932).
Ms. Hammer’s claim for harassment against Mr. Sorensen is valid because his
e-mails are a form of intimidation and threats against her for her political views and
intended to chill her free speech. Hammer’s First Amendment rights are not just
part of her personal liberty; her free speech is also a public right the First Amendment
protects. Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 574 (1980) (stating
that freedom of speech, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government
for a redress of grievances are “expressly guaranteed freedoms [which] share a
common core purpose of assuring freedom of communication on matters relating to
the functioning of government.”); Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 389 (1967)

{BC00167074:1}

11

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 12 of 18

(freedom of the press is guaranteed “not for the benefit of the press so much as for
the benefit of all of us”).
An aggrieved party can assert a cognizable claim for injunctive relief
prohibiting harassment based on criminal acts accompanied by a recognized ground
for equitable relief, such as protecting public rights. Kamau v. State, 2012 WL
5390001, *8 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 1, 2012); Polonczyk v. Gates, 2017 WL 1164726, *5
(N.D. Fla. Mar. 16, 2017); Syfo Water Co. v. Chakoff, 182 So.2d 17, 18 (Fla. 3d
DCA 1966). Syfo recognizes that “where intervention of equity is warranted to
protect civil rights or property interests and where criminal prosecution is inadequate
to effect this purpose, a crime or statutory offense may be enjoined.” 182 So.2d at
18-19. A subsequent decision by Florida’s Third DCA clarified that even though
threatened acts might result in criminal violations, this should not prevent an equity
court from exercising its traditional jurisdiction, “particularly”6 when it is alleged
that the law enforcement agencies refused to take legal cognizance of the alleged
threatened criminal action. Drake v. Henson, 448 So.2d 1205, 1206 (Fla. 3d DCA
1984). In analyzing Syfo, Florida’s First DCA recognized that “[o]ur state, therefore,
has fallen in step with the broadly accepted doctrine that ‘where an injunction is
necessary for the protection of public rights … or welfare, the criminality of the acts

“Particularly” denotes that unheeded complaints to law enforcement are not a
requisite to relief.
6

{BC00167074:1}

12

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 13 of 18

complained of does not bar the remedy by injunction, and the court will consider the
criminality of the act only to determine whether, under the particular circumstances,
equitable intervention is necessary.’” State Bd. of Funeral Directors and Embalmers
of Fla. v. Evans, 256 So.2d 574, 577 (Fla. 1st DCA 1972) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).
Mr. Sorensen’s reliance upon Khani, Cummings, and Scelta [Motion p. 8] is
misplaced. Khami and Cummings, like Harvick, involved pro se parties who
presumably did not raise the legal arguments set forth herein before their claims for
harassment were dismissed. Certainly, these decisions do not analyze any of the
precedent set forth above. Khami baldly cites to Cummings. And Cummings is
devoid of any description of the allegations supporting the “actionable harassment”
claim, as well as any legal analysis supporting the dismissal. Scelta specifically
addresses a claim for “common law sexual harassment” based on an “underlying
wrong allegedly committed by an employee in a negligent supervision or negligent
retention claim.” 57 F.Supp.2d at 1338, 1348 (emphasis added). That claim is not
at issue here.
These cases Mr. Sorensen relies upon are markedly different than this case.
They all involve specious clams (mostly by pro se claimants) that factually lacked
justification for the law to afford relief. Here, the facts at issue compel a remedy
which the law should and does provide. The very purpose of law is to protect

{BC00167074:1}

13

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 14 of 18

personal liberties and rights, such as those Ms. Hammer alleges were violated.
Paramount, 140 So. at 332-33. Consequently, Mr. Sorensen’s unlawful interference
with those rights is actionable harassment that can and should be enjoined. Id.
VI.

The “Impact Rule” Does Not Bar Hammer’s Claim
Mr. Sorensen incorrectly seeks refuge under the “impact rule,” which he

claims bars any action for emotional distress if the distress did not result from
physical harm. This argument fails because the impact rule “does not apply to
recognized intentional torts that result in predominantly emotional damages,
including the intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, and invasion
of privacy.” Rowell v. Holt, 850 So.2d 474, 478 N. 1 (Fla. 2003) (internal citations
omitted). “[T]o recover damages for mental or emotional distress for a negligence
claim, the injury must flow from a physical injury or physical impact.” Jenks v.
Naples Community Hospital, Inc., 829 F.Supp.2d 1235, 1257 (M.D. Fla. 2011)
(emphasis added).
The impact rule simply does not apply to recognized torts in which damages
often are predominantly emotional, such as intentional infliction of emotional
distress and invasion of privacy. Rowell, 850 So.2d at 478; see also, Kush v. Loyd,
616 So.2d 415, 422 (Fla. 1992) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 569, 570,
652H cmt.b (1977)).

{BC00167074:1}

14

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 15 of 18

VII. Ms. Hammer’s Intentional Tort Claims Are Actionable
Florida law governing intentional infliction of emotional distress recognizes
that this tort compels a remedy when revilement is inflicted upon victims such as
Hammer. Nims v. Harrison, 768 So.2d 1198, 1201 (Fla. 1st DCA 2000). Conduct
sufficient to state a claim for the intentional infliction tort has been described as
“intentionally harmful conduct which would otherwise go unpunished, and which,
in cause and effect, can hardly be distinguished from other intentional torts such as
assault.” Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson, 429 So.2d 1287 (Fla. 4th DCA
1983), approved in part, quashed in part, 467 So.2d 277 (Fla. 1985). Mr. Sorensen’s
conduct qualifies and should not go unpunished.
The outrageousness requirement for this tort has been met in situations
involving displaying autopsy photos (Williams, infra) and vicious verbal attacks.
Dependable Life Insurance Co. v. Harris, 510 So.2d 985 (Fla. 5th DCA 1987).
Severe emotional distress exists when no reasonable person should be expected to
endure it. Restatement Second, Torts § 46; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson,
467 So.2d 277, 278 (Fla. 1985). No reasonable person should be expected to endure
the distress caused by opening an innocuously titled email only to immediately be
forced to view photos of mutilated bodies7 sent to intimidate, harass, and threaten.

Mr. Sorensen’s supposition about whether Ms. Hammer would be “surprised” by
the photos he sent is offensive and irrelevant to a motion to dismiss. Ms. Hammer’s
7

{BC00167074:1}

15

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 16 of 18

Mr. Sorensen’s suggestion [Motion p. 11] that anyone with knowledge of firearms
is somehow automatically immune to the distress caused by being forced to look at
dead and mutilated bodies is patently absurd.
An intrusion upon seclusion claim is not as limited as Mr. Sorensen suggests.
Mr. Sorensen concedes that this tort has been extended to electronic intrusions into
one’s solitude. See Motion pp. 12-13; see also Zirena v. Capital One Bank (USA)
NA, No. 11-24158-CIV, 2012 WL 843489 at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2, 2012) (defining
the intrusion tort as including electronically intruding into one’s private quarters and
holding that harassing phone calls were actionable).

Ms. Hammer received

Mr. Sorensen’s e-mails at her personal (AOL) e-mail address. By opening them,
she unwillingly was exposed to images she did not want to see. There is a recognized
interest in “protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home [which]
is certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society.” Gilbreath, 650 So.2d
at 12 (citing Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 471 (1980). The intrusion upon
seclusion tort serves to protect this recognized interest:
One important aspect of residential privacy is protection
of the unwilling listener [or here, viewer]. Although in
many locations, we expect individuals simply to avoid
speech they do not want to hear, the home is
different…[A] special benefit of the privacy all citizens
enjoy within their own walls, which the State may legislate
to protect, is an ability to avoid intrusions. Thus, we have
advocacy for the Second Amendment has no correlation to exposure to the gruesome
photos of crime victims Mr. Sorensen apparently peruses on the Internet.
{BC00167074:1}

16

Case 4:18-cv-00329-RH-CAS Document 29 Filed 10/04/18 Page 17 of 18

repeatedly held that individuals are not required to
welcome unwanted speech into their own homes and that
the government may protect this freedom.
Id. at 12-13 (citing Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 484-85 (1988)). Ms. Hammer
should not be forced to welcome and accept the intrusion of Mr. Sorensen’s
unwanted e-mails. Her claim for intrusion upon seclusion should proceed.
CONCLUSION
Mr. Sorensen engaged in actionable conduct that the First Amendment does
not protect. His hindsight, self-serving claim that he intended to engage in a dialogue
about gun control or a form of public protest does not matter at the dismissal stage
and, in any event, contradicts the content, manner and method of his
communications to Ms. Hammer. As a society, we should not tolerate this type of
behavior. The longer we turn a blind eye to it, the more prevalent and outrageous
this conduct will become.
Respectfully submitted, this 4th day of October, 2018.
