PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND
I.

INTRODUCTION

Pleadings in this case were to be amended by May 1, 2014 and discovery closed on June
25, 2014. On September 3, 2014, Plaintiffs moved to strike factual assertions in FreightCar’s
summary judgment response that were contrary to admissions in a preliminary injunction
opposition and supporting affidavit filed by FreightCar on September 18, 2013 and similar
admissions in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by FreightCar on March 1, 2014. See
Dkt. #142. In response to Plaintiffs’ motion, FreightCar did not seek to amend the admissions in
its complaint but instead elected to rely exclusively on legal arguments in a brief. See Dkt. #158.
The Court accordingly was obliged to review FreightCar’s admissions and decide the legal

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 2 of 18

arguments, ultimately devoting five pages of its March 31, 2015 summary judgment ruling
(“Summary Judgment Ruling”) to explaining why FreightCar would be bound by the admissions
in its preliminary injunction submission and First Amended Complaint. Dkt. #161 at 21-25.
Now, almost a year after the pleadings closed and discovery closed, and less than four
months before trial, and only after the Court issued its ruling on summary judgment, FreightCar
seeks leave to amend its complaint with factual assertions supposedly “uncovered through
discovery” in order to undo the admissions in its First Amended Complaint. FreightCar
Memorandum in Support of Leave to Amend (“FreightCar Br.”) at 2. Glaring in its response is
FreightCar’s failure to cite a single fact that it learned in discovery.
Plaintiffs’ Concise Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Dkt. #125 (“Plaintiffs’
Facts”) identified FreightCar’s admissions on July 18, 2014. FreightCar’s Response to
Statement of Facts (Dkt. #136) countered Plaintiffs’ Facts exclusively with purported
information it did not obtain in discovery but rather through new averments from its own
witnesses, a 2003 deposition transcript of another of its witnesses, and the basic documents in
this case which were of record long before discovery commenced.
FreightCar’s timing alone provides ample basis to deny amendment. If FreightCar in fact
learned through discovery that the admissions in its complaint were false, it should have sought
leave to amend last June when discovery closed. At a minimum, FreightCar should have moved
to amend last September when Plaintiffs filed their motion seeking to bind FreightCar to its
admissions and thus specifically informed FreightCar that its new factual assertions contradicted
its established admissions. Instead, it waited eight months before seeking leave to amend.
Furthermore, FreightCar fails to refer, even once, to the admissions it repeated in its
September 2013 preliminary injunction opposition and the affidavit that FreightCar proffered to

2

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 3 of 18

this Court as evidentiary support. The Court relied on these preliminary injunction admissions
(see, e.g., Summary Judgment Ruling at 24, 25, 42). While FreightCar has filed a Motion to
Reconsider on other matters, FreightCar does not ask the Court to reconsider its conclusion that
FreightCar is bound by its preliminary injunction admissions. See Dkt. #178. Accordingly,
granting FreightCar leave to file an amended complaint would achieve nothing because
FreightCar would still be bound by the same facts contained in its preliminary injunction
admissions.
II.
A.

PERTINENT BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Commencement Of The Litigation And FreightCar’s Preliminary Injunction
Admissions
FreightCar commenced this litigation on July 8, 2013 by filing its original Complaint

against individual retirees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Plaintiffs filed their own action in this Court, and moved for a preliminary injunction.
FreightCar opposed this motion with a 47-page brief (“FreightCar PI Opp.”) filed September 18,
2013. FreightCar supported its opposition with the August 7, 2002 Affidavit of Mark J. Duray
(Dkt. #60-2) (“Duray Affidavit”), Vice President of Human Resources, who had worked at the
plant in various human resources management roles since 1998. See Duray Affidavit ¶ 1.
Effective November 1, 2013, FreightCar eliminated all of the retiree benefits at issue in
this case. Class members have been without their health and life insurance benefits since that
date.
B.

Plaintiffs’ First Summary Judgment Motion, FreightCar’s First Amended
Complaint, The Court’s Rule 16 Scheduling Order, And Discovery
Plaintiffs first moved for summary judgment on February 2, 2014. Plaintiffs’ summary

judgment brief (Dkt. #83) and Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. #85) both relied extensively

3

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 4 of 18

on the same FreightCar admissions that Plaintiffs relied on to support their second summary
judgment motion, filed last summer. See, e.g., Dkt. #85 ¶ 18 (relying on Mr. Duray’s averment
that “JAC was obligated to mirror the Bethlehem benefit plans”); id. ¶ 44 (relying on
FreightCar’s admission in the Deemer case that from 1991 through 1997, it was bound by the
Continuation of Coverage clause). FreightCar thus was on notice at least as of February 2, 2014
that Plaintiffs’ theories of this case were premised in part on FreightCar admissions.
On March 1, 2014, FreightCar filed its First Amended Complaint (Dkt. #142). In this
pleading, FreightCar reiterated the admissions that FreightCar proffered to the Court as factual
support for its preliminary injunction opposition. See, e.g., FAC ¶ 26 (“…Johnstown America
entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the USW and agreed in a side letter to the
collective bargaining agreement (“Side Letter 22”) to ‘create mirror bargaining unit employee
benefit plans material in all respects to the Bethlehem plans they replace.’ The Bethlehem plans
in question provided for medical benefits to retirees or surviving spouses and life insurance
benefits to retirees ‘so long as the individual remains retired from the Company or receives a
Surviving Spouse’s benefit, notwithstanding the expiration of [the Bethlehem plans], except as
the Company and the Union may otherwise agree’”); id. ¶ 27 (“Pursuant to Side Letter 22, from
1991 until 1997 Johnstown America provided medical and life insurance benefits which mirrored
the benefits provided by the Bethlehem plans”).
In accordance with the parties’ jointly prepared Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f) Joint Report and the
Court’s April 3, 2014 scheduling Order, the deadline to amend pleadings was May 1, 2014. See
Dkt. #94 at 5; Dkt. #100 at 2.
Thereafter, the parties engaged in three months of discovery, which closed on June 25,
2014. Plaintiffs had argued that no discovery was necessary on the ground that thorough

4

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 5 of 18

discovery had been taken in the Deemer litigation, and that the case should proceed to dispositive
motions in the interest of expeditious resolution. Nonetheless, in a spirit of compromise, the
parties agreed to a limited discovery period. Plaintiffs took no discovery themselves partly in
reliance on the facts that FreightCar long has admitted not only through March 2014 in this
proceeding but also in the original litigation before Judge Cindrich. For example, if Plaintiffs
had known that FreightCar would deny its long-repeated admission that JAC was obligated to
mirror the Bethlehem benefit plans and the Continuation of Coverage provision, Plaintiffs would
have sought discovery into the basis for FreightCar’s new position.
C.

Plaintiffs’ Second Summary Judgment Motion And FreightCar’s Response To
Plaintiffs’ Proffer Of Its Admissions
One month after discovery closed, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment

on July 17, 2014. As in their February 2, 2014 Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. #85),
Plaintiffs’ July 18, 2014 Facts (“Plaintiffs’ Facts”) proffered and relied on a series of FreightCar
admissions. See Dkt. #125. In its August 22, 2014 Response to Plaintiffs’ Statement of
Undisputed Facts (“FreightCar’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Facts”) (Dkt. #136), FreightCar sought
to refute the admissions that this Court ultimately found to be binding solely on the basis of the
July 17, 2014 Declaration of its former attorney Claud L. McIver; the July 15, 2014 Declaration
of another of its former attorneys, Robert C. Christenson; the December 18, 2003 deposition
transcript of its former Vice President, Mark Duray; and basic documents like the Mirroring
Agreement that Plaintiffs filed with their original July 2013 Complaint.
To wit, Plaintiffs asserted the undisputed fact that FreightCar admitted through its proffer
of the Duray Affidavit that “JAC was obligated to mirror the Bethlehem benefit plans.”
Plaintiffs’ Facts ¶ 14. FreightCar sought to deny this admission solely on the basis of citations to
Mr. Duray’s December 18, 2003 deposition transcript. FreightCar Response ¶ 14. An April 8,
5

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 6 of 18

2014 letter from FreightCar’s current counsel reflects that counsel had received Mr. Duray’s
deposition transcript from FreightCar’s prior counsel.
In response to Plaintiffs’ proffer of FreightCar’s admission that “the Bethlehem Plans that
were to be mirrored included the Continuation of Coverage language,” FreightCar cited Side
Letter 22 and the Bethlehem PHMB (FreightCar Response ¶ 19), both of which Plaintiffs filed as
exhibits to their July 7, 2013 Complaint. See Dkt. #1-4. In response to Plaintiffs’ proffer of
FreightCar’s admission that Side Letter 22 was carried forward in the 1994 CBA, FreightCar
cited nothing but averments in its own former attorney’s July 2014 Declaration. See FreightCar
Response ¶ 66 (citing FreightCar’s Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. #119) ¶ 56, which in
turn cited nothing but Mr. McIver’s Declaration). FreightCar admitted to the truth of its
admission in Mr. Duray’s Affidavit that “There was no change in the 1994 CBA that is pertinent
to this case.” FreightCar Response ¶ 67. In response to Plaintiffs’ proffer of FreightCar’s
admission that it was bound by the Mirroring Agreement through 1997, FreightCar cited the
Declarations of its two attorneys, Mr. McIver and Mr. Christenson, as well as the 2002 Affidavit
of Raymond Jastrzab, which Plaintiffs’ filed as an exhibit to their July 7, 2013 Complaint. See
Dkt. #1-9.
In sum, in denying its admissions, FreightCar did not rely on anything that it learned in
discovery.
D.

The Court’s Summary Judgment Ruling And FreightCar’s Motion For Leave To
Amend
In its March 31, 2015 Summary Judgment Ruling, the Court ruled that FreightCar has

made, inter alia, the following binding admissions:
1. “‘…JAC was obligated to mirror the Bethlehem benefit plans…”‘ Op. at 24
(quoting Duray Aff. ¶ 6).

6

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 7 of 18

2. “The Bethlehem Plans that were to be mirrored included the Continuation of
Coverage language.” Op. at 24 (citing FAC ¶ 26).
3. The 1994 CBA “‘carried forward’” Side Letter 22. Op. at 24-25 (quoting Duray
Aff. ¶ 9 and FreightCar PI Opp. at 6-7)
4. “‘There was no change in the 1994 CBA that is pertinent to this case.’” Op. at 42
(quoting Duray Aff. ¶ 7).
5. “‘Pursuant to Side Letter 22, from 1991 until 1997 Johnstown America provided
medical and life insurance benefits which mirrored the benefits provided by the
Bethlehem plans.’” Op. at 24 (quoting FAC ¶ 27).
On April 22, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to confirm that FreightCar would be
precluded from offering argument or evidence contrary to the admissions that the Court has
concluded are binding on FreightCar. Dkt. #175. On April 28, 2015, FreightCar filed its Motion
for Leave to File Amended Complaint (Dkt. #179) and Motion for Reconsideration (Dkt. #177).
In its first motion, FreightCar asks the Court to grant it leave to file a Second Amended
Complaint. For the Court’s convenience, Plaintiffs attach a compare version reflecting the
changes FreightCar seeks to make at Exhibit A hereto. The compare document reflects that
FreightCar now seeks to stake out positions diametrically at odds with its prior admissions.
Finally, FreightCar seeks in some cases to amend its contentions even beyond the
positions it took in its summary judgment pleadings. For example, FreightCar asserted in the
FAC that its position in 2002 was that “it could reduce or eliminate the retiree medical and life
insurance benefits subject to the terms of the Plan, with which it has complied.” See FAC ¶ 4.
FreightCar now seeks to revise its 2002 position as follows: “FreightCar maintained that nothing
prohibited it from terminating the Retirees’ medical and life insurance benefits.” Proposed SAC
¶ 4. This emphatically was not FreightCar’s position in 2002, and FreightCar did not claim to
the contrary in its summary judgment submission. Plaintiffs should not be obliged to litigate this
issue at this stage of these proceedings.
7

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 8 of 18

In its motion to reconsider, FreightCar seeks the Court’s review of the plain language of
the mirroring agreement and seeks to create a subclass of retirees who retired after 1997. See
FreightCar’s Reconsideration Brief (Dkt. #178). Neither of FreightCar’s motions asks the Court
to reconsider or otherwise revisit its conclusion that FreightCar is bound by the admissions in its
preliminary injunction submission. See, e.g., id. (“the point of this motion is not to relitigate
issues that this Court has already decided.”).
III.
A.

ARGUMENT

Amendment Should Be Denied Due To FreightCar’s Delay
Eleven months after the deadline for amending pleadings, ten months after the close of

discovery, eight months after Plaintiffs sought to bind FreightCar to its admissions, and one
month after the Court agreed with Plaintiffs that FreightCar should be bound, FreightCar seeks to
amend its complaint, renounce its admissions, and dramatically alter this case four months before
trial based entirely on new factual assertions it supposedly discovered (though it fails to show
how or when) during discovery which ended in June, 2014. The Motion to Amend should be
denied.
B.

Amendment Should Be Denied Because Freightcar Has Not Established Good
Cause Under Rule 16
FreightCar argues that the Court should evaluate its motion for leave to amend under the

liberal pleading standards of Rule 15(a). FreightCar Br. at 2. Putting aside whether Rule 15(a)
should supply the only constraint after judicial resources have been expended resolving the

8

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 9 of 18

impact of a party’s admissions,1 FreightCar ignores that it seeks to violate the Court’s scheduling
order.
The Court’s Rule 16 scheduling order adopted the parties’ May 1, 2014 deadline for
amending the pleadings. Dkt. #100 at 2; Dkt. #94 at 5. As this Court has explained, Rule 16
standards are implicated “when, as in this case, the deadline for seeking leave to amend the
pleadings has passed under the court’s Rule 16 scheduling order.” Covertech Fabricating, Inc. v.
TVM Bldg. Products, Inc., 2014 WL 2199843, at *2 (W.D. Pa. May 27, 2014) (Gibson, J.). Rule
16(b)(4) states that “[a] schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge’s
consent.” (Emphasis added). Accordingly, “[b]efore evaluating a proposed amendment under
Rule 15(a)…the court must evaluate whether the party seeking leave has shown ‘good cause’ to
modify the scheduling order. 2014 WL 2199843, at *2.
“In contrast to Rule 15(a), the good cause standard under Rule 16(b) hinges on diligence
of the movant, and not on prejudice to the non-moving party.” Id. (citations omitted). As
another court in this District has explained, “‘[T]o the extent that other federal rules, such as
Rule 15 governing pleading amendments, contain a more lenient standard than good cause, the
Rule 16(b) standard controls any decisions to alter a scheduling order for purposes of making
pleading amendments and it must be satisfied before determining whether an amendment should
be permitted under Rule 15.’” Hawkins v. W. Penn Allegheny Health System, 2014 WL

1

Given that FreightCar had every opportunity to seek leave to amend before the Court decided
Plaintiffs’ motion seeking to bind FreightCar to its admissions but failed to do so, FreightCar’s
belated motion should be treated as a motion to reconsider the Court’s admissions ruling.
Plaintiffs set forth the standards governing motions to reconsider in their Opposition to
FreightCar’s motion to reconsider.

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 10 of 18

5803112, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 7, 2014) (quoting Wright, Miller & Kane, 6A Fed. Prac. & Proc.
Civ. § 1522.2 (3d ed. 2010)).
“Good cause” focuses on the diligence of the party seeking the modification of the
scheduling order. Ferencz v. Medlock, 2013 WL 6230626, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 2, 2013)
(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, Advisory Committee Note (1983) (“[T]he court may modify the
schedule on a showing of good cause if it cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the
party seeking the extension.”)). Thus, if a party was not diligent, there is no “good cause” to
amend a scheduling order. 2013 WL 6230626, at *3. The party seeking to modify a scheduling
order bears the burden of demonstrating good cause. Trask v. Olin Corp., 298 F.R.D. 244, 267
(W.D. Pa. 2014).
After arguing for six pages that Rule 15 governs its motion for leave to amend,
FreightCar makes a cursory argument regarding good cause, wholly without reference to Rule
16(b) and the fact that its proposed amendment would violate the Court’s scheduling order.
FreightCar Br. at 5-11. FreightCar’s argument fails.
FreightCar first claims that it had no basis for knowing that facts admitted in its First
Amended Complaint and injunction opposition would be found to be admissions or otherwise of
import in the case. FreightCar Br. at 10-11. In fact, however, both Plaintiffs’ February 2, 2014
and July 17, 2014 summary judgment submissions relied on precisely these facts and left no
doubt that Plaintiffs’ case for entry of judgment in their favor rested in part on FreightCar’s
admissions. If there were any doubt on this score, they were laid to rest by Plaintiffs’ September
3, 2014 Motion to Strike, wherein Plaintiffs, with great specificity, asked the Court to strike
FreightCar denials and set forth the applicable standard of law on judicial admissions.. Dkt.
#142. FreightCar’s claim that it “had no reason to believe” that the Court might bind it to its

10

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 11 of 18

admissions lacks merit where this is precisely what Plaintiffs, with legal and factual support,
asked the Court to do.
FreightCar’s second reason is equally unsupportable. FreightCar claims that it
“reasonably focused on evidence learned through discovery in its summary judgment motion
rather than statements made in pre-discovery pleadings.” FreightCar Br. at 11. As shown,
FreightCar has failed to point to any evidence it learned through discovery as the basis for its
eleventh hour denial of its long-repeated admissions. And again, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike
adequately served to direct FreightCar’s focus to its First Amended Complaint and response to
the preliminary injunction motion.
FreightCar’s third claimed reason for good cause is a non sequitor: FreightCar complains
that Plaintiffs sought to bind FreightCar to admissions made by its former counsel during the
Deemer litigation. FreightCar Br. at 11. This point is immaterial because the Court bound
FreightCar solely to the admissions made under the auspices of its current counsel in the current
litigation.
None of this remotely amounts to good cause. FreightCar has not met its burden of
establishing that it was diligent, and the procedural history shows that it was not.
McWreath v. Range Resources--Appalachia, LLC, 2015 WL 321651, at *20 (W.D.Pa.
Jan. 26, 2015), is instructive. The court concluded that Rule 16(b) good cause was absent,
explaining that it “has denied several untimely attempts to amend pleadings in situations where
the parties had sufficient access to information to assert claims earlier in litigation.”
Here, FreightCar seeks to amend after denying its admissions on the basis of the
averments of its former attorneys, a 2003 transcript of the deposition of its Vice President, and
documents attached to Plaintiffs’ original complaint. FreightCar thus has long had more than

11

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 12 of 18

sufficient access to the information that it now seeks to include in the proposed Second Amended
Complaint – it could have interviewed its own witnesses including Mr. Duray at any time in this
litigation, and most of the documents relied on by FreightCar were attached to Plaintiffs’ original
complaint. FreightCar has not established good cause and leave to amend should be denied.
C.

Even If FreightCar Could Demonstrate Good Cause Under Rule 16(b), Amendment
Should Be Denied Under Rule 15(a)
Even if FreightCar could establish Rule 16(b) good cause, amendment still should be

denied under Rule 15(a) because of the prejudice class members will suffer if amendment is
allowed at this late date.
This Court’s ruling in Covertech shows why. After the defendant filed an amended
counterclaim three months after the deadline to amend the pleadings, the Court ruled that even if
the defendant “could show good cause under Rule 16, the amendment would still be disallowed
under Rule 15 because of the undue prejudice to Covertech.” 2014 WL 2199843, at *2. The
Court explained that Rule 15 prejudice may result where an amendment would require the reopening of discovery, delay resolution of the case, or unnecessarily increase the cost of litigation.
Id. (citing Cureton v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 252 F.3d 267, 273 (3d Cir. 2001)). The
Court held that the plaintiff would be prejudiced because the defendant had already filed an
amended pleading and the plaintiff had “invested significant time and expense” in filing a partial
motion to dismiss. To permit the defendant to file a second amended pleading would
unnecessarily delay the litigation and result in needless additional costs to the plaintiff in having
to file yet another responsive pleading or motion.
This analysis applies here. If FreightCar is permitted to file a second amended complaint,
Plaintiffs would be denied the opportunity to take discovery on any of FreightCar’s new
assertions, and will be obliged to go to trial in August 2015 without having tested FreightCar’s
12

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 13 of 18

assertions by, for example, taking the depositions of the two former FreightCar attorneys whose
declarations form the principal basis for FreightCar’s attempt to refute its former admissions.
FreightCar has admitted that a party is prejudiced “if their inability to present evidence at
trial is attributable to their reliance on the admission.” FreightCar Br. at 9. In reliance on
FreightCar’s admissions, Plaintiffs did not seek discovery on such matters as FreightCar’s new
contention that it was never bound by the Continuation of Coverage clause. Plaintiffs
accordingly cannot cross-examine FreightCar’s witnesses with their deposition testimony on this
point.
This case involves several hundred retirees whose retiree insurance benefits have been
terminated. As the Court has recognized, “it is in the interests of all parties to proceed with this
litigation as expeditiously as possible.” Memorandum and Order denying transfer (Dkt. # 73) at
17. In recognition of this, Plaintiffs worked to ensure a streamlined discovery process and
acquiesced to the dismissal without prejudice of their motion for preliminary injunction. If
FreightCar is permitted to evade its admissions, Plaintiffs will face a Hobson’s choice between
seeking to stay the trial to take appropriate discovery, leading to still further delay for class
members, and going to trial without having taken discovery on FreightCar’s new factual
contentions.
Hayes v. Prism Career Institute, 2014 WL 1414371 (E.D.Pa. April 11, 2014), is on point.
The plaintiffs there sought to amend their complaint before the end of discovery, to conform
their pleading to their own deposition testimonies. Id. at *4. The court denied the motion
because the plaintiffs had long had full knowledge of the facts supporting their new claims. The
court explained that “[t]he fact that plaintiffs’ counsel did not apprise himself of this information
until he prepared the plaintiffs for their depositions in 2014 is not an acceptable excuse for the

13

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 14 of 18

delay.” Id. Here, FreightCar filed its Complaint in 2013 and had every opportunity to consult its
own former attorneys and Vice President for Human Resources but has waited until now to seek
leave to amend. As in Hays, a failure to interview one’s own witnesses in a timely fashion is not
an acceptable excuse for delay.
Finally, other grounds that justify denial of leave to amend include undue delay, bad
faith, dilatory motive, prejudice, and futility. Harris v. Doe, 2015 WL 1444913, at *1 (W.D. Pa.
March 30, 2015) (quoting Shane v. Fauver, 213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2000)). Plaintiffs explain
in the preceding section why FreightCar’s pursuit of this issue has been marred by undue delay.
FreightCar’s claim that it will suffer prejudice amounts to nil. Aside from the fact that
prejudice to the moving party forms no part of the controlling considerations set forth by the
Court, any “prejudice” is entirely of FreightCar’s own making. It has proffered the Affidavit of
its own witness prepared close in time to the events at hand and at a time when the critical
importance of the timeline was apparent to all. Neither that witness, nor any of FreightCar’s
other witnesses or attorneys, believed that FreightCar’s new set of alternative facts was worthy
of mention. FreightCar will not be prejudiced if the Court disregards its decade-late factual
assertions that fly in the face of the factual averments that FreightCar has repeated throughout
this case.
FreightCar relies extensively on Schomburg v. Dow Jones & Co., Inc., 504 Fed. Appx.
100, 104 (3d Cir. 2012) (unpublished), which did not address the Rule 16(b) threshold showing
that FreightCar must make here. FreightCar Br. at 3, 5. In Schomburg, the plaintiff asserted that
he received an EEOC notice on March 18, 2011, but inadvertently wrote the date as March 8
because, as a first-time litigant, he was nervous while filling out the form complaint at the
courthouse. Id. at 104. It goes without saying that this is a far different scenario than here,

14

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 15 of 18

where experienced counsel repeatedly admitted to the same set of facts, and did so on the basis
of, inter alia, the sworn affidavit of one of the party’s key witnesses.
Beyond this, Schomburg merely held that amendment should not be disallowed merely
because an existing allegation constitutes a judicial admission – the district court in Schomburg
had not already, in the face of the party’s contrary summary judgment contentions, concluded
that the party making the admission would be bound by that admission. Furthermore, the
plaintiff in Schomburg sought to amend to correct a factual inadequacy at the very outset of the
case, in response to a motion to dismiss. Id. at 105. The prejudice there does not compare with
the circumstances faced by a party seeks to renounce their admissions long after discovery closed
and on the eve of trial.2
Somewhat incredibly, FreightCar quotes Lyons v. Beard, 2011 WL 2460930, *8 (M.D.
Pa. 2011), as follows: “[T]he Court cannot perceive how Plaintiff will be unfairly prejudiced by
the discrete amendments proposed, as it appears clearly that these amended answers will be
entirely consistent with Defendants’ litigation position throughout this action—a position that
Plaintiff has clearly understood.” FreightCar Br. at 8. FreightCar’s proposed new facts are of

2

The cases from other Circuits cited by FreightCar also do not advance its cause. None were
decided on the basis of Rule 16(b), and in none had the court already concluded that a party
should be bound by its admissions. Beyond this, the 1977 Eighth Circuit case cited by
FreightCar, Beeck v. Aquaslide ‘N’ Dive Corp., 562 F.2d 537, 539 (8th Cir. 1977), held that the
district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the defendant leave to amend where the
defendant’s admission was based on the conclusions of three insurance companies. In the 1945
Second Circuit case, Voltmann v. United Fruit Co., 147 F.2d 514 (2d Cir. 1945), the defendant
was permitted to modify an admission that “there was a severe storm, the seas were heavy, and
the said steamship pitched, tossed and rolled” to an admission that “the seas were heavy and the
steamship rolled.” Finally, in King v. Cooke, 26 F.3d 720, 722 (7th Cir. 1994), state defendants
mistakenly admitted to a prison inmate’s factual allegations; a magistrate judge found that the
admissions were merely a word processing error and that the defendants had otherwise indicated
that they denied liability. None of these cases involved a fact pattern like that here.

course entirely inconsistent with its litigation position throughout this action. This was the basis
for the Court’s ruling that FreightCar would be bound by its admissions, and FreightCar has not
asked the Court to reconsider this conclusion.
Unlike FreightCar’s cited authority, this case does not involve isolated facts carelessly
inserted in a complaint. FreightCar asserted the facts at issue here in its Complaint and First
Amended Complaint and also proffered these same facts and elaborated on them through
submission of a contemporary affidavit. In particular, FreightCar urged the Court to deny
Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction on the basis of, inter alia, the following sworn facts:


“…JAC was obligated to mirror the Bethlehem benefit plans…”;



“There was no change in the 1994 CBA that is pertinent to this case”;



“Going into the 1997 negotiations, JAC set as a goal to eliminate the side
letters which had accompanied the 1991 CBA (and been carried forward in the
1994 CBA)…”;



“In the give-and-take of [1997] negotiations, JAC achieved most of what it
sought. Specifically, it achieved the Union’s agreement to abrogate all of the
1991 side letters except numbers 4, 5, 13 and 26”;



“Having abrogated the Mirroring Agreement, in the 1997 CBA the parties
agreed that health and welfare benefits would thereafter be governed by the
terms of JAC’s Employee Guide… Thus, JAC and the Union installed JAC’s
Employee Guide [in the 1997 CBA] as the governing instrument in
replacement of any old Bethlehem plan or agreement”; and



“the bargaining unit employees (and their Union) had had over four years to
scrutinize JAC’s Employee Guide before enshrining it as the governing
document in the 1997 CBA.”

Duray Aff. ¶¶ 6, 9, 10, 11, 14.
In addition to relying on most of these Duray admissions, FreightCar’s Preliminary
Injunction Opposition also cited “the undisputed fact that before its abrogation in 1997,

16

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 17 of 18

FreightCar had continuing obligations under Side Letter 22.” FreightCar PI Opp. at 25.
FreightCar’s preliminary injunction brief admission continued:
The plain language of Side Letter 22 included this continuing obligation:
‘Johnstown America Corporation bargaining unit welfare plans will mirror
existing Bethlehem plans and shall be effective immediately after
closing….Johnstown America Corporation shall be responsible for all benefits
payable to its employees or retirees which arise or are based on events which
occurred after closing.”
FreightCar PI Opp. at 25 (emphasis in the original).
The motion to amend should be denied.

FreightCar Should Not Be Permitted To Present Evidence Contrary To Its
Admissions At Trial
In a footnote, FreightCar asserts that “some courts have found that amending judicial

admissions is not a prerequisite to presenting evidence to the contrary at trial.” FreightCar Br. at
1 n.2. To support this proposition, FreightCar cites Adani Exports Ltd. v. AMCI (EXPORT)
Corp., 2009 WL 2485370, at *8 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 7, 2009), where the court “notes that this is not
the first time that AMCI–Export has requested that the Court deem the referenced complaint
allegation as a judicial admission. The request was denied.” Here, of course, the Court did not
deny Plaintiffs’ motion seeking to bind FreightCar to its admissions – the Court granted that
motion.
FreightCar also cites Hartley v. Pocono Mt. Regl. Police Dept., 2009 WL 793034, at *4
(M.D. Pa. Mar. 24, 2009), where the court found that an admission was “plainly inadvertent” and
an “oversight”: after denying the premise of a constructive discharge claim, Defendants
admitted the allegation that “Plaintiff Hartley was constructively discharged.” Here,
FreightCar’s present counsel repeatedly relied on the same set of admissions which are at the

17

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 187 Filed 05/19/15 Page 18 of 18

heart of this case and which FreightCar’s prior counsel also asserted. This is not a case of mere
inadvertence or oversight.3
IV.

CONCLUSION

For these reasons, the Court should deny FreightCar’s motion for leave to amend.

In neither of the two cases from other circuits cited by FreightCar had the court already ruled
that a party would be bound by its admission. See Securities and Exch. Commn. v. Natl. Student
Mktg. Corp., 73 F.R.D. 444, 447 n.10 (D.D.C. 1977); Sicor Ltd. v. Cetus Corp., 51 F.3d 848,
