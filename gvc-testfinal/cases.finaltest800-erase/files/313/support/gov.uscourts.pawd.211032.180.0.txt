MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF LEAVE TO AMEND

I.

INTRODUCTION
In the Court’s March 30, 2015 ruling denying both parties’ respective motions for

summary judgment, the Court relied in part on what it deemed to be judicial admissions
FreightCar made in prior pleadings, including in its First Amended Complaint for Declaratory
Judgment (“FAC”).1 As the Court noted, however, “judicial admissions may be superseded by
amendment.”2 (ECF No. 161 at 22 (citing West Run Student Housing Associates, LLC v.

1

FreightCar reserves the right to dispute whether the statements relied upon by the Court qualify as judicial
admissions.
2
Some courts have found that amending judicial admissions is not a prerequisite to presenting evidence to the
contrary at trial. See Adani Exports LTD v. AMCI (EXPORT) Corp., No. 02:05-cv-0304, 2009 WL 2485370, at *7
(W.D. Pa. 2009) (denying motion in limine and allowing plaintiff to present evidence inconsistent with complaint
allegations); Hartley v. Pocono Mountain Regional Police Dept., No. 3:CV-04-2045, 2009 WL 793034, at *5 (M.D.
Pa. 2009) (finding that “the admission was not conclusive” for purposes of trial); Sicor Ltd. v. Cetus Corp., 51 F.3d
848, 861 (9th Cir. 1995) (“We conclude that Sicor retracted its judicial admission by subsequently recharacterizing
the [admission] in its opposition to CBVT’s motion for summary judgment.”); S.E.C. v. National Student Marketing
Corp., 73 F.R.D. 444, 447 n.10 (D.D.C. 1977) (“That the SEC seeks to have the pleadings deemed amended by its
pretrial brief rather than by filing a new complaint does not trouble the Court.”).

Huntington Nat. Bank, 712 F.3d 165, 171 (3d Cir. 2013).) In light of the Court’s ruling,
FreightCar requests leave to amend the FAC. Such amendments will supersede any statements
the Court relied on in its March 30, 2015 ruling, as well as conform the pleadings to evidence
uncovered through the discovery conducted in this case after FreightCar filed the FAC. See, e.g.,
S.E.C. v. National Student Marketing Corp., 73 F.R.D. 444, 445 (D.D.C. 1977) (granting leave
“to conform the pleadings to [] evidence unearthed by discovery”).
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), leave to amend should be freely granted
when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Courts have long recognized the appropriateness
of amending a complaint to modify statements therein when they are later discovered to be
inaccurate.3 Voltmann v. United Fruit Co., 147 F.2d 514, 516 (2d Cir. 1945) (affirming trial
court decision to allow a pleading admission to be withdrawn during trial); Hartley v. Pocono
Mountain Regional Police Dept., No. 3:CV-04-2045, 2009 WL 793034, at *5 (M.D. Pa. 2009)
(“Rule 15 . . . embraces a liberal policy toward allowing amendments to correct errors in the
pleadings [so as to advance] one of the basic objectives of the federal rules—the determination
of cases on their merits.”) (internal quotations omitted); Rhen v. Supreme SMA Operations, LP,
1:10-cv-2025, 2011 WL 2174054, at *2 (M.D. Pa. 2011) (finding leave to amend at the close of
discovery warranted) DAGS II, LLC v. Huntington Nat. Bank, N.A., No. 1:13-cv-393, 2013 WL
6884242, at *4-6 (W.D. Mich. 2013) (allowing party to withdraw pleading admission after
summary judgment). Only where there is evidence of “substantial or undue prejudice” to the
non-movant should leave to amend be denied. Lorenz v. CSX Corp., 1 F.3d 1406, 1413-14 (3d
Cir. 1993).

plaintiff to “vitiate its prior [pleading] admission and restate its absolute denial”).

Consistent with these principles, FreightCar’s motion for leave to amend should be
granted. FreightCar’s purpose in seeking to amend, namely to correct statements deemed to be
judicial admissions by this Court, has been identified as a proper basis for seeking leave to
amend. See Schomburg v. Dow Jones & Co., 504 Fed. Appx. 100, 104 (3d Cir. 2012)
(“Disallowing amendment merely because an existing allegation constitutes a judicial admission
is contrary to the liberal amendment policy embodied in Rule 15(a)(2).”). There is also “good
cause” to allow FreightCar to amend the FAC, and doing so would be consistent with Rule
15(a)’s liberal pleading requirements.
II.

BACKGROUND
On July 8, 2013, FreightCar filed a one count complaint in the United States District

Court for the Northern District of Illinois in which it requested a declaration that FreightCar had
the legal right to terminate retiree welfare benefits. FreightCar America, Inc. v. USW, et al.,
3:14-cv-00017-KRG (W.D. Pa.) (“Illinois Action”).4 In explaining the factual background
supporting its position, FreightCar relied in due part on the record in the prior litigation between
the parties over the same subject, Deemer v. Johnstown America Industries, Inc., 02-cv-0806
(W.D. Pa.). The following day, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in this Court asserting that
FreightCar’s termination of health and life insurance benefits violated the LMRA and ERISA.
Zanghi v. FreightCar America, Inc., 3:13-cv-00146-KRG (W.D. Pa.) (“Pennsylvania Action”).
After this Court denied FreightCar’s motion to transfer the Pennsylvania Action to the
Northern District of Illinois for consolidation with the Illinois Action, (ECF No. 73), the
Northern District of Illinois ordered that FreightCar’s lawsuit be transferred to the Western
District of Pennsylvania. (Illinois Action, ECF No. 113). On February 24, 2014, FreightCar was
4

After the Illinois Action was transferred to the Western District of Pennsylvania, a new case number was assigned.
Accordingly, the proceedings in the Illinois Action are available under case number 3:14-cv-00017-KRG in the
Western District of Pennsylvania.

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 180 Filed 04/28/15 Page 4 of 13

granted leave to amend its complaint to include a defendant class. (Illinois Action, ECF No.
120). FreightCar filed the FAC on March 1, 2014 (Illinois Action, ECF No. 122).
On April 3, 2014, the Court entered an initial case management scheduling order in
Plaintiffs’ suit. (ECF No. 100.) The Court’s scheduling order provided that: (1) the two cases
would be consolidated for all purposes; (2) the parties could take approximately ninety (90) days
of fact discovery, which was to be completed by June 25, 2014; (3) the parties would both file
motions for summary judgment by July 17, 2014; and (4) all other scheduling deadlines would
be governed by the parties’ Rule 26(f) report.5 (Id.)
On July 17, 2014, the parties filed their respective motions for summary judgment and
statements of undisputed fact. (ECF Nos. 117-126.) Following briefing in support of their own
motion, as well as in opposition to FreightCar’s summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs filed a
motion to strike certain denials of fact, which Plaintiffs claimed had been “admitted in multiple
contexts.” (ECF No. 145 at 1.) FreightCar filed its opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion to strike on
November 13, 2014 and addressed each of the purported “admissions.” (ECF No. 158.)
On March 30, 2015, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying both
parties’ respective motions for summary judgment. (ECF No. 161.) While the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion to strike on the grounds that it was procedurally improper, it found,
notwithstanding FreightCar’s support for each of the factual statements in its summary judgment
papers, that FreightCar was “judicially bound by its earlier admissions in pleadings and briefs
before this Court.” (Id. at 25.) The Court stated that it would “give due consideration to these
admissions in determining whether or not there is a genuine dispute of material fact in this

Consistent with Plaintiffs’ ongoing effort to limit FreightCar to the record in the Deemer litigation, Plaintiffs
rigorously opposed FreightCar’s request for discovery in these lawsuits. Plaintiffs themselves declined to seek any
discovery notwithstanding the interrogatories, document requests, and deposition notices FreightCar served on
Plaintiffs. (ECF No. 98 (letter brief disputing need for discovery).)

case.”6 (Id.) Among the pleading allegations the Court construed as “judicial admissions” were
a number of allegations related to the nature of the parties’ agreement prior to the negotiation and
execution of the 1997 CBA between FreightCar and the United Steelworkers of America
(“USW”). (Id at 22-25.) While FreightCar maintains that summary judgment in its favor is
appropriate notwithstanding the Court’s finding of judicial admissions, FreightCar seeks leave to
amend the statements deemed to be admissions to reflect the evidence FreightCar obtained
through discovery in this action, which FreightCar set forth in its motion for summary judgment.
III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Parties are Permitted to Withdraw Judicial Admissions by Amending
Pleadings

The Third Circuit has instructed that parties may amend pleading allegations that would
otherwise be construed as judicial admissions. In Schomburg v. Dow Jones & Co., 504 Fed.
Appx. 100 (3d Cir. 2012), the Third Circuit reversed the district court’s decision refusing to
allow the plaintiff in a discrimination case to amend his complaint to correct a mistaken date
which ultimately caused the district court to dismiss his case. Id. at 102. The plaintiff’s original
complaint alleged that he had received an EEOC right-to-sue letter on March 8, 2011. Id. The
defendant moved to dismiss on the sole ground that the plaintiff’s action was untimely because
he had not filed suit within ninety days of receiving the right-to-sue letter. Id. In response, the
plaintiff filed a “supplemental pleading,” in which he stated that his complaint was timely
because he actually received the right-to-sue letter on March 18, 2011, not March 8, 2011. Id.
6

The Court’s ruling left some confusion as to the nature and source of FreightCar’s deemed admissions. In
particular, the Court’s citations were limited to the FAC and FreightCar’s response to Plaintiffs’ motion for a
preliminary injunction, including the Duray Affidavit attached thereto. (Pennsylvania Action, ECF No. 161 at 2225.) Plaintiffs, however, sought to strike FreightCar’s denials based on a number of other allegedly contrary
statements in pleadings, briefs, and filings from the Deemer litigation, FreightCar’s first-filed suit, and the abovecaptioned case. (ECF No. 145 at 23-29.) Furthermore, while the Court found that FreightCar had “concede[d] that
the Bethlehem plans that FreightCar agreed to mirror included the Continuation of Coverage language,” it is not
clear whether the Court deemed this a judicial admission, or rather, was making a factual finding based on other
evidence. (ECF No. 161 at 25.)

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 180 Filed 04/28/15 Page 6 of 13

The district court construed his “supplemental pleading” as a motion for leave to amend his
complaint, denied it as futile, and dismissed the action with prejudice. Id. The district court
acknowledged the plaintiff’s assertion in his supplemental pleading that he received the letter on
the later date, but held him to his initial allegation on the ground that “a plaintiff is not permitted
to take a contrary position to an allegation in a complaint in order to avoid dismissal.” Id.
In reversing the district court, the Third Circuit noted that “many courts, including ours,
have recognized that judicial admissions may be withdrawn by amendment.” Id. at 104. The
Court explained that “[d]isallowing amendment merely because an existing allegation constitutes
a judicial admission is contrary to the liberal amendment policy embodied in Rule 15(a)(2).” Id.
at 104. The Court noted that the withdrawn or amended pleading admission “at most creates an
issue of fact.” Id. at 104-05 (citing Huey v. Honeywell, Inc., 82 F.3d 327, 333 (9th Cir. 1996).)
Countless other courts have similarly held that parties may amend their pleadings to withdraw
purported admissions. See, e.g., Beeck v. Aquaslide ‘N’ Dive Corp., 562 F.2d 537, 540 (8th Cir.
1977) (allowing defendant in product liability suit to amend answer in which it admitted it
manufactured the allegedly dangerous product to state the exact opposite); King v. Cooke, 26
F.3d 720, 724 (7th Cir. 1994) (“[W]e cannot, after finding that the admissions were inadvertent
and that the amendment was not prejudicial, hearken back to the formalist days of common law
pleading and reject defendants’ attempts to correct their mistake.”). Voltmann, 147 F.2d at 516.
(allowing pleading admission to be withdrawn during trial). Here, less than three months prior to
the deadline for filing its summary judgment motion, discovery revealed additional facts related
to, inter alia, the pre-1997 collective bargaining sessions, the creation and purpose of Side Letter
22, and the relationship between Side Letter 22 and the JAC Guide. Because the Court relied on

certain pre-discovery allegations in the FAC, leave to amend is warranted to assure an accurate
record.
B.

FreightCar’s Request to Amend its FAC Embraces Rule 15’s Liberal
Pleading Standard

FreightCar has satisfied Rule 15’s liberal pleading standard. The Third Circuit has
explained that Rule 15 “embodies a liberal approach to pleading,” and requires that leave to
amend be granted “unless equitable considerations render it otherwise unjust.” Arthur v. Maersk,
Inc., 434 F.3d 196, 204 (3d Cir. 2006). The “touchstone” consideration is whether amendment
would result in “prejudice to the non-moving party.” Id. Plaintiffs cannot claim prejudice as
they were present at the very events FreightCar seeks to explain through its amendment,
including their attendance of their attorney in this case.
1.

FreightCar’s Motion for Leave to Amend is Not Futile, in Bad Faith, or
Dilatory

In the absence of “substantial or undue prejudice,” a party may only defeat a motion for
leave to amend under Rule 15 by demonstrating “bad faith or dilatory motives, truly undue or
unexplained delay, repeated failures to cure the deficiency by amendments previously allowed,
or futility of amendment.” Lorenz v. CSX Corp., 1 F.3d at 1413-14 (citing Heyl & Patterson
Int’l, Inc. v. F.D. Rich Housing of the Virgin Islands, Inc., 662 F.2d 419, 425 (3d Cir. 1981).)
There is no evidence that FreightCar has acted in bad faith or with a dilatory motive. To the
contrary, FreightCar’s request is consistent with this Court’s recognition that judicial admissions
can be superseded by later amendment. Until the Court identified certain seemingly innocuous
statements in FreightCar’s complaint as playing a material role in denying FreightCar summary
judgment, FreightCar did not view the statements identified as admissions material to this case.
FreightCar has not inexplicably or unduly delayed in seeking leave to amend. See supra at 4-5.
Considerations related to futility are inapposite here because FreightCar is not seeking to add

new claims or defenses subject to a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) motion. Brown v.
Daniels, 290 Fed. Appx. 467, 475 (3d Cir. 2008) (holding that amendment of the complaint is
futile if the amended complaint cannot withstand a motion to dismiss).
2.

Plaintiffs Will Not Be Prejudiced by FreightCar’s Proposed Amended
Complaint

Plaintiffs will not suffer prejudice by allowing FreightCar leave to amend; rather,
FreightCar will suffer prejudice if leave is denied.7 Plaintiffs seek to hinder FreightCar’s right to
a fair and independent review of the complete evidence relevant to their claims. Plaintiffs have
tried hard to make this case a repeat of Deemer. Plaintiffs objected to FreightCar’s request for
discovery in this case, and refused to take any discovery of their own, hoping instead to limit the
record to the outdated pleadings and undeveloped evidence in Deemer. Plaintiffs cannot credibly
claim that they are unfamiliar with the negotiations over the JAC Guide and Side Letter 22. Not
only was the USW present at all of the relevant negotiations, those negotiations were also a
central focus in discovery. See Lyons v. Beard, 2011 WL 2460930, *8 (M.D. Pa. 2011) (“[T]he
Court cannot perceive how Plaintiff will be unfairly prejudiced by the discrete amendments
proposed, as it appears clearly that these amended answers will be entirely consistent with
Defendants’ litigation position throughout this action—a position that Plaintiff has clearly
understood.”). Furthermore, none of the amendments will come as a surprise to Plaintiffs

7

Courts have recognized the risk of prejudice to the movant if leave to amend is denied. For example, in Beeck v.
Aquaslide “N” Dive Corp., 67 F.R.D. 411, 415 (S.D. Iowa 1975), the Court allowed the defendant to amend its
answer admitting it manufactured the allegedly defective product to state the exact opposite. The Court noted:
[A]llowing the amendment will not sound the ‘death knell’ of the litigation. It merely will allow
the defendant to contest the factual issue of its manufacturing the slide. As far as the Court can
discern, this matter is a disputed factual issue. To deny to the defendant the opportunity to contest
it would in itself be a comparable prejudice.
Id. at 415. See also, Coopersmith Bros., Inc. v. Stefko Boulevard Shopping Center, Inc., 30 F.R.D. 1, 2 (E.D. Pa.
1962) (“This Court can see real prejudice to Coopersmith if the amendment is not allowed. In light of the equivocal
answer to the counterclaim, it seems best if all the contentions of both parties are aired at the trial; neither party
being foreclosed by the action of hoary principles of pleading.”) (emphasis added).

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 180 Filed 04/28/15 Page 9 of 13

because the allegations in FreightCar’s proposed amended complaint were clearly set forth in
both its motion for summary judgment and its response to Plaintiffs’ motion to strike. Hartley,
2009 WL 793034, at *5 (finding no prejudice where movant had clearly set forth its position in
its summary judgment motion).
Rule 36(b) is instructive regarding the type of prejudice that may justify the denial of
leave to amend to clarify or correct factual allegations. Under Rule 36(b), even after a party has
unequivocally admitted a fact in response to a request for admissions, the party may still
withdraw or amend that admission. Rule 36(b) provides:
A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on
motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. Subject to Rule
16(e), the court may permit withdrawal or amendment if it would promote the
presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not persuaded that it
would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on
the merits.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b) (emphasis added). As this rule indicates, the relevant “prejudice” inquiry
relates to whether the non-movant would be limited in its ability to try the action “on the
merits.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b) (emphasis added). A party is not prejudiced by being deprived of
the ability to try a case based on pleading inaccuracies. Brook Village North Assoc. v. General
Electric Co., 686 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 1982) (“The prejudice contemplated by the Rule is not
simply that the party who initially obtained the admission will now have to convince the fact
finder of its truth.”). A party is only prejudiced if their inability to present evidence at trial is
attributable to their reliance on the admission. Morton Intern., Inc. v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., 106
F. Supp. 2d 737, 745 (D.N.J. 2000) (“Prejudice becomes undue when a party shows that it would
be ‘unfairly prejudiced’ or deprived of the opportunity to present facts or evidence which it
would have offered.”). FreightCar’s amendments will not prejudice Plaintiffs as they only seek
to clarify that which became evident through discovery. FreightCar’s amendments do not make
9
AMECURRENT 715942058.1 28-Apr-15 15:36

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 180 Filed 04/28/15 Page 10 of 13

new assertions based on facts unbeknownst to Plaintiffs. Nor do they prevent Plaintiffs from
presenting evidence on statements by FreightCar in its pre-amended pleadings.
Courts have held that prejudice may result where amendment would require the reopening of discovery, delay resolution of the case, or unnecessarily increase the cost of litigation.
Cureton v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 252 F.3d 267, 273 (3d Cir. 2001). But the proposed
amendments do not interpose new claims, defenses, parties, or theories. Furthermore, nothing in
the amended complaint changes the parties’ respective arguments presented in their summary
judgment briefing. Rather, the amended complaint alleges facts entirely consistent with those set
forth in FreightCar’s summary judgment motion and in its statement of facts. FreightCar simply
seeks to tailor the complaint to the facts learned through discovery, to cure any perceived judicial
admissions, and to put FreightCar on an equal playing field with Plaintiffs in having the
unconditional right to present evidence at trial on disputed issues of fact.
C.

Good Cause Exists for Allowing Leave to Amend

There is also good cause for granting FreightCar leave to amend. The good cause inquiry
focuses primarily on the diligence of the moving party. Roquette Freres v. SPI Pharma, Inc.,
No. 06-540-GMS, 2009 WL 1444835, *4 (D. Del. 2009). Here, FreightCar has promptly moved
for leave to amend upon becoming aware of the significance given to certain complaint
allegations by the Court in its March 30, 2014 opinion. There are three solid reasons
documenting FreightCar’s diligence.
First, prior to the Court’s ruling, FreightCar had no reason to believe that the statements
the Court deemed decisive in the FAC would be material to this dispute, would be deemed
inconsistent with the facts set forth in its motion for summary judgment, or would be construed
as binding “judicial admissions.” (ECF No. 161 at 25.) FreightCar could not have reasonably

10
AMECURRENT 715942058.1 28-Apr-15 15:36

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 180 Filed 04/28/15 Page 11 of 13

foreseen that a statement as simple as what language Bethlehem agreed to in its own plan would
lead the Court to conclude in the context of cross-motions for summary judgment that FreightCar
must have also agreed to such language. Until the Court so ruled, FreightCar had no reason to
amend such seemingly benign statements in the FAC. FreightCar has now diligently requested
leave to amend to clarify these statements. See, e.g., Hartley, 2009 WL 793034, at *5 (“[T]he
focus is upon whether the movant has acted reasonably promptly as soon as the necessity for
altering the pleading becomes apparent[.]”).
Second, FreightCar reasonably focused on evidence learned through discovery in its
summary judgment motion rather than statements made in pre-discovery pleadings. It is wellaccepted that pleadings are not definitive and forever binding documents. Instead, they are a
“short and plain statement” of a claim formed “after an inquiry reasonable under the
circumstances.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b). Plaintiffs themselves viewed FreightCar’s FAC as
“completely redundant” and “serv[ing] no legal purpose,” notwithstanding their later contention
that they constituted judicial admissions. (ECF No. 115 at 2.)
Third, as FreightCar explained in response to Plaintiffs’ motion to strike, the Deemer
pleadings Plaintiffs rely on were filed before engaging in discovery in Deemer. (ECF No. 158 at
5). Additionally, FreightCar was represented by different counsel in Deemer. (Id. at 7.) After
discovery in this case, FreightCar uncovered information not apparent from the Deemer record.
FreightCar is entitled to amend the complaint to conform the pleadings to this evidence. Lyons v.
Beard, 3:07-cv-444, 2011 WL 2460930, *8 (M.D. Pa. 2011) (“The Court is satisfied that
replacement counsel for Defendants proceeded appropriately, and promptly, by seeking leave to
amend after discovery that four responses in the initial answer were inaccurate.”).
