Respondent's Motion To Dismiss
- For Lack of Jurisdiction
For Want of "appropriate process"

Comes now, Tommy Collier, Respondent, -and moves this Court to Dismiss these proceedings
for lack of jurisdiction for want of the "appropriate process" that is specified as required
under the clear and explicit language used in the provisions of the statutes controlling the proper
use of the statutory Summons enforcement authorities by the Internal Revenue Service Agents

and Officers, operating within the distinct and different Subtitles of Title 26.

Respondent further Moves this honorable court to Dismiss this action for lack of proper required

legal service of the summons as required under 7608(a) and (b).
AUTHORITY TO SUMMONS

The authority to issue a Summons to compel an appearance to produce books and records for

inspection, and to make testimony concerning the determination of a potential tax liability, is

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 13 Filed 10/20/10 Page 1 of 24 PagelD #: 31

\
granted to the employees of the Internal Revenue Service under Title 26 U.S.C. Section

7602.

Section 7602, however, is not the only statute relevant to and controlling the proper use

of the Summons power by the Revenue Officer.

It is also necessary to satisfy the "appropriate process'"' that is required by the statutes for the

district court to hold jurisdiction to enforce the Summons.

Only the federal courts are given jurisdiction by the statutes to enforce an I.R.S. Summons.
This is done under Sections 7604(a) and 7402(b), which both require the satisfaction of a
legal "appropriate process", as the manner in which the court assumes jurisdiction over the

enforcement of an I.R.S. Summons.

Additionally, Sections 7602 and 7603 are not the only statutes relevant to the proper
lawful use of the Summons authority and power by the Revenue Officer. There are other
relevant provisions in all of the statutes of Subchapter A of Chapter 78 - "Examination and
Inspection", of Title 26, starting with Section 7603, and ending with Section 7613, the
statutes consecutively following Section 7602, the statute granting the authority to Summons

books and records.

Also, the power to enforce the Summons authority is NOT granted to the Internal Revenue
Service employees by Section 7602. The authority to enforce the Summons power is very
carefully placed, through "appropriate process", only with the District Courts, by other
code sections besides Section 7602, that are made controlling over the enforcement

process in the federal district court.

JURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT COURT

The specific authority of the federal district courts to enforce an Internal Revenue Summons
issued under authority of the United States under Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7602, is clearly and
plainly identified and established in Title 26 U.S.C. Sections 7402(b) and 7604(a). Section
7604(a) plainly states:

0x00A7 7604. Enforcement of summons
TA \l"0x00A7 7604. Enforcement of summons" \s "0x00A7 7604. Enforcement of
summons" \c 2

(a) Jurisdiction of district court
If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify,
or to produce books, papers, records, or other data, the United States district
court for the district in which such person resides or is found shall have
jurisdiction by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or
production of books, papers, records, or other data.
(emphasis added)

And Section 7402(b) similarly plainly states:

0x00A7 7402. Jurisdiction of district courts TA \I "0x00A7 7402. Jurisdiction of district
courts" \s "0x00A7 7402. Jurisdiction of district courts" \c 2

(b) To enforce summons
If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify,
or to produce books, papers, or other data, the district court of the United
States for the district in which such person resides or may be found shall have
jurisdiction by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or
production of books, papers, or other data. (emphasis added)

These statutes both make it absolutely clear, without any confusion at all, that while the
authority to Summons books, records, information, and testimony is established under

Section 7602, it is not applied or enforced under that same section. The jurisdiction of

the District Court to enforce the Summons is ONLY established by the accomplishment

of the twice statutorily specified "appropriate process". Both of these statutes consistently

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 13 Filed 10/20/10 Page 3 of 24 PagelD #: 33
invoke the same requirement of "appropriate process" in order for the District Court to hold

jurisdiction to enforce the I.R. Summons.

That requirement of "appropriate process" cannot be accomplished unless all of the specific
requirements of the controlling statutes regarding the issuance, service, and enforcement of a
Summons are meticulously followed and obeyed by the United States and its Agents and

Officers and other employees of the LR.S., throughout the Summons enforcement process.

IDENTIFYING THE REQUIRED "appropriate process"

The statutory requirements at law, necessary to establish the required "appropriate
process", which is itself necessary for the District Court to hold jurisdiction to enforce

an I.R. Summons, are provided in Title 26 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 7603 through 7613.

Those statutes, from Subchapter A - "Examination and Inspection", contained in Chapter
78 of Title 26, controlling, and limiting, the legitimate use of the Summons power, are

each entitled, and provide in summary:

Plainly, just from the titles of these code section we can very clearly see that each and every
one of these statutes (except 7607) has very specific relevance to, and controls an
element of the required due process for, the lawful use of the Summons power, with
each statute addressing a different and unique aspect of the "appropriate process" necessary
for the district court to hold jurisdiction to enforce the Summons. Jurisdiction of the court
only exists if the Summons was issued and served properly, under all of these statutes, as
required in the manner that the statutes are actually written to clearly require, and without
exceeding any of those authorities, or violating any of the imposed limitations on the use of
the Summons power under all of the statutes, not just one or two of them. In the instant

dispute, those fundamental requirements clearly did not happen.

In this matter, those requirements of "appropriate process" identified in those controlling

code sections have not been met. In the instant matter the Summons has not been served by

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 13 _ Filed 10/20/10 Page 5 of 24 PagelD #: 35
a person who is lawfully authorized by the statutes under Section 7608 to serve a
Summons enforcing or investigating alleged violations of the Subtitle A tax code

provisions as required by 26 U.S.C. (IRC) 0x00A7 7608(b).

AUTHORITY UNDER THE DIFFERENT SUBTITLES

First, the true legal authority of Internal Revenue Service employees, like Revenue Officer,
Deanna MCGee, to serve an Internal Revenue Summons issued under authority of the United
States (under 0x00A7 7602) is clearly specified and spelled out in Title 26 U.S.C.

0x00A7 7608, subsection (a). It plainly states:

0x00A7 7608. Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers TA \l "0x00A7 7608.
Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers" \s "0x00A7 7608. Authority of internal
revenue enforcement officers" \c 2 .

(a) Enforcement of subtitle E and other laws pertaining to liquor, tobacco,
and firearms

Any investigator, agent, or other internal Revenue Officer by whatever
term designated, whom the Secretary charges with the duty of enforcing any
of the criminal, seizure, or forfeiture provisions of subtitle E or of any other
law of the United States pertaining to the commodities subject to tax under
such subtitle for the enforcement of which the Secretary is responsible may -

carry firearms;
execute and serve search warrants and arrest warrants, and serve subpoenas and
summonses issued under authority of the United States; (emphasis added)

In the instant circumstances, as a "Revenue Officer}", Deanna MCGee is only authorized by
this statute to serve a Summons while conducting Subtitle E investigations enforcing the
Subtitle E laws pertaining to liquor, tobacco, and firearms, commodities subject to tax.

The Revenue Officer is in violation of this statute, as Respondent has never engaged in

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 13 _ Filed 10/20/10 Page 6 of 24 PagelD #: 36
any Subtitle E activities involving any ATF commodities or related business operations.
Additionally, the records. sought under the Summons by Revenue Officer,Deanna MCGee

are not related to any Subtitle E activities or tax as authorized.

Therefore the instant Summons has been improperly issued because the Revenue Officer has
exceeded her limited statutory authority to serve a Summons within a Subtitle E
investigation. Under I.R.C. 0x00A7 7608(a), the Revenue Officer has no authority to act under
Subtitle A. However, the authority is granted to serve a Summons under Subtitle A, in
statute, under the next code subs-section, I.R.C. 0x00A7 7608(b). However that authority does not

include the Revenue Officer

It is erroneous to interpret this code section, I.R.C. 0x00A7 7608, as only being applicable to the
authority of Internal Revenue Officers to enforce subtitle E and other laws pertaining to
liquor, tobacco, and firearms. Because, while subsection (a) of that section indeed addresses
only Subtitle E investigations, and limits.the authority of the {Job Title} to investigative
activities conducted only under Subtitle E, it is also a fact that this code section (0x00A7 7608)
specifically addresses the "Enforcement of laws relating to internal revenue OTHER THAN
SUBTITLE E', in the very next sub-section, 7608(b). Subtitles "OTHER THAN
SUBTITLE E ", would of course include Subtitle A, and thus becomes controlling in the

instant dispute.

The authority to serve Summons issued under investigations relating to Subtitle A tax
matters, which would be the relevant, applicable, and controlling authority in the instant
matter under the factual circumstances, is indeed specified and established under Title 26

U.S.C. 0x00A7 7608, subsection (b), which plainly states:

0x00A7 7608. Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers. TA \l "0x00A7 7608. |
Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers" \s "0x00A7 7608. Authority of
internal revenue enforcement officers" \c 2

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 13 Filed 10/20/10 Page 7 of 24 PagelD #: 37
(b) Enforcement of laws relating to internal revenue OTHER than subtitle E

(1) Any criminal investigator of the Intelligence Division of the Internal
Revenue Service whom the Secretary charges with the duty of enforcing any of
the criminal provisions of the internal revenue laws, any other criminal provisions
of law relating to internal revenue for the enforcement of which the Secretary is
responsible, or any other law for which the Secretary has delegated investigatory
authority to the Internal Revenue Service, is, in the performance of his duties,
authorized to perform the functions described in paragraph (2).

(2) The functions authorized under this subsection to be performed by an
officer referred to in paragraph (1) are -

(A) to execute and serve search warrants and arrest warrants, and serve
subpoenas and summonses issued under authority of the United States;
(emphasis added)

Clearly and plainly, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(b) specifies that ONLY a "criminal investigator of
the Intelligence Division" may serve a Summons outside of Subtitle E, i.e.: under Subtitle
A, as in the instant matter. Revenue Officer,Deanna MCGee is not a criminal
investigator of the Intelligence Division and has therefore violated 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(b) by
serving a Summons that only a criminal investigator is authorized to serve. Not surprisingly,
since the law is consistent, the Revenue Officer} has also violated 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(a) by
exceeding her true statutory authority as a Revenue Officer in serving a Summons that is not

issued as part of a Subtitle E investigation or enforcement action.

The Authority that is actually possessed by Revenue Officer,Deanna MCGee, is that
actually specified in Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(a), supra, to only serve a Summons regarding
the "criminal, seizure, or forfeiture provisions of subtitle E" or "pertaining to the

commodities subject to tax".

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 13 Filed 10/20/10 Page 8 of 24 PagelD #: 38
_ Section 7608(b) irrefutably and unequivocably controls the "Enforcement of laws relating to
internal revenue OTHER than subtitle E". Plainly and clearly, that would include Subtitle

A, which is the Subtitle relevant to this matter.

IRC 0x00A7 7608(a), only authorizes a limited investigative and Summons service authority under
Subtitle E. The Revenue Officer has exceeded his/her authority under that subsection in this
matter, and further ignores the fact that the Revenue Officer has no authority to act under
7608(b), outside of subtitle E and under Subtitle A, because he/she is not a "criminal

investigator of the Intelligence Division" as required by the statute in subsection (b).
STATUTORY DISTINCTIONS

Congress very carefully made these statutory distinctions controlling the lawful authority
of the IRS employees to use the Summons power within the different Subtitles. The
courts should not try to re-write the law for Congress, but must uphold what is therein

actually written.

There exists a requirement, that is laid on this honorable court though a long and well known
line of repeatedly consistent court precedents, to honor and hold to the standards of statutory
construction, as the statues are actually written and provided by Congress, without favoritism
or partiality to the government in its holdings, but with strict impartiality applied in precise

accordance with the specific and clear meaning of the words used in the statutes.
STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION

The recognized standards of legal construction, are, like the fundamental requirements of Due

Process, well known to the federal courts and have been absolutely consistently applied within
