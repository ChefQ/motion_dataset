Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ MOTION TO
STRIKE DEFENDANTS’ FINAL
EXPERT WITNESS LIST

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby moves the
Court for an order striking the Final Expert Witness List filed by defendants Donald L. Hymes

-2and Rita M. Hymes on February 16, 2007. In support of its motion, the United States submits
the following:
1. Procedural History
On November 22, 2006, the Court entered its Scheduling and Planning Order in this
matter. Dkt. #89. Pursuant to that order, (1) expert witness disclosures in accordance with Fed.
R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2) must be made on or before December 18, 2006, and (2) final revised witness
lists, including both expert and lay witnesses, must be filed and served on or before February 14,
2007.
On February 16, 2007, defendants Donald L. Hymes and Rita M. Hymes filed their Final
Expert Witness List, accompanied by a motion for leave to file that list out of time. Dkt. ##9293. The United States did not object to the late filing of the witness list, and the Court granted
defendants’ motion for leave to file.1 Dkt. #94. Although the Final Expert Witness List contains
the names and addresses of three purported expert witnesses in this matter, defendants have
never made any of the required disclosures pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2), and the deadline
for making such disclosures has expired.
2. Argument
The first purported expert witness listed by defendants in their Final Expert Witness List
is “The United States of America, c/o DOJ Jennifer Auchterlonie.” It is unclear whether
defendants intend to call Jennifer Auchterlonie, the Department of Justice trial attorney
1

The United States did not file any objection to defendants’ motion for leave to file their
witness list out of time because the witness list was only two days late and the stated grounds for
the late filing, i.e., certain undisclosed “medical problems,” appeared satisfactory to the
undersigned counsel.

-3representing the United States in this matter, or some other person to testify as “The United
States of America.” However, in accordance with the advocate-witness rule, an attorney is
prohibited from appearing as a witness in a case in which she is also serving as an attorney for
one of the parties. See U.S. v. Sayakhom, 186 F.3d 928, 943 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing U.S. v.
Prantil, 764 F.2d 548, 552-53 (9th Cir. 1985). Clearly, neither Ms. Auchterlonie nor any other
government employee has been retained as an expert by defendants or prepared a written report
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2).
The same is true for the other two purported expert witnesses identified in defendants’
Final Expert Witness List: Ralph Kermit Winterrowd 2nd and C. Conces. Defendants have not
made any of the required disclosures under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2) regarding these purported
expert witnesses. Defendants have provided nothing more than a name and address for these
persons, and have not even identified the subjects of the information known to these persons
about this case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1).
Because defendants have failed to provide the required disclosures pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(a)(2), the United States respectfully requests that the Court strike defendants’ Final
