Opposition to UNITED STATES' MOTION TO STRIKE WITNESS LIST

Comes now, Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes ("the Hymes") with
this Opposition to UNITED STATES' MOTION TO STRIKE WITNESS LIST
("Motion").

The Witnesses so listed will provide evidence on the fraud of the IRS and the
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ("USA") when the Plaintiff is identified. If
Auchterlonie would provide the mandatory Discovery in support of the USA's claim, then
the Hymes could have the Expert Witnesses hone in on what is required in the Trial by
Jury.

Auchterlonie is so exempt that she violates all of the Rules of Court of the Federal

Civil Procedure by not providing any evidence in support of the claim, no Admissions, no
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document99 Filed 04/02/2007 Page2of3

Interrogatories and no substantive Discovery except for the computer generated bills, but
mandates that the Hymes provide each and every iota on time. When Auchterlonie
provides the mandatory Discovery, the Hymes will timely provide the issues to be
provided by the expert Witnesses to debunk and expose as absolute fraud.

Therefore, Auchterlonie's motion on the Expert Witnesses should be denied in
total.
