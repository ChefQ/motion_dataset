DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL RCFC
30(b)(6) TESTIMONY AND PRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS
Pursuant to Rule 7.2(a) of the Court's Rules ("RCFC"),
defendant, the United States, respectfully opposes the December
23, 2005 motion of plaintiff, Huntleigh USA Corporation, to
compel (i) testimony, pursuant to RCFC 30(b)(6), concerning
topics 5, 6, and 7 identified in plaintiff's November 18, 2005
notice of deposition, and (ii) production of additional documents
relating to those topics.

The Government respectfully endorses

Huntleigh's request for expedited consideration.
THE GOVERNMENT'S RELEVANCE OBJECTIONS ARE VALID
Huntleigh seeks testimony and documents, in addition to
materials already produced by the Government, concerning the
"changes or enhancements" introduced by the Government after it
assumed responsibility for airline passenger and baggage
screening as a public function; the Government's screeningrelated "budgets"; and the "costs incurred and monies received"
by the Government in connection with screening, since 2002, i.e.,
following the enactment of the Aviation and Transportation

Security Act of 2001 ("ATSA"), which Federalized the screening
function.

See Pl. Mot. 2.

Huntleigh argues that this information is relevant to
measuring its damages under its takings claim.

It asserts that

"a hypothetical buyer would have taken into consideration the
increased need for, and costs of, screening post September 11,"
2001, Pl. Mot. 3, and that, as a result, information relating to
the Federal Government's screening practices, budgets, and costs
since the time of the alleged taking "will assist [plaintiff to
confirm] what a potential buyer would have paid for the Company
at the time of the taking."
Huntleigh is mistaken.

Id. at 5.
As a threshold matter, we note that

the complaint does not allege damages for a taking of "the
Company."

Instead, the Court has stated, "Plaintiff alleges that

by virtue of the Act, the government has taken its business
assets, including its long-term screening contracts, goodwill and
going-concern value."

Huntleigh USA Corp. v. United States, 63

Fed. Cl. 440, 444 (2005).
Setting aside the continuing question of exactly what
"property" Huntleigh claims to be at issue, the motion lacks
legal merit.

Huntleigh seeks evidence relating to screening

conducted by a Federal agency – first, using short-term
Government contractors and, after November 2002, using Federal
employees – yet Huntleigh claims this evidence is relevant to the

price that a buyer in the private market preceding the
Federalization of the screening function – a market that no
longer exists – would have been willing to pay for Huntleigh's
assets.

See, e.g., Almota Farmers Elev. & Warehouse Co.

v. United States, 409 U.S. 470, 474 (1943).
Plaintiff's three objectionable RCFC 30(b)(6) topics have
nothing to do with estimating that hypothetical, pre-ATSA market
price.

The actual, real-world experience of the Federal

Government since it assumed responsibility for passenger and
baggage screening – and eliminated the requirements that had
caused airlines to retain screening companies from the private
sector – cannot shed any light on what "would have" occurred in
the private market if the Government had not taken those steps.
Before the passage of ATSA, airlines, in compliance with
Federal Aviation Administration regulations, conducted passenger
and baggage screening, either by using airline personnel or by
hiring screening companies, such as Huntleigh.

In ATSA, Congress

decreed that the Federal Government would take responsibility
from the airlines for passenger and baggage screening, within 90
days, i.e., by February 17, 2002.

The entire market in which

commercial airlines purchased private screening services
disappeared.

The airlines, including Huntleigh's customers,

terminated their now-unnecessary private screening contracts
prior to February 17, 2002.

There are, in effect, two "worlds": the real world in which
ATSA was enacted and the "but-for world," created by imagining,
for purposes of estimating just compensation, that a buyer would
have expected a private screening market, and a market for
Huntleigh's screening-related assets, to continue to exist after
November 2001.

The two systems – real and hypothetical, public

and private – cannot reasonably be compared.
The issue is not whether facts that occur after the date of
a taking can ever be relevant to measuring just compensation.
The point, rather, is that the Government's post-ATSA conduct is
irrelevant to market value in this case.

None of the decisions

upon which Huntleigh relies to support its relevance argument –
and no other case law of which we are aware – endorses a court's
consideration of "post-taking" evidence that (i) does not concern
the same circumstances or market environment that existed when
the taking occurred, and that (ii) the claimant wishes to use
only for the purpose of hypothesizing a non-existent marketplace,
in a "but-for" world.

See Pl. Mot. 4-5.

One decision cited by Huntleigh holds only that, under a
Florida statute, the value of a taken parcel of agricultural land
includes the eventual sale value of crops, "with a growing period
of no more than one year," which were planted but immature at the
time of the taking.

Lee County v. T&H Assoc., Ltd., 395 So. 2d

557, 560 & n.2 (Fla. 1981) (noting "the rule may be entirely

4

different" for "plants with a growing life in excess of a year").
This arcane state doctrine has nothing to do with valuing
Huntleigh's contracts or other assets.
The other decisions upon which Huntleigh relies at least
involve Federal law.

However, the courts there considered post-

taking evidence only for limited purposes, in considering actual,
real-world circumstances that directly affected the value of the
subject property after the taking.

This case differs from all of

those cited by Huntleigh in that, here, there was no private
market for the subject property following the alleged taking.
In Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States, 640 F.2d 328 (Ct.
Cl. 1980), the property to be valued consisted of timbered forest
land adjacent to a new park, created from a former part of the
same parcel.

The plaintiff argued that proximity to the park

reduced the value of the timber property (imposing "severance
damages").

The court observed, however, that "[t]he presence of

a park is generally not considered to have a depreciating effect
on the surrounding lands," id. at 339, and noted that this
general expectation was confirmed by, among other evidence, a
review by the Government's expert of actual logging practices in
the same vicinity, after the taking.

See id. at 337-38 & n.5,

Case 1:03-cv-02670-LSM

345-47 & n.21.

No counterfactual or "but-for" analysis was

involved in Georgia-Pacific.1
Similarly, in Whitney Benefits, Inc. v. United States, 18
Cl. Ct. 394 (1989), the property was coal, and this Court
considered a post-taking contract merely as evidence concerning
how a market for the coal in fact developed.

Id. at 402-03.

The

court in United States v. 38,994 Square Feet of Space, 1989 WL
152806 (N.D. Ill.), meanwhile, permitted the Government to rely
upon "data regarding actual abatement, construction and financing
costs incurred" after the date of condemnation, as evidence of
what a hypothetical, reasonable buyer would have expected those
costs to be.

Id. at *1 (emphasis added).2

Again, this post-

taking evidence bore an obvious and direct relationship to the
real-world market value of existing property.
In sharp contrast, the Government's practices, budgets, and
costs associated with the performance of screening by Government
contractors and employees bear no conceivable economic
relationship to any existing, post-ATSA market for the assets

Tanner v. Little, 240 U.S. 369 (1916), quoted in GeorgiaPacific, described a legislative judgment, concerning the need to
regulate store coupons and trading stamps, as a finding "from
experience as against . . . from speculation." Id. at 385-86.
Tanner says nothing about the legal issue raised here.

See also Sinclair Ref. Co. v. Jenkins Petroleum Proc. Co.,
289 U.S. 689, 698 (1933) (approving, in contract case involving a

patented product in "measuring the damages for a breach of
contract or a tort").

that Huntleigh alleges were taken, or to any costs or benefits
that a buyer of the assets would have encountered in the real
world.

Given the fundamental restructuring that resulted from

ATSA, the information sought by Huntleigh cannot shed any
retrospective light upon "how a potential buyer at th[e] time [of
the taking] would have evaluated Huntleigh's prospects for
growth, future business and cash flow."

Pl. Mot. 5.

The market

conditions that this potential buyer would have expected and
taken into account evaporated when ATSA was enacted and the
alleged taking occurred.
We need not, and do not, dispute the potential usefulness of
a "but-for" valuation analysis.

Our point is that facts relating

to Federal screening practices, budgets, or costs after the
Government assumed responsibility from the private sector cannot
tell the Court anything about the reasonableness of a
hypothetical buyer's expectations in 2001 or 2002, relating to
the private marketplace that soon ceased to exist.

Accordingly,

the Government has properly objected to topics 5-7 and should not
be put to the burden of preparing an RCFC 30(b)(6) witness to
convey this irrelevant information.

The Court should deny

Huntleigh's motion to compel production of additional documents
relating to the same issues for the same reasons.
