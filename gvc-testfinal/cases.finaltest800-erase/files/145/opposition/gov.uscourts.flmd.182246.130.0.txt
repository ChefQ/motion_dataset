UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
FORT MYERS DIVISION

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
v.

CASE NO. 2:06-cr-66-FtM-99SPC

MAIKEN AGUILA

GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
FOR WRIT OF ERROR CORAM NOBIS
The United States of America, by Robert E. O’Neill, United States Attorney
for the Middle District of Florida, hereby responds to defendant’s Motion for Writ
of Error Coram Nobis:
Procedural History
The United States Attorney’s Office charged defendant with a drug offense
by Complaint ( doc. 1) on May 19, 2006; thereafter, the Grand Jury returned an
indictment (doc.12) on May 24, 2006, a superseding indictment (doc. 50) on
August 31, 2006, and a second superseding indictment (doc. 71) on October 25,
2006, all charging the defendant with, in essence cultivating marijuana for
distribution. Defendant waived indictment (doc. 96) and pleaded guilty to a
superseding information (doc. 97) with the benefit of a plea agreement (doc. 98),
whereby he waived his right to directly appeal and to collaterally attack his
conviction, on November 29 and 30, 2006. (Doc’s. 99, 100). The resolution
negotiated by defendant’s counsel with the United States Attorney’s Office
capped defendant’s maximum statutory exposure at five years pursuant to 21
U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D), without enhancement. The Court accepted defendant’s

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 2 of 10 PageID 231

guilty plea on Dec. 6, 2006, (doc. 107), and sentenced defendant on March 12,
2007 to time served followed by three years supervised release. (Doc. 120).
Defendant did not file an appeal, nor any collateral post-conviction motion for
relief prior to the instant motion.
The defendant did move for early termination of supervised release on
March 27, 2009 (doc. 125); the Court granted defendant’s motion terminating
supervised release on April 1, 2009. (Doc. 126). On November 7, 2011,
defendant moved for among other relief, writ of error coram notice (doc. 127); on
Nov. 16, 2011, the Court ordered the government to respond to defendant’s
motion for writ of error coram nobis, but denied the remainder of defendant’s
requested relief. (Doc. 128).
Legal Analysis
Coram Nobis
Federal courts have authority to issue a writ of coram nobis under the All
Writs Act, 28 U.s.C. § 1651. United States v. Mills, 221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th
Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1144 (2001). Whether to grant a writ of coram
nobis is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. Alikhani v. United
States, 200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir. 2000), cert denied, 531 U.S. 929 (2000). A
“district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing where the petitioner’s
allegations are . . . patently frivolous.” Aron v. United States, 291 F.3d 708, 71415 (11th Cir. 2002); Gordon v. United States, 518 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.
2008).
A defendant who has served his sentence and is no longer in custody
2

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 3 of 10 PageID 232

may petition for a writ of error coram nobis, although relief is not routinely
granted, as the finality of criminal convictions would be undermined. United
States v. Peter, 310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002). The writ is an extraordinary
remedy of last resort, “available only in compelling circumstances where
necessary to achieve justice.” United States v. Mills, 221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th
Cir. 2000); United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 509 n. 15, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98
L.Ed. 248 (1954) (“This jurisdiction was of limited scope; the power of the court
thus to vacate its judgments for errors of fact existed ... in those cases where the
errors were of the most fundamental character; that is, such as rendered the
proceeding itself irregular and invalid.”) (quoting United States v. Mayer, 235 U.S.
55, 69, 35 S.Ct. 16, 59 L.Ed. 129 (1914)); Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416,
429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996).
In sum, coram nobis review is an “extraordinary remedy,” limited to errors
“of the most fundamental character.” United States v. Mills, 221 F.3d at 1203. It
is not available to re-litigate criminal convictions. United States v. Addonizio, 442
U.S. 178, 186, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979).
Defendant argues that he is entitled to relief pursuant to Padilla.1 In
Padilla, the United States Supreme Court held that effective assistance required
counsel to provide the client with available advice about an issue like deportation
and the failure to do so satisfies the first prong of the Strickland2 analysis.

1

Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).

2

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674
(1984) (establishing the test for ineffective assistance of counsel).
3

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 4 of 10 PageID 233

Defendant asserts that his Resident Card was confiscated in April of 2011 and
that he is now facing deportation proceedings.
However, defendant's conviction was final two years before the Supreme
Court's ruling in Padilla. Therefore, to obtain the benefit of the Padilla ruling,
defendant must establish that the rule announced in Padilla is retroactively
applicable to convictions on collateral review. See Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.
(1990). The Third Circuit has held that Padilla is retroactive. See United States
v. Orocio, 645 F.3d 630 (3rd Cir. 2011). The Seventh and Tenth Circuits,
however, have held that Padilla is not retroactive. Chaidez v. United States, 655
F.3d 684 (7th Cir. 2011) ( Padilla not retroactive); United States v. Chang Hong,
––– F.3d ––––, No. 10–6294, 2011 U.S.App. LEXIS 18034, 2011 WL 38057630
(10th Cir. Aug. 30, 2011) (same). See also United States v.
Hernandez–Monreal, 404 F. App'x 714, 715 n. * (4th Cir.2010) ( “[N]othing in the
Padilla decision indicates that it is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral
review.”). In United States v. Milovanic, reported at 2012 WL 72710 (M.D. Fla.),
Judge Moody found “the opinions by the Seventh and Tenth Circuits persuasive,”
and concluded “that Padilla created a new rule that is not retroactive to cases on
collateral review.”
However, should the Court determine that Padilla is to be applied
retroactively, in order to be entitled to coram nobis relief that (1) he was not in
custody at the time he filed the petition, United States v. Peter, 310 F.3d 709,
712 (11th Cir. 2002); (2) there was no other available and adequate relief,
Alikhani v. United States, 200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531
4

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 5 of 10 PageID 234

U.S. 929 (2000); (3) the error alleged “Involves a matter of fact of the most
fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and
which renders the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.” Alikhani, 200 F.3d at
734 (citing Moody v. United States, 874 F.2d 1575, 1576-77 (11th Cir. 1989), cert.
denied, 493 U.S. 1081 (1990); and (4) there were sound reasons for failing to
seek relief earlier. Mills, 221 F.3d at 1204.
While defendant satisfies the first coram nobis factor because the Court
terminated his supervised release in this case some two and a half years before
he filed the instant motion, as to the remaining three factors defendant falls short.
As to the second, defendant could have timely petitioned the Court under 28
U.S.C. § 2255, but did not do so. He is therefore not entitled to coram nobis
relief. Jackson v. United States, 375 F. App’x 958, 960 (11th Cir. 2010).
As to the third factor, the alleged error in this case is not one that renders
this proceeding “irregular and invalid.” The Supreme Court in United States v.
Morgan, 346 U.S. 502 (1954) set forth the standard relied upon in Moody above.
In Morgan, the Supreme Court applied the writ of error coram nobis to remedy a
Sixth Amendment violation where an unrepresented 19 year old petitioner
alleged, and the record did not dispute, that the Petitioner was not advised of his
constitutional rights and neither competently nor intelligently waived counsel prior
to entering his plea of guilty. By contrast, at the time of defendant’s guilty plea in
this case, it was not ineffective assistance for an attorney not to inform a client of
the deportation consequences of his guilty plea. United States v. Campbell, 778
F.2d 764, 768-9 (11th Cir. 1985) (abrogated on other grounds, Padilla v.
5

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 6 of 10 PageID 235

Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010).
As to the fourth factor, other than the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla,
and the subsequent confiscation of his resident card, defendant has shown no
reason for failing to seek relief under 2255 earlier. United States v. Bejacmar,
217 F. App’x 919, 921-22 (11th Cir. 2007).
However, even if defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is
cognizable under coram nobis in light of Padilla, the defendant is not necessarily
entitled to relief.
Waiver
Should the Court determine that Padilla is to be applied retroactively,
defendant must show first that the relief he now seeks is not precluded by the
waiver in his plea agreement. Defendant waived his right to directly appeal and
to collaterally attack his conviction at ¶ B5 on pp. 10 and 11 of his plea
agreement. (Doc. 98) Such waiver constitutes valid foreclosure of a collateral
attack premised on ineffective assistance of counsel. Williams v. United States,
396 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2005).
Prejudice under Strickland
Second, where coram nobis is cognizable, the defendant still must show
that he is prejudiced under Strickland, namely, that “there is a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the
proceeding would have been different.” Strickland at 694.
It is doubtful that defendant can show the requisite prejudice required by
Strickland, even if he can show that his counsel’s alleged prediction that the
6

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 7 of 10 PageID 236

United States never deports Cuban Nationals turns out to be erroneous. At the
time he entered his guilty plea in this case, defendant stipulated to the following
facts:
On May 17, 2006, DEA was contacted by Collier County
Sheriff’s Office Detective Morgan Rogers concerning a residence
located at 3009 SW 28th Avenue, Lehigh Acres, Florida, allegedly
being used to cultivate marijuana. Lee County Property Tax
records reflect that JOSE EUGENIO GARCIA and a female are the
owners of the subject residence. On that date at approximately
3:00pm, DEA conducted surveillance at the subject residence. A
DEA agent drove by the residence and was approached by a Latin
male at the base of the driveway. The Latin male questioned the
agent as to why he was driving on the street. The Latin male was
subsequently identified as JOSE EUGENIO GARCIA.
At 11:50am on May 18, 2006, drug agents from the DEA and
the Cape Coral Police Department made contact with the
occupants of the home, including GARCIA and defendant AGUILA.
Two females were also present. GARCIA and AGUILA were both
advised of their rights under Miranda in Spanish. Thereafter,
GARCIA gave verbal consent for officers to search the residence.
Inside the residence, officers found 54 growing marijuana plants, as
well as the necessary materials and equipment to operate a
marijuana grow operation. GARCIA took responsibility for the
marijuana grow operation.
Agents advised Maiken AGUILA of his rights under Miranda.
Therafter, AGUILA agreed to speak with agents. AGUILA advised
agents that he lived at 725 La Plata Avenue, Lehigh Acres, Florida.
Agents(s) then went to 725 La Plata Avenue, Lehigh Acres, where
a strong odor of raw marijuana was detected at the front of the
residence. AGUILA consented to a law enforcement search of his
home.
During the search of the residence located at 725 La Plata
Avenue, Lehigh Acres, Florida, agents discovered 44 growing
marijuana plants. The plants, as well as the necessary materials
and equipment used for growing marijuana, were found in the
garage. Maikin AGUILA advised agents that the marijuana grow
operations was his, but denied participating in the marijuana grow
operation at 3009 SW 28th Avenue, Lehigh Acres, Florida.
7

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 8 of 10 PageID 237

Likewise, JOSE EUGENIO GARCIA denied participating in the
grow operation at 725 La Plata Avenue, Lehigh Acres, Florida.

The superseding information (doc. 97 ) to which defendant pleaded guilty,
charged as follows:
COUNT ONE
On or about May 18, 2006, in Lee County in the Middle
District of Florida, the defendant herein,
MAIKEN AGUILA,
did knowingly and willfully posses with intent to distribute a quantity
of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of
marijuana, namely 44 growing marijuana plants.
In violation of Title 21, United States Codes, Section
841(a)(1) and 841 (b)(1)(D).
Such plea agreement therefore significantly limited defendant’s exposure
in this case. Whereas defendant initially faced a twenty (20) year statutory
maximum sentence under the Superseding Indictment (doc. 50), under the
resolution negotiated by his defense counsel, his maximum statutory exposure
was limited to five (5) years. While that fact does not help his immigration issue,
since the defendant possessed more than 30 grams of marijuana, it weighs
against the defendant’s argument that but for his counsel’s ineffective advice
regarding the immigration consequences of his guilty plea, he would have gone
to trial. There do not appear to be any weaknesses in the prosecution’s case

8

Case 2:06-cr-00066-JES-SPC Document 130 Filed 01/27/12 Page 9 of 10 PageID 238

that defendant could have otherwise exploited.
Conclusion
For the reasons set forth herein, defendant’s motion should be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
ROBERT E. O’NEILL
