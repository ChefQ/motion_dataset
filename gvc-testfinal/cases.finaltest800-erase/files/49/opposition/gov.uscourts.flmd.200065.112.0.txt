The: Credit Suisse Defendants, throughout the `Motion to Dismiss Bankers" `Second : oe -

oo "Amended Complaint, repeatedly attempt to avoid iby by noting `that the Credit. Suisse URS

`epee theme underscores the Credit Suisse Defendants) ability to prevent Bankers and similar -
certificate holders from purchasing the subject Securities had it disclosed the true status of the
failed credit enhancements, fraudulent loans, and defaults. | )
The Credit Suisse Defendants also make several statements in their "Background and
Relevant Facts" section that require a closer examination and expose the flaws in their T position.

For instance, the Credit Suisse Defendants note that subordinated purchasers such as Bankers

_..were- exposed to-heightened risks. and were.to.be compensated for this heightened, isk witha

fixed rate of 7.75% return. However, the "least risky" certificates described by the Credit Suisse

Defendants are floating rate securities and with a pay rate of one month LIBOR plus 65 basis

Certificates, but a number of loans in the mortgage pool supporting t the Certificates were non-
performing even then. Nevertheless, Defendants never bothered to issue any information about

the decline in value and nonperformance of the specific loans that were backing the certificates

in question. In other words, even during one of the greatest real estate bull markets of the last OO

century, the specific loans the Defendants selected as collateral were performing poorly even

STANDARD FOR MOTION ToD) DISMISS

Int reviewing a , motion to dismiss, all well-pleadea facts i in a a plant s complaint and all os

reasonable inferences drawn from those facts must be taken a as true. Baker v | Carnival Corp a : : -
a No. 06-21527-C1V, 2006 WL 3519093, at * LGD. Fla December 6, 2006). The federal rules co -

not require a claimant to set out: in detail all the facts upon which the claim 18 based. ld. at 2.
Al that i is required is a short and plain statement of the claim, Ia. `Under the federal notice =

Additionally, "[iJn considering a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
