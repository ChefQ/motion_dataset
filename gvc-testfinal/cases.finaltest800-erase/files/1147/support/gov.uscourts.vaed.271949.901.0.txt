MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF I/P ENGINE, INC.’S MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO FILE NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY

Plaintiff I/P Engine, Inc. (“I/P Engine”), by counsel, for its Memorandum in Support of
its Motion for Leave to File Notice of Supplemental Authority, states as follows:
ARGUMENT
Good cause exists for the Court to grant I/P Engine leave to file the Notice of
Supplemental Authority. The Notice identifies new authority that is directly related to the
Court’s determination of Defendants’ Renewed JMOL on Damages (D.I. 833).
On February 26, 2013, after the close of briefing on Defendants’ Renewed JMOL on
Damages, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued an opinion in
VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc., No. 6:10-cv-417, D.I. 732 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 26, 2013). In
VirnetX, the Court denied a defendant’s JMOL on damages where the defendant, like the
defendants here, argued that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of a royalty base.

See Opinion, pp. 23-25. As in this case, the defendant in VirnetX “failed to advance a credible
alternative” at trial. Id. at 25.
For the foregoing reasons, I/P Engine respectfully requests that the Court grant it leave to
file Plaintiff I/P Engine, Inc.’s Notice of Supplemental Authority.
