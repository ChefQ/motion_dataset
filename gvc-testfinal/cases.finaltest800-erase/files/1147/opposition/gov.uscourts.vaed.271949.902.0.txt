Case 2:11-cv-00512-RAJ-TEM Document 902 Filed 03/11/13 Page 1 of 4 PageID# 22775

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
NORFOLK DIVISION
I/P ENGINE, INC.
Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-512

Plaintiff,
v.
AOL, INC., et al.,
Defendants.

OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO FILE NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY
Defendants AOL Inc., Google Inc., IAC Search & Media, Inc., Gannett Co., Inc., and
Target Corp. (collectively “Defendants”) respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiff I/P
Engine, Inc.’s (“I/P Engine”) Motion for Leave to File Notice of Supplemental Authority.
Although Defendants would not oppose the filing of supplemental authority that actually would
be relevant to the Court’s determination of the issues, I/P Engine’s proffered “supplemental
authority” is not relevant.
I/P Engine argues VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc., No. 6:10-cv-417, D.N. 732 (E.D.
Tex. Feb. 26, 2013), is relevant because the court in that case rejected the defendant’s argument
that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of a royalty base. I/P Engine states “[a]s in
this case, the defendant in VirnetX ‘failed to advance a credible alternative’ at trial.” (D.N. 901,
2.) The court in VirnetX, however, did not deny the defendant’s motion merely because the
defendant did not provide an alternative base as I/P Engine suggests. Indeed, the defendant in
that case did provide some evidence in relation to a royalty base. Rather, the court found that the
plaintiff presented sufficient evidence of a royalty base, and therefore the jury’s award was
supported by the evidence. The court also found that what defendant presented for a base was

not “credible.” No. 6:10-cv-417, D.N. 732, 24-25. In doing so, however, the court did not
eliminate the requirement that the plaintiff provide legally sufficient evidence of a royalty base
or suggest that anything the defendant did in that case altered that burden.
Here, I/P Engine did not present evidence of a royalty base. Thus, whether Defendants
introduced an alternative damages base is irrelevant, and VirnetX says nothing to the contrary.
This is just another attempt by I/P Engine to shift its burden of proof on damages to Defendants.
(See, e.g., D.N. 894, 5, 15-16 (discussing previous arguments by I/P Engine attempting to shift
the burden of proof on damages).)
For the foregoing reasons, I/P Engine’s Motion should be denied.
