PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS
________________________________________________________________________
The Plaintiffs, Albert and Andrea Fowler, by their undersigned attorney, respond
to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss as follows:

I.

BACKGROUND

This is a civil action jointly filed by the Plaintiff’s against the Defendants for misconduct related to servicing the Plaintiff’s single-family mortgage. The Defendant’s
misconduct is proscribed by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act “RESPA,” 12
U.S.C. 2601 et. seq., the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1640 et.seq., Colorado statutes
C.R.S. § 38-40-101 et. seq. and 6-1-101 et. seq. and common law. Plaintiff’s claims
largely concern that certain property which street address is: 8725 Soapweed Road,
Calhan, CO 80808 (‘Property’). This is Plaintiff’s family home.
The Defendants own and/or service or have owned and/or serviced [as this term is
defined by 12 U.S.C. 2605(i)(3)] the home mortgage and loan/note securing the Property.

1

Between 9/12 and 3/15, Plaintiffs fell behind in their loan and became the subject
of multiple foreclosure actions initiated by the Defendants. During that time, Plaintiffs
submitted 13 Home Affordable Modification Program (‘HAMP’ – loan modification)
applications, each of which required extensive written follow-up. From May of 2012 to
the present, Plaintiffs sent Defendants 867 qualified written requests (‘QWR’s) notices of
error (‘NOE’s’) and/or requests for information (‘RFI’s). (Exhibits 01-2025 through 50SHON-06 #3). Each correspondence contained a unique reference number which
Plaintiff’s requested Defendants to reference in its return the correspondence for tracking
purposes.

II.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

A court may dismiss a complaint for " failure to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted." See FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6). In deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6),
this Court must: "accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations . . . and view these
allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff." Casanova v. Ulibarri, 595 F.3d
1120, 1124 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting Smith v. United States, 561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th
Cir. 2009)). To withstand a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain enough
allegations of fact " to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. As the Tenth
Circuit explained in Ridge at Red Hawk, L.L.C. v. Schneider, 493 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th
Cir. 2007), "the mere metaphysical possibility that some plaintiff could prove some set of
facts in support of the pleaded claims is insufficient; the complaint must give the court
reason to believe that this plaintiff has a reasonable likelihood of mustering factual
support for these claims." "The burden is on the plaintiff to frame 'a complaint with

2

enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest' that he or she is entitled to relief."
Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.
at 556). The purpose of the pleading requirement is two-fold: " to ensure that a defendant
is placed on notice of his or her alleged misconduct sufficient to prepare an appropriate
defense, and to avoid ginning up the costly machinery associated with our civil discovery
regime on the basis of a largely groundless claim." Kansas Penn Gaming, LLC v. Collins,
656 F.3d 1210, 1214 (10th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
The ultimate duty of this Court is to "determine whether the complaint sufficiently
alleges facts supporting all the elements necessary to establish an entitlement to relief
under the legal theory proposed." Forest Guardians v. Forsgren, 478 F.3d 1149, 1160
(10th Cir. 2007).
Generally, a court considers only the contents of the complaint when ruling on a
Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Gee v. Pacheco, 627 F.3d 1178, 1186 (10th Cir. 2010). Exceptions
to this general rule include: documents incorporated by reference in the complaint;
documents referred to in and central to the complaint, when no party disputes their
authenticity; and "matters of which a court may take judicial notice." Id. (quoting Tellabs,
Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179
(2007).

[The Fowlers’ claim of fraudulent inducement is] predicated on a
misinterpretation of a May 2012 conditional offer for relocation assistance;
subject to the Credit Agreement for the Statute of Frauds; “

“[T]he Fowlers fail to allege conduct by BANA that is extreme and outrageous
as a matter of law.”

Plaintiff’s Response
Remedies available under RESPA are not limited to ‘identification of errors’
committed in the servicing of mortgage loans. A RESPA written enquiry can dispute a
servicer action, ask a question related to the servicing of a loan and/or seek information.1
The Fowlers written enquiries included ‘Qualified Written Requests’ and ‘Requests for
Information’ as allowed under the law. See Complaint ¶ 26 and Exhibits (Exhibits 012025 through 50-SHON-06 #3).
The Fowlers do not admit, and the pleadings do not demonstrate that most of their
mailings “were mailed to the wrong address.” Much of the initial correspondence, which
was mailed to non-designated addresses, was duplicated and sent to the addresses
designated by the Defendants. When it was ignored by the Defendants, it was re-sent a
third time. 2
¶ 35 of Plaintiff’s Complaint reads:
Initially, Plaintiffs sent their QWR’s to addresses not
designated for receipt of QWR’s. Upon becoming aware of
specific addresses designated for receipt of QWR’s, NOE’s
and ‘RFI’s, Plaintiffs copied and re-sent the same
correspondence to addresses designated by BOA or its
1

See Amini v. Bank of America, 2012 WL398636 (W.D. Wash. Feb 7, 2012); Luciw v. Bank of America,
2010 WL 3958715 (N.D.Cal. Oct 7, 2010)(statute is drafted in the disjunctive so that the request for
account information alone, without statement that account is in error, is a valid qualified written request);
Goldman v. Aurora Loan Services, L.L.C., 2010 WL 3842308 (N.D. Ga. Sept 24, 2010 (same); In re Julien,
488 B.R. 502, 508 (Bankr.D.Mass.2013)(“unnecessary for a debtor who mailed a detailed request for
information to couple these requests with specific assertions of error”).
2

RESPA mandates that a bank/servicer MUST acknowledge receipt of a borrower’s written
correspondence within 5 days and MUST provide a substantive response within 30 days, although the
bank/servicer may request a 15 day extension if such a request is made within the 30 day period and the
borrower is notified of the extension and reasons for the delay in responding. See 12 U.S.C. 2605(e)

agents for receipt of this type of correspondence. (Exhibits
01-2025 #2 through 50-SHON-06 #2).
¶ 36 of Plaintiff’s Complaint reads:
When BOA did not respond, Plaintiff re-sent these QWR’s,
NOE’s & RFI’s a third time to the addresses designated by
the Defendant’s for receipt of this type of correspondence.
The Defendants designated the following addresses:
Bank of America, N.A.
Customer Service Correspondence
CA6-919-01-41
P.O. Box 5170
Simi Valley, CA 93062-5170

P.O. Box 942019
Simi Valley, CA 93094-2019
(supported by Exhibits C17, C71, C114 and C174).
Written notice from the Defendants designated the foregoing addresses for receipt of
‘requests for Information’ ‘(RFI’s’), qualified written requests (‘QWR’s’) and ‘notices of
error’ (‘NOE’s’) to which the Fowlers sent their correspondence at least twice.3

3

But see Benner v. Bank of America, 917 F.Supp.2d 338 (E.D.Pa. 2013)(“…[N]owhere in the plain
language of 12 U.S.C. §2605(e) or 24 C.F.R. § 3500.21(e)(1), is a borrower required to send his requests to
a loan servicer’s specified address; the law simply allows a servicer to establish such a place”).

6

Defendants did not comply with any of the applicable legal obligations in that
there was no timely acknowledgement of receipt of the Fowlers correspondence4 nor was
there ever a timely and substantive response5 to any of the Fowlers letters with a single
exception.

12 U.S.C. 2605(e)(1)(A) reads:

“If any servicer of a federally related mortgage loan receives a qualified written request from the borrower
(or an agent of the borrower) for information relating to the servicing of such loan, the servicer shall
provide a written response acknowledging receipt of the correspondence within 5 days (excluding legal
public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) unless the action requested is taken within such period.”

12 U.S.C. 2605(e)(2) reads:

“Not later than 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the receipt from any
borrower of any qualified written request under paragraph (1) and, if applicable, before taking any action
with respect to the inquiry of the borrower, the servicer shall(A) make appropriate corrections in the account of the borrower, including the crediting of any
late charges or penalties, and transmit to the borrower a written notification of such correction
(which shall include the name and telephone number of a representative of the servicer who can
provide assistance to the borrower);
(B) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation or
clarification that includes(I) to the extent applicable, a statement of the reasons for which the servicer believes the
account of the borrower is correct as determined by the servicer; and
(II) the name and telephone number of an individual employed by, or the office or
department of, the servicer who can provide assistance to the borrower; or
(C) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation or
clarification that includes(I) information requested by the borrower or an explanation of why the information
requested is unavailable or cannot be obtained by the servicer; and
(II) the name and telephone number of an individual employed by, or the office or
department of, the servicer who can provide assistance to the borrower.

the Defendant’s could, and did, include NOE’s and RFI’s. Under the pre 10/14/14 law,
qualifying conditions for treatment of the Fowlers’ communications as QWR’s were also
met.6 To qualify under the earlier version of RESPA, a borrower’s request needed be to

Fowler’s queries were written correspondence.
QWR’s need to contain the borrowers’ name and account number or provide
sufficient information to enable the servicer to identify the borrowers name and account.10
Each of the Fowlers correspondence satisfied this requirement. Finally, a written inquiry
was required to be treated as a QWR if it: 1) included the “reasons for the belief of the
borrower, to the extent applicable, that the account is in error” or; 2) provided sufficient
detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.11 Under the old
law, Plaintiff’s communications to BOA met all statutory requirements of QWR’s.12 See

loan modification applications, not just their existing loan, and were also QWR’s.13
The Fowler’s HAMP related inquiries qualified under RESPA because the only
method of obtaining a HAMP modification based upon the design of the program is
through a participating servicer like the Defendants. Congress stated that the loan
modification analysis required by HAMP is the standard of the residential mortgage
servicing industry under both Federal and State law.14
BAC is an appropriate party to this action because it was the servicer of the
Fowler’s loan. See Complaint ¶ 7 and And Complaint Exhibits B: 10, 12, 14-16, 20, 2426, 29-30, 33-34, 37-38, 41-42, 45-46, 52-54, 56-58, 60-62, 64-66, 68, 70, 72, 77-78, 8082, 85-86, 92, 95-96, 99-100, 103-104, 107-108, 111-112, 115-116, 118-120 referencing
BAC as the ‘servicer.’ RESPA regulates the practices of servicers of the federally related
mortgage loans like the Fowler’s loan. As such, the servicing requirements under RESPA
and its interpreting regulations are imposed on mortgage servicers. The remedy
provisions of RESPA do not limit liability to just servicers, but also provide that
“[w]hoever fails to comply with any provision” of 12 U.S.C. § 2605 shall be liable to the
borrower.15 Without a limitation in the statute as to the parties who may be liable,
application of traditional concepts of vicarious liability16 also make a parent corporation,

16

In Rouleau v. US Bank, 2015 WL 1757104, at *7 (D.N.H. Apr. 17, 2015), the court held that because
RESPA is “a statute that provides a remedy for a defendant’s breach of a duty created by and defined in the
statute,” it creates “‘a species of tort liability,’” citing City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey,
Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 709 (1999). The court in Rouleau further noted that the “United States Supreme Court

10

vicariously liable for the acts of its agent servicer. BAC is the entity identified in the
Defendant’s correspondence as the servicer and to which the Fowlers were directed to
mail their payments. See Complaint Exhibits B: 10, 112, 14-16 , 20, 24-26, 29-30, 33-34,
37-38, 41-42, 52-54, 56-58, 60-62, 64-66, 68, 70, 72, 77-78, 80-82, 85-86, 92, 95-96, 99100, 103-104, 107-108, 111-112, 115-116 and 118-120. Additionally, the Fowlers have
noted and pled the parent corporation’s consent to judgment in the “National Mortgage
Settlement” wherein it consented to abide by the provisions of RESPA.17 Pled at
Complaint ¶88(f).
Despite Defendants claim that “they fulfilled their obligations with respect to any
mailings that did qualify Under RESPA”, their claim is unaccompanied by evidence.
The Fowlers allegations of actual and statutory damages under RESPA are found
at ¶¶ 17, 19, 37, 38, 40 and 43 of their Complaint. Their actual damages include nonpecuniary emotional distress damages.18 These are pled at Complaint ¶¶ 91 – 109 and
documented in the ‘nightmare’ notes in Complaint Exhibits TZ2, TZ3, TZ4 and TZ5.
Non-pecuniary damages have been awarded against the Defendants for similar RESPA

has long assumed that ‘when Congress creates a tort action, it legislates against a legal background of
ordinary tort-related vicarious liability rules,’ and consequently, that its statutorily-created torts
‘incorporate those rules,’” citing Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 285 (2003).

violations.19
The Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) claims are timely because, unlike RESPA,
TILA has no precise time period or ‘trigger event’ from which its statute of limitations
begins to run following a borrowers request for identification of the owner. Failure to
respond to a borrowers requests for identification, address and other relevant contract
information about the owner or assignee of a loan is also specifically proscribed and
sanctioned under 12 U.S.C. §2606(k)(1)(D) which has a three year statute of limitations.
See 12 U.S.C. § 2614.
Under the old and new law, borrower inquiries seeking identity of the mortgage
note holder have been found ‘related to the servicing’ of their loans and therefore treated
as a qualified written requests.20 The Dodd-Frank Act further clarified that a borrower has
the right to request this information under RESPA by adding 12 U.S.C. § 2605(k)(1)(D),
requiring a servicer to respond within ten business days to a borrower’s request for the
identity, address, and other relevant contact information about the owner or assignee of a
mortgage loan.21 Such requests are generally subject to the requirements for requests for

information, with modifications to the servicer’s response obligations.
Contrary to Defendant’s assertions, elements of Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-40-103 and
resulting damages are specifically pled at ¶¶ 57 – 73 of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
The Fowler’s claim of ‘fraudulent inducement’ is predicated on reasonable
interpretation of the Defendant’s May 2012 conditional offer for relocation assistance.
Complaint Exhibit C46. The issue of ‘reasonable interpretation’ of this letter should be
left to the finder of fact. The letter itself is not subject to the Credit Agreement for the
Statute of Frauds because it is not related to credit and was an offer upon which the
Fowlers relied. Cases concerning The Statute of Frauds for Credit Agreements (“SFCA”)
involve borrowers seeking to enforce oral promises to provide financing, forbearance or
other financial accommodation. Colorado cases on this point are foot-noted below.22 The
Legislature’s intent with the SFCA was to "curtail suits against lenders based on ORAL
representations made by members of the credit industry."23 See also Schoen v. Morris, 15

Representative Kopel, a bill supporter, testified during the House Business Affairs Committee Meeting:
“It’s happened in other states and its happened because there is some litigation at a very
high level for many millions of dollars where someone has claimed that a statement was
made to them by the credit industry, whether finance manager of a bank or whatever, and
sometimes courts have used that as a basis for determining yes, there was a contract even
though nothing was in writing because other individuals went ahead and relied upon the
oral representation.”

Committee on H.B. 11-16-1989, 57th General Assembly (Jan. 19, 1989). The Legislature
never intended the SFCA to be an omnibus shield against all wrongdoing by financial
institutions. See fn.13 infra.
The Complaint adequately alleges the required elements of ‘fraudulent
inducement’ and ‘promissory estoppel’ at Complaint ¶¶ 74 – 81.
The ‘fraudulent inducement’ and ‘promissory estoppel claims’ are not presented
in the Complaint as ‘predicate’ unfair and deceptive trade practices for purposes of the
Fowler’s CCPA claim. Neglect of Defendant’s statutory duties under RESPA, TILA and
C.R.S. §38- 40 -101 et. seq. are the only asserted CCPA predicates as indicated in the
Complaint. Complaint ¶ 83(a).24
The Defendant’s conduct toward the Fowlers is extreme and outrageous as a
matter of law.25 Elements of this tort are reviewed in Trentadue v. U.S. 386 F.3d 1322
(10th Cir. 2004). Complaint allegations at ¶¶ 91 – 109establish that the Fowlers suffered
severe emotional distress as a result of the extended reckless and indifferent manner in
which they were treated by BOA in the face of eminent foreclosure of their family home.
The Fowler’s understandable emotional distress was needlessly and recklessly
intensified by: the Defendant’s years-long, repeated, multiple failures to respond to
hundreds of enquiries as the Fowlers searched for answers and loan modifications. The
Defendant’s near total neglect of the Fowlers enquiries coupled with verbal disrespect
These predicates fall under the ‘catch-all’ of the CCPA. “The deceptive trade practices listed in this
section are in addition to and do not limit the types of unfair trade practices actionable at common law or
under other statutes of this state.” C.R.S. § 6-1-105(3).

and abuse hurled at them from Defendant’s employees over the phone created anxiety
and stress unlike the Fowlers ever experienced. Complaint ¶¶ 91 – 109
In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants offer no explanation for their prolonged
neglect and outrageous behavior. By their Complaint, the Fowlers have met the prima
facia burden on their claim for infliction of emotional distress. Allegations of emotional
distress arising as a specific result of similar RESPA violations alleged against BOA
routinely survive BOA’s Motion’s to Dismiss in U.S. District courts around the
country.26
The Defendants acted in deliberate disregard of a high probability that their
actions would cause the Fowlers extreme distress. The Fowlers were a family facing
immediate financial harm reaching for life-lines and searching for answers in the face of
foreclosure. The Defendant's overall treatment of the Fowlers, including: repeated,
prolonged nondisclosure of information to which the Fowlers had an absolute right;
obstinance and willful procrastination concerning the Fowlers multiple loan applications,
and; verbal abuse over the phone amounted to outrageous conduct that "needlessly and

Facing a similar Motion to Dismiss by BOA, the Court in Johnstone v. Bank of America, 173 F.Supp.2d
809, 815 (N.D.Ill. 2001) wrote:“RESPA allows a plaintiff to recover actual damages for emotional distress
for violations of 12 U.S.C. §§ 2605(e)(1) and (e)(2). See also Rawlings v. Dovenmuehle Mort., Inc., 64
F.Supp.2d 1156 (M.D.Ala.1999). In Rawlings, the plaintiffs sued the defendants for failing to notify the
plaintiffs of their receipt of qualified written requests and for failing to take appropriate action upon those
requests. Id. at 1160. The plaintiffs alleged that they suffered mental anguish as a result of the defendants'
RESPA violations. Id. at 1164. The court in Rawlings first looked to the language of RESPA and its
legislative history in determining that Congress intended RESPA to be a remedial consumer protection
statute. Id. at 1166. The court then analyzed cases interpreting other consumer protection statutes such as
the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA") in
concluding that actual damages under RESPA include recovery for mental anguish. Id. at 1166-67. The
court finds the analysis of Rawlings applicable to this case”; Benner v. Bank of America, 917 F. Supp.2d
338, 364 (E.D.Pa. 2013)(“Defendant also contends that even if its RESPA duties were triggered, Plaintiff
has not pled sufficient facts to show he suffered actual damages as a result. The Court again disagrees.
Plaintiff alleges he "has suffered fear, anxiety and other emotional distress" as a result of Defendant's
actions. The Court finds it reasonable to infer that a borrower in default who repeatedly seeks— yet fails to
obtain— information about his financial situation could have damages for mental and emotional suffering.
Therefore, the Court will deny Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count VI of the Amended Complaint.”)

recklessly" intensified the family's emotional distress. The Fowler’s ordeal has
continued for years.

Defendant’s arguments found at “B. The Fowler’s Serial Mailings” (pages 5 – 7)
•

The Fowlers mailings were duplicative.

•

The Fowlers initially sent their QWR’s to addresses not designated for receipt of
QWR’s and then “copied and re-sent the same correspondence to addresses
designated by [BANA].

•

The Complaint alleges that BANA responded to the Fowlers’ written inquiries on
at least 86 occasions. Complaint at ¶ 31.

•

BOA provided the Fowlers with pertinent loan information.

•

The Fowlers’ March 2015 Mailings did not request information related to the
servicing of their loan, but instead sought the following: (i) “receipt dates” for
the Fowlers’ previous mailings (ii) an explanation as to why a BANA
representative failed to return Mr. Fowler’s phone calls and (iii) information
related to the signing of the Fowlers’ loan modification.

•

The Fowlers have not plausibly alleged actual or statutory damages.

Plaintiff’s Response
The Fowlers duplicated their initial correspondence when they discovered the
Defendant’s had designated certain addresses for receipt of correspondence including
RFI’s, NOE’s and QWR’s. The Fowlers subsequently sent their written enquiries to the
designated addresses. When Defendants failed to timely acknowledge or respond
according to statute, the Fowlers reasonably re-sent this correspondence to the designated

16

addresses. See Complaint ¶¶ 35 & 36. A loan servicer is permitted to "establish a
separate and exclusive office and address for the receipt and handling of qualified written
requests" from borrowers (24 C.F.R. § 3500.21(e)(1) but is not required to do so.27
As the Defendants state in their Motion, the Complaint does allege that they
responded to the Fowlers’ written inquiries on at least 86 occasions however, none of
their ‘form letter’ acknowledgments were sent within the ‘pre’ or ‘post’ 1/10/14’ RESPA
statutory time frames required for initial acknowledgments or substantive responses and
none of them mentioned which of the Fowler’s written enquiries to which each referred.
See Complaint ¶ 31. Failure to timely respond is a RESPA violation. As this Court
reviews the Fowler’s Complaint exhibits, it is also encouraged to compare the date
stamps on Defendant’s envelopes (the real dates of mailing) verses the dates printed on
the Defendants correspondence.
With one exception, BOA never provided the Fowlers with the requested loan and
servicing information in a timely manner. Complaint ¶ 31. When a consumer raises a
written question concerning their account, including questions related to the Home
Affordable Modification Program and escrow enquiries, this triggers certain obligations
on the part of the bank or servicer. The Fowler’s correspondence should have been
acknowledged within 5 days and should have been the subject of a substantive responses

27

Benner v. Bank of America, 917 F. Supp.2d 338, 364: [N]owhere in the plain language of 12 U.S.C. §
2605(e) or 24 C.F.R. § 3500.21(e)(1), supra, is a borrower required to send his requests to a loan servicer's
specified address; the law simply allows a loan servicer to establish such a place. What is required, though,
is that the loan servicer actually receive the borrower's request for information. Here, although Defendant
has divisions in Pittsburgh, Simi Valley, and throughout the country, each office is still under the
management and control of Defendant.

17

or affirmative actions in response to the correspondence within 30 days.28 Under C.R.S. §
38-40-101, BOA had 20 days to respond. Failure to respond per state and federal statute
caused the Fowlers additional damage.29
The Fowlers’ post March 2015 correspondence did request information related to
the servicing of their loan but, taking Defendant’s argument that they were “not directly
related to servicing” as true, direct relation to servicing is of no consequence after
January 10, 2014. Effective January 10, 2014 a servicer is required to respond to any
written request for information from a borrower that “states the information the borrower
is requesting with respect to the borrower’s mortgage loan.” 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36(a),
(‘Reg X’). Unlike the earlier version of this regulation that applied to QWR’s, the scope
of an information request under Reg. X is no longer tied solely to the concept of
information “related to the servicing.” Rather, requests are effective if they seek any
information concerning the borrower’s mortgage loan, which include, and are not limited
to, the servicing of the loan. Thus, the question as to whether the Fowlers sent valid
information requests after March 2015 no longer turns on the definition of “servicing”
found in RESPA.30
To accommodate the new federal regime in which QWR’s continue to coexist with RFI’s, Reg. X provides that a QWR that requests information relating to the

28

The five day/twenty day acknowledgment and response periods under RESPA took effect (‘post’
1/10/14). The earlier version of RESPA required acknowledgment within 20 days and a substantive
response within 60 days (‘pre’ 1/10/14).
29

Itemized damages referenced in Complaint ¶¶ 31 & 67. At minimum, had the Defendants timely
responded, the Fowlers would have saved the expense of an additional postage stamp.
30

See Section-by-Section Analysis, § 1024.36(f)(1)(iv), 78 Fed. Reg. 10,761 (Feb. 14, 2013) (“the final
rule . . . does not limit information requests to those related to servicing”).

18

servicing of the mortgage loan is a request for information for purposes and a servicer
must comply with all requirements applicable to a request for information with respect to
such qualified written request. Reg. X, 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36(a). A written inquiry can be a
request for information even if it is not a qualified written request, and so may seek
information beyond that of a qualified written request.
The Fowlers’ correspondence requesting information related to their loan
modification are subject to RESPA and have been treated as a proper QWR’s by courts.31
Such requests are valid because loss mitigation has become a routine function of
servicers in the servicing of mortgage loans.32 In particular, inquiries like the ones made
by the Fowlers related to the HAMP qualify, because the only method of obtaining a
modification based on the design of the program is through a participating servicer. In
fact, Congress has specifically stated that the loan modification analysis required by the
HAMP program is the standard of the residential mortgage servicing industry under both
federal and state law.33
The Fowler’s request for the dates of receipt of QWR’s, NOE’s and RFI’s
earlier sent qualifies as a RFI. As does their query related to the signing of their loan
modification. Complaint Exhibit 39-DTFC-03.
Under state statute, the Defendants had twenty days to respond to information

BAC Is Not An Appropriate Party.

Plaintiff’s Response
The state equivalent of RESPA defines ‘Servicer’ as including: “A subsidiary,
affiliate, or assignee of a servicer, however designated, … .”35 Under this definition BAC
is an appropriate party because it is the assignee of the original holder/servicer,
Countrywide Home Loans, by virtue of merger and acquisition.
¶ 7 of Plaintiff’s Complaint reads in part:
… Defendant BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P. is/was a
servicing company formerly known as Countrywide Home
Loan Servicing, L.P. It was a Texas limited partnership
with its principal place of business in Plano, Texas. It was,
for a time a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America
N.A. Countrywide Financial Corporation is/was a financial
services company headquartered in Calabasas, California

34

C.R.S. §38-40-103(2) reads:
The servicer of a loan shall respond in writing within twenty days from the receipt of a
written request from the debtor or from an agent of the debtor acting pursuant to written
authority from the debtor for information concerning the debtor's loan, which is readily
available to the servicer from its books and records and which would not constitute the
rendering of legal advice. Any such response must include the telephone number of the
servicer.

the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved
Countrywide Bank, FSB’s (“CWB”) request to convert its
charter back to that of a national bank and the request of
Bank of America N.A. to then immediately acquire CWB
by merger. These transactions were executed on April 27,
2009, as a result of which CWB ceased to exist. Bank of
America N.A. was the surviving institution resulting from
this merger. Thus Bank of America N.A. is the successor in
interest to CWB.

Under RESPA Because Their Inquiries Were Not Qualified Written Requests And
They Cannot Allege Resulting Damages” (pages 9 - 19)”
•

QWR requirements do not apply to inquiries sent during default.

•

The Fowlers’ March 2015 Mailings were not related to the servicing of their
mortgage loan.

21

• The Fowlers’ post-May 2015 inquiries were sent after servicing of their loan had
been transferred to another servicer.
• Regarding the March 2015 mailings, BOA complied with its RESPA obligations
because it acknowledged receipt of the mailings within five business days and
substantively responded within 30 business days.
• BOA was no longer ‘servicing’ the Fowlers loan after May 16, 2015 because it
was no longer responsible for receiving any scheduled periodic payment or
applying the payments of principal and interest.
• The March mailings did not seek information related to servicing.
• The Fowlers have not plausibly alleged damages.
• The Fowlers have not adequately pled a direct causal link between BOA’s RESPA
violations and resulting damages.
• The Fowlers do not allege a basis for statutory damages.
• The Fowlers do not adequately allege a “pattern or practice” of non-compliance
sufficient to support recovery of statutory damages.
Plaintiff’s Response
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, rule making authority for RESPA and TILA
transferred from the Department of Housing and Urban Authority (‘HUD’) to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (‘CFPB’) effective 7/21/11.36 In addition to its
new rule promulgating authority, the CFPB was given authority to interpret rules and
issue regulations consistent with consumer protection and foreclosure avoidance. On
12/21/11, the CFPB issued the new version of Regulation X (‘Reg. X’) interpreting
36

Pub.L.No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 §§ 1061, 1098 (July 21, 2010).

22

RESPA and TILA. See 12 C.F.R. § 1024 (formerly 3500 series). The new Reg. X became
effective 1/10/14, changing the interpretation and implementation of RESPA
dramatically.
Amendments to Reg. X, establish separate qualifications and procedures
depending upon whether a written inquiry is a NOE sent in accordance with § 1024.35 or
a RFI sent in accordance with § 1024.36. A QWR that properly asserts an error under §
1024.35 or seeks information under § 1024.36 is considered an NOE or RFI for purposes
of these respective regulations.37 Official interpretations of Reg. X make clear that a
QWR is “just one form that a written notice of error or information request may take.”38
Thus, the requirements for compliance with a NOE or RFI apply irrespective of whether
a servicer receives what may be interpreted as a QWR. In other words, a written inquiry
can be a NOE or RFI even if it is not a QWR. In sum, the qualifying conditions for
treatment of written correspondence as a NOE, RFI or QWR under 12 U.S.C. § 2605(e)
are easily met.39 Reg. X §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 were specifically promulgated to
implement 12 U.S.C. § 2605(e).
Regarding NOE’s mailed before 1/10/14, courts have not required that QWR’s

include a detailed explanation of the reasons for the dispute.40 It has been sufficient for a
borrower to generally identify the problem.41 Effective January 10, 2014, Reg. X §
1024.35 establishes an error resolution procedure that supplements and effectively
operates within the existing structure for QWRs. A servicer is required to comply with
the requirements under § 1024.35 for any written notice it receives from a borrower that
asserts an error covered by the section.42
To qualify as a valid borrower inquiry under RESPA, a correspondence must be
addressed to a servicer of the mortgage loan and not to other parties related to the loan.
RESPA defines a “servicer” to mean “the person responsible for servicing of a loan
(including the person who makes or holds a loan if such person also services the loan).”43
The term “servicing” is defined to mean “receiving any scheduled periodic
payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any loan, including amounts for
escrow accounts . . . and making the payments of principal and interest and such other
payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower as may be required

40

Catalan v. GMAC Mortg. Corp., 629 F.3d 676, 687 (7th Cir. 2011) (“Any reasonably stated written
request for account information can be a qualified written request. To the extent that a borrower is able to
provide reasons for a belief that the account is in error, the borrower should provide them, but any request
for information made with sufficient detail is enough under RESPA to be a qualified written request and
thus to trigger the servicer’s obligations to respond.”); Baehl v. Bank of America, 2013 WL 1319635 (S.D.
Ind. Mar. 29, 2013) (rejecting as an “untenable result” the servicer’s argument that it had no obligation to

pursuant to the terms of the loan.”44 The inquiry must be in the form of a written
correspondence.45 A QWR, NOE or RFI must also include the name and account of the
borrower, or provide sufficient information to enable the servicer to identify the
borrower’s name and account.46 The Fowler’s correspondence satisfies this hurdle.
Complaint Exhibits 01-2025 through 50-SHON-06. Arguably, a letter containing the
borrower’s name and property address, without a specific reference to an account
number, could enable the servicer to identify the account.47 The letter does not even need
to be signed by the borrower.48
Finally, 12 U.S.C. § 2605(e) provides that a written inquiry must be treated as a
QWR if it: (1) includes the “reasons for the belief of the borrower, to the extent
applicable, that the account is in error,” or; (2) “provides sufficient detail to the servicer
regarding other information sought by the borrower.”49 While a written inquiry can both

dispute a servicer action and seek information, either request alone can be a qualified

Defendant’s assertion that QWR requirements under the statute do not apply to
borrowers in default is absurd. In discussing the borrowers’ right to assert a notice of
error for a servicer’s failure to provide accurate information to a borrower with respect to
available loss mitigation options, the CFPB stated that “it is critical for borrowers to have
information regarding available loss mitigation options,” and that that this access should
include: “accurate information about the loss mitigation options available to the
borrower; the requirements for receiving an evaluation for any such loss mitigation
option, and; the applicable timelines relating to both the evaluation of the borrower for
the loss mitigation options and any potential foreclosure process.”51 The CFPB also noted
that servicers are typically required to provide borrowers in default with information
about loss mitigation options for loans facing foreclosure. Further, the Defendants signed
the National Mortgage Settlement (referenced in Plaintiff’s Complaint at ¶88(f)) and
servicer participation agreements with the Department of the Treasury which cross
reference HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac guidelines “providing such information
[post default foreclosure options] to borrowers is a standard servicer duty.”52

Any pre-January 10, 2014, court opinions cited by the Defendants have dubious
precedential value based on the substantial changes made to Reg. X by the 2013
amendments. Although the CFPB retained the statutory definition of ‘servicing’ in Reg.
X § 1024.2, amendments to regulations under Reg. X recognize that ‘standard’ servicer
duties have greatly expanded since the 1990 Servicer Act amendments to RESPA. For
example, Subpart C of Reg. X now includes regulations dealing with servicing operations
not contemplated by the original definition of “servicing” in RESPA § 2605(i)(3), such as
disclosure of the identity of mortgage/note owners, foreclosure avoidance, and loss
mitigation. Reg. X also now includes a separate section that describes general servicing
policies, procedures, and requirements, based on the CFPB’s analysis of servicing
industry practices.53 These significant regulatory changes and developing industry
practices must be considered together with the catch-all provision of § 1024.35(b)(11)
when determining whether a NOE, RFI or QWR is related to the ‘servicing’ of a
borrower’s mortgage loan (and thus subject to RESPA).
Notably, the 2013 amendments to Reg. X also establish post-default loss
mitigation activities as a ‘standard servicer duty’. In addition, the QWR (and now the RFI
and NOE) provisions of RESPA have always qualified under both the old and the new
versions/interpretations of RESPA. Congress has specifically stated that the loan
modification analysis required by the HAMP program is the standard of the residential
mortgage servicing industry under both federal and state law.54 As the CFPB correctly

See ‘Helping Families Save Their Homes Act’ of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-22, 123 Stat. 1632 (2009) (“The

Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 shall constitute standard industry practice for purposes of all Federal
and State laws”).

noted, “any error related to the servicing of a borrower’s mortgage loan also relates to
standard servicer duties.”55 It was thus appropriate for NOE’s, RFI’s and QWR’s to be
used by the Fowlers to seek information for, and update of, their multiple post-default
HAMP applications and to follow up on their multiple improper loan modification
denials.56 The default status of the Fowler’s loan was inconsequential to the Defendant’s
statutory obligation to respond to their written enquiries under the old or new law.
Before 1/10/14, enquiries requesting information related to the status of a loan
modification application when a borrower’s loan was in default have also been treated as
a proper QWR’s.57 One court commented that such requests should be treated as valid
because loss mitigation has become a routine function of servicers in the servicing of
mortgage loans.58 In particular, an inquiry related to the HAMP also qualifies, because
the only method of obtaining a HAMP modification based on the design of the program
is through a participating servicer.
Applying the Defendant’s argument that it did not have to comply with RESPA
because of the default status of the Fowler’s loan (i.e. servicer is no longer “receiving any

56

Nothing in § 1024.35 or its commentary prohibits a borrower from asserting an error under the catch-all
provision in section 1024.35(b)(11) based on a servicer’s failure to correctly evaluate a loss mitigation
application when a loan is in default. In fact, RESPA itself requires servicers, through amendments made
by the Dodd-Frank Act, to take timely action to correct errors relating to “avoiding foreclosure,” suggesting
that borrowers should be able to assert under RESPA errors related to loss mitigation when a loan is in
default.

scheduled periodic payments”) leads to the absurd result that the remedial Servicer Act
provisions of RESPA could not be used by a borrower to avoid a wrongful foreclosure
caused by servicer error, simply because the servicer has unilaterally declared the account
in default and stopped receiving or accepting payments. Such a construction completely
undermines the purpose of the dispute resolution procedure originally intended by 12
U.S.C. § 2605(e) and is inconsistent with the statutory language under the old and new
law.59
Using inverse analysis on this point, it should be noted that Reg. X expressly
provides exemptions from several of the servicer requirements under RESPA when the
borrower is in default,60 but significantly provides no such exemption for QWR response
requirements (leading to the presumptive availability of QWR’s for use by borrowers in
default). It is also worthwhile to note that HUD (as predecessor to the CFPB) had
construed the “relating to the servicing” language in 12 U.S.C. § 2605(e)(1)(A) more
broadly.

When promulgating the specific regulations that implement 12 U.S.C. §

2605(e), HUD rejected comments which sought to narrow the scope of a QWR to
inquiries about payments and account balances. HUD stated that “[t]he statute
encompasses all information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan and does not
restrict the subject matter to questions concerning the transfer of servicing, installment

59

See Hammer v. Residential Credit Solutions, Inc., 2014 WL 4477948 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 11, 2014) (RESPA
applied, despite alleged default, where servicer continued to collect payments after the default); Henok v.
Chase Home Fin., L.L.C., 915 F. Supp. 2d 109 (D.D.C. 2013) (letter requesting amount to cure a default is

Examples include duties to: make timely payments out of escrow; send annual escrow account
statements etc.

payments, or account balances.”61 The CFPB has since expanded the scope of
information requests in the 2013 amendments to Reg. X, clarifying HUD’s rule
interpretation that any information with respect to the borrower’s mortgage loan, pre or
post default, may be sought, not just information ‘related to the servicing of the loan.’
Some of the Fowlers’ post-May 2015 inquiries were sent after servicing of their
loan had been transferred to another servicer. All of these were 3rd inquires were mailed
after the Defendants had ignored the 2nd mailing of the same enquiries mailed to the
address designated by the Defendants. The new servicer responded as follows:

The new servicer did not properly integrate the transfer with the Defendants and
also violated RESPA. The Defendants were still responsible for responding to the
Fowler’s second mailing of the same enquiry and both the new and old servicers were
responsible for the continuity of servicing transfer.
RESPA’s state equivalent is C.R.S. § 38-40-103.5(e)(I) defines ‘Servicer’ as “a
person who collects, receives, or has the right to collect or receive payments on behalf of
a holder, including payments of principal, interest, escrow amounts, and other amounts
due on obligations due and owing to the holder [emphasis added]. At all times herein,
BOA had a right to collect or receive payments from the Fowlers.

101, 108, 109, 110. Courts have been willing to broadly define the scope of actual
damages available under the statute.62 Actual damages for Defendant’s 12 U.S.C. 2605
violations rightly include all of the Fowler’s economic injuries directly flowing from the
Defendant’s failure to: respond to the Fowlers QWR’s, NOE’s and RFI’s; make
appropriate corrections to the Fowler’s account, and; otherwise comply with RESPA’s
requirements including timeliness of acknowledgements and substantive responses. This
includes expenses that become actual damages for the Fowlers due to the BOA’s failure
to adequately respond. Many QWR’s, NOE’s and RFI’s were sent twice once BOA failed
to respond within statutory mandated periods.63 Components of the Fowler’s actual
damages are supported by RESPA case law including:
ü Cost to prepare a notice of error, request for information, or qualified written
request;64
ü Cost of photocopies and postage in sending a notice of error, request for
information, or qualified written request;65

The remedy provision in 12 U.S.C. 2605 provides that in addition to actual
damages, a court may award “additional” damages in an amount not to exceed $2000 if
the evidence reveals a “pattern or practice of noncompliance.”74 As in the case of actual
damages, a borrower should be entitled to an award of up to $2000 per violation, not a
total award of $2000, for all “pattern and practice” violations.75 The Dodd-Frank Act
amended 12 U.S.C. § 2605(f) to increase the statutory damages to $2000 per violation.76
Statutory damages under the state statute remain at $1000 per violation.77

law containing similar ‘pattern and practice’ language such as Title VII (involving
employment discrimination) and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
(HOEPA).
In the context of RESPA, Courts have found a “pattern and practice” for servicers
failure to respond to as few as three written RESPA enquiries.78 One court noted that the
“pattern and practice” language in RESPA and other federal statutes is not a “term of art
but rather is defined according to the usual meaning of the words,” and that it suggests a
“standard or routine way of operating.”79 A cursory review of case law involving Bank of
America cited in this Response suggests their callous interaction toward the Fowlers is
their standard operating procedure with other similarly situated borrowers.
RESPA’s state equivalent is C.R.S. § 38-40-103(2) which does not reference any
need to demonstrate a “pattern or practice” of non-compliance by the offender.
To survive Defendant’s Rule 12(b) Motion, the Fowlers do not need to “allege

The Fowler’s TILA claims (relating to identification of the holder of the note and
mortgage) are timely. The Fowlers made a total of 18 requests for identification of the
mortgage loan/note holder/owner the last of which was made on 7/3/15. See Complaint
¶48. In addition to TILA having no trigger event from which its statute of limitations
(‘SOL’) begins to run, courts regularly toll the TILA SOL where the violation itself
involves concealment)80. Examples of circumstances where courts have found sufficient
circumstances to raise a question of fraudulent concealment for purposes of tolling the
TILA SOL include: a creditor making affirmative misrepresentations at closing and
afterwards about the loan terms in question81, and; a creditor lulling a borrower into a

of C.R.S. § 38-40-103 (pages 20 - 21)”
•

The Fowlers have not made any written requests.

•

The Fowlers have not requested any information concerning their loan.

•

The information requested is not readily available to the servicer.

•

The Fowlers have failed to plead the existence of any actual damages.

Plaintiff’s Response
Over a period of years, the Fowlers made 867 written requests concerning their
loan. See Complaint Exhibits 01-2025 through 50-SHON-06 #3. While the state statute
does not define ‘written request,’ portions of the state statute refer to 12 U.S.C. 260584
indicating legislative intent to mirror the federal statute. The term ‘servicer’ however, is
defined under the state statute more broadly than the federal statute as: “a person who
collects, receives, or has the right to collect or receive payments on behalf of a holder,

In re: Meyer, 379 B.R. 529, 554 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2007)(a TILA violation is an unfair and deceptive
trade practice statute violation even if the TILA claim is time barred)
84

37

…”; “[t]he person to whom payments are to be sent…”, and; “A subsidiary, affiliate, or
assignee of a servicer, however designated… .” 85
In this Response, the Fowlers have previously and adequately responded to
Defendant’s allegations that somehow their written requests: did not qualify; relate to the
servicing of their loan, and/or; concerned information that was not readily available to the
servicer. See infra pages 21-24 and 28-31.
The Fowlers have also previously and adequately responded to Defendant’s
allegations that they have failed to plead the existence of damages. See above and also
reference Complaint ¶¶ 38, 39, 40, 41, 53, 54, 56, 66, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 80, 81, 89, 100,
101, 108, 109, 110.

Defendant’s argument found at “E. The Fowlers Remaining Claim Fail For A Host
of Reasons(pages 21 - )”
•

The Fowlers Promissory Estoppel, Fraudulent Inducement, Colorado Consumer
Protection Act (‘CCPA’), and Outrageous Conduct claims are predicated on their
misinterpretation of the May 8th 2012 letter.

•

The Fowlers Promissory Estoppel, Fraudulent Inducement, CCPA, and
Outrageous Conduct claims are each barred by the Credit Agreement Statute of
Frauds.

85

•

The CCPA claim cannot meet the ‘public impact requirement.’

•

The Fowlers have not alleged that BOA engaged in a deceptive trade practice

See C.R.S. § 38-40-103.5(e)(I), (e)(II)(A) and (e)(II)(B).

38

that significantly impacted the public.
•

The Fowlers have not identified any deceptive trade practice committed by BOA
or alleged how any deceptive trade practice is likely to impact borrowers in the
future.

•

No public interest is implicated by allegations that the Defendants are simply
engaged in a private wrong against only the Plaintiffs.

•

Fowlers outrageous conduct claim fails as a matter of law because it is not
extreme and outrageous.

Plaintiff’s Response
The Complaint is clear that only the Fowler’s claims of ‘Promissory Estoppel’ and
‘Fraudulent Inducement’ are based upon the Defendant’s May 8th, 2012 letter. Complaint
¶¶ 74 – 81.
Defendants’ argument using the Statute of Frauds for Credit Agreements, ('SFCA')86,
is misplaced. BOA's 5/8/12 letter is clearly not a credit agreement as defined by the
statute.87 Cases concerning The Statute of Frauds for Credit Agreements (the “SFCA”)

86

C.R.S. § 38-10-124.

87

C.R.S. 38-10-124(1)(a) reads:
Credit Agreement means:
(I)

A contract, promise, undertaking, offer, or commitment to lend, borrow, repay, or
forebear repayment of money, to otherwise extend credit or receive credit or to make any
other financial accommodation;

(II)

Any amendment of, cancellation of, waiver of, or substitution for any or all of the term or
provisions of any of the credit agreements defined in subparagraphs (I) and (III) of this
paragraph (a); and

(III)

Any representations and warranties made or omissions in connection with the
negotiation, execution, administration, or performance of, or collection of sums due
under, any of the credit agreements defined in subparagraphs (I) and (II) of this paragraph
(a).

39

involve borrowers seeking to enforce ORAL promises to provide financing, forbearance
or other financial accommodation.88 The Legislature’s intent when enacting the SFCA
was to "curtail suits against lenders based on oral representations made by members of
the credit industry." See Schoen v. Morris, 15 P.3d 1094, 1098-99 (Colo. 2000) citing
Recordings of the House Business Affairs Committee on H.B. 11-16-1989, 57th General
Assembly (Jan. 19, 1989).89 The Legislature clearly did not intend for the SFCA to
exempt financial institutions from statutory claims and tortious wrongdoing.
Rhino Linings v. Rocky Mountain Rhino Linings, 62 P.3d 142 (Colo. 2003) recites
the elements that must be demonstrated to prove a CCPA cause of action.

Representative Kopel, a supporter of the bill, testified during the House Business Affairs Committee
Meeting:
“It’s happened in other states and its happened because there is some litigation at a very
high level for many millions of dollars where someone has claimed that a statement was
made to them by the credit industry, whether finance manager of a bank or whatever, and
sometimes courts have used that as a basis for determining yes, there was a contract even
though nothing was in writing because other individuals went ahead and relied upon the
oral representation.”

Assembly (Jan. 19, 1989).

1. The defendant engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade practice. The Fowlers
Complaint alleges BOA’s chronic neglect of statutory duties under RESPA, TILA and
C.R.S. 38- 40 -101 as an unfair trade practice under the CCPA.90 Complaint ¶ 26. As a
preliminary matter, RESPA violations have been recognized by Colorado courts as
sufficient predicates for the CCPA91. Courts of other states have likewise recognized
RESPA violations as sufficient predicates for ‘unfair and deceptive trade practice’
(‘UDAP’ = CCPA) claims.92
2. The challenged practice occurred in the course of defendant's business,
vocation, or occupation. The Defendant’s are in the business of originating and servicing
of loans and, in particular, the Fowlers loan as this term is defined in 12 U.S.C. §
2605(i)(2). See Complaint ¶ 9. The Fowlers Complaint adequately alleges that the
Defendant’s wrongful conduct occurred during the course of the Defendant’s business.
See Complaint ¶¶ 21 – 109.

Mass. July 28, 2011) (denying motion to dismiss Chapter 93A claims for misrepresenting that a permanent
modification would be approved following successful completion of a Trial Period and for “withholding
and changing information, providing pre-textual reasons for denying modification, and making misleading
statements regarding the process and the state of the loan” while engaged in negotiations); Belyea v. Litton

3. The practice significantly impacts the public as actual or potential consumers
of the defendant's goods, services, or property. The Defendant’s conduct against the
Fowlers and similar conduct against others have significant public impact. As
demonstrated by the case law cited in this Response and the Defendant’s signature on the
‘National Mortgage Settlement’, the Defendant’s behavior is widespread and has led to
people losing their homes. The Fowlers’ complaint and significant number cases
identified in this Response involve the Defendant in the same RESPA offense.
Many of the Fowler’s written enquires were related to one or more of their 13
HAMP applications. To voluntarily participate in the HAMP program, BOA signed an
agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring it to solicit the public.93
Additionally, BOA’s website, BankofAmerica.com, solicits the public to enroll in the
HAMP.94 Under Colorado law, mass marketing alone has been enough to meet the impact
element of the CCPA.95 In mass-market mailings, BOA solicited the Fowlers to
participate in the HAMP. Complaint Exhibits C: 8-11, 36-40, 47-49, 51-53, 55 and 97.
The logo: “Making Home Affordable” is on BOA’s mass marketing letterhead referring
to its participation in HAMP. BOA’s loan modification program impacts a significant
number of consumers.96
BOA’s abuse of the Fowlers and other borrowers meets the ‘public impact’

93

A copy of this agreement can be found at www.HMPAdmin.com/portal/programs/HAMP/jsp#2.

94

In the HAMP Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages and the Servicer Participation Agreement,
participating servicers are required to actively solicit borrowers to participate in HAMP before referring a
loan to foreclosure or conducting a scheduled foreclosure sale.

42

element of the CCPA in additional ways. BOA’s practices have a ‘per se’ effect on the
public interest because BOA actions violate statutes with specific legislative declarations
of ‘public interest’ impact.97 Courts have recognized such declarations as satisfying the
‘public impact’ element of deceptive trade practice statutes.98 Courts have also held that
wrongful behavior breach can involve the public interest if there is ‘potential for
repetition’.99 The Fowler’s case is one among hundreds holding the Defendants
accountable for their violation of RESPA claims. See fn’s 1, 3, 17, 19, 20, 26, 27, 40, 50,
62, 66, 67, 76, 78 infra and 101, 102 supra and see Complaint ¶ 88 listing 9 cases
brought against the Defendants for violations of RESPA. BOA’s involvement in RESPA
litigation with consumers around the nation is legion including class actions.100 BOA
signed a consent judgment in a suit brought by the Attorneys General of 49 states
agreeing to refrain from the very behavior that is the subject of this suit.101 The Court is
requested to take judicial notice of this case and consent judgment. See Complaint ¶
88(f). The sheer volume of litigation against the Defendants involving RESPA violations
97

See 12 U.S.C. 2601- Congressional findings and purpose (RESPA) and 15 U.S.C. 1601 Congressional
findings and purpose (TILA).

Campbell v. Seattle Engine Rebuilders, 75 Wash.App. 89, 876 P.2d 948 (1994); Aubrey’s R.V. Center,
Inc. v. Tandy Corp., 46 Wash.App. 595, 731 P.2d 1124 (1987); Shah v. Allstate Ins. Co., 121 P.3d
(Wash.Ct.App. 2005)(violation of insurance code affects public interest). Federal examples of public
interest impact include those in RESPA 12 U.S.C. 2601(a) and TILA 15 U.S.C. 1601(a).
99

Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. Safeco Title Ins. Co., 105 Wash.2d 778, 790, 719 P.2d 531
(1986); Bynum v. Klentak, 1999 Wash.App. LEXIS 76 (Jan. 19, 1999)(misrepresentations and building
code violations affect public interest where builder is continuing to build and sell homes).
100

In addition to hundreds of individual cases brought against BOA, it has settled or is currently involved in
multiple class actions for RESPA violations. One example includes: Voight v. BOA and BAC Home loan
Servicing, U.S. Dist. Ct. Case No. 2:10-cv-02052 (Cent. Dist. Ill. 2010)(class settlement est, between $7.5m
and $44m).
101

See case No. 1:12-cv-00361 (U.S. Dist. Ct, D.C., 2012), commonly known as ‘The National Mortgage
Settlement’, (page 41A, §IX, A. 1.: Servicing standards must be incompliance local, state and federal laws
and regulations). Signed by Niel A. Cotty, Chief Accounting officer, Bank of America, N.A.

suggest that “the [D]efendant’s challenged practice[s] significantly impacts the public as
actual or potential consumers of the [D]efendant’s goods, services or property.” Henson
v. Bank of America et.al., 935 F.Supp 2d 1128 (D.Colo. 2013) citing Hall v. Walter, 969
P.2d 224, 234 (Colo. 1998). Finally, BOA significantly impacts the public by virtue of its
size as one of the world’s leading financial institutions.102
4. The plaintiff suffered injury in fact to a legally protected interest. The Fowlers
interest in having the Defendants respond to their written enquiries is legally protected
under: 12 U.S.C. 2605(e), Reg. X §§1024.35 and 1024.36; Reg. Z §1026; and C.R.S.
§38-40-103.
5. The challenged practice caused the plaintiff's injury. The Fowlers adequately
alleged damages and causation in their Complaint and have provided receipts for damage
in their exhibits. Complaint ¶¶ 38, 39, 40, 41, 53, 54, 56, 66, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 80, 81,
89, 100, 101, 108, 109 & 110) (Complaint ¶¶ 31, 39, 40, 41, 100, 108 & 110). Complaint
Exhibits OS02-OS22 and PO1-PO31 (photocopies of receipts for expenses actually
incurred as a result of RESPA violations).
Aside from the verbal abuse and the time wasted by the Fowlers over the phone
and administratively, what makes the Defendant’s conduct so outrageous and extreme is
the Defendant’s indifference, the time period, the sheer number of written enquires it
ignored from the Fowlers.
102
