The United States submits the

following in support of its motion:
1.

This is an action to reduce federal tax assessments

made against Donald L. Hymes to judgment and to foreclose federal
tax liens on real property.

On April 10, 2006, defendants filed

nearly identical motions seeking their dismissal from this
action.

The United States filed a motion to extend its time to

respond, which the Court granted.
2.

The United States’ responses to these motions are

currently due to be filed on May 25, 2006.
3.

The United States respectfully requests an extension of

time of thirty (30) days to respond.

The requested extension of

time will allow the parties to attempt to resolve these motions
via stipulation.

Thus, this motion is not being made for delay,

but to allow the United States to prepare a cogent and accurate
response that advances this litigation.
6.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) authorizes this

Court to grant an extension of time for cause shown.
