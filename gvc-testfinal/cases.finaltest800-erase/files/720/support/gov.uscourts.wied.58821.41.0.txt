PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION FOR AUTHORIZATION OF COURT-APPROVED NOTICE TO
H-2B WORKERS EMPLOYED IN 2010 AND/OR 2011
This is an action by migrant workers from Mexico, who were recruited by defendants to
work as “trim-line laborers,” processing cabbage into sauerkraut at defendants’ cannery plant in
Bear Creek, Wisconsin. They came to work for defendants as part of the federal government’s
“H-2B” guest-worker program, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), which authorizes employers
like GLK to recruit and employ foreign workers on a temporary basis, after certifying that
domestic workers are not available to fill the positions.
For the 2010 season, GLK employed approximately 100 H-2B workers.1 For the 2011
season, GLK recruited and imported approximately 100 H-2B workers.2 Seventy-three H-2B

workers from 2010 and 2011 are already plaintiffs in this case. By this motion, plaintiffs seek
authorization to send notice to the remaining approximately 100 guest workers who worked
alongside them at GLK in 2010 and/or 2011, notifying them of the pendency of this action and
the opportunity to “opt in.”
Specifically, plaintiffs seek “conditional certification” pursuant to Section 216(b) of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C §§ 201-291 (“FLSA”), of the claim they have brought in
Count I of their First Amended Complaint. “The sole consequence of conditional certification is
the sending of court-approved written notice to employees, who, in turn become parties to a
collective action only by filing written consent with the court. § 216(b).” Genesis Healthcare
Corp. v. Symczyk, 133 S. Ct. 1523, 1530 (2013).
The gravamen of plaintiffs’ claim in Count I is that defendants violated the FLSA by
failing to reimburse plaintiffs and other similarly situated H-2B workers, in their first week of
work, for the expenses the workers incurred—for in-bound travel, recruitment, immigration and
related costs—in order to work for GLK during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. A “collective action”
under Section 216(b) provides a vehicle for aggregate litigation of FLSA claims, allowing “an

action to recover” wages under the FLSA “by any one or more employees for and in behalf of
himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
Defendants’ FLSA liability in this case arises as follows: Under the FLSA, if making H2B workers’ bear the out-of-pocket expenses they incurred for in-bound travel, recruitment, and
immigration fees would “effectively bring their wages below the FLSA minimum wage in their
first workweek of employment,” then an H-2B employer must reimburse those costs to the
workers, by or before the end of the workers’ first workweek, to avoid that outcome.3
Every one of the H-2B workers employed by GLK in 2010 and 2011 incurred expenses
of this kind, sometimes referred to, in shorthand, as “Arriaga expenses, see e.g., Arriaga v.
Florida Pacific Farms, LLC, 305 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir. 2002), in order to work for GLK. None of
them were reimbursed by GLK for these expenses before or by the end of the first workweek.
And the wage amounts they received, reduced by the unreimbursed expenses they had incurred,
uniformly pushed each of their first week’s wages below the federally-mandated and guaranteed
minimum wage (which cannot be modified by contract or otherwise4). See Ex. C, Ms. Garreton
Chavez Aff. ¶ 9. All of them therefore share a common claim for reimbursement, making a
“collective action” under FLSA § 216(b) appropriate in this case.
Accordingly, plaintiffs now move for a court order: (1) conditionally certifying Count I
as a collective action; (2) approving both the Proposed Notice attached hereto as Exhibit A and

workers; (3) directing defendants to produce the names, last-known addresses, telephone
numbers, visa numbers, and copies of the passports of their 2010 and 2011 H-2B workers and to
identify the towns in Mexico from which they recruited their H-2B workers within 10 days; and
(4) allowing a four-week opt-in period.
***
In section I of this memorandum, we summarize the material facts and show that this case
meets the threshold requirement for issuing notice pursuant to § 216(b), specifically, that
plaintiffs and other H-2B workers employed by GLK during 2010 and 2011 are “similarly
situated” with regard to their claims for underpayment of first-week wages, as alleged in Count I
of plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint. In section II, we describe the collective action procedure
of 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), including its differences from Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. In section III, we discuss
the terms of the Proposed Notice attached hereto as Exhibit A.
I.

Plaintiffs and All Other H-2B Workers at GLK in 2010 and 2011 Are Similarly
Situated For Purposes of § 216(b).
The work that H-2B workers perform is almost always hard, unpleasant, and poorly

paid.5 In fact, the almost universally unfavorable terms and conditions of H-2B employment are
very often the reason why H-2B employers, like GLK, are in a position to certify, as required by

federal law, that no domestic workers are available to fill the positions.6 But federal law provides
H-2B workers with some protections and among those protections is coverage under the FLSA.
Travel and Visa Expenses of H-2B Workers Under the FLSA, U.S. DOL Wage and Hour
Division, Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2009-2 (August 21, 2009) (Ex. F); Teoba v. Trugreen
Landcare LLC, 769 F. Supp. 2d 175, 183 (W.D.N.Y. 2011); De Leon-Granados v. Eller & Sons,
581 F. Supp. 2d 1295, 1309-10 (N.D. Ga. 2008); Gaxiola v. Williams Seafood of Arapahoe, Inc.,
776 F. Supp. 2d 117, 124 (E.D.N.C. 2011).
Because H-2B employment is covered by the FLSA, H-2B workers enjoy the same
protections against wage deductions and cost-shifting as other covered workers. In particular, as
relevant to this case, covered workers are protected against having to bear unreimbursed
expenses, incurred primarily for the benefit of the employer, when those expenses reduce their
wages below the federally-guaranteed minimum wage. See Marshall v. Root’s Restaurant, 667
F.2d 559, 560 (6th Cir. 1982) (finding FLSA violations from employer’s failure to reimburse
workers for required uniforms); 29 C.F.R. § 531.36(b) (restricting many wage deductions and
shifting of costs “to the extent that they reduce the wages of the employee in any such workweek
below the minimum required by the Act”).
Count I of plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint in this case alleges a violation of this
black-letter principle in the particular context of H-2B employment. As applied to H-2B
employment, this rule against shifting employment-related expenses to employees means that, as
a matter of law, H-2B employers must reimburse H-2B workers for the cost of their in-bound
travel, recruitment, immigration and related expenses before or by the end of the first workweek,

if those expenses, left unreimbursed, would push the worker’s wages for the first workweek
below the federally-mandated minimum wage.7 The gravamen of plaintiffs’ claim in Count I is
that: both in 2010 and 2011, GLK failed to reimburse its H-2B workers for the cost of their inbound travel, recruitment, immigration, and related expenses before or by the end of the first
workweek; that as a result of the magnitude of the expenses the workers incurred, and GLK’s
failure to reimburse them, the workers’ effective wages for their first workweek consequently
fell significantly below the federally-mandated statutory minimum wage; and that, therefore, a
judgment should be entered against the defendants for violation of the FLSA, requiring them to
pay back wages owed to the workers, to raise their first week’s wages to the federally-mandated
minimum.
For purposes of this motion, the expenses that GLK’s H-2B workers uniformly incurred,
GLK’s failure to reimburse them before or by the end of their first workweek, and the resulting
effect on the workers’ first week’s wages, are established by:

(a)

The affidavits of 19 plaintiffs that have been filed in support of this motion, which
document and establish the categories and magnitude of the visa, travel, recruitment
costs, and related expenses they and the rest of their cohort incurred to work for GLK;

(b)

Defendants’ payroll records, produced in discovery in this case;

(c)

Defendants’ interrogatory responses and third-party deposition testimony, submitted with
this memorandum; and

(d)

The affidavit of Monica Garreton Chavez, a paralegal for plaintiffs’ counsel, who, having
reviewed the plaintiffs’ records and the payroll records produced by GLK in discovery in
this case, summarizes those records, and the proof they provide both (1) that no H-2B
worker was reimbursed for the expenses they incurred for the benefit of GLK and (2) that
the wage amounts paid for the affiants’ first workweek, after taking into account the
expenses they incurred, fell short, indeed hundreds of dollars short, of the federallymandated minimum.

This evidence makes a more than ample showing that all H-2B workers employed by GLK in
2010 and 2011 are “similarly situated” for purposes of FLSA § 216(b), making conditional
certification of an opt-in collective action appropriate with regard to Count I of plaintiffs’ First
Amended Complaint.
A. The H-2B Workers Employed By GLK in 2010 and 2011 Are Each Similarly
Situated In That They All Incurred Considerable Expenses, For GLK’s Benefit,
In Order To Work For GLK.
As evidenced by the 19 affidavits from plaintiffs submitted in support of this motion, the
plaintiffs in this case and the rest of their cohort uniformly made large cash outlays, often with
considerable hardship, in order to come to work for GLK. They would not have made these
outlays except to work at GLK. All of the workers uniformly paid more than $348 U.S. dollars in
2010 and $307 U.S. dollars in 2011 to start work with GLK, for one or more of the following
items: (a) “recruitment” fees;8 (b) fees to obtain Mexican passports; (c) visa processing fees; (d)

travel expenses; (d) lodging, food, and other subsistence while their visas were processed and
approved; and (e) border-crossing fees charged by USCIS.9
As a matter of law, the workers incurred these Arriaga expenses for GLK’s benefit.
Arriaga, 305 F.3d at 1236; Salazar-Martinez, 781 F. Supp. 2d at 195; De Leon-Granados, 581 F.
Supp. 2d at 1308; Travel and Visa Expenses of H-2B Workers Under the FLSA, U.S. DOL Wage
and Hour Division, Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2009-2 (August 21, 2009) (Ex. F). And
factually, GLK agents oversaw the recruitment, travel and immigration process for the workers,
including organizing transportation, accommodations and visa processing for each group of GLK
workers and largely determined both the categories and magnitude of the Arriaga expenses the
workers incurred. The legal claim for reimbursement of these expenses is common to all the
workers, they share a unitary legal theory, and the majority of expenses incurred by the workers
are also uniform, since they stayed in the same hotels, traveled in the same buses, and obtained

9

There is some variation in the specific expenses incurred by each worker (in that, for example,
some paid recruitment fees while others did not). As a matter of law, these variations are
immaterial (and, indeed, minor variations in damages exist in virtually every FLSA collective
action). The variations are immaterial because in every case, notwithstanding minor variations in
the precise expenses incurred, every worker employed by GLK as an H-2B worker in 2010 or
2011 incurred expenses that: (a) were not reimbursed, (b) are recoverable under the FLSA and
the rule in Arriaga, and (c) were so large as to reduce the workers’ first week’s wages below the
federally- guaranteed minimum. All the workers therefore share a common legal claim for
reimbursement of Arriaga expenses under a unitary legal theory, namely, that the amounts they
incurred are reimbursable under the FLSA and Arriaga, that GLK’s failure to reimburse their
Arriaga expenses reduced their first week’s wages below the federally-mandated minimum, and
that the resulting payment of wages below the federally-mandated minimum violated the FLSA.

visas in the same location at the same time.10 With regard to the categories and magnitude of the
expenses they incurred, and the benefit to GLK of their having incurred them, the workers are all
“similarly situated” for purposes of Section 216(b).
B. GLK Treated All The Workers Similarly, Reimbursing None Of Them For
Their Travel, Immigration and Related Expenses At or Before The End of their
First Work Week.
GLK’s failure to reimburse Arriaga expenses to its H-2B workers is established by
GLK’s own payroll records. Those records document the number of hours worked by H-2B
workers during their first workweeks in 2010 and 2011, the wages they received, and the hourly
wage rates paid. They show no reimbursements. 11
In addition, GLK’s failure to reimburse these expenses is also established by the 19
affidavits from plaintiffs submitted with this memorandum, which likewise attest that no such
reimbursements were made to any H-2B worker in the first workweek.12

10

GLK workers traveled each year in 3 to 4 groups as determined by GLK agents. GLK agents
organized the travel and visa process and, in some cases, accompanied the workers. As a result,
the workers in each group incurred substantially the same Arriaga expenses. Ex. B, Mr. Dimas

Finally, GLK’s failure to reimburse these expenses is also confirmed by GLK’s response
to plaintiffs’ interrogatory No.11 and by deposition testimony. Plaintiffs’ Interrogatory No. 11
asked defendants to “identify for each H-2B worker, the amount(s) and date(s) that … you paid
or reimbursed the worker for recruitment, immigration or travel expenses” See Ex. E.
Defendants’ response states as follows:
GLK Foods contracted with LaborQuest for recruiting, visa processing and transportation
of H2B workers in 2010 and 2011 and with Dianne Guerrero and the Associates in 2006.
Upon information and belief, LaborQuest subcontracted some of the responsibilities to
Florida East Coast Travel [sic] Inc. GLK Foods paid LaborQuest for its services and
related expenses.
This response does not contend that GLK reimbursed any H-2B worker for the Arriaga expenses
he incurred. Instead, it states that “upon information and belief” LaborQuest and Florida East
Travel Services, as agents for Defendants, may have reimbursed H-2B workers for their
expenses. Representatives of each company, however, testified at their depositions that neither
company provided any reimbursements to H-2B workers and such reimbursements were the
responsibility of defendants. Deposition of Jorge Garcia 119:9-124:6; 136:7-16; 161:16-24;
164:1-7; Deposition of Thomas Robinson 40:20–48:10; 281:11–291:23; 335:14–340:17.
C. As A Result of the Expenses The Workers Incurred, and GLK’s Failure To
Reimburse Them For Those Expenses, The Workers’ Earnings For Their First
Workweek Fell Well Below The Federally-Mandated Minimum Wage.
The plaintiffs’ affidavits and defendants’ business records provide the Court with
evidence sufficient to establish both the Arriaga expenses that the workers incurred the amounts

they received in wages for their first workweek, and simple arithmetic establishes that the
difference between Arriaga expenses incurred and wages received resulted in earnings well
below the federally mandated minimum; indeed, many workers worked at a loss during their first
week at GLK.13
As evidence of this outcome and its uniformity, plaintiffs are submitting the affidavits of
19 plaintiffs, all attesting to the same predicament: large expenditures to come to Wisconsin,
unreimbursed by the defendants during the first week of work, reducing their first week’s
earnings below the minimum wage. The affiants have personal knowledge that defendants’
unlawful practices affected all H-2B workers across-the-board because the affiants traveled
together with the other workers from Mexico to Wisconsin, lived in the same barracks, and
worked side-by-side in Wisconsin.
The affidavits submitted with this motion provide specifics. In 2011, for instance, Mr.
Arroyo Lopez was required to spend approximately $1,614 to obtain his H-2B visa and work for
defendants; he grossed only $414.40 during his first week of work.14 Mr. Chavez Jimenez was
required to expend about $720 but grossed only $338.77.15 Mr. Nuñez Perez was required to

spend approximately $608 but grossed only $414.40.16 Similarly, in 2010, plaintiffs worked for
wages far below the minimum wage in their first work week as a result of the recruitment, travel
and visa expenses they incurred.17 Mr. Eduardo Robles Medina was required to pay about $500
but grossed only $298.30 during the first week of work.18 Mr. Rosas Jurado incurred about $500
in expenses but grossed only $299.87 during his first week.19
In addition, plaintiffs have submitted the affidavit of Ms. Garreton Chavez. Having
reviewed and summarized the payroll records produced by GLK, Ms. Garreton Chavez attests
that they show no reimbursements to H-2B workers for travel, immigration, or related expenses,
and that these during the first week of work in 2010 or 2011. Regarding the 19 affiants who
provide detailed accounts of their expenses that reduced the workers’ first weeks’ wages, Ms.
Garreton Chavez’s analysis shows that their wages fell short, indeed hundreds of dollars short, of

In 2011, the workers received no reimbursement at any time for travel, visa and recruitment. In
2010, according to defendants’ payroll records, the workers received an additional $121 in their
paychecks at the end of the second week of work. That payment may or may not have been
intended as a reimbursement for expenses, but it only represented a fraction of the workers’
actual expenses and, in addition, failed to comply with the FLSA’s requirement of
reimbursements by or before the end of the first week of work. See Ex. B, Mr. Jurado Jurado Aff.

the federally-mandated minimum.20 In several cases, the workers actually made less during their
first week than they were required to pay in travel and visa expenses.21
These facts more than suffice to show that all H-2B workers employed by GLK in 2010
and 2011 are similarly situated under the FLSA Count I of plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint
as an opt-in collective action under Section 216(b).
II.

The Conditions For Conditional Certification of an FLSA Opt-In Collective Action
Have Been Met.
Many courts, including this one, have adopted a two-step approach for evaluating

motions to conditionally certify an FLSA collective action and for court-authorized notice under
Section 216(b). See DeKeyser v. Thyssenkrupp Waupaca, Inc., No. 08-C-488, 2008 WL
5263750, *2 (E.D. Wis. Dec. 18, 2008).
As a “first step,” courts determine whether the “plaintiff has demonstrated a ‘reasonable
basis’ for believing that she is similarly situated to potential class members.” Schroeder v.
Humana, Inc., No. 12-C-0137, 2012 WL 5931886, *4 (E.D. Wis. Nov. 27, 2012). Factual
support for this showing typically is made “in the form of affidavits, declarations, deposition
testimony, or other documents” in order to demonstrate “some ‘factual nexus . . . or a common

policy that affects all the collective members.’” Id. (quoting Nehmelman v. Penn Nat’l Gaming,
Inc., 822 F. Supp. 2d 745, 750 (N.D. Ill. 2011)). Although not a “mere formality,” this is a
“lenient standard.” Id.
Subsequently, at “step two,” after notice has been sent and members of the collective
have had the opportunity to opt-in, the court determines “whether plaintiffs who have opted in
“are, in fact, similarly situated.” Id at *5.
The evidence submitted in connection with this motion amply satisfies plaintiffs’ burden
at “step one.” Plaintiffs in this case have made far greater than a “modest factual showing” that
“can connect them to ‘other potential plaintiffs as victims of an unlawful practice.’” Musch v.
Domtar Industries, Inc., 252 F.R.D. 456, 458 (W.D. Wis. 2008) (quoting Austin v. Cuna Mut.
Ins. Soc’y, 232 F.R.D. 601, 605 (W.D. Wis. 2006)).
GLK’s recruitment, hiring and procurement of H-2B workers in 2010 and 2011 was
standardized and implemented in such a way that recruitment, travel, visa and transportation
processes and resulting Arriaga expenses for the workers were largely uniform. The workers
brought to work for GLK were all subjected to the same unlawful practice – GLK effectively
paid them less than the minimum wage in their first week of work by requiring them to bear the
burden of Arriaga expenses, which they had incurred for the benefit of GLK.
The evidence submitted by plaintiffs in support of this motion would satisfy even Rule
23’s more rigorous standards—although there are decades of precedent distinguishing the
standards for conditionally certifying an FLSA opt-in collective action from the more rigorous

14

Case 1:12-cv-00209-WCG Filed 05/08/13 Page 14 of 21 Document 41

standards attendant to Rule 23 opt-out classes.22 Plaintiffs’ claim in Count I presents clear
predominating questions that will “generate common answers” and will drive the resolution of
the litigation for all H-2B workers employed by GLK during 2010 and/or 2011, Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011), and these common questions, and the
corresponding common answers, include, at a minimum: (a) whether the FLSA requires
reimbursement of recruitment, visa, travel, immigration and/or other related expenses if shifting
them to H-2B workers would push their first week’s wages below the federally mandated
minimum; (b) which of those expenses must be reimbursed; and (c) the existence of GLK’s
across-the-board policy or practice of not reimbursing them to H-2B workers.
“The only individual issues [here]—issues found in virtually every class action in which
damages are sought—concern the amount of harm to particular class members,” Butler v. Sears,
Roebuck & Co., 702 F.3d 359, 363 (7th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added), and those kinds of
differences in damages amounts are not an impediment to certification of an opt-in or opt-out
class. Quite to the contrary.
As the Seventh Circuit emphasized in Butler, cases like this one are classic examples of
instances in which aggregate litigation becomes “efficient not only in cost, but also in efficacy”
for a straightforward reason: “the stakes” for any individual member of the collective “would be
too small to justify the expense of suing,” and the number of potential members of the collective

is in the dozens, not the thousands or millions. Id. at 362. In such cases, damages do not prevent
certification. Instead, “if necessary,” damages can be addressed “by individual hearings to
determine the damages sustained by each class member” after a classwide determination of the
liability issue. Id. See also Harris v. comScore, Inc., 2013 WL 1339262 *10 (N.D. Ill., April 2,
2013) (same).
Moreover, in this case, the damages incurred by the H-2B workers were standardized
expenses imposed or charged by the defendants rather than individually and uniquely incurred by
each worker. As part of GLK’s recruitment process, GLK agents divided the workers into
groups. Each group traveled together on buses arranged by GLK, applied for visas with agents
designated by GLK, stayed in hotels chosen by GLK, and took taxis arranged by GLK agents.23
The visa, passport, and border crossing fees incurred by workers were also standardized.24 As
such, the expenses incurred by the workers were generally standardized by GLK and are
therefore appropriate for collective action resolution.

Case 1:12-cv-00209-WCG Filed 05/08/13 Page 16 of 21 Document 41

This case is also particularly well-suited for conditional certification because of the
already demonstrated strong interest on the part of the workers. See DeKeyser, 2008 WL 53750,
at *5 (noting, “[a]s sixty-seven individuals [out of a putative class of 4,000] have already opted
into this litigation prior to the dissemination of any court-approved notice, there is sufficient
interest in the litigation to support conditional certification”). Out of a potential cohort of about
200 H-2B workers, sixty-two (62) (almost a quarter of the total H-2B cohort) had already joined
the litigation prior to the filing of the Complaint, and an additional 7 individuals have since opted
in.
Motions to authorize notice and a collective action have been approved in many other
cases similar to this one.25 In this case, this Court should conditionally certify this case as a
collective action on behalf of:
All workers employed by defendants in Bear Creek, Wisconsin at any time in 2010 or
2011 pursuant to defendants’ H-2B applications approved by the U.S. Department of
Labor.

25

See De Luna-Guerrero v. North Carolina Growers Ass’n., 338 F. Supp. 2d 649, 655 (E.D.N.C.
2004) (holding, “[this] action falls within the theoretical framework governing [FLSA] class
actions,” where H-2A plaintiffs allege defendants’ reimbursement policy resulted in common
FLSA minimum wage violations). Indeed, in nearly identical cases involving proposed collective
actions on behalf of H-2B workers, district courts have routinely granted certification. See, e.g.,
Teoba v. Trugreen Landcare, LLC, No. 10-CV-6132, 2011 WL 3555729 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 11,
2011) (approving notice to FLSA class of H-2B workers); Gaxiola v. Williams Seafood of
Arapahoe, Inc., No. 4:08-CV-134-H(3) (E.D.N.C. June 16, 2009) (conditionally certifying

III.

Both Written Notice and an In-Person Meeting Are Essential to Prevent the
Expiration of Potential Opt-In Plaintiffs’ Claims.
Notice is particularly important in FLSA cases because, unlike the procedure under Rule

23, for an FLSA opt-in “class,” the statute of limitations continues to run on each individual
worker’s claims until that worker files a consent with the court, becoming a party plaintiff.26 29
U.S.C. § 216(b); see also Harkins v. Riverboat Services, Inc., 385 F.3d 1099, 1102 (7th Cir.
2004).
In this case, most potential opt-in plaintiffs speak little or no English.27 They are migrant
workers from remote areas of Mexico with slow and unreliable mail service, who likely do not
have regular access to international phone and fax services.28 Although many plaintiffs are from
villages within proximity of each other, many do not know their fellow GLK co-workers’ full

26

Pursuant to the parties’ tolling agreement entered on July 13, 2012, the statute of limitations is
tolled for the Count I claims of the 2010 H-2B workers. ECF No. 26-1. Either party may
terminate the tolling agreement upon 60 days’ notice. The statute of limitations on the claims of
2011 H-2B workers has not been tolled. Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint asserts that
defendants’ FLSA violations were willful and thus subject to a three-year statute of limitations.
See 29 U.S.C. § 255(a).

names or addresses.29 Plaintiffs seek approval to mail the proposed notice, in Spanish, to each H2B worker employed by GLK in 2010 or 2011 for whom defendants can provide or plaintiffs can
independently find a mailing address. See Ex. A, Proposed Notice. To account for likely gaps in
potential opt-in workers’ contact information and poor mail delivery in rural Mexico, plaintiffs
also request leave to organize and advertise in-person meetings between a representative of
plaintiffs’ counsel and potential opt-in plaintiffs in Mexico in public locations in towns identified
by defendants as towns from which workers were recruited.
A. Defendants Should Disclose, Within 10 Days, Identifying Information For All 2010
and 2011 H-2B Workers, Including Production of Passports For All Workers and
Identification of the Towns in Mexico From Which Workers Were Recruited.
To facilitate notice, plaintiffs request the Court to order defendants to produce, in a
computer-readable format, the names, last-known addresses, telephone numbers, passport
numbers, and visa numbers for all H-2B workers employed by defendants in Bear Creek in 2010
or 2011, within 10 days. See, e.g., Howard, 2009 WL 140126, at *9 (ordering defendants to turn
over a list of names and last-known addresses of the putative class members in a computerreadable format within 10 working days).
To facilitate plaintiffs’ proposed in-person meetings, plaintiffs also request the Court to
order defendants to (a) produce copies of the H-2B workers’ passports, because they indicate the

town where the person was born, and (b) identify the towns from which workers were recruited
in 2010 and 2011.
B. The Court Should Approve Plaintiffs’ Proposed Notice and Consent Forms and Set
a Four-Week Opt-In Period for Responses.
Once defendants have provide plaintiffs with information to locate and identify potential
collective members, plaintiffs believe a four-week long opt-in period, following the mailing of
the notices, will be sufficient to allow for additional plaintiffs to opt-in.30
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: (1) to
conditionally certify Count I as a collective action; (2) to approve the Proposed Notice31 and
plaintiffs’ proposal to organize a meeting in Mexico to meet with as yet unidentified H-2B
workers; (3) to direct defendants to produce the names, last-known addresses, telephone
numbers, visa numbers and a copy of the passports of their 2010 and 2011 H-2B workers, and
30

Courts have routinely provided much longer opt-in periods than the four-weeks requested by
plaintiffs where workers live outside of the United States and are difficult to locate. See Gonzalez
v. Ridgewood Landscaping, Inc., No. H-09-2992, 2010 WL 1903602, at *8 (S.D. Tex. May 10,
2010) (four-month opt-in period for Spanish speaking putative collective members, many of
whom live in other countries); Cuzco v. Orion Builders, Inc., 477 F. Supp. 2d 628, 635
(S.D.N.Y. 2007) (nine-month opt-in period because many prospective plaintiffs are transient
laborers); Roebuck, 239 F. Supp. 2d at 240-41 (nine-month FLSA notice period for collective of
migrant farm workers). In the interest of economy and efficiency and given the relatively small
number (under 100) of absentees in this action, however, plaintiffs only request a four-week
period after notice is sent for additional plaintiffs to opt-in. The information –as requested by
this motion –provided by defendants regarding the identity, contact information, and location of
recruitment of all potential opt-ins is essential to effective notice in this case. Given their
experience representing migrant workers from Mexico, plaintiffs’ counsel are confident they will
be able to expediently provide notice to potential opt-in plaintiffs once defendants have provided
the necessary information.
31

Plaintiffs’ counsel will translate the notice and consent forms into Spanish upon approval of
the English-language versions.
