CIVIL ACTION
FILE NO.: 5:09-cv-399

PLAINTIFF’S CONSOLIDATED BRIEF IN OPPOSITION
TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS

COMES NOW, Plaintiff John Kirk Owens and files his Brief in Opposition to
Defendant John Abernathy’s Motion to Dismiss, as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Owens’ Complaint sets forth 142 paragraphs of specific factual averments
supporting two civil rights claims against Abernathy: False Arrest (Doc. #1, Count I,
¶157-169) and Malicious Prosecution (Doc. #1, Count II, ¶ 157-169). As to each claim,
Owens’ Complaint adequately alleges two theories of liability. First, Owens contends
that Abernathy deficient investigation violated the Fourth Amendment. Abernathy
ignored exculpatory evidence and failed to take objectively reasonable steps to

Page 1 of 25

corroborate the scant evidence of probable cause he had prior to arresting Owens.
Second, Owens alleges that Abernathy violated the Fourth Amendment by making
materially false statements and recklessly omitting facts material to probable cause from
his warrant applications.
Abernathy seeks dismissal of Owens’ Complaint based on the affirmative
defense of qualified immunity. Abernathy does not contend that the law applicable to
Owens’ claims was not clearly established; instead, he challenges whether Owens has
adequately stated a constitutional violation. (Doc. # 22, p. 6-8 (sufficiency of
investigation), p. 8-14 (probable cause for warrant application), and p. 15-18 (same
arguments – malicious prosecution claim)). In other words, Abernathy seeks dismissal
solely on the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.
The Court should deny Abernathy’s motion. Abernathy’s Answer raises certain
disputed issues of material fact that prevent the Court from ruling on his motion at the
pleadings stage. Even if the Court considers Abernathy’s motion on the merits, Owens’
has adequately pled violations of his Fourth Amendment rights, therefore, Abernathy is
not entitled to qualified immunity.

STATEMENT OF FACTS2
I.

THE ROBBERIES
The suspect started his robbing spree at a Marathon gas station in Twiggs

County on September 27, 2007. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 26-30). He robbed the First Bank in
McDonough on October 27th and hit Colonial Bank in Bibb County on November 2nd.
(Doc. # 1, ¶ 32-38; 42-44). He robbed the Capitol City Bank in Bibb County on
November 19, 2007. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 51-52). He committed his robberies in broad daylight,

Owens limits his presentation of the facts here, expecting that the Court will properly
consider all non-conclusory facts in his Complaint, accepting them as true for purposes
of this Motion. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007).

usually around lunch time. He was calm. Except for the first robbery, he never
brandished a weapon. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 26-52).

He was a white man of average height, maybe 5’7” to 5’11”. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 32-37;
43; 51). He appeared to be middle-aged. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 43). He had a mustache,
sometimes a stubbly beard. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 32-37; 43; 51). He had a jowly face and thick
neck. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 32-37; 43; 51). He was fat like some football lineman – an enormous
belly bursting out well beyond his beltline. (Exhibit A, 000017-18). He wore a broad
brimmed camouflage hat to hide his hair and dark sunglasses to cover his eyes. He
wore long, flowing shirts, jeans and white tennis shoes. (Exhibit A, 000017-18). There is
no telling how many middle aged white men living between Macon and Atlanta loosely
fit the general description of the robber.
The grainy surveillance pictures were also of little help. The pictures were all
taken from above, thus capturing images of the floppy hat and the lower half of the
robber’s face. The pictures showed that the robber had a fat, round face and a
mustache, but no readily identifiable features at all. (Exhibit A, 000017-18). The robber
left very little evidence behind. No fingerprints were collected and there was no other
physical evidence. The robber had all the markings of a pro.
Each robbery did have one consistent feature: the “get away” truck was a late
model Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck, beige or gold in color, tinted windows and a
no tag. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 29, 38, 52; Exhibit A, 000017-18). The “get away” truck was the best
lead available to law enforcement.

II.

THE INVESTIGATION
A.

The Investigators

Defendant William Stokes, a criminal investigator with the Twiggs County
Sheriff’s Office (“TCSO”) was assigned to investigate the September 27th robbery at the
Marathon gas station. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 30). Between September 27th and November 21st,
Stokes made no progress in his investigation. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 104). Stokes never
independently identified Owens as a suspect and no witness to Twiggs county robbery
ever picked Owens from a line up.
Defendant Kenneth Noble, a detective in the McDonough Police Department
(“MPD”), was assigned to investigate the October 27th robbery at the First Bank in
Henry County. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 40). Between October 27th and November 16th, Noble made
no progress in his investigation. No witness to the First Bank robbery ever identified
Owens as a suspect and Noble never collected a shred of physical evidence tying
Owens to the robbery. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 41).
Defendant John Abernathy, an investigator in the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office
(“BCSO”) was ultimately responsible for investigating the November 2nd robbery at the
Colonial Bank and the November 19th robbery at the Capitol bank. Abernathy had no
leads and no suspects prior to November 20th, when Noble first contacted him about
Owens.

B.

The Jail Trustee

On November 16th, a jail trustee assigned to clean up duty saw the surveillance
picture of the robber hanging on the wall in the detectives’ room at MPD. The jail
trustee mentioned to Noble that the robber looked like Owens. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 46). He said
Owens was going through a bad divorce and was talking about bankruptcy. (Doc. # 1, ¶
48). Despite having no prior experience with the jail trustee, Noble anointed him as a
“reliable source” and decided that Owens would be his prime suspect. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 47,
57).
Noble pulled Owens’ driver’s license information. He learned that his license
was valid and he lived in McDonough. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 58). Noble did not investigate
whether Owens owned his home or whether he was in danger of losing his home to
foreclosure (facts that might corroborate the jail trustee’s claims of Owens’ financial
struggles. Noble also did not check the Superior Court records to see if Owens was
going through a divorce. Noble pulled a DMV report showing that Owens owned two
older model Ford pick-up trucks, but no late-model Chevrolet Silverado matching the
description of the “get away” truck. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 67). Noble pulled Owens’ criminal
history showing that Owens’ had two alcohol related misdemeanors from the late
1980s. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 69). None of the information corroborated the jail trustee’s
identification of Owens.

Page 6 of 25

Noble ordered a copy of Owens’ driver’s license picture. He knew that the
picture was at least three years old and, with a little effort could have learned that the
picture was actually seven years old. Noble made no effort to ensure that the picture
accurately depicted Owens’ appearance in the Fall of 2007. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 64). Noble put
Owens’ seven year old picture in a six person photographic line up based solely on the
statement of the jail trustee. He showed the line up to the four witnesses at First Bank,
but none of the witnesses identified Owens or anyone else. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 73-77). Noble
had no reliable evidence that Owens committed the First Bank robbery.
B.

Noble Gives Owens To Abernathy As The Suspect

While Noble was busy trying to pin the robberies on an innocent man, the actual
suspect robbed the two Bibb County banks. Noble learned of the robberies and
called Abernathy. He told Abernathy he had a similar robbery and identified Owens as
a “potential suspect.” (Doc. # 1, ¶ 81, 82).
The case had grown cold until I received a phone call from a Detective
Noble from McDonough Police Department. He said that he had heard
about this robbery and it sounded like the same guy that robbed a bank
up there. They had gotten some photos from their robbery and the
suspect had been identified as a John Kirk Owens. He said that a trustee
in their jail had seen the pictures from their bank robbery and identified
Owens. He gave me Owens’ physical description and it matched closely
to our suspects. He was able to email me pictures of Owens. He said that
Owens had a couple of DUI’s on his record but no felonies. He had Owens
in a photo lineup to show his victims but no one could identify him.
(Ex. A, 00015, compare, Doc. # 11, ¶ 82).

Page 7 of 25

Abernathy knew that Noble identified Owens as a “suspect” based solely on the
jail trustee’s statement. Abernathy knew that Owens had not been identified by any of
the First Bank witnesses. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 84-85). Abernathy knew that Owens’ criminal
history was unremarkable. (Doc. # 11, ¶ 84). Abernathy knew, or with reasonable effort,
should have known that Owens did not own a vehicle matching the “get away” truck.
(Doc. # 1, ¶ 84). Abernathy engaged in no independent investigation to solidify Owens
status as a suspect prior to placing him in a photographic line up for the witnesses at
Colonial Bank and Capitol City Bank. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 86).
Abernathy used Noble’s outdated picture of Owens for his six person
photographic line-up. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 87). Like Noble, he made no effort to determine
whether the picture fairly depicted Owens’ appearance in the Fall of 2007. Abernathy
showed the line up to all the witnesses at Colonial and Capitol City banks. (Doc. # 1, ¶
88-89; 91-92). One witness, Amy Gorham, picked Owens out of the line up. Gorham
had previously described the robber as “an older man wearing a camp brim hat, black
sunglasses, a long sleeve denim button down shirt with a white T-shirt underneath,
and denim jeans.” She could not describe any specific identifying features of the
robber. (Doc. #1, ¶ 89, 90, 43).3

3

Abernathy now claims that Nadia Jones identified Owens. (Doc. # 11, ¶ 92, 94). But see
Ex. A, 000014-15).

Page 8 of 25

On November 21st, Abernathy swore out two arrest warrants for Owens charging
him with Robbery by Intimidation at Colonial bank and Capitol City bank. It is
undisputed that the only evidence supporting Abernathy’s warrant application
consisted of Amy Gorham’s identification. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 93, 95). The Capitol City bank
application contained an outright falsehood: no eyewitness identified Owens. In both
warrant applications, Abernathy recklessly disregarded the truth by misrepresenting
and omitting facts material to a probable cause determination. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 94, 96). A
reasonably prudent officer in Abernathy’s position would have taken additional steps
to corroborate Gorham’s identification prior to swearing out arrest warrants for Owens.
Instead, Abernathy drove to Henry County, met with Noble and drove to
Owens’ home. When Abernathy saw Owens for the first time, he ignored the obvious
fact that Owens did not resemble the robber, nor did he resemble his outdated driver’s
license photograph. Abernathy did not pause and reflect; he just arrested Owens. These
were not the actions of an objectively reasonable, well-trained law enforcement officer.
(Doc. # 1, ¶ 130, 131). To make things worse, Abernathy arrested Owens before Noble
completed his search of Owens’ home. Any objectively reasonable, well-trained officer
would wait to see if the search uncovered evidence tying Owens to the robberies. When
he learned that Noble found nothing at all during the search, Abernathy did not pause
and reconsider, he took Owens straight to jail.

Page 9 of 25

Abernathy confronted no exigent circumstances when he chose to arrest Owens.
He had ample time to ensure that he was arresting the right man. Had Abernathy
hesitated for just a day, he would have learned that Owens had lived in McDonough his
entire life. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 14-25). He would have learned that Owens had strong ties to the
community. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 14-25). He would have learned that Owens owned the
McDonough Fence Company and had been in business for more than twenty years.
(Doc. # 1, ¶ 16).
Most critically, Abernathy would have learned that Owens had solid alibis for
each of the four robberies. On September 27th while the suspect was robbing the
Marathon store in Twiggs County, Owens was making a deposit at the McIntosh State
Bank in McDonough. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 31). On October 27th while the suspect was robbing
the First Bank Owens was installing gates at the residence of Charles Toll in
McDonough. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 39). On November 2nd, while the suspect was robbing the
Colonial Bank, Owens was an hour away repairing a fence for Southern Pipe and
Supply in McDonough. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 45). On November 19th while the suspect was
robbing the Capitol City bank, Owens was giving an estimate to Shannon Reyome in
McDonough. (Doc. # 1, ¶ 53). Given that the same robber committed all four robberies,
just one of these alibis would be enough to eliminate Owens as a suspect in all four
robberies.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITIES
I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Abernathy has filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6)

and seeks dismissal on qualified immunity grounds. In light of the Supreme Court’s
decisions Bell South v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal et
al, -- U.S. -- , 129 S. Ct. 1937 , 1949 (2009), a complaint “must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft
v. Iqbal et al, -- U.S. -- , 129 S. Ct. 1937 , 1949 (2009). “A claim has facial plausibility when
the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”4 Id. The Court “may
dismiss a Complaint, only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of
facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.” Swierkiewicz, supra at 513.
Ashcroft involved dismissal of a complaint on qualified immunity grounds and
made no mention of a heightened pleading standard in qualified immunity cases.
Instead, the Court held that “Rule *8+ in turn governs the pleading standard “in all civil
actions and proceedings in the United States district courts. Our decision in Twombly
expounded the pleading standard for all civil actions and it applied to antitrust and
discrimination suits alike.” Ashcroft, 129 S. Ct. at 1951. Ashcroft overrules the Eleventh
Circuit’s heightened pleading standard in qualified immunity cases.

II.

THE COURT SHOULD CONSTRUE ABERNATHY’S MOTION AS A RULE 56 MOTION,
PROVISIONALLY DENY THE MOTION, AND PERMIT DISCOVERY.
Abernathy filed his Answer (Doc. #11) prior to filing his Motion to Dismiss.

(Doc. # 21, 22). A Rule 12(b) motion “must be made before pleading if a responsive
pleading is allowed.” Under Rule 12(c), a party may move for judgment on the
pleadings “after the pleadings are closed – but early enough not to delay trial.”
Abernathy’s motion might well be considered under Rule 12(c), but for the contents of
Abernathy’s Answer.
In his Answer, Abernathy alternately (a) admits the allegation, but supplements
his admission with additional facts; (b) denies the allegation and supplements with facts
that directly conflict with the allegations in Owens’ Complaint; or (c) states that he is
“without sufficient information upon which to form a belief as to the veracity of the
allegation and thus can neither admit nor deny the same.” (See e.g., Doc. #1, ¶ 42, 44,
51, 59, 60-63, 68, 81-82, 92-94; Doc. # 11, ¶ 42, 44, 51, 59, 60-63, 68, 81-82, 92-94). In this
situation, the Court has no choice but to convert Abernathy’s motion into a summary
judgment motion and, normally, “all parties shall be given reasonably opportunity to
present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.” Horsley v. Feldt et al,
304 F.3d 1125, 1134 (11th Cir. 2002). However, as Abernathy must admit to the existence
of disputed issues of material fact (after all, he created them), the Court should instead

Page 12 of 25

provisionally deny Abernathy’s motion, permit discovery and reconsider Abernathy’s
motion following the close of the discovery period.
In the event that the Court elects to instead consider Abernathy motion under
Rule 12(c), Owens respectfully requests that the Court consider the documents attached
hereto as exhibits to Owens’ Brief pursuant to the “incorporation by reference doctrine.”
Horsley v. Feldt et al, 304 F.3d 1125, 1134 (11th Cir. 2002). The Court may consider
documents outside the pleadings “without converting the motion into one for summary
judgment if the document is: (1) central to the plaintiff’s claim; and (2) undisputed.
Undisputed in this context means that the authenticity of the document is not
challenged.” Id. Owens has attached documents produced by the Bibb County
Sheriff’s Office in response to an Open Records Act request. These documents are
central to Owens’ claims and there is no dispute as to authenticity.
III.

ABERNATHY IS NOT ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY
Just last year, the Supreme Court reiterated that qualified immunity is meant to

strike a balance between important competing interests.
Qualified immunity balances two important interests, the need to hold
public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and
the need to shield officers from harassment, distraction, and liability when
they perform their duties reasonably.
Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815 (2009). Courts must keep this
overarching purpose in mind as they consider a qualified immunity defense.

Page 13 of 25

A public official asserting qualified immunity must initially prove that “he was
acting within his discretionary authority when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.”
Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1195 (11th Cir. 2002).5 The burden then shifts to the plaintiff,
who must prevail on both prongs of the Supreme Court’s sequential test. See Saucier v.
Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (2001); but see, Pearson, supra (overruling Saucier’s
“rigid order of battle”). Abernathy seeks dismissal only as to the first question –
whether Owens has adequately pled a constitutional violation. As Owens’ Complaint
adequately alleges his constitutional claims against Abernathy, the Court should deny
the motion.
A.

OWENS’ COMPLAINT SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE
FOURTH AMENDMENT BY ABERNATHY

Abernathy arrested Owens pursuant to two facially valid warrants, thus the
Court must apply well-established law of arrests pursuant to a valid warrant.6 Malley v.
Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 344, 106 S. Ct. 1092 (1986); Garmon v. Lumpkin County, Ga., 878 F.2d
1406, 1409-1410 (11th Cir. 1989). The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment
requires that all warrant applications contain sufficient information to establish
probable cause. Holmes v. Kucynda et al, 321 F.3d 1069, 1083 (11th Cir. 2003). In Gerstein

Owens alleges that Abernathy was acting within the scope of his discretionary
authority and Abernathy admits the same. (Doc. # 1 , ¶ 11; Doc. # 11, ¶ 11);
6
Owens asserts two claims under the Fourth Amendment – false arrest and malicious
prosecution. The law and the facts applicable to these claims are nearly
indistinguishable, so Owens addresses these claims together.
5

Page 14 of 25

v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 112, 95 S.Ct. 854 (1975), the Supreme Court defined the probable
cause standard in these terms,
The standard for arrest is probable cause, defined in terms of facts and
circumstances sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the
[suspect]had committed or was committing an offense. This standard,
like those for searches and seizures, represents a necessary
accommodation between the individual’s right to liberty and the State’s
duty to control crime.
Long prevailing standards seek to safeguard citizens from rash and
unreasonable interferences with privacy and from unfounded charges of
crime. They also give fair leeway for enforcing the law for the
community’s protection. Because the situations which confront officers in
the course of their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be
allowed fro some mistakes on their part. But the mistakes must be those
of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of
probability. The rule of probable cause is a practical, non technical
conception affording the best compromise that has been found for
accommodating these opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly
hamper law enforcement. To allow less would bet o leave law abiding
citizens at the mercy of the officers’ whim or caprice.
(internal citations omitted); accord, Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 228, 112 S.Ct. 534
(1991).
In qualified immunity cases, “what counts . . .relating to probable cause to arrest
is the information known to the defendant officers or officials at the time of their
conduct, not facts known tot the plaintiff then or those known to a court later.” Jones v.
Cannon, 174 F.3d 1271, 1283, n. 4 (1999). However, in assessing “the facts and
circumstances within the officers’ knowledge,” the Court,

Page 15 of 25

must charge [the officer] with possession of all the information reasonably
discoverable by an officer acting reasonably under the circumstances . . . A
police officer may not close his or her eyes to facts that would help
clarify the circumstances of an arrest.
Kingsland v. City of Miami, 382 F.3d 1220, 1228 (11th Cir. 2004)(emphasis added).7 It is
not enough that an officer have a subjective belief that the “facts alleged in his affidavit
are true;” the Court must conduct an objective inquiry as to “whether a reasonably
well-trained officer would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable
cause and that he should have not applied for the warrant.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S.
at 345.
i.

Abernathy’s Investigation Violated The Fourth Amendment

A police officer “is not required to explore and eliminate every theoretically
plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest;” however, an officer cannot
“chose to ignore information that has been offered to him . . . nor may the officer
conduct an investigation in a biased fashion or elect not to obtain easily discoverable
facts.” Kingsland v. City of Miami, 382 F.3d 1220, 1228-1229 (11th Cir. 2004)(emphasis
added).8 Abernathy blindly accepted an unreliable informant’s identification of Owens
as a potential suspect from a grainy surveillance photograph, he ignored information

7

See also, Sevigny v. Dicksey, 846 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1998); BeVier v. Hucal, 806 F.2d
123, 128 (7th Cir. 1986).
8

See also, BeVier v. Hucal, 806 F.2d 123, 128 (7th Cir. 1986)(“a police officer may not
close his eyes to facts that would help clarify the circumstances of an arrest.”).

Page 16 of 25

establishing Owens’ innocence, failed to obtain basic, readily available evidence that
would have eliminated Owens as a suspect and, in the absence of any exigency, failed
to take deliberate steps to corroborate his only piece of evidence – Amy Gorham’s
identification.
The Jail Trustee
The record is clear that Noble and Abernathy took no steps to determine whether
the jail trustee who identified Owens as a possible suspect was reliable. More than ten
years ago, the Eleventh Circuit held that law enforcement’s improper reliance on an
unreliable informant as a basis for an arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. Ortega v.
Christian, 85 F.3d 1521 (11th Cir. 1996).
Following a robbery in Miami, a confidential informant told a detective that an
organized group of which he was a member committed the robbery and identified
Ortega as one of the suspects. Ortega, 85 F.3d at 1523. Ortega proclaimed his innocence,
bit the officer ignored him. Id. at 1524. The Eleventh Circuit held that the informant’s
tip did not establish probable cause. The court considered the informant’s “veracity,
reliability, basis of knowledge and corroboration of the details of the informant’s tip
through independent police work.” Id. at 1525. The court noted that the officer did not
“take any independent steps to investigate the informant’s tip or had any evidence prior
to arresting Ortega” to corroborate the informants statement. Id.

Page 17 of 25

Noble and Abernathy had no past history with the jail trustee Noble and
Abernathy made no effort to determine whether the informant actually knew Owens.
No effort was made to corroborate the details of the informant’s story about Owens’
divorce and financial troubles. The information that Noble and Abernathy did gather –
Owens’ driving history, his criminal history and his motor vehicle report – offered no
corroboration at all of the informant’s tale.
Abernathy responds that a single eye witness identification was all the
corroboration he needed to establish probable cause and rob Owens of his liberty.
Abernathy misses the point. Some objectively reasonable basis must exist for putting a
potential suspect in a photographic line up. That basis must consist of more than a
hunch, or uninformed suspicion and cannot rely solely on the uncorroborated statement
of an unreliable informant. See e.g. Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 110 S. Ct. 2412
(1990)(anonymous tip corroborated by independent police work creates sufficient
indicia of reliability to support reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop, but not
probable cause). Abernathy had an informant’s identification of Owens with no
corroboration through independent police work. Abernathy had no objectively
reasonable basis for putting Owens in a photographic line up in the first place. See e.g.,
United States v. Campbell, 920 F.2d 793, 797 (11th Cir. 1991)(unlike White where the police
corroborated the informant’s tip, there was no corroboration and thus no probable
cause to detain a suspect).

Page 18 of 25

Putting Owens in a photographic line up without any objectively reasonable
basis exposed him to the “vagaries of eyewitness identification.”
The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-kown; the annals of
criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification. Mr. Justice
Frankfurter once said: “What is the worth of identification testimony even
when uncontradicted? The identification of strangers is proverbially
untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a
formidable number of instances in the records of English and American
trials. These instances are recent – not due to the brutalities of ancient
criminal procedure..
United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 228, 87 S.Ct. 1926 (1967). Placing a suspect in a photo
line up on a whim, rather than through concrete evidence marking him as a legitimate
suspect, greatly increases the risk of misidentification and wrongful arrest.
The Rest of The Investigation
Abernathy engaged in no investigation. By his own admission, the case “had
grown cold” before Noble called him on November 19th. Abernathy adopted Noble’s
plainly deficient investigation without the least concern that Owens might actually be
innocent. He ignored all the exculpatory evidence Noble grudgingly revealed to him.
He ignored the fact that only one person, Gorham, picked Owens out of a photographic
line up shown to ten witnesses at three different robberies. When he arrested Owens,
he ignored the fact that Owens actual physical appearance was starkly different than
the outdated driver’s license picture and, more significantly, the actual robber.
Abernathy even ignored the fact that Noble failed to find any physical evidence during
this search of Owens’ home.

In Kingsland, supra, the Eleventh Circuit reversed a grant of summary judgment
to the arresting officers in part because they conducted a constitutionally deficient
investigation. Adopting the Fourth Circuit’s approach in Sevigny v. Dicksey, 846 F.2d
953 (4th Cir. 1988), the Eleventh Circuit held that officer’s must be charged “with
possession of all the information reasonably discoverable by an officer acting
reasonably under the circumstances. ”
The Sixth Circuit’s decision in Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls et al, 395 F.3d 291
(6th Cir. 2005) adopted the reasoning announced by the Fourth, Seventh and Eleventh
circuits. Radvansky involved a landlord/tenant dispute resulting in the arrest of the
tenant. Radvansky, 395 F.3d at 297-300. The Court found that the officers relied
exclusively on the statements of the landlord to support probable cause, despite the
plaintiff’s “express rejection” of the essence of the landlord’s claims. Id. at 304.
A police officer has probable cause only when he discovery reasonably
reliable information that the suspect has committed a crime. Furthermore,
in obtaining such reliable information, an officer cannot look only at the
evidence of guilt while ignoring all exculpatory evidence. Rather, the
officer must consider the totality of the circumstances, recognizing both
the inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, before determining if he has
probable cause to make an arrest. [. . . ] Police officers may not make
hasty, unsubstantiated arrests with impunity, nor simply turn a blind eye
toward potentially exculpatory evidence known to them in an effort to pin
a crime on someone.
Id.
The Seventh Circuit recently applied these principles in Sornberger et al v. City of
Knoxville, IL, 434 F.3d 1006, (7th Cir. 2006). Following a bank robbery, the defendants

Page 20 of 25

arrested the plaintiffs for armed robbery. While the plaintiffs were in jail awaiting trial,
the true culprit committed several similar robberies and, after comparing his image to
surveillance footage from the underlying robbery, the charges against the plaintiffs
were dropped. Sornberger, 434 F.3d at 1011-1012. The Seventh Circuit reversed the
district court’s grant of summary judgment, finding that, from various inconsistencies
in the available evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that no probable cause
existed at the time the warrant was issued. The Court explained that,
Reasonable avenues of investigation must be pursued especially when, as
here, it is unclear who committed the crime. In the present case, the
officers had obtained a warrant for the search of the *plaintiffs’+ parents’
computer, which would have allowed the investigators to confirm the
*plaintiffs’+ alibi. Rather than waiting to obtain this critical information,
the offices arrested Scot while the search of his parents’ home was taking
place. On this record, given that the lynchpin of a probable cause
determination was on the verge of being obtained, the officer’s arrest of
Scott before reviewing the results of the computer search appears to have
been unreasonably premature.
Id. at 1016; see also, BeVier v. Hucal, 806 F.2d 123 (7th Cir. 1986)(“the amount of
information that prudent police will collect before deciding to make a search or an
arrest, and hence the amount of probable cause they will have, is a function of the
gravity of the crime, and especially the danger of its imminent repetition”).
ii.

Abernathy’s Arrest Warrants Violated The Fourth Amendment

Applying Malley, supra, the Eleventh Circuit has held that materially false
statements and omissions in a warrant application violate the Fourth Amendment.
Holmes v. Kucynda et al, 321, F.3d 1069 (11th Cir. 2003). “*W+hen the Fourth Amendment

Page 21 of 25

demands a factual showing sufficient to comprise `probable cause,’ the obvious
assumption is that there will be a truthful showing.” Holmes, 321 F.3d at 1083, citing
Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 164, 98 S.Ct. 2674 (1978).
With regard to the warrant for Capitol City bank, Abernathy’s application
contains a deliberate falsehood, “Accused was identified by photo lineup.” At the
pleadings stage, it is undisputed that no witness from Capitol City bank identified
Owens. Even if the Court considers Abernathy’s factual assertion that Nada James
identified Owens, that assertion merely creates a disputed issue of material fact as to
whether Abernathy’s warrant application contains a deliberate falsehood.
With regard to both warrants, Abernathy’s application violates the Fourth
Amendment because it omits plainly exculpatory evidence that far outweighed the
single piece of evidence supporting probable cause – Ms. Gorham’s identification.
“*A+ warrant affidavit violates the Fourth Amendment when it contains
omissions made intentionally or with a reckless disregard for the accuracy
of the affidavit. A party need not show by direct evidence that the affiant
makes an omission recklessly. Rather, it is possible that when the facts
omitted from the affidavit are clearly critical to a finding of probable cause
the fact of recklessness can be inferred from proof of the omission itself.
Madiwale v. Savaiko, 117 F.3d 1321, 1326-27 (11th Cir. 1997)(internal citations omitted).
Owens has adequately alleged that Abernathy omitted facts critical to a probable cause
determination from his application including: (a) no identification from all other
witnesses; (b) no corroboration of the informant; (c) no truck matching the description
of the “get away” vehicle; (d) no criminal history; and (e) no independent,

Page 22 of 25

corroborating evidence tying Owens to either robbery in Bibb County. At the pleadings
stage, the Court should infer recklessness from Abernathy’s undisputed omission of
these facts from his warrant application.
Where the “inclusion of omitted facts would have prevented a finding of
probable cause,” the warrant violates the Fourth Amendment. Madiwale, 117 F.3d at
1327. Further, where “the facts omitted . . . were . . . so clearly material that every
reasonable law officer would have known that their omission would lead to a search in
violation of federal law,” the Eleventh Circuit has denied qualified immunity. Id. At
the pleadings stage, Owens has adequately pled facts that, if proven at trial, will
establish that Abernathy violated the constitution in both ways.
B.

PRE-EXISTING LAW GAVE ABERNATHY FAIR WARNING THAT HIS
CONDUCT VIOLATED THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.

Since the Supreme Court’s decision in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S.Ct.
2508 (2002), the Court has adopted a more flexible approach to its consideration of the
second prong of the qualified immunity test. Holloman ex rel Holloman v. Harland, 370
F.3d 1252, 1277 (11th Cir. 2004), citing Hope, at 739. While officials must have fair
warning that their acts are unconstitutional, there need not be a case on all fours, with
materially identical facts, before we will allow suits against them. A principle of
constitutional law can be clearly established even if there are notable factual distinctions
between the precedents relied on and the cases then before the Court, so long as the
prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct at issue violated

Page 23 of 25

constitutional rights. Id. at 1277.) (emphasis added). Hope thus stands for the simple
proposition that, “officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established
law even in novel factual circumstances.” Hope, p. 741; Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340,
1349-1355 (11th Cir. 2002).
Pre-existing law established with obvious clarity that Abernathy’s actions
violated the Fourth Amendment. See e.g, Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 106 S. Ct. 1092
(1986); Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 112 S.Ct. 534 (1991); Garmon v. Lumpkin County,
Ga., 878 F.2d 1406 (11th Cir. 1989); Ortega v. Christian, 85 F.3d 1521 (11th Cir. 1996);
Madiwale v. Savaiko, 117 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 1997); Jones v. Cannon, 174 F.3d 1271 (1999);
Holmes v. Kucynda et al, 321, F.3d 1069 (11th Cir. 2003); Kingsland v. City of Miami, 382 F.3d
1220 (11th Cir. 2004). Abernathy is not entitled to qualified immunity.
