DEFENDANT JOHN ABERNATHY’S BRIEF
IN SUPPORT OF HIS MOTION TO DISMISS
COMES NOW Defendant John Abernathy, a named Defendant in the abovestyled action (“this Defendant,” “Abernathy,” or “Defendant Abernathy”), by and
through his attorneys of record, and submits this Brief in Support of his Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint, respectfully showing the Court as follows:
I.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Defendant Abernathy is protected by qualified immunity as to all claims

brought by Plaintiff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because, at all times relevant to these
events, he was performing objectively reasonable discretionary acts within the
scope of his employment with the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office (“BCSO”) and did not
violate any clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person
would have known. Defendant Abernathy had actual probable cause for the arrest
of Plaintiff for the two (2) bank robberies in Bibb County, and is therefore shielded
from this suit under principles of qualified immunity. Even if Defendant Abernathy
did not have actual probable cause for Plaintiff’s arrest, he clearly had arguable
probable cause based upon a robbery victim’s identification of Plaintiff as the

individual who robbed her. See Footnote 6, infra. As such, Plaintiff’s claims against
Defendant Abernathy should be dismissed.
II.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITIES
A.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and Qualified Immunity.

A complaint is subject to dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) “when its
allegations--on their face--show that an affirmative defense bars recovery on the
claim.” Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir. 2001) (en banc).
“Once the affirmative defense of qualified immunity is advanced…’[u]nless the
plaintiff’s allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a
defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the
commencement of discovery 1.’” Id. (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105
S.Ct. 2806, 2815, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); See also Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S.
299, 116 S.Ct. 834, 840, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). The Eleventh Circuit applies the
qualified immunity defense to dismiss a complaint at the 12(b)(6) stage of litigation 2
1

The Supreme Court urges the application of the affirmative defense of qualified

immunity at the earliest possible stage of litigation since the defense is an immunity
from the suit itself and not just from damages. See Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224,
112 S.Ct. 534, 536, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) (emphasizing the importance of
resolving questions of immunity as early as possible in litigation); Mitchell v.
Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806 at 2815, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (stating that
entitlement to qualified immunity is “effectively lost if a case is erroneously
permitted to go to trial.”)
2

The Eleventh Circuit has applied the qualified immunity defense at the 12(b)(6)

stage on numerous occasions. See, e.g., Chesser v. Sparks, 248 F.3d 1117, 1121
2

“where, (1) from the face of the complaint, (2) we must conclude that (even if a
claim is otherwise sufficiently stated), (3) the law supporting the existence of that
claim—given the alleged circumstances—was not already clearly established, (4) to
prohibit what the government-official defendant is alleged to have done, (5) before
the defendant acted.” Marsh v. Butler Co., Ala., 268 F.3d 1014 at 1023 (11th Cir.
2001).
The defense of qualified immunity completely protects government officials
performing discretionary functions from suit in their individual capacities unless their
conduct violates “‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known.’” Gonzalez v. Reno, 325 F.3d 1228 at 1233
(11th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515, 153
L.Ed.2d 666 (2006); Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir. 2002)). For
qualified immunity to fail, the law must have been developed so concretely and so
definitely that it would be obvious to all reasonable government actors, in the place
(11th Cir. 2001); Denno v. School Board of Volusia County, 218 F.3d 1267, 1275
(11th Cir. 2000); Kyle v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 943 (11th Cir. 2000); Maggio v.
Sipple, 211 F.3d 1346, 1355 (11th Cir. 2000); Terrero v. U.S., 275 Fed. App’x 843,
846 (11th Cir. 2008); Nichols v. Maynard, 204 Fed. App’x 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2006);
Dacosta v. Nwachukwa, 304 F.3d 1045, 1049 (11th Cir. 2002)(reversing district
court’s failure to grant 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss because defendants were entitled
to qualified immunity); see also Migut v. Flynn, 131 Fed. App’x 262, 266-67 (11th
Cir. 2005); Haire v. Thomas, 219 Fed. App’x 844, 847 (11th Cir. 2006)(affirming
district court’s granting of 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss where defendants were
entitled to qualified immunity).

of defendant, that “what he is doing” violates federal law. Anderson v. Creighton,
483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). “The relevant,
dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it
would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation
he confronted.” Vinyard, 311 F.3d at 1350 (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Qualified immunity is not merely a defense against liability but rather
immunity from suit. Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565
(2009) (citing Mitchell, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985).
At the heart of qualified immunity analysis is the objective reasonableness of the
public official, without regard for his underlying intent or motivation. Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 at 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727 (1982); Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d
1188, 1195 (11th Cir. 2002).

If reasonable public officials could differ on the

lawfulness of the defendant’s actions, the defendant is entitled to immunity. Storck
v. City of Coral Springs, 354 F.3d 1307, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003).
B.

Defendant Abernathy Was Acting In His Discretionary Authority
When Plaintiff Was Arrested.

For a government official to invoke qualified immunity, he must first prove
that he was acting within his discretionary authority when the events giving rise to
the plaintiff’s claims occurred. Gonzalez, 325 F.3d 1228, 1234 (citing Vinyard, 311
F.3d at 1346). When a court assesses whether a particular act is discretionary, it
must determine “whether the government employee was (a) performing a legitimate
job-related function…(b) through means that were within his power to utilize.”
Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252 at 1265 (11th Cir. 2004).
The acts of obtaining and executing a warrant for arrest qualify as
discretionary functions of law enforcement officers. See Taylor v. DeMarco, 2009
4

WL 2611373 at *2 (M.D.Ga. 2009) (observing that “[p]laintiff cannot seriously
dispute that [d]efendant was within the scope of his discretionary authority when he
sought the arrest warrant for plaintiff…”); see also Hadley v. Gutierrez, 526 F.3d
1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2008) (finding that defendants were engaged in a
discretionary function when plaintiff was arrested); Eloy v. Guillot, 289 Fed. App’x
339, 343 (11th Cir. 2008) (same). In this case, Defendant Abernathy was clearly
acting within his discretionary authority when he arrested Plaintiff 3. As such, the
burden now shifts to the Plaintiff to overcome the defense of qualified immunity.
Vinyard, 311 F.3d at 1346.
C.

Plaintiff Cannot Overcome the Defense of Qualified Immunity.

To overcome the defense of qualified immunity, the plaintiff must prove that
(1) Defendant Abernathy violated a constitutional right and (2) that this right was
clearly established at the time of the violation. 4 Case v. Eslinger, 555 F.3d 1317,
3

Plaintiff’s own Complaint alleges that “[a]t all times relevant to this action,

Abernathy was acting under color of state law and within the scope of his
discretionary functions as duly sworn, certified law enforcement officer employed by
the [Bibb County Sheriff’s Office],” Plaintiff’s Complaint ¶ 11, and reiterates that “[a]t
all times relevant to this action, the individual defendants were acting under color of
state law and within the scope of their discretionary functions as employees of their
respective agencies.” Plaintiff’s Complaint ¶ 158.
4

While in the past, this two-pronged analysis was required to be conducted in

sequential order, a court now has discretion to determine in what order it will
analyze the two parts of the plaintiff’s burden of proof. See Pearson, 129 S.Ct. 808
at 818 (indicating that courts “should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion
5

1325-26 (11th Cir. 2009). Plaintiff has not and cannot meet this burden 5 and his
Complaint should be dismissed as against this Defendant.
1.

Defendant Abernathy’s Investigation Was Sufficient and He Is
Entitled to Qualified Immunity.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Abernathy failed to conduct a proper
investigation of the bank robberies in Bibb County, ultimately resulting in an arrest
of Plaintiff without probable cause. An arresting officer is required to conduct a
in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be
addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.”)
5

A court must not allow plaintiffs in constitutional tort cases to discharge their

burden of showing that the federal right allegedly violated was clearly established
by referring to the violation of abstract “rights.” See Anderson v. Creighton, 483
U.S. 635, 639-41, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038-39 (explaining that although the “general
right [defendant] was alleged to have violated—the right to be free from
warrantless searches of one’s home unless the searching officers have probable
cause and there are exigent circumstances—was clearly established,” the court
must “consider the argument that it was not clearly established that the
circumstances with which [defendant] was confronted did not constitute
probable cause and exigent circumstances.”) (emphasis added); see also Barts v.
Joyner, 865 F.2d 1187, at 1190 (11th Cir. 1989)(stating that plaintiffs cannot meet
their burden “by making general, conclusory allegations of some constitutional
violation or by stating broad legal truisms” but must “prove the existence of a clear,
factually-defined, well-recognized right of which a reasonable police officer should
have known.”)
6

reasonable investigation to establish probable cause. Rankin v. Evans, 133 F.3d
1425, 1435 (11th Cir. 1998). However, the Eleventh Circuit recognizes that “once
an officer makes an arrest based on probable cause, he need not investigate every
claim of innocence.” Williams v. City of Homestead, 206 Fed. App’x 886 at 888
(11th Cir. 2006) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant Abernathy ignored plainly exculpatory information, including Plaintiff’s
motor vehicle history indicating that he did not own a Chevrolet Silverado truck,
Plaintiff’s driving and criminal histories which raised no suggestion that Plaintiff
would commit a violent crime, and Plaintiff’s reputation as a well-respected
businessman in his community. Plaintiff’s Complaint, ¶ 97. However, that
information cannot truly be categorized as “exculpatory information” when one
considers the fact that Plaintiff could have perpetrated the robberies while driving a
truck owned by another individual; and Plaintiff’s criminal history and reputation in
the community are no more “exculpatory” than those of many individuals whose
arrests are met with expressions of disbelief from their families and friends.
Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Abernathy’s investigation was
constitutionally deficient because Abernathy did not interview Plaintiff before
seeking warrants for Plaintiff’s arrest. Plaintiff’s Complaint, ¶ 98. However,
Defendant Abernathy based his probable cause determination on the eyewitness
identification of Plaintiff by at least one bank employee, See FN 6, infra, and upon
his own observation of the assailant’s appearance on surveillance images
compared to the state records photograph of Plaintiff. It was reasonable for
Abernathy to do so. See Taylor v. DeMarco, 2009 WL 2611373 at *5 (finding it
reasonable for the arresting officer to base a probable cause determination on
7

information received from the victim of a theft by deception and two relatives of the
victim, along with bank records, in the absence of a pre-arrest interview with the
arrestee); see also Kelly v. Curtis, 21 F.3d 1544, 1551 (11th Cir. 1994) (indicating
that officer has no affirmative duty to seek out exculpatory information of which he
is not aware).
The quality of an officer’s investigation does not deprive him of qualified
immunity. McCormick v. Peterson, 2008 WL 5102896 at *5, n. 5 (M.D.Ga.)
Defendant Abernathy was not responsible for conducting a trial, but simply for
deciding whether there was probable cause to seek warrants for the arrest of
Plaintiff. Many of the items or investigatory steps that Plaintiff alleges should have
been considered or taken by Defendant Abernathy prior to his obtaining arrest
warrants (such as subpoenaing Plaintiff’s bank records and interviewing witnesses
who could substantiate Plaintiff’s whereabouts at the time the robberies occurred),
Plaintiff’s Complaint, ¶ 98, were activities more appropriate for Plaintiff’s defense
attorney than for the arresting officer. Defendant Abernathy’s investigation was
sufficient to establish probable cause; Plaintiff’s allegation that it was
constitutionally deficient is nothing more than an unsupported conclusory
statement.
2.

Defendant Abernathy Had Actual Probable Cause For Plaintiff’s
Arrest, So Plaintiff’s False Arrest Claim is Barred.

An arrest without probable cause, the constitutional tort that Plaintiff alleges
was committed by Defendant Abernathy, violates a plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment
right to be free from an unreasonable search and provides a basis for a section
1983 claim. Storck v. City of Coral Springs, 354 F.3d 1307, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003).
However, the existence of probable cause at the time of arrest constitutes an
8

absolute bar to a section 1983 claim for false arrest. Marx v. Gumbinner, 905 F.2d
1503, 1505-06 (11th Cir. 1990) (emphasis added).
Actual probable cause to arrest “‘exists when law enforcement officials have
facts and circumstances within their knowledge sufficient to warrant a reasonable
belief that the suspect had committed or was committing a crime.’” Case v.
Eslinger, 555 F.3d 1317, 1327 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting U.S. v. Gonzalez, 969 F.2d
999, 1002 (11th Cir. 1992)). Probable cause does not mandate overwhelmingly
persuasive evidence, but only “reasonably trustworthy information” and must be
judged with a “common sense view to the realities of normal life.” Marx v.
Gumbinner, 905 F.2d 1503 at 1506 (internal citations omitted). The evidence of
criminal activity does not have to be overwhelming, and the fact that “a defendant is
subsequently acquitted or charges are dropped against the defendant is of no
consequence.” Id. at 1507.
The assertion that Defendant Abernathy had actual probable cause to arrest
Plaintiff for the two Bibb County robberies finds support in both Georgia State and
Federal case law. In Fiscus v. City of Roswell, 832 F.Supp. 1558 (N.D.Ga. 1993),
the district court found that an arresting officer was shielded from suit by qualified
immunity because the warrantless arrest of a Pinkerton Security Company
employee was based on probable cause. 832 F.Supp. 1558, 1561 (N.D.Ga. 1993).
In that case, an employee of the security company told the arresting officer that the
physical description provided by two bank employees “fit” the physical appearance
of the plaintiff, and the two employees later identified the plaintiff as the individual
who had let himself into the bank building with his own key shortly after a theft had
occurred. Id. at 1560. The district court agreed with the issuance of an arrest
9

warrant for that plaintiff, noting, “[t]here appears to be no serious contention that
defendant [officer] did not, in fact, have probable cause…justifying the warrantless
arrest of [plaintiff]. There is no dispute as to the eye witness identification of plaintiff,
or the circumstances thereof.” Id.
To the contrary, in Ortega v. Christian, 85 F.3d 1521 (11th Cir. 1996), the
plaintiff was arrested for robbery after a confidential informant told the police
department that a member of a gang of which the informant was also a member
had committed the crime in question. 85 F.3d 1521 at 1523. The plaintiff asked to
appear in a lineup or photographic lineup, but the police department held him in
custody for five (5) months without bond. Id. at 1524. The plaintiff in Ortega was
never identified as the individual who committed the robbery, and the Eleventh
Circuit eventually held that the arresting officer lacked probable cause to arrest the
plaintiff. Id. at 1525.
Like the arrest in Fiscus, Plaintiff Owens’ arrest was clearly supported by
probable cause. It was evident from Plaintiff’s state record photograph that his
physical appearance closely matched the physical description of the perpetrator
provided by witnesses to the two Bibb County robberies. Moreover, Plaintiff was
positively identified as the perpetrator by at least one of the Bibb County robbery
victims when she saw a photographic lineup that included Plaintiff’s photograph,
giving Defendant Abernathy more than ample support for a reasonable belief that
Plaintiff had committed the Bibb County robberies. 6
6

Plaintiff incorrectly alleges in his Complaint that only one (1) witness to the Bibb

County robberies identified Plaintiff as the perpetrator. Plaintiff was, in fact,
positively identified by both Amy Gorham and Nadia Jones, employees at Colonial
10

Conversely, Defendant Abernathy’s actions in seeking an arrest warrant for
Plaintiff are clearly distinguishable from the officer’s lack of probable cause in
Ortega. While the initial identification of Plaintiff as a potential suspect for the series
of robberies was made by Defendant Noble on the basis of information from an
informant, Defendant Abernathy conducted his own investigation, and observed the
striking similarity between Plaintiff’s appearance in his driver services photograph
and the description of the assailant provided by witnesses as well as the
appearance of the perpetrator in surveillance images of the criminal. Abernathy also
arranged a photographic lineup, which resulted in the positive identification of the
Plaintiff as the individual responsible for at least one of the Bibb County robberies

Bank and Capital City Bank respectively. However, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
dismiss requires the court to review the complaint as if all of the allegations
contained therein are true, so the court must assume that Plaintiff was only
identified as the perpetrator of the Colonial Bank robbery by victim Amy Gorham
and was not positively identified by any other witnesses to the crimes. Even so, the
Eleventh Circuit has found that an officer is entitled to qualified immunity where he
has probable cause for at least one (1) of the crimes that a suspect could be
charged with prior to making the arrest. See Skop v. City of Atlanta, 485 F.3d 1130,
1137-1138 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding that if the arresting officer “possessed probable
cause or arguable probable cause to arrest [plaintiff] for either [offense], he is
entitled to qualified immunity…”); See also Williams v. City of Homestead, 206 Fed.
App’x 886 at 887 n.1 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating that in qualified immunity
determinations, “[i]f there is probable cause for one charge, the arrest was proper.”)
11

(See Footnote 6, supra). Abernathy had actual probable cause7 to obtain an arrest
warrant for Plaintiff and is entitled to qualified immunity’s shield against Plaintiff’s
claims against him. 8
7

Whether a particular factual scenario gives rise to probable cause for an arrest

depends on the elements of the crime. Crosby v. Monroe County, 394 F.3d 1328,
1333 (11th Cir. 2004). Here, Plaintiff was arrested for robbery by intimidation, a
lesser-included offense in the offense of armed robbery under O.C.G.A. § 16-841(a). That section states that “[a] person commits the offense of armed robbery
when, with intent to commit theft, he or she takes property of another from the
person or the immediate presence of another by use of an offensive weapon, or any
replica, article, or device having the appearance of such weapon.” O.C.G.A. § 16-841(a). From the facts within his knowledge at the time he sought arrest warrants for
Plaintiff, as set forth herein and in Plaintiff’s own Complaint, Defendant Abernathy
had sufficient knowledge to form a reasonable belief that Plaintiff had committed the
offense of robbery by intimidation as defined under Georgia law. Plaintiff’s arrest for
that offense was based upon actual probable cause.
8

While not binding precedent in this Court, many cases from the Georgia courts

provide persuasive support for a finding herein that Defendant Abernathy had
actual probable cause to arrest Plaintiff for the Bibb County robberies. See e.g.
Franklin v. Consolidated Government of Columbus, 236 Ga.App. 468, 512 S.E.2d
352 (1999) (finding that arresting officer was protected by qualified immunity from
section 1983 claims where the plaintiff’s physical appearance matched the
description of a robbery suspect—who had worn a mask at the time of the
robbery—and the victim and an eyewitness identified the plaintiff in a photographic
12

3.

At a Minimum, Defendant Abernathy Had Arguable Probable
Cause for Plaintiff’s Arrest, and He is Entitled to Qualified
Immunity.

Even if the Court finds that actual probable cause was lacking for Plaintiff’s
arrest for the Bibb County robberies, qualified immunity protects an arresting officer
as long as there was arguable probable cause for the arrest. “[A]ll that is required
for qualified immunity to be applicable to an arresting officer is ‘arguable probable
cause to believe that a person is committing a particular public offense[.]’”
Scarborough v. Myles, 245 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Redd v. City
of Enterprise, 140 F.3d 1378, 1384 (11th Cir. 1998); see also Williams v. City of
Homestead, 206 Fed. App’x 886, 887-888(11th Cir. 2006) (noting that an officer is
entitled to qualified immunity where the officer has arguable probable cause for
arrest); Jones v. Cannon, 174 F.3d 1271, 1283 (11th Cir. 1999) (finding officer
protected by qualified immunity where there was arguable probable cause for the
lineup based on the shape of his face and profile); Means v. City of Atlanta, 262
Ga.App. 700, 586 S.E.2d 373 (2003) (affirming grant of summary judgment to a
defendant on section 1983 claim alleging arrest without probable cause where
arresting officer relied on investigation and report by corporate executive in charge
of loss prevention and did not visit scene of crime, dust for fingerprints, or conduct
interviews of witnesses or potential suspects); Waters v. State, 281 Ga. 119, 636
S.E.2d 538 (2006) (affirming the trial court’s denial of a motion to suppress the
admission of the criminal defendant’s arrest warrant into evidence where the police
officer’s affidavit for arrest documented that a witness identified the defendant as
being present at the scene of the crime and another witness positively identified the
defendant in a photographic lineup).
13

arrest); Gold v. City of Miami, 121 F.3d 1442, 1445 (11th Cir. 1997) (pointing out
distinction between actual probable cause and arguable probable cause); Von Stein
v. Brescher, 904 F.2d 572, 579 (11th Cir. 1990) (noting that the issue in qualified
immunity determinations is arguable probable cause, not probable cause in fact).
Arguable probable cause exists “where ‘reasonable officers in the same
circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as [the arresting officer] could
have believed that probable cause existed to arrest [the plaintiff].’” Redd v. City of
Enterprise, 140 F.3d 1378, 1382 (11th Cir. 1998) (citing Von Stein v. Brescher, 904
F.2d 572, 579).
Accordingly, Defendant Abernathy need only show that he had arguable
probable cause--a lesser standard than actual probable cause--to be entitled to
qualified immunity. Jones v. Cannon, 174 F.3d 1271, 1283 n. 3 (11th Cir. 1999).
This burden is clearly satisfied in this case, where the Plaintiff was positively
identified by a victim of at least one of the Bibb County robberies, See Footnote 6,
supra, and Plaintiff’s photo from state records bears a strong resemblance to the
perpetrator shown on still images captured by surveillance cameras at the Capital
City Bank. A reasonable officer in Abernathy’s position could have believed that he
had probable cause to arrest Plaintiff for the Bibb County robberies. Plaintiff must
demonstrate that no reasonable officer could have found probable cause to arrest
him under the totality of the circumstances. Storck v. City of Coral Springs, 354
F.3d 1307, 1313 (11th Cir. 2003). This he simply cannot do.
The facts known to Defendant Abernathy at the time of Plaintiff’s arrest were
sufficient to warrant the belief that Plaintiff had committed one or both of the Bibb
County bank robberies. The Plaintiff’s arrest arose from the original misidentification
14

of Plaintiff as the perpetrator of the robberies by bank employees. “The Constitution
does not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested. If it did, [section] 1983
would provide a cause of action for every defendant acquitted—indeed, for every
suspect released.” Baker v. McCollah, 443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2695, 61
L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). The unfortunate nature of what happened to Plaintiff “should
not obscure that plaintiff was accorded all of the protections …to which he was
entitled” under our Constitution, Fiscus v. City of Roswell, 832 F.Supp. 1558 at
1564 (N.D.Ga. 1993), including a reasonable arrest based on probable cause
determinations both by Defendant Abernathy and by the Magistrate Court of Bibb
County, and the timely provision of a bond that would have permitted him to bond
out of jail in Bibb County had the Plaintiff chosen to post the bond. There simply
was no constitutional violation in connection with Plaintiff’s arrest because the
arrest was based on probable cause. As such, Plaintiff’s claim for false arrest
against Defendant Abernathy must fail. 9
D.

Defendant Abernathy Had Actual Probable Cause For Plaintiff’s
Arrest, So Plaintiff’s Malicious Prosecution Claim is Barred.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Abernathy is liable for malicious prosecution
because the warrants he obtained for Plaintiff’s arrest “substantially relied on”
information from Defendant Noble’s “constitutionally deficient investigation” into the
robbery in McDonough. Plaintiff’s Complaint at ¶ 172. Plaintiff further alleges that
Defendant Abernathy knowingly and willfully instituted and maintained a criminal

9

The existence of probable cause at the time of an arrest constitutes an absolute

bar to a section 1983 claim for false arrest. Marx v. Gumbinner, 905 F.2d 1503,
1505-06 (11th Cir. 1990).
15

prosecution against Plaintiff 10 with malice and without probable cause, a neat
(albeit unsupported) recitation of the elements of a malicious prosecution claim. Id.
at ¶ 177.
The Eleventh Circuit has categorized malicious prosecution as a violation of
the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures and a viable
constitutional tort under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Uboh v. Reno, 141 F.3d 1000, 1002-03
(11th Cir. 1998); Whiting v. Traylor, 85 F.3d 581, 584 (11th Cir. 1996); Kelly v.
Curtis, 21 F.3d 1544, 1554-55 (11th Cir. 1994). In order to establish a malicious
prosecution claim under section 1983, a plaintiff must prove that his constitutional
right to be free from unreasonable seizure was violated, in addition to proving the
elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution. Wood v. Kesler, 323
F.3d 872, 881 (citing Uboh, 141 F.3d at 1002-04; Whiting, 85 F.3d at 584-86; Kelly,
21 F.3d at 1553-55).
With regard to the common law tort of malicious prosecution, Georgia law
provides that “[a] criminal prosecution which is carried on maliciously and without
any probable cause and which causes damage to the person prosecuted shall give
him a cause of action.” O.C.G.A. § 51-7-40 (emphasis added); see also
Commercial Plastics Supply Corp. v. Molen, 355 S.E.2d 86, 87 (Ga.Ct.App. 1987)
(outlining the following constituent elements of a Georgia claim for malicious
prosecution: (1) prosecution for a criminal offense; (2) under a valid warrant or

The Complaint as originally pled refers to a prosecution against “Tuggle.”

accusation or summons; (3) termination of the prosecution in favor of the plaintiff;
(4) malice in the institution and maintenance of the proceedings; (5) lack of
probable cause; and (6) damage to the plaintiff) (emphasis added). In addition, to
state a cause of action for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must plead and prove
that the criminal proceeding that gave rise to the action was terminated in favor of
the accused. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2371, 129
L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).
Although the Plaintiff in this case has properly alleged that a seizure (arrest
in fact) occurred during the course of his prosecution and that the prosecution
terminated in his favor, Plaintiff has not and cannot show that Defendant Abernathy
acted without probable cause, which is a required element of a section 1983
malicious prosecution claim. Wood v. Kesler, 323 F.3d 872, 882 (11th Cir. 2003).
This Brief explains fully the facts and circumstances which gave rise to Defendant
Abernathy’s having actual probable cause for the arrest of Plaintiff, as well as the
clear legal support for this conclusion. The same analysis 11 applies to Plaintiff’s
claim for malicious prosecution, and the same result is appropriate. At a minimum,
Defendant Abernathy had arguable probable cause to arrest Plaintiff for the Bibb
11

Defendant Abernathy was clearly acting within his discretionary authority when

he obtained and executed the warrants for Plaintiff’s arrest. Thus, the remaining
issue is whether his actions amounted to a violation of clearly established
constitutional law. As established above, Plaintiff’s arrest and prosecution were
supported by probable cause, so he cannot show a violation of any clearly
established constitutional right.

County robberies, and arguable probable cause raises the shield of qualified
immunity for Defendant Abernathy to bar Plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim.
See Wood v. Kesler, 323 F.3d 872, 882 (11th Cir. 2003) (finding that probable
cause bars a section 1983 malicious prosecution claim); Williams v. City of
Homestead, 206 Fed. App’x 886, 889 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that plaintiff’s
malicious prosecution claim failed because plaintiff could not establish an absence
of probable cause); Atterbury v. City of Miami Police Dept., 322 Fed. App’x 724,
729 (11th Cir. 2009) (affirming district court’s determination that officer was entitled
to qualified immunity for section 1983 claim of malicious prosecution because arrest
warrant and detention were supported by actual probable cause).
III.

CONCLUSION
Because Defendant Abernathy had probable cause to arrest the Plaintiff for

the Bibb County robberies, Plaintiff has not suffered any deprivation of the rights
afforded him by the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, Defendant Abernathy is entitled to
qualified immunity from Plaintiff’s claims against him, which should now be
dismissed.
This 14th day of January, 2010.
