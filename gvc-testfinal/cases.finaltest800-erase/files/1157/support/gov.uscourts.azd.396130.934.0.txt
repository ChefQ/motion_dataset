MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND DKT.

SEIZURE OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE
UNDER N.D.CAL. WARRANTS OR, IN

CASE WITH PREJUDICE

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Motion

17 For Leave To Amend Dkt. #867 First Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And
18 Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants Or, In The Alternative, To Dismiss
19 The Case With Prejudice. Through this motion, the defendant respectfully requests that the
20 Court permit him to amend First Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And Seizure
21 Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants (Dkt. #867), so as to become his Second
22 Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under
23 N.D.Cal. Warrants. The proposed second supplement, prepared in accordance with LRCiv.
24 15.1,[1] is attached to this motion as an exhibit.

“A party who moves for leave to amend a pleading, or who seeks to amend a pleading
by
stipulation
and order, must attach a copy of the proposed amended pleading as an exhibit
26
to the motion or stipulation, which must indicate in what respect it differs from the pleading
27 which it amends, by bracketing or striking through the text to be deleted and underlining the
text to be added. The proposed amended pleading is not to incorporate by reference any part
28 of the preceding pleading, including exhibits. If a motion or stipulation for leave to amend is
granted, the party whose pleading was amended must file and serve the amended pleading on

The defendant's first supplement (Dkt. #867) was filed in light of the government

2 providing the defendant new evidence on June 21, 2012. While the defendant had new
3 evidence and good reason to amend and then refile his suppression filings in accordance with
4 LRCiv. 15.1, the procedures were too complicated for the defendant to apply to Dkt. #824

5 and #830. Therefore, the defendant filed a stand-alone supplement acting to supersede
6 sections contained in his prior suppression filings. See Dkt. #867. However, at that time, the
7 defendant anticipated at least a later second supplement considering there was still an
8 outstanding discovery request. See Dkt. #869, #890, #893, #911, and #930 (digital data
9 search discovery filings). On October 22, 2012, the government finally provided the
10 defendant with evidence responsive to the outstanding discovery request. Shortly thereafter,
11 the defendant determined that he would indeed need to again update the facts and arguments
12 relevant to the “digital data search.”[2] However, the government's October 22, 2012
13 disclosure was still significantly lacking (see Dkt. #930, #931, and #932) and the defendant
14 anticipates a third supplement in light of additional, yet to be disclosed government
15 discovery.
16

For the second supplement, which is attached to this motion as an exhibit, the

17 defendant took the first supplement (Dkt. #867) and edited it in accordance with LRCiv.
18 15.1, which the defendant found less complicated than simply supplementing Dkt. #867 with
19 an additional stand-alone filing. While the defendant followed LRCiv. 15.1 with respect to
20 the attached amended filing, instead of using underlined text to indicate new text he used red
21 colored text.[3] Old text is crossed out as instructed by LRCiv. 15.1. If the defendant feels a
22 need to file a third supplement, he plans to edit the attached second supplement in the same
23 fashion and attach it to another motion for leave to amend. However, in light of the
24
all parties under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure within fourteen (14) days of
25 the filing of the order granting leave to amend, unless the Court orders otherwise.” Id.
The need to supplement or, in other words, amend, came about due to the new
26 2.
evidence and also due to new activity in United States v. Collins, Case No. 11-CR-0047127 DLJ (PSG), Doc. #328 (N.D.Cal., Aug. 27, 2012).
The defendant is not able to engage in an editing process using underlined text to
28 3.
designate new text.

1 anticipated third supplement, it may be preferable to deny this motion and allow the
2 defendant to file one final supplement (i.e., a final, overall amended version of Dkt. #867)
3 once the “digital data search” discovery process is complete. As a third alternative, the Court
4 may instead prefer that the defendant simply amend the original memorandum at Dkt. #830-

5 1 to incorporate (1) the therein contained original arguments that remain relevant, (2) the
6 changes made to Dkt. #830-1 at Dkt. #867 that remain relevant, (3) the changes made in the
7 amended version of Dkt. #867 attached to this motion (i.e., the second supplement), and (4)
8 the changes that will likely materialize (i.e., the third supplement) in light of additional, yet
9 to be provided government disclosures addressed at Dkt. #930. The defendant will do
10 whatever the Court desires in order to make his convoluted filings easier to address.
11

If the Court decides to not allow the defendant to amend Dkt. #867 at all, the

12 defendant respectfully requests the alternative relief of dismissal of the case with prejudice
13 due to the government failing to disclose relevant and helpful evidence in time for the
14 defendant to use it in support of Fourth Amendment suppression arguments. See United
15 States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 (9th Cir. 2000) (“The suppression of material
16 evidence helpful to the accused... on a motion to suppress, violates due process if there is a
17 reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding
18 would have been different.”). The relevancy of the new October 22, 2012 evidence will
19 become evident upon review of the red colored text within the attached amended version of
20 Dkt. #867.
21

Additionally, because the government has already submitted a response to Dkt. #867

22 (see Dkt. #873), the defendant assumes that the government has a right to respond to any
23 amended filing the Court allows the defendant to file.
24

If this motion is granted, the defendant plans to delete all strike-through text in the

25 attached amended Dkt. #867, turn the red text into black text, and file the document as
26 Second Supplement To Motion To Suppress RE: Search And Seizure Of Digital Evidence
27 Under N.D.Cal. Warrants. See LRCiv. 15.1. If the Court wishes for the defendant to
28 proceed differently, he respectfully requests that the Court provide him with instructions.
