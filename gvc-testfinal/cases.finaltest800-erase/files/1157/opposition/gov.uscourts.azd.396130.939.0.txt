No. CR-08-0814-001-PHX-DGC

Plaintiff,
v.
Daniel David Rigmaiden,
Defendant.

GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
LEAVE TO AMEND DKT. #867
FIRST SUPPLEMENT TO MOTION
TO SUPPRESS RE: SEARCH AND
SEIZURE OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE
UNDER N.D. CAL WARRANTS OR,
IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO
DISMISS THE CASE WITH
PREJUDICE
(Docket No. 934)

The United States, through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to defendant’s Motion

20 for Leave to Amend DKT. #867 First Supplement to Motion to Suppress Re: Search and Seizure
21 of Digital Evidence Under N.D. Cal. Warrants or, in the Alternative to Dismiss the Case With
22 Prejudice (Docket No. 934) as follows. The United States leaves defendant’s request for leave
23 to amend to the Court’s discretion. The United States objects to any request by the defendant
24 that the case be dismissed for any reason under any circumstances. If the Court requires
25 additional information or briefing on any matter related to such a request, the United States will
26 respond promptly upon request by the Court. If the Court grants defendant’s request for leave
27 to amend, the United States will, obviously, need additional time to respond depending upon the
28 extent of the amendments permitted by the Court.
