BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant, General Electric Company (“GE” or “Company”), submits this Brief in
Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment.
I.

INTRODUCTION

On December 29, 2010, plaintiff, Renee Majors (“Plaintiff” or “Majors”), filed suit under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (“ADA”), alleging that GE
regarded her as disabled, and under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e
et seq. (“Title VII”), alleging sex discrimination and retaliation. Majors claims that GE denied
her a temporary Purchased Material Auditor (“PMA”) position in May 2009 and a permanent
PMA position in October 2009 because of her sex and perceived disability. Majors also alleges
that after she filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) in
2005, GE retaliated against her by denying her the opportunity to work overtime or on Fridays
when the plant was off for lack of work (“LOW”).
GE is entitled to summary judgment on all of Majors’ claims. Majors cannot establish a
prima facie case of sex discrimination in promotion because she was not qualified and able to
perform the PMA job; lifting in excess of 20 pounds is an essential function of the PMA job and
Majors had permanent restrictions precluding her from lifting over 20 pounds.

Moreover,

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 2 of 31 PageID #: 122

Majors cannot prove that GE’s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying her the PMA
jobs—her permanent work restrictions—constitutes pretext for sex discrimination. Indeed, all of
the individuals who investigated whether Majors could perform the PMA job, and determined
she could not, are women.
Majors’ ADA claim over the PMA jobs fares no better than her Title VII claim. First,
Majors specifically disclaims having an actual disability; she alleges only that GE regarded her
as disabled. Accordingly, GE had no duty to provide Majors with a reasonable accommodation.
Second, the undisputed facts, including Majors’ own testimony, establish that lifting in excess of
20 pounds is an essential function of the PMA job and that Majors’ permanent work restrictions
precluded her from lifting over 20 pounds.

Third, although Majors was not entitled to a

reasonable accommodation under the ADA, GE conducted an extensive analysis of the PMA job,
determined that Majors could not perform its essential functions, and found no reasonable
accommodations existed that would allow Majors to do so.

Majors’ only suggested

“accommodations”—having someone else perform the lifting for her or disregarding her
permanent restrictions—are unreasonable as a matter of law.
GE is entitled to summary judgment on Majors’ retaliation claims for multiple procedural
and substantive reasons. Procedurally, they are time-barred as to any conduct occurring prior to
June 3, 2009. In addition, Majors’ Friday work claim is outside the scope of the charges of
discrimination she filed with the EEOC and, therefore, not properly before the Court. On the
merits, Majors’ supervisors responsible for assigning overtime and Friday work had no
knowledge that she filed EEOC charges. Consequently, they could not have retaliated against
her for filing a charge. Even if her supervisors had been aware of her EEOC charges, Majors
could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation because she cannot show that similarly

2

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 3 of 31 PageID #: 123

situated employees who did not file charges were treated better. Finally, Majors cannot show
that GE’s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for not asking her to work overtime or on
Fridays when the plant was off for LOW constitute pretexts for retaliation.
Accordingly, the Court should enter summary judgment in favor of GE on all of Majors’
claims.

A.

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS NOT IN DISPUTE

GE’s Bloomington, Indiana Plant

GE manufactures side-by-side refrigerators at its Bloomington, Indiana plant. Over 3,000
employees worked in the plant in 2000.

(Majors Dep., p. 20)

By 2009, the number of

employees was down to around 750-800, and today only about 600 employees work at the plant.
(Jones Dep., pp. 17-18) On January 17, 2008, GE announced that it planned to close the
Bloomington plant. (Majors Dep. pp. 209-10; Ex. 28) Fortunately, in 2009, GE decided to keep
the plant open. Business, however, continues to be challenging. During 2009, the Bloomington
plant experienced numerous LOW days—days when no production was scheduled and few
employees worked. (Jones Dep., pp. 46-51; Ex. C; Majors Dep. pp. 210-11) On a LOW day,
hourly employees know they will not work unless they are brought in for a particular reason, i.e.,
preventative maintenance or rework. (Id.)
1.

Collective Bargaining Agreement between GE and the IBEW

Hourly employees at GE’s Bloomington plant are members of a bargaining unit
represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2249 (“IBEW” or
“Union”).

(Majors Dep., p. 65; Ex. 8)

Consequently, the terms and conditions of their

3

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 4 of 31 PageID #: 124

employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) between GE and the
IBEW.1 (Majors Dep., pp. 65-67; Ex. 8)
a.

Job awards process

Under the CBA, jobs are awarded to the most senior eligible bidder. (Karr Dep., p. 12)
When job awards are posted, they simultaneously are forwarded to the onsite medical clinic,
which is operated by a third party, Concentra. (Karr Dep., p. 13; Kristoff Dep., pp. 6-7) Clinic
personnel review the job awards and the employees’ medical files to see if there are any
restrictions that may need to be addressed. (Kristoff Dep., pp. 19-20) GE seeks to accommodate
employees, whether or not they are disabled within the meaning of the ADA. (Karr Dep., pp. 27,
40-41; Kristoff Dep., pp. 19-20; Lewellen Dep., pp. 5-8)

Clinic personnel work with GE

personnel to try to accommodate employees in positions. (Karr Dep., pp. 40-41; Kristoff Dep.,
pp. 19-20; Lewellen Dep., pp. 6-8) Lead Occupational Health Nurse Toni Kristoff testified
regarding the procedures she follows in conducting a job placement review:
I go to the [employee’s] chart, pull the medical classification. Look at the job that
I assume that they are to do. I look at the essential functions of the job. If
there’s . . . Talk to the BTL [(Business Team Leader-Supervisor)] and talk to the
placement . . . at the time of Renee’s [Majors’] the placement specialist [(Linda
Schneider)], see if there’s any issues or not a match. If there is, I can go out and
look at the job. If I’m not familiar with it, I talk to the BTL and see if there’s
been any changes. I try to talk to the employee that does the job to see if there’s
anything that isn’t covered that would create a problem. And, I talk to the
Ergonomics Specialist [(Ruth Lewellen)] to see if there’s anyway we can make a
fit for the job.
(Kristoff Dep., pp. 6, 19-20) Thereafter, Kristoff sends “[a]n e-mail usually to the HR person to
let them know if the person is qualified or not medically.” (Kristoff Dep., p. 20)
Majors admitted that GE “takes good care of the employees who have disabilities”; that
GE “made accommodations for everybody in jobs. They’ve even physically made up jobs that
1

GE, the International IBEW, and other unions are party to a national CBA that governs certain terms and
conditions of employment at numerous plants around the United States, including the Bloomington plant.

4

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 5 of 31 PageID #: 125

didn’t even exist for people that have restrictions in that plant.” (Majors Dep., p. 185) Majors
elaborated that “for years and years and years, it’s like anytime anybody had a restriction, like I
said, the Clinic and the Ergonomics made accommodations for those people so—if there was
anyway possible, so they could get those jobs.” (Majors Dep., p. 182)
b.

Overtime

Under the CBA, overtime is equalized “among the employees within a job classification
on the same shift in the cost center.”2

(Majors Dep., pp. 66-67; Ex. 8, p. 18; Ex. 31)

Supervisors, known as Business Team Leaders (or BTLs), determine what overtime is needed,
including the job classifications/employees needed. (Jones Dep., p. 25)
B.

Majors’ Work History With GE

GE hired Majors on April 25, 1972. (Complaint, ¶ 10) In September 2000, Majors
suffered a work-related injury to her right shoulder.

She initially had temporary work

restrictions. (Majors Dep., p. 45; Ex. 4) By the spring of 2001, Majors received permanent work
restrictions of no lifting over 20 pounds and no work with her right arm above eye-level fully
extended. (Majors Dep., Exs. 5-7; Kristoff Dep., p. 22; Exs. I, J)
Majors worked as a Quality Control Inspector (“QCI”) in Assembly from February 2003
until her voluntary retirement in October 2009. (Complaint, ¶ 12; Majors Dep., p. 24) As a QCI
in Final Assembly throughout 2008 and 2009, Majors’ job classification was 9014 and she was
assigned to Cost Center C86. (Majors Dep., p. 29; Ex. 1) Gary Hamilton became Majors’ BTL
in January 2009. Amine Karoud was Majors’ BTL from February to July 2009, at which point
Hamilton again supervised Majors until she retired at the end of October 2009. (Jones Dep.,
pp. 25, 27; Ex. B, p. 4; Majors Dep., pp. 31-32)
2

GE has many cost centers at the Bloomington plant. Cost centers consist of groups of employees with
similar work. (Jones Dep., p. 18) The CBA defines a cost center as a “[d]esignated area and its
employees as determined by financial accounting department.” (Majors Dep. Ex. 8, p. 139)

1.

May 2009 temporary PMA position

On May 1, 2009, GE posted a temporary PMA position because PMA Stephen Howe
(“Howe”) was going on an extended leave of absence. (Karr Dep., p. 11) The PMA inspects,
performs tests on, and/or audits a variety of purchased components to determine conformance to
engineering specifications and acceptability of quality standards. (Majors Dep., Ex. 2) The
PMA job description notes the job requires the “intermittent movement of heavy objects.” Id. In
her deposition, Majors testified that the job description is accurate, and that lifting parts and
materials weighing in excess of 20 pounds is essential. (Majors Dep., pp. 36, 179)
Majors bid on the PMA position and, as the senior eligible bidder, was awarded the
position on May 5, 2009. (Majors Dep., Ex. 14; Karr Dep., pp. 12-13) Simultaneously, the
award was forwarded to the medical clinic to determine if Majors had any work restrictions that
might impact her ability to perform the PMA job.

(Karr Dep., pp. 13-14; Kristoff Dep.,

pp. 19-20) Clinic nurse Kristoff followed each of the steps she outlined above to determine
whether Majors was medically qualified for the PMA position. (Kristoff Dep., p. 20) Kristoff
noted the permanent work restrictions in Majors’ file and reviewed the job description for the
PMA job, which notes the “intermittent movement of heavy objects” as an essential function.
(Kristoff Dep., pp. 19-20) Kristoff then followed up with GE’s Labor Resources Manager, Linda
Schneider (“Schneider”), regarding the job’s lifting requirements. (Kristoff Dep., pp. 19-20,
27-28) Upon finding that lifting in excess of 20 pounds was an essential job function, Kristoff
responded on May 6, 2011 that Majors was not medically recommended for the PMA job.
(Kristoff Dep., p. 28) Majors was informed that she would not be awarded the temporary PMA
position.
After Majors expressed her belief that she could perform the PMA job, GE conducted a
further review and job analysis. (Kristoff Dep., p. 27; Majors Dep. Ex. 25) Kristoff, Schneider,
6

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 7 of 31 PageID #: 127

and Ruth Lewellen (“Lewellen”), an ergonomic technical specialist (an hourly bargaining unit
employee), reviewed the job description. (Lewellen Dep., pp. 6-7; Kristoff Dep., pp. 19-20, 26)
They then visited the work area to investigate the essential functions of the PMA position.
(Lewellen Dep., pp. 6-8; Kristoff Dep., p. 21) Additionally, they spoke with a PMA, Bob East
(“East”), and spoke with the manager of the PMAs, Tom Jenkins (“Jenkins”). (Lewellen Dep.,
p. 9; Kristoff Dep., pp. 19-20, 27-29; East Dep., pp. 17-18) East and Jenkins confirmed that
lifting of parts and material weighing over 20 pounds, i.e., compressors and boxes of screws and
door handles, was an essential part of the PMA’s job. (Lewellen Dep., pp. 6-9; Kristoff Dep.,
pp. 27-28; Majors Dep. Ex. 25) Schneider and Lewellen also weighed objects Majors would be
required to lift, including compressors and boxes of screws, which well-exceeded 20 pounds.
(Lewellen Dep., pp. 8-9; Kristoff Dep., p. 21) Kristoff and Lewellen also spoke to Majors, and
Majors suggested that a stock handler perform the required lifting. (Lewellen Dep., pp. 10-11;
Kristoff Dep., p. 29, 51) The nurse practitioner, Sharon Crane, also reviewed this matter and
agreed with Kristoff that Majors could not perform the essential functions. (Kristoff Dep. pp.
43-44) Upon review of all of the information, GE determined that Majors could not perform the
essential functions due to her permanent work restrictions. (Karr Dep., pp. 13-14; Kristoff Dep.,
pp. 27-29, 38, 41, 43-44, 51-52) As a result, the temporary PMA job was awarded to Barry
Taylor (“Taylor”), the next most senior eligible bidder. (Karr Dep., p. 15)
Majors filed a grievance under the CBA regarding the denial of the PMA jobs. (Majors
Dep., Ex. 16) GE denied the grievance and the Union did not pursue the matter to arbitration.
(Majors Dep., p. 154)
2.

Voluntary special early retirement option

In the 2007-2011 national CBA, GE and the unions negotiated a voluntary Special Early
Retirement Option (“SERO”) Window. (Majors Dep., pp. 180-81) The SERO Window was
7

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 8 of 31 PageID #: 128

available to employees across the United States who had at least 25 years of service and were
age 55 or over. (Jones Dep., pp. 42-43; Myers Dep., pp. 9-10) As Human Resource Manager
Joe Jones testified, the SERO Window “allows people to retire early and draw really good
benefits.” (Jones Dep., p. 43) Employees interested in the SERO Window had to apply by
August 31, 2009, and they had the option to retire on October 1, 2009 or November 1, 2009.
(Majors Dep., pp. 188-90; Ex. 24; Myers Dep., p. 10) On August 24, 2009, Majors submitted
her application for the SERO Window with a November 1, 2009 retirement date. (Majors Dep.,
pp. 188-90; Ex. 24) Majors completed the remaining paperwork for the SERO in late October
2009. By electing to retire through the SERO Window, Majors not only was able to retire early
with health insurance, but she received an additional $1,056.00 per month in pension benefits
until she reached age 63 (for six years). (Myers Dep., pp. 13-14; Ex. E)
3.

October 2009 permanent PMA position

In October 2009, GE posted the PMA job as a permanent position because Howe retired.
(Karr Dep., p. 11) Although she had already submitted her application for the SERO and her
QCI job had been posted for bidding, Majors bid on the PMA job. (Karr Dep., pp. 6-7) She
again was the senior eligible bidder and, as a result, was initially awarded the job. (Karr Dep.,
p. 14) The job award was posted and forwarded to the clinic. (Karr Dep., pp. 13-14) Kristoff
reviewed Majors’ file, saw that the permanent restrictions remained in place, and followed up, in
conjunction with Lewellen, to confirm whether there had been any changes in the PMA job that
would result in any different assessment than five months earlier in May 2009. (Kristoff Dep.,
pp. 19-20; Ex. H) Ken Kolbe (“Kolbe”), the supervisor over the PMAs at the time, confirmed
the job had not changed, and lifting over 20 pounds remained an essential job function. (Kristoff
Dep., pp. 19-20, 27-29; Ex. H; Kolbe Dep., pp. 20, 25-26; Ex. D) Accordingly, Majors was

8

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 9 of 31 PageID #: 129

denied the PMA job and it was awarded to the next most senior eligible bidder, Rodney Ira.
(Karr Dep., pp. 14-15; Kristoff Dep. Ex. H)
Majors filed a grievance over being denied the permanent PMA job. (Majors Dep.,
p. 206; Ex. 27) GE denied the grievance, and the Union did not pursue it to arbitration. (Majors
Dep., pp. 206, 209)
C.

Majors’ EEOC Charges
1.

May 22, 2009 charge

On May 22, 2009, Majors filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. (Complaint,
Ex. A) Majors alleged she was denied the temporary PMA job because of her sex and disability.
Majors did not identify any other alleged discriminatory act, and she listed May 7, 2009 as the
earliest date of alleged discrimination. (Complaint, Ex. A)
2.

March 30, 2010 charge

On March 30, 2010, Majors filed another charge of discrimination with the EEOC.
(Complaint, Ex. C) Majors alleged she was denied the permanent PMA job because of her sex
and disability/perceived disability. Majors also alleged retaliation—Majors claimed: “In 2005, I
filed a charge of discrimination due to my disability. Once I filed the charge I have been
continuously denied overtime.” (Complaint, Ex. C)
III.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories
and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as
to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”
Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,
Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986). Importantly, Rule 56(c) does not require that the moving party negate
its opponent’s claim. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323, 325. Rather, Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of
9

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 10 of 31 PageID #: 130

summary judgment against a party “who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the
existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which the party will bear the burden
of proof at trial.” Celotex, 577 U.S. at 322.
The non-moving party “may not rest on its pleadings, but must affirmatively demonstrate,
by specific factual allegations, that there is a genuine issue of material fact that requires trial.”
Hemsworth v. Quotesmith.com. Inc., 476 F.3d 487, 490 (7th Cir. 2007). A “genuine” issue does
not exist unless sufficient record evidence would permit a reasonable jury – that is a jury that
will base its decision on the facts and the law, rather than on sympathy or antipathy or private
notions of justice – to return a verdict for the non-movant on the evidence presented. Anderson,
477 U.S. at 247-48; Karazanos v. Navistar Int’l Trans. Corp., 948 F.2d 332, 338 (7th Cir. 1991).
A scintilla of evidence in support of a non-movant’s position or evidence that is “merely
colorable” does not preclude summary judgment; rather, there must be “significantly probative”
evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249, 252. Moreover, the non-moving party must show that the
disputed facts are “material.” Id. at 248. “Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome
of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.
Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.” Id. In other words, a
court may grant summary judgment “not only when the material facts are undisputed, but also
when the non-movant’s evidentiary offering is simply too thin to warrant the case going to trial.”
Quaker Alloy Casting Co. v. Gulfco Indus., Inc., 123 F.R.D. 282, 285 (N.D. Ill. 1988).

ARGUMENT

GE Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Majors’ Sex Discrimination
Claim.

Majors, a female, claims that a female Labor Resources Manager (Schneider), a female
Human Resources Administrator (Karr), and a female Ergonomic Technical Specialist

10

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 11 of 31 PageID #: 131

(Lewellen), upon recommendation from a female nurse (Kristoff), denied her the temporary and
permanent PMA positions because she is a female. (Majors Dep. p. 297) “[A] little common
sense is not amiss in a discrimination case.” Wallace II v. SMC Pneumatics, Inc., 103 F.3d 1394,
1400 (7th Cir. 1997). Majors’ contentions are baseless, and GE is entitled to summary judgment.
Under Title VII, a plaintiff may prove disparate treatment based on her sex under either
the direct or indirect method of proof. Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F.3d 498, 504
(7th Cir. 2004). Where, as here, the plaintiff has no evidence supporting the direct method, she
may proceed under the indirect, burden-shifting method articulated by the Supreme Court in
McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).
1.

Majors cannot establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination

To establish a prima facie case in a failure to promote context, Majors must show that:
(1) she belongs to a protected class; (2) she applied for and was qualified for the PMA job;
(3) she was rejected for the job; and (4) the job was awarded to someone outside the protected
group who was not better qualified than plaintiff. Grayson v. City of Chicago, 317 F.3d 745, 748
(7th Cir. 2003), citing Johnson v. Nordstrom, Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 732 (7th Cir. 2001), cert.
denied 535 U.S. 928 (2002).
a.

Majors was not qualified for the PMA jobs because
she could not perform the essential function of
lifting objects weighing over 20 pounds.

The PMA job description expressly provides that the job requires the “intermittent
movement of heavy objects.” (Majors Dep., Ex. 2) Majors admits that lifting objects weighing
over 20 pounds is an essential function of the PMA job. (Majors Dep., pp. 36, 179) Similarly,
the supervisor of the PMAs confirmed that lifting objects weighing over 20 pounds is an
essential function of the job. (Kolbe Dep., pp. 11-12, 20, 26) What is more, when GE analyzed
the PMA job to determine whether Majors could perform it, Schneider and Lewellen personally
11

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 12 of 31 PageID #: 132

weighed several items that PMAs must lift, i.e., compressors, boxes of screws, and determined
they weighed over 20 pounds. (Lewellen Dep., pp. 8-9) And, Majors had permanent medical
restrictions that precluded her from lifting objects weighing over 20 pounds. (Majors Dep.,
Exs. 5-7; Kristoff Dep., pp. 27-28; Exs. I, J) Accordingly, Majors was not qualified for the PMA
job and cannot establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination.
b.

Through the CBA’s sex-neutral job awards policy,
the PMA jobs were awarded to bidders who were
better qualified than Majors.

The bidders who received the PMA jobs, Taylor and Ira, did not have restrictions that
precluded them from performing the essential functions of the PMA job. Hence, both Taylor and
Ira were qualified to perform the essential functions of the PMA jobs, while Majors was not.
Moreover, pursuant to the job awards process contained in the CBA, Taylor and Ira were the
next senior eligible bidders, after GE determined that Majors’ permanent restrictions precluded
her from performing the PMA jobs. See generally Hamillton v. Komatsu Dresser Industries,
Inc., 964 F.2d 600 (7th Cir. 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S. 9616 (1992) (holding that plaintiffs
were not promoted and laid off because of their age; rather, those adverse actions resulted from a
neutral seniority system contained in a collective bargaining agreement). GE awarded the PMA
jobs to Taylor and Ira because they were the most senior eligible bidders who were qualified to
perform the jobs, not because they were men.
2.

Majors cannot prove pretext.

Even if Majors could establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination (and she cannot),
she cannot demonstrate that GE’s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying her the
PMA jobs was pretext for sex discrimination. To show pretext, Majors must demonstrate that
GE’s explanation for denying her the PMA jobs—her permanent work restrictions—was a lie.
Gates v. Caterpillar, Inc. 513 F.3d 680, 690 (7th Cir. 2008). Majors offers no evidence—and
12

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 13 of 31 PageID #: 133

none exists—that GE denied her the PMA jobs for any reason other than her permanent work
restrictions.
Majors admits that she was told she was denied the PMA jobs because of her permanent
medical restrictions. (Majors Dep., pp. 113-14, 206; Exs. 12, 14; Karr Dep., pp. 13-14; Kristoff
Dep., pp. 26-28) In addition, Majors’ medical records plainly state she is precluded from lifting
over 20 pounds.

(Majors Dep., Exs. 5-7)

Majors claims she told Kristoff that her work

restrictions no longer applied (Majors Dep., pp. 95-98); however, Majors admitted she did not
present any medical evidence to corroborate her claim. (Majors Dep., pp. 104, 107, 279-80) But
even if Majors’ claim that she did not have the permanent restrictions reflected in her medical
records was true, GE’s reliance on the medical records – as opposed to Majors’ contrary claim –
would demonstrate only that GE made a mistake—not engaged in discrimination.

To

demonstrate pretext, Majors “must show more than that the employer’s decision was incorrect;
[she] must also show the employer lied about its proffered explanation.” Johnson v. Nordstrom,
Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 732 (7th Cir. 2001). “It is not the court’s concern that an employer may be
wrong . . . or be too hard on its employee. Rather, the only concern is whether the employer’s
proffered reason was . . . a lie.” Gates, 513 F.3d at 691. GE denied Majors the PMA jobs
because it honestly believed Majors had permanent restrictions that precluded her from
performing the job.

Accordingly, GE is entitled to summary judgment on Majors’ sex

discrimination claim.3

3

Although she alleges sex and disability discrimination, Majors testified that she believes Taylor and Ira
received the PMA job because of personal relationships they had with Company and/or Union personnel.
Majors claims a “conspiracy was going on because they wanted Barry Taylor in the job” -- because his
mother was in Human Resources at GE for a long time and the Safety Committee personnel, including
Taylor’s wife, wanted him to be the PMA. (Majors Dep., pp. 100, 292-93, 295-97) Similarly, Majors
claims that Ira obtained the permanent PMA job because he was “buddy buddy buddy” with Carvin
Thomas, the Union President. (Majors Dep., p. 315) GE denies Majors’ unsupported speculation, but
notes these would be legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for their selections to the PMA position.

B.

GE Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Majors’ Disability
Discrimination Claims.

Majors alleges that by denying her the PMA job because of her permanent work
restrictions, GE regarded her as disabled in violation of the ADA. (Majors Dep., pp. 300-03)
Majors admitted in her deposition that lifting objects weighing in excess of 20 pounds, i.e.,
compressors, boxes of screws, and other materials, is an essential function of the PMA job.
(Majors Dep., pp. 36, 179) Nor does Majors dispute that her medical records say she has
permanent work restrictions precluding her from lifting in excess of 20 pounds. Majors also
acknowledged that GE should not assign work to an employee that is outside of her work
restrictions.

(Majors Dep., pp. 198-99)

Majors contends, however, that her permanent

restrictions no longer apply and that she so advised GE. (Majors Dep., pp. 95-98) But, Majors
admitted that she did not provide GE any medical information to contradict or modify the
permanent work restrictions contained in Majors’ medical file. (Majors Dep., pp. 104, 107,
279-280) Thus, the Court should enter summary judgment in favor of GE.
The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual based upon
such person’s disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines a disability as: (a) a physical
or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual;
(b) a record of such an impairment; or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Majors disclaims having an actual disability; she contends only that GE
regarded her as disabled, which claim is premised upon the Company’s reliance on the medical
restrictions to deny her the PMA job. (Majors Dep., pp. 300-03)
The statute defines the “regarded as” prong of disability as follows:
An individual meets the requirement of ‘being regarded as having such an
impairment’ if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an
action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or

14

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 15 of 31 PageID #: 135

mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a
major life activity.
Id.
1.

GE did not regard Majors as disabled; rather, it properly
adhered to her medical restrictions.

It is well-settled that an employer’s “recognition or implementation of the restrictions
imposed” by a doctor is not enough “to establish a regarded as claim.”

Rivera v. Pfizer

Pharmaceuticals, LLC, 521 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Boldridge v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,
2008 WL 222026, *3 (10th Cir. May 30, 2008) (affirming summary judgment for Tyson on
ADA-perceived disability claim because Tyson’s perception of plaintiff’s impairment “was not
based upon speculation, stereotype, or myth, but upon the…doctor’s written restrictions of her
physical abilities.”); Staszak v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 2002 WL 1858788, *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12,
2002) (summary judgment for employer on ADA claim; “one of [Staszak’s] beefs . . . is . . . that
he was not allowed to ignore his doctors’ orders and work despite the restrictions . . . . Aside
from the fact that we would not endorse such an irresponsible action by Kimberly-Clark, there is
nothing in the ADA that requires a company to disregard uncontroverted medical opinions
simply because an employee has decided to play the odds that the doctor is wrong”).
Accordingly, by adhering to her medical restrictions, GE did not regard Majors as disabled.
In fact, if GE had disregarded Majors’ permanent restrictions, it could have faced liability
under the ADA. In Crosby v. UPMC, 2009 WL 735868 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2009), the court
granted summary judgment for the employer on plaintiff’s ADA claim, and declared:
Plaintiff’s verbal assurances that contradicted the physician’s order, if such
assurances were in fact given, are insufficient to overcome the physician’s
directive. The interactive process creates an obligation on both parties. (internal
citations omitted). If plaintiff believed she was able to do more than what was
indicated on the prescription that she provided to her employer, she should have
submitted a new or revised prescription. Were defendant to not honor the
accommodation called for by the medical information plaintiff provided,
15

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 16 of 31 PageID #: 136

defendant might open itself up to liability of a different stripe. See Smith v.
Henderson, 376 F.3d 529, 537-38 (6th Cir. 2004) (forcing an employee to work in
excess of medical restrictions would support a violation of the ADA).
Id., 2009 WL 735868, * 14.
Consistent with the concern expressed by the court in Crosby, on October 26, 2004,
Majors filed an EEOC charge alleging disability discrimination under the ADA because her
supervisor at the time, Dave Ripley, “attempted to force [her] into violating [her] work
restrictions. For example, . . . Mr. Ripley told me to carry some refrigerator doors. I told him I
had a restriction from a workman’s comp injury and was not supposed to carry doors.” (Majors
Dep. Ex. 11)4 In sharp contrast, Majors now claims that those same permanent work restrictions
no longer apply and GE should have disregarded them.5 Majors admits, however, that she did
not obtain a statement from a doctor removing or modifying her permanent work restrictions.
(Majors Dep., pp. 104, 107, 279-280) Her failure to do so is fatal to her ADA claims. Staszak,
2002 WL1858788, *3; Crosby, 2009 WL 735868, *4.

The Court should enter summary

judgment for GE on Majors’ ADA claims.

4

Majors filed a grievance over the same incident on May 11, 2004, claiming the “BTL [Dave Ripley]
giving work direction that would violate the employee’s restrictions.” (Majors Dep., Ex. 9) GE denied
the grievance, and the Union did not grieve it beyond the second step. (Majors Dep., pp. 79-80) Majors
asserts the Union did not appeal even to step three “because half the people in the Union sucked Dave
Ripley’s butt so they wouldn’t have to work or do anything.” (Majors Dep., p. 80) As to the underlying
event, Dave Ripley arrived at the plant at approximately 9:45 p.m. and, according to Majors, “he finds out
the assembly line area was not working, and the maintenance guys was working on it, and he wanted me
to go over there and do something that was the maintenance man’s job, . . .” (Majors Dep., p. 70) Majors
admits that Ripley asked not only her, but also Bob Dayhuff to go help with the doors and that Dayhuff
did what he was asked. (Majors Dep., pp. 74-75) Majors, on the other hand, told Ripley “no,” she had
other work to do. (Majors Dep., pp. 74-75) Majors claims that thereafter Ripley grabbed her elbow
(Ripley denied grabbing Majors’ elbow). At some point during the conversation, Majors told Ripley she
had work restrictions and was going to go to the clinic; Ripley called the clinic and confirmed Majors had
work restrictions, so he dropped the matter. (Majors Dep., pp. 81-83)
5
Recognizing that her 2004 EEOC charge is inconsistent with her present contention that she did not have
the work restrictions, Majors denied having read the charge prior to signing it even though the charge
states: “I declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct.” (Majors Dep., pp. 88-90;
Ex. 11)

16

2.

Because Majors alleges only that GE regarded her as
disabled, she was not entitled to a reasonable
accommodation under the ADA.

The 2008 amendments to the ADA clarified that an individual “regarded as” disabled (as
opposed to actually disabled) is not entitled to a reasonable accommodation.

42 U.S.C.

12201(h); Accord Powers v. USF Holland, Inc., 2010 WL 1994833 (N.D. Ind. May 13, 2010),
affirmed 667 F.3d 815 (7th Cir. 2011) (“By excluding the requirement to accommodate
individuals who are only regarded as disabled, the ADAAA recognizes the obvious: if an
individual is not actually disabled, then he or she does not need the accommodation in the first
place. Thus, while an employer may not discriminate against persons it perceives as disabled,
the law does not impose a duty upon that employer to accommodate what turns out to be a
fictional impairment.”). Because GE properly relied on Majors’ medical restrictions to deny her
the PMA job and Majors was not entitled to a reasonable accommodation, GE is entitled to
summary judgment on Majors’ ADA claims.
3.

Even if Majors had an actual disability and was entitled
to a reasonable accommodation, her claim would fail as a
matter of law.

Even if Majors were claiming that she had an actual disability that GE had a duty to
reasonably accommodate, her claim would fail. Majors’ only suggested “accommodations”—
having someone else perform the lifting for her or disregarding her permanent restrictions—are
unreasonable as a matter of law.
An employer does not have to remove an essential job function to accommodate a
disabled employee. Povey v. City of Jeffersonville, 2011 WL 1085343 (S.D. Ind. March 21,
2011) (“In sum, Plaintiff’s ‘accommodations’ are not accommodations at all; rather, they are
requests to eliminate certain essential functions of her job.”) (citing Cochrum v. Old Ben Coal
Co., 102 F.3d 908, 912 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding that plaintiff’s request for a “helper” is not a
17

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 18 of 31 PageID #: 138

reasonable accommodation because plaintiff would not be performing the essential functions of
his position). And, it is undisputed that lifting in excess of 20 pounds is an essential function of
the PMA job—Majors admitted this in her deposition, it is identified in the contemporaneous
functional job analysis, and the supervisor over the PMAs also testified as much. Accordingly,
GE had no obligation to remove the lifting requirements of the PMA job. See, e.g., Peters v. City
of Mauston, 311 F.3d 835, 845, 846 (7th Cir. 2002) (noting “we do not second-guess the
employer’s judgment as to the essential functions” and rejecting as “unreasonable” plaintiff’s
“request that someone else do the heaviest lifting for him if he could not handle it” because that
would require another person to perform an essential function); Povey, 2011 WL 1085343 *8
(rejecting plaintiff’s request for a helper to perform cleaning and lifting that are essential to the
job).
Nor, as Majors requests, was GE required to ignore her medical restrictions to allow her
to “try and see” if she could perform the PMA job. As the Seventh Circuit stated in affirming
summary judgment for the employer in Peters v. City of Mauston:
Second, though the district court did not address this issue, we hold that Peters’
proposed “try and see” request is also unreasonable. Allowing the employee to
return to work to see if he can complete the job is the wrong test as to whether an
accommodation is reasonable. See Koshinski v. Decatur Foundry, Inc., 177 F.3d
599, 603 (7th Cir. 1999). The employer is not obligated to allow the employee to
try the job out in order to determine whether some yet-to-be requested
accommodation may be needed. While the law gives the disabled employee the
right to perform the job without a reasonable accommodation, the City determined
that Peters could not safely perform the tasks assigned to an Operator because of
his permanent, physician-imposed lifting restrictions. Given the permanent nature
of those lifting restrictions at that time, we cannot say that Peters would have been
able to complete the job without a reasonable accommodation. Absent any other
reasonable request for an accommodation, the City need not incur additional
liability to “try and see” whether Peters can handle the job despite his permanent
lifting restrictions.
Id. at 846.

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 19 of 31 PageID #: 139

Likewise, in Staszak v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 2002 WL 1858788 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12,
2002), the court granted summary judgment for the employer on the plaintiff’s ADA claim,
stating in relevant part:
The demands of [Staszak’s] sales position included the ability to work beyond 40
hours per week if necessary, a requirement that his doctors concluded he did not
have. Staszak gave Kimberly–Clark no indication that his condition would ever
improve. Indeed, one of his beefs against his former employer is not that he
eventually was able to work more than 40 hours per week but that he was not
allowed to ignore his doctors’ orders and work despite the restrictions. Staszak
classifies this refusal as a failure to accommodate. Aside from the fact that we
would not endorse such an irresponsible action by Kimberly–Clark, there is
nothing in the ADA that requires a company to disregard uncontroverted medical
opinions simply because an employee has decided to play the odds that the doctor
is wrong.
(Id., 2002 WL 1858788, *3). See also Crosby, 2009 WL 735868, *14 (“Plaintiff’s verbal
assurances that contradicted the physician’s order, if such assurances were in fact given, are
insufficient to overcome the physician’s directive. The interactive process creates an obligation
on both parties. If plaintiff believed she was able to do more than what was indicated on the
prescription that she provided to her employer, she should have submitted a new or revised
prescription.”).
If, as she now claims, Majors does not have the permanent restrictions that are reflected
in GE’s records, it was incumbent upon Majors to present medical evidence that those
restrictions did not apply. She failed to do so and cannot now fault GE for her own failings.6

6

Majors contends that because she worked as a PMA from December 2000 to June 2001, she could
perform the job in 2009. Majors ignores, however, that there were 3,200 employees working at GE at that
time and many other employees were available to assist with lifting. As Tony Kristoff testified: “For in
the past when she had the position, they had more staffing at the time and that another person could
remove them [heavier items from the line] and do part of her job for her.” (Kristoff Dep. p. 29) As a
result of significant layoffs and the near closing of the plant, the workforce was down to around 800
employees in 2009, and the PMA had to do the lifting as noted in the job description and functional job
analysis; there were not other people that could “do part of [the] job for her.” (Kristoff Dep. pp. 29-30)

19

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 20 of 31 PageID #: 140

For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant GE summary judgment on
Majors’ disability discrimination claim.
C.

GE Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Majors’ Retaliation Claim.

In her Complaint and her March 30, 2010 EEOC charge, Majors alleges that she filed an
EEOC charge in 2005, and thereafter was “continuously denied overtime.” (Complaint, ¶¶ 15-16
and Ex. C) Majors also asserts she was denied the opportunity to work on LOW Fridays from
October 2008 to November 2009. (Complaint, ¶ 31) Majors’ LOW Friday work claim is barred
because it is outside the scope of her EEOC charges. In addition, her overtime and LOW Friday
work claims are time-barred to the extent based on conduct occurring prior to June 3, 2009—300
days prior to her March 30, 2010 EEOC charge. Majors’ retaliation claim also fails on the merits
for multiple reasons, including: (1) Majors’ supervisors who made the overtime and Friday work
decisions were unaware of her charge and, therefore, could not have retaliated against her;
(2) Majors cannot show that similarly situated employees who did not file charges were treated
better; and (3) Majors cannot prove that GE’s legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its
employment decisions constitute pretext.
1.

Majors’ claim based on the denial of the opportunity to
work on Fridays when the plant was off for LOW is
barred because it is outside the scope of Majors’ EEOC
charges.

“[A]llegations that are not included in an EEOC Charge cannot be contained in a
subsequent complaint filed in the District Court.” Kirk v. Federal Property Mgmt., 22 F.3d 135,
139 (7th Cir. 1994). This rule serves the dual purpose of affording the EEOC and the employer
an opportunity to settle the dispute through conference, conciliation, and persuasion, and of
giving the employer some warning of the conduct about which the employee is aggrieved. Rush
v. McDonald’s Corp., 966 F.2d 1104, 1110 (7th Cir. 1992). The rule is a condition precedent

20

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 21 of 31 PageID #: 141

with which plaintiffs must comply. Babrocky v. Jewel Food Co., 773 F.2d 857, 863 (7th Cir.
1985).
On May 22, 2009, Majors filed an EEOC charge alleging that she was denied a
temporary PMA job on May 7, 2009 because of her disability and sex. The charge made no
other claim. On March 30, 2010, Majors filed another EEOC charge, claiming that she had filed
a charge in 2005 and thereafter was “continuously denied overtime.” Majors did not, however,
make any claim over Friday work in her EEOC charges; thus, her allegations of retaliatory denial
of Friday work are precluded because they are beyond the scope of her EEOC charges.
2.

Majors’ claims based on conduct prior to June 3, 2009
are time-barred.

To pursue a claim under Title VII or the ADA, a plaintiff must file a timely charge with
the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-(5); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a). Because Indiana is a “deferral state,”
Majors had 300 days from the date any alleged adverse employment action occurred to file a
charge alleging a Title VII or ADA violation. Laouini v. CLM Freight Lines, Inc., 586 F.3d 473,
475 (7th Cir. 2009). “A claim is time barred if it is not filed within [this] time limit.” National
Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109 (2002). In Morgan, the Supreme Court
held that the continuing violation doctrine was not applicable except in cases involving hostile
work environment harassment. Id. at 115. In other words, where, as here, plaintiff asserts that
she was denied opportunities to work overtime or on Fridays—which were discrete decisions
known to her at the time they occurred and ostensibly caused her direct economic harm at that
time—she had to file a charge within 300 days of each denial of overtime or Friday work. Id at
110, 113; Roney v. Illinois Dep’t of Transportation, 474 F.3d 455, 460 (7th Cir. 2007).
Because Majors did not raise her overtime claim until her March 30, 2010 EEOC charge,
she can recover, at most, only overtime she allegedly was denied on or after June 3, 2009 (300

21

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 22 of 31 PageID #: 142

days prior to March 30, 2010). As discussed previously, Majors’ Friday work claim is barred
because it is outside the scope of her EEOC charges. But even if she had included it in her
March 30, 2010 charge, this claim would, like her overtime claim, be limited to retaliatory denial
of Fridays on or after June 3, 2009. Nor is there any basis to toll the limitations period. Majors
believed she was being wrongly denied overtime long before she filed her March 30, 2010
EEOC charge. In 2007 and 2008, she filed grievances under the CBA claiming she was denied
overtime. (Majors Dep., Exs. 29-32) Thus, Majors’ overtime and Friday work claims are
limited to the five-month period from June 3, 2009 to October 31, 2009 when she retired. See
Roney, 474 F.3d at 460 (demotion claim untimely despite alleged “continuing nature” where
plaintiff knew about demotion, as evidenced by letter he wrote complaining about it).
3.

Majors’ retaliation claim fails on the merits.

Even if Majors’ overtime and Friday work claims were not time-barred and fell within
the scope of her EEOC charges, she nonetheless could not establish that she was subjected to
unlawful retaliation. First and foremost, Majors’ supervisors—the persons who decided whether
she worked overtime or on LOW Fridays—were unaware of her EEOC charges. Consequently,
they could not have retaliated against her. Even if they had been aware of Majors’ charges, she
still could not establish a prima facie case, because she cannot show that similarly situated
persons were treated better. What is more, GE had legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for its
employment decisions and there is no evidence of pretext.
Title VII prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for filing charges
alleging violations of Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); Sitar v. Indiana Dept. of Transp., 344

22

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 23 of 31 PageID #: 143

F.3d 720, 728 (7th Cir. 2003).7 Majors may prove retaliation via the direct or indirect method.
Nichols v. Southern Illinois University – Edwardsville, 510 F.3d 772, 785 (7th Cir. 2007). The
direct method requires Majors to show that: (1) she engaged protected activity; (2) she suffered
an adverse employment action by GE; and (3) a causal connection between the two events.
Nichols, 510 F.3d at 785. Under the indirect method, Majors must demonstrate that: (1) she
engaged in a protected activity; (2) she met GE’s legitimate expectations; (3) she suffered an
adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less favorably than similarly situated
employees who did not engage in statutorily protected activity. Nichols, 510 F.3d at 785.
Upon proving a prima facie case under the indirect method, GE can rebut the showing by
presenting evidence of “legitimate, noninvidious reasons for its actions.” Atanus v. Perry, 520
F.3d 662, 672 (7th Cir. 2008); Stone v. City of Indianapolis Public Utilities Div., 281 F.3d 640,
644 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 879 (2002) (a reason can be “good or bad provided only
that it is not one that the law forbids”). Once GE articulates legitimate, non-discriminatory
reasons for its actions, Majors must prove GE’s reasons are pretextual – more bluntly – lies. Id.
a.

Because the persons who assigned Majors
overtime and Friday work had no knowledge
of Majors’ EEOC charges, Majors’
retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.

Under both the direct and indirect schemes of proof, the plaintiff must show that the
decision-makers knew of plaintiff’s protected activity—for without knowledge of such protected
activity there can be no showing of an intent to retaliate. Tomanovich v. City of Indianapolis,
457 F.3d 656, 668 (7th Cir. 2006); Durkin v. City of Chicago, 341 F.3d 606, 614–15 (7th Cir.
2003). A decision-maker cannot retaliate against the employee if he or she is unaware of the

7

Count III of Majors’ complaint asserts retaliation only under Title VII, and not under the ADA. The
standards and elements of proof are, however, the same. Consequently, even if Majors had sought to
assert an ADA retaliation claim, it would fail for the same reasons that her Title VII retaliation claim fails.

23

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 24 of 31 PageID #: 144

complaint asserted. Sitar, 344 F.3d at 727; Miller v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 997,
1008 (7th Cir. 2000).
Majors does not claim that either of her BTLs during the relevant time, Gary Hamilton or
Amine Karoud, knew about her EEOC charges, and she does not claim that either of them
retaliated against her.8 Nor did Majors file an EEOC charge or even a grievance over anything
Hamilton or Karoud allegedly did. Because Hamilton and Karoud were not aware of Majors’
charges at the time they made the overtime and Friday work decisions, they could not have
retaliated against Majors for having filed such charges. See Luckie v. Ameritech Corp., 389 F.3d
708, 715 (7th Cir. 2004) (“It is not sufficient that an employer could or even should have known
about an employee's complaint; the employer must have had actual knowledge of the complaints
for its decisions to be retaliatory”); see also Huppert v. Potter, 232 Fed. Appx. 576, 581 (7th Cir.
2007) (summary judgment granted for defendant-employer where the plaintiff provided no
evidence that decision-makers were aware of the plaintiff's EEO complaint).

Accordingly,

Majors’ retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.
b.

Even if her supervisors were aware of
Majors’ charges, Majors still could not
establish a prima facie case, because
Majors cannot identify any similarly
situated employee who did not engage in
protected activity and was treated more
favorably.

Assuming, arguendo, Majors could show her supervisors were aware of her EEOC
charges, Majors’ prima facie case would, nevertheless, fail because Majors cannot identify a

8

The only BTLs Majors claimed retaliated against her were Dave Ripley and Robin Roberts. (Majors
Dep., p. 283) Roberts was Majors’ BTL from October 2005 until October 2008, and Ripley was the BTL
only in 2004 and from October 2008 until January 2009 (Majors Dep., pp. 30-31, 285; Jones Dep. Ex. B,
p. 4), well outside the statute of limitations. Moreover, Majors did not file a charge or grievance claiming
Roberts discriminated against her (Majors Dep., p. 317); and, she testified Roberts was “bipolar,” allowed
her to work some overtime, and had difficulties with a lot of employees. (Majors Dep., pp. 229, 324-25)

24

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 25 of 31 PageID #: 145

similarly situated individual who did not engage in protected activity that was treated more
favorably.
According to the Seventh Circuit:
To satisfy the similarly situated prong of the prima face case, an employee must
be directly comparable in all material respects. This requires the plaintiff to show
not only that the employees reported to the same supervisor, engaged in the same
conduct, and had the same qualifications, but also show that there were no
differentiating or mitigating circumstances as would distinguish…the employer’s
treatment of them.
Ineichen v. Ameritech, 410 F.3d 956, 961 (7th Cir. 2005).
Majors has no admissible evidence that any other QCIs worked more overtime or on
LOW Fridays than she did; she relies solely on the alleged hearsay reports of her hourly
coworkers that they worked certain overtime and Fridays. (Majors Dep., pp. 280-81) Such
hearsay is not, of course, admissible. Davis v. G.N. Mortgage Corp., 396 F.3d 869, 874 n.3 (7th
Cir. 2005); Bombard v. Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc., 92 F.3d 560, 562 (7th Cir. 1996). In any
event, Majors was the only QCI within her cost center and the only QCI who reported to her
supervisors, Hamilton and Karoud. It is undisputed that the supervisor of each cost center
determines what overtime is needed and who performs it.

(Jones Dep., p. 25) It is also

undisputed that under the CBA, overtime is equalized among employees by job classification
within the cost center. (Majors Dep. Ex. 8, p. 18; Ex. 31) Because the other QCIs worked in
other cost centers under different supervisors, Majors is not similarly situated to any other QCIs.9
GE said as much in response to the overtime grievances Majors filed under the CBA. (Majors
Dep. Exs. 29-32) For instance, GE noted: “Rene [Majors] alleges she never works OT in her Job
Code. Compares her OT with QC emp not tied to Main Line – C71, C78 these areas have a lot of

9

As noted previously, Majors claims that only supervisors Robin Roberts and Dave Ripley retaliated
against her and any such alleged retaliation occurred outside the limitations. Majors further admitted that
neither Roberts nor Ripley was the BTL over any of the other QCIs. (Majors Dep., p. 228)

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 26 of 31 PageID #: 146

OT. I compared her to other QC on Main Line and she [Majors] is higher.” (Majors Dep. Ex. 31)
GE denied the grievance, stating: “Ms. Majors has worked overtime within her classification in
her areas of responsibility. Ms. Majors is the sole holder of her classification within her areas of
responsibility; hence, balancing of overtime hours paid is not an issue.” (Majors Dep., Ex. 31)
Accordingly, GE is entitled to summary judgment on Majors’ retaliation claim. Rogers v. City of
Chicago, 320 F.3d 748 (7th Cir. 2003) (summary judgment proper when plaintiffs cannot
produce competent evidence that they were treated differently than similarly situated
employees).
Because Majors cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation, summary judgment
must be entered for GE. See, e.g., Grayson, 317 F.3d at 748 (plaintiff failed to make out a prima
facie case of discrimination and, therefore, the court affirmed the district court’s grant of
summary judgment without reaching the issue of pretext); Jones v. United Pacific R. Co., 302
F.3d 735, 741 (7th Cir. 2002) (“We have often noted that establishing a prima facie case—which
the plaintiff must do by a preponderance of the evidence—is a condition precedent to the pretext
analysis.”).
c.

GE provided legitimate, non-discriminatory
reasons for denying Majors overtime and
Friday work, and she has no evidence of
pretext.

Even if Majors could establish a prima facie case of retaliation (and she cannot), Majors
fails to clear the pretext hurdle. Majors was not asked to work overtime and on LOW Fridays
because her supervisors deemed it unnecessary and were trying to control costs.

Majors

admitted in her deposition that she was so advised. (Majors Dep., pp. 215-16, 229; Exs. 29, 31)
Moreover, as GE stated in response to the grievances Majors filed under the CBA, “Management
has the sole responsibility to determine if and when overtime is required.” “Ms. Majors has

26

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 27 of 31 PageID #: 147

worked overtime within her classification in her areas of responsibility. Ms. Majors is the sole
holder of her classification within her areas of responsibility; hence, balancing of overtime hours
paid is not an issue. There is no violation of the Contract. Remedy is denied.” (Majors Dep.,
Exs. 29, 31) The Union dropped the grievances, recognizing GE’s position was correct. Majors
offers no evidence—and none exists—that the reasons she was not asked to work overtime or on
LOW Fridays constitute pretext for retaliation.
D.

GE Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Majors’ Constructive
Discharge (Retirement) Claim.

Majors alleges that she “experienced duress from Defendant in deciding to take an early
retirement.” (Complaint ¶ 33) Majors testified that she retired because (1) her mother-in-law
was dying of cancer, (2) she did not receive the PMA job, (3) the Company was thinking of
bumping her to the lowest pay grade due to her work restrictions, and (4) she was not getting to
work overtime and on LOW Fridays.

(Majors Dep., p. 191)

For the reasons previously

discussed, GE is entitled to summary judgment on Majors’ claims regarding overtime, LOW
Friday work, and the PMA job. Moreover, Majors admitted no one from GE suggested she was
going to be bumped out of her QCI job. (Majors Dep., p. 192) Finally, that Majors’ mother-inlaw was dying of cancer obviously cannot be attributed to GE.

Accordingly, Majors’

constructive discharge/retirement claim fails as a matter of law.
To prove a constructive discharge claim, Majors must first show that her working
conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person would have been compelled to
resign/retire. Rabinowitz v. Pena, 89 F.3d 482, 489 (7th Cir. 1996). As this Court stated in
Weber v. The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company, 2000 WL 33309378, (S.D. Ind.
March 27, 2000) (J. McKinney):
Intolerability is not established by showing merely that a reasonable person
confronted with the same choices as the employee, would have viewed
27

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 28 of 31 PageID #: 148

resignation as the wisest or best decision, or even that the employee subjectively
felt compelled to resign; presumably every resignation occurs because the
employee believes it is in his best interest to resign. Rather, ‘[i]ntolerability is
assessed by the objective standard of whether a reasonable person in the
employee’s position would have felt compelled to resign,’—that is whether he
would have had no choice but to resign.
Id., 2000 WL 33309378 at *5 (quoting Connors v. Chrysler Finance Corp., 160 F.3d 971, 976
(3rd Cir. 1998)) (emphasis in original). Second, Majors must demonstrate that the conditions
were intolerable because of unlawful discrimination. Drake v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co.,
134 F.3d 878, 886 (7th Cir. 1998).
1.

Majors cannot show that her working conditions were so
intolerable that a reasonable person would have been
compelled to retire.

In Henn v. National Geographic Soc., 819 F.2d 824 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied 484 U.S.
964 (1987), the Seventh Circuit considered age discrimination claims by plaintiffs who had
chosen early retirement and then claimed constructive discharge. There, the plaintiffs argued
that they had been constructively discharged because their employer gave them the “silent
treatment” and threatened them with “unpleasant consequences” if they did not improve their job
performance. Id. at 829. In affirming summary judgment, the Seventh Circuit held that a
showing of constructive discharge depends on what the employer communicated to the
employee, not the employee’s beliefs. Id. at 830. “In essence a constructive discharge occurs
only if the employee can show that he would have been fired if they turned down an offer of
early retirement.” Weber v. The Western and Southern Life Ins. Co., 2000 WL 33309378, *5-6
(S.D. Ind. March 27, 2000) (McKinney, J.) (applying Henn and holding plaintiff’s constructive
discharge claim failed because he did not show he would have been fired had he not chosen
retirement).

28

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 29 of 31 PageID #: 149

Majors cannot show that she “would have been [demoted, much less] fired if [she] had
decided to continue working or even that [GE] was pressuring [her] to take early retirement.”
Weber, 2000 WL 33309378 at * 6. To the contrary, in the 2007-2011 national CBA, GE and the
union negotiated a voluntary SERO Window that was available to employees across the United
States who had at least 25 years of service and were age 55 or over. As Joe Jones testified, the
SERO Window “allow[ed] people to retire early and draw really good benefits.” (Jones Dep.,
p. 43) On August 24, 2009, prior to being denied the permanent PMA job, Majors voluntarily
submitted her application for the SERO window, entitling her to an additional $1,056 per month
until she reached age 63 (for six years). Majors was neither told that she would have been fired
if she decided to decline the SERO, nor did GE exert any pressure in offering the SERO to her.
Moreover, if Majors felt her conditions were so intolerable as to force her retirement, why – after
she filed for retirement – did she apply for a job in the plant. Further, Majors made over $25.00
per hour as a QCI. The PMA job was, like her QCI job, in the bargaining unit and paid only
$1.50 more per hour. (Majors Dep., pp. 342-43; Ex. 46, p. 8) Construing the facts in Majors’
favor, there is no evidence that GE forced Majors to retire; rather, she retired of her own volition.
2.

Majors Has No Evidence That Her Working Conditions
Were Due to Unlawful Discrimination.

Assuming, arguendo, Majors could show that her working conditions were so intolerable
that a reasonable person would have been compelled to resign (she cannot), Majors still cannot
demonstrate that the denial of overtime hours, LOW Friday work, or the PMA jobs were because
of unlawful discrimination. As discussed above, Majors was denied overtime hours and Friday
work opportunities because her supervisors deemed it unnecessary, and because overtime and
Friday work opportunities were limited for Majors’ position in her cost center. Further, GE
denied Majors the PMA jobs due to her permanent medical restrictions, not because of her sex or

29

Case 1:10-cv-01731-LJM-MJD Document 39 Filed 04/13/12 Page 30 of 31 PageID #: 150

because it regarded Majors as disabled. Majors can provide no evidence that would enable a
reasonable jury to conclude that GE discriminatorily denied Majors overtime hours, Friday work,
or the PMA jobs. Consequently, Majors’ constructive discharge claim also fails because she
cannot demonstrate that her working conditions were intolerable because of unlawful
discrimination.
V.

CONCLUSION

Majors’ sex and disability discrimination and retaliation claims are wholly without
factual or legal merit, and her pursuit of such claims was, and remains, unreasonable. The Court
should enter summary judgment in favor of GE, dismiss Majors’ claims in their entirety, and
grant GE such other relief as is just and proper, including all costs it has incurred defending
against this action.
