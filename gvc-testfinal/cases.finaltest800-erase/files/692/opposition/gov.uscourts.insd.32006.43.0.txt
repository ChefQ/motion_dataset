CASE NO. 1:10-cv-1731-LJM-MJD

PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I.

Introduction
Plaintiff, Renee Majors (“Majors”), a former employee of Defendant, General Electric

Company (“GE”), makes federal claims of disability and sex discrimination and retaliation under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended (“ADA”) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended (“Title VII”). Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff’s claims
should be denied for the reasons set forth in detail herein.
There are genuine issues of material fact, including those related to:


whether Majors was disabled under the provisions of the ADA;



whether Majors was substantially limited in the major life activity of
lifting;



whether Majors’ medical restrictions were current;



whether GE’s actions regarding failure to promote were motivated by the
unlawful reason of Majors’ disability;



whether GE’s actions regarding the assignment of overtime and Fridays
were motivated by the unlawful reason of retaliation.

These factual issues preclude summary judgment.

II.

Undisputed Material Facts That Preclude Summary Judgment
A.

The Job Descriptions

Julia Karr was responsible for reviewing the job descriptions. (Ex D: Jones Dep., p. 7, 25)
Jones was not aware of any routine schedule for the review of job descriptions. (Ex D: Jones
Dep., p. 23) The PMA (Purchased Materials Auditor) and QCI (Quality Control Inspector) job
descriptions, at the relevant time, had been last reviewed sixteen years prior, in 1993. (Ex. I: GE
Response to Request for Documents – GE000674 and GE000676) Both jobs had physical
requirements that included “intermittent movement of heavy objects,” without quantification of
“heavy.” (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for Documents – GE000674 and GE000676) The QCI
job description included the physical requirement of “intermittent work above shoulder level,”
while the PMA job description did not. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for Documents –
GE000674 and GE000676)
B.

Majors’ Job Performance Met Expectations

Majors was qualified for her job as a QCI at GE; her performance was rated as
satisfactory and she was eligible for re-employment. (Ex. H: Myers Dep., p. 16)
C.

The QCIs

There were four to five QCIs in the plant. (Ex C: East Dep., p. 9) QCIs brought defective
parts to the PMA’s location; stock handlers did not move the defective parts and neither did the
PMAs retrieve them from the QCIs. (Ex C: East Dep., p. 11)
D.

Majors Had Previously Held a PMA Position

Majors had previously worked as a PMA from December 2000 to June 2001. (Ex A:

2

Majors Dep., p. 20)
E.

Majors’ Injury and Subsequent Restrictions

Majors was injured on the job on September 20, 2000, when she fell and dislocated her
right shoulder. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for Documents – GE000248) On December 5,
2000, GE’s physician classified her as temporarily restricted from lifting more than 20 pounds
and from working above eye level with her right arm. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for
Documents – GE000551; Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 58) On August 9, 2001, GE’s physician
classified Majors as permanently restricted from lifting more than 20 pounds and from working
above eye level with her right arm. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for Documents – GE000309;
Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 76) A Medical Classification form dated March 9, 2001 with identical
restrictions, but not signed by a physician, was also completed. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request
for Documents – GE000310; Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 76-77) On September 24, 2002, Majors was
classified as permanently restricted from lifting more than 20 pounds and from working above
eye level with her right arm. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for Documents – GE000487; Ex F:
Kristoff Dep., p. 59)
F.

The Permanency of Majors’ Restrictions

Only Toni Kristoff, or other Concentra staff, had access to the medical records, all of
which were securely stored on-site at the plant. (Ex D: Jones Dep., p. 37) There was no regular
cycle established to review the currency of permanent medical restrictions. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep.,
p. 76) Majors’ Medical Classification form dated August 9, 2001 had the notation “prn” (as
needed”) in the “RE-EXAM” space. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for Documents –
GE000309; Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 76) Majors’ Medical Classification form dated September
24, 2002 had the notation “D/C” in the “RE-EXAM” space. (Ex. I: GE Response to Request for

3

Documents – GE000487; Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 59) When Kristoff filed the Medical
Classification forms, she arranged them in reverse chronological order. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p.
24)
The medical restrictions review process is not documented anywhere. (Ex F: Kristoff
Dep., p. 40) Kristoff agreed that there was no difference in the lifting requirements for the QCI
and the PMA positions. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 25-26) Kristoff acknowledged that Majors’
medical restrictions had been an issue in 2005 after an ankle injury when she applied for a C82
position. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 35, 68)
G.

GE’s Accommodation Review

GE accommodated Majors after her ankle injury when she applied for a fabrication
position that involved pulling oneself up and into the seat of a large fork lift. (Ex G: Lewellen
Dep., p. 16-17) GE previously accommodated Majors when she applied for the QCI position; she
was permitted to use a platform to address her range of reach and her ability to reach over the top
of the refrigerators to verify the torque applied to screws. (Ex G: Lewellen Dep., p. 14)
GE agrees with and quotes Majors when she states “for years and years and years, it’s
like anytime anybody had a restriction, … the Clinic and the Ergonomics made accommodations
for those people, so – if there was any way possible, they could get those jobs.” (Ex A: Majors
Dep., p. 182)
H.

Majors’Retirement

Majors applied for the second PMA position after she elected to retire. (Ex E: Karr Dep.,
p. 7)
I.

Majors’Access to Overtime and Fridays Compared to Other QCIs

GE’s complement of QCI’s included: Majors, Abrams, and Taylor, each one a job

4

classification 9014; and Breedlove, May, Lewis, and Ira, each one a job classification 9018. (Ex.
J: Supplemental Information Regarding QCI’s, March 5, 2012) Abrams replaced Majors. (Ex.
H: Myers Dep., p. 8)

Taylor was on a leave of absence prior to April 5, 2009. (Ex. J:

Supplemental Information Regarding QCI’s, March 2, 2012) Breedlove became a lab technician
on March 1, 2009. (Ex. J: Supplemental Information Regarding QCI’s, March 5, 2012) The
9018 QCI records were produced by GE “to give … an idea of the hours generally worked by
QCI’s.” (Ex. J: Supplemental Information Regarding QCI’s, March 2, 2012)
1. Overtime 1
GE’s time records for QCI’s for calendar year 2009 show the following regarding
overtime: Majors worked 92.9 hours in 2008 and 26.6 hours in 2009, prior to her retirement;
Abrams worked 208.1 hours in 2010; Taylor worked 40.8 hours in 2009 … he was on a leave of
absence prior to April 5, 2009; May worked 204.0 hours; and Ira worked 241.2 hours. (Ex. K:

GE’s time records for QCI’s for June 2009 to October 2009 show the following regarding
overtime: Majors worked 55.3 hours for June to October 2008 and 14.6 hours in the same period
in 2009, prior to her retirement; Abrams worked 75.1 hours in 2010; Taylor worked 11.9 hours
in 2009 … he was on a leave of absence prior to April 5, 2009; May worked 147.6 hours; and Ira
worked 139.6 hours. (Ex. K: GE Response to Request for Production of Documents, GE000051

GE’s time records for QCI’s for calendar year 2009 show the following regarding
Fridays: Majors worked 22 in 2008 and 10 in 2009, prior to her retirement; Abrams worked 34 in
2010; Taylor worked 10 in 2009 … he was on a leave of absence prior to April 5, 2009; May

III.

Statement of Material Facts in Dispute
A.

Whether Majors Lifted Heavy Parts in a Previously Held PMA Position

Majors handled compressors and other heavy parts during her earlier tenure as a PMA
from December 2000 to June 2001. (Ex A: Majors Dep., p. 20)
B.

Whether Majors’ Medical Restrictions Were Properly Deemed Permanent

Majors contended that it was possible that the medical restrictions no longer applied to
her; Kristoff, on the other hand, took the position that it was not possible … that the restrictions
remained permanent. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 80-81) At least on one occasion, on September 6,
2005, Kristoff was uncertain about the permanency of Majors’ medical restrictions, as evidenced

6

by her call to the doctor involved. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 82; Ex. I: GE Response to Request for
Production of Documents, GE000287)
Kristoff claimed no knowledge that Majors thought that the restrictions no longer
applied. (Ex F: Kristoff Dep., p. 81) Majors testified that she had repeatedly told Kristoff in May
2009 that permanent restrictions no longer applied; she also advised Karr and Jones of the same
thing, when they disqualified her from the PMA position that was open in May 2009. (Ex A:
Majors Dep., p. 96-97) GE suggested that Majors should have provided her own doctor’s
statement removing the medical restrictions despite her injury being work-related and invoking
the Worker’s Compensation Act. (Ex A: Majors Dep., p. 104)
C.

Whether GE’s Accommodation Review Met the Legal Requirements of the ADA

GE described an interactive review process to determine whether Majors could be
accommodated in some manner to permit her to perform the PMA job. (Ex E: Karr Dep., p. 39)
Karr, though the chairperson of the ADA Committee, was not part of this process. (Ex E: Karr
Dep., p. 39) She described the interactive process used for Majors as not part of the ADA
process. (Ex E: Karr Dep., p. 39) Lewellen and Majors discussed the option of having a material
handler transport the larger defective parts. (Ex G: Lewellen Dep., p. 10-11)
D.

Whether Majors’Retirement Was Chosen Under Duress

Majors asserts that she elected to retire under “distress.” (Ex A: Majors Dep., p. 190-192)
She had just returned from her mother’s funeral when confronted with making the retirement
decision, was trying to cope with being awarded the PMA job and then being disqualified for it,
and continuing to be denied overtime and the opportunity to work Fridays. (Ex A: Majors Dep.,
p. 190-192)
E.

Whether Majors Was Disfavored Regarding Her Access to Overtime and Fridays
Compared to Other QCIs

7

The Collective Bargaining Agreement provided for the assignment of overtime; however,
Majors disagreed, describing actual practice by stating “But that’s not the way it’s ever been.”
(Ex A: Majors Dep., p. 66-67)
F.

Scope of the EEOC Charges

At the time she filed her second EEOC Charge on March 30, 2010, Majors provided the
EEOC with the attached, handwritten document so that they would investigate the issues of
assignment of overtime and working Fridays. (Ex. B: Majors’ Aff., Ex. 1, ¶ 3)

V.

Standard of Review
A.

Summary Judgment

A genuine issue of material fact exists if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury
to return a verdict in favor of the non-moving party on the particular issue. Anderson v. Liberty
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate “that
there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party’s case.” Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). The record should be examined in the light most favorable to
the non-moving party. Fisher v. Wayne Dalton Corp., 139 F.3d 1137, 1140 (7th Cir. 1998).
Since intent and credibility are crucial issues in employment discrimination cases, the summary
judgment standard is “applied with added rigor” in such cases. Huff v. UARCO, Inc., 122 F.3d
374, 380 (7th Cir. 1997).

B.

Prima Facie Case of Disability Discrimination under the ADA

Majors uses the burden-shifting methodology set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

8

Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). She “must show: (1) that [s]he is disabled within the meaning of the
ADA, (2) that [s]he was qualified for the … position …, (3) that [s]he was subject to an adverse
employment action, and (4) that the circumstances surrounding the adverse action indicate that it
is more likely than not that … [her] disability was the reason for it.” (citations omitted). If
Majors succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, GE must then offer a lawful,
nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse action. Silk v. City of Chicago, 194 F.3d 788, 799 (7th
Cir. 1999). If GE does so, Majors must rebut that reason by showing that the proffered reason is
actually a pretext for discrimination.

C.

Retaliation

The Seventh Circuit has explained that there are two ways in which a plaintiff can prove
retaliation. See Rogers v. City of Chi. , 320 F.3d 748 (7th Cir. 2003); Sitar v. Indiana Dep’t of
Transp., 344 F.3d 720 (7th Cir. 2003); Stone v. City of Indianapolis Pub. Utils. Div., 281 F.3d
640 (7th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 879 (2002). The first method, known as the direct
method, is similar to the approach adopted by other circuits, and requires proof that: 1) the
employee engaged in protected activity; 2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and 3)
there is a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. HuntGolliday v. Metropolitan Water Reclamation Dist., 104 F.3d 1004, 1014 (7th Cir. 1997).
As the Rogers court explained, the second method, or indirect method, does not require
the plaintiff to demonstrate a “causal link between [the] protected action and an adverse
employment action.” Rogers, 320 F.3d at 755. The court in Stone held that a plaintiff need only
show that “after filing the charge only she, and not any similarly situated employee who did not
file a charge, was subjected to an adverse employment action even though she was performing

9

her job in a satisfactory manner. If the defendant presents no evidence in response, the plaintiff is
entitled to summary judgment. If the defendant presents unrebutted evidence of a noninvidious
reason for the adverse action, she is entitled to summary judgment. Otherwise there must be a
trial.” Stone, 281 F.3d at 644.

V.

Argument
A.

Majors Was Disabled Under the Provisions of the ADA

An individual is disabled under the ADA if he (A) has a “physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities;” (B) has “a record of such an
impairment,” or (C) is “regarded as having such an impairment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).

1.

Majors’ Impairment “Substantially Limited” A Major Life Activity

An impairment “substantially limits” a major life activity when the individual is “unable
to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform” or
is “significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can
perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner or duration under
which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.” 29
C.F.R. § 1630.2(j).
2.

Lifting Is A Major Life Activity

The persuasive authority of the Tenth Circuit sheds light on lifting as a major life activity
in a case involving 26 plaintiffs, all of whom had lifting limitations. The Court found that “a
plaintiff’s permanent lifting restriction of fifteen pounds is sufficient to defeat summary
judgment, even absent evidence comparing the individual to the ability of the general population,
as prescribed in 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1).” Gallegos v. Swift & Company, 237 F.R.D. 633, 643

10

(D. Colo. 2006) (citing Lowe v. Angelo’s Italian Foods, Inc., 87 F.3d 1170, 1174 (10th Cir.1996)
and Lusk v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 238 F.3d 1237, 1240 (10th Cir.2001). “Such a restriction
is ‘substantially limiting on its face’ and creates a ‘genuine issue of material fact with respect to
whether (plaintiff’s) impairment substantially limited the major life activity of lifting.” Id. (citing
Lusk, 238 F.3d at 1240.
The Seventh Circuit found that a physician’s restrictions prohibiting a plaintiff from
overhead work, heavy lifting and pushing or pulling out from his body “might apply to a broad
range of jobs, and are more than job specific,” and thus defeat summary judgment even absent
more specific analysis of the jobs from which he was excluded. Cochrum v. Old Ben Coal Co.,
102 F.3d 908, 911 (7th Cir. 1996).
“The physical restrictions Cochrum’s physician placed upon him--no overhead work,
heavy lifting, or pulling and pushing out from his body--might apply to a broad range of jobs,
and are more than job specific. As with the example of the bad back in the regulations,
Cochrum’s shoulder injury could disqualify him from any position at the mine, or in related work
such as construction. In addition to listing a number of jobs in the mine, the magistrate judge
seems to have assumed as a matter of law that plenty of places would employ Cochrum with his
shoulder condition. But given the breadth of his physician’s physical restrictions, a reasonable
jury could conclude that Cochrum’s shoulder impairment does substantially limit his ability to
work. See, e.g., Hendry v. GTE North, Inc., 896 F.Supp. 816, 824 (N.D. Ind.1995) (issues of
material fact existed as to whether employee was limited in major life activity of working due to
migraine headaches). Cochrum has at least raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether
or not he is disabled under the ADA.” Gallegos v. Swift & Company, 237 F.R.D. at 646 (citing
Cochrum v. Old Ben Coal Co., 102 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 1996).

11

Similarly, Majors has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not she is
disabled under the ADA.

GE’s position is that Majors “admits” she is not disabled and,

therefore, there is no need to reasonably accommodate her. Majors makes such an “admission”
from a layman’s perspective of the definition … she does not believe herself to be physically or
mentally impaired. She, and GE as well, fail to examine the two other legal prongs of the
definition. Here, one, if not both, of the remaining prongs of the definition of disabled applies,
namely, the “record of impairment” prong and the “regarded as” prong. The genuine issue of
material fact regarding whether or not Majors was disabled renders dismissal by summary
judgment inappropriate for her claim of disability discrimination.
3.

Record of Impairment

An individual can also qualify as disabled if he has a record of an impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B). This provision is
intended to protect individuals who are not presently disabled but who may have been
discriminated against because of a history of a disability, or because they have been misclassified
as disabled. 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App.
The words of the regulations that are particularly applicable in Majors’ case relate to the
intent to protect “individuals who are not presently disabled but who may have been
discriminated against because of a history of a disability.”

Majors claims that she is not

presently disabled and that the permanent restrictions no longer apply to her. Majors’ “record of
impairment” consists of the various Medical Classification forms that were in Kristoff’s custody.
Majors was disabled according to the “record of impairment” requirements. GE violated the law
when it failed to engage in the “reasonable accommodation” process.

12

4.

Regarded as Impaired

An individual can also qualify as disabled if he is regarded as disabled. 42 U.S.C. §
12102(2)(C). An individual qualifies under this prong either by showing that an employer
“mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activities,” or that an employer “mistakenly believes that an actual, non-limiting
impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.” Sutton v. United Air Lines,
Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489 (1999). In either case, an employer must “entertain misperceptions about
the individual.” Id. An employer is liable under the “regarded” theory even if the employer’s
misperception is innocent, based on a mistake of fact or on a mistaken interpretation of a medical
report. Buskirk v. Apollo Metals, 307 F.3d 160, 167 (3rd Cir. 2002).
GE denies that it regarded Majors as disabled. Yet, it took her medical restrictions as
genuine and enforced them (this time). Case law also supports lifting as a major life activity.
Clearly, GE regarded Majors as disabled.
B.

Majors Was A Qualified Individual under the ADA

A “qualified individual” is defined in relevant part as “an individual with a disability
who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the
employment position that such individual holds or desires.” 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). A plaintiff
must satisfy “the prerequisites for the position, such as possessing the appropriate educational
background, employment experience, skills, licenses, etc.,” and be able to “perform the essential
functions of the position held or desired, with or without reasonable accommodation.” 29 C.F.R.
App. § 1630.2(m).
GE does not dispute Majors’ qualifications related to education and experience. Rather,
GE challenges her ability to perform an essential function of the PMA position … “intermittent

13

lifting of heavy objects.”

GE never progressed as far as a consideration of “reasonable

accommodation.”
C.

GE Failed to Accommodate Majors in Violation of the ADA

The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with a disability. 42 U.S.C. §
12112(a). Discrimination includes failure to make a reasonable accommodation to the known
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual, unless the accommodation
“would impose an undue hardship on the operation” of the employer. 42 U.S.C. §
12112(b)(5)(A).
GE never progressed as far as a consideration of “reasonable accommodation,” though it
had done so on numerous previous occasions. The difference this time was the fact that a
promotion was at stake. It ignored the requirement that the process be interactive. When Majors
suggested using the material handlers to help move heavy objects, her idea was flatly rejected
without a counter-proposal. GE considered Majors’ proposal to be an “undue hardship” on the
company … the record reflects no evidence as to why. GE denied Majors her rights when it
failed to engage in the interactive “reasonable accommodation” process.
D.

GE’s Reason for Failing to Promote Majors Is Pretextual

GE asserts the reason Majors was not promoted to the PMA positions in 2009 was her
inability to perform an essential function of the job, that is, intermittent lifting of heavy objects,
due to her permanent medical restrictions. GE’s reason is pretextual, considering the following
observations:
1.

GE Previously Permitted Majors to Work as a PMA in Violation of Her
Medical Restrictions

Majors worked as a PMA from December 2000 until June 2001. During this period,

14

Majors was temporarily restricted from lifting more than 20 pounds and from working above eye
level with her right arm. Despite GE’s contention, without any evidence, that there were more
plastic parts at that time, the applicable job description was the same one that was last revised in
1993 and used to disqualify her from the PMA positions in 2009.

The requirement for

“intermittent lifting of heavy objects” existed at both times; Majors’ medical restrictions were
the same at both times; yet, Majors was denied the PMA positions. GE’s inconsistencies in this
regard smack of pretext.
2.

GE Allowed Majors to Remain a QCI in Violation of Her Medical
Restrictions

GE created another inconsistency when it let Majors remain in the QCI position even
though the QCI would be required to accomplish “intermittent lifting of heavy objects,”
according to the job description. Apparently, GE appreciates precision regarding the weights of
parts handled by the PMA’s but not so for the QCI’s. Under Majors’ restrictions, she could,
according to GE, perform the QCI job but not the PMA job.
3.

GE Failed to Keep Majors’ Medical Restrictions Current

On September 24, 2002, Majors was classified as permanently restricted from lifting
more than 20 pounds and from working above eye level with her right arm. There were no
updates in the approximately seven years between the time the restrictions were given and the
time they were used to deny Majors the 2009 PMA promotions. They were, however, reviewed
at least once after 2001, when the company doctor initially made the restrictions permanent. If
the Medical Classification forms were in fact arranged in the file in reverse chronological order,
as she testified they were, Kristoff would have seen the inconsistencies and the need to reexamine the restrictions.

15

Moreover, the Medical Classification form had a space titled “RE-EXAM,” where either
a date or the abbreviation “prn” (as needed) was written. GE contemplated subsequent review of
the restrictions, as indicated by the notation “prn” on Majors’ Medical Classification form dated
August 9, 2001.

Majors’ Medical Classification form dated September 24, 2002 had the

notation “D/C” in the “RE-EXAM” space. The layout of the Medical Classification form itself
clearly indicates it was intended to be reviewed and updated.
Kristoff had multiple opportunities to resolve the issue of the currency of the medical
restrictions by simply having the company doctor re-examine Majors. She knew they were an
issue in 2005 when Majors had an ankle injury … she did nothing. She knew they were an issue
in May 2009, when Majors was disqualified from the temporary PMA position … she did
nothing and unbelievably claimed Majors said nothing about it to her. GE suggested that Majors
should have provided her own doctor’s statement removing the medical restrictions, ignoring the
fact that her injury was work-related, which made it a worker’s compensation matter and the
company doctor responsible for patient management.
Majors was very vocal about the misapplication of the restrictions. The fact that Kristoff
then did nothing between May and October 2009, when Majors was disqualified from the
permanent PMA position, is even more astounding … her refusal to reevaluate the permanency
of the restrictions let the disqualification process unfold for a second disappointing time for
Majors. Kristoff’s claim of lack of knowledge regarding Majors’ clearly articulated position is
disingenuous and smells of pretext.
GE focused on the essential functions of the PMA position and, in particular, the lifting
requirements without consideration of whether Majors’ restrictions still applied. Had it given the
latter due consideration, the ensuing litigation may have been avoided altogether. GE was

16

unreasonably steadfast in maintaining that Majors’ work restrictions were not subject to review
to assure their currency. In so doing, GE prevented Majors from being promoted because of her
record of disability.
4.

Job Descriptions for Majors’ Present and Desired Positions Remained
Identical Regarding Lifting Requirements

There is no evidence that GE did anything between May and October 2009 to clarify the
QCI and PMA job descriptions as to lifting requirements.

E.

Majors Can Establish A Claim For Retaliation By Direct Evidence
1.

Protected Activity

Even if Majors’ underlying claim of discrimination should fail, her claim of retaliation
can survive. Pantoja v. American NTN Bearing Mfg. Corp., 495 F.3d 840 (7th Cir. 2007). As
long as Majors truly did believe she was discriminated against by GE at the time she first
complained, she will be deemed to have engaged in protected activity under the law. Bernier v.
Morningstar, Inc., 495 F.3d 369, 376 (7th Cir. 2007).
“Oppositional”

protected

activity

and

“participatory”

protected

activity

are

distinguishable. The “participation clause” in Title VII provides that an employer may not
retaliate against an employee because the employee has participated in any manner in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing.

Importantly, it is designed to assure that Title VII

protections are not undermined by retaliation against employees who use the Title VII process to
protect their rights.
On the other hand, the “opposition clause” of Title VII provides that an employer may
not retaliate against an employee because he has opposed an unlawful employment practice
under Title VII. Vaughn v. Epworth Villa, 2008 WL 3843340 (10th Cir. 2008)

17

Majors fully engaged in oppositional protected activity when she filed her EEOC charge
on May 22, 2009. See Worth v. Tyer, 276 F.3d 249, 265 (7th Cir. 2001) (“statutorily protected”
activity not limited to filing of EEOC charge). GE has not and cannot put forth any legitimate
reason why Majors’ oppositional protected activity is, in any way, tainted. Therefore, she meets
the required element of proof related to protected activity … she opposed what she believed to be
unlawful activity.
2.

Adverse Employment Actions

Though broadly defined, “adverse employment action” in the context of a retaliation
claim must result in some significant change in employment status. Bell v. EPA, 232 F.3d 546,
555 (7th Cir. 2000). Both qualitative and quantitative changes in terms or conditions of
employment are considered. Patt v. Family Health Sys., 280 F.3d 749, 753 (7th Cir. 2002). The
adverse employment action must be “a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of
employment [that is] more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job
responsibilities.” Crady v. Liberty Nat'l Bank and Trust Co., 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993).
Here, Majors asserts that GE denied her overtime and the opportunity to work Fridays.
Clearly, the negative economic impact associated with these lost opportunities for more work
constitutes a material adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment. This element
of proof is established.
3.

Causal Connection

Close temporal proximity is evidence of causation and “may permit a plaintiff to survive
summary judgment provided that there is also other evidence that supports the inference of a
causal link.” Lang v. Ill. Dep't of Children & Family Servs., 361 F.3d 416, 419 (7th Cir. 2004).
Majors engaged in protected activity on May 22, 2009 when she filed her first EEOC

18

charge. For the period May to October, Majors worked 55.3 hours of overtime in 2008; her
overtime for the same period in 2009 was only 14.6 hours … a 74% decrease. Similarly, for the
period May to October, Majors worked 9 Fridays in 2008; her Fridays for the same period in
2009 was only 3 … a 67% decrease. This close temporal proximity is, on its face and without
more, evidence of a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment
actions.
Majors can establish a prima facie case of retaliation by the direct method of proof and
should be permitted to take her case to the jury. GE‘s motion for summary judgment should be
denied.
F.

Majors Can Establish A Claim For Retaliation ByThe Indirect Method
1.

Protected Activity And Adverse Employment Actions

As previously addressed, Majors engaged in the protected activity required to prove that
element of her claim for retaliation. In addition, Majors has met the element of proof related to
the adverse employment action.
2.

Work Performance Met Expectations

Majorss was qualified for her job as a QCI at GE; her performance was rated as
satisfactory and she was eligible for re-employment.
3.

Treatment Less Favorable Than Similarly Situated Employees

In its brief, GE addresses the issue of the required comparison to similarly situated
employees with mere conclusory statements about the equalization of overtime … even though
GE maintains that equalization just happened as a result of the CBA’s very existence. GE
presents no evidence that equalization occurred … because it did not. Majors, on the other hand,
can point to supporting data … the time records produced by GE.

19

There is no record evidence that any other QCI employees besides Majors filed EEOC
charges alleging denial of the opportunity for overtime and Friday work. Therefore, every other
QCI employee besides Majors is in the “comparison” universe. GE can point to no other
employee in that universe who was performing satisfactorily and who was subjected to the same
adverse employment action sustained by Majors. Majors was the only one who was performing
satisfactorily and was denied overtime and the opportunity to work Fridays.
G.

GE’s Reasons For Its Actions Are Pretextual

GE bears the burden of explaining its actions as Majors has established a prima facie case
of retaliation. The truth and veracity of GE’s proffered non-discriminatory reasons for its
conduct completely fall apart upon examination of the following circumstances:
1. GE’s Equalization Argument Is Unsupported
The distribution of overtime and Fridays was to be done in a manner provided by the
CBA that would result in employees in the same job classification receiving approximately the
same amount of extra work. An examination of time records, as described elsewhere herein,
clearly shows just the opposite. Majors also testified that this theoretical system was not how it
worked. GE presented no evidence regarding this theoretical norm.

2. Supervisors’ Knowledge Regarding EEOC Activity
GE argues that the two supervisors who scheduled Majors’ overtime and Fridays had no
knowledge of Majors having filed an EEOC charge. This would be a valid argument but for the
untimely death of one of the supervisors, Gary Hamilton, who passed before suit was filed.
Under the circumstances, Majors was placed in a position where it was impossible to determine
what Hamilton knew or did not know and what he did or did not do regarding the assignment of

20

overtime and Friday work.
3. Similarly Situated Employees Were Treated More Favorably
Majors has more than mere hearsay evidence to support her assertion that other QCI’s
were treated more favorably than her. For example, Abrams, who was Majors’ replacement,
worked eight times more overtime in 2010 than Majors worked in 2009. May and Ira worked
eight and nine times the overtime that Majors worked in 2009.
GE argues that the job classifications (9014 vs 9018) for QCI’s account for the
discrepancies but, interestingly, offers no evidence of the distinction (eg., job descriptions) that
would explain the wide variance in overtime hours worked.
The most reasonable inference derived from these circumstances is that GE denied
Majors overtime and the opportunity to work Fridays because she complained about
discrimination to the EEOC. GE’s reasons for its employment decisions constitute pretext.
Since GE’s reasons for its employment decisions are pretextual, they are therefore not a
defense to Majors’ claim for retaliation. GE‘s motion for summary judgment should be denied
and Majors’ case should go to the jury.

H.

Allegations Outside the Body of the Charge Should Be Considered

It is well established that the scope of an EEOC charge limits the scope of a subsequent
federal complaint. Teal v. Potter, 559, F.3d 687, 691 (7th Cir. 1992). Employees who claim to
have suffered discrimination pursuant to Title VII or the ADA must exhaust administrative
remedies prior to bringing a lawsuit by filing an administrative charge claiming discrimination.
29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(1).
Cognizable claims set forth in a complaint must be “like or reasonably related to the

21

allegations of the charge and growing out of such allegations.” Jenkins v. Blue Cross Mut. Hosp.
Ins., 538 F.2d 164, 167 (7th Cir.) (en banc). Claims are not alike or reasonably related unless a
factual relationship exists between them. Cheek v. W. & S. Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 501 (7th
Cir. 1994). At a minimum, plaintiff's EEOC charge and complaint must describe the same
conduct and implicate the same individuals. See Id.
“Nevertheless, because EEOC charges are often completed by laypersons, a Title VII
plaintiff need not allege each and every fact in the charge that, in the aggregate, form the basis of
the claims in the complaint.” Cheek, 31 F.3d at 500; Babrocky v. Jewel Food Co., 773 F.2d 857,
865-66 (7th Cir. 1985) (holding that it is an error for a court to require an exact correspondence
between the words of an EEOC charge and the contents of a Title VII complaint and that EEOC
charges are to be construed with “utmost liberality”).
Allegations outside the body of the charge may be considered when it is clear that the
charging party intended the agency to investigate the allegations. See, e.g., Rush, 966 F.2d at
1110-11 (plaintiff's EEOC affidavit contained “explicit reference” to types of discrimination
alleged in complaint); Box v. A & P Tea Co., 772 F.2d 1372, 1375 (7th Cir. 1985) (handwritten
addendum to typed charge of race discrimination, also suggesting sex discrimination, sufficient
to permit judicial claim), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1010 (1986). “[I]n assessing the scope of the
EEOC charge, [the Court] may consider [plaintiff’s] statements in a sworn affidavit that she filed
in support of the charge.” W. & S. Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 502 (7th Cir. 1994).
On March 30, 2010, the same day that she filed her second charge, Majors faxed to the
EEOC a single handwritten page and a fax coversheet that raised the issues of overtime and
working Fridays. As her affidavit provides, she intended that these issues be investigated as part
of her charge.

22

H.

GE Engaged in a Continuing Pattern of Illegal Conduct – Its Conduct Prior to
June 3, 2009 Should Be Considered

The continuing violation doctrine permits a plaintiff to pursue alleged discriminatory acts
that occurred outside the statutory period under Title VII. Over time, courts have applied the
continuing violation doctrine in four types of situations:
(a) serial violations, which involve a number of similar discriminatory acts, both before
and during the statutory period;
(b) systemic violations, which involve the continuing policy or practice of discrimination
on a company-wide basis, which policy or practice continues into the statutory
period;
(c) actions involving sub-acts, each of which may be a reasonable starting point for the
limitations period (such as a discharge and the exhaustion of a grievance process
disputing it); and
(d) actions involving the effects of a discriminatory act that occurred outside the statutory
period (i.e., present effects of past discrimination).
The United States Supreme Court does not recognize the application of the continuing violation
doctrine in the third and fourth situations. National Railroad Passenger Corp. (Amtrak) v.
Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002). Morgan also rejects the first situation, at least with respect to
discrete acts of discrimination. It still permits application of the doctrine with respect to serial
hostile environment claims. Morgan left unresolved the issue of whether the continuing violation
doctrine applies to systemic violations. It does not preclude application of continuing violation
doctrine to pattern and practice cases). EEOC v. Dial Corp., 2002 WL 1974072 (N.D. Ill. 2002)

23

Here, GE’s conduct regarding assignment of overtime and Fridays is a pattern and practice.
Therefore, GE’s conduct prior to June 3, 2009 should be considered.

I.

Majors Was Constructively Discharged

GE discriminatorily denied Majors two promotions and the opportunity to work overtime
and Fridays. Over time, this conduct by her employer caused her extreme stress … conditions so
intolerable that she chose to retire early. The most telling fact about her decision being forced is
that she applied for the second PMA position after she elected to retire … she did not want to
leave GE’s employment.

VII.

Conclusion
For the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiff, Renee Majors, by counsel, respectfully requests

proper relief.
