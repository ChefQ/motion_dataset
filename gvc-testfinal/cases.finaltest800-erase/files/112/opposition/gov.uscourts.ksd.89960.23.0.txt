DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO REMAND
Defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company, LLC (“DCBO”) and Cherokee
Basin Pipeline, LLC (“CBPL”) submit this memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff Brandon W.
Owens’s Motion to Remand (Doc. 12). Defendants have established through the Notice of
Removal (Doc. 1) and Plaintiff’s Complaint that diversity jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1332(d) and, accordingly, this matter should remain in the United States District Court
for the District of Kansas. In support, Defendants state the following:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff is a royalty owner alleging that he is being underpaid for royalties from DCBO.
Plaintiff is a Kansas citizen. Both defendants are citizens of other states. The Complaint alleges
that, “Defendants operate over 500 wells in Kansas with one or more royalty owners for each
well.” Complaint, ¶ 15. In addition to himself, Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of similarly
situated individuals. This class, as defined in the Complaint, would include “All royalty owners
who were paid royalties from Dart Cherokee Basin Operating CO., LLC or Cherokee Basin

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 2 of 16

Pipeline, LLC working interest Kansas wells from January 1, 2002 to the date of the Class
Notice.” Complaint, ¶ 12. Plaintiff did not include any information or allegation as to a total
amount of damages sought nor did Plaintiff attempt to limit the damages sought. See generally,
Complaint.
In the Notice of Removal (Doc. 1), Defendants set forth the parties’ diverse citizenship
and facts regarding the unstated amount in controversy based on the facts of Plaintiff’s
Complaint. Defendants set forth with specificity: the class period (over ten years), the number of
wells (at least 700), the allegations regarding the alleged additional royalties owed arising from
purportedly improper deductions, and that DCBO had undertaken initial efforts to quantify what
additional royalties would be owed if the relief sought by Plaintiff was granted. These
calculations, as set forth in the Notice of Removal, demonstrated that the relief sought would
exceed $8.2 million. Notice of Removal, ¶¶ 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This conservative figure
even took into account the likelihood that the class would be unable to recover for the entire
class period despite Plaintiff’s allegations to the contrary.

See Declaration of Charles E.

Henderson, attached hereto as Exhibit A, ¶ 7.
In his Motion to Remand, Plaintiff does not state that he is seeking less than the
jurisdictional amount. Indeed, Plaintiff does not actually address Defendants’ statements about
the amount in controversy but half-heartedly categorizes Defendants’ statements as “a bare
allegation.” As set forth more fully below, Defendants demonstrated with the Notice of Removal
that the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million and no other basis exists for remand.
In additional support, Defendants attach the Declaration of Charles E. Henderson, Exhibit
A, which further outlines the calculations initially conducted, those that now exist based on
limited informal discovery, and the calculations performed by Plaintiff relating to the limited

2

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 3 of 16

discovery. This additional information—all of which may be reviewed by the Court—further
demonstrate that the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. See generally, Exhibit A.
The calculations derived from the limited discovery are especially telling as the
information produced was directly responsive to Plaintiff’s requests. These calculations show
that Plaintiff’s claims for the entire class period far exceed the jurisdictional threshold. Plaintiff
calculates damages of $21.5 million, which includes interest of $7.348 million.

Plaintiff

specifically claims underpaid royalty for the putative class in the amount of $10,427,969.01, a
claim to improperly paid conservation fees totaling $97,816.33, and a claim for unpaid royalties
due to shrinkage in the amount of $3,703,674.13. Without interest, Plaintiff’s claims total
$14,229,459, almost three times the jurisdictional threshold. Exhibit A, at ¶ 10. Moreover, the
parties confirmed to the Court during a status conference on April 30, 2013, that Plaintiff’s
settlement demands did not dip below the $5 million jurisdictional threshold during the course of
mediation.
Plaintiff’s motion to remand should be denied because Defendants have established,
through the Notice of Removal, the face of the Complaint, and through limited discovery, that
the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million.
ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

Standard of Review
Defendants removed this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441 and 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).

Plaintiff alleges that the only defect in the removal lies with the amount in controversy. In
reviewing a motion to remand, the removing party bears the burden in demonstrating that
removal is appropriate. Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F.3d 871, 873 (10th Cir. 1995). Refusing to

3

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 4 of 16

set forth a monetary demand for damages is insufficient to prove that the amount in controversy
cannot be met. McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529 F.3d 947, 955 (10th Cir. 2008).
II.

Defendants Have Established that the Amount In Controversy Exceeds $5 Million
Based on the Notice of Removal and the Face of the Complaint.
In determining the amount in controversy for an action removed pursuant to the Class

Action Fairness Act (“CAFA,” found in 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)), the question is not how much the
plaintiff will recover, but “an estimate of the amount that will be put at issue in the course of the
litigation.” Frederick v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 683 F.3d 1242, 1245 (10th Cir. 2012).
When, as here, the plaintiff does not seek to recover a specified amount of damages, it is
appropriate for the removing party to assert the amount in controversy. 28 U.S.C. § 1446(c)(2).
It is also appropriate for the Court to evaluate the amount in controversy based on the face of the
Complaint. McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529 F.3d 947, 955-56 (10th Cir. 2008)
In Meridian Sec. Ins. Co. v. Sadowski, 441 F.3d 536, 541-42 (7th Cir. 2006), the court set
out what a removing defendant can do to establish the amount in controversy: “We have
suggested several ways in which this may be done—by contentions, interrogatories or
admissions in state court; by calculation from the complaint's allegations; by reference to the
plaintiff's informal estimates or settlement demands; or by introducing evidence, in the form of
affidavits from the defendant's employees or experts, about how much it would cost to satisfy
the plaintiff's demands.” (internal citations omitted).
The Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011 (“JVCA”) amended
28 U.S.C. § 1446 regarding the procedure for removal and, as set forth above, specifically
addresses removal based on diversity jurisdiction. Section 1446(c)(2) states:
2) If removal of a civil action is sought on the basis of the jurisdiction
conferred by section 1332(a), the sum demanded in good faith in the initial
pleading shall be deemed to be the amount in controversy, except that—

4

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 5 of 16

(A) the notice of removal may assert the amount in controversy if the
initial pleading seeks-(i) nonmonetary relief; or
(ii) a money judgment, but the State practice either does not permit
demand for a specific sum or permits recovery of damages in excess of the
amount demanded; and
(B) removal of the action is proper on the basis of an amount in
controversy asserted under subparagraph (A) if the district court finds, by the
preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds the
amount specified in section 1332(a).
In Frederick vs. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 683 F3d. 1242, (10th Cir. 2012) the
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reaffirmed McPhail and extended the rationale to class
actions under CAFA stating:
We join the latter set of courts, and hold that a defendant seeking
to remove under CAFA must show that the amount in controversy
exceeds $5,000,000 by a preponderance of the evidence. In doing
so, we extend our precedent in McPhail to the CAFA context and
align ourselves with the majority of other circuits which have
adopted the preponderance standard. See generally, McPhail, 529
F.3d at 954-55 (explaining the rationale behind the preponderance
standard). Specifically, we agree that there is "no logical reason
why we should demand more from a CAFA defendant" than other
parties invoking federal jurisdiction. Bell, 557 F.3d at 957. This is
especially so in light of the recently passed JVCA, which largely
codified the holding of McPhail. See Pub. L. No. 112-63, 125 Stat.
758 (2011). By adopting the preponderance standard, we ensure
that defendants seeking removal face the same burden regardless
of whether they are invoking simple diversity jurisdiction or
CAFA jurisdiction.

Id. at 1246-47.
In the instant case, the Petition filed in state court contained no allegation as to the
amount in controversy or any claim as to the amount of damages being claimed. Under the
JVCA therefore Defendants were entitled to assert the amount in controversy as part of their
Notice of Removal which they did. The amount so asserted, as can be seen from the facts

5

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 6 of 16

asserted in the Notice of Removal and herein will either be uncontested or is, at a minimum,
sufficient to establish the operative jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at
1248.
Defendant relies on inapplicable cases. In Laughlin, the removing defendant did not set
forth an amount in controversy but incorporated by reference the plaintiff’s demand for relief:
“in excess of $10,000 for each of two claims.” Laughlin, 50 F.3d at 873. Without more in the
notice of removal, the defendant could not establish that the amount in controversy requirement
had been met. Id. Similarly, in Butler v. Target Corp., 2012 WL 5362974 (D. Kan. Oct. 31,
2012), the defendant failed to establish an amount in controversy because the defendant did not
set forth any allegations that the amount in controversy exceeded the sixty-thousand dollar
demand in the plaintiff’s complaint when 28 U.S.C. 1446(c)(2) states that “the sum demanded in
good faith in the initial pleading shall be deemed to be the amount in controversy . . . .”
The allegations of the complaints alone in both McPhail and in Luckett v. Delta Airlines,
Inc., 171 F.3d 295 (5th Cir. 1999) were sufficient for the courts to find that the amount in
controversy exceeded the jurisdictional threshold for diversity jurisdiction. In McPhail, the
plaintiff alleged in the complaint that she was seeking to recover for her husband’s “‘severe
bodily injuries’ which in turn led to ‘permanent and progressive injury’ and his ‘wrongful
death.’” Luckett, 171 F.3d at 957. The plaintiff also incorporated the applicable wrongful death
statute and any relief available under that statute. Id. The statute provided for recovery of
“medical and burial expenses, the loss of consortium and the grief of the surviving spouse, the
mental pain and anguish suffered by the decedent, pecuniary loss based on earning capacity, and
grief and loss of companionship; it also permits an award of punitive damages.” Id. The court
determined that from the complaint alone, that the amount in controversy exceeded the

6

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 7 of 16

jurisdictional amount despite the absence of an allegation as to the amount of recoverable
damages. Id.
In Luckett, the complaint included a demand for damages for “property, travel expenses,
an emergency ambulance trip, a six day stay in the hospital, pain and suffering, humiliation, and
her temporary inability to do housework after the hospitalization.” Luckett, 171 F.3d at 298.
Without more, this alone was sufficient to establish that the amount in controversy threshold had
been met. Id.
Here, because Plaintiff made no monetary demand for damages in the initial Petition,
Defendants set forth in the Notice of Removal the amount of damages they determined were
placed in dispute and claimed by the Plaintiff class, based on the complaint’s allegations and
provided the Court with additional facts supporting their assertion that the amount in controversy
exceeds $5 million. Defendants provided sufficient information in the Notice of Removal,
whether under Meridian, McPhail or the JVCA to demonstrate that the amount in controversy
requirement has been met.
When evaluating the face of Plaintiff’s complaint alone, it is also apparent that the
amount in controversy requirement has been met. Plaintiff alleged class-wide damage for over a
decade for over 500 wells from which royalties for natural gas were underpaid. Similar cases
have been brought with frequency (by Plaintiff’s counsel) in the state and federal courts of
Kansas, with settlements confirmed in amounts frequently exceeding $5 million. See e.g.,
Eatinger v. BP America Production Co., Case No. 07-1266-EFM-KMH pending in the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas, wherein a class settlement was approved that
included a cash payment of $19 million; Hershey v. ExxonMobil Oil Corp., Case No. 07-1300JTM-KMH pending in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, wherein a class

7

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 8 of 16

settlement was approved that included a cash payment of $54 million.

The amount in

controversy has been met as demonstrated by the face of Plaintiff’s complaint alone and
Plaintiff’s counsel has not and cannot in good faith deny that fact to the Court.
III.

Defendants’ Supplemental Information May Be Considered by the Court and
Further Demonstrates that the Jurisdictional Amount Has Been Met.
Plaintiff states in his Motion to Remand that any attempt to supplement the Notice of

Removal would be moot, citing an unpublished district court opinion from Oklahoma. This is
simply not the law. Since filing the original motion to remand, both parties have had an
opportunity to more fully evaluate the amount at issue for the putative class.
In McPhail, the court highlighted the difficulty a defendant faces when a plaintiff fails to
demand a set amount of relief but defendants have an immovable deadline for the time to remove
a matter to federal court. Citing Meridian Security Ins. Co. v. Sadowski, 441 F.3d 536, 540-43
(7th Cir. 2006), the McPhail court identified that in addition to any calculations based on the
complaint’s allegations, a party may reference the plaintiff’s non-numerical allegations and
settlement demands or request use of the discovery process prior to a court ruling on a motion to
remand so that limited discovery may be completed for the purposes of establishing the amount
in controversy. McPhail, 529 F.3d at 954. (“We also note that to the extent that a defendant must
rely on the federal discovery process to produce this evidence . . . he may ask the court to wait to
rule on the remand motion until limited discovery has been completed . . . .”). Here, the parties
received a stay of this case while engaging in early settlement negotiations, which included
limited discovery. This discovery supports the information outlined in the declaration attached
hereto, which confirms that the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million.
McPhail also elaborates on the use of information from settlement discussions for the
limited purposes of establishing the amount in controversy:

8

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 9 of 16

Furthermore, a plaintiff's proposed settlement amount “is relevant evidence of the
amount in controversy if it appears to reflect a reasonable estimate of the
plaintiff's claim.” Cohn v. Petsmart, Inc., 281 F.3d 837, 840 (9th Cir.2002).
Acknowledging that the use of a settlement offer would not be permissible at trial
as evidence to establish “ ‘liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount,’ ”
the Ninth Circuit has held that it is permissible for a district court to consider
settlement offers when deciding the jurisdictional question. Id. at n. 3 (quoting
Fed.R.Evid. 408). We agree. The amount in controversy is not proof of the
amount the plaintiff will recover. Rather, it is an estimate of the amount that will
be put at issue in the course of the litigation. To this end, documents that
demonstrate plaintiff's own estimation of its claim are a proper means of
supporting the allegations in the notice of removal, even though they cannot be
used to support the ultimate amount of liability.
McPhail, 529 F.3d at 956.
Indeed, here, as outlined in the attached Declaration, the calculations prepared by
Plaintiff’s counsel, based on the information requested by Plaintiff to prepare for mediation and
from which Plaintiff’s settlement demands were formulated, show that the amount in controversy
greatly exceeds the jurisdictional threshold. See Exhibit A, ¶¶ 9-10. As part of the mediation
process DCBO agreed to and did provide Plaintiff’s counsel with documentation necessary for
Plaintiff’s counsel to fully analyze the liability and damage issues involved. Plaintiff’s counsel
and/or his expert arrived at a damage figure in excess of $21.5 million, including interest. The
methodology and spreadsheets setting forth this information laid out Plaintiff’s calculation of
damages, including their claim for underpaid royalty of $10,427,969.01 (plus interest of
$5,362,997.22), their Conservation fee claim of $97,816.33 (plus interest of $42,354.30) and
their shrinkage claim of $3,703,674.13 (plus interest of $1,942,726.45). See Declaration of
Charles E. Henderson, Exhibit A). The sum of the claims of the Plaintiff class as computed by
Plaintiff’s counsel, without interest, is $14,229,459, which is within 2% of the back of the
envelope figure stated above.
While these calculations are not proof of what Plaintiff might recover through the course
of this litigation, it does demonstrate Plaintiff’s own estimation of his claims in light of the
9

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 10 of 16

discovery that has occurred about the nature and amount of Plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff estimates
damages of nearly $15 million without interest, three times the jurisdictional requirement.
Counsel confirmed to the Court during status conference that settlement demands at mediation
did not dip below the jurisdictional threshold for CAFA. The amount in controversy in this case
exceeds $5 million. The parties are diverse. This case meets the requirements for this Court to
exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d). Should any remaining doubt exist, the
Court can conduct a hearing under Rule 12(b)(1) at which point the parties can present evidence
regarding the amount in controversy and jurisdiction. See McPhail, 529 F.3d at 954.
IV.

The Court Should Reject Plaintiff’s Unfounded Attempts to Avoid Federal
Jurisdiction.
After setting out in the Notice of Removal the amount in controversy along with the

underlying facts to support this amount, and upon review of the face of the Complaint, it is clear
that the amount in controversy has been met. In McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529 F.3d 947, 955
(10th Cir. 2008), the court explained that “a plaintiff cannot avoid removal merely by declining
to allege the jurisdictional amount.” Declining to allege the jurisdictional amount or otherwise
blurring the jurisdictional amount for the purpose of forum shopping has repeatedly been
rejected by the courts when a plaintiff seeks remand. Plaintiffs are not permitted to avoid federal
jurisdiction while still seeking to recover more than the jurisdictional threshold for diversity
jurisdiction – they simply cannot have it both ways.
Let there be no doubt - that is exactly what Plaintiff’s counsel in this case is trying to do.
This is not Plaintiff’s counsel’s first royalty-owner class action lawsuit. In fact Plaintiff’s counsel
has made somewhat of a cottage industry of bringing class action claims on behalf of oil and gas
royalty interest owners, and has consistently sought to avoid Federal courts. To do so, Plaintiff’s
counsel has set forth contingent damage demands or, as here, refused to set forth any amount as a

10

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 11 of 16

demand. In one such instance Plaintiff’s counsel filed two separate class action lawsuits in the
same Kansas state court against the same defendants alleging different breaches of the same oil
and gas leases on behalf of the same class of royalty owners. In “Eatinger I” (Eatinger v. BP
America Production Co., 524 F. Supp. 2d 1342 (D. Kan. 2007)), the class claims involved an
alleged underpayment of royalties due to “self-dealing”, the use of affiliate pricing to determine
royalties. Id. at 1343. In Eatinger I the Plaintiff’s state court petition stated with respect to the
amount in controversy that:
Plaintiff does not claim individually any damages in excess of
$75,000 (including any damages or attorneys fees, prorated), and
do not make a claim under any federal law. The entire class-wide
damages may be less than $ 5 million.
Id. at 1348.
BP subsequently removed Eatinger I to Federal Court under the Class Action Fairness
Act and diversity jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the above allegation in the Petition, BP did its
own calculation of the damages being sought by the class, based on the claims in the Petition and
indicated in the Notice of Removal that:
[B]ased on plaintiff Eatinger's proposed class definition, [BP] has
calculated the minimum [3] amount of total royalty payments
alleged to be in controversy to be at least $ 693,000,000.
Therefore, unless plaintiff Eatinger is claiming less than a
.7215009% underpayment of royalty on behalf of the proposed
class, the amount in controversy exceeds $ 5,000,000.
Id. at 1344.
In attempting to remand Eatinger I, plaintiff’s counsel “simply pled that the claims
‘may’ be less than the required amount amount-in-controversy.” Id. at 1348. He did not
concretely claim less than the jurisdictional amount and he refused to stipulate to an amount in
controversy below the jurisdictional threshold for the named Plaintiff or for the putative class.
Id. at 1343. In finding remand was improper in Eatinger I, the court noted:

11

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 12 of 16

[I]t appears that plaintiff is now attempting to have it both ways,
in that it would like to remain in state court by pleading an amount
below the requisite amount in controversy individually, while
leaving the door open for the class to seek damages above the
jurisdictional amount. This indecisive and ambiguous language is
not sufficient to close the door to the federal courts.
Id. at 1348.
Some four months after Eatinger I was filed, and while the motion to remand in Eatinger
I was pending, the same counsel who filed Eatinger I (and this case) filed a second class action
claim (“Eatinger II”) in the same Kansas state court on behalf of the same Plaintiff and Plaintiff
class and against the same defendants.

Eatinger v. BP America Production Co., 2008 WL

4163250 (D. Kan. Aug. 26, 2008). Eatinger II involved claims that BP had breached its oil and
gas leases by taking improper deductions, as opposed to the use of affiliate pricing.

The

Petition in Eatinger II replicated the claim in Eatinger I “that class-wide damages for unpaid
royalties “may be less than $5 million.” Id. After the Federal court issued an order denying the
Motion to Remand in Eatinger I Plaintiff’s counsel filed a First Amended Petition in Eatinger II.
The Court identified that the only difference between the original and first amended petition was
that:
Eatinger replaced the “may be less than $5 million” language with:
Class-wide, Plaintiff does not seek or claim, based on presently available
information, any right to recover in excess of $5 million. Should that information
change, Plaintiff, on behalf of the class, will move for leave to amend to seek in
excess of $5 million and consent to removal of this class action under the Class
Action Fairness Act (since there is no 1 year removal time limit on CAFA
diversity removal).

Id. at *1.

Defendant BP removed the second action (as amended) to Federal court and then

moved to consolidate the cases.

Plaintiff’s counsel again sought remand.

The Plaintiff’s

attempts to work around federal jurisdiction were similarly inadequate. Id. Merely stating that

12

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 13 of 16

the plaintiff does not presently seek an amount in excess of the jurisdictional threshold, but will
amend should it decide to do so is not a waiver of any right to recovery nor sufficient to provide
the court with information that the amount in controversy is less than the jurisdictional amount.
Id. at *2. In ruling on the motion to consolidate, the court also noted that the two cases, though
they did contain minor differences, were clearly “closely related, triggering the application of the
single-action rule, which is designed to ‘protect the defendant from the necessity of litigating
similar claims in separate actions.’” Id. at *3 (citing Oxbow Energy v. Koch Industr., 686 F.
Supp. 278, 282 (D. Kan. 1988)). The only rationale the court could discern for bringing two
separate actions initially was the Plaintiff’s “desire to evade both the single-action requirement
and the jurisdictional standards of CAFA.” Id. Indeed, despite Plaintiff’s counsel’s protestations
that the amounts in controversy in both of the Eatinger cases “may” be less than the
jurisdictional amount, the matter settled with a $19 million cash payment.
Plaintiff’s counsel knows exactly how to plead his claim if he wants to preclude removal
to Federal Court and avoid diversity jurisdiction and CAFA, as anyone who reads Eatinger I and
Eatinger II knows. Notwithstanding that, Plaintiff’s counsel did not state in the Petition filed in
this matter that the claims involved were less than the jurisdictional threshold for diversity and
CAFA, or even that the claims “may be” less than that amount. As the Court noted in Eatinger
II:
Certainly, as Eatinger stresses, the plaintiff is the "master" of his
complaint. Brill v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 427 F.3d 446,
449 (7th Cir. 2005). But, where he uses that mastery to create mere
ambiguity and evasion, he cannot be heard to complain too loudly.
The court has previously noted, in Eatinger I, that the plaintiff's
"indecisive and ambiguous language is not sufficient to close the
door to the federal courts."

Id. at *2.

13

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 14 of 16

Here, Plaintiff’s counsel has simply refused to state the amount in controversy in the
Petition in an effort to avoid federal jurisdiction, and then in response to the Removal Notice has
not attempted to stipulate or state that the damages sought by the Plaintiff class are below the
jurisdictional threshold, or to provide any calculation to the Court to establish that his damage
claim is in fact below the jurisdictional limit, but rather he has only argued that Defendants have
not done enough to establish the amount in controversy.
As set forth above, the Notice of Removal and the face of the Complaint demonstrate that
the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. Faced with a Petition that contained no damage
amount the Defendants were placed in a position of trying to determine what Plaintiff was
seeking to recover. Based upon the allegations of the Petition it was possible to come up with a
preliminary, “back of the envelope” damage analysis using total royalties paid, adjusting for the
applicable contract rate, and further adjusting for the lost shrinkage amount. That analysis
generated a damage figure of more than $14.5 million. See Declaration of Charles E. Henderson,
Exhibit A, ¶¶5-6. Defendants continued to gather data and did a formal economic analysis of the
damage claim. This analysis (id. at Exhibit A thereto) determined that the damages claimed by
Plaintiff class amounted to $11,866,260.25. If those “damages” which occurred outside of the
five-year period before the date of the filing of the Plaintiff’s Petition are excluded the total
damages claimed by Plaintiff class would be $8,224,798.62. Id. In the Notice of Removal,
Defendants alleged that the damages claimed were “at least $8.2 million”. This was not a
number that was pulled out of thin air, it was in fact a very conservative number based on the
analysis shown above.
The Notice of Removal and the statement contained therein that the amount in
controversy is “at least $8.2 million” alone clearly satisfies the requirement for removal

14

Case 5:12-cv-04157-JAR-JPO Document 23 Filed 05/01/13 Page 15 of 16

jurisdiction. In McPhail, the 10th Circuit acknowledged that a defendant may “rely on an
estimate of the potential damages from the allegations in the complaint” alone to establish
federal jurisdiction. McPhail, 529 F.3d at 956.
As noted in Section III, supra, the amount in controversy requirement can also be
satisfied “by reference to plaintiff’s informal estimates or settlement demands.” Id. at 954. Such
a rule is consistent with not allowing Plaintiff’s counsel to “have it both ways” as the judge noted
in Eatinger I. 524 F. Supp. 2d at 1348. Here Plaintiff’s counsel’s own damage calculations
show in reality the amount in dispute is almost $15 million.
CONCLUSION
The initial notice of removal and a review of the face of the Complaint, coupled with the
discovery conducted since the start of this suit, are more than sufficient to meet the removal
requirements. As the McPhail court stated, once the facts supporting federal jurisdiction are
presented the case will remain in federal court unless it is legally certain that less than the
jurisdictional amount is in controversy. 529 F.3d at 954. Plaintiff’s counsel’s attempts to avoid
federal jurisdiction should be rejected. The facts set forth herein and the attachments hereto
clearly meet the requirements of McPhail. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant
