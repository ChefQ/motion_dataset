Case No. 12-CV-04157

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO REMAND
Plaintiff Brandon W. Owens, individually and on behalf of the proposed plaintiff class,
moves to remand this royalty owners class action for underpayment of royalties to state court.
The Defendants removed the case from state court claiming diversity jurisdiction under Class
Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. §1332(d), and under the procedures governing removal in 28
U.S.C. §1441. But Defendants have failed to demonstrate by competent evidence that the
required amount in controversy has been met. Absent a showing in accordance with the law, this
case should be remanded to state court.
Plaintiff incorporates his contemporaneously filed memorandum in support of this
motion.
Respectfully submitted,
