UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
Case No. 06-CR-320

v.
DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS STATEMENT AND FRUITS
DERIVED THEREFROM AND REQUEST
FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING
David R. Olofson, by counsel, asks this Court to suppress the statement
he provided law enforcement on July 19, 2006, and any fruits derived from that
statement. Olofson also asks for an evidentiary hearing on this issue.
The facts are as follows. On July 19, ATF agents and the Berlin Police
Department executed a search warrant at Olofson’s residence in Berlin. While the
search warrant was executed, Olofson was transferred to the Berlin Police
Department and gave a statement. He was not advised of his Miranda rights before
he made the statement. Law enforcement states that Olofson was told he was not
under arrest and that he was free to leave. Olofson states that he was told he could
not leave the police station until the search concluded. Olofson’s statements could

be considered incriminating because he expressed a familiarity with how to
transform a semi-automatic firearm into a “machine gun.” Olofson is charged with
transferring a “machine gun.”
Olfoson requests an evidentiary hearing with respect to this motion to
suppress. Pursuant to C RIMINAL L OCAL R ULE 12.3, defense counsel contacted the
government regarding the need for an evidentiary hearing. The government agrees
that a hearing is needed to determine the following mixed factual and legal dispute:
1.

Whether Olofson was subjected to “custodial interrogation”

when he made the statement to law enforcement on July 19, 2006.
Defense counsel estimates that an evidentiary hearing will consume no
more than one to two hours of the Court’s time. Pursuant to C RIMINAL L OCAL
R ULE 12.2, no supporting memorandum of law will be filed at this time. Olfoson,
however, reserves the right to file a memorandum of law following the evidentiary
hearing. This motion supersedes his “Fifth Motion to Suppress Evidence and Allow
Late Filing,” which was filed on March 13, 2007.
