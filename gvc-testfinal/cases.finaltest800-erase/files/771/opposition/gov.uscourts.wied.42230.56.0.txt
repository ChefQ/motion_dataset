Case No. 06-CR-320

DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

GOVERNMENT’S POST-HEARING BRIEF RE:
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS STATEMENTS

I. Background
On December 5, 2006, a federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment charging
David R. Olofson with knowingly transferring a machinegun in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
922(o). Olofson has filed a motion to suppress statements that he made to law enforcement
officials. For the reasons set forth below, the government asks the Court to recommend that
Olofson’s motion be denied.
II. Facts
On July 19, 2006, a combination of federal and local law enforcement agents executed
a search warrant at David Olofson’s residence. Tr. 6. Among those participating in the
execution of the search warrant were Special Agent Jody Keeku from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (“ATF”) and Officer Georgia Trochinski from the Berlin
1

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 06/15/07 Page 1 of 7 Document 56

Police Department. Tr. 6-7, 28.
When they arrived at Olofson’s residence to execute the warrant, a number of law
enforcement personnel knocked on the door of the residence. Tr. 7-8. Olofson answered the
door and was told that the agents had a search warrant. Tr. 8. Olofson then was temporarily
handcuffed and placed in the back of a squad car. Tr. 8-9. After approximately fifteen
minutes, Agent Keeku approached Olofson. Tr. 9. She told him that he was not under arrest,
but that he could not enter the residence while the search was being conducted. Tr. 10. After
telling Olofson that he was not under arrest, Agent Keeku asked him whether he would
accompany her to the police station to speak with law enforcement. Tr. 10-11. Olofson
responded that he would. Tr. 11.
Before accompanying the agents to the police station, Olofson made arrangements for
someone to watch his children. Tr. 11-13. The agents had removed the handcuffs from
Olofson by this point. Tr. 12. He called his wife to discuss the situation with her, and he
ultimately asked a friend of his to watch the children until his wife came home. Tr. 12-13.
Olofson signed a statement acknowledging that he wanted his friend to watch the children
until his wife arrived. Tr. 12; Ex. 3.
Agent Keeku and Officer Trochinski drove Olofson the approximately five blocks to
the police station. He sat – without handcuffs – in the backseat of the car along with Agent
Keeku, while Officer Trochinski drove. Tr. 13. Once at the station, Olofson and the two
agents went to Officer Trochinski’s office. The office was approximately 8 feet by 10 feet.

The agents both sat behind desks, while Olofson sat near the office’s door. Tr. 14, 29. Upon
entering the office, Agent Keeku reiterated that Olofson was not under arrest and that he was
free to leave at any time. Tr. 14, 32. Olofson indicated that he understood and that he wanted
to stay and answer the agents’ questions. Tr. 14.
Agent Keeku and Officer Trochinski then began questioning Olofson regarding the
firearms offense that was the subject of the search warrant.

Tr. 15.

Olofson spent

approximately three hours with Agent Keeku and Officer Trochinski at the police station. Not
all of that time, however, was spent answering the agents’ questions. Tr. 15, 29, 31. Much
of it was spent “passing time while the search warrant was being executed” – Olofson was not
able to return to his residence while the warrant was being executed. Tr. 15, 23, 31. And
Olofson was allowed to leave Officer Trochinski’s office to use the bathroom. Tr. 16, 29-30.
At no time during his stay at the police station did Olofson ever indicate that he no
longer wished to answer questions; at no time did he indicate that he wanted to speak with an
attorney; and at no time did he ask whether he could leave. Tr. 16, 32. Olofson seemed
comfortable and at ease during the interview. Tr. 31.

III. Analysis
At no time was Olofson advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436
(1966). Miranda warnings need only be provided, however, prior to custodial interrogation.
Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977).

“Custodial interrogation” means

“questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody
or otherwise deprived of his freedom in a significant way.” Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444. A
person must therefore be both in custody and subjected to interrogation to trigger the Miranda
protections.
The government concedes that Olofson was being “interrogated” when he provided his
statement to law enforcement. The agents’ questions regarding Olofson’s transfer of a
machinegun and regarding his knowledge of the process of converting a firearm to a
machinegun clearly were intended to elicit potentially incriminating responses from Olofson.
See Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300-01 (1980). The issue in dispute is whether
Olofson was in custody when he was questioned. Based on the analysis that follows, he was
not.
In determining whether Olofson was in custody, the Court must determine whether his
freedom of movement was restrained to a degree comparable to formal arrest. United States
v. Salyers, 160 F.3d 1152, 1159 (7 th Cir. 1998). That assessment is, in turn, guided by several
factors: (1) whether the encounter occurred in a public place; (2) whether the defendant
consented to speak with the officers; (3) whether the officers informed the defendant that he

4

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 06/15/07 Page 4 of 7 Document 56

was not under arrest and was free to leave; (4) whether the defendant was moved to another
area; (5) whether there was a threatening presence of several officers and a display of
weapons or physical force; (6) whether the officers deprived the defendant of documents that
he needed continue on his way; and (7) the officers’ demeanor. United States v. Scheets, 188
F.3d 829, 836-37 (7 th Cir. 1999). The defendant bears the burden of proving custody. United
States v. Charles, 738 F.2d 686, 692 (5th Cir.1984); United States v. Suchit, 480 F. Supp. 2d 39,
53 (D.C. Cir. 2007).
The questioning of Olofson did take place in a police station, which obviously is not
as familiar or comfortable a setting as is a his home. But questioning in an arguably coercive
environment does not necessarily mean that a defendant is in custody. Oregon v. Mathiason,
429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977)(“Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because
the questioning takes place in the station house . . . .”); United States v. Wyatt, 179 F.3d 532,
535 (7 th Cir. 1999). Olofson voluntarily went to the police station with Agent Keeku and
Officer Trochinski after specifically being advised that he was not under arrest and that he did
not have to go with them. Cf. United States v. Jones, 21 F.3d 165, 170 (7 th Cir. 1994); Mason
v. Mitchell, 320 F.3d 604, 631 (6 th Cir. 2003)(holding that Miranda warnings were not
required when officers had transported a suspect to the police station for questioning – the
suspect had voluntarily accompanied the officers to the station and was told that he was free
to leave).
Agent Keeku again told Olofson that he was free to leave once he arrived at the station.

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 06/15/07 Page 5 of 7 Document 56

After being so advised, Olofson consented to speak with the officers. At no time during the
questioning did Olofson indicate that he no longer wished to answer questions or that he
wanted to speak with a lawyer. Nor did Olofson ever ask to leave the police station. Only
two officers were present during the questioning, and neither of them at any time displayed
their firearms. The questioning took place not in a holding cell, but in an office to which the
door was at times open. Olofson was allowed to use the bathroom, unaccompanied and
unmonitored.1
The picture that the evidentiary hearing testimony painted was of a calm interview,
during which Olofson appeared “comfortable”, “at ease”, and even “smug.” 2 Olofson was not
subject to a restraint of freedom closely approximating the conditions of a formal arrest.
Because he was not “in custody,” there was no need for law enforcement agents to provide
Miranda warnings.

1

This may seem a small concession to a suspect, but it does represent a form of freedom
from arrest-like restraint of movement. Cf. United States v. Calimlim, (No. 04-CR-248) 2005
WL 2922193, at *30 (E.D. Wis. Nov. 4, 2005).
2

When he testified, Olofson did not quarrel with the law enforcement agents’ depiction of
the interview. Indeed, his testimony did not address at all the circumstances preceding and
during his questioning. Olofson did not dispute that he voluntarily accompanied the agents to the
police station and consented to speak with them; he did not dispute that he was told that he was
not under arrest and that he was free to leave; he did not contend that Agent Keeku or Officer
Trochinski displayed their weapons or used physical force during the interview. Olofson offered
no testimony that the environment at the police station was coercive. Instead, in an effort to carry
his burden of proving custody, Olofson testified simply that he was driven – as opposed to
having walked – back to his residence at the conclusion of his interview.
