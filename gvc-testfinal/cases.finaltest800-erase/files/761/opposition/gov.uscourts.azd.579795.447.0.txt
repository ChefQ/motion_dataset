Case No. CR 11-0187-TUC LAB
DEFENDANT’S OBJECTIONS
TO THE PRODUCTION OF
PSYCHOLOGIST NOTES TO
THE PROSECUTION

For the reasons stated below, the defense objects to the government’s July 17, 2012,
Motion for Production of Psychologist’s “Personal Notes.”
BACKGROUND

24

Mr. Loughner is currently committed to MCFP Springfield (“Springfield”) for restoration

25

of competency under 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d)(2), where he is being treated by BOP psychologist

26

Dr. Christina Pietz. In addition to the treatment notes in Mr. Loughner’s file maintained by the

27

Springfield facility, Dr. Pietz keeps a set of “personal notes” about her clinical interactions with

28

1

him. The government has previously sought, and the Court has ordered, production of these

2

notes over defense objection.

3

The government now seeks production of Dr. Pietz’s personal notes from February 8 to

4

June 7, 2012. See Doc. 446. The defense is concerned that production of the notes may result

5

in their adverse use against Mr. Loughner in the government’s decision whether to seek the death

6

penalty, in contravention of the Court’s previous rulings. See Amended Order Denying Motion

7

to Reconsider (Doc.175); Transcript of Feb. 6, 2012 hearing at 14-15. The defense makes the

8

following objections.
OBJECTIONS

9
10

A.

Disclosure of the notes are improper for the reasons raised in previous motions

11

The defense hereby incorporates by reference the objections made in the motions

12

concerning the disclosure to the government of Dr. Pietz’s personal notes. See Def. Obj. to the

13

Production of Psychologist Notes to the Prosecution (Doc. 401); Def. Mtn to Reconsider Order

14

Overruling Objections (Doc. 408).

15

B.

Use of the notes in the death decision violates due process

16

The government’s use of Dr. Pietz’s personal notes in its decision about whether to seek

17

the death penalty presents additional concerns. This is true because Mr. Loughner’s participation

18

in treatment has been undertaken under the terms set forth by this Court, which included explicit

19

limitations on the use of evidence created in the competency process.

20

In its previous rulings, this Court has been careful to narrowly limit the scope of

21

permissible uses of the fruits of the evaluation and restoration process. In its March 24 order,

22

the Court ruled:

23
24
25
26

28

[T]he Court doesn’t need to restrict the Government’s use of the clinical
interview recordings because the law already does. If the defendant is found
competent to stand trial, 18 U.S.C. § 4241(f) forbids the use of that finding against
him at trial. In the statute’s words, such a finding “shall not prejudice the
defendant in raising the issue of his insanity as a defense to the offense charged,
and shall not be admissible as evidence in a trial for the offense charged.”
Moreover, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2(c)(4) also provides that no
statement made by the defendant in the course of a competency exam, and no
other fruits of the statement, may be admitted into evidence against the defendant,
unless he relies on an insanity defense at trial or introduces expert evidence
regarding his mental state in a capital sentencing hearing. See Fed. R. Crim. P.
2

Case 4:11-cr-00187-LABU Document 447 Filed 07/18/12 Page 3 of 5

12(c)(4)(A)(B). In combination, these provisions protect the defendant from the
adverse use of what he says to an examiner during a clinical interview.

As the defense notes, Estelle v. Smith prohibits the content of a
competency examination from being used for a “much broader objective” than
determining competency to stand trial, and explicitly cautions against uses that
are “adverse” to the subject. 451 U.S. 464, 465 (1981). Estelle sustained Fifth
and Sixth Amendment challenges to a psychiatrist’s testimony in the sentencing
phase of a capital case based on that psychiatrist’s pre-trial examination of the
defendant to determine competency. But Estelle explicitly said “no Fifth
Amendment issue . . . arises” if the examiner’s function is limited to assessing a
defendant’s competency.

March 24, 2011 Order at 3-4 (Doc. 175) (emphases added). More recently, in the last round of

9

litigation about disclosure of the Dr. Pietz’s personal notes, the Court referenced its earlier

10
11

rulings in discouraging the government from seeking disclosure:
We had early-on litigation about what the scope of discussions could be and what
would be admissible. I’ve made earlier rulings on that.

. . . Of course, that was the subject of a number of motions that were made early
on in this case. I tried to accommodate that in the orders by assuring defense
counsel that theses would be subject to privilege and that they wouldn’t be
affirmatively admissible, if at all. . . . But . . . if you want all of it, I’d be inclined
to give it to both counsel mindful that I’ve issued orders of the scope of use that
can be made here. It’s very, very limited. He’s talking to her for the purposes of
treatment. It’s privileged to that extent.

Transcript of Feb. 6, 2012 hearing at 13-15 (emphasis added).

19

Significantly, the Court’s assurances about the limited use of compelled statements were

20

made before the latest restoration period (February 8 to June 7) for which the government seeks

21

Dr. Pietz’s notes. Indeed, the Court advised that disclosures during those sessions would be

22

“protect[ed] . . . from . . . adverse use,” that Mr. Loughner’s participation was “for the purposes

23

of treatment” only, and that his statements were subject to a “very, very limited” scope of

24

use—which certainly does not encompass the death decision. The decision whether to seek the

25

death penalty is plainly an “adverse use” that should be barred by the Court’s rulings.

26

Under Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976), and Johnson v. United States, 318 U.S. 189

27

(1943), it is “fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process” to assure a defendant that a

28

particular course of action (remaining silent in Doyle and Johnson, participating in treatment

here) “will carry no penalty” and then to turn around and allow the prosecution to use that action

2

against him. See Doyle, 426 U.S. at 618-19 & n.9; Johnson, 318 U.S. at 196-97. Particularly

3

when the assurances provided have been made by a court, the Supreme Court has termed this to

4

be a species of “entrap[ment].” See Johnson, 318 U.S. at 197 (“An accused having the assurance

5

of the court that his claim of privilege would be granted might well be entrapped if his assertion

6

of the privilege could then be used against him.”). This case is no different. It would be

7

fundamentally unfair to inform Mr. Loughner that any statements he might make to Dr. Pietz

8

were protected from “adverse” use, only to allow those statements to be used against him by the

9

government in its death penalty decision.

10

It is true that the Court has stated that the government “may have a very legitimate interest

11

in Dr. Pietz’s notes to the extent they inform its decision whether to ultimately pursue the death

12

penalty in this case or engage in plea negotiations.” See Feb. 16, 2012 Order at 5 (Doc. 407);

13

see also Feb. 27, 2012 Order at 3 (Doc. 409) (same). Those remarks, however, addressed a

14

different issue—whether the government's interest in the notes was ripe. The defense argued

15

that the government's interest in using the notes for trial and sentencing litigation was premature.

16

It was in the context of addressing that argument that the Court suggested that the government

17

"may have" a legitimate interest in considering the notes in its death penalty authorization

18

process. In other words, the Court offered the death penalty decision as a presently existing

19

purpose to which the notes might be relevant; it did not explicitly decide whether their use for

20

that purpose was in fact consistent with the Fifth Amendment. Indeed, it had no reason to decide

21

the second question because the issue of adverse use in the death penalty decision had not been

22

raised by the government. Thus, these remarks could not fairly be construed as a Fifth

23

Amendment ruling, especially since such an interpretation would contravene the Court's actual

24

Fifth Amendment ruling prohibiting adverse use under Estelle.

25

In any event, such use of compelled statements would violate both this Court’s basic

26

approach, as described above, as well as the limitation of their use to competency proceedings

27

as set forth in Estelle, the case cited and relied on by the Court’s order. See March 24, 2011

28

Order at 4.

The notion that statements made under the rubric of a mental-healthcare

1

relationship—in the course of court-ordered treatment—could be used to justify a decision to

2

seek the death penalty offends basic notions of fairness.

3

CONCLUSION

4

The Court should deny the government’s motion. In the alternative, the court should limit

5

the government’s use of the notes to exclude consideration in the course of the death penalty

6

decision.
