Jared Lee Loughner,
(Defense Objects)
Defendant.

16

Now comes the United States of America, by and through its attorneys undersigned and

17

hereby moves for production of Dr. Christina Pietz’s “personal notes” made during the

18

competency period ending June 7, 2012, and in support states as follows:

19

1. The Court previously authorized Bureau of Prisons (BOP) psychologist, Dr. Christina

20

Pietz, to maintain what have been referred to as “personal notes,” in the course of her

21

competency evaluations of the defendant, and not produce those notes until the expiration

22

of the current competency period. (RT 9/28/11, p. 60-61; Doc. 376, 11/22/11 Order, p. 3.)

23

2. At the extension of commitment hearing on February 6, 2012, the government orally

24

moved for production of Dr. Pietz’s personal notes for the competency period ending

25

February 8, 2012. (RT 9/28/11, pp. 12-17.) Defense objected. (RT 9/28/11, pp. 12-17; Doc.

26

401.) The Court granted disclosure of the notes to both parties, and further ordered “pages

27

containing copies of Dr. Pietz’s notes from conversations with defense counsel will be

3. The defendant’s next competency period began February 8, 2012, ended on June 7,
2012. (Doc. 399, 2/8/12 Order Extending Commitment.)

4. The government hereby moves for disclosure of Dr. Pietz’s personal notes for the

6

competency period that concluded on June 7, 2012. The government requests disclosure to

7

both parties under the terms set forth in this Court’s previous orders (Docs. 407 and 409), in

8

that Dr. Pietz’s notes from her conversations with defense counsel be redacted from the

9

government’s copy.

10

5. The parties have conferred regarding this motion. The defense objects to the

11

government receiving Dr. Pietz's personal notes, and will today file its objection to release

12

of the notes at this time. The parties agree the Court may rule based on the pleadings;

13

however both parties can make themselves available for a telephonic hearing at the

14

convenience of the Court.

15

WHEREFORE, the government respectfully moves this Court to enter an order, over

16

defense objection, requiring the Bureau of Prisons to produce to the government and defense

17

counsel Dr. Pietz’s personal notes for the competency period that concluded on June 7, 2012.

18

Based on the agreement of the parties, the pages containing Dr. Pietz’s notes of conversations

19

with defense counsel will be redacted from the government’s disclosure.

20

Respectfully submitted this 17 th day of July, 2012.
