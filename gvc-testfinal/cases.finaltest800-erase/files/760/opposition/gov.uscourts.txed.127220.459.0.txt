GEOTAG, INC.’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS AT&T SERVICES, INC. AND AT&T
MOBILITY LLC’S MOTION TO SEVER AND TRANSFER
Plaintiff GeoTag, Inc. (“GeoTag”) files this Response to the Motion to Sever and
Transfer filed by Defendants AT&T Services, Inc. (“AT&T Services”) and AT&T Mobility,
LLC (“AT&T Mobility”) (collectively, “AT&T”) (Dkt. No. 444).
I.

INTRODUCTION
AT&T seeks a severance of GeoTag’s claims against it and then a transfer of the severed
action to the Northern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). GeoTag does not
oppose the severance of its claims against AT&T on the condition that GeoTag’s claims against
AT&T are consolidated for pretrial purposes under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure with the other co-pending lawsuits brought by GeoTag in this Court involving the
same patent and issues.
AT&T’s motion to transfer, however, should be denied. First and foremost, transferring
GeoTag’s claims against AT&T to the Northern District of Texas would create the existence of
multiple lawsuits in different forums involving the same issues resulting in wasteful and
duplicative litigation increasing the parties’ costs and time spent contrary to the interests of
justice and judicial economy. Furthermore, AT&T has not specifically identified any documents

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 2 of 15 PageID #: 6915

or employees located in the proposed transferee forum, only a speculation of two possible prior
art witnesses whom may reside within the Northern District. On the other hand, GeoTag has
explicitly identified documents and several witnesses by name that are located in the Eastern
District of Texas. As such, AT&T has not satisfied its heavy burden of showing that the
transferee venue is clearly more convenient than the Eastern District of Texas.

BACKGROUND
A.

Background of the GeoTag Litigation.

GeoTag’s patent infringement claims against AT&T concern a single patent – U.S. Patent
No. 5,930,474 (the “’474 patent”) – and is among the patent infringement claims GeoTag has
asserted against several hundred defendants in 19 lawsuits pending in this Court (the “GeoTag
Litigations”). The `474 patent relates generally to the organization of geographical search
technology made available through the Internet and its functionality, such as online yellow
pages, “store locator” and job locator technology found on many websites and mobile
applications.
The GeoTag Texas Litigations commenced in July 2010, when GeoTag filed suit against
14 defendants in a case styled GeoTag Inc. v. Frontier Communications Corp., et al., No. 2:10cv-00265, and Yellowpages.com LLC in a case styled GeoTag Inc. v. Yellowpages.com LLC,
No. 2:10-cv-00272. Since December 2010, GeoTag has filed 16 additional lawsuits against
infringers of the ’474 patent. GeoTag asserted claims of patent infringement against AT&T
Services and AT&T Mobility in GeoTag Inc. v. Yellowpages.com LLC and in GeoTag Inc. v.
Aromatique, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:10-cv-570, respectively.1 All of the lawsuits comprising the
GeoTag Litigations have been assigned to this Court since February 23, 2012.
1

In March 2011, GeoTag filed a lawsuit against a vendor of store locator technology – Where 2 Get It, Inc. – after
Where2GetIt filed a declaratory judgment action in Delaware while engaged in settlement discussions with GeoTag.
The Delaware court subsequently transferred the Where2GetIt declaratory judgment action to this Court.

Background of Plaintiff GeoTag.

GeoTag is a provider of patented online and mobile applications focused around
geolocation technology. GeoTag’s technology is based on fundamental inventions described in
the ’474 Patent.

The patented GeoTag technology is a spatial information management

technology that makes possible a wide range of location enabled online and mobile applications.
GeoTag’s location based technology is used in web and mobile applications such as yellow
pages, classifieds, search and advertising, dating sites, career locators, product locators, store
locators, dealer locators, job search sites, dating search sites, event locators, daily deals and
coupons, in store availability, in store pick-up and other applications. GeoTag offers companies
providing these online and mobile applications the opportunity to license the GeoTag
technology. See Ex. 1 - Declaration of John Veenstra at ¶ 3.
GeoTag is the owner of the ’474 Patent. GeoTag is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Texas with its headquarters and principal place of business located at 2591 Dallas
Parkway, Suite 505, Frisco, Texas, located in the Eastern District of Texas. Veenstra Declaration
at ¶ 4. GeoTag and its predecessors involved in the licensing and enforcement of the ’474 patent
have been located in the Eastern District of Texas since 2007. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 5.
GeoTag’s executive management consists of John Veenstra as Chief Executive Officer
and Lawrence P. Howorth as President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Veenstra has resided in
Plano, Texas, located in the Eastern District of Texas, since 2007. Mr. Howorth also resides in
Plano, Texas, located in the Eastern District of Texas. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 6.
Substantially all of GeoTag’s business activities, including meetings of GeoTag's Board
of Directors, take place in the Eastern District of Texas. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 7. GeoTag

contracts with support services primarily in Texas rather than hiring full time employees
depending on the particular requirements. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 8. GeoTag has employed
and continues to employ several independent contractors in connection with its business.
GeoTag currently employs at least five full time independent contractors at GeoTag’s Frisco,
Texas headquarters. At certain times, depending on workload, GeoTag has employed from 6 to
12 full time independent contractors at its headquarters in the Frisco, Texas. Veenstra
Declaration at ¶ 8.
GeoTag has hundreds of thousands of pages of physical and electronic documents
relating to the ’474 patent located at its Frisco, Texas headquarters. These documents include
documents relating to the conception, reduction to practice, patent prosecution, licensing and
enforcement of the ’474 patent. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 9.
GeoTag and its predecessors have developed and marketed a fully functioning yellow
pages website called Zland Yellow Pages, which is currently operated from GeoTag’s
headquarters in Frisco, Texas, and employs the technology covered by the `474 patent. ZLAND
Yellow Pages provides directory listing services and advertising to Texas businesses,
organizations, local governments, community event organizers, churches, schools and
universities. While GeoTag operates on a multiple server platform, GeoTag’s primary server is
located in Dallas, TX. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 10.
C.

Background of Defendant AT&T.

Defendant AT&T is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters located at 208 S. Akard
St., Dallas, Texas, 75202. AT&T conducts business through two primary sales channels: (1) its
retail Stores, and (2) Direct. According to its own “retail facts” sheet, AT&T operates 16,000
retail locations in the U.S., including kiosks, authorized dealers, third party retail locations

4

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 6918

including 2,200 company-owned stores.2 Many of these stores, and its corporate headquarters,
are located in Texas. In fact, a search for stores (using the accused store locator) near Allen, TX
in the Eastern District of Texas shows that there are more locations nearby than near Dallas, TX.
See Ex. 2- Moore Declaration at ¶3, Exs. B & C. Furthermore, AT&T’s servers which host the
store locator functionalities are located in the Eastern District of Texas in Allen, TX as well as
locations in the State of Washington. Moore Declaration at ¶2, Ex. A

ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standard

Section 1404(a) provides that “[f]or the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the
interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division
where it might have been brought.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). The goals of § 1404(a) are to prevent
waste of time, energy, and money, and also to protect litigants, witnesses, and the public against
unnecessary inconvenience and expense. Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 616 (1964).
Ultimately it is within a district court’s sound discretion to transfer venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1404(a), but the court must exercise its discretion in light of the particular circumstances of the
case. Hanby v. Shell Oil Co., 144 F. Supp. 2d 673, 676 (E.D. Tex. 2001); Mohamed v. Mazda
Corp., 90 F. Supp. 2d 757, 768 (E.D. Tex. 2000).
Although the plaintiff’s choice of forum is not a factor in the convenience analysis, it
contributes to the defendant’s burden of showing that the transferee venue is clearly more
convenient. In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 314-15 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (“Volkswagen
II”).

The plaintiff’s choice of venue should rarely be disturbed unless the balance of

convenience factors is strongly in favor of the defendants. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315; Gulf
Oil v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 507 (1947); see also In re Affymetrix, Inc., Misc. No. 913, 2010 WL

1525010, at *1 (Fed. Cir. April 13, 2010) (citing In re Nat’l Presto Indus., Inc., 347 F.3d 662,
663-64) (“[F]or transfer of venue to be appropriate, [defendant] must make a clear and
indisputable showing that on balance, the convenience and interest of justice considerations
strongly favor transfer.”). Therefore, transfer is not appropriate unless the movant demonstrates
good cause by showing that the transferee venue is clearly more convenient. Volkswagen II, 545
F.3d at 315; Lake Cherokee Hard Drive Techs., LLC v. Bass Computers, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-216,
2012 WL 462956, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 13, 2012). When deciding whether to transfer venue, a
district court balances the private interests of the parties and the public interests in the fair and
efficient administration of justice. The private interest factors the court considers are: (1) the
relative ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of compulsory process to secure
the attendance of witnesses; (3) the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other
practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious, and inexpensive. In re Volkswagen
AG, 371 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004) (“Volkswagen I”). The public interest factors are: (1) the
administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local interest in having
localized interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern
the case; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflict laws or in the application of
foreign law. Id.
B.

Whether the Lawsuit Could be Brought in the Transferee Venue

One threshold issue in a § 1404(a) analysis is “whether the judicial district to which transfer
is sought would have been a district in which the claim could have been filed.” Volkswagen I,
371 F.3d at 203. GeoTag does not dispute that its claims against AT&T could have been brought
in the Northern District of Texas.

1.

Filed 07/26/12 Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 6920

The Relative Ease of Access to Sources of Proof

The Court must consider the physical location and volume of documents possessed by
each party in relation to the transferee and transferor venues. See Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at
314-15; In re Nintendo Co. Ltd., 589 F.3d 1194, 1199 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Despite technological
advances that certainly lighten the relative inconvenience of transporting large amounts of
documents across the country, this factor is still a part of the transfer analysis. In re Volkswagen
II, 545 F.3d at 316. Courts analyze this factor in light of the distance that documents, or other
evidence, must be transported from their existing location to the trial venue. See In re
Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316. This factor will turn upon which party, usually the accused
infringer, will most probably have the greater volume of documents relevant to the litigation and
their presumed location in relation to the transferee and transferor venues. See, e.g., In re
Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 314-15; In re Nintendo, 589 F.3d at 1199; In re Genentech, 566 F.3d
at 1345.
In its motion, AT&T argues that “AT&T is not aware of any AT&T or third-party
documents in the Eastern District of Texas,” Dkt. No. 444 at 5. However, AT&T’s answers to
GeoTag’s venue-related interrogatories tell a different story. Moore Declaration at ¶2, Ex. A. In
its interrogatory responses, AT&T concedes that its servers, which host the accused store locator
functionality, are not located in the Northern District of Texas. Moore Declaration at ¶2, Ex. A
at 4. The servers containing the relevant accused instrumentality are stored in Allen, Texas, as
well as in Bothell, Washington, and Lynwood, Washington. Id. Tellingly, in its motion, AT&T
neglects to disclose that its servers which host the store locator functionality are located in the
Eastern District of Texas.
Although AT&T has asserted that its offices are located in the proposed transferee forum

7

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 6921

– the Northern District of Texas – it has not submitted any evidence that any appreciable number
of documents are actually located at those offices. AT&T blanketly asserts that “the lawyer
overseeing the collection of evidence for AT&T works there,” and that “collecting and preparing
evidence for trial would [] be easier in Dallas than in Tyler.” Dkt No. 444 at 5. This vague and
general statement amounts to, at best, a minimal showing that any documents relevant to this
case are located at AT&T’s headquarters in Dallas. It is more likely that the most relevant proof
for infringement will be found from the servers which host the accused instrumentality, the store
locator, which are located in Allen, Texas and in Washington.
On the other hand, GeoTag, has shown that it has over hundreds of thousands of pages of
physical and electronic documents located at its headquarters in the Eastern District of Texas.
Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 9. GeoTag is incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas with its
headquarters and principal place of business located in the Eastern District of Texas. Veenstra
Declaration at ¶ 4. GeoTag and its predecessors involved in the licensing and enforcement of the
’474 patent have been located in the Eastern District of Texas since 2007. Veenstra Declaration
at ¶ 5. The members of GeoTag’s executive management reside in the Eastern District of Texas.
John Veenstra, the CEO of GeoTag and lead inventor of the ’474 Patent has resided in the
Eastern District of Texas since 2007. Veenstra Declaration at ¶ 6. GeoTag has employed and
continues to employ several independent contractors in connection with its business at its Frisco,
Texas headquarters.
GeoTag’s connections to Texas and the Eastern District must be considered. Azure
Networks, LLC v. CSR, PLC, Civil Action No. 6:11cv139 LED-JDL at 11 (E.D. Tex. June 25,
2012). “Weight given to the location of the plaintiffs’ documents is determined by whether the
plaintiffs are an ephemeral entity.” Stragent LLC v. Audi AG, No. 6:10-cv-227, 2011 WL

8

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 6922

2912907 at *6 (E.D. Tex. July 18, 2011) (quoting NovelPoint Learning LLC v. Leapfrog
Enterprises, Inc., No. 6:10-cv-229, 2010 WL 5068146, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2010)).
GeoTag’s substantial connections with the Eastern District of Texas for over five years
demonstrate that its presence in this forum is not ephemeral. See Azure, supra, at 11. Therefore,
the location of GeoTag’s relevant documents, which are all in the Eastern District of Texas,
should be given weight in the transfer analysis. See In re Google, Inc., 412 Fed. Appx. 295 (Fed.
Cir. 2011) (taking into account non-ephemeral entity’s documents and ties to the forum).
Thus, even looking at AT&T’s evidence in the most favorable light, this factor weighs
significantly against transfer.
2. The Availability of Compulsory Process to Secure the Attendance of
Witnesses
This factor will weigh more heavily in favor of transfer when more third-party witnesses
reside within the transferee venue. See In re Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316. This factor will
weigh the heaviest in favor of transfer when a transferee venue is said to have “absolute
subpoena power.” In re Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316.

“Absolute subpoena power” is

subpoena power for both depositions and trial. In re Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 587 F.3d at 1338.
Importantly, the defendant bears the burden of identifying unwilling third party witnesses that
would benefit from the transfer. Effectively Illuminated Pathways, LLC v. Aston Martin Lagonda
of N. Am., Inc., No. 6:11-cv-34, slip op. at 5 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 19, 2012); see also Texas Data Co.,
LLC v. Target Brands, Inc., 771 F. Supp. 2d 630, 643 (E.D. Tex. 2011); NovelPoint, 2010 WL
5068146, at*6 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2010) (noting that the Court will not base its conclusion on
unidentified witnesses); West Coast Trends, Inc. v. Ogio Int’l, Inc., No. 6:10-cv-688, 2011 WL
5117850, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 27, 2011) (same).
AT&T alludes that two “likely witnesses about a key piece of prior art . . . [are] within

9

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 6923

the subpoena power of only the northern district of Texas” and that “one of these witnesses is
SuperMedia.” Dkt. No. 444 at 5. However, this is not an identification of an actual witness.
AT&T states that one third-party prior art witness currently resides in Arlington, Texas but
intentionally does not divulge the identity of the witness to allow GeoTag or this Court to verify
the accurateness of the witness’ location.
Although these vaguely identified witnesses do not reside in the Eastern District of Texas
within this Court’s absolute subpoena power, this Court may nevertheless compel these
witnesses to testify in this forum pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 45(c)(3)(C). See Transdata, Inc. v.
Tri-County Cooperative, Inc., Civil Action No 6:11cv46 LED-JDL at 6 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 11,
2011); i2 Technologies, Inc. v. Oracle Corporation, Civil Action No. 6:09 CV 194 at 5 (E.D.
Tex. August 17, 2010).
Because AT&T fails to identify specifically any third party witnesses located in the
Northern District of Texas and that any potential witnesses located are outside the subpoena
power of this Court, this factor weighs against transfer or, at most, is neutral.
3. The Cost of Attendance for Willing Witnesses
All parties and witnesses must be considered in the analysis of this factor. Volkswagen I,
371 F.3d at 204. “Because it generally becomes more inconvenient and costly for witnesses to
attend trial the further they are away from home, the Fifth Circuit established in Volkswagen I a
‘100-mile’ rule, which requires that ‘[w]hen the distance between an existing venue for trial of a
matter and proposed venue under § 1404(a) is more than 100 miles, the factor of inconvenience
to witnesses increases in direct relationship to the additional distance to be traveled.’” In re TS
Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (internal citations omitted).
Additionally, the convenience of non-party witnesses is given greater weight than that of party

10

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 6924

witnesses. Stragent, 2011 WL 2912907, at *7; NovelPoint, 2010 WL 5068146, at *6; see also
BNSF Ry. Co. v. OOCL (USA), Inc., 667 F. Supp. 2d 703, 711 (N.D. Tex. 2009).
AT&T fails to identify any specific witnesses located in Dallas for whom it would be
clearly more convenient if this case were transferred to that venue. AT&T mysteriously alludes
to unidentified AT&T witnesses who live in Dallas, Texas; Bothell, Washington; Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma; and Atlanta, Georgia. Dkt. No. 444 at 6. However, AT&T cannot specifically
identify a single employee with relevant knowledge. In addition, as this Court declared in
Innovative Automation, LLC v. Audio Video and Video Labs, Inc., Civil Action No. 6:11-CV-234
LED-JDL (E.D. Tex. May 30, 2012), “the Court gives more weight to those specifically
identified witnesses and affords less weight to vague assertions that witnesses are likely located
in a particular forum.” Id. at 13. See also NovelPoint Learning v. Leapfrog Enter., No 6:10-cv229, 2010 WL 5068146, at *6 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2010) (stating that the Court will not base its
conclusion on unidentified witnesses); see also West Coast Trends, Inc. v. Ogio Int’l, Inc., No.
6:10-cv-688, 2011 WL 5117850, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 27, 2011). In addition, AT&T only
vaguely identifies “likely third-party witnesses in . . . California and Georgia . . . Illinois and
California . . . and Massachusetts” who do not benefit anymore from a transfer to the Northern
District. Dkt. No. 444 at 5.
In contrast, GeoTag has specifically identified three of its employees and/or independent
contractors who reside in this forum who will be witnesses. Moore Declaration at ¶ 4.
Thus, this factor weighs slightly against transfer, or is neutral at worst.
4. Other Practical Problems
The goal of §1404(a) is to “prevent waste of time, energy, and money and to protect
litigants, witnesses, and the public against unnecessary inconvenience and expense.” Van Dusen

11

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 6925

v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 616 (1964). As a result, in appropriate circumstances, courts have
analyzed the goal of preventing unnecessary inconvenience and expense under the rubric of
“judicial economy.” Furthermore, “courts have consistently held that judicial economy plays a
paramount role in trying to maintain an orderly, effective, administration of justice.” In re
Vistaprint Ltd., 628 F.3d 1342, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing Cont’l Grain Co. v. Barge FBL585, 364 U.S. 19, 26 (1960))(additional citation omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. §1404(a) (“For the
convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice . . . ). Thus, although judicial
economy is not among the list of enumerated Gilbert factors, it is “a paramount consideration
when determining whether a transfer is in the interest of justice.” In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,
566 F.3d 1349, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2009). “[T]he existence of multiple lawsuits involving the same
issues is a paramount consideration when determining whether a transfer is in the interest of
justice . . . [T]o permit a situation in which two cases involving precisely the same issues are
simultaneously pending in different District Courts leads to the wastefulness of time, energy and
money that § 1404(a) was designed to prevent.” Continental Grain Co. v. The FBL585, 364 U.S.
19, 26, 80 S. Ct. 1470, 4 L.Ed.2d 1540 (1960). Although patent infringement cases “may not
involve precisely the same issues, there will be significant overlap and a familiarity with the
patents could preserve time and resources.” Volkswagen, 566 F.3d at 1351.
Transfer of GeoTag’s claims against AT&T to Dallas would not promote judicial
economy in this case. Only AT&T and five other defendants among the hundreds of defendants
in the GeoTag litigation have sought transfer of GeoTag’s claims against them to another forum,
and each of these defendants seek transfer to different forums. Therefore, transferring GeoTag’s
claims against AT&T and the other defendants who have filed transfer of venue motions would
splinter this litigation into at least six separate actions pending in six separate forums, leaving

12

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 6926

hundreds of defendants in the litigation pending in this forum. Each of these separate actions
will involve similar issues of claim validity, claim construction, claim scope, discovery,
evidence, proceedings, and trial. Transferring GeoTag’s claims against AT&T would create
duplicative, parallel proceedings on the same patent, unnecessarily wasting judicial resources
and raising the specter of inconsistent adjudication. In short, transfer would squarely contradict
the goals of §1404(a). See Van Dusen, 376 U.S. at 616 (opining that the goal of §1404(a) is to
“prevent waste of time, energy, and money and to protect litigants, witnesses, and the public
against unnecessary inconvenience and expense”). Thus, especially in view of the weak showing
of private factors favoring transfer, this is a situation where judicial economy is a “paramount
consideration in determining whether transfer is in the interest of justice.” Volkswagen II, 565
F.3d at 1351. Transfer should be denied for this reason alone. This Court has denied motions to
transfer on this ground in several cases with even less compelling circumstances than the
GeoTag litigation. See Innovative Automation, LLC v. Audio Video and Video Labs, Inc., Civil
Action No. 6:11-CV-234 LED-JDL (E.D. Tex. May 30, 2012); Patent Harbor, LLC v. Twentieth
Century Fox Home Entertainment, LLC, Civil Action No. 6:10-CV-607 LED-JDL (May 25,
2012).
5. Public Interest Factors
AT&T’s argument that the local interest factor favors transfer is without merit. Although
AT&T’s headquarters is located in Dallas, GeoTag has its headquarters in the Eastern District of
Texas and has a substantial presence in this forum. Thus, citizens of the Eastern District of
Texas have an interest in adjudicating this dispute, as much as or even more than the citizens of
Dallas. This factor is neutral. Azure Networks, LLC v. CSR, PLC, Civil Action No. 6:11cv139
LED-JDL at 15-16 (E.D. Tex. June 25, 2012).

13

Case 2:10-cv-00570-MHS Document 459

Filed 07/26/12 Page 14 of 15 PageID #: 6927

The speed with which a case can come to trial and be resolved is a factor in the transfer
analysis. A proposed transferee court’s “less congested docket” and “ab[ility] to resolve this
dispute more quickly” is a factor to be considered. In re Hoffmann-La Roche, 587 F.3d at 1336.
This factor is neutral. The median time from filing to trial in the Eastern District of Texas is
nearly the same as that in the Northern District of Texas.
CONCLUSION
The Court should sever GeoTag’s claims against AT&T and simultaneously consolidate
these claims against AT&T with the other GeoTag litigation pending before this Court for
pretrial purposes. The Court should also deny AT&T’s motion to transfer in the interests of
