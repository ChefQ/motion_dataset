Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 2 of 17

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
Plaintiff Evanston Insurance Company (“Evanston”) files this Evanston
Insurance Company’s Response to Gene By Gene, Ltd’s (“Gene By Gene”)
Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support Thereof and would
show the following:
I. SUMMARY OF RESPONSE
1.

The Electronic Data and Distribution of Material in Violation of

Statutes exclusion (the “Evanston Exclusion”) unambiguously excludes from
coverage the claims asserted against Gene By Gene in the underlying lawsuit.
Since none of the terms in the Evanston Exclusion are defined, those terms must be
given their everyday meaning.

When those terms are given their everyday

meaning, the Evanston Exclusion excludes from coverage the claims against Gene
By Gene alleging it violated a statute that prohibited transmitting, communication,
or distribution of genetic information. In interpreting the Evanston Exclusion, one
must consider the name in its heading which clearly indicates it applies to any
statute that prohibits distribution of certain materials in violation of any statute.
2.

Adopting Gene By Gene’s interpretation of the Evanston Exclusion is

unreasonable because it requires this Court to render meaningless certain phrases
in sub-parts (a) and (b) in addition to rendering meaningless all of sub-part (c)
2

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 3 of 17

which is contrary to the rules of contractual construction. The similar exclusions
Gene By Gene urges this Court to use as interpretive guides are significantly
different and interpretative discussions relative to those are irrelevant to the
Evanston Exclusion. Evanston’s interpretation is reasonable and accurate given all
three sub-parts of it similarly exclude claims for disclosure of information in
violation of certain statutes intended to protect the privacy of the statutory
beneficiaries.

Finally, Gene By Gene’s argument the Texas Department of

Insurance (“TDI”) administrative orders support its interpretation is misplaced and
without support because the purported “orders” upon which it relies are not orders
at all; they are approval of insurance policy forms. For these reasons, Gene By
Gene’s summary judgment must be denied.
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND1
3.

Evanston issued to Gene by Gene four insurance policies. Michael

Cole, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated (“Cole”) filed
against Gene by Gene a lawsuit styled Cause No.: 1:14-cv-00004-SLG: Michael
Cole, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Gene By Gene,
Ltd., a Texas limited liability company d/b/a Family Tree DNA; in the United
States District Court for the District of Alaska (“Underlying Lawsuit”). Cole
1

Evanston generally agrees with Gene by Gene’s recitation of the relevant
facts. For that reason, it will not repeat many of the same.
3

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 4 of 17

initiated the Underlying Lawsuit by filing his Class Action Complaint and Demand
for Jury Trial (“Complaint”).
4.

Cole alleges Gene by Gene “offers a variety of genetic testing

services, but is best known for marketing and selling DNA tests to consumers for
the purpose of helping them research or identify their ancestry.” Complaint ¶18.
Cole contends after Gene by Gene completes a customer’s DNA analysis, it offers
services for the customer to “research their ancestral origins.” Complaint ¶21.
Providing the means to customers to research their ancestry, Cole contends Gene
by Gene “automatically publishes the full results of their DNA test to its publically
available website” without obtaining the customer’s consent. Complaint ¶¶24, 25.
5.

The single claim Cole asserts against Gene by Gene in the Underlying

Lawsuit is an alleged violation of Alaska Statute §18.13.010 et seq. Complaint
¶¶40-48. This statute is commonly referred to as the “Genetic Privacy Act.” The
Genetic Privacy Act provision Cole asserts was violated was when Gene by Gene
“publishes the full results of their DNA” and which forms the basis of all his
claims provides one shall not “disclose the results of a DNA analysis unless the
person has first obtained the informed and written consent of the person.”
ALASKA STAT. §18.13.010 (a)(1).
6.

Gene by Gene tendered the Underlying Lawsuit to Evanston for

coverage and Evanston denied a defense and indemnification to Gene by Gene
4

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 5 of 17

asserting the Evanston Exclusion applies.2

Evanston initiated this proceeding

seeking a declaration it does not have to defend or indemnify Gene by Gene from
any claims or judgments in, or resulting from, the Underlying Lawsuit.
III. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES.
A.

Construing Insurance Policies in General.
7.

Under Texas law, undefined words in an insurance policy are given

their ordinary meaning. Gilbert Texas Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyds
London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 126 (Tex. 2010). In determining the scope of insurance
coverage, a court examines the policy as whole to ascertain the true intent of the
parties.

When insurance policy language is not ambiguous, the intent of the

policy must be determined based upon the four corners of the instrument and not
by any type of extrinsic parol evidence. TIG Ins. Co. v. North Am. Van Lines,
Inc., 170 S.W.3d 264, 268 (Tex. App. – Dallas 2005 no pet.). In construing an
exclusion, a court will adopt an interpretation urged by the insured so long as it is
not unreasonable even if the insurer’s interpretation appears more reasonable than
that of the insured. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Hudson Energy Co., 811
S.W.2d 552, 555 (Tex. 1991). Based upon these rules of interpretation, the
Evanston Exclusion unambiguously excludes from coverage the Underlying
2

The full language of the exclusion is identical in all four policies and is set out in full on
page 4 of the Memorandum in Support of Defendant Gene by Gene Ltd.’s Motion for Summary
Judgment (Document 21-1) (“Defendant’s Memorandum”).
5

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 6 of 17

Lawsuit’s claims.
B.

Plain Meaning Application of the Evanston Exclusion.
8.

The Evanston Exclusion excludes from coverage any claim or

cause of action “based upon or arising out of any violation of ... any other statute,
law, rule, ordinance or regulation that prohibits or limits

the sending,

transmitting, communication or distribution of information or other material.”
The only claim asserted in the Underlying Lawsuit involves Gene by Gene’s
alleged violation of the Alaska Genetic Privacy Act which prohibits one from
“disclos[ing] the results of a DNA analysis unless the person has first obtained ...
informed and written consent” from the person providing the DNA sample.
ALASKA STAT. §18.13.010 (a)(1). The Alaska Genetic Privacy Act also provides a
private right of action against one who “discloses the results of a DNA analysis in
violation of” that statute. In the Underlying Lawsuit, Cole asserts he never gave
Gene by Gene any authorization to disclose or distribute “his sensitive information
... to the public.” Complaint ¶30.
9.

The clear wording, meaning, and intent of the Complaint in the

Underlying Lawsuit, is Cole specifically asserts Gene by Gene violated a statute by
disclosing his DNA information. Cole also complains Gene by Gene violated the
Alaska Genetic Privacy Act by sending or transmitting his genetic information to

6

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 7 of 17

various websites. The common and everyday meaning of the words “sending”
and “transmitting” involve one (Gene by Gene) conveying (publishing on a
website) something (DNA information) to another (anyone who looks at the
website)which would naturally include disclosure of the thing being conveyed.
Black’s Law Dictionary defines “transmit” to mean “send or transfer (a thing) from
one person or place to another. ... To communicate.” Black’s Law Dictionary, 7th
Edition, p. 1505. For these reasons, the allegations Cole asserts against Gene by
Gene in the Underlying Lawsuit fall squarely within the Evanston Exclusion which
by endorsement is part of each of the four Evanston policies.
C.

Considering the Evanston Exclusion’s Title When Construing the Same.
10.

The Evanston Exclusion is entitled “Electronic Data and Distribution

of Material in Violation of Statutes.”

The title includes the term “Statutes”

indicating the endorsement encompasses more than one single type or category of
statutes. “Generally, courts should construe contractual provisions in a manner
that is consistent with the labels the parties have given them.” RSUI Indem. Co. v.
The Lynd Co., 2015 WL 2194201 *5, 58 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 854 (September 11,
2015). Like all of the other words in the Evanston Exclusion, the language in the
title provides insight into what the endorsement is intended to encompass.
11.

The Evanston Exclusion’s title is not just narrowly limited to select

statutes that regulate dissemination of information via email, calls or faxes. The
7

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 8 of 17

Evanston Exclusion’s title is much broader than just referencing statutes involving
faxes, calls or emails. The Evanston Exclusion’s title indicates it applies to all
statutes which may involve “distribution of material” and not just those statutes
which may involve distribution of materials via email, fax or calls that may intrude
ones seclusion. Id. citing Michiana Easy Livin’ Country, Inc. v. Holten, 168
S.W.3d 777, 793 (Tex.2005) (declining to construe a provision as limited to one
topic when “the title of the paragraph show[ed] that two different topics were
addressed in it”).
12.

In comparison, many of the endorsements Gene By Gene asks this

Court to consider in its analysis have titles that include language specifically
limiting their application to specific types of statutes or disclosure of specific types
of information. The titles of some of these exclusions are:
1.

2.

3.

4.

Exclusion – Violation of Statutes That Govern E-Mails, Fax,
Phone Calls or Other Methods of Sending Material or
Information (“Email/Fax/Phone Exclusion”) (Ex. F, Document
21-8, p. 7);
Exclusion – Access or Disclosure of Confidential or Personal
Information and Data - Related Liability - With Limited Bodily
Injury Exception (Ex. H, Document 21-10, p. 7);
Exclusion – Access or Disclosure of Confidential or Personal
Information and Data - Related Liability – Limited Bodily
Injury Exception Not Included (Id., p. 8); and
Exclusion – Access or Disclosure of Confidential or Personal
Information (Coverage B Only) (Id., p. 9).

This Court should not narrowly construe the Evanston Exclusion as being solely
limited to statutes that purportedly only protect against intruding one’s seclusion
8

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 9 of 17

by email faxes, or calls when the title of the Evanston Exclusion indicates it applies
to a broader range of statutes by omitting language limiting it to just specific types
of information or specific types of statutes.
13.
another

In addition to how the Evanston Exclusion is entitled, there is yet
significant

difference

between

the

manuscript

ISO

standard

Email/Fax/Phone Exclusion referenced above upon which Gene by Gene contends
is similar and the Evanston Exclusion.

In addition to the Email/Fax/Phone

Exclusion’s specific title limiting it to e-mails, faxes, phone calls, the language
appearing in sub-parts a. and b. are substantially different than the Evanston
Exclusion. In particular, sub-parts (a) and (b) of the Evanston Exclusion include
the additional language of “any similar or related federal or state statute” which is
absent from the corresponding sub-parts of the Email/Fax/Phone Exclusion.
14.

Gene by Gene’s mention of ISO exclusions addressing exclusion of

healthcare and other confidential information is irrelevant and should be given no
authoritative weight. This is because Evanston does not use any similar exclusion
in any of the policies it underwrites in the product line that includes the four
policies issued to Gene by Gene. See Debra Goldberg Affidavit, Exhibit “A.”
Evanston uses not similar exclusion because the Evanston Exclusion is worded
differently that the ISO exclusions proffered by Gene by Gene and the Evanston
Exclusion’s language on its face excludes those types of claims encompassed in
9

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 10 of 17

the ISO exclusions referenced by Gene by Gene that address disclosure of
confidential and healthcare information. Id. Adding exclusions specifically to
address disclosure of confidential and healthcare information would have been
unnecessary and redundant given the intentionally broader language in the
Evanston Exclusion than in the ISO exclusions Gene by Gene attempts to use by
way of comparison. Id.
D.

Considering Language that Modifies Other Language.
15.

One rule of contractual construction is that “modifiers are intended to

refer to the words closest to them in the sentence.” Samon v. Sun Oil Co., 621
S.W.2d 580, 581-82 (Tex. 1981) cited in Certain Underwriters at Lloyds v.
Cardtronics, Inc., 438 S.W.3d 770, 782 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no
pet.). Under this rule, the phrase “any similar or related federal or state statute” in
the Evanston Exclusion would modify, that is refer back to, the TCPA or
CAN-SPAM Act and not any other statutes involving the transmission of other
types of materials or information.
E.

Avoiding Redundant Language.
16.

Because sub-parts (a) and (b) of the Evanston Exclusion are

exclusively limited to TCPA and CAN-SPAM Act types of statutes and no other
types of similar statutes, that is why sub-part (c) is not redundant of the two prior
sub-parts. Interpreting sub-part (c) of the Evanston Exclusion as applying only to
10

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 11 of 17

statutes similar to the TCPA and the CAN-SPAM Act would render redundant the
language in sub-parts (a) and (b) which already address “any similar or related”
statutes.

When interpreting contractual language, courts must “presume that

words that follow one another are not intended to be redundant.” Alpert v. Riley,
274 S.W.3d 277, 288 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 2009 pet. denied). Since
that language in sub-part (c) of the Evanston Exclusion follows the “any similar or
related” statutes language in sub-parts (a) and (b), sub-part (c) cannot be presumed
as redundant and that means it must be presumed as referring to other types of
statutes that “prohibits or limits the sending, transmitting, communication or
distribution of information or other material.” One such statute is the Alaska
Genetic Privacy Act which Cole alleges in the Underlying Lawsuit Gene by Gene
violated.
F.

Avoiding rendering any Language Meaningless.
17.

Gene by Gene’s position is the Evanston Exclusion’s scope should go

“only so far as to include other state and federal statutes that similarly protect
individuals from unsolicited intrusion into seclusion.” Defendants Memorandum,
pp. 10-11. Such an interpretation would render totally meaningless sub-part (c) of
the Evanston Exclusion and ignore its plain meaning. If one parties’ interpretation
of a word or phrase in an insurance policy requires other words or phrases to be
ignored, that interpretation must be rejected. Balandran v. Safeco, Ins. Co., 972
11

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 12 of 17

S.W.2d 738, 741 (Tex. 1996). The Texas Supreme has held courts must “striv[e]
to give meaning to every sentence, clause, and word to avoid rendering any portion
inoperative” when construing language in an insurance policy. Id.
18.

Since sub-parts (a) and (b) already include language referring to

“similar or related statutes” of the same subject matter, sub-part (c) would either be
redundant or rendered meaningless if it was only to apply to statutes similar to the
TCPA and CAN-SPAM Act as urged by Gene By Gene. When possible, every
sentence, clause and word of a contract of insurance must be given some meaning
to avoid rendering it inoperative. Evergreen Nat. Indem. Co. v. Tan It All, Inc.,
111 S.W.3d 669, 677-78 (Tex. App. – Austin 2003, no pet.). For that reason, the
Evanston Exclusion’s sub-part (c) language must be referring to other types of
statutes, such as the Alaska Genetic Privacy Act which “prohibits or limits the
sending, transmitting, communication or distribution of information or other
material,” that being a person’s genetic information.
G.

The Problem With Gene by Gene’s Ejusdem Generis Argument.
19.

Gene by Gene contends ejusdem generis limit the Evanston

Exclusion’s sub-part (c)’s scope to go “only so far as to include other state and
federal statutes that similarly protect individuals from unsolicited intrusion into
seclusion.” Defendant’s Memorandum, p. 10-11. It so contends because it thinks
the TCPA and CAN-SPAM Act are intended “to regulate oppressive and/or
12

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 13 of 17

harassing conduct that intrudes into one’s seclusion, such as unsolicited fax
transmissions and electronic mail.” However, that belief is both erroneous and
misplaced. As a result, Gene by Gene’s contention that ejusdem generis limits the
Evanston Exclusion’s sub-part (c) to inclusion of seclusion protection statutes is
also both erroneous and misplaced.
20.

Gene by Gene is in error that the TCPA and CAN-SPAM Act have

the identical intent and purpose of prohibiting inclusion of seclusion. This is
because the intent of each statute is different. The TCPA’s intent is:
protect the privacy interests of residential telephone subscribers by
placing restrictions on unsolicited, automated telephone calls to the
home and to facilitate interstate commerce by restricting certain uses
of facsimile machines and automatic dialers. S.Rep. No. 102–178, at
1 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N.1968.
Satterfield v. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 569 F.3d 946, 954 (9th Cir.2009) (internal
quotations omitted). In comparison, the different “purpose of the CAN-SPAM
Act, as stated in the statute itself, as well as in the Senate Report, is to curb false or
misleading unsolicited commercial e-mail.” Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc., 2007
WL 2253296 *4 (W.D. Wash. 2007).
H.

Gene by Gene’s Failure to Cite a Single TDI Order.
21.

Legislative history from the statute’s proponents indicates the purpose

of the Alaska Genetic Privacy Act is to “protect genetic privacy and the
individual’s property interest in these samples and the information derived from
13

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 14 of 17

the samples.”

http://www.legis.state.ak.us/PDF/23/Bills/SB0217B.PDF.

See

Exhibit “B.” Accordingly, the TCPA and Alaska Genetic Privacy Act share the
similar purpose of prohibiting transmission or communication of certain
information to protect the privacy interests of those whom the statute is intended to
benefit. All three sub-parts of the Evanston Exclusion are harmonious and exhibit
an intent to expansively exclude from coverage “the sending, transmitting,
communication or distribution of information or other material” in violation of
many types of statute regardless of the rights the statute seeks to protect.
22. Although Gene by Gene argues TDI orders may be considered in
interpreting insurance policy language, Gene by Gene does not rely upon or cite a
single TDI order. Instead, Gene by Gene presented to this Court correspondence
and certificates from TDI which show certain endorsements were filed with that
administrative agency for the purpose of obtaining use approval. These filings are
not TDI orders. TDI orders are specifically entitled “Official Order of Texas
Department of Insurance” and then followed by a date, substance description of the
order, and at the end execution of the order by the Commissioner of Insurance.
For purposes of comparison to what Gene by Gene submitted as purported TDI
orders, numerous TDI orders can be viewed on that agencies website by going to
www.tdi.texas.gov/order/index.html. These orders are substantially different in
form, substance, and effect than the TDI correspondence Gene by Gene submitted
14

Case 4:14-cv-01842 Document 25 Filed in TXSD on 09/29/15 Page 15 of 17

regarding TDI’s approval of insurance policy forms. None of these form approval
letters submitted by Gene by Gene is authoritative in any regard and should not be
considered by this Court.
I.

The Evanston Exclusion Does Not Render any Other Coverage Illusory.
23.

Gene

by

Gene’s

argument

that

the

Evanston

Exclusion’s

sub-paragraph (c) if interpreted precludes coverage under the Alaska Genetic
Privacy Act would render the advertising injury provisions of the insurance
policies illusory must fail. That is not the case. The advertising injury provisions
of the policies would still apply to the many more traditional defamation and
advertising injuries so long as there is not statute, law, rule, ordinance or regulation
that applied to the type of information being published.

Thus, common law

claims for liable, slander, invasion of privacy and other forms of defamation would
still be covered under the advertising injury provisions of the policies so long as
there is no statute prohibiting the act complained about.
VI. PRAYER

For all reasons set forth herein, Markel respectfully requests that the Court

deny Defendants GENE BY GENE, LTD’s motion for summary judgment.
