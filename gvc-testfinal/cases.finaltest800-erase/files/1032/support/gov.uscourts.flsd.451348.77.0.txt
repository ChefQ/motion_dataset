MOTION FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
COMES NOW Plaintiff, by and through undersigned counsel, and requests the entry of a
Final Judgment against Defendants Barney N. Weinkle and Ilene M. Weinklewhich incorporates
both the jury verdict and liquidated damages, and in support thereof, states as follows:
Memorandum of Points and Authorities
1.

On October 14, 2015, the jury in this matter found in favor of Plaintiff for

$26,617.25 in minimum wages. Further, the jury found “yes” in response to the question “[t]hat
the Defendants either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether their conduct
was prohibited by the Fair Labor Standards Act's Overtime or Minimum Wage requirements?”
[DE 76].
2.

Following the jury verdict, this Court granted Plaintiff seven days to file a motion

for liquidated damages under the FLSA. This is that memorandum.

Case 0:14-cv-62481-BB Document 77 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2015 Page 2 of 8

I. Introduction
The imposition of liquidated damages is mandatory and is not discretionary unless the
Court finds that a Defendant has plead and shown that he or she acted in good faith and under the
reasonable belief that it was in compliance with the FLSA. As described below, this has not
occurred in this matter because:
a) The jury, as triers of fact, explicitly found that Defendants “knew or showed reckless
disregard” in regard to the FLSA's implementation;
b) Defendants did not show any evidence as to how they relied on any particular law or
source of law, which was buttressed by the fact that Defendants did not keep records, nor
were they able to articulate at trial what the FLSA requires.
If any one of the above stated reasons above is true, then this Court does not have
discretion, and must award liquidated damages.
II. Argument
In order for Defendants to fulfill their burden of showing a good faith reliance on a
particular and adequate source of law, they must plead that defense, and then show through
evidence that they had a good faith reliance on a particular law or holding under the FLSA.
The FLSA provides that liquidated damages are generally mandatory:
Any employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or section 207 of this
title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their
unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may
be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.
29 U.S.C.A. § 216(b).
Section 260 gives the Court some authority if certain criteria is met through a “safe
harbor” provision:
In any action […] to recover unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime
compensation, or liquidated damages, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938, as amended [29 U.S.C.A. § 201 et seq.], if the employer shows to the
satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in

Case 0:14-cv-62481-BB Document 77 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2015 Page 3 of 8

good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act
omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,
amended, the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages
award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216
this title.

or
as
or
of

29 U.S.C. § 260.
These two sectinos together show that the FLSA only vests in the Court discretion if the
employer is able to show this good faith defense. See Lamonica v. Safe Hurricane Shutters,
Inc., 711 F.3d 1299, n2 (11th Cir. 2013)(“The court has discretion not to award liquidated
damages if it finds that the defendant acted in good faith. 29 U.S.C. § 260”); Joiner v. Macon,
814 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir. 1987); see also Moore v. Appliance Direct, Inc., 708 F.3d 1233,
1241 (11th Cir. 2013)(explaining that liquidated damages in retaliation matters are discretionary
because a different standard exists for retaliation matters compared to to minimum wage
matters); 9 C.F.R. § 790.13.
“An employer who violates the FLSA's overtime provision carries the burden of proving
its entitlement to the safe harbor.” Rodriguez v. Farm Stores Grocery, Inc., 518 F.3d 1259, 1272
(11th Cir. 2008), citing Joiner v. City of Macon, 814 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir.1987). To make
this showing, an employer must not merely show that their heart was in the right place. An
objective and subjective showing must be made. “[E]ven if we assume, arguendo only, that the
[employer] demonstrated a sufficient honest intention to meet the subjective component of good
faith, the employer still must shoulder the 'additional requirement' of showing that the employer
had reasonable grounds for believing that its conduct comported with the Act.” Dybach v. State
of Fla. Dep't of Corr., 942 F.2d 1562, 1567 (11th Cir. 1991). An employer who seeks to avoid
liquidated damages bears the burden of proving that its violation was both in good faith and
predicated upon such reasonable grounds that it would be unfair to impose upon him more than a
compensatory verdict. Joiner v. Macon, 814 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir. 1987).

Case 0:14-cv-62481-BB Document 77 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2015 Page 4 of 8

The subjective component requires that the employer show that they truly believed in
compliance and made an effort to understand the laws by which they were expected to abide.
“The standard set forth in Dybach requires a showing of intention to ascertain the law, not just an
honest belief that the defendants acted in accordance with the law.” Arias v. Alpine Towing,
Inc., 2011 WL 1233229 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2011); Friedman v. S. Florida Psychiatric Associates,
Inc., 139 F. App'x 183 (11th Cir. 2005)(“[G]ood faith requires some duty to investigate potential
liability under FLSA”).
The objective requirement demands that the employer have something particular that they
reasonably relied on. “'[G]ood faith is intended to apply only where an employer innocently and
to his detriment, followed the law as it was laid down to him by government agencies, without
notice that such interpretations were claimed to be erroneous or invalid.' Under the Act, '[t]he
employer must meet an objective test of actual conformity with an administrative ruling or policy
[internal citations omitted].'” Olson v. Superior Pontiac-GMC, Inc., 765 F.2d 1570, 1579-80
(11th Cir.) modified, 776 F.2d 265 (11th Cir. 1985). “Even if there were reasonable grounds to
believe that the [employee was exempt], the law requires that the defendants show what actions
they took to ascertain this belief.” Arias v. Alpine Towing, Inc., 2011 WL 1233229 (S.D. Fla.
Mar. 30, 2011), citing Barcellona v. Tiffany English Pub, 579 F.2d 464, 469 (5th Cir. 1979).
This objective requirement requires that the employer show that he or she went above and
beyond mere review of the law or reliance on their experience in business. E.g. Rodriguez v.
Farm Stores Grocery, Inc., Case Number: 02-22451 [D.E. 342 entered on 9/13/05] .; Wajcman v.
Inv. Corp. of Palm Beach, 620 F. Supp. 2d 1353 (S.D. Fla. 2009); Moon v. Technodent Nat.,
Inc., 2008 WL 2117053 (M.D. Fla. May 19, 2008); Hurtado v. Raly Development, case no.: 1124476 [D.E. 175]

a.

A Jury Verdict of “yes” on Willfulness in Regard to Statute of Limitations
Matters Precludes a Court Finding of Good Faith.
In FLSA matters, the jury is often faced with the question as to whether the two or three

year statute of limitations applies. An instruction addressing this topic would ask the jury to
provide a verdict regarding the “willfulness” of the FLSA violation. While the question that this
Court is faced with in this instant motion is different in that it deals with “good faith”, these two
questions are so close that a jury's “yes” verdict on willfulness will preclude the Court from
finding a “yes” on good faith. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals analyzed this extensively in
Alvarez Perez v. Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, Inc., 515 F.3d 1150, 1166 (11th Cir. 2008).
“We conclude, based on the reasoning and holdings of our Glenn and Castle decisions, that in an
FLSA case a jury's finding in deciding the limitations period question that the employer acted
willfully precludes the court from finding that the employer acted in good faith when it decides
the liquidated damages question.” Id. at 1166; e.g. Williams v. R.W. Cannon, Inc., 08-60168CIV, 2009 WL 655730 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 12, 2009). Ortiz v. Santuli Corp., 08-20218-CIV, 2009
WL 2852629 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 2, 2009), Chacon v. El Milagro Care Ctr., Inc., 07-22835-CIV,
2009 WL 2852551 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 1, 2009) and Jones v. Carswell Prop. Maint., Inc., 09-22027CIV, 2011 WL 4832543 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 12, 2011).
Because the jury in this matter found that Defendants were willful in their violation of the
FLSA, this Court must find for the full liquidated damages amount. The Court should not review
the merits of Defendants' good faith argument.
b.

Defendants Have Not Shown Any Evidence of Good Faith Efforts of
Compliance with the FLSA

Defendants provided nothing which would indicate that they acted in good faith.
Defendant Ilene Weinkle stated that she did not know what the minimum wage was. Plaintiff's
counsel recalls that Defendants affirmed that they reviewed no laws or other sources to ensure

Case 0:14-cv-62481-BB Document 77 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2015 Page 6 of 8

that Plaintiff was properly paid. The Defendants took no records of which they could possibly
know how much Plaintiff was entitled to under the FLSA. Defendant Barney Weinkle made
many affirmations of the law which were baldly incorrect (independent contractor status,
Department of Labor policies). In fact, the Defendants seemed unaware that the matter was even
about unpaid wages until halfway through the trial.1
There is no justification on the record for this Court to find that Defendants had
performed the good faith research and review necessary for them to avail themselves of the safeharbor which would prevent the application of mandatory liquidated damages. Without
justification for a finding good faith, this Court cannot exercise discretion to reduce liquidated
damages.
III.Conclusion
The jury in this matter found that Defendants' actions were willful in denying Plaintiff
her minimum wages. With such a jury verdict, this Court cannot permit Defendants to avail
themselves of the safe harbor provisions which would prevent mandatory liquidated damages.
Further, there is no evidence to find that Defendants were in good faith, even if this Court could
exercise its discretion. Thus, this Court should enter judgment for the full amount found by the
jury and the liquidated damages.
1 This was not the first time counsel for Plaintiff noticed this. Counsel for Plaintiff attempted to remedy
Defendants confusion on multiple occasions, including at deposition. See Deposition of Barney Weinkle [DE 441]:
Q.
part?

Okay.

Did you read the rest of the complaint after the overtime

A.
I don't remember anything other than that.
Q.
Okay. So you have no idea about any claims that aren't overtime
claims in this matter?
A.
I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?
Q.
You have no idea about any other claim in this, other than
overtime?
A.
Independent recollection right now that she had to work in an
environment, a bad environment? She worked with chemicals.
Q.
No. That's not what the suit's about.
A.
No?
Q.
No.
