Judge Emmett G. Sullivan

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA’S MOTION TO ENLARGE THE TIME TO PRODUCE
SUBPOENAED DOCUMENTS
The District of Columbia (“the District”), by and through the undersigned counsel, moves
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 6 (b)(1) to enlarge time to produce subpoenaed documents from
November 30, 2007, to February 15, 2008, in light of the results from an e-mail search indicating
approximately 21,555 e-mails and the District’s current capability to perform the search and
review task manually with existing staff resources. Alternatively, the District seeks an order
directing the plaintiff as the requesting party to pay for the costs of production and review,
including the use of attorney reviewers and a privilege log, all performed under the District’s
supervision. The District is not a party to the core transaction at issue here between the
Washington Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Akridge and should not have to bear the
expense of search, production and review and protection.
An LCvR 7(a) supporting memorandum and LCvR 7(c) proposed order accompany this
motion. LCvR 7(m) consent was sought from counsel for plaintiff which was denied on
November 27, 2007, although as indicated in the accompanying memorandum, counsel for the

parties continue to attempt to confer to reduce the number of e-mails and to adopt creative ways
to meet the production obligation imposed by the Court’s order.

Civil Action No. 1:07-CV-1821 (EGS)
Judge Emmett G. Sullivan

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN
SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO ENLARGE THE TIME TO PRODUCE SUBPOENAED
DOCUMENTS
I. Factual and Procedural Background
Plaintiff Monument Realty, LLC, (“Plaintiff”) issued and served a subpoena duces
tecum on the District of Columbia’s Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development on
or about October 17, 2007. The District of Columbia (“the District”) has been producing
documents on a rolling basis with an excess of 4500 pages of material produced as indicated in
its status reports filed with the Court on November 14, 2007 and November 20, 2007. As
indicated in those status reports, Plaintiff and the District agreed on nearly 50 search terms to
search for e-mail records on or about November 13, 2007, and a search was commenced by the
Office of the Chief Technology Officer (“OCTO”).
The results of the first search, not previously indicated in the District’s status reports,
initially produced a census of 35,000 e-mails on or about November 20, 2007. That number was
reduced by eliminating duplicate copies to approximately 21,555 e-mails, including attachments,
on or about November 21, 2007. The District conferred with counsel for Plaintiff regarding this

Case 1:07-cv-01821-EGS

Document 33-2

Filed 11/28/2007

Page 2 of 8

matter initially submitting that it was without resources to print, Bates, review for relevance, and
create a privilege log by the November 30, 2007, deadline imposed by the Court. On November
27, 2007, counsel for the parties explored a clawback agreement and a protective order that
would have facilitated production, however, the District concluded ultimately that it could not
lose control of the review process without potentially serious breaches of the deliberative process
privilege. In addition, the District offered to narrow the search to three terms “Akridge” “Bus
garage” and “Monument” producing a census of approximately 1000 e-mails; counsel for
Plaintiff civilly declined. The District then offered to have Plaintiff’s counsel limit the search
terms to 15 or 25; that offer was acted upon, and with slight modifications provided by Plaintiff’s
counsel, the District undertook the search with approximately 22 terms and awaits word from the
Office of the Chief Technology Officer as to how many e-mails that may produce. The District
noted to Plaintiff’s counsel that many of the e-mails initially reviewed had little if anything to do
with commercial real estate transactions, explaining that some of the emails concerned traffic
accidents and snow plowing at different site locations that were listed among the search terms.
Finally, the District has requested the assistance of its Office of Contracting and Procurement to
price document review and production services to more fully inform itself of the relative cost.
As a practical matter, the District is without currently marketed software that might assist
in this endeavor. Consequently, should the Plaintiff continue to request the full 21,555 e-mails
be reviewed for privilege and relevance the District faces a daunting task. It should be noted at
the outset that 21,555 e-mails does not equal 21,555 documents; the e-mails and their
attachments could easily exceed 45,000 documents. The initial task of printing such e-mails will
take approximately twenty one days using currently available printers and paralegal staff
borrowed from throughout the Civil Litigation Division. Two attorneys, along with four support

Page 3 of 8

staff, all with other competing deadlines and cases, are currently assigned the review tasks; that
number would have to be substantially increased since even a “back of the envelope” estimate
suggests that about 30 e-mails could be reviewed an hour or roughly 60 documents working at
maximum efficiency resulting in an estimate of at least 750 hours of attorney search time
(45,000/ 60= 750) not to mention the additional substantial time to create a privilege log. A
substantial number of attorneys from the Civil Litigation Division’s attorney staff would have to
share in this burden completely disrupting their case loads and their ability to meet deadlines in
other cases.
Balanced against this severe burden is the substantive need by Plaintiff for the
information that might be gleaned from the e-mails. The subpoena seeks at best contextual
information about the activities of the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, a now non existent
non-party. The core transaction at issue in this litigation, however, involves the planned
disposition of a bus garage site controlled by the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority
(“WMATA”) to the Akridge Corporation rather the Plaintiff, Monument Realty. Plaintiff
ostensibly seeks to demonstrate that it had an agreement with WMATA to receive the site and
would use general information about general development around the site in question to
demonstrate, somehow, that Plaintiff, not Akridge, was to be the intended recipient of the site.
Alternate evidence to prove or disprove the existence of an agreement well exists as
demonstrated by the actions of Defendant WMATA which is seeking to interview a current
District employee on her knowledge of whether WMATA ever had an understanding with
Plaintiff regarding the disposition of the site.
The District submits that it is without the current resources to comply with the Court’s
order, that it has been diligent and that the enlargement it seeks is reasonable under the

3

Case 1:07-cv-01821-EGS

Document 33-2

Filed 11/28/2007

Page 4 of 8

circumstances. Alternatively, and as proposed in the Motion, the District seeks to shift the
burden of cost of production and review to Plaintiff since the District is not a party and the
information sought by the Plaintiff from the District, never a party to the core transaction here at
issue, is potentially tangentially relevant. However, the District is entitled to protect its
deliberative process privilege with regard to other transactions and accordingly it would be
severely prejudiced by any abrogation of the privilege. Accordingly, the prejudice to Plaintiff,
while not slight should it be compelled to pay for production and review, does not outweigh the
burden and detriment to the District. The argument set forth below demonstrates that the District
has met its burden for an enlargement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) (1) and that the cost of
production and review should be shifted to the Plaintiff.
II. Argument
A. The District Has Demonstrated Its Diligence and the Plaintiff Has Relatively Little Prejudice
Fed. R. Civil P. 6(b) (1) and (2) provide in relevant part:
(b) Enlargement. When by these Rules of by notice given
thereunder or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be
done at or within a specified time, the Court for cause shown at
any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion or notice order
the period enlarged if the request therefor is made before the
expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a
previous order, or (2) upon motion made after the expiration of the
specific period permit the act to be done where the failure to act
was the result of excusable neglect.
Courts grant “(b) (1)” enlargements (pre-expiration enlargements) where the moving party shows
good cause and the opposing party suffers little prejudice. 4A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice
and Procedure, Civil 2d §1165, n.5 (2002 ed.) Similarly, courts grant “(b) (2)” or nunc pro tunc
enlargements where the moving party has been diligent and the non-moving party suffers no

4

Case 1:07-cv-01821-EGS

Document 33-2

Filed 11/28/2007

Page 5 of 8

substantial prejudice. 4A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d §1165, n.2
(2002 ed.).
As applied to this case, the District has demonstrated its diligence within the range of its
currently available resources and would hope to meet the production and review deadline by
February 15, 2008. Interim reports may be necessary. The burden on Plaintiff as previously
iterated, may not be slight should it be compelled to pay; however, Plaintiff also stands the most
potentially to gain and under the eight factor test set forth below should be compelled to pay.
B. The Eight Factor Cost Shifting Test Favors Shifting Costs to Plaintiff
In Wiginton v. C.B. Richard Ellis, Inc., 229 F.R.D. 568 ( N.D. Ill., 2004), the District
Court examined eight factors to determine that a group of plaintiff employees in an employment
discrimination case requesting e-discovery should be compelled to pay up to seventy-five
percent of the costs of data review and conversion. Noting that it was adopting the eight factor
analysis from two other cases, Zubulake v. UBS Warburg, LLC, 217 F.R.D. 309, 316 (S.D.N.Y.
2003) (“Zubulake I”) and Rowe Entertainment v. The William Morris Agency, Inc., 205 F.R.D.
421, 428 (S.D. N.Y. 2002), the District Court found a small number of relevant documents
produced in the search supported the cost shifting to the plaintiffs. Id. at 575-576. The eight
factors enumerated by the Court, as part of the so called “marginal utility” analysis were set forth
as follows:
1) the likelihood of discovering critical information; 2) the
availability of such information from other sources; 3) the amount
in controversy as compared to the total cost of production; 4) the
parties' resources as compared to the total cost of production; 5)
the relative ability of each party to control costs and its incentive
to do so; 6) the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation; 7)
the importance of the requested discovery in resolving the issues at
stake in the litigation; and 8) the relative benefits to the parties of
obtaining the information. At all times we keep in mind that
because the presumption is that the responding party pays for

5

Case 1:07-cv-01821-EGS

Document 33-2

Filed 11/28/2007

Page 6 of 8

discovery requests, the burden remains with CBRE to demonstrate
that costs should be shifted to Plaintiffs. See Zubulake II, 216
F.R.D. at 283.
Id. at 573. Application of these factors in the present case should lead to the conclusion that the
Plaintiff should bear the cost of production. First, there is a substantially lessened likelihood of
discovering critical information about the core transaction since the District is a non-party.
Secondly, the likelihood of obtaining information from other sources, principally testimony, is
substantial; WMATA is already seeking to enlist a District employee to support its contentions.
Third, factors 3, 4, and 5, relating to cost tend to favor Plaintiff being able to pay the cost of the
of the production since the District lacks sufficient resources to respond to Plaintiff’s search
request within the time limitations set by the Court. Fourth, factors 6, 7, and 8, regarding the
importance of the information again favor the Plaintiff bearing the cost since there is little benefit
and not insubstantial harm to the District in having to disclose even the existence of its internal
processes through a privilege log regarding transactions that have a remote nexus with the core
transaction but a probable nexus with the material requested in the subpoena. The District must
be able to avoid chilling intra-mural candor in negotiations and in political strategies often
necessary to commercial development. The District needs such candor for effective government.
As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted in Ackerly v. Ley, 420 F. 2d.
1336, 1341, 137 U.S. App. D.C. 133 (D.C. Cir. 1969) commenting on the necessity of the intramural or executive privilege in the context of the Freedom of Information Act:
The basis of Exemption (5), as of the privilege which antedated it,
is the free and uninhibited exchange and communication of
opinions, ideas, and points of view -- a process as essential to the
wise functioning of a big government as it is to any organized
human effort. In the Federal Establishment, as in General Motors
or any other hierarchical giant, there are enough incentives as it is
for playing it safe and listing with the wind; Congress clearly did

not propose to add to them the threat of cross-examination in a
public tribunal.
Consequently, and accordingly, the District contends that it should not have to pay to expose its
own processes in a controversy to which it is not a party.
III. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the District respectfully requests that the Court either grant
additional time to the District to respond to the subpoena to February 15, 2008, using its own
resources, or, alternatively, and more sensibly, require the Plaintiff to pay the costs of
production, review and privilege log.
