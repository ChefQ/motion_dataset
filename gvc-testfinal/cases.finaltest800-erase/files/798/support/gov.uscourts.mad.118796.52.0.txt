DECLARATION OF PETER SWEENEY IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I, Peter Sweeney, hereby declare as follows:
1.

I am an Assistant Vice President with Bank of America, N.A. (“BANA”). I

submit this declaration in support of BANA’s and defendant FIA Card Services, N.A.’s Motion
for Summary Judgment. I have personal knowledge of all the facts set forth herein and, if called
upon, could and would testify competently thereto.
2.

I have been an employee of BANA since January 2, 2001 and have been an

Assistant Vice President in the Home Equity Underwriting and Fulfillment department since
April 16, 2010.

My job responsibilities include, among other tasks, management of closings for

the department. I am familiar with both BANA’s and FIA’s policies and procedures, and
document retention practices for their various account records and files. In my position, I have
access to both BANA’s and FIA’s historical records for all deposit and credit card accounts
maintained by either FIA or BANA.

Wen Y. Chiang’s VISA Account: I have reviewed FIA’s records for Wen Y.

Chiang’s VISA account ending in 7198 (“VISA account”), including written correspondence
relating to this, and I have made myself familiar with the VISA account records and information.
Mr. Chiang’s VISA account was opened on November 21, 2005 with a credit limit of $3,500.
The VISA account was originally opened with Bank of America, N.A. (USA) and assigned an
account number ending in 6419. On January 1, 2006, Bank of America Corporation and MBNA
Corporation merged, and in June 2006, MBNA’s subsidiary which issued credit cards—MBNA
American Bank, N.A.—was renamed FIA Card Services, N.A. In October 2006, Bank of
America, N.A. (USA) merged into FIA. When Mr. Chiang’s VISA credit card expired in late
2008, the VISA account was reassigned a new number (ending in 1736), in part because FIA, the
successor entity to Bank of America, N.A. (USA) now maintained the account. The account was
again assigned a new number (ending in 7198) in September 2009 when the account was
charged-off as a result of Mr. Chaing’s maintaining the account in default status.
4.

I understand that BANA is a named defendant in this action. However, BANA

does not maintain the VISA account, and has never maintained it or had any responsibility for
the account or any credit reporting relating to this account. As explained above, the VISA
account was originally opened by Bank of America, N.A. (USA), which was a separate and
completely different legal entity than BANA, and which merged into FIA a number of years
before the events at issue in this lawsuit.
5.

Attached hereto as Exhibit A are true and correct copies of monthly account

statements for Mr. Chiang’s VISA account from January 2008 through September 2009 when the
account was charged-off. These documents came from FIA’s records, to which I have access,

for the VISA account. As the 2009 account statements reflect, Mr. Chiang’s last payment of
$200 on his VISA account posted on January 13, 2009. Mr. Chiang inexplicably stopped making
any payments on his VISA account thereafter, even though at the time he had maintained a
balance of over $3,000 on his account. Mr. Chiang has not made any payments on his VISA
account since January 13, 2009.
6.

Attached hereto as Exhibit B are true and correct copies of various

correspondence between FIA (or its predecessor) and Mr. Chiang relating to the VISA account.
These documents came from FIA’s records for the VISA account.
7.

Wen Y. Chiang’s Checking Account: As explained, in my position, I also have

access to information for checking accounts maintained by BANA, including Mr. Chiang’s
checking account ending in 9778 (the “Checking Account”). I have made myself familiar with
the account records and information for the Checking Account. Mr. Chiang’s Checking Account
was opened on May 15, 2008. Attached hereto as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of the
signature card for the Checking Account that was signed by Mr. Chiang when he opened the
account. This document came from BANA’s records for the Checking Account.
8.

In conjunction with the opening of his Checking Account, Mr. Chiang also signed

an Overdraft Protection Authorization form, authorizing BANA to debit Mr. Chiang’s VISA
account ending in 6419 (subsequently reassigned number 7198), as necessary to cover checks or
items drawn on the Checking Account if payment of those checks or items would cause his
Checking Account to be overdrawn. Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a true and correct copy of
the Overdraft Protection Authorization form signed by Mr. Chiang. This document came from
BANA’s records for the Checking Account.
