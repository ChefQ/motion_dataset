DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM
IN REPLY TO PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION [DE 86]
TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
AND
IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DE 84]
ON THE ISSUE OF EXEMPTION
Defendants’ motion [DE 81] asserts that the entertainers are exempt from
FLSA coverage because they are “creative professionals” within the meaning of
the governing regulations. Plaintiffs, in opposing defendants’ motion, dispute this
[DE 86] because they claim that:
1.

“The only other case to address the exemption in the context of a strip
club” denied summary judgment to the defendants (DE 86, pp.3-4);

1

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 2 of 18

2.

Since the entertainers’ compensation for services comes from the
club’s customers and not independently from the club, those monies
may not be used to calculate the “fee basis” level of entertainer
compensation (DE 86, pp.4-5); and

3.

A striptease just isn’t artistic enough to qualify for the exemption (DE
86, pp.6-8).

In support of their own motion regarding the exemption [DE 84-1],
plaintiffs claim that they should prevail, as a matter of law on undisputed facts,
because:
4.

Payments of the various minimum charges for services does not fit
within the definition of payment on a “fee basis” (DE 84-1, pp.9-13);
and

5.

The entertainer’s job “does not require invention, imagination,
originality, or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative
endeavor” (DE 84-1, pp.13-20).

Defendants note that – with regard to the definition or application of the
elements of the “creative professional” exemption – there is no case the holding or
reasoning of which is binding on this Court. Neither the Eleventh Circuit nor the
Supreme Court has ever had occasion to interpret that provision of the FLSA in
any context.

1.

The Harrell case.
The plaintiffs seek to invoke the opinion in Harrell v. Diamond A Entm’t,

Inc., 992 F. Supp. 1343 (M.D. Fla. 1997), in support of their position but they read
the decision too superficially and seek to apply it too broadly. It must be read in
context; that is, as a decision on the defendants’ motion for summary judgment
and, therefore, with all inferences drawn against the defendants’ positions and in
favor of the plaintiff entertainers.
The portion concerning the exemption came only after determinations were
made that the defendants had presented insufficient evidence to meet their
summary judgment burden on the various elements required to determine the
entertainers’ proper classification. Only then – constrained by the decision that
there was insufficient evidence of the elements already discussed – did the Harrell
court address the elements of the exemption claim. The “classification” factors,
however, are not involved in this case and the “exemption” elements can be
decided independently.
The Harrell court held that – as to the “fee basis” utilization of service
charge payments in its calculation – “the Court is not prepared to conclude that
Plaintiff meets the monetary threshold for the professional exemption,
3

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 4 of 18

notwithstanding the fact that she received dance fees in excess of $250 per week.”
Harrell, 992 F.Supp., at 1355. That is very different from saying that the plaintiff
could not, as a matter of law, meet the monetary requirement if additional facts
were proved at trial.
Likewise, with regard to the nature of the entertainers’ performance, the
Harrell court simply held that the defendant “failed to meet its burden of showing
that Plaintiff's work required ‘invention, imagination, or talent,’” and, therefore,
“the Court cannot say that Plaintiff is a professional artist within the meaning of
§541.3.” Harrell, 992 F.Supp., at 1357. Again, “failing to meet its burden” in the
context of a summary judgment motion is a far cry from a holding that a striptease
artist can not ever be considered “a professional artist within the meaning of
§541.3.”

2.

For purposes of determining whether the exemption applies, the source
of the payment does not matter.
At the heart of the plaintiffs’ argument concerning payment of service

charges by customers (DE 86, pp.4-6) is the fact that plaintiffs appear simply to
disagree with the Department of Labor in how a “tip” is defined. The plaintiffs
would, understandably, prefer that all money paid to or retained by an entertainer
4

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 5 of 18

be classified as “tips” while the Department of Labor stubbornly insists that
“involuntary gratuities” (like minimum charges imposed by the club for services)
are not tips. Since money paid by customers is either a “tip” or a “service charge,”
it follows that whatever payment isn’t a “tip” is a “service charge.”
As defendants noted elsewhere (DE 82-1, p.6), the U.S. Department of
Labor has opined, inter alia, that an “imposed gratuity” is not a “tip,” even if it is
not included in an employer’s gross receipts, citing 29 C.F.R. §§ 531.32 and
531.55, Opinion Letter FLSA2005-31.1/ Thus, customer payments of the
minimum charges imposed by the club for the services of the entertainers are not
“tips.” Ipso facto, they must be “service charges.”
The amount of “service charges” received by each plaintiff remains an issue
for trial on the issue of offset and the counterclaim but for purposes of meeting the
“fee basis” threshold, the VIP Room “involuntary gratuities” (the minimum
payment amounts imposed for the dancers’ services) are, even standing alone,
more than sufficient to carry the day for purposes of the exemption.

3.

A striptease is clearly sufficiently artistic to qualify for the exemption.
The plaintiffs seem not to have addressed defendants’ argument on its

merits so defendants will not belabor the point. Defendants adopt those arguments
in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion.

4.

Payments of the various minimum charges for services fits within the
definition of payment on a “fee basis.”
In order to keep matters somewhat simple in determining whether the

entertainers receive at least the minimum required amounts when calculated on a
“fee basis,” defendants rely only on the minimum charges for VIP Room sessions
which were imposed by the club for dancers’ services.2/ At those rates, the “fee
basis” amount is approximately $400.00 x ∼40 ≅ $16,000.00; this is far in excess
of the $455.00 required minimum.
a.

In determining whether the exemption applies, it is the club
which actually makes the payment, but who makes the payment is
irrelevant.

The plaintiffs’ first objection on the “fee basis” element of the exemption is

2/

That is, $100.00 for a”15-minute” VIP Room session, $200.00 for a “30minute” session, and $400.00 for a “60-minute” session.
6

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 7 of 18

that the money is paid by the customer, not by the club. As a matter of fact this is
inaccurate (or, at least, is a disingenuous characterization); as a matter of law this
is irrelevant.
It is an inaccurate argument because – as to the VIP Room charges – the
customer’s payment is received by the club’s assistant manager at the door of the
VIP Lounge and then (if it was a cash payment) remitted to the entertainer at the
end of the night by the club or, if it was a credit or debit card payment, is collected
by the club and paid to the entertainer by check.
It is a disingenuous argument because all payments made by the club come
from money paid by customers. Plaintiffs’ reasoning would require that entertainer compensation (including any minimum wage payments) could come only from
shareholder equity. That would lead to absurd results and is ridiculous.
It is an irrelevant argument as a matter of law because the USDOL
regulations nowhere require that the payment be made by the club. The plaintiffs
seek to conflate two separate and distinct, and very different, questions: (1) “What
is the amount of the ‘fee basis?’” and (2) “May the minimum amounts charged by
the club for certain services be used to offset the amounts calculated to be due to
the entertainer at a minimum wage rate?” Only the first is relevant to the
7

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 8 of 18

plaintiffs’ motion on the exemption issue.

b.

The VIP Room minimum charge for the entertainers is not based
on the time spent.

The plaintiffs’ second objection on the use of VIP Room minimum charges
used for the “fee basis” calculation is that VIP Room visits are (they assert)
described by using an amount of time and are therefore excluded by the
regulations.3/ The USDOL has, itself, used tasks described by their duration as
illustrations of activities properly used to calculate the adequacy of the payment on
a “fee basis.” See 29 C.F.R. § 541.313 (2000-2004); 29 C.F.R. § 541.605 (2005 2014).
This makes perfect sense since the adequacy of the fee payment is not
measured by the amount that was actually paid to the entertainer, but by an amount
measured by what would have been earned had the entertainer been performing
3/

It should be clear that the durations referred to in notices and in advertisements for VIP Room sessions is descriptive only and is, in practice, only
approximate. As the attached Declaration of August Caudle (DE 90-2, ¶5)
establishes, the club does not increase the minimum service charge to the
customer for a VIP Room session if the session runs a few minutes over (or
give a refund on those occasions when a session concludes early). Thus, as
a factual matter, the entertainer is not being compensated based on the
amount of time but, rather, on his performance of a session, however many
minutes it actually lasts.
8

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 9 of 18

that task for 40 hours during the work week; thus, ordinarily the adequacy of the
payment can be determined only after the time worked on the job has been
determined and then extrapolating that time and amount to a 40-hour week. See,
e.g., 29 C.F.R. § 541.313(c) (2000); 29 C.F.R. § 541.605 (2014).

c.

The task of entertaining in a VIP Room during a session is
unique, not simply repetitive.

The plaintiffs’ third objection regarding the “fee basis” element is that
entertaining during a VIP Room session is, they assert in the words of the
regulations, “a series of jobs repeated an indefinite number of times and for which
payment on an identical basis is made over and over again.”
Using the plaintiffs’ reasoning, a music composer who is paid a fixed
amount for each work would not qualify as a “creative professional” because he
does the same thing over and over again: He starts with 88 tones and simply
arranges them in combinations that he hopes people will find pleasing. Nothing
“unique” there.
In fact, if one defines what is being done broadly enough then no task
qualifies as being “unique.” But entertaining a customer with a striptease and
conversation in a semi-private environment (like a VIP Room) is a far cry from
9

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 10 of 18

sitting on an assembly line and fastening a doohicky to a widget as it passes by.4/
Although defendants believe that the performance of unscripted striptease
entertainment is, self-evidently, “unique” and that this belief is supported by the
1998 USDOL Opinion Letter, the question of “uniqueness” – at best for the
plaintiffs – raises a question of fact that must be left for trial and – at best for the
defendants – is a matter of law which must be resolved in defendants’ favor.

5.

The entertainer’s job requires “invention, imagination, originality, or
talent ....”
Despite Mr. Henderson’s attempt to denigrate the degree of “invention,

imagination, originality, or talent” that his job as an entertainer requires, his
protestations ring hollow when one considers the degree to which those abilities
are required in order to convince the club’s gay customers that they should find
Mr. Henderson’s striptease sexually alluring or interesting ... when Mr. Henderson

4/

Interestingly, the Department of Labor Opinion Letter cited by the plaintiffs
distinguishes, for purposes of the determination of “uniqueness,” the
“artistic professionals” aspect of the exemption implying that persons
performing such duties are among those who were intended to be
encompassed in the definition of “unique.” (“The use of these professional
occupations to demonstrate this point suggests to us that the character or
nature of the job itself must be unique, and not simply that the performance
of the job vary from day to day.” Opinion Letter, 1998 WL 852761 (1998).)
10

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 11 of 18

is, in fact, straight, DE 84-8, Henderson depo, p. 32, ll. 1-8.
The plaintiffs’ other attempts to construe the regulations in a manner
favorable to their litigation position are similarly unavailing since those attempts
require giving the regulations an unnatural and contorted interpretation.

a.

Plaintiffs’ striptease and conversational entertainment of
customers is not “routine.”

The plaintiffs argue that their performances are “routine mental, manual,
mechanical or physical work,” DE 84-1, p. 13, demonstrating that they do not
come within the definition of an “artistic” or “creative” professional. Plaintiffs do
not cite to any facts of record that would bring VIP Room entertainment (as
opposed to table dances) within any FLSA definition of “routine” and, moreover,
the job cannot be “unique” (see ¶4.c., above) and “routine” simultaneously. Since
the plaintiffs’ job is characterized as being “unique,” this argument fails.

b.

No amount of “general manual or intellectual ability [or]
training” will prepare an individual to perform an alluring
striptease or engage in an entertaining conversation while nude.

The plaintiffs assert that they are performing “work which can be produced
by a person with general manual or intellectual ability and training,” DE 84-1,

11

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 12 of 18

p.14, and are therefore not exempt. No effort has been made, however, to describe
how any specific ability or training would equip someone to perform a striptease
or to convey the erotic message that the club’s entertainers communicate. In fact,
the plaintiffs only engage in linguistic jujitsu by citing cases that found the skill
involved in entertaining in an adult club insufficient to earn a designation as a
profession of an independent contractor. But no evaluation of skill level is either
necessary or appropriate (see ¶ 5.c., below) to determine whether an entertainer is
within the exemption at issue in this case. As was noted in defendants’ initial
memorandum, DE 81-1, pp. 8-15, and below, in ¶ 5.d., a striptease – what is often
referred to as “nude dancing” – is an exercise in the non-verbal communication of
an erotic message and this attribute (the nature of the message conveyed by a
striptease) has been held to be present as a matter of law.

c.

Performing a suggestive and stimulating striptease most certainly
requires a significant measure of “invention, imagination,
originality, and talent.”

Plaintiffs’ memorandum (DE 84-1), beginning on page 16, reads as though
they borrowed it from the plaintiffs in Harrell. It deserves the same response as
Judge Bucklew gave those plaintiffs:

12

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 13 of 18

Plaintiff's response to Defendant's argument is to reduce exotic dancing
to its most basic element, a veiled attempt at unveiling, and to separate this
overriding theme from its allegedly incidental dancing component ....
The Court acknowledges that a dancer's physical attributes may be
more important to Diamond A (or to any given customer) than a dancer's
ability to dance, but the Court cannot make the kind of distinction that
Plaintiff is requesting.16/
16//

See W.B. Yeats, "Among School Children" (1927) ("O body
swayed to music, O brightening glance, / How can we know the
dancer from the dance?"). For an entertaining and judicious treatment
of expression in exotic dance, from Richard Strauss' Salome (1905) to
Gypsy Rose Lee, see Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d
1081, 1089-95 (7th Cir.1990) (Posner, J., concurring); see also
Flashdance (Paramount 1983) (arc-welder by day and exotic dancer
by night gains admission to the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance).
Harrell v. Diamond A Entertainment, Inc.,
992 F.Supp., at 1355.
Defendants want to be clear on this point: They are not claiming that the
entertainers dance tangos or sambas for the customers (although a lambada might
not be out of the question). Neither are the entertainers likely to challenge
members of the Atlanta Ballet in the execution of an arabesque, a brisé, or a
cabriole (either petite or grande). What defendants are asserting is that the
entertainers perform a striptease in a way that they devise to convey an erotic
message for which they are rewarded monetarily.

13

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 14 of 18

The club’s entertainers are just doing what Beyoncé was doing when she
moved seductively to the music in a skimpy outfit while lip-syncing her way
through the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show; these entertainers are sending the
same erotic message.5/ The major differences are that the club’s entertainers do it
with significantly less-extravagant production values for a somewhat smaller
audience while wearing marginally fewer clothes and receiving not quite as many
dollars for their efforts. But they are all creative artistic professionals.

d.

That which is done by plaintiffs to entertain customers at
Swinging Richaards is recognized as a “field of artistic or creative
endeavor.”

Plaintiffs assert that “entertaining is not a recognized field of artistic or
creative endeavor,” DE 84-1, p. 19. While that may be true, the question is not
whether “entertaining” – broadly speaking – is such a field but whether the
activities engaged in by plaintiffs in seeking to entertain the club’s customers falls
within such a field. Plaintiffs boldly state:

Case 1:13-cv-03767-TWT Document 89 Filed 10/31/14 Page 15 of 18

[T]his case simply does not involve dancing. (Facts ¶¶ 10-30.) Again,
Plaintiffs in this case are strippers. (Facts ¶¶ 10-30.) They work at
Defendants’ strip club where they strip naked for money. (Facts ¶¶ 10-42.)
They can do this job without any training, experience, or ability, so long as
they are physically fit, meet Defendants’ appearance-based hiring criteria,
and are willing to disrobe in public. (Facts ¶¶ 18-25.) Plaintiffs’ primary job
duty is to strip, not dance, and dancing is not required in order to perform
the job.
DE 84-1, pp. 19-20.
Those assertions are, defendants believe, best answered by the Seventh
Circuit: It held, “as a matter of law,” that “[w]hile clearly not all conduct is
expression, dance as entertainment is a form of conduct that is inherently
expressive,” Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir.,
1990) (en banc), rev’d on other grounds sub nom., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc,
501 U.S. 56 (1991). What it expresses is an erotic message: “a striptease sends an
unadorned message to a male audience. It is a message of temptation and
allurement coupled with coy hints at satisfaction.” Miller, 904 F.2d, at 1089
(Cudahy, J., concurring).6/

More extensive excerpts from the opinions in Miller refuting plaintiffs’
points are set out in defendants’ memorandum in support of their summary
judgment motion at pages 13-15 (DE 81-1) and will not be repeated here.

AFTERWORD
Perhaps the most notable thing about plaintiffs’ response (and their
memorandum in support of their own motion) is what is lacking: any reasoned
analysis (or, for that matter, any attempt even to address) the arguments made by
defendants. Other than their flawed discussion of Harrell v. Diamond A Entm’t,
Inc., 992 F. Supp. 1343 (M.D. Fla. 1997), plaintiffs have not seen fit to mention
any of the cases cited by defendants nor have they addressed the arguments
advanced in the moving papers (except for an unreasoned rejection, DE 86, p.7).
In light of the utter failure of the plaintiffs to meet the defendants’ arguments,
defendants’ motion should be granted.7/
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant defendants’ motion
for summary judgment on the issue of exemption and should deny plaintiffs’
motion on the same issue.

7/

Perhaps the plaintiffs are improperly saving their best arguments for their
reply memorandum so that the defendants will not have an opportunity to
refute them. Defendants trust that the Court will not permit such a tactic to
succeed.
