CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE

On October 14, 2004, I conferred with Plaintiff's counsel, Brady Edwards,

multiple times about this motion. My partner, Teresa Valderrama, and I each explained the basis
of the motion, but Mr. Edwards said he could not form an opinion about whether to oppose the
motion without seeing the motion. I therefore faxed Mr. Edwards a copy of the brief supporting
this motion at 9:30 a.m. on October 15 and asked him to tell me by 1:30 p.m. whether the motion
was opposed. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Edwards said that he would also need to see the exhibits
and consider these materials over the weekend before he could state a position on the motion.
Accordingly, despite reasonable efforts, I have been unable to determine whether Mr. Edwards
opposes this motion. I assume that he does oppose it, and I will promptly notify the Court if I
learn that he does not.
