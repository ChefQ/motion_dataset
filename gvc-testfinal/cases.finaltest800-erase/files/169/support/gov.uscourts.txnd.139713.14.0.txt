Defendant O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. files this Brief in Support of Motion to
Transfer Venue Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404(a) and would show the Court as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff's counsel has stated to the media and to Defendant's counsel that
Plaintiff intends to pursue this case on a nationwide basis.' Because Plaintiff seeks to prosecute
this case as a nationwide collective action, this Court should exercise discretion under 28 U.S.C.
0x00A7 1404(a) to transfer this case to the United States District Court for the Western District of
Missouri--Southern Division. Transfer would materially advance the interests of justice and the
convenience of the witnesses and parties.

O'Reilly is an auto parts retailer. It owns and operates 1193 stores located in 18
states (38 judicial districts) throughout the country." Nothing ties the vast majority of these
stores, or their employees, to the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Rather, these
stores collectively have their greatest connection to the Southern Division of the Western District
of Missouri, seated in Springfield, Missouri, the location of O'Reilly's corporate headquarters.

Because O'Reilly is headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, that is where it makes
decisions regarding the payroll and timekeeping policies implicated by Salinas' allegation that,
on a nationwide basis, O'Reilly required its hourly-paid employees to work "off the clock."

O'Reilly's Human Resources department is in Springfield; thus, the key witnesses live there as

 

'  O'Reilly contends that this case cannot appropriately proceed as a nationwide collective action. O'Reilly has

no national policy or practice requiring that employees work overtime "off the clock." Nonetheless, because Salinas
and her lawyers clearly intend to prosecute this matter as a nationwide collective action (and, indeed, already have
nationally advertised it as such), O'Reilly is obliged to seek transfer to the venue appropriate to defend against such
a claim, even if the allegation is without merit: the centrally-located, corporate headquarters where corporate HR
policies are established, implemented and enforced; where the witnesses who are responsible for those policies
reside; and where the payroll records and personnel files for thousands of hourly employees dispersed across at least
18 states and 38 judicial districts are maintained.

2 These states include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,

Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

Case 3:04-cv-018614@ Document 14 Filed 10/15/04 oe 60f 19 PagelD 56

well. Similarly, O'Reilly's employment and payroll records from its 1193 stores are maintained
in Springfield, and Springfield is centrally located and more convenient than Dallas to most of
O'Reilly's stores.

These facts and others demonstrate that this case, in the context of a nationwide
collective action, is more convenient to litigate in Western District of Missouri, Southern
Division, and should be transferred there.

i. FACTS
A. The Lawsuit

On August 26, 2004, Plaintiff Anna Salinas, a former O'Reilly employee, filed
her Original Collective Action Complaint for herself and others similarly situated, alleging that
O'Reilly employees were required to work "off the clock" in violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act ("FLSA"). (Complaint 0x00A7 3.) Salinas resides in Midlothian, Texas, within the
Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. (/d. 42.) Salinas issued nationally-circulated press
releases touting her lawsuit as a nationwide collective action affecting 1183 stores in 18 states,
and soliciting witnesses and additional plaintiffs. (App. 001 - 006 (Press Releases).) Since
issuing those press releases nationally, three other O'Reilly ex-employees have filed consents in
this action, none of whom reside within the Dallas division: (1) Patrick Gruesbeck resides in
College Station, Texas, within the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division; (2) Donna
Seay lives in Watauga (Tarrant County), Texas, within the Northern District of Texas, Fort
Worth Division; and (3) Jay O'Neal is from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, within the Western
District of Oklahoma. (App. 009 (Affidavit of Steve Pope { 10).)

Plaintiff's counsel has stated, both to the media and to defense counsel, that
Plaintiff intends to prosecute this case as a nationwide collective action. (App. 001 - 006;

012 - 014 (Press Releases; Newspaper Article; 9/30/04 Letter).) Plaintiff's pleadings allege that

HOU02:1005331.7 2
Case 3:04-cv-01861@ Document 14 Filed 10/15/04 ee 7 of 19 PagelD 57

the putative class members "are those employees who are similarly situated to Plaintiff in that
their relevant job duties and pay provisions were similar to Plaintiff,' but provides no other
details concerning the basis for a collective action. (Complaint | 3.) Plaintiff held four non-
exempt positions during her tenure at O'Reilly: Retail Services Specialist, Night Manager,
Assistant Manager and Delivery Specialist. (App. 009 (Pope Aff. 0x00A7 11).) The putative class,
therefore, could include current and former employees holding any of these four positions at
1193 stores in 18 states (or 38 judicial districts) during the last two to three years, depending on
the applicable limitations period.'

As of October 6, 2004, O'Reilly employed approximately 5700 people nationwide
in the Retail Services Specialist, Assistant Manager and Delivery Specialist positions. (App. 009
(Pope Aff. 0x00A7 12).)* Turnover increases the number of these employees by about 80% on an
annual basis. (/d.) In other words, the putative collective action class could potentially consist
of a large number of people residing in many different judicial districts throughout the country.0x00B0

B. Corporate Information Pertaining to O'Reilly

O'Reilly is a Missouri corporation headquartered in Springfield, Missouri.
(App. 007 (Pope Aff. { 2); Complaint 4 4.) As the attached map shows, O'Reilly's 1193 stores
are located throughout the Midwest, South and Southeast. (App. 015.) Springfield is located

almost exactly in the geographical center of this area. (Id.)

 

> The FLSA limitations period is two years preceding the filing of the consent in a collective action, or three

years in the case of a willful FLSA violation. 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2617(c)(1)-(2). Plaintiff alleges that O'Reilly willfully
violated the FLSA. (Complaint { 13.) O'Reilly vigorously denies any, much less a willful, FLSA violation.
Nevertheless, Plaintiff's allegation of willfulness implicates a three-year limitations period, thus increasing the size
of the putative collective action class.

`  O'Reilly eliminated the Night Manager position earlier this year. Most employees in that job were reclassified

as either Assistant Managers or Retail Service Specialists. (App. 009 (Pope Aff. 0x00A7 12).)

> Plaintiff likely does not dispute this, as Plaintiff's counsel has already told the media that this case may involve

thousands of plaintiffs in 18 states, and that counsel believes FLSA violations within O'Reilly are "widespread."
(App. 001 - 006; 012 - 014 (Press Releases; Newspaper Article; 9/30/04 Letter).)

HOU02:1005331.7 3
Case 3:04-cv-0186 Document 14 `Filed 10/15/04 oe 8 of 19 `PagelD 58

O'Reilly's Human Resources department is based in Springfield. (App. 008
(Pope Aff. | 6).) No Human Resources employees work at the store level and, in fact, only a
handful of Human Resources employees work outside Missouri. (/d.) Only one O'Reilly
Human Resources employee is situated in Dallas. (/d.)

All significant decisions concerning the policies and procedures that will be
pertinent to this case (timekeeping, payroll and FLSA compliance) were made by the Human
Resources Department in Springfield. (App. 008 (Pope Aff. J 7).) All training programs on
timekeeping and FLSA compliance were developed in Springfield, and most, if not all, store
managers received their FLSA training in Springfield. (/d.) Moreover, all payroll records and
the personnel files of current and former employees are maintained or archived in Springfield.
(Id. | 8.) These documents will be important to both sides in this case, and considering the
purported scope of the plaintiff class, will undoubtedly be voluminous.

Ill. DISCUSSION AND AUTHORITIES

A. Transferring This Case to the Western District of Missouri Would Best Serve the
Convenience of the Parties and Witnesses and the Interest of Justice.

Transfer of this case to the Southern Division of the Western District of Missouri
will best serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice.(c) Through
Section 1404(a), Congress sought to "prevent the waste of `time, energy and money' and `to
protect litigants, witnesses and the public against unnecessary inconvenience and expense.'"

Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 616 (1964). The Court should consider "'all relevant

 

0x00A7 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404(a) provides:

For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court
may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been
brought.

This case could have been brought in the Western District of Missouri's Southern Division because O'Reilly
"resides" there. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1391. Because that prong of the venue test is met, the critical issue is "whether the
`convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice' requires" a venue transfer. In re: Horseshoe
Entm't, 337 F.3d 429, 433 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 826 (2003).

HOUO02:1005331.7 4
Case 3:04-cv-01861@ Document 14 Filed 10/15/04 re 9of19 PagelD 59

factors to determine whether or not on balance the litigation would more conveniently proceed
and the interests of justice be better served by transfer to a different forum.'" Jsbell v. DM
Records, Inc., No. Civ. A. 3:02-CV-1408G, 2004 WL 1243153, at *13 (N.D. Tex. June 4, 2004)
(quoting Peteet v. Dow Chem. Co., 868 F.2d 1428, 1436 (5th Cir. 1989)).

The relevant factors are: (1) the convenience of the material witnesses; (2) the
convenience of the parties; (3) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (4) where the
events at issue took place; (5) the availability of process to compel the presence of unwilling
witnesses; (6) the cost of obtaining the presence of witnesses; (7) calendar congestion, and (8)
the interests of justice in general. Isbell, 2004 WL 1243153, at *14. The decision to transfer a
case pursuant to Section 1404(a) is committed to the sound discretion of the district court judge.
Id.

On balance, these factors weigh in favor of transfer to the Western District of
Missouri, Southern Division.

1. The Convenience of the Material Witnesses Favors Missouri

"The convenience of the witnesses is arguably the most important factor in
deciding whether a case should be transferred pursuant to section 1404(a)." Reed v. Fina Oil &
Chem. Co., 995 F. Supp. 705, 714 (E.D. Tex. 1998). When evaluating convenience, courts
consider both the number of witnesses residing outside the district and the importance of their
testimony. See Apache Prods. Co. v. Employers Ins., 154 F.R.D. 650, 655 (S.D. Miss. 1994)
(noting that "[t]he court should take into account both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of
witness convenience"); Dupre v. Spanier Marine Corp., 810 F. Supp. 823, 825 (S.D. Tex. 1993)
(The "convenience of one key witness may outweigh the convenience of numerous less
important witnesses."). The human resources witnesses located in Springfield, whose knowledge

is integral to the issues implicated by a collective action, clearly would find Missouri more

HOUO02:1005331.7 5
Case 3:04-cv-01861@ Document 14 Filed 10/15/04 P@ 10 of 19 PagelD 60

convenient than Dallas. Additionally, Springfield's central location makes it more convenient,
or at least as convenient as, Dallas for most other anticipated witnesses in a collective action
context.

a. Non-party witnesses

The convenience and availability of non-party witnesses receive the most weight
in the convenience analysis. See Houston Trial Reports, Inc. v. LRP Publ'ns, Inc., 85 F. Supp.
2d 663, 668-69 (S.D. Tex. 1999). O'Reilly is unaware of any specific non-party witnesses that
either side expects to testify. The most likely category of necessary non-party witness will be
former store managers who supervised any opt-in plaintiffs. Because of the nationwide scope of
the class Plaintiff alleges, these witnesses could live all over the country. Thus, centrally-located
Springfield is just as convenient or more convenient, on the whole, than Dallas.

b. Party witnesses

The only witness Plaintiff has identified (besides herself, her attorneys and opt-in
plaintiff Gruesbeck) is David O'Reilly, Defendant's CEO. (App. 017 (PI1.'s Initial Disclosures).)
Mr. O'Reilly resides in Springfield, Missouri. (App. 007 (Pope Aff.  3).)

Presently, based solely on the generalized allegations of a nationwide collective
action and the requirement of a central policy or practice affecting all employees in such
instance, O'Reilly anticipates it will require testimony from four key witnesses, all of whom are
in Springfield:

(1) Jim Maynard, O'Reilly's Director of Team Member Relations, who has

knowledge of complaints of unpaid overtime (or the lack thereof), as well
as store manager training on FLSA requirements and compliance;

(2) Steve Pope, O'Reilly's VP for Human Resources, who has knowledge of
O'Reilly's personnel policies, including timekeeping and payroll policies;

(3) Charlie Stallcup, O'Reilly's Director of Training, who has knowledge of
corporate training on the timekeeping system; and
