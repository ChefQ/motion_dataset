PLAINTIFFS' RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE AND
BRIEF IN SUPPORT THEREOF

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

Plaintiff Anna Salinas ("Salinas"), individually and on behalf of those similarly
situated, files this Response to the Motion to Transfer Venue filed by Defendant O'Reilly
Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly'"), and Brief in Support Thereof, and would respectfully show the
Court as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On August 26, 2004, Salinas filed this collective action against O' Reilly' pursuant
to 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"). Salinas, who resides within the
Northern District of Texas, alleges that O'Reilly failed to pay her and other similarly situated
employees one and one-half times their regular rates for hours worked in excess of forty hours
per week. See Original Complaint at ff 1-3, 11, 13. In addition to Salinas, three individuals

have filed a notice of consent indicating that they desire to participate in the collective action

 

' O'Reilly is an auto parts retailer that "owns and operates 1193 stores located in 18 states (38
judicial districts) throughout the country." Brief in Support of Motion to Transfer Venue at 1; see also
map of O'Reilly store locations available at http://www.oreillyauto.com/B2C/home.locator?vehicle (Pl.
App. at 8). Although O'Reilly has stores throughout the central and southern United States, nearly one
third of these stores (381) are located in Texas. See O'Reilly's 2003 Annual Report at 18 (PI. App. at 28).
The state with the next largest number of stores is O'Reilly's home state of Missouri, which has 132
stores. Id.
"

Case 3:04-cv-01861-B Document 20 Filed 11/04/04 6 7 of 25 PagelD 157

against O'Reilly. See Notices of Consent Filed by Patrick Gruesbeck, Jay O'Neal, and Donna
Seay (Pl. App. at 1,4). These individuals reside in College Station, Texas, Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, and Watauga, Texas. See Joint Status Report at | 1.C. (Pl. App. at 69).

Although Salinas intends to pursue this case as a collective action, O'Reilly has
informed this Court that it "vigorously contests that the facts necessary for a nationwide
collective action exist." Joint Status Report at 2 (Pl. App. at 70); see also Brief in Support of
Motion to Transfer Venue at 1. O'Reilly has also taken the position that "the putative opt-in
plaintiffs do not become parties unless and until the Court determines their status to be similarly-
situated to that of the Plaintiff." Jd. at 1 (Pl. App. at 69). Thus, under O'Reilly's view of this
case, this action is, and will never be more than, a single plaintiff case brought by a resident of
the Northern District of Texas.

It is in this context that O'Reilly has filed its Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71404(a)." This Court has jurisdiction, and venue is proper. O'Reilly contests
neither. Rather, despite its position that this is a single plaintiff case that will not be certified as a
collective action, O'Reilly seeks transfer on the grounds that "in the context of a nationwide
collective action, it is more convenient to litigate in Western District of Missouri, Southern
Division." Brief in Support of Motion to Transfer venue at 2.

O'Reilly should not be permitted to have its cake and eat it, too. It is
disingenuous at best for O'Reilly to be seeking to transfer this case to its corporate headquarters

on the grounds that this is a nationwide collective action when it also contends that this is a

 

2 The Certificate of Conference for attached to O'Reilly's Motion to Transfer Venue states that "despite
reasonable efforts, I have been unable to determine whether Mr. Edwards opposes this motion." Motion
to Transfer Venue at 3. Counsel for Salinas believes that its request to see the attachments to O'Reilly's
Motion before forming an opinion on whether to oppose the motion was reasonable. Interestingly,
counsel for O'Reilly's also believes such requests are reasonable, at least when she is the one making the
request. See Email exchange between Teresa Valderrama and Michael Josephson (P1. App. at 76).

single plaintiff case. Although Salinas is a Texas resident and the current opt-in Plaintiffs (two
of whom are Texas residents) have elected to litigate this case in Texas, Defendant is attempting
to undermine these Plaintiffs' choice of forum and impose extreme costs on them by moving this
case to Missouri. Such a move is intended to complicate and frustrate Salinas' efforts to recover
the wages she has already worked hard to earn. Indeed, regardless of whether this Court
analyzes the venue transfer motion as one affecting a single plaintiff who resides in Texas, or as
nationwide collective action, O'Reilly has not met its heavy burden to demonstrate that the
interests of justice weigh in favor of transfer. Thus, for the reasons set forth below, O'Reilly's
Motion to Transfer Venue should be denied.
Il. ANALYSIS AND AUTHORITIES

28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404(a) provides that "[flor the convenience of parties and witnesses,
in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or
division where it might have been brought." A defendant who moves to transfer venue pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71404(a) bears the burden of proving that transfer is appropriate. Peteet v. Dow
Chemical Co., 868 F.2d 1428, 1436 (Sth Cir. 1989); Time v. Manning, 366 F.2d 690, 698 (Sth
Cir. 1966).

The factors the Court should consider when evaluating a motion to transfer venue
include: (1) the convenience of the parties; (2) the convenience of material witnesses; (3) the
availability of process to compel the presence of unwilling witnesses; (4) the cost of obtaining
the presence of witnesses; (5) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (6) calendar
congestion, (7) where the events in issue took place; and (8) the interests of justice. See, e.g.,
Gundle Lining Constr. Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 844 F.Supp. 1163, 1165 (S.D. Tex.

1994). However, when evaluating a motion to transfer venue, a plaintiff's choice of forum is
Case 3:04-cv-01861-B Document 20 Filed 11/04/04 Page 9of25 PagelD 159

highly esteemed, Menendez Rodriguez v. Pan American, 311 F.2d 429, 434 (Sth Cir. 1962), and
should be given substantial weight. Enserch International Exploration, Inc. v. Attock Oil Co.,
656 F. Supp. 1162, 1167 (N.D. Tex. 1987). Unless the balance of factors strongly favors the
moving party, the plaintiffs choice of forum should not be disturbed. Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert,
330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947); TIG Insurance Co. v. NAFCO Insur. Co., 177 F. Supp.2d 561, 568
(N.D. Tex. 2001). A court should not transfer venue where the result will be merely to shift the
expense and inconvenience from one party to the other. Jd; Enserch, 656 F. Supp. at 1167.
Because O'Reilly has not established that any of the above-mentioned factors clearly weigh in
favor of transfer, O'Reilly's Motion to Transfer Venue must be denied.

A. O'Reilly has not Established that the Convenience of the Parties Clearly Weighs in
Favor of Transfer to Missouri.

O'Reilly's argument that the convenience of the Plaintiffs weighs in favor of
transfer to Springfield, Missouri is wholly without support. First, Defendant improperly attempts
to discount the weight that should be accorded to a plaintiff's choice of forum in an FLSA
collective action. Brief in Support of Motion to Transfer Venue at 7. Second, Defendant argues
that "it will be just as convenient, or more convenient, [for potential opt-in plaintiffs] to travel to
centrally-located Springfield Missouri as to Dallas, Texas," and that the "convenience of the
many opt-in plaintiffs weighs in favor of a trial in Springfield, Missouri." Jd. at 7-8. Incredibly,
Defendant makes this second argument, which is without support, despite the fact that it opposes
certification of this matter as a collective action. Because O'Reilly's arguments are nothing
more than an attempt to shift the burden of litigating this case from one party to another,
O'Reilly's motion to transfer this case from the Salinas' home forum of Dallas, Texas to the

location of O'Reilly's corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri must be denied.
Case 3:04-cv-01861-B Document 20 Filed 11/04/04 `oe. of 25 PagelD 160

1. Contrary to O'Reilly's argument, plaintiffs' choice of forum in a collective
action is relevant to the venue analysis.

O'Reilly argues that because this is a collective action, Salinas' choice of forum is
irrelevant to the transfer analysis. See Brief in Support of Defendant's Motion to Transfer
Venue, at 7 (citing Eugene v. McDonalds Corp., No. 96 C 1469, 1996 WL 411444, at *2 (N.D.
Ill., July 18, 1996); Koster v. Lumbermans Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1997)? O'Reilly,
however, has misanalyzed the issue because it views this as a class action and not a collective
action.

The distinction between the a class action and a collective action is critical. In an
opt-out class action, the weight accorded to plaintiff's choice of forum is considerably reduced
because the non-representatives of the class essentially have the representative plaintiff's choice
of forum foisted upon them, even when the nominal plaintiffs role in the litigation is likely to be
quite minimal. See Bolton v. Tesoro Petroleum Corp., 549 F. Supp. 1312, 1313 - 1314 (ED. Pa.
1982).

On the other hand, in a collective action, filed pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b), the
Plaintiffs must opt into the collective action by affirmatively deciding to join the case. Thus, the
choice of forum is not "happenstance" or "fortuitous" as in the class action cases cited by the
Plaintiff. Instead, the Plaintiffs have made the affirmative choice that the venue they would
prefer is the Northern District of Texas. See Notices of Consent for Anna Salinas, Jay O'Neal,

Donna Seay, and Patrick Gruesback (PI. App. at 1, 4).

 

3 Of these two cases, only Eugene, which is an unreported case out of the Northern District of Illinois,
actually involves a FLSA collective action rather than a class action. As an unreported case from a
district court in another Circuit, Eugene should be accorded little or no weight by this Court. This is
particularly true in light of the fact that Eugene does not discuss the important distinctions between class
actions and collective actions as they pertain to the venue transfer analysis. See 1996 WL 411444 at *2.
