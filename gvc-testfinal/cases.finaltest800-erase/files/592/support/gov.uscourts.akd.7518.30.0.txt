UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA
ALBERT L. ALLEN,

Case No. 3:08-cv-0039-RRB-DMS
Petitioner,

vs.
GARLAND ARMSTRONG,
Respondent.

MOTION TO STAY HABEAS CASE
AND HOLD IT IN ABEYANCE
PENDING STATE COURT OUTCOME
or, in the alternative,
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
TO FILE OPPOSITION TO STATE’S
MOTION TO DISMISS
Filed on Shortened Time

Petitioner Albert Allen, by and through counsel Averil Lerman, Staff Attorney, moves
this court to stay further proceedings in this case, and to hold this case in abeyance until Mr. Allen’s
state court post-conviction proceedings are completed.
Albert Allen is presently litigating, pro se, a post-conviction relief proceeding in
Alaska state court, relating to the same conviction at issue in this case. That proceeding asserts that
he was not given an adequate post-conviction review in state court, and that the court should permit
him to prove that, and to prove that post-conviction relief was warranted. Allen v. State, 3AN-0810040 CI. Such a claim is permitted in Alaska under Grinols v. State, 74 P.3d 889 (Alaska 2003).
Mr. Allen has twice requested appointed counsel in his post-conviction case, and counsel was

Filed 03/20/09 Page 2 of 7

appointed, but withdrew on the basis that the court has to appoint different counsel under state law.
The court has not yet appointed different counsel for Mr. Allen. Mr. Allen filed another motion
requesting counsel, and served it on the state on February 8, 2009, but there has as yet been no
decision by the court. The pendency of this state post-conviction case is the basis for this motion
to stay and abey. This is addressed in more detail below.
Prior Proceedings
Albert Allen was charged with murder for killing a man who had previously
threatened him with death, and who had come to Allen’s door late at night, with another person, to
confront Allen. State v. Allen, 3AN-94-4614 CR. Allen was tried three times. The first trial
resulted in a hung jury. The second trial resulted in a first-degree murder conviction and a sentence
of 66 years. That conviction was reversed on direct appeal, however, because the jury had
wrongfully been permitted to hear improper and prejudicial evidence. Allen v. State, 945 P.2d 1233
(Alaska 1995). In the third trial, the jury acquitted Allen of first-degree murder, but convicted him
of second-degree murder. The court sentenced him, again, to a term of 66 years – the same sentence
that had been imposed for the erroneous first-degree murder conviction.
In each of the three trials, Allen testified regarding his defense of self-defense and
accident. At the sentencing, the defense requested a mitigated sentence on the basis that Allen had
been significantly provoked by the man who died, Devron Labat, and thus that Allen had acted under
some degree of duress or threat, and that the offense more resembled manslaughter than
second-degree murder, and thus deserved a sentence in the lower end of the sentencing range. At
the sentencing, however, the judge stated that he believed that Allen’s conduct was actually
first-degree murder, and Allen deserved the same sentence he received following his prior (reversed)

conviction for first-degree murder, notwithstanding the fact that Allen had been acquitted of murder
by the final jury. The sentence relied on the court’s factual conclusion that the man who was killed
had not been armed when he came to Albert Allen’s apartment, and that Allen had known that when
he chased the man. Allen v. State, 56 P.3d 683, 685 (Alaska App. 2002).1
Mr. Allen filed a merit appeal from his conviction, which was litigated through the
Alaska Court of Appeals and the Alaska Supreme Court. Mr. Allen then filed a post-conviction
relief application in state court, Allen v. State, 3AN-03-6451. The state moved to dismiss the postconviction case on the basis that Allen’s attorneys had not put forward enough evidence to raise an
issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. The case was dismissed by the superior court. Allen filed
appeals from that dismissal, ending with a Petition for Hearing to the Alaska Supreme Court, which
was denied on October 26, 2007.
Mr. Allen filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus signed by him (and given to the
prison mail) on or about February 26, 2008. Doc. 1. Counsel was appointed, and filed a
supplemental habeas petition for Mr. Allen on October 15, 2008. Doc. 19. On February 2, 2009,
the state filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Allen’s habeas petition. Doc. 24. The state’s motion to
dismiss is complex. The state identifies seven grounds for habeas relief identified by Allen in his
habeas petitions, and then identifies 11 arguments for why many of Allen’s claims should be
dismissed. Doc 24.
The two principle claims the state makes can be summarized. Both of these claims
concern Allen’s first ground for relief, that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel by his

This factual finding is at the heart of Mr. Allen’s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. See
Amended Habeas, Doc. 19.

trial attorneys because they failed to locate, interview, and/or subpoena three important witnesses.2
See Doc. 19, pp. 14-16. First, the state asserts that these claims should be dismissed because Allen
did not adequately present them to the Alaska appellate courts, and thus that they were not
exhausted. Doc. 24. Second, the state asserts that these claims should be dismissed because the state
post-conviction court had an independent and adequate basis under Alaska law for dismissing them
(namely that post-conviction counsel did not adequately plead them), and thus there should be no
federal habeas review. Id.
In addition to these arguments, the state’s motion to dismiss also asserts that Albert
Allen did not adequately exhaust his ineffective claim regarding his trial lawyer’s failure to obtain
the right self-defense instruction. Id.
Accordingly, the state’s dismissal motion asserts that Albert’s claims are either
unexhausted or were appropriately dismissed under state law because they were not adequately
presented to the state court. Alaska provides a post-conviction petitioner with a legal avenue in
which to insure that he has had an adequate post-conviction process. Allen is pursuing that option
right now, in state court, for the purpose of obtaining relief from the state court by adequately

These witnesses were Michelle Kary Arms, Jim Snyder, and Michelle Estell. Michelle Kary Arms
could have testified that she had previously heard the alleged victim, Devron Labat, threaten to shoot
Albert Allen. Jim Snyder was an eyewitness to the events that resulted in Labat’s death, and could
have testified that Labat had gone to Allen’s house that night with a gun, which Labat had passed
to his companion, Julie Yourell. Michelle Estell could have testified that she saw Julie Yourell that
night, after Labat had died, and that Yourell had a gun in her possession. None of these witnesses
were called by the defense. All of this testimony was central to Allen’s defense, that he was terrified
when he had been approached by Labat, and that he did not mean to kill him, but only to defend
himself. Allen’s intent was critical not only to his conviction, but also to his sentence.

presenting his post-conviction claims for review. This process is likely to substantially affect the
state’s claims that Allen has not exhausted his state remedies.
Allen disputes the state’s dismissal motion, but he recognizes that the present state
post-conviction proceeding is likely to either resolve Allen’s claim at the state level, or to permit
Albert to complete the process of exhausting his federal claims (to the extent that is necessary). For
either reason, it makes sense to proceed first with the state proceedings, and then with the federal
proceedings.
“Stay and Abey” Order Is Warranted
Under Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 102 S. Ct. 1198, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379 (1982), a
habeas petitioner can only obtain relief from a federal court if the claims in his habeas petition are
exhausted. Prior to the 1996 revision of the habeas statutes by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act [“AEDPA”], unexhausted or “mixed” petitions (petitions containing both
exhausted and unexhausted claims) were simply dismissed, with the idea that the petitioner could
finish exhausting the claims and then refile the habeas petition. The attenuated statute of limitations
added by the AEDPA required a different approach.
In Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 125 S. Ct. 1528, 161 L. Ed. 2d 440 (2005), the
United States Supreme Court approved the “stay and abey” procedure, allowing the district court to
stay a mixed petition rather than dismissing it, holding the federal proceeding in abeyance, and
permitting the petitioner to exhaust his unexhausted claims in state court. The decision to grant such
a motion is in the discretion of the District Court. Once the petitioner has exhausted the claims in
state court, the federal court can lift the stay and proceed with the litigation of all claims. This

procedure is appropriate when the unexhausted claims are not plainly meritless, and there is good
cause for the petitioner’s failure to exhaust state remedies.
It is more efficient and more appropriate for the federal court to evaluate Mr. Allen’s
habeas case after the state court issues are fully resolved, both as a matter of comity and as a matter
of judicial economy. It is appropriate to stay this action until such time as Mr. Allen’s state court
litigation is completed. Mr. Allen proposes that he be charged with notifying the federal court of the
status of his state court litigation, filing a brief status report every 90 days. He proposes that the
requested stay be imposed until 60 days after the date that he learns that the Alaska Supreme Court
has issued its final decision regarding his collateral attacks on his state conviction.
In the alternative, should the court not grant the stay-and-abey motion, Allen requests
an extension of time in which to oppose the state’s dismissal motion. The motion is actually
multiple dismissal motions, identifying numerous grounds (including non-exhaustion) for at least
six different claims made by Mr. Allen. Response to this motion requires an extended analysis of
the limitations of “independent and adequate” grounds for state court action, as well as an analysis
of the requirement that a federal habeas claim first have been “fairly presented” to the state courts.
The record in this case involves more than 10 years of litigation in at least six different litigations.
The stakes for Mr. Allen are extremely high. The alternative request for an extension of time is
supported by the Affidavit of Averil Lerman, attached hereto. Mr. Allen respectfully submits,
however, that the correct course of action is to stay this case until state post-conviction proceedings
are completed.
