Case No. 3:08-cv-0039-DMS
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO
STAY HABEAS CASE
AND NON-OPPOSITION TO
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF
TIME

Dismissal of this case should not be stayed. Prompt dismissal is the
only correct court action because all of Allen’s claims are unexhausted. See
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 731, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2554 (1991) (holding
that a federal habeas petition should be dismissed if the prisoner has not
exhausted state remedies as to any of his federal claims).
In his motion for a stay, Allen mistakenly relies on Rhines v. Weber,
544 U.S. 269, 125 S.Ct. 1528 (2005). [Doc. 30] Rhines’ application for habeas

Case 3:08-cv-00039-RRB-DMS Document 35

corpus relief in federal court included both claims that had been exhausted in
state court and others that had not. The Supreme Court approved staying the
federal habeas corpus action to allow Rhines to complete a pending state-habeas
DNA proceeding. 544 U.S. at 270, 125 S.Ct. at 1530-31. The Court permitted
the stay because the Antiterrorism and Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) had added a
one-year limitation period for filing federal habeas applications. 544 U.S. at
269, 125 S.Ct. at 1530. The stay permitted Rhines to present his unexhausted
claims to the state court without losing his right to federal habeas review on the
exhausted claims. Id.
Rhines has no applicability here because Allen has no claim before
this court in which he exhausted his state court remedies. As set out in the
respondent’s motion to dismiss Allen’s amended petition, Allen failed to present
all seven of the claims for habeas corpus relief first to the state courts. Also, as
to Allen’s second, third, and sixth claims, Allen procedurally defaulted in state
court on adequate and independent state-law grounds. [Doc. 24] Claims that
are dismissed on state-law grounds are also considered unexhausted and
therefore not a proper basis for habeas corpus relief. Cf. Zichko v. Idaho, 247
F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2001) (although applicant had adequately presented
federal claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to state courts, the fact that his
claim was procedurally defaulted under state law precluded him from
maintaining his claim for habeas corpus relief). Because none of Allen’s seven
2

Filed 04/03/09 Page 3 of 7

claims were properly presented in state court and because three of those claims
were decided on independent and adequate state law grounds, there is no basis
for this court to consider whether the state court made an unreasonable
application of established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. See
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 364, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1498 (2000).
In Rhines, the Supreme Court did not in any way suggest that it was
modifying the Coleman rule that a petition that contains all unexhausted claims
should be dismissed. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has expressly declined to
extend Rhines to a case in which the federal habeas petition contains only
unexhausted claims, even where the record showed that the petitioner could
have included exhausted claims in his petition. See Raspberry v. Garcia, 448
F.3d 1150, 1154, (9th Cir. 2006). Thus, there is not a single claim for this court
to properly retain in abeyance while Allen pursues another post-conviction relief
action in state court.
Even if this court should determine that Allen’s petition includes
exhausted claims, Allen’s motion for a stay should be denied. In Rhines the
Supreme Court authorized district courts to stay a mixed petition only in a
limited circumstance. 544 U.S. at 273-75, 277-78, 125 S.Ct. at 1533-35. The
Supreme Court cautioned that if the stay-and-abeyance procedure were used too
frequently, the AEDPA would be undermined. Id. at 277-78, 125 S.Ct. at 1535.
To obtain a stay of a mixed petition, the petitioner has the burden to establish
3

Case 3:08-cv-00039-RRB-DMS Document 35

Filed 04/03/09 Page 4 of 7

(1) good cause for his failure to exhaust his state court remedies, (2) that his
unexhausted claims are not meritless, and (3) that he has not intentionally
engaged in dilatory litigation tactics. Id; and see Carter v. Friel, 415 F.Supp.2d
1314, 1317 (D. Utah 2006) (petitioner, as movant, has burden to show he is
entitled to a stay under Rhines factors).
In Rhines the Supreme Court did not explain the showing necessary
for a petitioner to establish good cause for the stay of a federal petition while he
exhausts claims in state court. Hernandez v. Sullivan, 397 F.Supp.2d 1205,
1206 (C.D. Cal. 2005). The Supreme Court, however, has stated that “[a]
petitioner’s reasonable confusion about whether a state filing would be timely
would ordinarily constitute ‘good cause’ for him to file” a protective petition in
federal court. Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 416, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 1813
(2005). The Ninth Circuit has held that good cause for a stay under Rhines does
not require a petitioner to show that extraordinary circumstances prohibited him
from exhausting his claims. Jackson v. Roe, 425 F.3d 654, 661-62 (9th Cir.
2005). District courts in the Ninth Circuit have applied a range of standards for
determining good cause for a stay under Rhines. In Hernandez v. Yates, ___
F.Supp.2d ___, 2007 WL 2221058 *1 (E.D. Cal. August 1, (2007), the court
applied an “excusable neglect” criteria which took into account factors such as
length of delay, whether delay was caused by factors beyond the petitioner’s
control, good faith, and prejudice to the respondent. Yet another court applied
4

Case 3:08-cv-00039-RRB-DMS Document 35

Filed 04/03/09 Page 5 of 7

the standard for procedural default law, requiring that the petitioner show that
the failure to exhaust state court remedies resulted from an “objective factor
external to the petitioner” that could not fairly be attributed to him. See
Hernandez v. Sullivan, 397 F.Supp.2d 1205, 1207 (C.D. Cal. 2005). But good
cause for the failure to exhaust state court remedies is not established simply by
a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Carter, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1318-19.
Allen’s motion for a stay makes no attempt to establish good cause
for his failure to exhaust his state court remedies as to each of the seven claims
in his federal habeas petition. See Carter, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1315 (the factors in
Rhines must be applied to each of the petitioner’s habeas corpus claims).
Neither does Allen’s motion attempt to show that his unexhausted claims are not
meritless and that he has not intentionally engaged in dilatory litigation tactics.
Furthermore, Allen has not even shown that the claims pending before the state
court are the same unexhausted claims that he has made to this court.
Therefore, even if Allen’s petition included both exhausted and unexhausted
claims, Allen has failed to satisfy the Rhines’ requirements for a stay.

Conclusion
This court should make a determination that the Allen did not
exhaust his state court remedies as to the seven claims for habeas corpus relief
pending before this court. This court should further determine that because
Allen did not exhaust his state court remedies as to these claims, no valid reason
exists to stay Allen’s petition for habeas corpus relief in this court. Allen’s
motion for a stay should be denied. The respondent does not oppose Allen’s
request that the time for his response to the pending motion to dismiss be
extended. [Doc. 24]
