Averil Lerman, being first duly sworn upon oath, deposes and states:
1.

I am an attorney in the office of the Federal Public Defender assigned to assist

in representing defendant in the above-captioned case.
2.

The state’s motion to dismiss Mr. Allen’s habeas petition is a complex

motion, or group of motions, because the state seeks to dismiss each of Mr. Allen’s claims

for relief, generally for several different reasons. Regarding Mr. Allen’s assertion that he
was deprived of effective assistance of trial counsel as a result of trial counsel’s failure to
obtain three necessary witnesses at trial, for example, the state asserts first that those claims
were not exhausted at the state level, and second that the state court dismissed those claims
on the basis of an independent and adequate state ground. Doc. 24. As to Mr. Allen’s claim
that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to an inadequate self-defense
instruction, the state asserts that the claim was not exhausted at the state level. Id. As to
Allen’s claim that the Alaska state courts violated due process by refusing to review his
sentence, when other similarly-situated defendants were granted appellate review, the state
asserts that Allen has not adequately exhausted his claim. Id.
3.

I had hoped to be able to oppose the state’s motion to dismiss quickly,

but as I reviewed the motion, and researched the areas it raised, two things became clear to
me.
4.

First, I recognized that Mr. Allen’s post-conviction processes in Alaska

state court are ongoing, and that a post-conviction case has been again opened in connection
with the same conviction at issue here. I also recognized the extent to which his recent postconviction case raises issues directly relevant to the issues raised by the state motion to
dismiss, insofar as Allen’s claims are that he was not given an adequate post-conviction
review because his post-conviction attorney did not do everything that should have been done
(a valid claim in Alaska which, if successful, would entitle Mr. Allen to proceed with his

initial post-conviction litigation). It appeared to me that proceeding on the federal habeas
in advance of the completion of Mr. Allen’s state post-conviction process would be
extremely inefficient, and against Mr. Allen’s interests.
5.

Second, I recognized that responding to the state’s motion(s) will require

extended legal research and analysis regarding what it means to have “fairly presented” an
issue for decision to the state courts (in response to the non-exhaustion claim), and regarding
what an “independent” and “adequate” state court ground is, and what it is not (in response
to the state’s alternative claim). This response will require a significant amount of time.
6.

I have not had time to complete my work on this motion, due to

competing deadlines. I filed a 51-page brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on
February 6, 2009, in Noyakuk v. Turnbull, No. 08-35946. On February 12, 2009, I filed a
Second Amended Petition for Habeas Corpus and two oppositions to motions to dismiss in
Mute v. Stolc, No. 4:08-cv-10. On February 13, 2009, I filed Objections to Initial Report and
Recommendation in Edwin v. Schmidt, 3:08-cv-4. On February 20, 2009, I filed a motion
to stay deadlines in this case. I was occupied with casework for other clients, and with work
on an independent project, as well as medical care, during the last week of February. I filed
a 43-page brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 13, 2009, in Wright v.
Volland, No. 08-35724, which was prepared on an expedited basis pursuant to court order.
The briefing and argument of the Wright v. Volland appeal have been expedited by the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals. I will receive the state’s brief on Friday, March 27, 2009, and my
