Case No. 5:12-cv-299 RS-EMT

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT JACKSON COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD’S MOTION FOR
SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE 11

COMES NOW, Plaintiffs, by and through counsel, and responses as follows:
1.

“If parents of a disabled child are not satisfied with a proposed IEP or "any matter

relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the
provision of a free appropriate public education to such child," 20 U.S.C. §
1415(b)(6)(A), the IDEA provides parents a right to "an impartial due process hearing"
before the state or local educational agency, id. § 1415(f)(1)(A). In the event of an
adverse outcome at the hearing level, the parents may bring a civil action in federal
district court or a state court of competent jurisdiction. Id. § 1415(i)(2).” Phillip C. v.
Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Educ. No. 11-14859, D.C. Docket No. 2:07-cv-00756-RRA(11th
Cir., 2012 (AL))

2.

The right to bring action in this court when parents are not satisfied with any

matters listed is absolute. When Plaintiffs filed their due process request in April 2012

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 2 of 19

in this case, STUDENT had lost another eighteen months of educational opportunity.
He was not mastering skills or academic content for classes he needs to graduate with a
regular diploma; was coming up on a summer without any of the services recommended
in his latest evaluation; and Jackson County School Board (“JCSB”) had not just refused
to do what the IDEA required, but also was retaliating by not giving accommodations so
STUDENT could have audio texts and use his Livescribe Smart Pen so he could refer to
what the teacher said about assignments and content, when he didn’t remember. JCSB
was not even allowing MOTHER to have IEP meetings — this over JCSB’s decision
after MOTHER complained about a staff member, denying her permission to record that
she originally needed because STUDENT’s other parents wanted to be able to participate
but could not attend the meetings, and then needed to get help increasing her
effectiveness in advocating, and because the stress of her interaction with the school
district was affecting her health and memory; and ultimately because she needed to
record to have the tools to effectively petition the school board, and and ALJ or court for
redress. And JCSB was not proposing any IEP’s without MOTHER’s participation
either. MOTHER saw no way to rescue the summer services and last two years before
STUDENT would need the missing skills to successfully transition to college, other than
to seek injunctive relief and redress for other claims in the same time frame.

3.

JCSB seems to have admitted that the stay put argument put forth to support this

Rule 11 motion for sanctions was insufficient to support that Plaintiffs’ Amended
Complaint failed to state a claim: JCSB’s 12(b)(6) motion [Dkt. 24] did not raise that
argument.

4.

The ALJ’s final order in the administrative due process hearing gives supporting

caselaw for Plaintiffs seeking redress in this court.

The ALJ wrote, “The First Circuit

viewed the mandatory annual review of the IEP as an ongoing obligation of a school even
while litigation is pending. The Court reiterated this principle when it stated that school
districts cannot avoid their IDEA duties by not reviewing a child's IEP during "stay-put,"
as holding otherwise would reward school districts for "misfeasance or nonfeasance in
providing appropriate education services" during a "stay-put" placement.” [DOAH 121273E Final Order, p. 5] and “Thus, since the Division does not have injunctive
authority, the only remedies for a stay-put Individual Education Program (“IEP”), which
no longer meets the educational needs of the child, is for the parties to either agree to a
change in placement or for one party to seek a preliminary injunction. Wagner, supra.”
[Id. 6-7] It is not unreasonable or frivolous to do precisely what the ALJ recommended
be done.

5.

Recently, the Ninth Circuit case also upheld a school district’s obligation to

update Individual Education Programs (“IEP”) while litigation is pending. Anchorage
School District v. M.P., No. 10-36065, D.C. No. 3:09-cv-00189-TMB, 8338- (9th Cir.
July 19, 2012) gives additional support to Plaintiff’s effort to revise or overturn CP v.
Leon County School Board, 483 F.3d 1151 (11th Cir., 2007) if the court were to find that
CP is applicable to this case, despite the factual differences (see #6-7 below):

[5] Here, it is beyond dispute that M.P.'s parents were zealous
advocates for their son. Due to their ongoing concerns about the adequacy
of the educational opportunities and services provided by the ASD, M.P.'s
parents filed four administrative complaints in August and September
Page 3 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 4 of 19

2008 and obtained a "stay put" order in connection with a then-pending
administrative proceeding. Having reviewed the record, we are aware that
this zealousness probably contributed to their strained relationship with
the ASD. Yet it would be antithetical to the IDEA's purposes to penalize
parents—and consequently children with disabilities—for exercising the
very rights afforded to them under the IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. §
1400(d)(1)(B) (explaining that one of the IDEA's purposes is "to ensure
that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are
protected").
[6] Therefore, when the ASD received M.P.'s parents' extensive
revisions to the ASD's February 2008 draft IEP, the ASD had two options:
(1) continue working with M.P.'s parents in order to develop a mutually
acceptable IEP, or (2) unilaterally revise the IEP and then file an
administrative complaint to obtain approval of the proposed IEP. ...But the
ASD could not simply ignore its affirmative duty under the IDEA by
postponing its obligation to revise the outdated IEP. Cf. N.B., 541 F.3d at
1209. Endorsing such an outcome would force M.P.'s parents to make a
Hobson's choice: accept the ASD's proposed IEP despite its deficiencies or
forego even modest improvements to M.P.'s educational program.
Accordingly, we conclude that the ASD's "take it or leave it" approach
contravened the purposes of the IDEA, which was enacted to ensure that
all children with disabilities receive a FAPE, and that the rights of eligible
children and their parents are protected. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(d)(1)(A)-(B).
[7] We acknowledge that the ASD's ability to revise the IEP was
necessarily constrained by the "stay put" order, which required that the
ASD maintain M.P.'s writing educational placement for the duration of the
2006-07 academic year. But the mere existence of the "stay put" order did
not excuse the ASD from its responsibility to have a statutorily compliant
IEP in place at the beginning of each school year. 20 U.S.C. §
1414(d)(2)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.323(a). Indeed, to conclude otherwise
would vitiate the purpose of the "stay put" provision, which was designed
to "strip schools of the 'unilateral authority they had traditionally
employed to exclude disabled students . . . from school' and to protect
children from any retaliatory action by the agency." Johnson ex rel.
Johnson v. Special Educ. Hearing Office, 287 F.3d 1176, 1181 (9th Cir.
2002) (quoting Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 323 (1988)). [8] The "stay
put" order meant only that the ASD could not change M.P.'s "educational
placement," which we have held "means the general educational program
of the student." N.D. ex rel. Parents Acting as Guardians Ad Litem v.
Haw. Dep'tof Educ., 600 F.3d 1104, 1116 (9th Cir. 2010). We have
explained that "a change in educational placement relates to whether the
student is moved from one type of program—i.e., regular class—to
another type—i.e., home instruction." Id. Or it may also occur "when there
Page 4 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 5 of 19

is a significant change in the student's program even if the student remains
in the same setting." Id. For purposes of our discussion, it is not necessary
to further define this term. We emphasize only that the ASD can satisfy its
statutory obligations to review and revise M.P.'s IEP without effecting a
change in his educational placement for writing instruction. Thus, we hold
that updating an eligible student's present level of academic achievement
and functional performance and establishing corresponding goals and
objectives does not qualify as a change to a student's educational
placement, so long as such revisions do not involve changes to the
academic setting in which instruction is provided or constitute significant
changes in the student's educational program.
6.

Plaintiffs did not raise the stay put issue at all in this matter. Plaintiffs

specifically did not claim stay put in its original due process request in April 2012 or in
November 2010, except to avoid the proposed placement in a learning strategies class, reimposition of an aide, and maintenance of the few accommodations that JCSB had agreed
to. And Plaintiffs do not claim stay put in the Amended Complaint in this current case.
It is the affirmative defense JCSB raised at the administrative due process level for why it
has not complied with IDEA statute and regulations requiring updated annual IEPs.
Plaintiffs cannot be responsible for attorney fees for the costs of JCSB’s raising
affirmative defenses. This is particularly true when JCSB is ignoring totally its
continuing affirmative obligations under the IDEA (as well as Section 504).

7.

And CP v. Leon County School Bd. Florida, 483 F.3d 1151 (11th Cir., 2007) was

not a case in which parents sought injunctive relief, so one cannot definitively determine
it applies to the same end in a case like the present one in which MOTHER did not claim
stay put, and where Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief.

Page 5 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 6 of 19

8.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act does not lend itself to blanket

decisions about appropriateness of educational services. IDEA claims have been denied
class certification under Rule 23 because they require individualized fact finding and
determination. Miller v. Bd. of Ed. Albuquerque Public Schools, 55 F.Supp.2d 1286,
1993-7, DNM 2006. Therefore by extension the applicability of the ruling in CP v. Leon
County School Board in which the court found that parents had invoked stay put, to this
case, where MOTHER explicitly did not, requires individual fact finding too. Seeking
that in court cannot be considered frivolous.

9.

In T.R. v. St. Johns Co.Sch.District, 50 IDELR 284, the Middle District of

Florida denied a Rule 11 motion against the school district for seeking attorney fees in its
answer, claiming the complaint was frivolous. The Middle District said that because
IDEA has a clause shifting fees to a prevailing party, fees could be awarded under that
clause, if appropriate, and the therefore the Rule 11 motion was denied, as JCSB’s
motion in this case should be. (Given that this court in the NDFL 5:12-294 case, stayed a
motion for fees on the same grounds, for the same reasons, it is a puzzle why JCSB
brought this Rule 11 Motion at all, just a few weeks later.)

10.

This is consistent with the Advisory Comments to Rule 11: “...In cases brought

under statutes providing for fees to be awarded to prevailing parties, the court should not
employ cost-shifting under this rule in a manner that would be inconsistent with the
standards that govern the statutory award of fees, such as stated in Christiansburg
Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978).”

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 7 of 19

11.

“The reason that attorney's fees are awarded to successful plaintiffs as a matter of

course where § 1988 applies is that in civil rights cases plaintiffs are "the chosen
instrument of Congress." Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 418, 98 S.Ct. at 699. Congress has
decided to implement its civil rights laws by effectively deputizing individuals to act as
"private attorney generals" while they pursue their own interests as plaintiffs. Newman v.
Piggie Park Enter., Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968).
Reimbursing successful plaintiffs for the cost of their attorneys out of the losing
defendants' pockets serves a dual function: it provides an incentive for bringing the
lawsuits, and it adds to the costs of those who violate the civil rights of others. Id.;
Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 418-19, 98 S.Ct. at 699.

12.

“By contrast, a victorious defendant in a civil rights action is not the "chosen

instrument of Congress," few defendants need any incentive to defend themselves when
sued, and a losing plaintiff in a civil rights case has not been found to have violated
anyone's civil rights. Hence the rule announced in Christiansburg that defendants who
win civil rights lawsuits generally cannot recover their attorney's fees from plaintiffs.”
Young v. New Process Steel, LP, 419 F.3d 1201, 1205 (11th Cir., 2005)

13.
“[9]There is little case law governing the IDEA’s provisions allowing school
districts to recover attorney’s fees. We’ve previously noted that the language of the
IDEA’s fee-shifting statute is “nearly identical” to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the general feeshifting provision for federal civil rights cases. See Aguirre v. L.A. Unified Sch. Dist.,
461 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir. 2006). And the IDEA’s language granting fees to
prevailing defendants is nearly identical to the standard the Supreme Court developed in
Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421-22 (1978), which is now the
standard for awarding fees to prevailing defendants in civil rights cases. See Hughes v.
Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 14 (1980) (per curiam). Compare 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)
(permitting award of fees if suit was “frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation”),
Page 7 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 8 of 19

with Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 421 (permitting award of fees if suit was “frivolous,
unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith”).
“[10] The IDEA’s legislative history confirms that Congress fashioned section
1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II) after the Christiansburg standard. See 150 Cong. Rec. S5250, S5349
(daily ed. May 12, 2004) (statement of Sen. Gregg) (“The first part of the amendment
comes from the U.S. Supreme Court case of [Christiansburg] . . . .”). The legislative
history further reveals that section 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III) “comes from another well
established Federal law: Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.” Id.; see Fed. R. Civ. P.
11(b) (subjecting parties to sanction for filing pleadings with an “improper purpose, such
as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation”).
Thus, we rely on Christiansburg and Rule 11 cases to determine whether the district
court abused its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to the school district against the
parents and their lawyer.” RP ex rel. CP v. Prescott Unified School Dist., 631 F. 3d 1117,
1124 (9th Cir. 2011)(in holding that the district court did so abuse its discretion)

14.
“...[I]t is important that a district court resist the understandable temptation to
engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately
prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation. This kind of
hindsight logic could discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a
prospective plaintiff be sure of ultimate success. No matter how honest one's belief that
he has been the victim of discrimination, no matter how meritorious one's claim may
appear at the outset, the course of litigation is rarely predictable. Decisive facts may not
emerge until discovery or trial. The law may change or clarify in the midst of litigation.
Even when the law or the facts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset, a party
may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit.” Christiansburg Garment Co
v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54
L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)

15.

"The fact that a plaintiff may ultimately lose his case is not in itself a sufficient

justification for the assessment of fees." Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173,
178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) “Allegations that, upon careful examination, prove legally
insufficient to require a trial are not, for that reason alone, "groundless" or "without
foundation" as required by Christiansburg.” Id. 15.

16.
"In determining whether a suit is frivolous, 'a district court must focus on whether
the case is so lacking in arguable merit as to be groundless or without foundation rather
Page 8 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 9 of 19

than whether the claim was ultimately successful.'” Id. at 1189 (quoting Jones v. Texas
Tech University, 656 F.2d 1137, 1145 (5th Cir.1981) (holding that unless the district
court finds all testimony to be "absolutely incredible, and pure fabrication," its finding of
frivolity cannot be sustained)).” Bruce v. City of Gainesville, Ga., 177 F.3d 949, 952
(C.A.11 (Ga.), 1999)

17.
“This Circuit, recognizing that determinations regarding frivolity are to be made
on a case-by-case basis, has identified several factors to help inform that determination,
among them: "(1) whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case; (2) whether the
defendant offered to settle; and (3) whether the trial court dismissed the case prior to trial
or held a full-blown trial on the merits." Sullivan v. School Board of Pinellas County, 773
F.2d 1182, 1189 (11th Cir.1985). As this Court noted in Sullivan, however, "[w]hile
these general guidelines can be discerned from the case law, they are general guidelines
only and not hard and fast rules. Determinations regarding frivolity are to be made on a
case-by-case basis." Sullivan, 773 F.2d at 1189. Bruce v. City of Gainesville, Ga., 177
F.3d 949, 952-3 (C.A.11 (Ga.), 1999)

18.

Cohen v. World Omni Fin. Corp. (11th Cir., 2012)(not frivolous when 2 of 4

factors weighed against defendant, because he made a prima facie case) See also
Quintana v. Jenne, 414 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiff’s
discrimination claim was not frivolous, despite her inability to rebut the defendant’s
legitimate reason for failing to promote her, because she had established a prima facie
case).

19.
“Simply because the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary
judgment does not mean that the plaintiffs' action was frivolous.” O'Neal v. DeKalb
County, Ga., 850 F.2d 653, 658 (C.A.11 (Ga.), 1988)

20.
“Another factor we consider in a § 1988 case is the attention given to the claim: a
claim is not frivolous when it is "meritorious enough to receive careful attention and
review." Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 787 (11th Cir. 1991).

21.

Rule 11 Advisory Comments also state: “Since the purpose of Rule 11 sanctions

is to deter rather than to compensate, the rule provides that, if a monetary sanction is
imposed, it should ordinarily be paid into court as a penalty. ... Moreover, partial
reimbursement of fees may constitute a sufficient deterrent with respect to violations by
persons having modest financial resources.” Plaintiffs’ counsel is of such modest means,
and did do due diligence. (See attached affidavit.)

22.

JCSB’s Motion for Sanctions misleads the court as to the claims raised in

Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint, which include claims for injunctive relief seeking an
appropriate IEP under IDEA going forward; declaratory relief under the First
Amendment concerning recording; one count for denial of free and appropriate public
education under IDEA; one count for discrimination under Section 504, because no
matter what IDEA required or didn’t, JCSB had a continuing obligation under Section
504 to meet STUDENT’s needs as adequately as the needs of nondisabled students are
met; and one count for retaliation under IDEA, and retaliation under Section 504.

23.

JCSB’s affirmative defense of “stay put” issue is and would not be dispositive on

Plaintiffs’ Section 504 retaliation and discrimination claims, or IDEA retaliation claims,
or Plaintiffs claims under the First Amendment, all of which ARE claims made in
Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. It is not unfrequent that rulings find retaliation even
when the underlying complaint is not upheld.

24.

A brief history and overview of the civil rights laws under which claims are made

in this case starts with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protected people of color from
Page 10 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 11 of 19

discrimination. It wasn’t until 1973, that a statute with identical word except that it
applied to protect those with disabilities was passed, included among other language
addressing work opportunity. (Protection under Title IX for women was passed in 1972.)
This was based on the same notion that civil rights for blacks was founded on: that no
person should be denied the opportunity to become what they dreamed to the full extent
they were able to do so, certainly not because of a condition or label.

25.

The language of Section 504 is just a single paragraph:

No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as
defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his
disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of,
or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by
any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.

26.

“For the first time, the exclusion and segregation of people with disabilities was

viewed as discrimination. Previously, it had been assumed that the problems faced by
people with disabilities, such as unemployment and lack of education, were inevitable
consequences of the physical or mental limitations imposed by the disability itself.
Enactment of Section 504 evidenced Congress' recognition that the inferior social and
economic status of people with disabilities was not a consequence of the disability itself,
but instead was a result of societal barriers and prejudices. As with racial minorities and
women, Congress recognized that legislation was necessary to eradicate discriminatory
policies and practices.” The History of the ADA: A Movement Perspective, Arlene
Mayerson, 1992, DREDF, http://dredf.org/publications/ada_history.shtml

Page 11 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 12 of 19

27.

Section 504 regulations require public schools to provide free appropriate public

education. But that term is defined specifically in Section 504, in a way that is different
from the IDEA language: Section 504 requires that:

(a) General. A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary
education program or activity shall provide a free appropriate public
education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient’s
jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person’s handicap.
(b) Appropriate education. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the
provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or
special education and related aids and services that (i)are designed to
meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as
adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii)
are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of §§
104.34, 104.35, and 104.36 [which are procedural and substantive
requirements that schools prove they cannot educate students in the
regular environment before placing them in more restrictive ones, among
other things. C.F.R. 104.34 [Emphasis added]

28.

After Section 504 was passed, it was followed by the Education for All

Handicapped Children in 1975, which is the forerunner of IDEA. This was a spending
statute, giving schools some funds to address a particular subset of needs in thirteen
specifically named categories of disability. IDEA’s definition of free appropriate public
education is different from Section 504, in that it is less specific, requiring education that
meets the state educational standards, without the Section 504 requirement of meeting
students with disabilities needs as adequately as the needs of nondisabled students are
met. But both require provision of special education, related services, and
accommodations in the least restrictive environment.

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 13 of 19

29.

Because schools districts received some funding under IDEA, some have come to

believe that they are only required to provide special education under IDEA. But that is
simply not the case.

30.

In 1990, the ADA was passed prohibiting the private sector, and non-federal

grantees, from discriminating against those with disabilities, and making protection from
discrimination on the basis of disability a civil right, in addition to a grant assurance
requirement. It includes language prohibiting retaliation1, which courts have inferred
under Section 504, and IDEA and other statutes. (See S Shotz v. City of Plantation, Fla.,
344 F.3d 1161 (11th Cir., 2003), M.T.V. v. Dekalb County School Dist., 446 F.3d 1153
(11th Cir., 2006))

31.

The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), determined that

IDEA preempted claims under Section 504, describing IDEA as "a comprehensive

1

(a) Retaliation
No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act
or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified,
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this
chapter.
(b) Interference, coercion, or intimidation
It shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the
exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed, or on account
of his or her having aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,
any right granted or protected by this chapter.
(c) Remedies and procedures
The remedies and procedures available under sections 12117, 12133, and 12188 of this title shall
be available to aggrieved persons for violations of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, with
respect to subchapter I, subchapter II and subchapter III, respectively. 42 USC § 12203
Page 13 of 15

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 32 Filed 01/23/13 Page 14 of 19

scheme set up by Congress to aid the states in complying with their Constitutional
obligations to provide public education to children with disabilities."

32.

In response, Congress thereafter inserted into IDEA Section 1415(l) which re-

establishes the right to bring claims under all of the statutes protecting students with
disabilities. It reads:

(l) Rule of construction Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the
Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C.
12101 et seq.], title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 790 et
seq.], or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with
disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws
seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter, the procedures
under subsections (f) and (g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as
would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter. 20
U.S.C. 1415(l)
And therefore, even if Plaintiffs were held to have violated Rule 11 or to owe
JCSB fees under IDEA, and the court were to have ordered payment thereof, it could
only be the amount attributed to that issue.

33.

Granting JCSB’s motion would be premature. “The time when sanctions are to

be imposed rests in the discretion of the trial judge. However, it is anticipated that in the
case of pleadings the sanctions issue under Rule 11 normally will be determined at the
end of the litigation....” Baker v. Alderman, 158 F.3d 516, 523 (C.A.11 (Fla.), 1998)

34.

In this case, the evidence is clear that JCSB’s motion for Rule 11 Sanctions must

be denied. It is not untimely to do that.

THEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that JCSB’s Motion for Sanctions
under Rule 11 be denied.
