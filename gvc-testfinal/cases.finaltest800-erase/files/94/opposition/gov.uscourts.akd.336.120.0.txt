Opposition to "UNITED STATES' MOTION FOR DISCOVERY SANCTIONS
PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 37.

Come now Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes ("the Hymes") with this
Opposition to "UNITED STATES' MOTION FOR DISCOVER SANCTIONS
PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 37 . Opposition").

Jennifer D. Auchterlonie ("Auchterlonie") who represents the "UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA" ("USA"), being an unknown entity to date not arising under the
Constitution of the United States and the Laws of the United States supported by the
Admissions to date evaded and not answered by Auchterlonie, has proffered one of the
essential elements in the "UNITED STATES" (sic) Motion (assessment) which is totally

untrue in which the Hymes have submitted conclusive and legal evidence in support of the

will of Congress and the statutory authority of Congress, of which both are mandatory
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document120 Filed 06/21/2007 Page 2of5

upon the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") as found in Docket 116, being the Motion to
Dismiss with prejudice. As to the legal relationship of the USA to the IRS, Auchterlonie
has refused to disclose it to the Hymes in the Admissions and all other requests.

There must be an "assessment", being an essential element upon which the
UNITED STATES Motion is premised. As the Hymes have submitted conclusive and
legal evidence of the public records under the penalties of perjury and Auchterlonie also
has a penalties of perjury statement on "assessment", until this Court makes a
determination as a matter of law on who is incorrect based upon the will of Congress and
the statutory authority of Congress, Auchterlonie's UNITED STATES' Motion is untrue
and is estopped as a matter of law. All of the other demands in Auchterlonie's UNITED
STATES?' Motion are also moot as the first essential element, being the "assessment" is
not only untrue, is not supported by the will of Congress, is not supported under the
statutory authority of Congress: but is Fraud upon the Court under the penalties of
perjury!

The Court does not sit as a committee to perfect the administration of tax laws and
the Court is only to assure that the Commission's regulation fall within his authority to
implement the Congress's mandate; and, this is found in the adjudged decision of the

Supreme Court in United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 306-307 (1967), to wit:

But we do not sit as a committee of revision to *307 perfect the administration of
the tax laws. Congress has **450 delegated to the Commissioner, not to the courts, the
task of prescribing `all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement' of the Internal
Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. s 7805(a). In this area of limitless factual variations `it is the
province of Congress and the Commissioner, not the courts, to make the
appropriate adjustments.' Commissioner v. Stidger, 386 U.S. 287, 296, 87 S.Ct. 1065,
1071, 18 L.Ed.2d 53. The rule of the judiciary in cases of this sort begins and ends
with assuring that the Commissioner's regulations fall within his authority to
implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner. [Emphasis
added]

See U.S. v. Carwright, 411 U.S. 546, 550 (1973); Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U.S.
741, 749-751 (1969); Bob Jones Univ. v. U.S. Goldsboro Christian Schools, Inc., 461
U.S. 574, 596 (1983).

In the adjudged decision of United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532

U.S. 200 (2001) it was held, to wit:

The Court does not **1436 sit as a committee of revision to perfect the
administration of the tax laws. United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 306-307, 88
S.Ct. 445, 19 L.Ed.2d 537. Instead, it defers to the Commissioner's regulations as
long as they implement the congressional mandate in a reasonable manner. Jd., at
307, 88 S.Ct. 445. [Emphasis added]

In the adjudged decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in C.L.R. v.
Portland Cement Co. of Utah, 450 U.S. 156, 157 (1981) it was held "This Court
customarily defers to Treasury Regulations that "implement the congressional
mandate in some reasonable manner." United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 307,
88 S.Ct. 445, 450 (1967). See also CLLR. ibid at 169.

In the adjudged decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in National

Muffler Dealers Assoc. Inc. v. United States, 440 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1979) citing Correll,

supra. and the Court also pronounced at 477, to wit:

We do this because "Congress has delegated to the [Secretary of the Treasury and
his delegate, the] Commissioner [of Internal Revenue], not to the courts, the task of
prescribing `all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement' of the Internal
Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. B 7805(a)." United States vy. Correll, 389 U.S., at 307, 88
S.Ct. at 449. That delegation helps ensure that in "this area of limitless factual
variations," ibid., like cases will be treated alike. It also helps guarantee that the rules
will be written by "masters of the subject," United States v. Moore, 95 U.S. 760, 763,
24 L.Ed. 588, 589 (1878), who will be responsible for putting the rules into effect.
[Emphasis added]

It seems quite clear that the Court does not sit as a committee to perfect the
administration of the tax laws; and, the IRS is to promulgate regulations under the

statutory authority of Congress; and, the Courts exercise review over the IRS actions.

Therefore, the Hymes' Opposition is founded upon the filing in Docket 116 and
until this Court makes a determination upon the will of Congress and the statutory
authority of Congress in this instant case under the penalties of perjury including Docket

116, Auchterlonie's UNITED STATES' Motion is estopped.
