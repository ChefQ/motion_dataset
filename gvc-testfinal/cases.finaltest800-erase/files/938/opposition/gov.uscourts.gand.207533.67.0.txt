CIVIL ACTION
FILE NO.: 1:14-cv-02288-TWT

DEFENDANT’S (CORRECTED) RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STAY LITIGATION PENDING APPEAL
COMES NOW Defendant Sportswear, Inc. (“Prep Sportswear”), through its
undersigned attorneys, and pursuant to LR 7.1(B), N.D. Ga. respectfully submits
this Response to Plaintiff Savannah College of Art and Design, Inc.’s Motion to
Stay Litigation Pending Appeal.
Prep Sportswear does not oppose the Motion (for reasons that need not be
articulated here). However, Prep Sportswear feels compelled to file this response
to provide the Court with a more complete picture prior to ruling. But it bears
repeating: Prep Sportswear does not oppose the Motion.
respectfully points out the following.

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 67 Filed 09/17/15 Page 2 of 6

Prep Sportswear was granted Summary Judgment on August 3, 2015 on the
grounds that Savannah College of Art and Design, Inc. (“the University”) did not
have any rights in the alleged trademarks in connection with apparel. The
University does not have federal registrations for the marks in connection with
apparel, nor did it present evidence sufficient to establish it has a common law
trademark. The District Court properly granted Prep Sportswear’s Motion for
Summary Judgment as the University failed to make a prima facie showing it had
any enforceable trademark rights in the marks as applied on apparel.
On September 1, 2015 the University filed a Motion to Stay Litigation
Pending Appeal with this Court. Prep Sportswear timely files this response.
In view of a request to stay, a court should consider the following four
factors set forth by the Supreme Court: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a
strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant
will be irreparable injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will
substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the
public interest lies.” Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987).
Despite its argument to the contrary, the University cannot show a likelihood
of success by “simply repeating its earlier argument, which [this] Court previously
considered.” In re Roz Trading Ltd., 2007 WL 120844, *1 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 11,

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 67 Filed 09/17/15 Page 3 of 6

2007). The University attempts to argue it should not have been required to show
use on apparel, however, as this Court noted in its holding “[c]ommon-law
trademark rights are appropriated only through actual prior use in commerce.”
Doc. No. 53, pg 5 (citing Crystal Entertainment & Filmworks, Inc. v. Jurado, 643
F.3d 1313, 1321 (11th Cir. 2011). Further, a federal registration only creates a
presumption of rights, but only to the goods or services specified in the
registration, not to all goods and services. Gameologist Grp., LLC v. Scientific
Games Int’l, Inc., 838 F.Supp.2d 141, 153 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). The University could
not establish common law trademark rights before and cannot do it by rehashing
the same arguments before the Eleventh Circuit. As such, the University has failed
to make a strong showing that it will succeed on the merits.
Under the second factor, a court considering a stay should look to see if the
moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay. Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776
(emphasis added). The University argues it will be injured absent a stay due to its
need to prepare for the matter before the Eleventh Circuit. As this case was
recently appealed, the University has over a month to prepare for the appeal it filed
and has timely responded to Prep Sportswear’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. The
University has failed to show it will be irreparable injured absent a stay.
Moreover, the University argued it would be an “unnecessary expenditure of fees

(should this Court issue the requested stay) by having to brief the attorneys’ fees
issue only one time”, but has now done so, undermining its own reasoning. See,
Doc. No. 62, pg 7; and Doc. No. 63.
Respectfully submitted this 16th day of September, 2015.
