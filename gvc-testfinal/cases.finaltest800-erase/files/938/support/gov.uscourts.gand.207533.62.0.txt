CIVIL ACTION
FILE NO. 1:14-cv-02288-TWT

PLAINTIFF SAVANNAH COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN, INC.’S
MOTION TO STAY LITIGATION PENDING APPEAL AND
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Pursuant to LR 7.2, N.D.Ga., Plaintiff Savannah College of Art and Design,
Inc., (“SCAD”) respectfully submits this Motion to Stay Litigation Pending Appeal
and Memorandum in Support thereof. On August 3, 2015, this Court issued a
Final Judgment in this matter, ruling on summary judgment in favor of Defendant
Sportswear, Inc. (“Sportswear”). Subsequently, on August 17, 2015, Sportswear
filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees seeking to collect over $210,000. Doc. 56. On
August 25, 2015, Sportswear filed its Bill of Costs seeking to collect $2,200.05.
Doc. 57. SCAD respectfully requests that any further litigation over attorneys’

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 62 Filed 09/01/15 Page 2 of 10

fees and costs be deferred until after resolution of the appeal that SCAD filed with
the Eleventh Circuit on August 26, 2015. Doc. 58.
A stay of any further litigation over attorneys’ fees and costs is consistent
with the interests of justice and judicial economy. Litigating the issue of attorneys’
fees will require considerable time and effort, which will have been wasted should
SCAD prevail in its appeal on the merits. Sportswear’s Motion for Attorneys’
Fees and Costs raises a host of issues, many not squarely addressed in the four
corners of its Motion and which are vigorously disputed by SCAD. Sportswear
seeks to collect all of the fees it incurred as the defendant. Apart from the issue of
whether an award of fees for Sportswear is appropriate in this matter (a proposition
SCAD adamantly disputes), Sportswear does not link any specific fees and
expenses to the supposed objectionable conduct that forms the basis for
Sportswear’s motion. Thus, the Court and the parties will have to spend time and
resources assessing and determining the reasonableness (or lack thereof) of
Sportswear’s claim.
As discussed below, no harm will come by deferring consideration of
Sportswear’s motion and bill of costs until after the pending appeal is resolved.
Accordingly, SCAD seeks to defer litigating the issue of attorneys’ fees and costs
until such time as the appeal is concluded.

I.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITIES
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contemplate that a district court may

defer ruling on a request for attorneys’ fees and costs until a pending appeal has
been decided. See Rau v. Apple-Rio Mgmt. Co., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20395
(N.D. Ga. Mar. 29, 2000) (quoting the Advisory Committee Notes to the 1993
amendment to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2), “[i]f an appeal on the merits of the case is
taken, the court may rule on the claim for fees, may defer its ruling on the motion,
or may deny the motion without prejudice, directing under subdivision (d)(2)(B) a
new period for filing after the appeal has been resolved.”). The Supreme Court has
identified four factors to be considered in assessing a request for a stay of litigation
pending appeal: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he
is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably
injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the
other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”
Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). The stay factors contemplate
“individualized judgments” in each case, and “the formula [for doing so] cannot be
reduced to a set of rigid rules.” Id. at 777.
The first factor weighs in SCAD’s favor, and it should be applied flexibly, as
were it applied literally it would almost never be met. United States v. ASCAP,

3

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 62 Filed 09/01/15 Page 4 of 10

1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14274, *2-3 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 1991) (“Were it
otherwise, a stay would presumably never be granted by a district court, except
perhaps in the rare instance in which the court had lost faith in its own ruling.”).
As an initial matter, since the case was decided on summary judgment, the
Eleventh Circuit will consider the underlying ruling on a de novo basis. Holloman
v. Mail-Well Corp., 443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2006). In its appeal, SCAD will
contend, inter alia, that it is entitled to relief under Eleventh Circuit precedent that
supports SCAD’s claims of Defendant’s infringement of SCAD’s registered
trademarks under 15 U.S.C. § 1114 and Defendant’s violation of SCAD’s rights
under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)). SCAD reasonably
believes that the Eleventh Circuit will not depart from its long established case law
and hold that SCAD was not required to prove trademark rights in the exact same
class of goods of the Defendant in order for SCAD to stop the Defendant from
intentionally benefitting from the good will associated with SCAD’s services by
unauthorized use of SCAD trademarks on apparel.

Indeed, the Defendant’s

position in this case directly contradicts Boston Prof’l Hockey Ass’n, Inc. v. Dallas
Cap & Emblem Mfg., Inc., 510 F.2d 1004, 1008 (5th Cir. 1975)1 (finding, inter

1

Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981, are
binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d

4

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 62 Filed 09/01/15 Page 5 of 10

alia, infringement of registered marks under section 1114 by sales of apparel with
plaintiffs’ trademarks where their registrations were directed to not apparel but to
“ice hockey entertainment services”), and Univ. of Georgia Athletic Ass’n v. Laite,
756 F.2d 1535, 1537 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding violation of plaintiff’s rights under
Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act where defendant sold beer with plaintiff’s
trademarks (which the plaintiff university did not and could not sell) and its state
trademark registrations specified “services related to sports activities” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). These cases stand for the proposition, as a matter of
law, that SCAD’s claims are not dependent on when it first began selling or
advertising apparel with its trademarks (or in fact whether it ever sold apparel with
its trademarks). Inasmuch as this case has not been analyzed as to this Eleventh
Circuit precedent, Plaintiff respectfully submits that the Eleventh Circuit’s de novo
consideration of the same would be the reasonable basis for belief that a contrary
appellate outcome is likely.

Further, specifically as to the Laite case, when

Defendant finally acknowledged this critical, adverse case law in its summary
judgment reply brief, it could only suggest that the Eleventh Circuit “is simply
wrong.” Doc. 48, p. 12.
The second factor weighs heavily in favor of a stay. Granting the requested
1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc).

5

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 62 Filed 09/01/15 Page 6 of 10

stay preserves judicial resources, the parties’ resources, and allows the parties to
focus on preparing the matter for the Eleventh Circuit. Litigating the issue of
attorneys’ fees and costs will require that the parties and the Court expend
resources that will have been wasted (and may have to be duplicated) in the event
that SCAD succeeds in its appeal. See, e.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned Veterans v.
Sec. of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, (D.C. Cir. 1982) (holding that discovery regarding
“the justification for the claimed billing rate and the nature and extent of the work
done … is essential in the calculation of the fee award”). Indeed, citing concerns
of judicial efficiency, and without even examining the four factors cited above for
stay of an order, courts often defer ruling on a request for fees until after an appeal
on the merits is decided. See, e.g., Hipp v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., 65 F. Supp.2d
1314, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999) (“In the interests of judicial economy, the Court will
… defer ruling on costs and attorneys’ fees until all appeals have been resolved”),
aff’d in part, rev’d on other grounds in part, 252 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir. 2001); Nat’l
Farmer’s Org., Inc. v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., 850 F.2d 1286, 1312 (8th
Cir. 1988) (“Thus, rather than undertaking the time-consuming task of determining
a reasonable attorney’s fee, only to see the effort overturned on appeal, [ ] the
district court wisely deferred ruling on attorneys’ fees and costs pending appeal”)
(citations omitted); Hammond v. Alcoa, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14212, *3-4

6

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 62 Filed 09/01/15 Page 7 of 10

(W.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2009) (deferring motion for an award of attorney's fees while
appeal on merits was pending, finding the motion “premature” and that to rule
before the Third Circuit decides the appeal would be “inappropriate” and
“inefficient”); Lasic v. Moreno, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88608, *2-3 (E.D. Cal.
Nov. 21, 2007) (finding it in interests of judicial economy to defer ruling on
attorneys’ fees request when appeal on merits is pending). In addition to judicial
efficiency, the parties can avoid the unnecessary expenditure of fees (should this
Court issue the requested stay) by having to brief the attorneys’ fees issue only one
time.
The third factor also weighs heavily in favor of a stay. Sportswear will not
be harmed by the issuance of the Stay. There is no allegation or basis to allege that
SCAD will be unable to pay an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees following a
ruling from the Eleventh Circuit, should SCAD lose the appeal and this Court
deem an award of fees appropriate. Moreover, if the Court proceeds with litigating
the issue of attorneys’ fees now, even if Sportswear’s Motion were ultimately
granted in some measure, SCAD would appeal any award of attorneys’ fees, and
could obtain a stay pending such appeal. Thus, as a practical matter, in no event
will Sportswear collect any fees until after the Eleventh Circuit rules on SCAD’s
appeal(s).

Case 1:14-cv-02288-TWT Document 62 Filed 09/01/15 Page 8 of 10

The fourth factor, regarding the public interest, also favors SCAD. The
public interest is in an efficient use of resources. Litigating the issue of attorneys’
fees before the Eleventh Circuit has ruled on SCAD’s appeal is simply inefficient,
and there is no prejudice to any party by deferring the issue. As discussed above,
supra at pp. 6-7, litigation over attorneys’ fees while an appeal on the merits is
pending is a waste of judicial resources.
II.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, SCAD respectfully request that this Court grant

this Motion to Stay Litigation Pending Appeal. A proposed order for the Court’s
consideration is attached as Exhibit A.
Respectfully submitted this 1st day of September, 2015.
