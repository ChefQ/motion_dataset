BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S CROSS MOTION AND IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE

Pursuant to L. Civ. R. 7.1 (d)(7), and for all the reasons stated below, Defendant's
Motion requesting Judicial Notice should be stricken by this Court since Defendant's moving
papers were not filed or served on all parties 24 days prior to the noticed motion date.
Defendant's blatant disregard of applicable motion procedures is unacceptable and cannot go
unnoticed by this Court. In the alternative, if the Court in inclined to hear Defendant's Motion at
this time, Plaintiff respectfully submits this Brief in opposition to Defendant's Motion for

Judicial Notice.
I. NATURE OF THE CASE
Plaintiff Deborah Fellner brought suit against the Defendant, alleging violations of the New
jersey Products Liability Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:58C-1 ef seqg., the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act,
N.LS.A. 56:8-1 ef seg., and common law fraud, for caning and distributing tuna containing
harmful mercury compounds, yet failing to warn and disclose the harms associated with mercury
in its tuna products. See Plaintiff's Amended Complaint

Il. OPPOSITION AND CROSS MOTION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE

A. Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts

1. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's complaint was properly filed before this Court
and made returnable on October 5, 2009.

2. On September 21, 2009 Plaintiff timely filed her opposition papers.

3. Even though Defendant was obligated to serve a reply by September 28, 2009, Plaintiff
had graciously agreed to extend the date to October 1, 2009.

4, On October 1, 2009 Defendant proceeded to file their Reply papers as well as a Motion
Requesting Judicial Notice of several documents annexed to their papers in violation of
the timing requirements governing motion practice proscribed in L.Civ.R.7.1 (c)(1);
(d)C).

5. Other than a Notice of Motion Requesting Judicial Notice and Certification of Counsel,
Defendant did not file any other paper in support of its Motion.

6. Defendant's Motion Requesting Judicial Notice did not state any grounds or offer any

reasons as to why this Court should take Judicial Notice, in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P.

7b 1)B).
B. Argument

Defendant's Motion for Judicial Notice must be stricken for failure to comply with
appropriate Local Rules of the District Court of New Jersey as well as the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.

Pursuant to L.Civ.R. 7.1 (c)(1) "All applications . .. shall be made returnable before Judge or
Magistrate Judge to whom the case has been assigned on the first regular motion day which is at
least 24 days after the date of filing." L.Civ.R. 7.1 (d)(1) states that "No application will be heard
unless the moving papers, and brief ... and proof of acknowledgment of service on all parties,
are filed with the Clerk at least 24 days prior to the noticed motion day." Defendant's Motion
was filed four days prior to the motion date noticed in their papers, and thus Plaintiff respectfully
requests this Court to strike their papers.'

Defendant's Motion also fails to state adequate grounds for Judicial Notice. Specifically,
Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(1)(B) states that motions must "state with particularity the grounds for seeking
ihe order" (emphasis added). In their certification in support of motion, Defendant only states
that "applicable case law permitting judicial notice are listed in the footnotes to the motion
submitted." Def's Certif. cent 3. However, in their attempt to blind side the Plaintiff, Defendant
failed to provide any document containing the aforementioned footnotes and case law.

Thus Defendant's statement that the documents of which they seek judicial notice of are
"publicly available" is the only contention they offer in support of the requested Judicial Notice.
Def's Certif. (3. However, Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows the Court to only
take judicial notice of adjudicative facts. Defendant makes no argument and offers no case law

to support a conclusion that the documents and/or statements contained within them are the kinds

 

'T Civ.R. 7.1(d)(7) states that "The Court may reject any brief or other paper not filed within the
time specified."
of facts that are capable of being judicially noticed pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 201 Moreover, it is
entirely unclear whether Defendant seeks judicial notice of the statements contained in the
attached documents or of the documents themselves.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, it is respectfully submitted that Defendant's

Motion requesting judicial notice is stricken or in the alternative denied.
