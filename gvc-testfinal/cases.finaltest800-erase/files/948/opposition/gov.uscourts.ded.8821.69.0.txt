FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

Stanford L. Burris

Vv.

Plaintiff,
Civ. No. 04-1469-SLR

Richards Paving, Inc.

Defendant

DEFENDANT RICHARDS PAVING, INC.,'S
RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES

Defendant Richards Paving, Inc., (hereafter referred to as "Richards Paving")

hereby moves this Court to enter an order modifying plaintiff's motion for attorneys fees.

1.

Under McKnatt v. State of Delaware, "The court may exclude from the lodestar

 

calculation unnecessary hours or hours that lack proper documentation. 369 F.
Supp.2d 521, 524, (D.Del. 2004), citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433
(1986).

In the present case, plaintiff's counsel has attached an itemized bill of
professional services rendered in this case. On two separate dates, 2/18/05 and
2/19/05, plaintiff's counsel merely identifies "research" as work done in this
particular case. However, there is no description of the work performed, nor any
proper documentation to justify five (5) hours of research at a cost of $1,750.
Based on the lack of specificity and proper documentation, this court should
reduce the attorney's' fees by $1,750.

On 11/8/06, plaintiff's counsel billed 5.6 hours for "preparing responses to D's

motion in limine'", at a cost of $1,960. However, under the Court's scheduling
Case 1:04-cv-01469-SLR Document69 _ Filed 12/21/2006 Page2of2

order, all responses to motions in limine were due by 11/6/06. At no time was
any extension requested by the plaintiff. Therefore, since plaintiff's counsel was
late in filing any response to defendants' motions in limine and spent unnecessary
time in preparing the responses, plaintiffs attorneys' fees should be reduced by
$1,960.
4, Based on the above, defendant respectfully requests that plaintiff's motion be
modified by $3,710.00.
5. Defendant further requests a modification of any additional attorney's fees the
Court deems unreasonable and excessive.
WHEREFORE, for the reasons stated above, Richards Paving respectfully
requests that this Court modify plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amounts stated
above and any other relief, the Court deems just.
