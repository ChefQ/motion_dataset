DEFENDANTS’ BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND TO COMPEL

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 1 of 33 Document 136

I.

INTRODUCTION
In the midst of a conferral about their suddenly renewed interest in the electronically

stored information (“ESI”) of three current or former Infosys employees and gathering yet more
documents relating to PeopleFluent affirmative action plans, Plaintiffs have asked this Court to
sanction Infosys. Nowhere in their substantial filing—a 25-page brief with 40 exhibits—do
Plaintiffs explain why they waited months after the close of discovery and briefing on class
certification and summary judgment to seek sanctions based on long-running disputes (yet could
not wait a single day past their preferred date for a particular conferral response). Nor do
Plaintiffs explain what they intend to do with new discovery sought as “sanctions”—their broad
requests for information ranging from Infosys communications about its affirmative action plans,
to privileged documents reflecting Infosys preservation efforts, to unspecified depositions.
But several things remain clear. First, Rule 37(e) does not permit the spoliation sanctions
that Plaintiffs demand. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ position that Infosys should be sanctioned for loss (or
partial loss) of ESI from the computer hard drives of (now) just two former employees out of the
hundreds of custodians they have identified—and notwithstanding the approximately 2.7 million
custodian emails Infosys has already retrieved—largely rests on their own mis-statements about
Infosys preservation efforts. And to the degree it does not, Plaintiffs would burden Infosys with
an impossibility: an unsupported duty not just to preserve, but to physically collect ESI from the
hard drives of more than one hundred employees “at the first sign of” their unprecedented,
companywide allegations of reverse discrimination—a vast project that would have required
Infosys to spend extraordinary time and perhaps millions of dollars within weeks of answering
Plaintiffs’ amended complaint.
Second, neither Rule 26(g) nor Rule 37(d) suggests any basis for imposing discovery
sanctions relating to PeopleFluent affirmative action plans. Put aside that Infosys timely
1

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 2 of 33 Document 136

produced these affirmative action plans, performance goals, and all related data. And put aside
that Plaintiffs have failed to extract any relevant, non-duplicative information from those plans or
some thousands of additional PeopleFluent documents. Rule 26(g) governs an attorney’s
certification of discovery responses through her signature, not every discussion that comes
afterwards. And Rule 37(d) applies when parties fail to provide any response to discovery
requests, not when they provide written responses and well-founded objections (let alone more
than 800,000 pages of responsive documents and comprehensive data related to well over one
hundred thousand applicants and employees). Claims that Infosys should be sanctioned for
failing to edit a discovery mediation chart or providing “only” hundreds of Affirmative Action
plans prepared by PeopleFluent in its original production ignore the plain terms of these rules.
And finally, Plaintiffs’ motion comes too late. If they believed Infosys had lost or failed
to disclose information relevant to class certification or their substantive claims, Plaintiffs should
have asked for more time and discovery before the parties completed Rule 23, Daubert, and
summary judgment briefing. Their inexplicable attempt to upend more than six months of classrelated litigation instead amounts to unreasonable and therefore fatal delay.
In sum, Plaintiffs’ Monday-morning rush to the courthouse—a filing that occurred hours
before Infosys would have advised them of newly-recovered ESI and other efforts to resolve
disagreements—was, in equal parts, premature and pointless. Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions
and to compel should be denied.
II.

BACKGROUND
A.

Infosys acted reasonably in all aspects of its efforts to preserve ESI.
1.

Infosys immediately preserves ESI through litigation holds and reminders.

Six days after Plaintiffs filed their complaint on August 1, 2013, Infosys issued its first
legal hold to numerous potential document custodians. (May 22, 2017, Declaration of Sarah
2
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 3 of 33 Document 136

Wasson ¶ 3, attached hereto as Exhibit A (hereafter “Wasson Decl.”)). By August 20, 2014,
almost a year before any ESI was lost, Infosys had expanded its hold to include additional
custodians, including then-employees Sanjay Jalona, Rohit Kedia, and Chris Weber—all of
whom promptly acknowledged receiving the hold and promised to abide by it. (Id. ¶ 4). In
addition, the electronic assets of hold recipients were tagged in an asset tracking system to
automatically alert the people who redeployed laptops to preserve information should those
custodians leave Infosys. (Id. ¶ 8). Even without the legal holds, Infosys did not automatically
delete emails from employee in-boxes. (Id. ¶ 9). Beyond efforts that included issuing hold
notices to more than 90 employees, Infosys retained relevant system data not subject to
automatic deletion. (Id. ¶ 4; May 22, 2017, Declaration of Ellen Boshkoff ¶ 14, attached hereto
as Exhibit B (hereafter “Boshkoff Decl.”).).
2.

Months before Plaintiffs identify 103 custodians, data from two is lost.

Two of the hundreds of individuals Plaintiffs later identified as potential records
custodians—Sanjay Jalona and Rohit Kedia—left Infosys in 2015. Though erroneously
identified by one of Plaintiffs’ witnesses as the Global Head of Talent Acquisition (Declaration
of Samuel Marrero, ECF No. 94-4), Jalona was actually only the head of one of what once was
15 different business units that recruiters could interact with for hiring approval. 1 (Danforth
Dep. 58:22-24, 60:21-61:14, Ex. C; Linquist Dep. 39:44-40, Ex. D). Rohit Kedia, a Group
Engagement Manager, supervised Plaintiff Handloser from 2009 until mid-2011, when
Handloser began reporting to Sudip Singh. (Singh Dep. 107:20-108:4, ECF No. 78-17;
Handloser Dep. 42:24-44:18, ECF No. 78-16).

1

Even within that business unit, recruiters would not necessarily interact with Jalona, but instead would get hiring
approval from a sub-unit. (Danforth Dep. 61:15-62:3, Ex. C).

On August 6, 2015, just two days before Jalona left Infosys, a laptop he might have been
using was reformatted in violation of Infosys’s express instructions regarding document
preservation. (Wasson Decl. ¶ 11; Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 24). In October 2015, around his departure,
a laptop likely used by Kedia was also reformatted in violation of preservation instructions.
(Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 20; Wasson Decl. ¶ 11).
B.

Infosys Produces and Collects Vast ESI; Plaintiffs Raise Discovery Disputes.
1.

Plaintiffs serve overbroad discovery requests and Infosys responds.

In July 2015, Plaintiffs’ served 20 broad requests for production of (among other things):
“Documents and ESI relating to studies concerning the availability of Americans and/or nonIndians to fill positions in the United States” and “Documents and ESI relating to demographics
or statistics of Infosys’s United States workforce, including but not limited to, EEO reports,
studies, or other documents reflecting the statistics of the workforce.” (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 2 and
Ex. 1 (Plaintiffs’ First Requests for Production of Documents Nos. 4, 5)).
Though objecting to (inter alia) vagueness and overbreadth, Infosys nonetheless
produced (on November 24, 2015) its human resources and applicant tracking data relating to
over 145,000 applicants and all U.S.-based employees for the relevant time period, including
employment dates, compensation, race/ethnicity, position titles, project assignments, and
applicant interviewing data. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex. 2 (Infosys’s Amended Objections and
Responses to Plaintiffs’ First Requests for Production of Documents)).
To make the data easier to use and understand, Infosys included employee identification
numbers in each spreadsheet for ready linking and analysis, (March 6, 2017, Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 3
(ECF No. 128-1); Siskin Supp. Rpt., 6 (ECF No. 125-2)), and Infosys also provided Plaintiffs
with extraordinary help, including by way of specially created charts identifying each
spreadsheet by name and category, a data dictionary defining all data fields provided, and “look
4
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 5 of 33 Document 136

up tables” defining certain activity codes—going so far as to meet with Plaintiffs’ counsel, in
person, for several hours to explain the exemplars. (March 6, 2017, Boshkoff Decl. ¶¶ 4-13
(ECF No. 128-1); see also Neumark Rpt. App’x 6 (ECF No. 87-1) (identifying data dictionaries
as information relied upon)). Infosys also provided (1) all relevant Affirmative Action Plans;
and (2) all documents Infosys maintained as “required and supporting reports” related to those
Affirmative Action Plans—more than 50,000 pages of documents prepared by its outside vendor,
PeopleFluent. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 5). 2 These documents contained certain “placement goals”
mandated by government contractor regulations. (Id.).
2.

The parties participate in a failed discovery mediation, ended by Plaintiffs.

By early January 2016, Plaintiffs had raised concerns about virtually every one of
Defendants’ responses to the Requests for Production. To address the impasse, Judge Pepper
referred the parties to Judge Joseph, who scheduled a March discovery mediation and required
the parties to submit an outline of their positions on each issue. (ECF No. 49). 3 Apparently in
response to the mediation order, counsel for Plaintiffs sent Infosys a chart, which they created,
purporting to capture the status of various conversations regarding Infosys’s discovery responses.
(Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 3 (Feb. 24, 2016, Letter from D. Kotchen to G. Stohner)). A conference
with Judge Joseph followed, but did not resolve the various discovery issues. (Id. ¶ 9).

Twice

continued to allow more party discussions, a follow-up conference was ultimately scheduled for
April 13, 2016. (Id ¶ 10; ECF No. 51).
In preparation for the conference, Infosys’s counsel tried to capture the status of issues
being discussed by revising the “Outstanding Issues” section in Plaintiffs’ discovery chart to add
2

These steps were only a few of the many Infosys took to address discovery issues raised by Plaintiffs. (See ECF
No. 134-1 (Apr. 25, 2016, Ltr. from E. Boshkoff to Plaintiffs’ counsel)).
3
Infosys had asked to brief discovery issues because of “differing interpretations of what has occurred in various
communications, . . . mak[ing] it all the more important that both parties explain their positions in writing.” (ECF
No. 44, p. 5).

5
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 6 of 33 Document 136

a column entitled “Updates.” (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 10). Infosys made no changes to the two other
sections of Plaintiffs’ chart. (Id. ¶ 11). Sending the chart, Infosys noted its hope the chart could
“narrow some of the issues that need to be presented to the court.” (Id. ¶ 10, Ex. 4). As
Plaintiffs did not respond, the draft chart was never finalized or submitted. (Id. ¶ 10). At
Plaintiffs’ insistence (and over Infosys’s objection), the April teleconference was ended and the
discovery disputes returned to Judge Pepper for resolution. (Id. ¶ 11; ECF No. 55).
3.

Magistrate Judge Jones mediates custodian dispute and Infosys complies.

On May 27, 2016, Magistrate Judge Jones assumed responsibility for handling pretrial
proceedings and began regular conference calls to address discovery issues. (ECF No. 58).
During the first call, Plaintiff raised their interest in conducting discovery into Infosys’s
document preservation, but were told no such discovery would be allowed absent evidence that
any document had “not been produced” or was destroyed. (Id.). For its part, Infosys expressed
concern about Plaintiffs’ failure to identify preferred records custodians. (Id.). Thereafter,
Infosys reported regularly on its efforts to collect ESI while expressing frustration with
Plaintiffs’ failure to agree upon a custodian list. 4
As part of these efforts, Infosys began a systematic ESI collection project in mid2016. In May 2016, Plaintiffs had proposed that Infosys collect ESI from 103 specifically
identified custodians (including Chris Weber, Sanjay Jalona, and Rohit Kedia), as well as some
groups of several hundred other employees, and proposed that Infosys use 140 different search

4

See, e.g., Minute Entries at ECF No. 60 (counsel for Infosys reporting Infosys had “tried to identify [custodians]
based on the list provided” but “[f]eel [they] are dealing with moving target”); ECF No. 61 (counsel for Defendants
“still not sure what Plaintiffs intend to do [with custodians]”; reporting that “proposals seen in the past have been for
massive collection of ESI”); ECF No. 65 (“there are 104 different proposed custodians [and Defendants] [s]till
haven’t gotten more targeted list”; explaining further that collecting ESI is a labor intensive process and Infosys has
“massive amounts of information”); ECF No. 68 (counsel for Defendant notes that Plaintiff’s custodian list still
contains “104 proposed custodians with multiple categories, which is not realistic or doable,” but regardless, has
started “working on the list right away because ESI takes time to collect”); ECF No. 69 (noting that the custodian
“list is not feasible” and that defendant “never got list of viable search terms from plaintiff”).

terms to cull potentially discoverable documents—an immense undertaking that Infosys reported
was “not feasible.” (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 12 and Exs. 5, 6). Infosys estimated that proceeding one
hard drive at a time, this collection would cost between $600,000-$4,000,000. 5 (Id. ¶ 13).
Despite Plaintiffs’ failure to narrow or prioritize their custodian list for several months, 6
Infosys searched for and collected (where possible) the ESI of 34 custodians in May through July
2016. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶14). As of July 2016, more than two months before the close of
discovery, Infosys reported to Plaintiffs that it had been unable to locate any useable ESI for
Jalona, Kedia, or Weber. 7 (Wasson Decl. ¶ 10; Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. 9; ECF No. 68).
In July 2016, Plaintiffs narrowed their proposed a list of custodians to 33 people.
(Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 17; ECF No. 68). Infosys explained that while it had already collected ESI for
7 of the 33 (and had no objections to searching those emails and producing responsive
documents), collecting and producing ESI for the remaining 26 people would be impracticable.
(Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 17). Judge Jones ordered Plaintiffs to narrow their list to eight to ten
additional records custodians, resulting in a total of 15 to 17 custodians (Id. ¶ 18; ECF No. 69)
and the collection of over a Terabyte of data, comprising about 2.7 million documents, after
removing duplicates. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 19). Infosys also applied search terms and produced
documents for at least 15 of those custodians. (Id.).
4.

Infosys produces all ESI for Chris Weber.

While trying to respond to the moving target of preferred records custodians, Infosys
continued to search for difficult-to-obtain ESI, leading to discovery of ESI from Chris Weber
and, in mid-to-late September 2016, to the discovery (in India) of reformatted laptop computers
5

Plaintiffs also proposed overbroad search terms requiring review of nearly all documents in any custodian’s ESI.
Apply those terms to one custodian resulted in a 97% “hit” rate. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 13).
6
Infosys requested that Plaintiffs narrow and/or prioritize their initial proposed custodian list in writing at least five
times between May and August 2016 before Plaintiffs did so in response to Magistrate Judge Jones’s direction.
7
Infosys was unable to find laptops assigned to Kedia or Jalona or issued to Weber. (Wasson Decl. ¶ 10; Boshkoff
Decl. ¶ 16).

7
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 8 of 33 Document 136

that could have been assigned to Jalona and Kedia. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶¶ 21, 23; Wasson Decl. ¶
11). Infosys determined there was no data on the device potentially assigned to Jalona and no
recoverable data on the laptop potentially assigned to Kedia—findings consistent with Infosys’s
July 2016 representations to Plaintiffs that it had not been able to locate useable ESI for these
custodians. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 24, Ex. 7 (Aug. 9, 2016, email from Plaintiffs’ counsel noting
their understanding that “no documents [had been] retained” for Jalona or Kedia)).
C.

After Discovery Closes, Plaintiffs Raise Untimely Concerns.
1.

Even after discovery, Infosys retains a computer forensics expert.

Fact discovery closed on September 16, 2016. (ECF No. 61). In October or November
2016, Plaintiffs raised—for the first time since May 2016, and four months after Infosys notified
Plaintiffs it had been unable to locate ESI for Kedia, Jalona, or Weber—concerns regarding
Infosys’s document preservations efforts. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 22). Despite their untimely request,
Infosys took the extraordinary step of retaining a computer forensics expert to search for
recoverable data on laptops possibly assigned to Jalona and Kedia. (Id. ¶ 23). After the expert
found no useable data on the Jalona laptop, and some potentially recoverable data on Kedia’s,
Infosys directed the vendor to extract the recoverable data for processing and review. 8 (Id. ¶ 24).
Infosys has already agreed—and would have agreed notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ pending
motion—to produce any useable documents that it recovers. (Id.).
Although the parties continued to have discovery conferences with Judge Jones during
the fall of 2016, at no point then or afterwards did Plaintiffs raise their ESI concerns with the
Court.
2.

8

Plaintiffs raise untimely concerns about PeopleFluent documents.

This data was transferred to Infosys on May 3, 2017. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 26).

8
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 9 of 33 Document 136

In June 2016, having already received about 50,000 documents including all affirmative
action plans from Infosys, Plaintiffs had issued a third-party subpoena to PeopleFluent, seeking
documents in PeopleFluent’s possession related to Infosys’ Affirmative Action planning (to
which Infosys did not object). (Id. ¶ 7). Though PeopleFluent prepared (and produced to
Plaintiffs) various documents and data sets not previously produced by Infosys, all reflect a
subset of data that is less comprehensive than the data produced to Plaintiffs in November 2015;
as Infosys’s expert has explained, that data allowed for no meaningful statistical analysis of
alleged discrimination. (Siskin Supp. Rpt., p. 6, ECF No. 125-2).
In January 2017—six months after serving its subpoena, several months after fact
discovery closed, and a month after it first received documents from PeopleFluent—Plaintiffs
claimed Infosys should have produced additional PeopleFluent documents in response to their
request for documents and ESI relating Infosys demographics. (ECF No. 112) Beginning in
February, Infosys responded to the Court’s January 30, 2017 instruction by producing ancillary
and intermediate reports prepared by PeopleFluent of over 170,000 pages, all of which could be
created from data that Infosys produced in November. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 27; Siskin Supp. Rpt.
6, ECF No. 125-2). Consistent with their limited data and narrow and regulation-dictated
analysis (which does not even distinguish employees by “South Asian” race or “Indian” national
origin), these documents have no bearing on analyses performed by Infosys’s experts. (Siskin
Supp. Rpt. 6, ECF No. 125-2; Guryan Supp. Rpt. 7-8 (Dkt. 125-1); compare Pls.’ Mem. of Law
in Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. to Exclude Expert Rpt. of David Neumark 1 (ECF No. 123) (claiming that
the PeopleFluent reports “contradict” Infosys’s experts)). Nor do they supply any means of
shaping or shortening discovery. Recent claims that Plaintiffs would have “taken discovery
regarding the sources of” PeopleFluent data having already been provided with more data (and

9
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 10 of 33 Document 136

tutoring on how to use it)—like claims that Plaintiffs’ expert would have relied on PeopleFluent
“methods” for basic computations (or even statistical analyses)—remain unexplained and
unsupported by any expert opinion.
III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Plaintiffs did not satisfy their duty to confer under Local Rule 37.

Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions and to compel should be denied because it is premature:
They cannot certify that “the parties are unable to reach an accord” following good faith efforts
to resolve this dispute, as required by Local Rule 37. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ Monday-morning rush
to the courthouse occurred in the midst of Infosys’s good faith efforts to reach an agreement.
Demonstrating that good faith, Infosys’s attorneys spoke with Plaintiffs’ counsel about ESI
discovery the very day of their conferral request, April 18, 2017, despite having heard nothing
from Plaintiffs about this discovery issue since November 2016. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 28). Upon
receiving a discovery proposal two days later—and one that differed materially from earlier
discussions—Infosys attorneys promptly advised Plaintiffs’ counsel that their need to
communicate with Infosys would prevent any response before the following week. (Id. ¶¶ 2931). Infosys’s counsel was still reviewing Plaintiffs’ proposal the following Wednesday, when
Plaintiffs’ counsel sent an email requesting a “response this week.” (Id. ¶ 32). But rather than
make any further attempt to communicate—and despite knowing about the underlying discovery
issues for between three and ten months—Plaintiffs filed a 25-page motion for sanctions
(attaching 40 exhibits) the following Monday at 7:47 a.m., just hours before Infosys and its
counsel met to prepare a response. (Id. ¶¶ 32-33; ECF No. 134).
This premature filing (just seven business days after Plaintiffs’ written proposal)
prevented Infosys from sharing its own proposal. More specifically, Infosys was preparing to

10
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 11 of 33 Document 136

provide additional information relating to each of the three document custodians addressed in
Plaintiffs’ motion, including:
•

The ESI of Chris Weber;

•

The laptop of Sanjay Jalona (compare Pls.’ Memo. of Law in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for
Sanctions and to Compel, Dkt. 135 (“Pls.’ Br.”), 6 (“Infosys apparently has not made
any effort to require Mr. Jalona to return his Infosys laptop”)); and

•

The laptop of Rohit Kedia. (Id.).

And in the brief time that has elapsed since, Infosys has advised Plaintiffs that ESI
relating to Weber (i.e., all relevant documents) was produced months earlier, that Infosys
retained an expert to conduct forensic analyses of laptops reportedly assigned to Jalona and
Kedia, and that the expert has been able to recover some data from what appears to be Kedia’s
email box. Infosys has also offered, well beyond its obligations under Rule 26, to provide
additional discovery of documents relating to PeopleFluent Affirmative Action documents.
Chronologies like this are the very reason that Rule 37 and Local Rule 37 require good
faith attempts to resolve disputes before parties file discovery motions with the Court. Even had
Plaintiffs mistaken a one-day delay for the categorical rejection of their proposal—and despite
having allowed Infosys just eight days to resolve issues that had lingered for months—they could
and should have confirmed that interpretation. Substituting a 25-page motion for a follow-up
email suggests a material disregard for judicial and party resources. Under the plain terms of
Rule 37, Plaintiffs’ motion should therefore be denied. See, e.g., Remy Inc. v. Tecnomatic,
S.P.A., No. 1:11-cv-00991, 2013 WL 1311095, at *3-4 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 26, 2013) (denying
sanctions because defendant failed to comply with Local Rule 37’s duty to meet and confer).

B.

Plaintiffs identify no basis for spoliation sanctions under Rule 37(e).

Plaintiffs’ request for spoliation sanctions also fails on the merits. Having filed a
nationwide, across-the-board challenge to virtually all employment practices at Infosys (i.e., its
decisions to hire, fire, and promote employees), Plaintiffs want the Court to sanction ESI loss
relating to just two out of the hundreds of “custodians” they deem to possess relevant
information. And they base this request on nothing more than: 1) their own inaccurate
statements about Infosys’s preservation efforts; and 2) the bald assertion that Infosys should
have completed a massive ESI collection effort—in effect, should have spent millions of dollars
on data retrieval—just weeks after Infosys answered the second amended complaint (and months
before Plaintiffs made any attempt to identify the custodians from which Plaintiffs wanted
Infosys to collect data). These claims do not come close to permitting Rule 37 sanctions. Under
Rule 37(e), sanctions could be imposed only if Infosys acted unreasonably, Plaintiffs were
prejudiced, and those sanctions were no more than necessary to cure prejudice—none of which
can be demonstrated here.
1.

Infosys took reasonable steps to preserve and produce relevant ESI.

Plaintiffs’ sanctions motion fails because Infosys took reasonable steps to preserve and
produce relevant ESI. As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs’ repeated references to the Court’s
inherent authority to impose sanctions for lost ESI ignore the 2015 Amendments to Rule 37.
See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. 15 n.32. Rule 37(e) now provides:
(e) Failure to Preserve Electronically Stored Information. If electronically
stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct
of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it,
and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court:
(1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information,
may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or

12
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 13 of 33 Document 136

(2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive
another party of the information’s use in the litigation may:
(A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;
(B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was
unfavorable to the party; or
(C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) (emphasis added). The 2015 Committee Notes affirm what the text itself
makes clear: New Rule 37(e) “authorizes and specifies measures a court may employ if
information that should have been preserved is lost, and specifies the findings necessary to
justify these measures.” The Rule “therefore forecloses reliance on inherent authority or state
law to determine when certain measures should be used.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 advisory
committee’s notes (2015 amendment). In short, the loss of ESI is not sanctionable absent a
showing that a party failed to “take reasonable steps to preserve it.”
Here, Plaintiffs have made no serious effort to show a lack of reasonable steps by
Infosys. Though vaguely asserting “numerous relevant documents were undoubtedly lost or
destroyed,” Plaintiffs specifically complain about ESI for only three out of the hundreds of
custodians that they have variously identified (and notwithstanding the over one Terabyte of ESI
Infosys has collected to date). And shrinking even that narrow complaint, Infosys has already
produced the ESI from one custodian and has now recovered all or partial ESI from another. Nor
do Plaintiffs explain why this relatively small loss of ESI—laptop data from former employee
Jalona and some from Kedia—warrants sanctions. Seventeen pages into their brief, Plaintiffs
finally identify what they deem unreasonable: a purported failure “to cease the deletion of email
and the recycling of backup tapes, and … to make a copy of relevant custodians’ files after
[Infosys’s] duty to preserve was triggered.” Pls.’ Br. 17. But this insupportable claim rests on a
mish-mash of erroneous “facts” and irrelevant law.

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 14 of 33 Document 136

Begin with the facts. Contrary to the accusations in Plaintiffs’ brief, Infosys:
•

Did issue litigation holds requiring preservation of all relevant ESI to numerous
custodians on August 7, 2013, and to additional custodians including Jalona and
Kedia (neither identified in the original complaint) on August 20, 2014; (Wasson
Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; cf. Pls.’ Br. 5 n.8 (“The only step apparently taken by Infosys in 2013,
2014, or 2015 was to send a notice of the litigation to an undisclosed list of
potentially relevant custodians in 2013 (and in later years to some additional
custodians), and may have given undisclosed directions about preservation”));

•

Did not use an email system that automatically deletes any emails from these or other
employees’ in-boxes; (Wasson Decl. ¶ 9; cf. Pls.’ Br. at 4 (“[A]t the start of the case,
Infosys did not stop the automatic deletion of emails”);

•

Did not automatically delete files of employees subject to a litigation hold two weeks
after departure from Infosys; (Wasson Decl. ¶ 9; cf. id. at 1 (“When an employee
leaves Infosys, the company automatically deletes all of that employees’ files after
two weeks”); and

•

Did not maintain accessible back-up tapes, but instead used tapes only for purposes of
disaster recovery and recycled them every seven days; cf. id. at 4-5 (“[Infosys] did not
pull backup tapes from its email and file servers (resulting in the tapes being
overwritten)”) (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 29).

And beyond litigation holds and systematic efforts to preserve, Infosys expended substantial
resources to collect information stored on the hard drives of individual custodians’ computers.
Plaintiffs are correct that Infosys declined to launch a monumental data retrieval effort on or
before receiving their Amended Complaint in 2013; but faced with a demand that it retrieve ESI

from 103 specific custodians (including Jalona and Kedia) and groups with hundreds more in
May 2016—a project with estimated processing costs alone of between $600,000-$4,000,000—
Infosys began systematic ESI collection in April 2016, ultimately amassing over a Terabyte of
electronic data from custodial hard drives or about 2.7 million emails. To accuse Infosys of
acting “unreasonably” is to deny basic facts.
Plaintiffs’ claims of “unreasonableness” also fail as a matter of law. Rather than address
what Infosys did—i.e., its litigation holds, vast document collection efforts, and production of all
relevant demographic data—Plaintiffs cite decisions that sanction employers for doing
something else. Quoting Jones v. Bremen High School, for example, Plaintiffs seem to impugn
litigation holds, calling it “unreasonable to allow a party’s interested employees to make the
decision about the relevance of . . . documents, especially when those same employees have the
ability to permanently delete unfavorable email from a party’s system.” No. 08 C 3548, 2010
WL 2106640, at *7 (N.D. Ill. May 25, 2010). What Jones found unreasonable, however, was not
a “litigation hold” but its absence. Id. The employer in Jones had asked particular employees to
collect emails they alone deemed relevant—a process conducted without even the remote
guidance of counsel. Id. Plaintiffs cite Cahill v. Dart (a case that does not involve ESI) to assert
that failing to suspend an automatic deletion policy breaches a duty to preserve; but Infosys does
not automatically delete email even without a litigation hold. No. 13 C 361, 2016 WL 7093434
(N.D. Ill. Mar. 4, 2016); see also Plunk v. Vill. of Elwood, Ill., No. 07 C 88, 2009 WL 1444436,
at *14 (N.D. Ill. May 20, 2009) (finding absence of any ESI policy and failure to place any sort
of litigation ‘hold’ on the ESI after being informed that it should be produced was reckless).
Equally beside the point, Pension Committee of the University of Montreal Pension Plan v. Banc
of America Securities, LLC is cited for the proposition that a party acts unreasonably if it fails “to

15
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 16 of 33 Document 136

preserve the records of former employees that are in a party’s possession, custody, or control[.]”
685 F. Supp. 2d 456, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding the “plaintiffs failed to timely institute
written litigation holds and engaged in careless and indifferent collection efforts after the duty to
preserve arose”), abrog. by Chin v. Port Auth. of New York & New Jersey, 685 F.3d 135, 162 (2d
Cir. 2012) (“We reject the notion that a failure to institute a ‘litigation hold’ constitutes gross
negligence per se.”). Yet any loss of ESI relating to Jalona or Kedia did not occur because
Infosys failed to prevent destruction of files in its custody after their departure; it occurred
because someone violated specific Infosys directives to preserve ESI.
Plaintiffs’ reliance on inapt authority—almost all of which pre-dates the 2015
Amendments to Rule 37—continues with their claim that Infosys should have preserved back-up
tapes maintained solely to allow “disaster recovery.” Cases cited by Plaintiffs address
“accessible” backup tapes; the law is clear, however, that litigation holds and other reasonable
preservation efforts generally do “not apply to inaccessible backup tapes (e.g., those typically
maintained solely for the purpose of disaster recovery), which may continue to be recycled on
the schedule set forth in the company’s policy.” Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D.
212, 218 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). Nor does Plaintiffs’ insistence that Infosys should have copied its
discovery-recovery tapes otherwise make sense: the limited size of Infosys “in-boxes” requires
employees to regularly transfer emails to hard drives; in comparison, any backup tape retrieved
at any time during the seven-day recycling period would contain only a relative few.
In the end, Plaintiffs are left to declare Infosys’s preservation efforts unreasonable
because they are imperfect. Pls.’ Br. 17 (preservation duties are “breached when evidence in a
party’s control is lost.”). But not just unsupported by their authority (Cahill, Jones, or Plunk), 9

9

None of these cases involved a litigation hold on ESI. Cf. Northington v. H&M Int’l, No. 08-CV-6297, 2011 WL
663055, at *16-17 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 12, 2011) (preservation request excluding ESI, and without litigation hold held

16
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 17 of 33 Document 136

this strict liability contradicts the plain terms of Rule 37. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) (allowing
sanctions if ESI “is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it”). As the
advisory notes point out, “reasonable steps” do not require “perfection”; in fact, the “everincreasing volume” of ESI makes “preserving all relevant electronically stored information []
often impossible.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 advisory committee’s notes (2015 amendment). Here,
moreover, Plaintiffs’ version of perfection would not merely have involved efforts to copy
documents stored by Kedia and Jalona; companywide class allegations would have required the
impossible: collection of (among other things) all ESI on all hard drives used by more than one
hundred custodians at a time when pleadings had been closed for little more than a month. 10
Indeed, Plaintiffs would improperly saddle Infosys with a preservation duty far more onerous
than any burden imposed through discovery itself. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1)
(limiting discovery to what is relevant and proportional to case needs considering, inter alia,
whether burden or expense “outweighs its likely benefit”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 advisory
committee’s notes (2015 amendment) (“Another factor in evaluating the reasonableness of
preservation efforts is proportionality.”). And proving as much, Infosys has never been required
to undertake this mammoth collection project despite the multiple conferences on custodians and
data retrieval already held by the Court. 11
In sum, Plaintiffs identify no support—in fact or law—for their claim that Infosys failed
to take reasonable efforts to preserve the vast quantities of ESI they deem relevant to

unreasonable) (cited by Plaintiffs); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ecowater Sys., Inc., No. 02 C 50415, 2004 WL 1073687,
at *2 (N.D. Ill. May 12, 2004) (finding fault in failure to preserve a water heater in its control) (cited by Plaintiffs).
10
Someone (presumably Jalona) “wiped” the laptop assigned to Jalona on August 6, 2015; Infosys filed its Answer
to the Second Amended Complaint barely a month earlier on June 6, 2015.
11
To the contrary, Plaintiffs spent months equivocating about the custodians that they wanted to use for ESI
collection, proposing a series of different custodians in the summer of 2016; after Plaintiffs selected the individuals
they wanted to use (following Infosys’s disclosure of which custodians had usable ESI and which did not), Infosys
began its ESI production–which ultimately comprised several hundred thousand pages of documents. (Boshkoff
Decl. ¶ 19).

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 18 of 33 Document 136

companywide allegations of intentional discrimination. Under the plain terms of Rule 37(e),
their spoliation motion must be denied.
2.

Plaintiffs cannot show the prejudice required by Rule 37(e).

Plaintiffs’ sanctions request also fails because they cannot show prejudice. Though
Plaintiffs declare “prejudice” inessential to any award of sanctions, Rule 37(e) says otherwise.
Absent the specific intent to deprive another party of evidence, Rule 37 allows sanctions only
“upon [a] finding [of] prejudice to another party from loss of the information” and only to the
extent “necessary to cure the prejudice.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(1). In other words, sanctions are
unwarranted unless lost ESI deprived Plaintiffs of material support for their claims.
Here, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy this standard. They tout a former recruiter’s allegations
that Sanjay Jalona, an executive in Manufacturing & Engineering Services, instructed him to
stick to “Indian candidates.” But credibility problems aside (including the mis-identification of
Jalona as a head of recruiting), these allegations bear on an unpleaded discriminatory recruitment
claim, rather than Plaintiffs’ discriminatory hiring claims. See Defs.’ Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for
Class Certification, Dkt. 103, 11, 27. The other rationale for Jalona’s relevance—his alleged role
in Handloser’s termination—is equally insufficient. As Infosys’s motion for summary judgment
showed, Handloser was terminated through a companywide RIF, not executive fiat. See Mem. in
Support of Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. 80, 31-34. Nor do the emails recovered from other
custodians remotely suggest otherwise. See Pls.’ Br. 19 n.35. And the larger problem with
Plaintiffs’ conjecture about prejudice remains: Any claim that emails from a single 12
manufacturing and engineering manager are needed to support allegations of (or arising from)
purported systemic intentional discrimination across Infosys—and notwithstanding collection of

12

As for ESI relating to Rohit Kedia, Plaintiffs’ claims are premature in light of data recovered by Infosys. In
addition, Infosys has recovered ESI relating to Chris Weber and produced it.

18
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 19 of 33 Document 136

some 2.7 million custodian emails and production of hundreds of thousands of documents—is
facially incredible. Indeed, having known about the loss of ESI for almost a year, Plaintiffs
themselves inexplicably failed to raise the issue during any subsequent discovery conference and
sought no relief until certification and summary judgment briefing had closed.
Plaintiffs’ speculation, in sum, is insufficient to establish that a relatively small loss of
ESI has prejudiced their ability to prove discrimination. For that reason alone, Plaintiffs are not
entitled to sanctions under Rule 37(e).
3.

Rule 37(e) does not authorize the sanctions that Plaintiffs seek.

Plaintiffs’ motion should also be denied because none of the sanctions it requests is
permitted under Rule 37(e). They request, for example, that “evidence of Infosys’ failure to
comply with its discovery obligations” be put before the jury—a sanction that would allow jurors
to “presume the [undiscovered] information was unfavorable” to Infosys. But even permissive
adverse inference sanctions are permitted by Rule 37(e) “only upon finding that the party acted
with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in the litigation.” Rule 37(e)(B);
Moores’s Federal Practice - Civil § 37.121A (“The court may impose the most serious sanctions
only on a finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s
use in the litigation”). Here, Plaintiffs’ failure to identify evidence that Infosys destroyed ESI
intentionally, let alone for the specific purpose of withholding it, precludes sanctions under Rule
37. See Faas v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 532 F.3d 633, 644 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding “speculation
that [documents] were destroyed to hide discriminatory information” insufficient).
Plaintiffs also ask that Infosys “be compelled to produce all documents responsive to
Requests 1-3 of Plaintiffs Third Set of Document Requests (Ex. 26), including documents
sufficient to show the steps it took to preserve documents, the dates, recipients, and contents of
litigation hold notices, and identification of document and email servers used by relevant
19
US.112032679.04

custodians and any steps taken to pull backup tapes from these servers (or otherwise preserve
their contents).” But this request for privileged communications has no apparent bearing on the
limited ESI at issue here—i.e., information previously stored on the laptops of Kedia and Jalona;
it therefore violates the Rule 37(e) limitation that courts “order measures no greater than
necessary to cure the prejudice.” Infosys, moreover, has already disclosed its preservation
efforts to the extent not covered by attorney client privilege 13 in correspondence and briefing,
and has proceeded through a lengthy Court-assisted negotiation of relevant custodians/ESI,
rendering this “sanction” unreasonably cumulative, duplicative, and moot. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(b)(2)(C)(i) (providing the Court “must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise
allowed . . . [when it is] unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some
other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive”). 14
Plaintiffs’ request that Infosys “be ordered to conduct a supplemental search for
documents from Sanjay Jalona, Rohit Kedia, Chris Weber, and any other custodian whose
13

Legal hold letters and other document preservation methods are not discoverable to the extent they contain
material protected by attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine. See Major Tours, Inc., et al. v. Colorel,
No. 05-3091, 2009 WL 2413631, at *3-5 (D.N.J. Aug 4, 2009) (emphasis added); see also Muro v. Target Corp.,
250 F.R.D. 350, 360 (N.D. Ill. 2007). Though suggesting privileged documents can be discovered as a sanction for
spoliation, Plaintiffs cite cases (confined to a footnote) that address sanctions under old Rule 37(e) and in the context
of large-scale and/or particularly egregious losses or destruction of evidence not at issue here. See, e.g., United
States ex rel. Barko v. Halliburton Co., 74 F. Supp. 3d 183, 191-92 (D.D.C. 2014) (“[A]fter inspecting these
particular litigation hold notices, the Court finds that they are distinguishable from the generic case, and are
therefore discoverable.”); Tate & Lyle Ams., LLC v. Glatt Air Techniques, Inc., No. 13–2037, 2014 WL 10209161,
at *2-3 (C.D. Ill. Aug. 4, 2014) (ordering disclosure of litigation hold letters delayed more than three years after it
considered litigation, causing widespread destruction of documents); Home Instead, Inc. v. Florance, No.
8:12CV264, 2013 WL 5979629, at *2-3 (D. Neb. Nov. 8, 2013) (acknowledging while “typically the court would
not require such a response to discovery,” admissions of not looking for information, and shredding, selling, and
discarding relevant documents warranted order requiring “a concerted effort to further respond to discovery”);
Magnetar Techs. Corp. v. Six Flags Theme Park, Inc., 886 F. Supp. 2d 466, 489-90 (D. Del. 2012) (allowing
discovery into attorney-client privileged litigation hold letters due to the “extensive number of documents
destroyed”); Cannata v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp., No. 2:10–cv–00068, 2011 WL 3495987, at *2-3 (D. Nev. Aug.
10, 2011) (allowing inquiry into non-privileged preservation topics); United Med. Supply Co. v. United States, 77
Fed. Cl. 257, 261-63 (Fed. Cl. 2007) (ordering government to file its litigation notices after finding that entire
agencies with a stake in the litigation were unaware of its existence).
14
To the extent Plaintiffs alternatively seek this information through an untimely motion to compel, they make no
such argument and almost wholly fail to address Infosys’s objections. See, e.g., Clinchfield Ry. Co. v. Lynch, 700
F.2d 126, 132 n.10 (4th Cir. 1983) (noting that objection shifts burden to requesting party to file motion to compel).
Infosys’s responses served on Sept. 19, 2016 objected, for example, that these requests were variously overbroad,
unduly burdensome, not relevant or proportional, and protected by attorney-client and work product privileges.

20
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 21 of 33 Document 136

documents have not been fully preserved, and seek the return of any Infosys ESI and documents
still in Mr. Jalona’s possession” is also moot and duplicative; this has already been done, as
Plaintiffs would have discovered from conferral with Infosys.
And Plaintiffs’ request for permission to “take necessary depositions following
production of the foregoing materials” is, at best, premature. Rule 37(e) does not permit this
relief unless and until Plaintiffs show a particular deposition is “necessary to cure . . . prejudice.”
See generally CSC Holdings, Inc. v. Redisi, 309 F.3d 988, 993 (7th Cir. 2002) (noting a court
may refuse to compel depositions that would not help explore a “material issue.”).
In short, the requested sanctions fall outside the scope of Rule 37(e) and must be denied.
C.

Neither Rule 26(g) nor Rule 37(d) authorizes sanctions against Infosys for its
discovery responses and communications relating to PeopleFluent.

Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions relating to “PeopleFluent documents” also fails on the
merits. Though Plaintiffs claim Infosys violated the certification requirement of Rule 26(g), that
requirement applies to responses to discovery requests, not every discussion that comes
afterwards. And though Plaintiffs claim Infosys violated Rule 37(d) by excluding various
PeopleFluent documents from a discovery response that included overbreadth objections and all
relevant data, Rule 37(d) applies when a party has failed to provide any response at all. This is a
sanctions demand in search of a rule authorizing sanctions. It must be denied.
1.

Plaintiffs identify no basis for sanctions under Rule 26(g).

Plaintiffs’ attempt to apply Rule 26(g) to a discovery mediation chart—drafted by
Plaintiffs—fails as a matter of law. Rule 26(g) applies to an attorney’s certification of discovery
responses through a signature. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g) (“Every disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) or
(a)(3) and every discovery request, response, or objection must be signed by at least one attorney
of record in the attorney’s own name—or by the party personally, if unrepresented—and must

21
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 22 of 33 Document 136

state the signer’s address, e-mail address, and telephone number.”). As committee notes clarify,
this “certification speaks as of the time it is made.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee’s
notes (1983 amendment). An attorney signature on a party’s responses to a request for
production thus certifies, as of the signature date, that responses and objections are consistent
with the federal rules and warranted by law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1)(B)(i).
Here, the certification in question appeared on Infosys’s August 26, 2015 discovery
responses and objections. Addressing a request for all “[d]ocuments and ESI relating to the
demographics or statistics of Infosys’ United States work force, including, but not limited to,
EEO reports, studies, or other documents reflecting the statistics of the workforce”:
•

Infosys specifically objected (among other things) to its overbreadth in reaching
positions other than “base hires,” and that “the term ‘statistics of the workforce’
renders the request vague and ambiguous”;

•

with respect to its call for ESI, Infosys invited “Plaintiffs to meet and confer
regarding appropriate search terms and custodians, pursuant to Seventh Circuit
protocol”; and

•

Infosys agreed to produce responsive EEO-1 reports as well as other specific
documents.

(See Boshkoff Decl. Ex. 3 (Infosys Limited’s Am. Response to Pls.’ First Request for Prod. of
Documents, Response No. 5 (emphasis added))).
Foreclosing Rule 26(g) sanctions, none of this has been challenged by Plaintiffs. And
what Plaintiffs want sanctioned instead—a failure to edit one line on a multi-page discovery
chart they themselves created—is not a certification of any kind. Indeed, the very context of this
chart (and two-line transmission email) makes non-sense of Plaintiffs’ argument that it triggers

22
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 23 of 33 Document 136

Rule 26(g): The chart was used in a discovery mediation intended to address (inter alia) Infosys’
objections about vagueness and overbreadth. It was a multi-page summary of “the status of its
response to each document request” created by Plaintiffs, and edited by Infosys only by revising
the “Outstanding Issues” portion and adding a column for “Updates.” 15 And it was not even
final, but reflected (as Plaintiffs’ initial email notes) on-going negotiations between the parties.
Exh 30. Putting aside the missing signature, a single sentence under “Infosys’s Description of
Responsive Documents” to Request No. 5 could represent—at most—Infosys’s understanding of
what documents would be produced at a particular stage in the negotiation; it could not possibly
certify that no other documents might fit terms Infosys had already called “vague” and
“overbroad.” Exh. 31. See generally Sheets v. Yamaha Motors Corp., U.S.A., 849 F.2d 179, 186
(5th Cir. 1988) (stating that Rule 26(g) “applies exclusively to discovery requests, responses, and
objections”). Cf. Phinney v. Paulshock, 181 F.R.D. 185, 203–04 (D.N.H. 1998), aff’d sub nom.
Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp., 199 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding original response to
discovery in the form of a letter “constitutes a ‘certification’ pursuant to Rule 26(g)(2)”). 16
Plaintiffs, in short, are not complaining about a discovery certification, let alone one that
violates Infosys’s legal obligations. They identify no basis for sanctions under Rule 26(g).
2.

Plaintiffs identify no basis for sanctions under Rule 37(d).

15

The email recites, in full: “This is an updated discovery chart. I am hopeful that we can use this to narrow some
of the issues that need to be presented to the court.” (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 10).
16
Plaintiffs’ sole authority on correspondence in the context of a Rule 26(g) violation involves actionable
certifications in original discovery responses and affirmance of those certifications in later correspondence. See In
re Delta/AirTran, 846 F. Supp. 2d 1335, 1350 (rejecting claim that “counsel made reasonable inquiries prior to
signing the certifications” of response to document request and finding the problem compounded by unequivocal
statements to the court that production was complete); Metro. Opera Ass’n, Inc. v. Local 100, Hotel Employees &
Rest. Employees Int’l Union, 212 F.R.D. 178, 221 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (finding “counsel’s responses to the Met’s
discovery requests, in formal responses, in letters and to the Court—particularly counsel’s repeated representations
that all responsive documents had been produced—were made without any real reflection or concern for their
obligations under the rules governing discovery…”). Cf. Nationwide Agribusiness, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8289, at
*12 (awarding fees as sanction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(3) and 37(c)(1) for misleading supplemental disclosure).

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 24 of 33 Document 136

Plaintiffs’ request that the Court sanction Infosys under Rule 37(d)—a claim relating not
to the discovery mediation chart, but to Infosys’s production of fewer than all PeopleFluent
documents in its original Request No. 5 response—is equally unsupported. Titled, “Party’s
Failure to Attend Its Own Deposition, Serve Answers to Interrogatories, or Respond to a Request
for Inspection,” Rule 37(d) addresses just that: a party’s complete failure to respond to a
discovery request. There is some split of authority on “whether Rule 37(d) sanctions may be
imposed when a party has responded to interrogatories or a request for inspection, but the
response is so inadequate that it is tantamount to a complete failure to respond.” 7-37 Moore's
Federal Practice - Civil § 37.91 (2016). Cf. David Mizer Enters., Inc. v. Nexstar Broad., Inc.,
No. 14-cv-2192, 2016 WL 4541825, at *4 (C.D. Ill. Aug. 31, 2016) (addressing response that
“Defendant does not have any documents which respond to this request”). But there is no
argument that a response is sanctionable under Rule 37(d) merely because it falls short of
“complete.” Though Plaintiffs claim that an “[a]n “incomplete disclosure . . . must be treated as
a failure to disclose” under Rule 37(a)(4), that provision “limits its own reach to subdivision (a)”
and its maximum sanction of expense-shifting. 7 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal
Practice § 37.91. Subsection (d), in contrast, exists outside Rule 37’s “system of progressive
discipline” and applies only to blatant discovery abuses nowhere alleged here. Id. at § 37.90
(distinguishing Rule 37(d) as applying to “the most blatant forms of discovery noncompliance”
and allowing courts to sanction in the first instance).
Nor could Plaintiffs make any colorable claim that a production of all relevant data and
over 50,000 pages of documents—including affirmative action plans with statutory performance
goals—is tantamount to no production at all. In response to a request for all “documents and ESI
relating to the demographics or statistics of Infosys’ [U.S.] work force,” Infosys timely:

•

Produced (on November 24, 2015) its human resources and applicant tracking data
relating to all applicants and employees for the relevant time period in 65
spreadsheets with employment dates, compensation, race/ethnicity, position titles,
project assignments, and applicant interviewing data (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 4);

•

Produced the data in its “raw” form as kept in the ordinary course of business but
included, with each spreadsheet, employee identification numbers allowing
information to be readily linked and analyzed by Plaintiffs’ expert (March 6, 2017,
Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 3 (ECF No. 128-1); Siskin Supp. Rpt. 6 (Dkt. 125-2));

•

Provided tutoring (at its own expense) through charts identifying each spreadsheet by
name and category, a data dictionary defining all 407 data fields with “look up tables”
defining certain activity codes, and through exemplars illustrating how the data could
be used (March 6, 2017, Boshkoff Decl. ¶¶ 4-13 (ECF No. 128-1); see also Neumark
Rpt. App’x 6 (Dkt. 87-1) (identifying data dictionaries as information relied upon); 17
and

•

Provided PeopleFluent affirmative action plans (“AAPs”) containing analyses of
“placement goals” and “utilization rates.” (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 5).

Also contrary to Plaintiffs’ claims here, this data production included more data than was given
to PeopleFluent for its affirmative action analyses. (Id. ¶ 4).
Plaintiffs’ claim, in short, that this mammoth production (what Plaintiffs call “incredibly
voluminous” data) violates Rule 37(d) is baseless. Plaintiffs’ motion must be denied. 18

Counsel also responded to multiple inquiries clarification of certain points as requested by Plaintiffs’ counsel and
met for hours to provide clarification. (March 6, 2017, Boshkoff Decl. ¶¶ 4-13 (ECF No. 128-1)). Plaintiffs’ claim
that “this raw data was …disaggregated, and difficult to understand” is unsupported and contradicted by the ability
of Infosys’s expert to produce his report without any of the tutoring provided to Plaintiffs.
18
Contrary to claims that Infosys’s counsel “admitted considering producing the PeopleFluent analyses, but chose
not to do so…” (see Pls.’ Br. 14 (emphasis added), counsel explained that when producing the data ultimately

3.

More discovery would violate the proportionality requirement of Rule 26.

Plaintiffs also fail to justify the specific sanctions they seek under Rule 26(g) and 37(d)—
namely, “documents and ESI related to [Infosys’s] affirmative action program, including data
provided to and received from PeopleFluent, communications with PeopleFluent, documents
regarding placement goals, and communications among Infosys’ affirmative action anchors and
steering committee members regarding its affirmative action program and efforts.” Pls.’ Br. 25.
Indeed, these requests abandon any semblance of Rule 26 proportionality. 19 The record is clear
that Infosys provided all data given to PeopleFluent—the outside vendor who prepares its
regulation-mandated affirmative action plans—as well as affirmative action plans and
performance goals with its original production, and that it subsequently produced an additional
170,000-plus pages of intermediate and ancillary reports such as “counts” and “roll-ups” of
employees by race and location. (Boshkoff Decl. ¶ 6). Yet having devoted (now) three briefs to
this subject, Plaintiffs remain unable to extract from this trove of data and documents a single
relevant, non-duplicative fact. As Infosys more fully explained in its class certification and
Daubert briefs:
•

The PeopleFluent “analyses” that purportedly “help demonstrate that Infosys
discriminated” are not analyses at all, but “counts” by race of people hired, promoted,
and terminated by Infosys—computations that provide no point of demographic
comparison (e.g., a racial breakdown of eligible or similarly situated employees) or
control for variables other than race—nor have Plaintiffs offered any expert opinion
to the contrary; (Siskin Supp. Rpt. 6 (ECF No. 125-2); cf. Pls.’ Br. 8-9 (“PeopleFluent

provided to Plaintiffs, she decided not to replicate data given to PeopleFluent because it was incomplete and
therefore insufficient. Declaration of Rozlyn Fulgoni-Britton (“Fulgoni-Britton Decl.”), Exhibit E, ¶¶ 5-7.
19
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(i) (providing that the Court “must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise
allowed . . . [when] unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source.”).

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 27 of 33 Document 136

analyzes relevant labor markets . . . and the disparity exists at the corporate level,
across business units, across job categories, and across geographies”));
•

PeopleFluent could not perform reliable analyses because Infosys provided no data on
variables that would allow meaningful statistical analysis of alleged discrimination,
(Siskin Supp. Rpt. 3-4 (ECF No. 125-2)); and

•

Regulations expressly provide that a reported placement goal “constitutes neither a
finding nor an admission of discrimination” (41 C.F.R. §60–2.16(b)) and do not even
contemplate placement goals for Caucasians. Cf. Pls.’ Br. 9 (“the disparity far
exceeds placement goals set to try to curb preference for a single race”).

Plaintiffs, in fact, remained sufficiently dissatisfied with their own explanations of
relevance in class certification briefing as to submit a sur-sur-reply with an entirely new theory:
that Infosys’s failure to meet affirmance action performance goals reflected in PeopleFluent
documents establishes discrimination under Mozee v. Am. Comm. Marine Serv. Co., 940 F.2d
1036 (7th Cir. 1991). See also Pls.’ Br. 9 n.20. But it works no better. Whereas Mozee involved
a past discriminator’s failure to implement its affirmative action plans, Plaintiffs accuse Infosys
of not achieving performance goals—something incapable of suggesting discrimination under
the plain terms of the regulations. Mozee, 940 F.2d at 1051 (recognizing the district court’s
conclusion that “[e]vidence of an employer’s failure to follow the requirements of an affirmative
action plan is also relevant, though not conclusive, in determining intentional racial
discrimination”) (emphasis added). And regardless, Infosys included placement goals—the
smokeless “smoking gun”—in its original production.
Having failed, in short, to identify admissible evidence in the staggering volume of
PeopleFluent documents and ESI already produced by Infosys, Plaintiffs are demanding more

27

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 28 of 33 Document 136

discovery of less relevant information—in effect, documents about irrelevant documents. This
discovery is unwarranted. Whether as a “sanction” under Rule 26(g) or 37(d), or as relief for an
unarticulated 20 motion to compel, Plaintiff’s requests violate the proportionality requirement of
Rule 26. See generally 26(b)(1) (limiting discovery to what is proportional to case needs). See
generally Melendez v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 79 F.3d 661, 672 (7th Cir. 1996) (courts should only
impose sanctions “proportionate to the circumstances” of the discovery violation).
D.

Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied as untimely.

Not merely its failure on the merits, but Plaintiffs’ inexplicable delay in filing this motion
should preclude any sanction against Infosys. Though Rule 37 does not provide deadlines, the
Seventh Circuit recognizes that “unreasonable delay may render” a sanctions motion untimely.
Brandt v. Vulcan, Inc., 30 F.3d 752, 756 (7th Cir. 1994). 21 Its decision in Brandt, for example,
affirmed the district court’s denial of a Rule 37 motion as untimely where the plaintiff
suspected—but did nothing to address—the defendant’s alleged failure to provide true and
complete discovery responses until trial. Other courts have found spoliation motions filed in
close proximity to summary judgment untimely. See., e.g., Ferrone v. Onorato, 2007 WL
2973684, at *10 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 9, 2007) (finding that spoliation allegations made in opposition
to summary judgment “come too late”). 22 Similarly, inattention to discovery directives and
deadlines has supported findings of unreasonable delay. See MGA Entertainment, Inc. v.
National Products Ltd., No. CV 10-07083, 2012 WL 4052023, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2012).

20

The Court should also deny any motion to compel because Plaintiffs make no Rule 37(a) argument.
See generally Kaplan v. Zenner, 956 F.2d 149, 152 (7th Cir. 1992) (“Prompt filings of motions for sanctions after
discovery of an abuse best serve both the systemic and case-specific deterrent functions of Rule 11.”).
22
See also Glenn v. Scott Paper Co., No. 92-1873, 1993 WL 431161, at *10 n.3 (D.N.J. Oct. 20, 1993) (rejecting
spoliation claim “first brought defending a summary judgment motion after completion of discovery” and without
earlier motions as untimely); Morse Diesel Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 81 Fed. Cl. 220, 222 (Fed. Cl. 2008) (finding
spoliation sanctions motion filed after ruling on partial summary judgment untimely); see generally Goodman v.
Praxair Servs., Inc., 632 F.Supp.2d 494, 507 (D. Md. 2009) (noting that “a court should examine the temporal
proximity between a spoliation motion and motions for summary judgment” to determine timeliness of motion).

The reasoning of these decisions is straightforward. The least disruptive time to impose
discovery sanctions is during discovery:
Reopening discovery, even if for a limited purpose, months after it has closed or
after dispositive motions have been filed… can completely disrupt the pretrial
schedule, involve significant cost, and burden the court and parties. Courts are
justifiably unsympathetic to litigants who, because of inattention, neglect, or
purposeful delay aimed at achieving an unwarranted tactical advantage, attempt to
reargue a substantive issue already ruled on by the court through the guise of a
spoliation motion, or use such a motion to try to reopen or prolong discovery
beyond the time allotted in the pretrial order.
Goodman, 632 F.Supp.2d at 508 (emphasis added).
Here, Plaintiffs offer no justification for a delay that could upend more than six months of
class-related litigation. Though focused exclusively on the sanction of additional discovery,
Plaintiffs filed this motion eight months after discovery closed on September 16, 2016. (ECF
No. 61). Plaintiffs delayed for almost a year after being told in July of 2016 that Infosys could
not locate “usable ESI” for Jalona and Kedia; and they waited months after being instructed to
resolve discovery issues relating to PeopleFluent in January of 2017. (Boshkoff Decl. Ex. 7;
ECF No. 112 (directing parties to work out a plan to handle PeopleFluent documents)). But
more inexplicably still, Plaintiffs waited to seek what they now describe as critical evidence until
months after briefing had closed on motions for summary judgment against the named Plaintiffs,
on their own class-wide motion for partial summary judgment, on their class certification
motion, and on Infosys’s motion to exclude the opinions of their expert. In other words,
Plaintiffs stood by while the parties submitted hundreds of pages of potentially dispositive
evidence and briefing to the Court.
None of this could be described as reasonable. Nor do Plaintiffs even explain what they
intend to do with the discovery they now seek. Would they try to re-open all or part of briefing
that has already occupied the parties for eight months? Would they wait for rulings that could
29
US.112032679.04

Case 2:13-cv-00885-PP-DEJ Filed 05/22/17 Page 30 of 33 Document 136

render these requests—and all the effort and expense they impose on Infosys—moot? Either
way, the immense costs of their delay dwarf any minimal benefit of expanding discovery.
Compare MGA Entertainment, Inc., 2012 WL 4052023, at *5 (denying sanctions motion as
unreasonably delayed where defendants allowed discovery and motion hearing deadlines to pass
“after being specifically ordered by the District Judge on May 10, 2012 to meet and confer
regarding sanctions issues”); with Goodman, 632 F. Supp. 2d at 509 (though “difficult” not to
deny motion filed “two months after dispositive motions had been fully briefed” as untimely,
court allowed sanctions motion that (among other things) did not affect summary judgment or
require additional discovery). 23 Having failed to ask for more time and discovery before the
parties completed six months of briefing on potentially case-ending motions, plaintiffs should
not be permitted to re-open discovery now.
E.

Infosys is entitled to its fees in defending this unwarranted motion.

Finally, Plaintiffs’ request for fees under Rule 37(d) and (e) is unsupported by any
grantable request, and would reward their failure to work in good faith to resolve this dispute.
Rather, Rule 37(a)(5)(B) entitles Infosys to its “reasonable expenses” in opposing this motion.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied and Infosys granted its reasonable expenses.

Delay of almost eight months after the discovery deadline is clearly fatal to the extent Plaintiffs rely on a motion
to compel. See, e.g., Packman v. Chicago Tribune Co., 267 F.3d 628, 647 (7th Cir. 2001) (no abuse of discretion in
finding motion to compel filed “after discovery had closed, the summary judgment briefing schedule had been set,
and defendants had filed their summary judgment motion” untimely). See also Mortle v. United Parcel Service, No.
05-cv-117, 2006 WL 776745, at *1 (E.D. Wis. Mar. 27, 2006) (“A district court may properly deny a motion to
compel discovery where the motion to compel was filed after the close of discovery.”).
