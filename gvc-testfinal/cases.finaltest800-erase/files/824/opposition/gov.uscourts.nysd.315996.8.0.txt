PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiffs Novoship (UK) Limited ("Novoship"), Cally Shipholdings Inc. ("Cally"), Vital
Shipping Corporation ("Vital"), and Dainford Navigation Inc. ("Dainford'") (collectively
"Plaintiffs"), submit this Memorandum of Law in opposition to Defendants' motion to vacate.

For the reasons set forth below, the motion should be denied in its entirety.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND FACTS

On November 7, 2007, Plaintiffs filed a Verified Complaint against Defendants Wilmer
Ruperti ("Ruperti''), Sea Pioneer Shipping Corporation ("Sea Pioneer"), and PMI Trading Inc.
("PMY"), alleging admiralty claims grounded in contract and fraud associated with the long-term
time charters of Plaintiffs' ocean-going tankers. (See, e.g., Verified Complaint at 410, 11, 15,
44-50). At the time of filing, Plaintiffs applied for and were granted an order of attachment
pursuant to Supplemental Admiralty Rule B seeking a restraint of Defendants' assets in the
amount $17,149,420.00. Process of Maritime Attachment ("PMAG") was issued and served on
a variety of banking institutions, but, to date, only a limited sum has been restrained
(approximately 18% of the amount stated in the PMAG).'

Defendants have filed a motion to vacate, grounded essentially on the argument that the
claims are not maritime and hence will not support admiralty jurisdiction or entitlement to an
attachment under Rule B. Defendants' motion is flawed, however, because they ignore the

fundamental maritime nature of the fraud, its clear impact on vessels trading on navigable

 

' Almost immediately upon initial service, transfers involving these Defendants were restrained. Notice
was then provided as per the Local Rules. Since that point in time, however, virtually no further restraints
have occurred. To the extent the vast majority of ocean transportation contracts designate payments in
U.S. dollars, which must clear through U.S. clearinghouse banks, it is presumed that Defendants are now
transferring their funds in the names of yet other shell entities controlled by Defendant Ruperti in an
effort to mask those transfers and circumvent the Court's order of attachment.

NYDOCS1/295438 I 1
Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLG Document8 Filed 12/13/2007 Page 4 of 23

waters. Further they fail to consider the contractual aspects of these claims which involve
charter party contracts, diversion of charter hire and fraudulent control of vessels at sea. Simply
saying that the claims are land based does not make it so, nor does the effort to re-cast them in
that light. There is no legitimate basis upon which this Court's exercise of admiralty jurisdiction
over the subject claims should be limited.

Turning to the facts, and in broad outline, Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants involve
both contractual and tort grounded theories of recovery arising out of multiple long-term time
charters of Plaintiffs' tanker vessels - including the M/T MARSHAL CHUYKOV, M/T
MOSCOW KREMLIN, and M/T MOSCOW STARS.' (Verified Complaint at 1, 10, 11, 15, 44-
50.) The merits of the claims are now the subject of a London High Court litigation, and the
captioned action was commenced as an adjunct to that litigation to obtain security and to ensure,
as a consequence of the seizure of assets, the Defendants' meaningful participation. (Verified
Complaint at 951-53). As such, this Court will not be called upon, nor do Defendants ask the
Court, to reach any determination about the merits.

To the extent Defendants' challenge to the attachment focuses on the maritime nature of
Plaintiffs' claims, however, some discussion of the facts is necessary to enable the Court to
conduct its review. Plaintiffs therefore provide the following review of the facts which confirm
the admiralty and maritime nature of the circumstances giving to Plaintiffs' claims.'

Briefly, through a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Defendant Ruperti (acting on his

own behalf and through his two shell corporations - Defendants Sea Pioneer and PMI) and

 

* Plaintiff Cally was the owner of the M/IT MARSHAL CHUYKOYV, Vital was the owner of the M/T
MOSCOW KREMLIN and Dainford was the owner of the M/T MOSCOW STARS. Novoship acted as

an agent and general manager for the owning companies and the vessels themselves. (Verified Complaint
at 2-5.)

* The facts are further discussed in the accompanying Declaration of Vladimar Petromsho Oskirko and
are also discussed within the argument section of this memorandum.

Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLG Document8 Filed 12/13/2007 Page5 of 23

Vladimir Mikhaylyuk ("Mikhaylyuk'), a dishonest employee of Plaintiff Novoship, Plaintiffs'
vessels were chartered, unbeknownst to them, to shell entities created by Ruperti. (Verified
Complaint at 96, 16-19, 25-32, 37-38, 45, 48-50, and Oskirko Dec'|. at 0x00A76 and 12.) The purpose
and effect of the scheme was to enable Defendants to gain control (as time charterers) of the
trading capacity of these vessels, all the while leaving Novoship with the mistaken impression
that the charter parties had in fact been effected directly with Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
("PDVSA"). PDVSA is an agency of the Venezuelan government and a major charterer of oil
carrying vessels in world-wide trade. (Verified Complaint at 913.)

To effectuate their subterfuge, Defendant Ruperti and Mikhaylyuk falsified the charter
party documents so as to create a paper record at Novoship which reflected such direct charters
between Plaintiffs Cally/Vital/Dainford, as owners, and PDVSA, as charterer (the "fake
charters"). (Verified Complaint at 910-11, 15-28, 32-37, 44, 47.) It was subsequently
discovered, however, that no such direct contractual relationship existed. (Oskirko Dec'l. at 4.)
Instead, the actual charterers were the Ruperti shell entities, - PMI and Sea Pioneer - who in turn
had the direct contractual relationships with PDVSA (hereinafter the "secret" or "actual"
charters). (Verified Complaint at (15, 19, 31, 38 and 47.) Absent a contractual relationship with
PDVSA, it was thus Ruperti and his two shell entities which had the time charter control over
Plaintiffs' vessels and, equally important, the time charter obligations and duties owed to
Plaintiffs under the terms of the time charter agreements. (Verified Complaint at 15, 19, 31, 38
and 47 and Oskirko Dec'l at 7-10.) In their capacity as "secret" middle charterers, defendants
positioned themselves to manipulating the charter rates in the fake charters, mask from Novoship
the actual daily earnings of the vessels, and create a spread between what was being paid by

PDVSA and what was being forwarded to Novoship so as to enable them to skim the difference

NYDOCS1/295438,1 3
Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLC Document8 Filed 12/13/2007 Page 6 of 23

- a difference which was sizable amounting to millions of dollars. (Verified Complaint at 15,
24, 36, 42-47),

Contrary to Defendants' suggestion, these transactions and fraudulent schemes had direct
far effect beyond the shoreline, and beyond the initial conspiratorial exchanges. The direct effect
of Defendants' actions was the creation of fake and secret charter parties which enabled them to
gain total control of the operation, movement, and earnings of Plaintiffs' vessels under
circumstances where they masked the true identity of the charterer. (Verified Complaint at 4]10-
11, 15-16, 19, 21-27, 32, 37, 44 and 47; and Oskirko Dec'l. at (7-10) This control continued for
years during the duration of the charters, as the Defendants skimmed the hire twice a month as it
was being paid to them by PDVSA. The fraud continued throughout the entire period as it was
the Defendants who issued the trading and sailing orders to Plaintiffs, and effectively controlled
the vessels as they carried cargo, unbeknownst to Novoship. (Verified Complaint at 26.)

More importantly, the entire time the vessels were trading under the secret/actual
charters, Defendants placed Plaintiffs at risk for a multitude of liabilities flowing from the fact
that the time charterer's obligations and duties owed to Plaintiffs were the responsibility of the
Ruperti and his shell entities, not the substantial oil giant PDVSA. (Oskirko Dec'l. at {[6-12). In
time charter transactions such as these, the charterer assumes significant aspects of the vessel's
physical operation. The charterer is given essentially unfettered discretion to trade the vessel
worldwide, and it selects the load and discharge ports, and hence the trading pattern of the
vessel, (Oskirko Dec'l. at 9.) It bunkers the vessel. It is responsible for arranging tugs, pilots,
etc. As a consequence, significant duties and liabilities attach to a time charterer under a time

charter contract, and hence, the financial wherewithal of a potential charterer is of critical import

NYDOCS1/295438.1 4
Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLG Document8 Filed 12/13/2007 Page 7 of 23

in a vessel owner's assessment of whether to enter into the contract with a particular entity.
(Oskirko Dec'L. at 10-12.)

As outlined in the accompanying Declaration, had the true identity of the chartering
entities been disclosed, Plaintiffs would have never entered into these charter transactions with
the Ruperti shell entities and Defendants would have never obtained control of these vessels or
had the opportunity to skim the vessels' daily earnings. (Oskirko Decl. at 6 and 12.) The fake
charters and this fraudulent scheme had a continuing impact on the vessels' operations, carnings
and movements throughout the life of the charter party contracts, (Verified Complaint at (15, 24,
36 and 42.) Defendants' effort to paint this transaction and fraud as being limited solely to land
based activity bears no resemblance to the reality of the situation. If a claim involving fake
charters, skimmed hire, and fraudulent control of vessels plying the high seas does not provide
the Court with a viable case under admiralty jurisdiction, one would have to question when such
jurisdiction would ever exist.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
POINT I
DEFENDANTS CANNOT BRING ON A MOTION TO DISMISS
UNDER THE GUISE OF A RULE E VACATUR APPLICATION. THUS, THE
COURT'S REVIEW IS NOT CONSTRAINED TO AN ANALYSIS
OF JUST THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE VERIFIED COMPLAINT
Defendants have filed a motion to vacate the attachment and dismiss the complaint. They

seek this relief under Supplemental Rule E and its accelerated time provision calling for a

substantive hearing in as little as three days notice. (See Defendant's letter application to the

NYDOCS 1/295438.1 5
Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLC Document8 Filed 12/13/2007 Page 8 of 23

Court dated December 7, 2007, citing Rule E(4)(f) and Local Rule E.1 as the basis for expedited
treatment.)*

An application to vacate under Supplemental Rule E(4)(f) is a specialized maritime
proceeding with the singular purpose of determming the on-going propriety of a maritime
attachment under Supplemental Rule B. Maersk, Inc. v. Neewra, Inc., 443 F.Supp.2d 519, 530
(S.D.N.Y. 2006). Such a proceeding is not the vehicle under which a motion to dismiss can be
submitted, and a motion to vacate is not a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b). Jd.

When a party seeks vacatur pursuant to a Rule E, the plaintiff bears the burden to show
that the attachment should not be vacated, and the standard to be met is a reasonable grounds or
probable cause standard. Maersk, 443 F.Supp.2d at 527. The court's review of whether
reasonable grounds exist for the attachment is not limited to the adequacy of the allegations in
the Complaint, but rather, the court may consider any manner of evidence offered in the parties'
papers or at the post-attachment hearing, which can include documents, affidavits, declarations,
or testimony. Id. (citing Linea Naviera de Cabotaje, C.A. v. Mar Caribe de Navegacion, C.A.,
169 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1348, 1357-58 (N.D. Fla. 2001)).0x00B0

Defendants' reliance on Ronda Ship Mgmt. Inc. v. Doha Asian Games Organizing

Comm., 511 F.Supp.2d 399 (S.D.N.Y. 2007), for the proposition that this Court's review should

 

4 A motion to dismiss would require, at a minimum, a ten business day period between filing and

opposition. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(d) and Local Rule 6.1(b).
> Even if the Defendants had properly moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b), which they have not, the
Court would nevertheless be free to consider other evidence outside the complaint. See e.g. Gonzales v.
United States, 284 F.3d 281, 287-88 (1" Cir. 2002) (court is free in Rule 12 context to examine
documents referred to in the complaint); Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 229, n.10 (2000) (opponent
in Rule 12 motion can clarify allegations of pleading in briefs). When considering a motion to dismiss for
lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the court is not confined to the complaint, however. It may consider
evidence outside the pleadings, such as affidavits. See Antares Aiarcarft, L.P. v Federal Republic of
Nigeria, 948 F.2d 90, 96 (2d Cir. 1991), vacated on other grounds, 505 U.S. 1215 (1992).

be limited to the face of the complaint only, is misplaced. (See Defendants' Memorandum at 4,
n.3.} In Ronda, the defendant sought vacatur under several grounds, including an alleged failure
to state an admiralty claim. In support of this, it argued that it had never signed the charters. In
so doing, however, the defendant improperly couched a challenge to the merits of the claim as a
challenge to the adequacy of the pleading. The court declined to deal with the merits (i.e. Doha's
argument that it was not a party to the contract). With this out of the way, the court then quickly
dispatched Doha's challenge to the adequacy of the pleading by reviewing the complaint to see if
a contract claim was pled. The case does not stand for the proposition that in a vacatur
application dealing with a challenge to the court's jurisdiction, no other evidence can be
considered. Notably, Doha never challenged the proposition that a claim for a breach of charter
was maritime, but rather claimed it was not a party to a charter. In that scenario, all the court had
to do was look to see whether such a claim was pled in order to evaluate whether the pleading
standard discussed in the Second Circuit's decision in Aqua Stoli Shipping Ltd. v. Gardner Smith
Pty. Ltd., 460 F.3d 434 (2d Cir. 2006) had been met.
POINT I

THE TEST FOR MARITIME TORT JURISDICTION IS MET IN THE CONTEXT OF A
FRAUD CLAIM RELATING TO THE CHARTER OF OCEAN GOING VESSELS

Historically, jurisdiction over a maritime tort action was largely determined by
application of a "locality" test. See, generally, Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U.S, 358, 360 (1990) (citing
The Plymouth, 70 U.S. 20 (1866)). Under this test, the primary focus was whether the tort
occurred on navigable waters. In Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, 409 U.S, 249
(1972), the Supreme Court moved away from a strict locality test and indicated that the emphasis
should be placed on an analysis of whether the alleged wrong bore a significant relationship to

traditional maritime activity.

NYDOCS1/295438, 1 7
Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLC Document8 Filed 12/13/2007 Page 10 of 23

Executive Jet marked this Court's first clear departure from the strict locality

test ..... Noting "significant difficulties with the locality test", we refused to

enter into a debate over whether the tort occurred where the plane had crashed

and been destroyed (the navigable waters of Lake Erie) or where it had struck

the sea gulls (over land), Rather, we held that jurisdiction was lacking because

"the wrong [did not] bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime

activity."
Sisson, 497 U.S. at 360-61 (discussing and quoting Executive Jet's introduction of a nexus
component to the jurisdiction test) (internal citations omitted).

Subsequently, the Supreme Court clarified that the nexus requirement (7.e. wrong having
relationship with maritime commerce) applies in all maritime cases and not just commercial
maritime cases. Foremost Ins. Co., v. Richardson, 457 U.S. 668 (1982) (approving a broader
interpretation of Executive Jet).

In the wake of these pronouncements, courts have since applied a two-part test in
determining whether an exercise of admiralty tort jurisdiction is appropriate in a given
circumstance. A party secking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction in respect to a tort claim
is generally obliged to satisfy the following conditions: (a) connection with maritime activity
(the "nexus" requirement) and (b) location. Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &
Dock Co,, 513 U.S. 527, 534 (1995); Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, 394 F.3d 891, 900 (110x2122 Cir,
2004). However, the more recent authority indicates that while locality is still considered, the
real focus of the inquiry is trained on the question of whether the tort has a substantial
relationship to some traditional maritime activity. Doe, 394 F.3d at 900; Maritima Petroleo v.
Ocean Rig I A.S., 78 F.Supp. 162 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (whether the tort occurred on navigable
waters is "not necessarily determinative."')

Plaintiffs submit that this test should not be applied as rigidly as Defendants suggest so as

to deny an exercise of maritime jurisdiction in a case like this involving traditional maritime
