Defendants Wilmer Ruperti ("Ruperti"), Sea Pioneer Shipping Corporation ("Sea
Pioneer") and PMI Trading, Inc. ("PMI") (collectively, "Defendants") make a restricted
appearance pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P., Supp. Admiralty R. E. (8), and respectfully submit this
Memorandum of Law in support of their Motion to: (a) vacate the Court's November 7, 2007 Ex
Parte Order directing clerk to issue process of maritime attachment and garnishment (the
"November 7 Order") obtained and served by plaintiffs Novoship (UK) Limited ("Novoship"),
Cally Shipholdings, Inc. ("Cally"), Vital Shipping Corporation ("Vital") and Dainford
Navigation, Inc. ("Dainford") (collectively, "Plaintiffs"); (b) vacate the process of maritime
attachment and garnishment (the "PMAG") issued pursuant to the November 7 Order; (c)
preclude any further process under the November 7 Order; (d) dismiss this action in its entirety
with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction; and (e) grant such other and further relief as this
Honorable Court may deem just and proper ("Motion"). Defendants make the instant Motion
pursuant to Supplemental Admiralty Rules B and E, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (2) and (6).
For the reasons stated herein, Defendants respectfully request that their Motion be granted.

I. INTRODUCTION

This Motion concerns the November 7 Order and PMAG issued by the Clerk of this
Court in the amount of $17,149,420 based on the allegations contained in the verified complaint
("Complaint"). In that Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that "[t]his is an admiralty and maritime
claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in that it involves
claims for fraud arising out of maritime charter party contracts relating to vessels used in
maritime commerce." (Complaint 0x00A7 1). Plaintiffs further claim that there is subject matter
jurisdiction for this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1333 - admiralty jurisdiction - and 28 U.S.C.

0x00A7 1331 - federal question jurisdiction. (/d.).

Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLG Document6 Filed 12/07/2007 Page 7 of 23

As more fully set forth below, Plaintiffs' allegations, even if taken as true, fail to state a
prima facie admiralty claim against any of the Defendants. Under numerous Circuit and District
court cases, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims in this case, and the
November 7 Order, and all process thereunder, must be vacated and this action dismissed.
Moreover, because the sole basis for personal jurisdiction over the Defendants is the wrongful
attachment of their property, specifically, electronic fund transfers ("EFTs") passing through this
district, this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over any of the Defendants. Thus, Defendants
respectfully submit that the November 7 Order and all process resulting therefrom should be
vacated, and this matter should be dismissed with prejudice.'

Il. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Plaintiffs' claims in this matter are predicated on a remarkable and improbable
interpretation of certain e-mails allegedly sent between the owners of three vessels and the
charterers of those vessels, some of which Plaintiffs claim are missing from Novoship's
computers. More particularly, Plaintiffs imply, but do not explicitly allege, that Vladimir
Mikhaylyuk, Novoship's General Manager and Director, deleted or destroyed certain emails to
conceal the identity of the charterer in the charter party agreements for the vessels from his
employer. (Complaint J) 9, 23, 31). Plaintiffs further allege that Mr. Mikhaylyuk
misrepresented the identity of the charterer in reports he issued to others at Novoship, and that
Defendant Sea Pioneer made three payments to an account at the Bank of Nevis owned by Pulley
Shipping, which Plaintiffs characterize as bribes and or secret commissions paid to Mr.

Mikhaylyuk. (Complaint 0x00A70x00A7 21, 22, 32, 33, 43, 48). Plaintiffs claim that the purpose of this

 

' In the alternative, and as discussed more fully below, should the Court decide otherwise, Defendants respectfully

submit that the amount of the attachment should be reduced.

Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLG Document6 _ Filed 12/07/2007 Page 8 of 23

conduct was to allow Defendants to profit from sub-chartering agreements without Plaintiffs'
knowledge. (Complaint 0x00A7 15).

On the basis of these factual allegations, Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Mikhaylyuk breached
fiduciary duties owed to Novoship, and that Defendants assisted in such breaches as a part of a
conspiracy with Mr. Mikhaylyuk. (Complaint fff 49, 50). Plaintiffs further state that they have
instituted an action in the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court in
London, England based on these allegations, although Plaintiffs do not furnish a copy of the
alleged action commenced by them against Defendants in London, nor do they identify in the
Complaint the precise causes of action they claim to be pursuing in the London court or assert
the substantive law they claim to invoke. (Complaint 0x00A7 51). Plaintiffs claim to bring the instant
action in the Southern District of New York "to obtain jurisdiction over Defendants for
enforcement purposes." (Complaint {ff 51, 52).

The questionable merits of Plaintiffs' factual allegations are not before the Court in the
instant Motion. Rather, the issue before the Court is whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that,
based on those allegations, they possess a valid prima facie admiralty claim against Defendants,
whose assets they have already begun to attach, such that this Court may exercise jurisdiction

over both the claims and the parties hereto."

 

> Plaintiffs do not allege that the action instituted in London's High Court was brought as a maritime claim under
that court's admiralty jurisdiction.

> The merits inquiry at this juncture is limited to the determination of whether the claim as presented and supported
by Plaintiffs is prima facie valid. In the admiralty context, the prima facie standard requires a court to look only to
the complaint to determine whether the plaintiff has a valid admiralty claim against the defendant. Ronda Ship
Memt. Inc. v. Doha Asian Games Organizing Comm., 511 F. Supp. 2d 399, 403-404 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). As such, the
prima facie standard in the maritime attachment context is "a pleading requirement, not an evidentiary standard, and
differs from the use of that phrase in other contexts." Jd. at 404. It is, however, a more stringent standard than that
applied under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in that Supplemental Rule E(2)(a) requires that a complaint
"state the circumstances from which the claim arises with such particularity that the defendant . . . will be able,
without moving for a more definite statement, to commence an investigation and frame a responsive pleading." Fed.
R. Civ. P., Supp. R. E. (2)(a); Ronda, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 404. Plaintiffs have not met the prima facie standard here.

Case 1:07-cv-09876-DLCG Document6 - Filed 12/07/2007 Page9Qof 23

Plaintiffs cannot satisfy that burden. Plaintiffs' claims, as discussed further infra, do not
constitute maritime torts and, consequently, do not support the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction
by this Court even if all of the allegations in the Complaint are accepted as true. Moreover, the
justification for the sizable amount that Plaintiffs have sought to attach, $17,149,420, is wholly
unclear and thus, at minimum, the attachment amount requires adjustment. Defendants
respectfully submit that vacatur should be granted and this case dismissed.

Wl. ARGUMENT

A. Standard of Review

On a motion to dismiss, the Court must ordinarily accept as true all of the well-pleaded
facts in a complaint, and consider those facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. See, e.g.,
Smith v. Mitlof, 198 F. Supp. 2d 492, 497-498 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citations omitted). However,
"fcjJonclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not
suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss." Jd. at 498 (internal quotation and citations omitted).
Allegations that are so conclusory that they fail to give notice of even the basic events and
circumstances of which the plaintiff complains are insufficient as a matter of law. Id.

Moreover, when the question to be considered is one involving the jurisdiction of a
federal court, "jurisdiction must be shown affirmatively, and that showing is not made by
drawing from the pleadings inferences favorable to the party asserting it." /d. (citing Shipping
Fin. Serv. Corp. v. Drakos, 140 F.3d 129, 131 (2d. Cir. 1998)). Thus, in evaluating whether
admiralty jurisdiction applies, "[n]o presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiffs allegations,
and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for
itself the merits of jurisdictional claims." Ramirez v. Butler, 319 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1037 (N.D.

Cal. 2004) (internal quotation and citation omitted).

B. Plaintiffs Bear the Burden of Proof Under
Supplemental Admiralty Rules B and E

Maritime attachment is designed to allow parties in admiralty cases to secure jurisdiction
over an absent party and to obtain security for a potential judgment where the absent party's
assets are transitory. See, e.g., AquaStoli Shipping Ltd. v. Gardner Smith Pty, Ltd., 460 F.3d 434,
435, 437 (2d. Cir. 2006). Maritime attachment, however, requires a showing that the claims at
issue in the case fall within the purview of admiralty jurisdiction, and thus the Court must
evaluate the validity of Plaintiffs' claims under admiralty law in determining whether maritime
attachment is appropriate. See, e.g., OGI Oceangate Transporation Co. Ltd. v. RP Logistics Pvt.
Lid., No. 06 Civ. 9441 (RWS), 2007 WL 2900225, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. October 4, 2007), McGuire
v. City of New York, 192 F. Supp. 866, 870 (S.D.N.Y. 1961) ("Not every tort committed on
admiralty waters may be redressed in the admiralty courts."). Admiralty Rule E(4)(f), moreover,
provides that whenever "property is arrested or attached, any person claiming an interest in it
shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the
arrest or attachment should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with these rules."
Fed. R. Civ. P., Supp. R. E(4)(f).

As explained by the Second Circuit in AquaStoli, the Admiralty Rules "clearly place[] the
burden on the plaintiff to show that an attachment was properly ordered and complied with the
requirements of Rules B and E." 460 F.3d at 445 n.5; see also T & O Shipping Ltd. v. Source
Link Co., No. 06-CV-7724 (KMK), 2006 WL 3513638, at * 2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2006); JK.
International, Party, Ltd. v. Agriko S.A.S., No. 06-CV-13259 (KMK), 2007 WL 485435 at *2
(S.D.N.Y. February 13, 2007). In order to maintain the process of maritime attachment and
garnishment under Rule B, Plaintiffs must demonstrate: (a) that they have a valid prima facie

admiralty claim against each of the Defendants whose property they seek to attach; (b) that the
