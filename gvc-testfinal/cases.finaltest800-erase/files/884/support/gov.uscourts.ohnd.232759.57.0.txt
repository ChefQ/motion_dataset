1 INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Andrew Carr brings the instant lawsuit alleging a variety of claims under 42
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1983 ("0x00A7 1983"). Carr's 0x00A7 1983 claims primarily arise from a Search Warrant obtained
by Defendant Cleveland Police Detective Alfred Johnson ("Det. Johnson") to search the premises
located at 19409 Milan Drive, Maple Heights, Ohio ("the Premises") for "criminal gang
materials". The Search Warrant and Affidavit for Search Warrant provided that Michael
Menefield resided at the Premises and was involved in criminal gang activity. (See April 12,
2016 Search Warrant and Affidavit attached as Exhibit A). Carr alleges that the search warrant
drafted by Det. Johnson lacked probable cause to justify the search of the Premises. (Compl.
ECF#1 at 954).

Defendants Officer Steven Davis (hereinafter "Ofc. Davis") and Sergeant Keith Kulak
(hereinafter "Sgt. Kulak") are police officers employed by the Solon Police Department in the
City of Solon, Ohio. (Affid. of Kulak at 4 1 attached as Exhibit B; and Affidavit of Davis at 0x00A7 1
attached as Exhibit C). Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak are members of the Southeast Area Law
Enforcement Network's (hereinafter, "SEALE") Special Weapons and Tactics (hereinafter
"SWAT") unit. Ud. at | 5 and yen 5).

The SEALE SWAT assisted the Cleveland Police Department ("CPD") in executing the
Search Warrant. (Ud. at 7 10 and 0x00A7 9). The SEALE SWAT unit's sole involvement in the
execution of the Search Warrant is limited to securing the property and persons present at the
location. (Ud. at J 19 and 0x00A7 18). Once the property and location are secured by the members of
the SWAT unit, the investigating police entity involved completes its search pursuant to the
terms of the warrant. (Ud. at J 20 and 0x00A7 19). The SWAT unit members had no involvement in

CPD search of the Premises, nor would SWAT unit members investigate or arrest for any crime
that might occur at the location of the execution of the search warrant. (/d. at J 21-22 and 4]
20-21). Any crime that may occur at the location of the execution of the warrant is under the
jurisdiction of the municipal police force in that location. In the instant matter, the Maple Height
Police Department ("MHPD") would have jurisdiction and responsibility to investigate and
charge any crime committed at said location.

Sgt. Kulak and Ofc. Davis's actions relevant to the instant lawsuit involve only securing
the property at the Premises in their roles at SEALE SWAT unit members. The entirety of Sgt.
Kulak and Ofc. Davis's interactions with Mr. Carr consisted solely of Mr. Carr firing a gun in
their direction. Once the property was secured, the SEALE SWAT unit turned the search over to
the Cleveland Police Department and any criminal investigation on the Premises over to the
Maple Heights Police Department.

Il. STATEMENT OF THE CASE

A. SEALE SWAT

SEALE exists pursuant to an Agreement for Establishment of Regional Council of
Governments, authorized under Chapter 167 of the Ohio Revised Code, by and between the City
of Bedford, the City of Maple Heights, the City of Bedford Heights, the Village of Oakwood, the
City of Garfield Heights, the Village of Walton Hills, and the City of Solon. The purpose of
SEALE is for the mutual interchange of police personnel and police equipment as well as jointly
acquired and owned police equipment. SEALE consists of several specialized police service
units, one of which is SEALE SWAT.

The purpose and intent of SEALE SWAT is to serve as a specialized, flexible unit,
activated to assist member departments in the containment, de-escalation and ultimate control of

all situations beyond the capabilities of a traditional on-duty police officer. SEALE SWAT
routinely serves warrants within the jurisdictions of its member municipalities. (Affid. of Kulak
at | 8 attached as Exhibit B; and Affidavit of Davis at 7 attached as Exhibit C). Ofc. Davis and
Sgt. Kulak were present at 19409 Milan Drive, Maple Heights, Ohio on April 15, 2016, in their
respective capacities as members of the SEALE SWAT team. (/d. at 10 and 4 9).

Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak were two (2) of eleven (11) members of the SEALE SWAT
present at 19409 Milan Drive, Maple Heights, Ohio to assist the CPD in the execution of a
Search Warrant. (d. at 0x00A7 13 and 0x00A7 12). The SWAT team's role in executing this, or any, search
warrant is solely to secure the property and persons present at the location in order to turn the
investigation over to the investigating law enforcement entity or entitities. (fd. at 19 and 0x00A7 18).
The activities of Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak consisted only of securing the property and persons
at the location so that the CPD could conduct its search pursuant to the terms of the Search
Warrant. (/d.).

B. Search Warrant

The Search Warrant at issue in this case was obtained by the CPD. Defendant Detective
Alfred Johnson is a member of the CPD gang unit and was investigating a street gang called the
Heartless Felons. The subject search warrant was obtained by the CPD with the assistance of the
Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's office. (See email correspondence dated April 11, 2016 and
April 11, 2016 between Det. Johnson and the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office attached as
Exhibit D). Judge Michael Astrab of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas found
probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant, as evidenced by the search warrant
being signed by the Judge on April 12, 2018. (See Search Warrant, Exhibit A).

On April 14, 2016, SEALE SWAT was contacted, "paged out", to assist with a high risk

search warrant by the CPD Gang Impact Unit. (Affid. of Kulak at yen 9 attached as Exhibit B; and
Affidavit of Davis at { 8 attached as Exhibit C). On April 15, 2016, at approximately 7:00 a.m.,
the SEALE SWAT team assisted the CPD in the execution of a CPD search warrant. (Id. at J 13
and yen 13). Ofc. Davis, Sgt. Kulak and Defendant Officer Ron Dodge (of the Garfield Height
Police Department) were the first three (3) members of the SWAT team to enter the home. (Jd.
at {17 and 16). The officers knocked (on the front door) and announced that they were police
officer executing on a warrant. (/d. at cent 14 and 7 13). Upon no one from the home answering
the door, the front door was breached. (/d. at cent 15 and yen 14). Upon the door being breached,
Ofc. Davis deployed a Noise and Flash Diversionary Device (NFDD) into the threshold of the
home. (d. at 0x00A7 16 and 4 15). Ofc. Davis, Sgt. Kulak and Officer Dodge entered into the home
following the NFDD. (/d. at yen 17 and 4 16). Following the deployment of the NFDD, Carr fired
a single gunshot, aiming toward the front door, from which the officers just entered. (See
Andrew Carr Deposition at pp. 44-45, pertinent pages attached as Exhibit E). After the Carr
gunshot, the SEALE SWAT team completed securing the property. Upon the property and
persons present at the property being secured, SEALE SWAT turned the investigation over to the
CPD. (Affid. of Kulak at {20 attached as Exhibit B; and Affidavit of Davis at 7 19 attached as
Exhibit C).

C. Arrest and Prosecution

Carr was arrested by the Maple Heights Police Department. (See Andrew Carr
Deposition at pp. 45, 54 pertinent pages attached as Exhibit E). The MHPD charged Carr with
three counts of felonious assault upon a peace officer. On or about May 9, 2016, Mr. Carr was
indicted on the three counts of felonious assault by the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury. (See
Indictment attached as Exhibit F). Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak did not arrest Carr. (Affid. of

Kulak at { 23 attached as Exhibit B; and Affidavit of Davis at { 22 attached as Exhibit C). Ofe.
Davis and Sgt. Kulak did not testify before the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury. (/d. at J 24 and
23). Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak were never subpoenaed to testify in Carr's criminal case. (Id. at
| 25 and { 24). Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak were never consulted by the Cuyahoga County
Prosecutor's Office during the pendency of Carr's criminal case, nor notified about the criminal
case being dismissed without prejudice. (Ud. at 0x00A7 26 and 4 25). Ofc. Davis and Sgt. Kulak's only

involvement in Carr's criminal case was being identified as victims in the Indictment.

D. Complaint

Plaintiff's Complaint attempts to assert the following causes of action against Ofc. Davis
and Sgt. Kulak:

e Count One: 0x00A7 1983 claim premised on a search warrant obtained by CPD Detective
Johnson that is alleged to lack probable cause to justify a search of the premises
described in the search warrant (Compl. ECF#1 at 7968-74)

e Count Two: The Court dismissed Count Two as to former Defendants Cleveland
Police Department, Solon Police Department, and Garfield Heights Police
Department (ECF#39, 40 and 41)

e Count Three: Civil Conspiracy claim premised on defendants alleged conspiracy to
violate Plaintiff's civil rights (Compl. ECF#1 at 480-87)

e Count Four: False imprisonment claim premised on Plaintiff's arrest and subsequent
confinement allegedly without probable cause (Compl. ECF#1 at 4988-95)

e Count Five: Malicious prosecution claim for allegedly charging Plaintiff with
criminal offense of felonious assault on a police officer (Compl. ECF#1 at 496-103)

e Count Six: 0x00A7 1983 claim premised on Plaintiff's right to be free from unreasonable
search and seizures premised on a search warrant obtained by Cleveland Police
Detective Johnson that is alleged to lack probable cause to justify a search of the
premises described in the search warrant (Compl. ECF#1 at 49104-112)

As will be fully established below, all of Plaintiff's claims against the Solon Defendants must be
dismissed as a matter of law.
I. LAW AND ARGUMENT

To prevail on claims brought pursuant to 0x00A7 1983, a plaintiff bears the burden of

establishing that a person acting under the color of law deprived the plaintiff of a right secured
