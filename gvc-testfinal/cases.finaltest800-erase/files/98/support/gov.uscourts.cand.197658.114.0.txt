I.

INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Defendants Gap Inc. (“GAP”) and Vangent,

2
3

Inc. (“Vangent”) (collectively “Defendants”) submit the following objections to the expert

4

opinions of James Van Dyke (“Van Dyke”) and Dr. Larry Ponemon (“Ponemon”) submitted by

5

Plaintiff in support of his Opposition to Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment (Docket

6

#104). (Declaration of Rosemary M. Rivas in Opp. to Defs.’ Motions for Summary Judgment

7

(“Rivas Decl.”), Exs. M and N.) As set forth in greater detail below, the Court should disregard

8

the expert reports of both Van Dyke and Ponemon in their entirety because neither is admissible

9

as a matter of law. They are unreliable, irrelevant, and provide no assistance to the Court in

10

understanding the evidence or in determining any fact in issue in this case as required by Federal

11

Rule of Evidence 702.

ARGUMENT
A.

Plaintiff’s Expert Reports Should Be Excluded in Their Entirety Because
Even Under Plaintiff’s Own Incorrect Standard, They Fail to Demonstrate
That the Putative Class Has Suffered Compensable Injury.

Plaintiff proffers the testimony of Van Dyke and Ponemon for one reason: to support his

16

erroneous contention that an increased risk of suffering identity theft – a future injury –

17

constitutes a compensable legal injury. (See Plaintiff’s MPA in Opp. to Defs.’ Motions for

18

Summary Judgment (“Opp.”), 1:18-2:12, 6:11-7:3, 9:16-18; 11:1-12:9.) To support this

19

contention, Plaintiff analogizes to medical monitoring cases, and cites Potter v. Firestone Tire &

20

Rubber Co., 6 Cal. 4th 965 (1993) for the proposition that even where a present injury is lacking,

21

plaintiffs may recover the costs of future monitoring (i.e., credit monitoring in this case). (Opp.,

22

10:13-28.) This analogy is inapt. (See GAP’s Reply Brief to its Motion for Summary Judgment

23

(“Reply Brief”) [Docket #131] at 8:17-10:13.)

24

As explained in GAP’s Reply Brief, Potter is inapplicable to this case because it does not

25

involve identity theft or the misuse of personal information, it does not address the relevant issue

26

here of whether potential future harm satisfies the injury element of a tort, and it has been

27

expressly limited to (i) fear of cancer cases, (ii) arising from toxic torts, (iii) not in the context of

28

negligence, but in the context of the tort of emotional distress. (Id. at 9:3-7.) However, even if

C 07-5739 SC
sf- 2652113

1

Case3:07-cv-05739-SC Document114 Filed03/06/09 Page3 of 10

1

those obstacles were overcome and Potter was held to apply to this “fear of identity theft” case,

2

Plaintiff’s expert reports fall well short of meeting Potter’s standard to demonstrate compensable

3

injury. Thus, they should be held inadmissible because they are irrelevant and will not assist the

4

Court in understanding the evidence or in determining any fact in issue. Fed. R. Evid. 702.

5

Under Potter, in order to recover damages for a claim of future injury, a plaintiff must

6

establish through “reliable medical or scientific opinion, that it is more likely than not that the

7

plaintiff will develop cancer in the future due to the toxic exposure.” 6 Cal. 4th at 997 (emphasis

8

added). Plaintiff has not met or even purported to meet this standard. Plaintiff’s expert reports,

9

even when most charitably viewed, fail to show that it is more likely than not that a member of

10

the putative class will suffer identity theft as a result of the laptop theft incident.

11

Van Dyke’s report, at best, establishes only that people who receive notice of a data

12

breach are more likely to become victims of identity theft. (Rivas Decl., Ex. M, ¶ 4.) This

13

opinion is irrelevant because identity theft has not occurred here. There have been zero

14

confirmed instances of identity theft attributed to the stolen laptop. Even if Van Dyke’s statistics

15

were born out in reality, they still fail to show that it is “more likely than not” that a member of

16

the putative class will suffer identity theft due to the laptop theft incident. Further, Ponemon’s

17

report does not even attempt to quantify the increased risk of identity theft faced by the putative

18

class, and thus also fails to meet Potter’s standard for cognizable injury. (See id., Ex. N.)

19

Therefore, even if Plaintiff’s own erroneous standard is applied, his expert reports are

20

inadmissible because they are irrelevant and would not assist the Court in any way. Fed. R. Evid.

21

702. They should be stricken in their entirety.

22

B.

23

Even if the Court Finds that Plaintiff’s Expert Reports Demonstrate a
Sufficient Increased Likelihood of Harm, They Still Must be Excluded
Because They Do Not Constitute “Reliable . . . Scientific Opinion.”

24

Defendants further object to the admissibility of Plaintiff’s expert reports because neither

25

report constitutes a “reliable . . . scientific opinion.” See Potter, 6 Cal. 4th at 997; see also Fed.

26

R. Evid. 702. Both reports rely heavily on speculation, fail to consider or ignore substantial

27

evidence in this case, and fail to address the facts present here. Under Federal Rule of Evidence

28

702, these errors render Plaintiff’s expert reports inadmissible.

2
3

Van Dyke’s Opinion Must be Excluded Because the Application of His
Analysis to the Facts of this Case Renders his Statistical Analysis
Meaningless and His Opinion Irrelevant.

At the heart of Van Dyke’s expert report is the statistical conclusion that, based on his

4

company’s 2008 Identity Fraud Survey, people who receive notification of a data breach will be

5

four-times more likely to suffer identity theft within a 12-month period than people who are not

6

notified of a data breach. (Rivas Decl., Ex. M, ¶ 4.) This statistic is then used by Van Dyke (and

7

by Plaintiff) to conclude that members of the putative class have been placed at a “significantly

8

higher risk” of becoming victims of identity theft due to the laptop theft incident. (Id., ¶ 1.) An

9

application of Van Dyke’s analysis to the actual facts of this case, however, renders his statistical

10

analysis wholly irrelevant and meaningless to the issues to be decided by the Court. Thus, his

11

opinion should be disregarded under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.

12

Defendants object to Van Dyke’s analysis because it does not address the facts of this

13

case, and should therefore be excluded in its entirety. His opinion is based on an annual survey

14

that involved a test population of 4,800 individuals. (Rivas Decl., Ex. M, ¶ 2.) As mentioned

15

above, that survey determined that, within 12 months of being notified of a data breach incident,

16

19% of those surveyed reported that they were victims of identity fraud. (Id., ¶ 4.) As to the

17

general population, 4.32% reported that they became victims of identity fraud over the same time

18

period. (Id.)

19

With all due respect to Mr. Van Dyke, irrespective of whether 19% of Americans who

20

receive a notification letter suffer identity theft over the subsequent 12 months, we know that did

21

not happen here. To date, there have been no confirmed instances of identity theft attributed to

22

the stolen laptop. Therefore, Van Dyke’s report is irrelevant to the issues faced by the Court, and

23

provides no assistance to the Court as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Thus, his

24

opinion should be disregarded in its entirety.

25
26
27
28

2.

Van Dyke’s Theory of Increased Risk of Identity Theft Should be
Stricken for the Additional Reason that It Fails to Consider the Actual
Facts of this Case.

Defendants further object to the admissibility of Van Dyke’s expert report because his
hypothesis does not fit the facts of this case. Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides, in relevant
GAP INC. AND VANGENT, INC.’S MOT. TO STRIKE/OBJECTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S EXPERT REPORTS
C 07-5739 SC
sf- 2652113

3

Case3:07-cv-05739-SC Document114 Filed03/06/09 Page5 of 10

1

part, that in order for expert testimony to be admissible, it must apply the “principles and methods

2

[of the expert’s hypothesis] reliably to facts of the case.” Van Dyke’s expert report fails to do

3

this. His theory describes a person’s “Day One” risk, that is, the risk of someone receiving a data

4

breach notification letter today and having an identity theft in the next 12 months. (Rivas Decl.,

5

Ex. M, ¶ 4.) As set forth above, Van Dyke’s report quantifies this risk as four-times greater for

6

people notified of a data breach than those who are not. (Id.)1 But those are not the facts of this

7

case.

8
9

This case does not present a “Day One” risk. The laptop was stolen from Vangent’s office
in Chicago in September 2007. By the time the Court hears the parties’ pending motions, it will

10

have been 18 months since the laptop theft incident without a single instance of identity theft

11

attributed to the stolen laptop. Had Van Dyke reliably applied his principles and methods to the

12

actual facts of this case, he should have addressed the question: “What are someone’s chances of

13

a data theft from a stolen laptop if, as here, there were no incidents of identity theft during the

14

first 18 months following the theft?” Because Van Dyke’s opinion did not apply his hypothesis

15

to the actual facts of this case, his conclusion that putative class members are faced with a

16

“significantly higher risk” of suffering identity theft due to the laptop theft incident should be

17

excluded.

18

Indeed, Van Dyke’s own report states that only 10% of all identity theft victims had their

19

data used after 12 months of being notified of a data breach incident. (Rivas Decl., Ex. M, ¶ 12.)

20

In other words, there is a dramatic drop in risk after the first 12 months. Here, with this breach

21

having occurred 18 months ago, the drop in risk must be even greater. Thus, the risk that Van

22

Dyke describes as “substantial” is no such thing at all. Therefore, the Court should exclude Van

23

Dyke’s report in its entirety under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.

24
25
26
27

1

Van Dyke’s 19% figure appears to be tremendously inflated. It appears to include all
notification events, including hacking events (e.g. TJ Maxx) in which the thief had the specific
intent to steal personal identifying information, as opposed to a property crime, as in this case,
that happened to include incidental personal identifying information. He does not adjust for that
discrepancy.

2

Van Dyke’s Report Must be Excluded Because It Provides No Basis
for the Court to Conclude That Van Dyke’s Opinion is Based on
Sufficient Facts or Data or Is the Product of Reliable Principles and
Methods.

3
Even if the report reliably applied Van Dyke’s principles and methods to the facts of the

4
5

case (which it does not), it would still be inadmissible because nothing in the report provides a

6

basis for the Court to conclude that Van Dyke’s opinion “is based upon sufficient facts or data” or

7

“is the product of reliable principles and methods,” as is required under Federal Rule of Evidence

8

702.

9

Van Dyke’s analysis is purportedly based on his company’s annual Identity Fraud Survey,

10

(Rivas Decl., Ex. M, ¶ 2), about which his report provides almost no information. Van Dyke does

11

not state whether the survey or its methodology has been subject to peer-review. He reports that

12

the survey was administered to “4,784 U.S. adults over age 18 and a sample that is representative

13

of the U.S. demographic distribution, based on age, gender, income and ethnicity,” (id. ¶ 4), but

14

does not explain what steps were taken to achieve a representative sampling in each category.

15

Nor does he address how, if at all, the voluntary telephone survey identified or corrected for self-

16

selection bias (for example, if there were a disproportionately high response rate among identity

17

fraud victims because they had more personal interest in the survey topic than other potential

18

respondents).

19

He claims that the survey was “of comparable design methodology to the 2003 Federal

20

Trade Commission Identity Theft Survey Report,” (id. ¶ 2), but does not describe the FTC

21

Survey’s methodology. He states that “487 victims were interviewed via a standardized 50-

22

question telephone survey” (id. ¶ 3), but does not explain the criteria by which an initial

23

respondent was assigned to the “victim” set. Nor does he provide the text of these 50 questions,

24

or describe them in any fashion other than to say that they were “identical to or highly similar to

25

the 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 surveys.” (Id. ¶ 3.) He does not provide any questions from

26

these prior surveys.

27

Van Dyke reports that “of Americans notified of a data breach in the last 12 months, 19%

28

reported becoming victims of identity fraud in the last 12 months [i]n contrast [to] only 4.32% of

sf- 2652113

5

Case3:07-cv-05739-SC Document114 Filed03/06/09 Page7 of 10

1

all Americans.” (Id. ¶ 4.) But he does not explain how, if at all, the survey identified or corrected

2

for confirmation bias—i.e., considered whether individuals who had received prior notification of

3

a data breach were more likely to label an ambiguous event as identity fraud.

4

Van Dyke claims that “[t]he facts of the GAP data breach” put Plaintiff and the Class at

5

particular risk for “new account identity theft,” as compared to other forms of identity fraud. (Id.

6

¶¶ 2, 5.) But he nowhere indicates what questions respondents were asked about the manner in

7

which their data was breached, or how such responses were correlated with the form of identity

8

fraud that the respondent later suffered.

9

Van Dyke reports no qualifications or experience in criminology, police work, or burglary

10

investigation, yet he opines that “the laptop . . . appears to have been selectively stolen from a

11

particular location on a particular floor of defendant Vangent’s office building after repeated

12

attempts to enter the facility.” (Id. ¶ 5.)

13

And Van Dyke is inconsistent in providing confidence intervals for the many percentages

14

he reports. (Compare id. ¶¶ 4, 11 (confidence intervals reported) with id. ¶¶ 6, 12 (no confidence

15

intervals reported.))

16

In short, nothing in Van Dyke’s report permits the Court to admit his opinion while

17

exercising the Court’s “gate-keeping function,” which requires more than simply taking the

18

expert’s word for it. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th

19

Cir.1995). Van Dyke’s description of his survey is too imprecise for the Court to determine

20

whether his opinion is “connected to existing data” by any more than “the ipse dixit of the

21

expert.” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997).

Specific Portions of Both of Plaintiff’s Experts’ Reports Should Also Be
Excluded Under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Additionally, if the Court is inclined not to exclude Plaintiff’s expert reports in their

25

entirety based on the objections set forth above, Defendants submit the following more specific

26

objections to the contents of the two reports.2

27
28

2

Attached hereto as Appendix A is a complete list of all of Defendants’ specific
objections to Plaintiff’s expert reports.

sf- 2652113

Case3:07-cv-05739-SC Document114 Filed03/06/09 Page8 of 10

1

First, Defendants object to both experts’ opinions that putative class members are subject

2

to an increased risk of identity theft because the facts of this case indicate that the laptop theft

3

incident was a data theft crime rather than a property theft crime. (Rivas Decl., Ex. M, ¶ 5; Ex.

4

N, ¶¶ 2, 9.) Van Dyke’s statement that “[t]he facts of the GAP data breach make identity fraud

5

more likely” is inadmissible because it lacks foundation, is based on speculation, and is ultimately

6

irrelevant to the issues before the Court. Nowhere in Van Dyke’s report is a foundation properly

7

laid for this opinion: he is not a criminologist, and therefore, his opinion about the type of crime

8

that occurred at Vangent’s facility in September 2007 amounts to inadmissible speculation.

9

Ponemon’s conclusion that the laptop theft was a data theft crime is objectionable on identical

10

grounds. Further, both opinions demonstrate that Plaintiff’s experts selectively chose what data

11

to review regarding the facts of the laptop theft. In concluding that this was a data theft crime,

12

both Van Dyke and Ponemon conveniently ignored (or were not shown) the contrary conclusions

13

of the FBI, the Chicago Police Department, Dr. Aviel Rubin, and GAP, through its motion for

14

summary judgment (Docket #100), that this was a property theft crime. (Id., Ex. M, ¶ 2; Ex. N,

15

¶ 1.) Thus, these opinions should be excluded.

16

Second, Defendants object to Ponemon’s opinion that a thief would recognize that there

17

was sensitive personal information contained on the stolen laptop even if the laptops were not

18

targeted for their data. (Rivas Decl., Ex. N, ¶ 5.) Just like his opinion that this was a data theft

19

crime, Ponemon’s opinion is inadmissible because it lacks foundation, is based on speculation,

20

and is ultimately irrelevant to the issues before the Court. Therefore, the conclusion that “it is

21

likely that the Gap employment applicant data contained on the stolen laptop will still be used for

22

nefarious purposes” is based on nothing more than Mr. Ponemon’s speculation. (Id.) It should

23

therefore be excluded.

24

Lastly, Defendants object to Van Dyke’s conclusions that putative class members should

25

be provided with extensive mitigation solutions to prevent and detect identity fraud and misuse,

26

and that more than one year of credit monitoring is needed for breaches like the one in this case.

27

(Id., Ex. M, ¶¶ 6, 12.) Both of these opinions go to the ultimate legal issue in this case, and are

therefore improper subjects for expert testimony. See, e.g., McHugh v. United Service Auto

2

Ass’n, 164 F.3d 451, 454 (9th Cir. 1999). Thus, these opinions should be excluded.
