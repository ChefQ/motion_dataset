Plaintiff,

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

v.
TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE,
INC., et al.,
Defendants.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), Plaintiff Catherine Alexander respectfully moves the
Court for leave to file an amended complaint as a matter of course. In support of this motion,
Plaintiff states the following:
1.

On April 17, 2018, Plaintiff Catherine Alexander filed a Complaint against the

Defendants.
2.

On July 9, 2018 Defendants Yuke's Co., Ltd. (“Yuke’s”), Yuke's LA Inc.

(“Yuke’s LA”) and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (“WWE”) filed motions to dismiss for
lack of personal jurisdiction. Motions to dismiss are pending. (Docs. 49, 51).
3.

Per the Court’s August 7, 2018 Scheduling Order (Doc. 54), Plaintiff was to serve

discovery requests regarding personal jurisdiction by July 18, 2018.
4.

Plaintiff served interrogatories and requests for admission seeking information

from Defendants Yuke’s, Yuke’s LA, and WWE regarding their motions to dismiss regarding
personal jurisdiction on July 18, 2018.
5.

On August 17, 2018, Plaintiff received discovery responses from Defendants

Yuke’s Co., Yuke’s LA, and WWE.

6.

Plaintiff now seeks to amend her Complaint to add additional jurisdictional facts

which came from Defendants’ discovery responses.
7.

Per the Court’s August 7, 2018 Scheduling and Discovery Order, any motions to

amend pleadings are to be filed before October 10, 2018.
8.

Leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P.

15(a)(2).
9.

Leave to amend should be granted absent undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive

on part of movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue
prejudice to opposing party by virtue of allowance of amendment, or futility of amendment.
Ferguson v. Roberts, 11 F.3d 696, 706 (7th Cir. 1993) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182
(1962)).
10.

Plaintiff has exhibited no undue delay or bad faith, as she has moved to amend her

complaint shortly after she received the Defendants’ discovery responses.
11.

Defendants will not suffer any material prejudice as a result of Plaintiff’s

Amended Complaint.
12.

Moreover, Plaintiff would be prejudiced if she were not allowed to amend her

complaint after learning additional jurisdictional facts through the Defendants’ discovery
responses.
13.

A copy of Plaintiff’s proposed Amended Complaint has been submitted pursuant

to Local Rule 15.1 and CM/ECF User’s Manual Section 2.10.
Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to File Amended Complaint.
