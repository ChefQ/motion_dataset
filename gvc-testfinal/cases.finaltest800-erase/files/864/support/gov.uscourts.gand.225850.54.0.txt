Former Counsel) timely move the Court for an order reconsidering, vacating, and
setting aside its April 24, 2017 Order granting the motion of Epps, Holloway,
DeLoach & Hoipkemier’, LLC, (EHDH) 3 to determine the allocation of attorney’s
fee award to former counsel on the following grounds:
1.

The Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the controversies

between Former Counsel and EHDH.
(a)

The claims asserted in EHDH motion against FBG and Werner do not
arise under any statute or law of the United States and present no federal
question invoking the Court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. § 1331.

(b)

FBG and Werner and EHDH are all citizens of the State of Georgia and
there exists no diversity of citizenship to support jurisdiction of the
claims asserted in EHDH’s motion against FBG and Werner under 28
U.S.C. § 1332.

EHDH is a Georgia limited liability company organized under Georgia law with its
registered office and registered agent, Jeffrey DeLoach, located at 1220 Langford Drive, 200A,

(c)

There is no other federal statute conferring jurisdiction on this Court
over the claims asserted in EHDH’s motion against FBG and Werner.

(d)

28 U.S.C. § 1367 does not confer supplemental jurisdiction on the
Court over the claims asserted by EHDH against FBG and Werner
because the above action was dismissed with prejudice on February 6,
2017 (CM/EDF # 47), the Court did not reserve jurisdiction over the
claims asserted in EHDH’s motion against FBG and Werner (or the
unfiled claims of FBG and Werner against EHDH), and the case was
closed before EHDH’s motion was filed on March 28, 2017. (CM/EDF
minute entry February 6, 2017). The Claims asserted in EHDH’s
motion (and the unfiled claims of FBG and Werner against EHDH) are
not “so related to claims of [the Class in this] action within [the Court’s]
original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy
under Article III of the United States Constitution.” 28 U.S.C. §
1367(a).

(e)

The Court has no ancillary jurisdiction over the controversies between
FBG, Werner, and EHDH under Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of
Am., 511 U.S. 375, 379, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 1676 (1994) because:
(1)

the claims asserted in EHDH’s motion against FBG and Werner
(and the unfiled claims of FBG and Werner against EHDH) are

3

Case 2:16-cv-00066-RWS Document 54 Filed 05/22/17 Page 4 of 10

not in any way or to any degree factually interdependent with the
claims asserted by the Class, which have been fully settled by a
settlement that has been performed and paid by the Defendant
SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. (SunTrust); and
(2)

adjudicating the claims asserted by in EHDH’s motion against
FBG and Werner (and the unfiled claims of FBG and Werner
against EHDH) is not in any way or to any degree necessary to
enable [the] court to function successfully, to manage its
proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.

(f)

EHDH and Adam Hoipkemier’ have misrepresented the provisions of
the “co-counsel agreement”4 by claiming “Paragraph 4 of the cocounsel agreement provides that “[c]ounsel’s work for the Class will be
compensated, if at all, with the approval and at the direction of the Court
. . .” Paragraph 4 of the Amended and Restated Co-Counsel Agreement
really says,
Counsel’s work for the Class will be compensated, if at all, with
the approval and at the direction of the Court and Counsel’s work
for the Clients on their individual claims will be compensated as
set forth in the Retention Agreements. (Emphasis added).

Actually the “co-counsel agreement” is entitled “Amended and Restated Co-Counsel Agreement”
and dated October 4, 2016. The parties to the agreement are Bondurant, Mixon, & Elmore, LLP
(BME), EHDH, FBG, and Werner. A copy of the “co-counsel agreement” is attached as Exhibit
1 to the Declaration of William S. Stone served along with this motion.
4

4

Case 2:16-cv-00066-RWS Document 54 Filed 05/22/17 Page 5 of 10

This is a material misrepresentation to the Court because EHDH’s and
Hoipkemier’ statement falsely makes it appear to the Court that FBG
and Werner agreed with Bondurant, Mixon, & Elmore, LLP (BME) and
EHDH in the “co-counsel agreement” that apportionment of attorney’s
fees awarded to all “[c]ounsel,” including FBG and Werner, would be
“at the direction of the Court.” Hoipkemier’ and EHDH failed to attach
a copy of the Amended and Restated Co-Counsel Agreement to
EHDH’s motion or to Hoipkemier’ Declaration. (CM/EDF # 49,
Exhibit # 2). They thereby concealed from the Court the true meaning
of the sentence in paragraph 4 of the Amended and Restated CoCounsel Agreement they only partially quote.
“Counsel” is a defined term in the Amended and Restated CoCounsel Agreement that expressly excludes Werner and FBG.
Paragraph 1 of the Amended and Restated Co-Counsel Agreement
provides:
Throughout this Agreement, “Counsel” refers to BME
EHDH, and “Former Counsel” refers to Werner and FB.”

and

It is readily apparent that there is not now, and never has been, any
agreement by “Former Counsel” (FBG and Werner) that the portion of
fees paid to EHDH and its members, as well as all other damages, due
FBG and Werner under Georgia contract and tort law, would be paid
5

Case 2:16-cv-00066-RWS Document 54 Filed 05/22/17 Page 6 of 10

“at the direction of this Court,” particularly since these parties cannot,
as a matter of law, confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent on this
Court to adjudicate such claims.
In the preliminary or final motions to approve the settlement in
this case (CM/ECF ## 35, 37, and 42) and in the motion for attorney’s
fees and reimbursement of expenses (CM/ECF # 41), EHDH and its
members never disclosed the existence of FBG’s and Werner’s state
law contract or tort claims against them for damages, including a
portion of the net income derived from fees received by them in
connection with this class action, caused by their fraudulent withdrawal
from FBG or Werner in breach of their fiduciary duties to their former
law firms.
Despite being notified by the Court to file a notice of withdrawal
or substitution of counsel (Docket Min. Entries 06/30/2016 and
07/05/2016), neither Kevin Epps, Jeffrey DeLoach, nor EHDH filed a
motion to substitute EHDH and its members as counsel for the Plaintiff
Felix or the Class. EHDH, Epps, DeLoach, and Hoipkemier’ only filed
a Notice of Change of Address. (CM/ECF # 29). The Court did appoint
Epps, DeLoach, Hoipkemier’’ and EHDH as Class Counsel along with
BME on September 9, 2016. (CM/ECF # 36, ¶ 10). The Court also

6

Case 2:16-cv-00066-RWS Document 54 Filed 05/22/17 Page 7 of 10

granted Werner’s motion to withdraw as plaintiff’s counsel. (CM/ECF
# 32). At no point did the Court reserve jurisdiction over FBG’s and
Werner’s Georgia contract and tort law claims, including their damage
claims for all or part of the net profits EHDH received by way of fees
in connection with this action, as well as claims for all other damages
due them from EHDH and its members.
2.

The Court lacks personal jurisdiction over FBG and Werner and EHDH

to adjudicate the controversies between them. EHDH is not a party to this action,
and has not filed a motion to intervene as a party and assert claims against FBG and
Werner, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) (supplemental jurisdiction includes
claims and involve joinder or intervention of additional parties) and Fed.R.Civ.Pr.
24(c) (a motion to intervene must be served, including a pleading setting forth the
intervenors’ claims). No order making EHDH a party and allowing its intervention
has been entered by the Court.
Similarly, FBG and Werner are not parties to this action. No order joining
FBG and Werner as parties and order issuance and service of any summons, order,
rule nisi, or other legal process on them has been issued by the Court. No summons,
order, rule nisi, or other legal process has been issued by this Court and served on
FBG or Werner subjecting them to the personal jurisdiction of this Court for
purposes of adjudicating any controversy between them and EHDH. In fact, FBG

7

Case 2:16-cv-00066-RWS Document 54 Filed 05/22/17 Page 8 of 10

and Werner were not even served with the Court’s April 24, 2017 Order granting the
motion of EHDH to determine the allocation of attorney’s fee award to EHDH, FBG,
and Werner.
3.

The Court lacks in rem jurisdiction over the property that is the subject

of the claims asserted by EHDH or FBG and Werner. No lien has been filed in this
action by EHDH, FBG, or Werner or anyone else charging the portion of fees
awarded to EHDH (and BFG, and/or Werner per the Amended and Restated CoCounsel Agreement) in the final settlement agreement and decree. The funds have
never been in the actual or constructive possession of this Court, because those funds
were paid by SunTrust directly to BME in performance of the terms of the settlement
agreement and final decree, and not into the registry of this Court. BME is presently
holding the gross funds due to EHDH, BFG, and/or Werner in its trust account.
BME is not a party to this action. BME was obligated under the Amended and
Restated Co-Counsel Agreement, ¶ 4(b), to pay the gross funds due to EHDH, BFG,
and/or Werner to the escrow agent selected by these parties. The parties selected
First American Bank & Trust of Athens, Georgia to be the escrow agent. However,
EHDH breached the Amended and Restated Co-Counsel Agreement by filing its
motion in this Court before the funds could be deposited with the selected escrow
agent.
