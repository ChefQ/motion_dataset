APPROVAL OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WITH DEFENDANTS NIPPON SEIKI

Pg ID 1050

The Yazaki and DENSO Defendants (collectively, the “Non-Settling Defendants”)
submit the following statement in response to the Motion for Preliminary Approval of Proposed
Settlement with Defendants Nippon Seiki Co., Ltd., N.S. International, Ltd., and New Sabina
Industries, Inc. [collectively, “Nippon Seiki”], and for Authorization to Disseminate Notice to
the Direct Purchaser Settlement Class (No. 12-cv-00201, ECF No. 83) (“Motion”) filed by Direct
Purchaser Plaintiff (“Plaintiff”) on April 9, 2014, in the above-captioned action. As part of the
settlement process, Plaintiff asks the Court, among other things, to (1) certify a “Settlement Class”
that is consistent with the purported class on whose behalf Plaintiff has brought claims against all
of the Defendants, and to (2) require all defendants, settling and Non-Settling, to provide certain
information about potential members of the Settlement Class within 21 days after entry of an
order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement, if any. Non-Settling Defendants address
these two aspects of Plaintiff’s proposed settlement below.
A.

Any Order Preliminarily Or Finally Approving The Proposed Settlement Should
Include The Language Set Forth In Paragraphs 8 And 20 of Plaintiffs’ Proposed
Orders Preliminarily And Finally Approving The Settlement, Respectively.
The Non-Settling Defendants expect to contest a motion for class certification once that

motion becomes ripe for consideration on a fully formed record. The Non-Settling Defendants
expect to demonstrate that legal and factual issues differ across the range of the various
purported class members, that those individual issues predominate over common issues, and that
such individual issues will render trial on a class basis unmanageable, such that the class will not
meet the certification requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Plaintiff’s Motion, and more importantly, its Proposed Orders, recognize that the question
of class certification of a litigation class will be hotly contested. To avoid a premature dispute

and allow its purported settlement class to proceed, Plaintiff has included the following language
in its Proposed Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Proposed Settlement:
The Court’s provisional certification of the Settlement Class as provided herein is without
prejudice to, or waiver of, the rights of any Defendants to contest certification of any
other class proposed in these coordinated actions. The Court’s findings in this Order shall
have no effect on the Court’s ruling on any motion to certify any class in these actions or
on the Court’s rulings concerning any Defendant’s motion; and no party may cite or refer
to the Court’s approval of the Settlement Class as persuasive or binding authority with
respect to any motion to certify any such class or any Defendant’s motion.
(Proposed Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Proposed Settlement with Nippon Seiki
Defendants and Authorizing Dissemination of Notice to Direct Purchaser Settlement Class at
¶ 20, No. 12-cv-00201, ECF No. 83-3.) Plaintiff has included almost identical language in its
Proposed Order and Final Judgment:
The Court’s certification of the Settlement Class as provided herein is without prejudice
to, or waiver of the rights of any Defendants to contest certification of any other class
proposed in these coordinated actions. The Court’s findings in this Order shall have no
effect on the Court’s ruling on any motion to certify any class in these actions or on the
Court’s rulings concerning any Defendant’s motion; and no party may cite or refer to the
Court’s approval of the Settlement Class as persuasive or binding authority with respect
to any motion to certify any such class or any Defendant’s motion.
(Proposed Order and Final Judgment at ¶ 8, No. 12-cv-00201, ECF No. 83-4.) The Non-Settling
Defendants specifically endorse these provisions and request that they be included in any
resulting Orders if the Court should decide to preliminarily or finally approve the proposed
settlement.
If the Court were to decide not to include such language, Non-Settling Defendants hereby
move for the additional and necessary time needed to take discovery and develop the factual
record necessary to present a fully briefed motion on class certification to the Court.

Pg ID 1052

The Non-Settling Defendants Should Be Given 90 Days To Provide The Requested
Name And Address Information.
As part of its proposed settlement with Nippon Seiki, Plaintiff proposes a schedule for

final approval of its settlement that includes the following: “Within twenty-one (21) days of the
date of entry of the Preliminary Approval Order, all defendants shall provide the names and
addresses, and electronic mail addresses, of the potential members of the Settlement Class to
Plaintiff’s Counsel, to the extent they are identifiable through reasonable efforts.” (Motion at 5,
and Ex. 2 to Motion at ¶ 10.) The settling parties included this provision without making any
effort to confer with the Non-Settling Defendants affected by the proposed provision. While
Non-Settling Defendants acknowledge the settling parties’ need for the data, Non-Settling
Defendants request that they be given 90 days from the date of entry of a Preliminary Approval
Order, if any, to produce the requested information.1 In addition, Non-Settling Defendants’
obligation to produce the requested names, addresses, and electronic mail addresses of the
potential members of the Settlement Class should be limited to information maintained in central
data sources, i.e., centralized, structured databases against which queries can be run and from
which large data extracts can be made with reasonable effort and expense.

1

Non-Settling Defendants’ request extends Plaintiff’s proposed deadline to produce the
requested names, addresses, and electronic mail addresses by 69 days. Because nearly all of the
subsequent tasks outlined in Plaintiff’s proposed schedule for final approval of its settlement
cannot be completed until Plaintiff receives this information (see Motion at 5-6, and Ex. 2 to
Motion at ¶¶ 11-18), each subsequent deadline should also be increased 69 days.
