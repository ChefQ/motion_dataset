IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO
Civil Action No. 1:15-cv-00299-REB-CBS
UNITED STATES SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
KRISTINE L. JOHNSON,
TROY A. BARNES, and
WORK WITH TROY BARNES, INC. (d/b/a THE ACHIEVE COMMUNITY),

______________________________________________________________________________
OPPOSITION OF DEFENDANT KRISTINE L. JOHNSON
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO PERMIT TELEPHONE TESTIMONY
______________________________________________________________________________
Defendant Kristine L. Johnson, through her attorneys, Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP,
submits this opposition to the Plaintiff’s Motion to Permit Telephone Testimony.
I.

BACKGROUND
This is an enforcement action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission

against two individuals, Kristine L. Johnson and Troy A. Barnes, and two entities, Work with
Troy Barnes, Inc., and Achieve International, LLC.1

1

Achieve International, LLC is named only as a relief defendant.

3568808.1

Case 1:15-cv-00299-REB Document 23 Filed 02/23/15 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 5

On ex parte motion, on February 12, 2015, the Court entered a temporary restraining
order and asset freeze and other relief against all defendants. In its order granting the temporary
restraining order, the Court scheduled a hearing for February 24, 2015 at 9:00 a.m. for the
Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction and other preliminary relief should not
be entered, Doc. No. 10, page 13.
Both Ms. Johnson and Mr. Barnes have stipulated to an order for preliminary injunction,
asset freeze, and other equitable relief, and it is not anticipated that any of the proceedings at the
hearing on the order to show cause on February 24 will relate to Ms. Johnson.
Neither entity defendant has appeared. Therefore, it is anticipated that the Plaintiff will
pursue preliminary injunctive relief, and seek to extend the temporary restraining order, with
respect to the two entity defendants.
The Plaintiff has filed a Motion for Leave to Adduce Testimony Telephonically if such
testimony is needed. Neither the identification of the possible witnesses who may be called
telephonically, nor the subject matter of their testimony has been identified.
Ms. Johnson now opposes the Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Take Telephonic
Testimony.
II.

MS. JOHNSON OBJECTS TO TELEPHONIC TESTIMONY ONLY TO THE
EXTENT THAT SUCH TESTIMONY MIGHT BE ADMISSIBLE IN SUPPORT
OF CLAIMS AGAINST HER.
Plaintiff’s counsel’s certification under LCivR 7.1A does not fully describe Ms.

Johnson’s position.
As reflected by a series of electronic mail communications on February 23, 2015,
appended hereto as Exhibit A, Ms. Johnson has no objection to the Court allowing telephone

-2-

Case 1:15-cv-00299-REB Document 23 Filed 02/23/15 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 5

testimony in support of any relief sought against the two entity defendants (or Mr. Barnes), so
long as that testimony would not be offered against Ms. Johnson. The Plaintiff refused that
limitation on the use of any telephonic testimony taken at the February 24, 2015 hearing.
Ms. Johnson’s position remains unchanged. So long as any testimony taken by telephone
at the February 24, 2015 hearing is not offered against Ms. Johnson, she has no objection to
allowing such testimony. Ms. Johnson does not suggest that whatever witnesses may be called
to testify telephonically tomorrow would be precluded from offering evidence against
Ms. Johnson; evidence from such witnesses would simply have to be put in admissible form,
either through a deposition or live testimony.
III.

THE PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO SHOW SUFFICIENT CAUSE TO ALLOW
TELEPHONIC TESTIMONY AS REQUESTED.
F.R.C.P. 43(a) allows testimony to be received in open court by contemporaneous

transmission from a different location.

However, testimony in open court through

contemporaneous transmission is disfavored and should be allowed only in compelling
circumstances with appropriate safeguards.
A court’s decision to allow testimony in open court from a different location is
committed to the Court’s discretion. Eller v. Transunion, LLC, 739 F.3d 467, 477 (10th Cir.
2013). However, the proponent of the telephonic testimony must demonstrate good cause. Eller,
739 F. 3d at 477-38; Predator International, Inc. v. Gamo Outdoor USA, Inc., 2014 WL 358866,
at *4 (D. Colo. Jan. 31, 2014).
The Plaintiff has failed to show good cause for allowing telephonic testimony in this
case. It has not demonstrated compelling circumstances or appropriate safeguards as required by
Rule 43(a). Neither the witnesses which the Plaintiff may call nor the subject matter of their

-3-

Case 1:15-cv-00299-REB Document 23 Filed 02/23/15 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 5

testimony have been identified. The Plaintiff has not stated when the possible need for these
witnesses became known to it. The only cause offered by Plaintiff in support of its motion is that
these unidentified potential witnesses would be inconvenienced if they were required to travel to
Colorado for the hearing. Doc. No. 19, p. 2 of 5. However, the inconvenience to a witness does
not establish good cause within the meaning of Rule 43(a). Predator International, Inc., at *4;
Rule 43.
Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of establishing good cause to allow testimony in
open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location pursuant to F.R.C.P.
43(a), and, therefore, its Motion to Permit Telephonic Testimony should be denied.
Dated this 23rd day of February, 2015.
Respectfully submitted,
s/ David A. Zisser
