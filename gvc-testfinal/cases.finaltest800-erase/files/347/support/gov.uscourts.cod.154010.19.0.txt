IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO
Civil Action No. 15-cv-00299-REB-CBS
UNITED STATES SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
KRISTINE L. JOHNSON,
TROY A. BARNES, and
WORK WITH TROY BARNES, INC. (d/b/a THE ACHIEVE COMMUNITY),
Defendants,
and
ACHIEVE INTERNATIONAL, LLC,
Relief Defendant.

MOTION TO PERMIT TELEPHONIC TESTIMONY

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 43(a), Plaintiff United Stated
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) hereby moves the Court for an order
permitting certain witnesses to testify by telephone at the upcoming show cause
hearing, should their testimony be necessary. In support of its motion, the SEC states
as follows:
1.

On February 12, 2015, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order

and asset freeze and set this matter for a show cause hearing on Tuesday, February

Case 1:15-cv-00299-REB Document 19 Filed 02/23/15 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 5

24, 2015 at 9:00 a.m., for defendants to show cause why the Court should not enter a
preliminary injunction order and extend the temporary relief granted until final
adjudication on the merits.
2.

As detailed in the SEC’s Brief in Further Support of its Motion for

Preliminary Injunction, filed earlier today, Defendant Johnson and Defendant Barnes
have stipulated to the entry of a preliminary injunction against them, and Defendant
Work With Troy Barnes, Inc. (“WWTB”) and Achieve International, LLC (“Achieve
International”) have not appeared or otherwise responded. The SEC anticipates the
entities will not appear at the show cause hearing.
3.

If WWTB and Achieve International do not appear at the show cause

hearing, the SEC does not intend to present any evidence, but rather intends to ask the
Court to extend the temporary relief previously granted in light of the entities failure to
appear and show cause.
4.

In the unlikely event that either (1) the entities appear at the show cause

hearing, or (2) the Court wishes to hear evidence in support of the SEC’s motion for
preliminary injunction, the SEC has two witnesses who are not local to Colorado, but
rather reside in Washington, D.C. and North Carolina, respectively. Given the remote
chance that their testimony will be necessary, as well as their location, it would be a
significant inconvenience to require their travel to Colorado for the hearing.
5.

For these reasons, the SEC respectfully requests that, in the unlikely

event testimony from these out-of-town witnesses should be necessary at the hearing,
their testimony be permitted to be presented telephonically.
