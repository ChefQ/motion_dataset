UNITED STATES’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
REPLY BRIEF IN EXCESS OF TWENTY PAGES
The United States moves for leave to file its reply brief to the plaintiffs’ Response to
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket Entry # 117) in excess of the 20-page
limitation found in Ct. Fed. Cl. R. 5.3. The United States request leave to file a reply brief of 30
pages.
Plaintiffs’ response to the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment raises numerous
arguments that must be addressed by the United States. In particular, the plaintiffs question the
constitutionality and validity of Treas. Reg. § 1.701-2. Approximately 8 pages of this reply brief
is devoted to the United States’ response to this challenge. The plaintiffs also asserted a reasonable
cause defense to the application of penalties. This defense was raised for the first time in plaintiffs’
response and 6 pages of the United States’ reply were needed to fully address this issue. Responding
to just these two newly raised issues required nearly 2/3 of the United States’ allowed page
limitation. Accordingly, only few pages remain to properly address plaintiffs’ remaining arguments
regarding § 752 and the CRUT issues. An extension of the page limitation will allow the United
States to properly address the arguments briefed by the plaintiffs in their Response to the United
States’ Motion and will provide helpful information to this Court in analyzing the legal issues
presented in the motion, responses and replies.

Plaintiffs have informed the United States that they oppose this request for extension of page
limits. The United States notes that on September 5, 2007, the plaintiffs requested leave (Docket #
60) to file a reply brief in excess of twenty pages to the United States’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Cross
Motion for Summary Judgment. As usual, the United States was unopposed to this request. The
basis for plaintiffs’ request then is similar to the basis for the United States’ request now. There, the
plaintiffs wished to address the validity and applicability of Treas. Reg. § 1.752-6. Here, the United
States needs to address the constitutionality and validity of Treas. Reg. § 1.701-2, which the
plaintiffs have asserted is invalid. Plaintiffs are not prejudiced by the page limit extension and their
opposition to the request is meritless and petty.
The United States requests that the Court grant the United States’ Motion for Leave to File
Reply Brief in Excess of Twenty Pages and allow the United States to file a brief not exceeding 30
pages.
