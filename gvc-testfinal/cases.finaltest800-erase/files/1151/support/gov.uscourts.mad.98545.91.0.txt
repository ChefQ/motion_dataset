Inc., UnumProvident Corporation, the St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc., and
Zurich American Insurance Company (collectively "the Defendants") in light of
certain more recent developments and in the interests of judicial economy and
efficiency, hereby request, pursuant to LR. 40.3(A), that this Court defer the
hearing currently scheduled for December 13, 2005 for a period of approximately
forty-five (45) days following the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation’s
(“JPML”) next currently scheduled hearing date.1 As to these grounds therefore,
Defendants state as follows:
Final Transfer of This Action Will Shortly Be Fully Briefed; A
Decision by the JPML Should Be Forthcoming Early Next Year
1.

On October 4, 2005, following the completion of briefing on the motions

set for the scheduled December 13, 2005 hearing, a Conditional Transfer Order was
entered by the JPML formally transferring this matter to MDL-1663 (the “MDL
Action”). See Notice of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation’s Issuance of a
Conditional Transfer Order (filed Oct. 6, 2005). Both the Plaintiff and the Liberty
Defendants2 moved to vacate that Order. Defendants filed their opposition to those
Motions last week and Plaintiffs and the Liberty Defendants are due to file reply
briefs this week. Accordingly, as of this week, the parties will have fully briefed to
the JPML the issue of whether final transfer to the MDL Action is appropriate. See
Notice of Filing Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate October 4, 2005
Conditional Transfer Order (hereinafter “Notice of Opp. to P.’s Mot.”), and Notice of
Filing Opposition to Liberty Mutual’s Motion to Vacate Conditional Transfer Order

1 The JPML Clerk's office has informed Counsel that the JPML is next scheduled for a
hearing in January. The exact date has not yet been set.
2 The Liberty Defendants include Liberty Mutual Group Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance
Company, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, Employers Insurance Company of
Wausau, and St. James Insurance Company Ltd.

Defendants understand that it is the pattern and

practice of the JPML to rule on final transfer issues within thirty (30) to forty-five
(45) days of a scheduled hearing date. The next scheduled JPML hearing date is in
January. See supra n.1. Given that the final transfer issue will be fully briefed this
week and presented to the JPML for hearing in January, Defendants submit that it
would be prudent to briefly defer the hearing rather than burden the Court and the
parties with the currently scheduled December 13, 2005 hearing.3
Issues That Are the Subject of the Pending Motions Are, or Will
Shortly Be, Before the MDL Court
2.

The prudence of a brief deferral is amplified by the fact that, as set

forth in Defendants’ Oppositions to both Plaintiffs and Liberty Mutual’s Motions to
Vacate, which are incorporated herein by reference, the MDL Action has or will
have pending before it the very same issues that this Court would be compelled to
consider should it go forward with the hearing on the Motion to Remand or the
Liberty Defendants’ motions to dismiss. These developments are the result of the
transfer to the MDL Action of cases that raise the same issues that would be before
the Court on December 13, 2005. As noted in Defendants’ Oppositions, the Florida
Palm Tree Action,4 filed by the same counsel who represent the plaintiff in this
matter, raises some of the same CAFA questions presented by the Motion to
Remand. In addition, as noted in those Oppositions, other cases transferred to the
MDL Action raise similar issues related to fraudulent joinder and diversity
jurisdiction. See Notice of Opp. to P.’s Mot., Ex. A, pp. 13 to 17. Further, per the
3 Defendants undertook efforts to expedite the matter so that the issue of final transfer
could be fully briefed and presented to the JPML at its last hearing on November 18, 2005.
Expedited briefing, however, required plaintiff’s consent, which was not forthcoming.
4 The complaint and certain Oppositions to Remand in Palm Tree have been previously
attached for this Court’s reference as Exhibits A, E, and F to the Motion to Stay This Action
Pending a Determination on Transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.

MDL Court’s Order, the Liberty Mutual defendants will be filing Motions to
Dismiss in the MDL Action on or before November 29, 2005. In sum, as the result
of recent transfer orders that have issued, or will shortly issue, from the JPML, and
the Scheduling Order in MDL-1663, the CAFA and fraudulent joinder issues that
are the subject of the Motion to Remand, and the issues raised by the Liberty
Defendants’ motions to dismiss will all need to be addressed by Judge Hochberg in
the MDL Action. On this further ground, Defendants submit that it is both prudent
and efficient to await the transfer decision so as to avoid duplication of effort and
the prospect of inconsistent rulings on these issues.
3.

The December 13, 2005 hearing in this Court is scheduled on the

Motion to Stay, various Liberty Defendant Motions to Dismiss, the Motion to
Remand, and the Motion to Substitute Party / Representative Plaintiff and For
Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint. See Order Setting Hearing of Oct. 26,
2005. It is now clear that the MDL Court will hear these same issues. If the JPML
finalizes its order transferring this Action to the MDL Action, this Court will not
need to attend to the burdensome and potentially complex issues raised by those
motions. Defendants note that other similarly situated courts have deferred action
on motions to dismiss or remand given the pendency of a transfer decision. See
Notice of Opp. to P.’s Mot. Ex. N-P (Stay Orders in Slay, Cameron Offshore Boats
Slay, and Emerson). To best serve the goals of judicial economy and efficiency and
to avoid the prospect of inconsistent decisions, Defendants respectfully submit that
this Court should defer a hearing on the pending motions until forty-five (45) days
following the JPML’s next scheduled hearing.
