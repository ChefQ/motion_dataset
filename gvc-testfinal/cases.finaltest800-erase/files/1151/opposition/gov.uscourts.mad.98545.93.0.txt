Defendants Liberty Mutual Group, Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,
Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, Employers Insurance Company of
Wausau and St. James Insurance Company, Ltd.1 (collectively, the "Liberty
Defendants") submit this Opposition to the Motion to Re-Schedule Hearing filed by
other defendants in this action.
BACKGROUND
The Court has requested oral argument on December 13, 2005 (a date that is
the result of one previous postponement) on, among other matters, the Liberty
Defendants' motions to dismiss, the plaintiffs motion to remand and other
defendants' motion to stay. Following briefing of all these motions in this Court, the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) issued a conditional transfer
order stating that this matter would be transferred and consolidated with MDL
1663 absent any opposition. The plaintiff and the Liberty Defendants have filed
motions to vacate the conditional transfer order. As a result, pending the JPML's
determination, this Court retains jurisdiction over the matter.
ARGUMENT
The Motion to Re-Schedule Hearing is merely a restatement of the motion to
stay this action pending the JPML's transfer determination filed previously by the
other defendants in this action. The motion to stay has been briefed extensively by

1

St. James Insurance Company, Ltd. ("St. James") has appeared in this case specially to argue that
it has not been served properly and that the Court may not exercise jurisdiction over it. Because the
Court has not yet ruled on St. James' motion to dismiss, St. James' appearance in the form of its
Opposition to the Motion to Re-Schedule Hearing should also be considered a special appearance as
it is compelled to respond to the motion but does not wish to subject itself to the jurisdiction of this
Court.

the parties, as have the Liberty Defendants' motions to dismiss, the Plaintiffs
motion for remand and the Plaintiffs motion to substitute parties. The Court's
request for a hearing on the motion to stay and the other motions will allow the
parties to respond to the Court's concerns. The Motion to Re-Schedule Hearing,
however, seeks to deny the Court the opportunity to weigh the arguments asserted
by all parties in support of and against the motion to stay - a motion that remains
within the power of this court to decide. Granting the relief sought in the Motion to
Re-Schedule Hearing would effectively allow the motion to stay without the proper
consideration of the arguments against it. Therefore, the Court should deny the
Motion to Re-Schedule Hearing and address directly the merits of the motion to
stay this proceeding.
Further, it would be unjust and inefficient to delay the determination of the
Liberty Defendants' motions to dismiss any longer, which would be the effect of
allowing the Motion to Re-Schedule Hearing. As articulated in their motions to
dismiss, the Liberty Defendants contend that they do not belong in this lawsuit.
Additionally, the Liberty Defendants were not among the defendants who removed
this case from Essex Superior Court to federal court. In their removal papers, the
other defendants argued that the Liberty Defendants had been joined fraudulently
to defeat federal diversity jurisdiction. Thus, the Liberty Defendants are not the
only parties asserting that their involvement in this action is without basis. As a
result, further delay of a decision on the Liberty Defendants' motions to dismiss,

first served in Massachusetts Superior court over five months ago, would be unjust
and inefficient.
Accordingly, the Liberty Defendants request that the Motion to Re-Schedule
Hearing be denied.
