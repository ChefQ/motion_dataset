INTRODUCTION
As demonstrated in the Motion to Dismiss filed herewith, plaintiff’s Amended

Complaint (the “Complaint”) should be dismissed in its entirety as a matter of law. Out
of an abundance of caution, this Motion seeks to strike individual allegations, set forth in
paragraphs 1 and 68 of the Complaint, because those allegations (1) conflict with the
Complaint’s definition of the alleged class set forth in paragraph 51, and (2) appear to
expand the class definition to include purchasers who cannot demonstrate standing or
entitlement to assert a claim under Sections 11 or 12 of the '33 Act.
It is well-settled that allegations that would result an untenable or legally defective
class may be stricken prior to discovery and class certification. See, e.g., Riley v.
Compucom Sys., Inc., 2000 WL 343189, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2000) (using motion
to strike to test class allegations); Kamm v. Cal. City Dev. Co., 509 F.2d 205, 212 (9th
Cir. 1975) (affirming order striking class allegations from complaint).
Paragraph 51 of the Complaint alleges that the action is brought on behalf of “all
persons who purchased Chesapeake common stock in the Offering,” and uses that
allegation as the definition of the “Class.” As demonstrated below, that is the only
appropriate class definition given the pleadings and applicable law.
Importantly, the Offering at issue was a secondary offering of twenty-five million
shares of common stock pursuant to a registration statement that became effective on July
9, 2008. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 31, 32. At the time of the Offering, Chesapeake already had more
than 500,000,000 shares of common stock -- issued in numerous prior offerings pursuant
to earlier registration statements -- trading in large volumes on a daily basis.
Paragraphs 1 and 68 of the Complaint nevertheless appear to attempt to expand the
class alleged by the Complaint beyond “persons who purchased in the Offering,” to
include investors who bought stock after the Offering -- on the open market in which
hundred of millions of shares of common stock issued in prior offerings pursuant to other
registration statements trade continuously. Paragraph 1 alleges that the claims in the

Complaint are asserted on behalf of all purchasers who bought common stock issued
"pursuant to" the registration statement for the July 9, 2008 Offering, while paragraph 68
speaks of shares acquired “pursuant and/or traceable to” the registration statement for the
Offering.
Because it is impossible for anyone who did not purchase shares in the Offering to
“trace” their common stock to the registration statement or Offering at issue, no one who
purchased shares in the open market can possibly have a claim. Nor can such purchasers
be imported into the alleged class via the allegations of paragraphs 1 or 68. Accordingly,
Chesapeake respectfully requests the Court strike the allegations in paragraphs 1 and 68
of the Complaint where they purport to expand the class to investors who must “trace”
their shares to the Secondary Offering.

LEGAL STANDARDS
A party may move to strike from a pleading “any insufficient defense or any

redundant, immaterial, or impertinent . . . matter.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). “Federal courts
have used motions to strike to test the viability of a class at the earliest pleading stage of
the litigation.” Stubbs v. McDonald’s Corp., 224 F.R.D. 668, 674 (D. Kan. 2004); Clark
v. McDonald’s Corp., 213 F.R.D. 198, 205 n.3 (D.N.J. 2003); Riley, 2000 WL 343189 at
*1; Lumpkin v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 161 F.R.D. 480, 481 (M.D. Ga. 1995);
Miller v. Motorola, Inc., 796 F.R.D. 516, 518 (N.D. Ill. 1977). “Where the complaint
demonstrates that a class action cannot be maintained on the facts alleged, a defendant
may move to strike class allegations prior to discovery” and class certification. Sanders,
2009 WL 150950, at *9 (citing Thompson v. Merck & Co., 2004 WL 62710, at *5 (E.D.
Pa. Jan. 6, 2004)).1
The Supreme Court has noted that “[s]ometimes the issues are plain enough from
the pleadings to determine whether the interests of the absent parties are fairly

encompassed within the named plaintiff’s claim.” Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest. v.
Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982). In those situations, “[t]he court need not wait for a
motion for class certification[.]” Stubbs, 224 F.R.D. at 674. In addition, Rule 23 itself
confers broad discretion on district courts to make orders requiring “that the pleading be
amended to eliminate allegations about representation of absent persons and that the
action proceed accordingly[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(d)(1)(D).

ARGUMENT
Classes that include individuals who are unable to assert or demonstrate their right

to assert claims are not properly ascertainable and may not be certified as a matter of law.
Sanders, 2009 WL 150950, at *10 (citing Denny v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253,
264 (2d Cir. 2006)); Bishop v. Saab Auto. A.B., 1996 WL 33150020, at *5 (C.D. Cal.
Feb. 16, 1996).2
Any plaintiff bringing a claim under Section 11, including all putative class
members, must show that all stock for which damages are claimed was issued pursuant to
the challenged registration statement. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a); Hertzberg v. Dignity
Partners, Inc., 191 F.3d 1076, 1080 (9th Cir. 1999). Where -- as in this case -- the issuer
has made more than one offering, a plaintiff thus cannot establish standing unless it can
“trace their purchase of [purportedly] tainted securities to the faulty registration
statement.” In re Fleetboston Financial Corp. Sec. Litig., 253 F.R.D. 315, 348 (D.N.J.
2008) (citing Krim v. PCOrder.com, 402 F. 3d 489, 492 n. 8 (5th Cir. 2005). See also
Hertzberg, 191 F. 3d at 1079-82 (9th Cir. 1999) (noting that “if there is a mixture of preregistration stocks and stock sold under the misleading registration statement,” the

See also Clay v. Am. Tobacco Co., 188 F.R.D. 483, 490 (S.D. Ill. 1999) (“The definition
of a class should not be so broad so as to include individuals who are without standing to
maintain the action on their own behalf.”); Am. Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Super. Ct., 37 Cal.
App. 4th 1291, 1294-95 (1995) (“For a class to be considered ascertainable, its members
must have a plausible cause of action against the defendant. If multiple plaintiffs fail to
meet this elementary standard, no ascertainable class exists, and a class action may not be
maintained.”) (citations omitted).

plaintiff must show he purchased in the offering or can otherwise trace his laterpurchased stock back to that offering).
Here, the face of the Complaint acknowledges that this was not the Company’s
first public offering of common stock. See (¶ 1). In fact, at the time of the Offering,
there were already 584,715,364 Chesapeake shares in the market. Request for Judicial
Notice in Support of Motion to Dismiss (“RJN”) Ex. A at S-4. Thus, to obtain standing
to sue, plaintiffs must be able to “trace their purchase of tainted securities” to the July
2008 Offering. But for those who did not purchase in the Offering -- i.e., those included
in the Class definition set forth in paragraph 51 -- such a task is simply impossible. As
noted above, in sharp contrast to purchases made on the open market after an initial
public offering, there is no possible way in which anyone who purchased outside the July
9, 2008 Offering could possible “trace” the purchase of any shares to that Offering or that
registration statement. Indeed, the vast majority of shares trading after July 9, 2008 were
issued in numerous other offerings pursuant to a series of other registration statements
filed during the fifteen years following Chesapeake’s IPO. There is no basis upon which
anyone who purchased outside the Offering could segregate the mass of common stock
by offering.
Moreover, shares in the open market, including those purchased by broker-dealers
at the time of an offering, are held in so-called “street name,” the modern system of stock
ownership by which individual shares exist anonymously and are transferred
electronically without ever being in the physical possession of the shareholder. See, e.g.,
In re Fleetboston, 253 F.R.D. at 344-346; Silber v. Mabon, 957 F. 2d 697, 700 (9th Cir.
1992) (same). As a result of this system, “beneficial owners” are of shares issued
pursuant multiple offerings are “unable to satisfy the tracing requirement of Section 77k “
because every share is “identically denominated and, thus, wholly fungible” with the rest.
In re Fleetboston, 253 at 345 (citing In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 227 F.R.D. 65,
117-18 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). See also Barnes v. Osofsky, 373 F. 2d 269, 271-272 (2d Cir.

1967).
IV.

CONCLUSION
Accordingly, the Court should strike the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 and

68, and limit the alleged class to only those included in the Class definition set forth in
paragraph 51: “persons who purchased Chesapeake common stock in the Offering.”
