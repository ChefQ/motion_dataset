NOTICE OF MOTION TO STRIKE
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Company defendants Chesapeake Energy
Corporation, Aubrey K. McClendon, Marcus C. Rowland, Michael A. Johnson,
Richard K. Davidson, Frank A. Keating, Breen M. Kerr, Charles T. Maxwell,
Merrill A. Miller, Jr., Donald L. Nickles, and Frederick B. Whittemore
(collectively, “Company defendants”) hereby move to strike certain class action
allegations of the Amended Complaint for Violation of the Federal Securities laws
(“Complaint”).
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(f), 23(c)(1)(A) and
23(d)(1)(D), Company defendants seek an order striking the Complaint’s class
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 and 68 insofar as they purport to expand the
operative class to include shareholders who can only “trace” their shares to the
Chesapeake’s July 8, 2008 secondary offering (“Offering”).
This motion is based on Section 11 of the 1933 Act, pursuant to which
plaintiffs lack standing unless they can show they purchased their shares in the
Offering or can trace their shares thereto. As federal courts have acknowledged, it
is impossible to trace shares to a secondary offering such as the one challenged
here, and thus the proposed class must be limited to only those shareholders who
actually purchased in the Offering.
This motion is based on the Notice of Motion and Motion, the supporting
memorandum of points and authorities, Request for Judicial Notice in Support of
the Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint and all exhibits attached thereto,
all pleading and papers on file in this action, oral argument counsel, if allowed,
and any other matters that may be submitted to or considered by the Court.
