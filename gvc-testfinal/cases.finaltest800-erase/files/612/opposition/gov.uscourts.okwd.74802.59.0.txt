INTRODUCTION
Chesapeake Energy Corporation (“Chesapeake”) and the Individual Defendants

(collectively, “defendants”) filed a motion seeking to strike ¶¶1 and 68 of plaintiff’s
Amended Complaint for Violation of the Federal Securities Laws (the “Complaint”), arguing
that these paragraphs conflict with ¶56 and improperly expand the class definition to include
purchasers who cannot demonstrate standing.1

Chesapeake Energy and Individual

Defendants’ Memo of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Strike Amended
Complaint (“Mot. to Strike”) at 1. Defendants, however, have misread the allegations set
forth in ¶¶1 and 68, and in doing so, make much ado about nothing.
II.

ARGUMENT
The paragraphs that defendants assert are improper make two allegations. First, that

the claims in the Complaint are asserted on behalf of all purchasers who bought common
stock issued “pursuant to” the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the
“Registration Statement”). ¶1.2 Second, that plaintiff acquired shares of common stock
“pursuant and/or traceable to” the Registration Statement. ¶68. Defendants ignore the plain
language of these allegations and mistakenly argue that the Complaint alleges that the class
includes Chesapeake shareholders that cannot trace their shares to the Registration
Statement. Mot. to Strike at 4. This is simply not the case.

1

Defendants mistakenly cite to ¶51 for the definition of the alleged class. Mot. to
Strike at 1. Paragraph 56 is the actual paragraph setting forth the definition of the alleged
class.

Paragraph references (“¶_” or “¶¶__”) are to the Complaint.

It is well settled in the Tenth Circuit that direct and aftermarket purchasers have
standing so long as they can prove the securities they bought were those sold in an offering
covered by the false registration statement. Joseph v. Wiles, 223 F.3d 1155, 1159 (10th Cir.
2000). In order to allege standing, a plaintiff must allege that he or she purchased shares
pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement alleged to be false or misleading. W.
Palm Beach Firefighters’ Pension Fund v. Startek, Inc., No. 05-cv-01265-WDM-MEH, 2008
WL 879023, at *7 (D. Colo. Mar. 28, 2008); In re Qwest Commc’ns Int’l, Inc. Sec. Litig.,
396 F. Supp. 2d 1178, 1202 (D. Colo. 2004). At the pleading stage, courts must “accept as
true plaintiffs’ allegations that they made their stock purchases in or traceable to the . . .
public offerings.” In re Suprema Specialties, Inc. Sec. Litig., 438 F.3d 256, 274 n.7 (3d Cir.
2006); Qwest, 396 F. Supp. 2d at 1202 (accepting plaintiffs’ allegations that they purchased
pursuant to certain registration statements to be true). A complaint need not allege how these
shares are traceable to an offering. In re Global Crossing, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 313 F. Supp. 2d
189, 208 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“[T]he pleading requirement is not elaborate. Plaintiffs have not
been required to explain how their shares can be traced; general allegations that plaintiff
purchased ‘pursuant to’ or traceable to false registration statement have been held sufficient
to state a claim.”) (citation omitted).3 The Complaint properly alleges (as it must) that

In re Fleetboston Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 253 F.R.D. 315 (D.N.J. 2008), which
defendants rely upon, states “‘whether the plaintiff is able to trace its stock is not a question
that can be resolved on this motion [to dismiss].’” Id. at 349 (quoting In re SeeBeyond
Techs. Corp. Sec. Litig., 266 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1171 (C.D. Cal. 2003)).

plaintiff and the rest of the putative class purchased Chesapeake stock pursuant and/or
traceable to the Registration Statement.
Defendants’ entire premise is that the words “pursuant” and “traceable” somehow
inappropriately expand the class to shareholders who did not purchase in the Offering. Mot.
to Strike at 1-2.

Defendants confuse the meanings of “pursuant” and “traceable.”

Paragraphs 1 and 68 simply state that plaintiff and the class are able to trace to the Offering.
This is consistent with ¶56, which states that the class consists of “all persons who purchased
Chesapeake common stock in the Offering.” Paragraphs 1 and 68 do not expand this class.
In fact, the paragraphs allege that plaintiff and the class can trace directly to the Offering
because they purchased Chesapeake stock in the Offering.4 As defendants acknowledge, this
class is appropriate.5 Mot. to Strike at 1. The Complaint alleges nothing more.

4

Tracing shares to the offering in which they were purchased can be accomplished by
direct tracing. Kirkwood v. Taylor, 590 F. Supp. 1375, 1378 (D. Minn. 1984). This method
of tracing may be established by
an indication of interest by the broker on behalf of the customer, the
customer’s receipt of a preliminary prospectus with a legend in red ink (called
a “red herring”), a notation on the purchase order ticket showing purchase in
the offering, purchase at the offering price, lack of commission, language
regarding the prospectus on the customer’s confirmation slip, and special
coding of the transaction by the brokerage firm.
Id.
5

Defendants cite a number of cases to support that a motion to strike is an appropriate
method of testing the viability of a class. Mot. to Strike at 2-3. Aside from the fact that none
of these cases consider the issue of class members’ ability to trace shares to an offering, these
cases are inapplicable here. There is no disagreement between plaintiff and defendants that
the class is limited to all persons who purchased Chesapeake stock in the Offering, so there
is no dispute as to the viability of the class.

Defendants somehow interpret the allegations to mean that the class will include
shareholders that cannot trace to the Offering, i.e., open market purchasers without any
indication of purchasing in the Offering. In the paragraphs challenged by defendants,
however, there is no mention of open market purchasers or any other indication that
purchasers who cannot trace their shares to the Offering would be included in the class.
Defendants’ assertion that these allegations seek to include investors who bought stock in the
open market pursuant to other offerings is misplaced and unwarranted.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, defendants’ Motion to Strike should be denied.
