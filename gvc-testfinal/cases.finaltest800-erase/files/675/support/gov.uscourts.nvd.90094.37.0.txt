Defendant Apple Inc. (“Apple”) respectfully moves this Court, pursuant to 28

2

U.S.C. § 1404(a), for an Order transferring this action to the United States District

3

Court for the Northern District of California. This Motion is based on the following

4

Memorandum of Points and Authorities and the declarations and exhibits filed

5

herewith.

6

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

7
8
9

I.

INTRODUCTION

Every factor considered by the Ninth Circuit in determining proper venue favors
transfer of this case to the Northern District of California. Defendant Apple was

10

founded and is headquartered in the Northern District of California and has no relevant

11

particularized ties to Nevada. Plaintiff Unwired Planet LLC was formed in Nevada

12

literally days before this lawsuit was filed and exists only to serve as a patent holding

13

company and lawsuit plaintiff. And Unwired Planet LLC’s parent company, Unwired

14

Planet, Inc., to whom the Complaint attributes the Asserted Patents, was founded in the

15

Northern District of California and has conducted business in that District since its

16

inception in 1994.

17

Not surprisingly, therefore, the relevant, operative facts – including the

18

conception and commercialization by Unwired Planet of the alleged inventions, the

19

prosecution of the patents in suit, and the development by Apple of the accused

20

products – occurred or are occurring in the Northern District of California. As a result,

21

the vast majority of relevant documents and witnesses – including named inventors of

22

the patents, prosecuting attorneys, and Apple’s engineers who developed the accused

23

products – are also located in the Northern District of California.

24

That the Northern District of California is the focal point for the facts and

25

witnesses is also plainly evidenced by the parties’ discovery efforts in another case that

26

Unwired Planet, Inc. recently pursued against Apple covering similar accused products

27

and technologies. Specifically, in 2011, Unwired Planet, Inc. filed suit against Apple

28

in the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington, DC. In that case, because

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP

1

Case 3:12-cv-00505-RCJ-VPC Document 37

Filed 02/01/13 Page 6 of 26

1

of the convenience of the witnesses and parties, and despite the parties’ being free to

2

choose to appear for depositions any place in the country, every single party witness

3

was deposed – including every single Unwired Planet witness – in the Northern

4

District of California.

5

In contrast, this District “enjoys” no unique relationship with Apple and only the

6

following recent, litigation-inspired contacts with Unwired Planet: (1) six days before

7

it filed this lawsuit, Unwired Planet LLC was organized as a limited liability company

8

in this district and (2) on the same day that the lawsuit was filed, Unwired Planet, Inc.

9

announced plans to move from Northern California to Nevada sometime in the future.

10

But both the Ninth Circuit and the Federal Circuit have rejected such transparent

11

efforts to manufacture ties to a district for the purposes of establishing venue. In fact,

12

the courts have routinely and repeatedly ordered transfer even in cases in which the

13

parties had much stronger and lengthier ties to the original jurisdiction than either

14

Unwired Planet LLC or its predecessors, including Unwired Planet, Inc. (collectively

15

“Unwired Planet”), have to the District of Nevada.

16

Because the relevant factors overwhelmingly favor transfer, Apple respectfully

17

requests that the Court grant this Motion and transfer the case to the Northern District

18

of California.

19

II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

20

Unwired Planet filed this lawsuit against Apple on September 19, 2012, alleging

21

that Apple infringes the following ten patents assigned to Unwired Planet: U.S. Patent

22

Nos. 6,317,594; 6,317,831; 6,321,092; 6,532,446; 6,647,260; 6,813,491; 7,020,685;

23

7,233,790; 7,299,033; and 7,522,927 (collectively, the “Asserted Patents”). Dkt. No.

24

1, Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶¶ 15-24, 27. The patents relate to a variety of technologies,

25

and Unwired Planet has accused numerous Apple products of infringement, including:

26

Apple’s iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, Apple’s iOS operating system, Apple App Store

27

and iTunes for iOS, apps available for Apple’s iOS products, notification and location

28

services provided by Apple to its customers (including through Apple’s Safari

browser), Siri, and the infrastructure used by Apple to support the aforementioned

2

systems or services. Id. ¶ 27. Development of these products and systems occurred or

3

occurs in the Northern District of California. Declaration of Mark Buckley (“Buckley

4

Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-8.
As noted above, Unwired Planet has filed other cases against Apple in the past.

5
6

In August 2011, Unwired Planet’s parent sued Apple in the U.S. International Trade

7

Commission (ITC) in Washington, DC, for the alleged infringement of five patents.

8

Declaration of Brooke Wallace (“Wallace Decl.”) ¶ 3, Ex. 1. At approximately the

9

same time, Unwired Planet also filed a companion suit to the ITC Investigation in the

10

District of Delaware. Id. ¶ 26, Ex. 16. In those cases, Unwired Planet accused many

11

of the same products accused in this case – including Apple’s iPhone, iPad, iPod touch,

12

and Apple’s App Store, iTunes and Safari for iOS. See id. ¶ 5. On the eve of trial,

13

after the administrative law judge issued a claim construction order adopting most of

14

Apple’s proposed constructions, Unwired Planet dismissed the case in its entirety. Id.

15

¶ 4, Ex. 2. While the Delaware case was stayed during the ITC Investigation, the stay

16

was lifted in December 2012.

17

Extensive discovery was taken in the ITC Investigation. Unwired Planet

18

deposed thirteen Apple fact witnesses; all of those depositions took place in the

19

Northern District of California. Id. ¶ 5. Apple also deposed six Unwired Planet

20

witnesses; Unwired Planet produced all of its witnesses in the Northern District of

21

California. Id. ¶ 6. In the course of the ITC Investigation, which, again, accused many

22

of the same products at issue in this case, no party produced any witnesses, documents,

23

or other discovery located in the District of Nevada. Id. ¶ 3.

24

A.

Apple and Its Potential Witnesses Are Based and Located in the Northern

25

District of California

26

Apple was founded and is still based in Cupertino, California, in the Northern

27

District of California. See Buckley Decl. ¶ 2. Apple currently has more than 13,800

28

employees working at its headquarters in Cupertino. Id. ¶ 5. Based on Apple’s

understanding of what is accused in this lawsuit, development of the relevant aspects

2

of the accused products occurred or is occurring in the Northern District of California,

3

not in Nevada. See id. ¶¶ 3-4, 6-8. To the best of Apple’s knowledge (given the early

4

stage of the case and the lack of infringement contentions), the relevant engineers

5

involved in the development, implementation, or operation of the accused products are

6

located in the Northern District of California, not in Nevada. See id. To the best of

7

Apple’s knowledge, the documentation relating to the development, implementation,

8

or operation of the accused products are also located in the Northern District of

9

California, not in Nevada. See id.

10

B.

Unwired Planet Has a History of Contacts with the Northern District of

11

California and Lacks Significant Contacts with the District of Nevada

12

On September 13, 2012, six days before this lawsuit was filed, Unwired Planet,

13

Inc. formed Unwired Planet LLC, the plaintiff in this action, in Nevada. Wallace Decl.

14

¶ 12, Ex. 8. Unwired Planet LLC is nothing more than a patent holding company for

15

the Asserted Patents. See generally id. ¶¶ 15, 27; Exs. 11, 17, at 20. It does no

16

business in Nevada other than prosecuting this lawsuit and another one filed against

17

Google, Inc. Id. ¶ 27, Ex. 17, at 20; Unwired Planet LLC v. Google, Inc., No. 3:12-

18

CV-00504-LRH-VPC (Sept. 19, 2012). Notably, it is Unwired Planet, Inc. who has

19

issued every press release and announcement regarding this litigation. See generally

20

id. ¶ 15, Ex. 11. In addition, in its Complaint, and again last week, on January 24,

21

2013, Unwired Planet LLC submitted a Case Management Report in this case claiming

22

that its “principal place of business” is at 226 California Avenue, Reno, Nevada.

23

Compl. ¶ 4; Dkt. No. 35. But as of the very next day, January 25, 2013, that location –

24

i.e., the alleged location in Nevada of the titular plaintiff in this lawsuit – was nothing

25

but a vacant room, sitting above an unrelated retail gift shop, with no actual office.

26

Declaration of Danielle Durkee (“Durkee Decl.”) ¶ 2. Furthermore, neither Unwired

27

Planet LLC nor Unwired Planet, Inc. is even licensed to do business in Nevada, as

28

neither appears currently to have a Reno business license. Id.¶ 3.

Case 3:12-cv-00505-RCJ-VPC Document 37

Filed 02/01/13 Page 9 of 26

Although it registered Plaintiff Unwired Planet LLC as a Nevada limited

1
2

liability company, Unwired Planet, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, founded in 1994

3

and based for virtually its entire existence in Redwood City, California, in the Northern

4

District of California. See Compl. ¶ 8; Wallace Decl. ¶¶ 7-12,Exs. 3-8. On September

5

19, 2012, the same day that Plaintiff Unwired Planet LLC filed its complaint against

6

Apple in Nevada, Unwired Planet, Inc. announced that it intended to move its

7

headquarters from Redwood City to Reno, Nevada. Id. ¶ 13, Ex. 9. Even after that

8

announcement, however, Unwired Planet, Inc. has still identified its headquarters as

9

being located in Redwood City or Silicon Valley in certain filings with the Securities

10

and Exchange Commission and in various press releases. See id. ¶ 14, Ex. 10, ¶ 25,

11

Ex. 15. In addition, Unwired Planet’s CEO has admitted in public comments that its

12

“move” to Nevada was motivated by this (and other) litigations. See id.¶ 15, Ex. 11.

13

C.

The Majority of Non-Party Witnesses Are Located in Northern California

14

— None Are in Nevada

15

1.

16
17

Most of the Inventors Reside in Northern California — None Reside
in Nevada

As noted above, Unwired Planet has asserted ten patents against Apple in this

18

lawsuit. According to the cover page of each patent, which identifies the original

19

assignee and the location of the named inventors at the time of filing, none of the

20

assignees or named inventors were located in Nevada at the time of filing; most were

21

located in the Northern District of California. Id. ¶ 17. Indeed, the ten patents list

22

eighteen inventors, none of whom were ever employed by Plaintiff Unwired Planet

23

LLC, and none of whom appear to be currently employed at Unwired Planet, Inc. Id. ¶

24

16. Based on publicly available information, it appears that eleven of the eighteen

25

inventors reside or work in the Northern District of California, six inventors reside in

26

Washington, Colorado, and Ireland, and one inventor’s location is unknown. Id. ¶ 17.

27

Based on available information, moreover, it appears that none of the inventors reside

28

in or are even within the subpoena power of the District of Nevada. See id.

5

Northern District of California (Messrs. Kjellberg, Becker, Chen, Schwartz, and

6

Martin, Jr.), with the sixth individual residing in Bend, Oregon (Mr. King). See

Most of the Counsel Who Prosecuted the Patents Are Located in
Northern California — None Are in Nevada

10

With respect to counsel who prosecuted the Asserted Patents before the U.S.

11
12

Patent and Trademark Office, it appears that all of the Asserted Patents, other than the

13

three acquired by Unwired Planet from third parties, were prosecuted, at least in part,

14

by counsel located in the Northern District of California. Lawyers from the San

15

Francisco office of Townsend, Townsend & Crew LLP (now Kilpatrick Townsend &

16

Stockton LLP) prosecuted the ’927, ’092, and ’033 patents. Id. ¶ 19 (Melvin Chan and

17

Alan Minsk). A lawyer from the Sunnyvale office of Blakely, Sokoloff, Taylor and

18

Zaffman LLP prosecuted the ’033 patent. Id. (Jordan Becker). Lawyers from the Los

19

Angeles office of the same firm prosecuted the ’446 and ’260 patents. Id. (Jordan

20

Becker and Dag Johansen). Both of those Los Angeles lawyers now work and live in

21

the Northern District of California. Id. A lawyer from the Palo Alto office of Beyer,

22

Weaver & Thomas LLP (now Beyer Law Group LLP) prosecuted the ’831 patent.

23

Id.(C. Douglass Thomas). Lawyers from the Palo Alto office of Stattler, Johansen &

patent portfolio) to two companies in Redwood City, California, and another company

15

based in India but whose U.S. office is in Santa Clara, California – in the Northern

16

District of California. Compl. ¶ 14; Wallace Decl. ¶¶ 20, 24, Exs. 12-14. On

17

information and belief, at least one former Unwired Planet, Inc. employee who has

18

knowledge of the work that led to or is related to the Asserted Patents is still employed

19

at one of the companies that acquired Unwired Planet’s operating businesses and is

20

therefore located in the Northern District of California. Id., ¶ 28, Ex. 18.

In addition, several other former Unwired Planet employees known to have

David Cordeiro, Unwired Planet’s former associate general counsel and intellectual

24

property counsel, lives and works in Northern California. Id. ¶ 21. Based on

25

information learned in the ITC Investigation, it is likely that Mr. Cordeiro possesses

26

knowledge of patent licenses Unwired Planet entered into during his tenure, which will

ARGUMENT

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a court may transfer a case to a forum where

4
5

the action could have been brought “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses,

6

[and] in the interests of justice.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a); Healy v. Philips, No. 94-56624,

7

1995 WL 643268, at *1 (9th Cir. Nov. 1, 1995). The Ninth Circuit has identified

8

several private and public interest factors to determine whether the requirements of

9

section 1404(a) are satisfied. The private interest factors include “(1) the location

10

where the relevant agreements were negotiated and executed, (2) the state that is most

11

familiar with the governing law, (3) the plaintiff’s choice of forum, (4) the respective

12

parties’ contacts with the forum, (5) the contacts relating to the plaintiff’s cause of

13

action in the chosen forum, (6) the differences in the costs of litigation in the two

14

forums, (7) the availability of compulsory process to compel the attendance of

15

unwilling non-party witnesses, and (8) the ease of access to sources of proof.” Jones v.

16

GNC Franchising, Inc., 211 F.3d 495, 498-99 (9th Cir. 2000). The public interest

17

factors identified by the courts include “the administrative difficulties flowing from

18

court congestion; the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home;

19

the interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law

20

that must govern the action; the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws,

21

or in the application of foreign law; and the unfairness of burdening citizens in an

22

unrelated forum with jury duty.” Id.

23

A.

This Action Could Have Been Brought in the Northern District of

24

California

25

As a threshold matter in deciding section 1404(a) motions, courts consider

26

whether the action could have been brought in the target transferee district. Apple is

27

(and was at the time this lawsuit was filed) resident, headquartered, and subject to

28

personal jurisdiction in the Northern District of California. Unwired Planet cannot

The Parties Have Far Greater Contacts with the Northern District of

As explained above, both Apple and Unwired Planet have strong and long-

7

standing ties with the Northern District of California, and no significant ties with the

8

District of Nevada. Apple was founded and has been headquartered in Cupertino,

9

California, in the Northern District of California, since 1976. Buckley Decl. ¶ 2.

10

The titular plaintiff in this action, Unwired Planet LLC, has no history or

11

business in this district other than its creation in September 2012for this (and another)

12

patent infringement lawsuit. See Unwired Planet LLC v. Google, Inc., No. 3:12-CV-

13

00504-LRH-VPC (Sept. 19, 2012). Indeed, Unwired Planet, Inc.’s recent filing with

14

the Securities and Exchange Commission unambiguously admits that Unwired Planet

15

LLC conducts no business at all other than as a patent holding corporation:

16

22

Except for owning the Patents contributed to it by UP [Unwired Planet,
Inc.], commencing and conducting the Legal Actions set forth on
Schedule 4.2(e)-1 and the incurrence of expenses in connection therewith
or as otherwise described on Schedule 4.2(e)-2 since its formation,
UPLLC [Unwired Planet LLC] has (i) conducted no other business,
operations or activities, (ii) owns no other assets or properties, (iii) has
no material liabilities or obligations of any kind other than pursuant to
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and
(iv) is not a party to or bound by any Contract, other than this Agreement
and those Contracts described on Schedule 4.2(e)-2 and, upon execution
and delivery by UPLLC, the Ancillary Agreements to which UPLLC is a
party.

Wallace Decl., ¶ 27, Ex. 17, at 20 (emphasis supplied). Moreover, even though

24

Unwired Planet LLC has represented to this Court in its Complaint (Compl., ¶ 4), and

25

again just days ago, on January 24, 2013, that its “principal place of business” is at a

26

Courts have repeatedly made clear that creation of an entity in a particular

2

district for purposes of prosecuting litigation in that district is not a basis to resist

3

transfer. For example, in In re Microsoft Corporation, the Federal Circuit ordered

4

transfer where the plaintiff was incorporated in the original district sixteen days before

5

filing suit and for the purpose of litigating the case. 630 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir.

6

2011). Similarly, in In re Zimmer, the Federal Circuit ordered transfer where the

7

plaintiff’s location of its principal place of business in the original venue was plainly

8

designed to manipulate venue. 587 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (finding the

9

plaintiff’s connection to the original district to be a “legal fiction”). Here, Unwired

10

Planet LLC’s organization in Nevada just six days before the filing of the lawsuit for

11

the stated purpose of litigation in this District falls squarely under the types of facts

12

that have been rejected as bases for resisting transfer. See In re Microsoft,630 F.3d at

13

1364-65 (rejecting the plaintiff’s argument that it was entitled to the original venue

14

simply because it was incorporated and had its principal place of business in the

15

original district).

16

While Unwired Planet LLC’s parent, Unwired Planet, Inc. (not a party),

17

admittedly is not a brand-new entity created just for litigation, its history and ties all lie

18

with the Northern District of California, not with the District of Nevada. As noted

19

above, Unwired Planet, Inc. was founded in Northern California in 1994 and has been

20

located in that district for almost twenty years. Wallace Decl. ¶¶ 7-11, Exs. 3-7. Thus,

21

the technologies relating or leading to the Asserted Patents(other than those acquired

22

by Unwired Planet) were developed while Unwired Planet, Inc. was headquartered and

23

had its engineering development located in Northern California. Compare Compl. ¶¶

24

15-24 and Wallace Decl. ¶¶ 7-11, Exs. 3-7. Meanwhile, Unwired Planet LLC had no

25

role in the development of the Asserted Patents. In similar situations, courts have

26

concluded that the parent’s connection with the transferee district outweighed its

27

subsidiary’s connection with the transferor district, even where that subsidiary was

28

incorporated in the transferor district. Shared Memory Graphics LLC v. Apple Inc.,

defendant’s motion to transfer to the Northern District of California, where although

9

Moreover, no weight should be given to Unwired Planet, Inc.’s recent “move” to

10

Nevada. First, Unwired Planet, Inc. is not a party to this lawsuit, so its “move” is not

11

persuasive to the analysis. Second, Unwired Planet, Inc. only announced its “move”

12

the day this litigation was filed. And third, it is not clear at this point whether Unwired

13

Planet, Inc.’s recent “move” to Nevada has real substance. For example, Unwired

14

Planet, Inc. continues to issue press releases out of Redwood City that identify Silicon

15

Valley as its headquarters. Id. ¶ 25, Ex. 15. In addition, it is not clear whether or how

16

many of Unwired Planet, Inc.’s current employees, including its executive leadership

17

team, are actually residents of Nevada. See id. ¶ 23; see also Durkee Decl. ¶ 2. Three

18

of the four individuals on Unwired Planet, Inc.’s “Executive Leadership” webpage

19

appear, based on publicly available information, to be located in the San Francisco Bay

concluded lawsuit at the International Trade Commission involving Unwired Planet

neither Unwired Planet LLC nor Unwired Planet, Inc. is even licensed to do business

by litigation – facts to which Unwired Planet, Inc.’s CEO has admitted in public

In sum, Unwired Planet LLC’s organization in Nevada just six days before it

2

filed this lawsuit and Unwired Planet, Inc.’s “move” to Reno, Nevada, are precisely the

3

types of litigation-driven maneuvers that courts have rejected as reasons to oppose

4

transfer to a more convenient forum. See, e.g., In re Microsoft Corp., 630 F.3d at

5

1364-5; In re Zimmer Holdings, Inc., 609 F.3d at 1381(citing Hertz Corp. v. Friend,

(emphasis supplied)); In re Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir.

10

motion to transfer falls squarely within these prohibited activities.”); Convergence

13

although the plaintiff was incorporated in the transferor district, the court concluded

14

that the transferor district was only “nominally” plaintiff’s home forum as the plaintiff

15

was owned and controlled by a foreign corporation for the purposes of managing the

16

foreign parent’s U.S. sales); see also Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co. v. CFMT, Inc., 142

17

F.3d 1266, 1271 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (finding that the subsidiary patent holding company,

18

over which the parent maintained complete control, could not be used as a vehicle to

19

divert personal jurisdiction from the parent’s home district).

20

In fact, even in situations where the party seeking transfer was incorporated in

21

the original forum long before the motion to transfer was filed, the Federal Circuit has

22

ordered transfer and given minimal weight to the parties’ location of incorporation.

23

For example, in In re Link_A_Media Devices Corporation, 662 F.3d 1221 (Fed. Cir.

24

years before the lawsuit was filed. Id. at 1223-24 (reversing the district court’s denial

and non-party Unwired Planet, Inc.’s recent “move” to Nevada – the extent of which

The Contacts Relating to the Causes of Action Are Located in the
Northern District of California

15

The Ninth Circuit finds transfer appropriate where there is “[n]o significant

16

connection between [the forum] and the facts alleged in the complaint.” See, e.g.,

17

Ventress v. Japan Airlines, 486 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2007). Here, there is no

18

connection – significant or otherwise – between Nevada and any of the facts alleged in

19

the Complaint.

20

As explained above, Plaintiff Unwired Planet LLC has accused Apple of

21

infringing ten patents. Compl. ¶ 27. All of the events, and hence contacts, relating to

22

the development of the alleged inventions claimed in the Asserted Patents occurred

23

outside of this District, and predominately in the Northern District of California. First,

24

as noted above, Unwired Planet, Inc. was located in Northern California (id. ¶¶ 7-11,

25

Exs. 3-7) when all of the applications underlying the Asserted Patents were filed

26

(between 1996 and 2008). Compl. ¶¶ 15-24. (Plaintiff Unwired Planet LLC did not

27

of California. See Wallace Decl. ¶ 17. The patents identify the remaining inventors as

2

being from Washington, Colorado, and Ireland. Id. Taken together, the location of the

3

companies and inventors demonstrate that all of the engineering work or product

4

development that led or relates to the patents occurred outside of this District, and

5

predominately in the Northern District of California. Similarly, and also as explained

6

above, most of the attorneys who prosecuted the patent applications are also located in

7

Northern California. See id. ¶¶ 17, 19. No activity related to the prosecution of the

8

Asserted Patents occurred in Nevada.
Additionally, the relevant events, and hence contacts, related to the accused

9
10

products occurred outside of this District and in the Northern District of California.

11

Specifically, the research, design, and development work related to the relevant aspects

12

of Apple’s accused products occurred or is occurring in Northern California –not in

13

Nevada. Buckley Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6. The engineers and documents related to that work,

14

therefore, are located within the Northern District of California. Id. And although

15

Apple sells the accused products nationwide, there is no indication that Apple

16

specifically targets customers in Nevada over customers in other states, so that

17

“connection” cannot outweigh the lack of connection in every other respect.2See In re

18

TS Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (holding sale of product in

case, Apple’s current retail stores and/or plans to build a data center in Nevada in the future have
no bearing on the patent infringement issues. Id.¶¶ 9-10.

the causes of action than this District.

Ease of Access to Sources of Proof Strongly Favors the Northern
District of California

6
7

Given that the contacts relating to the causes of action in this case are located in

8

Northern California, it is no surprise that the ease-of-access-to-sources-of-proof factor

9

overwhelmingly favors transfer to the Northern District of California.
First, as the Federal Circuit has recognized, in patent infringement cases, “the

10
11

bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer. Consequently,

12

the place where the defendant’s documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that

13

location.” In re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Neil

14

Bros. Ltd. v. World Wide Lines, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 2d 325, 330 (E.D.N.Y. 2006)).

Courts in the Ninth Circuit have held that “[i]n patent infringement actions, the

preferred forum is ‘that which is the center of gravity of the accused activity.’” GPNE

19

n.17 (D.N.J. 1993)). Here, as explained, Apple is headquartered in Northern

20

California, the development of the accused products occurred or is occurring in

21

Northern California, and the relevant documents therefore also are located in Northern

22

California.3 Buckley Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6. Likewise, Apple’s marketing, finance, and sales

23

employees who might be witnesses in this case are located in Northern California. See

The Court should consider the physical location of evidence, even where some of

than it might have absent recent developments does not render this factor
superfluous.”); In re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (same).

id. Indeed, in the ITC Investigation, as noted, all of Apple’s witnesses and documents

2

were produced out of the Northern District of California.

3

Consequently, litigation in the District of Nevada would impose additional costs

4

on Apple and require its witnesses to spend additional time away from their regular

5

employment than would otherwise be required if the case were prosecuted in the

6

Northern District of California. See In re Nintendo Co., Ltd., 589 F.3d 1194, 1199

distance [from home] means additional travel time; additional travel time increases the

9

probability for meal and lodging expenses; and additional travel time with overnight

10

stays increases the time these fact witnesses must be away from their regular

11

employment.”)). Indeed, courts in the Ninth Circuit have held that the “inconvenience

12

to witnesses is sometimes considered the most important factor in determining whether

13

a transfer of venue is appropriate.” GPNE Corp., 2012 WL 1656923, at *3 (citing

16

(N.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2005).

17

Further, as discussed above, the development by Unwired Planet of the

18

technology relating to the Asserted Patents occurred while Unwired Planet was located

19

in Northern California. Id. ¶¶ 7-11, Exs. 3-7. And the companies that bought Unwired

20

Planet’s operating business – Openwave Mobility, Inc. and Openwave Messaging, Inc.

– are still located in Northern California. Id. ¶ 24, Exs. 13-14. Thus, it is likely that

22

any technical witnesses involved in the development of the technology underlying the

23

patents at issue reside within the Northern District of California. See id. ¶ 28, Ex. 18.

24

Indeed, in the just-concluded case between Unwired Planet and Apple at the U.S.

25

International Trade Commission, every single one of Unwired Planet’s witnesses who

26

gave depositions were offered up by Unwired Planet for depositions in Northern

27

California. Id. ¶ 6.

And with respect to the attorneys who prosecuted the patents in suit, today, five

outside of the district, but within the state of California, in Los Angeles. Id. The

4

remaining prosecuting attorneys are in Colorado, Texas, and Washington State. Id.

None work or reside in Nevada. See id. Thus, the sources of proof associated with the

6

prosecution of the Asserted Patents are far more accessible in Northern California than

7

in Nevada.

8
9

In cases such as this, where the vast amount of evidence is in the proposed
transferee district, transfer is appropriate. See, e.g., In re Acer Am. Corp., 626 F.3d

10

1252, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that sources-of-proof factor favored transfer

11

where significant portion of evidence was located in the proposed transferee district).

12

4.

Many Non-Party Witnesses Would Be Subject to Compulsory Process

13

in the Northern District of California – None Would Be in the District

14

of Nevada

15

Because none of the foreseeable third-party witnesses are subject to compulsory

16

process in this District, but most would be if this action is transferred to the Northern

17

District of California, this factor weighs heavily in favor of transfer. In fact, as

18

detailed above in Section II.C., if this litigation were to remain in Nevada, Apple

19

would not be able to compel the attendance at trial of even one inventor or former

20

The Cost of Litigation Will Be Far Less in the Northern District of

It would be far less costly, for reasons set forth in detail above, to litigate this

8

case in the Northern District of California. First, the vast majority of sources of proof

9

– including party and non-party documents and witnesses – are located within the

10

Northern District of California. The travel costs associated with party and non-party

11

witnesses’ participation in trial, for example, would be much lower in the Northern

12

District of California, where virtually all of these witnesses are domiciled, than they

13

would be if this case were tried in the District of Nevada (assuming that the non-party

14

witnesses even agreed to show up for trial in the District of Nevada in the first place).

15

In re Verizon Bus. Network Servs., 635 F.3d 559, 561 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (where it was

16

undisputed that no witnesses resided within 100 miles of the transferor district,

17

transferring the case would “significantly” reduce the cost, time and expense of travel).

Unwired Planet’s Choice of Forum Is Entitled to Little, If Any,
Weight

A plaintiff’s choice of forum is “far from absolute,” even in situations in which

21

the plaintiff has strong and long-standing ties to that forum. See Lockman Found. v.

22

Evangelical Alliance Mission, 930 F.2d 764, 767 (9th Cir. 1991). What matters in the

23

transfer analysis is where the operative facts occurred, and therefore “[i]f the operative

24

facts have not occurred within the forum of original selection and that forum has no

25

particular interest in the parties or the subject matter, the plaintiff’s choice is entitled

26

only to minimal consideration.” Pac. Car & Foundry Co. v. Pence, 403 F.2d 949, 954

27

(9th Cir. 1968); see also GPNE Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 2012 WL 1656923, at *5

28

(“Where the action has little connection with the chosen forum, less deference is

1

afforded to plaintiff’s choice, even if plaintiff is a resident of the forum.”). “In patent

2

infringement, the preferred forum is ‘that which is the center of gravity of the accused

3

activity.’ The district court ‘ought to be as close as possible to the milieu of the

4

infringing device and the hub of activity centered around its production.’” GPNE

5

Corp., 2012 WL 1656923, at *5 (citations omitted).

6

Here, as also described in detail above, virtually all of the operative facts –

7

including the development of the alleged inventions, the prosecution of the Asserted

8

Patents, and the development of the accused products – occurred in the Northern

9

District of California, rather than in the District of Nevada. See Section III.B.2, supra.

10

The fact that the accused products may be sold in the District of Nevada – just as they

11

are in every other judicial district in the country, including in the Northern District of

12

California – is not persuasive in the transfer analysis. See Lycos, 499 F. Supp. 2d at

13

692 (“It is well-settled that the mere existence of limited sales activity within Virginia

14

does not require this court to give the plaintiff’s choice of forum substantial weight

15

when balancing the convenience and justice factors. . . . Moreover, the fact that

16

Virginia’s residents use the purportedly infringing products, methods, and systems

17

avails Lycos nothing, as Lycos is not suing those residents in this action.”); Osteotech,

18

Inc. v. GenSci Regeneration Scis., Inc., 6 F. Supp. 2d 349, 358 (D.N.J. 1998) (weight is

19

not given to “where limited sales activity has occurred”).

20

Plaintiff Unwired Planet LLC’s formation in Nevada and organization under

21

Nevada law just days before the Complaint was filed and Unwired Planet, Inc.’s recent

22

“move” to the District of Nevada should similarly be rejected as bases for resisting

23

transfer. See In re Microsoft, 630 F.3d at 1365 (finding transfer appropriate where the

24

plaintiff incorporated in the chosen forum sixteen days before the lawsuit was filed);

25

Pragmatus AV, LLC v. Facebook, Inc., 769 F. Supp. 2d 991, 995 (E.D. Va. 2011)

26

(finding that plaintiff’s choice of forum should be afforded “minimal weight” where

27

plaintiff was formed in the chosen forum five months before it filed the lawsuit). See

28

also Lycos, Inc. 499 F. Supp. 2d at 692 (minimizing significance of plaintiff’s alleged

connection with Virginia, where although plaintiff was incorporated in Virginia,

2

Virginia’s laws of incorporation were irrelevant to the lawsuit). Indeed, Unwired

3

Planet, Inc.’s CEO publicly admitted that these efforts were litigation driven. See

4

Wallace Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. 11.

5

C.

The Applicable Public Factors Favor Transfer

6

The local interest of the Northern District of California in having localized

7

controversies decided at home is strong here, where virtually all of the causes of action

8

and most of the applicable witnesses are located in that forum. See Sections II.B.2-3,

9

supra. Unwired Planet’s formation in Nevada just before filing this lawsuit does not

10

change the fact that this case involves two companies with deep roots in Northern

11

California, patents that were developed and prosecuted in Northern California, and

12

accused products that were developed in Northern California.
Given the close relationship of the controversies involved in this lawsuit with

13
14

the Northern District of California and their utter lack of relationship to Nevada, it

15

would be unfair to burden the citizens of Nevada with jury duty for this case. This is

16

particularly acute in this lawsuit, as it will likely require a lengthy trial, given that

17

Unwired Planet has chosen to assert ten different patents and accuse at least fifteen

18

different products of infringement. Compl. ¶¶ 15-24, 27.

19

D.

20

The Remaining Private and Public Factors Are Neutral or Not Applicable
All of the remaining private and public factors – the location where the relevant

21

agreements were negotiated and executed, the state that is most familiar with the

22

governing law, the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion, the

23

interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law

24

that must govern the action, and the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of

25

laws or in the application of foreign law – are either neutral or not applicable to this

26

lawsuit, and therefore do not affect the transfer calculus.
