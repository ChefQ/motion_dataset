1

Plaintiff Unwired Planet, LLC (“Unwired Planet”) files this Errata to its Opposition to

2

Apple’s Motion to Transfer (the redacted, non-confidential version is Doc. #63; the sealed

3

confidential version is Doc. #69). This Errata corrects the following (corrections in bold):

4

1. Pg. 5, lines 8-9, corrected to read: Unwired Planet did not want their move to

5
artificially delay their enforcement efforts, and therefore filed this action and another
6
7

against Google, Inc., a few days later.

8

2. Pg. 9, Lines 1-2. Deletion: Garvish Decl. ¶__.

9

3. Pg. 18, Footnote 17, lines 23-24, corrected to read: Conspicuously, Apple ignores the

10

many other Press Releases and SEC filings that confirm Unwired Planet Inc.’s

11
12

relocation to its Reno headquarters. Robbins Decl. ¶ 22; Garvish Decl. ¶ 4 Ex. 20.
4. Pg. 21, Footnote 19 (redacted), the reference to Garvish Decl. is corrected to specify

13
14
15
16

¶ 60, Ex. 76 122:12-19. (Exhibit 76 is filed under seal.)
5. Pg. 22, Footnote 20 (partially redacted), the reference is corrected to add a close
parentheses and period after Apple.”

17

For the ease of the Court, a corrected version of Unwired Planet’s Opposition to Apple’s Motion

18

to Transfer (confidential filing under seal, Doc. #69) will be delivered to the Clerk of the Court

19

following the filing of this Errata.
