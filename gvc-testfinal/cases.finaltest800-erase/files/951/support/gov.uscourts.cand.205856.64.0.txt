INTRODUCTION
On November 10, 2008, all three defendants in this action — Daniel Egger, Software

8

Rights Archive, LLC (“SRA”), and Site Technologies, Inc. (“Site Technologies”) (collectively,

9

“Defendants”) — moved to dismiss, transfer, or stay this proceeding. The motion was filed by

10

the same law firms representing SRA in this proceeding and in the co-pending proceeding in the

11

Eastern District of Texas.1

12

To the extent that SRA’s counsel purported to file the motion on Site Technologies’

13

behalf, the filing was improper. SRA’s counsel does not — and cannot — jointly represent Site

14

Technologies in this proceeding. There are at least two critical reasons for this:

15

First, no one with authority to authorize Site Technologies’ retention of SRA’s counsel

16

has done so. Site Technologies filed for bankruptcy in February 1999. The bankruptcy court

17

entered an order confirming a liquidating Chapter 11 plan on June 15, 2000. Under the plan,

18

Jeffrey Ait was appointed Responsible Person and charged with winding up Site’s bankruptcy

19

estate. The plan expressly stated that upon entry of a final decree closing the bankruptcy case,

20

Mr. Ait would be discharged from his duties and responsibilities as Responsible Person. The

21

bankruptcy court issued the Final Decree in January 2004, thereby (i) dissolving and terminating

22

Site Technologies’ existence as a corporation pursuant to the First Amended Plan of

23

Reorganization (“Plan”) and (ii) discharging Mr. Ait from his role as Responsible Person. While

24

the bankruptcy case was recently reopened, the bankruptcy court has not ordered that Site

25
26
27

1

The law firms are: Smyser Kaplan & Veselka, P.C.; DiNovo Price Ellwanger & Hardy
LLP; and Law Offices of Thomas Smegal (collectively, “SRA’s counsel”). Mr. Smegal has
entered an appearance for Defendants only in this proceeding. The Smyser and DiNovo firms
have entered appearances for Defendants and/or SRA both in this proceeding and in the copending Texas proceeding.

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE SITE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.’S MOTION OT DISMISS, TRANSFER, OR STAY
Case No. C-08-03172-RMW
sf-2625079

1

Technologies be revived as a corporation, authorized SRA’s counsel’s joint representation of Site

2

Technologies’ bankruptcy estate, or appointed a new Responsible Person or other person as a

3

fiduciary for the estate’s beneficiaries with authority to retain SRA’s counsel.

4

Second, even assuming that SRA’s counsel had been appointed to represent the

5

bankruptcy estate, joint representation of both SRA and Site Technologies still would be

6

improper. SRA has alleged that it owns the three asserted patents in this case. Site Technologies’

7

bankruptcy estate also has a claim to ownership of the three patents for the benefit of the Plan’s

8

beneficiaries. In light of these competing claims, SRA’s and Site Technologies’ interests are

9

plainly adverse — if Site Technologies’ bankruptcy estate owns the patents, SRA cannot. The

10

ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the California Rules of Professional

11

Responsibility bar joint representation in situations like this. Moreover, no one has sought the

12

consent of the estate’s Plan beneficiaries to abandon the estate’s rights to these patents.

13

Because SRA’s counsel does not and cannot represent Site Technologies’ bankruptcy

14

estate in this proceeding, the filing of Defendants’ motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer this

15

proceeding on behalf of all three Defendants was improper. Plaintiffs therefore ask that the Court

16

strike Defendants’ motion, to the extent that it purports to be brought on behalf of the Site

17

Technologies estate.

18

II.

STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS

19

A.

20

In its filings in this Court, SRA has alleged that it owns the three patents at issue in this

Site Technologies’ Bankruptcy Estate, not SRA, Owns the Patents.

21

action.2 A gap in the chain of title from the inventors to SRA, however, prevents SRA from

22

owning the patents. Specifically:
The named inventors assigned their rights in the asserted patents to Libertech Inc.3
in 1993 and 1996;

23
24

25
26

See Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Transfer, or Stay under the First-to-File Rule, under
Rule 12(b)(2) for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, and under Rule 12(b)(1) for Lack of Subject
Matter Jurisdiction (“Motion to Dismiss”) at 3 (Docket No. 42).

Libertech Inc. was later renamed “site/technologies/inc.” in 1996, and Deltapoint was
renamed “Site Technologies, Inc.” in early 1998. To avoid confusion, this brief refers to either
Libertech Inc. or site/technologies/inc. as “Libertech.” Similarly, this brief refers to Deltapoint,

1

Libertech and Site Technologies (then known as Deltapoint Inc.) executed a Stock
Exchange Agreement in July 11, 1997,4 but whereas Libertech became and
continued to exist as a subsidiary of Site Technologies after the transaction, Site
Technologies never acquired title to the asserted patents in connection therewith;

2
3

Despite not having obtained title to the patents from its subsidiary Libertech, Site
Technologies purported to assign the patents back to Mr. Egger on September 16,
1998;5 and

4
5

Mr. Egger attempted to assign the patents to Software Rights Archive, Inc. (the
predecessor to SRA) on February 22, 20056

6
7

The true current owner of the three asserted patents is Site Technologies’ bankruptcy

8
9

estate. The bankruptcy estate acquired the patents during the bankruptcy proceeding, when it

10

filed a certificate merging Libertech (Site Technologies’ subsidiary and then the owner of the

11

patents) with Site Technologies.7 This operated to vest the estate’s Plan beneficiaries with a

12

direct beneficial interest in the patents (as opposed to an interest in Libertech stock).

Site Technologies filed for bankruptcy in this District on February 2, 1999. The

16

bankruptcy court appointed Jeffrey Ait, the Chief Executive Officer of Site Technologies pre-

17

bankruptcy, as the Responsible Person for the Debtor.8 The bankruptcy court also approved the

retention of Murray & Murray P.C. as bankruptcy counsel and Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &

3

the bankruptcy court approve the retention of Smyser Kaplan & Veselka, P.C., DiNovo Price

4

Ellwanger & Hardy LLP, or Thomas Smegal for any purpose.

5

On June 15, 2000, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Plan.10 According to the Plan’s

6

plain terms, “the Debtor shall be dissolved and its corporate existence terminated without further

7

corporate action upon the entry of a Final Decree.”11 The Plan also provided that “[t]he

8

Responsible Person shall be discharged from all duties and responsibilities of the Plan upon the

9

issuance of the final decree.”12 On January 6, 2004, the bankruptcy court issued the Final Decree

10

dissolving Site Technologies and terminating its existence and Mr. Ait’s role as the Responsible

11

Person.13

12

C.

14

Although No Longer the Responsible Person, Mr. Ait Continues to Take
Actions Purportedly on the Bankruptcy Estate’s Behalf in Violation of the
Plan, Such as Retaining SRA’s Counsel.

Although Mr. Ait’s status as the Responsible Person ended on January 4, 2004 (and his

15

status as the CEO for Site Technologies years before that), Mr. Ait has continued to take multiple

16

actions purportedly on the bankruptcy estate’s behalf — all contrary to the confirmed bankruptcy

17

Plan and the Plan beneficiary’s interest, and all without seeking the bankruptcy court’s consent.

18

Each of these actions also has been adverse to the bankruptcy estate’s interests and to SRA’s

19

apparent benefit. For example, with the encouragement of SRA and despite his lack of authority

20

and contrary to the Plan, Mr. Ait:

9

For purposes of this motion, the most pertinent action taken without authority is Mr. Ait’s
purported retention of SRA’s counsel to jointly represent Site Technologies’ bankruptcy estate.

10

Apparently with Mr. Ait’s consent — but without seeking the bankruptcy court’s approval or

11

consent of all parties-in-interest and beneficiaries of the bankruptcy estate, SRA’s counsel has

12

purported to represent Site Technologies in multiple filings before this Court. Most recently,

13

SRA’s counsel moved to dismiss, transfer, or stay this proceeding, purportedly on behalf of Mr.

14

Egger, SRA, and Site Technologies, on November 10, 2008.

18

Although the Bankruptcy Case Was Recently Reopened, SRA’s Counsel Have
Not Requested Permission to Represent the Bankruptcy Estate, and Mr. Ait
Has Not Sought Bankruptcy Court Approval to Resume His Former Role as
Responsible Person.

On November 26, 2008, Sherwood Finance (Delaware), LLC (“Sherwood”), a beneficial

19

owner of 9% of Site Technologies’ bankruptcy estate, sought to reopen the closed bankruptcy

20

case in this District in light of the bankruptcy estate’s ownership of the patents.17 Judge Efremsky

21

granted Sherwood’s application to reopen the bankruptcy case on December 1, 2008 and held a

22

case management conference on December 17, 2008. At the conference, SRA’s counsel did not

seek permission to represent the bankruptcy estate, revive Site Technologies as a corporation, or

2

4

district judge in the related Texas proceeding decided a pending motion to dismiss.

5

III.

6

ARGUMENT
A.

7
8
9

No One with Authority Has Appointed SRA’s Counsel to Represent Site
Technologies — Much Less File a Motion to Dismiss on Its Behalf.

Under the plain terms of the Plan, Mr. Ait’s role as the Responsible Person ended when
the Final Decree was entered on January 4, 2004. Section 7.3(F) of the Plan clearly states, “The

10

Responsible Person shall be discharged from all duties and responsibilities of the Plan upon the

11

issuance of the final decree.” No one – including Mr. Ait – appears to dispute that he is no longer

12

the Responsible Person for Site Technologies’ bankruptcy estate or an officer of Site

13

Technologies.18

14

Because Mr. Ait is no longer an agent for Site Technologies, all of his actions on its behalf

15

after entry of the Final Decree are invalid.19 These include his purported appointment of SRA’s

16

counsel to represent Site Technologies and, most recently, his approval of SRA’s counsel’s filing

17

of the motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer on Site Technologies’ behalf. Because no one with

18

authority has authorized SRA’s counsel’s representation of Site Technologies, SRA’s counsel’s

19

attempts to jointly represent Site Technologies (and all acts taken pursuant to that purported joint

20

representation) also are invalid.20

21
22
23
24

18

Despite previously purporting to “act and remain” as the CEO of Site Technologies in
his August 13, 2008 declaration (Ho Decl. Ex. M), Mr. Ait apparently has acknowledged the
falsity of this representation and has not repeated it in a more recent declaration. See Third
Declaration of Jeffrey Franklin Ait, dated December 8, 2008 (“I was the Chief Executive Officer
of the debtor Site Technologies, Inc . . . . I was also the official ‘Responsible Person’ under the
bankruptcy plan . . . .”) (emphasis added).

Moreover, even assuming that SRA’s counsel had been appointed to represent the

Conflicts Rules Also Bar SRA’s Counsel’s Purported Joint Representation.

3

bankruptcy estate, joint representation of both SRA and Site Technologies still would be

4

improper. SRA claims that it owns the three asserted patents in this case. Parties with an interest

5

in Site Technologies’ bankruptcy estate have alleged that the Site Technologies’ bankruptcy

6

estate owns the patents. These competing claims to the patents are clearly adverse.

7

Under the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the California Rules of

8

Professional Conduct, SRA’s counsel could not possibly represent both SRA and Site

9

Technologies here.21 Under Rule 1.7 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct:

10

[A] lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves
a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest
exists if:

11
12

(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to
another client; or

13

15

(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or
more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s
responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third
person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.

16

Likewise, under the Rule 3-310(C) of the California Rules of Professional Conduct:

14

17

A member shall not, without the informed written consent of each
client:

relationship should not be based on the acts of an intermediary, because such a finding would be
contrary to the fundamental principles of attorney-client representation.”); see also Gaming v.
Dorsey & Whitney, LLP, Case No. 06CV2804 BTM (WMC), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80270, at
*15-16 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2008) (“An attorney-client relationship can only be formed through an
express or implied contract for representation.”); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing
Lawyers § 14 (2000) (an attorney-client relationship requires either that a person manifest intent
to hire the lawyer, combined with the lawyers express or implied consent, or that the lawyer be
appointed by a tribunal to represent the person).
21

25
26
27

Plaintiffs do not allege or mean to imply in any way that SRA’s counsel has acted
unethically by claiming to jointly represent Site Technologies. Plaintiffs believe that SRA’s
counsel is operating under a good faith, but incorrect, belief that Mr. Ait’s retention of them to
represent Site Technologies is valid. Plaintiffs have conferred with SRA’s counsel about these
issues. See, e.g., Letter from Richard S.J. Hung to Lee L. Kaplan, dated September 17, 2008 (Ho
Decl. Ex. N).

None of the exceptions to these rules (e.g., for the ABA rules, a reasonable belief that “the
lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client,” or
for both the ABA and California rules, informed written consent) applies here. SRA’s counsel,
without authorization to act on behalf of all parties with an interest in SRA’s bankruptcy estate,
instead rejects out of hand that Site Technologies’ bankruptcy estate has an interest in the patents.
SRA lacks Site Technologies’ consent to represent it (as Site Technologies the corporation no
longer exists) and further lacks consent from the court and all interested parties to represent Site
Technologies’ bankruptcy estate. For these reasons, as well, SRA’s counsel’s purported filing of
the motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay on Site Technologies’ behalf also is invalid and must be
stricken.

CONCLUSION
It is undisputed that Mr. Ait is no longer the Responsible Person for Site Technologies and

cannot act on its behalf. Because no one with authority has retained (or could retain) SRA’s

purports to be brought on behalf of Site Technologies.
