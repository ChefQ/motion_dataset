UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

SOFTWARE RIGHTS ARCHIVE, LLC Case No. Misc. Action C-09-80004

Plaintiff, Case No.: 2:07-cev-511 (CE)
EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
vs.
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO
GOOGLE INC., YAHOO! INC., IAC COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH
SEARCH & MEDIA, INC., AOL, LLC YAHOO! INC.'S SUBPOENA ON
AND LYCOS, INC. MURRAY & MURRAY PC
Defendants.

 

MURRAY & MURRAY, PC ("Murray") was served a subpoena by Yahoo! Inc.
("Yahoo!") on December 22, 2008. Murray responded and objected to the subpoena in a
timely manner. Copies of the Yahoo! subpoena and Murray's response to same are
attached as Exhibits A and B to Mr. De Hope's declaration.

Murray met its affirmative obligation to object to a subpoena seeking disclosure of
privileged information by asserting the attorney client privilege, the work product
privilege, the privacy rights of its client, similar privileges and immunities, and
documents subject to non-disclosure agreements. (Business and Professions Code

Section 6068(e); Evidence Code section 955; California Rules of Professional Conduct,

Rule 3-100). MURRAY may not and has not disclosed client confidential information
without the consent of Site Technologies, Inc. and/or any successor in interest.

Murray also objected due to the burdensome and expensive nature of the overly
broad requests. Murray further objected to the requests to the extent they exceeded the
agreed scope of discovery as set forth in the objections of plaintiff.

Without waiving its objections, Murray explained that all of the documents it has
in its possession relating to the requests are documents maintained, obtained, prepared,
and/or considered by or on behalf of MURRAY or are otherwise within the course and
scope of its legal representation of the debtor in United States Bankruptcy Court,
Northern District of California Case No. 99-50736. This demonstrates that the
documents may not be produced for the reasons stated.

Murray understands that the parties to this extensive litigation, filed in several
courts and jurisdictions, dispute the existence or extent of the privileges. Murray has

been placed in an untenable position by these differing positions. If Murray complies

with the subpoena and produces documents as requested, Murray is subject to a possible

claim by its client or others claiming that the documents should not be produced. By
asserting the privileges, Murray faces this motion to compel for failing to comply with
the subpoena.

Murray seeks guidance from this Court. Murray asks the Court to determine
whether there is an existing holder of the privileges, whether a holder of the privileges
may be reinstated if there is no existing holder of the privileges, whether a person or
entity will be appointed as the holder of the privileges or whether the privileges, in whole
or in part, are irrevocably waived or no longer available to any person or entity that holds,
ever held or may hereafter assert the privileges.

Further, as stated in the declaration of Joseph J. De Hope, Jr., filed herewith, the
cost of complying with the subpoena is substantial and it is not fair to require that a third
party incur these costs. If Murray is required to respond to the subpoena, it is respectfully
