SRA and Egger’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike is effectively a non-opposition.1

2

Indeed, by filing the Response on behalf of SRA and Egger only, and not on behalf of Site

3

Technologies, Inc. (“Site Technologies”) SRA and Egger concede that their counsel does not

4

represent Site Technologies.

5

SRA and Egger do not attempt to rebut Plaintiffs’ showing that their counsel cannot

6

represent Site Technologies in this proceeding. They also do not put forward any theory as to

7

why their counsel should be permitted to file motions on behalf of an entity whose interests are

8

adverse to their own. For all the reasons set forth in their opening brief, Plaintiffs’ Motion to

9

Strike therefore should be granted.

10

SRA and Egger’s only argument is that Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike is a “waste of time”

11

because this action allegedly should be dismissed. As Plaintiffs explained in their Opposition to

12

the Motion to Dismiss, however, neither this motion nor this action is a waste of time.2 This case

13

is appropriately before this Court and should remain so.
