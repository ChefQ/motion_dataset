MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I. INTRODUCTION

This is a trademark dispute in which Plaintiff Helio LLC ("Helio") alleges that
Defendant Paim, Inc. (`Palm') infringes on Helio's DON'T CALL IT A PHONE trademark by |
using the confusingly similar slogan "Not Just a Cell Phone' in its current advertising
campaign. Palm made representations to the Court at the December 21, 2006 hearing on
Helio's motion for a temporary restraining order that Palm's outdoor advertising would cease
on December 31, 2006 and that Palm's other advertising would terminate during the first few
months of 2007. Based upon Helio's verification of this in the marketplace, Helio now
moves to dismiss this action without prejudice in its entirety.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE

Palm began using the slogan "Not Just a Cell Phone' in its advertising campaign in
December 2006. Shortly after discovering this use, Helio sought a temporary restraining
order to prohibit Palm's use of the offending slogan in Palm's advertising campaign.

Although this Court believed that the issue was "very close", it ultimately denied Helio's
request for a TRO. The Court based its decision, in part, on Palm's representation that
Palm's outdoor advertising would stop on December 31, 2006 and that Palm would soon
discontinue its advertising campaign during the first few months of 2007.

Helio has now verified that Palm is indeed winding down its advertising campaign
using the infringing slogan "Not Just a Cell Phone." Accordingly, Helio now seeks to dismiss
this action, the primary basis of which was to enjoin Palm's use of the infringing slogan.

lil. ARGUMENT

After an answer has been filed, an "action shail not be dismissed at the plaintiffs
instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court
deems proper." Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 41(a)(2). In ruling on whether to dismiss, the Court

determines: (1) whether to allow dismissal at all; (2) whether the dismissal should be with or

Case 4:06-cv-07754-SBA Document 78 _ Filed 03/21/2007 Page4of5

without prejudice; and (3) what terms and conditions, if any, should be imposed. See
Spencer v. Moore Business Forms, Inc., 87 F.R.D 118, 119 (N.D. Cal. 1980).

A. Dismissal Should Be Allowed Since Paim Will Not Suffer Legal Harm.

Whether to allow dismissal rests in the Court's sound discretion. Hamilton v.
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 679 F.2d 143, 145 (9" Cir. 1982). The general rule is that "in
most cases, dismissal should be granted unless the defendant will suffer some legal harm |
... other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit." Spencer, 87 F.R.D. at 119.

Palm will not suffer any legal harm as a result of Helio's dismissal. No counter-claims
have been filed by Palm and Palm will not lose any substantive legal rights as a result of a
dismissal without prejudice. Fed. R. Civ. P Rule 41(a)(2). As such, dismissal is appropriate.

B. The Dismissal Should Be Without Prejudice To Helio's Right to Re-File

This Suit if Palm Reinstitutes Its Infringing Campaign.

In deciding whether to allow dismissal without prejudice, the following factors are
generally considered: (i) defendant's efforts and expenses incurred in preparation for trial;
(ii) plaintiff's diligence in prosecuting the action; (iii) plaintiff's explanation of the need to
dismiss; and (iv) the status of the litigation.

This case was filed only three months ago and a trial date has not been set. What
little testimonial and document discovery that has been taken has focused on Helio's motion
for preliminary injunction, the purpose of which is now obviated by this Motion. Helio has
diligently pursued this matter since its inception and has not attempted to prolong this
dispute unnecessarily. Helio's purpose in filing this action was to stop Paim from using the
infringing slogan "Not Just a Cell Phone" in its advertising campaign. Palm has previously
represented to the Court and Helio has now verified that Palm is indeed winding down its
advertising campaign. As a result there is no substantive reason to continue this litigation.
Helio has achieved its litigation objectives and no longer wishes to burden the resources of -

this Court or the parties with this action.

Helio requests a dismissal without prejudice in the event that Palm seeks to resurrect
its advertising campaign or begin using the infringing slogan again.
IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Helio respectfully requests this Court dismiss this entire

matter without prejudice.
