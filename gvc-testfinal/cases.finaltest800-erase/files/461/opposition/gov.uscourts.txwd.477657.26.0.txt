CAUSE NO. 5:11-cv-00268-HLH

DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
Hill Country Shooting Sports Center, Inc. files this response to plaintiff’s motion for
liquidated damages and would respectfully show the Court as follows:
Introduction
1.

Plaintiff’s claim for liquidated damages should be denied or, at a minimum, be

greatly reduced because (1) the jury determined that Ms. Barney’s claims were inflated by 60%,
(2) the jury also determined that Ms. Barney’s estimates of her own hours were unreasonable,
and (3) Texas Hill Country Shooting Sports has satisfied the Texas Workforce Commission
award in the amount of $13,619.19.

Argument & Authorities
I.

HILL COUNTRY SHOOTING SPORTS’ NON-PAYMENT WAS BOTH REASONABLE
GOOD FAITH.

AND IN

A.

The “Willfulness” Finding is Not Binding Upon the Court’s Determination of
“Good Faith.”

2.

Under the FLSA, an employer who violates the overtime provisions is liable not

only for the unpaid overtime compensation, but also for "an additional equal amount as
liquidated damages." 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). At one time, this liquidated damages assessment was
mandatory. See Bernard v. IBP,Inc. of Neb., 154 F.3d 259, 267 (5th Cir. 1998). However,
“the district court can now decline to award such damages (or reduce the amount) if
the court concludes that the employer acted in "good faith" and had "reasonable
grounds" to believe that its actions complied with the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. § 260. We
review the district court's decision to award liquidated damages for abuse of
discretion.See Heidtman v. County of El Paso, 171 F.3d 1038, 1042 (5th Cir. 1999); Lee
v. Coahoma County, Miss., 937 F.2d 220, 226(5th Cir. 1991).”
Singer v. City of Waco, 324 F. 3d 813, 822-23 (5th Cir. 2003) (emphasis supplied).
3.

Ms. Barney cites the Singer decision for the proposition that a jury finding of

“willfulness” means the Court cannot find “good faith” or reasonableness. Motion at p.2. Not
only is this not the holding of Singer, but other Fifth Circuit decisions make clear that the two
issues cannot be read together. Stokes v. Bwxt Pantex, 424 Fed.Appx. 324 (5th Cir. 2011) (“We
have previously refused to read the "good faith" and "willful" provisions together.”). Nero v.
Industrial Molding Corporation, 167 F.3d 921 (5th Cir. 1999) (“Thus, we decline to read the
"good faith" requirement together with the term "willful" in the FMLA.”).
4.

The Court, and not the jury, is required to determine whether the defendant acted

in good faith and had reasonable grounds to not pay the amounts sought.

B.

Reasonable Grounds Exist Because the Jury Determined That Ms. Barney’s
Claims Were Exaggerated By 60%.

5.

At trial, Ms. Barney claimed that she was entitled to $49,667.26. PX 4. The jury,

however, determined that Ms. Barney was entitled to only $29,500 in overtime pay, meaning the
amount she testified she was owed was roughly 60% higher than the actual amount of overtime
she worked.
6.

Hill Country Shooting had a reasonable belief that Ms. Barney had exaggerated

her hours and claims. The jury agreed. The evidence at trial also established the subjective
belief of Mr. Burch that the hours claimed were significantly inflated. The jury agreed.
7.

Ms. Barney’s liquidated damage claim should be denied or, alternatively, reduced

in the Court’s discretion due to the significant inflation of her hours and claim amounts.
C.

Reasonable Grounds And Good Faith Exist Because the Jury Determined
That Ms. Barney’s Estimates Were Unreasonable.

8.

The Court instructed the jury that if the defendant did not keep records, the jury

must accept the plaintiff’s estimates of her overtime hours, unless the jury found those estimates
to be unreasonable.
9.

At trial, Ms. Barney estimated that she was entitled to $49,667.26. PX 4. The

jury, however, determined that Ms. Barney was entitled to only $29,500 in overtime pay,
meaning that the jury determined her estimates to be unreasonable.
10.

Hill Country Shooting had a reasonable belief that Ms. Barney had advanced

unreasonable hours and claims. The jury agreed. The evidence at trial also established the
subjective belief of Mr. Burch that the hours claimed were unreasonable. The jury agreed.

11.

Filed 04/16/12 Page 4 of 5

Ms. Barney’s liquidated damage claim should be denied or, alternatively, reduced

in the Court’s discretion because the jury determined that her estimate of hours worked was not
simply “off,” “mistaken,” or “incorrect,” but unreasonable.
D.

Defendant’s Good Faith is Further Reflected in its Decision to Not Oppose
the Attorneys’ Fees Sought by Ms. Barney.

12.

Hill Country Shooting does not oppose the award of attorneys’ fees and expenses

separately sought by Ms. Barney. Ms. Barney will be made whole by any judgment entered.
II.

HILL COUNTRY SHOOTING HAS SATISFIED THE TEXAS WORKFORCE
AWARD IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,619.19.
13.

COMMISSION

Hill Country Shooting has paid the full amount of the Texas Workforce

Commission award, or $13,619.19. This amount was an award for hours within the same period
sought in this lawsuit. A Texas Workforce Award is res judicata in subsequent proceedings.
See, e.g., Igal v.Brightstar Info. Tech. Grp., Inc., 250 S.W.3d 78 (Tex. 2007) (applying res
judicata to orders of the Texas Workforce Commission).
14.

Ms. Barney cannot recover judgment in this action for an amount that (1) has

already been paid, and (2) is barred by res judicata. As a result, if the Court is inclined to award
liquidated damages, it must reduce the underlying balance to $15,880.81 before considering the
application or reduction of liquidated damages.
15.

True and correct copies of the certified mail receipt and check stub are attached as

Exhibit A. Defendant does not yet have complete copies of the remaining payment documents,
but will supplement this response immediately upon receiving those documents.
