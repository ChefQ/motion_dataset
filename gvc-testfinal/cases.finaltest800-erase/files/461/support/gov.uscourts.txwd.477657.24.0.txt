CIVIL ACTION NO. SA-11-CA-268-HLH

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
Plaintiff Deborah S. Barney files this motion for a judgment which includes $29,500.00 for
liquidated damages.
Plaintiff brought this civil action against Defendants Hill Country Shooting Sports Center,
Inc. and Jack N. Burch, II, pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1934, 29 U.S.C. § 201, et
seq. A trial was held and on March 27, 2012, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant Hill Country Shooting Sports Center, Inc. finding Defendant willfully failed to
pay Plaintiff $29,500.00 for overtime she worked from April 5, 2008 through July 31, 2010.
In ruling on this matter, the Court should be guided by the principle to construe the Fair
Labor Standards Act liberally in favor of Plaintiff. Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy & Assoc., 358
U.S. 207, 211 (1959); Allen v. McWane, Inc., 593 F.3d 449, 452 (5th Cir. 2010).
Liquidated damages are compensatory rather than punitive in nature. See Brooklyn Sav.
Bank v. O'Neill, 324 U.S. 697, 707 (1945). Liquidated damages “constitute[ ] compensation for
the retention of a workman's pay which might result in damages too obscure and difficult of proof
for estimate other than by liquidated damages.” Id. The purpose of liquidated damages is to
“compensate an employee for delay in payment.” Reich v. Helicopter Servs., Inc., 8 F.3d 1018, 1031

Case 5:11-cv-00268-HLH Document 24 Filed 04/03/12 Page 2 of 5

(5th Cir. 1993) (citing Brooklyn Sav. Bank v. O’Neil, 324 U.S. 697, 715–16 (1945)).
Under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), employers who violate the FLSA's overtime pay provisions
“shall be liable to the ... employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their
unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated
damages.” (Emphasis added). There is a strong presumption in favor of imposing full liquidated
damages under the Act. Nero v. Indus. Molding Corp., 167 F.3d 921, 929 (5th Cir. 1999).
The Court must determine whether to award liquidated damages. Employers that violate
the FLSA are liable not only for the unpaid overtime pay but also for "an additional equal amount
as liquidated damages." 29 U.S.C. § 216(b); Singer v. City of Waco, Tex., 324 F.3d 813, 822 (5th
Cir. 2002). Defendant's only means of avoiding liquidated damages is to overcome the "substantial
burden" of proving it acted both in good faith and based on objectively reasonable grounds.
Mireles v. Frio Foods, Inc., 899 F.2d 1407, 1415 (5th Cir. 1990). A jury's finding of willfulness,
however, negates an employer's good faith. Singer, 324 F.3d at 823.
The general rule is a court should award the amount found for actual damages as liquidated
damages. Singer, 324 F.3d at 822–23. The Fifth Circuit confirmed in Singer, an employer who
violates the overtime provisions of the FLSA is liable not only for the unpaid overtime
compensation, but also for ‘‘an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.’’ 29 U.S.C. §
216(b). At one time, the liquidated damages assessment was mandatory. See Bernard v. IBP, Inc.
of Neb., 154 F.3d 259, 267 (5th Cir.1998).

Now the district court can decline to award such

damages (or reduce the amount) if the court concludes the employer acted in ‘‘good faith’’ and had
‘‘reasonable grounds’’ to believe its actions complied with the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. § 260; Singer, 324
F.3d at 822–23; see also 29 C.F.R. § 790.22(b). It is the employer’s burden to prove good faith and
reasonableness. Lee v. Coahoma Cnty., Mississippi, 937 F.2d 220, 227 (5th Cir. 1991); Johnson

Case 5:11-cv-00268-HLH Document 24 Filed 04/03/12 Page 3 of 5

v. Big Lots Stores, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 2d 903, 925 (E.D. La. 2009). If the jury concludes the
employer has willfully violated the FLSA, the employer cannot demonstrate good faith, and the
court must award liquidated damages in the full amount. Singer, 324 F.3d at 823 (citing Heidtman
v. El Paso, 171 F.3d 1038, 1042 (5th Cir. 1999)); Lee, 937 F.2d at 226.
Since the jury in this case made a finding Defendant acted willfully, the Court must award
$29,500.00 for liquidated damages.
Wherefore, premises considered Plaintiff Deborah S. Barney requests the Court enter a
judgment for the amounts awarded by the jury for actual damages of $29,500.00 plus an additional
equal amount for liquidated damages.
