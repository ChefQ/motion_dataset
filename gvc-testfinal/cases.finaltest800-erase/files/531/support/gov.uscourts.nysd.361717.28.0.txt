Case 1:10-cv-03332-KMW -MHD Document 28 Filed 08/20/10 Page 6 of 18

Defendant Ernst & Young LLP respectfully submits this memorandum of law in support
of its motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, stay proceedings and compel arbitration. As
detailed below, the Court should dismiss plaintiff Stephanie Sutherland's complaint and compel
the arbitration of plaintiff's individual claims asserted therein in accordance with the Federal
Arbitration Act ("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1-16, because plaintiff is required to assert her claims in
arbitration. In the alternative, the Court should stay the proceedings pending the arbitration of

plaintiff's claims.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

This case involves claims subject to binding arbitration. Plaintiff Stephanie Sutherland is
a former employee of Ernst & Young who claims that she and other allegedly similarly situated
individuals were improperly classified as exempt from federal and state overtime laws. The
lawsuit cannot go forward, however, because plaintiff expressly agreed to arbitrate the precise
claims asserted in her complaint. Plaintiff's effort to bypass the dispute resolution procedures
that she agreed to should be rejected. Ernst & Young, therefore, respectfully requests an order
dismissing plaintiff's claims and compelling her to utilize the dispute resolution procedures to

which she agreed to arbitrate her individual claims.!

 

" In Mansberger v. Ernst & Young LLP. et al. (No. 10-CV-3883 (KMW), which is also before the
Court, plaintiff also agreed to Ernst & Young's dispute resolution program. Sutherland, however,
has raised a question regarding the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over Mansberger. If the
Court determines that it has jurisdiction, Ernst & Young intends to move to compel arbitration of
Mansberger's claims as well.
Case 1:10-cv-03332-KMW -MHD Document 28 Filed 08/20/10 Page 7 of 18

BACKGROUND
I, Sutherland's Agreement To Arbitrate Her Claims

Plaintiff commenced her employment at Ernst & Young as a staff on September 17, 2008.
Declaration of Dea Reece 0x00A7 4 ("Reece Decl."). Ernst & Young terminated Sutherland's
employment effective December 8, 2009. Id.

On or about August 14, 2007, Ernst & Young mailed Sutherland a letter offering her
employment, and enclosing various documents for her to review and sign. Jd., Ex. A? Three
weeks later, on or about September 5, 2007, Sutherland signed and accepted her offer in a letter,
which set out the terms of her employment, and, in bold language, informed Sutherland that all
employment-related disputes would be subject to mandatory mediation or arbitration pursuant to
Ernst & Young's dispute resolution program (the Common Ground Dispute Resolution Program
or the "Program"), a copy of which was enclosed with her offer letter. Jd. The offer letter states:

You understand that if an employment related dispute arises between you and

the firm, it will be subject to mandatory mediation/arbitration under the terms

of the firm's alternative dispute resolution program, known as the Common

Ground Program, a copy of which is attached.

Id. (emphasis in original).

On or about September 5, 2007, Sutherland also signed a Confidentiality Agreement,

which expressly incorporates the Program and requires that certain disputes be submitted to

arbitration in accordance with the Program. Jd., Ex. B. The Confidentiality Agreement states:

I further agree that any dispute, controversy or claim (as defined in the E&Y
Common Ground Dispute Resolution Program (AA7521) attached) arising between

 

* The Court may consider extrinsic evidence, such as the arbitration agreement or affidavits, in
deciding whether Sutherland's claims are subject to an enforceable agreement to arbitrate under
the FAA. See Banus v. Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc., No. 09 Civ. 7128 (LAK), 2010 WL
1643780, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2010); BS Sun Shipping Monrovia v. Citgo Petroleum Corp.,
No. 06 Civ. 839 (HB), 2006 WL 2265041, at *3, n. 6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2006) (noting that it is
"proper (and in fact necessary) to consider such extrinsic evidence when faced with a motion to
compel arbitration.")
Case 1:10-cv-03332-KMW -MHD Document 28 Filed 08/20/10 Page 8 of 18

myself and the Firm will be submitted first to mediation and, if mediation is

unsuccessful, then to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms and

conditions set forth in AA7521, which describes the Firm's Common Ground

Dispute Resolution Program. I acknowledge that I have read and understand the

E&Y Common Ground Dispute Resolution Program (AA7521) and that I shall

abide by it.

Id. The Confidentiality Agreement is governed by New York law. Jd.
Il. Ernst & Young's Common Ground Dispute Resolution Program

Ernst & Young's Common Ground Program applies to current and former employees of
Ernst & Young. Jd, Ex. C 4 II.A.2.

The Program is the "sole method for resolving disputes within its coverage." /d.{ I. It
applies to "all claims, controversies or other disputes" between Ernst & Young and the employee
that could otherwise be resolved by a court, with very limited exceptions that do not apply here.
Id. 0x00A7 11.B.1. The Program lists examples of disputes that are covered, including, among others,
claims: (1) "based on federal statutes such as . . . the Fair Labor Standards Act"; (2) "based on

state statutes"; and (3) "concerning wages, salary, and incentive compensation programs" (the

"Covered Disputes"). Id. 0x00A7 II.C. The Program clearly provides that it is the exclusive means for
resolving such Covered Disputes:
Both the Firm and the Employee give up any right to resolve any Covered Dispute
through any other means. Neither the Firm nor an Employee will be able to sue
in court in connection with a Covered Dispute.
Id. | 11.B.1 (emphasis in original).
In addition, the Program explicitly informs employees that if they file a lawsuit against
Ernst & Young, Ernst & Young may proceed directly to arbitration or seek an order to compel
compliance with the Program:
If a party files a lawsuit relating to a Covered Dispute in court in violation of the
terms of the Program, the other party may choose to proceed directly to Phase II

[arbitration] or to seek an order requiring the party who filed the lawsuit to satisfy
the requirements of the Program.
Case 1:10-cv-03332-KMW -MHD Document 28 Filed 08/20/10 Page 9 of 18

Id. { 1V.B. Covered Disputes pertaining to different employees must be brought in separate
arbitration proceedings. Jd. J IV.K.

The Program, among other things, authorizes the arbitrator to "provide for reimbursement
of the Employee's attorney's fees, in whole or part, in accordance with applicable law or in the
interest of justice." Jd.  IV.P.3.

Finally, the Program is expressly governed by the FAA:

The Program, these procedures, and any arbitration award that may result from

them shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and, to the extent, if any, that

such Act is held not to apply, to the state law, including judicial interpretations,

applicable in the State of New York, provided that principles of conflicts of laws

shall not be applied.

Id. (VG.

III. The Instant Litigation
On or around April 20, 2010, plaintiff filed this action in the Southern District of New

York, alleging two causes of action based on Ernst & Young's alleged misclassification of her
and other similarly situated individuals under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") (29 U.S.C.
0x00A7 207) and New York Labor laws (12 N.Y.C.R.R. 0x00A7 142-2.2). Plaintiff did not attempt to resolve
her dispute through the Program before filing suit.

Neither party has served discovery nor filed any substantive motions.
Case 1:10-cv-03332-KMW -MHD Document 28 Filed 08/20/10 Page 10 of 18

ARGUMENT
I. Plaintiff's Claims Are Required To Be Arbitrated And Should Be Dismissed.

Plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed under the FAA because her claims are subject
to binding arbitration. See Buchman v. Weiss, Nos. 08 Civ. 5453 (RJS), 08 Civ. 5456 (RJS), 2009
WL 2044615, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2009) (granting motion to dismiss and compel
arbitration); Duraku v. Tishman Speyer Props., Inc., No. 09 Civ. 9351 (DLC), 2010 WL 2142581,
at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 2010). Under section 4 of the FAA, a party to an arbitration agreement
may petition a court for an order that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such
agreement. See 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 4.

The FAA provides for a stay of the proceedings pending arbitration; however, courts have
discretion to dismiss rather than stay an action where, as here, all of the claims in the complaint
must be submitted to arbitration, and have done so in this district where defendants have sought
dismissal. See 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3; Kowalewski v. Samandarov, 590 F. Supp. 2d 477, 490 (S.D.N_Y.
2008) (citations omitted). Here, plaintiff agreed to resolve her asserted claims solely through the
procedures set forth in the Program. She should be compelled to do so and her complaint should
be dismissed.

I. The FAA, And Federal Authority, Mandates Arbitration In This Case.

Federal courts have long recognized a "strong federal policy favoring arbitration as an
alternative means of dispute resolution." Oldroyd v. Elmira Sav. Bank, FSB, 134 F.3d 72, 76 (2d
Cir. 1998). In the Second Circuit, to determine whether to compel arbitration, the court must
resolve three issues: (1) whether the parties agreed to arbitrate; (2) whether the asserted claims
fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement; and (3) if federal statutory claims are at issue,
whether Congress intended those claims to be non-arbitrable. Jd. at 75-76; Arrigo v. Blue Fish

Commodities, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 7518 (VM), 2010 WL 391813, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2010)
