MEMORANDUM SUPPORTING MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendants Rapid Response Monitoring Services, Inc. and Russell MacDonnell, by and
through undersigned counsel and without waiving any objections to jurisdiction and venue,
submit this Memorandum in support of their Motion to Dismiss:
I.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Craig Cunningham has filed 43 pro se lawsuits in this district since 2012. Most of these

lawsuits are based upon alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act 1, the Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act 2, and/or the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 3,4 This present lawsuit
stems from alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). 5
Specifically, Mr. Cunningham alleges that an unidentified overseas entity conducting “safety
surveys” called him 28 times attempting to get him to take a safety survey, including 11 phone

15 U.S.C. §§ 1692 et seq.

15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.

Mr. Cunningham has also filed multiple lawsuits under these same statutes in the United States
District Court, Northern District Court for Texas. See Cunningham v. Advantage Cable Services,
Inc. et al., Case No. 3:08-cv-01536-K; Cunningham v. Advanta Corp. et al., 3:08-cv-01794-K;
Cunningham v. Credit Management LP et al., Case No. 3:09-cv-01497-G; Cunningham v.

calls made on June 27, 2015. 6 Mr. Cunningham ultimately took the “safety survey” on June 27,
2015 to “ascertain the identity of the party placing these unsolicited calls.” 7 Other than the June
27th phone call when Mr. Cunningham agreed to take the “safety survey” and the June 29th
phone call with Kathy/Alyssa (outlined in the paragraph below), Mr. Cunningham does not
provide clarification of the other alleged 26 phone calls. 8 There are no facts to determine
whether these were missed calls, for example, whether messages were left, or the content of any
messages. 9
On June 29, 2015, Mr. Cunningham received a call from “Kathy” with Safeguard
America informing him that he had been entered into a promotion as a result of taking the
“safety survey” and that he had been chosen to receive a GE wireless security system at no
charge. 10

According to Kathy, Mr. Cunningham would only be required to pay for the

monitoring of the system. 11 Kathy then transferred Mr. Cunningham to “Alyssa” who claimed to
be a promotional manager with Safeguard America. 12 According to Alyssa, Safeguard America
would install the GE security system, “and the monitoring was through a different company
called ‘Rapid Response.’” 13

Mr. Cunningham was also given a website address for the

company, which was www.gesafeguard.com. 14 Mr. Cunningham believes that this website is
operated by Homeland Security, LLC, which is alleged to be an authorized dealer of Safeguard

America. 15 Mr. Cunningham does not allege that Rapid Response Monitoring Services, Inc.
(“Rapid Response”) or Mr. MacDonnell initiated any of the alleged phone calls or spoke with
Mr. Cunningham at any time. 16
As it pertains to Rapid Response and Mr. MacDonnell, the Amended Complaint fails to
provide any facts to support the existence of liability, whether under the theory of direct liability
or vicarious liability. Further, there are no facts to support piercing the corporate veil to allow a
claim to proceed against Mr. MacDonnell. For these reasons, as set forth more fully herein, Mr.
Cunningham’s Amended Complaint should be dismissed.

And, as set forth below, these

Defendants have established that Mr. Cunningham filed this complaint against them in bad faith
and therefore attorney’s fees should be awarded for having defended this matter.
II.

STANDARD OF REVIEW 17
A motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure is reviewed under the standard that the Court must accept as true all of the allegations
contained in the complaint, resolve all doubts in the plaintiff's favor, and construe the complaint
liberally in favor of the pro se plaintiff. 18 However, although the complaint need not contain
detailed factual allegations, the plaintiff must provide the grounds for his entitlement to relief

15

The Standard of Review set forth in this Memorandum is the same as set forth in Cunningham
v. Kondaur Capital, No. 3:14-1574, 2014 WL 8335868, at *2-3 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 19, 2014)
report and recommendation approved, No. 3:14-CV-01574, 2015 WL 1412737 (M.D. Tenn.
Mar. 26, 2015).

See Kottmyer v. Maas, 436 F.3d 684 (6th Cir.2006); Boswell v. Mayer, 169 F.3d 384, 387 (6th
Cir.1999); Morgan v. Church's Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 11–12 (6th Cir.1987).

and this “requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of
a cause of action.” 19
The factual allegations supplied must be enough to show a plausible right to relief.20
More than bare assertions of legal conclusions are required to withstand a motion to dismiss and
the complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all of the material
elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory. 21 The Court need not accept as
true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences. 22 Although Rule 8 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure does not constitute a “hyper-technical, code-pleading regime,” it “does not
unlock the doors of discovery for a Plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.” 23 A
complaint does not “suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertions' devoid of ‘further factual
enhancement.’ ” 24

ARGUMENT

1.

Mr. Cunningham’s pro se status.
In Cunningham v. Kondaur Capital, this Court noted the following as it pertains to a

litigant’s pro se status and how specifically applied against Mr. Cunningham:
The plaintiff's status as a pro se litigant requires the Court to view his pleading
with some measure of a liberal construction. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519,
520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); Jourdan v. Jabe, 951 F.2d 108, 110
(6th Cir.1991). However, the “lenient treatment generally accorded to pro se
litigants has limits.” Pilgrim v. Littlefield, 92 F.3d 413, 416 (6th Cir.1996).

pleading essentials in pro se suits.” Wells v. Brown, 891 F.2d 591, 594 (6th
Cir.1989) (citing cases).
Additionally, the Court takes notice that the plaintiff, although proceeding pro se,
has filed no less than 11 other lawsuits in this District alone since 2012, alleging
claims under the TCPA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§
1692 et seq., and/or the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq. As
evidenced by his numerous lawsuits and by the substance of his filings, his instant
foray into litigation is significantly unlike the ordinary pro se plaintiff who makes
a one time appearance into the realm of unfamiliar legal proceedings. 25
2.

Mr. Cunningham’s Amended Complaint fails to establish sufficient facts to state a
claim under 47 U.S.C. § 227(b), i.e., that he received a phone call from an automatic
telephone dialing system or used an artificial or prerecorded voice.
“The essential allegations required to plead a claim under Section 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) are

simple: the plaintiff must allege that: 1) he received a text or phone call on a telephone number
assigned to a cellular telephone service, and 2) the text or phone call was made with an automatic
telephone dialing system or used an artificial or prerecorded voice.” 26 In the present case, Mr.
Cunningham alleges he received multiple phone calls to his cell phone, thus satisfying the first
element. 27 But, Mr. Cunningham fails to allege sufficient facts to establish the second element:
that the calls were placed with an automatic dialing system or used an artificial or prerecorded
voice. Again, the opinion in Cunningham v. Kondaur Capital provides guidance on this issue. 28
Specifically, in addressing Mr. Cunningham’s complaint in that case, this Court held:
As to the second element, the plaintiff's allegation consists of a minimal statement
that the text messages were of an “automated nature.” See Complaint, at 4. Even
though minimal allegations of the use of an automatic telephone dialing system
have been found sufficient to satisfy the Rule 12(b)(6) standards, see Peatrowsky
v. Persolve, 2014 WL 1215061, *4 (D.Nev. Mar.24, 2014); Robinson v. Midland
Funding, LLC, 2011 WL 1434919, *3 (S.D.Cal. Apr.13, 2011), the plaintiff's
allegation borders on being only a mere recitation of the required element.
However, the plaintiff's factual allegations about the text messages indicate
that the messages were repeated within a short span of time and consisted of

the same content. Id. at 2. These additional allegations are sufficient to bring his
complaint above the minimum level required to generally state a claim under the
TCPA. See Hickey v. Voxernet LLC, 887 F.Supp.2d 1125, 1130
(W.D.Wash.2012) (allegation regarding the generic content and automatic
generation of message is sufficient to infer the use of an automatic telephone
dialing system); Johansen v. Vivant, Inc., 2012 WL 6590551, *3 (N.D.Ill.Dec.18,
2012) (a description of telephone messages in laymen's terms or of the
circumstances surrounding the messages would satisfy basic pleading standards
for TCPA claims). But see Freidman v. Massage Envy Franchising, LCC, 2013
WL 3026641, *2 (S.D.Cal. June 13, 2013) (allegations that text messages were
generic and impersonal was not sufficient to allege that they were sent by use of
an automatic telephone dialing system). 29
In Kondaur, this Court found that the complaint barely set forth sufficient facts to push
the allegations past the fine line of merely reciting the necessary elements of the claim because
the text messages were sent in a short time span and consisted of the same content. 30 Similar
allegations are not present in this case. The Kondaur Court appeared to place great weight in the
fact that the content of the messages was the same in deciding the complaint satisfied the
requirements of Rule 8. The only allegations that could be relevant to the second element in this
action are that Mr. Cunningham received 11 phone calls on June 27th and a total of 28 phone
calls altogether. 31 There are no allegations of generic content or even of voice messages being
left for Mr. Cunningham. Without any further factual content, Mr. Cunningham’s Amended
Complaint fails to establish the necessary second element for a claim under 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)
and this claim should therefore be dismissed.
3.

The Amended Complaint is clear in that neither Rapid Response nor Mr.
MacDonnell initiated the alleged calls in the Amended Complaint; therefore, there
can be no claim of direct liability under the TCPA.

Mr. Cunningham brings claims under 47 U.S.C. § 227(b) and (c) against Rapid Response
and Mr. MacDonnell under the theories of direct and vicarious liability. 32 In a letter brief
adopted by the Eleventh Circuit (Sarris Letter Brief) 33, the FCC distinguished between calls and
faxes in the context of analyzing direct and vicarious liability under the TCPA. 34 In doing so,
the FCC makes clear that direct liability for phone calls is only available against the person that
initiates the call (the telemarketer), not the person “on whose behalf” the call is allegedly made. 35
The TCPA makes it unlawful, subject to certain exceptions, for any person within
the United States to “initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line
using an artificial or prerecorded voice … without the prior express consent of the
called party.” 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B). Such artificial or prerecorded voice calls
are commonly referred to as “robo-calls.” The statute also authorizes the FCC to
establish a national do-not-call registry that consumers can use to notify
telemarketers that they object to receiving telephone solicitations. 47 U.S.C. §
227(c)(1)-(4). The FCC’s implementing regulations provide – again, subject to
exceptions – that no person or entity may “initiate any telephone solicitation …
[to any] residential telephone subscriber who has registered his or her telephone
number on the national do-not-call registry.” 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(c)(2).
In identifying the party that “initiates” calls in violation of these robo-call and donot-call-registry prohibitions, the Commission’s rules distinguish between the
“telemarketer” and the “seller.” The Commission defines the “telemarketer” as
“the person or entity that initiates a telephone call or message for the purpose of
encouraging the purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or
services, which is transmitted to any person.” 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(f)(11)
(emphasis in original). By contrast, the “seller” is defined as “the person or entity
on whose behalf a telephone call or message is initiated for the purpose of
encouraging the purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or
services, which is transmitted to any person.” Id. § 64.1200(f)(9) (emphasis in
original). Thus, for example, in the DISH Network context, DISH was the seller
and its third-party telemarketers were the parties that initiated calls promoting
DISH’s satellite television services. 36
Ruling from the Sixth Circuit and this Court are consistent with the FCC’s interpretation
of the availability of direct liability in TCPA cases involving alleged robo-calls and violations of

the do-not-call-registry. Relying upon the Sixth Circuit’s opinion in Charvat v. EchoStar
Satellite, LLC, 630 F.3d 459, 468 (6th Cir.2010) and the FCC’s ruling in In re Dish Network,
LLC, 37 this Court recently held that direct liability under 47 U.S.C. § 227(b) and (c) applies only
to entities that initiate the phone calls. 38 Specifically, the FCC’s ruling makes clear that:
Our rules have long drawn a distinction between the telemarketer who initiates a
call and the seller on whose behalf a call is made. In accordance with those rules,
as we explain below, we clarify that a seller is not directly liable for a violation of
the TCPA unless it initiates a call, but may be held vicariously liable under
federal common law agency principles for a TCPA violation by a third-party
telemarketer. 39
In this case, the Amended Complaint makes clear that neither Rapid Response nor Mr.
MacDonnell initiated the calls. Specifically, Mr. Cunningham claims that he received calls from
an unknown overseas entity40 and from Security Systems, Inc. dba Safeguard America. 41 The
only allegation concerning Rapid Response is that it is referenced as the monitoring company for
the alarm system being offered to Mr. Cunningham. 42 There are no allegations concerning Mr.
MacDonnell’s involvement other than the following conclusory allegations:
27.

The officers of each and every listed corporation had direct, personal conduct in
authorizing the telephone calls or oversaw and directed the telemarketing efforts
for which their corporations benefitted. The officers set company policy and
directed the marketing efforts of the respective companies.

Similarly, the calls were placed with apparent authority, actual authority, and the
ratification of Rapid Response, UTC, Homeland Security, and Security Systems

Disregarding for the moment the unsupported nature of these conclusory allegations, these
allegations do not allege that Rapid Response or Mr. MacDonnell initiated the calls. Therefore,
based upon the FCC’s interpretations of the TCPA and this Circuit’s precedent, Rapid Response
and Mr. MacDonnell cannot be held directly liable. Therefore, any claims based upon direct
liability should be dismissed. The more appropriate theory under which Mr. Cunningham’s
claims should be analyzed is under vicarious liability, which is addressed below.
4.

The Amended Complaint fails to set forth sufficient facts to support a claim of
vicarious liability.
Once again, the Kondaur case provides guidance on whether a complaint sufficiently

alleges facts to establish vicarious liability in a TCPA case.
The plaintiff's allegations as to the vicarious liability of Defendant Kondaur,
however, are insufficient to state such a claim. The FCC’s declaratory ruling in In
re Dish Network, LLC supports use of the theory of vicarious liability for a claim
of TCPA violations under agency principles, including formal agency, apparent
authority, and ratification. See 28 FCC Rcd. at 6584, ¶ 28. As the FCC has stated:
The classical definition of “agency” contemplates “the fiduciary
relationship that arises when one person (a ‘principal’) manifests
assent to another person (an ‘agent’) that the agent shall act on the
principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control .” Potential
liability under general agency-related principles extends beyond
classical agency, however. A principal may be liable in
circumstances where a third party has apparent (if not actual)
authority. Such “[a]pparent authority holds a principal accountable
for the results of third-party beliefs about an actor's authority to act
as an agent when the belief is reasonable and is traceable to a
manifestation of the principal.” Other principles of agency law
may support liability in particular cases. For example, a seller may
be liable for the acts of another under traditional agency principles
if it ratifies those acts by knowingly accepting their benefits. Such
ratification may occur “through conduct justifiable only on the
assumption that the person consents to be bound by the act's legal
consequences.”

Id. at 6586–87, ¶ 34.
However, the mere possibility that a defendant may be vicariously liable is not
sufficient to state a claim for relief, and pleading facts that are merely consistent
with liability is not enough. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. There must sufficient factual
allegations pled to support a plausible claim against the defendant based upon
those facts. Id. The plaintiff's Complaint simply does not contain such facts. There
are no factual allegations that Defendant Kondaur itself had any interaction with
the plaintiff, and the plaintiff alleges only that he spoke with entities identified as
the 800 Resources Group and Park View Law. Further, although the plaintiff
alleges that he was told by these entities that they were “prospecting for leads” for
Kondaur and that information would be forwarded to Kondaur “for the purposes
of obtaining a mortgage,” there are no factual allegations showing that these
entities were in fact acting at the directive of or on behalf of Kondaur. There are
also no factual allegations that the plaintiff was transferred to Kondaur during the
telephone calls, that Kondaur subsequently contacted the plaintiff in any manner
as a result of the telephone calls, or any other allegations from which it could
reasonably be inferred that Kondaur was provided information about the plaintiff
from the 800 Resources Group and Park View Law or that Kondaur was a de
facto participant in the telephone calls.
A formal agency relationship arises when “one person (a ‘principal’) manifests
assent to another person (an ‘agent’) that the agent shall act on the principal's
behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or
otherwise consents so to act.” See Restatement (Third) Agency § 1.01 (2006).
There are no factual allegations showing that Defendant Kondaur had any control
over the 800 Resources Group and Park View Law or had given them actual
authority to act on its behalf. “Apparent authority holds a principal accountable
for the results of third-party beliefs about an actor's authority to act as an agent
when the belief is reasonable and is traceable to a manifestation of the principal.”
See Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03. Apparent authority is based upon some
act by the principal that creates the appearance that it has granted authority to a
purported agent. See Central States S.E. and S.W. Areas Pension Fund v. Kraftco,
Inc., 799 F.2d 1098, 1113 (6th Cir.1986) (en banc ). There are no facts alleged
that Defendant Kondaur itself took any actions as a principal that would have
caused the plaintiff to believe that the 800 Resources Group and Park View Law
had apparent authority to act on Kondaur's behalf. Finally, there are no allegations
showing that Defendant Kondaur ratified the actions of the 800 Resources Group
and Park View Law or accepted the benefits of their actions in any manner.
Ratification is the affirmance of a prior act done by another, whereby the act is
given effect as if done by an agent acting with actual authority.” See Restatement
(Third) of Agency § 4.01(1).
Even though the plaintiff's factual allegations are construed as true when
reviewing the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must “do more than create
speculation or suspicion of a legally cognizable cause of action; [he] must show
entitlement to relief.” League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Bredesen, 500 F.3d

Case 3:15-cv-00846 Document 23 Filed 10/08/15 Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 98

523, 527 (6th Cir.2007) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). While the plaintiff
argues that Defendant Kondaur should be held vicariously liable based upon its
purported involvement in the texts he received and/or because of the plaintiff's
belief that Kondaur was the intended beneficiary of any information gleaned from
his return telephone calls, the plaintiff's actual allegations against Defendant
Kondaur are based upon unsupported speculation and are not sufficient to show
the existence of facts that would support vicarious liability. See Smith v. State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2014 WL 3906923, *7–9 (N.D.Ill. Aug.11, 2014)
(plaintiff's allegations were not sufficient to plead a plausible basis for vicarious
liability); Freidman, 2013 WL 3026641, at *3. The motion to dismiss should be
granted. 44
Applying the reasoning set forth supra to the present case mandates the same conclusion:
Mr. Cunningham’s Amended Complaint fails to set forth sufficient facts to establish vicarious
liability. There are no factual allegations showing that Defendants Rapid Response and/or Mr.
MacDonnell had any control over Safeguard America (or any other entity that initiated the calls)
or had given them actual authority to act on their behalf. Therefore, the Amended Complaint
fails to establish actual authority. There are no facts alleged that Defendants Rapid Response
and/or Mr. MacDonnell themselves took any actions as a principal that would have caused Mr.
Cunningham to believe that Safeguard America (or any other entity that initiated the calls) had
apparent authority to act on their behalf.

Finally, there are no allegations showing that

Defendants Rapid Response and/or Mr. MacDonnell ratified the actions of Safeguard America
(or any other entity that initiated the calls) or accepted the benefits of their actions in any
manner. Stated simply, there are no facts in the Amended Complaint that are sufficient to unlock
the doors of discovery and allow this case to proceed against these Defendants on a vicarious
liability theory of recovery. Therefore, all claims against these Defendants under the TCPA
should be dismissed.

The Amended Complaint fails to set forth any facts that would support piercing the
corporate veil, which is required to establish liability against Mr. MacDonnell.

Mr. MacDonnell is the CEO for Rapid Response. In Tennessee, “a corporate director,
officer or employee, if acting within the scope of their authority for the interests of the
corporation should not be held liable because their action is treated as that of the corporation.”

“corporation’s separate identity may be disregarded or ‘pierced’ ... upon a showing that it is a
sham or a dummy or where necessary to accomplish justice.” Oceanics Sch., Inc. v. Barbpour,
112 S.W.3d 134, 140 (Tenn.Ct.App.2003). “When piercing the corporate veil, a court may
disregard the corporate entity in order to impose liability against a related entity, such as ... a
controlling shareholder, where the two entities are in fact identical or indistinguishable[.]”
Pamperin v. Streamline Mfg., Inc., 276 S.W.3d 428, 438 (Tenn.Ct.App.2008).
Mr. Cunningham’s Amended Complaint lists no facts that would survive Rule 8
requirement that a pleading contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleader is entitled to relief[.]” Without more, Mr. Cunningham’s claim against Mr. MacDonnell
should be dismissed.
6.

Mr. Cunningham’s initiation of this action against Rapid Response and Mr.
MacDonnell is in bad faith and, as such, they should be awarded their attorney’s
fees for having to defend this baseless lawsuit.
Finally, Rapid Response and Mr. MacDonnell request that they be awarded reasonable

attorney fees because Mr. Cunningham filed this case in bad faith. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(a)(3).
Under § 1692k(a)(3), a defendant must affirmatively show the plaintiff acted in bad faith and for
purposes of harassment. Perry v. Stewart Title Co., 756 F.2d 1197, 1211 (5th Cir. 1985). Such
proof exists in this case.
Initially, Mr. MacDonnell was sued solely because he is the CEO of Rapid Response.
There is not a single factual allegation listed in the Complaint that shows Mr. MacDonnell took

any actions, or failed to act, in any way that caused harm to Mr. Cunningham. Further, Rapid
Response is only in this lawsuit because Mr. Cunningham elicited the name of the monitoring
company from “Alyssa” with Safeguard, apparently in an attempt to bring more parties into the
lawsuit. 45 Specifically, at the 00:14:04 mark in the audio file made an exhibit to this Motion to
Dismiss, Mr. Cunningham asks Alyssa, “I was just wondering, for the monitoring service, who is
that through? Is it ADT, or…?”46 Alyssa responds by saying, “Oh no, no, no. We are a
different company than ADT. Our monitoring station is Rapid Response.” 47

She follows by

saying “We are Safeguard America, we do install a GE security system in your home. And the
monitoring station is out of Rapid Response and they have an A+ rating with the BBB.” 48 This
type of baiting by Mr. Cunningham should not be overlooked. Therefore, Defendants request
that this Court award reasonable attorney fees be awarded to them for having to defend this
claim.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth herein, Mr. Cunningham’s Amended Complaint against Rapid

Response and Mr. MacDonnell should be dismissed.

Respectfully submitted,

Attached as Exhibit B to the Motion to Dismiss is the audio recording provided by Mr.
Cunningham. Although a Rule 12 Motion is based on the pleadings, review of this audio file is
appropriate in considering whether Mr. Cunningham’s conduct was in bad faith.
