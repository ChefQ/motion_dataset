Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to the Defendants' Motions to dismiss
subject to the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to amend and Motion for a stay
pending discovery on Personal Jurisdiction
1. The Plaintiff's in this case hereby files this opposition to the Defendants'

motions to dismiss subject to the Plaintiffs Motion for a stay and Motion
for leave to amend his complaint.
General Objections -_.

2. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to stay these motions to dismiss pending
discovery on the issues of personal jurisdiction which all the defendants
have alleged. The Plaintiff should be allowed an opportunity to conduct
discovery on this issue and has produced an affidavit in support of this.

3. The Plaintiff personally knew the agent of Safeguard America that came to
install the alarm system in question. The Plaintiff had this agent of
Safeguard America do work for him in the past installing electronic strike
locks as well as a magnetic lock and access keypad. The Plaintiff knows
this person to be a Tennessee resident and knows that the individual was
hired by Security Systems, Inc., dba Safeguard America and was

workingon behalf of Safeguard America and Rapid Response Inc and

Homeland Security, Inc to install Alarm Systems sold in the State of
Tennessee to Tennessee residents. Hiring Tennessee residents to install
your products/services is sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.

4. Additionally, the Plaintiff has evidence he was called by agents of
Homeland Security, Rapid Response, and Safeguard America, and courts
have held that a single phone call into the forum state is sufficient to
establish liability under a TCPA claim.

5. The Plaintiff should be allowed to conduct discovery on these personal
jurisdiction issues in this case.

6. The Plaintiff has also filed a motion for leave to amend which addresses
the alleged deficiencies with the Plaintiffs complaint and would otherwise
render the motions to dismiss moot. The motions to dismiss should be
denied on this point alone.

Rapid Response Monitoring Services, Inc., and Russell MacDonnell's

Motion to Dismiss

7. The Plaintiff opposes the Motion to dismiss by Rapid Response and
Russell MacDonnell for the following reasons:

The Plaintiff CAN establish he was called using an automated telephone
dialing system.

8. In the Plaintiffs most recent complaint attached to his motion for leave to
amend, the Plaintiff has clearly alleged additional facts and elements
regarding the calls in question. The Plaintiff has stated the time, dates,

calling number and recieved number, and additional analysis as to how

2.

Case 3:15-cv-00846 Document 49 Filed 01/11/16 Page 2 of 25 PagelD #: 210

 

 
   

the Plaintiff ascertained that the calls were initiated by an automated
telephone dialing system, for example the rapid fire nature of the calls
being placed, some within 1 or 2 seconds of each other: "Additionally,
many of the calls were placed literally 1 or 2 seconds apart is not humanly
possible and can only be done via a computer, for example on June 19,
calls were recieved at 23:21:23 and again one second later at 23:21:24 or
on June 18, calls were recieved at 23:08:26 and again at 23:08:28, two
seconds lIater. It is beyond the realm of human capabilities to place calls to
the same number and is characteristic of an automated telephone dialing
system to have rapid fire calls placed in less time that it takes to manually
dial the number."

9. The Plaintiff isn't required to go into extreme detail and minutae regarding
every possible detail regarding each and every phone call, particularly in
the absence of discovery and at the initial pleading stage, but all of the
calls were missed and no voicemails were left except for the last call the
Plaintiff answered on June 27" 2015. The Plaintiff has the calls recorded
and phone records are available to support any and all elements the
Defendants may want to examine. This sort of nit picking can all be
resolved with a simple discovery request, which the Plaintiff is happy to
substantively and fully respond to.

The Plaintiff need not allege the calls were directly placed to him by
Defendants Russell MacDonnell and Rapid Response to establish

liability against these defendants.

10.As stated in the Plaintiffs pending motion for leave and amended
complaint, the Plaintiff isn't required to allege direct liability or that the
defendants MacDonnel and Rapid Response individually placed the calls.
Courts in the 6" circuit have held that authorizing illegal faxes or telephone
calls and paying for those illegal advertisements is sufficient to establish
liability. In this case, the Defendants authorized and paid for the
advertisement to be faxed to thousands of recipients. As the senders, they

are responsible for these faxes. see Jackson Five Star Catering, Inc. v. John R.

Beason and Tax Connection Worldwide, LLC, No. 10-10010, 2013 WL 5966340 (E.D. Mich.

Nov. 8, 2013)

11.As a party in line to directly benefit and profit from the sale of alarm
services, they would naturally be vicariously liable for the calls which
advertise their services for which they would directly profit.

12. Dismissal is improper at this stage even without direct liability for these
parties as the Plaintiff can establish vicarious liability for these parties in
accordance with the FCC's declaration in the Dish network case and as
the defendants have conceded.

The Plaintiff's has established the facts and elements sufficient to allege
vicarious liability in his most recent amended complaint pending before
the court as an attachment to the Motion for leave to amend.

13.In the Plaintiffs most recent motion for leave to amend, the Plaintiff
expands in great detail and alleges sufficient facts to establish allegations

supporting vicarious liability against Russell MacDonnel and Rapid

Response under the theories of actual authority, apparent authority, and
ratification.

14. The Plaintiff alleges the existance of a contractual relationship between
Rapid Response and Safeguard America, which counsel for the.
defendants has confirmed does exist, and that this contract establishes
actual authority that Safeguard America is acting on behalf of Rapid
Response in procuring leads and customers for alarm monitoring services.

15. Furthermore, the recording provided by the defendants in their motion is
further proof of the involvement of Rapid Response and Defendant
MacDonnell in this case as the agent confirm that the monitoring services
will be provided by Rapid Response and the Plaintiff would be making
payments to Rapid Response. Alternatively, one need look no further than
the website of Defendant Safeguard America, www.safeguard.com, where
they state "We are an authorized GE Security Pro Dealer and offer our
customers 24/7/365 monitoring by Rapid Response Monitoring with on the
go and cellular communicator capabilities through Alarm.com."

16. The Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish vicarious liability under
the doctrine of Apparent Authority. Pursuant to the elements established
by the FCC for a court to consider when evaluating an allegation of
Apparent authority, the Plaintiff has properly stated a claim for vicarious
liability in his motion for leave to amend and amended complaint.

17. According to the FCC, there are several examples of evidence that might -

be relevant in a finding of apparent authority: 1. Access to detailed

5

. information regarding the nature and pricing of the seller's products and
services 2. the ability by the outside sales entity to enter consumer
information into the seller's sales or customer systems 3. the authority to
use the seller's trade name, trademark, and service mark, and 4. that the
seller approved, wrote or reviewed the outside sales entity's telemarketing
scripts and 5. if the seller knew or should have known that the
telemarketer was violating the TCPA on the seller's behalf and the seller
failed to take effective steps within its power to force the telemarketer to
stop. ' The FCC recommends using a totality of the circumstances

approach to a finding of apparent authority.

18. The Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish a showing of vicarious

liability under the doctrine of ratification by alleging that Rapid Response is
knowingly accepting the benefits of the illegal actions of Homeland
Security and Safeguard America by accepting the customers generated by

the complained of telephone calls.

19.In summary, the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish a claim on

the grounds of vicarious liability against the defendants Rapid Response
and Russell MacDonnell.

Rapid Response and Defendant Russell MacDonnell should be held
vicarious liable as any other finding would undermine the deterrent

effect and purpose of the TCPA.

20. As noted in Jackson v Caribbean Cruise Line, 2:2014-cv-02485,

21.

document 83 (2015) "a number of courts have considered whether a
defendant my nonetheless be held vicariously liable under the TCPA in
accordance with traditional tort principles. The overwhelming majority have
answered that question in the affirmative." additionally, the court held that
"Some courts have looked to th purpose of the TCPA and found that to
hold otherwise, that is to decline to recognize potential vicarious liability
under the statute would undermine its deterrent effect. See Bank, No. 12-
cv-584, at 18-18 ECF No. 49 ("If a company were allowed to avoid TCPA
liability by merely hiring a different company to make unlawful calls, the
statute would lose its deterrent effect. Vicarious liability prevents this
liability maneuvering') and cited "Birchmeier v Caribbean Cruise Line, Inc.,
No. 12 C 4069 (MFK), 2012 WL 7062748, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Dec 31, 2012)
(`To offer an example, suppose that A, a well heeled entity wants to sell a
product or service, stands next to B, an impecunious defendant, and
directs B to place unsolicited, prerecorded calls to consumers on their cell
phones. Defendants' position, it appears, is that only B, th impecunious
dialer, would be liable, and that A would get off scot-free. A Congressional
enactment that permitted this would be absurd indeed. Fortunately that is
not the law under the TCPA ")

Under this rationale, doing anything other than holding Safeguard

America, Homeland Security, and Rapid Response as vicariously liable for

the actions of the distributors hired to place illegal telemarketing calls on

behalf of the defendants., would lead to an absurd result allowing the
defendants to get off scot-free, undermine the deterrent effect of the
-TCPA, and run counter to the overwhelming majority of courts that have

reviewed similar TCPA decisions. |

The Plaintiff need not pierce the corporate veil to impute liability to Mr.

MacDonnell as a corporate officer.

22.Multiple courts going back several years, including courts in the 6 Circuit

have held that it is not necessary to pierce the corporate veil ina TCPA

action to hold a corporate officer liable for violations of the law. Although the

Sixth Circuit has not ruled on this issue, many courts have held that corporate actors can be
individually liable for violating the TCPA "where they `had direct, personal participation in or
personally authorized the conduct found to have violated the statute.'" Van Sweden Jewelers, Inc.
v. 101 VI, Inc., No. 1:10-cv-253, 2012 WL 4074620 (WD. Mich.) (quoting Texas v. Am. Blastfax,
164 F, Supp. 2d 892, 898 (W.D. Tex. 2001); see also, e.g., Maryland v. Universal Elections, 787 F:

Supp. 2d 408, 415-16 (D. Md. 2011)?

23.In the Plaintiffs motion for leave and amended complaint, the Plaintiff cites
5th Circuit COA precedent in a TCPA case where the court held: In Texas
v American BlastFax, Inc., the 5 Circuit COA held "However, if the officer
directly participated in or authorized the statutory violation, even though
acting on behalf of the corporation, he may be personally liable", citing US
v Pollution Serv. of Oswego, Inc., 763 F.2d 133, 134-35 (2 Cir 1985)
additionally, the court held "The "well-settled" tort rule provides that "when

corporate officers directly participate in or authorize the commission of a

wrongful act, even if the act is done on behalf of the corporation, they may
be personally liable."

24. Additionally, courts in the 6" circuit have ruled directly on the issue and
found corporate officers can be liable in a TCPA case without piercing the
corporate veil: "The Defendants do not dispute that Beason personally
participated in the payment of and authorization for the fax ads. As a
result, he is personally liable for the violation of the TCPA"

25. The Plaintiff alleges direct participation on the part of Russell MacDonnel
in this case and as such he should be held liable for his actions. Nothing
more is required with a TCPA claim, and thus piercing the corporate veil is
irrelevant.

The defendant's claims that the case was filed in bad faith is laughably
absurd and unsupported by any authority, particularly given the creative
"baiting" claim.

26. In a strange twist, the Defendants attempt to argue that the Plaitiff brought
this case in bad faith under the FDCPA standard, which is 15 USC
1692k(a)(3), even though this case has nothing at all to do with illegal debt
collection actions and no violations of the FDCPA are alleged.

| 27.A defendant claiming bad faith "must show the Plaintiff's conscious doing
of a wrong because of a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity' See Shah v
Collecto, Inc., No. Civ A. 2004-4059, 2005, WL 2216242 at 14 (D. Md.

Sept 12, 2005) (Quoting Black's Law dictionary, 139 (6" ed. 1990))

 

Jackson Five Star Catering, Inc. v. John R. Beason and Tax Connection Worldwide, LLC,
No. 10-10010, 2013 WL 5966340 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 8, 2013)

28.A bad faith Lawsuit is one "where the suit is so completely without hope of |

succeeding that the court can infer the plaintiff brought the suit to
_harass...rather than to obtain a favorable judgment see Grant v. Barro,

No. 07-194-JJB-DLD, 2007 WL3244986, at *1 (M.D. La. Nov. 1, 2007)

29. The gaping hole in this entire "baiting" argument is that the during this

conversation with Alyssa of Safeguard America, at least 28 other violating
. Calls had previous to the so called "baiting" call, on June 27" 2015. How
can someone presumably be baited into violating the law in the past? The
28 offending calls initially occured on June 17%, 18%, 19th, 26, and 27" of
which the Plaintiff answered none and spoke to nobody, except the last
call on June 27* all in 2015 during with the Plaintiff allegedly "baited" the
defendants, violated every law of physics by reversing time, and tricked

the defendants into calling him for the prior 10 days apparently.

30. At the point of this conversation, on June 29" 2015, the die was cast, the

goose was cooked, and liability of Rapid Response was already
established as Rapid Response and Russell MacDonnell were
beneficiaries of the illegal telemarketing calls. One could presumably
make the argument that they were induced or baited into calling if the

Plaintiff took some action before the calls took place, which resulted in

 

calls occuring such as giving consent to be called, but it is illogical to
retroactively claim you were baited into placing illegal telemarketing calls

in a conversation that took place after the initial violating calls took place.
