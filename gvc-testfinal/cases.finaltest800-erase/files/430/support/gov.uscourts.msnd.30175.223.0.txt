Motion to Stay of the Cleveland School District

Defendant Cleveland School District (“the District”) moves the Court to stay its Order of
May 13, 2016, pending a ruling on the District’s proposed consolidation plan, or in the
alternative, for a stay pending appeal.
1.

On May 13, 2016, this Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order adopting

the plan proposed by the Government for consolidation of the District’s middle schools and high
schools. Under the Government’s plan, the District would assign all ninth through twelfth-grade
students to Cleveland High School and Margaret Green as a single consolidated high school, and
assign all sixth- through eighth-grade students—except the sixth-grade students at Bell and
Hayes Cooper—to the current East Side High School, creating a consolidated middle school.
2.

After the Court’s order was entered, the Cleveland School Board voted to submit

its own consolidation plan to the Court. The District’s plan proposes sending all sixth-grade
students—except those at Hayes Cooper or Bell—to a renovated Walter Robinson Achievement
Center (WRAC). All seventh through twelfth-grade students will attend Cleveland High School
and Margaret Green Junior High School, with the addition of a new ninth-grade wing designed to

accommodate the increased numbers there. East Side High School and D.M. Smith Middle
School will be closed. See, [221], [222].
3.

As of June 1, 2016, white students comprised 28.5% of the District’s total

enrollment. The District is concerned the Government’s consolidation plan will cause white
students to leave the District, thereby reducing opportunities for meaningful diversity and
continued desegregation. In fact, white student departure is already increasing as a result of the
Court’s adoption of the Government’s plan as set out in the District’s Memorandum in support
motion to stay. The primary aim of the District’s proposed consolidation plan, therefore, is to
decrease the likelihood of white student departure. School districts are entitled to deference in
devising and implementing constitutional desegregation methods, and case law expressly allows
this Court to consider student enrollment loss when choosing among constitutional plans.
4.

Staying execution of this Court’s order will prevent unnecessary expenditures of

resources and preserve opportunities for increasing integrated enrollment while the Court makes
its final decision on the District’s plan.
5.

In the alternative, the District has filed an appeal of this Court’s May 13, 2016

Order. Although the District plans to dismiss its appeal if this Court accepts its consolidation
plan, a stay pending appeal is necessary if the Court rejects the District’s proposed plan. As
described in the District’s accompanying Memorandum, a stay pending appeal will prevent
irreparable injury without harming the Plaintiffs or the public.
For the foregoing reasons and those set out in its Memorandum in support of motion to
stay, the District respectfully requests this Court grant a stay pending its resolution of the
District’s consolidation plan, or in the alternative, grant a stay pending appeal.
