GOVERNMENT=S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
CARAMADRE=S MOTION TO SEVER
The United States of America, by and through its undersigned
attorneys, hereby opposes Defendant Joseph Caramadre=s Motion to
Sever.

Because the harm Caramadre identifies is speculative and

fails to meet the heavy burden required for severance, the motion
should be denied.
BACKGROUND
Defendants Joseph Caramadre and Raymour Radhakrishnan are
charged in a sixty-six count indictment with wire fraud, mail fraud,
conspiracy, identity fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money
laundering.

Caramadre is also charged with one count of witness

tampering.

Trial is scheduled to begin in November 2012 and expected

to last three to four months, with approximately seventy-five to one

hundred witnesses.
In May 2012, Radhakrishnan moved for a severance, based on
antagonistic defenses and prejudicial spillover effect.

On July 25,

2012, the Court denied Radhakrishnan’s Motion to Sever.

See Opinion

and Order, ECF No. 69. On August 2, 2012, Radhakrishnan filed a notice
of Intent to Proceed Pro Se.

ECF No. 73.

The Court subsequently

conducted a Faretta hearing and determined that Radhakrishnan’s
decision to proceed pro se was knowing, willing and voluntary.
Caramadre now moves to sever, based on prejudice he anticipates will
result from Radhakrishnan’s pro se performance.

For the reasons set

forth below, the Motion to Sever should be denied.
Caramadre’s Motion also requested the Court provide
Radhakrishnan with additional warnings regarding his conduct during
the trial.

(Caramadre’s Motion to Sever at 5-6).

The government

has no objection to the Court administering such additional warnings
to Radhakrishnan, or to reminding Radhakrishnan that he has no
obligation to continue representing himself pro se and may reconsider
that decision and return to being represented by counsel.
LAW
There is a strong presumption in favor of joint trials in the
federal system.

Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993).

The rule in the First Circuit is that “when multiple defendants are
named in a single indictment, a defendant who seeks a separate trial
2

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 81 Filed 09/07/12 Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 1120

can ordinarily succeed in obtaining one only by making a strong
showing of evident prejudice.

The hurdle is intentionally high.”

United States v. Pena-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 39 (1st Cir. 2000).
Prejudice in this context means “more than just a better chance of
acquittal at a separate trial.” United States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d
36, 52 (1st Cir. 2001).

To overcome the presumption in favor of joint

trial, a defendant must demonstrate “prejudice so pervasive that it
would be likely to effect a miscarriage of justice.”

United States

v. Sotomayor-Vazquez, 249 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2001).
ARGUMENT
Caramadre’s severance motion should be denied because it is
entirely speculative.

The current purpose of Caramadre’s motion is

apparently to preserve the abuse of discretion standard on appeal.
(Caramadre’ Motion to Sever at 3-4).

Caramadre acknowledges, as he

must, that the mere fact a co-defendant is proceeding pro se is not
a basis for a severance.
(1st Cir. 1994).

United States v. DiMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1313

Otherwise, co-defendants could manipulate the law

of joinder simply by one defendant proceeding pro se.

A defendant

must also show strong prejudice which resulted from the pro se
representation, identifying specific instances which occurred
before the jury.

Id.

Caramadre makes no showing of evident prejudice.

Caramadre

points to warnings the Court gave to Radhakrishnan during the course
3

of the Faretta hearing, then speculates that the Court has concluded
“that Radhakrishnan will make some serious mistakes that will
adversely affect a fair trial in this matter.”
to Sever at 3).

(Caramadre’s Motion

This interpretation overstates the import of the

Court’s warnings to Radhakrishnan.

Radhakrishnan may well make

mistakes which are contrary to his interest; it does necessarily not
follow that the fairness of the trial or Caramadre’s interest will
be affected such that severance is required.

The Supreme Court has

held that “Rule 14 does not require severance even if prejudice is
shown; rather, it leaves the tailoring of the relief to be granted,
if any, to the district court’s sound discretion.”
at 538-539.

Zafiro, 506 U.S.

It is for this reason that Caramadre concedes that his

motion to sever “is due to be denied because it anticipates
developments at trial.”

(Caramadre’s Motion to Sever at 4).

Accordingly, the Motion to Sever should be denied.
Notwithstanding the above, the government has no objection to
the Court administering the additional warnings to Radhakrishnan
suggested by Caramadre.

Radhakrishnan should be given every

opportunity to reconsider his decision to proceed pro se.
