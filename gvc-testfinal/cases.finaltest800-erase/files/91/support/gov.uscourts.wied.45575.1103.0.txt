DEFENDANTS’1 MOTION AND MEMORANDUM SEEKING CLARIFICATION
UNDER RULE 60(a) REGARDING THE COURT’S MARCH 1, 2011 DECISION AND
ORDER CONCERNING NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE COSTS
In the Court’s February 28 , 2011 Decision and Order (the “February 2011 Decision”),
the Court concluded, based on the equities, “that Defendants are entitled to full contribution from
the Plaintiffs for OU2-OU5 cleanup costs.” Dkt. 1080, at 19. When the Court discussed
Defendants’ claims for prospective relief to address natural resource damages (“NRDs”) at the
Lower Fox River and Green Bay Site (“the Site”), however, the Court stated that:
Plaintiffs also raise a specific objection in arguing that the Defendants are not
entitled to obtain natural resource assessment costs and damages because they
lack standing. The Defendants have not responded to this argument, and in fact
they made a similar argument in seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs’ own claims.
Because private parties lack standing to seek natural resource damages, the
motion will be denied to the extent it seeks such damages.
Id. at 28.

This motion is filed by WTM I Company and joined by Defendants CBC Coating Inc., the City of
Appleton, Neenah-Menasha Sewerage Commission, P.H. Glatfelter Company, Menasha Corporation and
U.S. Paper Mills Corp. These parties are collectively referenced herein as “Defendants.”

QB\12919352.2

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 03/29/11 Page 1 of 7 Document 1103

Defendants seek clarification of the February 2011 Decision in light of the Court’s
August 20, 2008 Decision and Order (the “August 2008 Decision”) regarding recovery of NRD
payments. In the August 2008 Decision, the Court ruled that while the Plaintiffs lacked standing
under CERCLA2 Section 107, overpayments of NRDs are recoverable under CERCLA Section
113. It is our understanding, based on the Court's above-quoted statement in the February 2011
Decision, that the Court meant to refer to the lack of standing under CERCLA Section 107.
There is no dispute that private parties lack standing to bring claims for NRDs under CERCLA
Section 107.3
Here, Defendants are not seeking recovery of damages for injuries to their own natural
resources under Section 107. Instead what they are seeking is recovery of overpayments they
have made to federal, state or tribal Trustees for NRDs under CERCLA Section 113. Those
overpayments are what this Court ruled are recoverable under CERCLA Section 113, in its
August 2008 Decision, and the overpayments are the basis upon which Defendants seek recovery
for NRDs here, along with declaratory relief under CERCLA Section 113(g)(2)(B).
I.

Defendants’ NRD Costs Are Recoverable under Section 113 as this Court has
Already Ruled.

In its August 2008 Decision, the Court correctly ruled that Plaintiffs cannot maintain a
CERCLA Section 107(a) claim, and, more specifically, that Plaintiffs cannot maintain a
CERCLA Section 107(a) claim for NRDs:
As discussed above, Plaintiffs’ overpayments [for NRDs], if any, are
recoverable under§ 113(a), and they therefore have no claim under § 107(a).
Even aside from this, however, Plaintiffs have not cited any authority suggesting
that private parties can use § 107(a) to recover for natural resources damages,
regardless of whether a § 113(f) contribution claim is available or not. Based on
2

The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq.
("CERCLA").
3
In the briefing underlying the Court's August 2008 decision, Defendants argued that "[p]rivate plaintiffs, like NCR
and API, may not assert claims to recover natural resource damages under section 107(a)(1-4)(C)." Dkt. 58 at 5.

2
QB\12919352.2

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 03/29/11 Page 2 of 7 Document 1103

the authority cited by the moving parties, I conclude that they cannot.
Accordingly, that portion of Count I seeking recovery of natural resources
damages [under Section 107] will be dismissed for this reason as well.
Dkt. 227 at 15 (emphasis added). The Court carefully explained that NCR and API are not
entitled to maintain a CERCLA Section 107 claim and concluded:
In sum, the costs at issue here were incurred by the Plaintiffs in an effort to
discharge the liability they claim to hold in common with the Defendants.
Plaintiffs allege that they paid more than their proportionate share of such liability
and thus are entitled to recover the excess they paid from those Defendants who
have failed to pay their proportionate share. This is a claim for contribution
specifically authorized under § 113(f). Since any excess payments made by
Plaintiffs are recoverable, if at all, under that section, they have no need to resort
to § 107(a). Count One will therefore be dismissed.
Id. at 14-15. Thus, in the August 2008 Decision, the Court held that NRD costs paid by a party
over and above its equitable share are recoverable in contribution under CERCLA Section 113,
but not Section 107(a).
In their briefs underlying the February 2011 Decision, Defendants admittedly spent little
discussion on the recoverability of NRDs under CERCLA Section 113 because Defendants
believed the question had already been decided by the Court in the August 2008 Decision.
Several of Defendants’ briefs relied on the August 2008 Decision for the proposition that NRD
overpayments are recoverable by private parties under CERCLA Section 113, even though
private parties lack standing to bring claims for NRDs under CERCLA Section 107. See Dkt.
878 at 25-26; Dkt. 894 at 11-12. As to declaratory relief, the Defendants referenced CERCLA
Section 113(g), providing in relevant part: "In any such action described in this subsection, the
court shall enter a declaratory judgment on liability for response costs or damages that will be
binding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further response costs or damages." Dkt.
915 at 22 (emphasis added).

QB\12919352.2

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 03/29/11 Page 3 of 7 Document 1103

While Plaintiffs themselves have asked this Court to “determine the parties’ proper
allocable shares with respect to Lower Fox River Costs and damages,”

Dkt. 265 ¶ 177

(emphasis added), they opposed Defendants' motion for declaratory relief stating that "private
parties lack standing to bring an action for NRDs," citing this Court's August 2008 Decision.
Yet Plaintiffs' citation to the August 2008 Decision is to the very page at which the Court
decided that although Plaintiffs have no claim under CERCLA Section 107 because of a lack of
standing, their overpayments (if any) to natural resource trustees are recoverable under CERCLA
Section 113. The Court's August 2008 Decision was correct, 4 and granting Defendants the relief
they have requested on NRD payments is consistent with the Court's August 2008 Decision on
NRD payments and the February 2011 Decision on cleanup costs.

4

The Court's August 2008 Decision -- that costs incurred to assess or otherwise address NRDs, like cleanup costs,
are subject to contribution under CERCLA Section 113 -- is consistent with the holdings of other courts. See Amoco
Oil v. Dingwell, 690 F. Supp. 78, 85 (D. Me. 1988) (having settled government claims for response costs and natural
resource damages, the plaintiffs had a legal and factual basis for a contribution claim under CERCLA); cf Champion
Laboratories, Inc. v. Metex Corp., No. 02-5284, 2008 WL 1808309 (D.N.J. April 21, 2008) (deciding, on motion to
dismiss, that plaintiff could bring claim for contribution under CERCLA Section 113(f)(3)(B) for plaintiff's prior
settlement of CERCLA NRDs with state government). Indeed, the NRDs at the Site arise from the same releases of
PCBs as the cleanup costs.

CONCLUSION
In the Court's August 2008 Decision, the Court ruled that overpayments of NRDs are
recoverable under CERCLA Section 113. Defendants respectfully ask that the Court clarify that
the relief granted by the Court in its February 2011 Decision includes recovery on Defendants’
CERCLA Section 113 claims for their overpayments of NRDs, and a declaration that the
Plaintiffs are liable to Defendants not only for costs of cleanup but also for any NRDs paid to the
federal, state or tribal Trustees.
