IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
GREEN BAY DIVISION
APPLETON PAPERS INC. and
NCR CORPORATION,
Plaintiffs,
Case No. 08-CV-00016-WCG
v.
GEORGE A. WHITING PAPER
COMPANY, et al.,
Defendants.
______________________________________________________________________________
DEFENDANTS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION SEEKING CLARIFICATION
______________________________________________________________________________
Defendants respectfully request that the Court clarify that the relief granted in its
February 2011 Decision includes recovery on Defendants’ CERCLA Section 113 claims for their
overpayments of natural resource damages (“NRDs”) and a declaration that the Plaintiffs are
liable to Defendants not only for cleanup costs, but also for any NRD payments to the Trustees.
Notwithstanding NCR’s and API’s own prior contribution claims for NRDs against the
Defendants,1 NCR now contends that “CERCLA’s plain language does not provide an equitable
right to contribution for natural resources damages payments.” Dkt. 1125 at 8. It further argues
that even if there were contribution claims for NRD overpayments, the Defendants must show
that the Plaintiffs’ releases of PCBs “caused the specific injury,” id. at 3,2 and then speculates
that certain defenses to NRD liability might apply, id. at 9 - 10.

1

In its Seventh Amended Complaint and Motion for Summary Judgment, NCR and API both asserted CERCLA
Section 113 contribution claims for NRDs. Dkt. #265 [Seventh Amended Complaint]; Dkt. #576 [API/NCR Motion
for Summary Judgment on Phase I]. The award of contribution against them has obviously altered their view.
2
In a similar vein, API argues there is no need for declaratory relief as to future NRD overpayments because, in its
view, each defendant may only be held liable for NRDs actually caused by its release. Dkt. 1124 at 3 – 4.

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 1 of 18 Document 1130

None of these contentions has any merit. As explained below, it is clear under the terms
of the statute that private parties do have a right to recover through Section 113 any NRD
overpayments they have made to governmental trustees, as this Court concluded in its August
2008 Decision (“Plaintiffs’ overpayments, if any, are recoverable under Section 113(a)[sic] ...”).
Dkt. 227 at 15. If CERCLA’s NRD liability scheme did not provide contribution rights, it would
run counter to the common law, most statutory tort law, and ordinary notions of fairness by
precluding parties that share a common liability from readjusting those payments among
themselves, so that the liability is shared fairly. There is no reason to believe that Congress set
up such an idiosyncratic structure based on either the statute itself or its underlying policies.
Plaintiffs’ arguments on the law of causation likewise are not supported by the statutory
language or the cases interpreting the statute’s causation requirements for triggering NRD
liability. This Court has already found that the “Plaintiffs’ own pollution caused a significant
part of the environmental damage” (Dkt. 1080 at 14), and that, based on comparative fault, the
Plaintiffs should bear the entire liability for remediating OU2-5.
NCR contends that this Court’s February 2011 opinion only can be read to hold that
contribution for NRDs is never available under Section 113 or any other law. (API does not
make this argument.) Defendants obviously disagree with that reading. But the ambiguity
evident from the parties’ briefs suggests that the Court should clarify.
I.

THE FEDERAL RULES ENTITLE DEFENDANTS TO SEEK CLARIFICATION.
A.

Rule 60(a) is Appropriate Here.

Before fully addressing the merits, we first respond to NCR’s procedural objections to
this motion. Defendants sought clarification under Rule 60(a) because, unlike the Court’s
August 2008 Decision (Dkt. 227), its February 2011 Decision (Dkt. 1080) spoke only to the lack
of “standing” of private parties, like Defendants, to recover NRDs; and lack of standing is a
2
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 2 of 18 Document 1130

CERCLA Section 107 issue. This Court’s August 2008 Decision dismissing Plaintiffs’ Section
107 claims concluded that NRD overpayments could be recovered under CERCLA Section 113.
Dkt. 227 at 15. However, that conclusion was not addressed or referenced in the 2011 Decision.
Defendants thus believe and understand that the Court’s August 2008 ruling - that a
party’s “overpayments” of NRDS are recoverable under Section 113 - remains intact. They
simply seek clarification that this is, in fact, the case given that NRDs are a component of the
damages that the Court has ruled the Plaintiffs should bear based on fault. As the Court stated:
“With respect to OU2-5, Plaintiffs’ own pollution caused a significant part of the environmental
damage, and requiring them to foot the entire bill is an equitable result under the circumstances
of this case.” Dkt. 1080 at 14.
The Court’s award to Georgia-Pacific of its NRD payments under its Section 113
counterclaim reinforced the Defendants’ understanding that NRDs were to be included in the
“bill” that Plaintiffs should bear.3 Because the Court’s February 2011 Decision had awarded
Georgia-Pacific its past NRD payments, the remaining Defendants believed Rule 60(a) to be the
appropriate mechanism for clarification of any potential ambiguity or oversight in the Court’s
February 2011 Decision as it pertained to the their respective parallel counterclaims seeking

3

Georgia-Pacific submitted a past cost claim totaling slightly more than $83 million. Dkt. 1080 at 19. That $83
million claim included Georgia-Pacific’s prior NRD payments of approximately $13.1 million. See Georgia-Pacific
LLC’s and Certain Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Equitable Factors, Dkt. 893 at 3 Par. C.3
(seeking “[a]ll amounts that Georgia-Pacific has incurred to assess natural resource damages (NRDs) or on account
of natural resource damages for the Lower Fox River and Green Bay Site. Georgia-Pacific has settled its potential
NRD liabilities with federal, state and tribal trustees through a combination of cash payments and environmental
restoration projects valued at $13,126,370.62.”) The February 2011 Decision granted Georgia-Pacific’s motion for
summary judgment on all of its claimed costs other than for $2.7 million in costs and damages to which the
Plaintiffs had raised factual disputes. Dkt. 1080 at 25-26.

recovery under Section 113 of their NRD overpayments.4 Plaintiffs disagree with Defendants’
interpretation of the Court’s decision, so there is a need for clarification.
Courts have often used Rule 60(a) to clarify potential ambiguities arising from mistake or
inadvertence. See, e.g., Burton v. Johnson, 975 F.2d 690, 694 (10th Cir. 1992); see also Panama
Processes, S.A. v. Cities Service Co., 789 F.2d 991, 993 (2nd Cir. 1986). Burton involved an
ambiguous district court order that “the Petitioner be released unless a new trial is commenced
within 90 days.” Id. The Tenth Circuit acknowledged that the district court’s decision was
ambiguous because it was subject to two separate interpretations. It went on to hold that a
district court is “permitted to invoke Rule 60(a) to resolve an ambiguity in its original order to
more clearly reflect its contemporaneous intent and ensure that the court’s purpose is fully
implemented.” Burton, 975 F.2d at 694 (emphasis added).
Here, as in Burton, there are two possible interpretations of the Court’s February 2011
Decision as it relates to NRDs: (1) that under CERCLA Section 113, consistent with the August
2008 and February 2011 rulings, the Plaintiffs should “foot the entire bill” for the environmental
damages arising from the PCB contamination, including NRDs, or (2) that NRD overpayments,
whether sought under Section 107 or Section 113, are not recoverable at all. As even NCR
acknowledges, Rule 60(a) is properly invoked if the “error” in the decision “was by pure
inadvertence.” Dkt. 1125 at 6 (citing Lowe v. McGraw-Hill Cos., Inc., 361 F.3d 335, 341 (7th
Cir. 2004)).
Any supposed or arguable uncertainty as to the proper interpretation of the Court’s
decision on the NRD issues is correctable under Rule 60(a).

Defendants were advised by Georgia-Pacific when the motion was filed that it did not join this motion because the
Court had awarded its Section 113 NRD claim for its prior NRD payments it had made pursuant to its judiciallyapproved consent decree.

B.

If the Motion Does Not Fall Under Rule 60(a), the Court Can Consider It
Under Rule 54(b) or Pursuant to Its Inherent Power to Reconsider
Interlocutory Orders.

If there is any doubt as to whether Rule 60(a) has been properly invoked, the motion is
unquestionably authorized under both Rule 54(b) and the Court’s inherent power to reconsider
interlocutory orders. Under Rule 54(b) “any order . . . which adjudicates fewer than all the
claims . . . is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the
claims and the rights and liabilities of all parties.” It is also well established that a district court
has the inherent power to reconsider interlocutory orders before entry of final judgment.

(E.D. Wis. Aug. 29, 2006).
Regardless of its label, it is the substance of the motion that matters:
In short, motions are to be analyzed according to their terms. When
the substance and label of a post-judgment motion . . . are not in
accord, district courts should evaluate it “based on the reasons
expressed by the movant.” Neither the timing of the motion, nor its
label . . .
is dispositive with respect to the appropriate
characterization of the motion.

850, 855 n.4 (10th Cir. 2005) (internal citations omitted); see also Bayer Healthcare, LLC v.
Norbrook Labs, Ltd., No. 08-C-953, 2011 WL 1113366, *1 (E.D. Wis. Mar. 24, 2011) (a motion
for reconsideration that failed to even mention the rule under which it was filed could properly
be construed as a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.)
Thus this Court has ample authority to clarify its rulings on NRDs.
II.

OVERPAYMENTS OF NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES ARE
RECOVERABLE IN CONTRIBUTION UNDER CERCLA.
As demonstrated in the following discussion, while Defendants do not have standing to

assert Section 107(a) NRD claims, they may recover their NRD overpayments from Plaintiffs
5
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 5 of 18 Document 1130

through Section 113 contribution actions. Consistent with this Court’s rulings that Plaintiffs are
liable for all of the response costs flowing from the environmental harm they unleashed,
Plaintiffs are liable for all past and future natural resource damages arising from that harm.
A.

CERCLA Section 113 Provides Private Parties Contribution Claims Against
Others to Recover NRD Overpayments to Trustees.

NCR’s legal argument is that – because Section 113(f)(1) mentions response costs but not
damages – there is no contribution claim by private parties for NRD overpayments to
governmental trustees. But that contention wrongly overlooks the critical, first sentence of
Section 113(f)(1):
Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is
liable or potentially liable under 9607(a) of this title [that is,
CERCLA Section 107(a)] . . . .
42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(1). This provision could not be more straightforward: parties such as the
Defendants may seek contribution for any liabilities arising under Section 107(a). This key first
sentence does not limit the contribution rights under Section 113(f) to claims involving Section
107(a)(1-4)(B) -- the subsection that addresses response costs. 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a)(14)(B). Instead contribution rights apply more broadly to liability “under 9607(a).” Liability for
NRDs, in turn, arises "under 9607(a)" (also referred to as CERCLA Section 107(a)). 42 U.S.C. §
9607(a)(1-4)(C). The fact that a subsequent sentence mentions only response costs does not
foreclose what the first sentence unambiguously allows.
Furthermore, NCR’s argument ignores the provisions of CERCLA Section 113(g)(3),
which provides:
No action for contribution for any response costs or damages may be
commenced more than 3 years after -(A) the date of judgment in any action under this chapter for
recovery of such costs or damages, or
(B) the date of an administrative order under section 9622(g) of
this title (relating to de minimis settlements) or 9622(h) of this title
6
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 6 of 18 Document 1130

(relating to cost recovery settlements) or entry of a judicially
approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.
(Emphasis added.) ( “[D]amages” means “damages for injury or loss of natural resources as set
forth in section [107](a). . . .” CERCLA Section 101(6).) There would be no need for a Section
113 NRD statute of limitations if Section 113(f)(1) did not allow such a claim. NCR’s proposed
interpretation of Section 113(f)(1) would write the word “damages” out of Section 113(g)(3)
altogether, which is contrary to CERCLA’s express provisions, and would violate the rules of
statutory construction prohibiting any interpretation that does not give meaning to all of a
statute’s terms. See, e.g., TRW, Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (“It is a ‘cardinal
principle of statutory construction’ that ‘a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that,
if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant’”)
(citations omitted).
The federal agencies that implement CERCLA also understand that Section 113 allows
NRD contribution claims. For example, EPA has stated:
Sections 113(g)(3)-(4) provide exceptions for the Section 113(g)(1) limitation
period on actions involving contribution and subrogation. Section 113(g)(3)
provides that no action for contribution of NRD may be commenced more than
three years after: (1) the date of judgment for recovery of NRD; or (2) the date of
an administrative or court order for a de minimis or cost recovery settlement.
(http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/nrd/statute.htm)
Similarly, trustees routinely settle NRD claims against private parties via standard
consent decrees that provide contribution protection for the settling party against further NRD
liability from third parties. For example, Georgia-Pacific’s Fox River NRD consent decree with
the Department of Interior (“DOI”) and other trustees provides:
The Parties agree, and by entering this Consent Decree this Court finds, that the
Settling Defendant is entitled, as of the effective date of this Consent Decree, to
protection from contribution actions or claims as provided by Section

7
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 7 of 18 Document 1130

113(f)(2) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2), or any other applicable law, for
“matters addressed” in this Consent Decree. The “matters addressed” in this
Consent Decree are Covered Response Costs and Natural Resource Damages.
Dkt. #900 [Declaration of Paul Montney in Support of GP’s Motion for Summary Judgment] Ex.
N [2002 NRD Consent Decree] at ¶ 23 (emphasis added). Again, there would be no need to
extend such protection if NRD contribution claims did not exist in the first place. As the
agencies generally entrusted with CERCLA enforcement, the EPA and DOI interpretation of the
statute is entitled to deference. See, e.g., Chevron v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837
(1984).
Numerous courts have approved NRD consent decrees with contribution protection
provisions, such as those found in the Georgia-Pacific Fox River NRD settlement that was
approved by this Court. See, inter alia, United States v. Fort James Operating Company, 313 F.
Supp. 2d 902 (E.D. Wis. 2004) (quoted above); In re Acushnet River & New Bedford Harbor,
712 F. Supp 1019 (D. Mass. 1989) (rejecting non-settlors’ objections to NRD Consent Decree
that included a contribution protection provision); United States v. Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transport. Auth., 235 F.3d 817, 821-22 (3d Cir. 2000) (approving Consent Decree that provided
contribution protection for response costs and natural resource damages); United States v.
Keystone Sanitation Co., No. 1:CV-93-1482, 1999 WL 33597863, *4 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 10, 1999)
(rejecting non-settling PRPs’ objection to Consent Decree that “the inclusion of natural resource
damages for which contribution protection is afforded is unfair to non-settlors.”)5
Stated differently, the case law recognizes that parties who share a “common liability”
under CERCLA are subject to contribution claims under Section 113. United States v. Atlantic
5

NCR minimizes the two cases cited in our initial brief – Amoco Oil v. Dingwell, 690 F. Supp. 78, 85 (D. Me.
1988), and Champion Labs., Inc. v. Metex Corp., 2008 WL 1808309 (D.N.J. April 21, 2008). But both cases
support the legal proposition that NRDs can be awarded under Section 113. That neither case was at the stage where
the facts had been sufficiently developed for an actual award of NRDs is of no moment. Here the facts have been
developed.

8
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 8 of 18 Document 1130

Research Corp., 551 U.S. 128, 138-139 (2007). In Atlantic Research, the Supreme Court stated
that “contribution,” as used in Section 113(f), should be given its traditional meaning, “the
‘tortfeasor’s right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid
more than his fair share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.’” Id. (quoting
from Black’s Law Dictionary 353, 8th Edition). “Thus, Section 113(f)(1) permits suit before or
after the establishment of common liability.” Id.
In this respect, CERCLA’s NRD liability scheme is no different from typical tort
liability. Under common law, the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act, or the
Uniform Comparative Fault Act, a defendant that discharges a common liability by satisfying the
plaintiff’s claim may pursue contribution against other persons that share that common liability.
See Restatement (Third) of Torts §23 (2000); Unif. Comparative Fault Act § 4 (1977); Unif.
Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act §1 (1955). Anything else would be radically unfair, and
Congress did not intend such an unfair result.6
B.

Defendants Properly Brought Their NRD Contribution Claims For
Overpayments Under Section 113(f), Since Only Designated Governmental
Trustees May Bring Section 107(a) Natural Resource Damage Claims.

The Defendants do not dispute that they lack standing to bring a claim for natural
resource damages under CERCLA Section 107. CERCLA Sections 107(a)(1-4)(C) make
specified parties liable for “damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources . . .
resulting from . . . a release.” “Damages” is defined to mean “damages for injury or loss of
natural resources as set forth in section [107](a) or [111](b) of this title.” Section 101(6)
(emphasis added). Section 101(16) of CERCLA defines “natural resources” to mean:

6

In defining CERCLA contribution rights, Congress also addressed fairness to non-settlors by providing that a
party's settlement with the government “reduces the potential liability of the others [meaning non-settlors] by the
amount of the settlement.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2).

9
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 9 of 18 Document 1130

Land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, and
such other resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to,
or otherwise controlled by the United States . . . any State or local government,
any foreign government, any Indian tribe . . . .
(Emphasis added.) Only injuries to public or tribal resources are subject to NRD claims under
Section 107(a), and private parties are not entitled to recover for public resource injuries.
Section 107(f)(1) expressly states that:
In the case of injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources under
subparagraph (C) of subsection (a)[(4)] of this section [107] liability shall be to
the United States Government and to any State for natural resources within the
State or belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such State
and to any Indian tribe for natural resources belonging to, managed by,
controlled by, or appertaining to such tribe, or held in trust for the benefit of such
tribe . . . .
(Emphasis added.) In short, private parties do not have standing to assert NRD claims under
Section 107(a), but may bring claims for NRD overpayments under Section 113. That is exactly
what the Court decided in August 2008 when it dismissed Plaintiffs’107(a) NRD claims. Dkt.
277 at 15.
C.

Plaintiffs’ Causation Arguments Are Unavailing.

Plaintiffs’ arguments that Defendants have not satisfied “a prima facie” case of causation
ignores CERCLA precedent and this Court’s prior rulings. Dkt. 1125 at 9-10; Dkt. 1124 at 3-4.
NCR argues that the “resulting from” language in CERCLA Section 107(a) requires the
Defendants to establish that “releases from a defendant’s facility caused the specific injury to the
natural resources in question.” Dkt. 1125 at 3 (emphasis in original). None of the cases cited by
NCR say this, nor to our knowledge has any court ever so held, because that is not what Section
107(a) provides. At the outset, the pages cited by NCR in Coeur D’Alene Tribe v. Asarco, Inc.,
280 F. Supp. 2d 1094 (D. Idaho 2003), merely recite and compare the statutory elements of both
a response costs claim and a claim for NRDs, which are remarkably similar. Id. at 1102-03.

10
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 10 of 18 Document 1130

Nowhere does the court say that the elements for an NRD claim include that: (a) the specific
injury, (b) be solely caused by or result from, (c) releases from a defendant’s facility.
While it is certainly true that Section 107(a)(C) requires the demonstration of a causal
relationship between a release and the damages, see, e.g. Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland
Dairy Farms, Inc., 889 F. 2d 1146, 1154 fn.7 (2d Cir. 1989), NCR and API have overstated the
legal requirement for causation. NCR conveniently overlooks what the court in Coeur D’Alene
Tribe did say about causation. That court was faced with a case analogous to the Fox River –
one in which multiple sources released the same hazardous substances which became
commingled. The court decided causation did not require “the Trustees to fingerprint which
release caused what harm . . . ,” id. at 1120, but only required proof that a party’s release was a
“contributing factor” to the damages. Id. at 1124.
API’s reference to 2 RCRA and Superfund: A Practice Guide (3rd ed. 2010) § 14:138,
also conveniently omits that a variety of courts have adopted the “contributing factor” test for
NRD liability. Id. at 14-291, 292. Another case cited by Plaintiffs, Idaho v. Bunker Hill, 635 F.
Supp. 665, 674 (D. Idaho 1986), stands for nothing more than the proposition that there be “a
causal link” between the damage and the release, not that the damage be solely caused by a
defendant’s release. Finally, Dedham Water Company v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 889
F.2d 1146, 1154 n.7 (2d Cir. 1989), simply noted that the difference between an NRD claim and
a response costs claim is that in the former, “there must be a connection between the defendant
and the damages to the natural resources; in the latter there must be a connection between the
defendant and the response costs . . . .” (emphasis added).
Here, there is no question that the evidence, as found by this Court regarding the
Plaintiffs’ releases of PCBs and the resulting environmental damage, meets the causation

11
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 11 of 18 Document 1130

standard for imposing NRD liability. There is clearly “a causal link” or “a connection” between
Plaintiffs’ releases of PCBs into OU2-5 and their “creating the hazardous condition” which is the
basis for NRD liability. Dkt. 1080 at 17. As a consequence, Plaintiffs share a common liability
with Defendants for any injuries to natural resources in OU2-5 caused by their releases, which
then are subject to Section 113 claims.
Further, based on the Plaintiffs’ relative fault as compared to the Defendants, the
Plaintiffs have been found 100% responsible for the response costs arising from common
liability in OU2 - 5. Likewise, the allocation of NRDs arising from common liability in OU2-5
should be based on a determination of fault. See Atlantic Research, 551 U.S. at 138-39; see also
Morrison Enterprises v. Davos Corporation, No. 10-1468, 2011 WL 1237526, *5, *8-*9 (8th
Cir. Apr. 5, 2011).
Under a comparative fault standard, the Plaintiffs should foot the entire bill for the
environmental damages resulting from all PCB releases into OU2-5. This is because, as this
Court has already found and concluded,”[the Defendants] do not share any of the culpability for
the PCB pollution that gave rise to this CERCLA action.” Dkt. 1080 at 17. Given this Court’s
prior rulings on culpability, there is no logical or factual reason to treat the allocation of
Defendants’ Section 113 claims for NRDs any differently than their Section 113 claims for
response costs.
Finally, Defendants will demonstrate at trial that NCR and API have arranger liability for
the PCB discharges arising from the disposal of NCR broke at the Defendants’ recycling plants.
Therefore, in the event that any NRD payments ever specifically pertain to natural resource
injuries in OU1, Plaintiffs will share a “common liability” for such payments which they should

fairly bear.7
D.

Plaintiffs Point to No Facts in Support of Their Speculation that NRD
Statutory Defenses Might Apply.

NCR tosses in the contention that NRD claims contain a distinct set of statutory defenses.
Dkt. 1125 at 9-10. Neither Plaintiff resisted summary judgment on this basis before. In
responding to Defendants’ motions they pointed to no evidence establishing a material factual
dispute on any potential defense, and they point to none now. Their conjecture is not a
sufficient basis to avoid summary judgment. Wilson v. TecStar Mfg. Co., No. 04-CV-233, 2007
WL 201051, *4-*5 (E.D. Wis. Jan 23, 2007) (citing O’Neal v. City of Chicago, 392 F.3d 909,
912 (7th Cir. 2004); see also Magarian v. Hawkins, 321 F.3d 235, 240 (1st Cir. 2003)
(“‘Conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation’ are insufficient
to defeat summary judgment.”) (quoting LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 842
(1st Cir. 1993)).
There is nothing to clarify as to defenses.
III.

THE DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO A DECLARATION THAT
PLAINTIFFS ARE LIABLE IN CONTRIBUTION FOR NRD OVERPAYMENTS.
Under CERCLA Section 113(g)(2) or the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201,

Defendants are entitled to a declaration that Plaintiffs are liable to Defendants for any natural
resource damages they pay to the Trustees. Defendants have shown that Plaintiffs are 100%
liable to Defendants in contribution for natural resource damages in OU2-5 that the Defendants
have already paid to the Trustees. This court should also enter a declaration that Plaintiffs are
100% liable to Defendants in contribution for any natural resource damages in OU2-5 that the
Defendants pay to the Trustees in the future.

7

Were the Court to conclude that Plaintiffs have arranger liability, it would be an independent basis, in addition to
Plaintiffs’ liability arising from their discharges of PCBs into OU2, for holding them liable for the NRDs in OU2-5.

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/09/11 Page 13 of 18 Document 1130

While it is true that Glatfelter and Menasha Corp. took the position on a motion to
dismiss early on in this case that a declaratory judgment was not available to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs
opposed that motion and they prevailed, the Court ruling that a declaration could be awarded.
Dkt. 227 at 17.8

Plaintiffs won the point of law at the motion to dismiss stage, but want to take

up the losing side now. Defendants seek to apply the winning position on the point of law
decided in 2008.
API contends that there is no need for a declaration of Plaintiffs’ liability for future NRD
overpayments because the Defendants have paid no NRDs, that Defendants have an “ulterior”
motive, and that a declaration would serve no purpose. In fact, WTM and Glatfelter have paid
NRDs to the Trustees. Those NRD payments, contrary to the Plaintiffs’ statement, were not
specific to OU1 natural resource injuries. The OU1 Consent Decree was a vehicle for the United
States to require an "NRD Commitment," meaning partial payments for the Trustees' past
expenditures and future restoration work at the Site as a whole. See Dkt. 889-6 [Amended OU1
Consent Decree] at ¶¶48, 49, 52(a)(ii), and 53. To the extent the Plaintiffs put forth evidence
that specific NRD payments were due to injuries assessed by the Trustees specifically in OU1,
WTM and Glatfelter should be able to recover by either showing that those NRD payments were
not, in fact, specific to OU1 natural resource injuries,9 or by prevailing on arranger liability.
Furthermore, payment of NRDs or response costs is not a prerequisite for obtaining
declaratory relief as to liability for NRDs and response costs. See City of Gary v. Shafer, 683 F.
Supp. 2d 836, 861-862 (N.D. Ind. 2010) (defendant/counterclaimant that was liable under §

8

In its order, the Court chastened Menasha: “Strangely, one of the principal cases Menasha cites on this point holds
just the opposite. In Boeing Co. v. Cascade Corp., the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s apportionment of
liability for future cleanup expenses and rejected the defendant’s claim that the district court lacked authority to
issue a declaratory judgment under § 113.” Dkt. 227 at 17.

Portions of the FRG costs claimed by WTM and Glatfelter are for OU2-5 NRD payments, pursuant to the 1997
Agreement Between the State of Wisconsin and Certain Companies Concerning the Fox River.

107(a) but that had not yet paid any response costs was granted declaratory judgment for § 113(f)
contribution against plaintiff because future allocation dispute between the parties satisfied the
case or controversy requirement of the Declaratory Judgment Act); United States v. Davis, 31 F.
Supp. 2d 45, 59 (D. R.I. 1998) (contribution plaintiff was granted declaratory judgment against
parties that were liable to plaintiff under § 113(f) because “apportionment of liability among the
litigants presents a real and substantial controversy between parties having adverse interests that
satisfies the requirements of the Declaratory Judgment Act”).
Finally, API’s accusations about Defendants’ “ulterior purpose” are nonsensical. Like a
declaration for future response costs, a declaration as to the liability for any NRDs paid in the
future will remove the uncertainty the parties have been facing since 1994 regarding their NRD
liability. The declaration will result in the Plaintiffs bearing the full responsibility for the
environmental damages they unleashed. It is not a result the Plaintiffs agree with, but it is
neither unfair nor a “ruse.” And were any Defendant ultimately to reach a final settlement with
the Trustees on NRDs, as Georgia-Pacific has, that settlement would be subject to the judicial
Consent Decree approval process.
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants request that their motion be granted.
