IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
GREEN BAY DIVISION
APPLETON PAPERS INC. and
NCR CORPORATION,
Plaintiffs,
v.

No. 08-CV-16-WCG

GEORGE A. WHITING PAPER COMPANY, et al.,
Defendants.
PLAINTIFF APPLETON PAPERS INC.’S RESPONSE TO CERTAIN
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE
COURT’S MARCH 1, 2011 DECISION AND ORDER CONCERNING NATURAL
RESOURCE DAMAGES

Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. (“API”), by its undersigned attorneys, respectfully
submits this Memorandum in response to Certain Defendants’ Motion and Memorandum
Seeking Clarification Under Rule 60(a) Regarding The Court’s March 1, 2011 Decision
and Order Concerning Natural Resource Damage Costs. Dkt. #1103.
INTRODUCTION
Certain Defendants have asked the Court to clarify that portion of its March 1,
2011 Decision (“Decision”) holding that Defendants lack standing to seek contribution
for natural resource damages (“NRDs”) from Plaintiffs. Dkt. #1080, Decision, p. 28.
They ask the Court to affirmatively state that “overpayments” of NRDs may be recovered
under CERCLA § 113(f). Dkt. #1103, p. 5. As demonstrated below, granting the
requested clarification will not advance resolution of the pending summary judgment
motions. Instead, the requested clarification is designed to elicit a ruling from the Court
that will allow the Movants to settle their NRD claims and then turn around and seek to

recover their settlement from Plaintiffs. The Court should decline to be a party to this
ruse.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE
NONE OF THE MOVANTS HAVE INCURRED NRDs THAT ARE
PRESENTLY SUBJECT TO RECOVERY UNDER § 113(f).
Of the seven Defendants who bring the motion for clarification, five of them have

not incurred, and have not sought recovery of, past NRDs. See Dkt. #905 (CBC’s Motion
for Summary Judgment); Dkt. #892 (City of Appleton’s Motion for Summary Judgment);
Dkt. #881 (NMSC’s Motion for Summary Judgment); Dkt. #915 (Menasha’s Motion for
Summary Judgment); Dkt. #858 (US Paper’s Motion for Summary Judgment). Since
these Defendants have no current contribution claims for NRDs, the clarification they
seek will not serve to resolve any issue presently before the Court. Having paid no
NRDs, a ruling regarding the right to recover overpayments of NRDs would be entirely
academic.
As for the two Movants that claim to have incurred NRDs for which they seek
contribution (WTM and Glatfelter), those NRD payments were paid solely as damages in
OU-1. Dkt. #878 (Glatfelter’s and WTM’s Motion for Summary Judgment), pp. 15-16.
As the Court’s Decision makes clear, Plaintiffs are not liable under § 113(f) for any costs
or damages incurred in connection with OU-1 unless they are found to have arranger
liability following a trial (now scheduled for February 2012).

Dkt. #1080, p. 12.

Therefore, issuing a “clarification” now will serve no purpose, and the issue will become
entirely moot if the Court ultimately rules that Plaintiffs have no arranger liability.
Therefore, like the other Movants, Glatfelter and WTM have no legitimate purpose for
seeking “clarification” at this time.

II.

CLARIFICATION OF MOVANTS’ RIGHT TO RECOVER NRDs THAT
MAY BE ASSESSED IN THE FUTURE WOULD SERVE NO PURPOSE.
Nor is there any need for the Court to clarify whether Movants may be entitled to

recover “overpayments” of NRDs for which they are adjudged liable in the future. First,
Movants themselves previously have argued that it would be improper for the Court to
enter a declaration as to the right to recover future NRDs and costs. Menasha argued, for
example, that “Section 113 does not allow a declaratory judgment for the recovery of
costs or NRD.” Dkt. #64, p. 10 (Menasha’s Memorandum In Support of Its Motion To
Dismiss).

Likewise, Glatfelter previously asserted that “Plaintiffs cannot sue for a

declaratory judgment allocating responsibility for costs no one has yet incurred.”
Dkt. #58 at 24 of 26. Movants do not explain the reason for their changed position.
Second, if a judgment for NRDs is entered against any of the Movants in the
future, that judgment will be based upon the natural resource damages for which that
Movant was shown to be causally responsible. Under settled law, a party is liable under
CERCLA only for NRDs shown to be causally related to that party’s actions. See, e.g.,
State of Idaho v. Bunker Hill Co., 635 F. Supp. 665, 676 (D. Idaho 1986) (to recover
NRDs, “the damage for which recovery is sought must still be causally linked to the act
of the defendant.”); United States v. Mottolo, No. 83-547-B, 1992 WL 67473 at *7
(D.N.H. Dec. 17, 1992) (to recover NRDs, the government is “obligated to . . . connect
the injuries to defendants’ CERCLA liability.”). See generally 2 RCRA and Superfund:
A Practice Guide (3rd ed) § 14.138:
Contrary to all other sections involving CERCLA liability, [natural resource]
trustees are required to make a showing of causation when prosecuting a claim
for natural resource damages. The statutory basis for this rest in the language of
§ 107(a)(4)(C), which provides that a defendant is liable for natural resource
damages “resulting from a release.”

-3Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/22/11 Page 3 of 5 Document 1124

Thus, there will be no “overpayments” if judgments for NRDs are entered against
the Movants in the future: any such judgment will reflect only the natural resource
damage caused by and attributable solely to that Movant. Therefore, again, the ruling
Movants are now seeking will serve no purpose as to NRDs that may be assessed in the
future.
III.

MOVANTS SEEK THE CLARIFICATION FOR REASONS UNRELATED
TO THE PENDING MOTIONS.
For the reasons set forth above, the clarification Movants seek will in no way

advance resolution of issues presently before the Court. Instead, Movants seek the ruling
for an ulterior, unstated purpose.

They seek the ruling so they might negotiate a

settlement of NRDs with the Government with the comfort of a declaration by this Court
in their back pocket allowing them to recover from Plaintiffs whatever amount they agree
to pay in settlement. The Court should not allow itself to be used in this way. The Court
should decline to issue what amounts to an advisory opinion on an issue for which a
ruling by the Court is not presently needed.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, API respectfully requests that the Court deny the
relief sought by Defendants in their Motion for Clarification.
Dated this 22nd day of April, 2011.
Respectfully Submitted,
