DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DEFER CONSIDERATION
OF PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEYS' FEE MOTIONS PENDING APPEAL

On January 18, 2006, plaintiff filed two motions with the Court seeking attorneys'
fees and costs in this action. Plaintiff's first motion seeks an award of statutory attorneys' fees
and costs pursuant to ERISA 0x00A7 502(g), 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1132(g). (Docket no. 131). Plaintiff's
second motion seeks the Court's approval of "reasonable compensation" to plaintiffs counsel,
equal to thirty-two percent of the plaintiff class's anticipated recovery, in addition to
reimbursement of litigation costs and an incentive payment to class representative John D. West.
(Docket no. 132).

Defendants hereby move the Court to enter final judgment in the case prior to
ruling on plaintiff's fee motions and to defer consideration of the fee motions until defendants'
appeal of the merits of the case has been decided. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)
permits a district court to defer ruling on a motion for fees, or to deny a fee motion without

prejudice, pending appellate review of the underlying judgment upon which the fee petition is
Case 1:02-cv-00001-SSB-TSB Document135 ~~ Filed 02/03/2006 Page 2of8&

based. Here, deferral of plaintiffs fee motions will expedite the conclusion of the merits
litigation and promote judicial economy by avoiding duplicative and potentially unnecessary
consideration of attorneys' fee issues. For these reasons, the Court should exercise its discretion
to defer consideration of the fee motions until the conclusion of the merits appeal.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
I. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) Permits District Courts to Defer

Consideration of Attorneys' Fee Motions Pending Appellate Review of J udgment on
the Merits.

Unless directed otherwise by the court, a fee request must be filed "no later than
14 days after the entry of judgment" in a civil action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B). In this case,
plaintiff filed his motions for attorneys' fees prior to the entry of judgment against defendants.
These pending fee requests do not stand as a barrier to the Court's entry of final judgment on the
merits of plaintiff's action. Supreme Court precedent and the Advisory Committee notes to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure both confirm that outstanding attorneys' fee motions neither
affect nor preclude the finality of a merits judgment. See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co.,
486 U.S. 196, 202 (1988) ("An unresolved issue of attorney's fees for the litigation in question
does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final."); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 Advisory
Committee Notes (1993 Amendments) ("Filing a motion for fees . . . does not affect the finality
or appealability of a judgment.").

Rule 54(d)(2) also grants district courts the discretion to defer consideration of fee
petitions pending appellate review of an underlying judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 Advisory
Committee Notes (1993 Amendments) ("If appeal on the merits of the case is taken, the court
may tule on the claim for fees, may defer its ruling on that motion, or may deny the motion
without prejudice, directing under subdivision (d)(2)(B) a new period for filing after the appeal

has been resolved.") (emphasis added). "[T]he mere pendency of an appeal does provide a
Case 1:02-cv-00001-SSB-TSB Document135 ~~ Filed 02/03/2006 Page 3of8&

sufficient reason for deferring consideration of the attorney's fee question" until final resolution
of the appellate process. Ala.-Tombigee Rivers Coalition v. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 1994 WL
160377, at *1 (N.D. Ala. Jan. 28, 1994); see also AstraZeneca AB v. Mut. Pharmaceutical Co.,
2003 WL 22794868, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2003) ("The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
allow for the deferral of the issue of attorneys' fees until appeals are complete."). Because
deferred consideration will benefit both defendants and the class and will promote judicial
economy, the Court should exercise its discretion to refrain from resolving plaintiff's motions for
attorneys' fees until completion of appellate review.

Il. The Court Should Exercise Its Discretion To Defer Consideration of Plaintiff's
Attorneys' Fee Motions Pending Appeal.

Courts routinely defer consideration of an attorneys' fee motion pending the
outcome of an appeal. See, e.g., Art Midwest, Inc. v. Clapper, 2004 WL 743713, at *1 (N.D.
Tex. Apr. 5, 2004); Murphy v. Bd. of Educ., 273 F. Supp. 2d 292, 327 n.30 (W.D.N.Y. 2003);
Hipp v. Liberty Nat'] Life Ins. Co., 65 F. Supp. 2d 1314, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999); Allen v. West
Point-Pepperell, Inc., 11 F. Supp. 2d 277, 292 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). In this case, three separate
justifications support deferral of plaintiff's fee motions.

First, the Court should defer consideration of plaintiff's fee motions to avoid an
extended delay of appellate resolution of the merits of plaintiff's claims. The Court's
determination of plaintiff's fee motions will be a complex and time-consuming process.
Plaintiff's combined motions contain more than forty pages of argument and hundreds of pages
of supporting exhibits, including scores of pages of attorney time entries. Moreover, plaintiff
concedes that resolving class counsel's request for an award of 32% of the class recovery will
require both "notice to Class Members" and "`the holding of a Fairness Hearing at which

members of the class may be heard on the matter of counsel's fees." Pl.'s Mot. for Approval of
Case 1:02-cv-00001-SSB-TSB Document135 ~~ Filed 02/03/2006 Page4of8&

Reasonable Compensation, at 14. Thus, before the Court can decide plaintiff's fee motions, the
parties and the Court will have to follow the multi-step notice and fairness process attendant to
class action litigation. Id,

Deferring the resolution of plaintiff's fee motions would therefore avoid a
substantial delay in the resolution of defendants' appeal of the judgment in this case - to the
benefit of both defendants and the plaintiff class. The class will benefit from an earlier decision
on appeal because such a decision will enable class members to plan for their retirement with
greater certainty about their pension benefits. Earlier appellate review will benefit defendants by
providing them with greater clarity about the Plan's funding position and with swifter guidance
on how the Plan may be operated and administered in the future. !

Second, deferring the fee motions will avoid the prospect that the Court's fee
award could be rendered moot or could require revision in light of the decision on appeal. If
defendants were to prevail on their appeal on the issue of liability, any order issued on the fee
motions would be mooted, and the efforts invested by the Court and the parties in the resolution
of those motions will have been wasted." Similarly, if the Sixth Circuit were to modify the
award of damages to the class, the modified judgment might require revision of any award of
"reasonable compensation" to class counsel. See Rawlings v. Prudential Props., Inc., 3 F.3d 513,
516 (6th Cir. 1993) (recognizing that "the results achieved" by plaintiffs counsel affect the size

of a common fund award). Finally, there is always the possibility that the parties could settle this

 

For example, with each passing month, defendants must calculate lump sum payments to

new retirees who participated in the cash balance plan.

2 See Pikulas v, DaimlerChrysler, 397 F. Supp. 2d 883, 893 (E.D. Mich. 2005) ("Courts
have interpreted [ERISA Section 502(g)] to allow an award of attorney fees only to a prevailing
party."). |
Case 1:02-cv-00001-SSB-TSB Document135 ~~ Filed 02/03/2006 Page 5of8&

action while it is pending on appeal, in which case the settlement would likely impact the
question of attorneys' fees and costs.

Courts regularly defer consideration of attorneys' fee and cost motions until after
the conclusion of an appeal for precisely these reasons. See, e.g., Hipp, 65 F. Supp. 2d at 1323
(deferring consideration where "the outcome of the appeal could affect whether some or all of
the Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of costs and attorneys' fees"); Leibovitz v. Paramount
Pictures Corp., 1997 WL 542560, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 1997) (deferring consideration until
"prevailing party" status "4s confirmed by the Court of Appeals"); see also Allen, 11 F. Supp. 2d
at 292 (stating that it "would be inefficient to spend time calculating the exact amount of
attorneys' fees owed" where appeal could eliminate right to fee award). Deferral of the fee
motions is particularly appropriate in this case, since a modification of the damages award by the
court of appeals would likely require another round of class notice and another opportunity for
class members to be heard on the question of what constitutes "reasonable compensation" of
class counsel in light of the results achieved in the court of appeals.

Third, deferred consideration of the fee motions will avoid piecemeal and
duplicative consideration of attorneys' fee issues. The pending motions seek only partial
resolution of plaintiffs fee claims. Plaintiff's counsel estimates that defendants' "threatened
appeal," as well as other post-judgment obligations, will require "hundreds of additional hours of
service," for which counsel intends to seek fees. Pl.'s Mot. for Statutory Att'ys' Fees, at 18-19;
see also Hipp, 65 F. Supp. 2d at 1323. Indeed, plaintiffs counsel expressly requests that the
Court "retain jurisdiction over this case to resolve any supplemental fee application by

Plaintiffs." Pl.'s Mot. for Statutory Att'ys' Fees, at 19.
Case 1:02-cv-00001-SSB-TSB Document135 ~~ Filed 02/03/2006 Page6of8&

The most efficient way to proceed on the fee motions would be to take up the fee
question once ~ after the conclusion of an appeal - rather than considering it in piecemeal
fashion both before and after appellate proceedings. Courts have deferred consideration of fee
motions for this reason as well. See Bowers v. Universal City Dev. Partners, Ltd., 2005 WL
1243745, at *2 (M.D. Fla. May 19, 2005) ("If the district court were to resolve the fee and cost
issue while an appeal remains pending, it would be asked to repeat the procedure following the
appeal. This Court prefers to avoid the piecemeal resolution of fee disputes."); Hipp, 65 F. Supp.
2d at 1323 (deferring consideration of fee petition where "{r]esponding to [defendants'] appeal

will add further" to plaintiffs' fee claim).
