PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE
TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DEFER CONSIDERATION
OF PLAINTIFFS’ ATTORNEY’S FEES MOTIONS PENDING APPEAL

Pursuant to the procedure approved in Costantino v. TRW, Inc., N.D. Ohio No. C863368,1 Plaintiffs filed two motions on January 18, 2006 – one seeking an award of statutory
fees and costs against Defendants and payable to the class under ERISA § 502(g), 29 U.S.C.
§ 1132(g),2 and the other separately requesting distributions from the common fund created
in this action: reasonable compensation to class counsel for their services to the class;
reimbursement of litigation expenses reasonably incurred by the class representative or by

class counsel on his behalf; and a special award to the class representative, John West, in
recognition of his extraordinary service to the class.3 On February 3, 2006, Defendants
moved the Court “to defer consideration of the fee motions until defendants’ appeal of the
merits of the case has been decided.”4 The Court has been informed that “plaintiff does not
intend to oppose defendants’ motion to defer consideration of plaintiffs’ fee petitions.”5
Plaintiffs now timely6 confirm their position on Defendants’ motion.
Plaintiffs’ fee motions were not filed precipitously. The Court entered summary
judgment in favor of the class on the issue of liability in April 2004, determining that “the
manner in which Plaintiffs’ lump sum disbursements were calculated under the AK Steel
Plan violated ERISA and the I.R.C.”7 In its Orders entered on July 25 and December 15,
2005 [Doc. Nos. 119, 120 and 128], the Court specified or described those whom the Court

Joint Motion to Continue Briefing on Plaintiff’s Attorneys’ Fee Motions (filed Feb. 8,
2006) [Doc. No. 136] at 1. The parties agree that Plaintiffs’ acquiescence in Defendants’ request
for a deferment of the Court’s consideration of the fee motions is without prejudice to Plaintiffs’
“position that defendants have no standing to be heard on plaintiff’s motion for a common fund
fee and costs award.” Id.

found to be members of the class, and thus bound by the Court’s judgment.8 By its Order
entered on December 19, 2005 [Doc. No. 129], the Court set forth the manner by which the
underpayments owed class members are to be calculated, and determined the time from
which, and the rate at which, prejudgment interest on those underpayments is to be
computed. On January 18, 2006, the parties jointly filed “an agreed roster of the current class
members and the amount due to each class member as computed pursuant to the terms of the
Court’s Order of December 19, 2005.”9 Thus, Plaintiffs’ fee motions, due to be submitted
“no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment,”10 were not filed precipitously. Rather,
Plaintiffs’ motions properly were made in the course of this litigation’s final issues in the
district court. If the parties could more quickly resolve those final issues and thus speed the
appellate court’s decision on the merits, then the class would benefit. Therefore, class
counsel concur in Defendants’ request that the Court postpone its consideration of Plaintiffs’
fee motions until after the conclusion of the appeal.11
Moreover, an express decision of this Court on the method by which it postpones
consideration of Plaintiffs’ fee motions would resolve a potential area of uncertainty as to the

requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.”).

nature and timeliness of those motions. Prior to the Supreme Court’s Budinich decision,12
the rule in the Sixth Circuit was that “‘a judgment is final for purposes of appeal although
the amount of attorney fees have not been determined.’”13 It is unclear whether Budinich and
its progeny may have affected that blanket Sixth Circuit rule.
Furthermore, a denial of Plaintiffs’ fee motions, otherwise than on the merits and
without prejudice to refiling, would better serve the interest of the Court and the parties than
would a deferment of the pending fee motions. The efforts the parties anticipate during the
appellate course of this litigation will generate attorney services and costs far beyond those
related in the pending motions. Thus, while a deferral of the motions would require the
submission of additional briefing, a denial of the motions, otherwise than on the merits and
without prejudice to refiling, would allow the parties to approach the issues without having
to relate to filings filed years earlier.
For all the reasons related above, on Defendants’ Motion to Defer Consideration of
Plaintiff’s Attorneys’ Fee Motions Pending Appeal [Doc. No. 135] the Court should enter
an Order denying Plaintiffs’ two fee motions otherwise than on the merits and without
prejudice to refiling, and directing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(d)(2)(B) that Plaintiffs may have
six weeks after the court of appeal’s mandate issues pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 41(b) within
which to file such motions in the district court.
