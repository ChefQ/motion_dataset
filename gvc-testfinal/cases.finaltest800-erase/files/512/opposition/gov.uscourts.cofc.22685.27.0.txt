PLAINTIFFS' RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
ADOPTION OF SCHEDULING ORDER
COME NOW, Plaintiffs, by and through their undersigned counsel, and in
response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Adoption of Scheduling Order, state as follows:
1.

The Plaintiffs wholeheartedly support the consolidation of Biery and

Pankratz for purposes of briefing and deciding the government’s liability. While some of
the specific factual issues are different, the fundamental legal issues are common and
Plaintiffs believe that consolidating these cases for briefing on the issue of liability is the
most cost efficient and timely manner to resolve this issue.
2.

Plaintiffs agree to enlarge the time for the government to respond to the

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in Pankratz until June 2, 2008.
3.

Plaintiffs do not, however, believe that in Biery any enlargement of time

beyond this date is necessary or appropriate. Plaintiffs note that Biery and Pankratz
involve only 13 total claims, and the Plaintiffs have provided the Defendant with all the
underlying title documents. All of the title documents for five of the six Plaintiffs in

Pankratz have been available to the government since September 28, 2007. Furthermore,
the title documents for the sixth plaintiff, the Myers, were provided to the Defendant in
the Plaintiffs'Second Amended Complaint filed on April 10, 2008. The title documents
for six of the seven plaintiffs in Biery were produced along with Plaintiffs'Amended
Complaint on April 18, 2008. Plaintiff Dorothy Biery'
s title documents were produced
the day the Complaint was originally filed on September 26, 2007.
4.

The nature of the railroad’s interest is defined in Pankratz by a single

condemnation order and a single voluntary grant (both of which have been provided to
the Defendant); and in Biery by two condemnation orders, both of which have also been
provided to the defendant.
5.

Pankratz and Biery were filed on September 19 and 26, 2007,

respectively.
6.

Assuming that the Defendant is found to be obligated by the Fifth

Amendment to the United States Constitution to pay the Plaintiffs for a taking of their
land, the Defendant will also be required to pay delay damages on this amount. Further
delay in resolving this issue will only serve to increase Defendant’s ultimate financial
obligation and further delay the Plaintiff landowners’ constitutional right to “just
compensation” for the taking of their land.
7.

As to the government’s contention on Page 4 of its Motion regarding the

incomplete condemnation order, Plaintiff received just today, May 6, 2008, a copy the
accompanying Report of Commissioners that corresponds to the Condemnation Order
supplied by Plaintiffs in both their Complaint and Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.
This report of commissioners was attached to the government’s untimely discovery

responses as Exhibit No. 1. Plaintiffs’ title company did not supply them with this
additional report, however, the report does not alter or change the condemnation order
recorded in the Butler County Recorder of Deeds Office provided by Plaintiffs and
attached to their pleadings.
WHEREFORE Plaintiffs request this Court grant Defendant’s Motion to
Consolidate and Order that Defendant’s joint response to Plaintiffs’ Motions for Partial
Summary Judgment in these two cases be filed by June 2, 2008.
