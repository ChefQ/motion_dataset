UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
ORLANDO DIVISION
JANET RIFFLE, on behalf of herself
and all others similarly situated;
Plaintiffs,
Case No.: 6:14-cv-1181-Orl-22TBS
vs.
CONVERGENT OUTSOURCING, INC., a
Washington corporation,
and LVNV FUNDING, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company.
Defendants.
______________________________________/
DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION
COMES NOW, Defendants CONVERGENT OUTSOURCING, INC. and LVNV
FUNDING, LLC (“Defendants”), by and through their undersigned counsel, and hereby file this
Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification and state as follows:
I.

Factual Background / Procedural History.

Plaintiff brings this putative class action against Defendants for alleged violations of the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692, et seq. (“FDCPA”). See, DE 1, generally.
All of Plaintiff’s claims stem from allegations that Defendants caused to be mailed a collection
letter to Plaintiff on May 22, 2014 seeking to collect upon Plaintiff’s delinquent credit card
obligation to Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A. Ibid. at ¶¶ 12, 17. Plaintiff alleges that the letter
at issue violates 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e, 1692e(2), 1692e(5), 1692e(10) and 1692f as it seeks to
collect a “timebarred debt[] without disclosure of that fact.” Ibid. ¶ 38. As factual support for
Plaintiff’s allegation that her debt was “timebarred”, Plaintiff alleges that the cardholder

1|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 2 of 19 PageID 436

agreement governing the credit card debt at issue provides that Delaware law applies, that the
statute of limitations on credit card debt in Delaware is three (3) years, and that Plaintiff’s last
payment on the debt was more than five (5) years ago. Ibid. at ¶¶ 13, 14 and 24.1
Prior to April 17, 2014, Plaintiff’s account with Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A was
acquired by LVNV FUNDING, LLC (“LVNV”). See, Declaration of Meghan Emmerich
attached hereto as “Exhibit A” (“Dec. Emmerich”) at ¶¶ 6 and 7. On April 17, 2014, Resurgent
Capital Services, LP in its capacity as the master servicing agent for LVNV referred this account
to Convergent Outsourcing, Inc. (“Convgerent”) for collection. Ibid. at ¶ 8. Convergent then sent
the letter at issue to Plaintiff on May 22, 2014. See, Declaration of Jeff Hunter attached hereto as
“Exhibit B” (“Dec. Hunter”) at ¶ 8.
On May 22, 2015, Plaintiff filed her Motion for Class Certification and Memorandum in
Support thereof. See, DE 67 and 68.2 Through her Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiff asks
this Court to certify a class of claimants consisting of:
(i)
(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

1

All persons with address in Florida;
To whom Defendant Convergent Outsourcing, Inc. sent, or
caused to be sent, a letter in the form of Exhibit A on behalf
of LVNV Funding LLC;
In an attempt to collect an alleged debt originally due
Chase Manhattan Bank;
Which, as shown by the nature of the alleged debt,
Defendants’ records, or the records of the original creditors,
was primarily for personal, family or household purposes;

In an apparent attempt to cover all bases, Plaintiff alleges that her last payment on the debt at issue was outside of
the applicable Florida statute of limitation on credit card debt. However, given that Plaintiff has explicitly alleged
that Delaware law controls, the Florida statute of limitations is of no import.
2
Plaintiff’s submission of a Motion and separate Memorandum is in direct contravention of Local Rule 3.01(a)
which requires that all motions and supporting memoranda be submitted “in a single document not more that
twenty-five (25) pages.” Plaintiff’s inability to heed this Court’s Local Rules militates against a finding that Plaintiff
and her counsel will adequately represent the interests of the proposed class. See, e.g., Quintanilla v. Sci.-Atlanta,
Inc., 35 Fed. R. Serv. 2d 123 (N.D. Tex. 1982)(“failure to comply with the Local Rules bears strongly on the
adequacy of the class representative”); Kandel v. Bro. Intern. Corp., 264 F.R.D. 630, 634 (C.D. Cal. 2010)(finding
counsel inadequate to represent the interest of the class in light of, inter alia, inability to follow local rules);
Buckland v. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., CV 11-8414-JST JEMX, 2012 WL 3705263, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Aug.
27, 2012)(same).

(v)

(vi)

On which the last payment was made five or more years
prior to the date of mailing of the letter in the form of
Exhibit A;
During the period one year prior to the date of filing this
action.

See, DE 68 at p. 2.
With respect to Plaintiff’s account in question, Defendants are not in possession, custody
or control of the cardholder agreement which governs Plaintiff’s account. See, Dec. Emmerich at
¶ 9; Dec. Hunter at ¶ 9. Defendants are not in possession, custody or control of documentation
which demonstrates the nature of any purchases made on Plaintiff’s account. See, Dec.
Emmerich at ¶ 10; Dec. Hunter at ¶ 10. Likewise, Defendants are not in possession, custody or
control of the cardholder agreements which govern the financial obligations of the putative class
members, nor are Defendants in possession, custody or control of documentation demonstrating
the nature of the financial obligations of the putative class members. See, Dec. Emmerich at ¶¶
11 – 12; Dec. Hunter at ¶¶ 11 – 12.
Through the instant Motion, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court deny
Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification, as Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the
requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 have been satisfied.
II.

Legal Standard.

“The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on
behalf of the individual named parties only.’” Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541,
2550, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01, 99 S.Ct.
2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979)). Accordingly, the burden of establishing the propriety of class
certification rests with the advocate of the class. Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., 350
F.3d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.2003); Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1099 (5th Cir.1975). The

3|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 4 of 19 PageID 438

prerequisites to class certification are referred to as “numerosity, commonality, typicality, and
adequacy of representation,” and are “designed to limit class claims to those fairly encompassed
by the named plaintiffs’ individual claims.” Prado–Steiman ex rel. Prado v. Bush, 221 F.3d
1266, 1278 (11th Cir.2000). In addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a), at least one of the
three alternative subsections of Rule 23(b) must be satisfied to certify a class. Babineau v. Fed.
Express Corp., 576 F.3d 1183, 1190 (11th Cir.2009).
Plaintiff seeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3), which requires her to demonstrate (1)
that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting
only individual members, and (2) that a class action is superior to other available methods for
fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. Id. Failure to establish any of the required
elements of Rule 23(a) or Rule 23(b) (3) precludes class certification. Valley Drug, 350 F.3d at
1188 (citing Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 615–18, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138
L.Ed.2d 689 (1997)). Evidentiary proof is required to show compliance with Rule 23. Comcast
Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1432, 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013) (quoting Dukes, 131 S.Ct. at
2551–52). The party seeking class certification must prove compliance by a preponderance of the
evidence. See, Messner v. Northshore Univ. Health Sys., 669 F.3d 802, 811 (7th Cir.2012); In re
Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 320 (3d Cir.2009); Teamsters Local 445
Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier Inc., 546 F.3d 196, 202 (2d Cir.2008). Since Rule 23
does not impose a mere pleadings standard, it may be necessary to probe behind the pleadings on
the certification question, and “certification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a
rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.’” Dukes, 131 S.Ct. at
2551 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740
(1982)) (internal citations omitted). The claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable

4|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 5 of 19 PageID 439

substantive law must be understood in order to make a meaningful determination of the
certification issues. Madison v. Chalmette Refining, LLC, 637 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2011). And
the analysis will frequently “overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim,” since the
“‘class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal
issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action.’” Id. at 2552 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160).
In sum, a class may not be certified without a finding that each Rule 23 requirement is met.
Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 310. The analysis must be “rigorous” and based on findings
supported by the factual record. Vega v. T–Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1266–67 (11th
Cir.2009).
III.

Argument.

Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification must be denied as Plaintiff has failed to provide
the Court with evidentiary proof that an ascertainable class of claimants exists and has further
failed to demonstrate that common questions of law and fact predominate over individual
inquiries.
a. Plaintiff has failed to provide the Court with evidentiary
proof that an ascertainable class of claimants exists.
“It is elementary that in order to maintain a class action, the class sought to be
represented must be adequately defined and clearly ascertainable.” DeBremaecker v. Short, 433
F.2d 733, 734 (5th Cir. 1970); see also, Little v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 691 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th
Cir. 2012) (“Before a district court may grant a motion for class certification, a plaintiff seeking
to represent a proposed class must establish that the proposed class is ‘adequately defined and
clearly ascertainable.’”); Rink, 203 F.R.D. at 659 (holding that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
23(a) “contains an implicit requirement that the class be ‘adequately defined and clearly
ascertainable’”).
5|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 6 of 19 PageID 440

“[A] plaintiff must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the class is currently
and readily ascertainable based on objective criteria, and a trial court must undertake a rigorous
analysis of the evidence to determine if the standard is met.” Carrera v. Bayer Corp., 727 F.3d
300, 306 (3d Cir. 2013)(internal citations omitted). “Ascertainability mandates a rigorous
approach at the outset because of the key roles it plays as part of a Rule 23(b)(3) class action
lawsuit.” Id. at 307. “A plaintiff may not merely propose a method of ascertaining a class
without any evidentiary support that the method will be successful.” Id. at 306 (emphasis
added). “An identifiable class exists if its members can be ascertained by reference to objective
criteria.” Bussey v. Macon County Greyhound Park, Inc., 562 Fed. Appx. 782, 787 (11th Cir.
2014) “The analysis of the objective criteria also should be administratively feasible.” Id.
“‘Administrative feasibility’ means ‘that identifying class members is a manageable process that
does not require much, if any, individual inquiry.’” Id. (quoting Newberg on Class Actions § 3.3
p. 164 (5th ed.2012)).
The Eleventh Circuit has unequivocally held that in order to be entitled to relief under the
FDCPA, a plaintiff must make a “threshold showing that the money being collected qualifies as a
‘debt’” as defined by the FDCPA. Oppenheim v. I.C. System, Inc., 627 F.3d 833, 837 (11th Cir.
2010). With respect to this essential element of a claim under the FDCPA, the Eleventh Circuit
has explained:
To recover under…the FDCPA…, a plaintiff must make a
threshold showing that the money being collected qualifies as a
“debt.” The FDCPA…defines “debt” as:
any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer
to pay money arising out of a transaction in which
the money, property, insurance, or services which
are the subject of the transaction are primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes, whether or
not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.
6|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 7 of 19 PageID 441

Accordingly, the FDCPA….appl[ies] only to payment obligations
of a (1) consumer arising out of a (2) transaction in which the
money, property, insurance, or services at issue are (3) primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes. The statute thus
makes clear that the mere obligation to pay does not constitute a
“debt” under the FDCPA.
Id., 627 F.3d at 836-37 (internal citations omitted).
Courts have recognized that the inclusion of the word “primarily” in the definition
requires courts to “look to the substance of the transaction” in order to determine the “debt”
element. See, Slenk v. Transworld Systems, Inc., 236 F.3d 1072, 1075 (9th Cir.2001)(quoting
Riviere, et al. v. Banner Chevrolet, Inc., 184 F.3d 457, 462 (5th Cir.1999)).
Through her proposed class definition, Plaintiff acknowledges, as she must, that only
persons whose debt was incurred “was primarily for personal, family or household purposes” are
entitled to inclusion in the class. See, DE 68 at p. 2. While Plaintiff’s Motion for Class
Certification contains no explicit methodology for ascertaining the nature of each putative class
member’s debt, implicit in Plaintiff’s proposed class definition is a suggestion that the nature of
each debt at issue can be revealed through a review of “Defendants’ records, or the records of the
original creditors[.]” Ibid.
Absent from Plaintiff’s Motion is any evidence that these “records” could successfully
reveal the “primary purpose” for which each individual debt was incurred. In fact, as detailed
supra, the uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that Defendants have no records demonstrating
the nature of the putative class member’s financial obligations. See, Dec. Emmerich at ¶ 12; Dec.
Hunter at ¶ 12. Plaintiff has not supplied the Court with any evidence that the “records of the
original creditors” referenced in Plaintiff’s proposed class definition even exist, let alone that
such records contain sufficient information from which the Court could determine the “primary

7|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 8 of 19 PageID 442

purpose” for which each individual debt was incurred. Accordingly, class certification must be
denied as Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s mandate that a party seeking
class certification affirmatively demonstrate that the elements of Rule 23 have been satisfied
through evidentiary proof. See, Comcast Corp., 133 S.Ct. at 1432 (quoting Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at
2551 – 52); see also, In re Photochromic Lens Antitrust Litig., 8:10-CV-00984-T-27EA, 2014
WL 1338605, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 3, 2014)(Whittemore, J.)(“Evidentiary proof is required to
show compliance with Rule 23.”)
Similarly absent from Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification is any method by which
Defendants could challenge the accuracy of the “records of the original creditors” to the extent
such record even exist. The absence of method by which a class action defendant can challenge
the evidence relied upon to prove class membership constitutes a denial of due process and
precludes class certification. See, e.g., Carrera, 727 F.3d 300. In Carrera, the plaintiff brought
suit under the Florida Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“FDUTPA”) alleging that the
defendant falsely and deceptively advertised its diet supplement. Id. at 304 – 305. The Third
Circuit framed the ascertainability issue as follows:
In this case, the ascertainability question is whether each class
member purchased WeightSmart in Florida. If this were an
individual claim, a plaintiff would have to prove at trial he
purchased WeightSmart. A defendant in a class action has a due
process right to raise individual challenges and defenses to claims,
and a class action cannot be certified in a way that eviscerates this
right or masks individual issues. A defendant has a similar, if not
the same, due process right to challenge the proof used to
demonstrate class membership as it does to challenge the elements
of a plaintiff’s claim. Ascertainability provides due process by
requiring that a defendant be able to test the reliability of the
evidence submitted to prove class membership.
Id. at 307 (internal citations omitted).

8|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 9 of 19 PageID 443

In defining the plaintiff’s obligation with respect to the ascertainability requirement, the
Court held:
The method of determining whether someone is in the class must
be “administratively feasible.” A plaintiff does not satisfy the
ascertainability requirement if individualized fact-finding or minitrials will be required to prove class membership. Administrative
feasibility means that identifying class members is a manageable
process that does not require much, if any, individual factual
inquiry.
The type of challenge to the reliability of evidence that is required
will vary based on the nature of the evidence. For example, if
Carrera produces retailer records that purport to list purchasers of
WeightSmart, Bayer can challenge the reliability of those records,
perhaps by deposing a corporate record-keeper. In sum, to satisfy
ascertainability as it relates to proof of class membership, the
plaintiff must demonstrate his purported method for ascertaining
class members is reliable and administratively feasible, and
permits a defendant to challenge the evidence used to prove class
membership.
Id., 307-08 (internal citations omitted).
The plaintiff in Carrera proposed ascertaining the purchasers of the defendant’s product
through a review of records from retailers. Id. at 308. In rejecting the proposed method, the Court
held that “there is no evidence that a single purchaser of WeightSmart could be identified using
records of customer membership cards or records of online sales.” Id. at 309 (emphasis added).
In the instant case, as in Carrera, the record is devoid of any evidence that the “primary
purpose” for which any class member’s debt was incurred can be determined through a review of
“Defendants’ records, or the records of the original creditors”. In fact, Plaintiff did not offer a
single “record” in support of her Motion for Class Certification and it is undisputed that
Defendants have no such records. Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to “demonstrate h[er] purported
method for ascertaining class members is reliable and administratively feasible, and permits a
defendant to challenge the evidence used to prove class membership.” Id. at 308. As such,
9|Page

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 10 of 19 PageID 444

Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification must be denied as Plaintiff has failed to carry her
burden to demonstrate that the proposed class is “identifiable [and] can be ascertained by
reference to objective criteria.” Bussey, 562 Fed. Appx. at 787.
b. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that common questions
of law and fact predominate over individualized issues.
Plaintiff’s argues that the predominance requirement is satisfied in light of the fact that
“all class members, by definition, were sent a letter in the form of Exhibit A from Defendant
which failed to state that the debt was timebarred and thereby were subjected to the same
violations of the FDCPA as Ms. Riffle.” See, DE 68 at p. 11. Plaintiff’s argument is
fundamentally flawed in that it incorrectly assumes that the debts of all persons meeting the
proposed class definition were “timebarred” on the date that the letter was sent. Because the
debts of those persons meeting the class definition are not necessarily outside of the statute of
limitations, and because a determination of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
each putative class member’s debt will require individualized inquiries, the predominance
element has not been satisfied.3
To satisfy Rule 23(b)(3), the questions in a class action that are subject to generalized
proof, and thus applicable to the class as a whole, must predominate over questions that are
subject only to individualized proof. See, In re Photochromic Lens Antitrust Litig., 2014 WL
1338605 at *16 (citing Jackson v. Motel 6 Multipurpose, Inc., 130 F.3d 999, 1005 (11th
Cir.1997)). “If proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual
treatment, then class certification is unsuitable.” In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552
F.3d 305, 311 (3d Cir. 2009)(citing Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259
3

To be clear, Defendant contests that the commonality element of Rule 23(a) has been satisfied. However,
recognizing that the predominance inquiry is “far more demanding than the commonality requirement”, Defendant
will focus its argument on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b). See, Jackson v. Motel 6 Multipurpose, Inc.,
130 F.3d 999, 1005 (11th Cir. 1997).

F.3d 154, 172 (3d Cir.2001)); see also, Photochromic Lens, 2014 WL 1338605 at
*17(“individual treatment of the essential elements of a case precludes certification”)(emphasis
in original).
The Eleventh Circuit has long recognized that “[w]hether an issue predominates can only
be determined after considering what value the resolution of the class-wide issue will have in
each class member’s underlying cause of action.” Rutstein v. Avis Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 211
F.3d 1228, 1234 (11th Cir. 2000)(citing Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623, 117
S.Ct. 2231, 2249 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997) (“[The predominance] inquiry trains on the legal or
factual questions that qualify each class member’s case as a genuine controversy.”); Coopers &
Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (“[C]lass
determination generally involves considerations that are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal issues
comprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.’ ”)).
As detailed supra, Plaintiff’s claim that her debt is timebarred is premised upon
allegations that her debt is “governed by [..] the laws of the State of Delaware”, that “[t]he statute
of limitations on a credit card debt in Delaware is three (3) years” and that “the last payment
made on [Plaintiff’s debt] was more than five (5) years ago.” See, DE 1 at ¶¶ 13, 14 and 24.
Plaintiff has proposed that class membership be limited to those responsible for debts “on which
the last payment was made five or more years prior to the date of the mailing of the letter”. See,
DE 68 at p. 2. Through her allegations and her proposed class definition, Plaintiff contends that
the absence of a payment made on an obligation governed by Delaware law for a five year period
renders the debt outside of the applicable statute of limitations. Plaintiff misconstrues Delaware
law.

The relevant Delaware statute of limitations, found at Section 8106(a) of Title 10 of the
Delaware Code, reads:
No action to recover damages for trespass, no action to regain
possession of personal chattels, no action to recover damages for
the detention of personal chattels, no action to recover a debt not
evidenced by a record or by instrument under seal, no action based
on a detailed statement of the mutual demands in the nature of a
debit and credit between parties arising out of contractual or
fiduciary relations, no action based on a promise, no action based
on a statute, and no action to recover damages caused by an injury
unaccompanied with force or resulting indirectly from the act of
the defendant shall be brought after the expiration of 3 years from
the accruing of the cause of action ....
10 Del. C. § 8106(a).
In Carter v. Athena Funding Group Assets LLC, 612-CV-706-ORL-31DAB, 2012 WL
3947344 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 10, 2012), Judge Presnell examined the Delaware statute of limitations
as it applied to the plaintiff’s credit card debt. Id. at * 1. In Carter, the plaintiff asserted that the
defendant violated the FDCPA by filing suit to collect on a credit card debt after the statute of
limitations had run. Id. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that he had made his last payment more
than three years prior to the filing of the defendant’s lawsuit and that the applicable Delaware
statute of limitations required the defendant to file suit no more than three years after the accrual
of its cause of action. Id. The defendant moved to dismiss arguing that the plaintiff had failed to
state a claim as “the cause of action accrued on ‘the date of last activity,’ which is also known as
the ‘final default date’ or the date the account was closed.” Id. After examining an analogous
case decided by the Delaware Supreme Court, Judge Presnell concluded:
As in Worrel, the contract at issue here does not declare the entire
debt immediately due and payable as soon as the cardholder misses
a payment. The Cardmember Agreement provides that the
cardholder will be considered to be in default if he or she fails to
make a minimum payment, and further provides that “[i]f we
consider your account to be in default, we may close your account
12 | P a g e

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 13 of 19 PageID 447

without notice and require you to pay your unpaid balance
immediately.” Doc. 1–1 at 3. Accordingly, per Worrel, after Carter
missed his payment, the statute of limitations would not have
begun to run until he first received an indication that the lender
was closing his account and requiring him to pay his unpaid
balance immediately. The Amended Complaint does not allege that
he ever received such an indication, much less that the state court
collection case was filed more than three years after he received it.
Accordingly, Carter has failed to state a claim.
Id.4
Similarly, in Mercado v. HFC Collection Ctr., Inc., 3:12-CV-122-J-12JBT, 2013 WL
645988 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 28, 2013) report and recommendation adopted, 3:12-CV-122-J-12JBT,
2013 WL 654419 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 21, 2013), the plaintiffs alleged the defendants violated the
FDCPA by filing a “timebarred” lawsuit seeking to collect upon the plaintiffs’ credit card debts
issued through Chase Bank, which had been charged off and sold to one of the defendants. Id. at
*1. The agreement at issue provided that Delaware law governed the debt. Id. at *2. The
plaintiffs argued that the cause of action in the underlying collection action “accrued on the dates
that each Plaintiff missed a payment.” The defendants contended that “the statute of limitations
did not start to run until Chase Bank ‘charged off’ each debt, declaring each Plaintiff’s entire
balance due immediately.” Id. In siding with the defendant, Judge Toomey held:
Similar to the agreement at issue in Carter, the agreement in the
instant case merely allowed Chase Bank at its option to close the
account and require full payment of the unpaid balance. However,
the agreement did not require such action or provide for it
automatically. Chase Bank did not close each account and require
full payment until November 30, 2008.

The plaintiff in Carter was represented by the same attorney that is representing the Plaintiff in the instant case.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiff’s counsel is uniquely acquainted with the intricacies of the
Delaware statute of limitations, Plaintiff’s Motion contains no meaningful discussion of its applicability to the facts
of Plaintiff’s claim or the claims of the class members she seeks to represent. Plaintiff’s decision to ignore Delaware
substantive law further demonstrates that neither Plaintiff nor her counsel will adequately represent the putative
class. See Culver v. City of Milwaukee, 277 F.3d 908, 913 (7th Cir.2002)(“For purposes of determining whether the
class representative is an adequate representative of the members of the class, the performance of the class lawyer is
inseparable from that of the class representative.”)

Thus, the fact that Chase Bank recognized that Plaintiffs’ accounts
were delinquent, as shown by the spreadsheets, is not the operative
fact that begins the running of the statute of limitations. The
operative fact is when Chase Bank took the information that
Plaintiffs were in default, and thus their accounts were delinquent,
and manifested an intent to require payment of the full balances.
[…]
Thus, the undersigned recommends that Delaware’s Supreme
Court would interpret 10 Del. C. § 8106(a) to mean that the causes
of action against each Plaintiff accrued only upon the first instance
that Chase Bank manifested an intent to declare the entire balance
on each account immediately due and payable. This did not occur
until Chase Bank closed and charged off both Plaintiffs’ accounts
on November 30, 2008. Section 8106(a), therefore, did not bar
HFC’s state court collections suits until after November 30, 2011.
HFC sued Mercado on June 10, 2011 and Rodriggs on August 22,
2011. Thus, neither of these suits were time-barred. Plaintiffs’
claims under the FDCPA and FCCPA, therefore, fail.
Id. at *5 – 6.
In the instant case, Plaintiff fails to offer any evidence demonstrating that the debts of
those persons meeting the class definition are outside of the applicable statute of limitations.
Instead, as demonstrated by Carter and Mercado, determining whether or not any putative class
member’s debt was timebarred will require at least a review of the applicable terms of each
individual class member’s contract with the original creditor, and potentially a more in depth
analysis of the original creditor’s treatment of each account. It is undisputed that Defendants’ are
not in possession, custody or control of the applicable contracts and Plaintiff has failed to supply
the Court with any evidence of the terms of the class member’s agreement(s) with the original
creditor. In light of the faulty premise upon which Plaintiff’s Motion is based, and the complete
absence of record evidence to demonstrate that any putative class member’s debt is outside of the
applicable statute of limitations, the Court must deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification.
In Clavell v. Midland Funding LLC, CIV.A. 10-3593, 2011 WL 2462046 (E.D. Pa. June
21, 2011) the plaintiff brought a class action suit alleging the defendant violated the FDCPA by

14 | P a g e

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 15 of 19 PageID 449

filing a collection action on an allegedly timebarred debt. The plaintiff sought certification of a
class consisting of “[a]ll persons against whom Defendant sued since July 21, 2009, on time
barred debt based on written instruments, such as credit card agreements, as calculated from the
last payment due date available in Defendant’s records.” Id. at *2. In support of his motion for
class certification, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant could “run searches on its database to
show each debt’s last payment date and that from this the statute of limitations, and whether it
has run can be readily determined.” Id. at *3. In rejecting this argument and denying class
certification, the Court held:
Whether Clavell is successful in this action depends on whether
Midland has been filing lawsuits on time-barred debts. Thus,
whether the debt was time-barred is something that we would have
to determine for each potential class member. “If the court is
required to conduct individual inquiries to determine whether each
potential class member falls within the class, the court should deny
certification.”Ramirez v. Palisades Collection, LLC, 250 F.R.D.
366, 369 (N.D.Ill.2008). In addition, “[w]here nothing in the
company’s databases ‘shows or could show’ whether individuals
should be included in the proposed class, the class definition fails.”
Sadler, 2008 WL 2692274, at *5.
[…]
[A]s calculating the statute of limitations based on the last payment
due date may not—indeed, likely will not—definitely capture the
actual statute of limitations expiration date, the Midland database
will not avoid an individualized inquiry into each putative
member’s debt’s particular circumstances. Thus, although Clavell
himself is a member of his proposed class, that class is not
identifiable based on Midland’s records alone. In fact, those
records show that an independent inquiry had to be conducted to
determine whether Clavell’s debt’s statute of limitations had
indeed run.
Id. at *4 – 5.
In the instant case, as in Clavell, “whether the debt was time-barred is something that we
would have to determine for each potential class member.” Id. at *4. However, like in Clavell,
“calculating the statute of limitations based on the last payment due date may not—indeed, likely
15 | P a g e

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 16 of 19 PageID 450

will not—definitely capture the actual statute of limitations expiration date” as Plaintiff suggests.
Instead, an independent inquiry into the terms governing and circumstances surrounding each
individual class member’s debt will need to be conducted in order to determine class
membership. As Plaintiff has offered no evidence demonstrating that these issues are subject to
class-wide resolution through generalized proof, class certification is inappropriate. See, e.g.,
Jackson v. Motel 6 Multipurpose, Inc., 130 F.3d 999, 1005 (11th Cir. 1997)(“the issues in the
class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus applicable to the class as a whole,
must predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.”)(citing Kerr v.
City of West Palm Beach, 875 F.2d 1546, 1557–58 (11th Cir.1989)).
In addition to failing to provide the Court with any evidence of the terms of the
applicable contracts, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that all class members were subject to
uniform contractual terms at the time the letters at issue were sent. The Consumer Finance
Protection Bureau currently lists 17 different cardholder agreements for credit cards issued by
Chase Bank in its credit card agreement database. See, http://www.consumerfinance.gov/creditcards/agreements/issuer/284/. As Plaintiff’s theory of liability stems from the terms of her
agreement with the original creditor, Plaintiff’s failure to demonstrate that the putative class
members were subject to the same contractual terms further demonstrates that class certification
is inappropriate. See, e.g. Sacred Heart Health Sys., Inc. v. Humana Mil. Healthcare Services,
Inc., 601 F.3d 1159, 1171 (11th Cir. 2010)(claims involving contracts “are peculiarly driven by
the terms of the parties’ agreement, and common questions rarely will predominate if the
relevant terms vary in substance among the contracts.”)
In Vega v T-Mobile USA, Inc., the plaintiff brought a class action based on allegations
that T-Mobile failed to pay sales commissions. Id., 564 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir. 2009). The

16 | P a g e

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 75 Filed 06/22/15 Page 17 of 19 PageID 451

fact that not every putative class member would be bound by the same contract led the Court to
reverse the district court’s certification order stating:
Without the existence of a common contract, of course, there can
also be no commonality with respect to whether T–Mobile’s
conduct relating to commission charge backs, even if undertaken
pursuant to a uniform policy, constituted a breach of every class
member’s particular employment contract... Lacking commonality,
the allegations in Vega’s complaint obviously must fail the
predominance test as well.
Id., 564 F.3d at 1272.
Likewise in the instant case, Plaintiff has failed to supply the Court with evidence of a
“common contract” between the original creditor and every class member. Accordingly, Plaintiff
has failed to demonstrate that the statute of limitations for each class member’s obligation to
Chase is to be calculated the same manner under Delaware law. As such, there is “no
commonality with respect to whether [the debts at issue were timebarred under] every class
member’s particular…contract.” Id. Plaintiff has failed to establish that this case involves a
“form contract, executed under like conditions by all class members, [which would] best
facilitate[] class treatment.” See, Sacred Heart, 601 F.3d at 1171. As the Eleventh Circuit has
consistently “required at the threshold that all of the subject contracts be ‘materially similar’”,
class certification must be denied in light of Plaintiff’s failure to demonstrate how the statute of
limitations of each class member’s debt is to be calculated. Id., (citing Allapattah Servs. v. Exxon
Corp., 333 F.3d 1248, 1261 (11th Cir.2003) and Sharkus v. Blue Cross of Greater Phila., 494 Pa.
336, 431 A.2d 883, 886–87 (1981)).
IV.

Conclusion.

Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification must be denied as Plaintiff has failed to supply
the Court with evidentiary proof that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.

17 | P a g e

Plaintiff has failed to offer evidence establishing that the nature of each putative class member’s
debt can be ascertained in a reliable and administratively feasible manner. Plaintiff has further
failed to demonstrate that the applicable statute of limitations for each putative class member’s
debt can be determined on a class-wide basis through generalized proof.
WHEREFORE Defendant respectfully requests an Order from this Honorable Court
DENYING Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification.
