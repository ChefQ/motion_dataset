UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
ORLANDO DIVISION

JANET RIFFLE,
on behalf of herself,
and all others similarly situated,
Plaintiff,
v.

CASE NO. 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS

CONVERGENT
OUTSOURCING, INC.
and LVNV FUNDING LLC,
Defendants.
_________________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION
Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Local Rule
4.04, and Order of April 2, 2015 (Document No. 65) Plaintiff Janet Riffle moves
the Court to certify this case as a class action defined as (I) all persons with
addresses in Florida (ii) to whom Defendant Convergent Outsourcing, Inc. sent, or
caused to be sent, a letter in the form of Exhibit A on behalf of LVNV Funding
LLC (iii) in an attempt to collect an alleged debt originally due Chase Manhattan
Bank (iv) which, as shown by the nature of the alleged debt, Defendants’ records,
or the records of the original creditors, was primarily for personal, family, or
1

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 67 Filed 05/22/15 Page 2 of 6 PageID 361

household purposes (v) on which the last payment was made five or more years
prior to the date of mailing of the letter in the form of Exhibit A (vi) during the
period one year prior to the date of filing this action.
In support of this motion, the parties state the following:
1.

Plaintiff filed this purported class action pursuant to the Fair Debt

Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1692 et seq. (“FDCPA”).
2.

Plaintiff alleges that the policy and practice of Defendants to send, or

cause to be sent, letters in the form of Exhibit A seeking to collect timebarred debts
which did not disclose that the statute of limitations has expired and that
Defendants could not sue the consumer to collect the debts.
3.

All requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

have been met.
4.

Defendants have admitted that since July 21, 2013 (one year prior to

the filing date of this litigation) more than 100 persons with a Florida address were
sent a letter in the form of Exhibit A on behalf of LVNV in an attempt to collect an
alleged obligation originally due Chase Manhattan Bank on which the last payment
was made five or more years prior to the date of mailing of the letter in the form of
Exhibit A.
5.

Plaintiff alleges that there are questions of law and fact common to the
2

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 67 Filed 05/22/15 Page 3 of 6 PageID 362

class, which common issues predominate over any issues affecting only individual
class members. The factual issue common to each class member is that each was
sent a letter in the form of Exhibit A on behalf of LVNV in an attempt to collect an
alleged obligation originally due Chase Manhattan Bank on which the last payment
was made five or more years prior to the date of mailing of the letter in the form of
Exhibit A. The principal legal issue is whether Defendants’ letter in the form of
Exhibit A violated the FDCPA.
6.

There are no individual issues other than identifying class members

which may be accomplished through a review of Defendants’ records. Pursuant to
the proposed class definition all of the debts involved were incurred for personal,
family, or household purposes.
7.

Plaintiff’s claims are typical of those of the class members. All are

based on the same facts and the same legal theories.
8.

Ms. Riffle will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

She has retained counsel experienced in handling actions involving unlawful
practices under the FDCPA and class actions. Neither Plaintiff nor her counsel
have any interests which might cause them not to vigorously pursue this action.
9.

Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a

class action is a superior method for the fair and efficient adjudication of this
3

Case 6:14-cv-01181-ACC-TBS Document 67 Filed 05/22/15 Page 4 of 6 PageID 363

controversy in that:
a.

Congress specifically contemplated FDCPA class actions as a

principal means of enforcing the statute. 15 U.S.C. §1692k(a)(2)(B) and
§1692k(b)(2).
b.

Most of the class members are not aware of their rights and

have no knowledge that their rights are being violated by illegal collection
practices.
c.

The interest of class members to individually control the

litigation is small because the maximum statutory damages in an individual action
are $1,000.
d.

Management of this class action is likely to present

significantly fewer difficulties than those presented in many class claims, e.g.,
securities fraud.
10.

Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(2) and Local Rule 4.04(b) notice approved by

the Court may be given to the class members by first class U.S. Mail.
11.

These grounds are further explained and supported by the

accompanying memorandum of law.
