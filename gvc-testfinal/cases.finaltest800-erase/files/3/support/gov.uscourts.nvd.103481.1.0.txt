Case 2:14-cv-01573-RFB-VCF Document 1 Filed 09/24/14 Page 6 of 22

I.

INTRODUCTION

3

NML’s dispute with the Republic of Argentina, and more to the point, NML’s pursuit of

4

Argentina’s assets throughout the world, are now well known as regular features in major news

5

programs and publications. NML’s efforts recently brought it to Nevada, where it initially

6

pursued information and documents from many other Nevada entities.1 See NML Capital, Ltd. v.

7

The Republic of Argentina, Case No. 2:14-cv-00492-RFB-VCF. NML continues, however, to

8

ever widen the cast of its net and is now attempting to ensnare nonparty VDL.

9

In evaluating VDL’s Motion to Quash, this Court must engage in a two-step, sequential

10

analysis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 45 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 69. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a)(2) (“[T]he judgment

11

creditor … may obtain discovery from any person … as provided in these rules ...”). First, the

12

Court must examine the propriety of the discovery requests in NML’s Subpoena subject to Rule

13

69, which governs the appropriate scope of discovery in aid of execution. Id. When it comes to

14

nonparties like VDL, this discovery is restricted and can only be expanded on sufficient evidence

15

by the requesting party. See NML Capital, Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, C 12-80185 JSW MEJ,

16

2013 WL 655211 (N.D.Cal. 2013). If the Court determines that NML has not made a sufficient

17

showing to support its expansive requests, then the analysis is over and the subpoena should be

18

quashed. If the Court, however, determines that NML has made a sufficient showing to support

19

its expansive requests, then the Court should proceed to evaluate the subpoena’s compliance with

20

Rule 45, which governs the means of obtaining that discovery from nonparties. See Fed.R.Civ.P.

21

45.

22
23

As set forth in further detail below, this Court must quash NML’s subpoena to VDL for
three (3) reasons:

24

(1) NML has failed to make a sufficient showing that VDL has any connection to

25

Argentina as judgment debtor, or NML’s judgment against Argentina, and, therefore, does not

26

have an appropriate basis under Rule 69 for the wide-ranging subpoena;

27
28

1
Those proceedings against the collectively referenced “123 Entities” are currently before the District Judge on the
123 Entities’ Objection to the presiding Magistrate Judge’s order granting NML’s Motion to Compel.

1

Case 2:14-cv-01573-RFB-VCF Document 1 Filed 09/24/14 Page 7 of 22

1

(2) NML has failed to comply with Rule 45’s geographic restrictions because the

2

subpoena commands a VDL employee or agent, none of whom live, work, or regularly transact

3

business in Nevada or within 100 miles of this Court, to travel thousands of miles and appear in

4

Las Vegas for deposition; and

5

(3) NML has failed to comply with Rule 45’s prohibition against imposing undue burden

6

and expense on subpoena recipients with its kitchen sink document requests that seek the

7

disclosure of privileged or otherwise confidential and protected information.

8

As such, the subpoena must be quashed.

NML CAPITAL, LTD. (“NML”) holds judgments and claims totaling nearly $3

12

billion dollars against the REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA (“Argentina”) issued by the United

13

THE SUBPOENA

17

2.

18

See Subpoena Duces Tecum Ad

On August 27, 2014, NML served the Subpoena on VDL through VDL’s

registered agent, MF Corporate Services (Nevada) Limited. See Exhibit A.

19

3.

The Subpoena requests production of certain categories of documents set forth in

20

the Subpoena and, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 45, deposition testimony

21

by a VDL-designated representative. See Exhibit A.

22
23

4.

The Subpoena sets Las Vegas, Nevada as the place for compliance with subpoena.

See Exhibit A.

24

5.

The Subpoena also sets forth the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(3)(A) which, in

25

pertinent part, provides an issuing court must quash or modify a subpoena that:

See Exhibit A.

A.

THE SUBPOENA MUST BE QUASHED

8

1.

9

Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(d)(3) provides in pertinent part: “… the court for the district where

10

compliance is required must quash …” Id. (emphasis added). In this case, though the subpoena

11

was issued by the Southern District of New York, compliance is required in this district. See

12

Exhibit A (“commanded … to produce [in] Las Vegas … Plaintiff will take [VDL’s] deposition

13

… in Las Vegas”).

This is the proper district for VDL’s Motion to Quash

14

2.

15

Given the “Background Information” attached to the subject subpoena (and consistent

16

with its arguments in numerous other post-judgment discovery disputes), NML will likely argue

17

that Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 affords it great latitude in issuing subpoenas that it believes further its

18

interests as a valid judgment creditor.2 See NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 6552113; EM Ltd. v.

19

Republic of Argentina, 695 F.3d 201, 207 (2d Cir. 2012) cert. granted, 134 S. Ct. 895, 187 L. Ed.

2d 701 (U.S. 2014) and aff'd sub nom. Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd., 134 S. Ct.

21

2250, 189 L. Ed. 2d 234 (U.S. 2014). On closer analysis, however, this argument fails.

22

///

23

///

NML has no grounds for issuing the subpoena to VDL

24
25
26

2
VDL offers no opinion on and does not dispute the validity of NML’s judgments against Argentina. VDL simply
denies any connection to Argentina and any knowledge of any information that may assist NML in the execution of
its judgments.

Mr. Hranitzky appears to serve as counsel for NML in all of its Rule 69-related litigation, regardless of
jurisdiction. He is identified as counsel in NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211 (N.D. Ca.) as well as NML Capital,
Ltd. v. The Republic of Argentina, Case No. 2:14-cv-00492-RFB-VCF in this jurisdiction. Mr. Hranitzky also
signed the VDL subpoena at issue in this dispute. See Exhibit A.

KOLESAR & LEATHAM

2

NML has not met its burden under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 for the issuance of this
subpoena.

3

Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a)(2) provides in pertinent part: “[T]he judgment creditor … may obtain

4

discovery from any person … as provided in these rules or by the procedure of the state where

5

the court is located.” Id. This provides a generally broad scope of available discovery. Ryan

6

Inv. Corp. v. Pedregal de Cabo San Lucas, C 06-3219 JWRS, 2009 WL 5114077 (N.D. Cal.

7

Dec. 18, 2009). But that scope is not limitless. “[D]isclosure concerning the assets of a non-

8

party is generally not contemplated by Rule 69(a).” NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, *2.

9

Rather, “such discovery should only be permitted when ‘the relationship between the judgment

10

debtor and the non-party is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the bona fides of the

11

transfer of assets between them’.” Id. As to Rule 69 itself, then, there are two inquiries the

12

Court should make as to the subject subpoena: (1) whether the subpoena is narrowly tailored

13

towards information about the judgment debtor and, if not, whether the subpoena seeks

14

information about the nonparty itself (or other unrelated nonparties); and (2) the basis for

15

expanding the scope of the subpoena. In this instance, NML has exceeded the acceptable scope

16

of a Rule 69 subpoena without a reasonable basis for doing so. Therefore, the Subpoena should

17

be quashed.

18

First, the Subpoena exceeds the acceptable scope of Rule 69 discovery in seeking only

19

financial information of numerous nonparties.4 The Subpoena does not seek any information

20

pertaining to VDL’s transaction history with the judgment debtor, Argentina. See Exhibit A.

21

Because it seeks only the private and financial affairs of numerous nonparties, the Subpoena is

22

inappropriate and should be quashed. See NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, *2.

23

Second, NML has provided no basis for seeking VDL’s or any other nonparty’s own

24

information. Rule 69 provides a mechanism for a judgment creditor to inquire, both of the

25

judgment debtor itself and of nonparties, about the judgment debtor’s assets. Fed.R.Civ.P. 69;

26

see also NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, *2.

27
28

4

Besides Rule 69, the subpoena runs afoul of Rule 45. See infra.

KOLESAR & LEATHAM

Case 2:14-cv-01573-RFB-VCF Document 1 Filed 09/24/14 Page 10 of 22

1

NML would not, at this point, be permitted to inquire into any other unrelated nonparty’s

2

private and financial affairs. NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, 2 (“disclosure concerning the

3

assets of a non-party is generally not contemplated by Rule 69(a)”). The only way NML could

4

expand the scope of its subpoena to include the private and financial affairs of nonparties

5

(meaning those persons and entities other than the judgment debtor and the alter ego, if any), is

6

after sufficiently demonstrating some nefarious activities by and between those other nonparties

7

and the judgment debtor and/or alter ego. Id. (nonparty disclosures are only permitted when

8

there is “reasonable doubt about the bona fides of the transfer of assets between [the nonparty

9

and the judgment debtor or its alter ego].”).

10

This process was fully played out in a previous NML Capital matter. That case, decided

11

close to eighteen (18) months before NML issued the Subpoena to VDL, involved NML’s

12

subpoenas to Chevron and three other nonparties in enforcement of the same judgments against

13

Argentina. NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211 at *1. Those subpoenas defined Argentina to

14

include various nonparty government instrumentalities, including an entity known as “YPF.” Id.

15

NML sought Chevron’s financial dealings with YPF on the theory that YPF was an alter ego of

16

Argentina due to a recent transaction directly between YPF and Argentina. Id. at *2. The court

17

rejected NML’s arguments: “When the ground for the discovery is an alleged alter ego

18

relationship with the judgment debtor, there must be facts before the Court to show the basis for

19

the allegation.” Id. at *1. “The facts advanced by NML consist of general allegations[.]

20

Majority ownership, appointment of directors, and control of a board’s membership are all

21

insufficient to overcome the presumption of separateness[.]” The court did not permit NML to

22

expand the scope of post-judgment discovery to include prying into nonparties’ financial affairs

23

with yet another nonparty. Id. at *1.

24

As to the Subpoena in the present matter, there is not a single request regarding the actual

25

judgment debtor – Argentina. On that level alone, it is improper and should be quashed. See

26

Fed.R.Civ.P. 69; see also NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, *2. The Subpoena also does not

27

withstand Rule 69 scrutiny because it does not claim a direct relationship between VDL and

28

Argentina, and it does not claim that a single transaction of VDL’s lacks bona fides, let alone any
5

Case 2:14-cv-01573-RFB-VCF Document 1 Filed 09/24/14 Page 11 of 22

1

transaction between VDL and Argentina or any alter ego thereto. See Exhibit A, “Background

2

Information.” NML’s Subpoena, therefore, does not even satisfy the preliminary inquiry under

3

Rule 69. It certainly does not withstand scrutiny under the more nuanced alter ego / reasonable

4

doubt standards.

5

NML has offered zero evidence linking VDL to the actual judgment debtor, or any alter

6

ego of the judgment debtor. Instead, NML offers only its “Background Information” attachment,

7

which overflows with unsupported, conclusory allegations, including:


8
9

“[NML] seeks information regarding companies affiliated with an Argentine
national who owns a residence in the United States named Cristobal Lopez
(“Lopez”)” and “among these companies is an entity called Val de Loire, LLC.”5

Tel: (702) 362-7800 / Fax: (702) 362-9472

KOLESAR & LEATHAM

10
11

Notwithstanding the “Background Information” section of the Subpoena (Attachment A

12

thereto), NML fails to provide any support that Lopez is linked or affiliated with VDL. As

13

discussed in greater detail, infra, NML wrongly, and in bad faith, relies upon a supposed

14

“supplemental criminal complaint filed in Argentina against Nestor Kirchner” that alleges VDL

15

is a 35% owner of Correon SA, an entity that “partners” with Lopez’s company Casino Club SA.

16

Even if that unsupported allegation evidenced an “affiliation” with Lopez, that affiliation would

17

pertain only to two nonparties and non-judgment debtors and, therefore, have no evidentiary

18

value with respect to possible improper transactions involving the actual judgment debtor,

19

Argentina. As such, nothing about this unsupported allegation passes Rule 69 muster and

20

warrants prying into VDL’s affairs. See NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, *2.


21
22

“NML has reason to believe that an illicit relationship between Lopez, current
Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, and her late husband
Nestor Kirchner may have allowed Lopez to abscond with millions of dollars in
Argentine state assets – which are now hidden around the world.”6

23
NML’s use of the word “may” is telling. None of the articles or documents cited in the

24
25
26
27
28

Subpoena provide for a relationship between the Kirchners and Lopez. Nor do any of the articles
or documents provide any inkling that Lopez has absconded with any Argentine assets. NML

See Exhibit A.

NML provides no evidence that Lopez is affiliated with VDL. A subsequent allegation
provides that VDL may have entered into a lone agreement with Balmont Holdings, LLC, a
Nevada limited liability company to which NML has previously issued a subpoena for
documents. Even taken in the light most favorable to NML, however, this “fact,” taken out of its

“Documents produced to NML by MF Corporate Services (Nevada) Ltd. (“MF

periodically does business with some of the 123 shell corporations linked to
[Lazaro] Baez.”7

“Lopez has also been tied to Nevada shell company called Centenary
International Corp.”8

NML’s reference to Centenary International Corp. (“Centenary”) is confusing. True,
Centenary is a Nevada corporation whose mission is to develop an energy business, with a
primary focus in oil and gas exploration.

Yes, Lopez appears to own a 24% interest in

Centenary. That company, however, is not under investigation nor has previously been accused
of any wrongdoing. See Exhibit A, at n. 4. That company also has no connection to VDL. Id. It
also has no apparent connection to Argentina as judgment debtor. Id. Any attempt to draw a
nefarious connection between Argentina and VDL via Centenary or any entity affiliated with
Centenary is a dead end. Nothing about this unsupported allegation supports NML’s use of

Again, NML resorts to pure conjecture. There has been no showing that Baez controlled
or was otherwise affiliated with any of the previously subpoenaed entities. Moreover, NML has
not provided the Court with the correspondence from the MF Nevada representative as alleged in
the Subpoena. Even in the light most favorable for NML, however, the correspondence – if true
– evidences nothing more than a lone transaction between Balmont Holdings and VDL, neither
of which are parties and neither of which are the pertinent judgment debtor (Argentina) or alter
egos thereof. Nothing about this unsupported allegation supports NML’s misuse of Fed.R.Civ.P.

NML’s subpoena exceeds the limited scope of Rule 69
discovery as it relates to nonparties.

5

As noted above (p. 6 ll. 17-21), besides failing to connect the subpoenaed party (VDL) to

6

the actual judgment debtor (Argentina), the Subpoena is defective under Rule 69 because it seeks

7

nothing related to the judgment debtor. It is clear that NML included the definition “Argentina”

8

to mask its inquiry into nonparties as one involving the judgment debtor. However, only one (1)

9

of the sixteen (16) requests uses that term. In stark contrast, fifteen (15) of the sixteen (16)

10

requests are directed at the private and financial affairs of “the Persons identified in Attachment

11

C.” None of those persons is Argentina. All of those “Persons” (17 individuals and 6 entities)

12

are nonparties and there is no disputing that point. VDL is also a nonparty and there is no

13

disputing that point.

14

“[D]isclosure concerning the assets of a non-party is generally not contemplated by Rule

15

69(a).” NML Capital, Ltd., 2013 WL 655211, *2. This is a simple statement of the law. NML

16

simply cannot directly inquire about the private and financial affairs of any of the “Persons” in

Attachment C. Id. Inserting VDL into the equation does not change the ultimate fact that the

subpoena seeks nonparty financial information and, therefore, is inappropriate. Id. This Court

NML’s document requests subject VDL to undue burden in

7

NML’s subpoena also commands VDL to produce documents in response to sixteen (16)

categories. Because the subpoena never should have issued in the first place based on the lack of

13

Only by quashing the Subpoena can this Court avoid undue burden being imposed on VDL.

Notwithstanding that threshold question regarding whether the Subpoena should have

the court recognized; no company, having a choice, would permit
another company to go on a fishing expedition through its records.

In this instance, NML is one step further removed than the issuing party in the Sperry &

18

Hutchinson Co. case as it is not even seeking information directly pertaining to its

19

defendant/judgment debtor, Argentina. Requiring VDL to respond to such a large number of

20

overly-expansive requests pertaining to such a large number of discrete “Persons” with no

21

seeming connection to or stake in the underlying litigation between NML and Argentina would

22

be unduly burdensome on VDL. Id.; see Convolve, Inc. v. Dell, Inc., 2011 WL 1766486, *2

23

(N.D.Cal.); see also In re NCAA Student–Athlete Name & Likeness Licensing Litigation, Nos.

09-cv-01967 CW (NC), 11-mc-80020 CW (NC, 2012 WL 4846522 (N.D.Cal.) (“The Ninth

25

Circuit has long held that nonparties subject to discovery requests deserve extra protection from

26

the courts.”).

27

The motion should be granted and the subpoena quashed.

The subpoena’s document requests are also objectionable
on other grounds.

VDL also objects to numerous other aspects of the subpoena’s document requests,
including, but not limited to, the 16 specific categories. VDL’s general objections include:
 VDL objects to the “Background Information” document in its entirety, but in
particular all general allegations regarding VDL’s connections to either Lopez,
Baez, or any other person or entity purportedly involved in the alleged (and as yet
unproven) embezzlement scheme on hearsay, foundation, and relevance grounds.
 VDL objects to Instructions 1, 5, and 10 as being overbroad in demanding
duplicative productions.
 VDL objects to Instructions 1, 4, 5, and 10, and Requests 1, 2, 5 – 7, 11, 13, and
15 as seeking the production of attorney-client privileged and/or work-product
protected documents.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Aggressive pursuit of one’s judgment debtor is fine, perhaps even laudable. Running
roughshod over the rules of civil procedure and attempting to bully uninterested nonparties,
however, is plain wrong. Rules 45 and 69 each provide this Court with independent bases for
quashing this Subpoena in its entirety and VDL respectfully requests this Court do so.
