PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

100 North City Parkway, Suite 1600
Las Vegas, NV 89106-4614
702.382.2101

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP

1

Plaintiff NML Capital, Ltd. (“NML”) holds judgments against the Republic of Argentina

3

(“Argentina”) totaling more than $1.7 billion. To avoid its payment obligations, Argentina has

4

engaged in elaborate mechanisms to shield its assets from creditors. EM Ltd. v. Republic of

5

Argentina, 720 F. Supp. 2d 273, 279-80 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), vacated on other grounds, 652 F.3d

6

172 (2d Cir. 2011). Argentina’s bad faith towards its creditors and disrespect for the authority of

7

the United States courts has left NML with little choice but to track Argentina’s assets around the

8

world and attempt to execute on them as local laws permit. Id.

9

To be sure, many of NML’s post-judgment enforcement and discovery efforts have not

10

been run-of-the-mill. But that is purely the consequence of Argentina’s extraneous behavior.

11

Recognizing this fact, the federal district judge in Manhattan who has presided over Argentina’s

12

debt default litigation for the last 12 years has endorsed NML’s broad and sometimes

13

unconventional discovery initiatives as fully consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

14

69(a)(2) in which governs post-judgment discovery. In the words of that Court, “plaintiffs in

15

these actions should be allowed some liberality in exploring means of enforcing their judgments

16

… [a]nd I do not intend to take a narrow view when it comes to dealing with attempts to enforce

17

the judgments.”1 The information sought through the Subpoena easily meets that standard. Val

18

de Loire’s motion should thus be denied, and it should be compelled to comply fully with the

19

Subpoena.

20

In this matter, NML served the Subpoena on Val de Loire, a Nevada LLC, by service

21

upon Val de Loire’s registered agent, M.F. Corporate Services (Nevada) Limited (“MF

22

Nevada”).2 As explained in the “Background Information” in Attachment A of the Subpoena,

23

NML targeted Val de Loire due to its connections to two Argentine nationals—Cristobal López

24

(“López”) and Lázaro Baéz (“Baéz”)—who are confidantes of Argentine President Cristina

25

Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband Néstor Kirchner.

Case 2:14-cv-01573-RFB-VCF Document 8 Filed 10/09/14 Page 7 of 31

1

NML has reason to believe that both López and Baéz may have misappropriated and

2

embezzled tens of millions (if not more) of Argentine state funds in part, through shell companies

3

like Val de Loire.

4

journalistic investigations within Argentina examining indications that they unlawfully exploited

5

their close relationship with the Kirchners, the President and former President of Argentina, to

6

enrich themselves. If convicted, any funds traceable to such behavior could become the property

7

of Argentina and therefore potentially available to satisfy NML’s judgments against Argentina.

López and Baéz have both been the subject of multiple criminal and

8

Val de Loire is a shell corporation established under Nevada law that is affiliated with

9

López and his gaming interests—interests that he owes the Kirchner regime. Val de Loire and

10

López appear to be linked to both Baéz and to an array of shell companies established for Baéz’s

11

benefit—123 of which are Nevada companies that have already been the subject of discovery (the

12

“Baéz Entities”). In discovery proceedings earlier this year, this Court held that NML had valid

13

grounds for subpoenaing the Baéz Entities due to the suggestion of those entities’ ties to the

14

alleged embezzlement scheme. NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, No. 2:14-cv-492-

15

RFB-VCF, 2014 WL 3898021, at *4-8 (D. Nev. Aug. 11, 2014) (“NML Capital”).

16

Having learned of Val de Loire’s connections to López, Baéz, the Kirchners, their

17

associates, and the Baéz entities, NML subpoenaed Val de Loire for documents concerning those

18

entities. The Subpoena does not, as Val de Loire suggests, seek every Val de Loire document that

19

relates to “every individual or entity whose name pops up on a Google search for ‘Argentina’ and

20

‘Kirchner.’” Mot. at 7. Instead, the Subpoena asks for information relating to just 18 individuals

21

(López, Baéz, the Kirchners, and a handful of their family members and business associates) and

22

6 companies (all connected to López or Baéz). See Ex. B at 14-15.

23

entities, the Subpoena seeks discrete types of information—principally information about funds

24

transfers, business operations, and assets. Id. at 10-11.

For those persons and

25

Val de Loire’s Motion grossly mischaracterizes both the law and the facts. Val de Loire

26

fails to even to mention—much less distinguish—Magistrate Judge Ferenbach’s Order or the

27

numerous cases on which Magistrate Judge Ferenbach rightly relied in determining that NML

28

was entitled to discovery from third-party shell companies in very similar circumstances. Instead,

Case 2:14-cv-01573-RFB-VCF Document 8 Filed 10/09/14 Page 8 of 31

1

Val de Loire rehashes the same erroneous arguments this Court has already rejected. Val de

2

Loire relies upon a single case—a two-page California magistrate judge discovery order—that

3

arose in the context of discovery from a third-party concerning the assets and activities a

4

sovereign instrumentality. Val de Loire misconstrues that order and suggests that it held that

5

Rule 69 imposes a stringent standard for discovery sought from third-parties (which is not the

6

law), when in fact the California magistrate judge denied the requested discovery only to the

7

extent NML sought information about the assets of presumptively separate instrumentalities of

8

Argentina without first showing that those instrumentalities were alter egos of Argentina. What

9

Val de Loire leaves out is that the same Court interpreting the same subpoena ruled that NML is

10

entitled to broad discovery of potential assets of Argentina itself—and that order was

11

subsequently affirmed by the District Court Judge Jeffrey S. White.3 The order Val de Loire

12

misleadingly cites is inapposite to the Subpoena at issue here, in which NML seeks to trace the

13

fruits of criminal activity that, if such activity results in a conviction, would revert directly to

14

Argentina—not any Argentine instrumentality.

15

Val de Loire also mischaracterizes the facts. Val de Loire protests that NML has not

16

established a direct relationship between it and the judgment debtor Argentina, but it largely

17

ignores NML’s fundamental contention: that it is investigating the assets, transactions, and

18

structure of Val de Loire and its connections to López, Baéz, and other shell companies

19

established to facilitate the potential misappropriation and embezzlement of Argentine state

20

funds.

21

Val de Loire accuses NML of engaging in a “grand fishing expedition,” but the law is

22

clear that while “Rule 69 discovery can indeed resemble the proverbial fishing expedition, . . . a

23

judgment creditor is entitled to fish for assets of the judgment debtor.” Ryan Inv. Corp. v.

24

Pedregal de Cabo San Lucas, No. C. 06-3219 JW (RS), 2009 WL 5114077, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec.

18, 2009) (internal quotation and omitted) (emphasis retained). No doubt Val de Loire (and the

1

people behind it) have their own reasons for wishing that NML not fish through its structure,

2

assets, and transactions related to the alleged embezzlement network. But the desire to keep

3

secrets does not immunize Val de Loire from the broad, permissive post-judgment discovery

4

allowed under Rule 69. If Val de Loire has no documents that relate to any such embezzlement,

5

then complying with the Subpoena will do it no harm. Indeed, even though compliance with the

6

Subpoena would not be unduly burdensome for Val de Loire, NML is willing to resolve any

7

conceivable burden by paying Val de Loire’s reasonable costs of producing responsive

8

documents.

9

NML has no interest in wasting its time or resources with discovery aimed at persons or

10

entities with no suspected connection to Argentina or its assets. NML only pursues discovery

11

when, as here, it has a reasonable belief that the information sought may assist in its post-

12

judgment discovery efforts. The information sought through the Subpoena easily meets that

13

standard. Val de Loire’s motion should thus be denied, and it should be compelled to comply

14

fully with the Subpoena.

Cristobal López

24

Cristobal López is an Argentine national who has amassed a controversial fortune in the

25

gambling and hydrocarbon industries, among others, during the Presidencies of Néstor and

26

Cristina Kirchner. López has been the subject of multiple criminal and journalistic investigations

27

within Argentina since Néstor Kirchner became President of Argentina in 2003. Virtually all of

28

these investigations involve allegations that he improperly benefitted from his relationship with
016887\0001\11621913.1

1

former Argentine President Néstor Kirchner to enrich himself at the expense of the Argentine

2

state.4 The accusations center on López’s improper and potentially illegal acquisition of lucrative

3

hydrocarbon and gambling concessions.5 López appears to hold many of his assets through his

4

Nevada shell corporation, Centenary International Corp.6

5

More recently, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corrál opened a formal investigation

6

into two of López’s casino operations for defrauding the government, colluding with public

7

officials to violate the requirements of their positions, and tax evasion.7 Judge Canicoba Corrál

In the NML Capital proceedings before this Court, NML has already shown the

14

the widely reported embezzlement of Argentine assets. See generally NML Capital, 2014 WL

[I]n April 2013, the Argentine government initiated an investigation, dubbed La
Ruta Del Dinero K (i.e., “the K Money Trail”), into Argentina’s former president,
Néstor Kirchner, his wife, current Argentine President Cristina Fernández de

On August 27, 2014, NML served the Subpoena on Val de Loire through its registered

asks Val de Loire for information relating specifically to 18 individuals (López, Baéz, the
Kirchners, and a handful of their family members and business associates) and 6 companies (all
connected to López or Baéz). Ex. B (Subpoena at 14-15). For those persons and entities, the

business operations and assets. Id. at 10-11.

The Subpoena And Val de Loire’s Refusal To Meet And Confer In Good Faith.

On September 24, 2014, through the same counsel who represents the Baéz Entities, Val
de Loire moved to quash. It did so without making any effort at all to meet and confer in good
faith with NML, as required by Local Rule 26-7(b). When NML raised that concern after
receiving the Motion, Val de Loire agreed to a belated meet and confer with NML on October 1,
2014. In that discussion, however, Val de Loire’s counsel refused to withdraw the Motion
pending further discussions, declined to engage in any substantive discussion of the context of the
Subpoena or the authority on which NML relies, and was unwilling to consider any compromise
to avoid burdening this Court.

This Court Has Broad Discretion Under Rule 69(a)(2)
To Permit Third-Party Discovery That May Reveal The
Identity and Location Of Potentially Attachable Assets.

10

Rule 69(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs discovery in proceedings

11

involving the enforcement of a judgment. Under that rule, a judgment creditor is entitled to

12

obtain discovery from “any person” relating to the judgment debtor’s assets “wherever located,”

13

including “outside the jurisdiction of the court where the discovery request is made.” EM Ltd.,

14

(“NML Capital”). Rule 69(a)(2) entitles a judgment creditor “to identify assets that can be used

17

to satisfy a judgment” and “to discover concealed or fraudulently transferred assets.” VFS Fin.,

246, 250 (11th Cir. 1982) (“judgment creditor is entitled to discover the identity and location of

21

any of the judgment debtor’s assets, wherever located.”). As a result, discovery under Rule 69 is

26

The liberal standard for post-judgment discovery applies with equal force to discovery

sought from third-parties. Rule 69(a)(2) expressly permits discovery from “any person,” and

NML is entitled to discovery because it has made a threshold showing that connects Val
de Loire to a web of shell companies associated with a suspected scheme to embezzle Argentine
assets—assets that NML could potentially attach in satisfaction of its judgments. NML meets
that threshold under either federal common law (showing the relevance of asset transfers
involving Val de Loire) or Nevada law (asserting “specific, articulable facts” supporting the
inference of how Val de Loire has information concerning the embezzlement scheme).

As detailed above, see supra at Part I, and in the “Background Information” to the
Subpoena, NML has reason to believe that an illicit relationship among López and the Kirchners
may have allowed López to misappropriate millions of dollars in Argentine state assets—assets
that are now hidden around the world.

Numerous Argentine criminal and journalistic

investigations have targeted López’s activities and his allegedly improper benefits from his

relationship with the Kirchners since Néstor Kirchner became Argentina’s president in 2003.

2

Accusations have centered on López’s improper and potentially illegal acquisition of lucrative

3

hydrocarbon and gambling concessions. For example, Argentine judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral

4

recently opened a formal investigation into two of López’s casino operations for defrauding the

government, tax evasion, and colluding with public officials to violate the requirements of their

positions.

Val de Loire is a shell company affiliated with López.

Val de Loire is a holding company that owns 35% of Correon SA, which partners with a

10

López-owned company, Casino Club SA, in gambling projects that have been tainted by

11

widespread allegations of political corruption. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission records

14

Val de Loire and López are both linked to Lázaro Baéz.

15

Baéz is currently under investigation by Argentine prosecutors for embezzling over $65

16

million of state funds out of Argentina through companies in Nevada and elsewhere. In the Baéz

17

proceedings, this Court has already held that NML had valid grounds for subpoenaing Nevada

18

entities concerning the Baéz Entities.

19

In response to a subpoena served by NML last year, MF Nevada (the registered agent for

20

both Val de Loire and the Baéz Entities) produced documents that reveal that the López-linked

21

Val de Loire at least periodically does business with some of the Baéz Entities. 21 Further,

22

documents produced by MF Nevada suggest that the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca &

23

Co. represents either Val de Loire or the individuals and entities behind it. Mossack Fonseca is

24

known for incorporating shell companies. NML Capital, 2014 WL 3898021, at *2.22

As this Court discussed, there are ample facts that suggest that Mossack & Fonseca controls the 123 Báez

13
Just as in NML Capital, in which this Court found that NML had met the requisite
14
threshold showing with respect to the Baéz Entities (see id.), NML has shown here: (1) that
15

López’s alleged money laundering activities involved a Nevada shell company (in this case, Val

16
de Loire); (2) that the shell company at issue concededly has no offices, businesses, or personnel
17
in Nevada (see Sept. 25, 2014 Decl. of Edmund Ward for Use in Support of Nonparty Val de
18

Loire, LLC’s Mot. to Quash Subpoena or, in the Alternative, for Protective Order); and (3) that

MF Nevada and Val de Loire are shell companies controlled by Mossack & Fonseca, which is
20
based in Panama, where Argentine investigators have alleged that Baéz hid embezzled funds (see

This Court also noted that the Báez Entities had the same managers who shared an office in Seychelles. Id.
at *5. NML only had that information because in the Báez proceedings, MF Nevada produced some documents
responsive to the subpoena served upon it. NML now seeks the same type of information, which would further
NML’s investigation, would help complete NML’s factual understanding of the embezzlement scheme and the

NML had satisfied its threshold showing under Nevada law. Id. at *5.25

Notably, Val de Loire has not claimed that it has no responsive documents. Although Val

5

de Loire argues that there is no connection between it and Argentina directly, Val de Loire never

6

denies that it possesses documents concerning the 18 persons and 6 entities associated with

7

López, Baéz, the Kirchners, and the Baéz Entities. Val de Loire’s non-denial suggests that it does

have possession, custody, or control of such documents.26

Loire chooses to entirely ignore Magistrate Judge Ferenbach’s thoughtful order—despite its
obvious relationship to the Subpoena at issue here.27
Rather than addressing NML Capital and the numerous cases upon which it relied, Val de

14
15
16
17
18
19
20

Loire relies entirely on a two-page magistrate judge discovery order from a different
jurisdiction—a decision that arose in the context of discovery served concerning the assets and
activities a sovereign instrumentality that the magistrate judge there determined warranted a
heightened threshold for discovery. See NML Capital, Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, C 12-80185
JSW (MEJ), 2013 WL 655211, at *1-2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2013) (the “California Magistrate
Order”).28 In that case, NML sought to compel Chevron to produce documents relating to a

21
22
23
24

companies used to further it, and in turn might to lead to the discovery of attachable assets.
25

NML Capital did not address whether NML had met the threshold showing under federal common law. Id.

26

See Pham v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2:11-cv-01148-KJD-GWF, 2012 WL 3730565, at *2 (D. Nev. Aug. 28,
2012) (“Documents that are in the actual possession of a third person are deemed to be in the responding party’s
control if [the responding party] has the legal right to obtain them.”) (citations omitted) (insertion in original).

28

Val de Loire’s failure to mention Magistrate Judge Ferenbach’s order is an omission of choice—not of mere
oversight—because counsel for Val de Loire was also counsel for the objecting Baez Entities who appeared before
Magistrate Judge Ferenbach.
28

Val de Loire fails to mention that the California Magistrate Order is on appeal to the District Court for the
Northern District of California. Regardless, even in the unlikely event that the opinion is upheld on appeal, the
California Magistrate Order does not apply outside of the context of discovery served concerning a sovereign
instrumentality, and it certainly does not bind this Court.

sovereign instrumentality of Argentina. Id. at *1. The magistrate judge held not only that NML

2

had to make a “threshold showing” that those entities were alter egos of Argentina, but also that

3

NML had to “overcome the presumption” that a foreign state instrumentality is independent from

4

the state. Id. at *2 (citing First Nat’l City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462

5

U.S. 611, 627 (1983) (“Bancec”)). The California Magistrate Order did not hold, as Val de Loire

6

misrepresents (see Motion at 4-5), that NML had failed to make a showing that the

7

instrumentality and Argentina were related. Rather, it held that NML had not “overcome the

8

presumption that [the instrumentality] is a separate juridicial entity for purposes of asset

9

discovery.” 2013 WL 655211, at *2.

11

“overcome the presumption” that a foreign state instrumentality is independent from the State, it

12

granted NML’s other discovery requests. In granting NML’s post-judgment discovery seeking

13

information concerning Chevron’s dealings with Argentina, the Court noted that “[i]t is not

14

uncommon to seek asset discovery from third parties that possess information pertaining to the

15

judgment debtor’s assets … [n]or is it unusual for the judgment creditor to seek disclosure related

16

to assets held outside the jurisdiction of the court where the discovery request is made.”29

17

Therefore, “NML may properly seek disclosure from Chevron related to [Argentina’s] assets.”

18

Id. at 3. District Court Judge Jeffrey S. White for the Northern District of California subsequently

19

affirmed the order permitting NML to obtain discovery from Chevron.30

20

In addition to misconstruing the California Magistrate Order and ignoring the applicable

21

law concerning judgment creditors’ rights to broad post-judgment discovery, Val de Loire

22

selectively quotes and attacks NML’s Subpoena and Background Information while failing to

23

mention the most critical aspect of NML’s claims: Val de Loire’s connections to embezzled

24

Argentine funds. The Motion criticizes NML’s inability to demonstrate a direct connection

25

between Val de Loire and the Republic of Argentina (see generally Mot. at 5-13 (stressing that

“there is not a single request regarding the actual judgment debtor—Argentina.”)), but Val de

Loire either misunderstands or misconstrues NML’s rationale for seeking discovery. NML is not

claiming that Argentina directly funds or transacts business with Val de Loire; NML contends—

4

and cites evidence suggesting—that Val de Loire is one of numerous shell companies (in Nevada

5

and elsewhere) linked to an embezzlement scheme designed to misappropriate Argentine state

6

funds and shelter those assets around the world.

7

misappropriation of state funds, Argentina’s property—not the property of any presumptively

made a threshold showing that Val de Loire is connected to this scheme, and it is entitled to

Producing Responsive Documents Would Not
Impose Any Undue Burden On Val de Loire.

12
NML is willing to pay Val de Loire’s reasonable costs of complying with the Subpoena—

13
14
15
16

and would have offered to do so if Val de Loire had been willing to meet and confer in good faith.
That willingness resolves any conceivable burden on Val de Loire for producing documents to
NML.
Even if that were not the case, NML’s subpoena does not impose an undue burden on Val

de Loire. “The mere fact that discovery requires work and may be time consuming is not
sufficient to establish undue burden.” Platinum Air Charters, LLC v. Aviation Ventures, Inc., No.
2:05-cv-01451-RCJ-LRL, 2007 WL 121674, at *6 (D. Nev. Jan. 10, 2007); see also NML
Capital, 2014 WL 3898021, at *6-7 (rejecting the Baéz Entities’ argument that responding to
NML’s subpoenas would be unduly burdensome). NML has a good faith basis to believe that Val
de Loire is in possession of information that could lead to attachable assets in satisfaction of its
judgments against Argentina. This is sufficient to require Val de Loire to comply with the
Subpoena.31 See Mount Hope Church v. Bash Back!, 705 F.3d 418, 429 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[W]e

In addition, Val de Loire only makes generalized objections and does not specify exactly how complying
with NML’s subpoena would impose an undue burden. See Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Rebel Oil. Co., Inc., 157

do not think that the mere need to respond to an opponent’s advocacy in our civil justice system

2

should be viewed as unduly burdensome when legal arguments are advanced in good faith.”).

3

Finally, although Val de Loire complains that NML’s requests are not limited to a

4

particular time frame and in some instances cover an overly broad subject matter (see Motion at

5

15-16), Val de Loire has refused to suggest what it would view as a more reasonable scope for

6

responsive documents. That is precisely the type of discussion that the parties could have had (if

7

Val de Loire had been willing) during a meet and confer, and NML remains willing to discuss

8

reasonable suggestions to narrow any remaining disputes with Val de Loire.

Any Concerns By Val de Loire Concerning The Need To Protect
Privileged Or Confidential Information Can Be Addressed With An
Appropriate Confidentiality Agreement And The Use Of A Privilege Log.

11

NML is perfectly willing to enter an appropriate confidentially agreement to protect

12

against the dissemination of Val de Loire’s confidential information. See Mot. at 2. Again, that

13

is precisely the type of concern that Val de Loire could have discussed in a meet and confer rather

14

than raising it with this Court.

15

Any concerns Val de Loire may have about protecting privileged documents (see Motion

16

at 2, 17) can of course be addressed by Val de Loire’s production of an appropriate privilege

17

log—a routine practice that, again, need not have been raised as part of a motion to quash.

20

II.

This Court Has the Authority to Order Val de Loire to Identify
and Designate Individuals Within the Court’s Jurisdiction to
Appear for a Deposition or Educate a Witness to Appear.

21

Rule 30(b)(6) requires a subpoenaed entity to “produce one or more witnesses

22

knowledgeable about the subject matter” in the subpoena. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Vegas

23

Const. Co., Inc., 251 F.R.D. 534, 538 (D. Nev. 2008). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

24

however, do not require the witness to “have personal knowledge on the designated subject

25

matter.” Id. Instead, a subpoenaed entity has “a duty to make a conscientious, good-faith effort

26

to designate knowledgeable persons for Rule 30(b)(6) depositions and to prepare them to fully

27

and unevasively answer questions about the designated subject matter.” Id. at 539 (internal

quotation marks omitted). “The fact that [the subpoenaed organization] may no longer employ a

2

person with knowledge on the designated topics did not relieve it of the duty to prepare a properly

3

educated Rule 30(b)(6) designee.” Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 251 F.R.D. at 541.

4

If no employee, representative, or agent of Val de Loire with knowledge of the matters

5

contained in the deposition notice resides or regularly conducts business within a 100-mile radius

6

of Las Vegas, then the Court has the power to compel Val de Loire under Rule 30(b)(6) to

7

designate a representative within 100 miles of Las Vegas and to educate that person concerning

8

the subjects set forth in the deposition notice.

9

This Court has already analyzed this precise issue and held that third-party shell

10

companies established under Nevada law with a registered agent located in Nevada through

11

which they can be served with process (like Val de Loire) can be ordered to sit for a deposition in

12

Nevada. NML Capital, 2014 WL 3898021, at *11-12 (acting pursuant to its inherent power to

13

enforce judgments under Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and ordering the Baéz

14

Entities to produce a witness for a deposition despite having no persons within a 100-mile radius

15

of the district court). Once again, Val de Loire fails to distinguish or to even mention Magistrate

16

Judge Ferenbach’s order.

17

Similarly, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York recently

18

addressed the requirement that a subpoenaed non-party must educate a witness to testify on its

19

behalf at a deposition. In Wultz v. Bank of China Ltd., 298 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), a bank in

20

Israel moved to quash a third-party subpoena seeking deposition testimony under Rule 30(b)(6),

21

arguing that it employed no knowledgeable employees in the forum and that educating an in-

22

forum employee was “simply not reasonable or practicable.” Id. at 99. The court denied the

23

bank’s motion to quash, reasoning that “[e]ven if [the Israeli bank] is a non-party witness and all

24

of the documents or knowledgeable persons are in Jerusalem, compliance with the 30(b)(6)

25

subpoena is not an undue burden when weighed against” the parties’ need for the testimony. Id.

26

An in-forum representative could “easily be educated” by a person knowledgeable about the

27

topics by “telephone, email or videoconference,” and the bank could “avoid the burden of

28

educating a[n] [in-forum] employee altogether by agreeing to a deposition by video.” Id.

1

As in NML Capital and Wultz, this Court may require Val de Loire to designate a

2

representative to testify at a deposition concerning the subjects of the subpoena. Wultz, 298

3

F.R.D. at 99. If Val de Loire has no employees, representatives or other agents within the district

4

who are knowledgeable about the subjects of the subpoena, Val de Loire has a duty to educate a

5

representative to appear for a deposition. Id.

6

Although Val de Loire (an entity organized under the laws of Nevada) claims that no

7

authorized representative resides, is employed, or regularly conducts business in person within

8

100 miles of Las Vegas (Ward Decl. ¶¶ 5-7), several individuals and entities affiliated with Val

9

de Loire may satisfy the geographic limitations for a deposition. For example, MF Nevada is

10

located in Las Vegas and serves as the registered agent for Val de Loire. In addition, Mossack

11

Fonseca & Co. markets its Nevada SPV-creation services on its corporate website, which

12

suggests that representatives from Mossack Fonseca may visit Nevada to conduct business on a

13

regular basis. Moreover, counsel for Val de Loire may be an appropriate deponent, should no

14

other suitable representative exist. See Shelton v. Am. Motor Corp., 805 F.2d 1323 (8th Cir.

15

1986) (a court may order counsel to appear as a witness upon a showing of no other means to

16

obtain the requested information, and that the information is crucial to the requesting party’s

17

case); Couturier v. Am. Invsco Corp., No. 2:12-cv-01104-APG-NJK, 2013 WL 4499008, at *1

18

(D. Nev. Aug. 20, 2013) (same).

19

Regardless of whom Val de Loire chooses as its representative, requiring Val de Loire to

20

educate a witness within the Court’s jurisdiction does not impose an undue burden. It “is merely

21

the result of the concomitant obligation from the privilege of being able to use the

22

[organizational] form in order to conduct business.” See Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 251 F.R.D.

23

at 540; see also S.E.C. v. Banc de Binary, Case No. 2:13-cv-00993-RCJ-VCF, 2014 WL

26

would be fundamentally inequitable.”); Less v. Taber Instrument Corp., 53 F.R.D. 645, 646

4

Finally, the cases that Val de Loire cites for the proposition that Rule 45 requires this

Court to quash NML’s subpoena are inapposite. In those cases, either: (a) the subpoenaed non-

6

party did not reside in the forum state; or (b) there was another jurisdiction within the United
