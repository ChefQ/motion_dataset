PETITIONER’S RESPONSE TO
RESPONDENTS’ MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE KEITH P. ELLISON:
Gregg Carl Baird files Petitioner’s Response To Respondents’ Motions For
Summary Judgment, and would show as follows:
I.
THIS CASE AROSE IN BRAZOS COUNTY, NOT HARRIS COUNTY
Respondent Jenkins incorrectly asserts that petitioner’s judgment arises out
of Harris County (Doc. 8 at 2). Petitioner was convicted out of the 272nd District
Court of Brazos County (1 C.R. 87-91), which respondent McGuire recognizes
(Doc. 11 at 2). Either way, the parties agree that this Court has jurisdiction.

II.
LAWRENCE v. TEXAS APPLIES TO THE PUNISHMENT STAGE
Petitioner alleges that the admission of evidence of constitutionally protected
sexual conduct at the punishment stage of his criminal trial violated his federal
constitutional right to due process and was contrary to or involved an unreasonable
application of Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003); Zant v. Stephens, 462
U.S. 862, 885 (1983); and Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. 159, 166-69 (1992)
(Doc. 1 at 7, 12, 16-18, 20-24).
In Lawrence, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the Texas penal
statute prohibiting and penalizing sodomoy. The Court also announced a broader
scope of substantive due process as it relates to private sexual behavior and
instructed States not to infringe on such conduct unless it injures a person or
abuses an institution that the law protects. 539 U.S. at 567. Although Lawrence
certainly did not sanction all sexual conduct, it clearly established, as a matter of
federal constitutional law, that most consensual sexual conduct among adults—
even if outside the scope of what society deems normal, including homosexual
conduct—enjoys a protected liberty interest free from governmental intrusion and
criminal punishment.
The respondents disagree with petitioner’s application of Lawrence. Jenkins
asserts that Lawrence “has never been extended to the punishment stage of trial”

2

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 3 of 10

(Doc. 8 at 1, 12).1 However, petitioner does not seek an “extension” of Lawrence
to the punishment stage. To the contrary, the holding of Lawrence already applies
to the punishment stage, and it would be absurd to conclude otherwise. Petitioner
cannot envision the case that “extends” Lawrence to the punishment stage where
the Supreme Court has held that a person cannot even be prosecuted for engaging
in homosexual conduct. If one cannot be convicted of committing a homosexual
act, then ipso facto he cannot be punished for same. No case would reach the
Supreme Court in the procedural posture of presenting this question.
Lawrence already applies to the punishment stage based on the holdings of
Zant v. Stephens and Dawson v. Delaware (Doc. 1 at 16-18, 20-24). Specifically,
the Supreme Court has clearly established, as matters of federal law, that a
sentence must be vacated where a court takes constitutionally impermissible
factors into account as a basis to impose the sentence, Zant, 462 U.S. at 885; and
that the First Amendment prevents a State from “employing evidence of a
defendant’s abstract beliefs at a sentencing hearing when those beliefs have no
bearing on the issue being tried.” Dawson, 503 U.S. at 168. The collective
holdings of Zant and Dawson clearly establish that a person cannot be punished for
constitutionally protected conduct that is unrelated to the offense of conviction. A
federal habeas petitioner may rely on any Supreme Court decision that certain

Respondent McGuire adopts Jenkins’s arguments on this point (Doc. 11 at 9).

3

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 4 of 10

conduct is constitutionally protected, and then ask that a state court sentence be
vacated where the sentencer considered such conduct when assessing punishment.
Under the AEDPA framework, this Court must ask whether the state court decision
was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of Lawrence, Zant, and
Dawson, considered collectively.
Jenkins wants this Court to excuse the state court’s failure to apply this
federal law to petitioner’s case (Doc. 8 at 14). Jenkins weakly contends that the
state court “did, in fact, cite Dawson.” However, the extent of the state court’s
acknowledgment of Dawson was in a string citation. See Baird v. State, 379
S.W.3d 353, 359-60 (Tex. App.—Waco 2012, pet. granted).

The state court

focused only on the limitation of the holding of Dawson—that “the Constitution
does not erect a per se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one’s
beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and associations
are protected by the First Amendment.” 503 U.S. at 165. But the state court
totally ignored the general rule of Dawson—that the First Amendment prevents a
State from using evidence of a defendant’s constitutionally protected beliefs at the
punishment stage when those beliefs are unrelated to the offense of conviction.
And the state court neither cited nor discussed Zant, even though petitioner relied
on it in his brief on direct appeal.
Jenkins wants this Court to excuse these glaring omissions by the state court.

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 5 of 10

The best argument that he can make is a conclusory one, that the state court was
“aware of” the applicable federal law:
In short, the Baird court was aware of both Lawrence and
Dawson. It cannot be faulted to [sic] for failing to extend
Lawrence[,] nor can it be faulted for failing to apply
Dawson.
(Doc. 8 at 14). Being “aware of” clearly established federal law falls well short of
the AEDPA mandate that the state court reasonably apply such law. Here, the state
court decision involved an unreasonable application of Lawrence, Zant, and
Dawson. That trilogy collectively held that a sentence must be vacated where the
sentencer considered, as a basis to impose the sentence, the defendant’s
constitutionally protected homosexual conduct, which was unrelated to the offense
of conviction. The state court utterly failed to apply that federal law.
Furthermore, because these three cases clearly established this proposition
years ago, petitioner is not asking for a new rule of constitutional law. Jenkins
contends that the requested relief is barred by Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989)
(Doc. 8 at 15). However, Teague does not apply because petitioner does not ask
this Court to break any new ground, impose any new obligation on the States or
federal government, or issue a decision that was not dictated by precedent existing
when his conviction became final. Zant was decided in 1983, Dawson in 1992,
and Lawrence in 2003. Petitioner’s conviction became final in 2013. Accordingly,
the collective effect of those decisions had been clearly established federal law for

5

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 6 of 10

a decade when his conviction became final. He merely asks that this established
law be applied to a set of facts different from those which gave birth to these
principles. Such a request does not seek a “new rule.” See Butler v. McKellar,
494 U.S. 407, 415 (1990). Thus, Teague has nothing to do with this case.
III.
PETITIONER WAS HARMED BY THE ERROR
Jenkins contends that it is “nearly impossible” for petitioner to show that he
was harmed by any constitutional error because a judge decided the punishment
instead of a jury (Doc. 8 at 17). He relies exclusively on a case in which a
defendant challenged the admission of evidence at the guilt-innocence stage of a
bench trial. See United States v. Cardenas, 9 F.3d 1139, 1156 (5th Cir. 1993). The
Fifth Circuit observed that a judge presiding over a bench trial presumably
considers only evidence that was admitted and not that was excluded, and that any
error in the admission of evidence is harmless if other admissible evidence is
sufficient to support the conviction.
Cardenas is inapposite to petitioner’s case for two reasons. First, the court
admitted the evidence over objection, so this is not a scenario where a defendant
complains that a judge in a bench trial considered evidence that was excluded. In
overruling all of petitioner’s many objections to the evidence of his lawful sexual
conduct, the court clearly demonstrated that it was not only admitting the evidence

6

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 7 of 10

but also considering it in its assessment of punishment. Had the court sustained
petitioner’s objections and excluded the evidence, then Cardenas (as well as basic
logic) would prevent him from raising this issue now.

But that is not what

happened. The court overruled the objections and admitted the evidence. The
court did not thereafter state on the record that it was not considering the evidence
of petitioner’s lawful sexual conduct in its assessment of punishment.
Respondent McGuire cites a passage of the record from the pronouncement
of sentence and then baldly asserts that it “shows that the trial court did not
consider the details of [petitioner’s] adult sexual preferences in deciding
punishment” (Doc. 11 at 12). That record citation does no such thing. That the
court did not emphasize petitioner’s lawful sexual conduct when it pronounced
sentence does not mean that it did not consider that evidence when it assessed
punishment. A court that assesses punishment does not have to verbalize the
evidence that it considered in reaching its decision, so the absence of such
verbalization does not mean that the court did not consider any particular evidence.
Instead, the legal assumption is that the court considered all of the evidence that it
admitted, especially where it did so over numerous objections.
The second reason that Cardenas is inapposite to petitioner’s case is that the
harmless error rule announced there does not apply to the erroneous admission of
evidence at the punishment stage. In Cardenas, any erroneously admitted evidence

7

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 8 of 10

was harmless where the otherwise admissible evidence was legally sufficient to
sustain the defendant’s conviction. 9 F.3d at 1156. Here, petitioner pled guilty, so
there is no question regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his
conviction. Rather, the error occurred at the punishment stage, so any question of
harm is different from what the court considered in Cardenas.
Jenkins wildly asserts without any citation to authority that petitioner can
show harm only “if the trial court punished [him] or increased his sentence solely
because of his homosexuality or legal sexual practices rather than valid punishment
considerations” (Doc. 8 at 17) (emphasis added). It should be sufficient that the
erroneously admitted evidence was a factor in the sentencing decision. Neither
respondent Jenkins nor McGuire addresses for what harmless purpose the State
offered and the court admitted the evidence of petitioner’s homosexuality and
lawful sexual conduct. Indeed, there could have been none.
Jenkins suggests that the quantity of child pornography “justifies the
maximum sentences” that petitioner received and “certainly counsels against
probation” (Doc. 8 at 18). But the court did not impose maximum sentences on
every count. It assessed punishment at five years imprisonment on count two, to
be served consecutively to count one, and ten years probation on count three, to be
served consecutively to count two (1 C.R. 121-40; 6 R.R. 4-5). That the court did
not impose the maximum sentence on every count demonstrates that the offense of

8

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 14 Filed in TXSD on 12/01/14 Page 9 of 10

conviction did not justify such punishment. The court’s mixed sentencing decision
is strong evidence that there is a reasonable probability that the sentences would
have been different had the punishment stage been conducted properly. In short,
but for the erroneously admitted evidence of petitioner’s homosexuality and lawful
sexual conduct, the court probably would have assessed less than 10 years
imprisonment on the other counts or, alternatively, would not have stacked the
sentence in count two on the sentence in count one or the probated sentence in
count three on the sentence in count two.
The respondents have neither accepted nor met their burden to prove the
error to be harmless. See O’Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 439 (1995). This
Court must have grave doubts that the federal constitutional error had a substantial
and injurious effect or influence in determining the sentence.
petitioner was harmed.
