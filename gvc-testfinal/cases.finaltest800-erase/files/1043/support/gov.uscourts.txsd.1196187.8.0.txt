RESPONDENT JENKINS’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
WITH BRIEF IN SUPPORT
This is a habeas corpus case brought by a Texas state prisoner, Gregg
Carl Baird, under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241, 2254. Baird pleaded guilty to ten counts
of possession of child pornography without an agreement as to punishment.
Baird opted to have the trial court determine punishment. At the punishment
hearing, the State was allowed to introduce evidence, testimony and
photographs that Baird engaged in “adult male bondage.” Baird objected
citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003), which invalidated a Texas
statute criminalizing same-sex, intimate sexual conduct. Lawrence, though,
has never been extended to the punishment stage of trial, and to warrant
federal habeas relief, Baird needs to show that it has. He has failed to do
that. Because there are no genuine issues of material fact, this Court should
grant the Respondent’s motion for summary judgment and dismiss Baird’s
petition with prejudice.

JURISDICTION
Baird’s judgments arise out of Harris County, Texas, within the
jurisdiction of this Court. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(d), 2254(a) (West 2014). 1
PETITIONER’S ALLEGATION
Baird raises one ground for relief:
Whether the state court decision that the admission of evidence
of constitutionally protected sexual conduct at the punishment
stage did not violate due process was contrary to or an
unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.
Fed. Pet. at 7. 2
GENERAL DENIAL
The Director denies all of Baird’s assertions of fact except those
supported by the record or specifically admitted herein.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
I.

Procedural History.
Baird was charged with committing thirteen counts of possession of

child pornography. Exhibit B at 1-2; see also Tex. Pen. Code § 43.26(a). After
the trial court denied a pretrial motion to suppress, he entered a plea of
The Director notes that Baird was released on parole on July 14, 2014. See Exhibit
A at 1 (affidavit of Charley Valdez). Baird is still in the custody of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice – Parole Division while he is on parole. But Baird is
also in the custody of the Brazos County Probation Department because he is also
serving a separate probated sentence. See Exhibit B at 9-10 (count 3 –ten year
sentence probated ten years). Since the Director has filed a part of the records
under seal, he has attached an exhibit, B, containing the indictment, plea papers,
and judgments separately to save the Court from having to refer to the sealed
records.
2 The Director will refer to document number 7 as “Fed. Pet.” and refer to the page
numbers assigned by the ECF system appearing at the top of each page. See Pet. for
Writ of Habeas Corpus; ECF No. 1.

guilty. 3 RR 86; 6 RR 4. Pursuant to an agreement, Baird pled guilty to ten of
the counts, the State agreed to dismiss ninety unadjudicated offenses, and
the parties waived a jury without reaching a specific punishment agreement.
Exhibit B at 3-13 (plea papers); see also 4 RR 8-9. After considering
punishment evidence, the trial court accepted Baird’s guilty plea and
assessed a sentence of ten years imprisonment in count 1. 6 RR 4-5; Exhibit B
at 14-15. The trial court assessed a five year sentence in count 2, cumulated
on count one, and it ordered a ten year sentence in count 3, suspending its
imposition for a period of ten years of community supervision. 6 RR 5; Exhibit
B at 16-17 (count 2), 18-19 (count 3). The trial court ordered the remaining
sentences at confinement for ten years running concurrent to count one. 6 RR
5; Exhibit B at 20-32.
Baird raised two points of error on direct appeal: (1) whether the trial
court erred in denying Baird’s second amended motion to suppress evidence;
and (2) whether it erred by overruling objections to the admissibility of
constitutionally protected conduct offered by the State as punishment
evidence. Baird v. State, 379 S.W.3d 353, 354 (Tex. App.—Waco 2012). The
Tenth District Court of Appeals overruled both points of error and affirmed
the judgments on January 11, 2012. Id. at 361. Baird then filed a petition for
discretionary review (PDR) in the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) raising
both points of error. See Appellant’s PDR, at **2, 7. The CCA granted Baird’s
PDR on the suppression issue. In re Baird, PD-0159-12, 2012 Tex. Crim. App.
LEXIS 870 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (“GRANTED ON GROUND 1). The CCA

3

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 4 of 20

then went on to affirm Baird’s judgments. Baird v. State, 398 S.W.3d 220,
222 (Tex. Crim. App. May 8, 2013).
Baird filed his federal petition one year later on August 6, 2014. Fed.

II.

Statement of the Facts.
The following facts recount the testimony given at Baird’s punishment

hearing on July 28, 2010.
Nathan McCune, an investigator with the Brazos County District
Attorney’s Office described the evidence recovered from Baird’s computer and
other memory devices. 5 RR 13-20. Baird had stored child pornography on
five of the devices at his home, which included 62,000 images of suspected
child pornography. 5 RR 21, 23-28, 34; 96-97. All told, Baird had 211.5
gigabytes of child pornography on his computer. 5 RR 26. State’s Exhibit 3
was a representative sampling of the exhibits introduced during punishment.
5 RR 25. Baird objected to the introduction of State’s Exhibit 3 under
“Lawrence v. Texas and the Due Process Clause.” 5 RR 22, 51. 3 The
Honorable Travis B. Bryan, III, overruled the objection. 5 RR 23. 4 McCune
said that Baird had originally been charged with 100 counts of possession of
child pornography. 5 RR 36-37. Those images appeared on State’s Exhibit 1. 5
Baird argued that Justice Stevens in Bowers v. Hardwick noted that “the fact that
a State’s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as
immoral, is not sufficient reason for upholding it.” 5 RR 52-53; see also Lawrence,
539 U.S. at 577-578 (adopting Justice Stevens’s analysis).
4 Baird was granted a running objection to the introduction of the State’s evidence.
See 5 RR 23.
3

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 5 of 20

RR 36-37. The State then introduced State’s Exhibits 14 through 17. 5 RR 54.
State’s Exhibit 14 were depictions of Baird engaged in “sadomasochistic
positions.” 5 RR 54. State’s Exhibit 15 showed “contrasting photographs of
the Defendant in sadomasochistic poses with some of the photographs taken
off the Defendant’s computer of children in similar poses.” 5 RR 54-55. State’s
Exhibit 16 contained Baird’s online chats. 5 RR 60-61. State’s Exhibit 17
contained pornographic images of a “Boy Scout troop.” 5 RR 56. 5 No
photographs depicted Baird personally involved in sexual acts with children.
5 RR 62-64.
A former leader of the Counsel of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)
discussed Baird’s affiliation with the Boy Scouts. 5 RR 66-72, 80-81. Baird
was involved with the “Venture Crew,” which took extreme and more lengthy
trips with kids aged thirteen to twenty-one. 5 RR 71-77.
Baird also testified. 5 RR 141. He discussed how being raped by two
older male Scouts impacted him, a secret he kept within himself until he was
thirty-eight years old. 5 RR 142-43, 152-55, 174. He acknowledged possessing
all of the child pornography, including extremely graphic photos of five and
six year olds being violated by adults, and gratifying himself to the images,
but he denied ever having sexual contact with an underage child or having
State’s Exhibits 14-17 are not part of the record. The Director has copies of
exhibits 14 and 15 and did not file them but will upon request. The Director does
not have copies of exhibits 16 and 17 but could get them from the Brazos County
Clerk upon request.

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 6 of 20

sexual thoughts toward the Scouts when camping. 5 RR 144-45, 148, 158,
164, 169-74, 199. He also acknowledged that he was sexually attracted to
boys at times. 5 RR 166, 170, 172. Asked if he had control over the sexual
attraction to boys, he replied, “Not necessarily.” 5 RR 166. But he said he
could control the attraction and did control the attraction out of a sense of
professionalism:
When I was on Venture Crew, I was very professional in my
actions. I followed every rule that Scouts had in place to the
letter including Two Deep leadership. I never put myself in the
position where that would happen. I would never allow that to
happen to anyone. I would never personally do that to another
person that happened to me.
5 RR 168, 173.
Baird also acknowledged engaging in sexual explicit chats over the
internet and arranging meetings with strangers for sexual liaisons. 5 RR 178185, 190-93. He acknowledged that he engaged in sadomasochism and in
some instances acted out the bondage he saw in the child porn. 5 RR 179-181.
Baird acknowledged that he had pleaded guilty to evading arrest. 5 RR 186187, 187. 6 The facts of that case involved an arranged meeting with another
adult male for sex at Somerville High School. 5 RR 186-186, 190. Baird said
he telephoned this person who was “working out on the track there at the
Baird had previously pled guilty and received deferred adjudication for an evading
arrest incident at Somerville High School in 2004. 5 RR 85, 91-92, 187-88. Officer
Kindale Pittman arrested Baird when she went to investigate a car in the parking
lot by the track at 11:00 on a Monday night, and Baird fled but was apprehended
when he got stuck in a ditch. 5 RR 86-91.

[Somerville] high school.” 5 RR 186-186. He ran because he was “terrified,”
“scared” even though it was a consensual sexual encounter. 5 RR 187-188,
190. Baird admitted that he continued to chat online while he was on
deferred adjudication. 5 RR 190-191. Baird promised to continue to work on
fighting his attraction to underage boys if he were released on probation. 5
RR 202.
RECORDS
Copies of Baird’s state-writ record were electronically filed with the
Court. The Director will file a portion of the Clerk’s Record, “51 RR 7 of 7
EXHIBITS (part 1),” under seal. Additionally, some exhibits were saved on
disks and were not provided to the Director. The Director does have but did
not file State’s Exhibits 14 and 15, the exhibits the State introduced at the
punishment hearing depicting Baird engaged in sexual acts. The Director will
obtain and file any exhibit not contained in the record upon the Court’s
request. A copy of the state-court records will not be forwarded to Baird.

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WITH BRIEF IN SUPPORT
I.

AEDPA Summary Judgment Standard of Review.
Baird’s petition is subject to review under the Antiterrorism and

Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, (AEDPA). “Summary judgment in
federal habeas is different than in the average civil case.” Torres v. Thaler,
395 Fed. App’x. 101, 106 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Smith v. Cockrell, 311 F.3d
661, 668 (5th Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds by Tennard v. Dretke,
542 U.S. 274, 284 (2004)). “As a general principle, Rule 56 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, relating to summary judgment, applies with equal
force in the context of habeas corpus cases.” Clark v. Johnson, 202 F.3d 760,
764 (5th Cir. 2000). But the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to habeas
cases only to the extent they are consistent with established habeas practice
and procedure. See Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases.
Ordinarily, the burden is on the moving party to show that “there is an
absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.” See Freeman v.

Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Justice, 369 F.3d 854, 860 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986)).

In federal habeas summary

judgment practice, though, the Respondent does not assume a burden
concerning the factual findings:
[Section] 2254(e)(1) – which mandates that findings of fact made
by a state court are ‘presumed to be correct’ – overrides the
ordinary rule that, in a summary judgment proceeding, all
disputed facts must be construed in the light most favorable to
the nonmoving party. Unless [the petitioner] can ‘rebut [ ] the
presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence’ as
to the state court’s findings of fact, they must be accepted as
correct.

Smith, 311 F.3d at 668.
Pleadings by a pro se litigant are reviewed under a less stringent
standard than those drafted by attorneys. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S.
519, 520 (1972). Pleadings filed by a pro se litigant are entitled to a liberal
construction that affords all reasonable inferences which can be drawn from
them. See Haines, 404 U.S. at 521. Nevertheless, “the notice afforded by the
Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules” is considered “sufficient” to
advise a pro se party of his burden in opposing a summary judgment motion.

Martin v. Harrison County Jail, 975 F.2d 192, 193 (5th Cir. 1992); see also
Ogbodiegwu v. Wackenhut Corrections Corp., 202 F.3d 265 (5th Cir. 1999)
(unpublished table opinion) (“Although the pleadings filed by pro se parties
are held to ‘less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
lawyers,’ pro se parties must still comply with the rules of procedure and
make arguments capable of withstanding summary judgment.”).
II.

AEDPA Standard of Review.
Under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), a federal court may not issue a writ of

habeas corpus for a defendant convicted under a state judgment unless the
adjudication of the relevant constitutional claim by the state court, (1) “‘was
contrary to’ federal law then clearly established in the holdings of” the
Supreme Court; or (2) “‘involved an unreasonable application of’” clearly
established Supreme Court precedent; or (3) “‘was based on an unreasonable
determination of the facts’ in light of the record before the state court.”

Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 785 (2011) (quoting Williams v. Taylor,
529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000)); 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Thus, “a state court’s

9

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 10 of 20

determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long
as ‘fairminded jurists could disagree’” on the correctness of the state court’s
decision. Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541
U.S. 652, 664 (2004)); see also Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 27 (2002)
(federal habeas relief is only merited where the state-court decision is both
incorrect and objectively unreasonable, “whether or not [this Court] would
reach the same conclusion”).
Moreover, it is the state court’s “ultimate decision” that is to be tested
for unreasonableness, and not every jot of its reasoning. Neal v. Puckett, 286
F.3d 230, 246 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc). And, even where the state court fails
to cite to applicable Supreme Court precedent or is unaware of such
precedent, AEDPA’s deferential standard of review nevertheless applies “so
long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision
contradicts [Supreme Court precedent].”

Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 8

(2002); Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786. If the Supreme Court has not “broken
sufficient legal ground to establish [a] . . . constitutional principle, the lower
federal courts cannot themselves establish such a principle with clarity
sufficient to satisfy the AEDPA bar” under either the contrary to or
unreasonable application standard. Williams, 529 U.S. at 381.
AEDPA also provides that the state court’s factual findings “shall be
presumed to be correct” unless the petitioner carries “the burden of rebutting
the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.” 28 U.S.C.
§ 2254(e)(1). “The presumption of correctness not only applies to explicit
findings of fact, but it also applies to those unarticulated findings which are

10

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 11 of 20

necessary to the state court’s conclusions of mixed law and fact.” Valdez v.

Cockrell, 274 F.3d 941, 948 n.11 (5th Cir. 2001). And except for the narrow
exceptions contained in § 2254(e)(2), the evidence upon which a petitioner
would challenge a state court fact finding must have been presented to the
state court. Because a federal habeas court is prohibited from granting relief
unless a decision was based on “an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,” it follows that
demonstrating the incorrectness of a state court fact finding based upon
evidence not presented to the state court would be of no avail to a habeas
petitioner. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).
Finally, where a habeas petitioner has failed to fully develop the
factual bases of his claims in state court, he is precluded from further factual
development in federal court unless (1) his claims rely on a new rule of
constitutional law or a factual predicate previously undiscoverable through
the exercise of due diligence; and (2) he establishes by clear and convincing
evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would
have found him guilty. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2). A failure to meet this standard
of “diligence” will bar a federal evidentiary hearing in the absence of a
convincing claim of actual innocence that can only be established by newly
discovered evidence. Williams, 529 U.S. at 436. For example, a petitioner’s
failure to present controverted, previously unresolved factual issues to the
state court is sufficient to constitute “failure” under the plain meaning of §
2254(e)(2). Id. at 433. But even if the petitioner can meet the foregoing
standard, it is within this Court’s discretion to deny a hearing if sufficient

11

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 12 of 20

facts exist to make an informed decision on the merits. Clark v. Johnson, 227
F.3d 273, 284-85 (5th Cir. 2000).
III.

Baird’s Claims Are Without Merit.
A.

There Is No Clearly Established Supreme Court Precedent.

To warrant relief, Baird has to show that the adjudication of his claim
was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly

established” Supreme Court precedent. See 28 U.S.C. §2254(d)(1) (emphasis
added). While Baird believes that Lawrence v. Texas bars the introduction of
evidence of one engaging in constitutionally protected sexual activity during
the punishment phase of trial, he has not cited to any Supreme Court case
extending Lawrence to the sentencing phase of trial. See Fed. Pet. at 14-25. 7
That there is no clearly established Supreme Court precedent extending

Lawrence to the punishment phase of trial is fatal to Baird’s claim. The
Director also notes that federal courts cannot on their own extend Supreme
Court precedent to new arenas. The Supreme Court just this year settled
that issue in a case very similar to this one in White v. Woodall, where the
Supreme Court said it was error to extend clearly established Supreme Court

Baird points to a couple of cases involving the criminalization of the sale of sexual
devices and incest. See Fed. Pet. at 17-18 & n. 4 (citing to Reliable Consultants, Inc.
v. Earle, 517 F.3d 738, 747 (5th Cir. 2008) (invalidating Texas statute criminalizing
sale or promotion of sexual devices), Lowe v. Swanson, 663 F.3d 258, 264 (6th Cir.
2011 (declining to extend Lawrence to criminalization of incest); Muth v. Frank, 412
F.3d 808, 818 (7th Cir. 2005) (same)). While he does not rely heavily on these cases,
the Director notes that to the extent that Lawrence did apply, it would only apply in
situations where the State is attempting to criminalize constitutionally-protected
conduct.
7

12

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 13 of 20

precedent pertaining to the provision of an “adverse-inference instruction” 8 to
the punishment phase of trial.
In White, the Sixth Circuit had granted habeas relief after faulting the
Kentucky Supreme Court for failing to extend Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S.
288 (1981) dealing with the provision of a “no-adverse-inference” instruction
at the guilt/innocence stage of trial to the punishment phase of trial. See 134
S. Ct. 1697, 1702 (2014) (citing Woodall v. Simpson, 685 F.3d 574, 581 (6th
Cir. 2012) for proposition that failure to provide an “adverse-inference
instruction at the penalty phase violated [his] Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination”). The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit
holding that Section 2254(d)(1) “does not require state courts to extend”
Supreme Court precedent “or license federal courts to treat the failure to do
so as error.” See id. at 1706-1707 (emphasis in orig.). “Thus, ‘if a habeas
court must extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand,’ then
by definition the rationale was not ‘clearly established at the time of the
state-court decision.’” Id. at 1706 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.
652, 666 (2004)). And “clearly established” does not include “‘dicta.” See id. at
1702. (citations omitted).
Here, even though the Waco Court of Appeals was asked to extend the
rationale behind Lawrence to the punishment phase of trial, the court did not
do so. See Baird, 379 S.W.3d at 359-360. Therefore, Baird cannot be an
unreasonable application of Lawrence. Additionally, Baird faults the court of
A “no-adverse-inference” instruction would inform the jury that “‘[a] defendant is
not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not
prejudice him in any way.’” White, 134 S. Ct. at 1701.

13

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 14 of 20

appeals for failing “to acknowledge or discuss the ultimate holding of
Dawson,” a case in which the Supreme Court held that a sentencing court
could not consider evidence of membership in the “Aryan Brotherhood”
because membership in a white racist prison gang was irrelevant to
punishment. See Fed. Pet. at 22 (citing Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. 159,
166-167 (1992)). But the Waco Court of Appeals did, in fact, cite Dawson.
Admittedly, it did so after citing Davis v. State, 329 S.W.3d 798, 805 (Tex.
Crim. App. 2010). See Baird, 379 S.W.3d at 359-360 (citing Davis v. State,
329 S.W.3d 798, 805 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). But Davis cited what appears to
be one of Dawson’s most-cited sentences: “the Constitution is not a per se
barrier to the admission of evidence merely because the evidence involves
conduct that is constitutionally protected.” See id. at 360 (quoting Davis
quoting Dawson, 503 U.S. at 161). Presumably, Baird cites to Dawson as
possibly the next best case that might apply in this situation because Dawson
dealt with punishment evidence. It is just not true, though, that Baird failed
to apply Dawson or state-court precedent relying on associational-type cases.

See id. at 360 (citing to Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 805 (association evidence at
punishment); Mason v. State, 905 S.W.2d 570, 576 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995)
(same); Woodward v. State, 170 S.W.3d 726, 729 (Tex. App.—Waco 2005, pet.
ref’d) (same)). In short, the Baird court was aware of both Lawrence and

Dawson. It cannot be faulted to for failing to extend Lawrence nor can it be
faulted for failing to apply Dawson.
Additionally, because there is no clearly established Supreme Court
precedent nor a clear due process prohibition to the introduction of evidence

14

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 15 of 20

related to sexual conduct, the non-retroactivity principle established in

Teague v. Lane bars this Court from granting relief. Teague bars federal
habeas courts from creating “a new rule” of constitutional law, that is, federal
courts cannot “break[ ] new ground,” “impose[ ] a new obligation on the States
or the Federal Government,” or issue a decision that was “not dictated by
precedent existing at the time the defendant’s conviction became final.”

Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 301 (1989). A conclusion that is “susceptible to
debate among reasonable minds” is considered a “new rule” even if the result
is “controlled or governed by earlier decisions.” Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S.
407, 415 (1990). Only when a decision merely restates existing law or simply
applies already established law to a set of facts different from those which
gave birth to the principle, is the decision considered to not be a “new” rule
and therefore given retroactive application. Id.
In conclusion, Baird cannot show that there is clearly established
Supreme Court precedent applying Lawrence to punishment. This Court
should grant the Director’s motion for summary judgment and deny relief.
B.

Baird Cannot Show Harm.

Baird claims that evidence that he engaged in constitutionally
protected sexual conduct was inadmissible at sentencing. Fed. Pet. at 19. He
cites Zant v. Stephens for the proposition that “not all evidence of ‘character’
qualifies as admissible aggravating evidence to be considered at the
punishment phase of a criminal case.” See id. at 20 (citing 462 U.S. 862, 885
(1983)). A trial court cannot consider, for example, factors such as “race,
religion, or political affiliation.” See id. (citing, for examples, Zant, 462 U.S. at

15

885, Romer v. Evans, 17 U.S. 620 (1996) (discrimination against
homosexuals) and Saldano v. Cockrell, 267 F. Supp. 635, 642 (E.D. Tex. 2003)
(considerations of race and ethnicity)).
First, to the extent that Baird argues the use of evidence that he
engaged in constitutionally protected sexual conduct somehow violates state
law, article 37.07 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for example, then the
claim is without merit since it does not involve a violation of federal law. See

Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. 1, 10 (1994) (citing Estelle v. McGuire, 502
U.S. 62, 67 (1991)).
Second, to the extent that either Lawrence or Dawson applies, Baird
has failed to show that the opinion of the Waco Court of Appeals was
“contrary to” or involved an “unreasonable application of” either Lawrence or

Dawson.
Last, Baird cannot show that he was harmed by the admission of this
evidence. The standard for reviewing all trial court error in a federal habeas
petition is outlined in Brecht. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619
(1993). Baird must show that the trial court’s errors had a “substantial and
injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.” See Brecht,
507 U.S. at 623. To prevail on claims of trial court error, a petitioner must
establish that the error did more than merely affect the verdict. Bailey v.

Procunier, 744 F.2d 1166, 1168 (5th Cir. 1984). Instead, he must establish
that it rendered the trial, as a whole, fundamentally unfair. Id. An error by
the trial court renders the trial fundamentally unfair only if there is a
reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different had the

16

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 17 of 20

trial been conducted properly. See Rogers v. Lynaugh, 848 F.2d 606, 609 (5th
Cir. 1988). Applying the federal harmless error standard, the error must have
“‘had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s
verdict.’” Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637 (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328
U.S. 750, 776 (1946)).
That a trial court judge presided over the introduction of this evidence
purportedly inadmissible under Lawrence or Dawson Baird’s job of showing
harm nearly impossible. When reviewing a judge’s decision in a bench trial, a
reviewing court presumes that “[t]he prejudicial impact of erroneously
admitted evidence . . . [is] substantially less than it might have been in a jury
trial.” United States v. Cardenas, 9 F.3d. 1139, 1156 (5th Cir. 1993) (internal
quotations omitted). “[A] judge, sitting as a trier of fact, is presumed to have
rested his verdict only on the admissible evidence before him and to have
disregarded that which is inadmissible.” Id. (internal quotations omitted).
Thus, “[a]ny error the judge makes in admitting evidence is . . . harmless if
there exists other admissible evidence sufficient to support the conviction.”

Id.
Here again, the constitutional harm in violation of Lawrence or

Dawson would occur, presumably, if the trial court punished Baird or
increased his sentence solely because of his homosexuality or legal sexual
practices rather than valid punishment considerations. But the primary
punishment evidence consisted of Appellant’s massive collection of over
60,000 images of child pornography, including those of very young boys in
graphic situations. 5 RR 21, 23-28, 34, 96-97. The plea papers indicated that

17

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 18 of 20

ninety other counts of possession of child pornography were “barred in
accordance with [article] 12.45” of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure
(Article 12.45). See Exhibit B at 8-9 (plea papers).

Contrary to Baird’s

argument, references to homosexuality were not an effort to punish Baird for
his sexual orientation. Possession of a massive amount of child pornography
certainly counsels against probation, which he asked for, and justifies the
maximum sentences he received. The trial court, through Baird’s objections
and case citation, was also well aware of what Lawrence prohibited, and its
only reference to his sexual urges was being a “ticking time bomb” not the
details of his adult preferences. 6 RR 6.
In short, one who is possession of this amount of child pornography has
a near impossible task of convincing a state-court judge that he should get
anything less than a maximum sentence regardless of what other evidence
was introduced at trial. As indicated above, Baird had numerous character
witnesses testifying in his behalf. But Baird was in possession of over 60,000
images of child pornography, consuming 211 gigabytes of space. Baird left
little room for leniency. Baird cannot show that he was harmed under Brecht;
therefore, his claims are without merit. This Court should grant the
Director’s motion for summary judgment and dismiss Baird’s petition with
prejudice.
CONCLUSION
Baird has failed to show that the state-courts’ adjudication on the
merits was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, Supreme
Court precedent or that their determination was the product of an
18

Case 4:14-cv-02259 Document 8 Filed in TXSD on 10/30/14 Page 19 of 20

unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). There are
no genuine issues of material fact, and the Director is entitled to summary
judgment as a matter of law. The Director respectfully requests that this
Court grant his motion for summary judgment and sua sponte deny a
certificate of appealability. See Alexander v. Johnson, 211 F.3d 895, 898 (5th
Cir. 2000).
