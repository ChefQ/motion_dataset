MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

1

2

Document 10

1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.

3

The remedies under California's "unfair competition" and "false advertising"

4

laws are limited. The plaintiffs' Complaint seeks "nonrestitutionary" disgorgement of

5

profits, and attorneys' fees, both of which are clearly not recoverable and therefore

6

should be stricken from the Complaint. The Complaint's request for injunctive relief is

7

also improper.

8

Plaintiffs Alexis Degelmann's and Joseph Lin's ("plaintiffs") Complaint follows

9

on the heels of a product recall which was announced on May 25, 2007. The

10

Complaint alleges defendant herein, Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. ("AMO")

11

produced, marketed and sold a contact lens solution known as COMPLETE

12

MoisturePLUS(ß Multi-Purpose Solution ("COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß MPS"). It

13

further asserts that, according to recent reporting from the U.S Centers for Disease

14

Control (CDC)~ and contrary to AMO's marketing, COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß

15

MPS is inferior to other contact lens solutions at disinfecting contact lenses and its use

16

increases the risk of development of corneal infection compared to other contact lens

17

solutions. The Complaint does not allege plaintiffs sustained any physical injury from

18

use of Complete MoisturePLUS(ß MPS, but that plaintiffs seek to represent a class of

19

purchasers who "suffered actual injur in that they purchased the product, and current

20

users have been forced to discard it along with lens containers."

21

The Complaint asserts two claims, based on violations of California Business &

22

Professions Code sections 17500 ("false advertising") and 17200 ("unfair

23

competition") respectively. Under plain statutory language and established case law,

24

restitution and injunction are the only remedies available for violation of these

25

sections. "Nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits" clearly is not. (Korea Supply

26

Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corporation, 29 Ca1.4th 1134 (2003). Attorneys' fees clearly

27

are not. (Cel- Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Company,

28

20 Ca1.4th 163, 179 (1999).) Furthermore, because the product at issue has already

1

been recalled, injunctive relief plainly is not available. Accordingly, the Court should

2

strike the demands/prayer for these remedies from the Complaint to avoid the time and

3

expense and prejudice which would ensue from their presence in the case.

4

2. RELEVANT ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT.

5

Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges the following: (1) AMO produced, marketed and

6

sold a contact lens solution product known as Complete MoisturePlus Multi-Purpose

7

Solution ("Complete MoisturePLUS(ß MPS"); (2) AMO represented to consumers,

8

among other things, that Complete MoisturePLUS(ß MPS rejuvenates, cleans, rinses,

9

stores, disinfects, removes protein from and conditions contact lenses; (3) according to

10

recent reporting from the CDC, consumers who use COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß

11

MPS are at a "seven-fold" increased risk (compared to other brands of contact lens

12

solutions) of suffering a corneal infection known as acanthamoeba keratitis which can

13

cause visual impairment and in some cases blindness; (4) when it introduced

14

COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß MPS, AMO was aware of studies which showed

15

COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß MPS was inferior to other contact lens solutions such as

16

hydrogen peroxide in destroying acanthamoeba and contaminants, and intentionally

17

omitted, suppressed and failed to disclose this information to consumers; and (5)

18

plaintiffs Alexis Degelmann and Joseph Lin purchased and used COMPLETE

19

MoisturePLUS(ß MPS to disinfect their contact lenses. (See Exhibit "A", Complaint,

20

p. 2, ~~ 3-4, 7-8; p. 3, ~~ 9-11.)

21

The Complaint also asserts that plaintiffs seek to represent a class of "all

22

purchasers throughout the United States who bought COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß

23

MPS during the period from June 13, 2003 through the present." It describes nine

24

"questions of law or fact" their proposed class allegedly has in common and makes

25

other class action allegations. (Id. at 3, ~~ 12-13; 4, ~~ 14-17.) Importantly, plaintiffs

26

do not allege that they suffered any personal injury; rather, they allege that the class

27

members' only damage is that they paid for the product and then discarded it at CDC's

28

recommendation.

Page 9 of 17

1 The Complaint's first claim is for violations of California Business &
2 Professions Code section 17500, and alleges that AMO publicly disseminated
3 information concerning the cleaning attributes of COMPLETE MoisturePLUS(ß MPS

4 which it knew were untrue or misleading. The claim alleges that, "As a result of the
5 foregoing, members of the Class suffered actual injury in that they purchased the
6 product, and current users have been forced to discard it along with lens containers."
7 (Id. at 5, ~ 20, 6, ~ 21.) Paragraph 22 of the Complaint then states that plaintiffs and

8 members of the class seek to recover "restitution and disgorgement of all earings,

9 profits, compensation and benefit obtained as a result of the practices that are
10 unlawfuL.." (Id. at ~ 22.) "They also seek an injunction... preventing further
11

violations of.. .

sections 17200 et. seq. and 17500 et seq." (Id.)

12

The Complaint's second claim is for violations of California Business &

13

Professions Code section 17200, and alleges that AMO, by its conduct previously

14

alleged, engaged in unfair, deceptive, ilegal and/or fraudulent business acts or

15

practices. Paragraph 25 then states that, "Defendant derived economic benefit and

16

profit from the violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, which

17

the Class." (Id. at ~ 25.)

should be restored and/or disgorged to members of

18

The Complaint's "Prayer For Relief' states, in pertinent part,

19

1. For restitution of all monies due to members of the Class or
wrongfully taken by Defendant from members of the Class, and

disgorged profits from the unlawful business practice of

4 4. UNDER RULE 12(n~ THE COURT MAY STRIKE IMPROPER

5 DEMANDS FOR DAMAGES AND REMEDIES FROM THE

6 COMPLAINT.
7 A motion to strike may be used to strike a demand or prayer for damages where

8 the damages or remedies sought are not recoverable as a matter of law. (Bureerong v.

9 Uvawas, 922 F.Supp. 1450, 1479, fn. 34 (C.D. Cal. 1996), citing Tapley v. Lockwood

10 Green Engineers, Inc., 502 F.2d 559, 560 (8th Cir. 1974); Wilkerson v. Butler, 229

11 F.R.D. 166, 172 (E.D. Cal. 2005).) In the instant case, as discussed below, striking the

12 plaintiffs improper demands for relief/prayer wil serve the purposes of Rule 12(£) to
13 avoid the expenditure of time and money resulting from litigation of spurious issues by

14 dispensing with them immediately. (Sidney-Vinstein v. A.H Robins Co., 697 F.2d 880,

15 885 (9th Cir. 1983).)

16 5. THE COMPLAINT'S DEMANS FOR NONRSTITUTIONARY

17 DISGORGEMENT SHOULD BE STRICKEN.
18 Under California's Business & Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500,
19 "nonrestitutionary" disgorgement of a defendant's earnings and profits is not a
20 permissible remedy.

21 The express statutory remedies available for violations of California Business &
22 Professions Code section 17200, "unfair competition" ("UCL"), and 17500, "false

23 advertising" ("F AL"), are nearly identicaL. (Business & Professions Code sections
24
25

26
27
28

i A district court may consider records and reports of administrative bodies and other

"matters of public record outside the proceedings" by way of judicial notice. (MGIC Indem.
Corp. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir.1986); Lamers Dairy Inc. v. USDA, 379 F.3d

466, 471 n. 8 (7th Cir. 2004) ("This court may take judicial notice of reports of administrative
bodies").); In re Wellbutrin SR/Zyban Antitrust Litg., 281 F.Supp.2d 751, 745 n. 2 (E.D.Pa.
FDA report posted on the official FDA website).)

1 17203 and 17535.i) Under both, the court is permitted to "make such orders or

2 judgments. .. as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or
3 propert, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of' such unfair

4 competition or false advertising. (Id.)
5 The California Supreme Court has made clear that this statutory language limits
6 plaintiffs to injunctive relief and restitution, and that damages are not available.

7 (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corporation, 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1144-1150

8 (2003).)

9 The object of restitution is to restore the status quo by returning to the plaintiff

10 funds in which he or she has an ownership interest. (Id. at 1149.) Thus, an order for
11 restitution is one compelling a UCL defendant to return money obtained through an
12 unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the propert was taken,

13 that is, to persons who had an ownership interest in the propert or those claiming
14 through that person. (Id. at 1149, citing Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. 23

15 Cal.4th 116, 126-127 (2000).) In other words, in this context, "restitution means the
16
17
18

2 Section 17203 provides, in pertinent part,

19

Any person, corporation, firm, partnership, joint stock company, or any other

broader range of relief and can include nonrestitutionary elements that are not

authorized under the UCL,

(A)n order for disgorgement may compel a defendant to surrender all
money obtained through an unfair business practice even though not
all is to be restored to those persons from whom it was obtained or
those claiming under those persons. It has also been used to refer to
surrender of all profits earned as a result of an unfair business practice
regardless of whether those profits represent money taken directly
from persons who were victims of the unfair practice.

11

12
13

This court has never approved of nonrestitutionary disgorgement of

profits as a remedy under the UCL. While prior cases discussing the

UCL may have characterized some of the relief available as

14

'disgorgement, , we were referring to the restitutionary form of

15

disgorgement, and not to the nonrestitutionary .type sought here by
plaintiff.

16
17

(Korea Supply, supra at 1145, 1148.)

18

Accordingly, disgorgement is not permitted under the UCL of: (1) money

19

obtained even though not all is to be restored to those persons from whom it was

20

obtained; or (2) profits earned as a result of an unfair business practice unless taken

21

22

directly from victims of the unfair practice. (Korea Supply, supra, at 1145-1152
("disgorgement...is an available remedy.. .

only to the extent that it constitutes

23

restitution"); Feitelberg v. Credit Suisse First Boston, LLC, 134 Cal.AppAth 997,

24

1015-1020 (2005) (courts have no inherent equitable power to order nonrestitutionary

25

disgorgement, and it is not authorized under either the "prevent" prong or the 'restore'

26

prong of section 17203); Madrid v. Perot Systems Corporation, 130 Cal.AppAth 440

1 163, 172 (2000) (trial court may not order disgorgement of all benefits defendant may

2 have received from failing to pay overtime wages; it may only order restitution to
3 person from whom money or property has been unfairly or unlawfully obtained).)
4 Whereas with restitutionary disgorgement the focus is on the plaintiffs loss3, with
5 (non-recoverable) nonrestitutionary disgorgement, the focus is on the defendant's gain

6 from the unfair practice. (Feitelberg, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at 1013.)

7 The rule prohibiting nonrestitutionary disgorgement applies with equal force in
8 class actions. (Feitelberg, supra, at 1015-1020 (2005) (nonrestitutionary disgorgement

9 of profits not permitted in class action); Madrid, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at 459

10 (plaintiff s attempted class action on behalf of electricity customers did not seek utility

11 overcharges but rather return of profits earned from defendant's unfair business
12 practices; court rejected claim); Alch v. Superior Court, 122 Cal.App.4th 339, 408
13 (2004) (trial court has no authority to award nonrestitutionary backpay to class).) This

14 is because class certification does not serve to enlarge substantive rights or remedies.

15 As the court said in Feitelberg, supra, "class action status does not alter the parties'
16 underlying substantive rights; if a specific form of relief is foreclosed to claimants as

17 individuals, it remains unavailable to them even if they congregate into a class.,,4
18 (Fietelberg, supra, at 606.)

19 Other examples of enforcement of the rule against recovery of nonrestitutionary
20 disgorgement in this context abound. In In re First Alliance Mortgage Company, 471

21 F3d 977, 997 (9th Cir. 2006), the court rejected the plaintiffs' claims for all moneys

22 obtained by defendants where only a small percentage of it came as a result of the
23 alleged wrongfully charged fees. In Matoff v. Brinker Restaurant Corporation, 439
24
25

26

27
28

3 AMO disputes that plaintiffs have suffered any "loss", since they do not have any personal
injuries and COMPLETE MoisturePLVS(ß MPS was thus safe and effective for them.
4 The Feitelberg court also made clear that the existence of a "fluid recovery" mechanism in
class actions does not permit plaintiffs to obtain nonrestitutionary disgorgement under the
VCL; "fluid recovery" is a method of paying out d~mages, not an entitlement to a different
type of damages. (Feitelberg, supra, 134 Cal.AppA at 1015-1020.)

F.Supp.2d 1035, 1038 (C.D. Cal. 2006) the district court held that disgorgement of

2

profits in excess of restitution was not permitted. In Starr-Garden v. Massachusetts

Mutual Life Insurance Company, 2006 WL 3218178 (E.D. Cal. 2006) the court stated

that,

Typically, when a defendant is ordered to disgorge profits, it must
surrender all money obtained through the illegal business practice,
including money not obtained from plaintiffs. The UCL does not
permit this. Rather, disgorgement is permissible only to the extent
that it constitutes restitution.
(Id. at 7; citations omitted.)

10

In Bran v. Sun Pacifc Farming Coop, 2007 WL 678494, p. 6 (E.D. Cal. 2007),

11

the district court, citing Korea Supply, strck the disgorgement of profits language

12

from the class action complaint based on "the California Supreme Court's preclusion of

13

profits disgorgement as an unfair competition law remedy." (Id. at 6.)

14

In the instant case, the plaintiffs' Complaint contains several demands for

15

nonrestitutionary disgorgement which must be stricken pursuant to Korea Supply and

16

its progeny. In particular, page 6, lines 11-13, states that plaintiffs are entitled not only

17

to restitution, but also to "disgorgement of all earnings, profits, compensation and

18

benefit obtained' by defendant. (Exh. "A", 6:11-13; emphasis added.) Page 6, lines

19

23-25 alleges that "Defendant derived economic benefit and profit... which should be

20

restored and/or disgorged to members of

the Class". (Id. at 6:23-25; emphasis added.)

21

And, item 1 of the Prayer For Relief, at page 7, lines 3-5, asks, "For restitution of all

22

monies due to members of the Class or wrongfully taken by Defendant from members

23

of the Class, and disgorged profits from the unlawful business practices of Defendant'.

24

(Id. at 7:3-5; emphasis added.) The requests set forth in italics above are clearly

25

intended to encompass the "nonrestitutionary disgorgement" relief decried by Korea

26

Supply et. al. Each such allegation/prayer asserts entitlement to restitution and

27

disgorgement in the conjunctive or describes the relief sought based on the benefit to

28

the defendant. The former makes clear the relief sought is in addition to or different

1 from "restitution" and the latter blatantly identifies the focus of the remedy sought as
2 the gain to the defendant rather than the loss to be restored to the plaintiff. In both
3 cases, the request is not sustainable under the UCL. (Korea Supply, supra; Feitelberg,

4 supra.)
5 The presence of these non-recoverable damages claims in the case prejudices

6 AMO, and wil undoubtedly lead to discovery and other disputes and cause
7 unnecessary time and expense to be incurred by the parties and the Court.
8 Accordingly, the allegations/prayer seeking such damages should be stricken from the

9 Complaint.

10 6.

THE COMPLAINT'S REQUESTS FOR INJUCTIVE RELIEF ARE

11

ALSO IMPROPER.

12

While the UCL and F AL generally authorize injunctive relief, the law is clear

13

that injunctions are not permissible under these statutes in the absence of any evidence

14

that the acts are likely to be repeated in the future. (Fietelberg, supra at 602, 609-610;

15

Cisneros v. UD. Registr, Inc., 39 Cal.AppAth 548, 574 (1995).) In Fietelberg, the

16

trial court denied injunctive relief under the UCL because the "wrongful practice"

17

upon which the lawsuit was based had already ended. The court of appeal affirmed,

18

stating,

19

20

The business practice challenged here is the subject of a federal

consent judgment that compels defendants to stop the offending
conduct. As the California Supreme Court said long ago, "when as

21

here, the assertedly wrongful practice has ended long before the action

22

Blue Chip Stamps v. Superior Court, 18 Cal.3d 381 (1976).)

23

is filed, its requested termination is a rather empty prayer." (Citing
(Feitelberg, supra, at 609-610.)

24

In the instant case, AMO has voluntarily discontinued selling COMPLETE

25

MoisturePLUS(ß MPS and recalled the product. (See Section 3, supra.) Accordingly,

26

there is no "offending conduct" to enjoin, the allegedly wrongful practice "ended

27

before the action was filed" and no allegation has been or can be made that it is "likely

28

to be repeated in the future". Accordingly, no basis for injunctive relief exists, and the

1 requests in the Complaint for such relief should be stricken. (Feitelberg, supra;
2 California Service Station etc. Assn. v. Union Oil Co., 232 Cal.App.3d 44, 56 (1991)

3 (injunction can be denied where the defendant voluntarily discontinues the wrongful

4 conduct).)

5 7. THE PRAYER'S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES ALSO

6 SHOULD BE STRICKEN.
7 Neither the California Code of Civil Procedure or the UCL allows for the

8 recovery of attorneys' fees. Under California law, attorneys' fees are not recoverable
9 unless expressly authorized by statute or by the parties' contract.5 (California Code of
10 Civil Procedure section 1021; Reynolds Metal Company v. Alperson, 25 Cal.3d 124,

11 127 (1979).)

12 Business & Professions Code section 17200 et. seq. and 17500 et. seq. do not
13 authorize recovery of attorneys' fees, and the California Supreme Court has

14 specifically stated that they are not recoverable in a UCL action. (Cel-Tech
15 Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Company, 20 Cal.4th 163,

16 179 (1999) ("plaintiffs may not receive damages ... or attorney fees" in such cases);
17 America Online, Inc. v. Superior Court, 90 Cal.App. 4th 1, 15 n. 10 (2001) ( same).)

18 Nor does Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5 authorize recovery of
19 attorneys' fees in this case. Section 1021.5 permits such recovery in certain cases

20 resulting in significant public benefit, must be brought by motion after trial, and is
21 intended as a bounty for pursuing public interest litigation, not a reward for litigants

22 motivated by their own interests who coincidentally serve the public. (Code of Civil
23 Procedure section 1021.5; California Licensed Foresters Association v. State Board of

24 Forestr, 30 Cal.AppAth 562 (1994); Baxter v. Salutary Sportsclubs, Inc., 122

5 An award of attorneys' fees incurred in a suit based on state substantive law is generally
governed by state law. (Champion Produce, Inc. v. Ruby Robinson Co., Inc., 342 F.3d 1016,

1020 (9th Cir. 2003).)

1 Cal.AppAth 941, 948 (2004) (under section 1021.5, attorneys' fees especially not
