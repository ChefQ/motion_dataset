MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE ARTICLE 12(b)(6)
NOW INTO COURT, through undersigned counsel, comes defendant Americas
Insurance Company (“AIC”), who respectfully moves this Honorable Court to grant its Motion
to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure Article 12(b)(6) herein, dismissing with
prejudice at plaintiffs’ costs the claims of plaintiffs, Stacy Morgan and A-Plus Contractors, LLC,
on the grounds that plaintiffs do not have a right of action to recover statutory penalties and
attorney fees pursuant to LSA-R.S. 22:1892 and 22:1973. Further, Stacy Morgan’s claims
should be dismissed with prejudice as only A-Plus Contractors is the proper party to bring an
action against AIC for the reasons as more fully set forth in the attached Memorandum in
Support. Further, AIC prays for all general and equitable relief.
