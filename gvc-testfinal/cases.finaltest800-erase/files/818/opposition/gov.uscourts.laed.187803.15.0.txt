PLAINTIFFS’, STACY MORGAN AND A-PLUS CONTRACTORS, L.L.C.’S
MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO 12(B)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS FILED BY
DEFENDANT, AMERICAS INSURANCE COMPANY
Plaintiffs, Stacy Morgan and A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C., through counsel of record,
respectfully file this memorandum in opposition to party defendant, AMERICA’S INSURANCE
COMPANY’s (hereinafter “AIC”) 12(b)(6) Motion To Dismiss. Simply-put, based on the
undisputed, valid assignment of benefits agreement at issue coupled with the multitude of
allegations posited by complainant against AIC consisting of negligence, breach of contract, bad
faith treatment, and the jurisprudential high requirements to grant a 12(b)(6) motion, the instant
motion should be denied.
I. FACTS AND BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs filed suit with the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans on June 14, 2016
against defendant, America’s Insurance Company. (hereinafter “Americas”) The petition and
entire claim is based on a valid “Assignment of Benefits” form signed by the America’s
policyholder Hollis Burton and the owner of A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C.1 There is no dispute that

See Exhibit “A” – Signed Contractual Assignment of Benefits Form.

Case 2:16-cv-13900-JTM-KWR Document 15 Filed 12/20/16 Page 2 of 9

the assignment of benefits contract is valid between the plaintiffs, and the AIC insured, Hollis
Burton. It is also undisputed that plaintiff A-Plus Contractor, L.L.C. was the contractor who
performed fire repairs to Hollis Burton’s home in 2015. It is also undisputed that the fire was an
“occurrence” under the policy of insurance issued by AIC which required AIC to comply with its
duties under the policy to issue payments to its insured, Hollis Burton.
A-Plus Contractors and Stacy Morgan were paid some portion of their work, but, there
remains an outstanding amount of $43,511.32 owed to plaintiffs from Hollis Burton, and by virtue
of the assignment of benefits form, from AIC. This is further evidenced in the “Statement of Lien
and Privilege Pursuant to La. Rev. Statue 9:4801, Et. Seq” which was filed with the New Orleans
Mortgage and Conveyance Offices on September 17, 2015.2 This Court evaluated the above facts
and discussed the existence of the Assignment of Benefits Contract in its Order dated November
30, 2016 denying the Motion To Remand.3
That Assignment of Benefits Form, which is an agreement, assigns the “remaining
insurance amounts” owed to A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C. and its owner, Stacy Morgan. This
allows the plaintiffs to pursue the claims under the insurance policy directly against AIC in lieu
of proceeding against the AIC insured, Hollis Burton. As discussed infra in the legal argument
section, these assignment of benefits contracts are valid in the State of Louisiana. In particular,
they are absolutely valid especially when they are created on a “post-loss” basis, i.e., after the fire
occurrence had already occurred in the instant mater.

See Exhibit “B” – Statement of Lien and Privilege Pursuant To La. Rev. Statute 9:4801, Et. Seq. Filed by A-Plus
Contractors, L.L.C. evidencing the remaining amount of $43,511.32 still owed on this job by Hollis Burton, and, by
virtue of the Assignment Of Benefits Form, America’s Insurance Company.

The assignment benefits contract provides for the assignment of the insurance benefits
and rights to the plaintiffs, including those rights provided under the insurance bad faith statutes
codified in 22:1892 and 22:1973 on a post-loss basis. Second, the failure of the AIC policy of
insurance to specify that no assignment could occur on a “post-loss” basis is fatal to the motion
filed by AIC under established Louisiana Supreme Court jurisprudence.
II. LAW AND ARGUMENT
A. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is “rarely granted.” Myers v.
Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 5 F. Supp 2d 423 (D.Miss. 1998), citing Clark v. Amoco Prod. Co.,
794 F.2d 967, 970 (5th Cir. 1986); Sosa v. Coleman, 646 F.2d 991, 993 (5th Cir. 1981). The Court
must construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff and assume the truth of the facts pleaded.
Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., 188 F. 3d 579, 586 (5th Cir. 1999). The complaint should not be
dismissed unless “it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be
proved consistent with the allegations.” Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984). A
pleading will survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss if it alleges “enough facts to state a claim
to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570. “A claim has
facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556
U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The court must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations as true. Twombly,
550 U.S. at 550. Dikan v. Cypress Bend Resort, No. CIV.A. 12-2626, 2013 WL 2244635, at *2
(W.D. La. May 21, 2013)

B. SUMMARY OF RESPONSE TO MOTION
First, AIC seemingly agrees that the Assignment of Benefits Contract executed between
the plaintiffs and the AIC insured, Hollis Burton, is valid, except for an alleged lack of consent by
AIC for the assignment. That latter issue is refuted by Louisiana Law on post-loss assignment
clauses in the State of Louisiana. Second, the supposed analogous case cited by AIC in R.L. Lucien
Tile Co., Inc. ex re. Cage v. Am. Sec. In. Co. is not analogous. That case did not deal with an
assignment of insurance benefits or rights for a post-loss occurrence or event; it related only to a
general quitclaim.4 Finally, Louisiana Law recognizes the applicability of post-loss assignment of
benefits and rights contracts which can provide the assignee with full rights, including those for
bad faith insurance treatment under 22:1892 and 22:1973.
C. This Case Concerns A Post-Loss Insurance Assignment Of Rights And Benefits.
Absent Policy Terminology Prohibiting The “Post-Loss” Assignment In The AIC
Policy Of Insurance, The Louisiana Supreme Court In re Katrina Canal Breaches
Litig., 2010-1823 (La. 5/10/11), 63 So. 3d 955, 963 Elucidated These Post-Loss
Assignments As Enforceable.
In the Louisiana Supreme Court case in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 2010-1823
(La. 5/10/11), 63 So. 3d 955, 960–61 the Court examined the differences between pre-loss and
post-loss assignment of rights/benefits contracts. The Court reasoned:
While Geddes [a seminal case on assignments] was decided prior to the enactment
of Article 2653, Geddes correctly expresses the prevailing American rule
distinguishing between pre-loss and post-loss assignments.9 In differentiating
between the two, courts reason that allowing an insured to assign the right to
4

Indeed, AIC fails to cite this part of the R.L. Lucien opinion which recognized that the alleged assignment did not
pertain to insurance proceeds:
Nor does the language of this document assign any interest in the ASIC insurance policy to Lucien
Tile. This document indicates that the Cages were assigning to Lucien Tile a claim arising under
fair debt collection practice law pursuant to and pertinent to the EMC mortgage
R.L. Lucien Tile Co., Inc. ex rel. Cage v. Am. Sec. Ins. Co., 2008-1190 (La. App. 4 Cir. 3/11/09), 8
So. 3d 753, 756

Case 2:16-cv-13900-JTM-KWR Document 15 Filed 12/20/16 Page 5 of 9

coverage (pre-loss) would force the insurer to protect an insured with whom it had
not contracted-an insured who might present a greater level of risk than the
policyholder. However, allowing an insured to assign its right to the proceeds of an
insurance policy (post-loss) does not modify the insurer's risk. The insurer's
obligations are fixed at the time the loss occurs, and the insurer is obligated to cover
the loss agreed to under the terms of the policy. This obligation is not altered when
the claimant is not the party who was originally insured.
Most importantly, the Court in In Re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. stated:
Although we hold that parties may contract to prohibit post-loss assignments,
we also hold the contract language must clearly and unambiguously express
that the non-assignment clause applies to post-loss assignments.5
In the instant matter the AIC policy says nothing about post-loss assignments. As required
by In Re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. any anti-assignment clause must have clearly and
unambiguously applied to a “post-loss” assignment.

6

The decision in In Re Katrina Canal

Breaches Litig. came after and clearly distinguished the holding and reasoning in AIC’s chief case,
R.L. Lucien Tile Co., Inc. Here, the assignment of insurance benefits contract executed between
A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C., Stacy Morgan, and the AIC insured, Hollis Burton occurred post-loss;
it occurred after the fire took place. A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C. was the construction entity hired
to make repairs to the home after the fire loss. The fire indisputably occurred prior to A-Plus
Contractors, L.L.C. being hired by Hollis Burton, and well before the Assignment of Insurance
5

Id. at 963. The Court further stated:
Insurance is a highly regulated industry, and insurers are well aware of the distinction between preloss and post-loss assignments. Post-loss assignment of claims arising under the policy is not
equivalent to the assignment of the policy itself, or an interest in the policy. Given the categorical
difference, we find it incumbent on insurers to include clear and unambiguous language in their
policies. We do not find it necessary to formulate a test consisting of specific terms or words,
however the insurer must include language making it clear and explicit that post-loss assignments
are prohibited under the policy.
In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 2010-1823 (La. 5/10/11), 63 So. 3d 955, 963

Indeed, on page 34 of the AIC policy, the section “Assignment” reads as follows without any mention of the postloss phraseology:
6

“E. Assignment
Assignment of this policy will not be valid unless we give our written consent.”

Case 2:16-cv-13900-JTM-KWR Document 15 Filed 12/20/16 Page 6 of 9

Benefits Form was signed. Thus, under the Louisiana Supreme Court’s directive In Re Katrina
Canal Breaches Litig., the assignment is absolutely valid since the AIC policy does not prohibit
“post-loss” assignment of benefits/rights as required by the doctrine in In Re Katrina Canal
Breaches Litig.
D. AIC Cites No Law Or Case To Support Its Position That Insurance Bad Faith
Penalties Allowed Under The Bad Faith Treatment Statutes Cannot Be Assigned.
In Fact, The Eastern District Of Louisiana Has Stated That Bad Faith Penalties
Can Be Assigned.
AIC only cited the later Louisiana Supreme Court distinguished R.L. Lucien Tile Co. case
in its argument that the plaintiffs cannot be validly assigned penalties under the bad faith statutes
codified in La. R.S. 22:1892 and 22:1973. Yet, there is no statute which prohibits the plaintiffs
from being assigned all rights under the policy of insurance issued by AIC to its insured, Hollis
Burton. This particularly applies since this was a post-loss assignment, which is absolutely allowed
under the jurisprudential progeny in the Louisiana Supreme Court decision In Re Katrina Canal
Breaches Litig., which absolutely distinguished the quitclaim situation in R.L. Lucien Tile Co.
The Louisiana Supreme Court has long recognized that the freedom to contract is an
important public policy. See Barrera v. Ciolino, 92–2844 (La.5/5/94), 636 So.2d 218, 223.
(“[P]arties are free to contract for any object that is lawful, possible, and determined or
determinable. La. C.C. art. 1971. “Freedom of contract” signifies that parties to an agreement have
the right and power to construct their own bargains. In a free enterprise system, parties are free to
contract except for those instances where the government places restrictions for reasons of public
policy. The state may legitimately restrict the parties' right to contract if the proposed bargain is
found to have some deleterious effect on the public or to contravene some other matter of public
policy.) citing: Louisiana Smoked Products, Inc. v. Savoie's Sausage and Food Products, Inc., 96–
1716 (La.7/1/97), 696 So.2d 1373,1380–81.

Case 2:16-cv-13900-JTM-KWR Document 15 Filed 12/20/16 Page 7 of 9

Under Louisiana law, “all rights may be assigned, with the exception of those pertaining
to obligations that are strictly personal. The assignee is subrogated to the rights of the assignor
against the debtor.” La. Civ. Code art. 2642. When an obligee's rights are assigned to another, the
assignee “steps into the shoes” of the obligee. Hose v. Younger Bros., Inc., 878 So.2d 548, 550
(La.Ct.App.2004). The assignee “acquires only those rights possessed by its assignor at the time
of assignment.” Del-Remy Corp. v. Lafayette Ins. Co., 616 So.2d 231, 233 (La.Ct.App.1993). Most
importantly, the right to pursue damages for an insurer's failure to comply with its duties is not
such a strictly personal obligation. Steirwald v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 2001 WL 617542 at *2 (E.D. La.
May 30, 2001). Although the insurer's duties are owed only to the insured, “claims for breach of
[those] duties [may] be asserted by ... someone who derives his right from the insured.” Id. (quoting
William Shelby McKenzie and H. Alston Johnson, Insurance Law and Practice, 15 Louisiana Civil
Law Treatise at ¶ 222). “Accordingly, the Court finds that article 2642 allowed Pontchartrain
to assign any nascent causes of action under 22:1220 to Viper.” Pontchartrain Gardens, Inc.
v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co., No. CIV.A. 07-7965, 2009 WL 86671, at *5 (E.D. La. Jan. 13, 2009)
Under a 12(B)(6) analysis, in which this Court must accept all of the pled allegation as true,
the motion filed by AIC must be dismissed. A valid, post-loss assignment of insurance benefits
exists between the plaintiffs and the AIC insured, Hollis Burton. The AIC policy does not prohibit
a post-loss assignment, which is fatal to AIC’s entire motion. Moreover, the jurisprudence above
states that penalties under the bad faith insurance statutes can be assigned. The plaintiffs validly
obtains an assignment of the insurance benefits from the AIC insured, Hollis Burton, through the
attached assignment.

III. CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, plaintiffs, Stacy Morgan and A-Plus Contractors, L.L.C., through counsel
of record, request that this Court deny the instant motion filed by AMERICAS INSURANCE
COMPANY.

Simply-put, the standards required for this Court to grant a 12(b)(6) Motion To

Dismiss are high and not present in the instant motion. A valid assignment of rights/benefits
contract exists between the plaintiffs and the AIC insured, Hollis Burton. Louisiana Jurisprudence
is replete with decisions allowing for such an assignment to be valid, which transfers all of the
post-loss insurance rights and benefits available to Hollis Burton from AIC, to the plaintiffs in this
matter. Further, the Eastern District has stated that bad faith penalties available by virtue of an
insurance contract are not personal in nature, and can be validly assigned.
