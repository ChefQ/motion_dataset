NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
This is an action for patent infringement brought by Plaintiff Regalo International, LLC

(“Regalo”) under the Patent Laws of the United States, Title 35 of the United States Code, §§ 1
et seq. Defendant Munchkin, Inc. (“Munchkin”) has answered the Complaint and the Court has
Ordered the parties to meet and confer on the matters listed on Chief Judge Stark’s Case
Management Checklist. No other activities have taken place in this matter to-date.
II.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1.

Plaintiff Regalo’s attorneys in this intellectual property matter, the law firm of

Panitch Schwarze Belisario & Nadel LLP, served as intellectual property attorneys for defendant
Munchkin for seven years, from 2008 through 2014—and not merely for boilerplate matters or in
connection with one-off requests. Rather, the Panitch firm, through Laura Genovese, served as
outside global trademark counsel for Munchkin. As a result, the Panitch firm handled hundreds
of matters for Munchkin requiring continuous, specific advice in relation to innumerable unique
issues.

This broad and deep representation brought the Panitch firm into contact with

confidential information regarding all aspects of Munchkin’s business, including its litigation
strategies and philosophies.
2.

In addition, Ms. Genovese in the course of her work for Munchkin specifically

shared confidential Munchkin information with Mr. Fred Tecce—a Panitch attorney who now
appears as counsel for Regalo on the pleadings in this case. Specifically, Ms. Genovese provided
key information about Munchkin’s litigation disposition and strategies to Mr. Tecce, in order to
allow him to attempt to obtain additional business from Munchkin, including intellectual
property litigation. The Model Rules of Professional Conduct are designed to prevent just such a
situation. As such, the Court should disqualify the Panitch firm from representing Regalo in this
matter.

III.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
The law firm of Panitch Schwarze Belisario & Nadel LLP, which represents plaintiff

Regalo International, LLC in this patent infringement action, continuously represented Munchkin
Inc. in conjunction with a significant number of intellectual property matters from January 2008
through December 2014. (See Declaration of Laura Genovese (“Genovese Decl.”), ¶¶ 3-4).
Specifically, Laura Genovese has served as Munchkin’s outside global trademark counsel
for approximately twenty-five years, and has handled or been involved in virtually all of
Munchkin’s trademark applications in the United States and abroad throughout its entire
corporate history. (Genovese Decl., ¶¶ 4-5). Ms. Genovese was an attorney at the Panitch firm
from January 2008 through December 2014, and was a partner at the firm from January 2012
until December 2014. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 3). She served as outside global trademark counsel for
Munchkin during her entire tenure at the Panitch firm. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 4).
While she was an attorney at the Panitch firm, and as a result of her roles as outside
global trademark counsel for Munchkin, Ms. Genovese was frequently exposed to confidential
business information concerning not only Munchkin’s trademark portfolio and corresponding
strategies, but also related issues like Munchkin’s licensing positions and strategies, product
development and placement strategies, and overall market positioning strategies. (Genovese
Decl., ¶ 6). She was also frequently exposed to Munchkin’s confidential litigation information,
including Munchkin’s litigation philosophies, strategies, and risk tolerances. (Genovese Decl., ¶
7). In fact, she provided firsthand assistance with strategy development, factual discovery, and
document production in certain Munchkin litigation matters. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 7).
The scope of Ms. Genovese’s work for Munchkin while at the Panitch firm was
significant. Indeed, she had approximately fifty (50) open matters at any given time, and she
transferred 152 matters away from Panitch when she left the firm in December 2014. (Genovese
2

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 6 of 14 PageID #: 208

Decl., ¶ 9). Ms. Genovese saved documents and communications from all of her matters and
other communications with Munchkin in Panitch’s system. (Genovese Decl., ¶¶ 6-7).
Since the beginning of 2008, the Panitch firm invoiced Munchkin approximately
$667,267 for legal work performed on Munchkin’s behalf. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 10). The work
performed by Panitch on behalf of Munchkin included work done by two individuals – Keith
Jones and Donna Marks – who are still employed at Panitch. Id. Mr. Jones is an Associate who
spends a substantial amount of his time working on IP litigation cases such as this matter. Id.
While a partner at the Panitch firm, Ms. Genovese also communicated confidential
information to other Panitch attorneys, including specifically one of the attorneys identified as
counsel of record in this action. (Genovese Decl., ¶¶ 11-12). Indeed, Ms. Genovese frequently
shared information about Munchkin’s business and its active and prospective intellectual
property matters at Panitch’s partnership meetings.

(Genovese Decl., ¶ 12).

Even more

specifically, Ms. Genovese arranged for Fred Tecce, an intellectual property attorney at Panitch
and counsel of record in this case, to meet with Munchkin’s General Counsel and its Chief
Executive Officer, in order for Mr. Tecce to pitch Panitch’s intellectual property litigation
services. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 11). In preparation for this meeting, Ms. Genovese gave Mr. Tecce
a detailed explanation of Munchkin’s business and intellectual property and informed him about
Munchkin’s litigation activities, including specifically its litigation philosophies, decisionmaking, and prior strategies in intellectual property cases. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 11). She also
directed Mr. Tecce to certain Munchkin litigation documents held by Panitch.

Mr. Tecce

subsequently met with Ms. Rader and Mr. Dunn at Munchkin’s headquarters. (Genovese Decl.,
¶ 11).

3

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 7 of 14 PageID #: 209

After Ms. Genovese left the Panitch firm, her Panitch e-mail account remained active
even as she had no access to it. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 13). Moreover, e-mails sent to her Panitch email address were routed directly to a remaining partner at Panitch. As a result, Panitch received
e-mails from and about Munchkin that the sender intended to send to Ms. Genovese, including
specifically communications and documents concerning a market study that Munchkin had
conducted. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 13). Despite Ms. Genovese’s requests that Panitch deactivate her
e-mail account, Panitch continued to receive and re-route e-mails sent to her address until
November 2015, almost a year after she left the firm. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 13).
That very same month, Mr. Tecce and Mr. Butler of the Panitch firm filed the complaint
in this case, alleging that Munchkin is infringing Regalo’s patents. Munchkin did not give the
Panitch firm consent to represent Regalo in this action, nor did the Panitch firm seek such
consent.
IV.

ARGUMENT
A.

Legal standards.

Motions to disqualify counsel are governed by the ethical standards of the court before
which the relevant attorneys appear, and the District of Delaware has adopted the Model Rules of
Professional Conduct (“M.R.P.C.”). Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Checkpoint Software Techs.
Ltd., No. 10-1067-LPS, 2011 WL 2692968, *5 (D. Del. June 22, 2011). Two specific rules are
pertinent here: M.R.P.C. Rules 1.9 and 1.10.
Rule 1.9(a) governs a lawyer’s duties to former clients:
A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter
represent another person in the same or substantially related matter in which that
person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless
the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.

4

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 8 of 14 PageID #: 210

This Court has held that three questions are relevant in determining whether a current matter is
“substantially related” to a matter in a former representation: “(1) What is the nature and scope
of the prior representation at issue? (2) What is the nature of the present lawsuit against the
former client? (3) In the course of the prior representation, might the client have disclosed to his
attorney confidences which could be relevant to the present action?” Intellectual Ventures I,
2011 WL 2692968 at *5 (internal quotation omitted).
Rule 1.10(a) generally imputes a conflict of interest for an individual lawyer to all
lawyers associated in a firm, while Rule 1.10(b) specifically governs imputed conflicts when the
representing attorney is no longer associated with the firm:
When a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm is not
prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests adverse to those of
a client represented by the formerly associated lawyer and not currently
represented by the firm, unless:
(1) the matter is the same or substantially related to that in which the formerly
associated lawyer represented the client; and
(2) any lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by Rules 1.6 and
1.9(c) that is material to the matter.
Taken together, an analysis under Rules 1.9(a) and 1.10(b) turns on whether the representations
at issue are “substantially related” and whether the remaining lawyers in a firm possess a former
client’s material, confidential information.
Generally speaking, “disqualification is proper when the similarity in the two
representations is enough to raise a common-sense inference that what the lawyer learned from
his former client will prove useful in his representation of another client whose interests are
adverse to those of the former client.” Intellectual Ventures I, 2011 WL 2692968 at *5 (internal
quotation omitted). Any doubts should be resolved in favor of the party seeking disqualification,
“in order to ensure protection of client confidences.” Id.

B.

Regalo’s interests are materially adverse to Munchkin’s interests.

As an initial matter, there can be no dispute that Regalo’s interests in this matter (this
lawsuit) are materially adverse to Munchkin’s interests. Indeed, the parties are on opposite sides
of the same litigation matter. As a result, this matter triggers the “materially adverse” prong of
both M.R.P.C. Rules 1.9(a) and 1.10(b).
C.

This matter is substantially related to matters for which Panitch previously
represented Munchkin.

The Panitch firm formerly represented Munchkin by way of Ms. Genovese’s
representation of Munchkin while an attorney at that firm. Indeed, the Model Rules reflect the
principles that “a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer” for purposes of the duty of loyalty to
a client, and that “each lawyer is vicariously bound by the obligation of loyalty owed by each
lawyer with whom the lawyer is associated.” M.R.P.C. Rule 1.10 cmt. [2]. As a result, Rule
1.10(b) prohibits the Panitch firm from representing Munchkin even after Ms. Genovese’s
departure in matters substantially related to those handled by Ms. Genovese while she was at
Panitch (if current Panitch lawyers possess material, confidential Munchkin information). Here,
Panitch’s representation of Regalo is substantially related to Ms. Genovese’s representation of
Munchkin while at Panitch.
As noted above, the first consideration in determining whether two representations are
substantially related is “the nature and scope of the prior representation.” Intellectual Ventures I,
2011 WL 2692968 at *5. In this case, the scope and nature of Ms. Genovese’s representation of
Munchkin not only centrally involved intellectual property, but was both broad and deep. Ms.
Genovese’s representation of Munchkin was not merely restricted to general advice on a one-off
basis, but consisted of a continuous flow of numerous matters (during all seven of her years at
Panitch), all of which required detailed advice about innumerable specific intellectual property
6

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 10 of 14 PageID #: 212

issues. Moreover, because Ms. Genovese, as Munchkin’s outside global trademark counsel, was
involved with virtually all of Munchkin’s trademarks throughout its entire history, she had
detailed, in-depth exposure to numerous other issues relating to Munchkin’s business and
intellectual property litigation matters, including Munchkin’s strategies and strategic
philosophies. In short, Munchkin intimately trusted Ms. Genovese—and thus the Panitch firm—
as a comprehensive business advisor.
Regarding “the nature of the present lawsuit against the former client”—the second
consideration in determining whether two representations are substantially related—Regalo in
this action alleges that Munchkin has infringed three of its patents relating to bed rail systems.
See Intellectual Ventures I, 2011 WL 2692968 at *5. Regalo seeks damages and injunctive
relief. (See D.I. 1).
Although the full extent of this action is not yet known, it already implicates a number of
issues with respect to which the Panitch firm previously represented Munchkin. As an initial
matter, both this action and Panitch’s prior matters for Munchkin centrally involve(d) intellectual
property rights. All of the relevant Panitch attorneys here—from Ms. Genovese to Messrs.
Tecce and Butler—all practice intellectual property law almost exclusively. Although Regalo
will no doubt argue that Ms. Genovese never represented Munchkin directly in connection with
patent infringement matters, this Court has held that matters related to intellectual property rights
broadly involve the same subject matter for purposes of assessing a motion for disqualification
even if the particulars of the intellectual property issues are not identical. See Intellectual
Ventures I, 2011 WL 2692968 at *10.
Moreover, Ms. Genovese’s dealings with and exposure to Munchkin’s licensing positions
and strategies, product development and placement strategies, and overall market positioning

7

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 11 of 14 PageID #: 213

strategies are relevant to this action.

(See Genovese Decl., ¶ 6).

Munchkin’s product

development and placement strategies necessarily implicate all intellectual property infringement
issues, while its licensing positions and strategies implicate Regalo’s request for damages
(including in the form of a reasonable royalty). Perhaps even more importantly, Ms. Genovese’s
knowledge of Munchkin’s litigation philosophies, strategies, and risk tolerances—particularly in
the context of intellectual property actions—implicates virtually every aspect of Regalo’s current
action against Munchkin. (See Genovese Decl., ¶ 7). Indeed, this information could impact and
inform Regalo’s own strategies in bringing and maintaining this action.
This last point is particularly pertinent to the final consideration of whether Munchkin
might have disclosed confidences to the Panitch firm that could be relevant to this action. See
Intellectual Ventures I, 2011 WL 2692968 at *5. As explained above, Ms. Genovese shared key
confidential information about Munchkin’s business and litigation strategies and experiences
with Mr. Tecce. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 12). Not only that, she did so in order to better position Mr.
Tecce to obtain work from Munchkin that is exactly like the work Mr. Tecce is now doing for
Regalo—and against Munchkin. (Genovese Decl., ¶ 12). Mr. Tecce therefore has the benefit of
an intimate, insider view of Munchkin in relation to intellectual property litigation.

His

knowledge of Munchkin’s tendencies and prior strategies could inform everything from how
many and what type of claims to bring in this action, to how to pursue discovery, to how to
position any settlement strategy, to what witnesses to depose, to how to depose those witnesses,
and so on.
Certainly, the lengthy, continuous, and in-depth nature of Ms. Genovese’s representation
of Munchkin in relation to intellectual property matters sets a striking backdrop to Panitch’s
representation of Regalo in this matter. As this Court has recognized, “the most important”

8

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 12 of 14 PageID #: 214

consideration in assessing disqualification is “protecting former client’s confidences.”
Intellectual Ventures I, 2011 WL 2692968 at *9. In that case, the Court found that there was “at
least a common sense inference” that the information a firm learned in its prior representation of
a client would prove relevant and harmful to that client in the firm’s subsequent representation of
an adverse party. Id. at *11. That is exactly the case here. Given Ms. Genovese’s representation
of Munchkin while at the Panitch firm and her sharing of information with Mr. Tecce, Panitch’s
representation of Regalo through Mr. Tecce himself in this case raises at least a common sense
inference that Mr. Tecce and Panitch possess relevant information that is harmful to Munchkin—
and advantageous to Panitch and Regalo.
D.

Current Panitch attorneys, including attorneys of record in this case, possess
confidential Munchkin information material to this matter.

Rule 1.10(b)(2)’s requirement that lawyers remaining at a firm possess confidential
information overlaps substantially with the final factor discussed above for assessing whether
two representations are substantially related pursuant to Rule 1.9 (whether Munchkin might have
disclosed confidences to the Panitch firm that could be relevant to this action). In this context,
and for all of the reasons noted above, Mr. Tecce’s inside knowledge of Munchkin’s confidential
business and litigation strategies is undoubtedly material to this matter.
The Panitch firm itself plainly views Mr. Tecce’s involvement in this case to be a benefit
to Regalo, and that is precisely why he is on the pleadings. Indeed, given the Panitch firm’s
recent history as attorneys for Munchkin and Mr. Tecce’s more specific knowledge of and
contact with Munchkin, there is little reason for the firm to put Mr. Tecce on this case, save the
fact that it gives the firm and its client, Regalo, a significant advantage here. To any observer—
and most certainly to the relevant former client, Munchkin—the only plausible implication based
on these facts is that the Panitch firm is leveraging its significant, continuous representation of
9

Case 1:15-cv-01103-LPS-CJB Document 14 Filed 03/01/16 Page 13 of 14 PageID #: 215

Munchkin over a number of years to further its own benefit and that of its adverse client. The
facts therefore trigger Rule 1.10(b)’s prohibition, disqualifying the Panitch firm in this matter.
E.

A screen will not cure the conflict, and the Panitch firm apparently has not
implemented a screen, in any event.

The Panitch firm cannot rely upon any internal screen to avoid disqualification in this
matter, either. As an initial matter, it is clear that the Panitch firm has not initiated any such
screen. Indeed, if the Panitch firm had so initiated a screen, it almost certainly would have
prevented Mr. Tecce from communicating with anyone at Panitch about this case, let alone
appear on the pleadings. Mr. Tecce’s appearance on the pleadings suggests that the Panitch firm
was not at all concerned about any potential conflict it might have in this matter on account of its
prior representation of Munchkin.
Likewise, it is far too late for the Panitch firm to initiate a meaningful screen. Given that
Mr. Tecce has already participated in this matter and almost certainly advised Regalo based upon
his exposure to Munchkin and its confidential information, the proverbial cat is already out of the
bag. The Court should not allow the Panitch firm to escape disqualification through any ad hoc
attempt or promise of an internal screen.
V.

CONCLUSION
Common sense dictates the result here.

The only possible way to protect client

confidences—as well as further a system that appears to protect client confidences—is to
disqualify the Panitch firm from representing Regalo in this matter.

Munchkin therefore

respectfully requests that the Court do so, and grant such further relief as it deems just and
proper.
