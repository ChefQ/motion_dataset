IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
SAN ANTONIO DIVISION
JOANNA CASTRO,
PLAINTIFF
Case No. 5:18-CV-312-DAE

V.
ALBERT SALINAS,
DEFENDANT

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION
TO DEFENDANT’S FRCP 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS

Introduction

Plaintiff filed this civil rights lawsuit on April 6, 2018. (Dkt. #1.) This action is brought
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and the United States Constitution. The Defendant
first responded with a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkt.
#3.) Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint within 21 days of service of Defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss. (Dkt. #4.) Defendant responded with a new Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. #5.) Defendant has
not filed an answer admitting or denying the allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint.
Brief Summary of the Facts
On February 20, 2018, Plaintiff Castro sought to film the police in Olmos Park, Texas. (Dkt.
#4 at 2.) Defendant Salinas intentionally prevented Plaintiff Castro from filming the police by
charging at her, unconstitutionally ordering her to put down her camera, and knocking the camera out
1

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 2 of 15

of her hand. Id. at 3. While Plaintiff Castro did nothing to interfere with Defendant Police Officer
Salinas, was compliant, and obeyed his orders to “get back,” Defendant Salinas shoved her with such
force that he almost knocked her to the ground and he bruised her. Id. at 4.
Immediately after the encounter, according to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss with exhibits,
Defendant Salinas entered a report that Plaintiff Castro complied with his orders, omitting the fact
that he charged at her, slapped her, and shoved her. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2.) Later, likely anticipating this
lawsuit, Defendant Salinas entered a different report, minimizing and justifying his physical contact
with Castro, and seeking to criminalize Castro with a charge of interfering with him. Id., Ex. B4. His
later report directly contradicted his initial report charactering Castro as compliant. Id. Plaintiff
Castro was arrested because of Defendant Salinas’s false report of interference. (Dkt. #4 at 4, 6.)
The charge was dismissed for insufficient evidence by the Bexar County District Attorney’s Office.
Id. at 6. After this lawsuit was filed, on April 23, 2018, Defendant Salinas looked back at his initial
report, which first indicated that Castro complied with his orders, and Salinas changed his story,
reporting that the “she complied” language was a mistake on his part. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B3.)

Summary of the Argument
A true FRCP 12(b)(6) Motion admits the facts alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint, but
challenges Plaintiff’s right to recovery on those admitted facts. See Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198,
203 (5th Cir. 1995). Defendant’s purported 12(b)(6) Motion is a misnamed Motion for Summary
Judgment, including affidavits and video exhibits that are not referenced in Plaintiff’s live pleading
and which substantially contradict Plaintiff’s version of the facts. (See Dkt. #5 at 5.) An FRCP
2

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 3 of 15

12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss should be decided solely on the allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint.
Speaker v. U.S. Dept. of H&HS Ctrs. For Disease Control & Prevention, 623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th
Cir. 2010). If the Court decides to consider the material attached to Defendant’s Motion, the Motion
should be converted to a Motion for Summary Judgment; in which case, Plaintiff needs time to
conduct discovery. General Retail Servs., Inc. v. Wireless Toyz Franchise, LLC, 255 F. App’x 775,
783 (5th Cir. 2007). The parties have not had an adequate time for discovery. Defense counsel on
June 12, 2018 refused to conference on a docket control order until after the resolution of
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. (Plf. Ex. A.) Plaintiff will be prejudiced if Defendant’s exhibits are
considered because she has not had an opportunity to depose the defendant or other affiants, gather
internal police department communications to conclusively demonstrate the improper motivation for
seeking an arrest warrant, gather evidence that the defendant’s offense report was substantially
changed in anticipation of litigation, and demonstrate that the defendant’s body camera video is
inaccurate, among other items of prejudice.
Further, Defendant attaches exhibits to his motion that are not admissible. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2,
B, 3, B4, C4, C5, C7, C8.) Materials prepared for litigation purposes are inadmissible hearsay under
Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), and FRE 803(8)(A)(ii) excludes a police officer’s recorded
statement if made in a criminal case by a police officer. Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Xanthas, Inc., 855
F.2d 233 (5th Cir. 1988); See United States v. Cain, 615 F.2d 380, 382 (5th Cir. 1980). Defendant’s
Exhibits B2, B3, B4, C4, C5, C6, C7, and C8 are inadmissible statements made by a police officer
for a criminal case. Plaintiff hereby objects to those exhibits. Defendant’s Exhibit D is also
objectionable, as it essentially attempts to provide a legal conclusion by the City Secretary of Olmos
3

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 4 of 15

Park, claiming to apply the Olmos Park city code to events on February 20, 2018. See FRE 702.
Finally, when reviewing the Plaintiff’s well pleaded facts, assuming their truth, this case falls
under the Fifth Circuit’s First and Fourth Amendment precedent found in Turner v. Lieutenant
Driver, 848 F.3d 678 (5th Cir. 2017). In Turner, the Fifth Circuit held that filming the police in a
public place is a First Amendment protected activity: “We agree with every circuit that has ruled on
this question: Each has concluded that the First Amendment protects the right to record the police.”
Id. at 690. Plaintiff had a clearly established First Amendment protected right to film the defendant
police officer, and by yelling at Plaintiff to put down her camera and slapping it out of her hands,
Officer Salinas violated that clearly established right. Compare (Dkt. #4 at 3-5) with Turner. Further,
Plaintiff had a clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from an arrest made without
probable cause. Id. at 693. Here, like in Turner, arresting a person that did nothing more than film
the police is unreasonable, and therefore violates the Fourth Amendment: “Based on the allegations
of [Castro’s] amended complaint, the officers lacked probable cause to arrest [her].” Id. at 694.
I. Defendant Moves for Motion for Summary Judgment, and
Plaintiff Needs Time for Discovery.
Defendant cites Brand Coupon for the proposition that the Court may consider his attached
exhibits in a FRCP 12(b)(6) Motion. (Dkt. #5 at 5.) The Fifth Circuit explained that attachments to a
12(b)(6) motion could be considered “because ‘[n]o party question[ed] the authenticity of these two
documents and both were sufficiently referenced in the complain to permit their consideration on a
motion to dismiss.’” Collins, 748 F.3d at 637, N.10. Plaintiff does not cite any of Defendant’s
exhibits in her First Amended Complaint, and her factual allegations conflict with the contents of
Defendant’s exhibits.
4

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 5 of 15

For example: Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that as she filmed the police, Defendant
Salinas yelled at her to put down her camera and get back. (Dkt. #4 at 3.) She alleges that she
obeyed the order to get back, and backed away from Defendant Salinas repeatedly. (Dkt. #4 at 5.)
She alleges that Defendant Salinas slapped the cameras out of her hand, having yelled at her to put
the camera down. Id. He hit her with such force that he hurt her. Id. Defendant Salinas’s sole
purpose for engaging Plaintiff Castro was to prevent her from filming, as he was unconcerned with
her after he knocked the cameras out of her hands. Id. These allegations in Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint contradict the objectionable hearsay contained in Defendant Salinas’s subsequent offense
reports. See (Dkt. #5, Ex. B3.)1 Note, too, that Defendant Salinas’s offense report statements
substantially changed over time. Immediately after the incident, he reported that Plaintiff Castro
complied with his orders to get back. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2.) Then, later, he indicated that “the last
sentence should have read ‘I told her several times to get back and she did not comply.’ I instead of
reading ‘she complied.’” [sic] (Dkt. #5, Ex. B3.) Nowhere in his report does Defendant Salinas state
that he prevented Castro from filming, or that he rammed her with enough force to hurt her.
Nowhere in his report does Defendant Salinas report that the other officer told Salinas to leave
Castro alone, or “not worry about” Castro. (Dkt. #5, Def. Ex. C3 at time 9:24:40-9:25:00.)
Later, to justify the Texas Penal Code §38.15(b) charge against Castro, Defendant Salinas

Please note that Officer Salinas swears in his Affidavit in Defendant’s Exhibit B that he is attaching
true and accurate copies of his reports, but he does not swear to the actual contents of – the
statements made in – the reports. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B.) Exhibits B2 and B3 directly conflict with each
other. See Alspaugh v. McConnell, 643 F.3d 162, 168 (6th Cir. 2011) (regarding the problem of
credibility of a witness in summary judgment proof).
1

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 6 of 15

changed his story to indicate that he “had to physically guide [Castro] back a couple of times.” (Dkt.
#5, Ex. B4.) He claimed that Castro got so close to him that she could have easily disarmed him. Id.
He failed to mention that he charged at Castro, pointing his rifle at her, for the sole purpose of
slapping the cameras out of her hands, as she repeatedly backed away from him. This stands in stark
contrast to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (Dkt. #4 at 5) and Defendant Salinas’s own initial
report that Castro complied with his commands. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2.)
Please note that the offense report attached to Defendant’s Exhibit B1 starts on the second
page of that report, omitting the first page. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B1.) Please note also that Defendant’s
Exhibit B2 indicates that Defendant Salinas’s initial report date and time was February 20, 2018 at
21:41, wherein he stated that Castro complied with his orders to move back. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2.)
Then, after Castro filed the instant lawsuit on April 23, 2018 at 11:26, Defendant Salinas changed
his story to report that Castro did not comply. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B3.) On March 19, 2018, his story
changed to justify the TPC §38.15 interference charge for which Castro was arrested, which the
Bexar County District Attorney’s Office immediately dismissed for insufficient evidence. (Dkt. #5,
Ex. B4); (Dkt. #4 at 6.)
Because the exhibits attached to Defendant’s Motion were not referenced in Plaintiff’s
complaint, and they substantially contradict Plaintiff’s allegations of Constitutional rights violations,
Defendant’s Motion is a Motion for Summary Judgment, not a motion to dismiss on the pleadings.
By attaching these exhibits, Defendant is not “merely assist[ing] the plaintiff in establishing the basis
of the suit,” but is instead impermissibly fighting over the facts. Contrast Venture Assocs. Corp. v.
Zenith Data Sys. Corp., 987 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir. 1993).
6

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 7 of 15

Because Defendant Salinas’s statements substantially contradict Plaintiff Castro’s version of
events, and he even contradicted himself over time, Plaintiff needs to be able to depose Defendant
Salina, as well as the other affiants, and gather additional records to conclusively demonstrate
Salinas’s intent to violate Castro’s Constitutional rights. Please note that Defendant’s Exhibit B5 –
footage Defendant claims is his body camera recording – does not support Defendant’s version of
events, and there is an audio glitch at about the time when Castro alleges that the other officer told
Defendant Salinas to leave Castro alone, or “not worry about that.” (Dkt. #4 at 3); accord (Dkt. #5,
Def. Ex. C3 at time 9:24:40-25:07.) Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that the other officer’s
instruction to Defendant Salinas to not worry about Castro was audible from her position. See (Dkt.
#4 at 3.) The do-not-worry statement is certainly audible in the other officer’s video. (Dkt. #5, Def.
Ex. C3.) That glitch in Defendant Salinas’s body camera audio found in Defendant’s Exhibit B5
needs to be addressed in discovery, as it goes to the heart of what Salinas knew under the totality of
the circumstance. Plaintiff will be prejudiced if this Motion is decided without the benefit of
discovery to flesh out the contradictions that go to the core of Defendant Salinas’s intent to prevent
Castro from filming, attempt to break her cameras, and intent to criminalize her after-the-fact, likely
having realized he was subject to a §1983 Civil Rights lawsuit for his misconduct.
Plaintiff attempted to conference with Defendant’s counsel on a docket control order on June
11, 2018, but defense counsel was unwilling to work on this case before his motion to dismiss was
decided. (Plf. Ex. A.) Plaintiff prays that the Court give the parties time for discovery before
considering a Motion for Summary Judgment. No discovery has been conducted.

II. Plaintiff Objects to Defendant’s Inadmissible Offense Reports and Other Hearsay.
Defendant attaches exhibits to his motion that are not admissible. (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2, B3, B4,
C4, C5, C7, C8.) Materials prepared for litigation are inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rule of
Evidence 803(6), and FRE 803(8)(A)(ii) excludes a police officer’s recorded statement if made in a
criminal case by a police officer. Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Xanthas, Inc., 855 F.2d 233 (5th Cir.
1988); See United States v. Cain, 615 F.2d 380, 382 (5th Cir. 1980). Defendant’s Exhibits B2, B3,
B4, C4, C5, C6, C7, and C8 are inadmissible statements made by a police officer for a criminal case.
Plaintiff hereby objects to those exhibits. She addresses those exhibits in this Response only to
demonstrate that Defendant’s Motion is not a true FRCP 12(b)(6) motion and to show that the
exhibits are not trustworthy. FRE 803(8)(B).
Note that one of the exhibits – Defendant’s Exhibit B3 was created after this lawsuit was
filed, and the change noted in that report goes to the heart of this controversy: Did Plaintiff Castro
comply with Defendant Salinas such that 1) Defendant Salinas’s actions can only be explained by his
intentional violation of Castro’s First Amendment protected right to film the police, and 2)
Defendant Salinas changed his story to criminalize Plaintiff Castro in anticipation of a civil rights
lawsuit? Compare (Dkt. #5, Ex. B2) with (Dkt. #5, Ex. B3.) These exhibits are not only
inadmissible for the reasons cited above, but also because the exhibits indicate a lack of
trustworthiness. FRE 803(6)(E) and 803(8)(B).
Plaintiff also objects to Defendant’s Exhibit D, as it is essentially a legal conclusion on the
part of the Olmos Park City Secretary of what local city code section might apply to this case. FRE
702.

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 9 of 15

III. Plaintiff Joanna Castro had a Clearly Established Constitutional Right to Film Salinas
and to be Free from an Arrest Not Based on Probable Cause.

Defendant asserts the defense of qualified immunity. (Dkt. #5 at 5.) He appears to apply that
defense to the Fourth Amendment component of this lawsuit, and the First Amendment component
only insofar as the retaliation claim. See (Dkt. #5 at 5-12.) Plaintiff Castro alleges that Defendant
Salinas violated her Fourth Amendment protected rights to 1) be free from a probable causeless
arrest when he falsely reported that she had interfered with his duties, and 2) be free from excessive
force when he slapped, shoved, and threatened Castro with a rifle when she was simply compliant
and subdued. (Dkt. #4 at 7-8.) Defendant does not appear to attack Plaintiff’s claim against Salinas
for the violation of her First Amendment protected right to film him when he ordered her to put her
camera down and slapped her camera out of her hand. See (Dkt. #5 at 5, et seq.)
Arrest Without Probable Cause:
Regarding the probable causeless arrest, it is undisputed that Castro was arrested for the
offense of interference. (Dkt. #5 at 10.) Our jurisprudence clearly established that an arrest must be
based on probable cause long before February 20, 2018. Turner v. Lieutenant Driver, 848 F.3d 678,
694 (5th Cir. 2017). “Probable cause exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances within a
police officer’s knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude
that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.” Id. (citation omitted). Turner
involved an activist filming the police in a public place, and the Fifth Circuit concluded that the
police did not have probable cause to arrest him for an offense under those circumstances. Id. Here,
9

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 10 of 15

similarly, no objectively reasonable officer would believe he had probable cause to arrest Plaintiff
Castro based on the presumably true facts stated in her complaint, including:
1. Castro was holding cameras, and Defendant Salinas knew they were cameras,
evidenced by his oral order for her to put her camera down,
2. Defendant Salinas did not at any point on February 20th indicate that he was confused
about what Castro was holding in her hands, but evidenced his knowledge that she was
holding a camera by ordering her to put the camera down,
3. Defendant Salinas did not arrest Castro on February 20th for interference, nor did he
make any move to arrest her until long after February 20th,
4. The other officer on the scene explicitly told Salinas to not worry about Plaintiff
Castro’s camera/filming, and Salinas immediately left Castro after the other officer told
him not to worry about her,
5. Defendant Salinas turned his back on Plaintiff Castro after slapping her cameras,
evidencing that he did not view her as a threat (nor did the other officer view her as a
threat by ignoring her and telling Salinas not to worry about her), and
6. Defendant Salinas attempted to improperly place Plaintiff in fear of being illegally
framed for another charge when he was present for her arrest about a month after their
first encounter, implying that he would falsely charge her with drug possession.
The additional facts that Defendant argues in his Motion are not found in Plaintiff’s complaint, and
should not be considered, including who made the determination to charge Castro with interfering in
violation of Texas Penal Code §38.15(b).
10

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 11 of 15

The facts in the case at bar are the same as in Turner, as well as other First Amendment
filming cases like Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir. 2011) (Glik was standing roughly 10
feet away from officers making arrest, as Glik filmed the officers). No objectively reasonable officer
under the circumstances described in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint would believe that
Plaintiff Castro interfered with Defendant Salinas, or that an objectively reasonable officer would
otherwise find probable cause for an arrest.
The fact that an arrest warrant was secured after-the-fact needs to be investigated through
discovery. Now that Plaintiff has Defendant Salinas’s affidavit for the arrest warrant, she hereby
asserts that the warrant was secured by providing the magistrate false information, and without the
false statements, there was no probable cause supporting that arrest warrant. Franks v. Delaware, 438
U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). The following facts cited in Defendant’s Exhibit
C6 were false, without which there is no probable cause:
1. Paragraph 1 “with something in her hand.” (Dkt. #5, Ex. C6 at 11.) Salinas affirmatively
knew that she held a camera, as he orally ordered her to put the camera down. (Dkt. #4 at 3.)
2. Paragraph 1 omits the fact that Castro complied with Salinas’s order to get back. (Dkt. #4 at
3, 5.)
3. Paragraph 2 indicates that Castro refused to comply with lawful commands, which is false.
Compare (Dkt. #5, Ex. C6 at 11) with (Dkt. #4 at 3, 5.)
4. Paragraph 2 indicates that Salinas “guided” Castro when he actually slapped her and shoved
her.
5. Paragraph 2 of Defendant’s Exhibit C6 also indicates that Castro got very close to Salinas’s
11

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 12 of 15

gun, but omits the fact that Salinas charged at Castro as she backed away from him. In other
words, Salinas’s own actions caused his gun to be close to Castro, not the other way around.
6. Paragraph 3 of Defendant’s Exhibit C6 states that Castro shoved something into Salinas’s
face, when in reality Salinas knew exactly what Castro had in her hands, and she never
shoved anything in Salinas’s face.
7. Paragraph 3 indicates that Castro could have been holding a weapon, but Defendant Salinas
knew she held a camera and ordered her to put her camera down.
8. Finally, Paragraph 4 of Defendant’s Exhibit C6 indicates that the other officer yelled for
Officer Salinas’s assistance. No, he did not. The other officer told Salinas to not worry
about Castro.
From soup-to-nuts, the affidavit provided to the magistrate was riddled with completely false
statements. Without these false statements, the affidavit would essentially state that Joanna Castro
was present near an arrest, which would fall far short of establishing probable cause for an arrest
warrant for her. These false statements tainted the magistrate. Buehler v. City of Austin, 824 F.3d
548, 554-55 (5th Cir. 2016).
Excessive Force & the First Amendment:
Second, regarding the right to be free from excessive force, that right was clearly established
long before February 20, 2018. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395-96 (1989). Courts
consider whether an officer’s actions are “objectively reasonable in light of the facts and
circumstances confronting” the officer. Id. at 395. Would an officer, possessing the same
information as Defendant Salinas, who knows the law, believe that Defendant Salinas’s conduct was
12

Case 5:18-cv-00312-DAE Document 7 Filed 07/15/18 Page 13 of 15

lawful? See Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).
Defendant Salinas knew that Plaintiff Castro was holding a camera – as evidenced by his
order for her to put the camera down. (Dkt. #4 at 5.) He slapped at her and rammed her for his
expressed purpose of knocking the camera out of her hand. Id. No objectively reasonable police
officer would believe that ordering a person to put down their camera was lawful, knowing the Fifth
Circuit holding in Turner. No objectively reasonable police officer would believe that knocking a
camera out of a filmer’s hand was lawful in the Fifth Circuit after Turner was decided. Castro’s
Fourth and First Amendment claims are intertwined in that the same action that constituted excessive
force on a compliant/subdued female by slapping and shoving her to stop her from filming
simultaneously violated her First Amendment right to film.
Plaintiff objects to the insertion of extraneous facts into this 12(b)(6) motion in Dkt. #5 at 1013. Plaintiff asks for time to conduct discovery before the Court considers a Motion for Summary
Judgment. Plaintiff also objects to Defendant’s arguments in pages 13-15 of his 12(b)(6) motion, as
discovery is required to flesh out the retaliation. Without discovery, Plaintiff can point to the
suspicious timing of Defendant’s choice to change his story from Castro complied to Castro refused
to comply after this lawsuit was filed. The conflicts between the facts in Plaintiff’s live pleading and
the facts the defendant argues in his Motion to Dismiss demonstrate that this will be a fact-intensive
case, requiring time for adequate discovery. See Evans v. Technologies Applications & Serv., 80
F.3d 954, 961 (4th Cir. 1996). A motion made under FRCP 12(b)(6) cannot be used to resolve
factual issues or the merits of the case. See Republican Party v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir.
1992).

IV. Declaratory Judgment
This case involves alleged violations of fundamental Constitutional rights. No discovery has
been conducted. Plaintiff asks that the Court decide this issue in a future Motion for Summary
Judgment after discovery has been conducted. Id.
