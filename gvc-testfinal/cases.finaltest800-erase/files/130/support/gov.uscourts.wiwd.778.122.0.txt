HYPERPHRASE’S MOTION FOR A NEW SCHEDULE
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON GOOGLE’S LICENSE DEFENSE
The summary judgment motions filed by Google on the last day set by the Court for
filing such motions included a request for a summary determination that Google is
protected by a license granted by HyperPhrase to Microsoft – an affirmative defense that
Google sought to add to this lawsuit less than a week before the deadline for filing
summary judgment motions. At the time Google’s summary judgment motions were filed,
Google’s license defense was not part of this lawsuit.
Given the new trial schedule, on March 25, 2008, Judge Crabb granted Google’s
motion to add its license defense (3/25/08 Order, Docket No. 118). Specifically, the Court
noted that HyperPhrase had presented an argument that additional discovery would be
needed to respond to the license defense and found that “Plaintiffs’ [HyperPhrase’s]
argument would be compelling were it not for the fact that the trial date has been continued
until March 16, 2009,” well after Google’s summary judgment motions had been filed. The
Court’s March 25, 2008 Order further held that HyperPhrase “may apply to the [M]agistrate
[J]udge for either a delay in the present deadlines or for a new deadline for a summary
judgment motion, limited to the license issue.”

As permitted by the Court’s March 25, 2008 Order, HyperPhrase respectfully seeks
a new schedule for briefing the motion for summary judgment on the license defense to
dates after the other summary judgment motions filed by Google (for invalidity, noninfringement and no willfulness) have been decided. If the Court’s decision on those
motions does not terminate the case, then discovery can proceed on all issues and briefing
completed on the license summary judgment as follows:
•

HyperPhrase discovery concerning Google’s license defense: a period
of four weeks after the Court’s summary judgment decisions on invalidity and
non-infringement.

•

HyperPhrase’s response to Google’s motion for summary judgment
concerning the license defense: three weeks after the conclusion of
discovery on the license issue.

•

Google’s reply brief: to be filed three weeks after HyperPhrase’s response
brief is filed.

The license issue will then be fully briefed ten weeks after decisions on the other summary
judgment motions and well in advance of the March 26, 2009 trial date. This will avoid
unfair prejudice to HyperPhrase by providing the opportunity to take discovery concerning
the license defense – which the Court recognized as appropriate in its March 25, 2008
Order. This approach also is consistent with the agreement reached at the March 20, 2008
status conference to await the Court’s decision on summary judgment before beginning
full-scale discovery on the merits.
