IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
HYPERPHRASE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC and
HYPERPHRASE INC.,
Plaintiffs,
v.

Civil Action No. 06-cv-199-bbc

GOOGLE INC.,
Defendant.

GOOGLE’S RESPONSE TO HYPERPHRASE’S MOTION FOR A NEW SCHEDULE
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON GOOGLE’S LICENSE DEFENSE
Before HyperPhrase filed the present motion, Google indicated to HyperPhrase that it
would discuss and, if reasonable, accommodate the further discovery HyperPhrase purportedly
needs before filing its opposition to Google’s motion for summary judgment regarding the
license defense. Google was therefore surprised when HyperPhrase filed this motion rather than
responding to Google’s proposal.
Google’s license defense is simple: the Microsoft software upon which HyperPhrase
premises almost all of its infringement theory, and the use thereof, is fully licensed by
HyperPhrase. See, e.g., Memorandum ISO of Google's Motion for Summary Judgment of
Noninfringement (Dkt. No. 103) at 29-32. A favorable ruling for Google on this issue would
eliminate over 95% of HyperPhrase’s alleged damages. Interpreting the license is a question of
law, and so Google does not understand what further discovery HyperPhrase needs to respond to
the motion. Nevertheless, as HyperPhrase’s motion notes, there is no need for the Court to reach
the license issue if it finds the two remaining patents either invalid or not infringed. See
HyperPhrase Motion (Dkt. No. 122) at 2 (“If the Court’s decision on those motions does not
terminate the case …”). Therefore, Google agrees that further discovery (to the extent

reasonable and necessary) and briefing on the license issue can be deferred until after the Court
decides Google’s other summary judgment motions.
Accordingly, Google ASSENTS to the delay in the briefing schedule requested in
HyperPhrase’s motion. Google OBJECTS to HyperPhrase’s request for unspecified additional
discovery pertaining to the license motion, but will revisit this objection pending HyperPhrase
making specific discovery demands.
Respectfully submitted,
