PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO THE
MOTION OF JAMES SCHNELLER AND PHILADELPHIA METRO TASK
FORCE TO INTERVENE

I.

INTRODUCTION
James Schneller seeks leave to intervene in this action, on behalf of himself

and as a representative of his unincorporated association, Philadelphia Metro Task
Force,1 in order to defend the constitutionality of Pennsylvania’s Marriage Law.
1

It is doubtful that Philadelphia Metro Task Force (“PMTF”) has the capacity to
participate in this case, either on its own behalf or as a representative of its
members, because it does not appear from the Motion to Intervene that either
PMTF or any of its members can demonstrate the existence of any legally
protectable interest in the case. More fundamentally, however, PMTF cannot
appear in this Court pro se. Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's
Advisory Council, 506 U.S. 194, 202-203 (1993) (corporations and all other

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 2 of 13

Mr. Schneller wishes to submit evidence and argument in opposition to Plaintiffs’
allegations in a manner he believes will “balance the record and argument in this
case,” and to be in a position to appeal any adverse determination. He does not
seek any relief apart from the preservation of Pennsylvania’s ban on marriage by
gay and lesbian couples.
Mr. Schneller seeks intervention as of right pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)
or, in the alternative, permissive intervention pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).
This Court should deny both requests because Mr. Schneller has not identified a
sufficient legal interest in the litigation and cannot demonstrate that his interests
are distinct from or not fully represented by the Commonwealth Defendants.
Finally, permitting Mr. Schneller to intervene will cause unnecessary delay and
increase the cost and expense of this litigation.

artificial entities may appear in the federal courts only through licensed counsel).
Mr. Schneller does not claim to be a licensed attorney, so he cannot serve as the
attorney for PMTF. As PMTF does not claim to have any interests different or
distinct from those of Mr. Schneller, Plaintiffs will not analyze PMTF’s
entitlement to intervene separately, but will note that PMTF’s motion to intervene
should fail for the same reasons as Mr. Schneller’s individual motion.

II.

ARGUMENT
A.

Mr. Schneller May Not Intervene “As of Right” Because He
Cannot Meet the Standard Under Rule 24(a).

Mr. Schneller’s motion to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a) should be
denied because he has not shown that he has a legally protected interest in the
litigation that will be affected or impaired by the outcome and because he has not
shown that any interest he has will not be adequately represented by the
Commonwealth Defendants.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) provides, in pertinent part:
(a) Intervention as of Right. On timely motion, the
court must permit anyone to intervene who:
…
(2) claims an interest relating to the property or
transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so
situated that disposing of the action may as a practical
matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect
its interest unless existing parties adequately represent
that interest.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) (emphasis added).
An intervenor’s interest must be one that is “significantly protectable.”
Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 531 (1971). A person seeking leave to
intervene must demonstrate that: (1) the application for intervention is timely; (2)
the applicant has a sufficient interest in the litigation; (3) the interest may be
affected or impaired, as a practical matter, by the disposition of the action; and (4)
the interest is not adequately represented by an existing party in the litigation.

Kleissler v. U.S. Forest Serv., 157 F.3d 964, 969 (3d Cir. 1998); Brody v. Spang,
957 F.2d 1108, 1115 (3d Cir. 1992); Harris v. Pernsley, 820 F.2d 592, 596 (3d Cir.
1987). The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that he has met all four
prongs of this conjunctive test. United States v. Alcan Aluminum, Inc., 25 F.3d
1174, 1181 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1994). If a person fails on any one prong of this test, he
is not entitled to intervene as of right. Sch. Dist. of. Phila. v. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd.,
160 F.R.D. 66, 68 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (citing Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Hodel, 661 F.
Supp. 473, 474 (E.D. Ky. 1987)). With the exception of timeliness, Mr.
Schneller’s motion to intervene fails with regard to each of these elements.
1. Mr. Schneller has not set forth a significant, legally protectable
interest that will be affected or impaired by this litigation.
Mr. Schneller’s asserted interests are, for the most part, not legally
protectable. Those that are protectable are too remote to be affected or impaired,
as a practical matter, by this litigation. An applicant for intervention must have a
“significantly protectable” interest that is related to the subject of the action.
Kleissler, 157 F.3d at 969 (citing Donaldson, 400 U.S. at 531). Mr. Schneller’s
asserted interest is in preventing the recognition of same-sex marriage because it
offends him morally and because he sees a threat in the accomplishments and
tactics of those he labels “homosexual activists.” But this is not the sort of
“significantly protectable interest” that allows for intervention, as Mr. Schneller
does not have a right to see others discriminated against. See, e.g., Harris, 820
4

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 5 of 13

F.2d at 601 (district attorney who sought to intervene to prevent the enforcement of
a jail population cap imposed as a remedy for overcrowding “can have no interest
in assuring the incarceration of persons under unconstitutional conditions”).
Mr. Schneller’s assertions that lifting Pennsylvania’s ban on marriage for
lesbian and gay couples could lead to discrimination against him or an impairment
of his ability to exercise his religious beliefs, also are not sufficient to warrant
intervention. The polestar of determining whether an identified interest in
litigation is “significantly protectable,” and therefore grounds for intervention, is
whether the interest is “direct” or “remote.” Kleissler, 157 F.3d at 972. A “direct”
interest is one that is “specific to [the intervenor], is capable of definition, and will
be directly affected in a substantially concrete fashion by the relief sought.” Id.
“The interest may not be remote or attenuated.” Id. The applicant for intervention
“must demonstrate that there is a tangible threat to a legally cognizable interest to
have the right to intervene.” Harris, 820 F.2d at 601 (internal citation omitted).
Mr. Schneller’s asserted interest in avoiding discrimination and suppression
of his religious views is too remote to meet this test. Mr. Schneller does not
explain how allowing the Plaintiffs to marry (or recognizing their out of state
marriages) would result in discrimination against him and suppression of his
religious exercise, and the connection is by no means obvious. Allowing such
marriages would impose no obligation upon Mr. Schneller. He has not made any
5

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 6 of 13

showing that he will be “directly affected in a substantially concrete fashion by the
relief sought.” See Kleissler, 157 F.3d at 972. His interest in this suit is, therefore,
too remote to qualify as “significantly protectable.” 2
Nor is this a case in which the specifics of the remedy sought could alter Mr.
Schneller’s legal rights and responsibilities. Cf. Benjamin ex rel. Yock v. DPW,
701 F.3d 938 (3d Cir. 2012). The only relief sought in this case is elimination of
Pennsylvania’s refusal to recognize marriages of gay and lesbian couples, which,
as discussed, will have no concrete effect on Mr. Schneller, even if it offends him
morally.
As Mr. Schneller has failed to satisfy the second and third prongs of the test
for intervention as of right, his motion under Rule 24(a) should be denied on this
basis alone.

2

Alternatively, Mr. Schneller asserts that he has standing to intervene because, as a
taxpayer, he will have to pay for costs associated with administrative changes
required by state recognition of same-sex marriages if Plaintiffs prevail. Br. in
Supp. Mot. to Intervene at 16. This argument is meritless, as it amounts to a
challenge to “an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an
essentially regulatory statute” which is insufficient to convey taxpayer standing.
See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102 (1968).

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 7 of 13

2. Any Interest Mr. Schneller Has in the Non-Recognition of
Same-Sex Marriages is Adequately Represented by the
Commonwealth Defendants.
Mr. Schneller’s intervention argument also fails because he has not shown
that the Commonwealth Defendants will not adequately represent his interests in
this litigation. See Hoots v. Pennsylvania, 672 F.2d 1133, 1135 (3d Cir. 1982).
The Commonwealth Defendants are government officials who are responsible for
the enforcement of Pennsylvania’s laws and policies prohibiting marriage and the
recognition of marriage of same-sex couples, including 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§ 1102
and 1704. Where official policies and practices are challenged, there is a
presumption that the involved governmental department and its officers will
adequately defend those policies and practices. See Comm. v. Rizzo, 530 F.2d 501,
505 (3d Cir. 1976) (observing that “it seems unlikely that anyone [other than the
governmental department and its officers] could be better situated” to defend
governmental policies and practices); see also Del. Valley Citizens’ Council for
Clean Air v. Comm. of Pennsylvania, 674 F.2d 970, 973 (3d Cir. 1982) (“When a
state is a party to a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest, it is presumed to
represent the interests of its citizens.”); Daggett v. Comm’n on Governmental
Ethics and Election Practices, 172 F.3d 104, 111 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (presumption
of adequacy of government representation can apply in cases where the
government is a defendant, defending a statute from attack).
7

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 8 of 13

An interest is not “adequately represented” when:
(1)

Although applicants’ interests are similar to those
of a party, they are sufficiently diverse that there is
a risk that the existing party cannot or will not
devote proper attention to the applicant’s interest;

(2)

There is collusion between the representative party
and the opposing party;

(3)

The representative party has not been diligent in
prosecuting the litigation…

Hoots, 672 F.2d at 1135 (citations omitted). Mr. Schneller has not identified any
lack of diligence or divergence of interests by the Commonwealth Defendants,
who have vigorously defended this case to date, with every indication that they
intend to continue to do so. Mr. Schneller has not made any tenable arguments that
Defendants are acting in gross negligence or bad faith.3 Similarly, he has not made
any assertions of collusion between Defendants and Plaintiffs, apart from his vague
(and legally irrelevant) concerns that defense counsel may have more sympathy for
the idea of equal rights for lesbian and gay people than Mr. Schneller does. These
vague concerns are not sufficient to overcome the presumption that Defendants, as

3

Mr. Schneller argues that he would develop the facts better and more vigorously
than Defendants. Br. in Supp. Mot. to Intervene at 5-6. Even if this were true, it
would not make him a proper intervenor. See, e.g., United States v. Philadelphia,
798 F.2d 81, 90 (3d Cir. 1986) (difference of opinion as to litigation strategy, such
as whether to stipulate to certain facts or how vigorously to challenge evidence, is
not sufficient to show inadequate representation); Comm. v. Rizzo, 530 F.2d at 505
(same).
8

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 9 of 13

government officials charged with enforcement of the laws in question, will
provide adequate representation.
B.

Mr. Schneller Should Not Be Granted Permissive Intervention
Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b) Because He Does Not Have a Claim or
Defense Which Shares a Common Question of Law or Fact With
the Main Action and Because His Participation Would Add
Nothing Except Complication, Delay, and Additional Cost.

Mr. Schneller also does not meet the requirements for permissive
intervention because he does not have a claim or defense to assert and because
permitting him to intervene will unduly delay and prejudice the current parties’
rights. Permissive intervention is granted solely in the Court’s discretion and is
governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b), which provides:
On timely motion, the court may permit anyone to
intervene who:… has a claim or defense that shares with
the main action a common question of law or fact…”
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1) (emphasis added).
Mr. Schneller has not articulated any claim or defense that “shares with the
main action a common question of law or fact.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).
The concerns expressed in his brief, however strongly held, do not constitute legal
claims.4 Moreover, it is clear from Mr. Schneller’s filings that there is no position,

4

Mr. Schneller has also failed to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c)’s requirement
of submitting, with his motion to intervene, “a pleading that sets out the claim or
defense for which intervention is sought.”
9

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 10 of 13

apart from the alleged improper influence of “homosexual activists” upon the
courts, that Mr. Schneller would advance but that the Defendants would not.
Rule 24(b) requires a court to consider, when exercising its discretion,
“whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the
original parties’ rights.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). A court should consider various
factors, including whether the proposed intervenors will add anything to the
litigation and whether the proposed intervenors’ interests are already adequately
represented in the litigation. Hoots, 672 F.2d at 1136.
In this case, there is nothing to be gained by the intervention except
additional complexity and delay. Mr. Schneller has noted his objection to the trial
schedule set by the court – which was set after being argued by counsel both in
writing and orally – indicating that he may seek to postpone the trial date. Mot. for
Leave to Intervene ¶ 17 (“The alacrity of the proceedings in this case is
unexplained and conceivably excessive.”). Adding another party for the reasons
stated in Mr. Schneller’s motion would not add value but only unnecessary
complications to the case. The Court should deny Mr. Schneller’s motion for
permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).
C.

Mr. Schneller Can Participate As Amicus Curiae.

Granting Mr. Schneller leave to participate as amicus curiae is sufficient in
this case. Despite his arguments that he will not be able to participate as fully if
10

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 93 Filed 01/08/14 Page 11 of 13

granted only amicus curiae status rather than intervenor status, this would be an
appropriate alternative course of action given Mr. Schneller’s failure to fulfill Rule
24’s requirements. See Liberty Resources, Inc. v. Philadelphia Housing Authority,
395 F. Supp. 2d 206, 209 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (a court may allow participation as an
amicus curiae if standard for intervention is not met).

III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the motion of Mr.

Schneller and Philadelphia Metro Task Force to Intervene as Defendants in this
case.
Respectfully submitted,
