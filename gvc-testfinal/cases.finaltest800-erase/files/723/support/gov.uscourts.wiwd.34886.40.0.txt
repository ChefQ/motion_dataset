OWENS-ILLINOIS, INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS
WITH ITS SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Owens-Illinois, Inc. (“Owens-Illinois”) submits this motion to dismiss with its
supporting memorandum of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff alleges that her deceased husband, Valmore Prust, was exposed to
asbestos and contracted lung cancer more than four years ago. Pl.’s First Am. Compl. ¶
17, ECF No. 32. For three reasons, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint fails as a matter
of law and should be dismissed with prejudice: (1) Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the
doctrine of claim preclusion; (2) Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of
limitations; and (3) Plaintiff’s allegations fail to state any claim upon which relief can be
granted against Owens-Illinois as a patent licensor.
LEGAL STANDARD
“A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state
a claim upon which relief may be granted.” Hallinan v. Fraternal Order of Police of Chi.

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 2 of 15

Lodge No. 7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2009). Under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must
include “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The short and plain statement under Rule 8(a)(2) must
“give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it
rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355
U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). Under the federal notice pleading standards, a “complaint must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550
U.S. at 570). “In evaluating the sufficiency of the complaint, [courts] view it in the light
most favorable to the plaintiff, taking as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and
making all possible inferences from the allegations in the plaintiff’s favor.” AnchorBank,
FSB v. Hofer, 649 F.3d 610, 614 (7th Cir. 2011).
A motion to dismiss should be granted when the complaint does not plead a
cause of action recognized by the law of the jurisdiction. See Intercon Research Assocs.,
Ltd. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 696 F.2d 53, 55 (7th Cir. 1982) (affirming district court’s
dismissal of claim). Although ordinarily plaintiffs are given leave to amend, a district
court may dismiss a complaint with prejudice when it is clear that the plaintiff cannot
cure the defect. Bogie v. Rosenberg, 705 F.3d 603, 608 (7th Cir. 2013).

ARGUMENT
I.

Plaintiff’s Claims Are Barred by the Doctrine of Claim Preclusion.
A.

Plaintiff’s Claims Have Been Dismissed on the Merits as to
Owens-Illinois.

Plaintiff’s claims against Owens-Illinois have been dismissed on the merits for
failure to comply with a court order. Order at 1, Feb. 26, 2014, attached as Ex. A; Order
at 1-4, Feb. 11, 2014, attached as Ex. B. Under Wisconsin law, claim preclusion bars a
future claim when there was a final judgment on the merits involving a claim that was
or could have been litigated between the same parties or their privies. Menard, Inc. v.
Liteway Lighting Prods., 282 Wis. 2d 582, 596, 698 N.W.2d 738, 745 (2005). The order
dismissing Plaintiff’s prior action satisfies these elements and prevents Plaintiff from
relitigating her claims.
Last year, Plaintiff sued Owens-Illinois in the Eastern District of Wisconsin based
on the same alleged asbestos exposure and injury. Order at 1, Feb. 11, 2014. OwensIllinois moved to dismiss the complaint because Plaintiff’s claims were barred by the
statute of limitations. Id. After transfer to MDL 875, the court granted Owens-Illinois’s
motion and dismissed Plaintiff’s complaint without prejudice and with leave to refile.
Id. at 4. Specifically, the court held that Plaintiff must allege a particular date to avoid
dismissal:
By omitting from the complaint the date, or approximate date if no
specific date is ascertainable, at which Decedent knew or should have
known that his lung cancer was caused by asbestos, Plaintiff has failed to
set out sufficient factual matter to support her claims. Defendant is
entitled to notice of this date, or approximate date, in order to adequately
defend against Plaintiff’s allegations. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s complaint
must be dismissed. However, the liberal approach to pleading embodied
-3-

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 4 of 15

by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 provides that “an inadvertent error
in pleading will not preclude a party from securing relief on the merits of
a claim.” Therefore, the Court will permit Plaintiff leave to refile her
complaint in light of this Court’s decision.
Id. at 4 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).
Plaintiff never filed an amended complaint as she was ordered. Order at 1, Feb.
26, 2014. Nor did Plaintiff seek leave to clarify or modify this order. Accordingly, the
MDL 875 court entered an order under Rule 41(b), dismissing her complaint and
marking her case as closed. Id. That dismissal “was entirely appropriate” under Third
Circuit standards. Azubuko v. Bell Nat’l Org., 243 F. App’x 728, 729 (3d Cir. 2007) (failure
to file amended complaint prejudices defendants and compels dismissal); Jones v. New
Jersey Bar Ass’n, 242 Fed. App’x 793, 794 (3d Cir. 2007) (same); Pruden v. SCI Camp Hill,
252 F. App’x 436, 438 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing In re Westinghouse Sec. Litig., 90 F.3d 696, 704
(3d Cir. 1996)) (same).
Additionally, the dismissal was on the merits — with prejudice — because the
order did not state otherwise. Order at 1, Feb. 26, 2014; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b)
(“Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this
subdivision . . . operates as an adjudication upon the merits.”). In fact, as the Seventh
Circuit has explained under similar circumstances, “[i]gnoring deadlines and orders
marks the abandonment of a suit, as surely as does filing a notice of dismissal,” and
such neglect “does not justify putting the adversary to the continued expense and
uncertainty of litigation.” United States v. Golden Elevator, Inc., 27 F.3d 301, 303 (7th Cir.
1994) (affirming dismissal with prejudice for failure to file amended complaint).

-4-

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 5 of 15

Because Wisconsin claim preclusion bars a lawsuit when there was a final
judgment on the merits involving a claim that was or could have been litigated between
the same parties or their privies, see Menard, 282 Wis. 2d at 596, 698 N.W.2d at 745, and
the order dismissing Plaintiff’s prior action against Owens-Illinois satisfies these
elements, see Order at 1, Feb. 11, 2014, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint fails as a
matter of Wisconsin law.
B.

Plaintiff’s Serial Litigation Violates Wisconsin Law.

Moreover, as a policy matter, Wisconsin law prohibits multiple actions for the
same cause. Barricade Flasher Serv., Inc. v. Wind Lake Auto Parts, Inc., 338 Wis. 2d 144, 807
N.W.2d 697 (Wis. App. Ct. 2011), review denied, 340 Wis. 2d 544, 811 N.W.2d 819 (Wis.
2012). Barricade holds that a dismissal on the merits is appropriate under Wisconsin law
when a party files a duplicate case based on the same claim. Id. Here, just as in Barricade,
Plaintiff filed a new action in this Court after her complaint was dismissed by an
adverse ruling by the MDL 875 court. Id.
“A party may not circumvent a ruling it does not like in one case by filing a new
action.’” Id. at 148, 807 N.W.2d at 699 (ellipses omitted) (quoting Aon Risk Servs., Inc. v.
Liebenstein, 289 Wis. 2d 127, 710 N.W.2d 175 (Wis. Ct. App. 2005)). It “would lead to
unnecessarily multiplicitous litigation and would frustrate circuit courts’ ability to
control their own dockets. It could also produce inconsistent results in a case.” Payday
Loan Store of Wis. Inc. v. Krueger, 346 Wis. 2d 237, 245, 828 N.W.2d 587, 591 (Wis. Ct.
App. 2013). For all of these reasons, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint should be

-5-

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 6 of 15

dismissed with prejudice because her claims are barred by the doctrine of claim
preclusion.
II.

Plaintiff’s Claims Are Barred by the Statute of Limitations.
As the MDL 875 court held, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint also fails

because her claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiff alleges claims
under both the Wisconsin survival statute, Wis. Stat. § 895.01, and the Wisconsin
wrongful death statute, Wis. Stat. §§ 895.03 and 895.04. Pl.’s First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 22-26.
Because the statute of limitations expired here on January 5, 2013, and Mr. Prust had no
viable claim at the time of his death, 1 Plaintiff’s claims fail as a matter of law.
A.

Plaintiff’s Survival Claims Are Time-Barred.

Wisconsin survival claims are filed by the personal representative of the estate to
recover for pre-death pain and suffering. Bartholomew v. Wisconsin Patients Comp. Fund
& Compcare Health Servs. Ins. Corp., 293 Wis. 2d 38, 61-67, 717 N.W.2d 216, 228-29 (Wis.
2006). Those personal injury claims survive death only by statute. Wis. Stat. § 895.01.
But a personal injury lawsuit must be filed within three years. Wis. Stat. § 893.54; see
also Jaeger v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 610 F. Supp. 784, 787-88 (D. Wis. 1985).
The personal injury alleged here is Mr. Prust’s lung cancer. Pl.’s First Am.
Compl. ¶ 17. In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff admits that Mr. Prust’s lung
cancer was diagnosed on January 5, 2010 — more than four years before Plaintiff filed

Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint alleges two inconsistent dates of death.
Pl.’s First Am. Compl. ¶ 2 (May 17, 2013), ¶ 22 (August 18, 2013).
1

-6-

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 7 of 15

this lawsuit on February 21, 2014. Id. Therefore, the three-year statute of limitations
bars Plaintiff’s survival claims. Wis. Stat. § 893.54; Jaeger, 610 F. Supp. at 787-88.
B.

Plaintiff’s Wrongful Death Claims Are Time-Barred.

Wisconsin wrongful death claims are filed on behalf of a statutorily named
beneficiary for post-death loss of society and companionship. Bartholomew, 293 Wis. 2d
at 61-67, 717 N.W.2d at 228-29. Wrongful death claims are derivative of the claims for
personal injury. Wis. Stat. § 895.03; Ruppa v. Am. States Ins. Co., 91 Wis. 2d 628, 646, 284
N.W.2d 318, 325 (Wis. 1979). So Wisconsin law “mandates that a wrongful death action
cannot be brought unless the decedent, at the time of his death, was entitled to maintain
an action and recover damages.” Miller v. Luther, 170 Wis. 2d 429, 437, 489 N.W.2d 651,
653 (Wis. Ct. App. 1992) (citations omitted); Lord v. Hubbell, Inc., 210 Wis. 2d 150, 166,
563 N.W.2d 913, 920 (Wis. Ct. App. 1997) (“A wrongful death claim is derivative of the
decedent’s claim for personal injury in that there is liability under the former only if and
to the extent that the injured person could have recovered had death not occurred.”).
Here, because the three-year statute of limitations on Mr. Prust’s personal injury
claims expired on January 5, 2013, Mr. Prust had no viable cause of action when he
died. Pl.’s First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 17, 22. And Plaintiff does not state plausible
allegations as to the discovery rule for Mr. Prust. Id. at ¶ 18; cf. Order at 4, Feb. 11, 2014
(requiring “the date, or approximate date if no specific date is ascertainable, at which
Decedent knew or should have known that his lung cancer was caused by asbestos”
(emphasis added)). Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to state a wrongful death claim

-7-

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 8 of 15

based on Mr. Prust’s time-barred claim for personal injury. Wis. Stat. § 895.03; Miller,
170 Wis. 2d at 437, 489 N.W.2d at 653.
C.

Allowing Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint Would Violate OwensIllinois’s Due Process Rights.

“In Wisconsin the expiration of the statute of limitations does more than merely
close the door of the courthouse. The expiration of the limitations period extinguishes
the cause of action of the potential plaintiff and it also creates a right enjoyed by the
would-be defendant to insist on that statutory bar.” Wojtas v. Capital Guardian Trust Co.,
477 F.3d 924, 927 (7th Cir. 2007) (marks and citation omitted). As the Seventh Circuit
and Wisconsin courts have held, the purpose of a statute of limitations is protecting
defendants against stale claims and ensuring a fair administration of justice. See id.; Doe
v. Archdiocese of Milwaukee, 211 Wis. 2d 312, 334 (Wis. 1997); Korkow v. Gen. Casualty Co.,
117 Wis. 2d 187, 198-99 (Wis. 1984) (citation omitted).
Here, Owens-Illinois has “acquired a right to a right to assert the statute of
limitations bar by operation of Wisconsin law” and “would suffer plain legal prejudice”
if the Court denies this motion to dismiss. Wojtas, 477 F.3d at 927-28. There is likely
missing evidence that would have allowed Owens-Illinois to test Plaintiff’s allegations.
Medical records may have been destroyed; pathology samples, if any ever existed, have
been disposed of; and physicians and other witnesses have passed away. Thus,
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint should be dismissed because the claims are barred
by the statute of limitations, and Owens-Illinois has a right to that dismissal with
prejudice.

III.

Plaintiff Has No Claim Against Owens-Illinois for Product Liability Based on
Its Licensing a Patent.
Plaintiff’s product liability claims, which are pled against Owens-Illinois only as

a patent licensor, fail because they have no basis in Wisconsin law. No Wisconsin case
has ever recognized a product liability action—based on either negligence or strict
liability—against a patent licensor.

In fact, Plaintiff’s allegations contravene Wisconsin

law and patent law.
A.

Plaintiff’s Allegations Contravene Patent Law.

Plaintiff’s allegations contradict both patent law and the patent at issue, U.S.
Patent No. 2,593,050 (filed Jan. 24, 1952), attached as Ex. C. 2 A patent “creates a limited
opportunity to obtain a property right in an idea.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft
Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 149 (1989). That “patent-right is incorporeal property, not
susceptible of actual delivery or possession.” Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 260
(1891). “A patent is not the grant of a right to make or use or sell.” Siemens Med.
Solutions USA, Inc. v. Saint-Gobain Ceramics & Plastics, Inc., 647 F.3d 1373, 1375 (Fed. Cir.
2011) (citations omitted). Instead, a patent grants a negative property right: “the right
to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention.” 35
U.S.C. § 154(a)(1). Plaintiff cannot maintain a product liability claim against OwensIllinois, based not on a product, but an idea.

The Court may consider documents that are “referred to in the Plaintiff’s
complaint and are central to his claim.” Adams v. City of Indianapolis, 742 F.3d 720, 729
(7th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted); Wagner v. Dept. of Health Servs., No. 12-cv-463-wmc,
2013 WL 3776327, at *6 n.2 (W.D. Wis. July 17, 2013) (citing Menominee Indian Tribe of
Wis. v. Thompson, 161 F.3d 449, 456 (7th Cir. 1998).
2

-9-

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 10 of 15

Furthermore, Plaintiff’s allegation is incorrect that Owens-Illinois “designed and
sold licenses for a patent to manufacture of fire doors incorporating asbestos-containing
cores.” Pls.’ First Am. Compl. ¶ 7. 3 It is a “bedrock principle” of patent law that “the
claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to
exclude.” Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005); accord Aro Mfg., Co.
v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 339 (1961) (“[T]he claims made in the
patent are the sole measure of the grant.”). The invention claimed here by OwensIllinois exists only in the claims and not the specification of the ’050 patent. See Smith v.
Snow, 294 U.S. 1, 11 (1935) (“[T]he claims of the patent, not its specifications, measure
the invention.”); Comark Commc’n, Inc. v. Harris Corp., 156 F.3d 1182, 1186 (Fed. Cir.
1998) (“[L]imitations from the specification are not to be read into the claims.”).
The ’050 patent does not require asbestos. See U.S. Patent No. 2,593,050 col. 4 l.
34 - col. 6 l. 30 (filed Jan. 24, 1952). None of the claims requires asbestos. Id. Instead,
the ’050 patent claims a “door or panel” comprising, in part, “a core of inorganic, rigid,
fire-proof, light weight material of a substantially uniform apparent density and
consistency throughout . . . .” Id. What core material any licensee, like Weyerhaeuser
Company, ultimately used in its fire doors did not depend on the ’050 patent or the
patent license with Owens-Illinois.

Even if Plaintiff’s allegation was accurate, which it is not, it would not matter.
There is no viable product liability cause of action for licensing intellectual property.

B.

Plaintiff Has No Strict Liability Claim Against Owens-Illinois Based on
Its Licensing a Patent.

Although Plaintiff asserts strict products liability against Owens-Illinois (see Pls.’
First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 38-45), no Wisconsin case has ever imposed strict liability on a
patent licensor. Strict liability extends only to “manufacturers, distributors and
sellers—those who place or maintain the product in the stream of commerce.” St. Clare
Hosp. of Monroe, Wis. v. Schmidt, Garden, Erickson, Inc., 148 Wis. 2d 750, 757, 437 N.W.2d
228, 231 (Wis. Ct. App. 1989). Wisconsin cases and federal cases applying Wisconsin
law have refused repeatedly to extend strict liability against companies that did not
place the product in the stream of commerce. See Tatera v. FMC Corp., 2009 WI App 80,
¶¶ 16-21, 319 Wis. 2d 688, 701-03, 768 N.W.2d 198, 204-05, rev’d on other grounds, 2010
WI 90, ¶¶18-19, 328 Wis. 2d 320, 786 N.W.2d 810 (refusing to apply strict liability to
provider of brake shoe linings it did not manufacture or sell that it had processed before
incorporating them into a finished product); Affiliated FM Ins. Co. v. Trane Co., 831 F.2d
153, 155 (7th Cir. 1987) (refusing to apply strict liability to a non-manufacturer product
designer); Geboy v. TRL Inc., 159 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (7th Cir. 1998) (refusing to apply
strict liability to occasional buyers and sellers or brokers of used industrial machine
products); Fish v. Amsted Indus., Inc., 126 Wis. 2d 293, 310, 376 N.W.2d 820, 828 (Wis.
1985) (refusing to apply strict liability to successor of manufacturer of defective
product).
To hold Owens-Illinois strictly liable as a patent licensor would require an
expansion of Wisconsin strict liability law — an expansion that the Seventh Circuit has

- 11 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 12 of 15

already held the Wisconsin Supreme Court would not permit. Affiliated FM Ins., 831
F.2d at 155. In Affiliated, the Seventh Circuit decided whether the Wisconsin Supreme
Court would impose strict liability on a designer of a heater, which was manufactured
by a different company. Id. at 154. The Seventh Circuit determined that, because no
Wisconsin case law permitted strict liability against non-manufacturer designers,
holding the defendant strictly liable would require an expansion of Wisconsin law. Id.
at 154-55.
Indeed, the Seventh Circuit explained the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s own
reluctance to extend strict liability:
We conclude that the legislature is in a better position to make broad
public policy decisions in actions based on products liability law. . . . The
questions concerning the effect on the manufacturing business, the
potential size and economic strength of successor corporations, the
availability of commercial insurance and the cost of such insurance are all
questions we cannot answer. These are the type of questions that the
legislature is in a better position to ascertain. If such a basic change in
corporation law is to be made it would seem reasonable for the change to
come about through legislation rather than court decision.
Id at 155 (quoting Fish, 126 Wis. 2d at 310, 376 N.W.2d at 828-29). Following this
reasoning, the Seventh Circuit refused to extend strict liability to a non-manufacturer
designer. Id.
Here, as a patent licensor, Owens-Illinois did not place or maintain any product
in the stream of commerce. See id. at 154-55; see also St. Clare Hosp., 148 Wis. 2d at 757,
437 N.W.2d at 231. Weyerhaeuser Company — not Owens-Illinois — manufactured,
distributed, and sold the asbestos-containing fire doors. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s First

- 12 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 13 of 15

Amended Complaint fails to state a strict liability claim against Owens-Illinois as a
patent licensor.
C.

Plaintiff Has No Negligence Claim Against Owens-Illinois Based on Its
Licensing a Patent.

To assert a product liability action based on negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1)
a duty of care on the part of the defendant, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) a causal
connection between the conduct and the injury, and (4) an actual loss or damage as a
result of the injury. Green v. Smith & Nephew AHP, Inc., 2001 WI 109, ¶ 55, 245 Wis. 2d
772, 810, 629 N.W.2d 727, 745. Duty is a threshold question of law for the court. Strasser
v. Transtech Mobile Fleet Serv., Inc., 2000 WI 87, ¶58, 236 Wis. 2d 435, 459, 613 N.W.2d
142, 154. Wisconsin law does not impose a duty on a company, which is in the chain of
distribution, but did not manufacture, assemble, inspect, or use the product. Geboy, 159
F.3d at 1000-01.
In Geboy, the Seventh Circuit affirmed judgment for five prior owners of a
vertical boring mill. Id. They never assembled, inspected, or used the mill. Id. Indeed,
two prior owners never had physical possession of mill. Id. at 1001. The Seventh Circuit
refused to impose a legal duty of care and create negligence liability, explaining that
“[t]o expose every business that comes into contact with a product to potential liability
‘would shock the conscience of society because it would have no sensible or just
stopping point.’” Id. at 1000.
Here, as in Geboy, Owens-Illinois did not manufacture, sell, assemble, inspect,
use, or even possess the products that allegedly caused Mr. Prust’s lung cancer. Instead,

- 13 -

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 40 Filed: 05/30/14 Page 14 of 15

Owens-Illinois licensed a patent to Weyerhaeuser Company. Owens-Illinois’s role as a
patent licensor is even more remote and tenuous than the defendants’ roles in Geboy.
Absent any legal duty running from Owens-Illinois to Mr. Prust based on its licensing a
patent, the entire structure of his negligence claim—breach of duty, causation,
damages—fails as a matter of law. Geboy, 159 F.3d at 1000-01.
For all of these reasons, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint fails to state any
claim upon which relief can be granted against Owens-Illinois as a patent licensor.
CONCLUSION
Owens-Illinois respectfully requests that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint with prejudice.
