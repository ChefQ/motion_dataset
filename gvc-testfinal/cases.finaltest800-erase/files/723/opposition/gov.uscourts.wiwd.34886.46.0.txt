FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

Case No. 14-cv-143

RESPONSE TO OWENS-ILLINOIS, INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff opposes Owens-Illinois, Inc.’s (“O-I”) motion to dismiss.

Procedural History
On September 17, 2013, plaintiff filed in this court an asbestos personal injury lawsuit
(“first complaint”) against O-I, among other defendants, for her husband’s lung cancer and
subsequent death. (See Ex 1.) On September 27, 2013, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferred the case to MDL No. 875 for pretrial proceedings. (See Ex 2.)
On November 15, 2013, O-I filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s first complaint pursuant
to FRCP 12(b)(6), arguing that plaintiff’s claim were barred by Wisconsin’s three-year statute of
limitations. (See Ex 3.) Plaintiff responded, arguing that although her husband was diagnosed in
January of 2010, neither she nor her husband discovered that her husband’s injuries were caused
by asbestos until much later. (See Ex 4.)
On February 10, 2014, Judge Robreno granted O-I’s motion in part, dismissing Plaintiff’s
complaint without prejudice, with leave to re-file by February 21, 2014. (Ex 5.) On February 21,
2014, Plaintiff re-filed her complaint (“second complaint”) in this court. (Ex 6.) On February 26,
2014, Judge Robreno ordered Plaintiff’s first complaint dismissed for failure to re-file in the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania. (Ex 7.)

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 2 of 15

On March 13, 2014, plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider Judge Robreno’s order. (Ex 8.)
On March 31, 2014, Judge Robreno denied that motion to reconsider because “Plaintiff is
effectively asking to proceed with her case in two separate jurisdictions. [...] [T]he Court did not
err in closing Plaintiff’s case in this court as a new complaint was not filed here, and Plaintiff has
elected to proceed in the Western District of Wisconsin.” (Ex 8 at 2.)

Legal Standard
The purpose of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of complaints, not to rule on
a complaint’s merits. Gibson v. City of Chicago, 910 F.2d 1510, 1520 (7th Cir. 1990).
In analyzing O-I’s motion to dismiss, the court must accept all well-pled allegations as
true, and view those allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff, drawing all reasonable
inferences in plaintiff’s favor. McMillan v. Collection Professionals, Inc., 455 F.3d 754, 758
(7th Cir. 2006). “While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need
detailed factual allegations, ... a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his
‘entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of
the elements of the cause of action will not do ... Factual allegations must raise a right to relief
above the speculative level.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955,
1964-65, 167 L.Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (Internal citations omitted). The pleadings comply with these
standards.
Argument
1. Plaintiff’s Claim is not Precluded
O-I’s first argument, that plaintiff’s claims are precluded, hinges on O-I’s claim that the
dismissal of plaintiff’s prior suit was with prejudice because the court did not state otherwise.
Contrary to O-I’s assertions, the court did state otherwise, holding that plaintiff’s claim was

2

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 3 of 15

“DISMISSED without prejudice, with leave to refile by February 21, 2014.” (Ex 5 at 4.) Plaintiff
refiled her claim in the Western District of Wisconsin, where the initial case had been originally
filed, in compliance with Judge Robreno’s order. Judge Robreno’s second order affirmed the prior

dismissal without prejudice, closing the MDL case. (See Ex 7.) Judge Robreno clarified this
intention when he stated, “[T]he Court did not err in closing Plaintiff’s case in this court as a new
complaint was not filed here, and Plaintiff has elected to proceed in the Western District of
Wisconsin.” (Ex 8 at 2.) Because plaintiff’s prior claim was dismissed without prejudice with
leave to refile, O-I’s motion to dismiss based on claim preclusion must fail.

2. Plaintiff’s Claim was Filed within the Statute of Limitations Period
Under Wis. Stat. § 893.54, a plaintiff has three years to initiate an action for personal
injury from the time the cause of action accrues. Wisconsin case law on the statute of limitations
consistently defines when a cause of action accrues as follows: “(A) cause of action does not
accrue until the nature of the injury and the cause -- or at least a relationship between the event
and injury -- is or ought to have been known to the claimant.” Borello v. U.S. Oil Co., 388
N.W.2d 140, 144 (Wis. 1986). The causal requirement means the injury must be specifically
linked to the defendant’s conduct. In other words, “[a] cause of action will not accrue under the
discovery rule until the plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have
discovered not only that he has been injured but also that his injury may have been caused by the
defendant’s conduct.” Arthur Raymond v. Eli Lilly and Co., 117 N.H. 164, 171, 371 A.2d 170
(1977), cited with approval in Borello, 130 Wis.2d at 409.
The Borello court explained, “[M]ost claims will accrue at the time of the negligent act or
injury simply because, in the typical tort, all the elements of an enforceable claim are apparent at
approximately that time . . .” but “not all tort claims will be held to accrue at that time; some will
3

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 4 of 15

not accrue until ‘discovery’ occurs.” Id. at n.2. See also Hansen v. A.H. Robins, Inc., 335
N.W.2d 578, 583 (1983) (“In the interest of justice and fundamental fairness, we adopt the
discovery rule for all tort actions . . . . All cases holding that tort claims accrue at the time of the
negligent act or injury are hereby overruled.”)
OI’s motion argues that the statute of limitations on plaintiff’s claim began to run on
January 5, 2010, when Valmore Prust was diagnosed with lung cancer. However, this is not
sufficient to trigger “discovery.” Plaintiff learned of the injury on January 8th, but the causal
connection between the injury and defendant’s conduct was not yet discovered. When plaintiff
asked the diagnosing physician whether Prust’s lung cancer was caused by asbestos, she was told
it was not. (Ex 9 at ¶18.) Plaintiff first discovered that Prust’s lung cancer was linked to
asbestos on October 23, 2013, when Dr. Henry Anderson provided a report to plaintiff’s
attorneys. (Ex 9 at ¶19.)
Again, “A hunch or belief that is not presently supportable does not constitute the kind of
knowledge that charges a possible plaintiff with the immediate duty to commence an action.”
Borello, 130 Wis.2d at 413, fn. 5. Rather, a plaintiff is charged with a duty to commence her
action “only when there (is) some medical evidence of a probable link.” Id. OI’s motion to
dismiss must be denied to preserve “the interest of justice and fundamental fairness.” Hansen.
335 N.W.2d at 583.

3. Plaintiff has Pled Proper Counts of Negligence and Strict Liability against O-I
Plaintiff has pled two bases for relief: (1) O-I “designed and sold licenses for a patent to
manufacture fire doors incorporating asbestos-containing cores,” and (2) “O-I also manufactured,
sold, and designed asbestos products, including without limitation fire door cores.” (Ex. 9 at ¶7.

4

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 5 of 15

See also ¶28, ¶29, and ¶40.) O-I’s motion to dismiss only discusses the patent and does not
address the allegations that O-I was the manufacturer of asbestos-containing cores.

A. O-I’s Analysis of Patent Law
As to the patent allegations, O-I discusses patent law without relating the discussion to
the relevant standards of Wisconsin negligence and strict products liability law. Plaintiff has not
pled a case of patent infringement or challenged the validity of claims made by O-I in obtaining
the O-I fire door manufacturing process patent. Rather, plaintiff has pled that negligence
occurred when O-I sold a license to use a dangerous manufacturing process, was paid for each
door sold using this process, and decedent was foreseeably injured.
Like anyone else, under Wisconsin law patent holders are liable to those injured by their
negligent conduct. For example, in Dolin v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,2014 U.S. Dist.LEXIS
26219 (N.D. Ill., 2014), a court held that a brand manufacturer can be liable after its patent has
expired to those injured by generic drugs following the patent’s design. The court said, “the
foreseeability of Plaintiff's injury as a result of such negligence should not be controversial.” Id.
at 16.

B. WI Negligence: Decedent’s Injury was Foreseeable
Plaintiff has pled the following:
1.

O-I “designed and sold licenses for a patent to manufacture fire doors
incorporating asbestos-containing cores,” (Ex. 9 at ¶7.)

5

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 6 of 15

2.

“It was reasonably foreseeable to O-I that decedent and other workers working in
or in proximity to Kaylo fire door manufacturing operations at Weyerhaeuser
would inhale asbestos fibers released during the operations,” (Ex. 9 at ¶32.)

3.

O-I “breached its duty of care and was negligent” by failing to warn and to
“instruct plaintiff, his employers, patent licensees, or others in the use of
precautionary measures relating to airborne asbestos fibers released during
production of Kaylo fire doors,” (Ex. 9 at ¶36.)

4.

“As a direct and proximate result of the acts and omissions of defendant above,
the plaintiff and decedent were injured(.)” (Ex. 1 at ¶37.)

Taken together, these pleadings comprise a valid claim for relief under Wisconsin
negligence law, as the pleadings include allegations of duty (defined in Wisconsin by
foreseeability), breach of duty, causation, and injury.
Plaintiff does not dispute the need to allege the existence of a duty under Wisconsin law.
The existence of a duty is determined in Wisconsin by foreseeability: “A defendant’s duty is
established when it can be said that it was foreseeable that his act or omission to act may cause
harm to someone. A party is negligent when he commits an act when some harm to someone is
foreseeable.” Rolph v. EBI Cos., 159 Wis. 2d 518, 532, 464 N.W.2d 667 (1991) (quoting
Schuster v. Altenberg, 144 Wis. 2d 223, 235, 424 N.W.2d 159 (1988)). See Schilling v. Stockel,
26 Wis. 2d 525, 532, 133 N.W.2d 335 (1965) (“[T]he law is that if the act is one which the party
ought, in the exercise of ordinary care, to have anticipated was liable to result in injury to others,
then he is liable for any injury proximately resulting from it, although he could not have
anticipated the particular injury which did happen.”) (quoting Klassa v. Milwaukee Gas Light
Co., 273 Wis. 176, 182, 77 N.W.2d 397 (1956)).
6

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 7 of 15

Under Wisconsin negligence law, the liability of a defendant is “not examined in terms of
whether there is a duty to do a specific act.” Hornback v. Archdioceses of Milwaukee, 2008 WI
98, ¶24, 313 Wis. 2d 294, 310, 752 N.W.2d 862 (2008) (quoting Nichols v. Progressive Northern
Ins. Co., 2008 WI 20, ¶45, 308 Wis. 2d 17, 746 N.W.2d 220 (2008)). Wisconsin courts follow
the famous minority opinion of Judge Andrews in Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y.
339, 162 N.E. 99, 103 (N.Y. 1928), holding that “[everyone] owes to the world at large the duty
of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others.” Hornback,
2008 WI 98, ¶22 (quoting Palsgraf, followed). Followed in Behrendt v. W.D.M. Enterprises of
Marinette, WI, Co., 2009 WI 71, ¶17 . Under this framework, a person is negligent “if the
person, without intending to do harm does something (or fails to do something) that a reasonable
person would recognize as creating an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to a person or
property.” Id. (quoting Alvarado v. Sersch, 2003 WI 55, ¶14, 262 Wis. 2d 74, 662 N.W.2d 350
(2003)).
For example in A. E . Investment the Wisconsin Supreme Court held an architect could be
found liable for not taking into account the condition of subsoil in design of a building. 62 Wis.
2d at 485-87. The building floor became uneven and the premises became untenable. The
building owner sued for lost income and the defendant architect demurred claiming no duty
existed. The trial court overruled the demurrer and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed,
stating:
A defendant's duty is established when it can be said that it was foreseeable that his act or
omission to act may cause harm to someone. A party is negligent when he commits an act
when some harm to someone is foreseeable. Once negligence is established, the
defendant is liable for unforeseeable consequences as well as foreseeable ones. In
addition, he is liable to unforeseeable plaintiffs.

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 8 of 15

...
The consistent analyses of this court reveal that the question of duty is not an element of
the court's policy determination. It is, rather, an ingredient in the determination of
negligence. We stated in Schilling v. Stockel, supra, 26 Wis.2d page 531, 133 N.W.2d
page 338, “. . . once an act has been found to be negligent, we no longer look to see if
there was a duty to the one who was in fact injured.” In Cirillo v. Milwaukee (1967), 34
Wis.2d 705, 711, 150 N.W.2d 460, 463, we said: “This court has often stated that 'harm
must be reasonably foreseen as probable by a person of ordinary prudence under the
circumstances, if conduct resulting in such harm is to constitute negligence.” There is no
necessity, however, that the actual harm that resulted from the conduct be foreseen.
A. E. Investment Corp. v. Link Builders, Inc., 62 Wis. 2d 479, 485 (1974).
The question at the pleading stage is whether O-I’s conduct as alleged as a matter of law
makes the injury unforeseeable. Accepting as true the allegations of the complaint, O-I had
notice of the dangers of asbestos as an ingredient, obtained the patent, licensed the patent, and
collected royalties for each door manufactured under the patent.
The O-I fire door patent stated “asbestos fibers” were “preferably” to be used in
individual strips which were tongued and grooved to fit together as the core of the composite fire
door. In the exercise of ordinary prudence, a patent licensor ought to know this construction
process involved extensive cutting to create the tongue and groove pieces, would release dust
containing asbestos, and foreseeably result in injury. The pertinent language in Patent No.
2,593,050 is as follows:
The core or body of the panel consists of a light-weight, fire-proof material,
preferably hydrous calcium silicate with a spiculated asbestos fiber binder. Such
a material is now on the market under the trade name Kaylo. [Underscoring
added.]

8

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 9 of 15

...Said core consisting of a plurality fo articulated sections in the form of
individual strips extending across said core and joined edge-to-edge, the adjoining
edge surfaces thereof being formed with interlocking tongues and grooves fitted
together...
(Ex. 10 at 2, 3.) Since O-I itself was in the business of making the asbestos containing Kaylo
cores, the foreseeability to O-I is virtually undeniable.
Regardless of whether O-I’s patent required the use of asbestos,1 it was foreseeable to O-I
that asbestos would sometimes be used as part of the patented process. As licensors of a patent
known to potentially use asbestos, O-I breached its duty by failing to warn or “instruct decedent,
his employers, patent licensees, or others in the use of precautionary measures relating to
airborne asbestos fibers(.)” (Ex. 9 at ¶36.) These actions could have prevented the harm that was
foreseeably caused by the use of O-I’s patent. Since asbestos was used at the Marshfield door
plant as an ingredient of the cores, the duty to protect by those actions exists. O-I’s argument
that no duty exists because a patent licensee need not use asbestos is irrelevant in a situation
where asbestos was foreseeably and actually used.
Since asbestos is a dangerous disease-causing toxin and since this fact was well known by
the 1940’s, a person who in the 1950’s prescribes the use of asbestos in a product it is licensing
ought to know, in the exercise of ordinary prudence, that such conduct might result in injury to
others. That is all that needs to be shown to go to a jury. See Klassa, 273 Wis. at 182; Schilling,
26 Wis. 2d at 532; Schuster, 144 Wis. 2d at 235; Rolph, 159 Wis. 2d at 532; Nichols, 2008 WI
20, ¶45; Hornback, 2008 WI 98, ¶24.

Which, reading the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, it did.

9

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 10 of 15

Wisconsin courts have routinely held that even in “hard” or “unusual cases,” defined as
those “in which the injury suffered is a remote or unusual result of the act claimed to be
negligent,” the question of foreseeability should be submitted to the jury:
It would seem to be preferable to submit these hard cases to the jury in so far as
determining the issues of negligence and causation in the same manner as in the ordinary
case. If the jury does determine that there was negligence, and that such negligence was a
substantial factor in producing the injury, it is then for the court to decide as a matter of
law whether or not considerations of public policy require that there be no liability.
Pfeifer v. Standard Gateway Theater, 262 Wis. 229, 240 (1952) (citing Osborne v. Montgomery,
203 Wis. 223 [1931].)
In special circumstances, Wisconsin courts may determine after a jury trial that no
liability should be imposed even though a negligent act was committed. In Wisconsin, the courts
normally defer taking up the issue of whether public policy justifies a nonliability finding by the
court until a full factual record has been developed and a jury has been allowed to make a
negligence determination. See Thomas ex rel. Gramling v. Mallett, 2005 WI 129, ¶166, 285 Wis.
2d 236, 323 & n.54, 701 N.W.2d 523, 565 (2005) (noting that “as with the constitutional
arguments, [this court] expresses no opinion on the dissent’s analysis, except to acknowledge
that this court retains the ability to limit liability based on public policy factors but rarely invokes
this power before a finding of negligence has occurred.”). As the court stated in Alvarado, 2003
WI 55, ¶18: “In most cases, the better practice is to submit the case to the jury before determining
whether the public policy considerations preclude liability. Only in those cases where the facts
are simple to ascertain and the public policy questions have been fully presented may a court

10

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 11 of 15

review public policy and preclude liability before trial.” This negligence case should be
submitted to a jury to decide.
Nonliability is a question of public policy and does not speak to the presence or absence
of duty. The Supreme Court observed in Schilling, 26 Wis. 2d at 532, “our decisions since 1952
direct that nonliability be based on considerations of public policy rather than couched in terms
of an absence of duty.” At this stage, plaintiff has sufficiently pled that O-I owed a duty by
pleading the foreseeability of plaintiff’s injuries.
Moreover, nonliability findings are rare, restricted to cases where the imposition of
liability would “shock the conscience of society.” See Schilling, 26 Wis. 2d at 533 (“. . . in cases
so extreme that it would shock the conscience of society to impose liability, the courts may step
in and hold as a matter of law that there is no liability.”) (quoting Pfeifer v. Standard Gateway
Theater, Inc., 262 Wis. 229, 238, 55 N.W.2d 19 (1952)); and see Rolph v. EBI Cos., 159 Wis. 2d
at 534 (“The essential rationale for limiting liability on the grounds of public policy is that the
imposition of liability “would shock the conscience of society.”) (quoting Schilling).2
The sole case O-I cites as precedent for dismissing plaintiff’s negligence claim, Geboy,
was a federal court determination based on public policy after the facts had been fully developed.
The facts are distinguishable from those alleged in plaintiff’s pleadings. The ruling in Geboy
was based on the trial court’s determination that the defendants “acted solely as a broker in the
2

The Wisconsin courts have stated the following public policy facts are helpful in determining whether to so limit
liability: “(1) The injury is too remote from the negligence; or (2) the injury is too wholly out of proportion to the
culpability of the negligent tort-feasor; or (3) in retrospect it appears too highly extraordinary that the negligence
should have brought about the harm; or (4) because allowance of recovery would place too unreasonable a burden on
the negligent tort-feasor; or (5) because allowance of recovery would be too likely to open the way for fraudulent
claims; or (6) allowance of recovery would enter a field that has no sensible or just stopping point.” Rolph v. EBI
Cos., 159 Wis. 2d at 534 (quoting Coffey v. Milwaukee, 74 Wis. 2d 526, 541, 247 N.W.2d 132 (1976)).

11

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 12 of 15

sale,” and the defendants “did not have an affirmative duty to warn subsequent owners of any
dangerous conditions of which they had no notice.” Geboy v. TRL Inc., 159 F.3d 993 at 997 (7th
Cir. 1998). The 7th Circuit stated:
(B)oth of these defendants had minimal contact with the vertical boring mill;
neither company had any occasion to foresee an unreasonable risk of harm in that
neither Chalmers and Kubeck nor Industrial Plant Services had the opportunity (or
affirmative duty for that matter) to view the rotating drive shaft of the vertical
boring mill in operation and to discover a potential risk of harm. To expose every
business that comes into contact with a product to potential liability “would shock
the conscience of society because it would have no sensible or just stopping
point.” Rolph, 464 N.W.2d at 673.
Id. at 1000.
Here, O-I had notice of the dangers of their patent and chose to both license and collect
royalties on use of the patent. Imposing liability on these facts cannot be said to “shock the
conscience of society.” To the contrary, imposing liability on a patent licensor that explicitly
recommends and profits off the use of a dangerous toxin accords with society’s sense of what is
just.

C. WI Strict Liability:
Plaintiff has pled the following:
1.

“Defendant was in the business of selling Kaylo fire doors (including both patent
rights and manufactured cores),” (Ex. 9 at ¶40.);

2.

“The Kaylo patent process was sold with the expectation by O-I that the process
would be followed without substantial change and the production of doors
12

Case: 3:14-cv-00143-wmc Document #: 46 Filed: 06/20/14 Page 13 of 15

pursuant to the process would release asbestos fibers into the air.” (Ex. 9 at ¶42.)
3.

A sale of the patented process occurred in which O-I was paid “for each Kaylo
door produced,” (Ex. 9 at ¶41.)

4.

O-I failed to investigate, test, warn, or “instruct decedent, his employers, patent
licensees, or others in the use of precautionary measures relating to airborne
asbestos released during production of Kaylo fire doors;” (Ex. 9 at ¶44.) and

5.

As a result of the defective process sold by O-I, which used asbestos in the
manufacture of the Kaylo fire doors, plaintiff and decedent were injured. (Ex. 9 at
¶45.)

Taken together, these pleadings comprise a valid claim for relief under Wisconsin law.
The Restatement (Second) of Torts, sec. 402A, adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in
Dippel v. Sciano, 37 Wis.2d 443 (1967), states:
(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user
or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to
the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if (a) the seller is engaged in the
business of selling such a product, and (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or
consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.
O-I was in the business of selling both the patent, which provided the manufacturing
process by which the doors were made, and Kaylo door cores. O-I had an interest in the sale of
the doors made by Weyerhaeuser pursuant to the royalty payment when a door was sold. As a
result of the defective and unreasonably dangerous condition of the patented manufacturing
process, doors were manufactured causing the exposures to asbestos. O-I was later part of the
sale of these products pursuant to the royalty paid for each door sold. The products liability
13

claim should proceed as pled under Wisconsin law.

Conclusion
For the above reasons, plaintiff asks the court to deny Owens-Illinois Inc.’s Motion to
Dismiss.
