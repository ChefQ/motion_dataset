and Lulu C. Wang (collectively, the “MetLife Defendants”) respectfully submit
this sur-reply memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand.
ARGUMENT
In its reply brief, Plaintiff acknowledges for the first time that SLUSA
“limits the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts.”

(Doc. 29, Reply at 9.)

However, as explained below, Plaintiff’s argument that this limitation encompasses
only actions asserting state law claims is contrary to SLUSA’s express language
and makes no sense.
The jurisdictional provision of Section 77v(a),1 from which Plaintiff
selectively quotes, sets forth the scope of concurrent state court jurisdiction over
actions asserting 1933 Act claims:
The district courts of the United States . . . shall have
jurisdiction . . . concurrent with State and Territorial
courts, except as provided in section 77p of this title
with respect to covered class actions, of all suits in
equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability
or duty created by this subchapter.

1

Section 77v(a) includes both a jurisdictional provision and an anti-removal provision.

Case 2:12-cv-02626-HGD Document 32

15 U.S.C. § 77v(a) (emphasis added). By its plain language, the jurisdictional
provision exempts from concurrent state court jurisdiction “covered class actions,”
as provided in Section 77p, that are “brought to enforce any liability or duty
created by” the 1933 Act.2 (Doc. 26, Opp’n at 3-11.)
The reference in the jurisdictional provision to “Section 77p” can only refer
to Section 77p(f)(2), which defines “covered class actions.” 15 U.S.C. § 77p(f)(2).
The other three subsections of Section 77p that refer to “covered class actions”
deal exclusively with state law claims and therefore cannot act to limit jurisdiction
over actions asserting 1933 Act claims. Knox v. Agria Corp., 613 F. Supp. 2d 419,
423-24 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (referring to 15 U.S.C. §§ 77p(b), 77p(c), 77p(d)); see
also Lapin v. Facebook, Inc., No. C-12-3195, 2012 WL 3647409, at *2 (N.D. Cal.
Aug. 23, 2012); In re Fannie Mae, 2009 WL 4067266, at *2. It is absurd to
suggest, as Plaintiff does, that SLUSA limits state courts’ jurisdiction over cases
asserting 1933 Act claims – which are federal claims – by divesting those courts of
jurisdiction over cases asserting state law claims. (Doc. 29, Reply at 9.)
The fact that state courts lack jurisdiction over covered class actions
asserting 1933 Act claims, including this action, is of critical importance because
the anti-removal provision of Section 77v(a) only applies to cases that were
2

State courts retain concurrent jurisdiction over cases that do not meet the definition of
“covered class actions,” such as those asserting individual 1933 Act claims. See In re
Fannie Mae 2008 Sec. Litig., No. 08 Civ. 7831, 2009 WL 4067266, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.
24, 2009).

originally brought in a “State court of competent jurisdiction.” 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a).
Because the Circuit Court in which this action was originally filed is not a “State
court of competent jurisdiction,” the anti-removal provision – on which Plaintiff’s
remand motion is based – does not apply. (Doc. 26, Opp’n at 7-8.) Not one of the
cases cited by Plaintiff addresses this argument.3
Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand should be denied.
This 27th day of September, 2012.
Respectfully submitted,

Plaintiff erroneously asserts that this argument has been addressed by the cases it cites, but it
does not and cannot point to a single such case. (Doc. 29, Reply at 8.) Furthermore,
although Plaintiff expressly acknowledges that “neither the Supreme Court nor any Circuit
Court of Appeals has addressed the issue” of when removal is proper under SLUSA (Doc.
29, Reply at 3 n.4), Plaintiff incorrectly states that Riley v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Inc., 292 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2002) is binding precedent and that its position is
supported by “Eleventh Circuit authority.” (Doc. 29, Reply at 7.) See Williams v. AFC
Enterprises, Inc., 389 F.3d 1185, 1189 n.6 (11th Cir. 2004) (“We agree with the district
court’s conclusion that this language from Riley is ‘technically’ dicta.”).
