INTRODUCTION

2

This Court should deny defendants' summary judgment motion that the asserted claims of

3 U.S. Patent No. 5,347,295 ("the '295 patent") are invalid for obviousness. To be entitled to summary
4 judgment, defendants must show there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the obviousness of
5 the asserted claims.

Here, there are numerous disputed factual issues that go to the heart of

6 defendants' obviousness contentions for each of the ten different asserted claims.

Indeed,

7 defendants' own expert acknowledges that his opinions on obviousness are "in many instances,
8 factually challenged by Lucent and its expert, Mr. Ward." (Ex. 1, 11/9/07 Kelly Dep. at 58). Simply
9 put, defendants' obviousness contentions boil down to a classic factual dispute regarding the factual
10 inquiries that underlie the obviousness inquiry.
11

It bears emphasis that defendants acknowledge that no prior art reference discloses all the

12 limitations in any of the asserted claims—each of which cover different aspects of the innovative
13 '295 patent pen computing system. Instead, defendants hope to fill the holes in their invalidity
14 analysis with a patchwork of different prior art references and conclusory references to the
15 obviousness of the differences. But the evidence does not support defendants' position—let alone
16 demonstrate invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. For example:
17

1.

The prior art does not disclose a single set of gestures for identical executable
commands at both the operating system level and the application level as required by
the Court's constructions for claims 1, 3, 4, 6, and 12 of the '295 patent;

2.

Adding proximity sensing to the FIDS system, as required by claims 3 and 12 of the
'295 patent, would have been expected to reduce that system's overall performance
and therefore would not have been obvious;

3.

Adding compound gestures to the FIDS system, as required by claims 39 and 40 of
the '295 patent, would have moved away from the touted simplicity and familiarity of
the FIDS system's in-place gesture set and therefore would not have been obvious;

4.

The FIDS system's simple and familiar gesture set would not require, nor does the
paper even suggest, displaying on the FIDS screen a shape representing the actual
gesture made by a user of the computer as required by claims 6 and 43 of the '295
patent; and

The FIDS Paper considered, but rejected, the teachings of the Coleman paper
including the teaching that the direction of motion of said gesture is associated with
the predetermined action as required by claim 46 of the '295 patent.

For at least these reasons, defendants' motion for summary judgment should be denied.

COUNTER-STATEMENT OF FACTS

7

A.

The Invention of the '295 Patent

At the time of the '295 patent invention, most computers were operated, with rare exception,

8 by a keyboard and a mouse. (Ex. 2, 3/31/06 Ward Expert Report ¶ 25). Pen-based computers,
9 where the user inputs information by marking on the screen with a stylus, had been introduced, but
10 the technology was unrefined and the operation and design presented many challenges. People in
11 the industry were addressing the problem of handwriting to replace the keyboard for text input inside
12 specific applications, but no one had considered controlling the computer overall with a stylus and
13 gestures, let alone the many problems presented by such a concept. (Id.)
14

Hence, the '295 patent disclosed a new class of computer that is controlled by a stylus

15 executing gestures on the computer screen. (Ex. 3, '295 Patent Abstract; col. 1:6-9; FIG. 1). For
16 example, the computer is controllable both inside applications and at the operating system level
17 through gestures and printed characters drawn on the display screen using the electronic stylus. (Id.
18 at col. 7:4-6). This new type of computer used an electronically sensed pen or stylus and digitizer to
19 track the location of the pen or stylus as the primary input device. (Id.) The primary means of
20 controlling the computer: a set of numerous gestures drawn with the stylus over almost any object
21 visible on the display and recognized by a handwriting recognition algorithm. (Id. at col. 3:22-24).

The hardware for the pen-computer described in the '295 patent includes a stylus 4 with a tip

11 6 which is utilized with the computer 2. (Ex. 3, '295 Patent at col. 6:16-18). Liquid crystal display
12 10 is mounted as the front surface of the unit. (Id. at col. 6:20-21). Mounted behind the display is
13 the pen position digitizer 20. (Id. at col. 6:21-22). The digitizer 20 tracks the x and y coordinates of
14 the electronic ink which is then analyzed by a handwriting recognition algorithm. (Id.) Also
15 included is a pen-position digitizer co-processor 90 (not shown) programmed with the handwriting
16 recognition algorithm. (Id. at 6:36-37). The stylus 4 contains a radio frequency inductor/capacitor
17 circuit and the present invention senses when the stylus is in proximity to or in contact with the front
18 surface of the computer. (Id. at col. 6:26-27 and col. 6:61-63).

The Asserted Claims Cover Several Different Aspects of the Pen
Computer System

The claims of the '295 patent cover many different aspects and features of a pen computer
system. Each asserted independent claim of the '295 patent includes a means-plus-function claim
element that—per the Court's claim construction—requires circuitry for performing the function of
"detecting a stroke of the stylus tip in contact with the screen." (Ex. 3, '295 Patent at col. 18:5-7,
20:28-30, 20:52-54). The Court identified the corresponding structure as "[p]en position digitizer
20, as shown in figs. 2 and 3 and described in the specification at col. 6:21-22; and col. 6:53-68."
(Ex. 4, Order Construing Claims for United States Patent No. 5,347,295 at 3, 7, and 9; Ex. 3, '295
Patent). Each of these claims go on, however, to claim different features and characteristics of the
system. For instance, one of the elements of claim 39 requires "recognizing at least a first gesture, a
second gesture, and a third gesture comprising said first and second gestures," which, generally
speaking, relates to a type of compound gesture recognition. Claim 41 requires a "detecting means
for detecting a direction of motion of the creation of said gesture," which, again generally speaking,
relates to a type of directional gesture recognition. The dependent claims similarly claim various
aspects of a pen computer system, including, by way of example, a "means for detecting proximity
of the stylus tip to the screen" (claim 3) and a "means . . . for displaying on said screen a shape
representing the actual gesture made by a user" (claim 6).
In their attempt to show that the claims of the '295 patent were merely obvious combinations
of prior art, defendants obscure many of these claim elements and cobble together snippets from
prior art without any explanation for how the resulting combinations would have been obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention. As this Court's claim construction
makes clear, the '295 patent does not claim pen computer systems or gesture recognition generally.
Rather, each asserted claim is directed to specific, novel, and non-obvious features that can be
incorporated in a pen computer system. Several of these elements are completely absent from
defendants' prior art, and others are present only in ways that would not have been obvious to
combine.

5 Sturman Indus., Inc., 387 F.3d 1358, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)). "The
6 evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his
7 favor." Id. (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986)). Where, as here,
8 "the moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, it cannot obtain summary judgment unless it
9 presents evidence so compelling that no rational jury would fail to award judgment for the moving
10 party." United States v. Boyce, 148 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1080 (S.D. Cal. 2001), aff'd, 36 Fed. Appx.
11 612 (9th Cir. 2002). Where the evidence presents a close question that could be resolved either way
12 by a jury, summary judgment should be denied. See Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc. v. Hartford Acc.
13 & Indem. Co., 974 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1992).
14

A summary judgment determination must also be guided by the appropriate burden of proof.

15 If the Court determines that a reasonable jury applying the proper burden of proof—in this case
16 clear-and-convincing evidence—could find for the non-movant, then there exists a genuine issue of
17 material fact that precludes granting of summary judgment. See Anderson, 475 U.S. at 255.
18

B.

Obviousness

19

Because every patent is presumed valid, accused infringers face a "high burden of showing

20 invalidity on summary judgment." Schumer v. Lab. Computer Sys., Inc., 308 F.3d 1304, 1315 (Fed.
21 Cir. 2002). "[A] moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit
22 clear and convincing evidence of invalidity so that no reasonable jury could find otherwise." Eli
23 Lilly and Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (emphasis added). If evidence
24 is presented establishing a prima facie case of invalidity, the non-movant must come forward with
25 evidence to support a finding of validity, but "the ultimate burden of proving invalidity remains with
26 the challenger throughout the litigation."

Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1360 (Fed.

27 Cir.), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 110 (2007). A claimed invention can be found obvious only "if the
28

differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the

1 subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person
2 having ordinary skill in the art." 35 U.S.C. § 103(a). Obviousness is ultimately a question of law
3 based on underlying determinations of fact. Forest Labs., Inc. v. Ivax Pharms., Inc., 501 F.3d 1263,
4 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
5

Courts have long recognized the need to "guard against slipping into use of hindsight" when

6 considering whether an invention would have been obvious at the time of the invention. Graham v.
7 John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1, 36 (1966) (internal quotations omitted). To combat the
8 tendency toward hindsight, Graham requires courts to focus on several underlying factual inquiries,
9 including "four general types, all of which must be considered by the trier of fact: (1) the scope and
10 content of the prior art; (2) the level of ordinary skill in the art; (3) the differences between the
11 claimed invention and the prior art; and (4) any objective indicia of nonobviousness." Id. Earlier
12 this year, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the primacy of those factors in determining
13 whether a patent is invalid for obviousness. See KSR Int'l. Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 127 S. Ct. 1727, 1734
14 (2007) (citing Graham, 383 U.S. at 17-18). Indeed, the trier of fact must consider all four of the
15 Graham factors when assessing obviousness, Forest Labs., 501 F.3d at 1269. Under Graham's
16 fourth factor, courts are to "look at any secondary considerations that would prove instructive,"
17 including "identify[ing] a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant
18 field to combine elements in the way the claimed new invention does." KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1739,

Defendants misstate the proper legal standard for obviousness, mischaracterize the impact of the
Supreme Court's KSR decision, and gloss over the heavy burden of proof they face on summary
judgment. KSR did not render a sweeping change in the law of obviousness. Rather, KSR
reaffirmed the Graham framework as the touchstone for an obviousness analysis. Takeda Chem.
Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting that KSR held
that the Graham factors "still control an obviousness inquiry"); Lucent Techs. Inc. v. Gateway, Inc.,
509 F. Supp. 2d 912, 934 (S.D. Cal. 2007) ("KSR also reaffirmed familiar principles set out in
Graham."). Also contrary to defendants' view, the Supreme Court acknowledged the continued
relevance of the teaching, suggestion, motivation ("TSM") principle. KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1741.

"[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements;

2 instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the
3 legal conclusion of obviousness." KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1741 (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988
4 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Thus, "the burden falls on the patent challenger to show by clear and convincing
5 evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had reason to attempt to make the
6 composition or device, or carry out the claimed process, and would have had a reasonable
7 expectation of success in doing so." PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342,
8 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1740). In light of these mandated factual inquiries,
9 "a district court properly may grant summary judgment on obviousness . . . only when the[se]
10 underlying factual inquiries present no lingering genuine issues." Beckson Marine, Inc. v. NFM,
11 Inc., 292 F.3d 718, 723 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
12

In that regard, the Supreme Court has "acknowledged the importance of identifying 'a reason

13 that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in
14 the way the claimed new invention does' in an obviousness determination." Takeda, 492 F.3d at
15 1356-57 (quoting KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1731). Accordingly, "a patent composed of several elements is
16 not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that element was, independently, known in the prior
17 art." KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1731. For example, "combining elements that work together 'in an
18 unexpected and fruitful manner' would not have been obvious." PharmaStem, 491 F.3d at 1360
19 (quoting KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1740). Moreover, "when the prior art teaches away from combining
20 certain known elements, discovery of a successful means of combining them is more likely to be
21 nonobvious." KSR, 127 S. Ct at 1740.

ARGUMENT
A.

The Prior Art Does Not Render Obvious any Claim of the '295 Patent

Defendants' invalidity analysis completely ignores critical claim elements that are missing

26 from the prior art and defendants fail to address the fact that the prior art teaches away from their
27 cobbled-together combinations. Accordingly, the prior art cannot render obvious the '295 patent.

The Prior Art Does Not Disclose a Single Set of Recognized
Gestures for Identical Executable Commands at Both the
Operating System Level and the Application Level, as Required
by the Court's Construction of Claims 1, 3, 4, 6, and 12

Asserted claim 1, and dependent claims 3, 4, 6, and 12 include the limitation:
means coupled to said computer for implementing each said
recognized gesture, said implementing means including means for
performing a predetermined action associated with each said
predefined shape, said predetermined action being determined by the
context in which said gesture was used, including a first context in
which said action is executed upon an operating system level object
and a second context in which said action is executed upon an
application level object.
(Ex. 3, '295 patent, col. 18:19-28). The Court's claim construction Order states "[t]his paragraph
specifically claims the system's design allowing use of a single set of gestures for identical
executable commands at both the operating system level and the application level." (Ex. 4, Order
Construing Claims For U.S. Pat. 5,347,295 at 5). Significantly, the gestures in this limitation are
"said recognized gesture[s]," as set forth in the previous claim limitation:
means coupled to said computer for recognizing a plurality of said
gestures, said recognizing means including means for comparing each
said gesture to at least one predefined shape.

17 (Id. at col. 18:15-18). Accordingly, to qualify as a "recognized gesture" within the meaning of this
18 claim, the gesture must be recognized by "comparing each said gesture to at least one predefined
19 shape." (Id.; Ex. 4, Order Construing Claims For U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,295 at 4 citing handwriting
20 recognition algorithms that utilize shape recognition of, for example, symbols or marks).
21

The Levine Patent describes a computer system with a graphical user interface that allows

22 use of a stylus and digitizing tablet, including a "touch-and-lift" operation, but the reference lacks
23 many of the elements of the asserted claims. Contrary to defendants' view, the Levine Patent fails to
24 disclose recognized gestures within the meaning of the claims. (Ex. 3, '295 patent, col. 18:15-18;
25 Ex. 4, Order Construing Claims For U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,295 at 4; Ex. 5, Levine Patent at 10:20-44;
26 Ex. 6, 10/12/07 Ward Expert Report ¶¶ 43-46). Defendants mistakenly refer to the Levine Patent's
27 touch-and-lift operation as a "gesture" within the meaning of the claims. That operation is not a
28

recognized gesture within the meaning of the claims because in the touch-and-lift operation there is

2 context of the touch-and-lift operation, the Levine Patent states:
3
4
5

7

A "touch and lift" operation is used for selecting an item exhibited on
display unit 18. Preferably, once the writing tip end 30 or the erasure
end 28 makes contact with the tablet surface, the "touch" part of the
operation is defined, but the user must lift the stylus end 28, 30 from
the tablet surface within the succeeding second or so to define the
"lift" portion of the operation. If the user delays lifting stylus end 28,
30, then the "touch and lift" operation is not invoked, and no effect
results.

8 (Id. at col. 10:26-35). The touch and lift operation is defined by the stylus tip's contact and departure
9 from the screen, and time. (Id.) There is no recognition of shapes involved in defining the Levine
10 Patent's touch and lift operation. (Id.) Hence, the touch and lift operation is not a "recognized
11 gesture." (Id.; Ex. 6, 10/12/07 Ward Expert Report ¶¶ 43-46).
12

Thus, even if it were obvious to combine the Levine Patent with FIDS, which it is not, doing

13 so would not lead to the claimed invention. Claims 1, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are not rendered obvious by the
14 combination of the FIDS Paper and the Levine Patent. Accordingly, defendants are not entitled to
15 summary judgment of obviousness as to these claims.

Adding Proximity Sensing to the FIDS System, as Required by
Claims 3 and 12, Would Detract from Its Overall Performance
and Therefore Would Not Have Been Obvious

Asserted claim 3 includes the limitation:
said second detecting means includes means for detecting proximity of
the stylus tip to the screen; and said apparatus further includes means
coupled to said computer for displaying on said display an indicator of
the proximity of the stylus tip to the screen.

22 (Ex. 3, '295 Patent at col. 18:32-36). The FIDS Paper describes a prototype tablet (flat panel display
23 with front-mounted digitizer) and a prototype text editing application. The Taguchi Patent describes
24 a rear-mounted proximity sensing digitizer. Neither the FIDS Paper nor the Taguchi Patent disclose
25 all of the elements of the '295 claims. Nevertheless, defendants argue that it would have been
26 obvious to combine the proximity-sensing-digitizer disclosed by Taguchi with the system disclosed
27 by the FIDS Paper. (Microsoft Br. at 7).

In that regard, defendants argue that "[t]he FIDS Paper discusses the problems of parallax,

2 [Ex. B at 74]; rear-mounted proximity sensing digitizers—like that in the Taguchi Patent—
3 indisputably reduce parallax problems, [Ex. L at 90:2-91:2-4]." (Id.) However, defendants' only
4 support for that proposition is a conclusory statement by their own expert. (Microsoft Br. at 7 (citing
5 Ex. 1, 11/9/07 Kelly Dep. at 90:2-91:4)). The proposition is simply incorrect.
6

In fact, proximity sensing digitizers potentially increase the problem of parallax. The FIDS

7 Paper states that "parallax problems are caused by the distance between the sensing mechanism and
8 the underlying image." (Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at 74). Dr. Kelly, defendants' own expert, states that "if
9 you are touching something that is above what you're trying to identify, there is a potential
10 misconvergence, and that's referred to as 'parallax.'" (Ex. 1, 11/9/07 Kelly Dep. at 90:21-24). When
11 using a proximity sensing rear-mounted digitizer, the digitizer recognizes or senses the stylus tip
12 before it contacts the screen, resulting in a potential greater distance between the stylus tip and the
13 underlying image. In fact, with proximity sensing, the user may attempt to identify an image on the
14 screen with the tip of the stylus suspended in air above the display screen. Such a situation "might
15 make parallax errors more apparent, as the tracking cursor would be visibly offset from the actual
16 position of the stylus tip," potentially making it even more difficult for the user to align the stylus
17 tip, the tracking cursor, and the underlying image. (Ex. 8, 5/12/06 Ward Expert Report ¶ 87).
18

Accordingly, it would not have been obvious to add means for detecting proximity of the

19 stylus tip to the screen. The combination of the FIDS Paper and Taguchi Patent do not, therefore,
20 render obvious claim 3 or 12. Further, as it would not have been obvious to add proximity sensing
21 to the FIDS system, it likewise would not have been obvious to include means coupled to said
22 computer for displaying an indicator of the proximity of the stylus tip to the screen.2 Accordingly,
23 defendants are not entitled to summary judgment of obviousness of claim 3 or 12.
24
25
2 Dependent claim 12 calls for "means for terminating display of said indicator when the stylus tip
26 departs from proximity to the screen." It likewise would not have been obvious to include this
27 feature for the same reasons discussed above.

Adding Compound Gestures to FIDS Cuts Against the Touted
Simplicity and Familiarity of the FIDS System's In-Place Gesture
Set

Asserted claim 39 and its dependent claim 40 include the limitation:
means for . . . recognizing at least a first gesture, a second gesture, and
a third gesture comprising said first and second gestures

4

5 (Ex. 3, '295 patent at col. 20:31-38). Defendants admit that the FIDS reference does not disclose this
6 limitation. (Microsoft Br. at 9). Defendants argue, based on their expert's analysis, that this
7 limitation would have been obvious in light of the FIDS Paper and the Buxton Paper. (Microsoft Br.
8 at 9 citing Kelly Expert Report (Ex. D) at 176-77, 33-39, and 84-94). The Buxton Paper provides a
9 general description of a system with a digitizing tablet for musical notation, but the reference lacks
10 many elements of the claims.
11

Defendants argue that because the FIDS Paper is "suitable . . . for exotic and special

12 application" it would have been obvious to add additional gestures to the system and to combine the
13 FIDS Paper and the Buxton Paper. (Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at 75-76). That proposition reads far too
14 much into what is no more than a vague rumination in the FIDS Paper. (Id.) What the FIDS Paper
15 actually discloses is that "many existing applications could be ported to the FIDS system" and
16 "benefit from the new style of interaction" (Id. at 75)—and thereby use the FIDS system's in-place
17 gesture set.
18

Defendants ignore that the FIDS Paper emphasizes the importance of simplicity and

19 familiarity in its already-existing gesture set. (Id. at 81). Specifically, the FIDS Paper states
20 "similarity with existing techniques is important in a new computer tool. As proof correction
21 marks—already familiar to many—are used for basic editing tasks, the learning time for this system
22 should be less than for the usual text-editor." (Id.) Also, "recall of the methods and the commands
23 should be easier." (Id.) Additionally, "[t]he naturalness of the marks, we believe, prevents some
24 errors due to faulty recall." (Id.)
25

Indeed, FIDS does not contemplate—in fact it discourages—adding a different, more

26 complicated, and less familiar set of gestures such as the musical notations disclosed in Buxton, to
27 the already-existing text editing and proof reading gesture set of FIDS. (Ex. 6, 10/12/07 Ward

1 Expert Report ¶ 128). These facts teach against combining the Buxton Paper with the FIDS Paper
2 and raise genuine issues of material fact as to the obviousness of these claims.

In light of these facts, it would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to add

4 the musical notation gestures of Buxton to the simple and familiar text editing gesture set disclosed
5 in the FIDS Paper. Accordingly, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment of obviousness of

The FIDS System's Simple and Familiar Gestures Would Not
Require—and the Paper Teaches Away from—Displaying a
Shape Representing the Actual Gesture

Asserted dependent claims 6 and 43 include the limitation:
means coupled to said computer for displaying on said screen a shape
representing the actual gesture made by a user of the computer
(Ex. 3, '295 Patent at col. 18:43-46 and col. 21:10-12). Defendants state that it would have been
obvious to combine this feature from Taguchi with the FIDS system because FIDS "discusses
sketching figures and patterns on the screen, [Ex. B at 78], which would necessarily require
displaying on the screen the actual marks drawn." (Microsoft Br. at 8 (citing Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at
78)). Defendants' conclusion that a discussion of sketching figures and patterns on the screen would
"necessarily require" displaying the actual shape drawn relies on an unsupported leap of reasoning.
First, the FIDS Paper in no way suggests "displaying on [the FIDS] screen a shape
representing the actual gesture made by a user," as specifically required by claims 6 and 43. (Ex. 7,
FIDS Paper at 78; see also Ex. 3, '295 Patent at col. 18:43-46 and col. 21:10-12). Second, even if
the discussion of sketching figures and patterns on the screen could somehow be interpreted to
necessarily require displaying the shape, which it does not, the FIDS Paper itself teaches away from
such a technique. (Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at 78). The authors explain that "[t]he patterns drawn would
be interpreted by software using pattern recognition methods and converted to the primitives
intended. However, as a pattern recognition problem this is quite complicated." (Id.) (emphasis
added). Third, the FIDS Paper discloses a limited set of proof correction marks "already familiar to
many" and states that "recall of the methods and commands should be eas[y]." (Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at

1 81). A simple gesture set "already familiar to many" and easily recalled by the users simply would
2 not require displaying on the screen the shape representing the actual gesture. (Ex. 6, 10/12/07 Ward
3 Expert Report ¶ 120).
4

These facts ground defendants before they can make their leap as to the obviousness of these

5 claims. Indeed, these facts teach away from the claimed limitation and at a minimum raise genuine
6 issues of material fact as to the obviousness of these claims. Therefore it would not have been
7 obvious to combine the FIDS Paper and Taguchi Patent, and defendants are not entitled to summary
8 judgment of obviousness of claims 6 and 43.

The FIDS Paper Considered but Rejected the Coleman Paper

Asserted dependent claim 46 includes the limitation:
wherein [the] direction of motion of [the] gesture is associated with
[the] predetermined action.
(Ex. 3, '295 Patent at col. 22:9-11). Defendants argue it would have been obvious to combine the
teachings of the Coleman Paper with the FIDS Paper and that the resulting combination renders
claim 46 obvious. (Microsoft Br. at 11). The Coleman Paper describes a system for text editing
using a stylus to draw proofreader's symbols. Defendants are wrong that the proffered combination
would have been obvious.
First, replacing a "simpl[e]" algorithm that "work[ed] quite well" with a more complicated
algorithm that included detecting direction of motion and association of the direction with a
predetermined action simply defies common sense. The FIDS Paper discloses that "[f]or recognition
of the editing marks drawn on the display, methods used in character recognition were adapted. A
simple algorithm differentiates between the marks." (Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at 77) ( emphasis added).
This simple algorithm used filtering and extraction of character features including "starting point and
ending point of each stroke, minimum and maximum x and y values, and direction angles at the
beginning of a stroke. Finally, a decision tree is applied to classify the marks." Id.) "Simplicity is
the main advantage of the algorithm. It works quite well." (Id.)

Second, the authors of the FIDS Paper considered different algorithms, identified the most

2 promising alternative, and disclosed that the chosen alternative did not involve direction of motion.
3 (Ex. 7, FIDS Paper at 77). Indeed, the authors of the FIDS Paper considered more advanced
4 algorithms to make recognition more reliable. But the authors concluded that "[o]ur research
5 suggests that most promising of the applicable algorithms are methods using the direction angles of
6 the point sequences forming the strokes." (Id. at 77-78).
7

Third, and significantly, the authors of the FIDS Paper rejected the teachings of the Coleman

8 Paper. (Id. at 77). The authors stated that "[s]omewhat similar ideas have also been considered by
9 other researchers." (Id. at 77 (citing the Coleman Paper); see also id. at Reference 26 on p. 82). But
10 the authors concluded that these other researchers' "approaches have been more limited and without
11 possibilities offered by the FIDS hardware." (Id. at 77) (emphasis added).
12

Striving for simplicity, which the authors of the FIDS Paper had with their current design,

13 having considered more complicated algorithms and found most promising one that did not include
14 direction of motion recognition, and having considered but rejected the Coleman Paper's ideas, the
15 FIDS Paper simply did not lend itself to any combination—let alone an obvious combination—with
16 the Coleman Paper. Accordingly, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment of obviousness
17 of claim 46.

This Court's Previous Order and Defendants' Previous
Statements Preclude Finding that It Would Have Been Obvious
to Add a Rear-Mounted Digitizer to the FIDS System, as
Required by the Court's Claim Construction for each of the
Asserted Claims

All the asserted claims include the limitation:
detecting means coupled to said computer for detecting a stroke of the
stylus tip in contact with the screen.
(Ex. 3, '295 patent, col. 18:5-7, 20:28-30, 20:52-54; see also Section II.B above). The Court
construed this means-plus-function limitation to include corresponding structure pen position
digitizer 20. (Ex. 4, Order Construing Claims For U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,295 at 3, 7, and 9).

Defendants previously argued to this Court that front-mounted digitizers are the "very

2 antithesis" and "substantial[ly] different[t]" than rear-mounted digitizers. (Ex. 9, Mem. of Points and
3 Auths. in Supp. of Mot. of Dell, Inc. for Summ. J. on Non-Infringement of the Asserted Claims of
4 U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,295 at 8-9). Defendants pointed out that certain sections of the specification
5 "state unequivocally that the disclosed digitizer is of a type that is mounted behind the display:
6 'Mounted behind the display is the pen position digitizer 20.'" (Ex. 9, Mem. of Points and Auths. In
7 Supp. Of Mot. Of Dell, Inc. For Summ. J. Of Non-Infringement On the Asserted Claims Of U.S.
8 Patent No. 5,347,295 To Agulnick et al. at 3) (emphasis in original). In its March 8, 2007 Order the
9 Court accepted that view and "interpret[ed] the word 'screen' to include the display . . . but not to
10 include the digitizer." In doing so, the Court effectively amended its claim construction and held
11 that devices with front-mounted digitizers, such as certain of defendants' accused products, were
12 beyond the scope of the claims. (Ex. 10, Court's 3/08/07 Order Granting Summary Adjudication of
13 No Infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,347,295).
14

Since the Court's March 8th Order, of course, Lucent has proceeded under the assumption

15 that the parties were bound by that Order. Defendants, however, despite having previously argued—
16 and won—on this issue, now change their view of the claim language and argue that prior art having
17 a front-mounted digitizer renders the patent invalid. That is inconsistent with the Court's March 8th
18 Order. The Court's ruling that a front-mounted digitizer is beyond the scope of the claims—in which
19 the Court accepted defendants' argument that front-mounted digitizers are the "very antithesis" of
20 rear-mounted digitizers—cuts against finding that it would have been obvious to combine a front21 mounted digitizer with a device that had a rear-mounted digitizer. Accordingly, to the extent this
22 Court maintains its prior ruling accepting defendants' position regarding front-mounted digitizers,
23 summary judgment of obviousness should be denied.

And in any event, defendants should not be allowed to take one position on claim

Defendants Fail to Identify any Prior Art Having a Pen-Position
Digitizer Co-Processor, as Required by the Court's Construction
for each of the Asserted Claims

All of the asserted claims include means-plus-function claim elements that the Court has

10 construed to include the corresponding structure "pen position digitizer co-processor 90, as shown in
11 fig. 3 and described in the specification at Col. 6:36-37." (Ex. 4, Order Construing Claims For U.S.
12 Pat. No. 5,347,295 at 4, 8, and 10). Defendants have failed to identify any disclosure in the prior art
13 that constitutes a pen position digitizer co-processor.
14

Defendants argue that "[t]he FIDS paper discloses a central processor programmed with

15 software that determines that a gesture is complete." (Microsoft's Br. at 6) (emphasis in original). In
16 support of that argument, defendants cite Dr. Kelly's expert report, which, in turn, points to page 74
17 of the FIDS Paper. But defendants' liberal paraphrasing completely misstates what the FIDS Paper
18 discloses. All that page 74 of the FIDS Paper discloses is that the "environment for the prototype"
19 included an "80186-based microcomputer workstation" and a "flat-panel display . . . connected to the
20 IDC186 graphics controller." The paper says nothing at all about which, if any, of these structures
21 constitutes a "co-processor . . . with software that determines that a gesture is complete," as required
22 by the Court's construction. Nor have defendants pointed to any other prior art reference disclosing
23 specific structure that constitutes a co-processor with software that determines that a gesture is
24 complete. The question whether modern day central processors could satisfy this limitation—which
25 is the subject of Mr. Ward's infringement opinion—has no bearing on the question whether
26 defendants have identified any prior art that actually discloses structure satisfying the co-processor

Defendants argue that it is inconsistent for Mr. Ward to opine—in his validity report—that the
21 claims require a "specific component" corresponding to the co-processor, while also opining—in his
infringement report—that a central processor (CPU) programmed with software could meet this
22 limitation. (Microsoft Br. at 5-6). There is nothing inconsistent about Mr. Ward's positions. In his
23 infringement report, Mr. Ward states that "[t]he pen position co-processor is implemented in Tablet
PC devices as a software virtualization of hardware. Modern CPUs in Tablet PC devices are
24 sufficiently capable that they can handle running the software on both the main processor (CPU 50
in the '295 patent) and the pen position digitizer co-processor 90 described in the '295 patent." (Ex.
25 2, 3/31/06 Ward Expert Report ¶ 119). Thus, in Mr. Ward's view, a modern CPU programmed with
software as a virtualization of hardware is the "specific component" corresponding to the co26 processor. Defendants have not pointed to any such CPUs in the prior art, nor does it appear that
27 CPUs were capable of filling this role at the time of the invention.
