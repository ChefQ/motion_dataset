DEFENDANTS

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY’S MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS
Defendant Weyerhaeuser Company (“Weyerhaeuser” or “Defendant”), moves to stay all
proceedings in this case pending the outcome of an appeal before the Seventh Circuit Court of

Appeals of this Court’s rulings in six, substantially similar cases. 1 In the interest of judicial
economy and to avoid unnecessary litigation costs, this case should be stayed because the issues
on appeal will directly impact the outcome of pending motions, the scope of discovery, and
future litigation in this case, and because Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
This case is the latest in a line of asbestos cases filed by the Cascino Vaughn Law Offices
(“CVLO”). The present case was filed on July 20, 2016, approximately a year after the plaintiff,
Elvira Kilty, passed away. (See Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 20). As in the other CVLO cases, Plaintiffs claim
Decedent’s mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos through her 39-year employment
at a facility formerly owned by Weyerhaeuser in Marshfield, Wisconsin, through dust emitted
into the community air of Marshfield, and through fibers transported outside the plant on the
clothes of some unidentified persons to some unspecified houses, vehicles and locations. (Id. at ¶
1

The cases at issue are Pecher v. Owens Illinois, Case No. 3:14-147; Jacobs v. Rapid American, Case No. 3:12-899;
Masephol v. Owens Illinois, Case No. 3:14‐ 186; Sydow v. Owens-Illinois, Case No. 3:14‐219; Boyer v. OwensIllinois, Case No. 3:14‐286; Seehafer v. Owens-Illinois, Case No. 3:14‐ 161. As to Weyerhaeuser, the cases at issue
in this appeal are Masephol, Seehafer, and Jacobs.

15). On September 19, 2016, Weyerhaeuser filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that Plaintiffs’
claims are barred by the exclusivity provision of the Wisconsin Workers’ Compensation Act, are
preempted by the Clean Air Act, fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted, and, as to
private nuisance, are barred by the statute of limitations. (See Dkt. Nos. 8, 9). 2
Plaintiffs’ claims are substantially similar to those made in the cases now on appeal
before the Seventh Circuit. Compare Dkt. No. 1 with Boyer v. Owens-Illinois, Case No. 3:14286, at Dkt. 475-3. In addition, plaintiff-appellants seek review of rulings by this Court that
would determine the outcome of Plaintiffs’ claims in this case. In particular, plaintiff-

appellants appeal this Court’s rulings (1) that plaintiffs’ occupational claims are barred by
Wisconsin’s Workers’ Compensation exclusivity provision; (2) that plaintiffs may not rely on
NESHAP or other regulatory standards under the Clean Air Act to support their nuisance claims;
(3) that plaintiffs’ private nuisance claims fail due to lack of possessory interest; (4) that

plaintiffs’ claims against Owens-Illinois premised on a patent liability theory fail; and (5) that
plaintiffs’ claims against Weyerhaeuser fail when they could make no showing they lived in the
city of Marshfield. (See Consolidated Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellants at ii-iii, Pecher v. OwensIllinois, No. 16-1799 (7th Cir. Sept. 30, 2016) attached hereto as Exhibit A. 3 See also Ex. B at
p. 7, Sept. 22, 2016 Decl. of Bob McCoy in support of 2d Mot. to Enlarge Vol. ). Plaintiffappellants filed their consolidated brief with the Seventh Circuit on September 30, 2016, and
briefing is to be completed November 14, 2016. 4

Plaintiffs’ response is due October 11, and Weyerhaeuser’s reply is to be submitted October 20, 2016.
A full copy of Plaintiff-appellants’ consolidated brief will be made available to the Court upon request, but is not
attached hereto due to the volume of the brief and associated appendix.

Weyerhaeuser is to file its response on October 31, 2016, and Plaintiff-appellants will submit their reply on
November 14, 2016. (See Orders attached hereto as Exhibit C).

So that all parties may avoid unnecessary litigation, Counsel for Weyerhaeuser requested
that Plaintiff’s counsel agree to a stay pending outcome of the appeal to the Seventh Circuit.
Although Plaintiff’s counsel did not object to a stay, he suggested that discovery of “aging
witnesses and documents” proceed. (See Correspondence attached hereto as Exhibit D). Counsel
for defendants O-I, 3M, and Metropolitan Life have agreed to a stay. (Id.).

ARGUMENT
I.

This Court Has Broad Authority to Stay This Case Pending the Outcome of the
Court of Appeal’s Decision.
The Court has “broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to control

its own docket.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997). “[T]he power to stay proceedings
is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its
docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. N. Am.
Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). Recognizing that the discretion is not boundless, courts “balance
interests favoring a stay against interests frustrated by the action in light of the court's strict duty
to exercise jurisdiction in a timely manner.” Grice Eng'g, Inc. v. JG Innovations, Inc., 691 F.
Supp. 2d 915, 920 (W.D. Wis. 2010) (internal citations omitted). The following factors have
been considered by this Court in determining whether to issue a stay: “(1) whether the litigation
is at an early stage; (2) whether a stay will unduly prejudice or tactically disadvantage the nonmoving party; (3) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and streamline the trial; and
(4) whether a stay will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court.”
Woodman's Food Mkt., Inc. v. Clorox Co., No. 14-CV-734-SLC, 2015 WL 4858396, at *2 (W.D.
Wis. Aug. 13, 2015) (internal citations omitted). All of these considerations favor a stay.

Case: 3:16-cv-00515-wmc Document #: 18 Filed: 10/03/16 Page 4 of 7

This case is at an early stage as Plaintiffs filed their Complaint less than three months
ago, and parties are only now filing their initial responsive pleadings. Because legal issues that
are relevant and potentially dispositive in this case will be addressed on appeal before the
Seventh Circuit, and because there is no identifiable prejudice that would result, Weyerhaeuser
respectfully requests this Court stay proceedings in this case pending outcome of the appeal.
II.

A Stay of the Present Action Is Appropriate to Promote Judicial Economy And
Would Not Prejudice Plaintiffs.
A stay in this case will simplify the issues to be decided in this litigation and “reduce the

burden of litigation on the parties and on the [C]ourt.” Woodman's Food Mkt., Inc., No. 14-CV734-SLC, 2015 WL 4858396, at *2. There is no need for issues to “be litigated twice.” SanDisk
Corp. v. Phison Elecs. Corp., 538 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 1066 (W.D. Wis. 2008). 5 Staying this case
until the Seventh Circuit has ruled is in the interest of judicial economy and efficiency for all
parties.
Plaintiffs hinge their claims on legal issues decided by this Court and now pending before
the Seventh Circuit. (See supra). For example, Plaintiffs claim Decedent’s injury resulted from
her work at the Marshfield plant despite this Court’s now-contested August 22, 2014 order
dismissing claims against Weyerhaeuser arising out of plaintiff’s occupational injuries. (See

5

In SanDisk Corp. v. Phison Electronics Corporation this Court granted defendants’ motions to stay until
related proceedings before the International Trade Commission were resolved. 538 F. Supp. 2d at 1066, 1068. The
proceedings before the commission addressed claims related to the “same products against the same defendants” in
another case, and, “[i]n light of the overlap of products and issues, the cases [were] likely to overlap substantially in
discovery and factual and legal disputes.” Id. at 1066. Likewise, in Woodman's Food Market, Inc. v. The Clorox
Company, this Court granted defendant’s motion to stay pending the court of appeal’s decision on questions certified
for interlocutory review where the defendant’s “standing and potential remedies in [the] case turn[ed] in large part”
on the two questions. No. 14-CV-734-SLC, 2015 WL 4858396, at *3. The Court reasoned that “staying this case
until the court of appeals has had an opportunity to answer these questions ha[d] the potential to reduce all costs
attendant to this lawsuit” as “a substantive ruling from the court of appeals will demarcate—and likely narrow—the
playing field for this court and for the parties.” Id. See also Gensel v. Performant Technologies, Inc., 2015 WL
6158072 at *2 (E.D. Wis. 2015) (granting defendant’s motion to stay in the interest of judicial economy pending the
Seventh Circuit’s ruling on the meaning of a term that would be dispositive of that case).

Compl., Dkt. No. 1 and Ex. A). In addition, despite this Court’s June 2, 2015 order dismissing
plaintiff’s claims based on NESHAP or other regulatory standards under the CAA, Plaintiffs
again claim injury resulting from Weyerhaeuser’s alleged violation of NESHAP. (See id.).
Plaintiffs’ claims against other defendants are likewise directly impacted by the appeal. Despite
this Court’s previous dismissal of claims against Owens-Illinois premised on a patent licensing
theory, Plaintiffs once again depend on this same theory in their allegations against OwensIllinois. (See id.). As in SanDisk and Woodman’s Food Market, the survival of Plaintiffs’ claims
and several Defendants’ liability, if any, turns in large part on the appeal before the Seventh
Circuit. Moreover, the scope of discovery in this case will be directly impacted by the outcome
of the appeal “[i]n light of the overlap of products and issues.” SanDisk Corp. 538 F. Supp. 2d at
1066. Briefing on Weyerhaeuser’s Motion to Dismiss in this case will be completed several
weeks before the briefing on the appeal is to be completed on November 14. As a result, even at
this early stage, absent a stay, parties will expend substantial expense and unnecessarily impose
upon this Court’s time to litigate issues that may be dismissed or re-litigated as a result of the
Seventh Circuit’s rulings.
Moreover, Plaintiffs have not claimed they would be “unduly prejudice[d] or tactically
disadvantage[d]” by a stay. Woodman's Food Mkt., Inc., No. 14-CV-734-SLC, 2015 WL
4858396, at *2. Nor can Plaintiffs point to any interests that would be frustrated or show that
they would “suffer significant harm” simply by waiting until the Seventh Circuit has issued a
decision on the appeals. Cf. id. at *3. While Plaintiff’s counsel suggested parties proceed with
discovery, he identified no “aging witnesses” to be deposed and can point to no discovery that
must proceed to avoid prejudice.

Importantly, Weyerhaeuser does not request an indefinite stay, but only until the appeal is
decided. Plaintiffs have simply identified no hardship that would result from such a stay. See
SanDisk Corp., 538 F. Supp. 2d at 1066 (granting a stay when the “only real ‘injury’” was that
plaintiff would “have to wait for any money damages, which is always the case when a stay is
imposed”). If this case is not stayed, however, the Court and all parties would be forced to relitigate the same issues to be decided on appeal.
Conclusion
Based upon the foregoing, in the interests of judicial economy, justice and fairness, and
to avoid unnecessary litigation costs, Weyerhaeuser respectfully requests the Court issue an
Order staying all proceedings in this case pending outcome of the appeal to the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals.
