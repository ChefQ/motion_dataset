3. Annexed hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the Amended
Complaint in this action.

4, CIM is the managing member and adviser of Colonial. Brody is a principal of
Colonial Asset Management Advisors, Inc., which is the managing member of CIM.

5. Rule 105 of Regulation M ("Rule 105") was promulgated by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") in January, 1997.

6. The Commission alleges that the Defendants violated Rule 105 by engaging in
eight direct violations and ten "sham transactions" that had the effect of hiding violations of the
rule.

7. Since its promulgation, we have found only twelve reported cases brought by
the Commission alleging violations of Rule 105, and each case was settled by way of consent.

8. On November 6, 2003, the Commission issued a proposing release regarding
Regulation SHO, in which it solicited comments to clarify the language of Rule 105.

9. On July 28, 2004, the Commission issued an adopting release of Regulation
SHO that provided interpretive guidance concerning alleged "sham transactions" in connection
with Rule 105.

10. Thirteen of the eighteen alleged violative transactions in this case allegedly
occurred after the Regulation SHO adopting release.

11. On December 6, 2006, Eric Sirri, Director of the Division of Market
Regulation for the Commission, commented on the difficulties of interpreting Rule 105.

12. On December 13, 2006, the Commission issued a proposal for the adoption of
the new Rule 105.

13. On October 9, 2007, the new Rule 105 became effective.
