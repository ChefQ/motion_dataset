I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Defendants Colonial Investment Management, LLC ("CIM"), Colonial Fund LLC
("Colonial"), and Cary G. Brody ("Brody") respectfully submit this Memorandum of Law in
support of their motion, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss the Amended Complaint
("Am Compl.") filed by Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("the Commission" or
"SEC"), which alleges violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M ("Rule 105") promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act").

The Commission asks the Court, among other things, to issue an Order of Permanent
Injunction against the Defendants from engaging in future violations of Rule 105, based on
allegations of past violations of Rule 105 that occurred between October 31, 2001 and December
16, 2004. The Commission's Initial Complaint, however, was filed on October 15, 2007 six days
after the Commission adopted a new Rule 105 that substantively altered the core prohibition
embedded in the old rule by proscribing an entirely different violative act. The Commission's
claim for injunctive relief cannot survive simply by alleging by inference that the Defendants
engaged in conduct that violated the "old" Rule 105 -- thus, they will violate the "new" Rule 105
-- because the violative act in the new Rule 105 was permitted by the old rule.

By way of example, under the Commission's logic, if the Defendants were alleged to
have violated a rule prohibiting talking on cell phones while driving, then those allegations
would be sufficient, with nothing more, to find a reasonable likelihood that the Defendants
would violate a new rule prohibiting cell phones in cars, period. This logic is flawed and should

not be the basis upon which this court grants injunctive relief.

DOCSNY.281291.01

 
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document16 Filed 12/04/2007 Page 6 of 16

Accordingly, because the Commission has not alleged the necessary elements for
obtaining injunctive relief, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may

be granted, and should be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

IL. FACTS

CIM is the managing member and adviser of Colonial. Amended Complaint (annexed to
the accompanying Affidavit of Ira Lee Sorkin, dated December 4, 2007 (the "Sorkin Aff.") as
Ex. A) 0x00A7 10. Brody is a principal of Colonial Asset Management Advisors, Inc. ("Colonial Asset
Management"), which is the managing member of CIM. Am. Compl. { 10.

Colonial, a private investment company under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 80a-3(c)(1)], is a New York-based private hedge fund of
which Brody is a managing director. Am. Compl. 11.

As alleged in the Amended Complaint, Colonial violated Rule 105 of Regulation M
("Rule 105") on eighteen separate occasions between October 31, 2001 and December 16, 2004.
Sorkin Aff. 0x00A7 6. Promulgated by the Commission in January, 1997 Rule 105 is an anti-
manipulation regulation that is intended to protect the integrity and fairness of the offering
process by prohibiting short sellers from covering restricted period short positions with shares
obtained in secondary offerings. Am. Compl. { 14. During the time of Colonial's alleged
violative trades, Rule 105 provided, in pertinent part:

In connection with an offering of securities for cash pursuant to a
registration statement or a notification on a Form 1-A.... filed under the
Securities Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to cover a short sale
with offered securities purchased from an underwriter or broker or dealer
participating in the offering, if such short sale occurred during . . . [t]he
period beginning five business days before the pricing of the offered

securities and ending with such pricing....

Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document16 Filed 12/04/2007 Page 7 of 16

In substance, the Commission alleges that of the eighteen separate occasions, eight of the
transactions constituted direct violations of Rule 105, while the remaining ten were "sham
transactions," that had the effect of hiding violations of Rule 105. Sorkin Aff. 46. According to
the Amended Complaint, these "shams" consisted of "riskless transactions . . . that had no
economic purpose and were designed to hide Colonial's illicit covering with shares it earlier

purchased in the offering." Am. Compl. { 32.

A. Background of Rule 105

Since its promulgation in 1997, we have found only twelve reported cases brought by the
Commission alleging violations of Rule 105, and each case was settled by way of consent.

Sorkin Aff. yen 7.

In addition to the lack of case law regarding the scope of potential Rule 105 violations,
the Commission has also offered very little guidance on the rule. As set forth in the
Commission's Amended Complaint, on November 6, 2003 more than six years after its
promulgation, the Commission for the first time publicly communicated that it was recently
made aware of "conduct designed to evade" Rule 105. Short Sales, Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 48709 (Oct. 28, 2003), 68 Fed. Reg. 62,972 at 62,999 (Nov. 6, 2003) ("Regulation
SHO Proposing Release"); Am. Compl. 0x00A7 53.! While this proposing release provided no
interpretative guidance with respect to Rule 105, it did acknowledge a level of uncertainty

surrounding the rule by soliciting comments to improve the clarity of its language. Jd.; Sorkin

Aff. 48.

 

1 Regulation SHO relates to covering short sales and the requirement, with certain exceptions, that the short seller "locate"
securities to borrow before "going short." Regulation SHO is not relevant to the issues in this case.

Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document16 Filed 12/04/2007 Page 8 of 16

The Amended Complaint does not point out, however, that on July 28, 2004, after
thirteen of the eighteen alleged violative transactions had already occurred, the Commission
issued in an adopting release for Regulation SHO ("Regulation SHO Adopting Release"), its first
and only interpretative guidance with respect to Rule 105, providing two illustrative examples of
"sham transactions" that, although not specifically prohibited by the plain language of the Rule,
would, in the Commission's view, violate Rule 105. See Short Sales, Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 34-50103 (July 28, 2004), 69 Fed. Reg. 48,008, at 48,020 (Aug. 6, 2004); Sorkin
Aff. 99. As recently as December 6, 2006, recognizing that compliance with the old Rule 105
was still a vague and unclear proposition, Eric Sirri, Director of the Division of Market
Regulation for the Commission, acknowledged that "[t]he question of what constitutes a
covering transaction is a difficult one." RACHEL MCTAGUE, SEC MOVES TO REPEAL TICK TEST,
AMEND ANOTHER ANTI-MANIPULATION RULE, 38 Sec. Reg. & L. Rep. 2041, 2042 (Dec. 11,
2006); Sorkin Aff. 0x00A7 11. The Commission also commented one week later, while proposing
adoption of a new Rule 105, that "[if the covering component is not eliminated as the rule
proposed], we would have to continue to address each variance on a case-by-case basis, which
could increase uncertainty in the marketplace." Short Selling in Connection with a Public
Offering, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-54888, 71 Fed. Reg. 75,002, at 75,005 (Dec.
13, 2006); Sorkin Aff. yen 12.

Finally, almost three years after the last alleged violative transaction in this case, the
Commission promulgated a new Rule 105, effective October 9, 2007 which states in pertinent
part:

In connection with an offering of equity securities for cash pursuant to a
registration statement or a notification on Form 1-A .. . it shall be

unlawful for any person to sell short the security that is the subject of the
offering and purchase the offered securities from an underwriter or broker

DOCSNY.281291.01

 
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document16 Filed 12/04/2007 Page 9 of 16

or dealer participating in the offering if such short sale was effected during
the period . .. beginning five business days before the pricing of the
offered securities and ending with such pricing....
17 C.F.R. 0x00A7 242.105 (2007); Sorkin Aff. cent 13. With the adoption of the new Rule 105,
the Commission eliminated the covering component as the violative act, thus replacing
what was a vague and ambiguous rule with a black-and-white prohibition with definite
parameters: An investor may now either sell short during the restricted period or
participate in the allocation, but he cannot do both?

The Commission further alleges in this case that Colonial and Brody did not institute
sufficient internal controls to prevent violations of the old Rule 105. Am. Compl. 0x00A7 54. Upon
these facts alone, the Amended Complaint claims that it is reasonably likely that the Defendants
will violate the new Rule 105, which was not in effect during any relevant trading period, in the

future. Am. Compl. 455.

YW. ARGUMENT

A. The Amended Complaint Should be Dismissed

1, The Amended Complaint Fails to Allege Facts Sufficient to Support a
Reasonable Likelihood that a Past Wrongdoing Will Recur

The Commission cannot obtain injunctive relief against future violations of Rule 105
because it has failed to allege any violations of the rule in its current form. Instead, the
Commission claims, based solely on alleged violations of a rule no longer in effect, that there is a
reasonable likelihood that the Defendants will violate a new rule in the future, and because of
this, an Order of Permanent Injunction against future violations of the new rule should issue.

The allegations in the Commission's Amended Complaint are insufficient to support such an

inferential leap-of-faith by this Court.

 

2 There are certain exceptions to the new Rule 105 prohibitions, none of which are relevant to this case.

DOCSNY.281291.01

 
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKC Document16 Filed 12/04/2007 Page 10 of 16

The Commission's Amended Complaint does not allege facts sufficient to carry its initial
burden required for the issuance of a permanent injunction, as "[i]t is well settled that the
Commission cannot obtain relief without positive proof of a reasonable likelihood that past
wrongdoing will recur." SEC v. Bausch & Lomb Inc., 565 F.2d 8, 18 (2d Cir. 1977) (citing SEC
v. Parklane Hosiery Co. Inc., 558 F.2d 1083, 1089 (2d Cir. 1977) (denying application for
permanent injunction because the SEC failed to establish the essential element of injunctive
relief that there exist a reasonable likelihood of repeated wrongdoing)). See also SEC v.
Commonwealth Chemical Sec., 574 F.2d 90, 100 (2d Cir. 1978). Accordingly, injunctive relief
cannot be granted where there are no factual allegations that a defendant is reasonably likely to
repeat the same wrongdoings in the future than those in which he engaged in the past. It follows,
then, that injunctive relief is unavailable where, as here, there is no possibility that past violative
conduct will be repeated, because the conduct that formed the predicate of the past alleged
violations is no longer the same conduct that is proscribed by the rule currently in place.

In the instant case, the Commission has not sufficiently alleged - because it cannot -a
reasonable likelihood that the Defendants will repeat violations of Rule 105 in its current form,
because Rule 105 now prohibits conduct that was squarely within the bounds of legal activity
under the old version. Here, the allegations cannot support the issuance of an injunction, because
the standard for injunction requires the Commission to allege that the Defendants will repeat
past violative conduct, which would require the Commission to show that the Defendants are
likely to repeat violations of the old Rule 105. As emphasized by the Second Circuit, the
Commission must go beyond the mere facts of a past violation of a rule to obtain an injunction
against violating that same rule; a reasonable likelihood of recurrence must also be alleged.

Commonwealth Chemical, 574 F.2d at100. The Commission cannot allege such likelihood of
