OBJECTION OF SECURED CREDITOR FAR EAST NATIONAL BANK
TO DEBTOR'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF USE OF
CASH COLLATERAL ON AN INTERIM AND FINAL BASIS

Secured Creditor Far East National Bank ("FENB") hereby objects to the Debtor's
Motion for Approval of Use of Cash Collateral on an Interim and Final Basis. FENB realistically
understands that Debtor must request the use of cash collateral in order to continue post-petition
operations. However, Debtor has failed to provide sufficient information to this Court and FENB or
to provide a budget that includes realistic adequate protection payments to FENB while also
providing for payment of wages and benefits to employees, taxes and other necessary operational
expenses. Moreover, the proposed budget apparently improperly includes use of FENB's cash
collateral for a non-debtor related entity, which is the restaurant located at the hotel that is not
operated by this Debtor.

Upon learning of the commencement of the case, FENB immediately notified
counsel for the Debtor that under Section 363(c)(2) that the Debtor cannot use and is not authorized
to use FENB's cash collateral without either the consent of FENB or an order of this Court. The
letter went on to inform counsel for the Debtor that FENB did not consent to the use of its cash
collateral and invited counsel to discuss a potential agreement and budget. Debtor's response was to
file the Motion. Prior to the bankruptcy filing the Debtor did not contact FENB to discuss filing the
case with budgets in place. Rather, the Debtor failed to keep its secured creditor informed and did
not take any appropriate steps to avoid the Debtor's self-created emergency over the use of FENB's
cash collateral.

Inadequate Evidence. The Debtor's "evidence" in support of its emergency motion
leaves the court to guess as to many important facts. First, the declarant provides no identification
as to who she is and what her role is with the Debtor's organization. All she says is that she is "an
officer of the Atman Hospitality Group, Inc." What type of officer and what personal knowledge
she has regarding the Debtor's finances are left to the imagination of the court.

Most disturbing is the lack of information regarding the Debtor's current financial

circumstances and what the Debtor has been doing with any excess cash for the last 12 months. The

Declaration of Josie Chen in Support of Motion For Use of Cash Collateral at paragraph 7 states:

Over the course of the last several years, the Business income has
dropped substantially. As a result, given the monthly installment due
to the Bank, the Debtor fell behind. In addition, there was an internal
squabble between some of the Debtor's shareholders such that a
replacement chief executive was put in place in October 2010. That
chief executive opted not to make any payment at all to the Bank. As
a result, the Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings and the
foreclosure was scheduled for September 20, 2011.

No Explanation of Excess Cash. The Debtor's budget shows that if there are no

 

payments to the secured lender there is excess cash on hand each month. Where is this excess
cash? And how much cash does the debtor have on hand?

Inadequate Explanation as to Why Payments to Bank Were Suspended. The
declaration also notes that the Debtor replaced its chief executive in October 2010 and that the new
chief executive "opted not to make any payment at all to the Bank." No explanation is provided
as to why such a course of action was adopted and no explanation is provided. Did the
"squabbling" shareholders decide to sweep the excess cash and keep it for themselves. What
was management's plan when it decided to ignore the Bank's assignment of rents and
exacerbate its default with the secured creditor? The answers to these questions may reveal
mismanagement by the Debtor. At this point in time, the Chapter 11 filing is a "skeletal" filing and
there are no schedules or statement of affairs to provide the court with any comfort that this
bankruptcy "ship" is not listing 20 degrees to starboard.

No Specific or Detailed Information. The budget attached to the Declaration of Josie
Chen in Support of the Motion ("Chen Declaration') is both unrealistic and inappropriate. Further
information is necessary to understand the basis for the budgeted amounts for many entries in the
proposed budget. In particular, FENB specifically requests information broken down to provide
staffing totals at the hotel for management, front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, banquet and
meeting room sales, staff and food and beverage operations.

Restaurant: Separate Entity? In addition, it is FENB's understanding that the

 

restaurant 1s a separate entity from the Debtor. That also raises a question as to whether the chef

and restaurant managers are employees of the Debtor or of a separate entity known as Atman
Anderson Hotel Swan Lake Bistro, LLC, doing business as West Side Grill.' It is incumbent upon
Debtor to clarify whether the proposed cash collateral budget includes funding for a restaurant that
is not owned and operated by the Debtor.

Financing Costs? The proposed cash collateral budget shows "Financing Costs" of
only $27,000.00, but gives no information as to how that sum was calculated or on what basis it is
proposed. This sum is substantially less than the interest payment would be on the loans. Interest at
the contract rate of 6.5% is approximately $58,174.31 per month.

Property Taxes. There is no information as to how the property tax budget item will
be handled and whether amounts will be paid to the county to be applied to delinquent property
taxes or otherwise.

Management Fees. In addition, there are substantial management fees budgeted
totaling approximately $74,000.00 annually, but no management agreement has been submitted and
there is no indication that the management fee is anything other than a way of compensating
insiders of the Debtor. Indeed, the Declaration of Josie Chen does not say one way or the other
whether the hotel is being managed by a separate management company, nor does it provide any
specific information on the restaurant operations.

Cash on Hand at Start and End of Period. The budget indicates there will be net
income at the end of the reporting period in the sum of $300,600, but there is no showing as to
where those funds will be used. There is also no showing of cash on hand as of the commencement
of the case and how those sums-also FENB's cash collateral-will be spent.

Final Approval of Use of Cash Collateral Should Not Be Granted on This showing.
In short, while FENB is prepared to consent to the use of its cash collateral for the purpose of

maintaining hotel operations for an interim short term period, the information presented in the

 

' Copies of the Statement of Information filed with the Secretary of State by Atman
Anderson Hotel Swan Lake Bistro LLC and of the LLC-1 for the same company are attached hereto
as Exhibits 1 and 2. FENB respectfully requests that the Court take judicial notice of these exhibits
pursuant to Rule 20, Fed.R.Evid.

Motion and the budget by Debtor is entirely inadequate to support a final order authorizing the use
of FENB's cash collateral and the proposed adequate protection is either nonexistent or falls far
short of the mark. FENB believes that this Court should authorize the use of cash collateral on a
very short term interim basis while requiring Debtor to provide the information requested above so
that FENB and other creditors can analyze the cash flow of the Debtor and make certain that
proceeds of FENB's cash collateral are being used only for necessary expenses of the Debtor and
not being diverted to a related entity or insiders, provided that payments be made to FENB at no

less than the contract rate under both of its secured loans.
