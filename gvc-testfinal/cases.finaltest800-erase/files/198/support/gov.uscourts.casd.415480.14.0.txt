MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTBORITES
BACKGROUND
This action arises from the alleged distribution of allegedly pornographic

4
5

photographs of the Plaintiff taken when she was under the age of eighteen. The

6

Plaintiff contends that the Chanson Defendants, along with the other defendants,

7

distributed allegedly lewd and lascivious images of the Plaintiff through a website.

8
9

However, the Plaintiff does not and cannot ascertain that the Chanson Defendants

10

are in any way associated with the website on which the photographs allegedly

11

appeared. All the Plaintiff's allegations against the Chanson Defendants are "upon

12

13

information and belief." See Complaint ~15 - 20. As Randazza and Harvey are

14

aware, there is no legal or factual basis for joining the Chanson Defendants in this

15

action, and accordingly, the Chanson Defendants are entitled to Rule 11 sanctions

16

17

against Randazza and Harvey for filing the Complaint in this action. Gutierrez v.

18

Fox, 141 F .3d 425, 427 (2d Cir. 1998) ("If an attorney alleges jurisdiction when

19

20

reasonable inquiry would show that it did not exist, he may be held liable for

21

sanctions substantial in amount. See International Shipping Co., S.A. v. Hydra

22

Offshore, Inc., 875 F.2d 388, 390 (2d Cir.1989); Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d

23

24

1265, 1275 (2d Cir.l986); Weisman v. Rivlin, 598 F.Supp.724, 726 (D.D.C.1984)").

MOTION FOR SANCTIONS

Case 3:13-cv-01238-CAB-BLM Document 14 Filed 10/02/13 Page 6 of 14

1

Rule 11 requires that "allegations and other factual contentions have

2

evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary

3

support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery." Rule

4

5

II(b)(3). Similarly, it requires that "the claims ... and other legal contentions

6

therein are warranted by existing law or by a non frivolous argument for the

7

extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new

8

9

law."Rule 11 (b)(2). Finally, it requires that a paper "not be[] presented for any

10

improper purpose, such as to harass." Rule II(b)(1).

11

Rule 11 makes every signature on a pleading, motion or other paper a

12
13

certification of merits of the documents signed and authorizes sanctions for violation

14

of the certification. Fed.R.Civ. P. 11. Any signing party has "an affirmative duty to

15
16
17
18
19
20

conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and the law before filing." Business

Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 551
(1991). An attorney's signature on a complaint is tantamount to a warranty that the
complaint is well grounded in fact and existing law (or proposes a good faith

21

extension of the existing law) and that it is not filed for an improper purpose.

22

Christian v. Mattei, Inc., 286 F.3d 1118, 1127 (9th Cir, 2002); Truesdell v. Southern

23
24

California Permanente Medical Group, 293 F.3d 1146, 1153 (9th Cir. 2002). '''Rule

25

11 explicitly and unambiguously imposes an affirmative duty on each attorney to

26

conduct a reasonable inquiry into the viability of a pleading before it is signed. '"

Gutierrez v. Fox, 141 F.3d 425,427 (2d Cir. 1998), quoting Eastway Construction

2

Corp. v. City ojNew York, 762 F.2d 243, 253 (2d Cir. 1985). "Reasonable inquiry"

3

requires attorneys to seek credible infonnation rather than proceed on mere

4

5
6

7

suspicions or supposition. California Architectural Building Products v. Franciscan

Ceramics, 818 F.2dI466, 1472 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Cabell v. Petty, 810
F.2d463, 466 (4th Cir. 1987) (lawsuit cannot be used as a "speculative effort to fmd

8

9

someone [ ] liable for plaintiffs injuries"). Thus, "a complaint containing allegations

10

unsupported by any infonnation obtained prior to filing, or allegations based on

11

infonnation which minimal factual inquiry would disprove, will subject the author to

12

13
14
15

sanctions."In re Kunstler, 914 F.2d 505, 516 (4th Cir. 1990).
It is not acceptable to file suit first and find out later whether or not the

plaintiff has a case against the defendant. See Hale v. Harney, 786 F.2d 688,692

16
17

(5th Cir. 1986). "It is not pennissible to file suit and use discovery as the sole means

18

of finding out whether you have a case.... Rule 11 requires independent inquiry."

19

Szabo Food Service, Inc. v. Canteen Corp., 823 F.2dl073, 1083 (7th Cir. 1987);

20
21

see also, Albright v. Upjohn, 788 F.2d 1217, 1221 (6th Cir.l986) (Rule 11 "stresses

22

the need for some pre filing inquiry into both the facts and the law to satisfy the

23
24
25
26

affinnative duty imposed by the rule.").
Thus, Rule 11 authorizes "the imposition of sanctions upon a fmding that a
factual allegation has no evidentiary support, unless there was a specific disclaimer

that additional investigation was necessary."O'Brien v. Alexander, 101 F.3dI479,
1489 (2d Cir. 1996).Accordingly, "[f]actual allegations on information and belief are
proper only if they are specifically identified as 'likely to have evidentiary support

4
5

6
7

after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation and discovery.'" Hon.
William W. Schwarzer, et aI., California Practice Guide: Federal Civil Procedure
Before Trial, -U 17:55 at17-24.2 (Rutter Group 1999) (emphasis in original), quoting

8
9

Fed.R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3); accord 2 Moore's Federal Practice §11.1 1[9][a] at 11-36 (3d

10

ed. 2001). "A litigant is not relieved from its obligation to conduct an appropriate

11

investigation into the facts that is 'reasonable under the circumstances.'" Schwarzer,

12
13

Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, -U 17:55.3 at 17-25, quoting Fed. R. Civ. P.

14

11 (b).

15

Rule 11 is also violated where the claim is not warranted by existing law or

16
17

a non frivolous" argument for change of that law. Legal arguments are held to an

18

"objective standard of reasonableness," and Rule 11 is violated where, for example,

19

it is "clear ... that there is no chance of success and no reasonable argument to

20

21

extend, modifY, or reverse the law as it stands."Caisse Nationale v. Valcorp., Inc., 28

22

F.3d 259, 264 (2d Cir. 1994). Rule 11 "establishes an objective standard, intended to

23
24

eliminate any 'empty-head pure-heart' justification" for frivolous arguments, Margo

25

v. Weiss, 213 F.3d 55, 64 (2d Cir.2000). "Subjective good faith ... provides [no]

26

safe harbor." Eastway Construction Corp. v. City o/New York, 762 F.2d 243, 253

(2dCir. 1985), citing, e.g., William W. Schwarzer, Sanctions Under the New Federal
Rule 11 -- A Closer Look, 104 F .R.D. 181 (1985); see also, Mann v. G & G Mfg.,

Inc., 900 F.2d 953, 958 (6th Cir.l990).

Not only the signing attorney but his or her law fInn is responsible. See
Rule 11(c)(I) ("Absent exceptional circumstances, a law fIrm must be held jointly
responsible fora violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee");

8
9

2 Moore's Federal Practice § I 1.23 [6][b] at 11-50-517(3d ed. 2001). Even if a

10

pleading states a meritorious claim against one defendant, that does not justify

11

adding others against whom the claim is frivolous. Townsend v. Holman Consulting

12
13

Corp., 914 F.2d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir. 1990); see also Cross & Cross Properties v.

14

Everett Allied Co., 886 F.2d 497, 505(2d Cir. 1989)(Rule 11 is violated even where

15

only part of a pleading, rather than the entire pleading, is frivolous).

16
17
18

Accordingly for the reasons outlined above, a grant of sanctions against
Randazza and Harvey is wholly appropriate. In fact, sanctions are mandatory in

19
the event the court determines Rule 11 has been violated, although the court has
20
21

"wide discretion" in delineating the extent of those sanctions. Albright, supra at

22

1222 ("Rule 11 expressly mandates the imposition of sanctions once a violation is

23
found").
24
25
26

Additionally, although Rule 11 sanctions generally take the form of an order
to pay a monetary penalty into court, Rule 11 ( c )(2), where a suit is brought for an

improper purpose, such as to harass, Rule 11 explicitly allows for expenses incurred

2

as a direct result ofthe violation to be paid directly to the other party. See Union

ARGtTMENT
Randazza and Harvey Siened and Filed a Frivolous Complaint

12
13

14
15

The Chanson Defendants are out-of-state defendants and the Plaintiff has
failed to show in her Complaint that the Chanson Defendants are amenable to suit in
this district. The Sixth Circuit has explained that there are two kinds of personal

16
17

jurisdiction that can be exercised, general and specifi,c. Brunner v. Hampson, 441

18

F.3d 457,463 (6th Cir.2006). General jurisdiction exists when the defendant's

19

contacts with the forum state are "substantial" and "continuous and systematic,"

20
21

such that the state may exercise personal jurisdiction even if the action does not

22

relate to the defendant's contacts with the state. Youn v. Track, Inc., 324 F.3d 409,

23
24
25

418 (6th Cir.2003). Specific jurisdiction exists when the contacts giving rise to
jurisdiction relate to the claim that is before the court. Id.

Enter. v. Financial Fed. Credit, Inc., 803 F.Supp. 1251, 1259-61 (E.D.Mich.1992)

18

903, 909 (E.D. Mich. 2003).

19

20

The Chanson Defendants are not involved with the website or the company at

21

the heart of the Plaintiff's claims. See Declaration of Roy E. Chanson " 6-17 and

22
23

Declaration of Amy L. Chanson " 6-17. The Plaintiff's self-serving statements that

24

the Chanson Defendants "actively participate, and materially assist Eric S. Chanson,

25

in operating websites on the World Wide Web" are insufficient to establish any

26

connection. Complaint' 3-4. The Plaintiff jumps from an allegation that ''upon

infonnation and belief, Roy E. Chanson supervised, assisted, and participated in
fonnatting and distribution of the images appearing on the YouGotPosted website,

5

6

7

that therefore, Roy E. Chanson is a partner of defendants Kevin C. Bollaert and Eric
S. Chanson and an alter-ego of defendant Blue Mist Media LLC. Complaint ~ 16-17.
The Plaintiff makes the same leap with regard to the status of Amy L. Chanson.

8
9

Complaint ~ 19-20. See, e.g., Escude Cruz v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., 619 F.2d 902,

10

905 (1 st Cir.1980) (Holding that conclusory allegations of an alter ego relationship

11

are not sufficient to establish jurisdiction); see a/so, Amba Mktg. Sys. Inc. v. Jobar

12
13

Int'/. Inc., 551 F.2d 784, 787 (9 th Cir. 1977) (stating that plaintiff cannot "simply

14

rest on the bare allegations of its complaint"). Accordingly, the Plaintiff's

15

Complaint against the Chanson Defendants should be dismissed.

16
17
18

Randazza and Harvey are attorneys and should have been aware of the law
that governs jurisdiction in an action in federal court. Even aside from the fact that

19

the Chanson Defendants did not harm the Plaintiff in any way and were not involved
20
21

in the alleged distribution of allegedly pornographic photographs of her, Randazza

22

and Harvey had no basis for asserting that this Court had jurisdiction over the

23
24

25

Chanson Defendants. Accordingly, this motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11
should be granted against Randazza and Harvey.
