MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

This Memorandum is filed in opposition to Defendants’ Notice of Motion and Motion for

3

Leave to File Motion for Reconsideration; Or Alternatively Certification of Issues for Appeal

4

(“the Motion”). Defendants’ Motion should be denied in its entirety.

5
6

I.

STATEMENT OF ISSUES TO BE DECIDED
Whether the Court should consider or grant Defendants’ request for reconsideration of the

7
Court’s May 29, 2008 order and opinion (“the Order”) denying their motion to dismiss when the
8
request for reconsideration largely repeats Defendants’ previous arguments and whether, in the
9
alternative, the Court of Appeals should be asked to review several issues that Defendants claim
10
were wrongly decided by this Court when it rejected their motion to dismiss.
11
12
13

II.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The Consolidated Complaint (“the Complaint”) sets out extensive allegations of

14

wrongdoing by Defendants which are supported by detailed factual assertions. Despite the

15

discovery stay imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”), the

16

allegations in the Complaint are supported by a number of reliable sources, including information

17

provided by Defendant LDK’s former financial controller, Charley Situ. As set forth in the

18

Complaint, Situ left the Company near the end of the Class Period, revealing that Defendants had

19

been cooking LDK’s books and inflating its inventory. Defendants do not suggest that Situ had

20

any motive to lie and, as the Court noted in its Order, it is difficult to see who within a company

21

would be better positioned to have personal knowledge of accounting fraud than its financial

22

controller. This was especially true at LDK, where Situ was hired to deal with known accounting

23

problems and was the Company’s liaison with its outside auditors.

24

Standing alone, Situ’s information would support a strong inference that Defendants acted

25

with scienter. But his allegations do not stand alone. They are corroborated by numerous

26

sources, including internal company documents, press reports, the views of knowledgeable

27

securities analysts, a tape recording of a key internal company meeting, the Company’s own

1

admissions, and a sudden and highly unusual post-Class Period change in accounting procedures

2

which seems to confirm that LDK was not properly accounting for its inventory.

3

The Court recognized the strength of Plaintiff’s case in its thorough and well-reasoned

4

Order. Defendants’ current Motion seeks leave to ask for reconsideration of this Order. Despite

5

a local rule prohibiting repetitive argument, the Motion is almost entirely a rehash of the

6

arguments Defendants made previously in support of their motion to dismiss, arguments that the

7

Court properly rejected. Although Defendants’ apparent view is that the Court made erroneous

8

factual determinations in applying the facts alleged to the relevant law, they do not say that the

9

Court used improper legal standards and they identify no new facts or changes in the law that

10

might justify reconsideration. Moreover, Defendants would have the Court look in isolation at a

11

handful of the facts set out in the Complaint, ignoring the Supreme Court’s mandate that, in

12

determining whether a strong inference of scienter has been established, the Complaint must be

13

viewed as a collective whole. Furthermore, a recent Ninth Circuit decision reversing the

14

dismissal of a securities class action, Berson v. Applied Signal Technology, Inc., 527 F.3d 982,

15

2008 WL 2278670 (9th Cir. June 5, 2008) (Kozinski, C.J.), supports Plaintiff’s view that the

16

Court’s analysis of the Complaint in this case was on the mark.

17

Defendants seem to believe that, by constant repetition, unsupported assertions can be

18

converted into actual facts. But no matter how many times Defendants falsely assert that Situ

19

“admitted” he did not check all materials in the warehouse, or that he was not qualified to say

20

what he said, that the Company was exonerated by an “independent” investigation conducted by a

21

“Special Committee,” or that KPMG’s audit found that LDK’s quarterly results were accurate, the

22

Court must apply the facts as they are, not as Defendants would like them to be.

23

The Motion also seeks, in the alternative, leave to file an interlocutory appeal on several

24

issues, factual in nature, which were correctly decided in the Court’s Order. There is even less

25

justification for asking the Ninth Circuit to deal with the minutia of this case than there is for

26

Defendants’ request for reconsideration.

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARD FOR A MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION

6

A.

7

Defendants do not come close to meeting the standard in this District for being granted

8

permission to file a motion for reconsideration. In a likely attempt to conceal the weakness of

9

their position, Defendants misleadingly claim that they seek reconsideration pursuant to “Federal

The Requirements For A Motion For Reconsideration Are Stringent

10

Rules of Civil Procedure … Rule 60 and Civil L.R. 7-9.” (Mot. at 1.) Rule 60(b)(6), which

11

Defendants purport to rely on, provides for relief from judgments and similar “final” orders for

12

“any … reason that justifies relief” from the judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), but “relief under

13

Rule 60(b)(6) requires a showing of ‘extraordinary circumstances,’” Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545

14

U.S. 524, 536 (2005), a showing Defendants do not even claim to have made. More

15

fundamentally, Rule 60 deals only with final orders and judgments and has no relevance to

16

whether the Court should reconsider its interlocutory Order denying Defendants’ motion to

17

dismiss. See, e.g., Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, Inc. v. PPR Realty, Inc., 204 F.3d 867, 880

18

(9th Cir. 2000) (because “preliminary injunctions are ‘interlocutory orders’” they cannot “be

19

addressed by a motion under Rule 60(b)”).

20

Instead, “[m]otions for reconsideration of interlocutory orders are governed in this District

21

by Civil Local Rule 7-9.” Nidec Corp. v. Victor Co. of Japan, Ltd., No. C 05-0686, 2007 WL

22

4108092 at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2007). Under the rule, “before leave to file a motion for

23

reconsideration is granted, the moving party must specifically show:

24

(1)
that at the time of the motion for leave, a material difference
in fact or law exists from that which was presented to the Court
before entry of the interlocutory order for which reconsideration is
sought. The party also must show that in the exercise of reasonable
diligence the party applying for reconsideration did not know such
fact or law at the time of the interlocutory order; or

25
26
27

(2)

3

Document 97

Id. (quoting Civil L.R. 7-9(b)) (emphasis added).
The high threshold set for even allowing consideration of a motion to reconsider reflects

5

sound policy—the demanding standard “lessens the likelihood that parties will, as [the defendant]

6

has done here, opportunistically move the Court to reconsider any order that it disagrees with,

7

needlessly impeding the progress of the case and unduly burdening opposing parties and the

8

Court.” Id. at *4.

9

Defendants do not claim to have met either of the first two grounds set out in Civil Local

10

Rule 7-9(b)—discovery of a previously unknown “material difference in fact or law” from what

11

was presented to the Court at the time of the motion to dismiss or the “emergence of new material

12

facts or a change of law” since the Court rejected the motion to dismiss. Although Defendants do

13

halfheartedly suggest that the Court failed to consider some of their arguments, even a cursory

14

review of their current Motion demonstrates that their real complaint is not that the Court

15

“manifestly” failed to consider their arguments, but that the Court considered these arguments

16

and rejected them. But a contention that a court’s ruling was “wrongly decided” is “not sufficient

17

under Civil Local Rule 7-9(b) to grant leave to file a motion for reconsideration.” Bowoto v.

18

Chevron Corp., No. C 99-02506, 2007 WL 4224593 at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2007).

19

The Local Rules make it sanctionable conduct to repeat previously-made arguments in a

20

motion for reconsideration. Civil L.R. 7-9(c) (“Any party who violates this restriction shall be

21

subject to appropriate sanctions.”). Despite this draconian rule, Defendants’ current Motion is

22

largely a regurgitation of the arguments made in their motion to dismiss.

23

B.

24

The Court fully considered Defendants’ arguments about the inferences that should have

25

been drawn from the facts before the Court. Defendants agree that the Court applied the correct

26

legal standard in deciding whether Plaintiff adequately pled falsity and scienter—whether

27

Plaintiff had pled facts that “were ‘at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could

28

draw from the facts.’” (Mot. at 3) (quoting Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S.

Ct. 2499, 2509-10 (2007)); compare Order at 10 (“A complaint will survive… if a reasonable

2

person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing

3

inference one could draw from the facts alleged.”) (quoting Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2510) (italics by

4

the Court). What Defendants challenge are the inferences drawn by the Court when it applied the

5

facts to this acknowledged standard.

6

1. The Court Did Not Manifestly Fail To Consider “Facts” About LDK’s
Inventory

7

Defendants fault the Court for not considering the “fact” of Situ’s “Admission That He
8
Did Not Verify or Test the Inventory” which was allegedly inflated. (Mot. at 2-3.) According to
9
Defendants, this “admission” is contained in an email string with respect to which the Court
10
“declined to take notice.” (Mot. at 4.)
11
In fact, however, the Order explained that “the Court has reviewed the emails [in the
12
email string] and finds that they actually bolster plaintiffs’ case, thereby reinforcing the Court’s
13
decision to move forward with this action.” (Order at 6 n.1) (emphasis added). As the Court
14
noted, the email string supports the inference that Situ carefully reviewed LDK’s inventory, as the
15
Complaint asserts he did, and nothing in the emails can reasonably be interpreted as an
16
“admission” by Situ that he did not know what he was talking about. See Order at 13-14 (the
17
email string “does not show that Controller Situ admitted an inability to asses the evidence before
18
him”) (emphasis by the Court). Even ignoring what the email string actually says, and accepting
19
Defendants’ unfounded assertion that Situ only checked the inventory in the “warehouse” (Mot.
20
at 4) would provide no grounds for reconsideration—as the Court noted “[b]oth parties referred to
21
‘the’ warehouse rather than ‘all’ warehouses.” (Order at 13.)
22
Defendants attack an argument of their own making when they say that, standing alone,
23
the fact that LDK had production problems because of serious polysilicon shortages does not
24
necessarily prove that LDK’s “inventory accounting numbers were false” (Mot. at 12)—neither
25
the Court nor Plaintiff make such an assertion. But, when combined with the other facts alleged
26
in the Complaint, such shortfalls support Situ’s assertion that LDK misled investors when it

1

assured them that it had a huge polysilicon inventory which was properly valued at the lower of

2

acquisition cost or market value.

3

In discussing this issue Defendants make a puzzling argument—that, although it is true

4

“that the production team [at LDK] could not rely on the book quantities of total inventory when

5

planning production,” this seemingly critical deficiency “in no way reflects on the accuracy of the

6

book quantities” of inventory. (Mot. at 11-12.) A more plausible inference is that the production

7

team could not rely on LDK’s inventory numbers because those numbers were inaccurate and

8

materially inflated.

9

2. The Court Did Not Manifestly Fail to Consider Defendants’ Argument That
They Were Exonerated By Their Investigators And Auditors

10

Despite Defendants’ assertion to the contrary, the Court fully considered their argument
11
that it should give substantial weight to LDK’s “clean” audit opinion and its SEC filings and
12
press releases asserting that the Company had investigated itself and found it had done nothing
13
wrong. The Court rejected this argument on the merits. (Order at 16-17.)
14
LDK’s alleged internal investigation cannot be considered on a motion to dismiss—the
15
investigation is not referenced in the Complaint and, although the court can judicially notice the
16
existence of SEC filings containing LDK’s assertions that it was exonerated by its own
17
investigation, it cannot judicially notice these documents for the truth of the matter asserted, that
18
LDK did nothing wrong. See, e.g., Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 690 (9th Cir. 2001)
19
(on motion to dismiss court may judicially notice “undisputed matters of public record,” but not
20
“disputed facts stated in public records”) (emphasis in original); Troy Group, Inc. v. Tilson, 364
21
F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1152 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (“SEC filings ‘should be considered only for the
22
purpose of determining what statements the documents contain, not to prove the truth of the
23
documents’ contents.’”). Any other rule would permit any public company accused of securities
24
violations to do what LDK attempts to do here—file with the SEC documents asserting that it did
25
nothing wrong (or asserting that investigators it hired found it did nothing wrong) and then claim
26
that the SEC filings exonerate it, while simultaneously denying plaintiffs discovery to test the
27
accuracy of the company’s bald assertions.

Even if LDK’s public characterization of the investigators’ findings could be considered

2

assertion that the investigation was carried out by an independent “Special Committee.” (Mot. at

5

6, 9.) To the contrary, LDK said publicly that the investigation was conducted by the Company’s

6

audit committee, and it is undisputed that Defendant Peng was on this Committee during the

7

investigation.1 And Defendants’ assertion that anyone who questions their supposed exoneration

8

by the investigation must show “a conspiracy to cover up the alleged fraud” by the investigators

9

(Mot. at 6) is nonsense. The continued employment by LDK of all the officers, directors and

10

contractors who participated in the investigation was ultimately in the hands of Defendant Peng,

11

LDK’s Chief Executive Officer and majority stockholder. Even absent a conspiracy, it is a

12

reasonable inference that such individuals were unlikely to vigorously pursue allegations of

13

wrongdoing by Peng and his lieutenants.

14

Similar reasoning applies to Defendants’ insistence that they are exonerated by a “clean”

15

opinion from LDK’s outside auditor. Even assuming it is appropriate to consider such opinions

16

on a motion to dismiss, and even if, in the post-Enron world, the accuracy of an auditor’s opinion

17

should be assumed, the opinion at issue is simply irrelevant. As the Court explained, the

18

allegedly false quarterly financial statements at the heart of the Complaint were not publicly

19

approved by the auditors. (Order at 16) (audit opinion did not “exonerate LDK…. [because] [i]t

20

did not specifically discuss the time periods at issue; it discussed year-end results”).

21

Defendants’ insistence that “KPMG’s year-end audit necessarily comprises the sum of the

22

previous four quarters, so any shortfall in one quarter would show up in the year-end audit” (Mot.

23

at 9) is wrong as a matter of mathematics. A “shortfall” in one quarter would not necessarily

Defendants asserted in briefing their motion to dismiss that “Mr. Peng—a member of the
Audit Committee—was not a member of the Special Committee to ensure its independence,” but
they cite no authority for this assertion or for the existence of the supposed Special Committee
itself. (Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 6. n.6, Apr. 7, 2008.) Aside from unsourced statements in
Defendants’ briefs, Plaintiff is unaware of any evidence, on or off the record, that an independent
Special Committee was ever established or that Peng recused himself from participating in it.

show up in the 2007 audited financial statements if the results of another quarter were

2

manipulated so as to produce full year numbers acceptable to the auditors. That is exactly what

3

the Complaint alleges—that Defendants added a new and highly unusual line item in the fourth

4

quarter for “[i]nventories to be processed beyond one year” so that LDK’s year end financials

5

would be acceptable to its auditors. (Compl. ¶ 57.)

6

Furthermore, KPMG determined that LDK had serious internal control problems in 2006.

7

(Order at 3.) Defendants are correct that this does not necessarily “mean that [LDK’s] financials

8

are incorrect” for 2007 (Mot. at 8), but the lack of internal controls in 2006 at least supports an

9

inference that Situ’s claims of serious internal control problems in 2007 are accurate, especially

10

since KPMG was silent on the adequacy of internal controls in 2007.

11

3. The Court Did Not Manifestly Fail To Consider Defendants’ Argument That
The Absence Of Insider Trading Exonerates Them

12

The Court did not “disregard[] the clear exculpatory inference that arises from the absence
13
of any suspicious trades or other tangible benefits to Defendants.” (Mot. at 10.) It considered
14
Defendants’ arguments and rejected them. (Order at 18 n.6.)
15
The Court concluded that Defendants did have a motive to commit fraud—the artificial
16
inflation of LDK’s stock price caused by Defendants’ false statements enriched Defendants by
17
billions of dollars. Id. Defendants do not explain why the Court was wrong when it determined
18
that the possibility of enrichment by billions of dollars is a “personal benefit[]” that constituted a
19
motive to commit fraud. (Mot. at 10) (insisting, without explanation, that the Complaint fails to
20
allege Defendants received “personal benefits” from their scheme). Moreover, Defendants do not
21
dispute the Court’s finding that, in addition to the individual Defendants’ motivation of personal
22
enrichment, there was a corporate motive to mislead investors—“[a]s a relative newcomer in need
23
of additional funds, LDK had the motivation to attract investors with strong financial statements.”
24
(Order at 18.)
25
Defendants’ insistence that, having been bared by a lockup agreement from selling any of
26
their stock during the Class Period, their failure to sell stock somehow exonerates them is
27
ridiculous. The possibility that the underwriters of LDK’s IPO could have waived the lockup

1

provision is irrelevant—they did not do so. (Mot. at 10-11.) Since the prospect of large blocks of

2

insider-owned stock being dumped on the market would have depressed LDK’s share price, it is

3

unlikely that the underwriters would waived the lockup provision had they been asked to do so.

4

More fundamentally, Tellabs held that a securities fraud claim can survive in “the

5

absence” of any motive allegations whatsoever. Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2511. Defendants mis-cite

6

cases to suggest that the law is to the contrary. They repeat their insistence that In re Pixar

7

Securities Litigation, 450 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (N.D. Cal. 2006), a pre-Tellabs case, supports the

8

proposition that this case should be dismissed because of the lack of insider trading (Mot. at 10)

9

even though, as the Court explained, Pixar actually supports the proposition that “it is

10

unnecessary for defendants to engage in insider trading or to sell LDK stock to establish

11

scienter.” Order at 18 n.6. Defendants also complain that the Court ignored “the dispositive

12

holding” in Osher v. JNI Corp., 256 F. Supp. 2d 1144 (S.D. Cal. 2003), which they imply holds

13

that lockup agreements are irrelevant when looking at a defendant’s stock sales. (Mot. at 11.) In

14

fact, Osher says the opposite. According to Osher, a “factor meriting consideration” when

15

reviewing stock sales, “is whether the insider had any limitations on his or her ability to trade.”

16

256 F. Supp. 2d at 1163 (citing No. 84 Employer-Teamster Joint Council Pension Trust Fund v.

17

Am. West Holding Corp., 320 F.3d 920, 938) (9th Cir. 2003)). The Osher court concluded,

18

however, that the lockup agreement was irrelevant under the facts in that case because it did not

19

restrict stock sales during the period at issue. 256 F. Supp. 2d at 1165. Here, there is no dispute

20

that the lockup restricted sales by LDK insiders during the Class Period.

21

4. The Court Did Not Manifestly Fail To Consider Defendants’ Argument That
The Complaint Is Based On Unreliable Sources

22

Again repeating what they said in their motion to dismiss, Defendants attempt to portray
23
the Complaint as relying almost entirely on facts provided by Charley Situ, who they insist did
24
not have “personal knowledge” of the facts attributed to him. As the Court recognized,
25
Defendants are wrong.
26
There is no support in the Court’s Order for Defendants’ contention that the Court held
27
that Situ had no relevant personal knowledge and then, despite this lack of knowledge,

improperly credited his information. The Court’s assertion that “‘[f]or pleading purposes, it is not

2

necessary that the source have personal firsthand knowledge in a strict evidentiary sense,’” (Mot.

3

at 22) (quoting Order at 12), is an apparent recognition of the well-established principle that

4

securities plaintiffs need not produce “evidence” at the pleading state that would meet the strict

5

criteria for admissibility at trial. See In re Connetics Corp. Secs. Litig., 542 F. Supp. 2d 996,

6

1004 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (“pleadings need not contain admissible evidence”). Not only is this

7

sentence not a finding by the Court that Situ lacked personal knowledge, the Court specifically

8

held that it could be reasonably inferred that Situ did have “personal knowledge of the alleged

9

falsity” of Defendants’ statements. Order at 12 (emphasis added).

10

Berson supports the Court’s reasoning. In that case the Ninth Circuit rejected the

11

defendants’ insistence that confidential sources cited in the complaint should be ignored because

12

they lacked personal knowledge of key facts. Berson, 2008 WL 2278670 at *2. The Court of

13

Appeals explained that the sources cited in the complaint were sufficiently reliable because “[i]t’s

14

entirely plausible” the sources “would know, or could reasonably deduce” the relevant facts and

15

that this was sufficient for pleading purposes. Id. (emphasis added). Even setting aside Situ’s

16

obvious extensive first-hand personal knowledge of Defendants’ wrongdoing, it appears

17

nonsensical to assert that, as LDK’s financial controller, Situ was not in a position to “reasonably

18

deduce” the relevant facts.

19

Defendants also say that it is improper for the Complaint to cite to a report in Barron’s, a

20

respected periodical focused on business and finance, which says that a source confirmed key

21

allegations made by Situ. In fact, the case they cite, Connetics, 542 F. Supp. 2d 996, is to the

22

contrary. According to Connetics, in drafting a securities fraud complaint, “an attorney may rely

23

in part on other sources, such as a newspaper article.” Id. at 1005 (emphasis added). The

24

court’s concern in Connetics was that the plaintiffs there relied only on public documents and had

25

apparently conducted no investigation whatsoever into the claims asserted in the complaint. That

26

is not the case here.

5. The Court Did Not Manifestly Fail To Consider Defendants’ Argument That
They Were Not On Notice About Inventory Irregularities

2
3

Document 97

Defendants’ suggestion that nothing in the Complaint gives rise to a strong inference that
they should have known of serious inventory irregularities prior to September 2007 (Mot. at 13)
is false. As the Court explained,

5

12

Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendants knew
there were inventory and accounting discrepancies prior to [LDK’s]
IPO. In February 2007, LDK’s lead auditor KPMG had raised
concerns about the “inadequate” inventory accounting and
“significant deficiency” in LDK’s internal controls…. Situ first
raised his concerns about LDK’s accounting in an email sent to
CFO Lai on May 29, 2007, two days before the IPO. “In his email
Situ told Lai that the Company’s financial and operational sides
were using different sources and methods to calculate inventory and
output and that it was impossible to verify which figures were
accurate. Subsequently, in a June 27 email to CFO Lai Situ
expressed concern that, with respect to LDK’s finances, ‘[t]he
actual story is quite different from what the investors expect or are
told.’”

13

(Order at 19) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). On July 19, 2007 Situ told LDK’s controller

14

that “among the LDK feedstock only a small percentage is good stock. According to US GAAP

15

(ARB 43 Ch. 4; APB 28, etc.), the management should make provision [take a write-off] in this

16

regard.” Id. at 21. Moreover, in Berson the Ninth Circuit held that, on a motion to dismiss in a

17

securities case, it is proper to “infer” that officers “directly responsible for” a company’s “day-to-

18

day operations” know the key facts related to these operations, even in cases, unlike this case,

19

where “plaintiffs allege no particular facts,” other than the officers’ positions, to show that the

20

officers had actual knowledge of these facts. 2008 WL 2278670 at *4.

specious. It is entirely plausible that Situ expressed concerns about more than one issue on May

The Court Was Not Required To Rule On The Allegations Against The
Unserved Defendants

Defendants assert that the Court had the power to dismiss claims against the non-moving,

Court lacked discretion to defer consideration of any motion to dismiss on behalf of these
defendants or that the Court improperly exercised this discretion.

Contrary to Defendants’ suggestion that the Court overlooked an important issue, it is
hardly surprising that the Court’s Order does not discuss Defendants’ argument that “the October
4, 2007 press release is not actionable because the information had already been made widely
available to the market as of October 3, 2007” (Mot. at 19)—Defendants’ initial memorandum in
support of their motion to dismiss did not make this argument or even mention the October 4
press release.2 Defendants do not, and could not, assert that their failure to raise this argument
should be excused under the Local Rule on reconsideration because they “did not know” of the
relevant facts or law when they filed their motion to dismiss. Civil L.R. 7-9(b)(1).

The October 4, 2007 Press Release Is An Actionable False Statement

In any event, the October 3, 2007 disclosure that Situ had resigned was only a partial and
limited disclosure of Defendants’ fraud. LDK’s stock price dropped when this news became
public, but, because the October 3 report did not quantify any accounting irregularities, and
conveyed LDK’s assurance that nothing improper had occurred, the value of LDK’s stock still
remained substantially inflated. (Compl. ¶¶ 78-81.) LDK’s October 4, 2007 press release sought
to maintain the artificial inflation in the price of LDK’s stock by falsely asserting that there were
no material accounting irregularities at the Company and that Situ’s allegations were “without
merit.” (Order at 7.) The market did not receive relatively clear information on the nature and
extent of LDK’s problems until October 8, when a Barron’s article described Situ’s allegations in
detail and reported that LDK “may have overstated its inventory by up to $92 million.” (Order at

DEFENDANTS’ REQUEST FOR CERTIFICATION OF AN INTERLOCUTORY
APPEAL SHOULD BE REJECTED
Defendants have no reasonable basis for their request that the Court certify several issues

for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).

8

A.

9

Section 1292(b) is a narrow exception to the firmly established rule that only final

Section 1292(b) Certification Is Meant For Exceptional Circumstances

10

judgments can be appealed. The final judgment rule is not a mere technicality, but was

11

established by Congress to “avoid[] the obstruction to just claims that would come from

12

permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to

13

which a litigation may give rise, from its initiation to entry of judgment.” Coopers and Lybrand

14

v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 n.8 (1978) (quoting Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 325

15

(1940)). Consequently, “[r]outine resort to § 1292(b) requests would hardly comport with

16

Congress’ design to reserve interlocutory review for ‘exceptional’ cases while generally retaining

17

for the federal courts a firm final judgment rule.” Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis , 519 U.S. 61, 74

18

(1996); see also James v. Price Stern Sloan, Inc., 283 F.3d 1064, 1068 n.6 (9th Cir. 2002)

19

(“Section 1292(b) is a departure from the normal rule that only final judgments are appealable,

20

and therefore must be construed narrowly.”); Taylor v. City of Oakland, No. C 06-05169 WHA,

21

2007 WL 3287843 at *1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2007). (“Interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C.

22

1292(b) is an extraordinary remedy”). Certification is especially inappropriate in cases, like this

23

one, where the challenged rulings largely involve the “‘application of facts to the law,” rather

24

than clear issues of law. Clanahan v. McFarland Unified School Dist., No. CV F 05-0796, 2007

25

WL 2428089 at *2 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2007).

26

Section 1292(b) allows a district court to certify an interlocutory order for appeal if it

27

believes “that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial

28

ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially

advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). If the district court so

2

certifies the appropriate circuit court has the option of hearing the appeal. § 1292(c). The Ninth

3

Circuit has suggested that, in limiting such appeals to “controlling question[s] of law,” Congress

4

indicated that § 1292(b) appeals should deal with “fundamental” issues, such as “the

5

determination of who are necessary and proper parties, whether a court to which a cause has been

6

transferred has jurisdiction, or whether state or federal law should be applied.” In re Cement

7

Antitrust Litig., 673 F.2d 1020, 1026-27 (9th Cir. 1982) (quoting United States v. Woodbury, 263

8

F.2d 784, 787 (9th Cir. 1959)).

9

B.

10

Defendants Identify No Exceptional Circumstances Meriting § 1292(b)
Certification

A review of the specific issues which Defendants say should be certified for appeal
11
highlights the absence of any basis for Defendants’ certification request.
12
Defendants say that the Ninth Circuit should review the “[t]he Court’s determination that
13
for pleading purposes, a source need not ‘have personal first hand knowledge’” of alleged
14
wrongdoing. (Mot at 22.) But, as discussed above, Situ did have personal knowledge.
15
Moreover, as also noted above, the Court of Appeals has just addressed the issue in Berson, 2008
16
WL 2278670, concluding that it is sufficient that a source be in a position to “reasonably deduce”
17
relevant information. Id. at *2
18
Similarly, even Defendants’ own cases do not support their contention that it was
19
improper for the court to consider the findings of an investigation by a financial journalist as
20
contributing, along with the wide array of other facts cited in the Complaint, to the inference of
21
scienter. And even if the challenged Barron’s article is ignored, there remains abundant indicia of
22
Defendants’ intentional wrongdoing. This is not the type of exceptional, “controlling” legal issue
23
that merits interlocutory review.
24
Defendants’ assertion that the Court’s refusal to dismiss the Complaint against the
25
unserved defendants merits review is particularly wrong-headed. Not only do Defendants fail to
26
cite a single case that suggests the Court lacks the discretion to postpone consideration of a
27
motion to dismiss until the affected party has been served, but certifying this issue will do nothing

to speed this case. Plaintiff will soon serve each unserved defendant through LDK’s U.S. office,

2

pursuant to the Court’s June 12, 2008 Order authorizing such service. Each currently unserved

3

Defendant will then be able, should they so desire, to file a motion to dismiss, regardless of any

4

decision taken by the Ninth Circuit on the issue.

5

Defendants’ claim that the Court’s interpretation of the “safe harbor” provision of the

6

PSLRA merits interlocutory review can be rapidly disposed of. Defendants have never claimed

7

that all of their allegedly false statements are forward looking. Presumably even Defendants here

8

are unwilling to argue that their statements about LDK’s current inventories, statements that are at

9

the heart of Plaintiff’s case, should somehow be viewed as predictions of the future. Berson,

10

2008 WL 2278670 at *6 (“descriptions of the present aren’t forward-looking”). Consequently,

11

review of this issue by the Ninth Circuit would do little to move this case forward. Moreover,

12

Defendants acknowledge that the Ninth Circuit provided guidance on this very issue in America

13

West, and that the Court’s ruling here is consistent with that guidance. (Mot. at 24.) Their

14

complaint is that “many other courts have [supposedly] refused to follow America West,” and that

15

this Court should have done the same. (Mot. at 24.) Defendants do not explain why there are

16

“substantial ground for difference of opinion” on an issue with which the Court of Appeals has

17

already dealt.

18

C.

19

There is little reason to believe that an immediate appeal would “materially advance the

An Interlocutory Appeal Is Unlikely To Save Time Or Money

20

ultimate termination of the litigation.” Defendants argue that, if the Ninth Circuit orders the case

21

dismissed “with prejudice,” this litigation will be over. (Mot. at 25.) But it is unlikely that the

22

Court of Appeals would reverse with prejudice. Lead Plaintiff has never amended his

23

Consolidated Complaint and the Ninth Circuit has emphasized that in complex securities cases

24

leave to replead must be granted unless amendment is clearly futile. Eminence Capital, LLC v.

25

Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (“especially … in the context of the PSLRA,”

26

“[d]ismissal with prejudice and without leave to amend is not appropriate unless it is clear … that

the complaint could not be saved by amendment”).
