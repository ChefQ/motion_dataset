_ DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Defendants Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America") and Roderick Wilson ("Wilson")
(collectively, "Defendants"), respectfully submit this response to Plaintiffs Motion for Extension of
Time to File Response In Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and state as
follows:

1, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment was timely filed on December 14, 2012.
(Docket Nos. 30-32.) Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(e), Plaintiff had 21 days, or until January 4, 2013,
to file her response.

2. Nonetheless, Plaintiff waited until 11:59 pm on January 7, 2013 to file the instant
motion for extension of time, and failed to confer with Defendants' counsel before filing the instant
motion. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), when as here a party makes a motion for an
extension of time to act after the time has expired, the court may extend the time for good cause and
only if the failure to act was because of excusable neglect. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(B).. Plaintiff's
motion neither discusses this standard nor attempts to justify her failure to confer with counsel or file

the motion before the January 4 deadline expired.

3. This is Plaintiff's second untimely request for an extension of the dispositive motions
briefing deadlines. (Docket Nos. 33-34.)

4, It is within the Court's discretion to grant or deny Plaintiff's untimely request for an
extension of time. Ifthe Court grants the motion, Defendants respectfully request that it also extend
Defendants' time to file its reply by one-week to twenty-one days as Defendants' response to
Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is due in the interim.

Respectfully submitted,
