state as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION
Defendants seek a partial and narrow stay of discovery because two paragraphs of

allegations concerning mutual fund market timing — added in the most recent version of
Plaintiffs’ complaint — overlap with the Market Timing Multidistrict Litigation pending in the
United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In re Mutual Funds Investment
Litigation, MDL No. 1586 (D. Md.). The Market Timing MDL consists in part of dozens of
lawsuits that allege market timing in mutual funds advised by Bank of America affiliates,
including a case against the fiduciaries of the Bank of America 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) brought
under ERISA. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) expressly held that
creation of the MDL-1586 was necessary “to avoid duplication of discovery, prevent inconsistent
or repetitive pretrial rulings, and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the
judiciary.” See Order of Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation regarding Docket Nos. 1576,
1577, 1582, 1585, 1586, 1590 & 1591, entered February 20, 2004, attached to the Declaration Of
Shannon M. Barrett In Support Of Defendants’ Motion To Stay Discovery As To Allegations Of
Market Timing Involving Bank Of America And Its Affiliated Mutual Funds (the “Barrett
Decl.”) as Exhibit 1 (“Consolidation Order”) at 3.

Moreover, after years of litigation, the relevant parties in the Market Timing MDL have
entered into a comprehensive settlement of the securities and ERISA actions involving Bank of
America-affiliated funds relating to market timing, including any such claims that may be
asserted in this action. The parties expect that those settlements will be submitted to the MDL
Court for preliminary approval this summer.
Notwithstanding the language in the Consolidation Order and the pending settlement in
the Market Timing MDL, plaintiffs in this case now seek to move forward here with discovery
into market timing issues. Since the Market Timing MDL is already overseeing litigation of
market timing claims, including a case against the fiduciaries of the Bank of America 401(k)
Plan (the “Plan”) brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), discovery relating to mutual fund market timing should be stayed in this
case.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

Market Timing Litigation.

On September 3, 2003 the New York Attorney General (“NYAG”) commenced an
enforcement action against Canary Capital Partners LLC (“Canary”), a New Jersey hedge fund,
alleging that Canary had engaged in schemes involving market timing and related activities in
various mutual funds, including the Nations Funds (the “Funds”), a family of proprietary mutual
funds advised by Bank of America affiliates.1 On February 9, 2005, after an investigation by the

1

In April 2004, Bank of America merged with FleetBoston Financial Corp. (“Fleet”), which operated a
family of mutual funds known as the Columbia Funds. Prior to the merger, the Columbia Funds were themselves
the subject of a regulatory settlement involving the SEC and the NYAG’s office concerning market timing
allegations. In June 2004, the Nations Funds were renamed as Columbia Funds and, shortly thereafter, the Plan
became an investor in the Columbia Funds. However, the Plan was not an investor in the Columbia Funds until
after the regulatory settlement and so did not hold shares in the Columbia Funds during the period in which market
timing was alleged to have occurred.

NYAG and the SEC, Bank of America reached a settlement with the regulators resolving the
market timing claims. See In the Matter of Banc of America Capital Management, LLC, (“In re
Banc of America”) Order Instituting Administrative & Cease-and-Desist Proceedings,
Administrative Proceedings File No. 3-11818, Exchange Act Release No. 33-8538 (Feb. 9, 2005)
(“SEC Release No. 33-8538”), available at http://sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8538.htm.
As part of the regulatory settlement, Bank of America respondents paid $375 million,
which amount was to be distributed by an Independent Distribution Consultant (“IDC”)
according to a plan of allocation to be approved by the SEC. Id. The regulatory settlement has
provided Nations Funds shareholders with more than full compensation. In apportioning the
distribution, the IDC directed that approximately $89.7 million be paid to the affected Nations
Funds shareholders, an amount that was approximately $70 million more than the dilution and
other impacts caused by the alleged market timing (as calculated by the IDC). See In re Banc of
America, Notice of Proposed Distribution Plan and Opportunity For Comment, Administrative
Proceedings File No. 3-11818, Exchange Act Release No. 34-56077 (July 16, 2007), available at
http://sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-56077.htm. The IDC’s distribution plan was approved by the
SEC on December 27, 2007, and the distribution to the Funds’ shareholders pursuant to that plan
is in process. See In re Banc of America, Order Approving the Distribution Plan, Administrative
Proceedings File No. 3-11818, Exchange Act Release No. 34-57048 (Dec. 27, 2007), available
at http://sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-57048.pdf.
B.

Creation of Market Timing MDL.

In the months following the announcement of the NYAG’s enforcement action, but
before Bank of America settled the regulators’ actions, mutual fund investors commenced
hundreds of shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits relating to alleged market timing

4
Case 3:07-cv-00011-RJC-DLH Document 128

Filed 06/16/09 Page 4 of 13

against dozens of entities, including Bank of America and numerous other mutual fund advisers.
Parties to these cases moved to consolidate them in an MDL that would handle the market timing
litigation in a uniform and consistent fashion. On February 20, 2004, the MDL Panel issued an
order transferring the market timing actions to the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, and centralizing the actions onto a single MDL docket, MDL-1586. See
Consolidation Order. In its order, the JPML explained that centralization of the actions on a
single MDL docket would “serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the
just and efficient conduct of this litigation.” Id. at 3. The Panel added that “congregating these
market timing/late trading actions [ ] is necessary in order to avoid duplication of discovery,
prevent inconsistent or repetitive pretrial rulings, and conserve the resources of the parties, their
counsel and the judiciary.” Id. The Market Timing MDL contains 17 sub-tracks, each relating
to a different mutual fund family.
The Bank of America sub-track includes various securities class actions as well as an
ERISA class action, McKoy v. Bank of America Corporation, et al., No. 1:04-cv-00867 (D. Md.
filed Apr. 6, 2004) (“McKoy”), filed by participants in the Plan against the Bank and other
alleged Plan participants. See In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation, MDL No. 1586. As in
the current action, the McKoy complaint alleges that the Bank and certain individual defendants
breached ERISA fiduciary duties under and engaged in prohibited transactions by causing the
Plan to invest in the Funds when it was imprudent or otherwise inappropriate to do so.2

C.

Proposed Settlement of Market Timing MDL.

On December 15, 2005, the parties in the Market Timing MDL entered into a
comprehensive settlement of the securities and ERISA actions involving the Funds and a copy of
the settlement stipulation was submitted to the Market Timing MDL court. Due to the costs and
complexities of providing notice to the settlement classes, as well as the presence of so-called
“cross-track” broker and trader defendants who are named in multiple sub-tracks, the settlements
in the Market Timing MDL have not yet been presented for court approval. Recently, however,
a sufficient number of settlements were reached, allowing the court and the parties to move
forward with the formal approval process. As such, the Market Timing MDL court has set
deadlines for the execution of settlement agreements in the various sub-tracks in which
settlements have been or appear likely to be reached, with the goal of submitting all preliminary
approval papers in summer 2009. If the Funds settlement is approved by the court, all claims
relating to or arising out of market timing in the Funds—including all potential ERISA claims—
will be resolved.
D.

Market Timing Allegations in the Present Action.

Market timing allegations were not part of Plaintiffs’ original or first amended complaints
in this action, which centered on allegations that the Bank and its Corporate Benefits Committee
breached ERISA fiduciary duties to Bank of America 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) and its
participants by causing the Plan to incur unreasonable expenses, principally through the decision

On June 11, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene in the McKoy litigation. See Elena M. David,
Arlene J. Stach, And Victor M. Hernandez's Motion to Intervene Pursuant To Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, In Re Mutual
Funds Investment Litigation, MDL No. 1586 [Dkt. No. 1212].

to offer Bank-affiliated mutual funds (the “Funds”) as plan investment options. See Complaint,
[Dkt. No. 1] (filed Aug. 7, 2006); and First Amended Complaint, [Dkt. No. 6] (filed Oct. 16,
2006). Rather, Plaintiffs first introduced market timing allegations through their Second
Amended Complaint, filed on July 31, 2007. In that version of their Complaint, Plaintiffs
included two new paragraphs alleging that Defendants had caused the Plan to invest in the Funds
when they knew that market timing was taking place, and that as a result, the Plan had invested
in the Funds on less favorable conditions than Canary. See SAC ¶¶ 56-57. No other part of
Plaintiffs’ complaint was altered to reflect the addition of those allegations.
On March 5, 2009, Plaintiffs served Defendants their First Request for Production of
Documents. Among the 36 numbered requests4 in that document was a request for:
All Documents that relate to the allegations of market timing, and the activities
that are the basis of those allegations, discussed in paragraphs 56 and 57 of the
SAC, including, without limitation, all documents relating to defendant Alvaro de
Molina’s involvement in the challenged activities.
See Request No. 25, Plaintiffs’ First Request for Production of Documents to All Defendants at
11, attached to the Barrett Decl. as Exhibit 3. Defendants timely served their objections and
responses to Plaintiffs’ requests, and subject to those objections, have begun the process of
collecting and reviewing responsive documents that are relevant to the parties’ claims and
defenses. As part of their response, Defendants objected to Plaintiffs’ request concerning market
timing allegations as overly broad and unduly burdensome and notified Plaintiffs of their intent
to file the instant Motion. Defendants’ Objections to Plaintiffs’ First Request for Production of
Documents, at 24–25, attached to the Barrett Decl. as Exhibit 4. In addition, pursuant to JPML

4

Plaintiffs’ request for production of documents served on March 5, 2009 included two requests numbered
“32,” which were referred to as 32 and 32[A], respectively, in Defendants’ responses and objections to the requests.
Thus, although the final request is numbered 35, there are 36 total requests.

5.5
III.

Argument
A. The Court Should Stay Discovery as to Market Timing Pending Resolution of
the Market Timing MDL Settlement.
As the Fourth Circuit has stated, there is “the power inherent in every court to control the

disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and
for litigants.” Amdur v. Lizars, 372 F.2d 103, 106 (4th Cir. 1967) (quoting Landis v. N. Am. Co.,
299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936)), see also Blinder, Robinson & Co., Inc. v. SEC, 692 F.2d 102, 106
(10th Cir. 1982) (“a court may, in its discretion, defer or abate proceedings where another suit,
involving the identical issues, is pending either in federal or state court, and it would be
duplicative, uneconomical and vexatious to proceed.”). A stay of discovery as to market timing
pending the outcome of the Market Timing MDL settlement is an appropriate exercise of the
Court’s power.
As an initial matter, even ignoring the pending settlement, a stay of discovery into market
timing issues would be warranted given the stated purposes of the Market Timing MDL. The
JPML clearly explained in its Consolidation Order that the Market Timing MDL was intended
“to avoid duplication of discovery, prevent inconsistent or repetitive pretrial rulings, and
conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the judiciary.” Consolidation Order at 3.

5

Defendants have moved this Court for a stay of discovery with respect to the market timing allegations
rather than seeking transfer of the case to the Market Timing MDL at this time (but without prejudice to Bank of
America’s right to move the JPML to transfer this case to the Market Timing MDL at some point). Defendants
believe that moving for a stay here would be a more efficient way of dealing with the overlap that Plaintiffs have
injected, given that the core claims and issues in this case are entirely unrelated to market timing, that this case is

8
Case 3:07-cv-00011-RJC-DLH Document 128

Filed 06/16/09 Page 8 of 13

This intent would obviously be undermined if Plaintiffs here were allowed to engage in wholly
separate discovery process in a separate court into the very topic that is the sole focus of the
Market Timing MDL. As written, Plaintiffs’ single request would impose a tremendous burden
on Defendants, requiring the Bank to cull vast amounts of documents from departments and
affiliates of the Bank that have no involvement in the ERISA fiduciary functions challenged in
this case. This is particularly so given that the Market Timing MDL already contains an earlierfiled ERISA action, McKoy, which asserts claims virtually identical to those Plaintiffs have
sought to add through their Second Amended Complaint. In both this action and McKoy, the
plaintiffs purport to sue the Bank and other alleged fiduciaries on behalf of participants in the
Plan for alleged losses to the Plan resulting from the defendants’ decisions to include the Funds
as Plan investment options when they knew or should have known that it was improper to do so.
Compare McKoy Complaint ¶¶ 47–56, 74–76, 82 with SAC ¶¶ 1, 11, 56. Indeed, to the extent
Plaintiffs’ claims are based on alleged market timing in the Funds, those claims are
indistinguishable from the claims asserted in McKoy. This alone provides sufficient reason to
stay proceedings in the current case to the extent that they relate to market timing—even absent
the existence of the Market Timing MDL settlement. See Int'l Nickel Co. v. Martin Barry, Inc.,
204 F.2d 583, 586 (4th Cir. 1953) (affirming stay of litigation in favor of earlier-filed suit on
grounds that “the plaintiff was not entitled as a matter of right to have two federal courts trying
the same issue at the same time when court dockets are crowded and other litigants have right to
a hearing.”).

still in the discovery stage, and that the Market Timing MDL court is now handling a complex, multi-track
settlement process.

Case 3:07-cv-00011-RJC-DLH Document 128

Filed 06/16/09 Page 9 of 13

The existence of the Market Timing MDL settlement makes the importance of a stay all
the more acute. The settlement raises the real prospect—indeed likelihood—that discovery into
market timing will in the very near future prove to be a complete waste of resources. If
approved, the settlement will release the Bank of America defendants from any and all claims by
the Plan and its participants relating to market timing involving the Funds. Thus, anything
Plaintiffs learn regarding alleged market timing would be inconsequential to their claims.
Simply put, it makes no sense to require Defendants to begin incurring the burden and expense
of collecting and producing documents relevant to theories that Plaintiffs will, in all likelihood,
be foreclosed from asserting within a few short months.
Against this backdrop, the relief that Defendants seek through their current Motion is
modest. Defendants do not seek a stay of all discovery but instead seek a stay solely as to the
issue that overlaps completely with the Market Timing MDL. As noted above, such a stay would
not affect the bulk of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests nor would it implicate any of the theories that
were the basis of Plaintiffs’ original claims. Indeed, in seeking to intervene in the McKoy action,
Plaintiffs here have represented “that the complaint in the [David action] does not assert claims
based upon late trading or market timing in the [Funds] . . . . Brief in Support of Elena M.
David, Arlene J. Stach, And Victor M. Hernandez's Motion to Intervene Pursuant To Fed. R.
Civ. P. 24, In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation, MDL No. 1586, at 3 [Dkt. No. 1212],
attached to the Barrett Decl. as Exhibit 6.6 Further, Defendants do not at this time request a
permanent bar on discovery into the market timing issue. Rather, Defendants seek only a

6

It is also worth noting that, as the result of the governmental enforcement actions and settlement described
above, a significant amount of material regarding the allegations of market timing already exists in the public
domain, including a lengthy administrative order issued by the SEC detailing the Commission’s findings
surrounding the Bank of America affiliates’ involvement in the matter. See In re Banc of America, SEC Release No.

temporary stay until the Market Timing MDL court has had an opportunity to rule on the
pending settlement. At that time, this Court will be well-positioned to determine whether
discovery into market timing allegations can serve a legitimate purpose in this litigation.
Accordingly, Defendants respectfully request that, in the interest of judicial economy, the
Court stay discovery into alleged market timing involving the Funds pending the final resolution
of the settlement previously submitted to the Market Timing MDL court.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that this Court stay discovery

on the issue of market timing pending the resolution of the Market Timing MDL in the District
of Maryland.

33-8538. Thus, a brief stay of formal discovery on the issue of market-timing would not even prevent plaintiffs
from immediately accessing a substantial amount of information on that topic.
