UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
Richmond Division
TYRONE HENDERSON,
Plaintiff,
v.

CIVIL ACTION NO: 3:12cv97-REP

CORELOGIC, INC., et al.,
Defendants.
MOTION FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE DISCOVERY PERIOD
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, by counsel, and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) moves the
Court to for an extension of the discovery period by 60 days. Pursuant to the Court’s Order of
June 20, 2013, the discovery cut-off is currently set for Friday, August 30, 2013, which time has
not yet expired. The parties have been engaged in a meaningful and substantial meet and confer
process concerning the discovery in this matter, and as of the date of this filing, the meet and
confer process had not been completed. The parties agreed that the Plaintiff should file a motion
to extend the discovery cutoff, but that the Defendant could not provide its consent by the time
the motion should be filed.
The court entered an agreed Phase I Discovery Order on June 20, 2013. Among the acts
required of the parties pursuant to the Order, the Defendant was to (1) provide the Plaintiff with a
list of its customers within the Fourth Circuit; and (2) provide the Plaintiff with a mirror image
of its results returned database. The Defendant complied with the court’s order, producing its
customer list in late July. However, it was only able to produce the database on August 5, 2013,
with less than four weeks prior to the discovery cut-off.
The parties continue to meet and confer. Within seven days of this motion, the parties

will submit a proposed agreed scheduling order or, if an agreement by compromise cannot be
reached at that time, the Plaintiff will file formal briefing requesting the court enter a revised
scheduling order.
This motion is made in good faith and for good cause shown. It is not made for a dilatory
or improper purpose.

By granting this motion, the interests of justice will be served.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the motion to extend the
discovery cut-off by 60 days.
Respectfully submitted,
TYRONE HENDERSON,
