UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
Richmond Division
TYRONE HENDERSON, et al.
Plaintiffs,
v.

Civil Action No. 3:12cv97 (REP)

CORELOGIC, INC., et al.
Defendants.
DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF THE DISCOVERY PERIOD
Defendants, CoreLogic, Inc. and CoreLogic National Background Data, LLC
(collectively, “Defendants”), by counsel, hereby submit this response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Extension of the Discovery Period.
On August 29, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Extension of the Discovery Period,
seeking an additional sixty days to conduct discovery. In that motion, Plaintiffs noted that the
parties were meeting and conferring about Plaintiffs’ request.
Over the past week, the parties have continued their meet and confer efforts in good faith,
which remain ongoing. Due to the ongoing nature of that process, Plaintiffs’ counsel requested
that Defendants respond to their motion, both noting the continuing nature of those discussions
and requesting that the parties be allowed until September 16, 2013 to complete their
discussions, at which time Plaintiffs will update the Court as to the outcome of the parties’
discussions, as set forth in the Motion for Extension of the Discovery Period.
