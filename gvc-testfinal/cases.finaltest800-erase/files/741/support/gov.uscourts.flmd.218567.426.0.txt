DEFENDANT THE OHIO WILLOW WOOD COMPANY’S
MOTION FOR RELIEF OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO
RULE 60(b)
The Ohio Willow Wood Company (“OWW”) brings this motion to vacate judgment for
lack of standing based upon recently discovered assignments to Applied Elastomerics, Inc.
(“AEI”) of United States Patent No. 6,552,109 (“the ’109 Patent”).

The ’109 Patent was

purportedly licensed to Alps South, LLC by AEI in 2008. The problem is this assignment was
approximately three years before Mr. John Chen, the named inventor of the ’109 Patent, actually
assigned the ’109 Patent to AEI. This evidence has not heretofore been presented to the Court by
either party and only recently became known to OWW. This evidence demonstrates that Alps
did not have standing at the time of filing and that it continues to lack standing. OWW is not, by
this motion, attempting to reopen prior decisions that resulted from earlier briefing or hearings.
Rather, OWW seeks relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) because the Order of Judgment of May 9,
2013 is void due to Alps’ lack of standing to sue OWW. As such, there could be no case or

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 2 of 21 PageID 13559

controversy between Alps and OWW, this Court lacked jurisdiction and relief from judgment
must be granted.
I.

Background
According to this Court’s prior determinations, Alps obtained standing by acquiring all

substantial rights in the ’109 Patent from AEI. (Dkt. Nos. 73, 272). This Court, OWW, and
Alps, were all apparently operating under the premise that AEI had rights of title in the ’109
Patent such that AEI could grant rights to Alps. (See for example the Complaint and Amended
Complaints filed in this case in which Alps asserts that AEI was the owner of the ’109 Patent.
On August 31, 2008, AEI purported to convey to Alps a limited field of use license in the ’109
Patent, as memorialized in the 2008 Patent Sale and License Agreement (“Agreement”). (Dkt.
No. 31-2) Alps filed suit against OWW on September 23, 2008. OWW subsequently moved to
dismiss the litigation for lack of standing on October 28, 2009. Alps executed an amended
Agreement nunc pro tunc (Amended Patent Sale and License Agreement hereinafter “Amended
Agreement”) with AEI removing the field of use restriction and filed the Amended Agreement
with this Court on February 2, 2010. (Dkt. No. 59). On February 11, 2010, this Court found that
the 2008 Agreement provides Alps with “the substantial rights to proceed . . . .” (Dkt. No. 73, pg.
2, third full paragraph).
Thereafter, in its Order of April 29, 2012, this Court held, in response to Alps’ motion for
summary judgment regarding OWW’s standing affirmative defense, that:
…on the date this action was initiated Alps had constitutional
standing to bring the suit but lacked prudential standing. The
Court found, however, that the prudential standing defect was
sufficiently cured with Amended Patent and Sale License
Agreement [the Amended Agreement] entered into on January 28,
2010, between AEI and Alps.
(Dkt. No. 272, paragraph spanning pages 11-12).
2

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 3 of 21 PageID 13560

However, it has now been learned that it was not until September 27, 2011, almost three
years after commencement of this suit and well after execution of the Amended Agreement, that
John Y. Chen (“Mr. Chen”), the named inventor and original patentee of the ’109 Patent,
actually assigned his rights and ownership in the ’109 Patent to AEI. In the assignment of
September 27, 2011, Mr. Chen covenanted that the “rights, titles, and interests confirmed or
conveyed in this Assignment are unencumbered” (emphasis added) and made no mention of any
rights allegedly conveyed to Alps. (See Exhibit A, last paragraph, pg. 4). Then, oddly, the next
day, September 28, 2011, Mr. Chen executed a second, differently worded assignment to AEI of
the ’109 Patent. (See Exhibit B; Exhibits A and B are collectively referred to hereafter as the
“September 2011 Assignments”).
Notably, neither Alps, who, based upon the Court’s prior standing rulings was deemed
for all practical purposes to be the owner of the ’109 Patent, Mr. Chen, nor AEI ever told OWW
or this Court of the September 2011 Assignments. (Dkt. No. 73; 272) Indeed, OWW deposed
AEI, (Mr. Chen was the AEI deponent and AEI was represented at deposition by counsel for
Alps), in San Francisco on November 10, 2011. Prior to that deposition, on October 26, 2011,
OWW served upon AEI a subpoena asking for all documents referring or relating to the’109
Patent, already reissued from reexamination. Neither the September 2011 Assignments nor any
other assignment was provided by Mr. Chen or AEI in response to the subpoena. On the day of
the deposition, November 9/10, 2011, a search of the assignment database maintained at the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) would have been futile because it was
not until two weeks after the deposition and nearly eight weeks after execution that AEI recorded
the assignments. OWW was not informed of the September 2011 Assignments by Mr. Chen or
AEI. Inexplicably, Alps, who by September 2011 had already been found to be in essence the

3

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 4 of 21 PageID 13561

owner of the ’109 Patent and who had all responsibility to the ‘109 Patent at the patent office,
did not tell OWW, or this Court, of the September 2011 Assignments. OWW only became
aware of the September 2011 Assignments after this Court’s recent Order of Judgment of May 9,
2013.
II.

Law and Argument
A.

The Underlying Judgment Is Void Because This Court Lacks Jurisdiction

“[A] federal court must inquire sua sponte into the issue whenever it appears that
jurisdiction may be lacking” in an action. Morrison v. Allstate Indem. Co., 228 F.3d 1255, 1261
(11th Cir. 2000). As held by the Federal Circuit:
[a]s a general matter, parties should possess rights before seeking to have them
vindicated in court. Allowing a subsequent assignment to automatically cure a
standing defect would unjustifiably expand the number of people who are
statutorily authorized to sue. Parties could justify the premature initiation of an
action by averring to the court that their standing through assignment is imminent.
Permitting non-owners and licensees the right to sue, so long as they eventually
obtain the rights they seek to have redressed, would enmesh the judiciary in
abstract disputes, risk multiple litigation, and provide incentives for parties to
obtain assignments in order to expand their arsenal and the scope of litigation.
Inevitably, delay and expense would be the order of the day.
Gaia Techs. v. Reconversion Techs., 93 F.3d 774, 780 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

35 U.S.C. § 261; Sky Techs. LLC v. SAP AG, 576 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“The
Federal Patent Act requires that all assignments of patent interest be in writing.”). Patents may
also be transferred by operation of law as in the case of inheritance. Akazawa v. Link New
Technology Int'l, 520 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

In this matter, there was no written

assignment of the ’109 Patent from the inventor, Mr. Chen, to his company, AEI, until
September, 2011. Moreover, the ’109 Patent did not transfer from Mr. Chen to AEI as a matter
of law prior to that assignment.
4

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 5 of 21 PageID 13562

While it is true that the face of the original ’109 Patent lists AEI, such designation on the
face of a patent is "not a conclusive indication" of patent ownership. U.S. Philips Corp. v.
Iwasaki Elec. Co., 505 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Rather, the plaintiff must demonstrate
that it is the owner/patentee, assignee, or grantee of the patent-in-suit. See 35 U.S.C. § 281;
Morrow v. Microsoft Corp., 499 F.3d 1332, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Fairchild Semiconductor
Corp. v. Power Integrations, Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d 365, 370 (D. Del. 2007); LG Display Co. v.
AU Optronics Corp., 686 F. Supp. 2d 429, 451-452 (D. Del. 2010).
As plaintiff, Alps “must demonstrate legal title to the patent at the inception of the
lawsuit to be entitled to sue for patent infringement.” MyMail, Ltd. v. Am. Online, Inc., 476 F.3d
1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing Paradise Creations, Inc . v. UV Sales, Inc., 315 F.3d 1304,
1309 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). However, if the original plaintiff lacks Article III initial standing the suit
must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Paradise Creations, Inc., 315 F.3d at 1309.
The September 2011 Assignments evidence that the Agreement and the Amended
Agreement between AEI and Alps purporting to transfer an exclusive license from AEI to Alps
are void ab initio because, at the time of the purported conveyances, AEI did not have any right
of title in the ’109 Patent and thus, AEI could not confer to Alps that which it did not possess.
Unless AEI held the entire interest in the ’109 Patent on the date that the Agreement was
executed, August 31, 2008, the Agreement could not grant Alps any rights in the ’109 Patent.
Burandt v. Dudas, 528 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Similarly, because the Amended Agreement
was executed prior to the assignment of the ’109 Patent to AEI, the Amended Agreement could
not transfer any rights to Alps either. Thus, as this Court has stated, Alps could only have
standing to sue if the Agreement and the Amended Agreement were effective to convey
substantial rights in the ’109 Patent. (See Dkt. No. 73). However, because the Agreement and

5

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 6 of 21 PageID 13563

the Amended Agreement could not convey any interest in the ’109 Patent, since AEI had no
interest to convey, Alps did not have standing to bring suit against OWW, and this Court,
therefore, lacks jurisdiction.
i.

The Agreement and the Amended Agreement Are Void Ab Initio

In the Agreement and the Amended Agreement between AEI and Alps, AEI asserts “[it]
owns and has rights to license certain PATENT RIGHTS” including the ’109 Patent. (Dkt. No.
31-2; 59; 62). AEI’s alleged ownership rights in the ’109 Patent was the predicate for this
Court’s Orders. (Dkt. No. 73; 272). However, it was not until Mr. Chen assigned his rights in the
’109 Patent, by way of the September 2011 Assignments, that AEI actually acquired title to the
’109 Patent. Any assertion by AEI that it possessed rights in the ’109 Patent on August 31,
2008, the date this lawsuit was filed, is false because it was not until late 2011 that AEI received
any rights to the ’109 Patent as evidenced by the notarized and recorded September 2011
Assignments. Accordingly, because AEI did not own or have any right to license the ’109
Patent, as it purported to have in both the Agreement and the Amended Agreement, the
Agreement and the Amended Agreement are void ab initio. Therefore, on the date this lawsuit
was filed, John Chen, not AEI, was the owner of the ’109 Patent.
Furthermore, in the September 2011 Assignments to AEI, Mr. Chen represents that the
rights, title, and interests conveyed therein were unencumbered and that Mr. Chen, the assignor,
had the authority to convey those rights, title, and interest in that assignment. Mr. Chen’s
September 2011 Assignments were recorded at the United States Patent Office and inform the
public (in statements made therein, including the word “unencumbered”) that no rights in the
’109 Patent were granted to anyone else prior to September 2011.

6

Therefore, the 2008

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 7 of 21 PageID 13564

Agreement was powerless to transfer any rights to Alps1.
ii.

The September 2011 Assignments Failed To Vest Interest In The ’109
Patent To AEI At The Time Of The Agreement And Amended
Agreement To Alps

It is a basic principle of patent law that inventors own their inventions. Bd. of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Roche Molecular Sys., Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2188, 2199 (2011)
(holding that “unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not have ownership
rights in an invention which is the original conception of the employee alone.”). Furthermore,
the U.S. Supreme Court in Stanford held that “[i]n most circumstances, an inventor must
expressly grant his ownership rights in an invention to his employer if the employer is to obtain
those rights. Id. at 2195. The drafter of the September 2011 Assignments that Mr. Chen signed
attempts to substantiate AEI’s rights in the ’109 Patent.

Although the September 2011

Assignments premise some of AEI’s alleged prior ownership on theories of “fiduciary duty”
(referring to an alleged duty of Mr. Chen to AEI) and “hired inventor” (referring to Mr. Chen
allegedly being hired by AEI to invent) neither theory survives scrutiny.
First, Mr. Chen does not have a fiduciary duty to AEI in a closely held private
corporation, where the only other shareholder is his wife. Love v. The Mail on Sunday,
CV057798ABCPJWX, 2006 WL 4046181 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2006) (holding that equal
shareholders in a corporation do not owe each other fiduciary duties).
Second, Mr. Chen is not an employee hired to invent by AEI; he is an owner/shareholder
of AEI. (California Labor Code sections 3351(c) and 4151(a); Testimony of John Y. Chen, Trial
Trans. April 30, 2012(b), pg. 44). And even if Mr. Chen were an employee hired to invent, he
would only have an obligation to assign his rights to any invention to his employer, AEI. See
1

For its part, Alps never recorded its Agreements with AEI which would mean that a subsequent purchaser (after
September 2011) for value from AEI who would have been unaware of Alps’ alleged license would take superior to,
and extinguish, Alps alleged rights by operation of law. 35 U.S.C. 261.

7

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 8 of 21 PageID 13565

Banks v. Unisys Corp., 228 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2000). An obligation to assign is not an
assignment; legal title to the invention does not automatically pass to the employer in the
absence of further legal action on the part of the employer to perfect its title. See Gellman v.
Telular Corp., 449 Fed. Appx. 941, 944–45 (Fed.Cir.2011) (finding that the “hired to invent”
doctrine is entirely equitable creating only an obligation for the employee to assign to his
employer and unable to satisfy standing requirements). As such, assuming further for the sake of
argument that Mr. Chen had a fiduciary duty to assign the ’109 Patent to AEI, the most AEI
would have had prior to September 2011 would be an equitable interest in the ’109 Patent - and
equitable rights are insufficient to provide standing to bring suit. See Id. at 944 (holding that all
rights, title, and interest remain in the inventor at such time until any and all assignments are
executed necessary to vest interest in an employer).
Mr. Chen finally assigned and recorded all rights to the ’109 Patent to AEI in September
of 2011, thereby making any allegation that AEI owned title to the ’109 Patent before this time a
falsity and rendering the Agreement and Amended Agreement void ab initio.
iii.

Assignments Of Parent Patents Are Insufficient To Transfer Rights In
Future Continuation-In-Part Patents

The assignment of the patents to which the ’109 Patent claims priority were insufficient
to transfer rights in the ’109 Patent from Mr. Chen to AEI because: (1) the ’109 Patent is a
continuation-in-part (“CIP”) and by law contains new matter; (2) Mr. Chen represented to the
USPTO that an assignment “will follow” in the ’109 Patent application; and (3) the assignments
of the parent patents from Mr. Chen to AEI were insufficient to encompass future CIP
applications.
First, the ’109 Patent is a CIP of earlier filed patents by Mr. Chen. These patents include:

Application no. 08/581,125, now U.S. Patent No. 5,962,572 (“the ’572 Patent”)

(See Exhibit D, hereinafter the ’597 Patent; the ’286 Patent; the ’117 Patent; and the ’572 Patent
are collectively referred to as “Parent Patents”)).
Indeed, Mr. Chen expressly declared in the New Application Transmittal for the
invention titled GELATINOUS ELASTOMER COMPOSITION AND ARTICLES, ultimately
issuing as the ’109 Patent, that the application was a CIP.

(Exhibit C, pg. 2).
“[T]he quintessential difference between a continuation and a continuation-in-part is the
addition of new matter.” PowerOasis, Inc. v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 522 F.3d 1299, 1304 n.3 (Fed.
Cir. 2008) (emphasis added). The ’109 Patent was filed as a CIP because it contains new matter
not common to the Parent Patents and, as such, the ’109 Patent required its own assignment. Mr.
Chen, a patent agent with over 40 years of patent experience knew this, which explains the

9

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 10 of 21 PageID 13567

September 2011 Assignments. The Grant section of the September 28, 2011 assignment again
clearly evidences Mr. Chen’s intent to file the ’109 Patent as a CIP:

(Exhibit B).
Mr. Chen realized the CIPs were not covered by the earlier assignments of the Parent
Patents and “does assign to Assignee all right, title, and interest not earlier transferred or
assigned” when he executed the September 2011 Assignments to try to remedy the problem.
However, this remedial act came too late to save Alps’ standing in this suit.
Second, when the application that became the ’109 Patent was filed on March 8, 1996,
Mr. Chen made the representation to the USTPO he intended to file an assignment.

(Exhibit C, pg. 4).

10

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 11 of 21 PageID 13568

Indicating that an assignment “will follow” conclusively demonstrates that an assignment
of the ’109 Patent was not executed at that time. Further, if such an assignment were then in
existence, “a newly executed ‘CERTIFICATE UNDER 37 CFR 3.73(b)’ must be filed when a
continuation-in-part application is filed by an assignee.” (Exhibit C, pg. 4, Last line
“WARNING”). No certificate under 37 CFR 3.73(b) is found in the ’109 Patent file history
confirming no assignment of the ’109 Patent was made at that time.
In addition, although not law, the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent
Examining Procedure (“MPEP”) states that new assignments are needed for continuation-in-part
applications. (MPEP § 306). However, it has been a long-standing requirement, codified in 35
U.S.C. § 261, that “patents, or any interest therein, shall be assignable in law by an instrument in
writing.” 35 U.S.C. § 261; Sky Techs. LLC v. SAP AG, 576 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
(“The Federal Patent Act requires that all assignments of patent interest be in writing.”).
Accordingly, as an experienced patent agent, Mr. Chen was well familiar with MPEP § 306 and
its requirements to file an assignment of the ’109 Patent in the future. Until September 2011,
Mr. Chen failed to file an assignment for the ’109 Patent.
Lastly, the assignments of the Parent Patents are insufficient to confer ownership of title
in the ’109 Patent. Application No. 08/288,690 was first assigned to AEI on July 14, 1995.
(Exhibit G). The portion of the assignment stating the extent of the rights is shown below:

“Construction of patent assignment agreements is a matter of state contract law. Euclid
Chem. Co. v. Vector Corrosion Technologies, Inc., 561 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Mr. Chen is
a resident of the State of California and AEI is incorporated in California, and as such California
law applies. California courts have held that the standard is an objective one and does not
depend on the parties' subjective intents. Cedars–Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Shewry, 137 Cal. App. 4th
964, 980, 41 Cal. Rptr. 3d 48 (2006) (“California recognizes the objective theory of contracts,
under which it is the objective intent, as evidenced by the words of the contract, rather than the
subjective intent of one of the parties, that controls interpretation.”) (internal quotations and
citations omitted).
Mr. Chen assigned to AEI the ’597 Patent; the ’286 Patent; the ’117 Patent; and the ’572
Patent, and recorded the assignments with the USPTO on December 26, 1996, July 14, 1995,
April 4, 1996, and April 4, 1996 respectively. (See Exhibits H, G, E, F respectively). The
September 2011 Assignments allege that Mr. Chen had already assigned the common subject
matter between the Parent Patents and the ’109 Patent due to the written assignments of the
Parent Patents. (See Exhibits A and B). However, as the ’109 Patent application and the
September 2011 Assignments affirm, the ’109 Patent contains new matter. It was Mr. Chen’s
attempt in the September 2011 Assignments to assign from Mr. Chen to AEI “all right, title, and
interest in the [the ’109 Patent] and the underlying inventions to the extent not otherwise already
transferred.” (See Exhibits A and B). This admission confirms that not all matter in the ’109
Patent was assigned to AEI by the Parent Patent assignments.
Indeed, Mr. Chen had already filed the ’109 Patent application with the USPTO, on May
3, 1996 before he recorded the assignments of the ’597, ’117, and the ’572 Patents, all which
occurred after May 3, 1996. It is uncontestable that Mr. Chen was aware of the ’109 Patent

15

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 16 of 21 PageID 13573

application, at the time he Assigned the’597, ’117, and the ’572 Patents to AEI, and as shown
above, made no attempt to reference the ’109 Patent application, or CIPs for that matter, in those
assignments. If Mr. Chen intended for the rights in the ’109 Patent to transfer from himself to
AEI at the time he would have include the proper language to do so.
Turning to the assignments of the Parent Patents, each of assignments to AEI for the
’597, ’572, and ’117 Patents share the same form language describing the extent assigned to
include “in and to any and all improvements which are disclosed in the invention entitled:”
(emphasis

added)

“ORIENTED

“NOVEL,

GEL

AND

ULTRA-SOFT,
ORIENTED

GEL

ULTRA-ELASTIC
ARTICLES”;

GEL

and

AIRFOILS”;

“GELATINOUS

COMPOSITION AND ARTICLES” for the ’597, ’572, and ’117 Patents, respectively. (See
Exhibits E, F, and H). These three forms include language stating “and, in and to all Letters
Patent to be obtained for said invention by the above application or in any continuation, division,
renewal, or substitute thereof, and as the letters patent any reissue or re-examination thereof.”
(See Exhibits E, F, and H). Unlike the above language, the assignment of the ’286 Patent is
narrower and more restrictive including only the “the full and exclusive right, title and interest to
said invention and all Letters Patent of the United States to be obtained therefore on said
application or any continuation, division, renewal, substitute or reissue thereof . . . .” (Exhibit G).
Moreover, closer examination of the ’597 Patent assignment indicates that Mr. Chen fails to
designate if he is assigning a full or partial interest further allowing Mr. Chen to retain some
rights in the ’597 Patent.

16

Case 8:08-cv-01893-MSS-MAP Document 426 Filed 05/22/13 Page 17 of 21 PageID 13574

(Exhibit H, pg. 5)
Reviewing the contractual language objectively, Mr. Chen chose not to cover any CIPs
derived from the Parent Patents, although he clearly knew, as a patent agent himself, what a CIP
is, and used CIP in language in the 2011 Assignments.

Because these Parent Patents

assignments make no mention of CIPs and expressly use singular language, by the unambiguous
wording and objective intent, the assignments of the Parent Patents to AEI cannot be considered
to include the ’109 Patent.
The assignment language of the ’597, ’572, and ’117 patent assignments to AEI include
“all improvements.” In the case Regents Of Univ. Of New Mexico v. Knight, the court found an
assignment agreement to include future CIPs even though the agreement did not mention CIPs.
321 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the court was persuaded by the “broad language in
the [University’s] Patent Policy, the Co-Inventor Agreement, and the Joint Assignments” which
included language such as “All staff members who make inventions or discoveries . . . shall
disclose all such inventions and discoveries . . . [S]uch inventions and discoveries belong to the
University” that led to that court’s conclusion. Id. at 119. Such a provision is clearly intended to
obligate an inventor at a University to transfer all inventions or discoveries. The facts here are
clearly distinct.
First, the language set forth in the assignment of the ’286 Patent makes no mention of
“future inventions,” or “improvements” but is merely limited to “said application or any
continuation, division, renewal, substitute or reissue thereof . . . .” (See Exhibit G). Second, the
language of the ’597, ’572, and ’117 patent assignments is limited “in and to any and all
improvements which are disclosed in the invention”. The ’109 Patent is not an improvement of
the ’597, ’572, and ’117 Patents - it is a new invention with new matter not previously “disclosed

assignments.

CONCLUSION

The September 2011 Assignments, in their own words, make clear that Mr. Chen was the
rightful owner of all of the rights in the ’109 Patent until September 27, 2011; today AEI is the
rightful owner. Accordingly, by law, AEI did not have any rights to grant to Alps prior to
September 27, 2011. Therefore, the exclusive license between AEI and Alps granting rights in
the ’109 Patent three years earlier in 2008, and subsequent nunc pro tunc agreement, are void.
In view of these recent developments, OWW respectfully requests this Court to issue a
new ruling that Alps does not have substantial right in the ’109 Patent and therefore lacks
standing in this case. OWW also respectfully requests that this Court grant OWW relief from
final judgment as declared void, relieving OWW of this Court’s Orders on monetary damages
owed by OWW and the permanent injunction, and to dismiss the case.
