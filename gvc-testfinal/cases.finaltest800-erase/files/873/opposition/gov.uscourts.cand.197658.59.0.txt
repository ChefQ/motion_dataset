I. INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF ISSUES

Defendant Gap, Inc. "Defendant" or "Gap") conflates a myriad of procedural vehicles
into one defective, inappropriate, and ill-timed motion. Defendant couches this, its second
motion to strike, as an attack on Plaintiff's class definition when, in reality, it is an end run

around the Court's refusal to bifurcate discovery. Through its motion, Defendant seeks
to avoid discovery obligations without filing a motion for a protective order or renewing
its motion for bifurcation. As the motion attempts to prematurely litigate class certification, it is
also an end-run around the Court's April 25, 2008 Scheduling Order. Moreover, as Defendant
did not prevail in dismissing Plaintiff's case, Defendant now seeks amendment of Plaintiff's
complaint for its own strategic purposes through inappropriate means.

This Court scheduled the hearing on class certification in this case for December 5,
2008. Through its motion to strike, Defendant seeks to disadvantage Plaintiff by forcing him to
present his arguments in support of class certification months ahead of schedule and without the
benefit of completing discovery. Plaintiff will file his class certification motion at the
appropriate time according to the schedule that the parties agreed to and the Court ordered. At
that time, Plaintiff will have necessary evidence from: (1) a complete review of Defendant's
document production and, (2) deposition testimony of the appropriate witnesses, which have
been delayed by Defendant's sluggish document production and scheduling.

Meaningful opposition to the Rule 23 arguments raised in Defendant's Motion to Strike
requires meaningful discovery into the injuries suffered by the proposed Class. Class members,
approximately 800,000 Gap employees and job applicants, are each presently injured by the theft
of the laptop containing their unencrypted personal and financial information. Their damages-
such as the cost of credit monitoring, ordering credit reports, the money and time spent dealing
with Defendant or attempting to resolve any identity theft they may incur-all stem from the
theft and are not different, separate injuries as Defendant would have the Court believe.
Discovery into the theft and the damages caused by the data breach may inform the class

definition. In sum, without completing discovery and fleshing out Plaintiff's class certification

arguments and evidence, Defendant prematurely and inappropriately opposes Plaintiff's yet-to-
be-filed motion for class certification.

Finally, Plaintiff has the prerogative to request leave to amend the class definition in the
Complaint in conjunction with filing his motion for class certification. The policy behind this
aforementioned practice is to grant plaintiffs the opportunity to craft a more informed class
definition after the completion of discovery and a thorough exploration of the class issues has
been conducted. A premature determination of the class definition will thwart the goals of the
mechanism for class certification.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. Factual Summary

Mr. Ruiz applied for employment with Old Navy, one of Gap's brand stores, through
Gap's website in late 2006. (See Compl. 31.) As part of the online application process, Mr.
Ruiz was required to provide a large amount of private information, such as his social security
number, date of birth, home address, and telephone numbers. (/d.) Gap stated that Mr. Ruiz's
application would be "considered for only 90 days," yet maintained Mr. Ruiz's personal
information for approximately one year. (Jd. 40.) Gap also promised in its Privacy Policy that
it would use "reasonable precautions to protect [Mr. Ruiz's] personal information from
unauthorized use, access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction." (Jd. 4 25.)

On September 19, 2007, Gap learned that two laptop computers had been stolen from the
offices of a third-party vendor it used to manage its job applicant data. The laptops contained the
personal information of approximately 800,000 persons who applied for employment with Old
Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and/or its outlet stores by telephone or online through use of Gap's
online application between July 2006 to June 2007. (Id. yen 5.)

Mr. Ruiz received a letter dated September 28, 2007 from Gap stating that his personal
information was compromised in the laptop thefts. (Jd. 0x00A7 34.) In the letter, Gap confessed that
neither Gap nor any of its vendors encrypted the job applicants' personal information on the

stolen laptops - despite its promise to protect such information when the information was

collected. (Compl. { 33.) Thus, the thieves in possession of the laptops can easily and readily
view the sensitive information of Mr. Ruiz and other job applicants.

At his deposition, Mr. Ruiz testified that he has lost time and money in making cellphone
calls and visiting websites to protect his identity, including following Gap's recommendations
from the notification letter that it sent to each Class member. (See accompanying Declaration of
Tracy D. Rezvani in Opposition to Defendant Gap Inc.'s Motion to Strike Class Definition

("Rezvani Decl.") at Exh. C).

B. Procedural History

On November 13, 2007, Ruiz filed a complaint against Gap seeking injunctive relief and
any other relief that the Court deemed necessary as a result of Gap's failure to maintain
reasonable and adequate procedures to secure applicants' personal information. The complaint

defines the Class as follows:

All persons who have applied for a position with Gap, Inc., Old
Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, Outlet Stores, or any other
relevant Gap brand store, through Gap's application process from
July1, 2006 to July 31, 2007, and whose personal information was
compromised in a laptop theft from one or more of Gap's third

party vendors.
(Compl. { 44.)

On November 20, 2007, Gap answered the Complaint and filed a counterclaim against
Ruiz and the Class. On March 24, 2008, the Court: (1) granted Plaintiffs motion to dismiss
Gap's counterclaim, (2) denied Gap's first motion to strike the class allegations as "premature"
and "inappropriate," (3) denied Gap's Request for Judicial Notice, and (4) denied in part and
granted in part Gap's motion for judgment on the pleadings. See Ruiz v. Gap, Inc., 540 F. Supp.
2d 1121, 1124-26 (N.D. Cal. 2008).

On April 25, 2008, the Court held a case management conference at which time Gap
requested that the Court bifurcate discovery. The Court refused to bifurcate discovery and
scheduled a hearing on Plaintiffs motion for class certification and Gap's motion for summary

judgment for December 5, 2008.

Cc. Status of Discovery

On May 28, 2008, Ruiz served Gap with written interrogatories, requests for admissions,
and document requests regarding class certification issues and the parties' claims and defenses.
The deadline for Gap's production was June 30, 2008. It was not until July 11, 2008' that
Plaintiff received the first of Gap's documents- only about one quarter of its production to date.
(See Rezvani Decl., Exh. A.) Gap held back the majority of its production until August 7, 2008,
or one week after filing its second motion to strike class allegations. (See id., Exh. B.) Plaintiff
has not completed his review of these documents in this short interval and therefore is unable to
determine if Gap's production is finally complete. (See id., 4 4.) Thus, as of the filing of this
brief, Plaintiff has not had an adequate opportunity to review this production much less evaluate
his approach to class certification in light of the contents of Plaintiff's discovery.

Moreover, on July 31, 2008, Ruiz noticed three depositions (two individuals and one
under FRCP 30(b)(6)) with the understanding that the parties would cooperate on scheduling and
waive N.D. Cal.L.R. 30-1. (See id., Exh. D (deposition notices).) To date, Gap has failed to
provide firm dates for these witnesses' depositions." (See id. 46.) Thus, Plaintiff has yet to
discover crucial testimony from individuals regarding, among other things: (1) the foundation of
Gap's statement that Class members' personal information has not been "accessed or used"
improperly, and (2) the affirmative steps Gap has taken to identify whether Class members have
become victims of identity theft.

D. The Parties' Efforts to Meet-And-Confer Concerning Gap's Instant Motion

On July 7, 2008, Gap sent Plaintiff a "meet-and-confer" letter proposing that the parties

stipulate to amending the class definition to exclude ``anyone who has experienced identity theft

 

' This partial production coincided with the deadline set by Gap for Plaintiff to

voluntarily amend his complaint. See 0x00A7 II.D., infra. In other words, Plaintiff would have had
no opportunity to review any documents before answering Gap's demand.

Plaintiff also issued a subpoena for the deposition of Gap's vendor who failed to secure

the laptops or the information they contained. Production is not yet due and the third party
vendor's counsel is in negotiations over dates and locations for the depositions.

as a result of the [theft of laptops containing Class members' personal information]."" Plaintiff
explained the various reasons described herein why Gap's motion has no basis in fact or law and
was otherwise premature and in violation of the Court's Scheduling Order. Despite Plaintiff's
attempts at reason, Gap has again filed a premature motion to strike Plaintiff's class allegations.

Tl. ARGUMENT

A. Gap's Motion is Procedurally Defective

Gap's motion is improper under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Moreover, Gap's motion fails to meet the purpose underlying Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, or its requirements. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(f). Finally, Gap's motion, essentially
a regurgitation of its initial motion to strike which the Court denied, is still premature.

1. Gap's Motion Is Impermissible Under Rule 23(d)(1)(D).

Courts generally review class allegations through a motion for class certification. See In
re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 505 F. Supp. 2d 609, 615 (N.D. Cal. 2007)(declining to rule on the
propriety of class allegations before arguments relating to class certification had been made).
Nothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits Gap to file successive, piecemeal
motions to strike aimed at Plaintiff's class allegations.' While a court may require an
amendment to the pleadings to eliminate allegations about the representation of absent persons
pursuant to Rule 23(d)(1)(D), this very Court has previously held that this rule only applies after
an examination has been made of the arguments in favor and in opposition to class certification
in the context of a motion for class certification pursuant to Rule 23(c). See Beauperthuy v. 24

Hour Fitness USA, Inc., No. 06-0715, 2006 WL 3422198, at *3 (N.D. Cal. 2006). That is

 

; The parties' correspondence referenced herein is attached as Exhibits A-1 through A-4 to

the William Stern Declaration.

4 Here, Gap only seeks a determination of FRCP 23(a)(3)( typicality) and FRCP
23(a)(4)(adequacy) and presumably leaves a determination under FRCP 23(a)(1)(numerosity),
23(a)(2)(commonality) and 23(b)(3)(predominance and superiority) for its next motion. If the
Court would prefer Plaintiff to address the merits of Gap's typicality and adequacy arguments,
Plaintiff respectfully requests an opportunity to fully brief them subsequent to the September 5,
2008 hearing.

because such motions to amend pleadings under Rule 23(d) are "an improper attempt to argue
against class certification before the motion for class certification has been made and while
discovery regarding class certification is not yet complete." Jd.; see also Steve Baicker-McKee,
et. al., Federal Civil Rules Handbook 574 (15th ed. 2008). This Court has not had an
opportunity to evaluate a class certification motion. Therefore, the predicate for this motion,
FRCP 23(d)(1)(D), is inapplicable and the motion should be denied as procedurally defective.
2. Gap's Motion Fails to Meet the "Formidable" Burden of Rule 12(f)

The only rule that permits a "motion to strike" is Rule 12(f), the purpose of which is to
strike from pleadings "redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matters." Fed. R. Civ.
P. 12(f). The Court may act on a 12(f) motion only if it is filed before a responsive pleading.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)(2). Gap filed its responsive pleading on November 20, 2007, or
approximately eight months before this motion. As such, it is untimely and procedurally
inappropriate.

Moreover, even if timely, the party bringing a motion to strike seeks an exceptional
remedy and therefore has the "formidable" burden of proof. See, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Pogue v.
Diabetes Treatment Ctr. of Am., 474 F. Supp. 2d 75, 79 (D.D.C. 2007). A motion to strike may
only be granted where there is clear evidence that the defendants have been prejudiced by the
"redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matters." Montecino v. Spherion Corp., 427
F. Supp. 2d 965, 966-67 (C.D. Cal. 2006); Hart v. Baca, 204 F.R.D. 456, 457 (C.D. Cal. 2001).
This is because motions to strike are generally disfavored by courts due to the "limited
importance of pleading in federal practice, and because [motions to strike] are often used as a
delay tactic." In re Wal-Mart, 505 F. Supp. 2d at 614; see also e.g., Rosales v. Citibank Fed.
Sav. Bank, 133 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1180 (N.D. Cal. 2001). Courts must view the pleading under
attack in the light most favorable to the pleader, treating as admitted all material facts alleged
