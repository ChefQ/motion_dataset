MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
BASED UPON BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES OF STATE LAW

I.

INTRODUCTION
“[T]he Fifth Amendment protects rather than creates property interests.” McKay v.

United States, 199 F.3d 1376, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Instead, in most instances, the right and
power to define property interests is reserved to the states. As Justice Scalia intoned in Lucas v.
South Carolina Coastal Council, “‘takings’ jurisprudence . . . has traditionally been guided by
the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of, and the State’s power over, the
‘bundle of rights’ that they acquire when they obtain title to property.” 505 U.S. 1003, 1027
(1992). As such, “Federal courts look to state law to ‘define the range of interests that qualify
for protection as “property,” under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.’” John R. Sand &
Gravel Co. v. United States, 62 Fed. Cl. 556, 562 (2004), aff’d on other grounds, 457 F.3d 1345
(2006), aff’d 128 S.Ct. 750 (2008), citing Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1030.
In the instant case, the state of Minnesota has considered the application of its statutory
property law as well is its common law of nuisance to residential development of the very lake
shore lots at issue in this case.1/ Applying its own intrinsic law, the state determined that neither
plaintiff, nor any other owner, could possess a stick in their bundle of property rights that would
allow them to locate residential development on the lake front lots at issue in this case. As the

1/

Background principles of property law can also derive, in certain circumstances, from federal
law. See, e.g., Lucas, 505 U.S. 1003 (referring to the federal navigational servitude).

State of Minnesota found, to do so would have negative health and safety consequences because
of the inherent inability to safely install septic systems on the property.
Given that the lake shore lots at issue here cannot be developed as residential properties
under state law, Plaintiff has no property interest in their development of sale as residential lake
front lots. Plaintiff enjoys no property right to develop the lots or sell them for residential
development, ergo that non-existent right cannot be taken. As such, Plaintiff’s claim – that his
right to develop the lots for residential purposes or to alienate the lots for residential
development by others was destroyed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ denial of a
permit to fill wetlands – cannot constitute a taking.
II.

BACKGROUND
A.

Sunny Beach Subdivision

Plaintiff claims that 13.2 acres of property immediately adjacent to Lake of the Woods in
Minnesota have been taken from him by Defendant.2/ Complaint (Dkt. 1), ¶¶ IV, VII. The
property, which is commonly known as “Sunny Beach,” was platted by plaintiff as a residential
subdivision containing 14 residential parcels.3/ Id. ¶ IV. To provide access to the individual lots,
from the fall of 1998 through August, 1999, Plaintiff had a road constructed through Sunny

2/

Defendant asserts that the relevant parcel for purposes of this case is a much larger tract of land totaling
approximately 206.15 acres, which was purchased in a single transaction by Plaintiff and his former wife,
Kathryn Bailey, in June, 1989. See Bailey v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 239, 241 (2007) (“Bailey I”). The
size of the parcel, however, is not relevant to the present motion for summary judgment and, as such, any
dispute over the relevant parcel need not be addressed by the Court at this time.

3/

“As approved by the County Board in late 1998, the plat had 14 lots, averaging 33,700 square feet each,
with roughly 100’ of shorefront each being roughly 300 feet deep.” See Findings of Fact, Conclusion and
Recommendation of the State of Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings for the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency (“ALJ’s Report”), at ¶ 4 (attached hereto as Ex. A).

Beach. See Bailey I, 78 Fed. Cl. at 242-43. At the time the road was installed, Plaintiff had not
obtained the necessary authorizations to construct the road from the United States Army Corps
of Engineers (“Corps of Engineers”) or from the State of Minnesota. Id. at 243; Deposition of
Gary Bailey (“Bailey Dep.”) (Dec. 1, 2004), Ex. 16 (attached hereto as Ex. B). In December
1998, the subdivision plat was approved by Lake of the Woods County. Complaint (Dkt. 1), ¶
IV; see also Bailey I, 78 Fed. Cl. at 242.
From December, 1998 through the first half of 1999, Plaintiff sold lots 2 through 14,
retaining lot 1 for himself. Id. at 244-45. Some time thereafter, Plaintiff reacquired seven of the
lots (4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13). Bailey Dep. (Feb. 22, 2008), Ex. 51 (attached hereto as Ex. C);
Bailey I, 78 Fed. Cl. at 245. In its August 10, 2007 decision granting, in part, Defendant’s prior
Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court ruled that Plaintiff held no property interest in three of
the lots (7, 8, and 11), which have, therefore, not been taken from Plaintiff for purposes of his
Fifth Amendment takings claim. See Bailey I, 78 Fed. Cl. at 275. The remaining three lots (2, 3,
and 14) remain subject to contracts for deed for which the purchasers are essentially current with
their payments. Bailey Dep. (Feb. 22, 2008), 47:4-11, 50:3-6 (attached hereto as Ex. D).
B.

Plaintiff’s Application for a Section 401 Certification

Plaintiff was required to obtain both a Section 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers as
well as a Section 401 Certification from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (“MPCA”)
before developing Sunny Beach as a residential development. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1344, 1341. Section
401 provides for state-issued certifications for activities that may result in a pollutant discharge
to surface waters (Id. at § 1341(a)) and addresses the proposed development’s compliance with
the state’s water quality standards and other requirements of state law. Id. at § 1341(d). The

Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (“MPCA”) has adopted rules to implement the Section 401
certification program. Minn. R. 7001.1400-1470 (2007). Under its own rules, MPCA can issue
a certification only if “there is [a] reasonable assurance that the activity will be conducted in a
manner that will not violate applicable water quality standards.” Id. at 1470, subp. 1.C. The
MPCA has also adopted standards for the revocation of a certification. Id. at 1450, subp. 1.B.
In August, 1998, the Corps of Engineers received an application for an after-the-fact
permit for the Road. Bailey Dep. (Dec. 1, 2004), Ex. 9 (attached hereto as Ex. E).4/ On June 24,
1999, the Corps of Engineers issued a public notice regarding Plaintiff’s after-the-fact Section
404 permit application. Bailey Dep. (Dec. 1, 2004), Ex. 11 (attached hereto as Ex. G). As a
result of the public notice, the MPCA became aware of Plaintiff’s Sunny Beach project.
Testimony of Larry Zdon (“Zdon Test.”), CCH Tr. 31-32 (attached hereto as Ex. H). As is its
customary procedure, MPCA treated the public notice as an application for a Section 401

quality issues. 33 U.S.C. § 1341. Minnesota has included protection of groundwater as part of
its certification requirements, which requirement goes above and beyond any requirements
imposed by the federal Clean Water Act. Minn. R. 7060.0100 et seq. Minnesota’s review also
goes above and beyond the federal requirements by including in its certification review
consideration of the specific type of septic system that may be installed to treat sewage under
state law (Minn. Stat. Ann. § 115.07 (2008); Minn. R. ch. 7080.0170 (2007)), and the

the impact and appropriateness of placing fill material in wetlands. The 404 permit denial is only relevant
to the instant motion for summary judgment to the extent that its impact is coterminous with background
principles of Minnesota law of nuisance.

requirement that the property owner be able to install two separate standard septic systems
(Minn. R. 7080.0305, subp. 4.F (2007); Minn. R. 6120.3500 subp. 3 (2007).
Initially, the MPCA had concerns regarding residential development at Sunny Beach
because it was unclear whether individual sewage treatment systems (“ISTS” or “septic
systems”) could be installed on the property in compliance with MPCA’s ISTS rules (Minn. R.
Chap. 7080). Zdon Test., CCH Tr. 36-37 (Ex. H).5/ Thus, the MPCA issued a request for
information (“RFI”) to Plaintiff on July 23, 1999, requesting additional information regarding
septic system compliance and wetland impacts. CCH Tr. Ex. 6 (attached hereto as Ex. I); see
also ALJ’s Report at ¶ 9 (Ex. A). The RFI requested that Plaintiff describe how compliance with
the MPCA’s ISTS rules would be achieved, a layout showing wetlands on the property, and an
evaluation to determine total wetland impacts. CCH Tr. Ex. 6 (Ex. I); see also ALJ’s Report at ¶
11 (Ex. A). Bailey did not respond to the RFI. Zdon Test., CCH Tr. 50, 94-95, 147 (Ex. H); see
also ALJ’s Report at ¶ 12 (Ex. A).
On December 19, 1999, the MPCA issued a Section 401 Certification to Plaintiff for the
Sunny Beach project. Zdon Test., CCH Tr. 77 (Ex. H); see also ALJ’s Report at ¶ 20 (Ex. A).
The initial granting of the Section 401 Certification was based upon representations made by
local government officials indicating that the 100 feet of land closest to Lake of the Woods on

To meet the health and safety requirements of Minnesota state law, septic systems require three feet of
unsaturated soils in order to fulfill the two basic functions of an ISTS: sewage treatment and hydraulic
performance. Testimony of Mark Wespetal (“Wespetal Test.”), CCH Tr. 396-400 (Ex. H). A mound can
be created to provide a portion of the three feet of unsaturated soil for a mound system, but even a mound
system is required to have at least 12 inches of unsaturated original or natural soil in the absorption area.

each lot was not saturated and would, therefore, support the installation of septic systems. See
ALJ’s Report at ¶¶ 14-21 (Ex. A).
C.

Revocation of Plaintiff’s Section 401 Certification

The information provided by the local government officials later proved to be inaccurate.
Id. at ¶ 24. In August, 2000, experts from the Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (“NRCS”) conducted a formal on-site
wetland delineation at Sunny Beach. Bailey I, 78 Fed. Cl. at 243; see also, ALJ’s Report at ¶ 23
(Ex. A). The on-site investigation demonstrated the inaccuracy of the conclusion that the first
100-feet of land closest to Lake of the Woods was not saturated and could adequately support
septic systems. Id. ¶ 24. The MPCA was now aware of the true soil conditions on the property,
including the saturated nature of the soil, which had not previously been disclosed by Plaintiff.
As the Minnesota State Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) stated in his findings:
By the early fall of 2000, MPCA’s deliberations and evaluations
centered on four main areas[, including] . . . (4) because virtually
the entire plat was wetland, the lack of assurance that ISTSs could
be installed that would comply with the MPCA rules. Given the
lack of information and uncertainty on these issues, MPCA
determined it could not modify the existing Section 401
certification to address these unknowns and uncertainties, and
decided that the certificate should be revoked.
ALJ’s Report at ¶ 28 (Ex. A). As a result of the new information and new analysis, the MPCA
revoked Plaintiff’s 401 Certification for the Sunny Beach Subdivision. CCH Tr. Ex. 16
(attached hereto as Ex. J); see also Bailey I, 78 Fed. Cl. at 243. On June 12, 2001, the Corps of
Engineers denied Plaintiff’s application for an after-the-fact section 404 permit. Id. The Corps
of Engineers was required to deny the application given that Plaintiff’s Section 401 Certification
had been revoked by the State of Minnesota. 33 U.S.C. § 1344.

Plaintiff’s Takings Claims

As a result of the Corps of Engineers’ denial of the permit, Plaintiff claims that he was
unable to maintain the road at Sunny Beach, which, in turn, interfered with his sale of the lots as
residential lake shore lots. In his Complaint, Plaintiff variously describes his claims related to
the Corps of Engineers’ alleged interference with the development of residential lake shore lots.
Plaintiff claims, for example, that the actions of the Corps of Engineers “diminished the value of
[the] property from highly valuable residential lakeshore property to property in which the soils
cannot be disturbed and has no access required for residential development.” Complaint (Dkt.
1), ¶ IX (emphasis added); see also ¶ III (claiming the Sunny Beach property “is highly valuable,
sought after largely by summer residents . . . seeking lake cabins as second homes. . . . Sunny
Beach is appropriate for construction of homes.”); ¶ VII (“Defendant’s final agency decision also
places such restrictions on the property that there remains no economical [sic] viable use of the
property or in the alternative substantially diminished the value of the property from residential
lakeshore property to property that has no access nor value as residential lakeshore property.”)
(emphasis added). In short, Plaintiff claims that his ability to alienate the lake shore lots for
residential development has been taken. Id.

Plaintiff’s Appeal of the Revocation of the Section 401 Certification

Plaintiff appealed the MPCA’s revocation of the Section 401 Certification through a
contested case hearing, which was conducted by an ALJ from the Minnesota Office of

Page 15 of 33

At the hearing, Mark Wespetal, who is MPCA’s chief ISTS expert and a licensed
professional soil scientist, testified extensively regarding the Property’s wetland soil and how
those soils were not adequate for the septic systems that Bailey proposed. Wespetal Test., CCH
Tr. 382-466 (Ex. H). Wespetal analyzed the soils at all of the transect locations identified in the
Corps of Engineers’ August 2000 wetlands delineation. None of the soils analyses showed soil
adequate for standard mound septic systems. Id., CCH Tr. 419, 426 (Ex. H). Wespetal testified
that, given these inadequate soils, mound systems would weep and seep untreated or partially
treated sewage to the ground surface and nearby ground and surface waters. Id., CCH Tr. 40607, 446-49 (Ex. H). Wespetal further testified that these conditions posed an imminent public
health threat and could result in untreated pathogens entering the groundwater and nearby lake
creating public health problems. Id., CCH Tr. 447-48 (Ex. H). The witness concluded that
several MPCA rules would be violated, including rules prohibiting sewage discharges to ground
surface; and nuisance conditions would be created if residential development were permitted in
the Sunny Beach subdivision. Id., CCH Tr. 406-07, 449 (Ex. H).
Wespetal further analyzed the property to determine whether there was sufficient area on
each lot for two standard ISTS systems. Id., CCH Tr. 426-42 (Ex. H); MPCA Lot Size
Assessment, CCH Tr. Ex. 50 (attached hereto as Ex. K). Information relevant to the siting of
septic systems in the Sunny Beach subdivision had come to the attention of the MPCA following
its initial granting of a Section 401 Certification and even after the revocation. Through the
review of other agencies’ records, MPCA learned that substantial portions of Sunny Beach was
in a floodplain. Zdon Test., CCH Tr. 103-04 (Ex. H). Siting of septic systems in the floodplain

8

Page 16 of 33

increases the likelihood of ISTS failure, thereby endangering public health. As such, installation
of septic systems in the floodplain is prohibited. Id.
Both MPCA ISTS rules and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ shoreland
rules require non-wetland area sufficient for two standard systems. Westpetal Test., CCH Tr.
428 (Ex. H). This two-system requirement is needed because even well-designed, properly
maintained septic systems have a finite life (e.g. 25-50 years before plugging occurs), so
replacement land area is needed. Id., CCH Tr. 428-29 (Ex. H). Westpetal’s evaluation showed
that six lots did not have sufficient area and that another four lots were very small and required
additional site-specific investigation work to determine whether those four lots complied with
the area requirement. Id., CCH Tr. 433-34 (Ex. H); see also MPCA Lot Size Assessment (Ex.
K).
On October 3, 2003 the ALJ issued his findings of fact, conclusions and
recommendation, in which he “recommended that the [MPCA’s] revocation of the Section 401
Certification be affirmed.” ALJ’s Report at p. 15 (Ex. A). On January 16, 2004, Sheryl
Corrigan, Commissioner of the MPCA, issued a Statement of Issue, Findings of Fact and Order,
in which she “agree[d] with the ALJ’s Recommendation that MPCA’s revocation of the Section
401 Certification issued to Gary Bailey be affirmed.” See Statement of Issue, Findings of Fact
and Order (“Commissioner’s Order”), p. 6 (attached hereto as Ex. L). As the Commissioner
found:
The [MPCA] has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the proposed Sunny Beach project endangers human health and the
environment that the danger cannot be eliminated by modifying the
Section 401 certification. In particular, sewage is likely to be
discharged without adequate treatment. This situation exists
because there is no evidence of the existence of soil conditions at

the Sunny Beach project site that comply with MPCA’s individual
sewage treatment system (ISTS) rules. The discharge of sewage
without adequate treatment will create nuisance conditions and an
imminent public health threat and violate other MPCA rules (e.g.,
Minn. R. 7050.0210, subps. 1-2, Minn. R. 7060.0600, sup. 2,
Minn. R. 7080.0065, Subp. 4). Even if compliant ISTS soil existed
(they do not), several lots in the Sunny Beach plat do not have
adequate area to comply with the two-standard ISTS system
requirements of MPCA ISTS rules and the MDNR shoreland
regulations and these conditions endanger human health and the
environment.

ARGUMENT
A.

Standard of Review

Summary judgment is a “salutary method of disposition designed to secure the just,
speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.” Sweats Fashions, Inc. v. Pannill
Knitting Co., 833 F.2d 1560, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this
regard, the summary judgment procedure “is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural
shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed ‘to
secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.’” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1).
Summary judgment is appropriate under RCFC 56 when there are no genuine issues of
material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. RCFC
56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). “Only disputes over facts that

(“Disputes over facts which are not outcome determinative under the governing law will not
preclude the entry of summary judgment.”). Moreover, summary judgment may be awarded in a
takings case. See Allied-General Nuclear Servs. v. United States, 839 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir.)
(affirming summary judgment of takings claim), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 819 (1988); Tabb Lakes,
Ltd. v. United States, 10 F.3d 796 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (same).
B.

Background Principles of State Law Define the Contours of Plaintiff’s
Property Interest
1.

As a Threshold Matter, Plaintiff Must Demonstrate the
Existence of a Protected Property Right Before a
Taking Can Be Considered

The Federal Circuit has established a two part test to evaluate whether governmental
action amounts to a taking of private property for Fifth Amendment purposes. Conti v. United
States, 291 F.3d 1334, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002); M&J Coal Co. v. United States, 47 F.3d 1148,
1154 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The need for this two part test stems from the realization that the Court
must first determine whether the property owner has the right to put the property to the owner’s
proposed use. There are limitations to use inherent in all property, which preclude an owner
from deriving specific benefits from their property. See Members of Peanut Quota Holders
Ass’n, Inc., v. United States, 421 F.3d 1323, 1334-35 (Fed. Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 904
(2006) (holding that the government’s unilateral right to revoke peanut quotas established by
federal statute is inherent in the property owner’s rights); Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United
States, 379 F.3d 1363, 1374-77 (Fed. Cir. 2004), cert. denied 545 U.S. 1139 (2005) (fishing boat
owner and operator has no protected property interest in fishery permits granted by the
government); Colvin Cattle Co. v. United States, 468 F.3d 803, 808 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (reduction
11

in value of property resulting from cancellation of grazing lease on adjacent federal lands does
not represent a cognizable property interest). Thus, before turning to the question of whether the
government’s actions have effectuated a taking, “[f]irst, a court must evaluate whether the
claimant has established a ‘property interest’ for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. [Then],
[s]econd, once a court has determined that a property interest exists, it must determine whether a
taking occurred.” Conti, 291 F.3d at 1339; see also M&J Coal, 47 F.3d at 1154. As noted by
the Federal Circuit in Air Pegasus of D.C., Inc. v. United States, 424 F.3d 1206, 1213 (Fed. Cir.
2005), “we do not reach this second step without first identifying a cognizable property interest.”
Therefore, in every Fifth Amendment takings case, the issue of whether the Plaintiff
possesses a protected property interest is a threshold element of the Plaintiff's claim. See Air
Pegasus, 424 F.3d at 1212 (“First, as a threshold matter, the court must determine whether the
claimant has established a property interest for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment.”) (quoting
Am. Pelagic, 379 F.3d at 1372; Maritrans v. United States, 342 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003)
("First, a court must evaluate whether the claimant has established a 'property interest' for
purposes of the Fifth Amendment.") (citation omitted). If a plaintiff cannot establish a
cognizable property interest, plaintiff’s takings claim fails. See Am. Pelagic, 379 F.3d at 1372
(“If the claimant fails to demonstrate the existence of a legally cognizable property interest, the
court[’]s task is at an end”); Conti, 291 F.3d at 1339 (“However, if a claimant fails to
demonstrate that the interest allegedly taken constituted a property interest under the Fifth
Amendment, a court need not even consider whether the government regulation was a taking
under the analysis set forth in Penn Central”).

12

Case 1:02-cv-01078-VJW

Document 88

Filed 06/25/2008

Page 20 of 33

According to this legal framework, the Court’s inquiry into whether Plaintiff possessed a
protected property interest at the time of the alleged taking must begin with identifying the
property right alleged to have been taken and examining any limitations that are placed on the
use of the property by state background principles. See Air Pegasus, 424 F.3d at 1217 (limiting
review to the right alleged by plaintiff). In this manner, the court determines whether plaintiff’s
claimed property right is “a stick in the bundle of property rights” possessed by the plaintiff.
Am. Pelagic, 379 F.3d at 1376; M&J Coal Co., 47 F.3d at 1154, citing Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027
(noting that the threshold inquiry before the court must be to “inquire into the nature of the land
owner’s estate to determine whether the use interest proscribed by the governmental action was
part of the owner’s title to begin with, i.e., whether the land use interest was a ‘stick in the
bundle of property rights’ acquired by the owner”).
Plaintiff alleges, in this action, that his right to develop and sell the property for
residential development has been taken. As will be demonstrated below, Plaintiff has not
demonstrated that he possessed the right to develop or sell the property for residential
development. Indeed, state nuisance law specifically prohibited residential development of
Plaintiff’s property because septic systems could not safely be installed on the property.
2.

Plaintiff Bears the Burden of Demonstrating That a
Property Interest Exists

The Federal Circuit has repeatedly said that the burden of proving the existence of a
compensable property interest rests with the claimant. See Am. Pelagic, 379 F.3d at 1372 (“If
the claimant fails to demonstrate the existence of a legally cognizable property interest, the
court’s task is at an end”)(emphasis added); Maritrans, 342 F.3d at 1351 ("First, a court must
evaluate whether the claimant has established a 'property interest' for purposes of the Fifth
13

Case 1:02-cv-01078-VJW

Amendment.") (citation omitted)(emphasis added); Conti, 291 F.3d at 1339 (“However, if a
claimant fails to demonstrate that the interest allegedly taken constituted a property interest
under the Fifth Amendment, a court need not even consider whether the government regulation
was a taking under the analysis set forth in Penn Central.”)(emphasis added).
In the instant case, not only has Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a compensable property
interest in the development of his property for residential use, but the unrefuted evidence is to
the contrary. A manifest determination by the State of Minnesota that installation of septic
systems on the property would represent a public nuisance precludes Plaintiff, or any purchaser,
from developing the property for residential use.
3.

State Law Routinely Defines the Scope of a Plaintiff’s
Property Interest

In determining whether a plaintiff possesses a property right that is protected by the Fifth
Amendment, courts begin with the maxim that
[t]he Constitution neither creates nor defines the scope of property
interests compensable under the Fifth Amendment. Bd. of Regents of
State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548
(1972). Instead, “existing rules and understandings” and “background
principles” derived from an independent source, such as state, federal, or
common law, define the dimensions of the requisite property rights for
purposes of establishing a cognizable taking. Lucas[, 505 U.S. at] 1030
[(1992)]. These existing rules often involve and define “the citizen’s
relation to the physical thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of
it.” United States v. Gen. Motors, 323 U.S. 373, 378, 65 S. Ct. 357, 89
L.Ed. 311 (1945).
Conti, 291 F.3d at 1340. Stated another way, the threshold inquiry into whether a plaintiff
possesses a protected or cognizable property interest requires the court to determine whether the
particular property interest that a plaintiff contends has been taken is “a stick in the bundle of
property rights” possessed by the plaintiff. Am. Pelagic, 379 F.3d at 1376; M&J Coal, 47 F.3d
14

Case 1:02-cv-01078-VJW

at 1154 (noting that the court must first determine whether the use proscribed by the
governmental action was part of the owner’s title to begin with) (citing Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027).
Background principles of state law have served to defeat takings claims for over a
century, dating back to the Supreme Court’s determination that a law prohibiting the use and sale
of alcohol did not result in the taking of the plaintiff’s brewery. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623
(1887). As the Court recognized:
A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are
declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals,
or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a
taking or an appropriation of property for the public benefit. Such
legislation does not disturb the owner in the control or use of his
property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it,
but is only a declaration by the state that its use by any one, for
certain forbidden purposes, is prejudicial to the public interests. . . .
The power which the states have of prohibiting such use by
individuals of their property, as will be prejudicial to the health,
the morals, or the safety of the public, is not, and, consistently with
the existence and safety of organized society, cannot be, burdened
with the condition that the state must compensate such individual
owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their
not being permitted, by noxious use of their property, to inflict
injury upon the community.
Id. at 668-69.
The Supreme Court has oft relied upon the avoidance of deleterious property uses,
through the application of background principles of state nuisance and property law, as a basis
for finding that the government is not obligated to compensate a property owner when
governmental action restricts or prevents activities that constitute, or are similar to, a public
nuisance. The Court has affirmed that
[l]ong ago it was recognized that ‘all property in this country is
held under the implied obligation that the owner’s use of it shall
not be injurious to the community,’ . . . and the Takings Clause
15

Case 1:02-cv-01078-VJW

did not transform that principle to one that requires compensation
whenever the State asserts its power to enforce it.
Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass’n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491-92 (1987) (internal
citations omitted). As such, the Court found that
since no individual has a right to use his property so as to create a
nuisance or otherwise harm others, the State has not ‘taken’
anything when it asserts its power to enjoin the nuisance-like
activity.
Id. at 491 n. 20; see also Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272 (1928) (holding that Virginia was not
required to compensate owners of trees that were ordered destroyed to prevent a dendrologic
disease from spreading); and Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962) (holding that
a duly enacted ordinance limiting mining within town limits did not result in the taking of the
plaintiff’s property, even if it deprived the property of its most beneficial, where those
restrictions were designed to prevent nuisance-like consequences).7/
Justice Scalia reiterated the importance of state law in defining and limiting the property
interest held by a plaintiff in a takings action when he found it to be well established that
“independent source[s] such as state law” define “the range of interests that qualify for
protection as ‘property’ under the Fifth . . . Amendment[].” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1030 (citations
omitted). As such, before imposing liability on the government for a taking, Justice Scalia
recognized the need to determine what pre-existing limitations inhere in a plaintiff’s property
interest.

Justice Rehnquist also recognized this “nuisance exception” in the context of the just compensation
clause when the proposed property “use is dangerous to the safety, health, or welfare of others.” Penn
Central Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 145 (1978). He further wrote that “[a]s early as
1887, the Court recognized that the government can prevent a property owner from using his property to

It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses
of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various
measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercises of its
police powers; “[a]s long recognized, some values are enjoyed
under an implied limitation that must yield to the police power.”
Id. at 1027.8/ As the Court observed:
A law or decree with such an effect must, in other words, do no
more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the
courts – by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected
persons) under the State’s law of private nuisance, or by the State
under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the
public generally, or otherwise.
Id. at 1029 (footnote omitted).
The “nuisance exception” shield to the just compensation clause is not limited in its
application to state governments. In instances in which a federal action does nothing more than
duplicate the limitations inherent in property ownership, as defined by background principles of
state law, the federal government is also shielded from liability. For example, in Rith Energy,
the court found that a state-law statutory restriction on the creation of water pollution was a bar
to a takings claim against the United States. Rith Energy, Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 108,
115 (1999) (affirming that a state public health and safety statute is considered to be part of the
background principles of state nuisance and property law to which all property ownership is
subject), aff’d on other grounds, 247 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001). A similar result was reached in
John R. Sand & Gravel Co., where the Court found that when the federal government’s

In Lucas, the plaintiff challenged application of South Carolina’s Beachfront Management Act, which
prevented the erection of a house on coastal property. The Court held that a regulation which deprives an
owner of all “economically beneficial use” of his or her property is, “categorically,” a taking that requires
compensation. Justice Scalia noted, however, that no compensation would be due if the limitation on
property use was one which “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of
the State’s law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029

prohibition has done no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved under state
law nuisance principles, there has been no taking. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,
62 Fed. Cl. 556, 589 (2004), aff’d on other grounds, 457 F.3d 1345 (2006), aff’d 128 S.Ct. 750
(2008).
In short, Plaintiff’s property ownership does not give him the right to develop his
property in a way so as to endanger the public health or safety. Given the inability to install
septic systems in a safe manner on Plaintiff’s property, as determined by the relevant state
agency charged with making such determinations, the proposed development constitutes a
“public nuisance.” Thus, the right to sell the property at issue for residential development was
never a stick in the bundle of rights possessed by Plaintiff.

Minnesota Common and Statutory Laws of Nuisance
Prohibit Development that Includes Inadequate Septic
Systems

The right to be free from nuisance created by water pollution, including sewage
discharge, has long been recognized as actionable under Minnesota common and statutory law.
Nelson v. Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Cemetery Assoc., 126 N.W. 723 (Minn. 1910)
(actionable nuisance may result if cemetery is situated such that burials will contaminate water
of wells or springs); Satren v. Hader Co-op. Cheese Factory, 279 N.W. 361, 364 (Minn. 1938)
(discharge of manufacturing waste into river created an actionable nuisance); Huber v. City of

nuisance).9/ Indeed, as far back as 1927, the state legislature explicitly granted to the state courts
the jurisdiction to abate private nuisances arising from water pollution.
Anything which is injurious to health, or indecent or offensive to
the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to
interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, is a
nuisance. An action may be brought by any person whose
property is injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment is
lessened by the nuisance . . . .
Mason’s Minn. St. 1927, § 9580 (Minn. Stat. Ann. § 561.01 (2008)). And, the Minnesota
Supreme Court has held that the statutory law of nuisance is simply declaratory of the common
law definition of nuisance. Hall v. Stokely-Van Camp Inc., 106 N.W.2d 8, 10 (Minn. 1960)
(holding that canneries discharge of “waste liquids” into river that passed the plaintiff’s farm
constituted an actionable nuisance). In addition, the Minnesota Supreme Court has held that the
state’s police power appropriately extends to the disposal of sewage and control of pollution.
Minnesota Energy & Econ. Dev. Auth. v. Printy, 351 N.W.2d 319, 341-42 (Minn. 1984); County
of Pine v. State Dep’t. of Natural Res., 280 N.W.2d 625, 629 (Minn. 1979) (holding that the
limitation of pollution is a valid exercise of the State’s police power).

A classic nuisance is created where sewage discharges onto neighboring properties. Highview North

(sewage discharges to premises is actionable nuisance); Nienow v. Village of Mapleton, 174 N.W. 517

common law.10/ Indeed, the water quality regulations define water pollution with reference to
nuisance:
‘Pollution of water,’ ‘water pollution,’ or ‘pollute the water’
means: (a) the discharge of any pollutant into any waters of the
state or the contamination of any waters of the state so as to create
a nuisance or render such waters, unclean, or noxious, or impure so
as to be actually or potentially harmful or detrimental or injurious
to public health, safety or welfare . . . .
See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 115.01, subd. 13 (2008) (emphasis added).11/ The MPCA regulatory
program is specifically designed to establish water quality and purity standards that will avoid
actual or potential deleterious effects. See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 115.44, subds. 3-4 (2008); Minn.
R. 7050.0210, subp. 2 (2007) (nuisance conditions prohibited). Specifically, Minnesota has
determined that improper location of Individual Sewage Treatment Systems (or septic systems)
will adversely affect the public health, general welfare and safety by creating the potential for
discharge of inadequately treated sewage to the ground surface, surface water, and ground water
and have codified rules to prevent such nuisances. See Minn. R. 7080.0010 (2007). Most
importantly, because of the public health issues involved, the Minnesota Legislature has
determined that violation of the MPCA rules or standards constitutes a public nuisance that may
be enjoined. Minn. Stat. Ann. § 115.071, subd. 4.

Residential Development of Plaintiff’s Property Is
Prohibited Under Background Principles of Minnesota
Law of Nuisance

Based primarily upon the testimony of two experts in waste treatment and soil hydrology,
the ALJ and MPCA Commissioner determined that development of the Sunny Beach
Subdivision, including both installation of the road and development of residential lots, created a
nuisance under Minnesota law. As the Commissioner of the MPCA found in 2004,
The [MPCA] has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the proposed Sunny Beach project endangers human health and the
environment that the danger cannot be eliminated by modifying the
Section 401 certification. In particular, sewage is likely to be
discharged without adequate treatment. This situation exists
because there is no evidence of the existence of soil conditions at
the Sunny Beach project site that comply with MPCA’s individual
sewage treatment system (ISTS) rules. The discharge of sewage
without adequate treatment will create nuisance conditions and an
imminent public health threat and violate other MPCA rules (e.g.,
Minn. R. 7050.0210, subps. 1-2, Minn. R. 7060.0600, sup. 2,
Minn. R. 7080.0065, Subp. 4). Even if compliant ISTS soil existed
(they do not), several lots in the Sunny Beach plat do not have
adequate area to comply with the two-standard ISTS system
requirements of MPCA ISTS rules and the MDNR shoreland
regulations and these conditions endanger human health and the
environment.
Commissioner’s Order at ¶ 15 (Ex. L). The decision was based upon two separate, but related,
determinations made by the ALJ and confirmed by the Commissioner. First, and most
importantly, the MPCA determined that the saturated wetland soils in the Sunny Beach
subdivision could not safely sustain septic systems. Second, even if the soils in the Sunny Beach
subdivision could sustain septic systems, the MPCA determined that the majority of the lots in
the Sunny Beach subdivision had inadequate land outside of the floodplain to locate two separate
septic systems.

The State of Minnesota Has Conclusively
Determined that Installation of Septic
Systems in the Saturated Sunny Beach
Soils Would Create a Nuisance

MPCA’s licensed soil scientist analyzed the wetland soils in the Sunny Beach
subdivision to determine whether ISTS could be installed in compliance with the State’s health
and safety standards. Westpetal Test., CCH Tr. 382-466 (Ex. H). The state expert determined
that the soils were not adequate for a mound system, the type of system commonly used in areas
with wet soils. Id., 419, 426. Given these inadequate soils, mound systems would be expected
to weep or seep untreated sewage to the ground surface, the surface water and the ground water,
resulting in nuisance conditions and violations of MPCA rules. Id. 406-07, 446-49.
Based upon the testimony provided by the experts, the ALJ found conclusively that the
Sunny Beach project endangered human health and the environment because “sewage is likely to
be discharged without adequate treatment.” ALJ’s Report at ¶ 6 Ex. A). As the ALJ concluded,
the potential for danger to public health resulting from inadequate soil conditions on site
prevented the safe installation of septic systems. Commissioner’s Order at ¶ 15 (Ex. L). MPCA
found that the anticipated sewage discharges violated the following MPCA rules:
•

Minn. R. 7050.0210, subps. 1-2, which prohibits untreated sewage
discharges and nuisance conditions;

•

Minn. R. 7060.0600, subp. 2, which prohibits sewage discharges that
pollute ground water; and

•

Minn. R. 7080.0065, subp. 4, which prohibits ISTS seepage to ground
surface and sewage or sewage tank effluent discharges to ground surface
or surface waters.

The State of Minnesota Has Determined
that Many of the Sunny Beach Lots Are
Too Small to Support Septic Systems

The MPCA scientists evaluated the complications of siting septic systems in the Sunny
Beach lots, where significant portions of the property are in the floodplain, to determine whether
sufficient land area existed for mound systems. Westpetal Test., CCH Tr. 426-446 (Ex. H). The
analysis was done based upon the hypothetical assumption that soil conditions were adequate for
the installation of septic systems. As set forth above, soil conditions were not acceptable in the
Sunny Beach subdivision. A significant portion of the Sunny Beach subdivision lies within the
100-year floodplain.12/ ALJ’s Report at ¶¶ 35-36 (Ex. A). As a result, the MPCA determined
that six of the Sunny Beach lots definitively do not have sufficient land area to meet the MPCA
and MDNR rule that residential lots must be able to accommodate two standard septic systems.
Id. ¶ 37. Another four lots were very small and may not contain adequate land area to meet the
requirement. Id. Additional site-specific investigation would be required to determine whether
these four lots could meet the two-system requirement. Id. As with the inadequate soil
conditions, the MPCA determined that, given the inadequate lot sizes, the installation of septic
systems would endanger human health and the environment. Commissioner’s Order at ¶ 15 (Ex.
L).

12/

The MPCA did not learn that much of the Sunny Beach subdivision was within the floodplain until after
the Section 401 Certification was revoked, because Plaintiff had failed to apprise the agency of this fact
when submitting his permit application or in response to the Request for Information sent to Plaintiff by
the MPCA in July 1999. ALJ’s Report at ¶ 5 (Ex. A).

Because the Taking Alleged by Plaintiff Goes No
Further Than Limitations Under Minnesota’s
Background Principles of Nuisance, There Can Be No
Taking

In the instant case, Plaintiff fundamentally alleges that the Corps of Engineers took his
right to develop the Sunny Beach subdivision for residential purposes or alternatively his right to
alienate the lots within the Sunny Beach subdivision for the same purpose. Because background
principles of Minnesota’s law of nuisance – both the judicially created common law as well as
the law as codified by the legislature – prohibit the development of the Sunny Beach lots for
residential purposes, Plaintiff lacks any right to develop the lots or to alienate them for such
development. Plaintiff simply does not have such a stick in his bundle of property rights.
As the Supreme Court held in Keystone, the states exercise of its police power to prevent
a nuisance does not represent a taking, because property owners simply do not possess a right to
use their property so as to create a nuisance. Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass’n v. DeBenedictis,
480 U.S. 470, 491-92 (1987). Put simply, the government cannot take something that was never
a stick in the property owner’s bundles of rights. Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, 379
F.3d 1363, 1374-77 (Fed. Cir. 2004), cert. denied 545 U.S. 1139 (2005)
Indeed, a Maryland appellate court has addressed thes issue now before this Court in a
case with strikingly similar facts. Erb v. Maryland Dept. of Environment, 676 A.2d 1017, 102628 (Md. App. 1996). The court found that a regulatory agency’s denial of an ISTS permit was in
accordance with a regulatory program designed to prevent nuisances and, accordingly, the permit
denial did not constitute a taking. Id. Private nuisance law can abate discharges from sewage
disposal systems that are or may be detrimental to the public health; consequently, public
regulations designed to prevent these same nuisances do not constitute a taking. Id. Like Erb,
24

the MPCA’s actions to prevent acts that contravene public health and safety do not constitute a
taking. Nor do federal limitations that go no farther than the restrictions imposed under state
background principles. Rith Energy, Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 108, 115 (1999), aff’d on
other grounds, 247 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001); John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 62
Fed. Cl. 556, 562 (2004), aff’d on other grounds, 457 F.3d 1345 (2006), aff’d 128 S.Ct. 750
(2008).
The actions of the Corps of Engineers, at most, did nothing more than limit the use of the
Sunny Beach property to the same uses allowed under background principles of Minnesota law.
As such, the actions taken by the Corps of Engineers cannot be seen as a taking. In short, the
Corps of Engineers could not have taken something that Plaintiff never had.
III.

CONCLUSION
Because Plaintiff did not and does not have a property right to develop the Sunny Beach

subdivision for residential purposes as proscribed by background principles of state law, no such
interest could have been taken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Thus, Defendant
respectfully requests, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims, that its
