MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’
MOTION DISQUALIFY LARRY E. KLAYMAN AS COUNSEL
Defendants Judicial Watch, Inc. (“Judicial Watch”) and Paul J. Orfanedes (“Orfanedes”),
by undersigned counsel and pursuant to D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6, 1.7, 1.9 and 3.7,
hereby submit the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of their Motion
to Disqualify Larry E. Klayman and the Klayman Law Firm, P.C. (“Klayman”) as Counsel for
Plaintiff Peter Paul (“Paul”).
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff’s counsel, Klayman, must be disqualified from representing Paul as a result of
ethical violations arising from Klayman’s prior relationship with Judicial Watch and the conflicts
that arise from his representation of Paul and himself in litigation against Judicial Watch.
Klayman represents the Plaintiff, Paul, who is suing Judicial Watch in this action. Klayman is
the for General Counsel for Judicial Watch. He is also representing himself in litigation against
Judicial Watch in a separate matter. In light of his prior relationship to Judicial Watch, Klayman
possesses confidential information regarding Judicial Watch. By representing Paul, Klayman is
now in a position to disclose such information to Paul under circumstances that cannot be
monitored, and to use that information to gain an improper advantage in litigation against

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 2 of 23

Judicial Watch.
Klayman’s representation of Paul presents a conflict of interest because Klayman is
bound by ethics to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained while acting in the
fiduciary capacity of Judicial Watch’s General Counsel. In this position, Klayman was directly
involved with the matters that now form the basis of Paul’s Complaint. (See Compl. at ¶¶ 2 and
3; see also Legal Services Agreement, attached hereto as Ex. 1). As counsel to Paul, Klayman is
obligated to use any information he possesses to assist Paul in his suit against Judicial Watch.
Therefore, Judicial Watch is effectively without means to monitor the flow of information
between Klayman and Paul, because such communications can be masked by the attorney-client
relationship. 1 Moreover, the concern regarding Klayman’s ability to maintain the integrity of
Judicial Watch’s confidential information is heightened by his active animosity toward Judicial
Watch. Finally, Klayman will be a witness in this case as he was involved in the circumstances
from which this claim arises. Therefore, Klayman’s representation of Paul violates Rules 1.6,
1.7, 1.9 and 3.7of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the District of Columbia.
By virtue of this representation, Klayman is able to provide Paul with access to
confidential information belonging to Judicial Watch, the integrity of which Judicial Watch
otherwise would be able to protect under Rule 1.6 and the attorney-client privilege. As such, the
only recourse to ensure that Judicial Watch’s confidential information is not wrongfully used
against it, is disqualification of Klayman from representing Paul in this action. Judicial Watch
has no other option to maintain the ethical standards established by the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
1
Indeed, during Klayman’s deposition in a separate action, he was asked regarding
conversations with Paul. In response, Klayman refused to answer, citing the attorney client
privilege.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
This action arises out of an agreement between Paul and Judicial Watch that relates to
legal services. Judicial Watch is a not-for-profit educational organization that, on occasion,
provides legal services and/or legal assistance without cost to clients. Judicial Watch assisted
Paul with obtaining counsel in criminal matters and represented him on civil matters relating to
alleged wrongs by former President William Jefferson Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
(See Ex. 1).
Plaintiff Paul is a self-described whistle blower in connection with Hillary Rodham
Clinton’s 2000 Senate Campaign and alleges that he is “a leading figure in connection with
allegations of the Clinton’s illegal campaign fundraising.” (See Compl. at ¶ 88). He also alleges
that Judicial Watch agreed to provide unlimited legal services to him without cost or obligation.
(Id. at ¶ 17.) In the spring of 2005, the relationship between Paul and Judicial Watch ended. On
February 5, 2007, this action was filed against Defendants with SGR representing the Plaintiff.
On April 12, 2006, prior to the commencement of this action, Klayman sued Judicial
Watch and it President regarding a dispute based on his separation from the organization. 2 (See
Klayman v. Judicial Watch, Civil Action No. 1:06-cv-00670, D.D.C. 2006 (“Klayman I”); see
also Second Am. Compl., attached hereto as Ex. 2). Klayman is representing himself pro se in
Klayman I, which is currently pending before Judge Kollar-Kotelly. Notwithstanding his prior
representation of Judicial Watch, Klayman undertook representation of Paul in this action.
By way of background, Klayman was a founder of Judicial Watch and held the positions
of General Counsel, Treasurer and Chairman during his tenure with the organization.

2

As

Klayman joined Paul Orfanedes and Christopher Farrell as defendants in his Second
Amended Complaint.
3

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Page 4 of 23

General Counsel, Klayman was exposed to an array of privileged and proprietary information
regarding the organization. In particular, Klayman possesses confidential information regarding
Judicial Watch’s formation and management of the Legal Representation Agreement with Paul,
which is the document from which this case arises. Indeed, it was Klayman who accepted Paul
as a client of Judicial Watch.

After that, Klayman negotiated and executed the Legal

Representation Agreement with Paul. (See Ex. 1; see also Declaration in the Superior Court of
the State of California at ¶ 10, attached hereto as Ex. 3). The agreement was executed by
Klayman on March 20, 2001. From then until his separation from Judicial Watch on September
19, 2003, Klayman managed and directed Judicial Watch’s representation of Paul. (See Ex. 10 at
¶¶ 4-6; Exhibit 1). During that time, Klayman was Paul’s chief counsel and responsible for the
representation that is at issue in this case. Id.
Paul’s Complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by Judicial Watch’s representation
arising from claims of negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract (as construed
in the Court’s February 6, 2008, Memorandum Opinion and Order). Defendants have always
known that Klayman would be a fact witness in this litigation due to his involvement in the
underlying cases. As Judicial Watch’s General Counsel, Klayman negotiated, executed and
managed the Legal Representation Agreement with Paul. In addition, Defendants have recently
assembled evidence that indicates Klayman: (a) is in an attorney-client relationship with Paul;
(b) assisted in drafting the Complaint; and (c) represents Paul as counsel in this litigation.
In fact, Klayman admitted the level of his involvement when he wrote to Defendants and
asked for the contact information for the appropriate insurance carriers given the threats by Peter
Paul against JW, including filing suit. (See Copy of E-Mail Correspondence dated January 19,
2006, attached hereto as Ex. 12). In this email correspondence, Klayman specifically asked for
4

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 5 of 23

the carrier information so that he could defend himself:
“Finally given the threats by Peter Paul against JW, its current officers and
me, and his published statement that he was filing suit and taking other
legal actions, I ask again that you provide any and all relevant
correspondence concerning Peter Paul to me and report these matters to
the appropriate insurance carriers. I also need the name and contact
information so I can myself be in touch with them. The confidential
severance agreement provides explicitly that I am entitled to this
information immediately, so I can defend myself.”
See Id.
Nonetheless, at this point, Klayman freely admits that he is Paul’s attorney. In Klayman
I, Judicial Watch served document requests on Klayman that requested “All communications
between [Klayman] and Peter F. Paul.” (See Resp. to Req. for Produc. of Docs., Req. No. 12,
attached hereto as Ex. 4). In response, Klayman objected by asserting the “attorney-client and
attorney work product privileges.” (See Id.) Similarly, in an Opposition to one of the several
Motions to Compel that Defendants were required to file in Klayman I, Klayman affirmatively
states that he has been Paul’s counsel since 2005. (See Pl.’s Mem. of Points and Authorities in
Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Compel Resp. to Defs.’s Req. for Produc. of Docs., p. 11, attached
hereto as Ex. 5). If there was any question, all doubt was eliminated by Klayman’s appearance
as counsel for Paul in this case. (See Docket No. 15).
The allegations of Paul’s Complaint are carefully drafted to omit reference to Klayman.
This fact indicates that Klayman even participated in drafting the Complaint. For example, in a
Declaration filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, Paul states under oath that
Klayman was principally responsible for his extended incarceration in Brazil and New York.
(See Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 10 – 11). There are, in fact two entire paragraphs in the Declaration, both

5

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 6 of 23

leveling an array of accusations directly at Klayman, which do not appear in the Complaint. 3
(See Id.) As drafted, the Complaint refers to “Klayman” as “the Judicial Watch’s lawyer.”
Paul’s Complaint is carefully drafted to omit any allegation of wrongdoing on the part of
Klayman, by not mentioning Klayman by name and by referring to conduct that occurs only after
the date of Klayman’s departure from Judicial Watch. (See, e.g., Compl. at ¶¶ 3, 4, 14, 24 and
26).
While Defendants deny any wrongdoing on the part of Klayman towards Paul, the
“Klayman Free” nature of the allegations show that the Complaint was carefully drafted to
eliminate reference to Klayman. Further proof of efforts to cleanse references to Klayman is
demonstrated by an article written by Paul that originally contained extensive allegations against
Klayman and was later revised to eliminate any reference to Klayman. Compare “Judicial
Watch – A Watchdog that Bites the Hands that Feed it,” as posted on hillcap.org with “Judicial
Watch – A Watchdog that Bites the Hands that Feed it,” as posted on www.peterfpaul.com. (See
Ex. 6 and Ex. 7, respectively). 4

“In September, 2003, around the time I was finally returned to New York from Brazil by
U.S. federal agents, Klayman was dismissed by Judicial Watch, like a thief in the night, by the
very yes men he installed to rubberstamp his every whim. His loyal minions discovered major
unanswered questions about Klayman’s personal use of thousands of the millions in donated
funds that were received from thousands of donors.”
“Seemingly, for their own protection, they forced their founder and leader to quietly
disppear [sic] from the tax exempt trough that he created to fatten them all. So unheralded was
Klayman’s departure from Judicial Watch in September, 2003, that until 2005 most people I
have encountered were not aware that Klayman had in fact departed. Klayman never notified me
that he withdrew as my counsel when he left Judicial Watch in September, 2003. To this date,
my former Chief Counsel has never advised me that he no longer represents me. He literally
abandoned the representation of his client with no notice whatsoever!”
4
Interestingly, Defendants were recently approached by Paul regarding settlement in
which one of the offered elements was that “Mr. Paul will cooperate with Judicial Watch against
6

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 7 of 23

Klayman coordinated this litigation with Paul. Klayman eliminated all doubt as to the
cooperative effort in an April 30, 2007, letter authored by Klayman to raise money for Klayman I
in which he announced that “Peter Paul joins me in taking on Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch.”

5

(See April 30, 2007 Fundraising Letter, attached hereto as Ex. 9). In addition, before Paul’s
Complaint was served on Defendants or available for viewing on the Court’s PACER site, a full
copy of the Complaint, together with exhibits was posted on Klayman’s anti-Judicial Watch site
at the domain www.savingjudicialwatch.com.
Despite his obvious duties to Judicial Watch, Klayman has expended significant effort
over the past few years to harm the organization. Since his September 19, 2003, separation from
Judicial Watch, Klayman engaged in constant disputes with Judicial Watch, including the filing
of more than five lawsuits against Judicial Watch, its current Board of Directors and outside
general counsel. Klayman’s animosity toward Judicial Watch includes an extensive campaign of
distortion and misrepresentation that is published on websites and in direct mail, email and
national publications. Without question, Klayman’s objective is to harm Judicial Watch at all
costs. Klayman has made no effort to maintain Judicial Watch’s secrets and confidences.
Indeed, Klayman has gone so far as to represent individuals against Judicial Watch regarding
subject matters over which Klayman provided legal services to Judicial Watch as its General
Counsel.

Larry Klayman in regard to Klayman’s lawsuit.” February 15, 2008, Email from Colette Wilson,
attached hereto as Ex. 8. This offer demonstrates the conflicting nature of representation
currently faced by Klayman. Further, it evidences the shifting nature of alliance such that there
is no assurance regarding the integrity of Judicial Watch’s confidential information.
5
In this same letter, Klayman also makes extensive reference to the Cobas and Benson
matters, further confirming that Klayman has been the driving force behind all three lawsuits
against his former client.
7

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 8 of 23

As a result of Klayman’s participation in the underlying representation of Paul, Klayman
will also be a witness at the Paul trial.

While Klayman is not specifically named in the

Complaint, certain allegations allude to the alleged conduct of Klayman. (See Compl. at ¶¶ 3
and 21). To make matters worse, Klayman recently indicated to Judicial Watch that he now
represents Paul and therefore refuses to disclose any communications with Paul following his
separation from Judicial Watch. (See Ex. 4 at Req. No. 12; see also Ex. 5 at 11). As such,
Klayman is an adverse witness to Paul in this litigation.

Complicating these various

relationships even more is the ongoing ethical duties of Klayman in favor of his former client,
Judicial Watch.
Of vital concern to Judicial Watch is Paul’s access to confidential information concerning
Judicial Watch, which Klayman obtained during his representation of Judicial Watch as its
General Counsel. If Klayman is allowed to represent Paul, Judicial Watch will be forced to face
an opponent who has improper access to Judicial Watch’s confidences and secrets through
Klayman. This harm to Judicial Watch is concrete and particularized. Given Klayman’s enmity
toward Judicial Watch, the potential for disclosure of Judicial Watch’s confidences and secrets is
actual and imminent.

Defendants’ concern regarding these ethical violations is neither

conjectural nor hypothetical.
LEGAL ARGUMENT
Klayman is legally and ethically barred from representing Paul in the present matter.
Rules 1.6, 1.7 and 1.9 of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct preclude his acting as counsel
for an individual, such as Paul, whose interests are materially adverse to his former client,

8

Page 9 of 23

Judicial Watch. 6 D.C. Rule of Professional conduct 1.6 prohibits Klayman from knowingly
revealing a confidence or secret of his former client. 7

D.C. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7

prohibits Klayman’s representation in a matter that involves Paul, and a position to be taken by
Paul in that matter that is adverse to a position taken or to be taken by his former client, Judicial
Watch, in the same matter, even though Judicial Watch is represented by different counsel. 8

6
The Local Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia state that attorneys shall follow the Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted by the
District Columbia Court of Appeals. L.Cv.R. 83.15.
7
Rule 1.6 (Confidentiality of information) reads, in relevant part, as follows:
(a) Except when permitted … a lawyer shall not knowingly:
(1) Reveal a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client;
(2) Use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client to the disadvantage of the
client;
(3) Use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client for the advantage of the
lawyer or of a third person.
(b) "Confidence" refers to information protected by the attorney-client privilege under
applicable law, and "secret" refers to other information gained in the professional
relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate, or the disclosure of which
would be embarrassing, or would be likely to be detrimental, to the client.
8

Rule 1.7 (Conflict of interest: General rule) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:
(a) A lawyer shall not advance two or more adverse positions in the same matter.
(b) Except as permitted by paragraph (c) below, a lawyer shall not represent a client with
respect to a matter if:
(1) That matter involves a specific party or parties, and a position to be taken by
that client in that matter is adverse to a position taken or to be taken by another
client in the same matter, even though that client is unrepresented or represented
by a different lawyer;
(2) Such representation will be or is likely to be adversely affected by
representation of another client;
(3) Representation of another client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by
such representation; or
(4) The lawyer's professional judgment on behalf of the client will be or
reasonably may be adversely affected by the lawyer's responsibilities to or
interests in a third party or the lawyer's own financial, business, property, or
personal interests.
(c) A lawyer may represent a client with respect to a matter in the circumstances
described in paragraph (b) above if:
(1) Each potentially affected client provides informed consent to such
9

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 10 of 23

Moreover, unless Klayman intends to admit that he breached his fiduciary duty and committed
professional negligence, it is unlikely that he can pursue Paul’s claims with any diligence since
he was the attorney involved in the subject matter over which Paul litigates. Klayman violates
D.C. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.9 by representing one client against a former client in
substantially the same subject matter. 9

This prohibition is especially applicable where the

subject matter of the lawsuit relates to a matter that Klayman handled while he was General
Counsel for Judicial Watch. In addition, Klayman is precluded from acting as counsel in this
matter pursuant to Rule 3.7 of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct because Klayman is a
necessary witness.

Finally, Klayman’s disqualification from this matter would in no way

prejudice Paul as it is yet early in the litigation and Paul has other counsel at his disposal.
I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
This Court recognizes that disqualification of counsel is appropriate “when [1] the

conduct is in violation of the rules of professional conduct to the point of undermining the
court’s confidence in the vigor of counsel’s representation of his client or [2] where the attorney
is in a position to use confidential information concerning his client’s opponent gained from a
prior representation.” Steinbuch v. Cutler, 463 F. Supp. 2d 4, 7-8 (D.D.C. 2006) (citing Koller v.
Richardson-Merrell Inc., 237 U.S. App. D.C. 333, 737 F.2d 1038 (D.C. Cir. 1984), vacated on

representation after full disclosure of the existence and nature of the possible
conflict and the possible adverse consequences of such representation; and
(2) The lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide
competent and diligent representation to each affected client.
9

Rule 1.9. Conflict of interest: Former client.
A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent
another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's
interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former
client gives informed consent.

other grounds, 472 U.S. 424 (1985)). See also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43-46,
111 S. Ct. 2123 (1991) (stating that “a federal court has the power to control admission to its bar
and to discipline attorneys who appear before it”); Cauderlier v. Zambrana, 2006 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 85969, (D.D.C. Oct. 6, 2006); Pigford v. Veneman, 355 F. Supp. 2d 148, 166-167
(D.D.C. 2005) (citing Pigford v. Veneman, 217 F. Supp. 2d 95, 99-100 (D.D.C. 2002)). In
limited circumstances, an opposing party may move to disqualify counsel when “the continued
representation by opposing counsel threatened the non-client with immediate and actual harm by
creating the substantial risk to [its] right to a fair and just determination of [its] claims.”
Cauderlier, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85969 at *4 (D.D.C. Oct. 6, 2006). Under the circumstances
of this case, Klayman must be disqualified.
Klayman’s representation of Paul clearly satisfies the standard for disqualification as set
forth in Steinbuch. Klayman’s representation provides Paul with an unfair advantage over
Judicial Watch by providing him with access to confidential information acquired by Klayman in
his role as General Counsel to Judicial Watch. To fulfill his duty of loyalty to Paul, Klayman
must disclose to Paul any information concerning Judicial Watch learned through his
representation of the organization. In this way, confidences and secrets of Judicial Watch that
are in the possession of Klayman can easily be transferred to Paul under the protection of the
attorney-client relationship.
Not only are Judicial Watch’s confidences and secrets at risk, but Judicial Watch is now
hampered in its ability to coordinate with Klayman in connection with defending against Paul’s
allegations. Therefore, to ensure a fair trial for all parties, Klayman must be disqualified as
counsel. At this early stage of the case, there is little if any prejudice to Paul. Indeed, no
scheduling order has been issued at this point.

RULE 1.7 PROHIBITS KLAYMAN FROM REPRESENTING PAUL BECAUSE IT
COMPELS THE ADVANCEMENT OF ADVERSE POSITIONS
Klayman’s joint representation of Paul and himself creates conflicts of interest. His role

as counsel for both Paul and himself presents a direct conflict of interest under Rule 1.7. To
diligently and competently represent himself and Paul, Klayman will be required to take
contradictory positions in this case. Similarly, vigorous cross-examination will require him to
challenge his own credibility and that of Paul’s. In addition, by cooperating with Paul, Klayman
participates in a relationship designed to violate the legal rights of Judicial Watch through unfair
discovery methods.
1.

Rule 1.7 prohibits Klayman from advancing contradictory positions in this case

Rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct “is intended to provide clear notice of
circumstances that may constitute a conflict of interest.” Rule 1.7, Comment [1]. In certain
circumstances, a lawyer may never represent a client where a direct conflict of interest exists.
Those limited circumstances are set out in Rule 1.7(a), which reads: “A lawyer shall not advance
two or more adverse positions in the same matter.” There is no exception to the prohibition of
Rule 1.7(a), even if all affected clients waive the conflict. All other conflicts of interest will not
bar representation provided that all affected clients give informed consent and the lawyer
reasonably believes competent and diligent representation can be provided to each affected
client. Rule 1.7(c).
Additional considerations for evaluating Klayman’s conflicts of interest include the effect
on confidentiality of information and the duty to use all known information for the benefit of
one’s client. Comment [15] to Rule 1.7 reads, in relevant part:
A particularly important factor in determining the appropriateness
of common representation is the effect on client-lawyer
12

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 13 of 23

confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege. With regard to
the attorney-client privilege, the prevailing rule is that, as
between commonly represented clients, the privilege does not
attach.
(Emphasis added.) In light of Klayman’s former role as General Counsel of Judicial Watch, he
possesses extensive confidences and secrets relating to Judicial Watch’s relationship with Paul.
Armed with this information, Klayman has no alternative but to use it for Paul. Similarly,
Comment [16] to Rule 1.7 reads:
As to the duty of confidentiality, continued common representation
will almost certainly be inadequate if one client asks the lawyer not
to disclose to the other client information relevant to the common
representation. This is so because the lawyer has an equal duty
of loyalty to each client, and each client has the right to be
informed of anything bearing on the representation that might
affect that client's interests and the right to expect that the
lawyer will use that information to that client's benefit. See
Rule 1.4.
(Emphasis added).

Paul and Klayman are adverse in this litigation

By examining the remaining Counts in this case, together with sworn allegations
regarding Klayman, it is clear that Paul and Klayman are adverse. Count One alleges a breach of
contract premised on the Legal Representation Agreement between Paul and Judicial Watch.
Among the issues to be litigated will be the intent and meaning of this document. Klayman
assisted in the preparation of the agreement and executed it on behalf of his former client,
Judicial Watch. Following execution of the agreement, Klayman supervised implementation of
the Agreement for Paul. (See Ex. 10 at ¶ 6). One need only peruse the Motion for Status
Conference filed by Klayman on behalf of Paul to ascertain the contradictory nature of his
current positions. (See Docket No. 18).

Page 14 of 23

Count Two alleges that Judicial Watch and Mr. Orfanedes breached a fiduciary duty
owed to Paul “in the provision of faithful, competent and vigorous legal representation to
Plaintiff.” (See Compl at ¶ 63). Klayman was Paul’s chief counsel until his departure from
Judicial Watch in September of 2003.

(See Ex. 10 at ¶ 6). Klayman managed the relationship

between Judicial Watch and Paul. Id. Indeed, it was Klayman who assisted Paul with his
extradition efforts and the negotiations with the U.S. Justice Department Id.
Finally, Count Three, as interpreted by this Court, alleges a claim for professional
negligence by failing to “diligently pursue [Paul’s] goals”. (See Compl. at ¶ 73).

Paul alleges

that he spent approximately 27 months in pre-trial detention in Brazil before being extradited to
the United States. (See Id. at ¶ 4). During this entire time, Klayman represented Judicial Watch
as its General Counsel. (See Ex. 10 at ¶ 3).
While Paul fails to expressly name Klayman in the Complaint, Klayman’s roles as
counsel to Paul, and Paul’s dissatisfaction with Klayman’s services, are inescapable. However,
it is not necessary to assume adversity between Paul and Klayman, the Court need only read the
sworn testimony of Paul as set out in a Declaration that was filed in the Superior Court for the
State of California. (See Id. at ¶¶ 10 and 11). Indeed, Paul states that, but for the actions of
Klayman, he would have been able “to voluntarily return to the U.S. immediately, without any
extradition proceedings (as was my desire)”. (See Ex. 3 at ¶ 10). Counts Two and Three will
necessarily involve Paul’s allegations regarding representation by Klayman while he was
Chairman and General Counsel of Judicial Watch, as will Paul's alleged damages and the causes
thereof. (See Id; see also Exhibit 6). Moreover, even if Paul maintains that Klayman did not
breach any duty to him, Klayman’s representation during the extradition process is relevant to
considerations of causation and damages.

Klayman cannot competently and diligently represent himself and Paul without
taking contradictory positions

Although Klayman’s position in this lawsuit is unique, it presents a classic Rule 1.7(a)
situation – the advancement of one client’s position will necessarily be at the expense of the
other. Klayman is not able to competently and diligently represent Paul without taking a position
adverse to himself, which in turn will violate his fiduciary duty to Judicial Watch. To pursue
Paul’s allegations regarding breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence, Klayman will
need to challenge his own representation of Paul.
Similarly, Klayman cannot competently and diligently represent himself without taking a
position adverse to the allegations in Paul’s Complaint. If Klayman disputes that he breached a
fiduciary duty or that his practice fell below the applicable standard of care, then he is
technically faced with the obligation to discredit himself and prove that he breached duties of
care to Paul. In fact, this will be necessary in any event as Judicial Watch intends to confront all
of Paul’s allegations and defend its representation of Paul.
4.

Klayman is not capable of effective cross-examination without impeaching
himself

Further conflict will arise for Klayman when he takes the witness stand during this case.
He cannot effectively represent Paul without impeaching himself. Klayman cannot fulfill this
obligation when simultaneously defending his actions and attempting to inculpate the
organization he was acting for at that time. As this Court recognized, an attorney cannot
zealously impeach an opposing party witness, if that witness is a former client to whom the
attorney owes a duty of confidentiality. United States v. Davis, 780 F. Supp. 21 (D. D.C. 1991)
(stating that attorney should not be inhibited because of a potential breach of confidentially
toward a former client). In this case, Klayman will be required to zealously impeach Judicial
15

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 16 of 23

Watch in order to represent Paul. Moreover, Klayman cannot effectively cross-examine Judicial
Watch without relying on confidences and secrets shared within the bounds of their attorneyclient relationship, especially communications that arguably include the disclosure of Judicial
Watch’s privileged information.
III.

RULE 1.9 OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT PROHIBITS
KLAYMAN’S REPRESENTATION OF PAUL IN THIS LITIGATION BECAUSE
THE SUBJECT MATTER IS SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO KLAYMAN’S
ACTIVITIES AS GENERAL COUNSEL FOR JUDICIAL WATCH
The prohibition of Rule 1.7(a) is applied in the context of a former client by Rule 1.9,

which prohibits a lawyer from representing “another person in the same or a substantially related
matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client
unless the former client gives informed consent.” Rule 1.9. Recognizing the harm that may
result when an organization’s former attorney represents an individual against the organization,
Comment [3] to Rule 1.9 cautions that “knowledge of specific facts gained in a prior
representation that are relevant to the matter in question ordinarily will preclude such a
representation”.
As General Counsel and Chairman of Judicial Watch, Klayman was exposed to all of
Judicial Watch’s confidential and privileged information. Klayman also participated in the
formation and fulfillment the Legal Representation Agreement at issue in this litigation. (See
Ex. 10 at ¶¶ 4 and 5). He is cooperating with Paul and admits that he is counsel for Paul. (See
Ex. Nos. 4 and 5; see also Docket No. 15). This relationship violates Rule 1.9 because it directly
relates to Klayman’s position while he was General Counsel at Judicial Watch. Under his duty
of loyalty, Klayman is obligated to use all of his knowledge for the benefit of Paul. However,
under his duty of confidentiality to Judicial Watch, Klayman is obligated to maintain the secrecy

16

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 17 of 23

of this knowledge. In addition, Klayman’s conduct implicates Rule 4.4 because he is using
discovery methods that violate Judicial Watch’s legal rights, namely, the integrity of its
confidences and secrets.
Rule 1.9 of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct prohibits a lawyer from representing
“another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person’s interests are
materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed
consent.” D.C. Bar Appx. A, Rule 1.9. “When a lawyer has been directly involved in a specific
transaction, subsequent representation of other clients with materially adverse interests clearly is
prohibited.” D.C. Bar Appx. A, Rule 1.9, Comment [2]. Comment [3] to Rule 1.9 is particularly
relevant to these circumstances as it counsels that if a lawyer has knowledge of specific facts that
were obtained in the prior representation, which are now relevant to the current litigation, the
lawyer may not represent an adverse party. Comment [3] reads, in relevant part:
In the case of an organizational client, general knowledge of the
client's policies and practices ordinarily will not preclude a
subsequent representation; on the other hand, knowledge of
specific facts gained in a prior representation that are relevant
to the matter in question ordinarily will preclude such a
representation.
(Emphasis added.)
As General Counsel and Chairman of Judicial Watch, Klayman was exposed to all of
Judicial Watch’s confidential and privileged information. Klayman also participated in the
formation and fulfillment of the Legal Representation Agreement at issue in this litigation. (See
Ex. 10 at ¶¶ 4 and 5). Indeed, until his departure from Judicial Watch on September 19, 2003,
Klayman managed and directed the organization’s representation of Paul and acted as chief
counsel. (See Id. at ¶ 6). This litigation is directly related to Klayman’s efforts as Judicial

17

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 18 of 23

Watch’s General Counsel in relation to Paul. Therefore, Klayman may not now represent Paul,
who is an obviously adverse party to Klayman’s former client, Judicial Watch.
Under Rule 1.9, the only ethical means by which Klayman could proceed with his
representation of Paul is for Judicial Watch to provide its informed consent. To be clear, Judicial
Watch does not consent to Klayman’s representation of Paul, nor has Judicial Watch ever given
such consent previously.
IV.

UNDER RULE 1.6 OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT, KLAYMAN
CANNOT ETHICALLY REPRESENT PAUL WITHOUT DISCLOSING
CONFIDENCES AND SECRETS HE IS BOUND TO MAINTAIN
In connection with his role as General Counsel to Judicial Watch, Klayman was exposed

to an array of confidential information regarding the organization. Of particular interest to this
matter was Klayman’s exposure to confidential information concerning Judicial Watch’s
provision of legal services to Paul.
A fundamental principal of the lawyer-client relationship is that the lawyer will hold
inviolate that client’s confidences and secrets. This obligation is imposed on the Bar by Rule 1.6
of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which provides that, except when specifically permitted
under the Rule, a lawyer shall not knowingly reveal a confidence or secret of the client. As the
Rule further explains, “confidence” refers to information protected by the attorney-client
privilege under applicable law, and “secret” refers to other information gained in the professional
relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate, or the disclosure of which would be
embarrassing, or would be likely to be detrimental, to the client. D.C. Bar Appx. A, Rule 1.6(b).
These definitions, along with Rule 1.6(g), 10 make it clear that a lawyer’s ethical duty to preserve

10

Rule 1.6(g) reads, in part: “The lawyer's obligation to preserve the client's confidences
and secrets continues after termination of the lawyer's employment.”
18

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 19 of 23

a client’s confidences and secrets is broader than the attorney-client privilege. Moreover, a
lawyer’s obligation to preserve a client’s confidences and secrets continues after termination of
the lawyer’s employment. The objectives of the obligations under Rule 1.6 are to encourage
individuals to seek early legal assistance and to facilitate a full development of facts essential to
proper representation of a client. D.C. Bar Appx. A, Rule 1.6, Comment [2].
Although Klayman is no longer employed as Judicial Watch’s General Counsel, he
retains an ethical responsibility under Rule 1.6 to safeguard the information he acquired while
employed as its General Counsel. His attempt to represent Paul illustrates a patent disregard for
the ethical obligations conferred on him by Rule 1.6 as an attorney admitted to practice in the
District of Columbia. Further, Klayman cannot zealously represent Paul, as he is obliged to do
under D.C. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3, and simultaneously maintain Judicial Watch’s
confidences under Rule 1.6. Klayman cannot erase from his mind what he learned as Judicial
Watch’s General Counsel. Moreover, within the bounds of his attorney-client obligations to
Paul, Judicial Watch is unable to monitor or confine Klayman’s disclosures to non-confidential
information. As a result, Judicial Watch is severely prejudiced by Klayman’s abdication of
ethical responsibility in favor of his zealous advocacy for Paul, whether as plaintiff’s counsel or
merely as a cooperating witness.
V.

D.C. RULE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT 3.7 PROHIBITS KLAYMAN’S
REPRESENTATION OF PAUL BECAUSE HE IS A FACT WITNESS
Despite extraordinary efforts to conceal his obvious involvement, Klayman will certainly

be a necessary fact witness in this action.

Klayman negotiated and executed the Legal

Representation Agreement with Paul. Further, from March 20, 2001, until his separation from
Judicial Watch on September 19, 2003, Klayman managed and directed the organization’s

19

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 20 of 23

representation of Paul.
Aside from certain exceptions that do not apply in this case, Rule 3.7 provides that: “A
lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness.”
In this case, there is no doubt. Klayman will be a witness. Therefore, under Rule 3.7, Klayman
cannot simultaneously act as a necessary fact witness and as an advocate for Paul.
The prohibition against a lawyer testifying as a fact witness is established to “avoid
conflicts that arise when an attorney puts his or her own credibility at issue in litigation. Such
conflicts . . . may prejudice the opposing party, when the attorney’s testimony is given undue
weight by the fact fact-finder as a result of his dual role.” S.S. v. D. M., 597 A.2d 870, 877 (D.C.
1991). As the Rule contemplates, witnesses are expected to testify from personal knowledge
while attorneys are expected to comment and analyze evidence. When the attorney of record
testifies, a fact-finder is prone to confusion regarding whether the attorney is providing facts for
evidence or merely commenting on facts. In this case, the potential for confusion is compounded
by the added potential for prejudice because the attorney in question is Judicial Watch’s former
General Counsel.
VI.

KLAYMAN’S REPRESENTATION OF PAUL IS CAUSING IMMINENT AND
ACTUAL HARM TO JUDICIAL WATCH AND THE INTEGRITY OF ATTORNEY
ETHICS
The relative positions of Judicial Watch, Paul and Klayman present a unique set of

circumstances that requires this Court to apply a heightened review. See Zachair, Ltd. v. Driggs,
965 F. Supp. 741, 754 (D. Md. 1997) (recognizing that dual representation in circumstances
similar to this action greatly intensifies the potential that “confidential information will be
disclosed in the ex parte setting”).

Judicial Watch’s former General Counsel is currently

representing an individual who is suing Judicial Watch for professional negligence in a
20

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 21 of 23

relationship that was managed by the former General Counsel. Klayman, as the former General
Counsel, owes Judicial Watch a duty of confidentiality under Rule 1.6. However, due to the
scope and nature of Klayman I, as well as Klayman’s admitted attorney-client relationship with
Paul, Klayman has undoubtedly used confidential information regarding Judicial Watch that
results in an unfair advantage in this case. Moreover, Klayman’s hostility toward Judicial Watch
raises a question of whether he entered into his current relationship to Paul to pursue his vendetta
against Judicial Watch by using confidences and secrets under the cloak of his attorney-client
relationship. Under these circumstances, neither Judicial Watch nor the Court is in a position to
police the appearance of impropriety currently existing.
It is difficult to imagine a greater breach of ethical integrity than for Paul to be
represented by Judicial Watch’s former General Counsel in a relationship that is engineered to
preclude any manner of oversight to guard against the use of Judicial Watch’s privileged
information. This circumstance is patently unfair and unethical. Judicial Watch did not consent
to Klayman’s relationship with Paul or the disclosure of any information. In fact, Klayman’s
Confidential Severance Agreement with Judicial Watch expressly requires that he not disclose
trade secrets or other proprietary information. Exhibit 11 at ¶ 4.
Klayman’s representation of Paul also undermines this Court’s confidence in the vigor of
the representation of Paul by Klayman (who is actually an unnamed defendant in this action).
See Steinbuch, 463 F. Supp. 2d at 7-8.

Under any objective standard, Klayman cannot

reasonably believe that a direct conflict does not exist. See Rule 1.7, Comment [7] (stating that
the belief a lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to the affected
clients is judged by objective, and not subjective, reasonableness). In this action, Klayman’s
representation of Paul results in clear and direct conflicts of interest. Moreover, the apparent
21

Case 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Document 21-3

Filed 04/22/2008

Page 22 of 23

transfer of Judicial Watch’s confidential information demonstrates immediate and actual harm to
Judicial Watch that cannot be cured.
VII.

PAUL WILL SUFFER NO PREJUDICE AS A RESULT OF KLAYMAN’S
DISQUALIFICATION
Given that it is still early in the litigation, Paul will suffer no prejudice by the

disqualification of Klayman. Indeed, discovery has not yet begun and no scheduling order has
been issued. Moreover, as evidenced by a February 15, 2008 e-mail, Paul is currently being
represented by another attorney, D. Colette Wilson. (See Ex. 8). Ms. Wilson’s e-mail proposes a
settlement wherein one of the offered elements is that “Mr. Paul will cooperate with Judicial
Watch against Larry Klayman in regard to Klayman’s lawsuit.” Clearly, Paul does not rely on
Klayman’s representation so much that he cannot afford to make him his adversary.
In contrast, historical protections provided by the attorney-client relationship will be
eroded and Judicial Watch will be severely prejudiced if its former General Counsel is allowed
to represent the adverse party, Paul, in this matter. As General Counsel, Klayman was privy to
confidential information regarding the subject matter of this case. Not only is this information
retained in Klayman’s memory, but given his open hostility toward the Defendants, it is unlikely
that he will refrain from using it, regardless of his ethical duties. Indeed, one need only review
the Motion for Status Conference to confirm Klayman’s intent to trade on his former client’s
confidential information. (See Docket No. 15).
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, for all of the forgoing reasons, Defendants Judicial Watch, Inc. and Paul
J. Orfanedes respectfully request that the Court GRANT this Motion and disqualify Larry E.
Klayman and the Klayman Law Firm, P.C. as counsel for Plaintiff Peter Paul.

Civil Action No. 1:06-CV-00670
Honorable Colleen Kollar-Kotelly

Jury Trial Demanded.

PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION
TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff, Larry Klayman (“Klayman”), by undersigned counsel, hereby submits this
memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents and Memorandum of
Law (the “Motion”). For the reasons that follow, the Motion must be denied.
I.

INTRODUCTION
A.

Background

Defendants bring the Motion in bad faith. Defendant, Judicial Watch, is a non-profit
501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to investigate and prosecute governmental corruption
and abuse. As founder, Chairman and General Counsel of Judicial Watch, Klayman headed the
organization until he voluntarily resigned to run for the United States Senate from the State of
Florida in September 2003. Defendants, Thomas Fitton, Paul Orfanedes, and Christopher Farrell
were the beneficiaries of Klayman’s leadership and, however hotly contested, currently run
Judicial Watch. 1 Defendant’s recent newsletter to donors states that “Judicial Watch Finishes

1

Klayman’s stewardship of Judicial Watch was known for its non-partisanship, even suing Vice President Cheney’s
Energy Task Force, leading to a Supreme Court review. Under Fitton, Judicial Watch has leaned strongly pro-Bush

2006 on an Upswing” and charts that donations in 2004 were about $8 million and for 2006 were
close to $10 million. A copy of an excerpt from the Judicial Watch Newsletter, Verdict, dated
June 2007 is attached hereto as Exhibit “A.” The Defendants’ assets are believed to be in excess
of this amount and Plaintiff, Larry Klayman, is an individual with greatly less resources to wage
a discovery war of attrition, as is occurring here for tactical purposes.
On September 19, 2003, Klayman and Judicial Watch executed a detailed Severance
Agreement. This action arises from Klayman’s claims that Judicial Watch violated multiple
provisions in the Severance Agreement, that Defendants misused Klayman name and/or likeness
for their benefit and to Klayman’s detriment, defamed and disparaged Klayman to third parties,
including the media and supporters, failed to provide documentation or access to Klayman’s
personal property and that of his law firm, Klayman & Accosiates, P.C. (“K&A”), and severely
harmed Klayman and even his minor children in other ways. On June 14, 2006, Klayman filed
the Second Amended Complaint. On or about June 28, 2006, Defendants filed their Answer and
Counterclaim, and on December 3, 2007 further to the Memorandum Opinion dated December 3,
2007, Defendants filed an Amended Counterclaim.
Immediately upon Klayman’s separation, fearing that Klayman, who founded and whose
name was synonymous with Judicial Watch, Defendants breached the Severance Agreement and
continue to harass and harm Klayman, in an obvious attempt to keep him from ever competing
with or even returning to the public interest group he conceived of, founded, invested in and
successfully ran for nearly ten years. Prior to commencing this action, Klayman repeatedly
sought access to his property and documentation regarding fraudulent expense claims and other
matters, but Defendants unreasonably refused to cooperate. They even refused and failed to

administration and has lost its non-partisanship and “legal” punch. At his law firm, Klayman has sued the
Administration for illegal wiretaps and other violations of civil liberties.

remove him as the personal guarantor of a multi-million dollar office lease, all the while
claiming incredulously that Klayman was a mere employee. Instead, rather than filling the
chairmanship with a lawyer of stature like former Congressman, Bob Barr, Defendants, two of
which are not lawyers, seized control of Judicial Watch and embarked on a campaign of smears
and lies to harm Klayman and his family, for which Klayman sought relief from the Court.
B.

Defendants Bad Faith In Discovery and Procedural History

Defendants served discovery requests on or about June 13, 2007. Klayman served
discovery requests on or about June 29, 2007. Counsel informally reached out by telephone on
or about July 13, 2007 to advise that due to scheduling conflicts, responses were still being
prepared and would be served promptly, which they were. Opposing counsel did not respond
and counsel operated under the assumption that this brief extension was acceptable. Opposing
counsel was aware at that time that Klayman was preparing responses and that responses would
be provided as soon as possible. Klayman served responses promptly thereafter. Defendants
suffered no prejudice, and in fact, there is no claim of prejudice anywhere in the Motion, nor
could there be. They acquiesced in what, in effect, was an extension of time to respond.
At the same time, Defendants did not produce any documents and failed to provide any
substantive responses. Instead, on October 16, 2007, to try to throw a monkey wrench into
discovery, Defendants filed a Motion for Protective Order seeking, inter alia, to deem all
discovery as confidential and virtually sealed, and sought “attorneys’ eyes only” protection to
prohibit Plaintiff, Klayman, an attorney in good standing in the District of Columbia for about 28
years, from seeing any of the discovery in his case. On December 3, 2007, the Court denied in
part, Defendants’ Motion for Protective Order, and entered a Protective Order to ensure that the

“use of any information obtained during discovery in limited to the strict context of this
litigation” (the “Protective Order”). See Memorandum and Order at Docket No. 84.
As established below, Klayman seeks discovery from Defendants in order to develop his
case. Klayman is an individual, not a multi-million dollar enterprise like Judicial Watch, who
was severely harmed by Defendants, a non-profit organization with an admitted $10 million in
donations per annum, notwithstanding a Directors and Officers’ Insurance policy which finances
Defendants’s litigation costs. Defendants further damaged Klayman by litigating to hide
information necessary to Klayman’s claims. While engaging in petty and vexatious motion
practice to further harass Klayman to have him “run up the bill,” they have again prejudiced
Klayman. Despite entry of the Protective Order on December 3, 2007 and Klayman’s demands
that Defendants comply with their discovery obligations, Defendants purportedly made
documents available for inspection and copying only on December 21, 2007, the eve of the
Christmas/New Years holiday, after Defendants’ counsel advised that his office was already
closed and would not be open again until after the holiday, on December 26, 2007. See Email
correspondence from Defendants’ counsel dated December 21, 2007 attached hereto as Exhibit
“B.” In making inconceivably only two small boxes of documents2 “available” for inspection at
counsel’s location on December 21, 2007, Defendants outrageously refused to produce any
copies, and glibly advised that if Plaintiff wanted copies, counsel would have to make
arrangements to pick up boxes after business hours and have copied at his own expense only
after his office had closed for the holiday. This stunt is consistent with the way Defendants have
2

The assertion that only two boxes are being made available indicates to Klayman the insufficiency of
Defendants’ response, particularly given Klayman’s 10 year role at Judicial Watch and the issues
involved in this case. However whether Defendants satisfied their discovery obligation is not only
unlikely, but also unknowable until Klayman has had an opportunity to review this production, since
substantive responses to discovery requests were also purportedly withheld pending the Court’s
disposition of the Defendants’ Motion for Protective, which was denied in part. See Docket Number 84.
To date, Klayman has received no documents while Plaintiff has produced documents to Defendants.

litigated this case. See Id. As a result, Klayman is prejudiced by Defendants’ failures regarding
their obligations in discovery as Klayman cannot proceed to develop his case, and was forced to
notice depositions within the discovery deadline. Defendants are simply engaged in a one-sided
abuse of court process.
The overall discovery deadline in this case is May 15, 2007. On November 26, 2007,
based on the current pace of discovery, as no documents had been exchanged by Defendants,
since no experts were identified by the parties and no other dates would be affected, the parties
filed a Consent Motion to extend the fact discovery deadline to January 31, 20083, which was
granted by the Court.
Defendants now engage in vexatious and petty motion practice, and in bad faith seek to
prejudice Klayman by having the Court sanction their game of one-upsmanship and their fishing
expedition for irrelevant discovery, simply because they ask for it. Minebea Co. v. Papst, 2005
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19417 (D.D.C.)(the “mere ipse dixits of counsel will not warrant the ordering a
fishing expedition”). Defendants waited four months to raise any alleged deficiency, including
the incorrect claim that Klayman waived any objections. Discovery is ongoing, no trial date has
been set, and while depositions have been noticed by the parties, none have thus far been taken.
II.

ARGUMENT
A.

Timeliness of Objections and Relevance

As to the timeliness of Plaintiff’s objections, Klayman respectfully submits that as
explained above, none are waived in this case, and assert the same generally and specifically to
the argument as to each request as proffered by Defendants in the Motion.

3

Based on the pace of discovery and motions pending at that time, Klayman’s counsel suggested consenting to
March 1, 2008 as the fact discovery deadline, but Defendants have thus far declined consent beyond January 31,
2008.

In the Motion, Defendants claim that irrelevant information is discoverable. As a
threshold matter, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 provides in pertinent part:
Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows:
Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant
to any party’s claim or defense--including the existence, description, nature,
custody, condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and the
identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good
cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter
involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if
the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Based on the clear language in Rule 26, relevance is a threshold matter
and to the extent requests seek other than relevant information, they are objectionable. Klayman
maintains his justifiable position that relevant information is responsive to the requests.
B.

Document Requests

Klayman’s arguments in opposition to each request as set forth in Defendants’
Memorandum of Law are as follows:
REQUEST NO. 1:
This request seeks any documents reviewed or consulted in preparing responses to
Defendants’ Interrogatories. Klayman did not object to producing documents identified in the
Answers to Interrogatories, and has produced those documents. Klayman objected to the request
only, out of an abundance of caution based on Defendants conduct in this litigation to harass and
harm Klayman by engaging in a fishing expedition, to the extent Defendants seek more.
Therefore, the request was answered, and the Motion is gratuitous, vexatious and petty, and only
intends to run up Klayman’s costs in this litigation.4
REQUEST NO. 2:

4

Notwithstanding Defendants’ large war chest of funds, they are covered by a Directors and Officers’ Insurance
policy which is providing the defense cost of this litigation.

This request seeks all documents to support Klayman’s claim that Defendants misused
and/or misrepresented Klayman’s name and/or likeness for fundraising activities, Klayman
properly responded that relevant documents evidencing Klayman’s calculation of damages will
be produced.
Here, in fact, documents were produced. Klayman objected to the request only, out of an
abundance of caution based on Defendants conduct in this litigation to harass and harm Klayman
by running up the cost of litigation and by engaging in a fishing expedition, especially to the
extent the request seeks irrelevant information.
Moreover, discovery is ongoing, no trial date has been set, and while depositions have
been noticed by the parties, none have been taken. Now, Defendants are engaged in one-sided
discovery, including petty and vexatious motion practice, all the while failing themselves to
produce documents, that is not until the eve of Christmas and New Years holidays, although
Plaintiff has seen no documents to date. Only then did opposing counsel say Plaintiff could copy
their obviously insufficient “production” after their office had closed for the holiday.
Information related to Defendants’ conduct, which is partly the subject of Request No. 2, to the
extent within the possession of Klayman, has been produced. Thus, the Motion as to this request
is moot.
REQUEST NOS. 3 and 4:
In these requests, Defendants seek all documents relating to Klayman’s damages and
claim that Defendants defamed Klayman in a false light. Klayman did not object and in fact
provided documents in response to these requests pursuant to the Protective Order, and is
preparing additional documents for further production. Based on the clear language in Rule 26,

relevance is a threshold matter and to the extent requests seek other than relevant information,
they are objectionable. Thus, the Motion as to these requests are moot.
REQUEST NO. 5:
In this request, Defendants seek all documents relating to the Severance Agreement.
Plaintiff properly objected to this request as vague, ambiguous and overly broad, and because it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. The
Severance Agreement dated September 19, 2003 is central to the claims of both parties in this
case, and neither party has challenged its validity or the contents of what it provides. Moreover,
the parol evidence rule applies. In fact, both parties have attached the Severance Agreement
itself to its pleadings. By its own terms, the Severance Agreement represents the agreement at
that time between the parties. The request is vague and ambiguous because it could be read to
encompasses a host of document categories including drafts, communications between the
parties’ and counsel, notes or other such ancillary documents. Klayman is unable to discern
from the request, other than the Agreement itself, what documents it seeks. Clearly, since there
is no challenge to the Agreement itself, other than the hard facts that Defendants breached it in
numerous ways, documents pertaining to its formation, including privileged communications, to
the extent such documents are the intent of this vague request, would not be not relevant.
Therefore, the objection is proper and must be sustained.
REQUEST NO. 6:
In this request, Defendants seek all documents relating to Klayman’s claim that
Defendant, Fitton, would find a successor to Klayman as head of Judicial Watch, Klayman did
not object and in fact provided documents in response to these requests pursuant to the

December 3, 2007 Protective Order, and is preparing additional documents for further
production. Thus, the Motion as to this request is moot.
REQUEST NO. 7:
In this request, Defendants seek documents related to the calculation of money owed to
“you” by Judicial Watch. Klayman did not object to this request, but pointed out that documents
related to the personal expenses owed to Klayman are in the possession and custody of
Defendants, and have been improperly withheld under the terms of the Severance Agreement and
discovery in this case. As alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, Klayman left Judicial
Watch in September, 2003, and subsequently, Judicial Watch denied Klayman access to
information, including account statements, receipts and other documentation to substantiate his
claim that money was owed to Klayman by Judicial Watch. Klayman served discovery requests
on June 29, 2007, which included requests for documents in connection with property owned or
purchased by Klayman and his law firm, Klayman & Associates, prior to the separation.
Defendats claim to have made documents available only on December 21, 2007, but to date,
Klayman has not yet seen any documents. Thus, documents essential and necessary to any
computation of damages were not within Klayman’s possession or custody. Therefore, Klayman
can not, at this time, respond fully to this request, other than as stated.
REQUEST NO. 8 and 9:
In this request, Defendants seek all documents relating to Klayman’s efforts to reclaim
his property, including artwork, from Judicial Watch. Klayman did not object to this request,
and in fact provided documents in response to this request pursuant to the December 3, 2007
Protective Order, and is preparing additional documents for further production. Thus, the
Motion as to this request is moot.

Additionally, documents related to the Klayman’s property and the property itself are
“conveniently” in the possession and custody of Defendants. Klayman served discovery requests
on June 29, 2007, which included requests for documents in connection with property owned or
purchased by Klayman and his law firm, Klayman & Associates, prior to the separation.
Defendats claim to have made documents available only on December 21, 2007, but to date,
Klayman has not yet seen any documents.
Further, based on the clear language in Rule 26, relevance is a threshold matter for any
discovery and to the extent requests seek other than relevant information, they are objectionable.
Relevant documents are responsive to discovery requests. Klayman is hardly arrogating to
himself any power to determine what is relevant and is producing documents pursuant to the
December 3, 2007 Protective Order. Thus, the Motion as to this request is moot.
REQUEST NOS. 10 and 11:
In these requests, Defendants seek documents related to Klayman’s position as guarantor
of any Judicial Watch credit cards and Judicial Watch’s headquarters building. Klayman did not
object to this request, and in fact provided documents in response to this request pursuant to the
Protective Order, and is preparing additional documents for further production. Thus, the
Motion as to this request is moot.
Additionally, Klayman served discovery requests on June 29, 2007, which included
requests for documents in connection with Judicial Watch’s continued refusal to remove
Klayman as guarantor of Judicial Watch credit cards and Judicial Watch’s headquarters building.
Defendants claim to have made documents available only on December 21, 2007, but Plaintiff

has not seen any documents to date. Klayman needs these documents to assess the risks and
liabilities associated with Defendants’ failure. 5
REQUEST NO. 12:
In this request, Defendants seek all communications between Klayman and Peter F. Paul.
On its face, the request is objectionable. The request fails to specify any time frame or scope,
and is vague because it broadly seeks communications. Moreover, Klayman objected on the
grounds that the request seeks information subject to the attorney client privileged work product
doctrine. From about 1999, Paul was represented by Klayman and Judicial Watch until
Klayman’s separation in September 2003. Thereafter, Paul was a client Judicial Watch until
April, 2005. Paul was then represented by Klayman. In the Motion, Defendants suggest that
Klayman’s association with Paul is relevant to their claims of non-disparagement under the
Severance Agreement. Defendants should not be permitted to engage in such a broad and
specious fishing expedition for all communications.
To the extent Defendants can narrow this request, Klayman will review such a request
and respond accordingly, including providing an appropriate privilege log. Thus, the objections
to this request are proper and must be sustained.
REQUEST NO. 13:
In this request, Defendants seek documents relating to the approval of payment of family
health insurance coverage for Klayman and his family by Judicial Watch. Klayman did not
object and in fact provided documents in response to these requests pursuant to the December 3,
2007 Protective Order, and is preparing additional documents for production. Thus, the Motion

5

Demonstrative of Defendants’ dishonest representations to the public and this Court, is the claim that Klayman
was a mere employee. Does a mere employee guarantee a multi-million dollar lease and credit cards,
notwithstanding Klayman’s having conceived of and founded the organization for more than 10 years?

as to this request is moot. Additionally, Klayman incorporates by reference his arguments
regarding request number 8.
REQUEST NO. 14:
In this request, Defendants seek documents relating to Judicial Watch’s obligation to
reimburse Klayman pursuant to paragraph 10 of the Severance Agreement. Klayman did not
object and in fact provided documents in response to these requests pursuant to the December 3,
2007 Protective Order, and is preparing additional documents for production. Thus, the Motion
as to this request is moot. Additionally, Klayman incorporates by reference his arguments
regarding request number 8.
REQUEST NO. 15:
In this request, Defendants seeks all documents relating to Klayman’s repayment of
Klayman & Associates, P.C.’s debt to Judicial Watch pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Severance
Agreement. Klayman did not object to this request, and in fact provided documents in response
to this request pursuant to the Protective Order, and is preparing additional documents for further
production. Thus, the Motion as to this request is moot.
REQUEST NOS. 16 and 17:
In these requests, Defendants seek all documents that Klayman produced subsequent to
the severance date which contains the term “Judicial Watch” and “Because No One is Above the
Law!” Klayman properly objected to these requests as grossly overbroad because there is no
limitation to the documents that may apply. Also, the term “produced” is undefined, and could
apply to not only distributed material that may reference the term Judicial Watch, but any other
internal or errant reference in any document.

To the extent Defendants can narrow this request, Klayman will review such a request
and respond accordingly. Thus, the objections to these requests are proper and must be
sustained.
REQUEST NOS. 18 and 19:
In these requests, Defendants seek each and every mailing that Klayman caused to enter
the United States mails from or regarding “Saving Judicial Watch” and “Freedom Watch.”
Klayman properly objected to these requests as overbroad and burdensome. In effect, the request
fails to identify any time period and is unlimited in scope as to each and every piece of addressed
mail that Klayman, or third parties on Klayman’s behalf, has ever caused to be sent out from or
regarding “Saving Judicial Watch” and “Freedom Watch,” and the “issue” of Freedom Watch is
irrelevant in any event. Thus, on their face, these requests are patently burdensome and are
meant to be harassing.
Defendants waited four months to claim any alleged deficiency while at the same time
failing to produce even a single document themselves. Further, Defendants’ claims that these
records are relevant to Klayman’s alleged breach of the non-competition clause of the Severance
Agreement is incorrect, and underscores the vastly overbroad scope of Defendants’s requests.
The non-competition clause expired in September 2005, while the requests are unlimited in time.
Based on the clear language in Rule 26, relevance is a threshold matter for any discovery
and to the extent requests seek other than relevant information, they are objectionable.
Relevant documents are responsive to discovery requests. Klayman is hardly arrogating to
himself any power to determine what is relevant and is, in fact, producing documents pursuant to
the December 3, 2007 Protective Order.

Finally, to the extent Defendants can narrow this request to include only exemplars of
mailings, Klayman will review such a request and respond accordingly. Thus, the objections to
these requests are proper and must be sustained.
REQUEST NO. 20:
In this request, Defendants seek each and every press release issued by Klayman
subsequent to the severance date. Klayman incorporates by reference his arguments regarding
request numbers 19 and 20.
REQUEST NO. 21:
In this request, Defendants seek all documents regarding Klayman’s work with
RightMarch.com. Klayman incorporates by reference his arguments regarding request numbers
19 and 20. Klayman’s alleged activities concerning RightMarch are irrelevant in any event.
C.

Sanctions Against Klayman Must Be Denied

Plaintiff promptly responded to the discovery requests raised in the Motion. Defendants’
position that Plaintiff waived any objections is incorrect, and unjust. Defendants are not
prejudiced by Klayman’s response, and indeed no such prejudice is demonstrated anywhere in
the Motion. Defendants waited four months to raise any issues of alleged deficiency in
Klayman’s responses, including with respect to timeliness. Further, Defendants claim to have
made documents available for inspection and copying only on December 21, 2007, but Plaintiff
has not as yet seen any documents, and depositions have only recently been noticed. The timing
of Defendants’ claimed production of documents is merely another stunt to further prejudice and
harass Klayman by delaying production and review of documents over the December holidays
and after depositions were noticed by Klayman for the first week in January. Moreover,
Defendants are further harassing Klayman by not returning the professional courtesy of copying

and sending documents, and waiting until late on December 21, 2007, the eve of the
Christmas/New Years holiday, and not coincidentally as their counsel’s law offices were closing,
to so advise. If anyone should be sanctioned, it is Defendants for their wanton and vexatious
litigation conduct.
Sanctions under Rule 37 are not applicable where the alleged non-disclosure, response or
objection was substantially justified, or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A)(ii) and (iii).
Sanctions pursuant to Rule 37 are hardly warranted in this case against Klayman, and
must be denied. To the contrary, Defendants obstructionist and one-sided discovery motion
practice is meant to harass and improperly burden Klayman, and it is Defendants who should be
sanctioned. As established below, Klayman fulfilled his discovery obligations with respect to
the document requests and fully responded or properly objected to each of the requests set forth
in the Motion. Klayman also made a good faith effort to address Defendants’ purported concerns
and supplemented his answers accordingly. Therefore, not only are sanctions against Klayman
not warranted, the Motion is itself unnecessary, and meant only to increase the cost of litigation
for Plaintiff, an individual without the vast resources of Defendants, in addition to the fact that
defense counsel is being paid under a Directors and Officers’ Insurance policy. Defendants
motion, intended to run up the cost of litigation must be denied.

Subject: RE: Paul v. Clinton; Paul v. Judicial Watch, et al.
Mr. Driscoll:
This email will serve to memorialize the terms of Mr. Paul's proposal to Judicial Watch, as I relayed them to you in our phone call
today.

Mr. Paul will drop his lawsuit against Judicial Watch now, before both sides invest substantial money in discovery and trial
preparation. No depositions, no discovery -- no need for Judicial Watch to have to explain what happened between itself and
its star client, Peter Paul.
Mr. Paul will stop his negative publicity campaign against Judicial Watch regarding his malpractice claim and contract breach.
Mr. Paul will make a public statement that he and Judicial Watch have set aside their differences and will work together to
hold Hillary Clinton accountable.
Rod Martin, of TheVanguard.Org, who has been traveling around the country, meeting with high-dollar conservatives in order
to raise money for the Paul v. Clinton case, is willing to work as a go-between, publicly supporting and applauding both Mr.
Paul and Judicial Watch in their willingness to work together. Rod would effectively become an ambassador of good will on
Judicial Watch's behalf while he's meeting with conservatives, drumming up support for launching TheVanguard.Org.
Mr. Paul will cooperate with Judicial Watch against Larry Klayman in regard to Klayman's lawsuit.
Mr. Paul will allow Judicial Watch to once again use the case for its own fundraising and publicity.
Mr. Paul will permit Judicial Watch to have a special version of the "Hillary Uncensored" documentary created for its use and
benefit, with footage of Tom Fitton being interviewed about Judicial Watch's role in bringing about this historic case against
the Clintons.
Judicial Watch will put up $500,000 immediately to pay a retainer fee to attorney Martin Garbus to serve as lead counsel in the
Paul v. Clinton case and take it to trial. Mr. Garbus has already made a commitment to take on the case, if given the
money. He estimates it will cost $2 million to take the case to trial.
Judicial Watch will also make a commitment to put another $500,000 into the Paul v. Clinton litigation, or $1 million
altogether. (Rod Martin is endeavoring to raise the rest.) Martin Garbus is reputed to be one of the top ten litigators in the
country. He has better credentials than David Kendall. Several advantages to using Garbus: (1) absolutely a "must have" in
order to have a realistic shot at getting this case to the jury and winning at trial, given the opposition; (2) a fundraising
bonanza, since the involvement of a lawyer with Garbus's fame and expertise will likely generate more in donations than the
cost of hiring him; (3) Garbus is anything but a conservative and hasn't made a career of pursuing conservative causes, let
alone of suing the Clintons. This lends a credibility to the case that money can't buy. Garbus would not have committed to
taking on the case if he didn't think he could win it. What is that association worth to Judicial Watch? What would it mean to
Judicial Watch to actually win this case against the Clintons? Hillary's dismissal from the case is meaningless if Garbus can
pull off a win against Bill Clinton. Even short of that, what would it mean to have a lawyer of Garbus's ability depose Hillary
and later grill her on the witness stand at a public trial?
Judicial Watch pays $250,000 to Peter Paul for damages in settling his lawsuit against Judicial Watch, which can be publicly
characterized as an investment in the documentary or some other payment that won't concede liability.
Judicial Watch pays $150,000 for a criminal attorney to represent Mr. Paul in withdrawing his guilty plea in the securities
fraud case in New York and take the case to trial.
Colette Wilson (that's me) will serve as local counsel. My involvement is essential because of my intense work on the case for
the past two years. (As I mentioned, Gary Kreep has been discharged as counsel of record, and the United States Justice
Foundation is therefore out of the case.) Mr. Paul also requires that Judicial Watch's in-house counsel not serve as counsel of
record or otherwise make decisions regarding litigation strategy.

Obviously, there are numerous details to be worked out, but that is the offer.
Thank you for conveying this proposal to your clients.
Sincerely,
