ATLANTA DIVISION

 

GEORGE DANIELS, :
Defendant

vs.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff

MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE UNDER 18 U.S.C 0x00A7 3582 (c)

 

Comes now, George Daniels, proceeding pro se, and moves this
Court to amend his judgment pursuant to 18 U.S.C 0x00A7 3582(c) which
provides in relevant part:

"Tn the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of
imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has been lowered
by the sentencing commission, pursuant to 28 U.S.C 0x00A7 994(0), upon

motion of the defendnat, the court may reduce the term of

imprisonment after considering the factors set forth in section
3553."

The grounds in support of said motion is amendment 505 which amended
the guideline range by capping the upper drug limits of the drug
quantity table in 2D1.1 from level 42 to 38. As defendant Daniel's
was originally sentenced after being found guilty of conspiracy to

distribute in excess of 100 grams of methamphetamine, and at

sentencing the probation department finding a base offense level

 

 
Case 1:90-cr-00190-JOF-JED Document 546 Filed 05/13/11 Page 2 of 4

level of 42 where the drug trafficking conspiracy involved

" coupled with a criminal

"30 Kg or more of pure methemphetamine,'
history score of IV, his guideline range was only life in prison.

In light of amendment 505 capping the upper drug limit to
level 38, and 1B1.10(b)(1) which now reads that "a court shall
substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the
corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the
defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline
applications unaffected," defendant Daniels' guideline range
would now yield a base offense level of 38, criminal history IV,
reflecting a new 324-405 month sentencing range.

Amendment 505 has been determined to apply retroactively being

that it is listed under 1B1.10(c) which states the following:

"in a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment

and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has

subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the

guideline manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court :
May reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment as provided

by 18 U.S.C 0x00A7 3582(c)."

As a result, defendant Daniels is eligible for a reduction of his
sentence subject, however, to the terms and conditions as outlined:
in the newly amended version of 1B1. 10 (a) which under application
note B lists factors for consideration, specifically note B(i)

which states:

"consistent with 18 U.S.C 0x00A7 3582 (c)(2), the court shall consider
the factors in 18 U.S.C 0x00A7 3553(a) in determining: (1) whether a
reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment is warranted;
and (ii) the extent of such reduction, but only within the

limits described in subsection (b).

(2)
Case 1:90-cr-00190-JOF-JED Document 546 Filed 05/13/11 Page 3 of 4

(ii) Public Safety Consideration-Consideration-The Court
shall consider the nature and seriousness or the danger (c)
'to any person or the community that may be posed by a
reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment in
determining: (I) whether such a reduction is warranted

(iii) Post-Sentencing Conduct-The Court may consider post
sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after the
imposition of the original term of imprisonment in determing:
(I) whether a reduction in the defendant's term of
imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of such a
reduction, but not only within the limits descrived in

subsection (b).

Defendant Daniels submits that awarding him this reduction under
1B1.10 (c) would not impose any safety concerns and will not
endanger the safety of any person or the community by a reduction
in his sentence. Defendant after serving 21 years in prison is
now 71 years of age and recovering from a recent stroke. These
factors mitigate the potential that he would engage in any future
criminal conduct. In addition, defendant since the commencement of
his incarceration has never received an incident report from
staff, and has also maintained steady employment in Unicor,
which produces military clothing and other government accessories,
conduct which demonstrates exceptional post-sentencing conduct as
well as a new found respect for the law.

Last but not least, Defendant submits that this court in the
case of his codefendant has granted a resentencing based. on
amendment 505. See Demar v. United States, 228 Fed. Appx. 940,
Note 6 (11th. Cir. 2007)(Appellate Court noting District Court

granted reduction under amendment 505. And since Defendant's

(3)

Case 1:90-cr-00190-JOF-JED Document 546 Filed 05/13/11 Page 4 of 4

co-defendant Ms. Demar was clearly more culpable than
defendant Daniels, he submits that a reduction under amendment
505 would be fitting as well under the facts of the instant
case.

Based on the foregoing, Defendant Danield respectfully submits
that in consideration of the factors outlined in 1B1.10(c) and
application note B(ii) and (iii), that the court consider the
factors of 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable in
granting the relief requested, which is reducing his sentence
to 324 months for his conviction for conspiracy to possess with

intent to distribure in excess of 100 grams of methamphetamine.
