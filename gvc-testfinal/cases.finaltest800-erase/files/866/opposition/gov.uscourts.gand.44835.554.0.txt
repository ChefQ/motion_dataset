GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE ADDRESSING DEFENDANT’S ELIGIBILITY
FOR A SENTENCE REDUCTION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)
COMES NOW the United States of America, by Sally Quillian
Yates, United States Attorney, and G. Scott Hulsey, Assistant
United States Attorney, Northern District of Georgia, and pursuant
to this Court’s Order, hereby files the Government’s Response
Addressing the Defendant’s Eligibility For A Sentence Reduction
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).
INTRODUCTION
This Court has ordered the government to respond regarding
whether the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing
Guidelines, which lowers the base offense levels applicable to
certain crack offenses. (Doc. 551).

However, after reviewing the

defendant’s motion the government finds that the defendant makes no
reference to Amendment 750, or crack cocaine, and cites only
Amendment 505 as his basis for sentence reduction. (Doc. 546). See
USSG App. C, Vol. I, Amend. 505, (effective November 1, 1994).

Case 1:90-cr-00190-JOF-JED Document 554 Filed 05/01/12 Page 2 of 9

Because the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory
minimum term of life imprisonment, the defendant is not eligible
for relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), Amendment 505, and
his motion must be denied as shown below.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On

August

20,

1991,

the

defendant,

George

Daniels,

was

convicted by a jury in the Northern District of Georgia on Counts
One

(Conspiracy

to

Distribute

in

excess

of

100

grams

of

Methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a) and 846), and Count Eight
(Distribution of Methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)) of a Nine
Count Second Superseding Indictment charging eleven defendants.
(Docs. 99, 186; Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”), Part A, p. 2).
On December 13, 1991, this Court sentenced the defendant to a
statutory mandatory term of life imprisonment. (Doc. 217; PSR
¶ 134; SOR ¶ 8).

On March 11, 1993, the defendant’s conviction and

sentence were affirmed on appeal. (Doc. 257).
On August 31, 1994, the defendant filed a motion to vacate his
sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

(Doc. 287).

The Court

subsequently allowed the defendant to withdraw that motion and
appointed counsel to assist the defendant with refiling a 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255 motion.

(Doc. 335).

With the Court’s permission, (Doc.

358), the defendant filed his revised 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion on
April 22, 1996.

(Doc. 361).

After review, the Court denied that

the Court’s denial of his § 2255 motion, (Doc. 446), but the
Court’s decision was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit on June 22,
2000. (Doc. 484). The defendant is currently incarcerated, serving
his life sentence. See Bureau of Prisons, http://www.bop.gov (last
visited April 25, 2012).
On May 13, 2011, the defendant filed a motion pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 3582 for Reduction of Sentence based on Amendment 505, and
the government responds pursuant to the Court’s Order. (Doc. 551).
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the Court
calculated the defendant’s initial base offense level under USSG
§ 2D1.1(c) at 42, based on 421,848.00 kilograms of marijuana, i.e.,
the

conversion

amount

representing

93

pounds

of

ice

or

methamphetamine. (PSR, ¶ 69, Part A). With no adjustments applied,
the defendant’s total offense level remained 42.

drug convictions. (Doc. 179; PSR ¶ 134).

LEGAL AUTHORITY
(A)

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)

Title 18, United States Code, Section 3582(c)(2) provides for
the modification of an imposed prison sentence when the United
States Sentencing Commission has lowered the sentencing range:
(c) Modification of an imposed term of imprisonment. The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it
has been imposed except that . . .
(2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced
to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range
that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing
Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of
the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons,
or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of
imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in
section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy
statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.
18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).
In § 1B1.10 of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission has
identified

the

amendments

which

may

be

applied

retroactively

pursuant to this authority, and articulated the proper procedure
for implementing the amendment in a concluded case.1

1

On December

Section 1B1.10 is based on 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), and also
implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), which provides: “If the Commission
reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines
applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it
shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the
sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the
offense may be reduced.”
4

Case 1:90-cr-00190-JOF-JED Document 554 Filed 05/01/12 Page 5 of 9

11, 2007, the Commission issued a revised version of § 1B1.10,
which emphasizes the limited nature of relief available under 18
U.S.C. § 3582(c). Revised § 1B1.10(a), which became effective on
March 3, 2008, provides:
(1) In General. - In a case in which a defendant is
serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range
applicable to that defendant has subsequently been
lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines
Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may
reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided
by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C.
3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant’s term of
imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy
statement.
(2) Exclusions. - A reduction in the defendant’s term of
imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement
and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C.
3582(c)(2) if (A)

none of the amendments listed in subsection
(c) is applicable to the defendant; or

(B)

an amendment listed in subsection (c) does not
have the effect of lowering the defendant’s
applicable guideline range.

(3) Limitation. - Consistent with subsection (b),
proceedings under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy
statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the
defendant.
USSG § 1B1.10(a)(November 1, 2011).
Effective November 1, 1994, Amendment 505 amended the drug
quantity table in USSG § 2D1.1 by reducing the highest base offense
level for all drug offenses to 38 and eliminating levels 40 and 42.

A guideline amendment may be applied retroactively only when
expressly listed in § 1B1.10(c).
See, e.g., United States v.
Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 2003).

Amendment 505 is included in the list of
§

1B1.10(c)

which

may

be

applied

See USSG § 1B1.10(c)(November 1, 2011).

AMENDMENT 505

Amendment

505

to

Section

2D1.1

of

the

United

State’s

Sentencing Guidelines eliminated base offense levels 40 and 42 for
drug quantities, and capped out the drug quantity table at USSG
§ 2D1.1 at base offense level 38.

Before Amendment 505 went into

effect, the base offense level for violations involving more than
conversion amounts of 300,000 kilograms of marijuana was 42.

The

base offense level for offenses involving between 100,000 and
300,000 kilograms of marijuana was 40. And the base offense level
for violations involving between 30,000 and 100,000 kilograms of
marijuana was 38. Since Amendment 505 has gone into effect, all
violations involving more than 30,000 kilograms of marijuana have
a base offense level 38. See USSG, App. C, Vol. I, am. 505; United
States v. Rios-Hernandez, Slip Copy, 2010 WL 1689497 (D. Nev.
2010).
ARGUMENT
The defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction,
because although Amendment 505 would lower the defendant’s base
offense

level,

the

defendant’s

life

sentence

is

mandated

by

statute, and the Court may not reduce the defendant’s sentence
below the statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment.

(reduction of offense levels in the Sentencing Guidelines under
Amendment 505 had no effect on the defendant’s statutory mandatory
life sentence).
The Sentencing Commission has not altered and cannot alter a
statutory mandatory minimum sentence.
