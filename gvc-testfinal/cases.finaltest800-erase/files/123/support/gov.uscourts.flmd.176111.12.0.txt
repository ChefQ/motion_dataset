MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
TAMPA DIVISION

Plaintiff,
V.

CASE NO. 8:05cv2124-T-17TGW

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE,
Defendants.
UNITED STATES’ MOTION TO DISMISS
The United States of America, by counsel, moves to dismiss the present action
pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and, in support
thereof, submits the following memorandum of law.
BACKGROUND
The taxpayer, Ernest Enax, brings the present action seeking economic damages
and injunctive relief against the United States. The complaint alleges that the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) had revoked the self-release of various Notices of Federal Tax
Lien in the public record and that, by way of such revocation, the taxpayer has been
unable to sell a piece of real property, causing him economic harm.
The IRS made multiple tax assessments against the taxpayer between 1993 and
1995. As part of its collection efforts, and pursuant to its statutory authority, the IRS then
filed in the public record a number of Notices of Federal Tax Lien (“Notices”). Such
notices are effective so long as the period of limitations for the collection of the
underlying tax assessment has not expired. See 26 U.S.C. Section 6322. That period is
typically ten years from the date of assessment. See 26 U.S.C. Section 6502(a)(1). Under
1735562.1

Case 8:05-cv-02124-EAK-TGW Document 12 Filed 05/31/06 Page 2 of 7 PageID 76

normal circumstances, then, notices filed for assessments made between 1993 and 1995
would self-release at various times between 2003 and 2005.
As the ten year periods of limitation began to expire on the assessments against
the taxpayer, the IRS allowed the notices to self-release. However, because the periods of
limitation for collecting the taxes was tolled, the IRS could have renewed the notices to
reflect the extended collections period. More specifically, the taxpayer had filed for
bankruptcy on November 15, 1994 in the bankruptcy court for the Northern District of
New York, case number 94-14195. See Exhibit A. This bankruptcy effectively tolled the
period of limitations for the entire pendency of that action plus an additional sixty (60)
days thereafter. See 26 U.S.C. Section 6503(h). The bankruptcy case was closed on
September 13, 2000, meaning that the bankruptcy lasted approximately six years.
Because of these tolling events, the limitations periods for collecting the tax
assessments underlying the notices had not expired on the date of the self-release. As
such, the IRS could have renewed the notices prior to their self-release to reflect the
extended collections period. The IRS instead chose to revoke their self-release, which it
is statutorily permitted to do pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6325(f)(2). Taxpayer brings
this action and requests the Court award monetary damages, declare the notices invalid,
and order the IRS to release the liens. The Court should dismiss the complaint.
ARGUMENT
I.

The Internal Revenue Service is Not a Proper Party

Taxpayer improperly names the Internal Revenue Service as a defendant. Suit
against the IRS is improper because an executive department of the United States can
only be sued with the express authorization of Congress. Deleeuw v. IRS, 681 F. Supp.
402, 403-04 (E.D. Mich. 1987) (citing Blackmar v. Guerre, 342 U.S. 512, 514-15
(1952)). Congress has not consented to suit against the IRS. Castleberry v. ATF, 530

Case 8:05-cv-02124-EAK-TGW Document 12 Filed 05/31/06 Page 3 of 7 PageID 77

F.2d 672, 673 n.3 (“Congress has not constituted the Treasury Department or any of its
divisions or bureaus as a body corporate and has not authorized them to be sued eo
nomine”) (5th Cir. 1976). The United States is the only real party in interest, so the
Court should dismiss the IRS as a named defendant. See Hawaii v. Gordon, 373 U.S. 57,
58 (1963); Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620 (1963); Louisiana v. McAdoo, 234 U.S.
627, 632 (1914).
II.

The Court is Without Subject Matter Jurisdiction

The Taxpayer requests two forms of relief. First, he requests the Court order the
United States to remove the notices so that he can sell his real property. See Complaint at
¶ 1. Second, he seeks damages because the liens precluded him from selling a piece of
real property. See Complaint at ¶ 1. The Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction
to grant any of the requested relief.
1.

Injunctive Relief

Taxpayer seeks an order directing the IRS to release its notices, but injunctive
relief is prohibited by the Anti-Injunction Act. Section 7421(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code provides, in relevant part, that:
[N]o suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any
tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such
person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.
This statute’s plain language makes clear that suits for injunctive relief against the IRS’
assessment or collection efforts are prohibited. See O’Hagan v. United States, 86 F.3d
776, 778 (8th Cir. 1996). By requesting “a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and
removal of the illegal federal tax liens against his real estate,” the taxpayer is plainly
seeking injunctive relief against the IRS’ efforts to collect his outstanding tax assessments. Because such actions are barred by the Internal Revenue Code, the Court is
without subject matter jurisdiction to grant the relief requested.

Under Enochs v. Williams Packing & Navigations Co., 370 U.S. 1, 6-8 (1962), a
narrow exception to the Anti-Injunction Act is available to a taxpayer who establishes (1)
that it is clear that under no circumstances can the Government prevail on the merits, and
(2) that equity jurisdiction would otherwise exist – i.e., that the litigant is threatened with
irreparable injury and there are no adequate legal remedies available. Taxpayer cannot
satisfy the Williams Packing test. First, it does not appear that he can prevail on the
merits of his case. The crux of his argument is that the period of limitations for collecting
his unpaid tax liabilities has expired, and therefore the IRS may be forced to release its
lien. But as we mentioned above, taxpayer filed a bankruptcy petition, and during the
time that the bankruptcy automatic stay was in effect, the limitations period was tolled.
26 U.S.C. Section 6503(h). In addition, there may be other events (such as the filing of
collection due process requests) that have further tolled the collection period. Second,
taxpayer cannot show that he has been irreparably harmed and that no other adequate
legal remedies. To the extent that he is attempting to sell his house, the Internal Revenue
Code allows the IRS to discharge property from a federal lien if the taxpayer satisfies
certain requirements. 26 U.S.C. Section 6325(b)(3). Taxpayer has not alleged that he has
even attempted to seek relief under this provision. Moreover, taxpayer recognizes that 26
U.S.C. Section 7433 allows him to seek damages for certain wrongful collection acts.
Plainly he has other remedies available to him. The judicial exception to the antiinjunction act provides no relief for the taxpayer in this instance.
2.

Monetary Award Under 26 U.S.C. Section 7433

Taxpayer requests an award of damages pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 7433, but
he has failed to demonstrate that he satisfies the jurisdictional prerequisites for filing a
Section 7433 action. Section 7433 provides, in relevant part, that:

If, in connection with any collection of Federal tax with respect to a
taxpayer, any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service recklessly or intentionally, or by reason of negligence, disregards any provision
of this title, or any regulation, promulgated under this title, such taxpayer
may bring a civil action for damages against the United States in a district
court of the United States.
26 U.S.C. § 7433(a). Section 7433 contains several limitations, including a requirement
that administrative remedies be exhausted. The limitations specifically provide that:
Requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted. – A judgment for
damages shall not be awarded under subsection (b) unless the court
determines that the plaintiff has exhausted the administrative remedies
available to such plaintiff within the Internal Revenue Service.
26 U.S.C. § 7433(d)(1). Prior to filing suit pursuant to § 7433, a taxpayer must first file
an administrative claim with the IRS as set forth in Treas. Reg. § 301.7433-1. That
regulation provides that no action can be maintained in district court before the earlier of
(1) the date the decision is rendered on the administrative claim; or (2) the date six
months after the date on which a proper administrative claim is filed. See Treas. Reg.
§ 301.7433-1(d). Accordingly, a taxpayer must first wait until a decision is made on the
claim, or until six months have lapsed since the filing of the claim, before filing suit. The
district court lacks jurisdiction where administrative remedies have not been exhausted.
Venen v. United States, 38 F.3d 100 (3d Cir. 1994); Conforte v. United States, 979 F.2d
1375 (9th Cir. 1993).
The complaint in the present case was filed on November 18, 2005. Yet, the IRS
did not receive the taxpayer’s administrative request for relief until May 2, 2006,
approximately five months after the filing of this suit. See Exhibit B.1 Because the claim
for administrative relief came after the complaint, taxpayer cannot maintain a Section
7433 action. A district court must analyze its jurisdiction from the time of a complaint.

The Government attached only the first 13 pages of the taxpayer’s 67-page
administrative claim for relief in which he made many lengthy, frivolous arguments.

See Church of Scientology of Colorado v. United States, 499 F.Supp. 1085 (D. Colo.
1980) (full payment of taxes made 22 months after suit was filed failed to confer jurisdiction on the court); Rutherford v. United States, 528 F.Supp. 167, 169 (W.D. Tex. 1981)
(payment of balance of assessed tax after suit has been filed will not support jurisdiction),
rev’d on other grounds, 702 F.2d 580 (5th Cir. 1983). Taxpayer’s belated filing of an
administrative claim does not cure the jurisdictional defect.

WHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests the Court dismiss the
Complaint.
