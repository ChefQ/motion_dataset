Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ EXPEDITED MOTION
TO STAY FORECLOSURE
PROCEEDING

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby submits
this response in opposition to the “Expedited Motion to Stay Foreclosure Proceeding Until the 9th

-2Circuit Rules,” filed by defendants on August 8, 2008, at Dkt. # 216.
As with defendants’ original motion to stay, filed at Dkt. # 175, defendants have failed to
show that they are entitled to the stay that they seek. The Court has already found as much in its
Order entered May 1, 2008, at Dkt. # 198, when it stated,
Because this Court can see no merit to Defendants’ position, it cannot, in good
conscience, extend the stay beyond sixty (60) days without a full bond and
satisfaction of the other conditions that are mentioned by the Government in its
responsive memorandum at Docket 177.
In that Order, the Court gave defendants a limited stay of 60 days to present their motion
for stay to the Court of Appeals. Defendants have done so, and the Court of Appeals has not yet
ruled on that motion. Because, as this Court has recognized, the motion lacks merit, there is no
legal or even equitable basis to continue the limited stay ordered by this Court any further unless,
as the Court stated in its Order, defendants post a full bond and provide satisfaction of the other
conditions set forth by the Government in its response filed at Dkt. # 177.
Defendants have made absolutely no effort to post a bond, which is required by Fed. R.
Civ. P. 62(d), or otherwise provide adequate protection of the Government’s interest in this case.
Moreover, continued delay of the foreclosure process is harmful to the Government’s interest,
because it increases the chance that the Government will have to incur the cost of winterizing
and securing the property during the winter months, when it will be difficult to sell. Defendants
continue to seek delay in this matter without providing any legal or factual support for such a
delay and without making any effort to comply with the bond requirements of Rule 62(d). As
defendants have provided no basis on which the Court can further extend the limited stay it
granted, the United States respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants’ motion.

-3In the alternative, as set forth in the Government’s response at Dkt. # 177, the Court
should grant a stay only if defendants comply with the following conditions:
1.

Post a supersedeas bond to secure the following: (a) payment of appeal costs; (b)

payment of all local property taxes and special assessments on the subject property for at least
two years; (c) payment of hazard insurance for at least two years adequate to replace all existing
improvements on the subject property; and (d) payment of the full amount of the judgment plus
statutory accruals of interest and penalties for at least two years.
2.

Make the United States an additional insured on the hazard insurance policy

described in paragraph 1 above and provide the Court and government counsel with prompt
evidence of compliance with this requirement.
3.

Do not attempt to sell, assign, transfer, convey, encumber, or otherwise affect title

to the subject property.
4.

Do not damage or commit waste with respect to the subject property.

5.
