A05-123-CV(RRB)
Expedited Motion to Stay Foreclosure Proceeding Until the 9" Circuit Rules
Come now defendants Donald Louis Hymes and Rita MariNa Hymes (the Hymes) with
this Motion to Stay Foreclosure Proceedings Until the 9" Circuit Rules.

Rita MariNa Hymes has called the 9" Circuit on three different occasions to confirm
when the Motion to Stay that has been filed in Case 08-35495 would be addressed by the gf
Circuit. Three different clerks, not giving legal advice, stated that it would be a minimum of 6
months to one year.

Therefore to give effect of the Minute ORDER of Judge Beistline at Docket 212 "In an
abundance of caution, and in an effort to ensure that the Appellate Court has sufficient time to

consider the matter ...", flows a fortiori that a Stay will be issued by Judge Beistline until the

9" Circuit Rules (considers the matter) on the Motion to Stay, which will not be accomplished

for probably a minimum of 6 months to a year, with no definite date pursuant to information
provided by three different clerks of the 9" Circuit, stating that the 9" Circuit has to follow

certain procedures, and is extremely busy.
