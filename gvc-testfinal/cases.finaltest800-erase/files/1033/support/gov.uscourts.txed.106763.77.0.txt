Doc. 77

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
MARSHALL DIVISION
SOFTWARE RIGHTS ARCHIVE, LLC
Civil Case No. 2:07-cv-511 (CE)

v.
GOOGLE INC., YAHOO! INC., IAC
SEARCH & MEDIA, INC., AOL, LLC,
AND LYCOS, INC.

DEFENDANTS’ UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE
REPLY BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendants Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc., IAC Search & Media, Inc., AOL, LLC, and Lycos,
Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”), through their undersigned counsel, respectfully move this
Honorable Court for an unopposed extension of time to file a reply brief in further support of
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing. In support of their request for an
extension, Defendants state as follows:
1.

This patent infringement action was commenced on November 21, 2007. The

deadlines for the Markman hearing and trial are November 10, 2010 and May 2, 2011,
respectively.
2.

Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing on July 16, 2008

(Docket No. 66).
3.

On July 17, 2008, Defendants consented to a request by the Plaintiff, Software

Rights Archive, LLC (“SRA”), for a 25-day extension (i.e., 40 days from the filing of the
motion) for SRA to file its opposition brief. See Docket No. 67.
4.

SRA filed its opposition brief on August 25, 2008 (Docket No. 76). Under the

Local Rules of this Court, Defendants’ Reply Brief is currently due on September 5, 2008.

5.

In SRA’ s opposition, SRA attached declarations from Jeffrey Ait (who is believed

to reside in South Carolina) and Christopher Lynch (who is believed to reside in North Carolina).
6. Upon information and belief, SRA’ s counsel was allowed access to third party
documents held by a Sharon Fugitt in California.
7.

Defendants believe that to properly respond to the allegations in Plaintiff SRA’ s

opposition, Defendants require jurisdictional discovery limited to the issue of standing. At this
time, Defendants anticipate that they will need to conduct at least the following discovery related
to the issue of standing: oral deposition of and subpoena documents from: (1) Jeffrey Ait, (2)
Daniel Egger, (3) Sharon Fugitt, and (4) J. Christopher Lynch. This jurisdictional discovery will
require the additional time requested and serves the interests of justice and judicial efficiency
since the court’ s jurisdiction is a threshold matter. Accordingly, this motion is not for purposes
of delay but rather so that justice may be done.
8.

The relief requested in this motion is not opposed by Plaintiff SRA.

WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that they be granted a 45-day extension
of time – until and including October 20, 2008 – to allow sufficient time to conduct jurisdictional
discovery on the issues related to SRA’ s alleged standing and to file their reply brief to SRA’ s
opposition.
