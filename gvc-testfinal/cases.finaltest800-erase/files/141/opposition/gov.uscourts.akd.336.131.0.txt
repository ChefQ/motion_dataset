Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
COMPEL DISCOVERY

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby responds
as follows to those portions of defendants’ “Motion to Compel Discovery Substantive

Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB

-2Documents under the Will and Statutory Authority of Congress with Mandated Substantive
Regulations” (defendants’ motion) that merit a response:
1.

Defendants Made No Attempt to Confer as Required by Local Rule 37.1

The United States notes at the outset that defendants’ motion lacks the “Certification of
Attempt to Confer” required by Local Rule 37.1. Indeed, defendants made no attempt to contact
counsel for the United States to confer prior to filing this motion. Although defendants are pro
se in this matter, they are aware of the requirements of Local Rule 37.1 because counsel for the
United States has attempted to contact them on multiple occasions prior to filing the United
States’ motion to compel and motion for discovery sanctions, Dkt. ## 95, 112. Accordingly,
defendants’ motion should be denied for failure to comply with local rules.
2.

Defendants’ Motion to Compel Production of
Documents Not Previously Sought During Discovery Is Improper

Defendants’ motion, while largely unintelligible, seeks production of documents
identified by defendants as “substantive documents.” Defendants do not define the term
“substantive documents” in their motion, and the United States is unaware of what documents
defendants are referring to when they state that they have not received any “substantive
documents” from the government in this case. However, a review of defendants’ request for
production of documents served on the United States in this matter, and filed with the Court as
Exhibit 3 to defendants’ previous motion to compel, Dkt. # 102, reveals that defendants made no
prior request for production of the “substantive documents” they now seek. Because no request
for production of the documents identified by defendants as “substantive documents” was made
during the discovery phase of this case, which closed on June 9, 2007, it is improper to now ask

-3the Court to compel such production.
As set forth in the Declaration of Jennifer D. Auchterlonie, Dkt. # 104, and
acknowledged by defendants in their affidavits filed concurrently with the instant motion, Dkt. #
127, the United States has produced to defendants in this matter hundreds of pages of documents
from the administrative files of the IRS regarding the tax liabilities at issue. This production
includes all of the documents on which the government intends to rely in this case. Defendants’
request for production of documents plainly does not seek production of any documents
identified as “substantive documents,” and defendants’ prior motion to compel further document
production (Dkt. # 102) has already been denied by the Court (Dkt. # 110). Accordingly,
defendants’ motion lacks any intelligible basis and should be denied.
Wherefore, inasmuch as defendants have failed to show any legal or factual basis for the
compelled production of the documents identified by them as “substantive documents,” the
United States respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants’ motion.
Dated this 3rd day of August, 2007.
Respectfully Submitted,
NELSON P. COHEN
United States Attorney
