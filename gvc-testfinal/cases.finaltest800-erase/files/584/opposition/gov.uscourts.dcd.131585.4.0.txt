IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

 

IN RE APPLICATION FOR USE IMMUNITY
ORDER FOR WILLIAM LUNA

Misc. No. 08-312 (RCL)

 

UNITED STATES' OPPOSITION TO HERNAN MELENDEZ'S
MOTION TO UNSEAL APPLICATION FOR COMPULSION ORDER, AND POINTS
AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT THEREOF

The United States of America, by and through the United States Attorney for the District
of Columbia, hereby opposes Hernan Melendez's motion to unseal the United States'
Application for a compulsion order for William Luna. The Application was filed in connection
with the trial of Melendez for, inter alia, second degree murder in the Superior Court for the
District of Columbia in the case of United States v. Hernan Melendez, 2007 CF1 2478 (Superior
Court, Washington, D.C.), between May 12, 2008, and May 27, 2008. Defendant was convicted
on all charges on May 27, 2008. William Luna was a witness for the defense. Because his
testimony might implicate his fifth amendment privilege, the United States sought and obtained a
compulsion order for his testimony.

On July 18, 2008, Melendez, through counsel, filed a motion seeking an order that would
unseal the United States' Application for the compulsion order. The defense does not identify
any specific relevant information that it hopes to obtain from the Application; rather, it asserts
that the information in the Application is relevant to Luna's bias and credibility.

As explained below, the defense provides no basis for unsealing the Application. The

defense does not identify any relevant information that could be gleaned from it; indeed, the

defense request is simply a fishing expedition. It should be denied.
 

Case 1:08-mc-00312-RCL Document4 Filed 07/24/2008 Page2of5
BACKGROUND

On January 28, 2007, Melendez and two friends, Yoni Luna and William Luna, had an
altercation with the decedent, Andres Benitez, in front of 1225 11" Street, N.W.. Benitez
retrieved a softball bat and swung once at the men - he did not hit them. Melendez and the Luna
brothers then swarmed Benitez, knocked him to the ground and started kicking him. Melendez
then grabbed the bat and hit Benitez in the head ten to fifteen times. A bystander tried to
intervene and Melendez hit him once in the head. Melendez hit Benitez in the head several more
times, then fled with the Lunas.

Two security guards who witnessed the attack chased Melendez, ef a/. into an apartment
building one block away. The guards were only able to apprehend Melendez. He still had the
bat in his hand. Subsequent blood and DNA analysis confirmed that the decedent's blood was on
the back and inside of Melendez' jacket, and on the bat.

Several days after the murder, William Luna telephoned his girlfriend, Norma Saravia, in
New York and told her that he killed a person in Washington, D.C. and wanted her to hide him.
Luna told Saravia that if she did not do so, he would kill her. Luna ultimately pled guilty in New
York to a charge of aggravated harrassment. Luna never told Saravia or anyone else that he
actually wielded the bat.

Defendant was indicted for second degree murder while armed, assault with a deadly or
dangerous weapon and related offenses.

The United States disclosed Luna's statement to Saravia to the defense as Brady
information prior to the trial, and also provided contact information for Luna and Saravia. The

United States also placed Luna and Saravia under subpoena for trial. The United States did not

Case 1:08-mc-00312-RCL Document4 Filed 07/24/2008 Page3of5

intend to call either Luna or Saravia to testify, but subpoenaed them to ensure that they were
available to the defense if the defense wanted to call them. The defense indicated that it would
call Saravia to testify about Luna's statement that he killed a man. Pursuant to Fed.R.Ev. 804,
such this statement was admissible only as a statement against penal interest and only if Luna

was unavailable to testify. Accordingly, the United States sought to make Luna available to
testify. The United States asked the trial court to appoint counsel for Luna. After being satisfied
that Luna would assert his Fifth Amendment rights, the United States made an Application to this
Court for a compulsion order, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 6001-6005 (2000), to make Luna
available to testify. The Application was made under seal.

The trial began in Superior Court on May 12, 2008, before the Honorable Frederick
Weisberg. This Court signed the compulsion order on May 19, 2008. The defense called Luna
to testify on May 20, 2008. He admitted being involved in the incident. He testified that his
memory was less than complete because he had been drinking but admitted that he might have
kicked the decedent. He denied swinging the bat and testified that Melendez was the assailant.
Luna admitted calling Saravia after the incident and seeking her help, but denied stating that he
killed a man. Melendez's counsel elected not to call Saravia to impeach Luna on his apparently
contradictory testimony. Melendez's counsel did not ask Luna if he ever wielded the bat.

Melendez's counsel was aware of the compulsion order. In fact, Melendez's counsel
examined Luna extensively on the scope and implications of the order.

Melendez was convicted of second degree murder while armed, assault with a deadly or
dangerous weapon and possession of a prohibited weapon. Melendez's counsel asked for an

enlargement of time to July 23, 2008, to file a motion for new trial, pursuant to Superior Court

-3-
 

Case 1:08-mc-00312-RCL Document4 Filed 07/24/2008 Page4of5
Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. The trial court granted the request.

On July 18, 2008, five days before the new trial motion was due, Melendez' counsel filed

the instant motion.
ARGUMENT
There no basis for unsealing the Application

There is no basis here to unseal the Application. Melendez seeks to learn the
representations that the United States made in the Application but he does not explain how any
representations could be relevant to issues presented in a motion for a new trial.

There is no dispute that William Luna was involved in the incident that led to the death of
Andres Benitez. From his perspective he could well have believed that "he killed a man," so his
admission is neither surprising nor relevant. However, the United States is not aware of any
instance in which Luna told anyone that he ever held the murder weapon in his hand or did
anything to the decedent, other than perhaps kicking the decedent.

The United States has no evidence that anyone other than Melendez hit Benitez with a
bat. Indeed, the arresting security guards testified at trial that Melendez was the only person
wielding the bat. Additionally, the bystander who Melendez hit and another guard testified that,
although they could not identify the assailant in court, they saw the person the guards arrested
(Melendez) and it was the person who wielded the bat. Finally, the United States played a 911
tape in which another witness gave a description of the assailant that matched Melendez, and also
stated that the person the guards arrested was the assailant.

Melendez contends that the representations made in the Application might be relevant to

Luna's bias but it does not explain how. The United States made no promises or agreements

with Luna.

Accordingly, Melendez's motion should be denied. There is no basis to unseal the
motion and Melendez does not identify any relevant information that is discoverable in the
Application.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons Melendez motion should be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
