IMMUNITY ORDER FOR : Misc No. 08-312 (RCL)

WILLIAM LUNA

MOTION FOR FORTHWITH COURT ORDER DIRECTING UNSEALING OF
PROCEEDINGS AND PRODCUTION OF FILINGS

Hernan Melendez, through undersigned counsel, pursuant to his Sixth Amendment right to
effective assistance of counsel, his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and his Fifth
Amendment right to due process of law and a fair trial, respectfully moves this Honorable Court for
an Order directing the unsealing of the jacket and proceedings in the above-captioned case prior to
July 23, 2008 as that is the deadline, pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 33, for undersigned
counsel to file a Motion for New Trial in the interests of justice, in United States v. Hernan
Melendez, Criminal Case No. 2007 CF1 2478, pending sentencing before the Honorable Frederick
Weisberg in which undersigned counsel represent Hernan Melendez.

As grounds for this Motion, Mr. Melendez, through undersigned counsel, states:

1. Mr. Melendez was convicted after a jury trial before the Honorable Frederick
Weisberg of, inter alia, the second-degree murder of Andres Benitez.

2. On the eve of trial the government applied to this Court for an Order of Immunity
for William Luna and on May 19, 2008, this Court entered the Immunity Order requested by the

government.' Based on independent investigation, undersigned counsel learned that shortly after

 

`Because only the Office of the United States Attorney has the power to seek an order of immunity,
effectively, without that office seeking the immunity order, Mr. Luna, by virtue of his Fifth Amendment
privilege, would have been unavailable to testify. Thus, although undersigned counsel were essentially
forced to call Mr. Luna as a defense witness in order to confront him with the admission he had made
Case 1:08-mc-00312-RCL Document3 Filed 07/18/2008 Page 2 of 21

Mr. Benitez was killed, William Luna fled to New York and admitted, to the mother of his children,
Norma Seravia, that it was he who had killed Andres Benitez and that the police in the District of
Columbia were looking for him. See February 8, 2007 Sworn Statement of Norma Seravia
(appended hereto as Exhibit A). Mr. Luna also threatened to kill Ms. Seravia and her family if she
failed to provide him with a place to stay while he hid from the police. Jd. Mr. Luna ultimately was
arrested in New York for his threats to Ms. Seravia and plead guilty there to aggravated harassment
in Suffolk County District Court bin case number 2007 SU 009357. On July 8, 2008, undersigned
counsel received a transcript of William Luna's guilty plea before the Honorable Hertha Trotto in
the District Court of the State of New York in which Judge Trotto clearly indicated that there was a
"hold [on Mr. Luna from the District of Columbia] concerning an active homicide investigation"
and further indicating that a federal search revealed that Mr. Luna was an "previously deported
aggravated felon. See March 6, 2007 Transcript in People v. William Luna, Docket No. 2007 SU
009357 (appended hereto as Exhibit B), at pp. 2, 6.

2. On July 17, 2008, undersigned counsel endeavored to obtain copies of the
documents contained in the file in the above-captioned case only to learn that it was under seal and
could only be produced with authorization from this Court

3. In order to fully investigate Mr. Melendez's Motion for New Trial, it is critical that

 

regarding the death of Andres Benitez, see Exhibit A (appended hereto), essentially he was a witness over
whom the government had control. Judge Weisberg effectively concurred in this assessment when he
agreed that it was "disingenuous" for the government to characterize William Luna as a defense witness.
Transcript of Trial Proceedings May 21, 2008 in United States vy. Hernan Melendez, Criminal Case No.
2007 CFI 2478, at 194.

0x00B0To the extent, prior to Mr. Melendez's trial, there was any legitimate interest in withholding the
representations made by the government to this Court in connection with the government's request that
Mr. Luna be granted immunity, that interest has evaporated now that Mr. Luna has testified at Mr.
Melendez's trial and this Court should unseal the proceedings. Cf, F.R.Cr.P. 6(e\3\(C)(i) (conferring
upon the Court the power to order disclosure of otherwise protected grand jury proceedings).
Case 1:08-mc-00312-RCL Document3 Filed 07/18/2008 Page 3 of 21

counsel be provided with the representations made by the Office of the United States Attorney,
whether orally or in writing, to secure this Court's May 19, 2008, Order granting immunity to
William Luna. As noted above, Mr. Luna admitted to the murder in Washington D.C., fled to New
York, threatened to kill the mother of his children if she failed to provide him with refuge from the
police, and ultimately plead guilty to aggravated harassment in connection with the threats.
Accordingly, the representations made by the Office of the United States Attorney in securing the
Order of immunity are highly relevant to a Motion for New Trial base don the "interests of justice."
Not only are the government's representations relevant to Mr. Luna's credibility, given that the
representations must have been based on Mr. Luna's account of the homicide, but the
representations are also especially relevant to confronting Mr. Luna's bias. See Davis v. Alaska,
415 U.S. 508 (1974); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264
(1959); Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687 (1931); United States v. McCrane, 527 F.2d 906 (3rd
Cir. 1975). Thus, Mr. Melendez's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, and
his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law and a fair trial require that his counsel be provided
access to the jacket and proceedings in the above-captioned case.

WHEREFORE for the foregoing reasons, any which may appear in supplemental
pleadings which Mr. Melendez specifically reserves the right to file, any which may appear at he
requested hearing on this motion, and any others this Court deems Just and proper, Hernan
Melndez, through counsel, respectfully requests that, the attached Order be entered directing the

forthwith unsealing of the proceedings and documents in the above-captioned case.

Dated: July 18, 2008 Respectfully submitted,
