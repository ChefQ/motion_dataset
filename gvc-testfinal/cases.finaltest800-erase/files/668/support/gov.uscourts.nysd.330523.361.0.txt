Having demonstrated that the Republic of Argentina ("Argentina") has breached Para-
graph 1(c) (the "Equal Treatment Provision" or "Provision") of the Fiscal Agency Agreement
("FAA"), NML Capital, Ltd. (""NML") respectfully renews its motion under Federal Rule of Civ-
il Procedure 65(d) and the Court's inherent equitable powers for an order specifically enforcing
the Provision.

IL INTRODUCTION

As the Court well knows, Argentina has a long-established history of defaulting on its
sovereign debt. See EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 473 F.3d 463, 466 n.2 (2d Cir. 2007). To
induce investors to purchase its bonds despite this history of misconduct, Argentina promised
them, in the Equal Treatment Provision, that their "payment obligations" under those bonds
"shall at all times rank at least equally with all its other present and future unsecured and unsu-
bordinated External Indebtedness."" Dec. 7 Order at 1-2 (quoting Paragraph 1(c) of the FAA).
In other words, Argentina guaranteed that even if it defaulted on its payment obligations yet
again, its bondholders would stand on footing at least equal to that of all other unsecured, exter-
nal creditors-including future creditors-if Argentina eventually resumed repayment of its
debts. That guarantee was a meaningful protection against the all-too-likely prospect of default:
It ensured prospective purchasers of the bonds that Argentina could not cast them aside indefi-
nitely in favor of other creditors.

On December 7, 2011, the Court held that Argentina repeatedly violated-and continues
to violate-that Equal Treatment Provision. Specifically, the Court found that Argentina
breached the Equal Treatment Provision when "it made payments currently due under the [2005
and 2010] Exchange Bonds, while persisting in its refusal to satisfy its payment obligations cur-

rently due under NML's Bonds" (Dec. 7 Order at 4), and when it enacted laws that codified its

intentions to never pay NML (id. at 5).
Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 361 Filed 01/06/12 Page 7 of 24

Argentina's contends that the only available remedy for such a violation is a declaration
of default and a money judgment. But this Court rejected that argument when Argentina last ad-
vanced it, stating, "if you're standing there and you want me to say, well, that may be true [that
Argentina breached the Equal Treatment Provision] but nothing can be done about it to enforce
[that] clause [beyond ordering money damages], I just don't accept it." Transcript of September
28, 2011 Argument ("Tr."), 28:1-3 (emphases added). The Court was correct: Courts enforce
promises similar to that of the Equal Treatment Provision through orders of specific perfor-
mance. See, e.g., BIB Constr. Co. v. Fireman's Ins. Co., 214 A.D.2d 521, 523 (N.Y. App. Div.
1995).

By this motion, NML accordingly asks the Court to enter an order of specific perfor-
mance that directs Argentina to treat its payment obligations to NML no worse than its payment
obligations to other external creditors.

Argentina's routinized breach of the Equal Treatment Provision satisfies all of the re-
quirements for an order of specific performance. First, Argentina's violation of the Equal
Treatment Provision cannot be remedied adequately with money judgments. Argentina's con-
duct over the last decade amply demonstrates that money judgments are inadequate remedies for
Argentina's repudiation of its obligations. But beyond that, Argentina's breach of the Equal
Treatment Provision cannot be remedied with money damages because the Equal Treatment Pro-
vision promised not the payment of money, but instead guaranteed creditors that their payment
obligations would hold a particular position in relation to other creditors. That promised posi-
tion-like a security interest-was designed to provide additional protection in the event of de-
fault, enhancing NML's prospect of recovering real assets in satisfaction of Argentina's debts

and providing relief separate from, and in addition to, the money judgments that would be avail-
Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 361 Filed 01/06/12 Page 8 of 24

able in the absence of the Provision and that Argentina historically has been adept at evading.
Although money judgments may remedy Argentina's nonpayment of its debts, the only way to
restore NML to the position vis-a-vis other creditors that Argentina guaranteed to it is to order
Argentina to uphold its payment obligations to NML when it upholds its payment obligations to
others.

Second, the balance of equities clearly favors specific performance. Without an order,
NML will have no means of enforcing its rights under the Equal Treatment Provision. Denial of
specific performance thus would impose on NML the continuing hardship of unequal treatment.
On the other hand, an order of specific performance would impose no undue hardship on Argen-
tina. Argentina clearly is capable of complying: With foreign exchange reserves of more than
$46 billion, Argentina easily could honor 100% of its debts to NML and the Exchange Bond-
holders. Cohen Decl. Ex. A.

Finally, an order of specific performance would advance the public interest. The public
interest is protected when creditors, especially those participating in the critically important mar-
ket for sovereign debt, know that their contractual rights will be enforced.

The order of specific performance NML now proposes ("Proposed Order," filed simulta-
neously herewith) would compel Argentina to fulfill its payment obligations to NML when it
elects to fulfill its payment obligations to participants in its 2005 and 2010 exchange offers (""Ex-
change Bondholders"). Because the Equal Treatment Provision commands equal treatment of
"payment obligations" and the term "payment obligation" in this context admits of no definition
except the duty to pay the amount currently due and owing, the payment due to NML under the
Proposed Order is calculated as the total amount Argentina currently owes to NML in these three

actions (08 Civ. 6978, 09 Civ. 1707, and 09 Civ. 1708) multiplied by a percentage that is the
Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 361 Filed 01/06/12 Page 9 of 24

same percentage that Argentina pays (or intends to pay) of amounts currently due to Exchange
Bondholders. Thus, if Argentina pays Exchange Bondholders half of what of is currently due to
them, it would be required to pay half of what it is currently due to NML. Similarly, if Argentina
pays Exchange Bondholders the full amount that is currently due to them, it would be required to
pay NML the full amount that is currently due to it.

The Proposed Order thus potentially could chart a course toward the end of this decade-
long litigation. Unlike money judgments, the Proposed Order would carry with it the threat of
the Court's contempt power. Although Argentina has casually disregarded the Court's money
judgments for years, it is unlikely to subject itself to an order of contempt. Moreover, upon be-
ing notified of the Proposed Order, the reputable New York institutions that play an essential part
in distributing Argentina's payments to the Exchange Bondholders-including Argentina's at-
torneys-would be required to conform to the Proposed Order and could not assist Argentina in
violating that Order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2). Even if Argentina were willing to face con-
tempt, these third-parties could be expected to honor the law. And of course the Court would
retain jurisdiction to modify the Proposed Order should Argentina devise new tactics to evade it.

In short, the equitable relief NML seeks would make clear that Argentina can no longer
escape this Court's judgments by ignoring them and would send a powerful signal about Argen-
tina's obligations to other litigating bondholders, potentially enabling them to pursue a global
resolution of Argentina's debts arising from the FAA. Accordingly, Argentina may at long last
conclude that it must put an end to its standoff with all of its aggrieved bondholders.

Il. BACKGROUND

A. The Court Has Held That Argentina Breached The Equal Treatment Provision And
Invited This Renewed Motion For Equitable Relief

As discussed in the parties' prior briefing and at oral argument, Argentina has systemati-
Case 1:08-cv-06978-TPG Document 361 Filed 01/06/12 Page 10 of 24

cally disregarded the Equal Treatment Provision it drafted and included in its bonds. After
promising NML that its payment obligations would "`at all times rank at least equally with all its
other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated External Indebtedness'" (Dec. 7 Order at
1-2 (quoting Paragraph 1(c) of the FAA)), Argentina repudiated those obligations and created a
new class of future indebtedness, on which it made payments. Specifically, in 2005 and again in
2010, Argentina issued "exchange offers," which permitted bondholders to exchange their de-
faulted bonds for new bonds of substantially less value, but that Argentina promised would ac-
tually be serviced (thereinafter "2005 Exchange Offer" and "2010 Exchange Offer", collectively
"Exchange Offers"). See id. at 2. In order to formalize further this scheme of paying only those
bondholders that accepted its Exchange Offers, Argentina passed Law 26,017 and Law 26,547,
which codified Argentina's stated policy of never paying bondholders who declined its Exchange
Offers. See id. at 3.

After the 2010 Exchange Offer and Argentina's enactment of Law 26,547, NML filed its
Motion For Partial Summary Judgment And For Injunctive Relief Pursuant To The Equal Treat-
ment Provision, and Argentina filed responsive papers. The Court held an oral argument on
NML's motion on September 28, 2011.

_ On December 7, 2011, the Court issued an order granting partial summary judgment to
NML, finding that Argentina violated the Equal Treatment Provision. In that Order, the Court
found Argentina violated the Provision "by relegating NML's bonds to a non-paying class by
failing to pay the obligations currently due under NML's Bonds while at the same time making
payments currently due to holders of other unsecured and unsubordinated External Indebtedness
or by legislative enactment." Dec. 7 Order at 4. Specifically, the Court found that Argentina

violated NML's rights under the Equal Treatment Provision in at least two ways: First, "when it
