Case No. 4-04 CV0000985BRW

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ACCENTURE’S MOTION TO
COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS RESPONSIVE TO
ACCENTURE DOCUMENT REQUESTS, AND TO SHORTEN RESPONSE TIME FOR
MOTION PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 7.2(b)
Accenture respectfully submits this Memorandum in support of its motion to compel
production of documents responsive to Requests 38 and 39 of Accenture’s August 2008 First Set
of Document Requests and Request 10 of Accenture’s June 2009 Second Set of Document
Requests, which seek historical GSA Schedule pricelists. These historical GSA Schedule
pricelists are important to rebut the Government’s assertion of actual damages, and are needed
for upcoming expert reports and testimony relating to these issues. The Government
indisputably has such pricelists in its possession, but has failed to produce all but a small
handful. The Government has rejected Accenture’s repeated requests for these documents,
despite Accenture’s efforts to narrow the scope of its requests and ease any burden on the
Government. Therefore, this Court should order the Government to produce the requested
documents.

Because the requested documents are needed for expert reports, Defendants
respectfully request pursuant to Local Rule 7.2(b) that the time for Plaintiff to respond to this
Motion be set for Wednesday, April 6, 2011.
BACKGROUND
The General Services Administration manages the GSA Schedules Program, which
provides Federal agencies “with a simplified buying process for obtaining commercial supplies
and services at prices associated with volume buying.” See 48 CFR § 8.402(a). Interested
vendors submit proposals to GSA that include a list of items and proposed prices, along with
information to help GSA determine whether the prices offered are fair and reasonable. For all
items ultimately listed on a vendor’s GSA Schedule pricelist, GSA “has already determined the
prices . . . to be fair and reasonable.” See 48 CFR § 8.404(d). GSA’s Director of Acquisition
Operations for General Supplies and Services acknowledged that GSA Schedules reflect the
Government’s determination that offered prices are fair and reasonable. See, e.g., Transcript of
Jeff Koses at p. 50, l. 11-21.
Accenture’s document requests seek documents related to the GSA Schedules of
third-party vendors, including vendors’ historical GSA Schedule pricelists. Request number 38
from Accenture’s First Set of Document Requests, dated August 21, 2008, seeks documents
“related to the Government’s determinations of price reasonableness” in connection with the use
of any vendors’ products for which the Government believes Accenture is liable. The
Government stated in response to this request that it would “produce all non-privileged
documents” that discuss price reasonableness in connection with the federal contracts for which
it seeks damages from Accenture. Request number 39 from Accenture’s First Set of Document
Requests seeks documents “related to the Government’s decision to purchase third-party
products through [Accenture].” The Government stated in response to this request that it would

Case 4:04-cv-00985-BRW Document 469

“produce non-privileged responsive documents.” Request number 10 from Accenture’s June 18,
2009 Second Set of Document Requests asks for all documents in the possession of GSA
concerning, among other things, the Government’s acquisition of information technology from
Systems Integration Consultants, including Accenture. The Government stated in response to
that request that it would produce “relevant and responsive” documents pertaining to the GSA
Schedule that is at issue in this case.
Contrary to these representations, in the more than 20 months since these requests
were served the Government has produced only a tiny handful of documents associated with the
GSA Schedules of vendors that it has put at issue by seeking damages for Accenture invoices
that included those vendors’ products. The Government concedes it maintains historical GSA
Schedule pricelists but refuses to produce them.
On September 27, 2010, counsel for Accenture sent a letter to the Government
pointing out that it had not received historical GSA Schedule pricelists responsive to its
Requests, including those of SAP, Manugistics, Hewlett Packard, EMC, ePlus, Sun, Compaq,
Cisco, and others. 1 The Government responded by e-mail October 4, 2010, stating the relevance
of the Schedules “depended on Accenture’s defenses” and that the request was burdensome. On
November 3, 2010, counsel for Accenture sent another letter to the Government, explaining that
the requested GSA Schedule pricelists were relevant as they reflect prices the Government
determined were fair and reasonable, as well as the value the Government believed it received
from the products purchased from Accenture. 2 The letter also offered to narrow the scope of the
request to alleviate any burden concerns the Government had.

Following the Government’s continued failure to produce the requested Schedule
pricelists, Accenture counsel wrote a third letter on February 17, 2011 again seeking those
documents and indicating its intent to file a motion to compel were the Government to continue
its refusal to produce. 3 On a teleconference one week later, counsel for the Government
indicated that the Government had produced GSA Schedules for SAP and Manugistics and that it
would produce the Schedules for HP, AMS, EMC, Compaq, Oracle and Sun. The Government
also requested a list of all the Schedules Accenture needed. Accenture counsel provided that list
March 7, 2011. 4 As of March 30, 2011, the Government had only produced some historic GSA
Schedules for Oracle. The Government has yet to produce the vast majority of relevant and
responsive Schedules to which it is entitled.
The historical GSA Schedule pricelists that Accenture has requested will rebut the
Government’s damages claims because they will show both 1) that prices paid by the
Government for third-party products from Accenture were fair and reasonable and 2) that the
Government did not suffer any damages as a result of purchasing third-party products through
Accenture. The Government’s production of these documents is long overdue and Accenture
urgently needs them.
ARGUMENT
I.

Accenture Is Entitled To Documents Responsive to Requests 38 and 39 of Its
First Set of Document Requests and Request 10 of Its Second Set of Document
Requests
Accenture is entitled to the discovery that it seeks regarding the Government’s

historical GSA Schedule pricelists because such information is relevant to any damages for
which Accenture might be found liable under the False Claims Act.

Generally, “parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, so long
as it is ‘relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.’” Keaton v. Prop. & Cas.
Ins. Co. of Hartford, No. 4:07-CV-634-BSM, 2008 WL 2519790, at *1 (E.D. Ark. June 20,
2008).
The phrase “relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action” has been construed broadly to encompass any matter that
bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that could
bear on, an issue that is or may be in the case. The scope of
discovery is not limited to the issues raised by the pleadings, for
discovery itself is designed to help define and clarify the issues.
Nor is the scope of discovery limited to the merits of a case, for a
variety of fact-oriented issues may arise during litigation that are
not related to the merits.
Id. (citing Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978)).
The historical GSA pricelists of third-party vendors that Accenture seeks are relevant
and discoverable because the Government seeks False Claims Act damages for invoices
submitted by Accenture that included those vendors’ products. If a violation of the False Claims
Act is proven, damages are the difference between the value of what the Government actually
received and what it should have received under its contracts with defendant. United States v.
Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 316 n.13 (1976); United States v. Cooperative Grain & Supply Co.,
476 F.2d 47, 63 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Advance Tool Co., 902 F. Supp. 1011, 1017
(W.D. Mo. 1995), aff’d, 86 F.3d 1159 (8th Cir. 1996). This principle was recently reiterated in
United States v. Science Applications International Corp., 2010 WL 4909467, at *18 (D.C. Cir.
Dec. 3, 2010):
In a case where the defendant agreed to provide goods or services to the
government, the proper measure of damages is the difference between the
value of the goods or services actually provided by the contractor and the
value the goods and services would have had to the government had they
been delivered as promised. . . .
To establish damages, the government must show not only that the
defendant’s false claims caused the government to make payment that it
5

would have otherwise withheld, but also that the performance the
government received was worth less than it believed it had purchased.
The historical GSA Schedule pricelists Accenture requested in Requests 38 and 39 of
its First Set of Document Requests and Request 10 of its Second Set of Document Requests bear
directly on this issue, as they are highly probative of the Government’s assessment of the value
of the goods and services it purchased from Accenture and the Government’s assessment that
Accenture’s offered prices were fair and reasonable. Despite repeated inquiries and efforts by
Accenture to facilitate the production of these documents, the Government has not produced
them. Therefore, the Court should order the Government to produce all historical GSA Schedule
pricelists identified in Exhibit D the Government has not already produced forthwith.
II.

The Court Should Limit The Time To Respond To This Motion
Accenture has requested the documents at issue for years. These documents are needed

for Accenture to rebut the Government’s expert reports, for which the deadline is April 24, 2011,
and to revise Accenture’s affirmative reports, if needed. By requiring, pursuant to Local Rule
7.2(b), that the Government respond to this motion no later than April 6, 2011, the Court will
allow the Government sufficient time to respond to this motion, while ensuring that the motion is
ripe for prompt adjudication.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Accenture’s motion should be granted.
