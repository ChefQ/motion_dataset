STATEMENT OF NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff Donald M. Durkin (“Durkin”) has asserted a breach of contract, various tort
claims and a civil rights claim against the City of Newark and Individual Defendants
(cumulatively “Newark”). Newark filed a Third-Party Complaint against Durkin’s surety,
Federal Insurance Company (“Federal”). Federal seeks to exclude the errata sheets provided by
Newark’s 30(b)(6) designee Carol Houck to her deposition testimony.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Houck’s errata sheets are appropriate clarifications of her testimony, which spanned four
days and during which Houck was interrogated repeatedly on key details, yet in a random and
confusing manner without the benefit of documents to review. Federal is free to question Houck
at trial regarding any perceived inconsistency between her deposition testimony and Errata
corrections.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Newark has at every instance in this lawsuit asserted that the November 21, 2003 letter
provided written notice in satisfaction of the construction contract and performance bond
requirements. Carol Houck was deposed over four days, during which she was interrogated on
the same topics at various times, and without the benefit of documents to review, including the
seven day notice requirement of the contract.
ARGUMENT
Federal’s Motion to exclude the errata sheets of Carol Houck is just another bite at the
summary judgment apple. Without her clarifications, Federal will assuredly attempt to use her

testimony to argue once again (as Durkin has) that the November 21, 2003 letter was not a seven
day notice. This Court has already ruled that whether the content of that letter satisfied the City’s
obligations is a question for the factfinder. (D.I. #132 April 5, 2006 Memorandum Order
denying Federal’s Motion for Summary Judgment).
At Federal’s request, the Court allowed Houck’s deposition to exceed the seven hour
Federal Rule. In fact, her deposition spanned four days and over 750 pages of testimony were
taken. During that time, Houck was grilled by counsel for Federal, whose behavior was so
offensive, Houck was compelled to outline her objection in a May 16, 2006 letter to the
undersigned. Houck wrote:
[Mr. Kingsley] assured Judge Sleet that the additional days were necessary as he had
new questions and exhibits to present. In reality, a large number of the Houck
exhibits he presented were the same as those presented by counsel for the Durkins,
Paul Logan...This was disappointing as well as enlightening as to his urgency to
mislead even the Judge in this case.
:
[D]uring my deposition, admittedly an important and highly legal exercise, Mr.
Kingsley’s behavior was in my viewpoint highly unprofessional. It included his
yelling questions at me, constantly making noises and huffing and puffing following
my answers to questions and even continually tossing his pen into the air and
catching it directly across the table from me. While at the time I attempted to ignore
his unprofessional and possible intentional behavior, I have since had the
opportunity to witness his behavior at the deposition of Donald M. Durkin, Jr. on
May 10, 2006. Remarkably, Mr. Kingsley was in great control of himself...
(Exhibit A). And as to her errata comments:
While Mr. Kingsley is clearly irked by my making corrections to my testimony, I
have been advised that the option to make corrections to unclear or misleading
responses is my legal right, and in fact on behalf of the City of Newark, my
responsibility. The . . . comments related to my testimony, fail to paint a picture I
would agree to.
Houck was quite right; Fed. Rule Civ.P. 30(e) allows a deponent to make changes in

form or substance. “[I]n determining whether a material issue of fact exists, an affidavit may not
be disregarded because it conflicts with the affiant's prior sworn statements.” Franks v. Nimmo,
796 F.2d 1230, 1237 (10th Cir.1986), and see, Burns v. Board of County Com'rs of Jackson
County, 330 F.3d 1275, 1282 (C.A.10 2003) (ruling that errata corrections should be treated no
differently than affidavits). As the Court noted, the import of the November 21 letter will be
decided by the jury, as it is a material fact in contention.
Errata corrections are appropriate when the earlier testimony reflects confusion. Id.
Regarding her third day of testimony, Houck wrote in the Errata Sheet:
Once again during my deposition there were repeated references to various exhibits,
out of order and with, I believe, the intent to confuse. I have now had the opportunity
to review the deposition and further clarify that it is my belief that the letter of
November 21, 2003 (Exhibit 20) served to . . . Provide notice of Default and
termination to both the Surety (Bond) and Durkin (Contract) . . .
(And see Exhibit B, Pages 353-355 of testimony where Houck asks to see the relevant
documents). Further Houck wrote:
[M]y reply on line 9 is incorrect if it suggests that the November 21, 2003 letter was
not the seven-day notice letter. My reply, “I don’t believe so.” would reflect my
understanding that the November 21, 2003 letter was not the only effort made by
Newark to put both Durkin and the Surety on notice. I believe that the November 21,
2003 letter was one of the seven-day notices as were the February 3 and February 4,
2004 letters.
Houck’s Errata Sheet clarifications were appropriate under Rule 30(e), do not meet the
criteria of a “sham affidavit,” and should stand as written as clarification of her testimony.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Defendant City of Newark respecfully requests that this Court deny
Federal’s Motion to Exclude the Deposition Errata Sheets of Carol Houck.
