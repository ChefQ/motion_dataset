Case No. 2:10-cv-01354-LDG-PAL

Plaintiffs,

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE

vs.

15
16

NEVADA READY MIX CORPORATION,
a Delaware Corporation,

17

Defendant.

18

20

Plaintiffs, the Trustees of the Teamsters Local 631 Security Fund for Southern Nevada

21

(hereinafter “Security Fund”), hereby oppose Defendant Nevada Ready Mix Corporation’s

22

(“NRM”) Motion for Settlement Conference (“NRM’s Motion”).

23
24
25

NRM does not cite to any rule or other authority for its Motion. If one assumes, even
though NRM does not so state, that its Motion is pursuant to Local Rule 16-5, that rule is limited
to “appropriate” cases for a settlement conference. This case is not yet such a case. Specifically,

26
27
28

the Security Fund does not believe a settlement conference is appropriate or beneficial at this
time. Discovery in this case has just begun and the parties have only recently exchanged initial
20036\111\1464084.3

disclosures. The parties’ discovery schedule was just filed a few weeks ago. (Dkt. 14.) Neither

2

party has propounded any discovery yet. Discovery is currently scheduled to continue until March

3

1, 2011. Id.

4

The current record, therefore, is little more than the Security Fund’s demand for

5

delinquent contributions and NRM’s refusal to pay the demanded amount. Thus, the Security

7

Fund intends to conduct discovery and ascertain NRM’s defenses, if any. Because that has not

8

occurred yet, the Security Fund is not in position to discuss settlement.

9

Moreover, as NRM points out in its Motion, the Security Fund asked NRM to provide its

10

settlement offer to the Security Fund on October 21, 2010, but NRM failed to do so. The Security

Fund is not inclined to learn of NRM’s position regarding settlement for the first time in a

12
13
14

settlement conference, where the only possible response will be to take it under advisement,
research and evaluate it.

15

While there may come a time when it is appropriate to conduct settlement negotiations,

16

first the Security Fund must conduct discovery and determine what, if any, defenses to its claims

17

exist that might justify any compromise settlement. Absent that, the Security Fund simply will not

18

settle, so there is no reason to have a settlement conference at this time.

19

Finally, NRM’s concerns over accruing interest and liquidated damages are easily laid to

20
21

rest: NRM should simply pay any undisputed amounts now. Further, it should present the

22

Security Fund with any settlement positions or defenses for consideration now, instead of

23

awaiting to reveal its secret positions in a forced settlement conference.
