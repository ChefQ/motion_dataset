MOTOROLA’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO
EXCLUDE MATTERS OUTSIDE THE PLEADINGS, OR FOR OTHER RELIEF
Defendants Motorola Mobility LLC (f/k/a Motorola Mobility, Inc.) and Motorola
Solutions, Inc. (collectively, “Motorola”) submit this Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’
Motion to Exclude Matters Outside the Pleadings, or for Other Relief [Dkt. 143] (the “Motion”).1
In deciding a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),
this Court “may rely on the complaint, its proper attachments, documents incorporated into the
complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.” Wolcott v.
Sebelius, 635 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). See
1

The relief that Plaintiffs seek in their Motion is unclear. Plaintiffs identify only “[s]ome of the
matters within the scope of the [Motion],” which “include, but are not limited to,” the
Declaration of Chahira Solh in Support of Defendant Motorola Mobility, Inc.’s Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint [Dkt. 70] and Exhibit D to that Declaration. (Mot. at 2.) Yet in
the Memorandum Briefs [Dkts. 138 and 157] (the “Memorandum Briefs”) supporting its Motion
to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Third Amended and Supplemental Complaint [Dkt. 136] (the “Motion to
Dismiss”), Motorola does not reference these two documents. This Response in Opposition to
the Motion therefore addresses the four documents that Motorola does reference in the
Memorandum Briefs. Motorola respectfully requests the right to a sur-rebuttal in the event that
Plaintiffs hereafter identify additional documents subject to the Motion or otherwise provide
clarification on the relief they seek in the Motion.

also Salts v. Moore, 107 F. Supp. 2d 732, 735 (N.D. Miss. 2000). Accordingly, Motorola has
referred the Court to the following four documents:
1.

Exhibit C to the Declaration of Chahira Solh in Support of Defendants

Motorola Mobility, Inc.’s and Motorola Solutions, Inc.’s Rebuttal in Support of Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint [Dkt. 91-1] (the “Solh Declaration”), a discussion paper entitled
On the Introduction of Band 15.
2.

Exhibit D to the Solh Declaration, a discussion paper entitled TS36.101:

Lower 700 MHz Band 15.
3.

Exhibit F to the Solh Declaration, Comments of Research In Motion

Corporation filed on June 1, 2012 in Promoting Interoperability in the 700 MHz Commercial
Spectrum, WT Docket No. 12-69 (Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n).
4.

Exhibit H to the Solh Declaration, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

issued on March 21, 2012 in Promoting Interoperability in the 700 MHz Commercial Spectrum,
WT Docket No. 12-69 (Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n).
Plaintiffs contest the Court’s discretion to consider these documents. This
challenge, however, rests improperly on Plaintiffs’ apparent misapprehension of the law, the
nature of the documents, and the purpose of considering the documents.
The operative Third Amended and Supplemental Complaint (the “TAC”)
references Exhibits C, D, and H to the Solh Declaration. Exhibit D, for example, is referenced in
Paragraph 189 of the TAC. It is the paper that Motorola submitted to the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (the “3GPP”), recommending Band 17. Because Plaintiffs allege that
Exhibit D effectively commenced implementation of the conspiracy underlying Plaintiffs’ claims
against Motorola, Exhibit D is central to the claims in this case. (See Combined Memorandum

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 158 Filed: 04/24/13 3 of 9 PageID #: 6204

Brief in Response to Defendants’ Second Motions to Dismiss [Dkt. 150] (the “Opposition”) at
42–43.)
Exhibit C to the Solh Declaration is the paper that Ericsson submitted to the
3GPP, referenced in Paragraphs 194 and 225 of the TAC. According to the Opposition,
Exhibit C “gives credence to [Plaintiffs’] allegations that the technical justifications for Band 17
were false.” (Opp’n at 34.) These allegations are central to the claims in this case. (See Opp’n
at 2 (“The centrality of this issue—the pretextual nature of the interference justifications—to the
entire case cannot be overstated.”).) Exhibit C itself is therefore central to the claims in this case.
Exhibit H to the Solh Declaration is the Federal Communications Commission’s
(the “FCC”) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, referenced in Paragraph 269 of the TAC. Like
Exhibit C, Exhibit H functions to “demonstrat[e] that interference did not justify the creation of
Band 17, and that Defendants’ statements to the contrary were false, pretextual, and a ruse to
cover their true motive.” (Opp’n at 15–16.) And like Exhibit C, Exhibit H is therefore central to
the claims in this case.
In essence, Exhibits C, D, and H to the Solh Declaration are documents
referenced by the operative complaint and thereby incorporated into the operative complaint by
reference. And Exhibits C, D, and H are documents central to the claims in this case. The Court
may therefore properly rely on Exhibits C, D, and H to the Solh Declaration in deciding
Motorola’s Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See Lone Star
Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that on a
Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court may consider documents that “are central to the claim and
referenced by the complaint”).

In addition or in the alternative, the Court may properly rely on Exhibits C, D, and
H to the Solh Declaration, as well as Exhibit F to the Solh Declaration, because these documents
constitute matters of which the Court may take judicial notice. On a motion to dismiss, this
Court may take judicial notice of “matters of public record.” Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d
454, 461 n.9 (5th Cir. 2007) (“[I]t is clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to take judicial
notice of matters of public record.”). In particular, the Court may take judicial notice of
documents filed with an administrative agency. R2 Invs. LDC v. Phillips, 401 F.3d 638, 640 n.2
(5th Cir. 2005) (A “court may . . . take judicial notice of documents in the public record,
including documents filed with [an administrative agency], and may consider such documents in
determining a motion to dismiss.”).
As noted above, Exhibits C and D to the Solh Declaration are papers submitted to
the 3GPP. Exhibit F to the Solh Declaration are Comments that Research In Motion Corporation
filed with the FCC, an administrative agency. And, as noted above, Exhibit H is a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking that the FCC issued. These four Exhibits are publicly available
documents2 and are thus matters of public record ripe for judicial notice.
Plaintiffs appear to take issue with documents referenced “for the substance” of
statements of “disputed facts” in the documents. (Mot. at 1–2; Opp’n at 17–18.) As evident in
the Memorandum Briefs, however, Motorola references Exhibits C, D, F, and H to the Solh

Declaration not for the truth of statements in the Exhibits. Rather, Motorola references the
Exhibits for the fact of their existence, as documents demonstrating that Plaintiffs’ claims are
implausible. In its Opening Memorandum Brief, for example, Motorola refers to Exhibit C in
discussing Plaintiffs’ claim that the “‘decision to create Band 17 was made on the basis of [the
analyses of AT&T, Qualcomm, and Motorola] alone.’” (Opening Br. at 10–11 (quoting TAC ¶
224).) Motorola then explains that this claim is implausible, given the existence of Exhibit C, a
document demonstrating that in 3GPP proceedings, Ericsson stated: “There are indeed some
technical benefits of introducing Band [17].” (Opening Br. at 11 (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).) That is, Motorola does not seek judicial notice of any statement in Exhibit C
that Band 17 confers some technical benefits. Rather, Motorola seeks judicial notice of the
existence of Exhibit C, as a document that demonstrates that comments from a company not
named as a conspirator informed the 3GPP’s decision to create Band 17, thus rendering
implausible the claim that the decision to create Band 17 transpired “in the ‘absence of any
presentation or consideration [of] other viewpoints.’” (Opening Br. at 10–11 (quoting TAC ¶
250).)
Similarly, Motorola seeks judicial notice of the existence of Exhibit D, as a
document that demonstrates that in proposing Band 17, Motorola provided a legitimate business
reason for supporting Band 17, thus rendering implausible the claim that Motorola’s support of
Band 17 was “against its own self-interest.” (See Opening Br. at 7–8.) Motorola likewise seeks
judicial notice of the existence of Exhibit F, as a document that demonstrates that a manufacturer
of devices other than Motorola provided a legitimate business reason for supporting Band 17,
thus rendering implausible the claim that Motorola’s support of Band 17 was “against its own
self-interest.” (See Rebuttal Br. at 8.) And Motorola seeks judicial notice of the existence of

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 158 Filed: 04/24/13 6 of 9 PageID #: 6207

Exhibit H, as a document that demonstrates issues that the FCC has or has not addressed. (See
Opening Br. at 17 n.6.)
Plaintiffs then contend that the Court must deem Motorola’s Motion to Dismiss as
a motion for summary judgment, providing no explanation and citing no authority. This
contention is in fact contrary to controlling authority. See, e.g., Davis v. Bayless, Bayless &
Stokes, 70 F.3d 367, 372 n.3 (5th Cir. 1995) (noting that the district court did not err in
dismissing claims on a motion to dismiss, rather than treating the motion as one for summary
judgment because “[f]ederal courts are permitted to refer to matters of public record when
deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss”). If, however, the Court concludes that considering one
or more of Exhibits C, D, F, and H to the Solh Declaration would require the Court to convert
Motorola’s Motion to Dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, Motorola respectfully
requests that the Court disregard those Exhibits and preserve Motorola’s motion as one to
dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).
In sum, Motorola respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ Motion and,
on the Motion to Dismiss, consider Exhibits C, D, F, and H to the Solh Declaration, as
documents that the TAC referenced and incorporated by reference and/or as matters of public
record that are properly subject to judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201.
