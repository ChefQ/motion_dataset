NON-PARTY LT. GOV. DONNA LYNNE’S OPPOSITION TO OBESLO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENT WITHHELD BY FORMER
DIRECTOR DONNA LYNNE

4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 20

Non-Party Lieutenant Governor Donna L. Lynne (“Lt. Gov. Lynne”), for her
Opposition to Obeslo Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production of Document Withheld by
Former Director Donna Lynne (the “Motion”) (Dkt. 106), states as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs have brought this Motion to compel Lt. Gov. Lynne to produce a single e-

mail dated February 29, 2016 (the “Privileged E-mail”) that was withheld from Lt. Gov.
Lynne’s document production in response to Plaintiffs’ subpoena. Despite the fact that
Lt. Gov. Lynne objected to Plaintiffs’ subpoena on the grounds that it sought documents
on topics unrelated to this lawsuit, Plaintiffs’ Motion fails to address the relevance of this
document.

The Privileged E-mail relates to legal advice provided to her as an

independent director of the Great-West Funds, Inc. (“Great-West Funds”) by counsel for
Great-West Funds regarding director independence with respect to the requirements
under the Investment Company Act (“ICA”) regarding directors “who have no interest in
or affiliation with the advisor.”1 Significantly, the Privileged E-mail does not discuss
investment advisory fees, the 15(c) process or this lawsuit.
In addition, Plaintiffs’ argument that the Privileged E-mail cannot be privileged is
flawed. Plaintiffs assert that Ryan Logsdon’s e-mail to Lt. Gov. Lynne is not privileged
because Mr. Logsdon was an attorney for Defendant Great-West Capital Management,
LLC (“GWCM”), as well as GWCM’s parent company. Plaintiffs, however, conveniently
ignore the fact that Ryan Logsdon sent the e-mail at issue in his capacity as counsel for

1

See 15 U.S.C. §§ 80a-2(a)(19), 80a-10(a). The term “independent director” as used
herein refers to a director who is not an “interested person” as defined under the ICA.

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 20

Great-West Funds. It is uncontested that Mr. Logsdon serves as counsel to Great-West
Funds, as is clearly set forth in publicly available documents and in testimony by another
independent director during her deposition in this very lawsuit. As Plaintiffs do not, and
cannot, dispute that the Privileged E-mail meets all the other requirements for the
attorney-client privilege, the Court should find that this document is protected by the
attorney-client privilege. In any event, Lt. Gov. Lynne will provide a copy of the Privileged
E-mail to the Court for an in camera inspection if the Court finds that such an inspection
is necessary.
Finally, Plaintiffs incorrectly argue that the fiduciary exception to the attorney-client
privilege should apply in this case, allowing Plaintiffs to view the Privileged E-mail. A
fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not exist under federal common
law, as the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has never held that such an exception exists.
Moreover, even if such an exception did exist, it would not apply in this case because
most courts that apply the exception, including district courts in the Tenth Circuit that have
applied the exception, require a showing of good cause. Plaintiffs do not attempt to show
that they have good cause for the exception to apply in this case, nor can they as the
relevant factors weigh against applying the exception in this case. Because the document
sought by this Motion is protected by the attorney-client privilege, the Court should deny
Plaintiffs’ Motion.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On January 29, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against GWCM alleging a

violation of Section 36(b) of the ICA, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b). (Dkt. 1.) In their Complaint,

3
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 20

Plaintiffs allege that GWCM charged excessive investment advisory fees and seek
recovery of fees already “paid” to GWCM by shareholders of Great-West Funds. (Id. ¶¶
1, 100.) Plaintiffs have not brought any claim against Lt. Gov. Lynne.
On June 29, 2016, Plaintiffs served a subpoena on Lt. Gov. Lynne which requested
Lt. Gov. Lynne’s deposition and that Lt. Gov. Lynne produce certain documents prior to
her deposition. In particular, Request No. 3 in Plaintiffs’ subpoena requested that Lt. Gov.
Lynne produce:
All correspondence (including email) you have from January 2011 to the
date of deposition regarding: Great-West Funds, Inc., Great-West Capital
Management, LLC, Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co., or GreatWest Financial.
In response, Lt. Gov. Lynne served written objections to Plaintiffs’ subpoena,
including Request No. 3. (A true and correct copy of the letter dated July 12, 2016 from
David E. Bennett to Michael A. Wolff is attached hereto as Exhibit A.) Specifically, Lt.
Gov. Lynne objected to Request No. 3 on the grounds that it sought “all documents”
relating to Great-West Funds, which could include documents subject to the attorneyclient privilege. (Id.) In addition, Lt. Gov. Lynne objected to Request No. 3 on the grounds
that it is overly broad and unduly burdensome because it seeks documents related to
topics that are unrelated to this lawsuit. (Id.)
Subject to her objections, Lt. Gov. Lynne produced over 200 documents in
response to Plaintiffs’ subpoena. Lt. Gov. Lynne also provided Plaintiffs with a privilege
log for documents withheld from her production on the basis of privilege. (Ex. 1 to Pl.
Motion.) Upon reviewing Lt. Gov. Lynne’s privilege log, Plaintiffs’ counsel demanded that
Lt. Gov. Lynne produce four (4) of the documents listed on Lt. Gov. Lynne’s privilege log.

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 20

In an effort to resolve the dispute in good faith, counsel for Lt. Gov. Lynne conferred with
counsel for Plaintiffs, re-reviewed the four withheld documents sought by Plaintiffs, and
ultimately agreed to produce to Plaintiffs three of the four requested documents. Counsel
for Lt. Gov. Lynne informed counsel for Plaintiffs’ counsel that the remaining document,
the Privileged E-mail, would not be produced.
The Privileged E-mail is dated February 29, 2016. (Declaration of Donna Lynne
(“Lynne Decl.”) ¶ 3, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.) As
set forth on Lt. Gov. Lynne’s privilege log, the Privileged E-mail was sent from Ryan
Logsdon, Esq. to Lt. Gov. Lynne to provide legal advice to her as of the date of the e-mail
regarding director independence. (Id.) Mr. Logsdon is the “Vice President, Counsel &
Secretary” to Great-West Funds. (Excerpt from Statement of Additional Information for
the Great-West Funds dated April 29, 2016 (“SAI”) pp. 1, 30, a true and correct copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit C; Excerpt from Confidential Deposition of Gail
Klapper dated October 18, 2016 (“Klapper Dep.”) p. 88, a true and correct copy of which
is attached hereto as Exhibit D.) At the time the Privileged E-mail was sent, Lt. Gov.
Lynne was an independent director of Great-West Funds. (Lynne Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B.) No
other persons were carbon copied on the Privileged E-mail, and Lt. Gov. Lynne has not
shared the Privileged E-mail with any third parties. (Id. ¶ 4.) The Privileged E-mail does
not discuss any of the following: (i) fees paid by GWCM, (ii) the 15(c) process or (iii) this
lawsuit. (Id. ¶ 3.)

III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standard

A trial court is entrusted with “sound discretion” to deal with discovery disputes,
including motions to compel. Motley v. Marathon Oil Co., 71 F.3d 1547, 1550 (10th Cir.
1995). Under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, federal “common law — as
interpreted by United States courts in the light of reason and experience — governs a
claim of privilege . . . .” For the attorney-client privilege to protect a communication
between an attorney and client, the communication “must relate to legal advice or strategy
sought by the client.” See Estate of Booker v. City & County of Denver, No. 11-cv-00645RBJ-KMT, 2012 WL 2871719, at *2–3 (D. Colo. July 12, 2012).
B.

The Court Should Find That the Privileged E-mail Is Protected By the
Attorney-Client Privilege

In their Motion, Plaintiffs argue that the Privileged E-mail cannot be privileged
because Mr. Logsdon is a lawyer for GWCM and therefore cannot be an attorney for any
of the independent directors, including Lt. Gov. Lynne.2 Plaintiffs are incorrect.

2

As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of showing that the
Privileged E-mail is relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim because they fail to even address this
issue in their Motion. See Havens v. Johnson, No. 09-cv-01380-MSK-MEH, 2013 WL
1828245, at *3 (D. Colo. Apr. 30, 2013) (noting that when a discovery request is overly
broad on its face or when relevancy is not “readily apparent,” the party seeking discovery
has the burden the show the relevancy of the request). Here, the Privileged E-mail does
not discuss fees paid to GWCM, the 15(c) process or this litigation. In addition, because
it was sent on February 29, 2016, more than a month after Plaintiffs commenced this
lawsuit on January 29, 2016, it does not relate to the time period of GWCM’s alleged prior
wrongdoing as specified in Plaintiffs’ Complaint. (See Lynne Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B; Compl.
¶¶ 1, 100, Dkt. 1.) Given that Lt. Gov. Lynne properly objected to the Subpoena on the
grounds that it was overly broad and unduly burdensome and sought documents “relating
to topics that are unrelated to this lawsuit,” this Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion. (See
Ex. A.)
6
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 20

In the corporate context, the attorney-client privilege “exists to protect not only the
giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information
to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice.” Upjohn Co. v. United
States, 449 U.S. 383, 390 (1981). Additionally, the attorney-client privilege “protects from
forced disclosure any communication from an attorney to his client when made in the
course of giving legal advice.” Sprague v. Thorn Americas, Inc., 129 F.3d 1355, 1370
(10th Cir. 1997). There is no requirement that “the communication[] contain confidential
matters revealed by the client earlier to the attorney.” Id. at 1371.
In their Motion, Plaintiffs do not dispute that Mr. Logsdon is a licensed attorney.
However, Plaintiffs apparently fail to recognize or simply ignore that Mr. Logsdon serves
as “counsel” for Great-West Funds. As clearly set forth in a recent SAI, Mr. Logsdon is
the “Vice President, Counsel & Secretary” to the “Great-West Funds,” which is defined by
the SAI to mean Great West Funds, Inc., open-end management investment company
that offers all of the funds relating to Plaintiffs’ lawsuit. (Excerpt from SAI pp. 1, 30, Ex.
C; Klapper Dep. p. 88, Ex. D.) Therefore, as counsel for Great-West Funds, Mr. Logsdon
is clearly capable of providing legal advice to Lt. Gov. Lynne, an independent director of
Great-West Funds, regarding director independence issues.
Moreover, in the fund context, at least one court in the District of Colorado has held
that communications may be protected by the attorney-client privilege when each of the
parties to the communication has a “significant relationship” to the fund and are
responsible for ensuring that the fund complies with the law. See Ryskamp ex rel. Boulder

7
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 20

& Growth & Income Fund v. Looney, No. 10-cv-00842-WJM-KLM, 2011 WL 38615437,
at *5–7 (D. Col. Sept. 1, 2011).3

In Ryskamp, the court addressed whether

communications by counsel for the independent directors of a fund were protected by the
attorney-client privilege when interested directors and non-attorney employees of the fund
were present during the communications.

Id.

Because each of the parties had a

“significant relationship” to the fund and had duties to act for the fund, the court held that
such communications were privileged. Id. at *5. The court further reasoned that the
communications were within the scope of the duties provided to the fund by its agents
because all parties, including interested directors and counsel for the fund adviser, were
“tasked with ensuring that their management of the fund complies with the law.” Id. at *6.
In this case, Mr. Logsdon clearly has a duty to ensure that Great-West Funds
complies with applicable federal securities laws and regulations, including requirements
relating to director independence. Plaintiffs incorrectly assert that Mr. Logsdon is counsel
for only “Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company, the parent company of
[GWCM],” and not counsel for the Great-West Funds. (Pl. Motion p. 4.) To the contrary,
Mr. Logsdon has held the role of “counsel” for the Great-West Funds since 2010, including
on February 29, 2016, the date on which the Privileged E-mail was sent. (SAI p. 30, Ex.

3

While the Ryskamp court applied Colorado law to the issue of whether the relevant
communications were protected by the attorney-client privilege, federal law does not
differ from Colorado law on this issue. See Estate of Booker, 2012 WL 2871719, at *2–
3 (applying Ryskamp to a motion to compel when the issue of whether communications
were protected by the attorney-client privilege was governed by federal law); see also
Alliance Constr. Sol’ns, Inc. v. Dep’t of Corrections, 54 P.3d 861, 865–66 (Colo. 2002)
(applying Colorado law to the issue of whether the attorney-client privilege may protect
communications with an independent contractor by relying on federal law as articulated
in the Supreme Court’s decision in Upjohn).

4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 20

C; Klapper Dep. p. 88., Ex. D.) As counsel to the Great-West Funds, Mr. Logsdon has a
duty, among other things, to ensure its compliance with regulatory requirements, including
those relating to director independence. Thus, both Mr. Logsdon, as counsel to GreatWest Funds, and Lt. Gov. Lynne, as an independent director of Great-West Funds at the
time the Privileged E-mail was sent, had a significant relationship to the relevant funds.
In addition, both Mr. Logsdon and Lt. Gov. Lynne had duties to ensure that GreatWest Funds met, and continued to meet, the legal requirements associated with director
independence.

As Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel expressly states, the Investment

Company Act “requires that at least 40 percent of a mutual fund company’s board of
directors comprise individuals who have no interest in or affiliation with the advisor.” (Pl.
Motion p. 2 n.1 (citing 15 U.S.C. §§ 80a-2(a)(19), 80a-10(a)). Clearly, Mr. Logsdon and
Lt. Gov. Lynne must be allowed to engage in privileged communications to allow Mr.
Logsdon to provide the appropriate legal advice to ensure compliance with this
requirement.

Otherwise, the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, which is “to

encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients,” would be
subverted. See Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389.
Moreover, even if Mr. Logsdon were counsel for only GWCM (and not counsel for
Great-West Funds, which he clearly is), Mr. Logsdon would still have an interest in making
sure that Great-West Funds meets the relevant legal requirements relating to director
independence. GWCM obviously has an interest in ensuring that the funds it advises
comply with all applicable federal securities laws and regulations relating to director
independence, as any adverse consequences to the relevant funds of not complying with

9
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 20

such requirements would have an adverse effect on GWCM. Nothing prohibits counsel
for a fund adviser from providing legal advice to an independent director on a matter, such
as director independence, where the interests of the adviser and the fund are identical.
See Ryskamp, 2011 WL 38615437, at *5–7 (finding communications between counsel
for a fund’s independent directors and the fund’s interested directors and non-attorney
employees to be privileged when all parties to the communication were tasked with
ensuring that the fund complies with the law).
In their Motion to Compel, Plaintiffs further argue that Mr. Logsdon cannot be an
attorney for, or provide legal advice to, the Funds or Lt. Gov. Lynne because it would
create a conflict of interest for Mr. Logsdon.4 (Id.) Here, however, no such conflict of
interest exists. Instead, Plaintiffs confuse the issue of Great-West Funds’ compliance
with requirements for director independence with the compliance requirements for the
15(c) process. With respect to compliance with director independence requirements,
Great-West Funds and GWCM have a common legal interest in ensuring that Great-West
Funds at all times complies with all such requirements. Given that the 15(c) process (and
its relation to GWCM’s fees) could create the appearance that GWCM’s interests are not
aligned with the interests of Great-West Funds, the independent directors for the Funds
retain and utilize Vedder Price as independent counsel.

(Excerpt from Confidential

Deposition of Donna Lynne dated October 19, 2016 (“Lynne Dep.”) p. 19, a true and
correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit E.) Even if GWCM and Great-West

4

Plaintiffs cite no legal authority for the proposition that advice provided by an attorney
loses the protection of the attorney-client privilege simply because a conflict of interest
exists. (See Pl. Motion pp. 5–6.)
10
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 11 of 20

Funds may arguably have interests that are not identical on one issue (the 15(c) process),
a conflict of interest does not automatically arise on other issues where GWCM and GreatWest Funds share a common legal interest, such as ensuring compliance with director
independence requirements.
Notably, other than their argument that Mr. Logsdon cannot be an attorney for Lt.
Gov. Lynne, Plaintiffs do not otherwise dispute the applicability of the attorney-client
privilege to the Privileged E-mail. Nor can they, as the Privileged E-mail was sent from
Mr. Logsdon, as counsel for Great-West Funds, to Lt. Gov. Lynne, as an independent
director of Great-West Funds, to provide legal advice to Lt. Gov. Lynne regarding director
independence. (Lynne Decl. ¶ 3.) No other persons were copied on the Privileged Email, fulfilling the requirement of confidentiality. (Id. ¶ 4.) Moreover, Plaintiffs have not
argued, and cannot argue, that the privilege was waived because the Privileged E-mail
was not shared with any third parties by Lt. Gov. Lynne. (Id.) Therefore, the Court should
find that the Privileged E-mail is protected by the attorney-client privilege.
C.

The Court Should Find That the Fiduciary Exception to the AttorneyClient Privilege Does Not Apply to the Privileged E-mail

In addition, Plaintiffs argue that even if the Privileged E-mail is protected by the
attorney-client privilege, the fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege should
apply, allowing Plaintiffs (as shareholders of certain of the Funds) to access the Privileged
E-mail. Again, however, Plaintiffs are incorrect.
As an initial matter, the Tenth Circuit has never recognized the fiduciary exception
to the attorney-client privilege. See Hermann v. Rain Link, Inc., No. 11-1123-RDR, 2012
WL 1207232, at *8 (D. Kan. Apr. 11, 2012). It is unlikely that the Tenth Circuit would
11
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 20

recognize such an exception, and even more unlikely it would recognize the exception
with respect to the Privileged E-mail. Notably, the Supreme Court case to which Plaintiffs
cite, United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 178–79 (2011), did not hold
that federal common law acknowledges a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client
privilege. Instead, the Court noted that courts have differed on whether a fiduciary
exception applies and, because the parties in that case did not dispute the existence of
such an exception, the Court assumed that it existed. Id. at 170 n.3.
In any event, even assuming arguendo that a fiduciary exception to the attorneyclient privilege does exist, such an exception would not apply in this case because
Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate “good cause” required to apply the exception. See Garner
v. Wolfinbarger, 430 F.2d 1093, 1104 (5th. Cir. 1970). In their Motion to Compel, Plaintiffs
wholly ignore this requirement. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that the fiduciary exception
should apply to the Privileged E-mail because “(1) the legal advice was paid for by GreatWest Funds, not Ms. Lynne personally; (2) there was no reason Ms. Lynne could have
sought advice regarding ‘director independence’ in her personal capacity; and (3) there
is no conceivable purpose for Ms. Lynne seeking the advice other than to benefit GreatWest Funds and its shareholders.” (Pl. Motion p. 7.) Plaintiffs are wrong.
In Garner, the Fifth Circuit set forth the following factors that courts should consider
in determining whether a party seeking to apply the fiduciary exception has established
good cause: (1) the number of shareholders and the percentage of stock they represent,
(2) the bona fides of the shareholders, (3) the nature of the shareholders’ claim and
whether it is obviously colorable, (4) the apparent necessity or desirability of the

12
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 20

shareholders having the information and the availability of it from other sources, (5)
whether, if the shareholders’ claim is of wrongful action by the corporation, it is of action
criminal, or illegal but not criminal, or of doubtful legality, (6) whether the communication
related to past or to prospective actions, (7) whether the communication is of advice
concerning the litigation itself, (8) the extent to which the communication is identified
versus the extent to which the shareholders are blindly fishing, (9) the risk of revelation
of trade secrets or other information in whose confidentiality the corporation has an
interest for independent reasons. Garner, 430 F.2d at 1104.
Here, the majority of the Garner factors do not support a finding of good cause.
First, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate good cause because they collectively own less than
one percent of the outstanding shares of the relevant funds and are only nine out of
thousands of shareholders in the funds. See Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *11
(holding that plaintiffs could not demonstrate good cause where they owned less than
one percent of shares of a fund); Gerrits v. Brannen Banks of Fla., Inc., 138 F.R.D. 574,
578–79 (D. Colo. 1991) (holding that the fiduciary exception did not apply to plaintiffs who
held six percent of the defendant’s stock). Moreover, as GWCM set forth in its pending
motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs lack standing on behalf of 46 of Great-West’s funds which
they do not own. (See Dkt. 35.)
Additionally, the nature of Plaintiffs’ claim is a lawsuit brought pursuant to Section
36(b) of the ICA, which does not allow recovery against independent directors. See 15
U.S.C. § 80a-35(b)(3). As Plaintiffs are seeking to overcome the attorney-client privilege
with respect to legal advice provided to Lt. Gov. Lynne, an independent director of Great-

13
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 14 of 20

West Funds and a non-party to this lawsuit, this factor does not favor a finding of good
cause. In any event, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit does not accuse GWCM of any criminal conduct.
(See Dkt. 1.) Moreover, the Court should not find that Plaintiffs’ claim is colorable, as it
has not yet survived GWCM’s motion to dismiss. (See Dkt. 35.)
Further, there is no need for Plaintiffs to access the Privileged E-mail because, as
set forth above, the e-mail does not discuss fees paid by the Funds or the 15(c) process.
Moreover, Plaintiffs can, and in fact did, question Lt. Gov. Lynne and other witnesses
about director independence. Specifically, Plaintiffs’ counsel questioned Lt. Gov. Lynne
about her understanding of director independence during her deposition. (See Lynne
Dep. pp. 50, 53–57, Ex. E.) Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot credibly argue that they are
unable to seek information regarding director independence from other sources in
discovery.
Notably, the e-mail sought by Plaintiffs is dated February 29, 2016, more than a
month after Plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit on January 29, 2016, and provides legal
advice to Lt. Gov. Lynne relating to the date on which the e-mail was sent. In these
circumstances, where a privileged communication took place after the lawsuit was filed
and after the acts in question were committed, courts have found that good cause did not
exist. See In re LTV Sec. Litig., 89 F.R.D. 595, 607 (N.D. Tex. 1981) (declining to apply
the fiduciary exception where a shareholder class sought “after-the-fact” communications
which occurred after the past misconduct alleged by the shareholder class); Ohio-Sealy
Mattress Mfg. Co. v. Kaplan, 90 F.R.D. 21, 31–32 (N.D. Ill. 1980) (finding that the plaintiffs

14
4837-9619-8719.1

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 117 Filed 12/22/16 USDC Colorado Page 15 of 20

did not have good cause when the information sought pertained in large measure to
prospective conduct rather than past conduct).
In their Motion to Compel, Plaintiffs rely on Kenny v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLC, No.
C14-1987-RSM, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162059 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 21, 2016), in support
of their argument that the fiduciary exception applies to the Privileged E-mail. (Pl. Motion
pp. 7–8.) In Kenny, the plaintiff argued that the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which the
district court resided, had not adopted a requirement of demonstrating good cause in
order to apply the fiduciary exception. Id. at *12. District court cases in the Tenth Circuit
applying the fiduciary exception, however, have followed Garner and required a showing
of good cause. See Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *11; Gerrits, 138 F.R.D. at 578 n.3.
Moreover, the fund in Kenny was organized as a Massachusetts business trust,
whereas here, Great-West Funds is incorporated as a Maryland corporation.

See

Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *10–11 (declining to apply the fiduciary exception to the
attorney-client privilege with respect to communications between a fund organized as a
Maryland corporation and its counsel). Additionally, unlike this case, the communications
in Kenny pre-dated the filing of the plaintiffs’ complaint. See In re LTV, 89 F.R.D. at 607
(declining to apply the fiduciary exception where the communications at issue occurred
after the alleged past misconduct).
Finally, the Court should reject the Kenny decision because applying the fiduciary
exception to this case would cause a chilling effect on the ability of fund directors to freely
communicate with and seek legal advice from their counsel. As the Supreme Court has
