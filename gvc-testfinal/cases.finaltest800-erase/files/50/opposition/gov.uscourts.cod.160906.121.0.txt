Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 21

Defendant Great-West Capital Management, LLC (“GWCM”) opposes the Obeslo
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production of Document Withheld by Former Director
Donna Lynne (“Plaintiffs’ motion” or “Pls.’ Br.”). GWCM is filing this opposition to the
motion because the motion bears on issues important to GWCM and the Great-West
Funds (the “Funds”). GWCM also joins in the arguments made in Lt. Governor Lynne’s
opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiffs’ motion seeks the production of an email containing privileged legal
advice sent by Ryan Logsdon, a lawyer and counsel to the Funds, to Lt. Governor
Donna Lynne, a former independent director of Great-West Funds, Inc. The email was
sent after the Obeslo Complaint was filed and concerns the issue of director
independence. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Logsdon is not counsel to the independent
directors or the Funds and that therefore any legal advice he provided to Lt. Governor
Lynne is not protected by the attorney-client privilege. Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend
that even if the email is privileged it should be disclosed pursuant to the “fiduciary
exception” to the attorney-client privilege that has been recognized by some courts (but
not the Tenth Circuit). Plaintiffs’ attempt to circumvent the privilege should be rejected
for multiple reasons.
First, Mr. Logsdon is counsel to the Funds on whose Board Lt. Governor Lynne
was serving as a director at the time of the email. Legal advice provided by Mr.
Logsdon to directors of the Great-West Funds, Inc. Board of Directors is therefore
privileged and/or subject to the common interest doctrine.

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 21

Second, Mr. Logsdon also serves as counsel to GWCM, the adviser to the
Funds. Great-West Funds, Inc. and GWCM share a common legal interest in ensuring
Great-West Funds, Inc.’s compliance with federal securities laws and regulations.
Therefore, legal advice provided by Mr. Logsdon that is designed to ensure compliance
is protected by the common interest doctrine.
Third, Plaintiffs’ attempt to invoke the fiduciary exception to the attorney-client
privilege is unavailing. The Tenth Circuit has yet to even recognize that exception. In
addition, other than a single case from the Western District of Washington, no court has
applied the exception to require disclosure of privileged communications with directors
in a Section 36(b) case. That lone authority was wrongly decided. It is also readily
distinguishable on its facts. Finally, even if the exception were held to potentially apply
in this case, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the required good cause for piercing
the privilege.
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs are nine individuals who are purported shareholders in mutual funds
that are series within Great-West Funds, Inc., a registered investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“ICA”). GWCM serves as investment adviser to
the Funds. Plaintiffs allege derivative claims against GWCM on behalf of Great-West
Funds, Inc., contending that GWCM charges the Funds excessive fees in violation of
Section 36(b) of the ICA. 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b). Until recently, Lt. Governor Lynne
was an independent director of Great-West Funds, Inc.

2

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 21

Plaintiffs’ subpoena requested that Lt. Governor Lynne produce “[a]ll
correspondence (including email) [she] ha[s] from January 2011 to the date of
deposition regarding: Great-West Funds, Inc.; Great-West Capital Management, LLC;
Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co.; or Great-West Financial.” Pls.’ Br. at 3. Lt.
Governor Lynne has withheld from production a February 29, 2016 email from Mr.
Logsdon, which he sent to Lt. Governor Lynne after the Obeslo action was filed,
concerning “legal advice regarding director independence.” Id. Plaintiffs seek to
compel production of that email.
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he attorney-client privilege ‘protects from forced disclosure any
communication from an attorney to his client when made in the course of giving legal
advice[.]’” Wellinger Family Trust 1998 v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., No. 11-cv02568-CMA-BNB, 2013 WL 2444714, at *2 (D. Colo. June 5, 2013) (quoting Sprague v.
Thorn Ams., Inc., 129 F.3d 1355, 1370 (10th Cir. 1997)). It is “the oldest of the
privileges for confidential communications known to the common law[,]” and
“encourage[s] full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and
thereby promote[s] broader public interests in the observance of law and administration
of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). Due to the essential
role that the attorney-client privilege plays in encouraging full and frank communication,
“hard cases should be resolved in favor of the privilege, not in favor of disclosure.” See
United States v. Mett, 178 F.3d 1058, 1065 (9th Cir. 1999).

ARGUMENT
I.

THE EMAIL AT ISSUE IS A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION
A.

The Email at Issue Contains Legal Advice from Fund Counsel to a
Fund Director

Plaintiffs argue that the at-issue email is not privileged because Mr. Logsdon
supposedly “is not counsel for either the disinterested directors or Great-West Funds”
but serves only as counsel for GWCM and its parent company, Great-West Life &
Annuity Insurance Co. (“GWL&A”). Pls.’ Br. at 4. Plaintiffs are incorrect.
Mr. Logsdon indisputably serves as Vice President, Counsel & Secretary to
Great-West Funds. Ex. A, Excerpt of Great-West Funds, Inc. Statement of Additional
Information 30 (Apr. 29, 2016). As counsel to the Funds, Mr. Logsdon provides legal
advice to directors of the Funds, which is consistent with common practice in the
industry. 1
The District of Colorado has recognized that the attorney-client privilege may
attach to communications between a fund’s counsel and its directors, as a mutual fund
is an “inanimate entity” that “must [act] through its agents.” Ryskamp ex rel. Boulder
1

“Some independent directors have their own dedicated counsel, others formally retain
counsel with the fund, and still others have no dedicated counsel but instead rely on
counsel to the fund . . . .” See Overview of Fund Governance Practices, 1994-2010 at
16, Investment Company Institute [hereinafter Overview of Fund Governance
Practices], https://www.idc.org/pdf/pub_11_fund_governance.pdf. Therefore,
“independent directors may elect to . . . rely on counsel to the fund[,]” id. at 16, and “[i]n
instances where independent directors formally or informally rely on counsel to the fund,
. . . the fund counsel would constitute ‘independent legal counsel.’” Id. at 17. A recent
study showed that 35% of mutual fund boards rely on fund counsel as their own
counsel. See Practical Guidance for Mutual Fund Directors: Board Governance and
Review of Investment Advisory Agreements 9 n.23, Mutual Fund Directors Forum,
http://www.mfdf.org/images/uploads/newsroom/MFDF_Practical_Guidance_Oct2013_(

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 21

Growth & Income Fund v. Looney, No. 10-cv-00842-WJM-KLM, 2011 WL 3861437, at
*4, *5 (D. Colo. Sept. 1, 2011) (“Because ‘a corporation can only act through its officers,
directors, agents and employees, . . . communications between corporate counsel and
company personnel are privileged so long as they concern matters within the scope of
the employees’ corporate duties.’” (citation omitted)). In Ryskamp, which involved a
mutual fund organized as a Maryland corporation just as are the Funds, the court held
that an attorney-client relationship existed between parties who had a “significant
relationship to the Fund” and “clearly ha[d] [a] duty to act for the Fund.” Id. at *3, *5; see
Ex. A, Excerpt of Great-West Funds, Inc. Statement of Additional Information 1 (Apr. 29,
2016).
Here, Lt. Governor Lynne received legal advice regarding director independence
from Mr. Logsdon in his capacity as counsel to the Funds. As counsel to the Funds, Mr.
Logsdon has a duty to act for the Funds and ensure the Funds’ compliance with any
applicable federal securities laws and regulations, including those related to director
independence. Because both Lt. Governor Lynne and Mr. Logsdon have a significant
relationship to the Funds, the legal advice Mr. Logsdon provided Lt. Governor Lynne
regarding director independence is privileged.
Furthermore, even if the Court were to find that the independent directors are not
the clients of Fund counsel, the common interest doctrine protects the legal advice that
Mr. Logsdon provided to Lt. Governor Lynne in his role as Fund counsel. See
Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *7 (“Communications shared with third persons who
have a common legal interest with respect to the subject matter thereof will be deemed

5

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 21

neither a breach nor a waiver of the confidentiality surrounding the attorney-client
relationship.” (citation omitted)); Sawyer v. Southwest Airlines, Nos. Civ.A.01-2385KHV, Civ.A.01-2386-KHV, 2002 WL 31928442, at *3 (D. Kan. Dec. 23, 2002) (“The
common interest doctrine thus acts as an exception to the general waiver rule by
facilitating cooperative efforts among parties who share common interests.” (footnote
omitted)). A common legal interest exists between the independent directors and the
Funds in ensuring director independence and the Funds’ compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, as it does for most purposes. See Practical Guidance for Mutual
Fund Directors: Board Governance and Review of Investment Advisory Agreements 9,
Mutual Fund Directors Forum [hereinafter “Practical Guidance for Mutual Fund
Directors”], http://www.mfdf.org/images/uploads/newsroom/MFDF_Practical_Guidance
_Oct2013_(web).pdf (“For most purposes, the interests of the fund are aligned with
those of independent directors who oversee the fund on behalf of shareholders.”).
B.

Even if Mr. Logsdon Represented Only the Adviser, the Email at
Issue Would Still Be Privileged

Even if Plaintiffs were correct that Mr. Logsdon only serves as counsel to GWCM
and GWL&A (they are not), or even if Mr. Logsdon sent the email in his capacity as
counsel to GWCM, the legal advice that Mr. Logsdon provided to Lt. Governor Lynne
would similarly be protected from disclosure by the common interest doctrine.
The District of Colorado and other courts recognize that a common legal interest
may exist between counsel to an adviser and the directors of a fund. Ryskamp, 2011
WL 3861437, at *8 (applying common interest doctrine to communications in board
minutes “due to the common interest of all parties to formulate a common legal strategy
6

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 11 of 21

regarding regulatory compliance issues”); In re Am. Mut. Funds Fee Litig., No. CV 045593 GAF (RNBx), 2009 WL 5215755, at *55 n.14 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 28, 2009) (“Courts
have recognized that . . . once litigation under Section 36(b) is commenced . . . the
directors often have a common interest with the adviser[.]”), aff’d sub nom. Jelinek v.
Capital Research & Mgmt. Co., 448 F. App’x 716 (9th Cir. 2011).
A common legal interest clearly exists between GWCM and the Great-West
Funds, Inc. Board of Directors with regard to Great-West Funds, Inc.’s compliance with
federal securities laws and regulations. See Practical Guidance for Mutual Fund
Directors 6 (“In most circumstances the board and management have aligned interests
in serving shareholders . . . .”). The ICA expressly requires that a registered investment
company, such as Great-West Funds, Inc., be overseen by a board of directors, 40% of
whom must be independent. See 15 U.S.C. § 80a-10(a). GWCM and the Great-West
Funds, Inc. Board of Directors share a common interest in ensuring that the directors
who are designated as independent are, in fact, independent. Obviously, if Great-West
Funds, Inc. faced legal consequences for failing to ensure that at least 40% of its
directors are independent, both Great-West Funds, Inc. and GWCM would be
detrimentally affected, heightening the need for an independent director to be able to
engage in full and frank conversations with counsel to the adviser. 2

2

The SEC recognizes that there are circumstances in which counsel to the adviser may
be deemed to be representing the investment company (i.e., the Funds) before the
SEC, such as where the adviser’s counsel “prepares, or assists in preparing, materials”
to be submitted to or filed with the SEC. Implementation of Standards of Professional
Conduct for Attorneys, Exchange Act Release No. 8185, 79 S.E.C. Docket 1351, 2003
WL 193527 (Jan. 29, 2003).

II.

THE FIDUCIARY EXCEPTION TO THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE IS
INAPPLICABLE
Plaintiffs further claim that, even if Mr. Logsdon’s email is privileged, its

production should be compelled under the so-called fiduciary exception to the privilege.
See Pls.’ Br. at 6. The Tenth Circuit has neither adopted the fiduciary exception nor
addressed its scope. See Herrmann v. Rain Link, Inc., No. 11-1123-RDR, 2012 WL
1207232, at *8 (D. Kan. Apr. 11, 2012).
Some courts outside the Tenth Circuit have held that the attorney-client privilege
can be overcome when the party asserting the privilege owes fiduciary duties to the
party seeking disclosure. See, e.g., Garner v. Wolfinbarger, 430 F.2d 1093, 1103-04
(5th Cir. 1970). In their Reply in Support of Second Motion to Compel filed against
GWCM, Plaintiffs argued that Garner “applies to shareholder derivative actions by
plaintiff-shareholders against their corporation’s officers and directors[.]” Pls.’ Reply in
Supp. of Second Mot. to Compel Produc. of Docs. at 8, Sept. 6, 2016, ECF 79. Garner
requires the party seeking to take advantage of the fiduciary exception to make a
showing of “good cause” in order to pierce the privilege. Garner, 430 F.2d at 1103-04
(requiring stockholders “to show cause why” the attorney-client privilege should be
waived); see also In re Teleglobe Commc’ns Corp., 493 F.3d 345, 384 (3d Cir. 2007)
(“Debtors should be able to put aside the privilege upon showing good cause.”); Ward v.
Succession of Freeman, 854 F.2d 780, 787 (5th Cir. 1988) (privileged communications
did not need to be disclosed because “plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate good
cause”); Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *11 (“Thus, shareholders are given access to
otherwise privileged information upon a showing of good cause.” (citing Gerrits v.
8

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 21

Brannen Banks of Fla., Inc., 138 F.R.D. 574, 577-78 (D. Colo. 1991))). Plaintiffs bear
the burden of establishing that the exception applies. See, e.g., In re Teleglobe
Commc’ns Corp., 493 F.3d at 384; Garner, 430 F.2d at 1103-04.
A.

The Fiduciary Exception Does Not Apply to Attorney-Client
Communications with Directors of Mutual Fund Boards

Where Courts have required the disclosure of otherwise privileged information
under the fiduciary exception, they have done so almost exclusively in contexts outside
of Section 36(b)—for example, in corporate derivative and ERISA fiduciary lawsuits.
See Solis v. Food Emp’rs Labor Relations Ass’n, 644 F.3d 221, 227 (4th Cir. 2011)
(discussing contexts in which the fiduciary exception has been applied). Requiring
disclosure of privileged communications to Section 36(b) plaintiffs under this exception
would make new law in this District and would have a chilling effect on the efforts of
fund counsel and advisers to thoroughly apprise mutual fund boards about legal issues.
See, e.g., Wachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir. 2007) (“Full and frank
communication between attorneys and their clients must be encouraged because the
administration of justice in a complex society depends upon the availability of sound
legal advice, and in turn, the soundness of legal advice depends upon clients’
willingness to present full disclosures to their attorneys.” (citation omitted)).
As the Ninth Circuit noted in United States v. Mett, in the ERISA context:
[F]rom a policy perspective, an uncertain attorney-client privilege will likely result
in ERISA trustees shying away from legal advice regarding the performance of
their duties. This outcome ultimately hurts beneficiaries—all else being equal,
beneficiaries should prefer well-counseled trustees who clearly understand their
duties. In addition, a trustee’s fear that her lawyer will be used against her may
well translate into either an unwillingness to serve at all, or an insistence on

9

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 14 of 21

contractual protections aimed at diluting the trustee’s accountability. Neither
option services the interest of beneficiaries.
Mett, 178 F.3d 1065. That rationale applies even more so in the context of a mutual
fund board of directors, where the success of the fund series depends on the actions of
qualified and fully informed independent directors. Without sound, confidential legal
advice, independent directors would be hindered in their ability to act as the
“watchdogs” the ICA requires them to be.
B.

The Recent Kenny Decision Is An Outlier, and is Distinguishable

In November 2016, the Western District of Washington decided in Kenny v.
Pacific Investment Management Co., a Section 36(b) action, that the fiduciary exception
applied to communications regarding “legal advice for managing the fund” that were
“not personal advice to the Trustees” and were “not made in anticipation of [the present]
or any other litigation.” Kenny v. Pacific Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLC, No. C14-1987-RSM, 2016
WL 6836886, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 21, 2016). Kenny is the only decision to apply the
fiduciary exception to privileged communications involving mutual fund trustees in
Section 36(b) litigation, and, in light of Point II.A above, GWCM respectfully submits that
Kenny was wrongly decided. 3
In addition, Kenny is distinguishable from this case on multiple grounds. First,
the court in Kenny held that its facts were “sufficiently analogous” to situations where
other courts have applied the fiduciary exception—situations that typically involved
3

Kenny relied heavily on two cases, United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation and United
States v. Mett. See Kenny, 2016 WL 6836886, at *2-4. However, both of those cases
held that the fiduciary exception did not apply under the facts presented. See United
States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 165-66 (2011); Mett, 178 F.3d at 1066.
10

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 15 of 21

trusts. Id. at *4. 4 Indeed, the court emphasized in its decision that “[t]he PIMCO Total
Return Fund [was] indisputably set up as a trust.” Id. at *4. But here, the Great-West
Funds are indisputably not set up as trusts; rather, Great West Funds, Inc. is a
Maryland corporation. Ex. A, Excerpt of Great-West Funds, Inc. Statement of Additional
Information 1 (Apr. 29, 2016). And the members of the Board of the Funds are
indisputably not trustees; rather, they are directors. See id. at 30.
Second, the communications at issue in Kenny bear little to no resemblance to
the email at issue in this case. In Kenny, the court noted that “[t]he communications at
issue include[d] legal advice for managing the fund,” Kenny, 2016 WL 6836886, at *4,
and the Kenny plaintiff’s motion to compel noted that the vast majority of the withheld
communications at issue pre-dated the filing of the complaint in that case. Pl.’s Mot. to
Compel PIMCO Trustees to Produc. Docs. at 11, Kenny v. Pacific Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLC,
2016 WL 6836886 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 21, 2016) (No. C14-1987-RSM), ECF 100. Here,
by contrast, the at-issue email does not concern the management of the Funds, but
rather instead concerns Lt. Governor Lynne’s independence. Mr. Logsdon sent this
email about director independence to Lt. Governor Lynne on February 29, 2016—well
after the Obeslo Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on January 29, 2016.
In United States v. Mett, which both Kenny and Plaintiffs here cite, the Ninth
Circuit explained that there is a “spectrum” of privileged communications and that the

4

“English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as a principle of trust law in the
19th century.” Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. at 170. Modern courts have applied
the exception “in the context of common-law trusts[.]” Id. at 167.

potential applicability of the fiduciary exception turns on where along that spectrum a
privileged communication falls:
On the one hand, where an ERISA trustee seeks an attorney’s advice on a
matter of plan administration and where the advice clearly does not implicate the
trustee in any personal capacity, the trustee cannot invoke the attorney-client
privilege against the plan beneficiaries. On the other hand, where a plan
fiduciary retains counsel in order to defend herself against the plan beneficiaries
(or the government acting in their stead), the attorney-client privilege remains
intact.
Mett, 178 F.3d at 1064. Plaintiffs’ motion ignores Mett in this regard and incorrectly
suggests that the fiduciary exception applies to any communication not squarely at the
far pole of the “defend herself” end of this spectrum. Pls.’ Br. at 6-7. An attorney-client
communication with a director that relates to director independence, which was sent to
a director after the filing of a Section 36(b) complaint alleging the director is not
independent, falls much farther along the “defend” end of the spectrum than the
“administration” end of the spectrum. Mett, 178 F.3d at 1064 (“The advice is certainly a
far cry from advice regarding whether a trust may advance to a beneficiary from the
trust . . . or whether a trust should take certain positions in tax litigation with a state
department of revenue.” (citation omitted)). The communication is therefore not subject
to the exception. 5 And to the extent there is any doubt as to the right conclusion here,
Mett is clear that “hard cases should be resolved in favor of the privilege, not in favor of
disclosure.” Mett, 178 F.3d at 1065.

This is consistent with the fact that “‘fiduciaries do not have a duty to keep
beneficiaries informed of all matters.’” Galena St. Fund, L.P. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
No. 12-cv-00587-BNB-KMT, 2014 WL 943115, at *3 (D. Colo. Mar. 10, 2014) (quoting
Herrmann, 2012 WL 1207232, at *7).

Third, courts have suggested that the argument for applying the fiduciary
exception is stronger where the legal advice at issue is paid for with fund assets. See,
e.g., United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 172, 178-79 (2011); Galena
St. Fund, L.P. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 12-cv-00587-BNB-KMT, 2014 WL
943115, at *4 (D. Colo. Mar. 10, 2014). The court in Kenny noted that “Plaintiff argues
that the legal counsel at issue was paid for by the Trust rather than Defendants.” See
Kenny, 2016 WL 6836886, at *2. Mr. Logsdon, by contrast, is compensated by GWL&A
and/or GWCM, not the Funds. See Ex. B, Excerpt of GWCM: Great-West Funds, Inc.
15(c) Review 10, 15 (Apr. 15, 2016) (noting GWL&A provides compensation to GWCM
personnel); Ex. C, Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement 7 (May 1,
2015) (providing that for all Funds subject to the unitary management fee, GWCM “shall
be responsible for all expenses incurred in performing the services set forth in this
Agreement and all other expenses”).

Plaintiffs Fail to Show “Good Cause” to Defeat Privilege

Even if Plaintiffs were correct that (i) the fiduciary exception should be adopted
by the Tenth Circuit, and that (ii) the exception can apply to privileged communications
between fund counsel and a mutual fund director, and that (iii) the exception potentially
applies to the email between Mr. Logsdon and Lt. Governor Lynne, Plaintiffs still must
show good cause for applying the exception and piercing the privilege based on the
factors set out in Garner. 6 As noted, Plaintiffs represented to this Court in one of their

6

Garner sets forth the following non-exclusive factors for determining good cause: (1)
the number of shareholders and the percentage of stock they represent; (2) the bona
fides of the shareholders; (3) the nature of the shareholders’ claim and whether it is
13

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 121 Filed 12/23/16 USDC Colorado Page 18 of 21

prior motions to compel that Garner is the supposedly applicable authority with regard to
the fiduciary exception. Pls.’ Reply in Supp. of Second Mot. to Compel Produc. of Docs.
at 8, Sept. 6, 2016, ECF 79.
Plaintiffs cannot show good cause under Garner. Plaintiffs are just nine out of
many thousands of shareholders of the Funds and hold a tiny fraction of one percent of
the assets of the Funds in which they allegedly own shares. This fact alone is fatal.
See Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *11 (plaintiff’s ownership of less than one percent
of shares of fund was “dispositive” factor in Garner analysis finding fiduciary exception
inapplicable); see also Gerrits, 138 F.R.D. at 578-79 (declining to apply exception where
plaintiffs held 6 percent of defendant’s stock, representing 25 percent of all minority
shareholders’ ownership); Ward, 854 F.2d at 786 (plaintiffs failed to demonstrate good
cause under Garner where they “cumulatively owned less than four (4%) of the stock”).
In addition, Plaintiffs’ complaint has not even survived a motion to dismiss, and
whether Plaintiffs’ claims are “obviously colorable” therefore remains unestablished.
See Ryskamp, 2011 WL 3861437, at *11 (no good cause to apply fiduciary exception
where “Plaintiff is a minority stockholder still attempting to get beyond the motion to
dismiss stage of litigation”); In re Omnicom Grp. Inc. Sec. Litig., 233 F.R.D. 400, 412-13
obviously colorable; (4) the apparent necessity or desirability of the shareholders having
the information and the availability of it from other sources; (5) whether, if the
shareholders’ claim is of wrongful action by the corporation, it is of action criminal, or
illegal but not criminal, or of doubtful legality; (6) whether the communication is related
to past or to prospective actions; (7) whether the communication is of advice concerning
the litigation itself; (8) the extent to which the communication is identified versus the
extent to which the shareholders are blindly fishing; and (9) the risk of revelation of
trade secrets or other information in whose confidentiality the corporation has an
interest for independent reasons. Garner, 430 F.2d at 1104.

(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (even the denial of motion to dismiss means only that plaintiffs’ claims
were “simply colorable,” rather than “clearly colorable”; good cause not shown).
Moreover, no plaintiff has ever prevailed in a Section 36(b) case that has gone to trial.
Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a legitimate need for the email,
which has little to no bearing on the fees charged to the Funds. GWCM has already
produced more than 70,000 pages of Board materials and minutes. Plaintiffs have been
given more than enough information to evaluate the issue of director independence.
See Fitzpatrick v. American Int’l Grp., Inc., 272 F.R.D. 100, 111 & n.8, 112 (S.D.N.Y.
2010) (no good cause where, among other things, plaintiffs “completely fail[ed] to
identify why they need[ed] the substance of specific privileged communications”).
Further, there is no criminal conduct at issue in this case. See In re Omnicom
Grp. Inc. Sec. Litig., 233 F.R.D. at 412 (plaintiffs did not show good cause where
“wrongful conduct alleged, although potentially unlawful, is plainly not criminal”).
As noted, the burden here is Plaintiffs’. Having failed to meet that burden, the
fiduciary exception does not apply.
CONCLUSION
GWCM respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion.
