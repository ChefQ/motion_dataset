PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENT
WITHHELD BY FORMER DIRECTOR DONNA LYNNE

Plaintiffs in Obeslo et al. v. Great-West Capital Management, LLC (D.Colo. 16-230)
respectfully move the Court to compel non-party Donna Lynne to produce an email
responsive to a subpoena served on her that she is withholding under a claim of
attorney-client privilege. She received the email at issue not from her own lawyer, but
rather from counsel for Defendant. The claim of privilege is without merit, and the email
should be produced immediately.

Plaintiffs and counsel for Ms. Lynne conferred on November 29 and 30, 2016, but
were not able to resolve the dispute.
Background
This is an action under §36(b) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. §80a35(b))(“the “Act”). Plaintiffs are shareholders of Great-West Funds, Inc., a registered
investment company, commonly known as a mutual fund. Ms. Lynne is a former
disinterested director1 of Great-West Funds. Defendant is the registered investment
adviser of Great-West Funds and thus has a statutory fiduciary duty “with respect to the
receipt of compensation for services” it receives from Great-West Funds for providing
advisory services. 15 U.S.C. §80a-35(b). Plaintiffs contend that Defendant breached
this fiduciary duty by taking excessive compensation.
Defendant may not “charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no
reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of
arm's-length bargaining.” Jones v. Harris Assoc. L.P., 559 U.S. 335, 346 (2010).
Because of the close, intertwined relationship between a mutual fund and its investment
advisor, “the forces of arm’s-length bargaining do not work in the mutual fund industry in
the same manner as they do in other sectors of the American economy.” Burks v.
Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 481 (1979). “Recognizing that the relationship between a fund
and its investment adviser was ‘fraught with potential conflicts of interest,’ the Act

1

The Act requires that at least 40 percent of a mutual fund company’s board of
directors comprise individuals who have no interest in or affiliation with the advisor. 15
U.S.C. §§ 80a-2(a)(19), 80a-10(a). The term “disinterested director” as used herein
refers to a director who is not defined as “interested” under the Act.
2

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 106 Filed 12/02/16 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 9

created protections for mutual fund shareholders.” Jones, 559 U.S. at 338 (quoting Daily
Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U.S. 523, 536 (1984)). “[S]crutiny of investment-adviser
compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the ‘cornerstone of the … effort
to control conflicts of interest within mutual funds.’” Jones, 559 U.S. at 348 (quoting
Burks, 441 U.S. at 482). As such, “[t]he Act interposes disinterested directors as
‘independent watchdogs’ of the relationship between a mutual fund and its adviser.” Id.
(quoting Burks, 441 U.S. at 484). Disinterested directors have a duty to ensure that
mutual funds “operate in the interest of all classes of their securities holders, rather than
for the benefit of investment advisers, directors, or other special groups.” Tannenbaum
v. Zeller, 552 F.2d 402, 406 (2d Cir. 1977).
Plaintiffs served a subpoena duces tecum on Ms. Lynne as a former director of
Great-West Funds. The subpoena asked her to produce:
All correspondence (including email) you have from January 2011 to the
date of deposition regarding: Great-West Funds, Inc.; Great-West Capital
Management, LLC; Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co.; or GreatWest Financial.
Ms. Lynne provided a privilege log containing an entry for a February 29, 2016 email
from Ryan Logsdon. Ex. 1, item 7. Ms. Lynne claimed this email provided “legal advice
regarding director independence.” In correspondence, Ms. Lynne’s attorney claimed
that Ryan Logsdon was “fund counsel.” Ex. 2. Plaintiffs asked for clarification as to
“what you mean when you refer to Mr. Logsdon as ‘Fund Counsel.’ Specifically, please
clarify what ‘fund’ you are referring to, and the nature of the supposed attorney-client
relationship between Mr. Logsdon and the independent directors.” Ex. 3. That attorney
did not respond to these questions.
3

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 106 Filed 12/02/16 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 9

Ryan Logsdon is not counsel for either the disinterested directors or Great-West
Funds. Counsel for the disinterested directors is Vedder Price. See Ex. 2. Ryan
Logsdon instead is “Associate General Counsel, Products & Corporate” of Great-West
Life & Annuity Insurance Company, the parent company of Defendant Great-West
Capital Management LLC. Doc. 74-4 at 4, ¶3 (Defendant’s Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures). In
that capacity, he also has served as “in-house attorney[]” at Defendant Great-West
Capital Management, LLC. Doc. 94 at 7 (Mem. 3 n.1). Plaintiffs pointed this out to Ms.
Ms. Lynne’s counsel, along with Defendant’s counsel, in a November 15, 2016 email.
Plaintiffs conferred with Ms. Lynne’s counsel, along with Defendant and Plaintiff in
the Duplass matter (D.Colo. 16-1215), on November 29, 2016. Ms. Lynne’s counsel
informed Plaintiffs that Mr. Logsdon’s February 29, 2016 email to Ms. Lynne contained
purported legal advice regarding Ms. Lynne’s obligations as a director of Great-West
Funds as they relate to certain of Ms. Lynne’s “outside business” interests. The
following day, Ms. Lynne’s counsel reiterated her position that the email was privileged
and that she would not produce it. Ex. 4.
Argument
In a federal question case, federal common law governs a claim of privilege. Fed.R.
Evid. 501. The “party seeking to assert the attorney-client privilege has the burden of
proving the applicability of the privilege.” In re Diasonics Sec. Litig., 110 F.R.D. 570, 573
(D. Colo. 1986)(Abram, J., citing Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. West, 748 F.2d 540,
542 (10th Cir. 1984)). “The party must show that the privilege clearly applies to the
documents in dispute by specifically setting forth the objections. General allegations are

4

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 106 Filed 12/02/16 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 9

insufficient to meet this burden of proof.” Id. (citing Peat, Marwick, 748 F.2d at 542). The
privilege “must be narrowly construed.” Id. at 572 (citing In re Grand Jury Subpoena
Duces Tecum, Dorokee Co., 697 F.2d 277, 278 (10th Cir. 1983)).
The attorney-client privilege only protects communications between an attorney and
her client. Sprague v. Thorn Ams., Inc., 129 F.3d 1355, 1370 (10th Cir. 1997). The
email at issue here is not such a communication. Ryan Logsdon is not the attorney for
Great-West Funds, Inc. or its directors. He is the attorney for Defendant Great-West
Capital Management, LLC and its parent company, Great-West Life & Annuity
Insurance Company. Ms. Lynne was supposed to be an “independent watchdog[]”
(Jones, 559 U.S. at 348) ensuring that Defendant did not take excessive fees from
Great-West Funds and its shareholders. Ms. Lynne identified attorneys at Vedder Price
as her counsel and Mr. Logsdon as counsel for Defendant. Ex. 5 at 18:21–19:18.
Indeed, at her deposition, Ms. Lynne was represented by Vedder Price, not Mr.
Logsdon. Id. at 2. And Mr. Logsdon’s email signature block identifies him as an
employee of and lawyer for Defendant—not as counsel to Great-West Funds, Inc. or its
directors. Ex. 6.
Since the directors of Great-West Funds Inc. owe a duty to the shareholders of
Great-West Funds, Inc. (such as the Plaintiffs) to negotiate Defendant’s compensation
at arm’s-length and limit it to a reasonable amount (Jones, 559 U.S. at 348), Ryan
Logsdon could not represent both Defendant and the directors without a conflict of
interest. Colo. RPC 1.7(a); D.C.Colo.LAttyR 2(a). Because Ryan Logsdon in fact is not
and could not be the attorney for these directors, no attorney-client privilege can apply

5

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 106 Filed 12/02/16 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 9

to the email. Indeed, it would be completely inappropriate for Mr. Logsdon, attorney for
Defendant, to be providing Ms. Lynne with “legal advice regarding director
independence.” Ex. 1 at line 7. Ms. Lynne is essentially claiming to have been advised
about her independence as a Great-West Funds director by the very entity from which
she is supposed to be independent. This goes against the Act’s insistence that
disinterested directors “operate in the interest of all classes of their securities holders,
rather than for the benefit of investment advisers, directors, or other special groups,”
Tannenbaum, 552 F.2d at 406, and defies all logic and common sense.
And even if Mr. Logsdon’s email were somehow deemed an attorney-client
communication with Ms. Lynne (again, it is not), Ms. Lynne still would not be allowed to
withhold it from Plaintiffs in this case. When a fiduciary seeks or receives legal advice in
their capacity as a fiduciary, the beneficiary of the fiduciary relationship is, in effect, the
“client” for whom the advice was obtained.2 Therefore, legal advice provided to a
fiduciary cannot be withheld when its production is sought by the beneficiary. United
States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 178–79 (2011); United States v. Mett,
178 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Evans, 796 F.2d 264, 265–66 (9th
Cir. 1986). As the Supreme Court has explained, “courts identify the ‘real client’ based
on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus, whether the trustee had reason
to seek advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice

2

Plaintiffs previously explained why the fiduciary exception bars Defendant from withholding
documents purportedly containing legal advice given to directors where the advice was
procured in the director’s capacity as a fiduciary. See Plaintiffs’ Second Motion to Compel [Doc.
74] at 10–12 (Mem. 6–8).

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 106 Filed 12/02/16 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 9

could have been intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust.” Jicarilla, 564
U.S. at 178–79. Here, any advice Ms. Lynne may have received in her capacity as a
fiduciary to Great-West Funds is subject to the fiduciary exception because (1) the legal
advice was paid for by Great-West Funds, not Ms. Lynne personally; (2) there was no
reason Ms. Lynne could have sought advice regarding “director independence” in her
personal capacity; and (3) there is no conceivable purpose for Ms. Lynne seeking the
advice other than to benefit Great-West Funds and its shareholders.3
The District Court for the Western District of Washington recently examined this
exact issue and provides persuasive reasoning that supports Plaintiffs’ position. Kenny
v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co., No. 14-1987, 2016 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 162059 at *2–4 (W.D.Wash.
Nov. 21, 2016) (filed as Ex. 7). The plaintiff mutual fund shareholder sought to compel
the fund company’s trustees to disclose documents over which they had claimed the
attorney-client privilege. 2016 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 162059, at *2–4. As here, the plaintiff
argued that the fiduciary exception barred the independent trustees from asserting the
attorney-client privilege against fund shareholders. Id. at *6. Although recognizing that
the fiduciary exception had never before been applied in a §36(b) case, id. at *8–9, the
court held that: “[t]he Independent Trustees clearly owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff and
other shareholders;” “[t]he communications at issue include legal advice for managing

3

Fiduciary legal advice may be privileged “where the fiduciary seeks legal advice for
its own protection against claims by the beneficiary.” Galena St. Fund, L.P. v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 12-587-BNB-KMT, 2014 WL 943115, at *3 (D.Colo. Mar. 10,
2014). Here, the email from Mr. Logsdon to Ms. Lynne in no way related to her personal
liability. It is supposedly about “director independence,” not this lawsuit or any other
pending or threatened lawsuit against Ms. Lynne or any of the other directors.
7

Case 1:16-cv-00230-CMA-MJW Document 106 Filed 12/02/16 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 9

the fund, not personal advice to the Trustees[;] and the communications were not made
in anticipation of this or any other litigation,” id. at *14. Consequently, the court ordered
production of the communications.
The reasoning of Kenny applies equally here. Although the investment company in
Kenny was established as a trust, that is not a meaningful distinction. Investment
companies commonly are established either as trusts or corporations. SEC Guide to
Mutual Funds at 26 (hyperlinked); 15 U.S.C. §80a-2(a)(8) (investment “company”
includes “corporation” and “trust”). The fiduciary duty of a corporate director to
shareholders is similar to that of a trustee to the trust beneficiary. See ATR-Kim Capital
Partners, Inc. v. Bonilla, No. 07-30309, 2007 Bankr.LEXIS 3566, at *5 (Bankr.N.D.Cal.
Oct. 16, 2007)(“The major authorities on trust law are in accord that corporate directors
occupy a trust-like position ….”)(citing Bogert & Bogert, Law of Trusts & Trustees §16
(2007) and Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§2, 5(g) (2003)) (filed as Ex. 8). The
“beneficiaries” of the trust are the owners of the shares of the mutual fund. In each
instance, the advice the fiduciary receives (whether as trustee or corporate director) is
for the purpose of discharging her duties to the trust beneficiaries or corporate
shareholders. Here, the purported advice Ms. Lynne received related to how she could
discharge her fiduciary duties to the Great-West Funds shareholders. The email from
Mr. Logsdon therefore should not be withheld from those same shareholders now.

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that their motion to compel
