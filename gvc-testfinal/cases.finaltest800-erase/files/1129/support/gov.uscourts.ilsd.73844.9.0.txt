CIVIL ACTION NO.

[Removed from the Circuit
Court for the 20th Judicial Circuit,
St. Clair County, Illinois, Civil
Action No. 2016-L-362]

DEFENDANT FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY LLC’S
MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION
AND FOR STAY PENDING ARBITRATION
AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
This purported class action arises from Plaintiff Jeffrey Burcham’s purchase
of a vehicle from an Illinois car dealership. In the retail installment contract for the
purchase of the vehicle, Mr. Burcham agreed to have decided by arbitration “any
claim, dispute, or controversy . . . related to this contract.” The dealership assigned
its rights under the retail installment contract to Defendant Ford Motor Credit
Company LLC (“Ford Credit”).
In July 2016, Mr. Burcham filed a complaint against Ford Credit, asserting
claims for alleged violations of Illinois law in connection with Ford Credit’s
release of a security interest in the vehicle. Because the claims raised in Mr.
Burcham’s complaint fall squarely within the scope of the arbitration provision,

Case 3:16-cv-00943-DRH-SCW Document 9 Filed 08/25/16 Page 2 of 7 Page ID #55

Mr. Burcham should be compelled to arbitrate his claims, and this action should be
stayed pending arbitration.
I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On March 6, 2009, Mr. Burcham executed a retail installment contract for
the purchase of a used 2006 Ford Fusion from Roberts Motors Inc. of Alton,
Illinois. (Compl. ¶ 7 & Ex. A [ECF No. 1-2, at 18, 25]; see also Declaration of
Todd Kolchinsky, attached hereto as Exhibit 1, at Ex. A (including both sides of
Mr. Burcham’s contract).) The contract contains an arbitration provision, which
provides in relevant part:
Arbitration is a method of resolving any claim, dispute,
or controversy (collectively, a “Claim”) without filing a
lawsuit in court. Either you or Creditor (“us” or “we”)
(each, a “Party”) may choose at any time, including after
a lawsuit is filed, to have any Claim related to this
contract decided by arbitration. Such Claims include but
are not limited to the following: 1) Claims in contract,
tort, regulatory or otherwise; 2) Claims regarding the
interpretation, scope, or validity of this clause, or
arbitrability of any issue; 3) Claims between you and us,
your/our employees, agents, successors, assigns,
subsidiaries, or affiliates; 4) Claims arising out of or
relating to your application for credit, this contract, or
any resulting transaction or relationship, including that
with the dealer, or any such relationship with third parties
who do not sign this contract.
(Id.; the complete arbitration provision is reproduced in Exhibit “2” hereto.) The
arbitration provision is set forth in a separate box within the retail installment
contract, under the heading:

READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY
ARBITRATION

(Id.)
Roberts Motors Inc. assigned its rights under the retail installment contract
to Ford Credit. (Compl. ¶ 8 [ECF No. 1-2, at 19].) On July 13, 2016, despite
having agreed to arbitrate all claims related to his purchase of the Ford Fusion, Mr.
Burcham filed this putative class action against Ford Credit challenging Ford
Credit’s failure to release its security interest in the vehicle. His complaint
includes a claim for violation of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code.
II.

ARGUMENT

The Federal Arbitration Act requires a court to stay any proceeding brought
“upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such
arbitration.” E.g., Kroog v. Mait, 712 F.2d 1148, 1149 (7th Cir. 1983) (quoting
9 U.S.C. § 3).
In deciding whether a party agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute, a court
applies state-law principles of contract formation “with a healthy regard for the
federal policy favoring arbitration.” Cont’l Cas. Co. v. Am. Nat’l Ins. Co., 417
F.3d 727, 730–31 (7th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted); see also James v. McDonald’s
Corp., 417 F.3d 672, 676–77 (7th Cir. 2005) (“The FAA embodies a ‘liberal
federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.’”) (citation omitted).

Case 3:16-cv-00943-DRH-SCW Document 9 Filed 08/25/16 Page 4 of 7 Page ID #57

In order “[t]o compel arbitration, a party need only show: (1) an agreement
to arbitrate, (2) a dispute within the scope of the arbitration agreement, and (3) a
refusal by the opposing party to proceed to arbitration.” Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v.
Watts Indus., Inc., 466 F.3d 577, 580 (7th Cir. 2006). Each requirement is met
here.
(1) There is a written arbitration agreement included as part of the retail
installment contract entered into by Mr. Burcham. (Kolchinsky Decl., Ex. A.)
(2) Mr. Burcham’s claims for alleged violations of the Illinois Motor
Vehicle Code fall within the scope of that written arbitration agreement. The
arbitration agreement covers “any claim, dispute, or controversy . . . related to” Mr.
Burcham’s contract to purchase the Ford Fusion and any “[c]laims arising out of or
relating to [Mr. Burcham’s] application for credit, this contract, or any resulting
transaction or relationship, including that with the dealer, or any such relationship
with third parties who do not sign this contract.” (Id.) (emphasis added).
Mr. Burcham’s claim relates to Ford Credit’s security interest in the vehicle, which
was created by the assignment of the installment contract to Ford Credit and,
therefore, arose out of transactions or relationships resulting from the retail
installment agreement. See Kiefer Specialty Flooring, Inc. v. Tarkett, Inc., 174
F.3d 907, 909–10 (7th Cir. 1999) (characterizing arbitration provision governing
all controversies “arising out or relating to” the agreements between the parties as
4

Case 3:16-cv-00943-DRH-SCW Document 9 Filed 08/25/16 Page 5 of 7 Page ID #58

“extremely broad and capable of an expansive reach,” such that they “necessarily
create a presumption of arbitrability”); see also Sweet Dreams Unlimited, Inc. v.
Dial-A-Mattress Int’l, 1 F.3d 639, 642 (7th Cir. 1993) (holding “that ‘arising out
of’ [the agreement] reaches all disputes having their origin or genesis in the
contract, whether or not they implicate interpretation or performance of the
contract per se”); Johnson v. Orkin, LLC, 928 F. Supp. 2d 989, 1002 (N.D. Ill.
2013) (“In resolving a motion to compel arbitration, the court should vigilantly
bear in mind the Supreme Court’s instruction that as a matter of federal law, any
doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of
arbitration.”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), aff’d, 556 F. App’x
543 (7th Cir. 2014).
(3) Finally, Mr. Burcham has refused to arbitrate his dispute with Ford
Credit, as shown by his having filed the complaint against Ford Credit in this
action and in a prior action that he voluntarily dismissed. (Plaintiff’s Notice of
Voluntary Dismissal, Burcham v. Ford Motor Credit Company LLC,
No. 3:15-cv-00509-DRH-DGW (S.D. Ill. July 14, 2015) (ECF No. 22).)
III.

CONCLUSION

The claims asserted in Mr. Burcham’s complaint against Ford Credit fall
squarely within his written agreement to arbitrate. Accordingly, and for the

5

Case 3:16-cv-00943-DRH-SCW Document 9 Filed 08/25/16 Page 6 of 7 Page ID #59

reasons discussed above, Ford Credit’s motion to compel arbitration should be
granted and this action should be stayed pending arbitration.
