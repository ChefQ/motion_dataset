MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

I.

3

AB seeks leave to amend its complaint to add two sets of allegations: a damages claim

INTRODUCTION

4

against Stephen Macevicz and additional grounds supporting its claim that the patents-in-suit

5

should be declared unenforceable by Illumina due to inequitable conduct. These allegations

6

could not have been added before the October 25, 2007 date for amended pleadings set in the

7

Court’s scheduling order. (Docket No. 32, at 1.) Defendants, however, have refused to stipulate

8

to AB’s amendments based solely on the passing of that deadline. Therefore, AB also seeks a

9

modification of the scheduling order to permit AB to obtain leave to amend its complaint.

10

Neither of AB’s amendments would have been possible on October 25, 2007. At that

11

time, AB’s damages claim against Macevicz was unavailable because a Release of monetary

12

damages against Macevicz was still in effect. It was not until two months later that Macevicz

13

breached the terms of the Release by relying on it in an attempt to get dismissed from the case,

14

and AB learned that he had breached the terms of the Release by failing to be truthful in his

15

communications with AB. AB terminated the Release in December 2007. Likewise, because

16

allegations of inequitable conduct require pleading with particularity, AB could not have pleaded

17

the additional grounds for its inequitable conduct claim until after it had developed the underlying

18

facts.

19

Defendants will not be prejudiced by the filing of AB’s amendments. The addition of the

20

damages claim against Macevicz is the result of his own conduct after the previous deadline for

21

amending the pleadings. It does not change the other substantive claims against him, and does

22

not affect any discovery that has taken place to date. Additionally, Macevicz claims he is being

23

indemnified by Illumina, Inc. and Solexa, Inc. (collectively, “Illumina”) in this litigation, and

24

damages claims against Illumina have been part of this case since it was first filed. Similarly, the

25

additional grounds supporting AB’s inequitable conduct claim do not prejudice Illumina. They

26

are based on facts that Illumina already knew, and they simply provide additional bases for an

27

inequitable conduct claim that is already contained in AB’s complaint.

Based on these reasons, there is good cause for allowing AB to file these amendments to

2

its complaint. Therefore, AB respectfully requests that the Court grant leave for AB to file its

3

Second Amended Complaint1 and modify the scheduling order accordingly.

II.

5

Before this suit was filed, the parties to this action engaged in informal settlement talks.

6

The parties executed a partial Release to facilitate these discussions. (Docket No. 72-2.) Under

7

this Release, Macevicz agreed to speak truthfully to AB and Illumina about the Patents.2 (Id. at

8

1.) AB and Illumina agreed that they would not seek monetary damages from Macevicz “based

9

on any claims arising out of or related to the application for or prosecution of the Patents.” (Id. ¶

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

10

1.) AB and Illumina retained all rights to seek equitable relief for any claim they may have

11

against Macevicz. (Id.)

12

The parties further agreed that they would not use the Release “or the fact of its existence

13

to argue that it affects the Companies’ respective rights in any way other than any right they may

14

have had to recover monetary damages from Dr. Macevicz,” and that the Release would be

15

confidential except as might become necessary to enforce the Release. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 3.) Finally, the

16

parties agreed that the Release could be terminated if Macevicz was willfully untruthful in his

17

meetings with AB and Illumina. (Id. ¶ 4.)

18

AB terminated the Release on December 17, 2007, shortly before filing its opposition to

19

Macevicz’s motion to dismiss on December 20, 2007. (Docket No. 72-7; Docket No. 71.)

20

During the discussions required by the Release, Macevicz failed to disclose that he had signed an

21

Indemnity Agreement with Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lynx”), pursuant to which Illumina is

22

apparently indemnifying Macevicz for legal fees and liabilities in connection with this litigation.

23

(Docket No. 72-3; Docket No. 72-4, at 10:13-12:1 & 27:12-28:7; 167:4-12.) Macevicz also failed

24

to disclose that he had engaged in negotiations with Lynx regarding the assignment of a patent

application to Lynx as early as November 1994, long before he left AB. (Docket No. 72-5;

2

Docket No. 72-1, ¶ 3.) He eventually assigned that application to Lynx after he left AB. (Docket

3

No. 72-6.) Finally, Macevicz breached the release by relying on the fact of the Release to move

4

for dismissal. (Docket No. 72-7.) AB therefore terminated the Release based on this

5

combination of reasons. (Id.)

6

Having terminated the Release, AB investigated and developed its damages claim against

7

Macevicz, and pursued this amendment. AB also developed and fleshed out the additional

8

grounds for its inequitable conduct claim. AB sent Defendants a copy of its proposed Second

9

Amended Complaint containing these amendments and asked if Defendants would stipulate to its

10

filing. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 3.) Defendants refused, based solely on the fact that the October 25,

11

2007 deadline in the Court’s scheduling order had already passed. (Id.)

III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standard.

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), leave to amend “shall be freely given when

15

justice so requires.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (citing FRCP 15(a)). In

16

exercising its discretion to allow amendments to pleadings, “a court must be guided by the

17

underlying purpose of Rule 15 – to facilitate decision on the merits, rather than on the pleadings

18

or technicalities.” Roth v. Garcia Marquez, 942 F.2d 617, 628 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting United

19

States v. Webb, 655 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir. 1981)). Leave to amend is “to be applied with

20

extreme liberality.” Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2001)

21

(citation omitted). Rule 15(a) thus requires a strong showing of prejudice, delay, futility, or bad

22

faith before leave to amend may be denied. Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d

23

1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003); Foman, 371 U.S. at 182.

24

When a district court has established a deadline for amended pleadings in the case

25

scheduling order, the party seeking leave to amend must request to modify the scheduling order

26

and the good cause standard of Rule 16(b) applies. Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271,

27

1294 (9th Cir. 2000).

Good Cause Exists For Allowing AB To File Its Second Amended
Complaint.

The inquiry under Rule 16(b)’s good cause standard focuses initially on the diligence of
the party seeking the amendment. “The district court may modify the pretrial schedule ‘if it
cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.’” Johnson v.
Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d 604, 609 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting FRCP 15 advisory
committee notes). That is exactly the scenario here.
There is no way that AB could have amended its complaint to allege damages against
Macevicz before October 25, 2007 because the Release was still in effect at that time. AB was
not in a position to consider terminating the Release until Macevicz filed his motion to dismiss
relying on the fact of the Release, and AB learned of his failure to disclose information as
required by the Release. Moreover, AB did not know whether or not it would be futile to allege
damages against Macevicz until January 17, 2008 when the Court denied Macevicz’s motion to
be dismissed from the case. AB then had to determine whether there would be a factual and legal
basis for obtaining damages from Macevicz, and promptly sought this amendment once it
determined that there was such a basis.
The same is true of AB’s additional allegations in support of its inequitable conduct claim.
To plead inequitable conduct, a party must allege an “affirmative misrepresentation of a material
fact, failure to disclose material information, or submission of false material information, coupled
with an intent to deceive” the PTO. eSpeed, Inc. v. BrokerTec USA, L.L.C., 480 F.3d 1129, 1135
(Fed. Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Where inequitable conduct is grounded in fraud, it must be
pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b). See Ferguson Beauregard/Logic Controls v. Mega
Sys., LLC, 350 F.3d 1327, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In other words, since notice pleading is not
enough for inequitable conduct, AB could not have simply included in its complaint a blanket
allegation that the patents-in-suit are unenforceable by Illumina.
AB’s First Amended Complaint already contains an inequitable conduct claim for all three
of the patents-in-suit based on Macevicz’s failure to disclose material prior art to the PTO.
(Docket No. 46, at 12.) However, AB has since developed facts that provide additional grounds

1

supporting that claim of inequitable conduct. As contained in AB’s proposed Second Amended

2

Complaint, these additional allegations concern Illumina’s failure to pay maintenance fees in

3

accordance with its large entity status, and Macevicz’s failure to disclose to the PTO that the

4

same claim language in the ’597 Patent was rejected for indefiniteness earlier during the

5

prosecution of the ’341 Patent.3 (Wilson Decl. Ex. 1.) Having determined that there is a

6

sufficient factual and legal basis for these allegations, AB has promptly sought to add them to its

7

complaint to ensure that all of the grounds for its inequitable conduct claim are stated clearly and

8

specifically.

9

In sum, there is good cause for allowing AB to file its Second Amended Complaint

10

because AB has been diligent in seeking to do so, and AB could not have sought the present

11

amendments before the October 25, 2007 deadline.

12
13

C.

Defendants Will Not Be Unduly Prejudiced By AB’s Amendments.

The other factors normally considered for a motion seeking leave to amend also favor

14

granting AB’s motion. In particular, Defendants will not suffer any prejudice from AB’s

15

amendments. See Coleman, 232 F.3d at 1295. The damages claim against Macevicz, as well as

16

the fact that it could not have been added earlier, result entirely from his own conduct in violating

17

the terms of the Release. Moreover, Macevicz apparently is being indemnified by Illumina for

18

legal fees and liabilities in connection with this litigation. Also, none of the other claims on

19

which the parties have been engaged in discovery and motion practice are affected or changed by

20

this amendment. Finally, the amendment adds little, if any, discovery burden on Macevicz. Fact

21

discovery is still ongoing, so Macevicz can easily seek discovery on AB’s damages claim.

22

Nor will Defendants be prejudiced by the additional grounds for AB’s inequitable conduct

23

claim. AB’s complaint already has an inequitable conduct claim, so this amendment does not add

24

any new causes of action – it merely provides more detailed allegations supporting an existing

25

claim. The underlying facts are already known to Defendants because it was their own conduct

26
3

27

“’597 Patent” refers to U.S. Patent No. 6,306,597. “’341 Patent” refers to U.S. Patent
No. 5,750,341.

1

that is the subject of the inequitable conduct allegations. Fact discovery is still ongoing, so to the

2

extent that Defendants need any discovery from AB on these allegations, they can easily obtain it.

3

Furthermore, as of the date of this motion, Defendants have not sought any discovery on

4

inequitable conduct, not even for the allegations already contained in AB’s First Amended

5

Complaint.

6

The remaining factors considered in connection with a motion to amend do not apply here.

7

By diligently seeking leave to amend, AB has not engaged in undue delay. AB’s amendments are

8

not futile, nor are they sought in bad faith.

IV.

CONCLUSION

AB respectfully requests that the Court grant AB leave to file its Second Amended
Complaint and to modify the scheduling order accordingly.
