INTRODUCTION
In October 2006, in return for the opportunity to have an off-the-record interview

2
3

with Dr. Macevicz, AB signed an agreement releasing Dr. Macevicz from any financial li-

4

ability related to any claims arising out of the Macevicz patents or inventions at issue in

5

this case. Now, without justification and near the close of discovery, AB wants to renege

6

on that release and amend its complaint to seek damages from Dr. Macevicz, thereby com-

7

pounding the complexity of this already-complex dispute. Moreover, AB seeks to amend

8

its complaint to include additional grounds for its accusation of inequitable conduct,

9

grounds that were available to AB since before it filed its complaint, but which AB says it

10

has only recently “developed and fleshed out.”

11

AB’s motion should be denied for at least the following three reasons.

12

First, AB’s motion fails to show the required “good cause” why the Court’s Case

13

Management Order of September 20, 2007 should be altered to allow AB to yet again

14

amend its Complaint based on facts that AB has known since at least November 2007. AB

15

has wholly failed to justify its months of delay in seeking to once again amend its Com-

16

plaint.

17

Second, AB’s proposed amendments would prejudice the Defendants both because

18

they come at the end of the fact discovery period and because the Court has decided that it

19

will not hear any more summary judgment motions on the patent ownership issues.
Third, AB’s proposed amendment to add damages claims against Dr. Macevicz

20
21

would be futile because AB agreed to release Dr. Macevicz from any damages in connec-

22

tion with this case and that release is still in effect.

23

II.

24

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
In the fall of 2006, AB and Solexa entered into a “Release” agreement with Dr.

25

Macevicz that absolved him “from liability for monetary damages based on any claims

26

arising out of or related to” the patents or inventions at issue in this litigation.1 In exchange

1

for the Release, Dr. Macevicz agreed to meet informally with AB’s counsel to discuss his

2

patents.
Under its terms, AB could only terminate the Release if Dr. Macevicz had refused to

3
4

discuss the patents with AB or if he had been “willfully untruthful” in his answers to AB’s

5

questions at the informal meeting.2 On December 8, 2006, as contemplated in the Release,

6

Dr. Macevicz met with AB’s counsel3 and answered all of AB’s questions.4 Nevertheless,

7

on December 17, 2007, AB sent a letter to Dr. Macevicz’s then-counsel in this litigation

8

purporting to terminate the Release.5 AB alleged in its letter that Dr. Macevicz had been

9

untruthful because he had failed to disclose a draft agreement from 1994 and an indemnity

10

agreement from 1995.6 AB also alleged that Dr. Macevicz had breached the Release be-

11

cause he was relying on it in his motion seeking his dismissal as a defendant in this case7

12

(despite the fact that Dr. Macevicz in fact did not mention the Release in his motion to dis-

13

miss).8
AB now seeks to file a Second Amended Complaint in this case to add damages

14
15

claims against Dr. Macevicz, and to add additional inequitable conduct allegations against

16

all Defendants.

17

III.

ARGUMENT

18

AB cannot show good cause for its proposed amendments to its complaint because

19

(i) AB has not been diligent in seeking to amend its Complaint; (ii) allowing the proposed

20

amendments at this point would prejudice the Defendants; and (iii) the proposed amend-

21

ments would ultimately be futile.9

2

The deadline for amending pleadings under the Court’s Case Management Order

AB fails to show just cause for amending its complaint at this late date

3

was October 25, 2007. Because that deadline passed long ago, AB must show “good cause”

4

under Rule 16(b)(4) to justify its request for leave to file its proposed Second Amended

5

Complaint.10 Under this standard, “the focus of the inquiry is upon the moving party’s rea-

6

sons for seeking modification,” and “[i]f that party was not diligent, the inquiry should

7

end.”11

8

“The inquiry should end” here because AB has not been diligent in seeking to make

9

its proposed pleading amendments. With respect to the new damages claims that AB seeks

10

to bring against Dr. Macevicz, AB asserts that it could not have brought those claims ear-

11

lier because it had released Dr. Macevicz from all financial liability regarding his patents.

12

This argument fails on its face because AB purported to terminate the Release on Decem-

13

ber 17, 2007,12 and it has not shown that it was diligent in seeking to add its damages claim

14

to its Complaint in the more than three months that passed between the December 17, 2007

15

letter and the April 3, 2008 filing of its motion for leave to amend its complaint.

16

AB’s argument also fails because AB has known since at least early November 2007

17

of the facts upon which it bases its purported termination of the Release and its belated re-

18

quest to amend its Complaint. On November 8, 2007, AB used those very documents as

19

exhibits in the first deposition it took in this case.13 In its current motion, AB implies that it

20

was diligent in waiting so long because it “had to determine whether there would be a fac-

21

tual and legal basis for obtaining damages from Macevicz” before “promptly” seeking to

22

amend its Complaint “once it determined that there was such a basis.”14 This vague expla-

three months in seeking leave, the amendment would have prejudiced the defendants, and
the amendment would have been futile).

nation cannot satisfy the just-cause standard of Rule 16. AB fails to explain what “factual

2

and legal” investigation it had to undertake (indeed, one would think AB would have inves-

3

tigated this issue before entering into the Release itself), or why any such “investigation”

4

took five months (from November 2007 to April 2008). Further, AB’s proposed Second

5

Amended Complaint does not assert any additional “basis” for damages other than the facts

6

that AB has known since before it filed its original complaint in this case.

7

AB also fails to demonstrate good cause for its proposed additions to its inequitable

8

conduct count. AB has already pled inequitable conduct against the Defendants, but now

9

seeks to add additional grounds for that claim based on Illumina’s alleged failure to pay

10

“large entity” maintenance fees at certain times, and Dr. Macevicz’s alleged failure to dis-

11

close certain facts about the prosecution of the ’341 Patent during prosecution of the ’597

12

Patent. AB wholly fails to explain why it could not have raised these allegations in its

13

original Complaint or its First Amended Complaint. AB does not assert that it needed any

14

discovery before pleading these additional grounds for inequitable conduct. It cannot, be-

15

cause the facts on which it relies are drawn from the prosecution histories of the patents,

16

and other publicly available records regarding those patents, which AB undoubtedly had

17

long before it filed its original Complaint in this case.

B.

19

Even under the less-stringent standard of Rule 15(a), the Court should deny AB’s

AB’s proposed amendments should also be denied under Rule 15(a)

20

current motion. Under Rule 15(a), the Court should consider “the presence of any of four

21

factors: bad faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, and/or futility.”15

22

As explained above, AB has unduly delayed in seeking to amend its Complaint.

23

Since before November 2007, AB has either known, or through diligence could have

24

known, of all the facts underlying its proposed amendments to its ownership and inequita-

25

ble conduct claims, and should have sought to amend its Complaint long ago. Moreover, as

26

explained below, the proposed amendments would prejudice the Defendants and would ul-

timately be futile.
1.

AB’s belated addition of damages claims against Dr. Macevicz
would prejudice the Defendants

The Defendants will be prejudiced if AB is permitted to amend its Complaint to add
4

damages claims against Dr. Macevicz because (i) AB’s undue delay leaves Defendants
5

with little time to plan for or take discovery about AB’s damages claims, and (ii) Defen6

dants will not be able to seek summary judgment on AB’s damages claims against Dr.
7

Macevicz. For example, even if the Court were to grant AB’s motion on May 15 (the day
8

AB’s motion is scheduled for hearing) and AB were to file its Second Amended Complaint
9

that same day, the Defendants’ answer and any counterclaims to the Second Amended
10

Complaint would be due one day before the end of the fact discovery period (May 30).16
11

To defeat AB’s claims for damages against him, Dr. Macevicz would assert the Re12

lease as a defense and would likely counterclaim against AB for breaching the Release (by
13

suing him for damages). Dr. Macevicz would then require discovery into AB’s basis for
14

asserting that he was “willfully untruthful” when he met with AB in December 2006 (and
15

such discovery would require depositions of AB’s trial counsel, Mr. Wilson, and its in16

house counsel, Dr. MacFerrin, who were present at the December 2006 meeting). To date,
17

Dr. Macevicz has had no reason to seek discovery on this issue.
18

Dr. Macevicz would also be prejudiced if AB is allowed to amend its Complaint be19

cause he would not be able to seek summary judgment on AB’s damages claims against
20

him. AB has not included any facts in its proposed Second Amended Complaint to support
21

its argument that Dr. Macevicz was “willfully untruthful” when he met with AB in Decem22

ber 2006. Accordingly, if AB is allowed to seek damages against Dr. Macevicz, he should
23

be permitted to seek summary judgment based on the Release. But the Court has ordered
24

that the parties may not bring any additional summary judgment motions on the patent

986 (9th Cir. 1999)).

ownership disputes in this case.17 Just as the time has passed in this case for summary

2

judgment practice regarding the ownership dispute, so too has the time passed for AB to

3

seek to amend its Complaint to add damages claims against Dr. Macevicz.

4

AB contends that Dr. Macevicz would not be prejudiced by its proposed amendment

5

because AB has always sought damages from Illumina in this case and Illumina is indemni-

6

fying Dr. Macevicz. That is not correct. Clearly, AB’s new damage claims against Dr.

7

Macevicz open new avenues of relief for AB; if it were otherwise, AB would not be seek-

8

ing to amend its Complaint to add those claims. AB asserts its breach-of-contract claim

9

only against Dr. Macevicz because only Dr. Macevicz (not Solexa or Illumina) had an em-

10

ployment agreement with AB.18 Further, although AB asserts its breach of fiduciary duty

11

claim against all Defendants, it can only assert that Illumina “aided and abetted” Dr. Mace-

12

vicz’s breach of a fiduciary duty,19 an assertion that will require additional proof beyond

13

the proof AB needs to support its claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Dr. Macevicz.

14

Consequently, AB’s proposed additional damages claims against Dr. Macevicz would

15

broaden the scope of the damages that AB seeks to recover even though Illumina is indem-

16

nifying Dr. Macevicz.
2.

17

AB’s damages claims against Dr. Macevicz would be futile

Finally, the Court should not allow AB to amend its Complaint to add damages

18
19

claims against Dr. Macevicz because those claims would ultimately be futile. AB released

20

Dr. Macevicz from any liability for monetary damages in this litigation, and for at least the

21

reasons stated above, that Release is still in effect. The Release covers “unknown and unan-

22

ticipated” claims, and includes a waiver of any rights under Section 1542 of the California

23

Civil Code,20 so AB’s argument that it can terminate the Release because it only later

24

learned about facts that would support a damages claim against Dr. Macevicz fails.

AB may only terminate the Release if Dr. Macevicz was “willfully untruthful” in his

1
2

informal discussions with AB in 2006. In its December 17, 2007 letter to Dr. Macevicz’s

3

counsel, AB asserted that Dr. Macevicz was “willfully untruthful” because he failed to dis-

4

close a 1994 discussion he had with Lynx and a 1995 indemnity agreement with Lynx.21

5

AB points to these purported “failures to disclose” again in its current motion.22 But AB

6

does not include any factual allegations in its letter, in its current motion, or in its proposed

7

Second Amended Complaint to support its conclusory allegation that Dr. Macevicz’s fail-

8

ure to mention these issues to AB constituted willful untruthfulness. AB would have to

9

prove that an omission (rather than an affirmative misrepresentation) by Dr. Macevicz re-

10

garding events that had occurred over ten years earlier constituted willful untruthfulness,

11

yet AB fails to plead any facts or point to any evidence about what Dr. Macevicz did say

12

during his informal meeting with AB in 2006, much less what he willfully and untruthfully

13

did not say.23
AB also alleges that Dr. Macevicz breached the Release by relying on the Release as

14
15

the basis for his motion to dismiss filed in November 2007.24 But Dr. Macevicz did not

16

even mention the Release in his motion to dismiss.25 Moreover, AB does not cite any au-

17

thority for the bizarre proposition that Macevicz could somehow breach the Release by in-

18

terposing it as a defense in litigation against AB itself. The very purpose of the Release was

19

to prevent Dr. Macevicz from incurring financial liability to AB. The Release itself recog-

20

nizes this purpose, stating that the parties “agree not to use this Agreement in any lawsuit,

21

except as may be necessary to enforce this Agreement.”26 To the extent that Dr. Macevicz

22

has ever relied on the Release, he did so only as necessary to enforce it so as to avoid any

Id., Ex. B.
Id. at 1-2.
23 Moreover, because he had been absolved through the Release of any financial liability prior to the December 2006 meeting, Dr. Macevicz had no reason to be untruthful about
these subjects.

CONCLUSION

3

AB released Dr. Macevicz of any financial liability relating to his patents back in

4

2006. After learning that Illumina is indemnifying Dr. Macevicz, AB wants to renege on

5

that Release, and to amend its Complaint to seek damages against Dr. Macevicz, in viola-

6

tion of that Release. But nothing that AB has learned since entering into the Release allows

7

AB to terminate the Release, or can justify AB’s lengthy delay in seeking to amend its

8

Complaint. Further, AB has not shown any diligence in seeking to add grounds to its ineq-

9

uitable conduct claims against the Defendants (all of which were available to AB since be-

10
11

fore it filed the original Complaint in this case).
Consequently, the Court should deny AB’s Motion Seeking Leave to File Second

12

Amended Complaint and to Modify Scheduling Order.
