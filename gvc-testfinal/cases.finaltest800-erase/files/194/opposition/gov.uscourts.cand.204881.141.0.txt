PSYSTAR’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO APPLE’S MOTION TO DISMISS OR
ENJOIN PROSECUTION OF THE RECENTLY-FILED FLORIDA ACTION AND TO REOPEN DISCOVERY FOR LIMITED PURPOSES
The case at bar involves Apple’s challenge to the legality of Psystar computer systems that
run Apple’s Mac OS X Leopard. Fact discovery in this case has been completed: Apple has deposed
the senior employees of Psystar, inspected Psystar products, and inspected the Psystar manufacturing

22
23
24

facility in which Psystar assembles computer systems running Leopard; similarly, Psystar has
deposed the senior engineers at Apple responsible for the design and implementation of the

25

technological protection measures in Leopard that Apple alleges Psystar circumvented. Summary-

26

judgment briefing is due in several weeks, expert depositions are proceeding next week, and trial is

27

scheduled for January 10. Psystar opposes any continuance of the trial date necessary to allow

it now regrets. It is Psystar that is prejudiced by a further delay in the trial date since it is Psystar’s

3
4
5
6

business that is being harmed by the shroud of legal doubt that Apple has created by this action.
Apple controlled the schedule for the release of Snow Leopard. Apple elected not to take
steps to add Snow Leopard to this case by seeking a late pleadings amendment. Apple elected not to

7

raise the issue of Snow Leopard’s impending release and its effect on the time needed for discovery

8

at the post-stay status conference, by motion to extend the time for discovery, or at a status

9

conference requested for that purpose. By contrast, the release of Snow Leopard was a surprise

10
11

event for Psystar. Psystar did not know when Snow Leopard would be released until Apple’s public
announcement of a release date.

And Psystar developed its new technology — selective

12
13
14

virtualization — in the days preceding and the week following the release of Snow Leopard. It is
simply incorrect to suggest that Psystar withheld any information or code during the discovery

15

period that might have induced Apple to seek a pleadings amendment sooner. And it would have

16

taken no great oracular capacity to predict that upon the release of Snow Leopard, Psystar would

17

have taken steps to get Snow Leopard running on Psystar systems. Psystar has never been opaque

18
19
20
21

about its intention to continue on in its business.
Apple had its opportunity to bring Snow Leopard into this case and chose not to. Apple
chose not to conduct discovery into Snow Leopard and stonewalled when Psystar asked questions at

22

depositions about Snow Leopard. Apple assumed that its new technological protection measures

23

would prevent Psystar from running Snow Leopard on Psystar computers. Placing its faith in its

24

security engineers —

25

Apple decided not to seek leave to amend its complaint or disclosures when Snow Leopard was

—

released or when a date certain was set for that release. Instead, Apple did nothing.
As a result, the Florida action is the first-filed case relating to Snow Leopard. Apple is free

2

Florida. Apple has not done so yet. Apple is also free to file motions in the Florida action seeking to

3

5
6

give preclusive effect to this Court’s earlier rulings on Psystar’s antitrust counterclaims, to this
Court’s forthcoming rulings on motions for summary judgment, and to the eventual jury verdict.
While Psystar does not believe that there would be any substantial preclusion between this action

7

and the Florida action, preclusion doctrines are the proper way for a defendant in multiple actions to

8

avoid unnecessary re-litigation of issues or inconsistent results. What is improper is to ask this Court

9

to intrude on and, indeed, preempt the judgment of Judge Hoeveler of the United States District

10
11

Court for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Hoeveler and his Court are quite capable of hearing
and ruling on the various arguments that Apple has improperly advanced here.

This Case Does Not Cover Snow Leopard
A.

Complaint and copyright registrations

15

Apple’s amended complaint accuses Psystar of running Mac OS X Leopard on non-Apple

16

computers, circumventing the technological protection measures that protect Mac OS X Leopard,

17

and breaching the license agreement that accompanies Mac OS X Leopard. The amended complaint

18
19
20
21

nowhere mentions Snow Leopard. There is no way it could have mentioned Snow Leopard, since
Snow Leopard was released only several weeks ago, well after the amended complaint was filed.
The amended complaint cannot have encompassed Snow Leopard because — put simply and starkly

22

— neither Snow Leopard nor the Psystar computers that run Snow Leopard existed when it was

23

filed. See Reiffin v. Microsoft Corp., 270 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1162 (N.D. Cal. 2003) (pleadings

24

amendment was procedure by which to add claims for new products released after filing of the

25

original complaint).

26
27
28

Apple’s amended complaint further cannot be construed to extend to Snow Leopard because
Apple had not registered any copyright in Snow Leopard before filing the complaint and, in fact, has

2

Amended Complaint at ¶ 26 (listing copyright registrations); Ex. F (Affidavit of Jane Dryer re:

17 U.S.C. § 411(a) (“no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall
be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance

7

with this title”); Kodadek v. MTV Networks, Inc., 152 F.3d 1209, 1211 (9th Cir. 1998). When a

8

plaintiff files an infringement action based on an unregistered copyright, the appropriate remedy is

9

dismissal of the action. See Jefferson Airplane v. Berkeley Systems Inc., 886 F. Supp. 713, 714–17

10
11

(N.D. Cal. 1994).

At a minimum, the plaintiff must file an amended complaint alleging the

registration, see Zito v. Steeplechase Films, Inc., 267 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2003) —

To this day, Apple has not
supplemented this response, even though it now contends that not only Leopard but also Snow
Leopard are within this action. In fact, Apple has not amended any of its answers to written

7

discovery so that they apply to Mac OS X Snow Leopard. And Apple has not produced documents

8

related to Snow Leopard. This is because all parties understood that Mac OS X Snow Leopard was

9

not included in this case. And, again, to this day, Apple has made no motion to amend the pleadings

10
11

to include Mac OS X Snow Leopard or the new Psystar products that allegedly infringe Snow
Leopard. Any such amendment would, of course, be improper under the very principles described

12

by Apple in its Florida Motion, since the first-filed case that addresses Snow Leopard is the case
currently pending in Florida.

After stonewalling in the depositions

, Apple cannot claim that Snow Leopard has always been covered by this action. Snow

Leopard is a new Apple product and the Psystar computers that run Snow Leopard are new Psystar

products. If Apple wanted to amend its pleadings to include Snow Leopard and Psystar products

21
22
23
24

running Snow Leopard, it should have moved to do so. Certainly Apple knew far better than Psystar
when Snow Leopard was going to be released. Any such motion should be denied now, however,
because it would necessarily upset the trial schedule in this case to the prejudice of Psystar and

25

because the first-filed action addressing Snow Leopard is the case in Florida.

Neither the parties nor the federal courts will waste effort by having issues related to Snow

legality of Psystar’s past conduct regarding Leopard will be finally determined. This is because the
evidence and legal issues surrounding Snow Leopard are radically different from those surrounding

the two cases.

course, cannot know how different they are since Apple has not yet taken any discovery on Psystar

part due to Apple’s stonewalling. Discovery should not be reopened now simply because Apple has

changed its mind about whether it wishes to include Snow Leopard in this cause of action. At

9

minimum, Apple should be required to seek leave to amend its complaint — and if Apple did so,

10
11

such leave, because there is already a pending Snow Leopard action in Florida, should be denied.
B.

Snow Leopard License v. Leopard License

12
13
14

Snow Leopard has a different “software license agreement” than Leopard. The different
agreements create legal differences not only for Apple’s breach-of-contract claims, but also for

15

Apple’s copyright-infringement and DMCA anti-circumvention claims. The Snow Leopard license,

16

see Ex. D, differs from the Leopard license, see Ex. E, in several relevant respects.

17
18
19
20
21

Ownership of the copy sold. One important legal issue is whether Apple sells copies of Mac
OS X or merely licenses the use of Mac OS X. As a matter of copyright law, this depends on
whether Apple ever sells a copy of the Mac OS X software, where copy is statutorily defined as the
physical object containing that software. Psystar contends that Apple does sell such copies in the

22

form of the physical DVD containing Mac OS X. Apple contends that it does not sell copies, but

23

merely licenses them. In the Leopard license, Apple expressly states that “[y]ou own the media on

24

which the Apple Software is recorded,” while, in the Snow Leopard license, this line has been

25

removed. This distinction may make a crucial legal difference in the cases because it is the sale of a

26
27
28

copy that triggers the § 117 (right to take steps to run software on your computer) and § 109 (firstsale doctrine) rights on which Psystar and its customers rely.

1

Enforceability of the license agreement. The Snow Leopard license agreement, unlike the

2

Leopard agreement, states that returns of the software are governed by Apple’s online return policy,

3
4
5
6

and not by the return policies of individual retailers like Amazon or Best Buy. Apple’s return policy,
unlike that of many other retailers, permits the return of software after it has been opened. Thus, a
customer who buys a copy of Snow Leopard has a chance, under the Snow Leopard license, to open

7

the copy, run the software, read the license, reject it, and return the software to Apple. But a

8

customer who buys a copy of Leopard from a retailer who does not accept returns of opened

9

software has no such opportunity. This lack of an opportunity to return the software may affect the

10
11

enforceability of the license agreement.
Decryption and reverse engineering.

The Snow Leopard license agreement, unlike the

12
13
14

Leopard agreement, contains an express prohibition on decompiling, decrypting, reverse
engineering, disassembling, or attempting to derive the source code of Mac OS X. This clause will

15

be available to Apple with respect to Psystar computers that run Snow Leopard, but not with respect

16

to computers that run Leopard. And it raises entirely new issues to be briefed on summary judgment

17

about the enforceability of such a clause in the face of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s

18
19
20
21

express grant of a right to owners of copies of software programs to reverse engineer them for
purposes of interoperability. See 17 U.S.C. § 1201(f).
Choice of law. The Snow Leopard license agreement contains a survivorship clause that says

22

that the choice-of-law provisions of that agreement survive its termination on account of an end

23

user’s breach of its terms. The Leopard license agreement contains no such survivorship clause.

24

Thus, if a Mac OS X license terminates because the end user has breached it (say, on Apple’s view,

25

by running Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware), then the Snow Leopard license provides that the

26
27
28

choice-of-law provision selecting California law survives while the Leopard license provides no such
thing. This may affect — and certainly requires different summary-judgment briefing on — the law

that applies to some or all of Apple’s state-law claims.
In short, the differences between the license agreement that applies to Snow Leopard and the
agreement that applies to Leopard make this case and the Florida case quite different legally.
C.

Virtualization v. Hook Function

The method by which Psystar computers run Mac OS X is completely different for Snow

7

Leopard than it was for Leopard. For Leopard, Psystar computers invoked a particular Apple

8

function

9

properly. This was accomplished through the Psystar-written kernel extension OpenCojones.kext.

10
11

to cause Mac OS X to

function

For Snow Leopard, Psystar uses new code to instead virtualize (that is, simulate) parts of the system
management chip (SMC) to “convince” Mac OS X that it is running on Apple hardware.

12
13
14

Virtualization like this is the backbone of a large part of the modern computing industry; indeed, it is
how Apple’s Macintosh computers are able to run Windows and Windows applications. See, e.g.,

15

http://www.vmware.com/techonology/virtualization.html (description of virtualization from the

16

leading company in the field, VMware).

17

technology in the Florida case is entirely different from the Psystar technology at issue here.

18
19
20
21

D.

As this brief description makes clear, the Psystar

New Psystar Devices

One of the issues to be litigated in the Florida case is the legality of Psystar’s “dongles” (an
industry term in wide use). Psystar’s dongles are USB sticks containing virtualization software that

22

allow end users to run Mac OS X on computers of their choice, not just computers purchased from

23

Psystar. The end user would buy a dongle from Psystar and a copy of Mac OS X from Apple or a

24

reseller like Amazon or Best Buy and would then be able to run that copy of Mac OS X on their

25

personal non-Apple computer. Psystar has worked out a design for a dongle that it intends to test,

26
27
28

manufacture, and sell in the near future, possibly depending on the progress made in the Florida
action. The dongle, of course, would be an entirely new product that is different in kind from the

Preclusion Doctrines Raised By Motion In Florida Are The Appropriate Way For
Apple To Assert Its Objections To The Antitrust Claims In The Florida Case
A surprisingly large part of Apple’s present motion is devoted not to the copyright, anti-

5

circumvention, trademark infringement, or breach-of-contract claims that Apple asserts in this case,

6

but to the antitrust claims that Psystar has asserted in Florida. Apple contends that these antitrust

7

claims are barred by this Court’s prior dismissal of the antitrust counterclaims that Psystar asserted

8
9
10
11

earlier in this case and that Psystar’s new antitrust claims are, in any event, compulsory
counterclaims that Psystar was required to bring in this Court. Neither contention is correct. But,
more importantly, both contentions can and should be raised by Apple, if at all, by motion in the

12

Florida court: to the extent this Court’s prior order raises issue or claim preclusion issues relevant to

13

the new antitrust claims, Apple can move to dismiss or for summary judgment in Florida; to the

14

extent the new antitrust claims are in fact compulsory counterclaims, Apple can move to dismiss in

15

Florida. There is no cause for this Court to intervene in matters that should be decided by Judge

16
17
18
19

Hoeveler and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Both claims of preclusion — preclusion because of the prior dismissal in this case and
preclusion under the compulsory-counterclaim rule — fail for the same reason: the antitrust claims

20

that Psystar is asserting in the Florida case relate to Apple’s conduct surrounding Snow Leopard and

21

therefore did not exist at the time the antitrust counterclaims in this case were filed or dismissed.

22

Rule 13, likewise, makes compulsory counterclaims only those counterclaims “that—at the time of

23
24

its service—the pleader has against an opposing party.” Counterclaims that arise after service of the
answer are, by definition, not compulsory. See, e.g., Dillard v. Security Pacific Brokers, Inc., 835

F.2d 607, 609 (5th Cir. 1988); Pike v. Greeman, 266 F.3d 78, 92 n.17 (2d Cir. 2001). Likewise,

As the Supreme Court explained in an antitrust case, this is so even though “both suits

7

involved essentially the same course of wrongful conduct.” Lawlor v. National Screen Service

8

Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 327 (1955). Even in such a case, a prior judgment “precludes recovery on

9

10
11

even then exist and which could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.” Id. at 328.
The Ninth Circuit, too, has held that a later-arising cause of action cannot be barred by a prior

12
13
14

judgment even if the later-arising action involves the same basic course of conduct. “A claim arising
after the date of an earlier judgment is not barred, even if it arises out of a continuing course of

15

conduct that provided the basis for the earlier claim.” Frank v. United Airlines, Inc., 216 F.3d 845,

16

851 (9th Cir. 2000). Apple’s notion that the antitrust claims in the Florida action are somehow

17

precluded by this Court’s dismissal of the anyway very different antitrust counterclaims filed here is

18
19
20
21

simply without legal foundation.
It is also worth noting that, at a factual level, the antitrust claims in Florida are quite different
from the antitrust claims that were asserted in this case. The Florida claims assert that Apple has

22

made attempts to monopolize a different market: the market for “premium computers,” defined as

23

computers priced at more than $1,000. Psystar plans to amend the Florida complaint shortly to assert

24

further market definitions, including one defining the market in personal computers running UNIX-

25

based operating systems. Windows is not a UNIX-based operating system. And, although there are

26
27

several other UNIX-based operating systems in the market, including the various flavors of Linux, it
turns out that this, too, is a market in which Apple has, and has taken anticompetitive acts to obtain

Conclusion
It is within this Court’s power to enjoin prosecution of a suit in a different federal forum. But

this should be done only when the second suit involves the same claims, the same facts, and the same
parties to such a degree that, in this Court’s discretion, it would be a waste of the federal judiciary’s
resources to have the cases proceed in parallel. An injunction barring Psystar from prosecuting the

8

Florida case would be appropriate if that case were simply a mirror image of this case, raising the

9

same legal questions on the same evidence. But the Florida case is nothing like that. The Florida

10

case concerns a new Apple product, Snow Leopard; a new series of Psystar products, including both

11
12

computers running Snow Leopard and dongles permitting end users to run their own copies of Snow
Leopard on their own non-Psystar computers; a new virtualization technology developed by Psystar;

13
14
15
16

a new license for Snow Leopard with at least four major differences from the Leopard license
affecting everything from choice of law to the enforceability of the license to whether the first-sale
doctrine and § 117 apply; and entirely new market definitions for the antitrust claims.

17

Moreover, as to Snow Leopard, the first-to-file rule, properly applied, leads to the conclusion

18

that it is the Florida court in which all Snow Leopard-related disputes should be centered. Apple

19

21
22

actively refused to engage in discovery on Snow Leopard in this case, both in its responses to written
discovery and at depositions. Instead, Apple took the position that Snow Leopard was not part of
this case because it had not yet been released. Cf. MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 535 F. Supp.

23

2d 1000, 1009 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (“The Plaintiff has not demonstrated that NuMax is in fact part of

24

the actual controversy in this case.

25

exclusively to Synagis and has never amended its pleading to reference NuMax. Furthermore,

26

Genentech states that MedImmune until very recently has refused to provide any discovery related to

27
28

Indeed, MedImmune has always directed its pleadings

NuMax.”). Having taken this position, Apple cannot now object to the filing of a new case in

RE-OPEN DISCOVERY FOR LIMITED PURPOSES (CV 08-03251 WHA)

Florida centered on the very questions it sought to avoid here.
If it turns out that there are any overlapping factual or legal issues, both Apple and Psystar
can address those issues in Florida by seeking agreement or orders limiting discovery in that case to
issues not fully explored here and by filing motions to dismiss or for summary judgment when
preclusion doctrines warrant doing so. Ordinary steps like these that will adequately protect against

7

a waste of federal judicial resources make the extraordinary step of an injunction against the

8

prosecution of an action in a co-ordinate United States District Court entirely unnecessary.

9

Moreover, enjoining the Florida action would be prejudicial to Psystar because it would necessitate

10
11

reopening discovery in this case and, as this Court stated at the September 4 hearing, continuing the
trial date beyond January. This case, and the legal doubt it creates about Psystar’s business, is an

12
13
14

extraordinary burden on Psystar.

Having gotten through discovery on all issues surrounding

Leopard, Psystar wishes to get on with trial and achieve some final resolution of the legality of its

15

activities to date. Apple should not be permitted to delay this day of reckoning by its last-minute

16

attempt to add Snow Leopard into this case.

17

Psystar respectfully requests that Apple’s motion be denied in full.
