CIVIL ACTION
NO. 05-11832-GAO
HEARING REQUESTED

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO PSYCHEMEDICS’ MOTION TO EXTEND TIME
FOR FILING A RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE THE
AFFIDAVIT OF WILLIAM THISTLE
Psychemedics’ Motion to Extend the Time for Filing A Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Strike the Affidavit of William Thistle (“Motion to Extend”) should be denied because
Psychemedics has not demonstrated good cause, either for why it should be allowed more time to
respond to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike the Affidavit of William Thistle (“Motion to Strike”) or
why it should be allowed to have until one week after allowance of the Motion to Extend to file
its opposition to the Motion to Strike. In support of Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Motion to
Strike, Plaintiffs state as follows:
1.

On June 14, 2007, pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(A)(2), the undersigned counsel

spoke to J. Allen Holland, Jr., counsel for Psychemedics, to notify him that Plaintiffs would be
filing the Motion to Strike and needed to confer with Mr. Holland under the Local Rules in an
attempt to resolve the issues in dispute. Mr. Holland acknowledged the purpose of the call and
agreed that Plaintiffs had complied with Local Rule 7.1(A)(2) regarding the filing of the Motion
to Strike.
2.

On June 15, 2007, the undersigned filed the Motion to Strike (Docket Number 48)

and a Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Strike (Docket Number 49). Plaintiffs’ Motion

A/72100520.1

to Strike and the Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Strike were served electronically on
all parties, including Mr. Holland and his administrative assistant, by the Court’s ECF system.
Copies of two separate ECF e-mail notices received by the undersigned counsel (one for the
Motion to Strike and one for the Memorandum in Support) are attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Both notices state that the pleadings would be “electronically mailed” to Mr. Holland at
“jaholland@lynchbrewer.com” and “rreale@lynchbrewer.com.”
3.

An opposition to the Motion to Strike, if any, was due on June 29, 2007, two

weeks after it was filed. To date, Psychemedics has not filed an opposition to the Motion to
Strike.
4.

Psychemedics submitted the Motion to Extend almost two weeks after its

opposition to the Motion to Strike was due, but, as of the date of this filing, Psychemedics has
not filed its opposition to the Motion to Strike. Instead, Psychemedics seeks to have until one
week after the Court rules on its Motion to Extend to submit an opposition to the Motion to
Strike. In other words, Psychemedics seeks more time to file an opposition to the Motion to
Strike than it would be entitled to under the rules.
5.

After the June 14, 2007 Local Rule 7.1(A)(2) conference described in paragraph

1, Psychemedics was aware that Plaintiffs would file the Motion to Strike. Thus, even if
Psychemedics’ counsel did not receive either of the two notices concerning the Motion to Strike
or the Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Strike1, good cause cannot be shown to justify

1

The Motion to Extend does not attach an affidavit from either Mr. Holland or his
administrative assistant regarding what they did to confirm that they did not receive either of the
Court’s two separate e-mail notifications regarding the filing of the Motion to Strike and the
Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Strike on June 15, 2007. Nor does the Motion to
Extend state: 1) that neither Mr. Holland nor his administrative assistant received an e-mail
notice of the Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Strike on June 15, 2007, or 2) that Mr.
Holland (or anyone else representing Psychemedics) did not check the Court’s docket between
June 15, 2007 and July 12, 2007. Regardless, long before July 12, 2007, Psychemedics was
either aware, or should have been aware, that Plaintiffs had filed the Motion to Strike, and
Psychemedics does not have good cause for the relief requested in the Motion to Extend.

any purported failure to check the Court’s docket regarding the status of this case as applicable to
Psychemedics.
6.

Psychemedics’ Motion to Extend should be denied on the independent ground

that opposing the Motion to Strike would be futile for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’
Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Strike.

The Affidavit of William Thistle,

Psychemedics’ General Counsel, must be stricken from the record or disregarded because it:
(1) contains several opinions on issues of law that are reserved for the Court; (2) contains factual
assertions as to which Mr. Thistle has no personal knowledge; and (3) makes contradictory,
misleading, and immaterial assertions.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court DENY Psychemedics’
Motion to Extend, GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, and GRANT any such other, further
relief as the Court deems just and proper.
