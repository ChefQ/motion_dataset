CIVIL ACTION NO. 05-11832-GAO

PSYCHEMEDICS’ MOTION TO EXTEND TIME FOR FILING RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE THE AFFIDAVIT OF WILLIAM THISTLE
Now comes Psychemedics Corporation and moves this Honorable Court to extend the
time for filing an opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike the Affidavit of William Thistle until one
week after allowance of this Motion on the grounds that Psychemedics’ counsel did not receive
notice of the filing of the Motion until he was informed of it today on the telephone by
Defendants’ counsel. The undersigned states that Robert Baker, Plaintiffs’ attorney, forwarded
to his office on July 12, 2007 a copy of the Court’s email reflecting that notice of the filing of the
Memorandum in support of the motion to strike had been sent to the undersigned and his
secretary on June 15, 2007. Both he and his secretary have checked their records and neither
has any evidence of receipt of such notice, and neither has any recollection of having received it
or notice of the filing of the motion to strike, although they have both regularly received other
notices in this case.
Counsel for Psychemedics further states that this request is fair, reasonable and
necessary for the proper administration of justice.
