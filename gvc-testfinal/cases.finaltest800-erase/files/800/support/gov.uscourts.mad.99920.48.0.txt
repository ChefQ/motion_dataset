CIVIL ACTION
NO. 05-11832-GAO
HEARING REQUESTED

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE THE
AFFIDAVIT OF WILLIAM THISTLE
Plaintiffs Ronnie Jones, Richard Beckers, Walter Washington, William Earl Bridgeforth,
Shawn N. Harris, Eugene Wade George C. Downing, Jr., Clararise Bristow, Rachelle Couch,
Keri Hogan, and the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers,
(together referred to herein as the “Plaintiffs”) hereby move, pursuant to Rules 12(f) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1(b)(2), for an Order striking the affidavit of
Psychemedics’s General Counsel William Thistle (the “Thistle Affidavit”) submitted by
Psychemedics in support of its Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Psychemedics
Corporation to Produce its Standard Operating Procedures for Testing Hair Samples for Drugs of
Abuse (“Psychemedics’s Opposition to the Motion to Compel”). In the alternative, Plaintiffs
request that the Court disregard the Thistle Affidavit. In either event, Plaintiffs ask that the court
strike all references to the content of the Thistle Affidavit from Psychemedics’s Opposition to
the Motion to Compel.

The grounds for this motion are set forth in the accompanying

memorandum of law. Further, Psychemedics should be ordered to pay the Plaintiffs’ costs,
including attorneys’ fees, incurred in bringing this Motion, in an amount to be determined upon
submission of an affidavit setting forth such costs.
