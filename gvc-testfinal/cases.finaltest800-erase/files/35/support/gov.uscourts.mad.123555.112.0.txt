LEAD PLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT
OF THEIR MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM FINAL JUDGMENT UNDER RULE 59

Lead Plaintiffs respectfully submit this notice of supplemental authority to advise the
Court of a decision by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, Public Pension Fund Group v. KV
Pharm. Co., No. 10-3402 (8th Cir. June 4, 2012) (Exhibit A), which demonstrates this Court’s
error in dismissing the Complaint by reversing a key decision on which this Court relied. In
reversing the holding in Public Pension Fund Grp. v. KV Pharm. Co., 705 F. Supp. 2d 1088
(E.D. Mo. 2010) that FDA Forms 483 are immaterial, the Eighth Circuit rejected the
contention that the receipt of Forms 483 can never render a company’s statements about
compliance with FDA regulations or CGMP false or misleading. Specifically, the Eighth
Circuit held that:

[F]or purposes of pleading a securities fraud claim, the issuance of Form 483s
may render a defendant’s statement about its compliance with FDA regulations
or cGMP false, or at least misleading, in some circumstances. The FDA’s
issuance of Form 483s may be material depending on a number of factors,
including the number, severity, and pervasiveness of objectionable conditions
noted, as well as whether a company has failed to address or correct the
deficiencies noted….

KV Pharm. op. at 15.1 The Eighth Circuit also held that the district court abused its discretion
by denying the plaintiffs’ post-judgment motion to amend their complaint. KV Pharm. op. at
27.
The circumstances that the Eighth Circuit found to demonstrate the materiality of
Forms 483 in KV Pharm. mirror the circumstances present at Genzyme. The FDA repeatedly
identified Genzyme’s CGMP deficiencies at multiple inspections, but Genzyme failed to
remedy those deficiencies while assuring investors that its highly-anticipated Lumizyme BLA
would be approved by the FDA, and that it had satisfied FDA concerns about its compliance –
even though approval of the Lumizyme BLA was contingent upon CGMP compliance at the
Allston facility (where Lumizyme was to be manufactured). Just as in KV Pharm., both
plaintiffs and the FDA alleged that the problems documented in the Forms 483 were
numerous, severe, pervasive and systemic. Complaint (ECF No. 40) at ¶¶98-101, 170, 18086; FDA Complaint ¶¶12, 17-18.

Indeed, the FDA’s complaint against Genzyme used

language nearly identical to that quoted in KV Pharm. to highlight the failure to remedy longstanding CGMP deficiencies after repeated warnings. Compare KV Pharm. at 16 with FDA
Complaint at ¶18.
As Plaintiffs explained in their Rule 59 motion, this Court’s determination that Forms
483 are immaterial led it to conclude that Defendants did not act with scienter in failing to
disclose the Forms 483 and in misrepresenting both their responses to the FDA’s criticisms
and their ability to obtain approval of Lumizyme, which was dependent upon CGMP
compliance. See Rule 59 Br. at 8-11. KV Pharm. now confirms that Lead Plaintiffs have
1

The Eighth Circuit also distinguished Acito v. IMCERA Group, Inc., 47 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 1995), on which this
Court also relied, observing that in Acito the Forms 483 at issue concerned only a small portion of the
defendant’s overall business. KV Pharm. at 17 n.9. Here, unlike in Acito, the problems concerned Genzyme’s
flagship plant.

properly alleged that the Forms 483 were material, and, consequently, that Defendants acted
with scienter. For these reasons, Lead Plaintiffs’ Rule 59 motion should be granted.
