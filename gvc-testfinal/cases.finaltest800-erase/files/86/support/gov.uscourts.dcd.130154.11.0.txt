UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Lawrence Sinclair,
Case No.: 1:08-cv-00434-HHK
Plaintiff,
MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL FOR
TUBE SOCK TED D

vs.
TubeSockTedD, mzmolly and
OWNINGLIARS,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/

Plaintiff, Lawrence Sinclair, upon his attached affidavit, by and through his undersigned
counsel and pursuant to the anomalous authority of this Court, moves to disqualify both local and
lead counsel for TubeSockTedD, and for grounds in support thereof states:
On April 25, 2008, Klimaski & Associates, P.C. and Vandenberg & Feliu, LLP entered
appearances for Defendant TubeSockTedD as local and lead counsel respectively.
However, in January and February 2008, Plaintiff was seeking counsel for the issues raised
in this matter and in that process contacted James R. Klimaski of Klimaski & Associates, P.C. This
original contact was via that firm’s online request for representation/contact form.
This contact was responded to by an individual named Donna, who stated to Plaintiff on the
telephone that she was an attorney who was asked by Mr. Klimaski to get details from Plaintiff as
to what he was looking for in legal representation for his case about the false statements being made
about him. Donna left Plaintiff this voice message and the telephone number 202-296-5600 to return
her call.
Plaintiff then had an extensive discussion with Donna during which he explained to her the

nature of the issues confronting Plaintiff and disclosed confidential information to her.
Donna then advised Plaintiff that she would meet with Mr. Klimaski and would get back to
Plaintiff in a few days. Donna then called Plaintiff back about two (2) days later with more questions
which Plaintiff answered, and she then said the firm would get back with Plaintiff the next morning.
Subsequently, Donna stated that after discussing Plaintiff’s situation with Mr. Klimaski, he felt
Plaintiff would need to find an attorney closer to where he lived and that Klimaski & Associates,
P.C. could not represent Plaintiff. Plaintiff will not here publically reveal that confidential
information that he disclosed to Donna but will disclose it in camera if necessary.
Clearly, disqualification is a drastic measure which a district court can order to insure a fair
trial. See: United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 935 (2d Cir. 1993). Additionally, conflict of
interest is universally proscribed. See: D.C. Bar Rule 1.7 — Conflict of Interest: General Rule “ (a)
A lawyer shall not advance two or more adverse positions in the same matter.”; In re Jaeger, 213
B.R. 578, 584 (C.D.Cal.1997), citing Anderson v. Eaton, 211 Cal. 113, 116, 293 P. 788 (1930)(“The
rule against representing conflicting interests is designed not only to prevent the dishonest lawyer
from fraudulent conduct, but also to prevent the honest lawyer from having to choose between
conflicting duties, rather than to enforce to their full extent the legal rights of each client.”);
Rodriguez v. Montalvo, 337 F.Supp.2d 212 (D.Mass. 2004)(“The relevant inquiry in a motion to
disqualify based on a former representation is into the degree of relevance between the two
representations, i.e., "whether the subject matter of the two representations is substantially related."
See Borges v. Our Lady of the Sea Corp., 935 F.2d 436, 439-40 (1st Cir. 1991) (identifying the
proper inquiry as, "[C]ould the attorney have obtained confidential information in the first suit that
would have been relevant to the second[?]”).

Here, by Plaintiff’s act of consulting Klimaski & Associates, P.C. and disclosing confidential
information, Klimaski & Associates, P.C. has a conflict of interest that must result in their
disqualification in this matter. Plainly, a person obtains the status of a “client” by consulting an
attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. See: Marshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 534, 320
S.E.2d 44, 47 (Ct.App.1984); In re Colocotronis Tanker Securities Litigation, 449 F.Supp. 828,
831-32 (S.D.N.Y.1978); Hoyas v. State, 456 So.2d 1225, 1228 (Fla.App. 3 Dist. 1984)(“The
privilege is said to apply in a case, such as this one, where a confidential communication is made to
an attorney with a view toward his employment, regardless of whether the attorney is subsequently
retained, see 3 Wharton's Criminal Evidence § 557 (C. Torcia, 13th ed. 1973).”
Moreover, as the confidential information that was disclosed by Plaintiff to Klimaski &
Associates, P.C. has presumably be disclosed to Vandenberg & Feliu, LLP, that firm must likewise
be disqualified to insure the a fair trial of this matter.
Last, fairness likewise demands that (i) these firms disclose the extent of disclosure of
Plaintiff’s confidential information to Defendant TubeSockTedD or counsel for any of the other
Defendants so an equitable remedy, if necessary, can be fashioned by this Court for the harm caused
by Klimaski & Associates, P.C.’s breach of its ethical duty and (ii) a “Chinese Wall” be erected
around these two firms from disclosing any information to counsel that Defendant TubeSockTedD
may subsequently employ.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests an order (i) disqualifying Defendant TubeSockTedD’s
counsel, (ii) requiring that these firms disclose the extent of disclosure of Plaintiff’s confidential
information to Defendant TubeSockTedD or counsel for any of the other Defendants so an equitable
remedy, if necessary, can be fashioned by this Court for the harm caused by to Klimaski &

_______________________________________/

Plaintiff, Lawrence Sinclair, in support of his motion to Disqualify Counsel for
