MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
OF DEFENDANT “TubeSockTedD” IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL
Rule 1.7 and the cases cited by plaintiff are obviously inapposite.
The instant case is more analogous to a case like Bennett Silvershein Associates v.
Furman, 776 F. Supp. 800 (SDNY 1991), where the party actually had had a consultation with
the attorney now sought to be disqualified. In denying the disqualification motion, the Court
noted that such motions are viewed with disfavor because "often interposed for tactical reasons",
which certainly appears to be the case here.
As the affidavit of Ms. Kelly demonstrates, no attorney client relationship was
ever formed. Mr. Sinclair had no contact with any attorney at the Klimaski firm. And the contact
he did have, with the Office Administrator, related to a different matter.
Plaintiff’s claim of having entrusted Mr. Klimaski with ‘confidences’ is obviously
fabricated, since the present case is about highly public statements by plaintiff and rebuttal by
defendant, all spread across the internet and available to the world.

If plaintiff had had any argument for ‘preserving client confidences’, he has
waived it by publishing on the internet the substance of his contact with the Klimaski firm.
In any event, (a) the Klimaski firm’s involvement has been, and is expected to be
minimal, (b) the Klimaski firm hasn’t “disclosed” anything to anybody, and (c) the motion may
be mooted by the motion to quash.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify, having failed to set forth any sufficient basis for
disqualification, should be denied.

DECLARATION
RAY BECKERMAN declares under penalty of perjury:
1. I am a member of Vandenberg & Feliu, LLP, attorneys for defendant
“TubeSockTedD”, and respectfully submit this declaration in opposition to plaintiff’s motion to
disqualify attorneys for defendant TubeSockTedD.
Lead counsel.
2. Although plaintiff seeks disqualification of the undersigned, he makes no
averments regarding me or my firm whatsoever, other than that “presumably” plaintiff’s
“confidential information” was disclosed to us. Suffice it to say that nothing whatsoever has been
“disclosed” to us about the plaintiff, nor will be.
Local counsel.
3. Because I am not admitted to practice in the District of Columbia, and needed
to be admitted pro hac vice, we retained local counsel, Klimaski & Associates, PC (the
“Klimaski firm”), to assist us.
4. Annexed hereto as exhibit A is the affidavit of Ms. Donna Kelly, the Office
-1-

Administrator of the Klimaski firm.
5. The declaration sets forth, in sum, that Ms. Kelly is not an attorney and has
never held herself out to be one, that she did receive an inquiry from Mr. Sinclair in early
February, that the inquiry did not relate to any lawsuit or possible lawsuit against
“TubeSockTedD” or “mzmolly” or “Owningliars”, and that her response to plaintiff was that Mr.
Klimaski declined to represent him, and suggested he seek out an attorney in Minnesota.
6. Annexed hereto as exhibit B is an April 28, 2008, internet blog post by
plaintiff, in which he discusses his claim to having consulted with the Klimaski firm.
7. On page 2, he confirms Ms. Kelly’s statement that the inquiry related to
possible claims against David Axelrod and the Democratic National Committee.
8. Based upon the foregoing, and the reasons expressed in our accompanying
memorandum, plaintiff’s motion to disqualify counsel should be denied.
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that the plaintiff’s disqualification
motion be in all respects denied.
Dated: New York, New York
May 11, 2008
