MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
OF DEFENDANT “TubeSockTedD” IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL
Rule 1.7 and the cases cited by plaintiff are obviously inapposite.
The instant case is more analogous to a case like Bennett Silvershein Associates v.
Furman, 776 F. Supp. 800 (SDNY 1991), where the party actually had had a consultation with
the attorney now sought to be disqualified. In denying the disqualification motion, the Court
noted that such motions are viewed with disfavor because "often interposed for tactical reasons",
which certainly appears to be the case here.
As the affidavit of Ms. Kelly demonstrates, no attorney client relationship was
ever formed. Mr. Sinclair had no contact with any attorney at the Klimaski firm. And the contact
he did have, with the Office Administrator, related to a different matter.
Plaintiff’s claim of having entrusted Mr. Klimaski with ‘confidences’ is obviously
fabricated, since the present case is about highly public statements by plaintiff and rebuttal by
defendant, all spread across the internet and available to the world.

If plaintiff had had any argument for ‘preserving client confidences’, he has
waived it by publishing on the internet the substance of his contact with the Klimaski firm.
In any event, (a) the Klimaski firm’s involvement has been, and is expected to be
minimal, (b) the Klimaski firm hasn’t “disclosed” anything to anybody, and (c) the motion may
be mooted by the motion to quash.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify, having failed to set forth any sufficient basis for
disqualification, should be denied.
