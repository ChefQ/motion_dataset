PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Defendant Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank" or "the Bank"')
respectfully submits this memorandum of law pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure in support of its motion to dismiss the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Maryann
Robinson ("Robinson"). In her Complaint, Robinson asserts a single claim for fraudulent
inducement, alleging that the Bank fraudulently induced her to leave her previous employer and
enter into employment with Deutsche Bank by making misrepresentations and omissions of facts
concerning its loan approval and credit process. As described below, this claim fails because
Robinson's purported reliance on these alleged facts was not, as a matter of law, reasonable.

Where an agreement between the parties has been formalized in writing, New York
courts are typically reluctant to consider a plaintiff's reliance on oral representations reasonable.
This is particularly so where, as here, the plaintiff is a sophisticated party. This reluctance is
further increased where, as here, the plaintiff has entered into an agreement containing a merger
clause that reflects the parties' intention to make the agreement comprehensive and controlling.

Robinson is a highly sophisticated plaintiff with almost twenty years of experience as a
private banker. Before joining Deutsche Bank, she worked as an executive for such renowned
financial institutions as Citibank, Union Bank of Switzerland, and HSBC. (Complaint
("Compl.") 4 8, 9.) In addition to her own sophistication, Robinson was represented throughout
the hiring process and negotiation of her agreement by Outten & Golden, LLP, a highly
sophisticated employment law firm. Even with such knowledge, experience and expertise in the
negotiations, her employment agreement does not contain any provisions addressing the oral
promises and representations allegedly made by Deutsche Bank during her interview process.

Moreover, the final agreement between Robinson and Deutsche Bank contained a merger
clause stating that, "this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Deutsche

Bank, including its agents or employees and supercedes all other representations, warranties,
Case 1:07-cv-11189-BSJ-DCF Document7 Filed 02/04/2008 Page 5 of 14

agreements, and understandings, oral or otherwise, with respect to matters contained in this
Agreement." This clause makes clear that the parties' intended for the agreement to constitute
the entire terms of Robinson's employment, and that no other representations should be relied
upon.

In light of the foregoing, Robinson cannot establish that she reasonably relied on any oral
representations made by the Bank. Therefore, the Court should grant the Bank's motion to
dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and dismiss the Complaint in

its entirety.
STATEMENT OF FACTS!

A. Robinson's Background and Expertise

Robinson graduated magna cum laude from Saint Mary's College-Notre Dame in 1982
with a B.B.A. in Finance and Accounting. (Compl. 0x00A7 7.) She received a Masters of Management
from Northwestern University in 1986. (Id.) Having worked in the banking industry since 1982,
she has almost twenty years of experience as a private banker and has worked for various
financial institutions such as Citibank, N.A. and Union Bank of Switerland. (Compl. { 8.) In
fact, Robinson previously worked for Deutsche Bank's Private Wealth Management Division
from February 21, 1995 to July 7, 1997.

Prior to returning to Deutsche Bank in July 2007, Robinson worked for HSBC Bank USA
for almost ten years, most recently as Senior Vice President in their Domestic Private Banking
Group. (Compl. { 9.) In this position she provided financial services to high net worth
individuals with an average net worth of $50 million and their affiliates. (Id.) In 2006, this
client base generated substantial revenue for HSBC. (Id.) In addition, in this role, Robinson

supervised three bankers and other financial professionals. (Id.)

 

Deutsche Bank denies Robinson's allegations in the Complaint, including her assertions that (1) Deutsche

Bank made material representations or omitted material facts, and (2) that such misrepresentations or omissions
were knowingly false. However, for purposes of this motion only, Deutsche Bank accepts the allegations in the
Complaint as true.

B. The Interview Process At Deutsche Bank

In early 2006, Deutsche Bank approached Robinson about hiring her to work in its
Private Wealth Management Division ("PWM") as a private banker. (Compl. { 10.) Robinson,
however, was reluctant to leave her position at HSBC, where she had worked for ten years.
(Compl. { 13.) Additionally, she was concerned that Deutsche Bank was not in a position to
adequately serve her clients' needs. (Id.) Therefore, she determined that any discussion about
joining the Bank was premature and turned down the Bank's offer of employment. (1d.)

In February 2007, after a recruiter from Lockwood Gibbs Associates ("LGA") contacted
Robinson to reiterate that the Bank was still interested in hiring her, Robinson agreed to
interview with Deutsche Bank at that time. (Compl. 0x00A7 14.) Robinson interviewed with
numerous members of Deutsche Bank's senior management, including Thomas Bowers
("Bowers"), head of U.S. PWM, and Kyle Delaney ("Delaney"), head of the Eastern Region of
the U.S. Private Bank. (Compl. { 15.) During these interviews, Robinson described the profile
of her clients in extensive detail, including the fact that they were wealthy entrepreneurs with
various business interests and investment needs. (Compl. { 16.) In an effort to determine that
the Bank could service her clients, Robinson asked specific questions about the Bank's mortgage
program and lending processes. (Compl. {| 20, 21.) She also met with Elizabeth Engel,
Managing Director, Head of PWM Lending, with whom she discussed the Bank's credit
approval process. (Compl. {| 20.)

C. Negotiations
Robinson retained Outten & Golden LLP, an employment law firm, to assist her in

negotiating the terms of her employment with Deutsche Bank.' Specifically, Robinson and the

* When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court may refer to "documents attached to the
complaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference, to matters of which judicial notice may be taken, or to
documents either in plaintiffs' possession or of which plaintiffs had knowledge and relied on in bringing suit." Brass
vy. American Film Techs., Inc., 987 F.2d 142, 150 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P.,

949 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. 1991)). Indeed, "[w]hile consideration of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) 1s
generally limited to consideration of the complaint itself, consideration of materials outside the complaint is not

entirely foreclosed." Feitshans v. Kahn, 2006 WL 2714706, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2006). This is particularly so

 
Case 1:07-cv-11189-BSJ-DCF Document7 Filed 02/04/2008 Page 7 of 14

Bank negotiated over Robinson's replacement award and its vesting period, Company
indemnification, and her non-solicitation period. (See Drago Decl. Ex. A.) After extensive
negotiations, Robinson and the Bank came to an agreement regarding the terms of her
employment.
D. The Written Agreement and Merger Clause

On April 3, 2007, Deutsche Bank sent Robinson a written offer letter (the "Agreement")
setting forth the terms of her employment, including her total compensation and benefits, as a
private banker and Managing Director in PWM. (Compl. 0x00A7 22.) Notably, the Agreement did not
include language regarding the Bank's lending and credit approval process. Included within the
Agreement was a merger clause which states, "This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between you and Deutsche Bank, including any of its agents or employees and supercedes all
other representations, warranties, agreements, and understandings, oral or otherwise, with respect
to the matters contained in this Agreement." (See Drago Decl. Ex. B.) After an extensive
interview process and negotiations, Robinson accepted Deutsche Bank's offer of employment.
(Compl. { 23.) She signed the Agreement on April 18, 2007 and began working for Deutsche
Bank as a private banker and Managing Director in PWM on July 9, 2007. (Compl. {{ 23, 27.)

On November 5, 2007, Robinson tendered her resignation to the Bank. (Compl. { 40.)

Her complaint followed.
ARGUMENT

I. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates dismissal of a complaint
if there is a "`failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

While a court deciding a motion to dismiss must assume that "all the allegations on the

 

where "the court has determined that there are no disputes as to the authenticity, accuracy and relevance of such
materials." Id, Here, Robinson obviously had knowledge of, and could not dispute, that she was represented by
Outten & Golden LLP during her hiring negotiations with the Bank. Therefore, it is proper for the Court to consider
this representation in deciding the Bank's motion to dismiss.
Case 1:07-cv-11189-BSJ-DCF Document7 Filed 02/04/2008 Page 8 of 14

complaint are true," Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007), the complaint
must contain "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of a cause of action's
elements." Id. at 1959. To establish a legally cognizable claim, plaintiff must allege "enough
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 1974. See also ATS] Commce'n,

ne. v. Shaar Fund Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 99 (2d Cir. 2007). As described below, Robinson has

I

failed to plead, and indeed cannot establish, facts necessary to support her claim for fraudulent

inducement. Accordingly, her claim should be dismissed.

Il. ROBINSON'S CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT FAILS BECAUSE
SHE CANNOT ESTABLISH THAT SHE REASONABLY RELIED UPON THE
ALLEGED ORAL MISREPRESENTATIONS

A. Elements of a Fraudulent Inducement Claim

Under New York law, to sustain a claim for fraudulent inducement a plaintiff must
successfully prove "(1) a knowingly false representation of a material fact and (2) detrimental
reliance thereon." Wurtsbaugh v. Banc of America Sec. LLC, 2006 WL 1683416, at *6
(S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2006) (internal citation omitted). The false representation of a material fact
"can be either a misrepresentation or the material omission of a fact." Id. Critically, "/rjeliance
means `reasonable' reliance." Id. (emphasis added).

Here, Robinson's attempt to establish a claim for fraudulent inducement fails because
she cannot prove that her reliance upon the alleged oral representations made by Deutsche Bank
was reasonable. Robinson is a sophisticated party who knowingly entered into a written
Agreement, which included a merger clause, with Deutsche Bank. As such, she cannot now

claim that she was misled or that she reasonably relied on any oral statements or omissions

allegedly made by the Bank during her job interviews.
Case 1:07-cv-11189-BSJ-DCF Document7 Filed 02/04/2008 Page Qof 14

B. Robinson Is A Sophisticated Party Who Could Not Be Said To Have
Reasonably Relied On The Oral Representations

A claim of fraud may be dismissed on the pleadings where "a plaintiff will not be
able to establish that reliance on the alleged representation was reasonable." Wurtsbaugh, 2006
WL 1683416, at *6. In assessing whether or not the plaintiffs reliance was reasonable, courts
consider the entire context of the transaction, "including factors such as its complexity and
magnitude, the sophistication of the parties, and the content of any agreements between them."
Emergent Capital Inv. Mgmt., LLC v. Stonepath Group, Inc., 343 F.3d 189, 195 (2d Cir. 2003).

In New York, courts are reluctant to find a plaintiffs reliance on oral
communications to be reasonable when the parties' have documented their deal in a written
agreement. "This reluctance stems from the view that `a party will not be heard to complain that
he has been defrauded when it is his own evident lack of due care which is responsible for his
predicament."" Junk v. Aon Corp., 2007 WL 4292034, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2007) (quoting
Emergent Capital, 343 F.3d at 195).

Here, as discussed above, Robinson has a B.B.A. in Finance and Accounting from
Saint Mary's College-Notre Dame and a Masters in Management from Northwestern University.
(Compl. 7.) She has been a member of the banking industry for twenty-six years and, as such,
is familiar with its practices and customs. (Compl. { 8.) Moreover, Robinson has almost twenty
years experience as a private banker, and has worked for various financial institutions such as
Citibank, Union Bank of Switzerland and HSBC. (Compl. {0x00A7 8, 9.) In fact, Robinson previously
worked for Deutsche Bank's Private Wealth Management Division from February 21, 1995 to
July 7, 1997. Prior to returning to Deutsche Bank in July 2007, Robinson rose to the position of
Senior Vice President of HSBC in the Domestic Private Banking Group, where she was

responsible for providing financial services to high net worth individuals with an average net
Case 1:07-cv-11189-BSJ-DCF Document7 Filed 02/04/2008 Page 10 of 14

worth of $50 million. Her client base generated substantial revenue for HSBC in 2006. (Compl.
49.)

This is not the resume of a naive individual who could not appreciate the terms of her
written Agreement or understand the need to insert appropriate language in the Agreement
addressing terms that were important to her. Rather, Robinson is a sophisticated, experienced,
educated business woman who had every opportunity to, and was capable of, incorporating the
alleged oral representations made to her into the Agreement. See Alter v. Borgoricin, 1997 WL
691332, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 1997) (fraudulent inducement claim based on oral promises
fails where it was within the plaintiff's power to incorporate those promises into the Employment
Agreement and where plaintiffs failure to do so reflects either his own inconvenient candor or
his lack of foresight, but not fraud). If Robinson was so concerned about the Bank's lending and
credit approval process, and its ability to deliver on her clients' needs, she should have included
language to that effect in her Agreement. She did not. Therefore, she should not now be "heard
to complain that [s]he has been defrauded when it is [her] own evident lack of due care which is
responsible for [her] predicament." Junk, 2007 WL 4292034, at *7.

Additionally, as if Robinson's notable accolades and career achievements were not
enough to render her a "sophisticated" party within the meaning of the law, she was also
represented during her hiring negotiations with the Bank by Wendi Lazar of Outten & Golden,
LLP, a prestigious employment law firm. Attorneys are typically considered sophisticated
parties within the eyes of the court. See Junk, 2007 WL 4292034, at 7. Therefore, both an
experienced business woman like Robinson and her lawyer would clearly be capable of
understanding the need to incorporate any promises deemed critical into her Agreement and

clearly are "sophisticated parties" within the meaning of the law.
