RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT

I, Cristina Mirela Dumitrascu defendant acting in pro se,
respond in opposition to plaintiff Ionel Samuel Dumitrascu
(Ionel)'s motion to remand the case to the Delaware County
District Court. That motion filed 11/02/2015 was mailed to the
attorney in Fairfax California that is assisting me. Ionel's

attorney claims it was mailed 11/03/2015, but it was not

received in California until 11/10/2015.

Ionel "Proposition I" is that the removal on the ground of

federal question was filed more than 30 days after I received
notice of the appellate order

Notice of the appellate order was received by mail in Fairfax CA

on 08/31/2015, at the office of an attorney that is not of

record and is simply assisting me probono with the law and

communication. I am located in the state of Ecuador, and I was

not on notice until three days later.

I filed a motion for rehearing of the order by the appellate
court. On 09/29/2015 the appellate court signed an order denying
my rehearing petition making its order final. I did not opt to
appeal it to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. On the same day,
09/29/2015, I mailed the Notice Of Removal to the federal court.
I attach evidence of the certified mail. At that point the case

was in process under state procedural rules, and therefore

timing of service controlled by Oklahoma's mailbox rule.

".., the Supreme Court has indicated that when
certified mail service is made under local law,
service is effective at the time provided by local
law. [Murphy Bros., Inc. v. Michetti Pipe Stringing,
Inc. (1999) 526 US 344, 348, 119 S.Ct. 1322, 1326]

I submit that it was not until 09/29/2015 that I was on notice
that the order would not be changed and was final. To have sent
the Notice Of Removal before that date would have made senseless

my attempt to have the appellate court change its order,

I submit that the appellate order did not simply introduce an

element that made the case removable. The order vacated all

litigated issues, implying litigation would have to start anew
from the beginning, as if no process had yet existed. Arguably I
would have then had an option to remove the case within 30 days
of the time that the new process would start. The first notice

of a hearing to begin the new process was recorded in the state

district court on 09/09/2015.

I submit that under any of the facts above, and in the context
of a litigant with limited resources, 3000 miles away in a

foreign country, justice is served by holding the filing as

timely .

Ionel's "Proposition II" is that removal is untimely under 28
U.S.C. 0x00A71332 because I filed for removal more than one year

after commencement of the action in state district court

The one year requirement " is not " applicable where
original complaint removable: Most courts hold the
one-year limit on diversity removals applies only
where developments in a nonremovable case render it
removable (e.g., settlement with nondiverse defendant
or amending the prayer to seek more than $75,000; see
72:3375). [Ritchey v. Upjohn Drug Co. (9th Cir. 1998)
139 F3d 1313, 1316-1317; New York Life Ins. Co. V.
Deshotel (5th Cir. 1998) 142 F3d 873, 886-887; Johnson
vy. America Online, Inc. (ND CA 2003) 280 F.Supp.2d
1018, 1023, fn. 3]

The one-year limit, therefore, does not apply toa
state court action that was removable in the first

instance. It is subject to removal within 30 days
after receipt of process ((2:3230) .. even if this
occurs more than one year after the action was filed.
[Ritchey v. Upjohn Drug Co., supra, 139 F3d at 1316-
1317; Brown v. Tokio Marine & Fire Ins. Co. (8th Cir.
2002) 284 F3d 871, 873]....The case was removable for
fedeeral question form inception and can be removed
to federal court even if more than a year has passed
since the case was filed.( Rutter Group Practice
Guide: Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial National

Edition)
This case of concurrent subject matter jurisdiction and

diversity of citizenship was removable from inception.

Since all litigated issue were voided, there is no issue of
substantial progress in the case causing substantial delay or
disruption. The effect of an order to vacate all litigated
issues implies that in the eyes of the law the one year of

process is not an operative factor.

Ionel's "Proposition III" is based on the domestic relations
exception.

As I stated in the Notice of Removal, I do not ask the federal
court to grant a divorce or alimony, nor a decree of custody.
Those are the only powers contained in the domestic relations
exception to diversity jurisdiction noted in dictum in Barber v.
Barber (21 How. 582, 584) and explicated in Ankerbrandt v.
Richards. Tort or contract claims, are not excepted from
federal-court jurisdiction simply because they arise ina

domestic relations context.

Case 4:15-cv-00561-JED-FHM Document 11 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 11/23/15 Page 5 of 15

2 The domestic relations exception does not permit a district
court to refuse to exercise diversity jurisdiction over a
tort action for damages. The exception, as articulated by
this Court since Barber, encompasses only cases involving
the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody
decree. As so limited, the exception's validity must be
reaffirmed, given the long passage of time without any
expression of congressional dissatisfaction and sound
policy considerations of judicial economy and expertise.
Because this lawsuit in no way seeks a divorce, alimony,
child custody decree, the Court of Appeals erred by
affirming the District Court's invocation of the domestic
relations exception. Federal subject matter jurisdiction
pursuant to 1332 is proper in this case. Pp. 701-704. (504

U.S. 689 (1992)

In future process I intend to argue that all process in the

state district court is void

or

A void order which is one entered by court which
lacks jurisdiction over parties or subject matter, or
lacks inherent power to enter judgment, or order
procured by fraud, can be attacked at any time, in any
court, either directly or collaterally, provided that
party is properly before court", People ex rel. Brzica
v. Village of Lake Barrington, 644 N.E.2d 66 (I11.App.

2 Dist. 1994).

"A `void' judgment, as we all know,
grounds no rights, forms no defense to actions
taken thereunder, and is vulnerable to any
manner of collateral attack (thus here, by ).
No statute of limitations or repose runs on
its holdings, the matters thought to be
settled thereby are not res judicata, and
years later, when the memories may have grown
dim and rights long been regarded as vested,
any disgruntled litigant may reopen the old
wound and once more probe its depths. And it
is then as though trial and adjudication had
never been." (10/13/58 FRITTS v. KRUGH.

SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN, 92 N.W.2d 604, 354
Mich. 97)

From inception of the district court case, and throughout the

appellate process, I have claimed that the divorce petition was
void for lack of jurisdiction of the res of the marriage. Having
convinced his family that we needed to start a new life in
Ecuador; having for that settled purpose sold all family
personal property including Ionel's truck; having left Ionel's
pastor in charge of a second auction of our home, and some time
after received an offer from the pastor to buy it; and having
thus together left the state of Oklahoma for a new home in
Ecuador: Ionel could not a month later return alone and within
one month of his return claim to meet the statutory requirement
of residency to file for dissolution.

The court of appeals makes reference to a divergence of facts,
but did nothing to ask the district court to carry out the

proper investigation to resolve this issues of fundamental

jurisdiction over the marriage.

Upon that questionable beginning the case proceeded without any
notice to me, upon fraudulent representation that we all had

been resident of Oklahoma the six months preceding filing; that

Page 6 of 13
Case 4:15-cv-00561-JED-FHM Document 11 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 11/23/15 Page 7 of 15

I had kidnapped the children to Ecuador and could not with due
diligence be found. That defamatory calumny is now repeated by
Ionel's present attorney in the remand motion, even after JIonel
recanted on the accusation, and stated in his response to the
petition in error that we had indeed left together for Ecuador,

and he had returned alone after a domestic disagreement. Further

he admitted that he was always in touch with me by email; and

in touch with all my family.

When I made an appearance in Delaware District Court through the
Department of Human Resources by petition to secure child
support, this petition was fraudulently dismissed on the basis
of a void petition of dissolution that was subsequently amended
and again illegally served by publication. The decision of the
appellate court is sufficient comment on the legality of the

process that continued to the divorce decree.

As a next step I_ intend to file a Rule 60 motion for relief
from the state judgment

The Rule 60 motion will be based on extrinsic fraud and
fraud on the court.

Rule 60(b) (3) is limited to fraudulent acts by
"an opposing party." However, another part of Rule 60
authorizes setting aside a judgment for "fraud on the
court." [FRCP 60(d) (3) (next to last sentence)] The

Case 4:15-cv-00561-JED-FHM Document 11 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 11/23/15 Page 8 of 15

purpose is to protect the integrity of the court.
Therefore, relief may be obtained from judgments
obtained through fraud of attorneys, witnesses or
nonparties. [See Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-
Empire Co. (1944) 322 US 238, 245-246, 64 S.Ct. 997,
1001; and Toscano v. C.I.R. (9th Cir. 1971) 441 F2d
930, 934-937-fraud by complainant's husband and

attorney]

\

Moreover, a court has "inherent power ... to
investigate whether a judgment was obtained by fraud,"
and may bring before it "all those who may be
affected...." See Universal Oil Products Co. v. Root
Refining Co., 328 U.S. 575, 580, 66 S.Ct. 1176, 90

L.Ed. 1447 (1946).

Rooker-Feldman therefore does not bar subject
matter jurisdiction when a federal plaintiff alleges a
cause of action for extrinsic fraud on a state court
and seeks to set aside a state court judgment obtained
by that fraud." [ Kougasian v. TMSL, Inc. (9th Cir.
2004) 359 F3d 1136, 1141 ; Loubser v.Thacker (7th Cir.
2006) 440 F3d 439, 442-Rooker-Feldman no bar to suit
by divorcee who alleged civil rights conspiracy to
corrupt state judicial process and to deprive her of
property in divorce judgment (Prac. Guide Fed. Civ.
Proc. Before Trial (Nat Ed.) Ch. 2E-11)

Even though I raised the issue of extrinsic fraud in the

state action, it was completely ignored and never addressed

in the state courts

The illegal implications of the present mandate from the
Oklahoma Supreme Court

Any remand to state district court under the present

mandate is tantamount to forcing me to violate the UCCJEA,

federal and international law. More than three years since
my children left Oklahoma to reside in Ecuador, it is
beyond question that Ecuador is their "home state", and
holds jurisdiction over any "first custody" determination.
Such a remand would require me to act in opposition to such
jurisdiction granted to Ecuador under The Hague Convention.
The order implies the Oklahoma Supreme Court does not
recognize Ecuador as as state, in direct opposition to the
requirement of the UCCJEA. Further the Oklahoma Supreme
Court assumes authority to order new process under The
Hague Convention, implying some legal or equitable tolling
of a requirement that should have been met in the first
year the issue arose. Such an order is in direct opposition
to the holding of the United States Supreme Court in Lozano
v. Alvarez (U.S. Supreme Court - No. 12-820(U.S. Mar 05,
2014) that established that the 1-year period in Article 12
of the Hague Convention is not subject to equitable
tolling; and that it is in fact a fixed l-year period
agreed upon by treaty by the signatories countries, which
includes Ecuador. Further in Justice Alito's concurrence it
is made clear that, the l-year period having passed, the

home state that has become the habitual residence of any

child has the right of a "first custody" determination on
the basis of the equitable discretion of that court. Upon
remand I would be forced to choose between participation in
a state process that is in direct opposition to superior
federal law and to the international rights of the country
where my children and I are domiciled , or to accept the
risk of refusal to participate in a process I believe in

good faith to be illegal.

Any remand to the Delaware County district court would be
to sanction violation of our rights to the equal protection

of Oklahoma law.

 

Before the divorce trial I wrote the associate district
judge to remove himself from my case, and wrote his
superior, the district judge in Ottawa County to assign the
case to another judge. In my reply brief I appealed to the
authority of 0.S.0x00A712-140 to have my case removed to another
county, thus meeting all Oklahoma procedural requirements
for a change of venue. The appellate order, while
confirming violation of constitutional due process and
abuse of discretion, still acted to deprive us of that

protection under Oklahoma law, by remanding to the same
