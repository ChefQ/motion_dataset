SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT
I, Cristina Mirela Dumitrascu defendant acting in pro se, take the
opportunity to clarify my position, given the insistence by
petitioner's attorney to keep repeating arguments already briefed. I
am also attaching evidence of certified mailing of the Notice of
Removal, a copy of my petition for rehearing, the appellate court's
denial and the final mandate by the Oklahoma Supreme Court
Further I submit:.
[1] I was never allowed the opportunity for removal at the inception
of the case
28 U.S.C.§1446. Procedure for removal of civil actions
(b) Requirements; Generally.—(1) The notice of removal of a
civil action or proceeding shall be filed within 30 days
after the receipt by the defendant, through service or
otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth
the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding
is based, or within 30 days after the service of summons
upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been
filed in court and is not required to be served on the
defendant, whichever period is shorter.
I was never served copies of the initial pleadings, nor served with

Case 4:15-cv-00561-JED-FHM Document 16 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/07/16 Page 2 of 5

summons to have been able to remove within 30 days under 28
U.S.C.§1446.

Ionel's attorneys

argue I should have removed within 30 days of the

first pleadings, They fail to point out that the first pleading was
served by publication, based on sworn declaration that by diligent
search I could not be found. The attorneys themselves

established

the falsehood of that representation by filing Ionel's Reply to the
Petition In Errors, admitting that he was at all times in contact
with me by email and in touch with my family.

They also fail to point out that the amended petition upon which the
entire case now rests was filed 3/13/2013, and Alias Service of
Summons By Publication and

Proof of Publication completed and

recorded by 4/9/2013. The first evidence in the record that I was
even aware of a lawsuit by petitioner is 4/13/2013. Yet on 2/13/2013
the Department of Human Services filed an appearance in my name to
collect child support in Delaware County Court: case FD-2013-00041.
Ionel was served with it on 2/25/2013. Ionel's attorneys appeared in
the child support case on 2/27/2013 to have it dismissed, based on
the claim that a petition for dissolution already existed. Having
amended the petition based on information in the child support case,
the attorneys relied back to authorization to file by publication in
the original petition, and proceeded with service of summons and
complaint by publication. I submit such conduct represents willful

misconduct and that it was not at all intended to give me actual
notice of the lawsuit. When it was technically in default. I learned
by making an inquiry with the secretary at OKDHS 's Jay office, that
there was a previous divorce action filed. They did not even bother
telling me the petition number; I found it by search on the internet.
In a petition that pleaded and concluded at trial with deprivation of
my civil rights, my rights to parenthood and to private property, and
violations of my children due process rights and rights to support: I
was never properly served with the initial pleading nor with legal
service of summons, as required by Oklahoma and by federal law.
[2] The case stated in the initial pleadings was removable, and thus
the requirement of §1446(b)(3) is not applicable.
§1446(b)(3)
Except as provided in subsection (c), if the case stated by
the initial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal
may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the
defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of an
amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which
it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is
or has become removable.
This section addresses a case where “the case stated by the
initial pleading is not removable”. The issues of federal
question and diversity of citizenship are discernible from the
original petition,the amended petition and request for
emergency order, on the ground that the

an

children had been

abducted to a foreign country. The significance of the appellate
order was that by vacating all litigated issues the appellate
court was taking us back to a new proceeding.

[3] If the §1446(b)(3) scenario were applicable in my case , my
notice of removal still fell within the 30 day requirement.
I attach receipt of certified mail by the USPO dated 09/29/2015.
I submit that under Oklahoma's mailbox rule, that is the
effective date of filing.
“.. the Supreme Court has indicated that when
certified mail service is made under local law,
service is effective at the time provided by local
law. [Murphy Bros., Inc. v. Michetti Pipe Stringing,
Inc. (1999) 526 US 344, 348, 119 S.Ct. 1322, 1326]
[4] The appellate court vacated all issues that Ionel presented
at trial, but chose to ignore other fundamental issues in the
appeal that preceded it.
No issues were litigated, given that for the entire course of
the case, under a peculiar hearsay rule that only allowed in
evidence proffered in person at the Jay Courthouse, only the
father was allowed to introduce evidence. And only the father
was allowed to testify at trial.

Having vacated all issues in the trial, without any evidence of
any due process.

the appellate court issued a mandate that

assumes jurisdiction of the subject matter of the marriage, and
assumes all procedural requirements of notice and summons are
met. It then proceeded to establish Oklahoma as the “home state”
of the children based on the absence of any other American
state. Upon those findings it mandates that a renewed “Hague
Convention” process take place in state court, ignoring a 1-year
limitation that is now the established law of the land.

[5] On 9/29/2015 the appellate court denied my rehearing
petition, allowing the new mandate to begin.

In my rehearing petition I suggested that jurisdictional and
procedural issues mentioned in my appeal could be resolved by
Ionel filing a new petition for dissolution Then those issues
that properly belong in state court could be remanded I submit
it was proper for me to assume that 9/29/2015 marked the
beginning of a new mandated process, and that from that point I
had 30 days to remove the case to federal court

I ask this Court to first consider the Rule 60 motion I shall
file next, before deciding what validity and cognizance can be
given to the case and judgment in state court, and what aspect
of the case, if any, can be properly remanded there.
Respectfully submitted:
