Plaintiff,

Defendants.

STATE OF NEW YORK
ss.:

)
COUNTY OF NEW YORK

DEBORAH BASS, being duly sworn, deposes and says:

1. Affiant is a member of the firm of Ledy-Gurren, Bass & Siff, L.L.P., attorneys
for the defendant Verizon New York, Inc. ["Verizon'], and | am fully familiar with the facts
and circumstances of the above-captioned action.

2. Affiant makes this affidavit in support of defendant's motion for a more
definite statement regarding the location of the alleged accident as referenced in plaintiff's |
complaint. [Plaintiffs complaint ts annexed here as Exhibit A].

3. Pursuant to the complaint, plaintiff alleges that Verizon "owned and/or
controlled a partial [sic] of property situated in the County of Onondaga at a disclosed
location known only to the defendants in the area of Syracuse, New York where it
undertook to perform construction work . . . ." [Exh. A, [5]. The complaint then refers to
this partial [sic] of property as "the aforementioned premises" and "the aforesaid
construction site," and notes that plaintiff was caused to suffer personal injuries at "the

aforementioned premises." [Exh. A, J] 6-7, 9-14]. The complaint offers no further

description whatsoever as to the address and/or location of the "premises" or the

 

 
 

Case 1:08-cv-05328-PKL Document10 Filed 08/13/2008 Page 2 of 13

description whatsoever as to the address and/or location of the "premises" or the
construction site where the subject accident allegedly occurred.

4, Plaintiff appears to be predicating Verizon's supposed liability on its
ownership, control and/or maintenance of the subject site/premises where the accident
allegedly occurred. Verizon, as the alleged owner, cannot reasonably be expected to
frame a responsive pleading where the premises and/or site have not been identified
beyond the fact that it is located in a particular County and "in the area" of a metropolitan
area the size of Syracuse, New York.

5, Allegations so vague and general in character make it unreasonable to
expect defendant to prepare a pleading that is responsive. In short, Verizon can not be
expected to answer allegations that it owned or controlled or maintained a particular partial
[sic] of property where such property is not identified. Plaintiff should be required to state
with some degree of particularity where it is that he was allegedly injured as such fact is,
undoubtedly, the crux of the entire lawsuit.

WHEREFORE, Verizon requests that the Court enter an order under Rule 12(e) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requiring that plaintiff make a more definite statement
of the allegations contained in Paragraphs 5, 6-7 and 9-14, solely with regard to the
location of the subject premises where plaintiff's alleged accident took place.
