v. >: FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT

PURSUANT TO E.R.C.P. 12(e)
VERIZON NEW YORK, INC. AND
MASTEC NORTH AMERICA, INC.

Defendants

 

RICHARD M. WINOGRAD, U'SQ., an attorney duly admitted to practice law before the
Courts of the State of New York, United States District Court and the Southern District of New
York, under the penalty of perjury, affirms the following:

1. lam a partner at Ginarte. O' Dwyer, Gonzalez & Winograd, L.L-P., attorneys for the
Plaintiff, Jorge Joya, in the above-captioned matter. I submit this Affirmation in opposition to
Verizon's Motion for a more definite Statement, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e).

2. This action arises out of an accident occurring on or about May 15, 2006, in which
the Plaintiff, a laborer for A&A Cable Contractors, sustained injuries when a chain or cable snapped
under tension striking him in the face resulting in severe injuries to the right eye.

3. Plaintiff filed this action based on Diversity of Citizenship against the entities he

Case 1:08-cv-05328-PKL Document12 Filed 08/29/2008 Page2of8

reasonably believed served as the owner and contractor for construction work being performed at
the time of his accident.

4. One of these two entities, Verizon New York, has filed a motion for more definite
statement pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(e) because Plaintiff has not pinpointed
the precise location of his accident in the complaint that has been filed.

5. This motion should be denied for three reasons:

a) Plaintiff has employed not only due diligence, but engaged in
extraordinary efforts in an attempt to identify the exact address where
the accident occurred and such efforts have been unsuccessful.

b) Further e`forts by Plaintiff to identify the exact address are not likely
to be successful without the cooperation of the named defendants.

2) It is anticipated that the defendants, who were in control of the
information about the projects it worked on, are in a far better
position `han Plaintiff in these circumstances to identify the location
of the accident, particularly now that they are in possession of all of
the materials plaintiff has produced concerning his investigation of
the accident.

6. Counsel was first retained by Plaintiff on November 20, 2006 in a personal
interview conducted with a Spanish traaslator, At that time Mr. Joya presented with the obvious
effects of an injury to his face and in pa'ticular his right eye that he related to an accident occurring
on May 15, 2006 in the Syracuse, New York area. At the time of the interview, Mr. Joya had in his

possession documentation from the Texas Mutual Insurance Company consisting of a letter dated

Page 2 of 8
Case 1:08-cv-05328-PKL Document12 Filed 08/29/2008 Page3of8

June 9, 2006, confirming what he had told us about his accident with respect to the date of same and
the name of his employer. (See Exhibit "1")

7. During the time of the interview, Mr. Joya, a resident of the State Maryland,
advised us that he was still receiving Workers Compensation benefits from the State of Texas where
his employer, A&A Cable Contractors was based.

8. Plaintiff further related tiat his employer had been hired by Verizon to install
piping under a driveway, which we understood to mean that lines for a phone system were being
installed. Apparently while pulling or a one inch diameter rope constructed of metal wire and
rubber, an effort was being made to move a pipe. The rope snapped and struck his face. Mr. Joya
was not wearing any protective goggles at this time.

9. During the course of this interview counsel ascertained the names and any phone
numbers of witnesses. There were threc witnesses, but Mr. Joya only knew partial names and only
one phone number. This law office corypleted the remainder of an intake for this type of case.

10. Immediately after the conclusion of the interview, a private investigator from
Trademark, Inc. by the name of Steve Ward was hired and directed to obtain statements of the
witnesses and to perform a thorough investigation about this accident.

11. As it relates to the issues on this motion he was specifically directed to obtain the
location of the accident and work permits.

12. On January 24, 2007, this office forwarded correspondence to Plaintiff's
employer, A&A Cable in Houston, Texzs asking for a complete copy of their records relating to our

client's employment. It was anticipated that with the production of that information, the exact

location of the accident would be apparent. (See Exhibit "2")

However, there was no immediate response to the letter of January 24, 2007 from the
employer, with the exception of a serics of letters beginning on July 5, 2007 from the Worker's
Compensation carrier, Texas Mutual Insurance Company, advising of the amount of payments that
have been made for medical treatment and temporary total disability. Such letters were dated July
5, 2007, September 11, 2007, November 27, 2007 and February 28, 2008.

13, On February 12, 2007, we received a written report from the investigator about his
investigation. We were informed that he appeared at the Syracuse Code Enforcement Office seeking
work permits and applications filed by Verizon during that year in the Syracuse, New York area.
The agent was advised there were eleven job sites that were possible sites and he then put in a
request for information about those sites. The investigator also reported on his contact with
O.S.H.A., in view of the serious nature of the injuries in the hope that an investigation might have
taken place. The O.S.H.A. representative at that time was unable to provide any assistance.

14. In a report dated February 28, 2007, the investigator indicated that he had, after
many attempts, finally spoken with a witness, Richard Hernandez, over the telephone, who advised
him that the location of the accident was 2695 Carpenter Road, Syracuse, New York. Mr. Hernandez
told our investigator that he was working with Plaintiff at the time of the accident and confirmed
essential details about it. However, Mr. Hernandez reported that instead of a machine, a pick up
truck was pulling a cable with a chain at the time of the accident. According to him, the chain broke
and struck Mr. Joya in the face.

15. Following up on Mr. Hernandez's information, the investigator appeared at the
Syracuse Code Enforcement Office and the Department of Buildings, asking for information about

the stated location. He was advised they would process his request.

Case 1:08-cv-05328-PKL Document12 Filed 08/29/2008 Page5of8

16. Mr. Ward also contacted O.S.H.A. again providing them with this location and the
O.S.H.A. representative responded that there was a report of a complaint of an incident at 8693
Carpenter Road rather than 9695 Carpenter Road. However, although there was a complaint taken
no action was taken by O.S.H.A. about it.

17. Mr. Ward received information about other potential witnesses and indicated that
he would continue working with following up the information about the location of accident and the
witnesses.

18. Ina letter dated April 12, 2007, we received another report from the investigator
advising that the Department of Buildin zs had no records regarding the street in question or any road
work being done on Carpenter Road. -lowever, the Department of Buildings cautioned that that
agency would only have records of roadl work being done.

19. In this report, the agent elso reported checking with the New York City Department
of Transportation for all road work, permits and applications. None were found. He similarly
checked with law enforcement throughout the area, but found no report of any incidents at or about
the time in question.

20. Efforts to reach other witresses were unsuccessful with reports from our investigator
varying that they either could not be reached or were uncooperative.

21. Plaintiff's counsel howe ver, continued to make telephone calls to the employer
seeking to verify the location of the acc dent. Finally in a fax dated November 14, 2007 from Amy
Solis of A&A Cable Contractors, Inc., \ve were advised that the closest location they could narrow
for the accident was the 8600 block of Carpenter Road in a place called Radisson, New York. She

also enclosed a report of injury and supplemental report of injury, which confirmed the essential

Page 5 of 8
Case 1:08-cv-05328-PKL Document12 Filed 08/29/2008 Page6of8

details of the accident. (See Exhibit "3)

None of this information was particularly useful since neither the first report of
injury or the supplemental report identified where the accident took place and we could find no
reference anywhere of any Township by the name of Radisson in the State of New York.

22. `Ina letter dated November 16, 2007, we received a follow up investigative report
from our investigator, at which time he confirmed that the town of Lysander was responsible for any
road work being done within the City of Syracuse. The agent appearing at the Town of Lysander
then submitted request for all records and permits for Verizon at or near the location of the loss
during the subject year. These efforts were totally negative. One permit was issued to Verizon near
the area of loss about two blocks away, but that permit was issued one month after the date of
accident and the work was reportedly o a relay tower. No records were found indicating that the
Plaintiff was injured at that location. The investigator reported that the witness he was speaking to,
Mr. Hernandez, was no longer responsi` e to his inquiries and that his efforts to contact the employer
were met with no cooperation. He concluded he found no police report on file, no permits within
the State of New York and none within either the City of Syracuse or the Town of Lysander.

23. Thereafter, your affiant continued with efforts to locate the site of the accident by
placing telephone calls to Jessie Salcedo of Texas Mutual Insurance Company, the individual who
had forwarded to us copies of his lien Ictter.

24. I do recall several conversations with Mr. Salcedo, at which time he indicated he
was unable to provide us with any further information. However, on April 9, 2008, pursuant to my

request, he did enclose copies of sub-contractor agreements, which contained information about the

terms ofa sub-contractor agreement between defendant Mastec and A&A Cable Contractors. Most

Page 6 of 8
Case 1:08-cv-05328-PKL Document12 Filed 08/29/2008 Page /7of8

importantly he attached as Schedule "1", a document which indicated that for this job the primary/
contractor owner was Verizon, the contractor Mastec North America and the sub-contractor A&A
Cable Contractors Inc. (See Exhibits 4-5).

25. The effective date on that contract was May 5, 2006 and the primary contract location
was Syracuse, New York. A job number of 61022 was referenced.

26. It was based on this last piece of information which specifically corroborated all the
essential information to identify the potential parties to any lawsuit that a decision was made to file
this action.

27. Plaintiff maintains that based on Exhibit "1" Verizon should be able to identify
various sites in the Syracuse, New Yori region where work of this nature was being performed on
May 15, 2006. Presumably the job nurber will be useful as well.

28. Plaintiff has used all reasonable means to identify the precise location of this
accident.

29. This information cannot be obtained without obtaining discovery from the
defendants in this case.

For all the foregoing reasons, it is respectfully requested that this Court enter an Order
denying the motion for a more definite statement and compelling the defendant to file an answer
within the time required by law.
