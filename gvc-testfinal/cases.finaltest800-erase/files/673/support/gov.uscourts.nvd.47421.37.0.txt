Plaintiff 1st Technology LLC, by and through its counsel of record HUTCHINSON &
STEFFEN, LLC, respectfully moves the Court for entry of an order granting it leave to file a
supplemental memorandum in further support of its opposition to Defendant Tiltware, LLC's
motion to dismiss for improper venue / motion for transfer of venue. In support of this motion,
1st Technology relies upon the pleadings and papers of record to date and further states:

1. ist Technology filed its Complaint for patent infringement on March 15, 2006,
alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,564,001 by Tiltware among other defendants. On
May 31, 2006, Tiltware filed its motion to dismiss for improper venue, or in the alternative, for
transfer of venue. 1st Technology filed its opposition to Tiltware's motion on June 19, 2006,
and Tiltware filed its reply thereto on July 3, 2006. The Court has not yet ruled on Tiltware's
motion.

2. Ist Technology has recently obtained additional evidence which further supports
Ist Technology's contentions that (1) the Court has personal jurisdiction over Tiltware, (2)
venue is proper in this judicial district, and (3) the facts do not warrant a transfer of venue to
the Central District of California. The additional material was distributed by Tiltware or its
agents during the 2006 World Series of Poker held in Las Vegas, Nevada during the months of
July and August. The referenced evidence is discussed in greater detail in 1st Technology's
supplemental memorandum, attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

3. Ist Technology was not aware of said evidence at the time of filing its
opposition memorandum on June 19, 2006.

4, lst Technology has also recently converted to a Nevada limited liability
company. Ist Technology's corporate presence in Nevada weigh against transferring venue to

the Central District of California.

5. ~ So that the record is more complete, 1st Technology seeks leave to file the

short supplemental memorandum attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

6. This motion is brought in the interests of justice and not for the purpose of
delay.
