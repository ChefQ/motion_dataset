PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO SERVE DEFENDANT
HEIDELBERG CEMENT, AG AND DEFENDANT UNNAMED TRUCKING COMPANIES

Plaintiffs, Lisa Lee-Bolton and Richard Bolton, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated, and Plaintiff Roy Geiersbach, on behalf of himself (collectively “Plaintiffs”),
by their attorney, hereby move this Court for an extension of time in which to serve process on
Defendant Heidelberg Cement, AG and the defendant unnamed trucking companies, and in
support thereof state:
1.

Defendant Koppers Inc. (“Koppers”), Beazer East, Inc. (“Beazer”), and Koppers

Holdings, Inc. (“Koppers Holdings”), joined by McClellan Logging, Inc. (“McClellan”),

1

Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM-GRJ Document 52 Filed 04/04/11 Page 2 of 6

removed this case to federal court on December 23, 2010. One hundred and twenty (120) days
from December 23, 2010 is April 22, 2011.
2.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) states:

(m) Time Limit of Service
If a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed, the court —
on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff — must dismiss the action
without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a
specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must
extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision (m) does not
apply to service in a foreign country under Rule 4(f) or 4(j)(1).
3.

The period of 120 days for serving process on a defendant not served prior to

removal begins to run on the date the case is removed and not on the date the action was
originally filed in state court. Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1137
(2002); Kimbrough v. City of Cocoa, 2006 WL 1643364, *1 (M.D. Fla. 2006); Ritts v. Dealers
Alliance Credit Corp., 989 F.Supp. 1475, 1478-79 (N.D. Ga. 1997); Eccles v. National
Semiconductor Corp., 10 F.Supp.2d 514, 519 (D.Md. 1998); Yaman v. D’Angelo, 206 F.Supp.2d
394, 401 (W.D.N.Y. 2002); Alber v. Illinois Dep. of Mental Health, 786 F.Supp. 1340, 1376
(N.D.Ill. 1992); Bruley v. Lincoln Property Co., N.C., Inc., 140 F.R.D. 452, 454 (D.Colo. 1991);
Motsinger v. Flynt, 119 F.R.D. 373, 377 (M.D.N.C. 1988).
4.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) explicitly states Rule 4(f) service in a foreign country is not

subject to the 120 day limit from Rule 4(m). Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). Courts and commentators
have found that the 120-day service period does not apply to service in a foreign county, and the
trend is to find that the 120 day limit does not apply even if the plaintiff makes no attempt to
serve within the period. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d § 1134

2

Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM-GRJ Document 52 Filed 04/04/11 Page 3 of 6

(2001 Supp.); In re S1 Corp. Securities Litigation, 173 F.Supp.2d 1334, 1343 (N.D. Ga. 2001);
Lucas v. Natoli, 936 F.2d 432, 432-33 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1073 (1992)
(holding that the plain language of Rule 4(j) [the predecessor to Rule 4(m)] made the 120-day
service provision inapplicable to service in a foreign country); Cargill Ferrous Intern. v. M/V
Elikon, 154 F.R.D. 193, 195-96 (N.D. Ill. 1994).
5.

Defendant Heidelberg Cement is a foreign corporation with its principal place of

business in Germany. Thus, as a foreign corporation, Defendant Heidelberg Cement must be
served under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(f) and 4(h)(2). The exception to the 120-day rule for foreign
service in Rule 4(m) applies equally to corporations. In re Imperial Home Decor Group, Inc.,
294 B.R. 607, 609 (Bkrtcy.D.Del. 2003). Plaintiff is in the process of researching service of
Heidelberg Cement in Germany pursuant to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial
or Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters (“Hague Service Convention”). In
Germany, foreign service must be effected through the Central Authority, and Plaintiffs must first
have the Complaint translated into German.
6.

Though the authority cited in paragraph 4 is clear that the 120-day limit does not

apply to service in a foreign county, some courts have held that the foreign service exemption
from the 120 day time period in Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) is conditioned upon good faith attempts to
serve the defendant within 120 days. See Maale v. Francis, 258 F.R.D. 533, 535 (S.D. Fla.
2009). Thus, out of an abundance of caution, Plaintiffs file this motion for an extension of time
regarding Heidelberg Cement.
7.

The 120-day period from Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), starting from the date of removal

3

Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM-GRJ Document 52 Filed 04/04/11 Page 4 of 6

in a case removed to federal court, also applies to service on John Doe defendants, but where a
plaintiff has not identified or served a John Doe defendant within the period, the proper remedy
is for the court to set a date before which the plaintiff must serve the John Doe defendants. See
cases and commentary from ¶ 3, supra; see, e.g., Pete’s Towing Co. v. City of Tampa, Fla., 2008
WL 4791821, *15 (M.D.Fla. 2008); see also Aviles v. Village of Bedford Park, 160 F.R.D. 565,
567-68 (N.D.Ill. 1995).
8.

Plaintiffs’ Motion to Remand, filed February 3, 2011, remains pending in this

Court. Regarding Heidelberg Cement, it would not make sense for Plaintiffs to cause a federal
summons to issue, and begin the process of serving Heidelberg Cement with that summons, only
to have the case remanded to state court while service was still pending. Heidelberg Cement may
then appear in federal court after the case has been remanded to state court, which could have
adverse consequences for Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are prepared to move forward with good faith
efforts to serve Heidelberg Cement, however, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that it would be more
efficient to grant Plaintiffs twenty-one (21) days from the Court’s ruling on the Motion to
Remand in which to have the summons for Heidelberg Cement issued in federal court (if the
Court denies the Motion to Remand), and to grant Plaintiffs sixty (60) days after issuance of the
summons to send the Request for Service to the appropriate German Central Authority pursuant
to the Hague Service Convention, art. 3, 5.
9.

Regarding the unnamed trucking companies, after a diligent search, Plaintiffs

have not been able to identify any of those John Doe defendants. The other Defendants likely
have the information necessary for Plaintiffs to identify and serve the unnamed trucking
companies. Plaintiffs will seek to have such information disclosed during discovery, which has
4

Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM-GRJ Document 52 Filed 04/04/11 Page 5 of 6

not yet commenced. Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant them ninety (90) days
after the commencement of the discovery period (as determined by any subsequent scheduling
order) in which to identify and serve any of the unnamed trucking companies.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter an order:
A)

Granting Plaintiffs twenty-one (21) days from the date of any Order entered by the

Court denying Plaintiffs’ Motion to Remand in which to have the summons for Heidelberg
Cement issued in federal court;
B)

Granting Plaintiffs sixty (60) days after the issuance of the summons for

Heidelberg Cement to send the Request for Service to the appropriate German Central Authority;
C)

Granting Plaintiffs ninety (90) days after the commencement of the discovery

period, as determined by subsequent scheduling order, in which to identify and serve the
unnamed trucking companies; and
D)

Granting any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.
CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE

Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, the undersigned hereby certifies that counsel for Plaintiffs has
conferred with counsel for Defendants Koppers Inc., Beazer East, Inc., and Koppers Holdings,
Inc., and with counsel for McClellan Logging, Inc. in a good faith attempt to resolve by
agreement the issues raised in the foregoing motion. Koppers, Beazer and Koppers Holdings do
not have a position on this motion because they believe that only Heidelberg Cement and the
unnamed trucking companies would have standing to object. McClellan Logging objects to this
motion.
