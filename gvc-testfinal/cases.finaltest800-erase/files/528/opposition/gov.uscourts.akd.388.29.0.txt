OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR ORAL ARGUMENT
Plaintiff opposes defendant's motion for oral argument on method calculation.
The question of whether he used the state rate calculation pursuant to 8 AAC
15.100 or the Federal law is a simple, straight forward and obvious question of law. The
use of The Court's resources in this regard would appear to be unnecessary to plaintiff.
Additionally, plaintiff and his counsel likely would travel to the hearing, which
presumably would be held in Anchorage. Significant resources would need to be used

to such end. Counsel would travel from Fairbanks and plaintiff currently lives in Idaho.
Plaintiff leaves to The Court discretion as to whether or not The Court will find
oral argument on defendant's method calculation motion helpful.

If The Court thinks

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of August, 2006 at Fairbanks, Alaska.
