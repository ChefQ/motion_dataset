In a companion case to this one, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
held that the Safety Specialist position was a non-exempt position
and, thus, subject to overtime. See Zuber v. APC Natchiq, Inc., 144
th
Fed. Appx. 657 (9 Cir. 2005). Defendant concedes that plaintiff is
entitled to overtime for work performed in excess of 40 hours while
employed as a Safety Specialist. It is defendant’s position, however,
that he is entitled to such compensation only for those claims not
barred by the two-year statute of limitations under the FLSA and AWHA.
Defendant has paid plaintiff overtime damages consistent with its
position in this motion and following the FLSA regulations. Defendant

POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

If Gilbert Is Entitled to Overtime, the FLSA Method of
Calculating the Regular Rate of Pay and Overtime Applies
Because the AWHA Does Not Define the Method of Calculating
Overtime For Day Rate Employees.
Gilbert brings this action for overtime damages under both

the FLSA and AWHA.

(1st Cir. 1995); Alaska Indus. v. Musarra, 602 P.2d 1240, 1246
(Alaska 1979)).

Where the AWHA is silent, it is required that

one utilize the FLSA to calculate overtime.

See AS 23.10.145

(providing that “terms used in [the Act] shall be defined as
they are defined in the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of

defined in AHWA). Neither the AWHA, nor the interpretive state
regulations, define the method of calculating the regular rate
of pay or overtime for an employee paid a day rate. The FLSA,
however, does define how to calculate overtime where day rates
are paid.

Thus, one would look to the FLSA to define the

calculation.
Further, the state regulations expressly instruct that the
AWHA is inapplicable where an employee is paid other than hourly
or by salary.

In the case at hand, Gilbert was paid a day rate;

he was not paid hourly or a salary.

adopted the methodology offered by APC, stating that it was the
most accurate method of calculation.

See Exhibit A, Transcript

of Proceedings, 4-5; see also Exhibit B (demonstrating day rate
compensation of plaintiffs and method of calculating overtime
per “Greisen report” adopted by court). 2

The method chosen by

the Watkins court was to apply the FLSA day rate calculation.
See id.

The Watkins court stated that the adopted calculation

for day rate workers (the “Greisen report”) was “consistent with
the CFR approach to analyzing piece work payment found at 29
C.F.R. § 778.111(a).”

The court noted that this CFR section

pertaining to pieceworkers is specifically incorporated at 8 AAC
15.100(b)(1).

The Federal calculation for pieceworkers is as

follows:
. . . [w]hen an employee is employed on a piecerate basis, his regular hourly rate of pay is
computed by adding together his total earnings for
the workweek from piece rates and all other
sources. . . .
This sum is then divided by the
number of hours worked in the week for which such
compensation was paid, to yield the pieceworker’s
“regular rate” for that week.
For his overtime
work the piece-worker is entitled to be paid, in
addition to his total weekly earnings at this
regular
rate
for
all
hours
worked,
a
sum
equivalent to one-half his regular rate of pay
multiplied by the number of hours worked in excess
of 40 in the week.

Thus, there can be no argument

that the calculation itself is unlawful, either for pieceworkers

This court should apply the FLSA calculation for day rate
employees because the AWHA is silent on the issue; whereas, the
FLSA expressly provides for the method of calculating overtime
in such circumstances. Further, the AWHA limits its calculation
method to only hourly or salaried employees. APC, therefore,
requests that the court enter an order that the FLSA calculation
for day rates applies in this case.

Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 778.112, Overtime Is Calculated by
Totaling All Day Rate Sums Received in the Workweek,

§ 778.112 applied to the employees where employees were paid a
day-rate, paid regardless of the number of hours worked in a
day, and were paid only for the number of days worked in a
week).
By way of example, if an employee is paid a flat day-rate
of $100, works 7 days per week, and a total of 50 hours during
that workweek, the employee’s regular rate for that workweek
would

be

calculated

as

follows:

$100

constitutes $700 per work week; $700 divided by 50 hours equals
$14.

Thus, the employee’s regular rate of pay for that week is

$14 per hour.

Accordingly, the employee’s overtime damages are

calculated as follows:

calculation pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 778.112 is the applicable
method of calculating overtime in this case.
IV.

CONCLUSION

The AWHA is completely silent on the method of calculating
overtime where an employee is paid a day rate. It is, therefore,
proper to look to the FLSA, which expressly provides the correct
calculation.

The Federal calculation has been approved by the

Alaska legislature and should be the rule of law in this case.
APC, therefore, requests that this court enter an order that the
FLSA calculation pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 778.112 is the method
of calculating overtime that will be used in this case.
