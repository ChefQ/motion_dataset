STATEMENT OF ISSUES
1.

Whether F-Star’s timely filed non-retained expert witness designations are sufficient to
comply with F. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(C).

2.

If F-Star’s non-retained expert witness designations are insufficient, whether F-Star should
be allowed to supplement them, rather than suffer the harsh sanction of altogether striking
them.

Case 3:10-cv-00102-KC Document 33 Filed 04/21/11 Page 4 of 20

Defendant and Counterclaimant F-Star Property Management, Inc. (“F-Star”) responds to
the motion by Plaintiff and Counter-Defendant Continental Casualty Company (“CNA”) seeking
to strike F-Star’s non-retained expert designations and says:
F-STAR’S EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSE
1.

In support of this response, F-Star relies upon:
a.

F-Star’s designation of testifying experts with respect to claims for affirmative
relief, dated March 8, 2011 [Dkt. #18];

b.

F-Star’s supplemental designation of testifying experts, dated April 20, 2011
[Dkt. #32]; and

c.

CNA’s notices to depose F-Star’s non-retained experts Rick Armendariz, Tim
McAuley, Rick Given and Henry Ng 1.
CNA’S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED

2.

Discovery is scheduled to close in this case on May 27, 2011.

3.

On April 19 and 20, 2011, by agreement, without subpoena served upon the witnesses

and pursuant to the notices attached as Exhibit “1”, CNA took the videotaped oral depositions of
F-Star’s non-retained experts Rick Armendariz, Tim McAuley, Rick Given and Henry Ng.
Additional documents responsive to such notices and in the possession of the deponents were
produced by F-Star prior to the depositions of Rick Armendariz, Tim McAuley and Rick Given,
and CNA’s counsel took full depositions of all four (4) witnesses, unimpeded by a single
objection from F-Star’s counsel and unhampered in the scope of questions which CNA’s counsel
chose to ask. During those depositions, none of those witnesses attempted to extend the scope of
their testimony beyond the information provided in their designations.
1

Copies of these notices are attached to this response collectively as Exhibit “1”.

4.

The depositions of F-Star’s other non-retained expert witnesses, which have been

requested by CNA to date, have been scheduled by agreement between counsel for the parties.
Those depositions are scheduled for dates during the weeks of May 2, 2011 and May 9, 2011, in
Phoenix, Arizona and in El Paso, Texas. F-Star anticipates that CNA’s counsel will once more
take full depositions of those witnesses, and that none of those witnesses will attempt to extend
the scope of their testimony beyond the information provided in their designations. To the extent
that those witnesses have additional documents responsive to any notices for their depositions
that CNA may serve, F-Star will endeavor to obtain and produce those documents in advance of
those depositions, too, just as it did with the ones already taken.
5.

Without citing a single authority in support of its argument, without seeking any prior

relief or ruling from this Court on the issue of sufficiency of F-Star’s non-retained expert witness
designations, and without alleging or showing any harm or prejudice it has suffered as a result of
such alleged deficiencies, CNA seeks to altogether strike F-Star’s non-retained expert witness
designations. By doing so, CNA seeks to leave F-Star unable to defend the claims asserted
against it by CNA, which are an unprecedented 2, pre-emptive effort to defeat F-Star’s rights to
recover under its policy of insurance.

2

See Exhibits 1 and 2 to F-Star’s response in opposition to CNA’s motion for partial
summary on time element losses. [Dkt. #30-1].

6.

F-Star has made a good faith effort to comply with the rules requiring the designation of

non-retained experts, which are less rigid that the rules for retained experts, and deservedly so.
F-Star does not have control over these witnesses, and is limited in some instances by the amount
of information and documents it can obtain from these witnesses 3. As shown by their reports,
none of them had any agreement with F-Star to be compensated for giving their opinions. 4
7.

F-Star believes that its non-retained expert designations comply with the rules, and F-Star

has not made any effort to conceal any information from CNA in such designations, or to delay
or interfere with CNA’s efforts to depose those witnesses. To the extent that the Court finds that
such designations are in any manner deficient, instead of summarily striking those designations
in this suit filed against F-Star by its own insurer, F-Star requests leave of this Court for the
opportunity to promptly cure whatever deficiencies the Court may determine to exist.

3

As an example, the videotaped oral deposition of F-Star non-retained expert Martin
Elmquist was scheduled to be taken by CNA by agreement and notice on April 20, 2011. Mr.
Elmquist had provided a written report of his opinions, dated March 8, 2011, which had been
disclosed to CNA’s counsel. The morning of that deposition, Mr. Elmquist’s employer called FStar’s counsel and refused to allow Mr. Elmquist to be produced for deposition, contending that
he had not been properly served with a subpoena by CNA compelling the witness to appear. FStar’s counsel had agreed to produce such witness voluntarily, and the witness himself had
agreed to appear without a subpoena.

4

At his April 20, 2011 deposition, Henry Ng testified that he intended to charge F-Star for
his time in giving his deposition, but admitted that he had no agreement with F-Star allowing
him to do so.
