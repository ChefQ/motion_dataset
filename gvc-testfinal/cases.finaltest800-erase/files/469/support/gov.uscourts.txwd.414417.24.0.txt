CIVIL ACTION NO. EP-10-CV-00102-KC

MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT’S NON-RETAINED EXPERT DESIGNATIONS
Continental Casualty Company files this Motion to Strike Defendant’s Non-Retained
Expert Designations and in support would show as follows:
I. INTRODUCTION
This case involves an insurance coverage dispute arising from two claims made by F-Star
Property Management, Inc. on a property insurance policy issued by Continental Casualty
Company – a wind claim and a hail claim.
F-Star’s non-retained expert designations should be struck as deficient because they fail
to comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(ii). In
particular, F-Star’s non-retained expert designations fail to provide a summary of the facts and
opinions to which the experts are expected to testify.
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On March 8, 2011, F-Star filed its Designation of Testifying Experts with Respect to
Claims for Affirmative Relief [Doc. 18] with the Court. On March 14, 2011, Continental’s
counsel sent a letter to F-Star’s counsel requesting that F-Star amend its disclosures to remedy
various deficiencies in its disclosures. A true and correct copy of that letter is attached as

Exhibit A. In that letter, Continental specifically requested that F-Star supplement its expert
designations as follows:
[W]e note that F-Star did not provide reports for the following
witnesses: W. Martin Yung; Art Long; Jerry C. Ayoub; Edna
Lopez; B. Lanny Cowart; Jeff Stone; and Brian Watson.
Assuming that all of these witnesses are, in fact, non-retained
experts, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(C)(ii) requires
that “a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is
expected to testify” be provided. Although F-Star may have
complied with Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(i) which requires disclosure of the
subject matter upon which the witness is expected to testify, F-Star
failed to provide the facts and opinions meet the requirements of
Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(ii). Accordingly, Continental requests that F-Star
immediately supplement its Designations to comply with
requirements of Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(ii).
On March 23, 2011, Continental’s counsel again wrote to F-Star’s counsel asking that
F-Star correct the deficiencies in its Designations. A true and correct copy of that email is
attached hereto as Exhibit B.
That same day, F-Star served its Designation of Testifying Experts with Respect to
Resisting Claims for Affirmative Relief.

A true and correct copy of F-Star’s rebuttal

designations are attached as Exhibit C. These designations were actually sent a day late because
the parties had agreed on a March 22, 2011 deadline to designate rebuttal experts.
On March 25, 2011, Continental’s counsel sent an email to F-Star’s counsel noting that
F-Star’s designation of Paul Shepherd was similarly deficient. A true and correct copy of that
email is attached as Exhibit D.
On April 4, 2011, Continental’s counsel again requested that F-Star supplement its
designations. A true and correct copy of that email is attached as Exhibit E. F-Star’s counsel did
not respond.
Despite Continental’s numerous requests for F-Star to supplement its designation of its
non-retained experts, F-Star has yet to do so.

III. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(C) governs what a party must include in its
designations of non-retained expert witnesses as follows:
(C) Witnesses Who Do Not Provide a Written Report. Unless
otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, if the witness is
not required to provide a written report, this disclosure must
state:
(i)

the subject matter on which the witness is expected to
present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702,
703, or 705; and

(ii) a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness
is expected to testify.
In the present case, F-Star’s non-retained expert designations simply identifies various
topics upon which the witnesses are expected to testify, F-Star failed to provide a “summary of
the facts and opinions” upon which the witness is expected to testify. For example, F-Star’s
Designation of Brian Watson from Commercial Roofing reads as follows:
Mr. Watson, a member of management at Commercial Roofing, is
expected to present opinion testimony on the reasonableness and
necessity of the cost of repair and replacement of the damaged
roofs of the properties, the condition of the properties before and
after the losses, the repairs and replacements made to date, the
necessary repairs and replacements not yet made, the unsuitability
of use of inexperienced contractors to perform repairs and
replacements, and the ongoing damages and increase in
replacement and repair costs as a result of CNA’s refusal to pay
F-Star’s claims.
This designation only provides the topics upon which Mr. Watson may testify. The
designation fails to provide a summary of the facts Mr. Watson is going to offer. Likewise, the
designation does not summarize any of the opinions that Mr. Watson will offer. All of F-Star’s
other non-retained expert designations - W. Martin Yung; Art Long; Jerry C. Ayoub; Edna
Lopez; B. Lanny Cowart; Jeff Stone; and Paul Shepherd - suffer from the same deficiency.

Accordingly, because the designations fail to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
26(a)(2)(C) and F-Star has refused to supplement its designations despite Continental’s repeated
requests, Continental requests that such designations be struck by the Court.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Continental requests that the Court strike F-Star’s
designations of W. Martin Yung; Art Long; Jerry C. Ayoub; Edna Lopez; B. Lanny Cowart; Jeff
Stone; Brian Wilson; and Paul Shepherd as testifying experts in this litigation and bar such
witnesses from offering opinion testimony at trial. Continental further requests any and all
further relief to which it is entitled.

CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE
As discussed above, Continental’s counsel repeatedly requested F-Star to supplement its
expert designations. Furthermore, on April 5, 2011, I left a detailed voicemail for Randy Lee,
counsel for F-Star, regarding this motion. The parties are attempting to schedule depositions of
the various designated experts. Accordingly, Continental believes it must file this motion as
soon as possible. In light of F-Star’s counsel’s failure to respond to Continental’s prior requests,
it is believed F-Star opposes this Motion.
