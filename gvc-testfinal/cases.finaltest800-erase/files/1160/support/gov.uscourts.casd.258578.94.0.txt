TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on July 14, 2008, at 10:30 a.m., or as soon thereafter as
the matter may be heard, in Courtroom 13 of the above-entitled Court, located at 880 Front
Street, No. 4290, San Diego, California 92101, defendant California Travel and Tourism
Commission ("CTTC") will, and hereby does, move the Court for an order dismissing with
prejudice Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may
be granted.

This motion is made on the basis that CTTC is entitled to immunity from antitrust liability
for any acts complained of in the First Amended Complaint under the state action immunity
doctrine. Alternatively, the allegations in the First Amended Complaint fail to satisfy the
pleading standard in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, _-~ U.S. -_, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007).

CTTC moves to dismiss the fourth claim, alleging violations of the Bagley-Keene Open
Meeting Act for lack of standing, and for lack of jurisdiction since the fourth claim is not
transactionally related to the antitrust claims over which the Court has original jurisdiction.
CTTC also moves to dismiss the Bagley-Keene Act claim because the alleged violations are
time-barred, and on comity principles, as this is an issue best left for the California state courts,
or better yet, the California Legislature.

This motion is based upon this Notice, the accompanying Memorandum of Points and
Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss, the pleadings and papers filed in this action, and
any further evidence, testimony, or argument as may be presented at oral argument on this

matter.
