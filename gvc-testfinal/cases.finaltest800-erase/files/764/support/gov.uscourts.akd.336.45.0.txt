Motion to Accept Late Filing and Motion to Reconsider

Comes now, Donald Louis Hymes (Hymes), without Assistance of
Counsel, domiciled in the territorial boundaries of Alaska
with special and restricted appearance, does proffer this
Motion to Accept Late Filing and Motion to Reconsider.

As Judge Beistline's ORDER of January 12, 2006 did not
arrive in the Post in Fairbanks until after the five (5)

days had already expired pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(1),

Oui act
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document45 ~~ Filed 01/23/2006 Page2of5

denying Hymes Due Process of Law.

Therefore,

First, Hymes does Motion this court to accept said late
filing. Impotentia excusat legem.

Second, from the ORDER at Docket 40, Judge Beistline
did, in said ORDER, request from Hymes, to wit: "The Court
requests supplemental briefing concerning whether the
Defendant filed any returns and the relevant law for that
discussion." [Emphasis added]

Hymes responded, as recorded in Docket 42, by
requesting a ruling of the Law and to which Return Judge
Beistline was requesting information, by supplying the
applicable (relevant) Law to which Judge Beistline responded
in the ORDER at Docket 42, to wit: "Hymes' Motion to Clarify
is DENIED because it concerns the tax forms applicable to
him and is without relevance to the Motions to Dismiss or
Motion to strike." [Emphasis added]

So that Hymes understands said ORDER, therefore it is
HELD by this Court that all forms in Hymes' Motion to
Clarify have application to Hymes and also that all relevant
law provided by Hymes is correct; and,

And further, said "Court" at Docket 40, arises under
Article III of the Constitution of the United States for all

Cases in Law and Equity under the authority of the United
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document45 ~ Filed 01/23/2006 Page 3of5

States exercising the judicial Power of the United States;
and,

And further, Judge Beistline has entered the Office in
said District Court of the United States as a judicial
Officer of the United States arising under the appointment
of the President of the United States in Article II section
2 with a Civil Commission under the President's signature
under the seal of the United States by the Secretary of the
State of the United States on file as a public Record with
the approval of the Congress of the United States of America
assembled; and,

And further, said Judge Beistline has a sworn and
subscribed Oath of Office as an Officer of the United
States, arising under Article VI of the Constitution of the
United States, the Law of the United States in 1 Stat 23,
and the Law of the United States in 1 Stat 76 of the
Judiciary Act of 1789 Section 8 as lawfully amended.

Third, in Judge Beistline's ORDER at Docket 40 page 4,
to wit: "However, the United States of America does have
constitutionally-granted powers and has properly alleged
offenses against the Defendants. The Court does not
recognize a distinction between the `United States of
America' and the `United States.'"

Therefore, so that Hymes understands said ORDER in

Docket 40 with the same Court as defined supra., it is HELD
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document45 ~- Filed 01/23/2006 Page 4of5

by said Court that the "THE UNITED STaTES OF AMERICA" in the
Articles of Confederation is the same as the "UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA" and the "United States of America" in this
instant Case; and,

And further, that the "United States" in the
"Constitution of the United States" is the same "United
States" HELD by this Court in this instant Case; and,

And further, that the "United States" in the
"Constitution of the United States" and "THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA" in the Articles of Confederation are exactly the
same; and,

And further, this same "United States of America" has
constitutionally-granted powers, which are not disclosed,
arising under the "Constitution of the United States."

Are these constitutionally-granted powers arising under
the "Constitution of the United States" or some other
constitution, and as Hymes is very unclear on said HOLDING
by the "Court."; and,

And further, or is this purported constitutional power
under the "Constitution of the United States of America",
wherein the status of the people is as a "citizen of the
United States" wherein Congress has plenary power as in the
territories and possessions and all of the said "citizens of
the United States" have a Social Security Number with no

vested rights trapped to receive a purported gratuity i.e.
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document45 ~~ Filed 01/23/2006 Page5of5

benefit as "rights created against the United State for

Individuals"?

Hymes DENIES said ORDER in total and Motions the
"Court" for a finding of fact and conclusions of Law so that

Hymes can understand said issues HELD by the "Court."
