BACKGROUND
The United States brought this action to reduce tax
assessments against defendant Donald L. Hymes to judgment and to
foreclose federal tax liens against a parcel of real property
held by nominees or alter egos of Donald L. Hymes.
On or about October 1, 2005, defendants Donald L. Hymes and
Rita M. Hymes, apparently both individually and in her capacity
as a trustee of defendant Sunshine Trust, filed essentially
identical motions to dismiss this case.

On or about October 5,

2005, defendants Charla Hymes (also known as Charla Hymes
Rayburn) and Aurora Trust, represented by Charla Hymes, filed
motions to dismiss that were almost identical to those filed by
the other defendants.
The United States submitted a response noting that the
arguments in defendants’ motions lacked merit.

The Court entered

an order requesting additional briefing on whether defendant
Donald L. Hymes filed returns for the years at issue in this
case.

The United States submitted a supplemental response, and

the defendants submitted a document styled a “motion to clarify”
that restated their arguments regarding the issue.

Ultimately,

the Court granted the United States’ motion in an order dated
January 12, 2006.
On January 23, 2006, defendant Donald Hymes filed a motion
to accept a late filing and for reconsideration of the order

dated January 12, 2006.
DISCUSSION
The Court should deny the motion for reconsideration for two
reasons.
First, defendant has presented no arguments whatsoever in
favor of reconsideration.

He simply requests rulings from the

Court on a variety of issues, such as a ruling that “all forms in
Hymes’ Motion to Clarify have application to Hymes” and that “the
‘United States’ in the ‘Constitution of the United States’ and
‘THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA’ in the Articles of Confederation
are exactly the same.”

Defendant’s motion at 2, 4 (emphasis and

quotations in original).

Defendant does not appear to challenge

any of the Court’s conclusions.
Second, to the extent defendant does challenge those
conclusions, he has failed to raise any legitimate arguments in
support of his challenge.

A party is not entitled to

reconsideration of an order unless it can demonstrate an
intervening change the law controlling the order, newly
discovered evidence, or the need to correct clear error or
prevent manifest injustice.

School Dist. No. II, Multnomah

County, Oregon v. AC and S, Inc., 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir.
1993).
Here, defendant has failed to do so.

Defendant merely

states a variety of propositions with no legal or factual support
-3-

whatsoever.
Further, the arguments advanced are frivolous as well as
unsupported.

Defendant attempts to rely on semantic distinctions

between “the United States” and “the United States of America,”
challenges the scope of the Court’s authority, and argues the
meaning of the “Constitution of the United States,” among other
peculiar assertions.

Defendant’s motion, passim.

Similar

attempts to escape the tax laws have been rejected repeatedly by
numerous courts.

See, e.g., Wilcox v. Commissioner, 848 F.2d

1007, 1008 (9th Cir. 1988); Olsen v. United States, 760 F.2d
1003, 1005 (9th Cir. 1985); Lonsdale v. United States, 919 F.2d
1440, 1445, 1448 (10th Cir. 1990); Crain v. Commissioner, 737
F.2d 1417, 1417 (5th Cir. 1984).

This Court should reject those

arguments as well and deny the motion for reconsideration.
