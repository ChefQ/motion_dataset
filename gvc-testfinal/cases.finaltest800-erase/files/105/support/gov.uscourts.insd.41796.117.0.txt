DEFENDANT MICHAEL HARRISON’S MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING
DISCLOSURE AND IMPOSING COSTS AND FEES
______________________________________________________________________________
Pursuant to Rule 16(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendant Michael
Harrison (“Harrison”), by and through undersigned counsel, moves this Court to issue any just
orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, for Plaintiff Malibu Media, LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) failure to obey the Court’s Scheduling
Order of July 9, 2013 (“Scheduling Order”); to enter an Order compelling Plaintiff to
immediately disclose all materials as required by paragraphs B and C of the Scheduling Order;
imposing costs and fees and requiring Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to obey
the Scheduling Order; further admonishing Plaintiff that continued noncompliance with this
Court’s Scheduling Order or other discovery orders will result in the imposition of harsher
sanctions and penalties; and, setting a hearing to determine Plaintiff’s level of culpability for the
purpose of imposing appropriate sanctions.

B.
No later than July 26, 2013 – Each party must give the other parties copies of all
documents, computer files and other electronic data that the party has that it may use to
prove its case [Dkt. 110 at 1, ¶ B].
As of the filing of this Motion, Plaintiff has only minimally and partially complied with
paragraph C of the Scheduling Order, which provides:
C.
No later than July 26, 2013 – The Plaintiff must give the Defendant (s) a written
estimate of how much money the Plaintiff claims he is entitled to for any injuries or
damages the Plaintiff claims to have suffered. At that time, the Plaintiff must also give
the Defendant (s) all non-privileged documents that support that estimate, including those
that might prove the nature and the extent of the Plaintiff’s injury [Dkt. 110 at 1, ¶ C].
On July 30, 2013, Plaintiff only provided Harrison with a written damages estimate
stating that Plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages ranging from $750 to $150,000 but
believes it is entitled to an award of $150,000.
As of the filing of this Motion, Plaintiff has not moved for or obtained an order for an
extension of time to fully and completely comply with the Scheduling Order, and Plaintiff has
not contacted or attempted to communicate with Harrison regarding its compliance, or lack
thereof, with the Scheduling Order.
This Court should issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule
37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for Plaintiff’s failure to obey the
Court’s Scheduling Order, and enter an Order:

	  

(i)

Requiring Plaintiff to immediately comply fully and completely with paragraphs
B and C of the Scheduling Order;

(ii)

Requiring Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to obey the
Scheduling Order;

(iii)

Further admonishing Plaintiff that continued noncompliance with this Court’s
Scheduling Order or other discovery orders will result in the imposition of harsher
sanctions and penalties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(1)(C) and (f)(1)(2); See Sweat v.
Peabody Coal Co., 94 F.3d 301, 306 (7th Cir. 1996) (explaining that a district

Order granting his Motion for Order Compelling Disclosure and Imposing Costs and Fees and
issuing any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii) of the Federal

requiring Plaintiff to immediately comply fully and completely with paragraphs B and C of the
Scheduling Order; requiring Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to obey the
Scheduling Order; further admonishing Plaintiff that continued noncompliance with this Court’s
Scheduling Order or other discovery orders will result in the imposition of harsher sanctions and
penalties; and, setting a hearing to determine Plaintiff’s level of culpability for the purpose of
