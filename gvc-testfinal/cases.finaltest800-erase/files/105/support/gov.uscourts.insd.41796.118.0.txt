DEFENDANT MICHAEL HARRISON’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
FOR ORDER COMPELLING DISCLOSURE AND IMPOSING COSTS AND FEES
______________________________________________________________________________
Pursuant to Rule 16(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendant Michael
Harrison (“Harrison”), by and through undersigned counsel, moves this Court to issue any just
orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, for Plaintiff Malibu Media, LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) failure to obey the Court’s Scheduling
Order of July 9, 2013 (“Scheduling Order”); to enter an Order compelling Plaintiff to
immediately disclose all materials as required by paragraphs B and C of the Scheduling Order;
imposing costs and fees and requiring Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to obey
the Scheduling Order; and, further admonishing Plaintiff that continued noncompliance with this
Court’s Scheduling Order or other discovery orders will result in the imposition of harsher
sanctions and penalties. Harrison respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of said
Motion.

This Court should grant Harrison’s Motion for Order Compelling Disclosure and
Imposing Costs and Fees and the relief requested therein for the reasons set forth more fully
below.
I.

LEGAL STANDARD.
Pursuant to Rule 16(f)(1)(C), a court should issue any just orders, including those

authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, if a party fails
to obey a scheduling order. Barring substantial justification, a court must order the disobedient
party, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by
the party’s failure to obey the order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(2) and 37(b)(2)(C).
A party’s failure is substantially justified only when “there is a genuine dispute, or if
reasonable people could differ as to the appropriateness of the contested action.” Rutherford
Controls Int’l Corp. v. Alarm Controls Corp., et. al., No. 3:08CV369, 2 (E.D. VA. Nov. 17,
2009) (quoting Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988)). A misunderstanding of the law
or the fact that the opposing party could have obtained the materials through its own efforts does
not equate to substantial justification. See Musser v. Gentiva Health Services, 356 F.3d 751 (7th
Cir. 2004) (citing Doe v. Johnson, 52 F.3d 1448, 1464 (7th Cir. 1995)).
II.

ANALYSIS.
The Scheduling Order required Plaintiff to give Harrison:

	  

(i)

Copies of all documents, computer files, and other electronic data Plaintiff has
that it may use to prove its case by no later than July 26, 2013 [Dkt. 110 at 1, ¶
B]; and,

(ii)

A written damages estimate and all non-privileged documents supporting
Plaintiff’s damages estimate, including those that might prove the nature and
extent of Plaintiff’s injury by no later than July 26, 2013 [Dkt. 110 at 1, ¶ C].

A.
PLAINTIFF FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PARAGRAPH B OF THE SCHEDULING
ORDER AND PLAINTIFF SHOULD HAVE COPIES OF ALL DOCUMENTS, COMPUTER
FILES, AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA IT MAY USE TO PROVE ITS CLAIMS AGAINST
HARRISON IN ITS POSSESSION, CUSTODY, OR CONTROL.
Plaintiff has not obeyed the Scheduling Order because, as of the filing of this Motion,
Plaintiff has totally failed to comply with paragraph B of the Scheduling Order. Plaintiff has not
given Harrison copies of any documents, computer files, or other electronic data Plaintiff has that
it may use to prove its case.
The allegations in Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint (“Complaint”) expressly refer to
the following documents, computer files, and other electronic data that Plaintiff should have in
its possession, custody, or control:
(i)

Subpoena responses from the ISPs for John Does 3 and 9, Pl. Compl. ¶ 5;

(ii)

The motion picture entitled “Pretty Back Door Baby” for United States Copyright
Registration Number PA0001789427, Pl. Compl. ¶ 16;

(iii)

IPP, Limited (“IPP”) evidence logs showing transactions for each joined
Defendant’s IP address connected with the file identified by the SHA-1 hash
value of B17E6CBB71FF9E931ED034CFC5EC7A3B8F29BB1E (the “Unique
Hash Identifier”), Pl. Compl. ¶¶ 43, 44;

(iv)

IPP evidence logs showing each “hash identifier piece” distributed by the IP
address of each joined Defendant, Pl. Compl. ¶¶ 25-27, 46;

(v)

IPP evidence logs showing transactions for the individual’s IP address who
created the torrent descriptor file for the file identified by the Unique Hash
Number and initially seeded the file identified by the Unique Hash Number, Pl.
Compl. ¶¶ 24-27; and,

(vi)

The fully playable digital motion picture of “Pretty Back Door Baby” that
correlates with/to the Unique Hash Number, Pl. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 47.

Plaintiff has stated that it plans to use the above information to support its claims against
Harrison in a responsive motion previously filed with this Court: “[E]ach of the requested items
forms the basis for Plaintiff’s plausible copyright infringement claims and is a relevant piece of

	  

3	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 118 Filed 07/30/13 Page 4 of 8 PageID #: 774

admissible evidence that Plaintiff will use to prove its case at trial” [Dkt. 109 at 2]. These
documents, computer files, and other electronic data must be in the possession, custody, or
control of Plaintiff because Plaintiff expressly references and relies on them throughout its
Complaint as the basis of its copyright infringement claims against Harrison; Plaintiff is the
owner of the copyrighted Work, “Pretty Back Door Baby;” and, Plaintiff requested and received
subpoena responses from the each of the joined Doe Defendants’ Internet Service Providers in
this action [Dkt. 59 at 1-3]. Pl. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 5, 15, 16.
B.
PLAINTIFF FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PARAGRAPH C OF THE SCHEDULING
ORDER AND PLAINTIFF SHOULD HAVE IN ITS POSSESSION, CUSTODY, OR CONTROL
COPIES OF ALL NON-PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS RELATED TO HARRISON’S ALLEGED
INFRINGING ACTIVITY TO PRODUCE A WRITTEN DAMAGES ESTIMATE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH PARAGRAPH C OF THE SCHEDULING ORDER.
Plaintiff must possess or control all documents supporting its claims against Harrison to
comply with paragraph C of the Scheduling Order. Such documents are non-privileged and
Plaintiff must necessarily possess them to produce its written damages estimate against Harrison.
Otherwise, Plaintiff cannot know the nature and extent of its injury allegedly caused by Harrison.
If Plaintiff has not or does not possess or control information related to Harrison’s alleged
infringing activity, how does Plaintiff know it has been injured by Harrison at all?
C.
PLAINTIFF’S FAILURE TO OBEY PARAGRAPHS B AND C OF THE SCHEDULING
ORDER IS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY JUSTIFIED BECAUSE PLAINTIFF: (I) MADE
REPRESENTATIONS AND PROMISES REGARDING THE SCHEDULING ORDER MATERIALS
AND DEADLINES; (II) FAILED TO OBTAIN AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLY WITH
THE SCHEDULING ORDER; (III) FAILED TO COMPLY WITH RULE 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) OF
THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE; AND, (IV) FAILED TO CONTACT OR
ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH HARRISON REGARDING ITS NONCOMPLIANCE
WITH THE SCHEDULING ORDER.
This Court should grant Harrison’s Motion and the relief requested therein because there
is no genuine dispute that Plaintiff totally failed to obey paragraph B and only partially complied

	  

4	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 118 Filed 07/30/13 Page 5 of 8 PageID #: 775

(if it can be called that) with paragraph C of the Scheduling Order. And reasonable people
cannot differ as to the appropriateness of Plaintiff’s failure because:
(i)

Plaintiff represented that it possessed or controlled the information in paragraphs
B and C of the Scheduling Order and promised in open court before Magistrate
Judge Mark J. Dinsmore during the July 9, 2013 Pre-Trial Conference to provide
Harrison with that information by July 26, 2013;

(ii)

Plaintiff did not move for and did not obtain an order for an extension of time for
complying with the dates set forth in paragraphs B and C of the Scheduling Order;

(iii)

Plaintiff totally failed to disclaim possession, custody, or control of said
documents, computer files, or other electronic data in its Scheduling Order
responses to paragraphs B and C that Plaintiff provided Harrison on July 30,
2013, and Plaintiff’s failure to specify the category and location of said
information constitutes a violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) and is further
evidence that Plaintiff’s failure is not substantially justified; and,

(iii)

As of the filing of this Motion, Plaintiff has not contacted or attempted to
communicate with Harrison regarding its compliance, or lack thereof, with
paragraphs B and C of the Scheduling Order.

D.
HARRISON IS NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MOTION TO COMPEL OR TO COMPLY
WITH THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS PRECEDENT TO FILING A MOTION TO COMPEL
BECAUSE PLAINTIFF FAILED TO OBEY A SCHEDULING ORDER AND RULE 16(f) OF THE
FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE APPLIES TO SUCH FAILURES.
Rule 16(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is the proper Federal Rule for
according Harrison relief because Rule 16(f) is directly applicable to situations where a party
disobeys a court’s scheduling or other pretrial order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(1)(C). As
discussed above, Plaintiff failed to obey the Scheduling Order and Plaintiff’s failure lacks
substantial justification.
For the sake of argument only, and in anticipation of Plaintiff’s objections or arguments
to the contrary, the above facts also provide sufficient notice to obviate the requirement of a
formal motion to compel in a Rule 37(b) case. See Tamari v. Bache & Co., 729 F.2d 469, 473
(7th Cir. 1984). Plaintiff received adequate notice of the July 26, 2013 deadline and failed to

	  

5	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 118 Filed 07/30/13 Page 6 of 8 PageID #: 776

obey a written Scheduling Order distributed to the parties through the Court’s electronic system
on July 9, 2013. Harrison is not required to file a Rule 37(a) motion or to comply with the prefiling requirements to a motion to compel disclosure. Id. at 473.
E.
PLAINTIFF’S NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE SCHEDULING ORDER MANDATES
IMPOSING SANCTIONS AND THIS COURT SHOULD HOLD A HEARING FOR THE PURPOSE
OF DETERMINING WHICH SANCTIONS TO IMPOSE BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S LEVEL OF
CULPABILITY.
Plaintiff’s violation of the Scheduling Order mandates the imposition of sanctions;
Plaintiff’s willfulness, bad faith, or fault determines only which sanctions the court should
impose and not whether sanctions are appropriate at all. Id. at 474 (citing as an example Societe
Internationale v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 208 (1958) and Marquis v. Chrysler Corp., 577 F.2d
624, 642 (9th Cir. 1978)). This Court should hold a hearing for the purpose of determining
Plaintiff’s culpability for failing to comply with the Scheduling Order.
F.
THIS COURT MUST ORDER PLAINTIFF TO PAY HARRISON’S COSTS AND
ATTORNEY’S FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH PLAINTIFF’S NONCOMPLIANCE
WITH THE SCHEDULING ORDER IN ADDITION TO IMPOSING OTHER SANCTIONS
BECAUSE IT WOULD DETER PLAINTIFF FROM DISOBEYING THE SCHEDULING ORDER
OR OTHER DISCOVERY ORDERS IN THE FUTURE.
Harrison has incurred expenses, including costs and attorney’s fees, as a result of
Plaintiff’s failure to obey the Scheduling Order; namely, the costs and fees incurred in
connection with bringing this Motion for Order Compelling Disclosure and Imposing Costs and
Fees, the Memorandum in Support of this Motion, the proposed Order accompanying this
Motion, as well as all other expenses incurred in obtaining relief from the Court on this matter.
This Court should order Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay Harrison’s costs and attorney’s fees
in addition to any other just orders issued by this Court, including those authorized by Fed. R.
Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)—(vii) because Plaintiff’s noncompliance with the Scheduling Order is not
substantially justified and other circumstances do not make an award of expenses unjust.

	  

6	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 118 Filed 07/30/13 Page 7 of 8 PageID #: 777

Ordering Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay Harrison’s costs and attorney’s fees in
addition to other sanctions would serve the important purpose of deterring Plaintiff from
disobeying the Scheduling Order or any other discovery orders in the future. See United
Consumers Club, Inc. v. Prime Time Marketing Management Inc., 271 F.R.D. 487, 501 (N.D.
Ind. Nov. 16, 2010) (citing Woods v. Chicago Transit Authority, 2006 WL 2460618, *2 (N.D.Ill.
Aug. 18, 2006) in turn citing National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427
U.S. 639 (1976)) (all standing for the proposition that a sanction award should effectuate the
three purposes of ensuring the disobedient party does not benefit from non-compliance;
obtaining compliance with discovery orders; and providing a general deterrent in the particular
case and litigation in general). This Court should order Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay
Harrison’s costs and attorney’s fees caused by Plaintiff’s disobedience in addition to other just
orders because it would effectuate the purposes of awarding sanctions.
III.

CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons this Court should issue any just orders, including those

authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for Plaintiff’s
failure to obey the Court’s Scheduling Order; enter an Order compelling Plaintiff to immediately
disclose all materials as required by paragraphs B and C of the Scheduling Order; imposing costs
and fees and requiring Plaintiff, its attorney, or both to pay the costs and attorney’s fees incurred
by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to obey the Scheduling Order; further admonishing
Plaintiff that continued noncompliance with this Court’s Scheduling Order or other discovery
orders will result in the imposition of harsher sanctions and penalties; and, setting a hearing to
determine Plaintiff’s level of culpability for the purpose of imposing appropriate sanctions.
