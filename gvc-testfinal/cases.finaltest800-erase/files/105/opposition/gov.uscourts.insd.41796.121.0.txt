PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT MICHAEL
HARRISON’S MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING DISCLOSURE AND
IMPOSING COSTS AND FEES
Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”), respectfully requests this Court deny the
subject Motion (CM/ECF 118). Significantly, Defendant unilaterally filed his Motion without
complying with this Court’s Local Rule 37-1 regarding discovery disputes. The Rule mandates
that “[p]rior to involving the court in any discovery dispute . . . counsel must confer in a good
faith attempt to resolve the dispute.” L.R. 37-1(a). The Rule further states that if the parties
cannot resolve the dispute amongst themselves, “counsel are encouraged to contact the chambers
of the assigned Magistrate Judge to determine whether the Magistrate Judge is available to
resolve the discovery dispute by way of a telephone conference or other proceeding prior to
counsel filing a formal discovery motion.” Id. (Emphasis added). Finally, the Rule mandates
that “[a]ny motion raising a discovery dispute must contain a statement setting forth the efforts
taken to resolve the dispute . . . The court may deny any motion raising a discovery dispute that
does not contain such a statement.” Id. (Emphasis added).

Defendant made no effort to comply with the Court’s Local Rule. Defendant did not
confer or attempt to confer with Plaintiff prior to filing his motion. Had he done so, he would
have been informed that Plaintiff’s investigator, which identifies the infringement, records the
evidence, and culls the electronic discovery used in all of Plaintiff’s cases, is located in
Germany.

And, the process of collecting, formatting, and sending the relevant electronic

discovery to Plaintiff is both time and labor intensive. Had Defendant conferred with Plaintiff
prior to filing his motion, the issues could have been resolved amongst the parties without the
need for Court intervention. Choosing to forego the mandatory good faith conference, however,
Defendant has unnecessarily involved the Court in an issue which is now moot, since Defendant
has now received the relevant discovery. 1 Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion should be denied.
See Edlin v. Garner Family Enterprises, Inc., 2012 WL 364088, at *1 (S.D. Ind. 2012) (denying
motion to quash where the defendant failed comply with Local Rule 37-1: “Defendant failed to
take either approach, choosing instead to ignore Local Rule 37–1 and simply file a motion to
quash. As a result, the motion to quash is denied.”); Corre Opportunities Fund, LP v. Emmis
Commc'ns Corp., 2013 WL 1500461, at *1 (S.D. Ind. 2013) (denying discovery motion where
“no communications before the Court suggest that the parties conferred in a good faith attempt to
resolve the dispute,” and the parties otherwise failed to comply with Local Rule 37-1.); Remy
Inc. v. Tecnomatic, S.P.A., 2013 WL 1311095, at *2 (S.D. Ind. 2013) (denying discovery motion
noting that, “Even if Tecnomatic were under no meet and confer obligation pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, our Local Rules contain a meet and confer requirement that is unequivocal,

1

Defendant was initially unintentionally sent electronic discovery from Plaintiff’s investigator pertaining
to a different defendant. Defendant notified Plaintiff of this error and Plaintiff has taken immediate action
to correct the inadvertent mistake. Defendant will receive the correct electronic discovery in the
immediate future.

applies to all discovery disputes, and allows for the summary denial of a motion that fails to
contain a meet and confer certification.) (Emphasis in original).
Further, Defendant’s motion does not “contain a statement setting forth the efforts taken
to resolve the dispute, including the date, time, and place of any discovery conference and the
names of all participating parties[.]” L.R. 37-1 (b). Finally, Defendant has suffered no prejudice
or other harm resulting from Plaintiff’s unavoidable delay. Since filing the subject Motion,
Defendant has received the relevant electronic discovery. The costs incurred by Defendant in
preparing and filing his Motion, Memorandum in Support, and Proposed Order could have easily
been avoided had Defendant complied with his obligation to confer with Plaintiff. Plaintiff
should not be required to pay Defendant’s wholly unnecessary and avoidable fees which were
incurred because of Defendant’s failure to comply with the relevant Local Rule.
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court deny the subject
Motion.
