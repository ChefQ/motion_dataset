UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.
DONTAVIOUS BLAKE,
Defendant.

MOTION FOR SEVERANCE OF DEFENDANTS
OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE
Defendant, Dontavious Blake and co-defendant, Tara Moore, are charged with causing
minors to engage in commercial sex acts, and with causing adults to engage in commercial sex
by means of coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1591, and conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1594(c). On July 2, 2014, only nineteen days before trial, the Government disclosed for the
first time an alleged factual basis for its theory of coercion: That Blake coerced drug addicted
women into prostitution by providing them with drugs. At the motions hearing the Government
also elicited testimony about police responding to a domestic disturbance between defendants
Blake and Moore. Furthermore, the text messages and email that the Government seized in the
prostitution investigation contain messages purportedly about Blake hitting Moore, that she was
hit “like a man,” and that she should have left him the first time it happened.1 All viewed

together, it now becomes apparent that co-defendant Moore will highlight what was previously
irrelevant domestic evidence, to tie in with the Government’s claim of coercion, and present an
antagonistic defense that Blake coerced not only the alleged victims, but that co-defendant Moore
was also a victim of coercion. In a case where Blake is facing a possible sentence of life in
prison, a severance should be granted due to antagonistic defenses so that Blake is not
simultaneously prosecuted by both, the Government and the co-defendant.
In the alternative, if a severance is not granted, defendant Blake moves the Court to
preclude evidence of domestic violence and coercion of Moore pursuant to FRE 404(b), Rule
403, and on the basis that it is hearsay being offered for the truth of the matter asserted in
violation of FRE 802.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
A.

The Court Should Grant A Severance of Defendants
Defendants may be properly joined “if they are alleged to have participated in the same

act or transaction, or in the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an offense or
offenses.” FRCP 8(b). However, Rule 14 recognizes that a proper joinder under Rule 8(b) may

prejudice either a defendant or the Government:
If the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment, an
information, or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a
defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of
counts, sever the defendants’ trials, ir or provide any other relief
that justice requires.
FRCP 14(a).
It is well established that mutually antagonistic or irreconcilable defenses may be so
prejudicial as to mandate a severance. Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 537, 113 S.Ct. 933,
937 (1993); United States v. Magdaniel-Mora, 746 F.2d 715, 718 (11th Cir. 1984). A severance
should be granted if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right
of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or
innocence. Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. at 539, 113 S.Ct. at 938. The Eleventh Circuit has
held that antagonistic defenses must be mutually exclusive, such that in order for a jury to believe
the testimony on behalf of one defendant, it must necessarily disbelieve the testimony offered on
behalf of the co-defendant. United States v. Liss, 265 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2001); United States
v. Knowles, 66 F.3d 1146 (11th Cir. 1995).
In the present case, the antagonistic defense of coercion presented through the content of
email would not only compromise Blake’s trial right of confrontation, it would eliminate that
right with respect to Moore because Moore cannot be compelled to testify. In addition, email
evidence that Blake struck co-defendant Moore, gave her a black eye, or hit her like a man, is so
inflammatory and prejudicial that a jury could not make a reliable judgment on guilt or innocence
about the non-physical coercion being alleged by the Government. The joint accusations of
coercion by the Government and co-defendant Moore would be inseparably intertwined by the

jury- - that Blake is an abuser, such that a limiting instruction could not possibly preserve the
integrity of the trial

B.

The Court Should Preclude Domestic Violence Pursuant to FRE 404(b).
Rule 404(b) precludes evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts, subject to a

few exceptions for admissibility:
(1) Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to
prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular
occasion the person acted in accordance with the character. FRE
404(b).
(2) This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as
proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,
identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

Evidence by the Government or by co-defendant Moore that she was coerced by Blake
through physical abuse would be evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts that would not be
admissible under any of the grounds permitted by FRE 404(b)(2). Moreover, forcing Blake to
defend against a co-defendant claiming coercion by physical abuse would cause unfair prejudice,
confuse the issues, mislead the jury, and cause undue delay and a waste of time, all in violation
of FRE 403.

C.

The Court Should Exclude Hearsay Evidence of Physical Abuse or Coercion.
FRE 802 provides that hearsay is not admissible unless a federal statute, the rules of

evidence, or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. FRE 802. Hearsay
from email or text messages, such as we have in this case, would be offered for the truth of the

4

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 200 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/07/2014 Page 5 of 7

matter being asserted, and does not come within any of the hearsay exceptions. To the contrary,
the text messages in the attached Exhibit do not even have a foundational basis of reliability.
The messages are written by an individual designated in the messages as “Work Phone, 561-7276895.” The text messages do not identify the person writing the messages, or who was hit by
whom. The messages offer no time-frame of when the act occurred, and no detail from which to
establish reliability. The text messages are further undermined by testimony at the suppression
hearing on July 2, 2014, that police responded to a domestic call regarding Blake and Moore, but
it was a verbal altercation, not physical, and there were no bruises, no injury, and no arrest.
Accordingly, hearsay evidence about physical abuse or coercion is unreliable and does not fit
under hearsay exception, and therefore, should be exlcuded from the trial.

Conclusion
Defendant Blake is facing life in prison and should have a fair trial with a reliable verdict.
These interests are undermined by the Government presenting evidence of Blake physically
abusing co-defendant Moore, or by Moore joining the Government’s prosecution under a theory
that Moore was coerced into criminal activity by Blake. The surest way to protect Blake’s right
to a fair trial is to grant Blake’s request for a severance from Moore. In the alternative, if a

5

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 200 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/07/2014 Page 6 of 7

severance is denied, the Court should preclude hearsay evidence of physical abuse pursuant to
FRE 404(b), 403, and as inadmissible hearsay pursuant to FRE 802.
