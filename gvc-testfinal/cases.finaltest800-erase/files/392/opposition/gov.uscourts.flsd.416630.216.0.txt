UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
Case No. 13-80054-CR-MARRA

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.
TARA JO MOORE,
Defendant.
_________________________/
UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR
SEVERANCE OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE
The United States of America, by and through Wifredo A. Ferrer, United States Attorney
for the Southern District of Florida, and the undersigned counsel, hereby opposes the defendant’s
Motion for Severance of defendants or in the Alternative Exclusion of Evidence. Defendant’s
motion should be denied because (1) joinder is proper under Rule 8(a), Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, in that all of the charged counts are connected with, and constitute parts of, the
defendant’s common scheme or plan, (2) because defendant has not shown that a failure to sever
would cause compelling prejudice to him and (3) the Court can, if necessary, exclude the alleged
prejudicial text messages to prevent any prejudice to defendant Blake.
FACTS
I.

The Charges
The defendant Dontavious Blake along with co-defendant Tara Jo Moore are charged in

Counts One and Two of the Third Superseding Indictment with sex trafficking of a minor, in

1

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 2 of 9

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(2) and Title 18 U.S.C. § 2. [DE:147]. Count Three
charges the defendants with conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(2), and § 1594(c). [DE:147]. Counts Four and Five charge the
defendants with sex trafficking by use of force, threats of force, coercion or a combination of
such conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1); (b)(1). Id. Count Six charges the
defendants with Conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by use of force, threats of force,
coercion or a combination of such conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1); (b)(1) and §
1594(c).
II.

Background and Theory of the United States’ Case
The charges for sex trafficking of minors and the charges for sex trafficking of adults by

force are related in that they are part of the same plan and scheme to engage in sex trafficking
generally. The defendants’ use of force and other means forms the basis of the “coercion”
element of those charges. “Coercion” is defined by statute to include “threats of serious harm to
or physical restraint against any person” and ‘any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a
person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical
restraint against any person.” 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2). The statute defines ‘serious harm” to
mean “any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, . . . , that is sufficiently serious, . . . , to
compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or
to continue performing commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring that harm.” 18
U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4).
The Government’s theory of the case is that from at least August 2011 through October
2012, the defendants coerced multiple drug addicted female victims to engage in commercial sex
in violation of federal law. Moore and Blake utilized the victims’ vulnerability, drug addiction,
2

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 3 of 9

to force and coerce them into engaging in prostitution. The Government expects the evidence
will show that Blake and Moore caused some of the victims to become addicted to Oxycodone.
This addiction was so severe that the victims would suffer from opiate withdrawal sickness if
they did not obtain Oxycodone. This opiate withdrawal sickness is called getting “pill sick.”
The victims will describe being “pill sick” as experiencing a combination of painful physical and
psychological symptoms such as seizures, fever, chills, cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea. These
victims will testify that they continued to engage in commercial sex activity in order to obtain
their supply of Oxycodone and because of their fear of getting “pill sick.”
This fear of severe withdrawal symptoms meets the definition of “serious harm” as
defined by the statute. Not only are the symptoms of opiate withdrawal the experience of severe
physical pain, but the threat of withdrawal sickness constitutes “psychological” harm that is
“sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of
the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing
commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4).
The Government intends to introduce evidence that Blake also made threats to certain prostitutes
to collect money for drug debts. However, it is not the Government’s theory of the case that
Blake physically assaulted victims to make them engage in prostitution or take part in his sex
trafficking ring.
III.

Joinder is Appropriate
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) permits joinder of offenses when the offenses

charged “are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a
common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Cr. P. 89a). This rule is “broadly construed in favor of the
initial joinder.” United States v. Dowd, 451 F.3d 1244, 1249 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting United
3

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 4 of 9

States v. Dominguez, 226 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 2000)). Here, the charges in the superseding
indictment can be divided into two categories: (1) sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy
offenses (Counts One through Three), and (2) sex trafficking by the use of force, threats of force,
coercion or a combination of such conduct and conspiracy offenses (Counts Four through Six).
These two categories “are ‘connected’ together if the proof of one crime constitutes a substantial
portion of the proof of the other.” United States v. Montes-Cardenas, 746 F.2d 771, 76 (11th Cir.
1984) (citations omitted).
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
The Court must undertake a two-step inquiry to determine whether separate charges may
be properly tried at the same time. First, the government bears the burden to show that joinder of
the offenses is proper under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b). United States v. Gabay,
923 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir.1991). If it is, the Court then must consider whether it should
exercise its discretion to sever offenses in order to avoid prejudice to a defendant or the
government. Id. (citing United States v. Montes–Cardenas, 746 F.2d 771, 776 (11th Cir.1984)).
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) governs the joinder of offenses, providing:
The indictment of information may charge a defendant in separate counts with 2 or more
offenses if the offenses charged whether felonies or misdemeanors or both are of the
same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected or
constitute parts of a common scheme or plan. Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a).
Joinder of offenses is proper when “the facts underlying each offense are so closely connected
that proof of such facts is necessary to establish each offense.” United States v. Weaver, 905 F.2d
1466, 1477 (11th Cir.1990).
“[W]hen the defendant attacks joinder as improper based on the indictment but later
evidence shows that joinder is proper, [courts] look beyond the face of the indictment.”

4

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 5 of 9

Dominguez, 226 F.3d at 1241. Rule 8 requires the government to allege, not prove, facts
necessary to sustain joinder. Id. (failure to prove these facts at trial does not mean joinder was
improper if the government's allegations were made in good faith).
The Court should consider whether substantial prejudice would result from a joint trial on
the sex trafficking of minors counts and the sex trafficking using force, threats of force or
coercion counts. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14(a) allows the court to “order separate
trials of counts ... or provide any other relief that justice requires” in the event that a joinder of
offenses in an indictment or for trial “appears to prejudice a defendant or the government.”
Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(a). Any such relief is within the discretion of the district court. United States v.
Benz, 740 F.2d 903, 911 (11th Cir.1984). The defendant bears the heavy burden to demonstrate
the existence of compelling prejudice which would result in an unfair trial. United States v.
Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 858–59 (11th Cir.2006).
I.

Blake’s Motion To Sever Based On Antagonistic Defense
Here, Blake’s claims are highly speculative of prejudice resulting from antagonistic or

irreconcilable defenses. Blake presumes, without producing evidence, that Moore will testify that
he forced her to participate in the sex trafficking ring. Blake basis this speculation on a single
text message. Blake claims fall far short of his burden to show why this Court should exercise
its discretion under Rule 14 to sever the charges in his Third Superseding Indictment. See
Kennard, 472 F.3d at 858–59. This Court could easily exclude the text message in an
evidentiary ruling to prevent such alleged prejudice.
Severance on the basis of antagonistic defenses is only justified if the alleged antagonistic
offenses are “mutually exclusive and irreconcilable.” United States v. Andrews, 765 F.2d 1491,
1498 (11th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1064, 106 S.Ct. 815, 88 L.Ed.2d 789 (1986). In
5

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 6 of 9

other words, severance is appropriate only in circumstances in which the jury is faced with the
problem of being able to believe one defendant's position or another defendant's position—but
not both; belief of one position necessitates disbelief of the other. United States v. Frost, 61 F.3d
1518, 1526 (11th Cir.1995).
In the instant case, defendants have failed to show that the jury will have to make that
choice. Blake’s claims amount to speculation regarding hypothetical defenses. This does not
prove that there will be irreconcilable conflicts. At this juncture, there is no reliable evidence of
antagonism among the parties that would justify severance on that basis. Hence, severance is not
warranted on the basis of antagonistic defenses.
Finally, after balancing the risk of unfair prejudice to Blake against the interests of
judicial economy and the victims interest in avoiding multiple trials, this Court should deny
Blake’s motion to sever trial on the charges against him. See United States v. Baker, 432 F.3d
1189, 1236 (11th Cir.2005) (the district court is required to balance the right of the defendant to
a fair trial against the public's interest in efficiency and judicial economy); Benz, 740 F.2d at 911.
II.

Blake’s Motion to Sever Generally
Defendants charged with participating in the same offenses are ordinarily tried together,

even if the evidence is stronger against some than against others. See United States v. Francis,
131 F.3d 1452, 1459 (11th Cir.1997); United States v. Velasquez, 772 F.2d 1348, 1352 (7th
Cir.1985) (noting that the danger of prejudice to the least guilty or the prejudice from confusion
in a multi-defendant trial is almost always outweighed by the economies of a single trial).
The Court may consider severance of defendants under Rule 14 where there is a disparity
in proof presented as to one defendant over others or prejudicial spillover from defendant to the
other. See United States v. Blankenship, 382 F.3d 1110, 1123–24 (11th Cir.2004). The defendant
6

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 7 of 9

bears the heavy burden to show that a jury will be unable, due to the massive amount and
complex nature of the evidence, to make an individualized guilt determination for each
defendant. Francis, 131 F.3d at 1459 (citing United States v. Saget, 991 F.2d 702, 707 (11th
Cir.1993)). Conclusory allegations cannot carry such a burden. Id. at 145 (citing United States v.
Hogan, 986 F.2d 1364, 1375 (11th Cir.1993). Moreover, the presumption exists that cautionary
instructions to the jury will guard adequately against any prejudice arising from the joint trial.
United States v. Gonzalez, 940 F.2d 1413, 1428 (11th Cir.1991); Francis, 131 F.3d at 1459
(affirming district court's denial of motion to sever).
Some prejudice is inherent in all multi-count indictments, and the defendant must show
“compelling prejudice” to warrant severance over the interest in the expedient administration of
the judiciary. United States v. Walser, 3 F.3d 380, 386 (11th Cir. 1993); United States v. Harris,
908 F.2d 728, 737 (11th Cir. 1990). The defendant has a heavy burden to show compelling
prejudice. United States v. Hersh, 297 F.3d 1233, 1243 (11th Cir. 2002). The test is, under all
circumstances, is it within the capacity of reasonable jurors to follow a court’s limiting
instruction and render a fair and impartial verdict. Id.
CONCLUSION
Joinder in this case is appropriate under Rule 8(a). The sex trafficking offenses constitute
parts of a common scheme or plan. Further, none of the defendant’s asserted reasons for needing
severance in this case amount to compelling prejudice that cannot be overcome by evidentiary
rulings and jury instructions. A joint trial on all of the charges in the superseding

7

Case 9:13-cr-80054-KAM Document 216 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2014 Page 8 of 9

indictment will not prejudice the defendant, as evidence of both the sex trafficking offenses
would be admissible in separate trials.
