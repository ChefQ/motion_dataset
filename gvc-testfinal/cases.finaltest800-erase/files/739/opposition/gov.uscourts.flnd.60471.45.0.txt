CASE NO. 1:10-cv-253-SPM-GRJ

DEFENDANTS KOPPERS INC., BEAZER EAST, INC., AND KOPPERS
HOLDINGS, INC.’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
FILE REPLY TO DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO MOTION TO REMAND

Defendants Koppers Inc., Beazer East, Inc., and Koppers Holdings, Inc.
(hereinafter collectively referenced as “Defendants”), by their attorneys, submit their
response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File Reply as follows:
1.

Defendants removed this action on December 23, 2010. After obtaining

an agreed upon extension of time to assess Defendants’ Notice of Removal, on February
3, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Remand. (Doc. 30). Defendants filed their response
to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Remand on February 25, 2011. (Doc. 39). Defendants’ response
did not raise any new legal theories or arguments that were not previously set forth in
their Notice of Removal.
2.

Local Rule 7.1(C)(2) states: “No reply memoranda shall be filed absent a

showing of good cause.” N.D. Fla. Local Rule 7.1(C)(2). Plaintiffs bear the burden of
showing good cause for the filing of a reply brief, and if they fail that burden, the Court

should deny their motion. Streeter v. City of Pensacola, No. 3:05cv286/MCR, 2009 WL
248103, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 2, 2009), vacated on other grounds, Glover v. City of
Pensacola, 372 Fed. Appx. 952 (11th Cir. 2010).
3.

Plaintiffs contend that good cause exists for a reply because Defendants, in

their response to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Remand, identified two additional members of the
putative class whom Plaintiffs contend are deceased. Plaintiffs seek leave to submit
evidence that those two individuals (William Forrester and Johnnie Boggs) are deceased
and should be excluded from the proposed class. Defendants do not oppose or object to
Plaintiffs submitting evidence on this limited issue.
4.

However, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave is not limited to a proposed

showing that those two individuals are deceased. Instead, Plaintiffs further request leave
to reply to unspecified “other arguments raised” in Defendants’ response to their Motion
to Remand. Plaintiffs have failed to offer, and cannot offer, any basis for this Court to
conclude that good causes exists to submit a reply brief. Plaintiffs’ failure to articulate
the basis for their motion (other than the status of Forrester and Boggs) deprives
Defendants and the Court of the ability to assess whether good cause exists. Defendants
have not raised any new substantive arguments of which Plaintiffs were not aware or
unable to address in their Motion to Remand.

Therefore, the Court should deny

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave insofar as it relates to unspecified “other arguments raised”
in Defendants’ response brief. Streeter, 2009 WL 248103, at *2.
WHEREFORE, Defendants Koppers Inc., Beazer East, Inc., and Koppers
Holdings, Inc., respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to

William Forrester and Johnnie Boggs.
