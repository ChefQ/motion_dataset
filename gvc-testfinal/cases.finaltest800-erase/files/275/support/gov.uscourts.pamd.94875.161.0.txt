Civil Action
No. 13-1861-JEJ

WOLF et al.,
Defendants.
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF
TIME TO FILE PETITION FOR FEES AND COSTS
Plaintiffs respectfully move this Court for a thirty (30) day extension of time
to file a petition for attorneys’ fees and costs. In support, Plaintiffs assert:
1.

By order dated May 20, 2014, this Court entered judgment in favor of

Plaintiffs.
2.

Through previously-filed unopposed motions for extensions of time,

the Court has granted extensions to Plaintiffs to file any petition for fees and costs
pursuant to section 1988 of title 42 of the United States Code. As stated in the
prior motions, the purpose of such extensions was to enable the parties to attempt
to resolve Plaintiffs’ claim for attorneys’ fees and costs without the need for a fee
petition.

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 161 Filed 08/28/14 Page 3 of 7

3.

Unfortunately, last week, the parties realized they would not reach an

agreement that would moot the need for Plaintiffs to file a petition for fees and
costs and settlement discussions have now terminated.
4.

Although Plaintiffs have provided extensive data and information to

the Defendants, the assembly of a complete petition for fees and costs will take
additional time and expenditure of substantial resources that Plaintiffs have
avoided incurring during settlement discussions.
5.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant

Plaintiffs another thirty (30) day extension of time to file a petition for fees and
costs, making any such petition due on or before September 29, 2014.
6.

Plaintiffs sought the consent of Defendants Secretary Michael Wolf,

Secretary Dan Meuser and Register of Wills Donald J. Petrille, Jr. to this motion,
but they do not agree with the relief requested herein.
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that
the Court grant this motion and extend Plaintiffs’ deadline to file any petition for
fees and costs by thirty (30) days until September 29, 2014.
