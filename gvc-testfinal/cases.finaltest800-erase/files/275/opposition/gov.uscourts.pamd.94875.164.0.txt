DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR FOURTH
EXTENSION OF TIME TO SUBMIT PETITION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
Defendants Michael Wolf, Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, and Dan
Meuser, the Commonwealth’s Secretary of Revenue (“Defendants”), through their
attorneys, Lamb McErlane PC, hereby file this Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’
Motion for Extension of Time to Submit Plaintiffs’ Petition for Attorneys’ Fees
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1988.
Simply stated, Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied because Plaintiffs already
have been given substantially more time to prepare their request than the rules
contemplate and have failed to show good cause to justify yet another extension.
Further delay is unnecessary and adverse to Defendants’ interests and the interests
of Pennsylvania taxpayers. Accordingly, for the reasons below, this Court should

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 164 Filed 08/29/14 Page 2 of 10

deny Plaintiffs’ Motion, direct Plaintiffs to promptly file their fee request, and, after
evaluating Defendants’ opposition thereto, expeditiously decide the amount of fees
and costs to be awarded to Plaintiffs in this matter.
I.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs commenced this case by Complaint filed on July 9, 2013 seeking

declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983. On May 20, 2014, this
Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment. In so doing, this Court: (i)
struck down as unconstitutional Pennsylvania’s marriage statutes, 23 Pa. C.S. §§
1102 and 1704 and (ii) permanently enjoined Defendants from enforcing
Pennsylvania’s marriage statutes in the future. The very next day, on May 21, 2014,
Governor Corbett publicly announced that the Commonwealth Defendants would
not appeal this Court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit.
Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1988, Plaintiffs, as prevailing parties, were required to
submit any request for attorneys’ fees and costs with this Court within ten (10) days
of this Court’s May 20, 2014 Order. Accordingly, Plaintiffs were required to submit
their request for attorneys’ fees and costs on or before May 30, 2014.
On May 28, 2014, shortly before their request for fees and costs was due,
Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Fees and Costs,

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 164 Filed 08/29/14 Page 3 of 10

(Doc. 137), requesting an additional sixty (60) days within which to file their Fee
Petition. Defendants consented to this request. On May 29, 2014, this Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion, (Doc. 138), and allowed Plaintiffs until July 29, 2014 to file their
request for fees and costs.
On July 28, 2014, the day before Plaintiffs’ motion for fees and costs was due
pursuant to the extended deadline, Plaintiffs filed a second motion for extension of
time (Doc. 156), seeking an additional fifteen (15) days within which to file their
request. Defendants also consented to this request. On July 29, 2014, this Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion (Doc. 157) and directed Plaintiffs to file their request for
attorneys’ fees and costs on or before August 13, 2014. It was not until July 29, 2014
that Plaintiffs first provided to Defendants their demand and supporting
documentation regarding their claim for attorneys’ fees.
On August 13, 2014, Plaintiffs filed their third motion for extension of time
(Doc. 159) seeking an additional fifteen (15) day extension of time within which to
file their request for attorneys’ fees and costs. Once again, Defendants consented to
this request. On August 13, 2014, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion and directed
Plaintiffs to file their request for attorneys’ fees and costs on or before August 28,
2014. (Doc. 160).

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 164 Filed 08/29/14 Page 4 of 10

On August 28, 2014, Plaintiffs filed their fourth request for an extension of
time, this time seeking until September 29, 2014 within which to file their request
for attorneys’ fees and costs. (Doc.161). Plaintiffs requested Defendants’
concurrence to this fourth extension as well. However, unlike the three previous
occasions in which Defendants concurred with Plaintiffs’ request, Defendants
declined to acquiesce to Plaintiffs’ latest request for additional time.
II.

DISCUSSION
Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ most recent fourth request for a further, 30-day

extension of time for four compelling and important reasons.
First, it is time to bring this matter to a close. More than 90 days have passed
since this Court issued its decision on May 20, 2014. Plaintiffs have had sufficient
time (well above and beyond the normal ten days prescribed for such fee requests
under the rules) within which to gather their time records, prepare their motion and
submit their attorneys’ fees request to this Court. Moreover, Plaintiffs were on notice
for over one week prior to the filing of their most recent extension request that
settlement discussions regarding fees were not fruitful and that they should proceed
with the filing of their formal Motion for fees. Plaintiffs’ Motion for additional time
should be denied on timing grounds alone.

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 164 Filed 08/29/14 Page 5 of 10

Second, Plaintiffs’ attorneys -- particularly those affiliated with the ACLU - are seasoned practitioners intimately familiar with the process of submitting
requests for attorneys’ fees and costs in civil rights cases in federal court. Indeed,
one of plaintiffs’ attorneys, Witold (“Vic”) Walcek, recently participated in the filing
of a motion for attorneys’ fees in Lozano v. City of Hazelton (cite) on June 30, 2014,
fewer than two months ago, which contained the requisite affidavits evidencing
what plaintiffs’ counsel contended were the prevailing rates in the Middle District
of Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs’ counsel’s familiarity and experience with the process for
seeking attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to section 1988 -- and their access to the
types of information necessary to support such a motion -- strongly militates against
granting Plaintiffs yet another thirty (30) day extension within which to prepare and
file their Motion.
Third, Defendants will be harmed by more delay. Further extension of time
necessarily will translate to additional fees and costs to Defendants (and, by
extension, Pennsylvania taxpayers). The United States Supreme Court has noted that
the process for seeking attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1988 is not
designed to result in “a second major litigation.” See, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461
U.S. 424, 437 (1983). In this case, Defendants’ substantive involvement in this case
essentially ended on May 20, 2014. If Plaintiffs’ request is granted, Defendants will
still be litigating -- and incurring fees -- in this case well into October or November,

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 164 Filed 08/29/14 Page 6 of 10

2014. Further costly elongation of this process is unfair and adverse to Defendants
and the interests of Pennsylvania taxpayers.
Finally, Defendants are aware and, indeed, have seen both a summary of
Plaintiffs’ time records and a computation of the exorbitant amount (which amount
is, by orders of magnitude, significantly more than the amounts sought thus far by
any other plaintiffs in any other same sex marriage cases throughout the country) of
attorneys’ fees and costs purportedly incurred by Plaintiffs during the ten months
this case was litigated. Thus, Plaintiffs already have in hand all of the data to
allegedly substantiate their fee request. Moreover, Plaintiffs were aware from the
outset of this case that Plaintiffs would be seeking fees if Plaintiffs prevailed; thus,
nothing about the process for seeking fees should have come as a surprise to
Plaintiffs. In light of the facts that Plaintiffs have already gathered and compiled
detailed time records from all of the many attorneys they chose to involve in this
matter, it strains all reason to believe that Plaintiffs require yet another thirty (30)
days (over and above the 90 days that have passed since this Court entered its
decision on May 20) to prepare the subject filing.
Plaintiffs have offered no reason -- and, hence, no good cause -- for why
additional time is needed. Accordingly, good cause not being shown, this Court
should deny Plaintiffs’ request, direct Plaintiffs to promptly submit their motion for

Case 1:13-cv-01861-JEJ Document 164 Filed 08/29/14 Page 7 of 10

fees and costs, and, after evaluating Defendants’ opposition thereto, expeditiously
exercise its discretion in determining the amount of fees and costs to be awarded.
WHEREFORE, for all of the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully
request that this Court DENY Plaintiffs’ request for additional time within which to
file their request for attorneys’ fees and costs in this matter.
Respectfully submitted,
