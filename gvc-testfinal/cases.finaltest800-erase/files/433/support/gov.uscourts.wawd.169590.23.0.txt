SUMMARY JUDGMENT
NOTE ON MOTION CALENDAR:
November 5, 2010

INTRODUCTION & RELIEF REQUESTED

17
COMES NOW Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) for an order granting
18
19

Summary Judgment in favor of Wells Fargo. This motion is made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56

20

on the grounds that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to Steven Klinger and Sheila

21

Klinger’s (“Plaintiffs”) causes of action against Defendant Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo is

22

entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

23
24

Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserts various claims with regard to the contract and purchase of
Plaintiffs’ primary residence. Wells Fargo is the assignee of the Deed of Trust and the current

25
holder of the underlying note. As such, Wells Fargo was not a party to the original contract and
26
had no part in the origination of Plaintiffs’ loan.

1

Much of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is devoted to a generalized explanation of the financial

2

system and explaining a number of conspiracy theories relating to the lending and mortgage

3

industry. However, nearly all of the allegations are made generally as to “Defendants” or

4
“Lender” and does not specifically allege any conduct by Wells Fargo. Furthermore, Plaintiffs
5
6
7

cite little to no facts that relate the Complaint to Plaintiffs aside from identifying the property
address.

Additionally, Plaintiffs’ Complaint appears to be a form complaint available for purchase

or download on the Internet. Defendant’s counsel’s office is in receipt of the identical complaint

10

filed in other jurisdictions. Declaration of Heidi E. Buck, ¶ 2.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

12
13
14

A. Plaintiffs’ Attempt to Restrain the Sale was Deficient.
On or about August 5, 2010, Plaintiffs filed 1) an application to proceed in forma pauperis,

15

2) a proposed Petition, 3) a proposed Petition for Restraining Order, 4) memorandum in support of

16

proposed Petition for Restraining Order, and 5) a proposed Petition for Temporary Restraining

17

Order. Dkt.1.

18

As no TRO or preliminary injunction was in effect, on August 6, 2010, the property was

19
sold via a valid trustee’s sale to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the highest bidder. See Declaration of
20
21

Jennifer Robinson in support of Wells Fargo’s Motion for Summary Judgment (“Wells Fargo

22

Decl.”), ¶ 6. The Trustee’s Deed evidencing the sale was recorded August 17, 2010, under Pierce

23

County Auditor’s File No. 201008170582. A true and correct copy of the Trustee’s Deed is hereto

24

attached as Exhibit 1.

25
26

On or about September 1, 2010, the Court entered an Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for
Temporary Restraining Order on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to provide proper notice of the

2

B. Plaintiffs’ Petition Does Not Allege Any Actionable Claims.

3

The applicable facts relating to the underlying loan are as follows:

4
On or about April 28, 2008, Plaintiffs Steven L. Klinger, Jr. and Sheila J. Klinger, in
5
6

order to secure repayment of a promissory note (the “Note”) in the amount of $243,676.00,

7

granted to Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc. (“MERS”) as nominee for Lender

8

Pierce Commercial Bank, its successors and assigns (“Lender”) a deed of trust (the “Deed of

9

Trust”). The Deed of Trust encumbers the real property commonly known as 8503 163rd Street

10
11

Court East, Puyallup, Washington 98375 (the “Property”). The Deed of Trust was recorded April
30, 2008, under Pierce County Auditor’s File No. 200804301157. True and correct copies of the

12
13
14

Note and Deed of Trust are attached hereto as Exhibits 2 and 3, respectively.
Thereafter, Plaintiffs defaulted under the terms of the Note and Deed of Trust by failing to

15

make the payment due on August 1, 2009 and every payment due thereafter. Wells Fargo Decl., ¶ 4.

16

On or about December 8, 2009, MERS executed an assignment of deed of trust (the

17

“Assignment of Deed of Trust”) whereby it assigned its interest under the Deed of Trust to Wells

18

Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”). The Assignment of Deed of Trust was recorded under Pierce

19
County Auditor’s File No. 20091290266. A true and correct copy of the Assignment Deed of Trust
20
21

is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.

22

On or about December 8, 2009, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ default and the terms of the Note and

23

Deed of Trust, Wells Fargo instructed NWTS to transmit a Notice of Default on behalf of Wells

24

Fargo and foreclose in the name of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo Decl., ¶ 5.

25
26

On or about December 9, 2009, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. recorded an appointment of
successor trustee (the “Appointment of Successor Trustee”) naming Northwest Trustee Services,

Whether Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment pursuant to FRCP 56,
when a) Plaintiffs waived their claims for breach of fiduciary duty,
negligence, TILA violations, RESPA violations, and intentional infliction of
emotional distress and any right to challenge or set aside the sale by failing to
exercise their pre-sale remedies provided under RCW 61.24.130 and b) when
notwithstanding waiver, all of Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law.

judgment is appropriate when the record shows that there is no genuine issue of fact and that the

2

moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FRCP 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,

3

Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The moving party has the initial

4
burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477
5
6

U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); U.S. v. Carter, 906 F.2d 1375, 1376 (9th

7

Cir.1990). “A material fact is one upon which the outcome of the litigation depends.” Williams

8

v. Allstate Ins. Co. L 148678, 1 -2 (W.D. Wash. 2010). When a properly supported motion for

9

summary judgment is made, the burden then shifts and the opposing party must set forth specific

10
11

facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.
Factual disputes whose resolution would not affect the outcome of the suit are irrelevant

12
13
14

to the consideration of a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In other words, “summary judgment

15

should be granted where the non-moving party fails to offer evidence from which a reasonable

16

[fact finder] could return a [decision] in its favor.” Triton Energy Corp., 68 F.3d at 1220.

17

B. PLAINTIFFS WAIVED MOST OF THEIR CLAIMS AND ANY RIGHT TO

18

CHALLENGE THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS OR SALE BY FAILING TO

19
EXERCISE THEIR PRESALE REMEDIES.
20
21

The Washington Deed of Trust Act (“DTA”) has been construed to promote three distinct

22

goals, which include 1) that the nonjudicial foreclosure process should be efficient and

23

inexpensive; 2) that the process should result in interested parties having an adequate opportunity

24

to prevent wrongful foreclosure; and 3) that the process should promote stability of land titles.

25

Plein v. Lackey, 149 Wn.2d 214, 225, 67 P.3d 1061, 1067 (2003) (citing Cox v. Helenius, 103

Wn.2d 383, 387, 693 P.2d 683 (1985)). Under Washington law, the failure to take advantage of

1

the presale remedies as provided by the DTA results in waiver of the right to object to the sale

2

where a party 1) received notice of the right to enjoin the sale, 2) had actual or constructive

3

knowledge of a defense to foreclosure prior to the sale, and 3) failed to bring an action to obtain

4
a court order enjoining the sale. Plein v. Lackey, 149 Wn.2d 214, 227, 67 P.3d 1061, 1067 (2003)
5
6

(citing Country Express Stores, Inc., 87 Wn. App. at 749-51, 943 P.2d 374; Steward v. Good, 51

7

Wn. App. 509, 515-17, 754 P.2d 150 (1988); Koegel v. Prudential Mut. Sav. Bank, 51 Wn. App.

8

108, 114, 752 P.2d 385 (1988); Peoples Nat'l Bank of Wash. v. Ostrander, 6 Wn. App. 28, 491

9

P.2d 1058 (1971)).

10
11

Washington courts have held that the waiver doctrine applied in this context serves all
three goals of the DTA in that adequate remedies to prevent wrongful foreclosure exist in the

12
13
14
15

presale remedies, and finding waiver in these circumstances furthers the goals of providing an
efficient and inexpensive foreclosure process and promoting the stability of land titles. Plein, 149
Wn.2d at 228 (citing Country Express Stores, Inc., 87 Wn. App. at 752, 943 P.2d 374).

16

To that end, the DTA provides a specific procedure for stopping a trustee’s sale. Plein v.

17

Lackey, 149 Wn.2d 214, 225, 67 P.3d 1061, 1067 (2003). The procedure requires that, in

18

addition to filing a lawsuit, the party must move “to restrain” a trustee’s sale “on any proper

19
ground.” Id. at 225. “However, a court cannot grant a ‘restraining order or injunction to restrain a
20
21

trustee’s sale’ unless the person seeking the order has provided five days' notice to the trustee of

22

the attempt to seek the order.” Id. at 226; RCW 61.24.130(1), (2). This statutory procedure is

23

“the only means by which a grantor may preclude a sale once foreclosure has begun with receipt

24

of the notice of sale and foreclosure.” Id. at 226 (citing Cox, 103 Wn.2d at 388, 693 P.2d 683).

25

Moreover, bringing a suit objecting to the alleged default or to the foreclosure proceedings

26

without obtaining a restraining order does not prevent the sale from going forward. Id. at 227.

1

Additionally, the Court of Appeals in considering the same issues as presented in this

2

case held that by failing to request a preliminary injunction or restraining order enjoining a

3

nonjudicial foreclosure sale at least five days before the sale date, a borrower also waives claims

4
for damages. Brown v. Household Realty Corp., 146 Wn. App. 157, 160, 189 P.3d 223 (2008).
5
The Washington State Legislature created a limited exception to the general rule when it

6
7

enacted RCW 61.24.127, which provides in pertinent part:
(1) The failure of the borrower or grantor to bring a civil action to enjoin a
foreclosure sale under this chapter may not be deemed a waiver of a claim for
damages asserting:
(a) Common law fraud or misrepresentation;
(b) A violation of Title 19 RCW; or
(c) Failure of the trustee to materially comply with the provisions of this
chapter.

8
9
10
11
12

RCW 61.24.127.

13
Here, Plaintiffs’ attempt to restrain the sale was deficient. Plaintiffs did not properly
14
15

serve the lawsuit or notice the foreclosing trustee. See Dkt. 5, 8, 12, and 13. Therefore no

16

Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction was in effect to restrain the sale.

17

Plaintiffs had notice of their right to enjoin as provided in the recorded Notice of Sale, and given

18

that they sent numerous letters to Defendant NWTS1 asserting their “alleged defenses” to the

19

foreclosure, Plaintiffs’ deficient attempt to enjoin prior to the sale resulted in waiver of

20

Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act

21
(“RESPA”) violations, Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) violations, and Intentional Infliction of
22
23
24

Emotional Distress (“IIED”) claims and limits Plaintiffs’ right to any damages for their fraud
claim to monetary damages only.

C. NOTWITHSTANDING WAIVER, WELLS FARGO IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY

2

JUDGMENT BECAUSE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS FAIL AS A MATTER OF LAW. .

3

1.

Wells Fargo owes no fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs on which to base tort

4
claims.
5
6

A breach of fiduciary duty may impose tort liability. Restatement (Second) of Contracts

7

sec. 193 (1983); Tedvest Arginomics VI v. Tedmon Prop. V, 49 Wn. App. 605, 607, 744 P.2d 648

8

(1987). Whether a legal duty exists is a question of law. Hansen v. Friend, 118 Wn.2d 476, 479,

9

824 P.2d 483 (1992).

10
11

The general rule in Washington is that a lender [its successors, assigns, or designated loan
servicer] is not a fiduciary of its borrower. Miller v. U.S. Bank of Wash., 72 Wn. App. 416, 426,

12
13
14

865 P.2d 536 (1994). Rather, a special relationship must develop between the parties before a
fiduciary duty exists. Id. at 427. Where the parties deal with each other at arm’s length, such as a

15

borrower-lender relationship, no fiduciary duty arises. Interstate Production Credit Assoc. v.

16

MacHugh, 61 Wn. App. 403, 411 (1991).

17
18

Wells Fargo is an assignee under the Deed of Trust and the current beneficiary. Nothing
suggests nor have the Plaintiffs asserted a special relationship exists between Plaintiffs and Wells

19
Fargo such that a fiduciary duty would arise. As no fiduciary duty exists on the part of Wells
20
21
22
23
24
25
26

Fargo, Wells Fargo is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of
fiduciary duty.
2.

Wells Fargo owes no loan origination duties to Plaintiffs on which to base
tort claims.

The majority of Plaintiffs’ claims, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty,
negligence, and IIED, appear to be based on transactions, disclosures, and documentation which

1

occurred before and during the Pierce Commercial Bank loan closing. Dkt. 4. That closing

2

occurred nearly two years before Wells Fargo acquired its beneficial interest by Assignment in

3

December 2009. Pre-closing duties are owed to the borrower by the loan originator, not by the

4
later loan owner and/or servicer. Subsequent owners and servicers cannot owe such duties
5
6

because they had no involvement in processing the borrower’s loan application, providing

7

information to underwriting departments, and providing information or documentation to the

8

borrower at closing.

9
10
11

If the plaintiff fails to allege or establish that the defendant was involved in another
entity’s loan marketing or solicitation, then he cannot establish that defendant’s liability for
deceptive or wrongful acts or practices. White v. Homefield Fin’l., Inc., 545 F.Supp.2d 1159,

12
13
14

1169 (W.D.Wash. 2008). Consequently, Plaintiffs’ tort claims against Wells Fargo fail as a
matter of law. Additionally, as discussed above, these claims are waived.

15

3.

16

The reasons Plaintiffs have no viable tort claims are addressed above. Even if Plaintiffs

17

could state such claims, however, recovery is barred by the Economic Loss Rule. In Alejandre v.

18

Plaintiffs are barred from recovering economic losses in a tort action.

Bull, 159 Wn.2d 674, 153 P.3e 864 (2007), the Washington State Supreme Court discussed the

19
rule:
20
21
22

The economic loss rule applies to hold parties to their contract remedies when
a loss potentially implicates both tort and contract relief. It is a device used to
classify damages for which a remedy in tort or contract is deemed
permissible, but are more properly remediable only in contract…

23
24
25

The rule “prohibits plaintiffs from recovering in tort economic losses to which
their entitlement flows only from contract” because “tort law is not intended
to compensate parties for losses suffered as a result of a breach of duties
assumed only by agreement.”

1

Id. at 681-82 (citations omitted). Alejandre v. Bull involved a sale of real property. Because the

2

claims were within the parties’ real estate contract, the Economic Loss Rule prevented any tort

3

recovery. Id. at 677, 686. The Court concluded:

4
In short, the purpose of the economic loss rule is to bar recovery for alleged
breach of tort duties where a contractual relationship exists and the losses are
economic losses. If the economic loss rule applies, the party will be held to
contract remedies, regardless of how the plaintiff characterizes the claims.

5
6
7
8

Id. at 683.
In this case, there are contracts between Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo (the note, Deed of

9
Trust, and Assignment) that govern the parties’ relationship. The Economic Loss Rule precludes
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

recovery for non-economic losses arising from Plaintiffs’ tort claims; accordingly, those claims
fail as a matter of law.
4.

Plaintiffs’ TILA claim is barred by the statute of limitations and therefore
fails as a matter of law.

Plaintiffs’ TILA claim is barred by its one year statute of limitations. TILA provides,
“Any action under this section may be brought…within one year of the occurrence of the
violation.” 15 U.S.C. sec. 1640(e); Hubbard v. Fidelity Fed. Bank, 91 F.3d 75, 79 (9th Cir. 1996).

18
19

In a related case alleging inaccurate disclosures and faulty rescission notices, the court held

20

TILA’s one year limitation period begins to run the date the loan is consummated. In re Wepsic,

21

231 B.R. 768, 775 (S.D. Cal. 1998). See also, Stevens v. Rock Springs Nat’l. Bank, 497 F.2d 307

22

(10th Cir. 1974); Cooper v. First Gov’t Mtg. and Inv. Corp., 238 F.Supp.2d 50 (D.D.C. 2002).

23
24

Plaintiffs’ TILA claim fails for a number of reasons. First, Plaintiffs assert no facts
relating to Wells Fargo in support of the TILA claim, and it appears to relate to the closing of the

25
26

loan. As Wells Fargo was not a party to the contract at closing, Plaintiffs cannot assert liability
on the part of Wells Fargo for conduct associated with the loan closing. Secondly, as discussed

1

above, Plaintiffs waived this claim. Finally, even if the Lender failed to make – or inadequately

2

make – TILA disclosures, Plaintiffs had one year from the loan closing to file their TILA claim

3

against the Lender. The loan closed on April 28, 2008, and Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on

4
August 5, 2010, which was clearly outside the one year limitation. As such, Plaintiffs’ TILA
5
6
7

claim fails as a matter of law.
5.

fails as a matter of law.

8
9
10
11

Plaintiffs’ RESPA claim is barred by the statute of limitations and therefore

RESPA requires various disclosures at loan settlement to protect the consumer. 12 U.S.C.
§ 2601, et seq. Plaintiffs’ claims arise from alleged inadequate disclosures. Similar to TILA,
RESPA also has a one year statutory limitation period for disclosure failures. Blue v. Fremont

12
13
14

Investment & Loan, 562 F.Supp.2d 33, 43-44 (D.D.C. 2008).
A claim must be brought within one year of a RESPA violation. 12 U.S.C. § 2614. The

15

limitation period begins to run at the time of closing for a RESPA claim. Snow v. First Am. Title

16

Ins. Co., 332 F.3d 356, 359-60 (5th Cir. 2003). Because Plaintiffs did not file their RESPA claim

17

until two years after the Pierce Commercial Bank loan closed, the claim is time barred.

18

6.

There is no legal requirement under Washington Law to produce the note.

19
Plaintiffs’ Complaint and other pleadings include demands for production of the original
20
21
22
23
24
25
26

note and deed of trust. This supposed requirement to produce the original note has been widely
and soundly rejected in Washington, and by all other jurisdictions which have addressed it:
In her complaint, [the plaintiff] contends that the Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC) §3-309 was violated because it was not proven that the foreclosure
trustee possessed the original note and deed of trust. … However, as this Court

Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, 618 F.Supp.2d 1184, 1187
(D.Ariz.2009) (collecting cases)). The Court finds that [the plaintiff] has failed
to state a plausible claim for relief based on Defendants’ alleged failure to
produce the original promissory note. Therefore, the Court dismisses this claim.
Wallis v. Indymac Fed. Bank, __ F.Supp.2d__, 2010 WL 2342530 (W.D.Wash.).
No Washington authority requires that a lender or servicer produce the original note to a

5
borrower for inspection at any time or in order to foreclose the mortgaged property. Accordingly,

Plaintiffs have no claim for production of the original note and loan documents.
D. PLAINTIFFS’ FRAUD CLAIM FAILS AS A MATTER OF LAW.

9

Plaintiffs’ fraud claim must meet the heightened pleading requirement set forth in FRCP

10

9(b). Rule 9(b) requires that “[i]n all averments of fraud…the circumstances constituting fraud

11
12

shall be stated with particularity.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). When pleading a civil fraud claim, a
complaint must, at a minimum, “state the time, place, and specific content of the false

13
14
15

representations as well as the identities of the parties to the misrepresentation.” See Edwards v.
Marin Park, Inc., 356 F.3d 1058, 1066 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation and quotations omitted). In

16

addition, “[s]uch allegations must define the specific involvement of the individual defendants.”

*8 (W.D.Wash. 2006). Where, as here, the complaint accuses several defendants of participating

19

in an allegedly fraudulent scheme, “Rule 9(b) does not allow a complaint to merely lump

20
multiple defendants together but require[s] plaintiffs to differentiate their allegations…and
21
22

inform each defendant separately of the allegations surrounding his alleged participation in the

23

fraud.” Swartz v. KPMG LLP, 476 F.3d 756, 764-65 (9th Cir. 2007) (citation and quotations

24

omitted). Application of these pleading standards necessitates that Plaintiffs’ fraud claim fail as a

25

matter of law as to Wells Fargo.

26

Here, Plaintiffs’ fraud claim includes no allegations of wrongdoing by Wells Fargo.

Plaintiffs’ allegations of fraud are nothing more than vague, non-specific assertions of the

2

defendants engaged in fraud. Additionally, a fraud claim under Washington law must establish

3

the following nine elements by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence: 1) Representation of an

4
existing fact; 2) Materiality of the representation; 3) Falsity of the representation; 4) The
5
6

speaker's knowledge of its falsity; 5) The speaker's intent that it be acted upon by the plaintiff; 6)

7

Plaintiff's ignorance of the falsity; 7) Plaintiff's reliance on the truth of the representation; 8)

8

Plaintiff's right to rely upon it; and 9) Resulting damages. Stieneke v. Russi, 145 Wn. App. 544,

190 P.3d 60 (Wash. Ct. App. 2008); Carlile v. Harbour Homes, Inc., 147 Wn. App. 193, 194

10
11

P.3d 280 (Wash. Ct. App. 2008), review granted in part, 210 P.3d 1019 (2009).
In this case, Plaintiffs fail to plead even one of the nine elements to state a claim for fraud

12
13
14

as to Wells Fargo. The Complaint provides no facts that support any claim for fraud and
therefore fails to apprise Wells Fargo of the underlying action that supports a claim for fraud.

15

Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim clearly does not reach the heightened standard a fraud claim is subject to

16

and fails as a matter of law.

VI.

CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, the Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. respectfully requests that

19
the Court dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint in entirety, with prejudice.
