Case 5:14-cr-00019-MFU Document 56 Filed 09/26/14 Page 1 of 5 Pageid#: 532

IN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
HARRISONBURG DIVISION

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Criminal No.: 5:14-CR-19

v.
GEORGE HENRY COVARRUBAIZ

RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO
REQUEST EVIDENTIARY HEARING
The Court should conduct the evidentiary hearing that it scheduled for Monday,
September 29, 2014, because the Court previously assured both parties it would permit
the introduction of additional evidence, and it has the discretion to do so.
The defendant insists that the only basis for Trooper Miller’s stop on February 3,
2014 was the defendant’s defective lights. However, Trooper Miller expressly testified
during the hearing on July 17, 2014, that, before the stop in question, Trooper Miller had
“received information that the vehicle could possibly be transporting a large quantity of
narcotics.” Exhibit 1 at 26. Additionally, Trooper Miller documented this same
information about a possible narcotics load in a Virginia State Police Report; in the
report, he stated “On 02-03-14, I was given information from Special Agent D.P. Cutting
with DEA regarding a commercial vehicle possibly transporting a large amount of
narcotics traveling Northbound on Interstate 81.” Exhibit 2. Trooper Miller’s report was
disclosed to the defense on May 30, 2014, long before the suppression hearing. This is
not new information.
Therefore, Trooper Miller had stated, in both writing and testimony, that before

he stopped the defendant’s vehicle on February 3, 2014, he had received information that
a vehicle possibly containing a large load of narcotics would be traveling up Interstate 81
on February 3, 2014. At the same time, however, law enforcement also had chosen to
delay revealing the source of this information (the wiretap) because the leader of the
defendant’s drug trafficking organization, Everardo Amador, had not yet been arrested in
California.

Revealing the wiretap investigation to the defendant and others before

Amador was arrested would significantly increase the likelihood of Amador’s flight, and
could endanger the safety of those involved in the investigation, as outlined in the United
States’ previous brief.
At the conclusion of the suppression hearing in this matter on July 17, 2014, the
defense requested the opportunity to file a substantive brief in support of its pending
motion to suppress. At that time, the defense had not yet filed a substantive brief that
outlined the substantive basis for its motion and its arguments. In response, the Court
granted the defense’s request to file a brief, but also assured the parties it would entertain
additional evidence and briefing at a future time.
The United States did not “waive” its right to present this additional evidence of
reasonable suspicion supporting the stop on February 3, 2014, when it simply waited to
reveal the additional evidence for the reasons outlined above. Instead, the United States
chose to reveal the source for the additional basis for the stop, which was the wiretap, at
the appropriate time for doing so: after Amador was arrested. This is not a new theory.
As detailed above, Trooper Miller has testified about this information and also wrote a
report referencing this information, which was shared with the defense. This matter is
still open because the Court has not decided the motion, and the Court has the discretion

to consider this additional evidence.
The defense cited and quoted United States v. Kithcart, 218 F.3d 213 (3rd Cir.
2000) in support of its argument that the United States should not be permitted to present
additional evidence on this motion, but Kithcart dealt with a different issue. Kithcart
dealt with the question of whether, after an appeal and upon remand, the Government
could introduce additional evidence on a motion to suppress that the Court had previously
decided.

Further, the Court in Kithcart noted that the Government provided no

explanation for why it had failed to introduce the additional evidence at issue during the
first motion to suppress hearing. Here, by contrast, the Court has not yet issued its
decision, there has been no appeal, and the Government has provide a legitimate
explanation for why it waited to provide the additional basis for the stop of the defendant
on February 3, 2014. Since the Court has not yet decided the pending motion it has the
discretion to consider additional evidence before it reaches its decision.

Finally, the United States requests a decision from the Court on this matter as
soon as is convenient for the Court. To present certain pieces of evidence during the
upcoming evidentiary hearing, a witness is flying to Virginia from California on Sunday,
September 28. Other witnesses are traveling from other cities, as well. Accordingly, the
Court’s decision on whether the hearing will occur as scheduled on Monday, September
29, will impact witness travel plans.
