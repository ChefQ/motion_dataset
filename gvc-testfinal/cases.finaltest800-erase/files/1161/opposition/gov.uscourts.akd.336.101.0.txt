Opposition to UNITED STATES' MOTION TO COMPEL

Come now, Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes
("the Hymes") with this Opposition to UNITED STATES' MOTION
TO COMPEL ("Opposition"). UNITED STATES' MOTION TO COMPEL is
hereafter ("Auchterlonie's Motion").

The Hymes did mail a complete set response to
Admissions to JENNIFER D. AUCHTERLONIE ("Auchterlonie") to
which it seems that the Department of Justice (D oJ) has
problems with losing papers either intentionally or
otherwise (not the first time in this instant Case). In
one of the D o J's mailings to the Hymes there were some
pages missing. The Hymes contacted the Do J to correct the

1

a,

 

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page2of15

problem (which was corrected), which seemed to the Hymes to
be a quite simple and direct approach to the simplistic
problem of papers missing. The Hymes attach to this
Opposition a copy of the Admissions of the Hymes being
Attachment 1 for Rita MariNa Hymes and Attachment 2 for
Donald Louis Hymes with all of the pages for Auchterlonie to
inspect. Auchterlonie never did contact the Hymes on the
purported missing pages, but instead attempts to. get
Admissions through the back door with the assistance of this
Court, which is an example of extreme bad faith on
Auchterlonie's part.

Auchterlonie complains that the Hymes did not respond
timely to the Admissions request from  Auchterlonie,
representing a yet to be determined party (parties). But
again this is another example of extreme bad faith by
Auchterlonie as responded to the Request for Admissions from
the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA within 32 days, but
Auchterlonie did not respond for 35 days with Admissions and
Interrogatories, an not for 42 days with Documents. Do the
same rules apply to Auchterlonie or are Auchterlonie and
Auchterlonie's yet to be determined Plaintiff exempted?
The Hymes have attached a copy of the e-mail sent to

Auchterlonie on March 2, 2007, being Attachment 3. Let us
remember that Auchterlonie has not responded to any of the

2
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page3of15

Hymes Request for Admissions, Interrogatories or Discovery

requests, but demands performance from the Hymes.

Auchterlonie's "2. The Responses Served by Donald L. Hymes"
including The Responses Served by Rita Hymes

Paragraph one addressed supra. to Auchterlonie's Motion
that has no pages numbers.

Auchterlonie states facts from the unknown Plaintiff to
which NOT ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE has been provided to date
under anyone's signature, but by Auchterlonie's ipse dixit
pontifications the Hymes are blessed - go and complain no
more and be compliant and complacent. In the Hymes'
Admissions, Interrogatories and Discovery Requests a demand
was made for the 23C Assessment alleged by Auchterlonie to
exist. The 23C's do exist, which is not denied by
Auchterlonie, but we are to take Auchterlonie's word and
these 23C Assessment documents are secret in bowels of the
unknown Plaintiff and not available under the discovery
rules because the 23C's in reality really don't exist, being
the truth, except in Auchterlonie's mind? But by
Auchterlonie's extreme bad faith refusal to disclose same,
who has custody of same or destroyed same; therefore,
Auchterlonie admits no evidence or ultimate facts in support
of Auchterlonie's ipse dixit pontifications that any

assessment exists arising under any Law of the United

3
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page4of15

States, which of course does not exclude the Administrative

State or the Land of Oz presumably.

Where is any evidence of any "federal tax liabilities"
and what does that term mean? Congress only has the
authority to enact "Laws of the United States" in Article
VI, so what law subjects the Hymes to any "federal tax
liabilities?" If Auchterlonie would have answered the
Request for Admissions, Interrogatories and provided
discovery as required, the Hymes could have been enlightened
to assist them in answering. Instead Auchterlonie provided
no signature to the Interrogatories requested by the Hymes
and answered the Admissions with extreme bad faith responses
with this being a couple of examples, to wit:

"The United States further objects to this request on
the ground that it is vague, ambiguous, and utterly
unintelligible; thus, it is incapable of being answered"

Or;

"The United States further objects to this request on
the ground that it improperly seeks an opinion, contention,
or conclusion of law, and/or asks the United State for an
interpretation of a document that speaks for itself,.
Without waiving or in any way limiting any objection the
United States has or might have to this request, the United

States admits that the Treasury Regulation cited herein
references the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 552.

Or;

The United States further objects to this request that
it contains argumentative, scandalous, indecent, and
impertinent matter calculated to annoy, embarrass, and
oppress the United States in the eyes of the Court, the
ultimate fact finder at the trial of this matter, the news
media, and the public all in violation of the principles

4
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page5of15

expressed in the Rules of Civil Procedure 7(b) (2), 11,
12(f) and 26. In particular, the request contains shopworn,
tax-

protestor rhetoric that has been unequivocally and
repeatedly rejected by the courts. The United States
further objects to this request on the ground that it
improperly seeks a conclusion of law, asks the United States
for an interpretation of a document that speaks for itself,
and contains an inaccurate statement of the law. The United
States further objects to this request on the ground that it
is vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and utterly unintelligible;
this, it is incapable of being answered.

Then Auchterlonie labels the Hymes as each being a
"taxpayer", being another extreme bad faith ipse dixit
pontification, proceeding then to Auchterlonie's desired
conclusion. To be a "taxpayer" there are many essential
elements that Auchterlonie should have presented to leap to
her conclusion.

Only "individuals" are taxed under 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1 as
held in In re Myriand, 209 B.R. 524, 526 (1997). Who is
an "individual" and are the Hymes each an "individual?"
Who is an "individual" is conclusively defined in 5 U.S.C.
0x00A7 552a(2) "(2). The term "individual" means a citizen of
the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent residence." Alien is immediately eliminated as
a matter of law.

Next, the Hymes would have to each be a "citizen of the
United States" which is conclusively defined by Congress'

grant to the fictional status as "citizen of the United

5
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page6of15

States" in 42 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A70x00A7 1981, 1982 and 1988 with Title
24 being of the Revised Statutes of 1878. The Hymes have
attached the following first: Attachment 4, being a copy
of 42 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1981; and second, Attachment 5, being a
copy of 42 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1982; and third, being Attachment 6,
being a copy of 42 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1988; and fourth, Attachment
7, being a copy of Title XXIV of the Revised Statutes of
1878 in 42 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1988.
Auchterlonie has provided no evidence that the Hymes
have surrendered their citizen birthright, jus soli, as a
"citizen of the United States of America" who has
inalienable rights for a fictional status created by
Congress in which Congress was not granted any legislative
Power arising under the Constitution of the United States
in which Congress can't give, regulate or prescribe his
capacities as evidenced in 42 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A70x00A7 1981, 1982 & 1988,
Supra., and as held for naturalized citizens also in Osborn
v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738, 827 (1824), to
wit:

A naturalized citizen is indeed made a citizen under an act
of Congress, but the act does not proceed to give, ta
regulate, or to prescribe his capacities. He becomes a
member of the society, possessing all the rights of a native
citizen, and standing, in the view of the constitution, on
the footing of a native. The constitution does not authorize
Congress to enlarge or abridge those rights. The simple
power of the national Legislature, is to prescribe a uniform
rule of naturalization, and the exercise of this power
exhausts it, so far as respects the individual. The
constitution then takes him up, and, among other rights,
extends to him the capacity of suing in the Courts of the
United States, precisely under the same circumstances under
6
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page7 of 15

which a native might sue. He is *828 distinguishable in
nothing from a native citizen, except so far as the
constitution makes the distinction. The law makes none.

And further, if Congress makes a grant of the fictional
status of a "citizen of the United States, Congress can
withhold all remedies, grant only administrative remedies,
grant legal remedies only after administrative remedies.
This is clearly held in the adjudged decisions of the
Supreme Court of the United States in which this Court is

bound to follow with the holdings being in United States v.

Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 331 (1919), to wit:

[1] [2] These general rules are well settled: (1) That the
United States, when it creates rights in individuals against
itself, is under no obligation to provide a remedy through the
courts. United States ex rel. Dunlap v. Black, 128 U. S. 40, 9
Sup. Ct. 12, 32 L. Ed. 354; Ex parte Atocha, 17 Wall. 439, 21 L.
Ed. 696; Gordon v. United States, 7 Wall. 188, 195, 19 L. Ed.
35; De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419, 431, 433, 18 L. Ed.
700; Comegys v. Vasse, 1 Pet. 193, 212, 7 L. Ed. 108. (2) That
where a statute creates a right and provides a special remedy,
that remedy is exclusive. Wilder Manufacturing Co. v. Corn
Products Co., 236 U. S. 165, 174, 175, 35 Sup. Ct. 398, 59 L.
Ed. 520, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 118; Arnson v. Murphy, 109 U. S. 238,
3 Sup. Ct, 184, 27 L. Ed. 920; Barnet v. National Bank, 98 U. S.
555, 558, 25 L. Ed. 212; Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v.
Dearing, 91 U. S. 29, 35, 23 L. Ed. 196. Still the fact that the
right and the remedy are thus intertwined might not, if the
provision stood alone, require us to hold that the remedy
expressly given excludes a right of review by the Court of
Claims, where the decision of the special tribunal involved no
disputed question of fact and the denial of compensation was
rested wholly upon the construction of the act. See Medbury v.
United States, 173 U. S. 492, 198, 19 Sup. Ct. 503, 43 L. Ed.
779; Parish v. MacVeagh, 214 U. S. 124, 29 Sup. Ct. 556, 53 L.
Ed. 936; McLean v. United States, 226 U. S. 374, 33 Sup. Ct.
122, 57 L. Ed. 260; United States v. Laughlin (No. 200), 249 U.
S. 440, 39 Sup. Ct. 340, 63 L. Ed. 696, decided April 14, 1919.
But here Congress has provided:

'That any claim which shall be presented and acted on under

authority of this act shall be held as finally determined, and

shall never thereafter be reopened or considered.'

These words express clearly the intention to confer upon the
7
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page 8of15

Treasury Department exclusive jurisdiction and to make its
decision final. The case of United States v. Harmon, 147 U. S.

268,

13 Sup. Ct. 327, 37 L. Ed. 164, strongly relied upon by

claimants, has no application. Compare D. M. Ferry & Co. v.
United States, 85 Fed. 550, 557, 29 C. C. A. 345. [Emphasis
added]

And further the holding of the Supreme Court of the

United States being in futun v. United States, 270 U.S. 568,

576,

577 (1926), to wit:

Tf the proceeding were not a case or controversy within the
meaning of article 3, s 2, this delegation of power upon the
courts would have been invalid. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, 1 L.
Ed. 436; United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 14 L. Ed. 42;
Muskrat v. United States, 31 S. Ct. 250, 219 U. S. 346, 55 L. Ed.
246. Whether a proceeding which results in a grant is a judicial
one does not depend upon the nature of the thing granted, but upon
the nature of the proceeding which Congress has provided for
securing the grant. The United States may create rights in
individuals against itself and provide only an administrative
remedy. United States v. Babcock, 39 S. Ct. 464, 250 U. S. 328,
331, 63 L. Ed. 1011. It may provide a legal remedy, but make
resort to the courts available *577 only after all administrative
remedies have been exhausted. Compare New Orleans v. Paine, 13 S.
Ct. 303, 147 U. S. 261, 37 L. Ed. 162; United States v. Sing Tuck,
24 S. Ct. 621, 194 U. S. 161, 48 L. Ed. 917; American Steel
Foundries v. Robertson, 43 S. Ct. 541, 262 U. S. 209, 67 L. Ed.
953. It may give to the individual the option of either an
administrative or a legal remedy. Compare Clyde v. United States,
13 Wall. 38, 20 L. Ed. 479; **427Chorpenning v. United States, 94
U. S. 397, 399, 24 L. Ed. 126. Or it may provide only a remedy.
Compare Turner v. United States, 39 S. Ct. 109, 248 U. S. 354, 63
L. Ed. 291. Whenever the law provides a remedy enforceable in the
courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and
that remedy is pursued, there arises a case within the meaning of
the Constitution, whether the subject of the litigation be
property or status. A petition for naturalization is clearly a
proceeding of that character.

The petitioner's claim is one arising under the Constitution and
laws of the United States. The claim is presented to the court in
such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon it.
The proceeding is instituted and is conducted throughout according
to the regular course of judicial procedure. The United States is
always a possible adverse party. [Emphasis added]

And further the holding in the Court of Appeals of

8
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 PageQof15

Arizona in Allen v. Graham, 446 P.2d 240, 243 (1968) ,

to wit:

Welfare benefits are grants by the legislature which has
delegated to the Department of Public Welfare the power to
determine the recipients of such grants. Under such
circumstances, i.e., when the state creates rights in individuals
against itself, it is not bound to provide a remedy in the courts
and may withhold all remedy or it may provide an administrative
remedy and make it exclusive, however mistaken its exercise.
Dismuke v. United States, 297 U.S. 167, 56 S.Ct. 400, 80 L.Ed. 561
(1936); United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 39 S.Ct. 464, 63
L.Ed. 1011 (1919); Blanc v. United States, 140 F.Supp. 481

(E.D.N.Y.1956). [Emphasis added]

And further under the adjudged decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States in Cook v. Gralike, 531 U.S. 510,
528 (2001), it clearly is held that the National Legislature
(Congress) enacts laws which bind the people as
"individuals" and not as citizens of any of the several
States or as people of the these United States, to wit:

The idea of federalism is that a National Legislature enacts laws
which bind the people as individuals, not as citizens of a State;
and, it follows, freedom is most secure if the people themselves,
not the States as intermediaries, hold their federal legislators
to account for the conduct of their office. [Emphasis added]

Unfortunately Auchterlonie's ipse dixit pontifications
do not overturn or declare the holdings of the Supreme Court
of the United States void and vacated - do they?

And further, if Auchterlonie has any evidentiary facts
or ultimate facts on the Hymes being each a "taxpayer", by
operation of law, then under 26 CFR 0x00A7 601.201 there must
exist said determination of the Hymes each being a
"taxpayer." But Auchterlonie has refused to disclose this

9

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 101 Filed 04/02/2007 Page 10of 15

determination by the IRS or any determination to the
Hymes, which must exist, otherwise Auchterlonie is by her
ipse dixit statements under her signature conclusively
attempting to commit fraud upon this Court.

Auchterlonie makes statement as evidently as a matter
of law that the Hymes are "as a taxpayer himself", without
providing one piece of Auchterlonie ipse dixit findings in
the land of Oz.

Auchterlonie has presented to the Hymes craftily worded
requests as words in the Admissions, Interrogatories and
discovery that are terms used by the IRS and the unknown
Plaintiff to entrap the Hymes. Hymes has relied upon the
courts to declare or clarify the law. If that has been
abrogated to Auchterlonie, then now is the time to declare
same on the record. The following is what the Hymes relied
upon concerning Auchterlonie's Requests for the unknown
Plaintiff.

"It is well settled law that only the judicial
department declares the law as held and pronounced in
adjudged decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) "(i)t is
emphatically the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is." See also United States
v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000); Plaut v. Spendthrift
