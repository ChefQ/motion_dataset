UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
SOUTHERN MARYLAND
NORMAN WILLIAMS, et aI.,
Plaintiffs,
v.
Case No:8: 14-CV-03 124-TDC

ROMARM S.A.,
Defendant.

PLAINTIFFS' OPPOSITION TO DEtr'ENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiffs, Norman Williams and Diane Howe, as Legal Representatives of J.H.,
Kevin Attaway and Jamel Blakeley file their Opposition to Romarm's Rule 12 Motion
to Dismiss.
This case was re-filed in the local Maryland Circuit Court, pursuant to Maryland
Rule 2-101, Maryland's Savings Statute, after the case was dismissed for lack of personal

jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and affirmed
on appeal at the District of Columbia Circuit on August 18,2014 in the same styled case

of Williams, et al. v. Romarm S.A., in 756F.3d777 (D.C. Cir.2014).
This case arises from discharges of a Romarm S.A. (Romarm) AK-47 style
assault weapon (WASR

l0) killing J.H.

and injuring Plaintiffs Attaway and Blakeley

on the streets of Washington, D.C. in March 2010. Romarm admits that the incident

weapon in this case originated in the State of Maryland.Dkt.6;5ll4ll2lAm.Mot.Dism.

Maryland...").

I.

TWO (2) JURISDICTIONAL STANDARDS ARE PRESENTED FOR
THIS COURT TO ASSUME JURISDICTION IN THIS CASE
Two (2) jurisdictional standards are presented to determine whether this Court

may assume jurisdiction over this case. (1) Whether Romarm, which by its admission,
claims to be an arm of the Romanian government, i.e., an integral part of the
government, requiring this Court to assume jurisdiction based on the Foreign Sovereign

Immunity Act (FSIA). Its only condition being that Romarm has been served process and
then subject matter jurisdiction, including personal jurisdiction, is assumed.

If altematively, it is discovered that Romarm

acts separately from the

Romanian government, and as such, is an independent "agency or instrumentality" of that
government, not acting on its behalf, it must be granted constitutional due process, as

would be granted any private party.

At this stage of the proceedings, where only

a

Motion to Dismiss has been

presented and no discovery has occurred, Plaintiffs have only

aprimafacle burden

to prove jurisdiction on both jurisdictional altematives presented.
Under either of the above circumstances for

a

primafacie showing that this Court

must assume jurisdiction we have a starting point to answering that question from

Romarm's website attached as Ex. A to Plaintiffs' opening Complaint in the Circuit
Court for Prince George's County before the case was removed here.
This is what Romarm S.A. claims to be, in pertinent part:
The Romanian National Company ROMARM S.A. is a modem
Holding structure with 100% Romanian state own(sic) capital,
under the authority of Ministry of Industry and Resources. With
a long tradition in the Defence Industry, materialized in an
in an experience of over 75 years in military production .. .

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 3 of 29

Romarm's statement corresponds to Plaintiffs' Complaint No. 7 which states in part:
Defendant, Romarm, is a 100% state owned organ of the Romanian
government, and as such, is a "foreign state" for purposes of the IFSIA]
and'personaljurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim
for relief over which the [ocal] or district courts'have [subject matter]
jurisdiction under' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1603 (a) and where 'service has been
made under' Sec. 1608.

II.

THE FORMER CASE, DISMISSED ON JURISDICTIONAL
GROUNDS, DOES NOT PRECLUDE JURISDICTION HERE
The re-filing of Williams, et aI. v. Romarm S.A., after dismissal in the District

Court and D.C. Circuit on jurisdictional grounds, is not preclusive here for two (2)
reasons: (1) Romarm's "foreign state" status for automatic jurisdiction, was ruled by the

D.C. Circuit that "[h]owever weighty this argument might be..." because it had not been
steadfastly pursued it was not considered. Williams v. Romarm S.A., 756 F.3d777,782

(D.C.Circuit20l4)
(2) Having construed Romarm's status as that of an independent entity owed due
process, the appellate court in the former case found that no jurisdiction was available

the District of Columbia. The Circuit's position was stated briefly as follows:

Appellants must allege conduct specific to the forum in some way.
Yet the only District-specific information Appellants proffer is that
soze Romarm-manufactured weapons have ended up in the District
through criminal traffrcking. Here, we do not even have the isolated
sale that Nicastro found insufficient... this cannot satisfu due process.
Williams, at785 (emphasis in text) (Nicastro found that one sale was
insufficient for due process purposes.)
Obviously, the basis for the Circuit's opinion before was that assault weapons
cannot be sold into the District of Columbia to satisfu due process considerations.
Whereas in the State of Maryland, where such weapons are profuse,

it is because they

can be legally sold into this forum. Once discovery can be conducted, how extensive
J

in

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 4 of 29

Romarm's product reach this market, will easily determine that its reach is far beyond
a

"single product" that reached the forum in Nicastro with its due process implications.
Consequently, under either theory presented: Whether.it be Romarm's

governmental connection, having not been considered in the court before, or that

Romarm's due process, when considered as a private corporation, protected it when there
were no reported sales into the District of Columbia where such arms are prohibited.
Here, the jurisdictional facts and theories of Romarm's relationship to the

Romanian govemment and its relation to this forum for due process purposes are on a

vastly different plain. First, Plaintiffs' Complaint steadfastly alleges that "Romarm,
is a 100% state owned organ of the Romanian govemment, and as such, is a'foreign
state' for purposes of the [FSIA], and '[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall
exist as to every claim for relief over which the flocal] or district courts have [subject
matter] jurisdiction under' 28U.S.C.Sec. 1603(a) and 'where service is has been made
under Sec. 1608.' " Comp. no. 7
Secondly, it is alleged that "Romarms [sales] have a'direct effect' in the United
States" (Comp. no. 8) and most critically, the incident weapon in this case was
"transported from Maryland". Comp. 4

With these allegations and admissions that are forthcoming below, it is
indisputable that the incident weapon was sold into Maryland and if that is so, the
inference that similar assault weapons were sold here as well into the Maryland market

to support jurisdiction, either Subject Matter Jurisdiction under the FSIA for "foreign
gtates" or to supply Personal Jurisdiction for due process protection, ifneeded upon a

finding that Romarm is classified as a private corporation, apart from the Romanian
4

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 5 of 29

govenrment in the early stages of these proceedings when aprimafacie showing is all
that is needed.

III.

VENUE IS PROPER IN MARYLAND WHERE TIIE 'ACT' OR
.OMISSION' OCCURRED AND IS LEAD PLAINTIFF'S DOMICILE

A "substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred" is
supportable in Maryland through 28 U.S.C.1391(bX2);(e)(2). The Code caries a catch-all
venue wherever the defendant can be found,

if there is no other district where the action

may be otherwise brought. 28 U.S.C. 1391(bX3). The FSIA code citation is to 28 U.S.C.
1603(a)(1).
Through negligence of one or more of Maryland licensed dealers, purchasing the
weapon at issue in this case and the fact that an abnormally dangerous product is an
attraction for the illegal element to steal Romarm's products and transport it into the

neighboring District of Columbia, supports allegations of negligence and public nuisance
as "acts" leading to death and

injury. See Comp. 18,

19.

In further support of the Maryland forum, is that lead Plaintiff, Norman Williams,
the father and Legal Representative of his deceased son, J.H., is where he is domiciled

for the past 34 years. Ex. A (by Certification) Williams temporary residence in the

District of Columbia, as shown by an earlier address, notwithstanding.

IV.

PLAINTIFF KEYIN ATTAWAY AND JAMEL BLAKELEY WERE
MOVED INTO THE CASE UNDER THE RULES WHICH RELATES BACK
Plaintiffs Kevin Attaway and Jamel Blakeley were moved into the case by

a

Motion for Leave of Court to Amend [the] Pleadings and Join Similarly Situated Parties,
through Fed.R.Civ.P 15(a) and20 in the former action and re-filed here. Dkt.17;
1010312012. Due to an

eror in formatting

the motion, for failure to furnish the Court

with

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 6 of 29

a copy

of the original pleadings attached to the Motion for Leave, it was temporarily

stricken. Although a copy of the original pleadings was already before the Court.

Significantly,2SU.S.C. Sec.2072states: "A local rule must be consistent with
Acts of Congress." Advisory Committee Notes and its 1995 Amendment, Subsection (a)
state:

"It

is the intent of this rule that a local rule may not bar any practice that these rules

explicitly or implicitly permit."
Although the Amendment may have not complied with the Local Rules it did not
violate the Federal Rules of Procedures for amending parties into the case, which was

timely filed in the former U.S. District Court case of Williams, et al v. Romarm S.A.
Dkt.17;10/0312012.
Even though the pleading requirements were incomplete, the Motion for Joinder

would still relate back under Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Procedure which provides
that "[a]n amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when

... the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,
transaction, or occulrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the

original pl eadingl.)" (emphasis added)
Consequently, Defendant Romarm, was provided adequate notice of their entry

into the case and they should be admitted in the re-filing nunc pro tunc.Plaintiffs,
Attaway and Blakeley's injuries arose from the same Romarm weapon which killed J.H.,
and is causally linked to his death. Their injuries belong to a common nucleus

V.

ROMARM'S ALLEGATION THAT IT WAS NEVER SERVED
PROCESS IS FALSE AND IT CONCEDED SERVICE IN THE
SECOND RE.FILING OF THE CASE IN THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA
Romarm's allegation that it was never served in the first filing of this case, in the

Superior Court of the District of Columbia is false. See Line3-4Def.Mem.,

at2.In fact,

Romarm personally "Answered" the Complaint by filing a response to the Superior Court
and to Plaintiffs' counsel. Wherein Romarm states: "We National Company

ROMARM

S.A. ... respond within the legal complaint filed by NORMAN WILLIAMS, DIANE
HOWE, ecc., registered in Superior Court of District of Columbia, Civil Divisioin with
No. 201

| C42349..."Ex.C

(Romarm's pro se Response to Complaiant)

This "Answer" comports with the Memorandum Opinion of Judge Emmet

Sullivan, after the case was removed to the District Court for the District of Columbia as
1:12-CV-00436-EGS in confirming service in a footnote of his Opinion: "Defendant does
not contest that service was properly made." Mem.Opin., at 8, ftn.3
Considering that the U.S. District Court case, Judge Sullivan presiding, was the
second case filed after the

initial filing in the Superior Court where Defendants failed to

object to service from the initial filing, it can be concluded that the Defendant has
conceded and waived any additional service. Now that the case has been re-filed here,

Romarm is hardly in a position at this stage of the proceedings to revoke its consent to
service at this late date after having conceded and waived it in the District of Columbia

re-filing.
Notably here, the same lead attomey representing Romarm in the earlier case
has noticed the court he intends to enter this case againpro hoc vice. The local law

office

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 8 of 29

petitioning him in will be the law firm with the same attorney who acted as local
attorney in the former case as the same attorneys continue to represent Romarm

throughout all of proceedings. Further, the New Jersey attorney, Anthony Pisciotti, who
argued the former case was served by registered mail at his address and did not decline

to represent Romarm in the latest re-filing.

VI.

OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS FOR JURISDICTION
RE,QUIRE,S ONLY A PRIMA FACIE BURDEN IF NO DISCOVERY

At issue in this case is whether jurisdiction over Romarm is assumed through
the FSIA's statutory subject matter jurisdiction, with personal jurisdiction, as service

of

process has been completed or conceded. Under the FSIA Romarm's activity must have

only a statutory "direct effect" or "substantial contact" with the United States for there to
be an assumption

ofjurisdiction over this case. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1605 (a)(2)

Despite the fact that it sells its weaponry at the point of origin in Romania to its
exclusive United States distributor, Century, for it to be marketed throughout the United
States, including Maryland (but excluding the District of Columbia)

it is sufficient to

warrant jurisdiction at the pre-discovery stage. As Plaintiffs' showing ofjurisdiction
remains limited to only aprimafacie burden to prove jurisdiction. See MWANI v.

BIN LADEN, 417 F.3d

1,7 (D.C.Cir. 2005).

("[plaintiffs] may rest their argument on

their pleadings, bolstered by affidavits and other written materials as they can otherwise
obtain.")

It

stands to reason that there exists a distinction without a difference whether

Romarm sells to Century abroad, as opposed to here in the United States, as its
products, along with their dangerous propensity, are marketed to each of the fifty (50)

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 9 of 29

with the exception of the District of Columbia where weapons sales are banned.

If it is concluded

at this stage, tentatively, that Romarm is basically a

"foreign

state" with subject matter jurisdiction presumed, it would hardly matter what method it
uses sell and market its products, as long as they are found in the United States and

therefore have a "direct effect" or "substantial contaet" with it. That "direct effect" is felt
by U.S. citizens who are victimized by use of the weapon for the purpose it was designed,

to shoot to kill or injury human beings. Police records used in the former case showed
that "forty-one weapons manufactured by Romarm were recovered within the District

[of Columbia] during a four-year-period." Williams, at785
Under the circumstances of Romarm acting on behalf of the foreign state of
Romania, including subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to the FSIA, there is no need

to determine whether the "foreign state" has "minimal contacts" in this country for
purposes of personal jurisdiction. Because no Due Process is due.

v.Pakiston,35l F.3d 1184, 1191 (D.C.Cir.2003).

L.T. Consultants

See also 28 U.S.C. 1330(b) and 1608.

That is to say that "when a foreign sovereign controls an instrumentality to a
degree that a principal-agent relationship arises between them, the instrumentality
receives the same Due Process protection as the sovereign: 1rone." GSS

Group Ltd. v.

National Port Authority, 680 F.3d805,815 (D.C. Cir.2012) (emphasis added)
Whether an "agent or instrumentality" is so governed by its foreign state to

qualify as a "foreign state" was the issue in TMR Energy Ltd. v. State Property Fund
of Ukraine, 411 F.3d. 296,301-02 (D.C. Cir. 2005), also, and the court determined from
the record that "Ukraine had plenary control over the SPF" ... the SPF is an agent of the
State . .. and should not be treated as an independent juridical entity."
9

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 10 of 29

This is duplicative of how Romarm portrayed itself in the previous case, that

"[tlor

purposes of applying the FSIA, a company that is wholly owned by a foreign state

is considered a "foreign state" ... Further, ROMARM is completely owned by Romania
and operates under the authority of the Romanian Ministry of Economy and Commerce."

Def.Am.Mot.to Dism. Dkt.6;5

I I 4I

2012, at 2

(l: 1 2-CV-0043 6-EGS)

Admissions of Romarm's attorneys that it is a "100olo wholly owned" enterprise
is replete from those admissions made in the former case which was never resolved by
the former courts, "foreign state" status having only been belatedly argued.
Instead, the argument rested primarily on the fact that Romarm had satisfied its
due process requirements

of :minimum contacts" with the District's forum, not through

its sales, but through known criminal activity, which trafficked its weapons to the

District, from nearby states such as Maryland, where sales are legal.
The alternative issue presented is whether personal jurisdiction is achieved if it is

found on the record that Romarm is independent from the Romanian State and does not
answer to

it

as its agent.

The question then raised is whether there is "specific" personal jurisdiction due to

Romarm's "minimum contacts" with the forum, rather than the statutory "direct effect"
available under "foreign state[hood]", as found by statute through the FSIA.

As explained further in the former case between the parties,
And because foreign state is not a 'person' protected
by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,
minimum contacts between the foreign state and the
forum state are not required for a court to constitutionally
exert personal jurisdiction over the state. Williams, et al.,
v. Romarm, SA, et a1.,756F.3d777,782 (D.C.Cir.2014)
See GSS Grp Ltd , supra, at 813. (cit.om.)
10

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 11 of 29

Romarm maintains that it as an integral part of the Romanian government,
yet, at the same time, seeks due process consideration as would a private party. It's

position, as a goveflrment agent belonging to the sovereign itself is an attempt to seek
absolute immunity, without the "commercial activity" exception that leaves it vulnerable

to suit. Yet, how much closer a tie is there between this entity and the "foreign state" than
what has been proclaimed by its own attorney in its argument in the District of Columbia.

A company that is wholly owned by a foreign state is
considered a "foreign state" ... Further, ROMARM
is completely owned by Romania and operates under
the authority of the Romanian Ministry of Economy
and Commerce. (emphasis added) at2,5ll4l20l2
Dkt.6. Def.Am.Mot.Dism.

In GSS, supra, contrary to what is being represented here

as

to Romarm's

"foreign state" affiliation, defendant, Port of Authority, asserted that it was "legally
separate from the Liberian government." at 809. The D.C. Court went so far as to concur

in the Authority's argument that "the Port Authority[] manage[d] ... its own unsubsidized
finances; [had] the ability to sue and be sued in its own name, [and it had] independent

property ownership." At 809,ftn.2.

In GSS, no argument was made that the Port Authority was an agent of the
Liberian govemment, "the rule that closely-controlled instrumentalities have no due
process rights did not apply." GSS, at 810 Furthernore, to its detriment

it sought no

pretrial discovery in contrast what Williams attempted in the former proceeding.
Here, at minimum, Romarm must be brought before this court. It declares it is

"wholly owned" by the Romanian government. Any entity whose majority

shares are

owned by the foreign state qualifies it as an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state
l1

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 12 of 29

for subject matter jurisdiction purposes.

See also, GSS, at 81 I .

How closely intertwined

Romarm is to the sovereign, is at minimum, an issue that cannot be resolved on a Motion

to Dismiss' Similarly, its "minimum contacts" with the forum cannot be decided in thin
air.

Any "presumption of separateness" will easily give way if the foreign entity "is
so extensively controlled by its owner
[the foreign state] that a relationship of principal

and agent is created." GSS, at 814, citing

First National Cify Bank v. Banco para el

Commercio Exterior de Cuba, 462U.5.611,629 (19g3)
How independent is Romarm from the sovereign of Romania? What we are given
from its attomeys is that it is both a"private" entity, deserving of due process protection.
And, on the other hand, we learn that it is "wholly owned,, and,,l}}ohowned
[by the
sovereign]". The reason such contradictory arguments are so abused here is that

if

Romarm belongs to the sovereign itself, no liability may attach to the "commercial

activity" exception to the FSIA, if it can argue that its weapons cross state lines illegally.
With sovereign immunity, there would be no legal accountability in negligence,
public nuisance, or strict liability, based on its marketing strategy and inability to stop the
never ending flow of its illegal weapoffy having been sold abroad, despite its loyalty
contract with distributor, Century on after sales. Ex. D(based on a Vermont lawsuit)
On the other hand, Romarm's defeat on the "foreign state" measure,

will then

require the Court to apply the stricter constitutional due process to protect it from U.S.

jurisdiction' As it intends when its strategy is to sell its weapons, brought
to the United
States only sold to an exclusive U.S. distributor in their country of

here. Hence, a well-crafted marketing ploy which attempts to

t2

origin and not

limit its "direct contact,,

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 13 of 29

with the United States, in the hope of shielding itself from liability through lack of
jurisdiction to adjudicate, rather than defend on its liability.
Defendant's totality argument is that it must be presumed to be an "independent

entity" from the state of Romania and therefore "minimum contacts" are required for
this court to assert jurisdiction over it. Def.Mem.,at 8. If that is so, then what does

"wholly owned" by the sovereign mean? In particular when its\ claims its very existence
arises from and within the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Dkt. supra.

Its website also shows Romarm's origin to be the Defence industry of Romania,

which continues to offer speculation that the Defence Industry is manufacturing the
weapons sold here and are sharing the profits with the other government agencies,

it

has

named as its affiliates, who promote the sale of the Defence products through the brand
name Romarm. SeeEx.

VII.

A (Plaintiff s Complaint Exh. A)

PLAINTIFFS IS NOT ESTOPPED BY LAW OF THE CASE
WHERE AN ARGUMENT WAS NEVER CONSIDERED BY THE
FORMER COURTS ON THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION

Defendant, Romarm, in its Argument, at 9, places great emphasis on a "doctrine

of law" not permitting the Plaintiffs to "re-litigate an issue ... already decided" in the
former case. Although, the Defendant concentrates solely on lack of personal jurisdiction
found in the adjoining circuit court, the Defendant ignores the fact that the Plaintiffs

failed to litigate Romarm's ownership by the sovereign state of Romanian, or that it
argued

it too late to be considered by the appellate court, which allowed the critical issue

of Romarm's "foreign state" status to be waived for lack of raising it steadfastly.
Here is what the D.C. Circuit had to say about Plaintiffs' argumenl, or lack
thereof, concerning Romarm' s "forei gn state [hood] " :

l3

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 14 of 29

At oral argument, Appellants primarily challenged the district
court's conclusion that Romarm is juridically independent from
Romania and thus entitled to due process. Specifically,
Appellants pointed to a claimed "concession" by Romarm that
it is both owned and operated by Romania. This concession, they
say, establishes Romarm as a state entity that is not entitled to due
process. However weighty this argument may be, we decline to
consider it because Appellants failed to raise it in their briefs.
Williams, at782 (emphasis in text)

Williams can hardly "re-litigate" what was never, in the court's opinion,
brought to the attention of the court in a timely fashion, and not having been ruled upon
or even considered by the D.C. Circuit in its affirmance of the District Court.
What is left is the D.C. Circuit's opinion concerning personal jurisdiction over
Romarm in the District of Columbia. Commenting on Plaintiffs' request for limited
discovery to attempt to show Romarm's presence in the District of Columbia:

"Appellants have failed to allege any conduct by Romarm that was purposely directed
toward the District of Columbia." Williams, at 787 The problem being that Romarm
could not sell its weapons into the District of Columbia, while it may sell them to other

forums, including the State of Maryland.
The District Court's concern over jurisdiction in the District of Columbia stands

in stark contrast to the forum here where Romarm weapons are sold to its licensed
dealers and distributors having been distributed to the State's dealers by Romarm's

exclusive distributor Century. Under such circumstances, Romarm can be found to have
a "direct effect"

with its commercial activity, including this State, which is all that is

required by the FSIA.
Further, such "tortious acts", as negligence, may occur in this forum where the
weapons originate before reaching the District of Columbia. Although District law, D.C.

t4

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 15 of 29

Code Sec. 7-2551.02, its Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990

(SLA), provides liability for assault weapons which kill and injure its citizens in the
District of Columbia, and would be adopted by this Court under Maryland's Choice of
Law, once personal jurisdiction is found where the tortious acts occurred, responsible for
allowing weapons, such as the incident assault weapon into a forum where injuries and
death occurred.

VIII. STATUTE

OF LIMITATIONS ARE NOT A BAR TO EITHER
WRONGFULL DEATH OR SURVIVAL ACT CLAIMS
Plaintiffs re-filed their second lawsuit in the United States District Court for the

District of Columbia on March20,2012 in order for the Plaintiffs to take advantage of
the extension of the District's Wrongful Death Act which from one (1) to two (2) years
passed by the

District's City Council in a Wrongful Death Emergency Act (D.C. Code

Sec. 16-2702) two (2) days before the case was re-filed.

This law, if nothing else gave actual notice to the Defendant of the Act's passage
which had the remedial purpose of extending time for attorneys to locate the families
of victims of violence. The Emergency Act specifically focused on this case as an
example of the diffrculty in filing Wrongful Death claims within the short period of
one (1) year. Although the Act may not have been signed into law by the mayor
a month later,

it had the retroactive affect of

until

a remedial act and gave substantial notice

to

the Defendant in sufficient time to put it on notice so that evidence would be protected
when the Plaintiffs re-filed their action within 2 years of the Plaintiffs death and injury.
Defendant, Romarm, also ignores the fact that there is a 3 year Survival Act, D.C.
Code Sec. 12-101, enforceable in particular, by Plaintiffs' Williams and Howe for the
15

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 17 Filed 10/29/14 Page 16 of 29

horrendous injuries, and pain and suffering, at the time of the death of their son J.H.

(Comp.No. 16).
Furthermore, injuries to Plaintiffs, Attaway and Blakeley are also covered by
tortious injuries within the 3 year statute of limitations in the District.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs' allege there is jurisdiction in this Court, either under the FSIA,

as

Romarm is a "foreign state", or acts as its agent, and if not, under due process, as it

would be granted to a "private" person. Defendant, Romarm's, proliferation of weapons
into the U.S. market establishes its "direct effect" here, or at minimum the "minimum
contacts" necessary for specific or general jurisdiction for maintaining suit in this forum.

Liability may be alleged based on its negligence in selling its dangerous products
in Maryland, which then flow into neighboring District of Columbia, where strict liability
under the SLA, is available by adopting Maryland's Conflict of Law, or Choice of Law
considerations.

At this stage of the proceedings, where no limited jurisdictional discovery
has occurred, Plaintiffs' have only a

slightprimafacie burden to show that jurisdiction

exists in this forum, not having been considered in this Court's Sister jurisdiction of the

District of Columbia.

PLAINTITTSIMOTTOILTOR LEAVE OT COURT TO AMEND PLEADINGS
AND .IOIN SIMILART,Y SITT'ATED PARTIES
Plaintiffs, Norman Williams and Diane Howe, seek leave of court, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. p.

l5(a) and 20, to amend the pleadings and join Kevin Attaway and Jamel Btakelen whose injuries arise
out of tlrc same series of occurcnce as that of Jorden Howe, in the underlying Wrongful Death and

Sunival Act, represented by his parents

as legal reprcsentatives. I-ead attorney

for defendant,

ROMARM, Anthony Pisciotti, was contacted by e-mail for his consent, but he has refused.

LEGAL STANDARD

"[A]

party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court, or by wriuen consent of the

adverse pafly; (once a responsive pleading has been filed) and leave shall be freely given when

justice so requires." Rule

ll(a),

see also, Forman

v. Davis,3zl u.s. l7g, l9z (1962).

'"The D.C. Circuit has held that for a trial court to deny lcave to amend is an abuse of discretion
unless the court provides a sufficiently compelling rcason, such as 'undue detay, bad faith,

or

dilatory tnotive..." Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C.Cir.1996), quoting Forman, at
182 supra. The court may also deny leave to amend the complaint
the opposing party. See Forman, at lB2, supra.

Rule 20(a):

.Fed.

R. Civ. P. 20(a) provides, in part:

assert any rigbt to

"AIl

persons may

join in one action as plaintiffs if they

rcliefjointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the sarne

transaction, occulrences and

if

any question of law or fact cortmon to all persons

will

arise in the

actiotr."
As held by this court, "[t]he purpose of Rule 20 is to promote trial convenience and expedite
the final resolution of disputes, thereby preventing multiple lawsuits,

exm expense to the

parties and loss of time to ths court as well as the litigants appearing before it." M.K, v. Tenet,216

F.R.D, t33, t37 (D.D.C. 2W2).
There arc two prerequisites for joinder under Rule 20(a): ( 1) a right to relief must be asserted
by, or against, each plaintiff or defendant rclating to or arising out of the same transaction or

oceurence or series of transactions or occurrences, and (2) a question of law or fact common to all

of

the parties must arise in the action. M.K, at 138, supra.

Here, Plaintiffs, Willianrs and Howe, would satisfy the first prong of Rule 20(a), also known as
the "Eansactional test," in that the plaintiffs' claims are "logically related" events which'.ari$e out

of

the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurences." Call of the Wild Movie,

This case involves

a

claim for the shooting death of the son of the plaintiffs. It invokes

primarily the District of Columbia's Assault Weapon Manufacruring Srrict Liability Act (SLA),
D.C. Code

7'25il.AL Howe

was shot and killed by a ROMARM

AK47 weapon on March 23,2010.

The purported parties to this action were similarly shot by the same ROMARJI4 weapon, only a
weck later on March 30, 2010, while attending the funeral of Jordan Howe. The weapon had not been
confiscated in the week before thc intended parties were shot and injured after Howe's shooting.
One of the young parties, Kevin Attaway, was seriously wounded and although he survived,

may have suffered permanent injuries. The other party sought to be joined, is a member of the same

family (Jarnel Blakeley) who was shot in the back from the same weapon. Their joinder is sought
due to their personal injuries suffered as a rcsult of the same weapon used in Howe's death and the

wrongftl Death and survival Act claims brought by his legal representatives.
Witnesses to the deaths and injuries are the same. The weapon being held at the Metropolitan

Police Headquarters, used in the death and injuries a week apart, is the same assault weapon used in
both circumstances. Medical rcports, both autopsy, hospital and police, reside in the District

Columbia. The parties are intenelated due to the fact that the weapon used to

kill

of

Howe was atso used

to shoot and injure Howe's friends by the shooter's attempt to avenge an attempt on his own life
resulting from his killing of Howe a week earlier. There is no criminal activity
or gang-related activity
connected to the panies and intended parties to this action that would bar them from suit by the SLA.

Case 1:12-cv-00436-EGS Document 17 Filed 10/03/12 Page 4 of 5

STATUS OF TIIE CASE TO DATE

This case was refiled on March 21,2012,in order to comply with an extension of the
Wrongful Death Statute passed by the District of Columbia City Council for the avowed purposc of
avoiding a statutory bar of One Year io the former \Mrongful Death Statute which would have curtailed
the Howe cass filed more then One Year after his death in March 2010. The Survival Act, as are the
personal injury claims, arc not threatened due to the refiling as their statutory limitations are Three
Years each.
Once the suit was rcfiled, Defendant ROMARM, timely Answered the Complaint and later

frled for its dismissal on personal and subject matier jurisdiction grounds (ROMARM is a state entity
and jurisdiction of the latter is governed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA). Meanwhile

the Plaintiffs had attempted limited discovery based on defendants' jurisdictional objections. Later a

motioa to compel was filed. These motions have been lying dormant for several months with no action
to date by the Court.
Consequently, with the case having yet to be calendered, there can be no interference with
Court activity, nor could any prejudice inurc to the defendants by the joinder of the additional parties
on the pendbg motion here. Further, "proceeding with the [new parties'] claims as

a

single case would

no doubt promote judicial economy and efficiency as it is anticipated that much of the discovery and
depositions

will

596 F.Supp .2d

be identical for [allJ plaintiffs." Kehr Ex Rel, Kehr v. Yamalw Motor Corp,, U.S.A.,

82l,AB (S.D.N.Y. 2008)
CONCLUSION

Based on the legal standard and law or facts coolmon to the purported plaintiffs the court is

petitioned to allow l(evin Attaway and Jamal Blakeley to proceed as additional plaintiffs with similar
and interrelated claims as those already filed by lead plaintiffs Norman

Williams and Diane Howe.

Defendant.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

Plaintiffs Century Intemational Arms,Inc., and Century Arms,Inc. (collectively
"Century"), by their attomeys Gravel & Shea PC, for their Amended Complaint against M+M,
Inc. ("M*M"), allege as follows:

Introduction

1.

Century is in the business of purchasing surplus firearms from overseas and, after

remanufacturing them to be compliant with U.S. law, reselling them to licensed dealers and law
enforcement personnel.

2.

Century has enjoyed a longterm contractual relationship with C.N, Romarm S.A.

("Romarm") and its affiliated factory, S.C. Fabrica De Arme Cugir S.A. ("FAC"), including the
exclusive right to purchase certain firearms. However, Century has learned that Defendant M+M
has purchased, and continues to purchase, such firearms from Romarm and FAC.

13.

In addition to the 201I Contract, Century Arms, Inc. and Romarm/FAC entered

into a Business Promotion and Protection Agreement (the "BPPA") on March 23,2010, which
operates like an exclusivity contract. Under the BPPA, the parties agreed to be loyal to each

other and work together to promote the sale of Romanian frrearms and accessories in the United
States.

14,

Specifically, the BPPA prohibits Romarm/FAC from selling the items covered by

the agreement to other companies who would distribute them in the United States.

15,

However, at least part of the reason Romarm/FAC is not satisling the 2011

Contract's requirements is that it is violating the BPPA by selling firearms to M+M.

16.

On information and belief, Romarm/FAC has already supplied M+M with 12,405

firearms and accessories in the last eighteen months and has agreed to supply M+M with an
