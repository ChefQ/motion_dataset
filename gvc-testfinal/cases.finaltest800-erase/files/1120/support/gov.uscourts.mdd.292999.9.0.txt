Case No.: 8:14-cv-03124-TDC

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
COMES NOW Defendant Romarm S.A. (“Romarm”), by and through its undersigned
attorneys, and brings this motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint pursuant to Rule 12 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
1.
March 2010.

This case arises from criminal shootings that occurred in Washington, D.C. in
(See Dkt. No. 1-1, Plt. Compl., ¶¶ 5-6.)

Defendant Romarm “is a foreign

corporation and firearms manufacturer owned by the Romanian government and located in
Bucharest, Romania. Romarm sells its products in Romania to an American distributor that
imports them into the United States for sale.” Williams v. Romarm, S.A., 756 F.3d 777, 778
(D.C. Cir. 2014). Plaintiff alleges that Romarm manufactured a firearm that was eventually
illegally transported into Washington, D.C. and utilized to injure the plaintiffs.
2.

Plaintiffs Norman Williams and Diane Howe previously commenced a lawsuit

against Defendant in Washington, D.C., but after removal, the case was dismissed by the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. This
decision was affirmed by appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
See Williams, 756 F.3d at 777.

3.

Plaintiffs Williams and Howe are reasserting their claims and are now joined by

two new Plaintiffs, Kevin Attaway and Jamel Blakeley.

Plaintiffs commenced this post-

dismissal action in the State of Maryland, but Defendant removed the case to this Court.
4.

Defendant moves to dismiss on four separate bases: (1) lack of personal

jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2); (2) improper venue pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3); (3)
insufficient service of process pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5); and (4) failure to state a claim pursuant
to Rule 12(b)(6) for Plaintiffs Attaway and Blakeley.
5.

As will be demonstrated in greater detail in the attached memorandum, Plaintiffs

have failed to plead facts establishing that Defendant has the requisite minimum contacts with
the forum to establish due process. As recognized by the Supreme Court, and by the District of
Columbia Circuit in the prior lawsuit, the allegation that a firearm manufactured by Defendant
was transported into Maryland and then subsequently illegally transported into the District of
Columbia cannot satisfy due process. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct 2780, 2788
(2011).
6.

Additionally, venue is improper because three of the plaintiffs do not reside in

Maryland and the Complaint lacks any factual allegations establishing that a substantial part of
the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Maryland.
7.

Further, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs have never properly served Defendant,

which requires dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5).
8.

Finally, Plaintiffs Attaway and Blakeley claim to have been injured on or about

March 30, 2010. Yet, they did not file a lawsuit until September 2, 2014. Thus, under the
applicable law, their claims are barred pursuant to the statute of limitations. See Md. Cts. & Jud.
Proc. Code § 5-101.
