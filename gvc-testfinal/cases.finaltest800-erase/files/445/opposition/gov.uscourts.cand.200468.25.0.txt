Case 5:08-cv-00991-JF Document25 ~~ Filed 08/26/2008 Page 2of9

The Defendants submit the following Memorandum of Points and

Authorities in Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Dismiss the Complaint.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

This is a discovery dispute. In this one Motion are three Motions to Compel
further responses. The Defendants timely responded to discovery. Plaintiff's
counsel sent a purported "Meet and Confer" Letter. Due to the numerous items
questioned, Defendant's counsel wanted as proper protocol in this District to have

a phone conversation concerning the discovery dispute.

Instead to responding to the two requests for a phone conference sent by

Defendant's counsel, Plaintiff's counsel responded by filing this Motion.

The Declaration of Larry Rothman indicates his attempt to resolve these

Disputes. Plaintiff ignored these requests to meet and confer.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I

THE PLAINTIFF NEVER PROPERLY "MET AND CONFERRED"
PRIOR TO FILING THIS MOTION

Conference with opposing counsel requirement: Counsel are required to
"confer" in an effort to resolve disputes regarding discovery or disclosure before
bringing motions. (The conference need not be in person; a phone conference will
suffice.) The moving papers must include a certification that the movant has "in
good faith conferred or attempted to confer" with the other party in an attempt to
resolve the dispute without court action. [FRCP 37(a)(1); see Robinson v. Potter
(8th Cir. 2006) 453 F3d 990, 995-motion to compel properly denied where
moving party did not show parties had attempted to confer in good faith to resolve
discovery dispute before filing motion; Soto v. City of Concord (ND CA 1995) 162

FRD 603, 623-must attempt to have a live exchange of ideas and opinions; Tri-

 

Star Pictures, Inc. v. Unger (SD NY 1997) 171 FRD 94, 99-movant must detail
efforts to confer and explain why they proved useless; Hoelzel v. First Select Corp.
(D CO 2003) 214 FRD 634, 636-single e-mail message not a meaningful meet

and confer]

Case 5:08-cv-00991-JF Document25 ~~ Filed 08/26/2008 Page 4of9

In the California Northern District, no discovery motion will be entertained
unless counsel "have previously conferred for the purpose of attempting to resolve
all disputed issues." A willful failure to confer may result in an order for the
payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, to the other side. [ND CAI

37-1(a)]

Resolution by telephone conference: if during a discovery event, a dispute arises
that the parties are unable to resolve after good faith negotiations, counsel may
contact the judge's chambers to ask if the judge is available to address the problem

through a telephone conference. [ND CA Rule 37-1(b)]

Burden on moving party: The burden ts on the moving party to demonstrate

actual and substantial prejudice from the denial of discovery. [Jn re Sulfuric Acid

Antitrust Litig. (ND IL 2005) 231 FRD 331, 333; see Packman v. Chicago Tribune
Co. (7th Cir, 2001) 267 F3d 628, 647-denial of motion not an abuse of discretion

"absent a clear showing that the denial of discovery resulted in actual and

substantial prejudice" to moving party]

[Burden on party resisting discovery: The party opposing the motion to compel
must support each ground on which it refused discovery: "Objections asserted in a
party's initial response to discovery requests but not reasserted in response to a
motion to compel are waived and deemed abandoned." [DJRECTV, Inc. v.

Puccinelli (D KS 2004) 224 FRD 677, 681, fn. 1]

Factors considered in ruling on motion to compel: When a district court
considers a motion to compel, it must evaluate such factors as timeliness, good

cause, utility and materiality. [CSC Holdings, Inc. y. Redisi (7th Cir. 2002) 309

F3d 988, 992]

Materiality: Courts may deny motions to compel depositions that would not aid in
"the exploration of a material issue." [Jsrael Travel Advisory Service, Inc. v. Israel

Identity Tours, Inc. (7th Cir. 1995) 61 F3d 1250, 1254]

"Undue burden": A motion to compel may be denied on the ground that the
discovery sought would impose an "undue burden" on the responding party (see
FRCP 45(c)(3)(A)(iv)) or that its benefits are outweighed by its burdens (FRCP

26(b)(2)(C iii). [CSC Holdings, Inc. v. Redisi, supra, 309 F3d at 993- rejecting

"undue burden" claim]

California law sets for the meaning of "meet and confer" with respect to the
feeble claim of the Movant that he "met and conferred". Most motions made
under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2024.050 must be accompanied
by declarations describing in specific detail the reasonable and good faith efforts
that each party has made to confer and resolve informally each issue presented by
the Motion. Failure to confer is a discovery abuse. See California Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2023.010 (i). According to California Judges Benchbook:
Civil Proceedings "Discovery", Thomson West Section 202A page 40 states
"Factors that the judge should consider when determining whether each party has

made sufficient efforts to confer and resolve the issues presented by the motion

include (see Stewart v Colonial W. Agency. Inc. (2001) 87 CA 4" 1006, 1015-

1017, and Obregon v Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal. App 4" 424, 428-433.

Communications. Most judges, when examining the declarations
accompanying the motion, look first at the exchange of communications that
allegedly satisfy the statutory requirement. The law does not require a face-to-face
meeting. See California Code of Civil Procedure 20023.010(i) states that the

parties may confer by telephone or by letter.

In Obregon, Supra, the pertinent communications consisted of two letters.
The plaintiff's attorney wrote to the defendant's attorney demanding more
complete and responsive answers to numerous interrogatories; the defendant's
attorney`s reply made no concessions but invited the plaintiffs attorney to call
him. The plaintiff thereupon filed a motion to compel. In light of the
circumstances presented in Obregon, the exchange was insufficient to constitute
conferring. It was incumbent on the plaintiff's attorney to contact the defendant's

attorney again to try to resolve the issues raised by the motion.
