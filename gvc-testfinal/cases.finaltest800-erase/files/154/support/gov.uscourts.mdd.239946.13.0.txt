SAMUEL I WHITE AND SUBSTITUTE TRUSTEES MOTION TO DISMISS THE
AMENDED COMPLAINT
Comes now Robert H. Hillman and Daniel J. Pesachowitz, attorneys for the Defendants,
Samuel I. White, PC (“SIWPC”), John E. Driscoll, II, Robert E. Frazier, Jana M. Gantt, Laura D.

c.

Count III—Maryland Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), Md. Code Ann. Com.

Law §13-101, et seq.
2. That the “Amended” Complaint fails to recite any facts with specificity as to the
notice of the alleged statutory violations of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the
“FDCPA”) §§1692 et seq.; Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (MCDCA), Md. Code Ann.
Com. Law §14-201; and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), Md. Code Ann. Com.
Law §13-101, et seq., such that the Complaints fails to meet the minimum standards set forth by
the Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) for pleading.
3. That assuming arguendo, that the Court believes that the Plaintiff has met her
minimum obligations in pleading a short and plain factual statement of the claim showing that
the pleader is entitled to potential relief, the claim still fails to assert any cause of action upon
which relief can be granted as the alleged violations are not material, that she has sustain no
damages, and the SIWPC Defendants are not debt collectors under the present situation or are
statutorily exempt from being sued in the capacities they have been sued. In all the allegations
alleged to have occurred, the clear result is that there has not been any material violation of
FDPCA, or the MCDCA, and if there has, it is a technical violation without any actual damages
sustained by the Plaintiff. Indeed the Plaintiff has filed the action pro se would not entitled to
attorney fees regardless.
4. The SIWPC Defendants are not subject to the Maryland Consumer Protection Act
(MCPA) as they are acting solely pursuing the condemnation of the collateral posted as security
for a refinance money loaned loan in a State or Maryland foreclosure proceeding and are
statutorily exempt.
