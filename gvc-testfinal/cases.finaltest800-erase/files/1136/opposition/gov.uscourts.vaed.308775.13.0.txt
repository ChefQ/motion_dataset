UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
ALEXANDRIA DIVISION

MALIBU MEDIA, LLC,

CASE NO. 1:14-cv-1169-TSE/JFA

Plaintiff,
v.
JOHN DOE subscriber assigned IP address
70.109.60.2,
Defendant.

PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION AND TO QUASH THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENA
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court deny Defendant’s motion to quash because

Defendant has not provided a valid reason to quash the subpoena under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. Plaintiff
has not joined any defendants in this case and does not intend to harass or embarrass Defendant.
Indeed, if Defendant wishes to proceed anonymously in this litigation Plaintiff will not oppose it.
Plaintiff is not filing this case for any purpose other than to protect its valid copyrights.
Federal courts have consistently permitted copyright owners to identify Doe Defendants
through a Rule 45 subpoena. Here, a ruling to the contrary would undermine the rights of copyright
owners by denying them the tools necessary to identify on-line infringers. Without the ability to
identify on-line infringers, suits cannot be brought and rights cannot be enforced. For these
reasons, as more fully explained below, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny
Defendant’s motion so that it may identify the John Doe Defendant.
II.

FACTS

1

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 2 of 19 PageID# 101

A. Online Copyright Infringement Through the BitTorrent Protocol is a Serious and
Significant Threat to Plaintiff’s Business
Colette Pelissier Field, with her husband Brigham Field, are the owners of Malibu Media
and began their business from scratch. See CM/ECF 4-2 at ¶3. Ms. Field was a real estate agent
and Mr. Field was a photographer. Id. at ¶ 4. When the real estate market started heading south,
Ms. Field knew she and her husband needed to start a business together. Id. at ¶ 5. The Fields
both felt that there was a lack of adult content that was beautiful and acceptable for women and
couples. Id. at ¶ 6. The Fields wanted to create this type of content to satisfy what they hoped was
an unfulfilled demand. Id. Their goal was to create erotica that is artistic and beautiful. Id. at ¶
7. The Fields chose the name ‘X-Art’ to reflect their artistic aspirations, and began investing all
of their available money and resources into the production of content – particularly erotic movies
with high production value and a cinematic quality. Id. at ¶ 8.
Their vision has come to fruition. Currently, X-Art.com has tens of thousands of members,
but the Fields are finding it hard to grow and maintain the memberships when so many people are
finding their films for free. Id. at ¶ 15. They have worked hard and invested millions of dollars
into their business in order to produce the best quality product. Id. at ¶ 14. For the first three years
(when their site was not as popular) they did not have as many issues with piracy. Id. at ¶ 18. Now
that their videos are highly desirable, more people steal their videos than pay for a subscription.
Id. Malibu Media receives many complaints from its members asking why they should pay to
subscribe when Malibu Media’s movies are available for free through BitTorrent. Id. at ¶ 19.
Malibu Media invests significant resources into pursuing all types of anti-piracy enforcement, such
as Digital Millenium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) takedown notices and direct efforts aimed at
infringing websites. Id. at ¶ 27.

Despite sending thousands of DMCA notices per week, the

infringement continues. Id. at ¶ 28.

And, if one searches for “X-Art” on a torrent website the
2

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 3 of 19 PageID# 102

site will reveal thousands of unauthorized torrents available for free. Id. Plaintiff Malibu Media
has filed suit in this judicial District and in judicial districts across the country seeking to deter and
stop the infringement.
Defendant’s criticism of Plaintiff’s copyright protection efforts is unjustified. Indeed,
“[m]any internet blogs commenting on [these types of cases] ignore the rights of copyright owners
to sue for infringement, and inappropriately belittle efforts of copyright owners to seek injunctions
and damages.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1, 6, 13, 14 and Bryan White, 2013 WL 3038025
at n.1 (E.D. Pa. June 18, 2013). Last year, Plaintiff won the first ever BitTorrent copyright
infringement lawsuit to reach trial. See Id. In his Memorandum Report after the conclusion of the
trial, the Honorable Judge Baylson made a number of significant findings. Importantly, Judge
Baylson found “Malibu Media Malibu has satisfied its burden of proof with substantial evidence
and deserves a large award.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1, 6, 13, 14, CIV.A. 12-2078, 2013
WL 3038025 (E.D. Pa. June 18, 2013).
B. Courts throughout the Country Have Expressly Found that Malibu Media’s Counsel
do not Engage in Improper Litigation Tactics
Judge Baylson expressly emphasized that “Malibu is not what has been referred to in the
media and legal publications, and in the internet blogosphere, as a ‘copyright troll’ . . . Rather,
Malibu is an actual producer of adult films and owns valid copyrights, registered with the United
States Copyright Office, in its works.” Id. (Emphasis in original). Similarly, the Honorable Judge
Hegarty of the District of Colorado has stated: “the Court has also witnessed firsthand the
Plaintiff’s willingness to resolve cases without any monetary payment when a Defendant credibly
denies infringement.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-2, 4-8, 10-16, 18-21, 2013 WL 1777710
(D. Colo. Feb. 12, 2013).

3

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 4 of 19 PageID# 103

Other courts have also opined that the criticism Plaintiff receives is unwarranted.
“[Defendant] has not presented any evidence that Malibu has engaged in harassing behavior for
the Court to consider, nor has the Court observed bad faith behavior or the use of improper tactics
on its part thus far.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-6, 2013 WL 2150679 (N.D. Ill. May 17,
2013). See also Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-5, 2012 WL 3641291, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)
(same); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-30, 2:12-cv-13312-DPH-MJH [CM/ECF 61] at p. 15
(E.D. Mich. May 16, 2013) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. Reynolds, 2013 WL 870618 at *7 (N.D.
Ill. Mar. 7, 2013) (“the fact that suits of this nature settle quickly does not mean there is any
wrongdoing on the part of copyright owners.”); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-9, 8:12-cv00669-SDM-AEP [CM/ECF 25] at p. 7 (M.D. Fla. July 6, 2012) (same).
C. The Infringer
Defendant’s Internet was used to infringe twenty (20) of Plaintiff’s copyrighted works
between January 13, 2014 and August 21, 2014. See CM/ECF 1-1. Defendant’s Internet has been
used to illegally downloaded Plaintiff’s movies over the course of several months.

By

downloading each of these movies through the BitTorrent protocol, Defendant simultaneously
distributes these movies to others, allowing other people to also steal Plaintiff’s movies. See
Complaint, at ¶¶ 11 -20.
The length of time which Plaintiff’s investigator recorded Defendant infringing Plaintiff’s
movies demonstrates that the infringer was not a mere guest or passerby. It was someone with
access to Defendant’s Internet for a long period of time, consistently.
On October 23, 2014 counsel for Defendant emailed undersigned and communicated facts
similar to in his motion describing the subscriber. The next day undersigned wrote to him and
stated, “If your client is not responsible, we will not proceed against them. Please provide your

4

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 5 of 19 PageID# 104

clients name and address for an expeditious investigation.” See Exhibit A. Plaintiff did not solicit
settlement nor otherwise threaten or harass Defendant as his motion claims. Plaintiff is simply
trying to learn the facts and determine whether or not to proceed with litigation.
III.

THIS COURT SHOULD NOT QUASH THE SUBPOENA
Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3) provides that a court must modify or quash a subpoena that fails to

allow a reasonable time to comply; requires a non-party to travel more than 100 miles (except for
trial within the state); requires disclosure of privileged materials; or, subjects a person to undue
burden. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3)(A)(i-iv). The Rule also provides for circumstances in which
a court may modify or quash a subpoena. These circumstances are when the subpoena requires
disclosure of trade secrets; disclosure of certain expert opinions; or, requires a nonparty to incur
substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend a trial.

See Fed. R. Civ.

P. 45(c)(3)(B)(i-iii). “No other grounds are listed.” Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 5-8, 2013
WL 1164867 at *2 (D. Colo. 2013) (denying motion to quash in similar BitTorrent copyright
infringement action where defendant’s motion failed to articulate a reason to quash the subpoena
that complied with Rule 45).
Recently, the District Court of Maryland ruled on similar issues before this Court, denying
a Defendant’s motion to quash.
The Defendants have standing to contest the subpoenas to the third party, but their
ultimate arguments relate to proof of wrongdoing, or lack thereof. The Plaintiff is
not required to prove its contentions at this stage. It has presented colorable claims
that each of the Defendants have illegally downloaded Plaintiff's copyrightprotected product. Plaintiffs are entitled to move forward to the next stage in this
litigation.
Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, CIV. JKB-13-512, 2013 WL 6577039 (D. Md. Dec. 12, 2013).

5

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 6 of 19 PageID# 105

A. A Denial of Infringement Is Not a Valid Reason to Quash a Subpoena
Defendant’s motion to quash is based largely on a denial. “[I]t is well-settled that such
general denials of liability cannot serve as a basis for quashing a subpoena.” Malibu Media, LLC
v. Doe, No. CIV. WDQ-14-0252, 2014 WL 2879326, at *2 (D. Md. June 23, 2014). “Additionally,
the subscriber is being subpoenaed for information as to who may have infringed the copyright
when using that IP address. If the subscriber is later named as the defendant in this case, he will
have an opportunity to contest the merits of the case then.” Id. See also Voltage Pictures, LLC v.
Does 1-5,000, 818 F. Supp. 2d 28, 35 (D.D.C. 2011) (“A general denial of engaging in copyright
infringement is not a basis for quashing the plaintiff's subpoena.”) The Court in Voltage noted that
general denials of liability were not a basis to quash a subpoena and prevent Plaintiff from learning
the identity of the subscriber of the IP address. If this were the case, Plaintiff would be denied
critical information necessary in order to address the merits of the claim.
B. Plaintiff’s Discovery is Relevant
This Court granted Plaintiff limited discovery to serve a subpoena on Defendant’s ISP
because Plaintiff has no other way to identify the Defendants and proceed with its copyright
infringement case against them. Plaintiff has requested only the identifying information of
Defendant from his ISP.
The Court found good cause for ordering that discovery, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1),
because the plaintiff showed that a subpoena seeking the subscriber information
associated with the allegedly infringing IP addresses would be the only way for the
plaintiff to identify the proper defendants in this case and proceed with its claims
against them.3 See Declaration of Tobias Fieser ¶ 9, 23, Pl.'s Mot. Ex. The
information sought is thus highly relevant to the plaintiff's claims.
Raw Films, Ltd. v. John Does 1-15, CIV.A. 11-7248, 2012 WL 1019067, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 26,
2012).
Even if the subscriber is not the infringer, Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
6

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 7 of 19 PageID# 106

provides for broad discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) permits parties to obtain discovery of “the identity
and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter.” Raw Films, Ltd. v. John Does 115, 2012 WL 1019067, at *6 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (holding that although the subpoena may only
identify the subscriber and may not reveal the infringer’s identity, the subpoenas are a proper use
of discovery.). See also e.g. Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-15, 2012 WL 3089383 at *9 (E.D.
Pa. 2012) (denying motion to quash subpoena in similar BitTorrent copyright infringement case
holding that the relevancy standard was satisfied); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does No. 1-30,
2012 WL 6203697 at *4 (D.N.J. 2012) (same). “Relevance is a broad concept at the discovery
phase . . . The identity of the customers associated with the Alleged IP addresses is relevant under
this standard . . . The subpoenas to the ISP, therefore, are a proper use of discovery.” Patrick
Collins, Inc. v. John Does 1-9, 2012 WL 4321718 at *4 (C.D. Ill. 2012). Here, it is likely
Defendant is either the infringer or knows who the infringer is and can provide Plaintiff with
relevant information to aid Plaintiff in identifying the infringer.
C. Defendant’s IP Address is the Only Way to Identify the Infringer
Defendant attempts to quash the subpoena on the basis that the subscriber may not be the
infringer. This premise, however, has been specifically rejected by courts in the Fourth Circuit.
“While [Defendant] is free to present evidence to corroborate his denial of liability, and then move
to dismiss the claims asserted against him, the court cannot quash a subpoena on these grounds.”
Patrick Collins, Inc. v. Does 1-7, 2012 WL 1150827, at *9 (D. Md. 2012). See also Patrick
Collins, Inc. v. Does 1-10, 2012 WL 1144980, at *8 (D. Md. 2012) (same); Achte/Neunte Boll
Kino Beteiligungs Gmbh & Co. v. Does 1-4,577, 736 F. Supp. 2d 212, 215 (D.D.C. 2010) (“the
merits of this case are not relevant to the issue of whether the subpoena is valid and enforceable.”);
First Time Videos, LLC v. Does 1-500, 276 F.R.D. 241, 250 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (denying motion to

7

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 8 of 19 PageID# 107

quash holding that denials of liability are premature and are not “relevant as to the validity or
enforceability of a subpoena[.]”) Even if Defendant is not the infringer, it is highly likely the
infringer is in Defendant’s home, or Defendant knows the identity of the infringer. This Court
should not allow Defendant to hide this information from Plaintiff before Defendant’s identity is
even known.
D. Plaintiff’s Interest In Obtaining the Information in the Subpoena Outweighs
Defendant’s Privacy Interest
“[C]ourts have consistently held that Internet subscribers do not have a protected privacy
interest in their subscriber information—including names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail
address—which they have already conveyed to their ISPs.” Patrick Collins, Inc. v. Does 1-10,
JFM 8:12-CV-00094, 2012 WL 1144980, *9 (D. Md. Apr. 4, 2012) (declining to quash a
subpoena). “I find no cognizable privacy interest in defendants' subscriber information—the only
potential basis to quash in this case—Doe defendant # 1's motion is denied.” Id. Likewise, the
Honorable Judge Williams denied a motion to quash, conscious of Plaintiff’s rights to pursue its
copyright infringement suit. See Third Degree Films, Inc. v. Does 1-118, 11-CV-03006-AW, 2011
WL 6837774 (D. Md. Dec. 28, 2011) (“the Court permitted Plaintiff to serve subpoenas on ISPs
so that Plaintiff may identify the Doe Defendants responsible for the alleged infringement. Such
identification is necessary so that Plaintiff may pursue these actions and enforce its legal rights to
distribute its pornographic motion picture by obtaining a remedy against infringers”).

E. Plaintiff Does Not Publically Embarrass Defendants and Always Agrees to Allow
a Defendant to Proceed Anonymously
Defendant wrongly states that Plaintiff’s purpose for this suit is to embarrass Defendant in
the hopes of obtaining a settlement. First, Plaintiff has no intention of embarrassing Defendant

8

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 9 of 19 PageID# 108

and does not ever object to the Court allowing a defendant to proceed anonymously from the public
view and remain as John Doe. Second, Plaintiff does not solicit settlements prior to serving a
defendant with the Complaint and in all of its individual suits against a defendant, has only settled
prior to serving when the defendant has initiated the request. Indeed, this is Malibu Media’s
nationwide policy.
Defendant’s criticism of Plaintiff’s suits rests largely on prior copyright BitTorrent cases
with multiple defendants joined in one action, making the ability to litigate against multiple
defendants nearly impossible. Here, Plaintiff has filed suit against only Defendant. Should the
Court seek to impose restrictions similar to the District Court of Maryland requiring Plaintiff to
seek leave of Court to settle with an unrepresented defendant or allow all defendants to proceed
anonymously, Plaintiff will not oppose. See e.g. Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. 14-CV-00223MJG, 2014 WL 4682793, at *1 (D. Md. Sept. 18, 2014) (“The Court's standard order in these cases
(1) creates a procedure for ISP subscribers to anonymously move to quash the subpoena served on
the ISP, (2) includes provisions prohibiting Malibu from contacting unrepresented John Does for
settlement negotiations, and (3) specifies other protections for subscribers. To the best of this
Court's knowledge, Malibu has complied with these procedures and this Court is unaware of any
allegations of abuse in this district.”)
Recently, the Middle District of Florida found that “the mere act of releasing Defendant’s
identity to Plaintiff will not necessarily cause Defendant to be impugned” and that Defendant may
seek a protective order.
The Court recognizes that Defendant is understandably concerned that his or her
name will be impugned (incorrectly or otherwise) by being associated with the
allegations in the Complaint. Quashing the subpoena, however, is not the correct
avenue for protecting Defendant from the embarrassment associated with the nature
of pornography. Indeed, the mere act of releasing Defendant's identity to Plaintiff
will not necessarily cause Defendant to be impugned, and Defendant remains free
9

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 10 of 19 PageID# 109

to separately seek protection from any undue harassment or burden that may
potentially result as a consequence of permitting the subpoena to issue.
Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. 8:14-CV-874-T-36AEP, 2014 WL 5599105, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Nov.
3, 2014). Likewise, Plaintiff is willing to consent to any measures Defendant wishes to protect his
privacy so long as Plaintiff can learn Defendant’s identity and proceed with its case in order to
adjudicate its claims and protect its copyrights.
F. Defendant’s Cases Are Distinguishable
1. VPR International v. Does 1-1017 is Inapplicable
Defendant relies on an opinion from the Central District of Illinois to support his theory
that Plaintiff’s subpoena should be quashed. See Def’s Mot. citing VPR Internationale v. Does 11017, 2:11-cv-02068, (C. Ill. April 29, 2011) (Exhibit D). VPR Internationale involved 1,017
defendants grouped into one case, and lacked proper personal jurisdiction and venue. This case
does not suffer from the same procedural problems. Indeed, the Honorable Judge Cudmore, from
the same court, distinguished VPR Internationale, noting that it involved a Class Action with
improper personal jurisdiction and that suits like Plaintiff’s are not fishing expeditions. See Patrick
Collins, Inc. v. John Does 1-9, 12-CV-3161, 2012 WL 4321718 (C.D. Ill. 2012).
The VPR Internationale case, however, was significantly different from this case.
The plaintiff in that case, VPR Internationale, sought to commence a class action
against all persons everywhere who used the BitTorrent protocol to infringe on any
of VPR Internationale' copyrighted motion pictures. VPR Internationale did not
allege that any of the 1,017 IP addresses had been used to upload or download the
same unique copy of any of VPR Internationale's copyrighted works. VPR
Internationale did not allege that it had identified even one IP address that was used
within the District to infringe on one of its copyrights, let alone one who would be
an appropriate class representative. Under these circumstances, this Court found
that the request for authority to issue subpoenas before the Rule 26(f) conference
was little more than a fishing expedition and an abuse of the discovery process.
VPR Internationale, 2011 WL 8179128, at *1–2.
In this case, Collins is not engaged in a fishing expedition. Collins has identified
nine Alleged IP Addresses, not 1,017. These Alleged IP Addresses were all used to
download and upload the same unique copy of the Work. The Alleged IP Addresses
10

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 11 of 19 PageID# 110

were all traced to addresses within the District. The subpoenas only seek
information on these nine Alleged IP Addresses that allegedly were used illegally
within the District. Collins' limited subpoenas are proper. The rationale of the VPR
Internationale case does not apply herein.
Id. at *4. (Emphasis added).
2. Malibu Media v. Doe (S.D. Fla.) Failed to Take Plaintiff’s Well Pled Facts as True
Defendant relies on a Southern District of Florida’s previous ruling, which held “Plaintiff has
not shown how this geolocation software can establish the identity of the Defendant. There is nothing
that links the IP address location to the identity of the person actually downloading and viewing
Plaintiff’s videos, and establishing whether that person lives in this district.” See Malibu Media v. John
Doe, 1:14-cv-20213-UU (S.D. Fla. March 20, 2014). Respectfully, Plaintiff suggests that the court
erred in the Southern District of Florida case. The statement “[t]here is nothing that links the IP address
location to the identity of the person actually downloading and viewing Plaintiff’s videos, and
establishing whether that person lives in this district” is simply not true. Plaintiff pled that the person
actually downloading and viewing Plaintiff’s movies is the subscriber and owner of the IP address.
This allegation is not only plausible it is true the vast majority of cases. Indeed, Plaintiff proved it to
be true in the Bellwether trial and has had numerous subscribers admit to committing the infringement,
some of whom have even filed public allocutions.
This Court’s order correctly found that Plaintiff had established “good cause” for expedited
discovery to determine Defendant’s identity and reflected the overwhelming view that Plaintiff is
entitled to move forward with its case. See CM/ECF 6 (“Plaintiff has established that “good cause”
exists to serve a third party subpoena.”) This represents the view of every court in the Fourth Circuit
and the vast majority throughout the country in Plaintiff’s cases.
Toward that end, other courts have specifically disagreed with the Southern District of Florida
order cited by Defendant. The Eastern District of Pennsylvania, when considering a similar motion to
quash which relied on the 14-cv-20213-UU opinion, found “[t]he arguments that John Doe raises
11

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 12 of 19 PageID# 111

concerning the link between the actual infringer and the IP address or MAC address do not undermine
the plausibility of Malibu Media’s claim or defeat that claim as a matter of law -- rather, John Doe
raises factual issues about identity more properly dealt with during discovery.” Malibu Media v. John
Doe, 2:14-cv-01280-SD (E. D. Pa. May 19, 2014). Another judge in the Southern District of Florida
likewise dismissed the ruling, finding “Malibu Media has alleged a plausible link between the
subscriber … and the copyright infringement, and any factual disputes are inappropriate at this
stage.” Malibu Media v. John Doe, 14-cv-20393 (S.D. Fla. July 17, 2014). “Malibu Media also
identifies a compelling reason to permit this action to proceed: this is the only avenue available to
Malibu Media to protect its copyrights.” Id.

3. Discount Video Center v. Does 1-5041 and Combat Zone Inc. v. Does 1-22 Are
Inapplicable
Discount Video Center, Inc. v. Does 1-5041, 11-cv-2694 (N.D. Cal. Sept 23, 2011) and
Combat Zone, Inc. v. Does 1-22, No. CIV.A. 12-30086-MAP, 2013 WL 1092149, at *6 (D. Mass.
Feb. 15, 2013) are both distinguishable from the case at hand because each case joins dozens to
thousands of defendants together in one action based on a single date of infringement. Indeed, in
Combat Zone the court found discovery would have been proper had the plaintiff prepared a proper
subpoena to the defendants that did not request settlement. “The Court does note that proper
discovery of the identities of the subscribers is permissible. However, the Court finds that the
subpoenas do not comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” Combat Zone, Inc. v. Does
1-22, No. CIV.A. 12-30086-MAP, 2013 WL 1092149, at *6 (D. Mass. Feb. 15, 2013). Both of
these cases were impossible to litigate and called into question the plaintiff’s motives. Here,
Plaintiff is suing one individual whose IP address infringed Plaintiff’s movies for months. Plaintiff
has not solicited any settlement. Upon learning Defendant’s identity, if it has a proper basis to
proceed and litigate the case after an investigation, Plaintiff will do so.

12

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 13 of 19 PageID# 112

4. The Eastern District of New York Court Found the Plaintiff’s Allegations “Plausible”
Defendant relies heavily on In re BitTorrent Adult Film Copyright Infringement Cases,
2012 WL 1570765 (E.D.N.Y. May 1, 2012), a case out of the Eastern District of New York where
the Honorable Judge Brown severed cases by Plaintiff and others in similar suits and called into
question whether an IP address could accurately identify an infringer. Defendant, however, fails
to note that in that very same case, a similar motion to dismiss was denied on the basis that the
plaintiff’s claim for relief was plausible. See Patrick Collins, Inc. v. John Doe 1, 2013 WL
2177787 (E.D.N.Y. May 18, 2013). “In the Court's view, the Plaintiff has adequately pled a
plausible claim of copyright infringement by providing sufficient detail as to the acts the John Doe
Defendant took in infringing the copyright.” Id. The Court found that alleging a claim against the
subscriber of an IP address is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss and stated:
[T]he difficulty that the Plaintiff will ultimately have in proving that the individual
John Doe Defendant was the one who actually utilized the IP address to commit the
accused copyright infringement is not relevant in the context of a motion to dismiss.
Instead, at this time, the Plaintiff merely has to state a plausible claim. Thus, while
it is a reasonable possibility that the Defendant here did not commit any copyright
infringement because another individual did so using his IP address, such as a
different family member, visitor, neighbor, or passerby, it is an equally reasonable
possibility that the Defendant committed the accused of act.
Patrick Collins, Inc. v. John Doe 1, 12-CV-1154 ADS GRB, 2013 WL 2177787 (E.D.N.Y. May
18, 2013) (emphasis added). And, this case is fundamentally different from the cases in In Re
BitTorrent because Plaintiff has alleged Defendant infringed, not one, but 20 of its movies over a
long period of time.

G. Defendant’s Arguments Concerning Dynamic IP Addresses and Spoofing Are
Speculative and Highly Unlikely
Defendant’s argument that his Internet may not have been used to infringe all of the movies
13

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 14 of 19 PageID# 113

alleged in the complaint is based on pure speculation. Indeed, internet service providers (“ISP”)
rarely utilize changing dynamic IP addresses. As an example, Comcast Customer Care, a large
ISP similar to Verizon specifically notes that “[a]s an . . . Internet subscriber, you’re given an
Internet protocol (IP) address assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.
While not permanent, your IP address doesn’t change often.” 1 (Emphasis added). Further, the
chances that two or more individuals were assigned the same IP address and also using BitTorrent
to engage in the same illegal behavior infringing Plaintiff’s movies is highly unlikely and based
on pure speculation.
IPP’s software established a direct TCP/IP connection with the John Doe Defendants’ IP
address. When a direct TCP/IP connection is established, it is impossible for an individual to hide,
fake, mask, or spoof his or her IP address because that individual’s computer directly connects
with IPP’s server. At trial, Plaintiff’s investigator, Tobias Fieser, will testify to this fact. And,
Plaintiff plans on submitting a report by independent experts that will verify that IPP’s technology
works.
Toward that end, courts have found that theories of “spoofing” or “hacking” Defendants
internet “are speculative and unsupported by any record evidence.” Malibu Media, LLC v.
Fitzpatrick, 1:12-CV-22767, 2013 WL 5674711 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 17, 2013). Here, Defendant’s
argument that his Internet was “spoofed” or suffered from a dynamic IP address is pure speculation
and nothing more than a denial of infringement. If Plaintiff proceeds against Defendant he may
raise this argument as a defense.
H. Defendant’s Argument Regarding “One or More Bit” are Irrelevant and Speculative

Defendant’s argument that the subpoena should be quashed because Plaintiff’s investigator
only downloaded “one or more bit” lacks merit. Indeed, this argument is nothing more than a
denial that the Defendant’s Internet downloaded the entire movie. And, it lacks a fundamental
understanding of how BitTorrent works. As courts have explained, the nature of the BitTorrent
protocol is that infringers download the movie piecemeal. “When a person uses BitTorrent to
download a file, such as a movie, the person usually will not obtain a full copy of the movie from
one other computer. Instead, the user will obtain pieces of the movie from multiple computers in
the swarm. Once the user has obtained all the pieces, the BitTorrent computer program, which is
running on the user's computer, assembles the pieces into a completed file, allowing the user to
view the movie.” Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. 13-C-0213, 2013 WL 5876192, at *1 (E.D. Wis.
Oct. 31, 2013). “Critically, it is possible to download pieces from peers who themselves are still
downloading other pieces of the movie (and thus do not have a full copy of the movie) because the
BitTorrent software, by default, immediately offers for download any piece it has downloaded
(and verified using the digital fingerprint). (Compl.¶¶ 30–34.) That is, sharing is piecemeal.”
Malibu Media LLC v. John Does 1-28, No. 12-CV-12598, 2012 WL 7748917, at *2 (E.D. Mich.
Oct. 31, 2012).
Here, the claim that Defendant downloaded the entire movie is certainly plausible and
likely true because the point of using BitTorrent is to download the entire movie. Indeed, the
Eastern District of Wisconsin examined this exact issue and found “someone who starts
downloaded a movie intends to watch the movie, and thus the person will likely download the full
movie”, finding Plaintiff’s claim plausible. Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. 13-C-0213, 2013 WL
5876192, at *2 (E.D. Wis. Oct. 31, 2013)
Defendant notes that it is possible that he copied only the pieces obtained by the
investigator rather than full versions of all nineteen movies. However, the fact that
15

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 16 of 19 PageID# 115

this is possible does not render plaintiff's claim implausible. Presumably, someone
who starts downloading a movie intends to watch the movie, and thus the person
will likely download the full movie. This means that there is a nonnegligible
probability that a user who has a piece of a file constituting a movie on his computer
also has the remaining pieces. It is not certain that the user will have the remaining
pieces—perhaps the person changed his or her mind before downloading the full
movie or other circumstances prevented the person from downloading the full
movie. But at the pleading stage certainty is not required.
Id. (Emphasis added).
I. Plaintiff’s Complaint Has Always Survived A Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiff’s lawsuit is not frivolous.

Indeed, in every case where Plaintiff has been

challenged with a 12(b)(6) motion, the court has found Plaintiff stated a plausible claim. See e.g.
Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe 1, 2013 WL 30648 at *4 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (“Accepting all factual
allegations in the Amended Complaints as true . . . the Court concludes Plaintiff has stated a claim
upon which relief can be granted under the Copyright Act.”); Malibu Media, LLC v. Roldan, 8:13CV-3007-T-30TBM, 2014 WL 3805494 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 1, 2014) (“Plaintiff has alleged a
plausible link between the subscriber assigned to IP address 96.58.134.12, Defendant, and the
copyright infringement”); Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, 313-CV-1579-J-32PDB, 2014 WL 2530872
(M.D. Fla. Apr. 10, 2014) (“[i]ts allegations, based on experience and practical realities, make
plausible that the subscribers are the infringers”); Malibu Media v. Roy, Case No. 12-cv-617 (W.D.
Mich.) (denying 12(b)(6) motion);Malibu Media v. Pratt, 1:12-cv-00621-RJJ, CM/ECF 31 (W.D.
Mich. March 19, 2013) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe, 2:13-cv-11446-AJT-DRG,
CM/ECF 13 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 18, 2013) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. Lowry, 2013 WL 6024371,
at *5 (D. Colo. 2013) (same);Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe 1, 2013 WL 30648 at *4 (E.D. Pa.
2013) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. Killoran, 2:13-cv-11446-AJT-DRG, CM/ECF 13 (E.D.
Mich. Oct. 18, 2013) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe, 2:13-cv-00055-JVB-JEM,
CM/ECF 22 (N.D. Ind. August, 16, 2013) (same); Malibu Media LLC v. Doe, 2013 WL 3945978
16

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 17 of 19 PageID# 116

(E.D. Mich. 2013) (same); Malibu Media LLC v. Gilvin, 2014 WL 1260110 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 26,
2014) (same); Malibu Media, LLC v. Sanchez, 2014 WL 172301 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 15, 2014)
(same); Malibu Media, LLC v. Butler, 13-cv-02707-WYD-MEH, CM/ECF 31 (D. Colo. April 24,
2014) (same).
Further, Plaintiff’s complaint has survived summary judgment. See Malibu Media, LLC v.
Fitzpatrick, 1:12-CV-22767, 2013 WL 5674711 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 17, 2013). And, Plaintiff has been
awarded summary judgment in its favor. See Malibu Media v. Bui, 1:13-cv-163 (W.D. Mich. July
21, 2014). Plaintiff has even prevailed at trial. See Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1, 6, 13, 14,
950 F. Supp. 2d 779, 788 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (“Malibu has satisfied its burden of proof with substantial
evidence and deserves a large award.”)
If the Court were to follow Defendant’s rationale, copyright holders would be unable to
bring actions for copyright infringement on the Internet. This holding would be contrary to the
express policy of Congress. Congress enacted the Digital Theft Deterrence Act of 1999 to deter
online infringement by increasing the penalties therefore. See Sony v. Tennenbaum, 660 F.3d 487,
497 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing the Congressional record and holding that non-commercial individuals
commit infringement by distributing copyrighted works online). The Supreme Court has held file
sharing of copyrighted works is infringement.

See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

Grokster, Ltd. 545 U.S. 913, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (2005). Two circuit courts opined that Rule 45
subpoenas may be used to identify online copyright infringers. See In re Charter Communications,
Inc. Subpoena Enforcement Matter, 393 F.3d 771, 774 (8th Cir. 2005); Arista Records, LLC. v.
Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2010). The Register of Copyrights testified before Congress that
entertainment companies have the right to sue for peer to peer infringement and they should not

17

Case 1:14-cv-01169-TSE-JFA Document 13 Filed 11/13/14 Page 18 of 19 PageID# 117

apologize for doing so. 2 Courts unanimously hold that Plaintiff’s First Amendment right under
the Petition clause to bring a suit for infringement outweighs any First Amendment right proffered
by an alleged infringer. See e.g., Sony Music Entertainment, inc. v. Does 1-40, 326 F.Supp.2d 556
(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (and the cases citing thereto). The only way to enforce one’s copyrights against
online infringement is to subpoena the identity of the subscriber whose internet was used to commit
the infringement.
The only way to enforce one’s copyrights against online infringement is to subpoena the
identity of the subscriber whose internet was used to commit the infringement. And, in order to
do so, a copyright holder must file a federal lawsuit and establish personal jurisdiction and venue
by utilizing geolocation technology. With out this ability, copyright owners would have a right
without a remedy. Any such state of affairs would violate Chief Justice Marshall’s often cited rule
that “the very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the
protection of the laws, whenever he received an injury.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 1803
WL 893, *17 (U.S. 1803). Chief Justice Marshall continued “[t]he government of the United
States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease
to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal
right.” Id. The U.S. still deserves that high appellation because it steadfastly creates remedies
when vested rights have been infringed. The case in front of the bar is no exception, our
government and laws provide copyright owners with the ability to ascertain the identity of
infringers through a Rule 45 subpoena when, as here, there is a reasonably likelihood that
Defendant resides in this district.
