PLAINTIFF/CLASS REPRESENTATIVE ANN W. HUMPHREY’S OBJECTIONS TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS PENDING MEDIATION
AND REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION1
Plaintiff/Class Representative Ann W. Humphrey (“Humphrey”) has encouraged defendants
to participate in mediation for many months, and intensified her efforts following the Court’s
opinion on her motion for certification of the Class. However, Humphrey objects to staying all
proceedings during mediation and to other aspects of Defendants’ Motion to Stay Proceedings and
for Mediation (“Stay Motion”) in light of the current posture of the case.
As an initial matter, there is outstanding the issue of who is eligible for an Early Retirement
Pension (“ERP”). This was the subject of the October 12, 2007 Rule 16 Conference, and the Court
has not yet ruled on that issue. Humphrey believes the Court’s ruling on that issue must precede the

parties’ attempt to mediate the dispute. Class Counsel and Humphrey cannot be sure who they are,
or should be, representing in the mediation without the Court’s ruling.
Additionally, the parties and mediator will need damages information in order to mediate the
dispute to settlement. At a minimum, the damages information needed is as follows:
For all persons who earned a pension under the Prior Plan and 96Plan and received an ERP based
on meeting the requirements under §5.3 of the 96Plan (i.e., at least age 55, but not age 65, and at
least 5 years of service OR at least age 50, but not age 55, and age + service = at least 65) -name
social security number
last known address
date of birth
date of hire
termination date

if elected lump sum, amount distributed and whether it was present value of Participant’s Prior Plan
accrued benefit or Participant’s Account Balance (as defined in First Amendment to 96Plan)
if elected annuity, the monthly amount and whether it was the Prior Plan accrued benefit or an
annuity derived from the Participant’s Account Balance
total Contribution Credits
total Interest Credits

For all persons who earned a pension under the Prior Plan and 96Plan and (i) received a Deferred
Vested Retirement Pension (“DVP”), and (ii) as of their benefit commencement date, satisfied the
age requirement under §5.3 (i.e., at least age 55, but not age 65, and at least 5 years of service OR
at least age 50, but not age 55, and age plus service = at least 65) -name

if elected lump sum, amount distributed and whether it was present value of Participant’s Prior Plan
accrued benefit or Participant’s Account Balance (as defined in First Amendment to 96Plan)

annuity derived from the Participant’s Account Balance

For all persons who earned a pension under the Prior Plan and 96Plan and (i) are still employed by
UNT or a Participating Agency or have terminated service, but not yet received their Pension, and
(ii) have not attained age 65, but have at least 5 years of service –
name
social security number
last known address
date of birth
date of hire
total Contribution Credits as of settlement date (assuming mediation results in a settlement)
total Interest Credits as of settlement date (assuming mediation results in a settlement)

For all persons who earned a pension under the Prior Plan and 96Plan, and (i) are still employed by
UNT or a Participating Agency or have terminated service, but not yet received their Pension, and
(ii) are (or were when they terminated) at least age 65 (no years of service requirement where
Participant terminates service at or after age 65; see §§5.1, 5.2, 6.3 and 6.4 of 96Plan) -name
social security number
last known address
date of birth
date of hire
total Contribution Credits as of settlement date (assuming mediation results in a settlement)
total Interest Credits as of settlement date (assuming mediation results in a settlement)
The foregoing groupings are based on the persons Humphrey identified as being eligible for
an ERP and, thus, members of the Class. Humphrey identified those persons (i) in her dispositive
briefs, (ii) in her class certification motion and brief and reply brief, (iii) at oral argument on her
class certification motion, (iv) in her written submission of Points for the Court to Consider in
Connection with the October 12, 2007 Rule 16 Conference, and (v) during oral argument at the Rule
16 Conference. Without advance clarification from the Court as to who is in the Class and the
requisite damages information for each Class member, it will be impossible to mediate this dispute
to settlement. Moreover, in order to effectively work with the damages information before and
during the settlement, it must be produced in Excel spreadsheet format (unconverted to any other

4

Case 4:05-cv-00758 Document 111

format) at least two weeks before the mediation.
Finally, the Court should reject defendants’ argument that a stay of proceedings is necessary
because (according to defendants) “United Way’s Counsel has determined that additional filings
relating to the above motions [i.e., the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment and
submissions relating to the October 12, 2007 Rule 16 conference] may need to be filed.” The
deadline for filing dispositive motions has long passed, and, at the end of the Rule 16 conference,
defendants’ counsel represented that there were no other issues the Court needed to consider in
connection with that conference. As importantly, defendants’ motion to substitute counsel expressly
stated that the substitution would not be “urged as a ground for continuing any deadline.” The Court
should flatly refuse to countenance this abrupt about face.
Wherefore, Humphrey requests that the Court (i) DENY defendants’ request to stay the
proceedings, or at least DENY any stay with respect to the Court’s anticipated ruling on the Rule
16 Conference issue; and (ii) with respect to any mediation of this dispute, ORDER defendants to
produce to Humphrey’s attorneys the following information at least two weeks before the mediation:
(A) For each Class member (as clarified by the Court’s anticipated ruling as to who is
eligible for an ERP), the respective damages information delineated above in Excel
spreadsheet format; and
(B) As to any person who will participate in the settlement negotiations (either directly or
indirectly), the person’s--name
-relationship and title, if any, with respect to UNT or any Participating Agency,
including any insurer
-relationship and title, if any, with respect to Baker Botts, Mercer or any other law
firm or actuarial firm, including any insurer
-employer

Other than Class Counsel, Humphrey anticipates that the only other person who will
participate in any mediation on behalf of the Class would be an actuary who would be available by
phone. Humphrey will identify the actuary she selects for this purpose if and when there is an order
or stipulation to mediate the dispute.
