BOT Services Overview
Career & Scholarship The northern region consists of 17 provinces and stretches over one-third or 106
Procurement million Rai (169,600 square kilometer) of the country. As forested mountains dominate most of
Laws the topography, agricultural area holds only 29.2 million Rai or one-fifth of the country's
Notifications agricultural area. As at the end of 2002, northern population reached one-fourth of the country,

totaling 11.2 million. Provinces with a population of over one million were Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai
and Nakhon Sawan. In 2002, average annual per capita income was Baht 43,987, which placed
the northern region ahead of the northeastern region, but below other regions and the nation
(Baht 85,951)

Economic Structure

In recent years, the northern region has grown and diversified, but agriculture remains
a mainstay. The region's economy, in terms of Gross Regional Product (GRP), average grew at
0.7 percent during 1997-2002, compared with Thailand's average economic growth of 0.8
percent a year during the same period. Agricultural was the most important sector, registering
20.1 percent of 2002's GRP, followed by manufacturing, wholesales and retail trade and
transport and communications at 17.9, 17.3, and 7.0 percent respectively. Principal crops in this
region are rice, sugarcane, maize, tobacco, soybeans, vegetables, and fruits. For manufacturing,
leading industries include manufactures of electronic components, sugar, cement, ceramic
product; processing of fruits and vegetables; and handicrafts.

Contribution to Thai Economy

Based on economic activity, the northern region contributed about 9.1 percent or Baht
495,904 million to 2002's Gross Domestic Product (GDP at current market prices). Agricultural
and mining sectors, in particular, have played key role on the national scale, capturing as much
as 23.5 percent of total agricultural and 15.0 percent of total mining in 2002. As a main crops
producer, the northern region supplies over one-fourth of the country's crops production. Recent
list of major crops includes rice, maize, and sugar cane. Particular produce produced exclusively
by the north, including logan, lychee, garlic, tobacco leaves, shallots, and onions, even captures
the lion's share of the country's respective produce. Endowed with minerals resources, the north
is an important mineral-producing region of the country. Lignite, limestone, and kaolin are prime
asset of Lampang; zinc ore is resource of Tak; and crude oil is property of Kam Pheang Phet.
Besides minerals, water is another vital resource nurturing not only agriculture within the region
but also the southward central region, and Bangkok and vicinities.

Geographic and Economic Structure

The northern region can be divided into two parts: the upper north and the lower
north.

The upper north, bordering on Myanmar and Lao PDR, covers about 60 percent of
the northern region and consists of nine provinces: Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son,
Lamphun, Phayao, Nan, Phrea, Lampang, and Tak. As forested mountains dominate most of the
area, land suitable for agriculture is below 15 percent. On the other hand, this remarkable
mountainous terrain and magnificent scenery is quality that has drawn tourists and new residents
to the upper north for decades. As a result, services indusiry, particularly hotels, resorts, and
souvenir trade, becomes a major force driving the economy of the upper north. Apart from
services, the upper north also involves in power generation. At present, prominent electricity
producers are Bhumibol Hydro Power Plant in Tak and Mae Moh Power Plant in Lampang. For
manufacturing, the upper north's rich minerals resource such as kaolin, zinc ore, limestone, coal,
and lignite has contributed considerably to development of leading industries including
manufactures of ceramic products, zinc and zinc products, and cement. In the area of foreign
trade, the upper north is known as a gateway to conduct cross-border trading with Myanmar, Lao
, Case SEN SSO Document 31 Filed 06/24/05 cent$ 5of6 PagelD 254

PDR, and southern China.

In terms of economic activity, Chiang Mai is deemed as the upper north and the
region's economic center. The province contributed to about 16.0 percent of the 2002's GRP and
was ranked the third of the country in terms of bank branches. As at the end of 2002, Chiang
Mai's credits and deposits amounted to about one-third of credit outstanding and deposit
outstanding of the northern region.

The lower north, lying next to the central region, consists of eight provinces: Kam
Phaeng Phet, Phichit, Sukhothai, Uttaradit, Nakhon Sawan, Phetchabun, and Uthai Thani. As
most of the area is fertile plateau suitable for cultivation, agriculture becomes the backbone of the
lower north with major crops concentrates in rice, maize, and sugar. At present, the lower north is
recognized as a main center for producing and trading of rice and crops. Influenced by productive
agriculture, most local manufacturing involves in agro businesses such as manufacture of sugar
in Nakhon Sawan, Kam Phaeng Phet, Uttaradit, and Phitsanulok; manufacture of agricultural
machinery in Phitsanulok and Nakhon Sawan; rice mill in Phichit, Phitsanulok, and Nakhon
Sawan. Besides agriculture and manufacturing, tourism is another thriving industry. In recent
years, splendid historic site of Sukhothai has gained international reputation and become one of
Thailand's most visited ancient sites.

Labor Condition

As at the end of 2003, labor force amounted to 6.6 million; of this 60 percent were
agricultural workforce. Minimum daily wage in each province range between Baht 130-137
except Chiang Mai's, which was Baht 145 (Ministry of Labor, December 8, 2003). Labor
movement is an interesting issue as seen by migration of labors to the central region and foreign
countries including Taiwan, Singapore, Brunei, and Israel. The migration, however, has been
substituted by immigration of labors from the northeastern region and neighboring countries,
particularly in the area of sugar cane harvesting.

Financial Sector

There were 487 bank branches operated in the northern region at the end of June
2004. With 12.8 percent of total bank branches in Thailand, the region came in second place
after Bangkok and vicinities. Majority of bank branches (about 60 percent) were located the
upper north and typically concentrated in Muang districts. The rest were situated in the lower
north and generally spread on the outer districts. As at the end of June 2004, bank credits and
deposits amounted to Baht 291.8 billion and Baht 206.6 billion, accounting for 5.6 percent and
4.3 percent respectively of total credit outstanding and deposit outstanding of the country.

Foreign Trade

Foreign trade is categorized into two groups : (1) foreign trade with shipment by air,
filing at Chiang Mai Airport Customs House and Northern Region Industrial Estate Customs
House, Lamphun province, and (2) foreign trade with shipment by other means, filing at customs
checkpoints, which is known as border trade. The first, accounting for more than 80.0 percent of
total foreign trade value, involves trading of electronics components produced in the Northern
Region Industrial Estate in Lamphun. Chiang Mai Airport Customs House be the export channel
for agricultural product and handicraft. The second involves border trading with Myanmar, Lao
PDR, and southern China. Currently, major exports consist of consumer goods, rubber tires, and
construction materials where main imports comprise oxen, buffaloes, and wood products.
Myanmar, the key-trading partner, captures over 60.0 percent of border trade value.
