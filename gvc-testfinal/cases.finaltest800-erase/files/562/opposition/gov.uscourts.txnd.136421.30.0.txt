Introduction

1. On November 5, 2004 the Court issued its Memorandum Order granting
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss on Grounds of Forum Non Conveniens. Judgment based
on the Court's Memorandum Order and Opinion was entered on November 29, 2004.
The judgment allowed Plaintiffs' filing of suit in Thailand within 120 days from the date
of judgment. Thereafter, Plaintiffs moved for and received an extension for filing until
June 6, 2005.

2. Plaintiffs' motion for relief from the judgment is pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 60 and asks for relief from that judgment based upon Plaintiffs' allegation that
there is no adequate remedy available to Plaintiffs in Thailand. Plaintiffs also now wish
to amend their complaint to include a cause of action under 18 U.S.C. 0x00A72255."

Summary of Response

3. Plaintiffs' motion should be denied because (1) Plaintiffs have not established that
Thailand is not an available or adequate forum, (2) Plaintiffs should not be allowed to
amend their complaint six months after judgment to add a cause of action under 18
U.S.C. 0x00A72255, (3) if they were so allowed, the addition of a Section 2255 claim does not
change the result related to forum non conveniens issues, and (4) the Court's
Memorandum Order dated November 5, 2004 correctly determined that this suit should

be dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens after extensive consideration of the

 

118 U.S.C. 0x00A72255 provides a civil remedy for personal injuries to victims of violations of
several statutes involving child sex and pornography, including violations of 18 U.S.C.
0x00A72423. This statute allows recovery of actual damages deemed to be not less than
$50,000 and attorneys fees.

adequacy of the Thai forum and the private and public interest factors which weigh

heavily in favor of dismissal.

Objections to Affidavit of Raul Loya
Defendant objects to the affidavit of Raul Loya as follows:
A. Paragraph 3 of the affidavit states that Loya has discovered that the
maximum recovery available to Plaintiffs is 1 million Baht ($25,000 US). The
statement is clearly not based on Loya's personal knowledge and constitutes
hearsay. It also purports to render an opinion without demonstration of the
requirements under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
B. Defendant objects to paragraph 4 of Loya's affidavit wherein he states
that 1 million Baht is a "relatively small sum by Thai standards." Defendant
further objects to Loya's statement in paragraph 4 that none of the referenced
attorneys were interested in representing Plaintiffs in a lawsuit in Thailand due to
the low recovery in Thai law. These statements are not based on personal
knowledge and are hearsay.
C. Defendant objects to paragraph 5 of the affidavit stating that a member of
the Supreme Court of Thailand "mentioned that the personal injury case in all
probability be summarily dismissed." Again, Loya has no personal knowledge
concerning the matter. The statement is hearsay and purports to render an opinion

without demonstration of any of the elements of Rule 702. It is also mere

speculation provided without any basis for the opinion, and it contradicts Loya's
assertion that a recovery would be $25,000.
D. Defendant also objects to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Loya affidavit wherein
he concludes that (1) Plaintiffs will be unable to find representation in Thailand
for their claims, and (2) Thailand will not afford an adequate forum for recovery.
Loya's conclusions are not the subject of proper expert testimony pursuant to
Rule 702. He is not qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,
training or education on Thai law. Further, his testimony is clearly neither based
on sufficient facts or data, nor is it the product of reliable principles. His affidavit
is based on a one-week visit to Thailand and alleged conversations with two Thai
lawyers and one judge.
Plaintiffs' Motion and Proof is Insufficient
5. Loya's affidavit does not establish that the Thai forum is inadequate or that
Plaintiffs cannot obtain Thai representation. Loya waited six months after the judgment
and almost three months after the Court extended the time for filing in Thailand to visit
Thailand in search of local attorneys. His affidavit recites that he met with only two
named attorneys and several others who he claims were not interested in representing
Plaintiffs in Thailand. These few meetings with attorneys do not demonstrate that legal
representation is unavailable.
6. Loya's statement that one million Baht is a relatively small sum by Thai standards
is both unsupported and wrong. According to Bank of Thailand reports, the 2002 average

annual per capita income in the northern region of Thailand, including the Chiang Rai

THE COURT'S JUDGMENT DATED NOVEMBER 29, 2004 AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT

THEREOF

Case SON NSIPQ Document 30 Filed 06/24/05 e 8 of 13 PagelD 244

province, was 43,987 Baht (approximately $1,100), well below the national average of
85, 951 Baht (approximately $2,100). See Appendix, page 1. Thus, if Loya's statement
that one million Baht ($25,000 U.S.) is the recovery available to the Plaintiffs in Thailand
is taken as correct, that amount represents approximately twenty times the average yearly
income in the Thai province wherein the alleged conduct occurred and ten times the
national average.

7. Plaintiffs' argument that $25,000 U.S. is inadequate also flies in the face of the
case law under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Neither the fact that damages may
be severely limited in the alternative forum, nor that all causes of action are not available
render the alternative forum inadequate. Gonzalez v. Chrysler Corp., 301 F.3d 377, 381
(5 Cir. 2002) cert denied; 538 U.S. 1012 (2003). In Gonzalez, the 5" Circuit rejected
the contention that Mexico's severe limitation on damages and the unavailability of the
theory of strict liability, even to the point where a lawsuit may cease to be economically
viable, rendered the forum inadequate. In Vasquez v. Bridgestone-Firestone, Inc., 325
F.3d 665 (5" Cir. 2003), the 5" Circuit held that Mexico was an appropriate forum in
spite of expert testimony that the law of Nuevo Leon limited wrongful lability to
approximately $5,700 plus unspecified "moral damages" as compensation for, among
other things, mental anguish. Vasquez, 325 F.3d at 671. Plaintiffs' potential recovery of
$25,000 in Thailand demonstrates the adequacy of the forum.

18 U.S.C. 0x00A72255 Claims
8. Plaintiffs' request to amend and add a claim under 18 U.S.C. 0x00A72255 is not only

untimely, but it should not change the analysis or result with regard to the forum non

conveniens issue. If Plaintiffs are now allowed to add a claim for damages under Section
2255, a claim not available under Thai law, it does not provide reason for the Court to
retain jurisdiction. The doctrine of forum non conveniens applies to cases involving
federal question jurisdiction where plaintiffs allege causes of action under United States
federal statutes. See Capital Currency Exchange, N.V. v. National Westminster Bank
PLC, 155 F.3d 603 (20x2122 Cir. 1998); and Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 67S. Ct.
839, 91 L.Ed. 1005 (1947).

9. In Capital Currency Exchange, dismissal of antitrust suits under the forum non
conveniens doctrine was upheld. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that
England was a more convenient forum in spite of the fact that English courts would not
enforce the Sherman Act. A forum non conveniens dismissal is not trumped simply
because the foreign forum will apply different substantive law than an American court.
Capital Currency Exchange, 155 F.3d at 609. The availability of an adequate forum does
not depend on the existence of an identical cause of action in the other forum. Jd.

10. As long as Plaintiffs may litigate the subject matter of their U.S. statutory

claims in the other forum, it is an adequate forum. /d. at 609 citing PT United Can Co. v.
Crown Cork & Seal Co., 138 F.3d 65, 74 (20x2122 Cir. 1998) (dismissal proper although
RICO claims could not be brought in alternative forum where fraud claim was available),
Transunion Corp. v. PepsiCo, Inc., 811 F.2d 127, 129-30 (20x2122 Cir. 1987) (dismissal of
RICO claims under forum non conveniens proper despite the fact that RICO statute has
"special venue" provision), and Howe v. Goldcorp., Inv., Ltd., 946 F.2d 944, 952 (1* Cir.

1991) (dismissal proper although U.S. securities law claims could not be brought in

alternative forum).

11. The subject matter of Plaintiffs' claims is sexual abuse. They seek damages for
personal injury, medical expenses and emotional suffering. As set forth in the affidavit of
Chaninet Leeds, Plaintiffs have available causes of action for damages relating to the
subject matter of their claims. See Affidavit of Chaninat Leeds, paragraphs 5-7.
Appendix to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, pages 3-4.

12. Plaintiffs cite Lueck v. Sunstrand Corp., 236 F.3d 1137 (9 Cir. 2001) and
Creative Tech Ltd. v. Aztech Sys. PTE., Ltd., 631 F.3d 696 (9" Cir. 1995) for the
propositions that dismissal on the grounds of forum non conveniens requires the court to
engage in choice of law analysis and that forum non conveniens does not apply when a
federal statute maintains venue in a United States district court. Plaintiffs' Motion for
Relief from Judgment, pg. 5. Plaintiffs then correctly recognize that the Fifth Circuit has
held that federal courts should avoid exercises in choices of law or comparative law when
addressing issues of forum non conveniens. In re: Air Crash Disaster Near New Orleans,
L.A. 821 F.2d 1147, 1163 (5" Cir. 1987). The Court need not perform a choice of law
analysis before determining whether a case should be dismissed on forum non conveniens
grounds. Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 249 (1981).

13. In both Lueck and Creative Technology, dismissals based on forum non
conveniens were upheld. In Lueck, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated that
choice of law analysis is only determinative when the case involves a United States
statute requiring venue in the United States. Section 2255 allows suit to be brought in

any appropriate U.S. District Court, but it does not mandate venue in the United States.
