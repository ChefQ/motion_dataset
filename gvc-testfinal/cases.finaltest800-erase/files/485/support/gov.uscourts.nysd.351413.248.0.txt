Case 1:09-cv-07557-GBD-JLC Document 248

Filed 11/20/13 Page 4 of 11

Bank of Montreal (“BMO” or the “Bank”) respectfully submits this memorandum
of law in support of its motion pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) for an order dismissing its claims
against defendant Kevin P. Cassidy without prejudice.
INTRODUCTION
BMO has agreed in principle to settle its claims against every defendant except
Cassidy. As for Cassidy, he is already obligated in his criminal case to pay BMO more than
$8.6 million in restitution for his admitted fraud against the Bank, an amount that he claims far
exceeds his ability to pay. Thus, any jury verdict against him in this civil litigation would offer
BMO no economic benefit. For this reason only, and in light of the anticipated legal costs that
BMO would incur in obtaining a jury verdict against him, BMO has determined that it will
voluntarily dismiss its claims against Cassidy. The Court of Appeals and numerous district
courts in this Circuit have held that a defendant’s impecuniousness is a reasonable and
appropriate basis to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice.
Accordingly, BMO respectfully requests that the Court enter an Order dismissing its claims
against Cassidy without prejudice.
BACKGROUND
BMO filed this action on August 28, 2009, naming as defendants two
brokerages – Optionable, Inc. (“Optionable”) and MF Global Inc. (“MF Global”) – and six
individuals employed by or affiliated with those brokerages, including Cassidy, the former CEO
of Optionable. The Complaint (Doc. 1) alleges that Cassidy conspired with BMO’s head natural
gas trader, David P. Lee, to hide large losses in BMO’s natural gas options trading book. To
carry out this fraud, Cassidy (among other things) provided price quotations to BMO for use in
the Bank’s “independent price verification,” or “IPV,” process. Although Cassidy knew that
BMO required independent price quotations for the IPV process – so that it could compare

2880961.5

Case 1:09-cv-07557-GBD-JLC Document 248

Filed 11/20/13 Page 5 of 11

independent prices to the prices that Lee had recorded in his trading book – Cassidy instead
supplied the Bank with prices that Lee had given him, thus subverting the IPV process and
preventing BMO from discovering the mounting losses in Lee’s trading book. After BMO
discovered this fraud, it revalued its natural gas options trading book using truly independent
data. The revaluation led the bank to announce a CDN$680 million pre-tax loss, and the
subsequent filing of this lawsuit against Cassidy and others.
Cassidy has admitted his role in the fraud against BMO. In the criminal action
brought against him by the Department of Justice, he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire
fraud based on his dealings with BMO. Judgment, United States v. Cassidy, No. 08-CR-1101
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2012) (Ex. 1)1. During his allocution before Judge Griesa, Cassidy
acknowledged:
Although I understood that BMO’s risk management department wanted quotes
that were not contributed to RealMarks by Lee and felt it was an important factor,
I did not tell the risk management department that many of the quotes had
originated with Lee. I knew this was wrong at the time.
United States v. Cassidy, Plea Hrg. Tr. at 10:12-17 (Aug. 15, 2011) (Ex. 2). Likewise, in his
deposition in this action, Cassidy acknowledged that his scheme with Lee “was a fraud on Bank
of Montreal.” (Cassidy Dep. Tr. 31:11-19 (Ex. 3).)
Judge Griesa sentenced Cassidy to 30 months in prison (Ex. 1). Cassidy also
entered into a Consent Order of Forfeiture, requiring him to pay $200,000 to the Government
within eighteen months of his release. (Consent Order of Forfeiture, United States v. Cassidy
(Apr. 27, 2012) (Ex. 4).)

In addition, following briefing and a series of hearings, Judge Griesa ordered
Cassidy to pay $8.6 million in restitution to BMO pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution
Act. (Order of Restitution, United States v. Cassidy (May 20, 2013) (Ex. 5), appeal pending,
No. 13-2185-CR (2d Cir.).) The $8.6 million consists of brokerage commissions that BMO paid
to Optionable during the period that Cassidy admitted to defrauding BMO, as well as incentive
compensation that BMO paid to Lee during that period. During the hearing at which Judge
Griesa awarded this restitution to BMO, Cassidy’s counsel stated that his client “does not have
$8 million. . . . [H]e has a negative net worth.” (United States v. Cassidy, Restitution Hrg. Tr. at
25 (Oct. 16, 2012) (Ex. 6). At Cassidy’s request, the restitution order sets an installment
schedule for Cassidy’s payments to BMO.2
Last week, BMO reached a settlement in principle with defendants Optionable,
Edward J. O’Connor, Mark A. Nordlicht, and Scott Connor (the “Settling Optionable
Defendants”). In late October, it reached a settlement in principle with defendant Joseph Saab
and the MF Global bankruptcy estate. BMO anticipates that it and these settling defendants will
jointly move for orders dismissing the claims against them upon the execution of final settlement
documentation and the consummation of the settlements.3

In addition to this action and the criminal proceeding, Cassidy was also named as a
defendant in related actions brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and CMEG NYMEX Inc. (“NYMEX”). In
the SEC action, Cassidy has consented to the entry of judgment against him as to liability,
(Judgment and Injunction, SEC v. Lee, No. 08-CV-9961 (S.D.N.Y. filed April 18, 2012) (Ex. 7)),
and the case remains pending as to penalties. In the CFTC action, this Court imposed a $1
million civil monetary penalty against Cassidy. (Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty, CFTC
v. Cassidy, No. 08-CV-9962 (S.D.N.Y. May 28, 2013) (Ex. 8).) Cassidy has settled with
NYMEX on undisclosed terms. (See Stipulation and Order of Dismissal, CMEG NYMEX Inc. v.
Optionable, Inc., No. 09-CV-3677 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2013) (Ex. 9).)

BMO had previously dismissed its claims against defendant Ryan Woodgate, and this
Court had previously dismissed Optionable’s counterclaims against BMO (Doc. 213).

As a result of these settlements, Cassidy is the only defendant who has not agreed
with BMO on terms to resolve this litigation. Two days before the filing of this motion, BMO
proposed to Cassidy’s counsel that BMO and Cassidy stipulate to the dismissal of BMO’s claims
against Cassidy without prejudice. Cassidy’s counsel has not responded to BMO’s proposal.
BMO accordingly seeks an order from this Court voluntarily dismissing BMO’s claims against
Cassidy without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2).
ARGUMENT
Orders of dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2) are presumptively without prejudice.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) (“Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph (2)
is without prejudice.”). The Second Circuit has held that departures from this default rule are
appropriate only where dismissal with prejudice is necessary to avoid “some plain legal
prejudice [to the defendant] other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit.” Camilli v.
Grimes, 436 F.3d 120, 123 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Cone v. W. Va. Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S.
212, 217 (1947)); accord D’Alto v. Dahon Cal., Inc., 100 F.3d 281, 283 (2d Cir. 1996)
(possibility of renewed litigation against defendant does not constitute legal prejudice) (citing
Jones v. SEC, 298 U.S. 1, 19 (1936)); Gap, Inc. v. Stone Int’l Trading, Inc., 169 F.R.D. 584, 588
(S.D.N.Y. 1997) (“the presumption in this circuit is that a court should grant a dismissal pursuant
to Rule 41(a)(2) absent a showing that defendants will suffer substantial prejudice as a result”).
Courts have pointed to five factors relevant to the determination of whether
dismissal with prejudice is required to avoid legal prejudice to the defendant: “[1] the plaintiff’s
diligence in bringing the motion; [2] any ‘undue vexatiousness’ on plaintiff's part; [3] the extent
to which the suit has progressed, including the defendant’s efforts and expense in preparation for
trial; [4] the duplicative expense of relitigation; and [5] the adequacy of plaintiff’s explanation

Case 1:09-cv-07557-GBD-JLC Document 248

for the need to dismiss.” Zagano v. Fordham Univ., 900 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir.1990). Here, each
of these factors weighs in favor of dismissal without prejudice.
First, BMO has brought this motion promptly and without delay. As soon as it
reached a settlement in principle with the remaining defendants, BMO determined that
continuing this litigation against Cassidy alone would not lead to any economic benefit, and
conferred with Cassidy’s counsel regarding the terms of a voluntary dismissal. Neither BMO
nor Cassidy has conducted any discovery since the settlement in principle with the Settling
Optionable Defendants. Therefore, Cassidy cannot show that he “expended resources or
otherwise detrimentally relied on a reasonable expectation that the plaintiff would pursue its
remaining claims.” Banco Cent. De Paraguay v. Paraguay Humanitarian Found., Inc., No. 01CV-9649, 2006 WL 3456521, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2006); see also Ascentive, LLC v.
Opinion Corp., No. 10-CV-4433, 2012 WL 1569573, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. May 3, 2012) (“measure
of diligence is whether a plaintiff moved to dismiss the complaint without prejudice within a
reasonable period of time after the occurrence of the event that led to the plaintiff's decision not
to pursue the action”).
Second, neither BMO’s motion nor its conduct in this litigation suggests “undue
vexatiousness.” For the purposes of Rule 41(a)(2), “undue vexatiousness” requires a finding of
“ill motive.” Banco Cent. De Paraguay, 2006 WL 3456521, at *5. BMO’s motive in this
litigation as against Cassidy has always been to recover the damages caused by his admitted
fraud against the Bank, and it underwent the burden of producing more than 5 million pages of
documents to support its entitlement to that recovery. The bona fide basis for this litigation is
borne out by Cassidy’s guilty plea – and subsequent prison sentence and restitution obligation –
arising out of his fraud on the Bank. These circumstances lack any resemblance to the instances

2880961.5

Case 1:09-cv-07557-GBD-JLC Document 248

Filed 11/20/13 Page 9 of 11

in which courts have found “undue vexatiousness” and “ill motive” sufficient to deny a motion
for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. See, e.g., SEC v. Oakford Corp., 181 F.R.D. 269, 271
(S.D.N.Y. 1998) (plaintiff sought “the advantage of filing its charges without having to support
them”); Mondejar v. Dow Chemical Co., No. 97-CV-62, 1998 WL 812577, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr.
29, 1998) (plaintiff filed duplicative actions relating to the same injury); Pacific Elec. Wire &
Cable Co., Ltd. v. Set Top Intern., Inc., No. 03-CV-9623, 2005 WL 578916, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.
Mar. 11, 2005) (plaintiff assured the court it would proceed with its claims only to later “go back
on their word” and seek dismissal).
Third, this litigation has not progressed to a point that dismissal without prejudice
would be unjust in light of Cassidy’s expenditures or “efforts and expense in preparation for
trial.” Zagano, 900 F.2d at 14. Cassidy has not taken a single deposition, and expert discovery
has not begun. Summary judgment briefing has not been scheduled, much less completed.
Although Cassidy has been deposed, produced documents, and attended depositions taken by
others, this (except for one deposition) would likely have occurred even absent the BMO case,
given Cassidy’s status as a defendant in three other civil litigations (those brought by the SEC,
CFTC, and NYMEX) in which discovery has been coordinated. Thus, Cassidy cannot show that
he has incurred expenses or undertaken efforts of such a substantial and costly nature that
dismissal with prejudice is required. See Staten Island Terminal, LLC v. Elberg, No. 11-CV3262, 2012 WL 1887126, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. May 23, 2012) (collecting cases where voluntary
dismissal without prejudice was granted where discovery remained incomplete and no trial date
was set).
Fourth, any “duplicative costs” of subsequent litigation between BMO and
Cassidy would be minimal given the status of this action and the likely similarity of any

6
2880961.5

Case 1:09-cv-07557-GBD-JLC Document 248

Filed 11/20/13 Page 10 of 11

subsequent action. Courts routinely observe that parties to refiled cases can avoid duplicative
costs by using work product from the earlier dismissed actions. See, e.g., id. (“If [plaintiff] again
files suit against [defendant] on these straightforward facts and allegations, [defendant] will
almost certainly be able to use what work has been completed in this action to defend any
subsequent suit.”). Therefore, Cassidy would not be prejudiced by “duplicative costs” in
defending a later suit, if any.
Fifth, BMO’s economic decision to dismiss its claims against Cassidy is a
sufficient and appropriate basis for a dismissal without prejudice. The Second Circuit has found
a defendant’s “inability to satisfy any judgment entered” to be an “entirely reasonable”
explanation for dismissal without prejudice. In re Solv-Ex Corp. Sec. Litig., 62 F. App’x 396,
398 (2d Cir. 2003). That is exactly the circumstance here, where BMO is already entitled to
restitution from Cassidy in an amount that he has claimed far exceeds his ability to pay.
Therefore, it is reasonable for BMO to decline to incur the costs of obtaining a judgment that
Cassidy will be unable to satisfy. See, e.g., Staten Island Terminal, 2012 WL 1887126, at *5
(finding defendant’s impecuniousness reasonable basis for dismissal without prejudice);
Ascentive, 2012 WL 1569573, at *6 (“[plaintiff] seeks to dismiss simply because it is no longer
in its economic interests to proceed with its claims. This explanation is perfectly reasonable.”)
(collecting cases).
Accordingly, each of the five Zagano factors weighs in favor of dismissal without
prejudice. Such a dismissal would not prejudice Cassidy; at most it would allow BMO to refile
its case against him, and it is black-letter law that such an allowance is not a legal prejudice, but
rather the presumptive and default outcome. See, e.g., BD ex rel. Jean Doe v. DeBuono, 193
F.R.D. 117, 124-25 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (“[T]he possibility that a dismissed plaintiff will refile her

action cannot be deemed ‘substantial prejudice.’ Otherwise, no action could ever be dismissed
without prejudice.”) (internal citation omitted).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, BMO respectfully requests that the Court enter an
Order pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) dismissing its claims against Cassidy without prejudice.
