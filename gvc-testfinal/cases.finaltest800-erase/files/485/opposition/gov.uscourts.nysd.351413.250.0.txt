INTRODUCTION
Defendant Kevin P. Cassidy (Cassidy) opposes Plaintiff Bank of Montreal’s
(BMO) “without prejudice” motion to dismiss its claims against him. The claims should
be dismissed, but with prejudice, because: (1) BMO cannot prove that, notwithstanding
his guilty plea (discussed infra), Cassidy or anyone else other than BMO itself caused
BMO any losses, and (2) BMO brought this lawsuit1 not because it believed Cassidy
caused its losses, but because suing Cassidy was part of a well-engineered,
professionally designed and ultimately malicious effort to shift the blame in order to
protect BMO and its CEO, William Downe (Downe). Because Cassidy did not cause
BMO any loss (and no contrary evidence exists), BMO’s repeated reference to
Cassidy’s plea deal with the Department of Justice (DOJ) is a red herring in BMO’s
argument here.
BMO, after being advised by Magistrate Judge Cott that it would most likely have
to produce Downe for deposition in January, 2014 (Gelber Dec. Ex. S), and on the
weekend before it was required to produce three witnesses for deposition, chose to fold
its tent and go home. The reasons it propounds for its departure are patently absurd
and to permit BMO to now withdraw without prejudice would interfere with Cassidy’s
right to bring, if evaluation and further research permit, a claim for malicious prosecution
as well as for other frauds just recently uncovered.
BMO’s transparently flimsy rationale for dropping its $680 million case is that
Cassidy cannot afford to pay the $8.6 million imposed as restitution if sustained on the

pending appeal.2 Neither the Department of Justice (DOJ) nor BMO has been able to
demonstrate that Cassidy caused any losses to BMO3. The evidence adduced thus far
reveals that BMO targeted Cassidy and others (Gelber Dec. Ex. M) in order to conceal
BMO’s own deeply ingrained incompetencies (Gelber Dec. Ex. G) to protect itself from
regulators, prosecutors and shareholder wrath, and to defraud its insurance carrier and
ultimately this Court.
BACKGROUND
BMO blamed its chief natural gas (NG) derivatives trader, David Lee (Lee), for
“large losses caused by Lee’s trading strategies”. (Compl. ¶1). BMO says Lee’s
“exchange of options for options” (EOO) trading strategy (Compl. ¶ 82) “caused BMO to
lose hundreds of millions of dollars.” (Compl. ¶ 87). Though Cassidy had no input into
Lee’s supposed EOO strategy, and no contrary evidence, after 4 years of discovery,
exists, BMO sued Cassidy not Lee.
BMO alleged Lee falsely entered EOO trades into BMO’s books (Compl. ¶ 86),
under the supervision of BMO employee Robert Moore (Moore), who (i) knew about
Lee’s EOO trades, (ii) knew that Lee was falsely depicting them as profitable (iii) told
Lee to stop and (iv) failed to report Lee to Moore’s superiors. (Compl. ¶¶ 93-95).
Though Cassidy had no access to BMO’s books, BMO sued Cassidy not Moore.
On or around May 23, 2007, BMO filed a Form 6K with the SEC. reporting a
“previously announced $680 million dollar” year to date “Commodities Trading” loss.

A copy of Cassidy’s “Brief for Defendant-Appellant” dated November 7, 2013, is annexed as
Exhibit B to the Gelber Dec.

Indeed, the restitution is not premised on any losses supposedly caused to BMO but rather on
the amount of money BMO paid in brokerage commissions and bonuses to its own employee.

BMO’s commodities trading loss was the foreseeable culmination of years of
defective valuation procedures, poor risk controls and inadequate supervisory systems.
After BMO disclosed, in its 2001 annual report, a $51 million NG trading loss4 to its
shareholders, it retained a major accounting firm (Price Waterhouse) that advised BMO
it had serious defects in its systems. BMO ignored the advice. So, in 2003 BMO was
sued by AEP Energy Services, Inc. (AEP)5, in connection with a $94 million dollar
valuation discrepancy. BMO’s defective valuation procedures, which included applying
wrong formulae, also regularly caused valuation issues with counterparties, such as
HETCO, with whom BMO had a $5 million valuation discrepancy.6
By early 2007, with no effective controls in place, BMO had amassed an “utterly
gigantic” 7 mostly proprietary position of over 7.6 million NG derivatives contracts.8
In late 2006 or early 2007, as its problems started to rise to the surface, BMO
engaged Deloitte & Touche (Deloitte), to analyze BMO’s systems. In April, 2007,
Deloitte rendered a non-public report: “BMO Capital Markets Commodity Risk
Measurement, Valuation & Control Infrastructure Assessment” (the Deloitte Report)

BMO blamed the loss on its then trader Joseph Adevai. The SEC, in 2008 and again in 2012,
alleged that BMO had fired Adevai for mismarking his book (i.e., assigning incorrect values to
BMO’s NG portfolio); first at ¶16 of its complaint in SEC v. Lee et al. 08 Civ. 9961
(GBD)(S.D.N.Y.) and again at ¶22 of its amended complaint filed August 14, 2012.

detailing BMO’s 40 (forty) or so deviations (six of which Deloitte deemed severe) from
standard industry practice in the conduct, operation and valuation of BMO’s high-risk
NG derivatives trading efforts9.
The Deloitte Report nowhere criticized Optionable, notwithstanding the false
stories to that effect leaked by BMO to the press. It did, however, severely critique
BMO, noting among BMO’s deviations from industry standards: BMO’s failure to (i)
comparatively validate recorded telephone orders with actual trade confirmations; (ii)
use automated procedures, to upload official price data sources and instead rely on its
Front Office to manually update pricing spreadsheets; (iii) provide sufficient
independence to Market Risk to ensure the integrity of gathered data; (iv) include critical
portfolio attributes such as position by book, commodity and instrument in the
management reporting package; (v) use more than one external source of data10; (vi)
use an adequate valuation equation or formula; (vii) account for seasonality in its
valuations; (viii) meet prevailing industry practices for risk model testing by using a six
non-consecutive day approach when standard minimum industry practice called for a
thirty consecutive business day approach; among some thirty or so other deficiencies.
SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND EVENTS TO BMO’S 2007 BLOW-UP
In June / July 2006, the MotherRock LP (MotherRock) hedge fund formed by
former NYMEX executives lost some $230 million dollars trading NG derivatives. Then,
in September 2006, in the wake of MotherRock, Amaranth Advisors LLC (Amaranth), a
BMO client, lost a record $6.5 billion dollars trading NG derivatives.

BMO was thus on sharp notice of the severe risks of not rectifying its defective
systems. Nevertheless, in January, 2007, Bill Downe declined to change BMO’s
“method for determining market” even though BMO’s Chief Risk Officer, Bob
McGlashen, emailed Downe on January 26, 2007 to report a possible $50 million11
“adjustment” in “Bob Moore’s book, predominantly Natural Gas.”
In fact, instead of reducing risk, BMO, with zero input from Cassidy or
Optionable, voluntarily chose to increase risk multifold, jumping into the breach created
by the Mother Rock / Amaranth debacles, acquiring an unprecedented position in NG
options, some 7.6 million open contracts12, upon information and belief the single
largest position in global trading history, dwarfing the number of contracts that had
contributed to the demise of Amaranth.
THE EVENTS THAT CAUSED BMO’S TRADING LOSSES
BMO allowed its NG derivatives portfolio to grow so large that, starting in the fall
of 2006, BMO was losing over $1 million every single day (some days approaching $2
million), month in and month out, due only to the passage of time; its money was
figuratively “evaporating”; literally disappearing. BMO positioned itself to automatically
lose $2-$3 million every 36 hours or so. The automatic loss of value in an options book

In a New York Times report in early 2011, Warren Buffett defended Berkshire Hathaway’s use
of derivatives, when the company had about 250 derivative contracts. “I want to know every
contract…but I can’t do it with 23,000 that a bunch of traders are putting on.” He noted that
when Berkshire bought General Re in 1998, General Re had 23,000 derivative contracts. “I
could have hired 15 of the smartest people, you know, math majors, Ph.D.’s. I could have given
them carte blanche to devise any reporting system that would enable me to get my mind around
what exposure that I had, and it wouldn’t have worked,” he said to the government panel. “Can
you imagine 23,000 contracts with 900 institutions all over the world with probably 200 of them
names I can’t pronounce?” Berkshire decided to unwind the derivative deals, incurring some
$400 million in losses. Warren Buffet could not handle 23 thousand derivatives contracts, but
Downe and BMO believed BMO could handle 7.6 million of them.

is called “theta loss: or “theta erosion”. Just as water in a pot over a fire evaporates due
to heat, the value of options in a portfolio decreases due to the passage of time. To
carry the analogy forward, instead of turning off the heat, BMO put more water into the
pot. “The time decay was in the range of $1-1.5MM per day over the last quarter. The
business was unable to offset this cost of theta due to lower client flow and lower
volatility. (A quick calculation of approximately USD1mm/day for the quarter is
USD90mm of theta expense and explains a large portion of our trading losses.)”13
The “utterly gigantic” (Gelber Dec. Ex. E) volume of BMO’s open contracts,
combined with (i) BMO’s multiple deviations from industry standards as detailed in the
Deloitte Report (Gelber Dec. Ex. G); (ii) million-dollar-a-day theta erosion (Gelber Dec.
Ex. I), and (iii) BMO’s failure to heed Cassidy’s advice (detailed below), among
other factors within BMO’s exclusive control, predictably resulted in BMO’s second
major loss in seven years.
Downe himself said the 2007 loss would have not occurred had BMO had proper
risk controls in place. Specifically, on or around May 5, 2007, Downe wrote: “The reason
the book is illiquid, as opposed to the market being illiquid, is it has a lot of thinly traded
positions. It happens to be a fact and you couldn’t lose this much money by taking
one gigantic bet if you had risk controls in place”.14 (Emphasis added). But BMO did
not have such controls. Cassidy not telling BMO that the accurate month-end sample

quotes Optionable was testing in the market originated with Lee was irrelevant to BMO’s
losses.
Moreover, BMO knew, without needing to be told by Cassidy, that the quotes
originated with Lee. ”Some of Optionable quotes come from BMO….”15 And even more
pointedly: “The current practice of collecting quotes from other broker’s is not
independent as we go through the trader to obtain them.”16 (Emphasis added).
After BMO announced its loss, the Canadian press questioned the competence
and risk management capabilities of BMO and particularly Downe.
For example, on May 18, 2007, Canadian Banks & Insurance wrote:
This is not life-threatening for a bank that earned $2.7-billion in profit last
year, but its credibility is on life support. The crisis exposes a
disconnect between its reputation as the safe, cautious bank among
Canada’s Big Five and internal practices. And it happened in the
division Mr. Downe used to head, capital markets. Given the size of
the losses, some believe they build up over many months. “The absolute
size of the estimated commodity trading losses far exceeds the bank’s
average market value exposure to commodities risk, is disproportionate to
its total trading revenues, and does not reflect BMO’s stated strategy of
being a low-risk bank,” credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said in a
note. [Emphasis provided].

Evidently fearful of the truth being exposed by the press, BMO hired Dan Klores
Communications LLC (DKC), a public relations firm, to implement a “strategy of
assigning blame to Optionable” using “off the record tactics”17 to manipulate Canadian
newspapers, such as the Financial Post and the Globe and Mail, to issue false leaks to

the press and make false allegations, to perpetrate a cover-up of BMO’s exclusive
responsibility for the claimed 2007 losses and scapegoat Optionable and Cassidy. For
example:
a.

BMO falsely leaked that the Deloitte Report was critical of
Optionable, when it was not; it was critical only of BMO;

b.

BMO falsely said that the “reliability” of quotes from Optionable was
in question, when the quotes were unquestionably reliable;

c.

BMO falsely asserted that a “multiple contributor” source of monthly
quotes – Totem – showed vastly inconsistent quotes from those
provided by Optionable, even though, according to an from the
Director of Totem Commodities Tom Charlesworth to Murray
McIntosh at BMO18 there was no material difference when an
“apples to apples” comparison was made;

d.

BMO falsely and maliciously leaked that Cassidy discouraged BMO
from checking sources other than Optionable for month-end data
points when the well-documented opposite was true – Cassidy told
BMO manager Murray McIntosh (McIntosh) to use additional
sources19 and not rely exclusively on Optionable. Cassidy’s advice
was known and acknowledged by BMO’s risk officer, Penny
Somerville.20

The “story” concocted by BMO was: (i) BMO sought end of the month market
data about a miniscule portion of its NG book (ii) BMO wanted these end of month data
to be “independent” of data provided by Lee, as supervised by Moore, (iii) BMO lost its
shirt because Cassidy did not tell BMO that the data Optionable circulated in the market
was not independent as it originated with BMO through Lee, and (iv) Cassidy prevented

and its various oversight teams from doing their jobs by discouraging BMO from getting
data from sources other than Optionable.
BMO’s story was and remains preposterous because:
(i)

BMO had daily access to actual market data from NYMEX beyond
the reach of Optionable and, though obligated by GAAP to use
daily NYYMEX data, did not;

(ii)

BMO risk department personnel always knew that the month-end
data provided by Optionable could not be and was not independent.
In fact, Jeff Wang in BMO’s market risk department emailed Murray
McIntosh on December 7, 2006, observing: “about segregating
BMO quotes from the non-BMO quotes [t]here is no direct way to
do it”21; (Emphasis provided).

(iii)

BMO knew (a) that “some of Optionable quotes come from BMO”
(Gelber Dec. Ex. K) and (b) that the quotes were also “not
independent as we go through the trader to obtain them”
(Gelber Dec. Ex. L); and

(iv)

Cassidy directly and unequivocally told BMO to use additional
sources for month-end data. (Gelber Dec. Exhibit P)

In fact the accurate data provided by Optionable to BMO, alerted BMO to over

BMO’s fictional account began to unravel and the DOJ, despite its vast
investigative power, was unable to identify any evidence that Cassidy ever provided
false or inaccurate data to BMO, or that Cassidy caused BMO to lose any money.
Accordingly, the DOJ repeatedly, over the course of three years, reduced the BMO-fed
false accusations, superseding a six-count indictment with two different four-count
indictments, which eliminated the false accusations about transmitting inaccurate
quotes to BMO23, until it minimized its charges against Cassidy on the eve of trial and
settled with Cassidy in exchange for a plea to a single count information charging
conspiracy with Lee to commit wire fraud.
Cassidy’s allocution also reflected the accuracy of the information transmitted:
In the fall of 2006, I arranged for my company Optionable to develop a
service called RealMarks, which was designed to provide market quotes
concerning natural gas option contracts. From September 2006 to April
2007, this service provided market quotes to the risk management
department of Bank of Montreal. While I believed that the RealMarks
quotes provided to BMO were legitimate, most of the quotes that
RealMarks provided to Bank of Montreal's risk management department
originated with Bank of Montreal's own trader David Lee. I agreed with Lee
that on month end days he would provide Optionable with the quotes,
Optionable would make an effort to show the quotes to other traders in the
market, and then at the end of the day, Optionable would send quotes to
Bank of Montreal's risk management department. Although I understood
that BMO's risk management department wanted quotes that were not
contributed to RealMarks by Lee and felt it was an important factor, I did
not tell the risk management department that many of the quotes had
originated with Lee. I knew this was wrong at the time.
THE COURT: Does the government agree that that is a sufficient
allocution?
MS. BERMAN: Yes, your Honor, we agree.

Even the CFTC acknowledged that “We are not alleging nor do we believe we have to allege
that what Lee was providing them was inaccurate.” Portion of transcript of oral argument held

The tragic irony of this case is that Cassidy pleaded guilty to failing to tell BMO
what it already knew. But the reality of the matter, based on uncontroverted
documentary evidence, is that BMO was fully responsible for its own losses and that it
engineered an insidious campaign to destroy lives and businesses in order to protect
itself and William Downe.
In sum, none of BMO’s allegations in the complaint are supported by the
evidence, all of which fairly well points to a maliciously prosecute Cassidy for the
nefarious purpose of hiding its own embarrassing incompetencies.

ARGUMENT
“A Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal may be conditioned on whatever terms the district
court deems necessary to offset the prejudice the defendant may suffer from a
dismissal without prejudice.” Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal-MCA Music Publishing,
Inc., 583 F. 3d 948 (6th Cir. 2009). See also, LeBlang Motors, Ltd. v. Suburu of Am.,
Inc., 148 F.3d 680, 685 (7th Cir. 1998); McCants v. Ford Motor Co., 781 F.2d 855, 856
(11th Cir. 1986).
BMO relies on Camilli v. Grimes, 436 F. 3d 120 (2d Cir. 2006), which observes:
“This Court reviews a decision to dismiss without prejudice pursuant to
Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2) for abuse of discretion. See Zagano v. Fordham
University, 900 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir.1990). Two lines of authority have
developed with respect to the circumstances under which a dismissal
without prejudice might be improper. One line indicates that such a
dismissal would be improper if "the defendant would suffer some plain
legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit." Cone v.
West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 217, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed.
849 (1947); see Jones v. SEC, 298 U.S. 1, 19, 56 S.Ct. 654, 80 L.Ed.
1015 (1936). Another line indicates that the test for dismissal without
prejudice involves consideration of various factors, known as the Zagano
factors, including (1) the plaintiff's diligence in bringing the motion, (2) any

11

Case 1:09-cv-07557-GBD-JLC Document 250

Filed 11/27/13 Page 15 of 17

undue vexatiousness on the plaintiff's part, (3) the extent to which the suit
has progressed, including the defendant's efforts and expense in
preparation for trial, (4) the duplicative expense of relitigation, and (5) the
adequacy of the plaintiff's explanation for the need to dismiss. See D'Alto
v. Dahon California, Inc., 100 F.3d 281, 283 (2d Cir.1996); Zagano, 900
F.2d at 14.”

BMO here argues the five so-called Zagano factors, set forth above.
First, BMO argues it brought this motion “promptly” after settling with the other
defendants. BMO actually filed this motion before it settled with the other defendants,
but did so after four years of litigation, which itself was not commenced until two years
after others filed various suits and claims arising out of BMO’s supposed harm. In fact,
by the time BMO sued, the statute of limitations had run on any possible federal
securities fraud claims.
Second, BMO argues it had no ill motive in bringing the lawsuit. This argument is
premised on a falsehood, as the documents annexed to the accompanying Gelber Dec.
readily demonstrate. Notwithstanding Cassidy’s guilty plea, BMO never suffered losses
from any act or omission of Cassidy, and nobody, certainly not the DOJ (Gelber Dec.
Ex. B) has been able to show that the conduct to which Cassidy allocuted caused BMO
any loss.
BMO’s losses were caused by (i) ignoring Cassidy’s advice to get month-end
data from more than one source, (ii) by deviating in approximately 40 ways from
industry standards, (Gelber Dec, Ex. G) (iii) by refusing to consider changes to its
methodologies, even when facing a $50 million loss, (Gelber Dec. Ex. H) and (iv) by
putting on such a large position that it was losing over $1 million dollars every day
simply by time deterioration (Gelber Dec. Ex. I). There is no evidence to the contrary.

Third. Cassidy noticed the deposition of Downe, and BMO opposed it, resulting in
a conference before Magistrate Judge Cott in which he indicated that BMO would likely
have to produce Downe in January.24 On the weekend before BMO was to produce
three other witnesses for depositions by the defendants, BMO, not wanting the truth to
emerge, “promptly” pushed for settlements, not yet executed, and made this motion.
Cassidy was preparing to move to amend his second affirmative defense – in
pari delicto – in order to outline for the court BMO’s misconduct.25 Cassidy to the best
of his hobbled ability has acted as aggressively as he could in connection with this
litigation and would clearly be prejudiced by a “without prejudice” dismissal.
Fourth, there would not likely be duplicative costs, but it would be more
expensive to gear up for a second litigation.
Fifth, while Cassidy has no economic ability to bear any judgment against him,
assuming he would lose, it was equally true at the beginning of this case that he was
not able to economically bear a judgment of $680 million. Right now, BMO is entitled to
nothing. The restitution imposed against Cassidy is under appeal. (Gelber Dec. Ex. B).
BMO’s actions were malicious and it brought this case for multiple improper
purposes, as detailed above. Cassidy has the right to sue for malicious prosecution.
That right is impaired by a “without prejudice” dismissal. Under such circumstances, the
Court would be within its discretion to direct dismissal with prejudice. In re Sizzler
Restaurants Intern. Inc., 262 BR 811 (Br. C.D. Cal. 2001).

Because BMO’s claim here is a claim for money damages, and because BMO
cannot prove that Cassidy caused it any losses, BMO also could lose on the merits here
at trial. And clearly, an attempt to avoid an adverse decision on the merits may also
constitute legal prejudice. See, Phillips USA, Inc. v. Allflex USA, Inc., 77 F.3d 354, 358
(10th Cir. 1996).
Accordingly, the claims should be dismissed with prejudice as to Cassidy.
CONCLUSION
BMO’s claims should be dismissed with prejudice and the court should award
such other and further relief as it deems just and equitable.
