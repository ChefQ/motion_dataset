MOTION TO STRIKE EXHIBIT
Defendant Maryland Judiciary/District Court of Maryland, by its undersigned
counsel, moves to strike Plaintiff’s exhibit 8, (ECF 11-9), and in support of that motion
submits this memorandum of law.
ARGUMENT
In opposition to Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff attempts to
introduce an unrelated, unsigned, and unverified complaint with the Commission on
Judicial Disabilities. Complaints against judges are governed by Maryland Rules 16-803
to 16-810. The rules, adopted by the Court of Appeals, establish a Commission on
Judicial Disabilities, and govern the conduct of judges in Maryland. Complaints against
judges are governed by Md. Rule 16-805, which provides, in pertinent part, that:
1

Case 1:13-cv-00539-JRG Document 18 Filed 08/25/13 Page 2 of 4

All complaints against a judge shall be sent to Investigative Counsel. Upon
receiving a complaint that does not qualify as a formal complaint but
indicates that a judge may have a disability or have committed sanctionable
conduct, Investigative Counsel shall, if possible: (1) inform the
complainant of the right to file a formal complaint; (2) inform the
complainant that a formal complaint must be supported by affidavit and
provide the complainant with the appropriate form of affidavit; and (3)
inform the complainant that unless a formal complaint is filed within 30
days after the date of the notice, Investigative Counsel is not required to
take action, and the complaint may be dismissed.
Md. Rule 16-805(a). All proceedings under Md. Rule 16-805 are confidential. Md. Rule
16-810(a)(2). Because ECF 11-9 is inadmissible hearsay and because it is confidential as
a matter of law, ECF 11-9, must be stricken and cannot form the basis of a genuine
dispute of a material fact.
To withstand a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party must produce
competent evidence sufficient to reveal the existence of a genuine issue of material fact
for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Ray Commc'ns, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns,
Inc., 673 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir. 2012); Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. Beverley, 404 F.3d
243, 246-47 (4th Cir. 2005).

While a party may support its position on summary

judgment by citing to almost any material in the record, the party's reliance on that
material may be defeated if "the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be
presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).
The alleged complaint against Judge Hargrove is unsigned, unsworn and
unverified and its content would be inadmissible hearsay. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4);

Evans v. Techs. Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 962 (4th Cir. 1996) ("[S]ummary
judgment affidavits cannot be conclusory or based upon hearsay." (citations omitted)).
Because proceedings which do not result in disciple by the Commission on
Judicial Disabilities are themselves confidential, Plaintiff cannot offer the substance of
the complaint "in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).
Therefore, Plaintiff cannot produce admissible evidence to support the assertions
contained in the Complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B), (c)(2).
This Court's determination regarding the admissibility of evidence for summary
judgment purposes is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Nader v. Blair, 549 F.3d
953, 963 (4th Cir. 2008). Therefore, this Court should exercise its considered discretion
and strike the exhibit as inadmissible in its entirety.
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court GRANT
this motion and dismiss this case with prejudice or enter judgment in its favor as a matter
of law.

Respectfully submitted,

Douglas F. Gansler
Attorney General of Maryland
