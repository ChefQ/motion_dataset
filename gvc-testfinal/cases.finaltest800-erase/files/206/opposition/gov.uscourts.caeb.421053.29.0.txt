of their opposition to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ("JPMC" or "Movant")
motion for relief from the automatic stay.

the Automatic Stay. In addition, Movant claims that there is no equity under 11 U.S.C.
362(d)(2) and Lack of Equity and protection under 11 U.S.C. 361 and 362(d)(1).

Contrary to Movant's claims, there is equity in the subject property. In addition,

Movant has no legal standing to bring this Motion based on evidence produced.
DEBTOR'S MORTGAGE

On or about 01/20/2005, Debtor executed a Promissory Note payable to Washington
Mutual Bank, FA and a Deed of Trust (the "DOT") securing such Promissory Note.

In 2008, WaMu was having increasingly large mortgage loan losses. It suffered three
straight quarters of losses totaling $6.1 billion, and was encountering increasingly difficult
market conditions. On September 15, 2008, an outflow of deposits began that reached $16.7
billion in only eight business days. As a result, on September 25, 2008, OTS closed WaMu,
finding the bank to have "insufficient liquidity to meet its obligations" and thus to be in an
"unsafe and unsound condition to conduct business." OTS appointed FDIC as Receiver on the
same day. See OTS Order 2008-36, Exhibit 1.

THE WAMU RECEIVERSHIP AND THE P&A AGREEMENT.

Upon its appointment, FDIC Receiver succeeded to all the rights, titles, powers,
privileges, and operations of WaMu with respect to the bank, its assets, and its valid
obligations. 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1821(d)(2). The powers and duties of FDIC Receiver include the
ability to "transfer any asset or liability of the institution in default... without any approval,
assignment, or consent with respect to such transfer," id. 0x00A7 1821(d)(2)(G)(i) (II), and to
otherwise act in "the best interests of the [failed] depository institution, its depositors, or the
[FDIC]," id. 0x00A7 1821(d)(2)(J).

Immediately following FDIC Receiver's appointment on September 25, 2008, FDIC
Receiver accepted JPMC's bid to "purchase substantially all of the assets and assume all
deposit and substantially all other liabilities of [WaMu]" in a P&A Agreement designed to
transfer the "whole bank." Exhibit 1, P&A Agreement at 1; id. 0x00A70x00A7 2.1, 3.1; see id. at 20. Asa
result of this transaction, JPMC acquired the ongoing banking operations of WaMu, which

"consisted of a retail bank network of 2,244 branches, a nationwide credit card lending

business, a multi-family and commercial real estate lending business, and nationwide
mortgage banking activities," specifically including WaMu's valuable mortgage servicing
rights with respect to hundreds of billions of dollars of residential mortgage loans.

Schedule 3.2 specifically identified the "rights of [WaMu] to provide mortgage
servicing for others... and related contracts" as assets purchased by JPMC. P&A Agreement
at 36. The P&A Agreement also provided that "notwithstanding Section 4.8," JPMC
specifically "assumes" (under Section 2.1) and "purchases" (under Section 3.1) "all mortgage
servicing rights and obligations of [WaMu]." Id. 0x00A70x00A7 2.1, 3.1. Thus, while JPMC generally had
the right under Section 4.8 of the P&A Agreement to elect not to assume existing agreements
"which provide for the rendering of services by or to [WaMu]," JPMC could not reject any
agreements providing for WaMu's mortgage servicing rights and obligations. Id. 0x00A7 4.8.
Consistent with JPMC's irrevocable purchase and assumption of WaMu's mortgage servicing
activities, the PRA Agreement required FDIC Receiver to deliver to JPMC "as soon as
practicable" all "[I]oan and collateral records and Credit Files and other documents," title
records "pertaining to ... real estate mortgages," and other "Records pertaining to the Assets"
purchased by JPMC. Id. 0x00A7 6.1.

THE TRUSTS AND THE GOVERNING AGREEMENTS

DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY ("DBNTC") purports to assert breach
claims with respect to 127 separate Trusts created between 1992 and 2007, for which
DBNTC allegedly served in the capacity of Trustee or Indenture Trustee, and for which WaMu
(or subsidiaries, affiliates, or predecessors-in-interest of WaMu) allegedly served as seller,
depositor, and servicer!. According to DBNTC, the original outstanding balance of the 99
"Primary Trusts" was approximately $165 billion, while the outstanding principal balance of
the Primary Trusts at the time of WaMu's closure on September 25, 2008 was approximately
$45 billion. DBNTC alleges that the 28 "Secondary Trusts" are trusts through which WaMu

"issued mortgage-backed or derivative securities whose performance is dependent, in whole

 

' See, Case No. 1:09-cv-01656 (US District Court for the District of Columbia).

or in part, on the performance of the Primary Trusts or of other residential mortgage-backed
securities issued by [WaMu]."
ARGUMENT
JPMC DOES NOT HAVE STANDING TO REQUEST RELIEF FROM STAY

The promissory note was made payable to WAMU. No record document suggests that
it has been endorsed to JPMC by FDIC to JPMC or any other named entity. Furthermore,
evidence suggested that all WAMU loan was part of the securitization trusts with DBNTC as
trustee and holder of the Promissory Note.

The promissory note attached to Movant's motion was a Fixed Rate Note executed on
December 8, 2004 for a different address?. However, the Adjustable Rate Note attached to
the Deed of Trust identified correct property. Furthermore, the Deed of Trust as attached to
Movant's Exhibit? was not recorded with the County Recorder and has no value.

Stay-relief requests are governed by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4001(a)(1), to which Fed. R.
Bankr. P. 9014 is applicable. Rule 9014, in turn, incorporates Rule 7017, which makes Fed. R.
Bankr. P. 17 applicable ("[a]n action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in
interest.";) The standing doctrine "involves both constitutional limitations on federal-court
jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise." Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125,
128-29, 125 S.Ct. 564, 160 L.Ed.2d 519 (2004) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95
S.Ct 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)). Constitutional standing under Article III requires, at a
minimum, that a party must have suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the
defendant's conduct, that the injury be traced to the challenged action, and that it is likely to
be redressed by a favorable decision. (Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Am. United for
Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982)
(citations and internal quotations omitted)). Beyond the Article II] requirements of injury in

fact, causation, and redressibility, the creditor must also have prudential standing, which is a

judicially-created set of principles that places limits on the class of persons who may invoke
the courts' powers. (Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)).
As a prudential matter, a plaintiff must assert "his own legal interests as the real party in
interest". (Dunmore v. United States, 358 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2004), as found in
Fed.R.Civ.P. 17, which provides "[a]n action must be prosecuted in the name of real party in
interest.")

Transfer of mortgage paper may be made outright (sale) or by pledge (as security fora
loan to the transferor.). In either event, to perfect the transfer, the transferor should
physically deliver the note to the transferee. Without a physical transfer, a sale of the note
could be invalided as a fraudulent conveyance (under California Civil Code 0x00A7 3440), anda
transfer in pledge could be invalidated as an unperfected (under Com.Code 0x00A70x00A7 9313-9314).
(California Mortgages and Deed of Trust, and Foreclosure Litigation, by Roger Bernhardt,
Fourth Edition, section 1.26). One without a pecuniary interest in the Mortgage Loan is not
an obligee under the debt and, thus, has no legal standing to foreclose ab initio. (Watkins v.
Bryant (1891) 91 C 492, 27 P77).

Here, the Note was executed in favor of WAMU. FDIC took over WAMU and sold the
mortgage servicing business to JPMC. There is no evidence that FDIC transferred its
beneficial interest to JPMC beside the mortgage servicing right. Furthermore, evidence
clearing indicated that WAMU no longer had interest in the subject NOTE because its
beneficial interest was sold to DBNTC as trustee of securitized trust. Thus, FDIC could not sell
to JPMC what WAMU did not have.

DEBTOR HAS EQUITY IN THE PROPERTY

Debtor's Schedule A and D are inaccurate and has been amended. According to title
report from Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation and Fidelity National Title Insurance
Company, there is only one mortgage on 01/20/2005 by WAMU in the amount of
$300,000.00. A true and correct copy of which is attached herewith as Exhibit 2. Therefore,

assuming arguendo that JPMC is the holder of the Note; its interest is adequately protected.

CONCLUSION
JPMC does not demonstrate any document to support its claim that it has standing to
enforce the promissory note. Debtor contends that the real party in interest has not come
forward and the creditor lacks standing.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Receivership Of A Federal Savings Association

Date: September 25, 2008
Order No.: 2008-36
OTS No.: 0855]

The Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), or his designee, in
cooperation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), has determined to
appoint the FDIC as receiver of Washington Mutual Bank, Henderson, Nevada (Savings
Bank).

GROUNDS FOR APPOINTMENT OF FDIC AS RECEIVER
FOR THE SAVINGS BANK

The Director, or his designee, based upon the administrative record finds and
determines the following:

(i) The Savings Bank is likely to be unable to pay its obligations or meet its
depositors' demands in the normal course of business: and

(ii) The Institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business.

The Savings Bank is a Federally chartered savings bank, the accounts of which
are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIP). The Savings Bank has its home office
in Henderson, Nevada. As of June 30, 2008, the Savings Bank reported total assets of
$307 billion.

DISCUSSION OF GROUNDS FOR APPOINTMENT
OF A RECEIVER FOR THE SAVINGS BANK

Section 5(d)(2)(A) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1464(d)(2)(A), provides that the Director may appoint a receiver for any insured savings
association if the Director determines that one or more grounds specified in section
11(c\(S) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1821(c)(5), exist.

Under section 11(c)(5\(F) of the FDIA. the Director May appoint a receiver ifa
savings association is likely to be unable to pay its obligations or meet its depositors'
demands in the normal course of business because it does not have sufficient liquid assets
to fund expected withdrawals. The Savings Bank has insufficient cash and liquid assets
convertible to cash necessary to pay its obligations and the expected withdrawal demands
of its depositors. The Savings Bank has suffered significant cash outflows, exceeding

 

1/3

Exhibit 1

 
 

 

Order No.: 2008-36
Page: 2

$22 billion since July 2008, in part because of adverse publicity. The Savings Bank has
limited and diminishing liquidity sources available to it and the current rate of outflow
will deplete the Savings Bank's cash resources and liquidity within a short period of time.

Therefore, the Director concludes that the Savings Bank is likely to be unable to
pay its obligations or meet its depositors' demands in the normal course of business
because it does not have sufficient liquid assets to pay those obligations and fund the
expected withdrawals.

Under section 11(cent)(5)(C) of the FDIA, the Director may appoint a receiver if a
savings association is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business. The
Savings Bank is in an unsafe and unsound condition as a result of its severe liquidity
strain, deteriorating asset quality, and continuing significant negative operating earnings
with no realistic prospects for raising capital to ensure that it can repay all of its
liabilities, including deposits.

The Director, or his designee, therefore, has determined that grounds for the
appointment for a receiver for the Savings Bank exist under section 5(d)(2) of the HOLA,
and sections 11(c)(5)(C) and (F) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1821(cent)(5)(C) and (F),

ACTIONS ORDERED OR APPROVED
Appointment of a Receiver

The Director, or his designee, hereby appoints the FDIC as receiver for the
Savings Bank, for the purpose of liquidation, pursuant to section 5(d)(2) of the HOLA,
and section 11(c)(6)(B) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1821(c)(6\(B).

Delegation of Authority to Act for OTS

The Director, or his designee, hereby authorizes the OTS West Regional Director,
or his designee, and the Deputy Chief Counsel for the Business Transactions Division of
the Chief Counsel's office, or his designee, to: (i) certify orders; (ii) sign, execute, attest,
or certify other documents of OTS issued or authorized by this Order; (iii) designate the
persons or entity that will give notice of the appointment of a receiver for the Savings
Bank and serve the Savings Bank with a copy of this Order pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 0x00A7
558.2; and (iv) perform such other functions of OTS necessary or appropriate for
implementation of this Order. All documents to be issued under the authority of this
Order must be first approved, in form and content, by the Chief Counsel's Office. In
addition, the Director, or his designee, hereby authorizes the Deputy Chief Counsel for
the Business Transactions Division of the Chief Counsel's office, or his designee, to
