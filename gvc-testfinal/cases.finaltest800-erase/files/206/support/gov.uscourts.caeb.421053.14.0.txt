result of said filing, certain acts and proceedings against Debtor and the bankruptcy estate are stayed
as provided in 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I

MOVANT _IS_ ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM THE
AUTOMATIC STAY UNDER 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362(d)(2).

NO EQUITY
11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362(d)(2) provides that relief from the automatic stay shall be granted if the

debtor does not have any equity in the property and the property is not necessary to the debtor's
effective reorganization.

In In re San Clemente Estates, 5 B.R. 605 (Bankr. S.D. Cal. 1980), the court stated that:

0x00A7 362(d)(2) reflects congressional intent to allow creditors to
immediately proceed against the property where the debtor has no
equity and it is unnecessary to the reorganization, even where the
debtor can provide adequate protection under 0x00A7 362(d)(1). (Emphasis
added).

 

Id. at 610 (emphasis added).

In In re Mikole Developers, Inc., 14 B.R. 524, 525 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1981), the court stated

 

that in determining whether equity exists in the property for purposes of 0x00A7 362(d)(2), all
encumbrances are totaled, whether or not all the lienholders have joined in the request for relief from
stay. The Ninth Circuit has concurred with this view in Stewart v. Gurley, 745 F.2d 1194 (9th Cir.
1984).

An appropriate cost of sale factor should also be added to determine if the debtor has any

equity in the property. La Jolla Mortgage Fund v. Rancho El Cajon Associates, 18 B.R. 283, 289

On or about January 13, 2005, Debtor, for valuable consideration, made, executed and
delivered to the original beneficiary Washington Mutual Bank, FA (hereinafter "WAMU" ) a Note in
the principal sum of $300,000.00 (the "Note"). Pursuant to the Note, Debtor is obligated to make
monthly principal and interest payments commencing March 1, 2005, and continuing until February
1, 2035, when all outstanding amounts are due and payable. The Note provides that, in the event of
default, the holder of the Note has the option of declaring all unpaid sums immediately due and
payable. A copy of the Note is attached to the concurrently served and filed Exhibits to the
Declaration in Support of Motion for Relief From Automatic Stay ("Exhibits") as exhibit A and
incorporated herein by reference.

On or about January 13, 2005, the Debtor made, executed and delivered to WAMU a Deed of
Trust (the "Deed of Trust") granting WAMU a security interest in real property commonly described
as 31900 Success Valley Drive, Porterville, California 93257-9644 (the "Real Property"), which is
more fully described in the Deed of Trust. The Deed of Trust provides that attorneys' fees and costs
incurred as a result of the Debtor's bankruptcy case may be included in the outstanding balance
under the Note. The Deed of Trust was recorded on January 20, 2005, in the Official Records of
Tulare County, State of California. A copy of the Deed of Trust is attached to the Exhibits as
exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.

On or about September 25, 2008, WAMU was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision and
the FDIC was named receiver. As authorized by Section 11(d)(2)(G)()(II) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1821(d)(G)G)dD, the FDIC, as receiver of WAMU, may transfer
any asset or lability of WAMU without any approval, assignment, or consent with respect to such
transfer. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Purchase and Assumption Agreement between
the FDIC as receiver of WAMU and Movant dated September 25, 2008, Movant acquired certain of
the assets, including all loans and all loan commitments of WAMU. Asa result, on September 25,
2008, Movant became the holder of the loans and loan commitments of WAMU.

The obligation under the Note is in default as of June 1, 2010, for failure to make payments
to Movant. As of December 11, 2010, the total obligation due and owing under the Note is in the

approximate amount of $290,469.24, representing the principal balance in the amount of

$274,773.32, interest in the sum of $5,025.28, late charges in the amount of $777.15, escrow
advances in the amount of $8,904.41, recoverable balance in the amount of $967.38, and other fees
in the amount of $21.70. This is an approximate amount for purposes of this Motion only, and
should not be relied upon as such to pay off the subject loan as interest and additional advances may
come due subsequent to the filing of the Motion. An exact payoff amount can be obtained by
contacting Movant's counsel. Further, Movant has incurred additional post-petition attorneys' fees
and costs in bringing the instant Motion. Moreover, the total arrears under the Note are in the
approximate sum of $21,792.05, excluding the post-petition attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
filing the instant Motion.
II.
RELIEF FROM STAY
LACK OF EQUITY

Movant is informed and believes that, based on the Debtor's bankruptcy Schedules and
Statements, the fair market value of the Property is approximately $343,000.00. Copies of the
Debtor's bankruptcy Schedules "A" and "D" are collectively attached to the Exhibits as exhibit C
and incorporated herein by reference.

Based on the above, Movant maintains that the equity in the Property is as follows:

Fair Market Value: $343,000.00
Less:

Movant's Trust Deed $290,469.24
Chase's Second Trust $100,000.00
Deed

Costs of Sale (8%) $27,440.00
Equity in the Property: $<74,909.24>

As aresult, there is no equity in the Property for the bankruptcy estate. Moreover, since this
is a Chapter 7 proceeding, there is no reorganization in prospect. As a result, Movant is entitled to
relief from the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362(d)(2).

Til.

MOVANT _IS_ ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM THE
AUTOMATIC STAY UNDER 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362(d)(1).

CAUSE - LACK OF ADEQUATE PROTECTION
Pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 361 and 362(d)(1), Movant is entitled to adequate

protection of its interest in the Property.

Movant submits that adequate protection in this case requires normal and periodic cash
payments, as called for by the Note, plus the repayment of any and all delinquent amounts owed to
Movant, including all attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the filing of this motion.

Movant is informed and believes that Debtor is presently unwilling or unable to provide
adequate protection to the Movant and there is no probability that adequate protection can be
afforded to Movant within a reasonable time.

By reason of the foregoing, Movant is entitled to relief from stay under 11 U.S.C.
0x00A7 362(d)(1), based upon the failure of Debtor to provide adequate protection to Movant.

WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully prays for an Order of this court as follows:

1. Terminating the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 362, as it applies to the enforcement by
Movant of all of its rights in the Real Property under the Note and the Deed of Trust;

2. That the 14-day stay described by Bankruptcy Rule 4001(a)(3) be waived;

3. Granting Movant leave to foreclose on the Real Property and to enforce the security
interest under the Note and the Deed of Trust, including any action necessary to obtain possession of
the Property;

4. Permitting Movant to offer and provide Debtor with information re: a potential
Forbearance Agreement, Loan Modification, Refinance Agreement, or other Loan Workout/Loss
Mitigation Agreement, and to enter into such agreement with Debtor;

5. Alternatively, in the event this court declines to grant Movant the relief requested
above, Movant requests that an Order for adequate protection be issued, requiring the Debtor to
reinstate and maintain in a current condition all obligations due under the Note and Deed of Trust
and all other deeds of trust encumbering the Real Property, including Debtor's obligations to pay

when due (a) the monthly installments of principal and interest, as required under the Note;

filing of this motion;

6. That the attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Movant for filing the instant Motion be

included in the outstanding balance of the Note as allowed under applicable non-bankruptcy law;

and

7. For such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
