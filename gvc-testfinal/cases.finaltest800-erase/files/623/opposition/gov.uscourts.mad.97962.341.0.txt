FOR WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIRE
The United States of America, by and through its attorneys,
United States Attorney Michael J. Sullivan, and Assistant United

respectfully requests that if the Court grants defendants’
motion, that the attached questions be included in the
questionnaire submitted to the jury to ensure a jury fair and
