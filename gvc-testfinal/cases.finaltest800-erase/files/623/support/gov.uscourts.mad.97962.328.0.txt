DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR WRITTEN JUROR QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING
RELIGION AND NATIONAL ORIGIN

 

Now come the defendants, Muhamed Mubayyid, Emadeddin Z. Muntasser and Samir Al-
Monla, and move this Honorable Court to submit the brief written questionnaire, attached hereto,
to prospective jurors in this matter. As reason therefor, and as is set out more fully in the
accompanying affidavit, prospective jurors are unlikely to answer candidly when questioned as a
group, or even when questioned individually in person by the Court, about religious or racial
prejudice. A written questionnaire, completed before voir dire, is far more likely to elicit jurors'
opinions on religious or racial matters. Since the defendants are Muslim Arabs, allowance of this
motion is necessary to protect their rights to a fair trial before an impartial jury.

Respectfully submitted,

MUHAMED MUBAYYID

AFFIDAVIT OF COUNSEL

The following is true to the best of my information and
belief:

1. Juror questionnaires designed to identify racial bias are
utilized routinely in this district.

2. Iwas defense counsel in the case of United States v.
Franklyn Liranzo which was tried before Lindsay, J. in June 2002.
In that case the defendant was a dark skinned Hispanic male and
the charges were felon in possession of a firearm. Counsel
requested and was granted a juror questionnaire on racial bias.
Approximately 25% of the jurors answered that they believed that
black or Hispanic men are more likely than members of other races
to commit crimes.

3. I was defense counsel in the case of United States v. Dondi
Willis which was tried in October 2003 before Lasker, J. In that
case the defendant was a black male and the charges were felon in
possession of a firearm. Counsel requested and was granted a
juror questionnaire. Approximately 20% of the jurors answered
that they believed that black or Hispanic men are more likely
than members of other races to commit crimes.

4. Iwas defense counsel in the case of United States v. Jean
Brito which was tried in January 2004 before Lindsay, J. In that
case the defendant was a black male and the charges were felon in
possession of a firearm. Counsel requested and was granted a
jurer questionnaire. Sixteen out of fifty (Approximately 32%) of
the jurors indicated racial bias on their juror questionnaire.
Case 4:05-cr-40026-FDS Document 328-3 Filed 11/02/2007 Page 2of2

5. 2 was defense counsel in the case of United States v. David
Seymour which was tried in October 2005 before Tauro, J. In that
case the defendant was a black male and the charges were felon in
possession of a firearm. Counsel requested and was granted a
juror questionnaire. <A significant percentage of the jurors
{counsel's memory is that the figure was close to 20%) indicated
racial bias on their juror questionnaire.

6. I was defense counsel in the case of United States v. Trevor
Charlton which was tried before Saris, J. in March 2006. In that
case the defendant was a black male and the charges were felon in
possession of a firearm. Counsel requested and was granted a
juror questionnaire on racial bias. While the exact statistics
are not known, numerous individuals were excluded as they
indicated racial bias on the questionnaire.

7. $j.%cent was defense counsel in the case of United States v. Vincent
Wadlington which was tried on March 8, 2004 before Keeton, J. In
that case, the defendant was a black man and the charges were
Hobbs Act robbery of a convenience store in Brockton, I
requested a questionnaire on the issue of racial prejudice which
was denied. Instead, the judge orally asked the questions of the
venire. Of 49 potential jurors ultimately 7 stated they could
not be fair in judging a black man (approximately 14%). The
judge asked the requested questions three separate times during
the voir dire. The first time, only two jurors came forward. A
few more came forward the second time and more the third time.
All seven were excused for cause.

8. My experience in this federal court and in Massachusetts
State Courts is that potential jurors are unlikely to answer
candidly when questioned as a group about racial prejudice. For
example, in the case of United States v. Shelton Lewis, which I
tried in March 2003, the court (Harrington, J.) inquired of the
venire in open court "Does any member of this panel believe that
black men are more likely than other races te commit crimes?"
Not one person responded affirmatively.

9, The defendants in the present case are Muslim Arabs.

10. My experience in the United States Federal District Court
for this circuit is that the typical venire is over 95%

White/Caucasian. |
