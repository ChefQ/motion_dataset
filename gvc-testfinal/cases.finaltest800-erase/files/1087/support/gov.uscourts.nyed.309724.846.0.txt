Ground Four II: Movant had no assistance of counsel for the benefit of her defense
and as such could not disprove any of the government's assertions
against her.
Supporting FACTS: SEE THE ATTACHED MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ****
Counsel's actions knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily contributed to
the prejudice and resulting consequences to the movant.

have successfully argued the one issue he raised in the interest of
the movant at the sentencing hearing.

Counsel could have timely filed a motion containing the attached facts
and partial evidence and presented to the court a completely different
perspective of the facts of the case.

For all of the aforementioned gounds and the attached memorandum in support of this
motion, outlining and detailing the facts of the movant's claims, the movant asserts
ineffective assistane of counsel; but for counsel's unprofessional errors, behaviors
and omissions of duties, which caused the movant to be significantly prejudiced, the
outcome of the proceedings would have been very different.

A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from the
latest of—
(I) the date on which the judgment of conviction became final;
(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of
the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making such a
motion by such governmental action;
(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has
been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral
review; or

through the exercise of due diligence.
