Plaintiffs CLRB Hanson Industries, LLC and Howard Stern ("Plaintiffs"), and Defendant
Google Inc. ("Google") jointly submit this memorandum in opposition to Mr. Riches's Motion to
Intervene as Plaintiff. Mr. Riches is not a class member and has no interest in this case sufficient to
permit intervention.

Mr. Riches attempts to intervene pursuant to Rules 24(a)(2) and 24(b)(1) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. Neither rule allows for his intervention. Rule 24(a)(2) provides that intervention

is necessary where the intervenor:

claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the
action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter
impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing
parties adequately represent that interest.

Here, Mr. Riches has no interest in plaintiffs' claims against Google or the settlement distribution,
because he is not a class member. See Exhibit A (M. Sherwood Declaration 0x00A7 2). To the extent that
Mr. Riches has related claims against Google, he may file them in a separate action. Allowing this
case to go forward, and the settlement to proceed without his intervention will not interfere at all with
Mr. Riches's ability to protect his interests.

Mr. Riches also cites to Rule 24(b) as a basis for permissive intervention. Rule 24(b)(1)
permits intervention to anyone who:

(A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or
(B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of
law or fact.

Mr. Riches cites to no federal statute that grants him a conditional right to intervene - because there is
no such statute. His only basis for alleging that he has "a common vested interest" in this case is that
he possesses "documents, emails, exhibits, and photographs related to this case," he has "expert
information to provide this court," and he is "a convicted computer hacker with knowledge about

Googles [sic] systems and hard drives." Mr. Riches does not allege that he has a claim against Google

that shares with plaintiffs or the class a common question of law or fact. Therefore, permissive
intervention is also unavailable.

Accordingly, Mr. Riches's motion to intervene must be denied.
