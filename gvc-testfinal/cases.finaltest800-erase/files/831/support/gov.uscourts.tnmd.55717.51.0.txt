MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendants Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood, John Kelley Lovelace, Chris DuBois, Frank
Rogers, Sea Gayle Music, LLC, EMI April Music Inc., and Sony Music Entertainment d/b/a
Arista Nashville respectfully submit this Memorandum of Law in support of their motion,
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), for an order dismissing the Amended Complaint of Plaintiff
Amy Elizabeth Connor Bowen (“Connor” or “Plaintiff”) with prejudice.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
This is an action for copyright infringement. In her Amended Complaint,1 Connor
alleges that she is the author and copyright owner of a musical composition entitled “Remind
Me” (hereafter, the “Plaintiff’s Composition”). Connor further alleges that Plaintiff’s
Composition was copied without authorization by another musical composition that is also
entitled “Remind Me” (hereafter, the “Defendants’ Composition”).
1

Plaintiff Connor’s original Complaint in this action was verified. She has elected not to verify
this amended pleading, which contains numerous new allegations, including musicological
assertions that appear to have been drawn from an undisclosed “expert” musicologist’s report.
For the avoidance of doubt, Defendants strongly disagree with these musicological assertions.

Defendants’ Composition was co-authored by Defendants Paisley, Lovelace and DuBois,
and was recorded by Defendants Paisley and Underwood, who are prominent country music
entertainers.2 Both Plaintiff’s Composition and Defendants’ Composition are country music
songs, which Plaintiff alleges are “substantially similar.” Based upon these allegations, Plaintiff
has asserted a single claim against all Defendants for copyright infringement.
In order to prevail on her claim for copyright infringement, Plaintiff bears the burden to
plausibly plead and then prove, inter alia, that the songs at issue are “substantially similar.”
Under Sixth Circuit precedent, to determine whether substantial similarity between two works
exists, the Court must apply what is known as the “modified ordinary observer” test. Pursuant to
this test, the Court must: (1) filter out the unprotectible elements that are shared by the two
works; and then (2) determine whether “‘the ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the
disparities [between the two works at issue], would be disposed to overlook [those disparities],
and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.’” Pollick v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 817 F. Supp.
2d 1005, 1011 (E.D. Mich. 2011) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).
In her original Complaint, Plaintiff failed to identify any similarities whatsoever between
the two works at issue. Accordingly, Defendants moved to dismiss that Complaint on the ground
that it was wholly insufficient to state a claim for copyright infringement under the pleading
standards enunciated in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) and Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). In response to that motion, Plaintiff has amended her complaint
to allege that portions of the choruses of these two songs “sound essentially the same to the lay

2

The other defendants are Rogers, the producer of the Paisley/Underwood recording of
Defendants’ Composition, and the music publishers and record label which are alleged by the
Amended Complaint to have exploited Defendants’ Composition in various ways.

listener.”3 The Amended Complaint further cites alleged musical “similarities” between those
choruses that are highly technical and indiscernible to any actual lay listener. None of these new
allegations saves Plaintiff’s claim, which must be dismissed.
In copyright infringement cases – including cases involving musical works – courts
routinely grant Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss when no reasonable, ordinary observer could
find the works at issue to be substantially similar. E.g., Pollick, 817 F. Supp. 2d at 1011
(“‘When a court is called upon to consider whether the works are substantially similar . . .’ ‘no
discovery or fact-finding is typically necessary . . . .’”) (citation omitted); Gottwald v. Jones, No.
11 Civ. 1432, 2011 WL 4344038, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2011), reconsid. denied, 2011 WL
5289471 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 3, 2011); Pyatt v. Raymond, No. 10 Civ. 2507, 2011 WL 2078531, at
*8 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2011), aff’d, 462 Fed. Appx. 22 (2d Cir. 2012). See also additional case
law citations infra, at fn. 12. That same result should apply here. Once the unprotectible
elements of these two songs are excluded, no reasonable, ordinary observer would consider any
portion of these two works to be similar. Plaintiff’s conclusory allegation that portions of the
works “sound essentially the same to the lay listener” is entirely implausible, and therefore fails
under Iqbal and Twombly. Moreover, Plaintiff’s allegations regarding purported musicological
similarities are simply irrelevant under the “ordinary observer” test because those alleged
similarities cannot be discerned by the lay public who is the intended audience for country
music. See Kohus v. Mariol, 328 F.3d 848, 856 (6th Cir. 2003).
The Sixth Circuit has recognized that “[c]opyright infringement, like anti-trust actions,
3

The only lyrical similarity alleged by Plaintiff is the use in both songs of the commonplace
phrase “remind me” and the slightly modified and colloquial “baby, remind me.” As explained
infra, neither of these short and unremarkable phrases is entitled to copyright protection, alone or
in combination.

lends itself readily to abusive litigation, since the high cost of trying such a case can force a
defendant who might otherwise be successful in trial to settle in order to avoid the time and
expenditure of a resource intensive case. Therefore, greater particularity in pleading, through
showing ‘plausible grounds,’ is required.” Nat’l Bus. Dev. Servs. v. Am. Credit Educ. &
Consulting, Inc., 299 Fed. Appx. 509, 511 (6th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added). Defendants
respectfully submit that this Amended Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety with
prejudice, before they incur further burden and expense, because Plaintiff’s claim is not merely
implausible, but in fact cannot succeed as a matter of law under any circumstance.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff commenced this action on May 1, 2013. (DE #1.) The original Complaint
contained three claims: a claim for copyright infringement, a claim for a declaration as to
Plaintiff’s ownership of “Remind Me,” and a claim for an accounting of profits earned by
Defendants from Defendants’ Composition. (Id.) On July 2, 2013, Defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the entire Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (DE #31.) In
response to that meritorious motion, Plaintiff filed her Amended Complaint on July 19, 2013
(DE #39), dropping her declaratory judgment and accounting claims and proceeding only with a
single claim for copyright infringement (with new, supplemental allegations).
THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT
Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint that she is the author and sole copyright
owner of Plaintiff’s Composition, which she claims to have completed writing by March 2008.
(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 14, 73.) Plaintiff further alleges that she registered this work with the Copyright
Office in October 2008, and obtained Copyright Registration No. PAu 3-375-692 for it. (Id. ¶¶
16, 17, and Ex. B.) Plaintiff deposited a sound recording of her performance of Plaintiff’s

Composition (hereafter, the “Registered Recording”) with the Copyright Office as the work
being registered. (Id. ¶ 16.)4
The Amended Complaint also contains allegations regarding a subsequent recording of
Plaintiff’s Composition, that was made pursuant to an alleged contractual relationship between
Plaintiff and one Rod Creagh. (Id. ¶¶ 18, 33.) As discussed below, this subsequent recording
(hereafter, the “Unregistered Recording”) is irrelevant to this Court’s consideration of this
Motion because there is no allegation that it was ever registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. 5
The Amended Complaint further alleges that Defendants’ Composition was recorded by
Defendants Paisley and Underwood in February 2011 and was “released by Defendants on or
about May 23, 2011.” (Id. ¶¶ 23, 24.)6 It also alleges that all of the Defendants have exploited
Defendants’ Composition. (See, e.g., id. ¶ 74.) The Amended Complaint sets forth numerous
alleged facts which Plaintiff contends establish that the writers of Defendants’ Composition had

4

A copy of the lyrics to Plaintiff’s Composition which Plaintiff deposited with the U.S.
Copyright Office is attached as Exhibit A to the August 5, 2013 Declaration of Jane G. Stevens
(the “Stevens Decl.”) and was attached to the original Complaint as Exhibit A. (DE #1.) The
Registered Recording is “Track 1” on the DVD which Plaintiff has annexed to her Amended
Complaint.

5

The Unregistered Recording is “Track 2” on the DVD which Plaintiff has annexed to her
Amended Complaint.

6

A copy of the lyrics to Defendants’ Composition is attached as Exhibit B to the Stevens Decl.
A sound recording of Defendants’ Composition (“Defendants’ Recording”) is attached to the
Amended Complaint as “Track 3” on the DVD which Plaintiff has annexed to her Amended
Complaint. In addition to containing Defendants’ Recording, Track 3 also contains a short
“fragment” from a different song by Defendant Paisley entitled “This Is Country Music.” (This
unrelated “fragment” begins at approximately 4:16 into Track 3.) Plaintiff does not contend that
this “fragment” has any musical or lyrical similarities to Plaintiff’s Composition (as there clearly
are none).

access to her song prior to the creation of their own. (Id. ¶¶ 28-39.)7
Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants’ Composition “copied and prominently used a
qualitatively important element from” Plaintiff’s Composition. (Id. ¶ 21.) However, the only
lyrical similarity which Plaintiff alleges in her Amended Complaint is the use in both songs of
the commonplace and unprotecible words “remind me” and “baby, remind me.” (See, e.g., id.
¶¶ 42, 43.) The only musical similarities which Plaintiff alleges to exist are contained within the
choruses of both songs – and specifically within the music that accompanies the unprotectible
words “remind me” and “baby, remind me” within each song. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 40-50.) The
Amended Complaint collectively refers to the words “remind me” and the various musical
passages which accompany those words in each song as the “hook.” (Id. ¶ 42.) The Amended
Complaint further collectively refers to the words “baby, remind me” and the various musical
passages which accompany those words in each song as the “partner phase.” (Id. ¶ 43.)
Although the Amended Complaint concedes that the music which accompanies the words
“remind me” and “baby, remind me” is quite different within each work and between the two
works,8 Plaintiff nonetheless implausibly alleges that the “hooks and partner phrases . . . [in
Defendants’ Composition] sound essentially the same to the lay listener as the hooks and partner
phrases” in Plaintiff’s Composition. (Id. ¶ 45.) In an attempt to bolster this contention, the
7

Defendants do not challenge Plaintiff’s access allegations solely for purposes of this Rule
12(b)(6) motion. If, arguendo, this action were to proceed on the merits (which it should not),
Defendants will vigorously dispute those allegations and establish that their composition was
independently created without reference to Plaintiff’s Composition.

8

Inter alia, Plaintiff admits that “the melodies that accompany the hooks and partner phrases are
constantly varied,” and that “it is rare for a rendition of ‘remind me’ or ‘baby, remind me’ to
have precisely the same melody as another rendition of that lyrical phrase.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 46.)
(See also id. ¶ 47) (conceding “there are eight different melodies” in “the hooks and partner
phrases” in Plaintiff’s Composition and “sixteen different melodies” in “the hooks and partner
phrases” in Defendants’ Composition).

Case 3:13-cv-00414 Document 51 Filed 08/05/13 Page 6 of 20 PageID #: 341

Amended Complaint asserts additional alleged musicological similarities between the choruses
of Plaintiff’s Composition and Defendants’ Composition. These alleged similarities – which
Defendants submit are not discernible to the lay listener – include that “the second iteration [of
the hook in each song] always reaches a full tone higher than the first iteration,” that the works
allegedly share a “decent [sic] in pitch . . . by either a minor 3rd interval or a perfect 4th
interval,” and that “the melody that accompanies the lyric ‘remind’ is carried across a bar . . . .”9
(Id. ¶¶ 44, 45.) Significantly, the Amended Complaint’s allegations regarding musicological
similarities are not limited to a comparison of Defendants’ Recording and Plaintiff’s Registered
Recording, but instead also concern the Unregistered Recording. (Id. ¶¶ 40-49).10 As discussed
infra, the Unregistered Recording is not properly the subject of Plaintiff’s copyright infringement
claim, and should not be considered by the Court.
ARGUMENT
A.

Standard of Review
1.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) Standard

Generally, under Rule 12(b)(6), a district court must accept the material facts alleged in
the Complaint as true. Morgan v. Church’s Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 11-12 (6th Cir. 1987).
9

Plaintiff also alleges the use in both works of a “double melisma.” (Am. Compl., ¶ 45(c)). A
“melisma” is “the singing of a single syllable of text while moving between several different
notes in succession.” It is a “common” musical technique “used by artists such as Whitney
Houston, Mariah Carey, Beyoncé Knowles, Christina Aguilera, and Jennifer Hudson, among
others.” See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisma.
10

The Amended Complaint does not make clear whether the alleged musicological similarities
set forth in the Amended Complaint concern the Registered Recording, the Unregistered
Recording, or both. (See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 47, 48.) However, as set forth in more detail
below, these alleged musicological similarities are irrelevant in all events because they are not
discernible to “the lay audience [which] purchases [the allegedly infringing] product at issue . . .
[whose] untutored judgment determines whether the product will sell.” Kohus v. Mariol, 328
F.3d 848, 856 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d 464, 473 (2d Cir. 1946)).

However, the Court need not accept the Complaint’s unsupported legal conclusions. Ezell v.
Metro. Gov. of Nashville and Davidson County¸ 2012 WL 2601940 at *3 (M.D. Tenn. June 6,
2012) (citations omitted) (Trauger, J.). As the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, “a plaintiff’s
obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Thus, a litigant does not satisfy its pleading burden through “‘naked
assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly,
550 U.S. at 557); Claybrooks v. Am. Broad. Cos., 898 F. Supp. 2d 986, 991 (M.D. Tenn. 2012)
(Trauger, J.). Dismissal of the Amended Complaint here should be with prejudice where any
amendment would be futile (as it would be here given the lack of substantial similarity between
the works at issue). United States v. Healthspring, Inc., No. 3:10-1015, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2013
WL 1399344 at *11 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 5, 2013) (Sharp, J.); Daniels v. Morgan Asset Mgmt., Inc.,
743 F. Supp. 2d 730, 743 (W.D. Tenn. 2010).
In adjudicating this Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court can and should consider the works at
issue, and should only accept the allegations in the Amended Complaint as true “to the extent
[the allegations] are consistent with the works themselves.” Allen v. Scholastic Inc., 739 F.
Supp. 2d 642, 645 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev.
Corp., 602 F.3d 57, 64 (2d Cir. 2010)). Indeed, “[i]n copyright infringement actions, ‘the works
themselves supersede and control contrary descriptions of them,’ including ‘any contrary
allegations, conclusions or descriptions of the works contained in the pleadings.’” Gaito, 602
F.3d at 64 (citations omitted). Also, in support of this Motion, the Defendants have
contemporaneously filed a Request for Judicial Notice asking the Court to take notice of the
lyrics of the compositions at issue in this dispute, and a printout from the website of the U.S.

Copyright Office (which is a public record). The Court should grant that request for the reasons
stated therein. Additionally,“[i]n the context of copyright claims, the Court may take judicial
notice of [the] generic [nature of certain] elements . . . [which are commonly contained in]
creative works.” Zella v. E.W. Scripps Co., 529 F. Supp.2d 1124, 1129 (C.D. Cal. 2007).
2.

Standard of Review for a Copyright Infringement Claim

To prevail on a claim for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must establish (1) ownership
of a valid copyright, and (2) unauthorized copying of protectible material. Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v.
Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991). When a plaintiff has no direct evidence of
copying, “the plaintiff is permitted to establish ‘an inference’ of copying, by showing (1) that the
defendant had ‘access’ to the allegedly infringed work and (2) that there is a ‘substantial
similarity between the . . . works at issue.’” Brainard v. Vassar, 625 F. Supp. 2d 608, 616 (M.D.
Tenn. 2009) (quoting Jones v. Blige, 558 F.3d 485, 490 (6th Cir. 2009)). Access – which
Defendants deny, but is not disputed solely for purposes of this Motion – “occurs when the
defendant either hears or has a ‘reasonable opportunity’ to hear the plaintiff’s work.” Id.
The Sixth Circuit applies a two-step approach to determining substantial similarity. The
“first step” of this test “‘requires identifying which aspects of the artist’s work, if any, are
protectible by copyright,’ [and] the second [step] ‘involves determining whether the allegedly
infringing work is ‘substantially similar’ to protectible elements of the artist’s work.’”
Stromback v. New Line Cinema, 384 F.3d 283, 294 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Kohus v. Mariol,
328 F.3d 848, 855 (6th Cir. 2003)). The first step is a necessary element of the substantial
similarity analysis because copyright protection extends only to the original components of a
work: those elements that were created independently by the author and that possess some
minimal degree of creativity. Id. Thus, courts must filter out scenes a faire, which are those
9
5456610.7/45187-00001

Case 3:13-cv-00414 Document 51 Filed 08/05/13 Page 9 of 20 PageID #: 344

elements that follow naturally from the work’s theme rather than from the author’s creativity. Id.
Additionally, “[c]ourts have consistently held that common words and clichéd language are not
subject to copyright protection.” Pendleton v. Acuff-Rose Publications, Inc., 605 F. Supp. 477,
486 (M.D. Tenn. 1984) (also finding no infringement where the manner expressing similar
themes was dissimilar). Short phrases, slogans and titles are also not subject to copyright
protection. Id.; Chapman v. Universal Motown Records Grp., No. 08 Civ. 3255 (LAP), 2010
WL 517480, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2010); 37 C.F.R. § 202.1(a).
In performing the first step of the substantial similarity analysis, the Court should also be
mindful that “copyright protection extends only to expression of ideas and not to ideas
themselves.” Stromback, 384 F.3d at 296. Accord, 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (“In no case does
copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea . . . [or] concept . . .
regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated or embodied . . . .”).
Once the unprotectible elements have been filtered out, the second step is to determine
whether “‘the ordinary observer, unless he set out to detect the disparities [between the two
works at issue], would be disposed to overlook [those disparities], and regard their aesthetic
appeal as the same.’” Pollick, 817 F. Supp. 2d at 1011 (quoting Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v.
Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2d Cir. 1960)). Because the test is one of the
“ordinary observer, “[w]hen a court is called upon to consider whether the works are
substantially similar . . .’ ‘no discovery or factfinding is typically necessary . . . .’” Pollick, 817
F. Supp. 2d at 1011 (quoting Gaito, 602 F.3d at 64). Indeed, “where, as here, the subject matter
is not complex or technical, such as a computer program or a functional object, . . . but instead
involves a literary work aimed at a general audience, expert testimony will seldom be
necessary to determine substantial similarity.” Stromback, 384 F.3d at 295 (emphasis added)

This Court Should Not Consider
Plaintiff’s Unregistered Sound Recording

Defendants respectfully submit that, in adjudicating this Motion, the Court should
disregard the Unregistered Recording (and all of Plaintiffs’ musicological assertions regarding
that recording). This is because Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 411(a))
“requires that the copyright be registered before it can be asserted as a basis for infringement in
federal court.” Murray Hill Publ’ns v. ABC Communs, 264 F.3d 622, 630 (6th Cir. 2001)
(holding that “plaintiffs cannot bring an action for infringement of their copyright on the Song
because it was not registered with the United States Copyright Office”).11
B.

The Complaint Fails To State A Claim For Copyright Infringement
1.

No “Substantial Similarity” Exists Between The Two Songs At Issue

The law is clear that, if no reasonable juror could find the works at issue to be
substantially similar, the Court should dismiss the action at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.12 As set
forth below, Plaintiff’s claim for copyright infringement should be dismissed with prejudice

11

However, to the extent that the Court does consider the Unregistered Recording in
adjudicating this Motion, dismissal with prejudice is still warranted because it also shares no
protectible lyrical and/or musical similarities with Defendants’ Composition.

because, after extracting the unprotectible elements from Plaintiff’s Composition and
Defendants’ Composition, no reasonable ordinary observer could conclude that the balance of
either the lyrics or music in the works at issue are substantially similar.
a.

The Lyrics Are Not Substantially Similar

The only similarities between the lyrics of Plaintiff’s Composition and Defendants’
Composition are unprotectible elements which must be disregarded in conducting the Sixth
Circuit’s “modified ordinary observer” substantial similarity analysis. For the convenience of
the Court, the lyrics of both works are set forth below in a side-by-side comparison.
Plaintiff’s Composition

Defendants’ Composition

(Verse 1)

(Verse 1)

I found a picture in a shoebox under my bed
It’s a little worn around the edges
All these years I’ve kept it

We didn’t care if people stared
We’d make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody’d tell us to get a room
It’s hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we’re okay
But I don’t want to settle for good, not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again

It’s you and me on the back porch
Drinking cheap wine
Stomach full of butterflies
Both of us with big smiles
That’s when I knew I loved you for the first time
CHORUS
All it takes is one kiss to remind me
All I need is your touch to remind me
Yesterday’s gone/ v2- I don’t think we’re too far
gone /v3-I’m still holding on
Take me to the place we started from
When love was young
Baby, Remind me

(Chorus)
Been so long, bet you forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire, so in love
Way back when we couldn’t get enough
Remind me, remind me

(Verse 2)
“You’ve always been my happy ending”
That’s what the card says
On the roses you sent

(Verse 2)
Remember the airport, dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn’t
stop
And I felt bad ‘cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night

So it’s just me on the front porch
Drinking champagne

(Chorus)
Do you remember how it used to be?

Maybe next year we’ll celebrate
We’d turn out the lights and we didn’t just
When you don’t have to work late
sleep
What I’d give for cheap wine and you by my side Remind me, baby, remind me
Oh, so on fire, so in love

That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me, baby, remind me

Nobody said love would be easy

And there’s only one way back to what we used I wanna feel that way
to be
Yeah, I wanna hold you close
Oh, if you still love me

Don’t just assume I know
Oh baby, remind me
Remind me
Yeah
(Chorus)
Do you remember the way it felt?
You mean back when we couldn’t control
ourselves?
Remind me, yeah, remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh baby, remind me
Yeah, you’d wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me, oh baby, remind me, yeah
(Outro)
Oh baby, remind me
Baby, remind me, yeah, oh
Yeah, you’d wake up in my old t-shirt
Yeah, oh
Baby, remind me
The only lyrical similarities alleged in the Amended Complaint are the words “remind
me” and “baby, remind me”. None of these lyrics are copyrightable, alone or in combination.
Indeed, a search of the U.S. Copyright Office database using the search term “Remind Me”
reveals two hundred and seventy-nine (279) separate registrations of copyrighted works

entitled “Remind Me” or some variation thereof. See Exhibit C to Stevens Decl. As
discussed above, “common words and clichéd language are not subject to copyright protection,”
whether alone or in combination. Pendleton, 605 F. Supp. at 485 (shared use of the “terms
‘drink,’ ‘smoke,’ and ‘dirty joke’” in two country music songs did not give rise to viable claim
for copyright infringement). Accord, Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. v. Jostens, Inc., 155 F.3d 140, 144
(2d Cir. 1998) (“You’ve got to stand for somethin’/or you’re gonna fall for anything” is not
protectible); Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, 24 (1st Cir. 2005) (“You’re the One for Me” is
“too trite to warrant copyright protection”); Gottwald, 2011 WL 4344038, at *5 (lyrical phrase
“drop top” not protectible); Pyatt, 2011 WL 2078531, at *8 (“caught up” lyrics not protectible);
Chapman v. Universal Motown Records Group, No. 08 Civ. 3255 (LAP), 2010 WL 517480, at
*4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2010) (“lean back” lyrics not subject to copyright).13 The lyrics “remind
me” and “baby, remind me” are unquestionably common and clichéd, and Plaintiff is not entitled
to monopolize their use.
Crucially, the lyrics of the two songs use the unprotectible phrases “remind me” and
“baby, remind me” in very different contexts. In Plaintiff’s Composition, the narrator, who is
alone on a porch drinking champagne while her partner is working late on their anniversary,
examines an old photograph in which they were together drinking cheap wine together on that
same porch. Her mood is pensive and sad, and she lacks confidence that the future will bring
renewed romance and closeness. In contrast, in Defendants’ Composition, a man and woman
who are still engaged in a good relationship – but want to reignite the passionate physicality of
13

The fact that the works at issue have the same title (i.e., “Remind Me”) is similarly irrelevant
because the titles of songs are not copyrightable. 37 C.F.R. § 202.1(a) (“Words and short
phrases such as names, titles and slogans” are not subject to copyright). Accord, Chapman, 2010
WL 517480, at *4.

their earlier days – engage in a sexually charged dialogue recalling the specific details of past
intimate encounters. The concrete, anecdotal details of amorous activity in Defendants’
Composition imbue it with a risqué tension that is entirely lacking from the Plaintiff’s more
chaste and sedate composition. Further, all of the lyrics of Plaintiff’s Composition are written
from one person’s perspective – an individual who is waiting at home for a romantic partner who
is working late. In sharp contrast, the lyrics of Defendants’ Composition naturally make the
song a duet because they constitute a conversation between two people in which they discuss
how passionate their relationship used to be, and how they are both focused on re-capturing that
physicality.14
In sum, “because the theme or idea of the two songs is not copyrightable . . . and because
the manner of expression utilized in each song is clearly dissimilar . . . this action must be
dismissed.” Pendleton, 605 F. Supp. at 486.
b.

The Music Is Not Substantially Similar

Under the “modified ordinary observer” test, this Court should listen to the music of the
two songs at issue. Pollick, 817 F. Supp. 2d at 1011 (“When a court is called upon to consider
whether the works are substantially similar . . .’ ‘no discovery or fact-finding is typically
necessary . . . .’”) (quoting Gaito, 602 F.3d at 64). Defendants respectfully submit that the Court
will recognize that they sound very different, and that they have no musical similarities between
them which could support a claim of substantial similarity.
The recent music copyright cases of Gottwald v. Jones and Pyatt v. Raymond are

14

Given that the character of the romantic partner is away at work during the duration of
Plaintiff’s Composition, the Amended Complaint’s characterization of that song as an intended
“duet” (id. ¶¶ 24, 31), is entirely implausible.

15

Case 3:13-cv-00414 Document 51 Filed 08/05/13 Page 15 of 20 PageID #: 350

instructive. In these cases, the court applied the “ordinary observer test” in granting Rule
12(b)(6) motions. In both cases, the court found that there was no substantial similarity between
the music of the pop songs at issue and dismissed claims for copyright infringement. Gottwald,
2011 WL 4344038, at *5; Pyatt, 2011 WL 2078531, at *8.
Similarly, the Eighth Circuit recently affirmed a lower court’s dismissal of a complaint
alleging infringement of a song entitled, “What’s Cooking In This Book,” by Prince’s song, “U
Got the LOOK.” The Eighth Circuit noted that the district court had complete copies of each
song and “was therefore in proper position to apply the substantial similarity test.” Nelson, 873
F.2d at 1143. The Court of Appeals emphasized that analyzing the similarity of expression does
not require an expert opinion, but rather is based on the test of the ordinary, reasonable person –
a determination that the district court was capable of making. Id. at 1143-1144.
Finally, in another recent case, a songwriter alleged that Kanye West and others
committed copyright infringement when they released a song “virtually identical in sound and
melody” to a song previously recorded and copyrighted by plaintiff. Staggs v. West, No. PJM
08-728, 2009 WL 2579665, at *1 (D. Md. 2009). On defendants’ motion to dismiss, the district
court listened to the music and compared the lyrics of the two songs at issue to see if substantial
similarity could be found by an “ordinary listener – the Court in this case.” Id. at *3. The court
then granted the motion because there was no “substantial similarity” between the plaintiff’s and
defendants’ songs. Id.
Defendants respectfully submit the same analysis can and should be applied here. The
Court should listen to Plaintiff’s Composition and Defendants’ Composition, and conclude their
music is not substantially similar. Once the generic elements of these compositions attributable
to the fact that they are both contemporary country music songs are filtered out, no ordinary
16
5456610.7/45187-00001

Case 3:13-cv-00414 Document 51 Filed 08/05/13 Page 16 of 20 PageID #: 351

listener could “regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.” Pollick, 817 F. Supp. 2d at 1011
(citation omitted).
Notably, the Amended Complaint does not allege any musical similarities other than the
music which accompanies the words “remind me” and “baby, remind me” in the two works.
Defendants respectfully submit, that in listening to the works, the Court will conclude that the
music which accompanies these words sounds very different. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s allegation
that this music “sound[s] essentially the same to the lay listener” is simply implausible and
should be disregarded by the Court pursuant to Iqbal and Twombly. Accord, Gaito, 602 F.3d at
64 (“In copyright infringement actions, ‘the works themselves supersede and control contrary
descriptions of them,’ including ‘any contrary allegations, conclusions or descriptions of the
works contained in the pleadings.”) (citations omitted). Pointedly, even Plaintiff concedes that
“the melodies that accompany” the words “remind me” and “baby, remind me” in each of the
two works “are constantly varied” – i.e., different from each other. (Am. Compl. ¶ 46.)
Moreover, in adjudicating this motion to dismiss, the Court should disregard the alleged
musicological similarities between the works cited in the Amended Complaint – such as their
alleged shared use of “a minor 3rd interval or a perfect 4th interval” – because those similarities
(even assuming arguendo they exist) are imperceptible to an ordinary observer. Any similarities
between the works at issue which are not discernible to the popular audience at which country
music is directed – and may (at most) be discernible to a trained musicologist – have no
economic value and therefore are not protected by the Copyright Act. As the Second Circuit
explained in the seminal Arnstein v. Porter case (which concerned the alleged infringement of a
pop music composition):

17
5456610.7/45187-00001

Case 3:13-cv-00414 Document 51 Filed 08/05/13 Page 17 of 20 PageID #: 352

The plaintiff’s legally protected interest is not . . . his reputation as a
musician but his interest in the potential financial returns from his
compositions which derive from the lay public’s approbation of his
efforts. The question, therefore, is whether defendant took from plaintiff’s
works so much of what is pleasing to the ears of lay listeners, who
comprise the audience for whom such popular music is composed, that
defendant wrongfully appropriated something which belongs to the
plaintiff . . . The impression made on the refined ears of musical
experts or their views as to the musical excellence of plaintiff’s or
defendant’s works are utterly immaterial on the issue of
misappropriation . . . .
154 F.2d 464, 473 (2d Cir. 1946) (emphasis added). This Arnstein standard has been cited with
approval by the Sixth Circuit for use in copyright-infringement cases such as the action at bar, in
which “the lay audience purchases [the allegedly infringing] product at issue, and where the lay
audience’s untutored judgment determines whether the product will sell.” Kohus, 328 F.3d at
856 (citing Arnstein, 154 F.2d at 473).15
Here, there is no question that both Plaintiff’s Composition and Defendants’ Composition
are directed at a “lay audience.” Because no reasonable lay listener would find the music in
these songs to sound remotely alike, Plaintiff’s copyright infringement claim must fail.

15

Indeed, the Sixth Circuit has expressly concurred that, “where . . . the subject matter is not
complex or technical, such as a computer program or a functional object, . . . but instead
involves a literary work aimed at a general audience, expert testimony will seldom be
necessary to determine substantial similarity.” Stromback, 384 F.3d at 295 (emphasis added)
(italics in original). Plaintiff’s attempt to aver “expert” testimony in her Amended Complaint is
entitled to no weight.
