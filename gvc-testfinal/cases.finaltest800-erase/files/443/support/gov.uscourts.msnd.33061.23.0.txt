MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC.’S MOTION
FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO RESPOND TO PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT

Defendant Motorola Solutions, Inc. respectfully requests an extension of time, through and
including Wednesday, May 23, 2012, to respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
1.

Plaintiffs’ lengthy 432-paragraph, 142-paged Complaint was filed on April 2, 2012,

and served that same day on Motorola Solutions, Inc.’s registered agent for service of process.
Accordingly, Motorola Solutions, Inc.’s response is currently due on or by April 23, 2012. See
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(1)(A)(i).
2.

Motorola Solutions, Inc. was not given advance notice of the lawsuit or the

opportunity to waive service of process pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d).
3.

Despite the fact that more than the customary thirty (30) day extension to the twenty-

one (21) day responsive pleading deadline is warranted here given the size of the Complaint,
Motorola Solutions, Inc. requested just thirty (30) extra days from Plaintiffs’ counsel in which to
respond to the Complaint. Plaintiffs’ counsel would agree to a twenty-three (23) day extension, but

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 23 Filed: 04/18/12 2 of 4 PageID #: 282

not thirty (30) days.
4.

Preparing a thorough response to Plaintiffs’ massive antitrust Complaint requires

adequate time to determine the legal basis of any potential dismissal motion and to investigate the
allegations contained in the Complaint to which an answer is required.
5.

Motorola Solutions, Inc. states unto the Court that granting this Motion would create

no undue hardship, burden or prejudice to the Plaintiffs, and that this Motion for Extension of Time
to Respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is not filed for purposes of delay or harassment.
6.

For the foregoing reasons, for the reasons expressed in similar extension motions

filed by Qualcomm Incorporated, AT&T, Inc. and AT&T Mobility, LLC, and for good cause shown,
Motorola Solutions, Inc. moves this Court for an extension of time of thirty (30) days to respond to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint, allowing it until and including May 23, 2012, in which to file its response.
See Mots. [14-1, 19-1].
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant Motorola Solutions, Inc. requests
an extension through and including May 23, 2012, to respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
Respectfully submitted, this the 18th day of April, 2012.
MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC.
