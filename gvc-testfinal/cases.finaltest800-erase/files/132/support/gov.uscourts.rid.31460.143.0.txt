ASSIGNMENT
Randy Olen, Esq., requested Professional Litigation & Polyg
raph Services, LLC, d/b/a P
L P Consulting, conduct a polygraph examination to verify
Mr. Joseph Caramadre lied to
the court when he stipulated to his involvement in the
criminal elements listed in the
Statement of Facts in the Plea Agreement.

EXAMINATION
The court records for Docket Number CR11 186-01 S, from
the District of Rhod e Island,
United States District Court, were printed and reviewed
in advance. The defendant,
Joseph Caramadre entered into a plea agreement on
Nove mber 19, 2012. The plea
agreement references counts 9 and 33 of the indict
ment. It also referenced a
Statement of Facts that was stipulated to by Mr. Caramadre.
On April 15, 2013, at approximately 10:00 a.m., Mr. Josep
h Caramadre underwent a
polygraph examination at our test site in Hampstead,
New Hampshire, as arranged.
The examination was audio and video recorded with
Mr. Caramadre's consent. A
secondary audio and video recording was made as the
charts were obtained during the
physiological monitoring.
I explained the purpose and briefly explained the
procedures used during the
examination. I presented the Polygraph Consent Form
, which Mr. Cara madr e read,
acknowledged understanding and signed in my presence.
His health was reviewed and
nothing new was disclosed that prevented him from being
examined. He had taken his
prescribed medications as directed in the morning in advan
ce of the examination. Mr.
Caramadre has undergone a polygraph examination with
me in the past and he was
aware of the process.
Mr. Caramadre reviewed the Statement of Facts line by
line and he provided a two page
analysis he prepared regarding the information it conta
ined. Some of the statements
contained in the State ment of Facts were truthful and
some were not. Some of the
statements were specifically addressed in previous exam
inations and answered. Some
of the activities in the Statement of Fact may have been
true for the co-defendant. Mr.
Caramadre stated he lied to the court when he accepted
or stipulated to the criminal
elements regarding his conduct listed in the Statement of
Facts.
Questions were drafted, finalized and reviewed with Mr.
Caramadre. A single issue
examination using the Zone format, with two relevant quest
ions, was developed. The
physiological monitoring portion of the examination was
conducted using the Lafayette
