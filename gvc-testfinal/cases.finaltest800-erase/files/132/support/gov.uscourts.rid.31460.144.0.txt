Criminal No. 1:11-cr-00186-S

DEFENDANT JOSEPH CARAMADRE’S
SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF HIS
MOTION TO WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA
Mr. Caramadre’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea is predicated on a perfect
storm of circumstances, which, individually and certainly in the aggregate, constitute
“fair and just” reason for withdrawal of the plea. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (d)(2)(B). These
reasons include (1) that Mr. Caramadre was not competent to plead at the time of his plea
colloquy; (2) that the plea was induced on the basis of the ineffective assistance of former
counsel, who failed, among other failures, to adequately investigate the case, develop and
implement a theory of defense, or conduct any meaningful cross-examination consistent
with the theory of defense; (3) that the plea was improperly induced as a result of
ambiguous and misleading representation to a mentally impaired client with a backdrop
of conflict of interest; (4) that Mr. Caramadre presents strong evidence of actual
innocence; (5) that the timing of Mr. Caramadre’s intention to seek to withdraw the plea
demonstrates that it was entered in haste and confusion; and (6) that the Rule 11 colloquy
was constitutionally infirm, in that the plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily.

Mr. Caramadre’s Competence To Plead
In its response to Mr. Caramadre’s memorandum in support of his motion to
withdraw his guilty plea (hereinafter “Def. Memo”), the Government maintains that the
evidence submitted did not demonstrate the he was mentally incompetent to plead guilty,
as it did not “indicate that Caramadre suffered from any type of psychosis at the time of
the Rule 11 hearing, which would render him incapable of making a knowing and
voluntary decision to plead guilty.” Government’s Opposition to Defendant Caramadre’s
Motion to Withdraw His Guilty Plea (hereinafter Gov. Opp. at 14). The Government’s
contention misses the point. One need not be formally diagnosed as suffering from
“psychosis” in order to be mentally impaired to the point that it would affect his ability to
knowingly and voluntarily enter a plea. Moreover, Mr. Caramadre’s mental impairment
constitutes only one factor in a maelstrom of factors which have combined to render the
plea defective.
Furthermore, in its assessment of the medical affidavits provided with Mr.
Caramadre’s motion, the Government conveniently ignores the conclusion of Dr. James
Greer, which states that:
Given that those providing mental health services to him at
this time indicate his decision was shocking and out of
character, the well-documented and longstanding nature of
his depression and the acute situational stress associated
with his reports of increasing disorganization and
impairment of autonomous ego functions, such as
concentration and memory, it is reasonable to conclude
based on this information that he was not capable of
making an informed and considered decision of such
magnitude.
See Def. Memo at Exhibit F, pg. 4.

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 3 of 28 PageID #: 2243

In addition, an updated affidavit of Dr. Caron Zlotnick, Ph.D, filed with this
memorandum, adds to her earlier affidavit her own conclusion that “since Mr. Caramadre
suffers from major depression which can be severe at times, it is possible that his
negative affective state during the trial period compromised his ability to make a well
thought out decision regarding whether to enter a guilty plea.” See Exhibit A, Updated
Affidavit of Dr. Caron Zlotnick, Ph.D.
The Government further argues that Mrs. Caramadre’s breakdown does not
provide a justification for the withdrawal of the plea. As discussed, Mr. Caramadre’s
motion does not seek to rely on this factor alone as a legal basis for withdrawal of the
plea. Clearly, his wife’s breakdown added to Mr. Caramadre’s own mental impairment,
and was therefore a significant factor in the analysis of the voluntariness of his plea.
Mr. Caramadre’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was in part based on his
realization that his attorneys had provided deficient representation. Specifically, his
attorneys failed to investigate and interview even a single government witness, and
engaged in almost no meaningful cross-examination of the witnesses presented at trial;
and that these errors were exacerbated by the decision to defer an opening statement. This
deficient performance completely devastated Mr. Caramadre and contributed greatly to
his defective plea.
It is inconceivable that in a case in which the Government expected to present 100
witnesses, that Mr. Caramadre’s lawyers did not interview a single witness. Mr.
Caramadre had made a specific request of his attorneys to hire an investigator to
investigate the case and interview witnesses. On information and belief, no action was
taken in regard to Mr. Caramadre’s request, no investigation was undertaken, and no

3

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 4 of 28 PageID #: 2244

witnesses were interviewed. See Exhibit B, Email to Attorney Lepizzera from Joseph
Caramadre. Indeed, in conjunction with this motion, one witness who testified before the
Grand Jury and was expected to be a Government witness at trial, was investigated and
has provided an affidavit in which she swears that she was subjected to strong-arm tactics
on the part of the Government, including an attempt “to put words in my mouth”; that she
does “not feel like [she] has been made a victim in any way and [] suffered no damage or
financial loss as a result of Mr. Caramadre’s investment program.” See Exhibit C,
Affidavit of Jennifer Duarte. One is left to wonder how many other Government
witnesses would have responded in similar fashion had Mr. Caramadre’s former attorneys
bothered to even attempt to interview any witnesses. As discussed in Mr. Caramadre’s
initial memorandum in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, such an abject
failure to investigate clearly constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
Similarly, defense counsel’s complete failure to conduct any meaningful crossexamination served to compound the ineffective assistance. In his opening memorandum,
Mr. Caramadre contrasted the 90 pages of cross-examination conducted by Mr. Pine and
Mr. Flanders in the (video) deposition of Edwin Rodriguez with the one and one-half
pages of cross-examination of Mr. Rodriguez at trial. The Government found this contrast
to be ironic, noting that Mr. Caramadre had sought to “suppress the testimony of Wiley
and other terminally ill deponents, arguing that Flanders and Pine had no meaningful
ability to cross-examine.” Gov. Opp. at 21. The Government misses the salient point;
even without a meaningful ability to cross-examine, Attorneys Flanders and Pine
managed to do so. In contrast, Attorney Lepizzera, who did have the opportunity to crossexamine Mr. Rodriguez at trial, utterly failed to do so.

4

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 5 of 28 PageID #: 2245

In addition, Mr. Caramadre’s original memo criticized Mr. Lepizzera’s failure to
cross-examine Kenneth Blowers who, inter alia, testified that his wife had undergone a
“lobotomy”, when in fact she had undergone a lobectomy, a completely different and far
less serious procedure. The Government attempts to justify this failure by characterizing
Mr. Lepizzera’s inaction as a “tactical decision not to hammer a widower” about his
understanding of his wife’s condition. Gov. Opp. at 21. While it appears that it was the
Government’s modus operandi to “hammer” its own witnesses in the investigation and
prosecution of this case, see Exhibit C, it goes without saying (or should go without
saying) that a competent cross-examination can be conducted by a professional attorney
without resorting to “hammering.” Moreover, Mr. Lepizzera’s “cross-examination” of
this witness completely ignored the multiple contradictions between his testimony at trial
and his testimony at the grand jury.
Mr. Traini’s Conflict Of Interest
In his opening memorandum, Mr. Caramadre argued that Attorney Traini had an
unwaivable conflict of interest in that his fee agreement, which purportedly called for a
“non-refundable flat fee in the amount of $450,000.00”, contained a clause which stated
that in the event that the “proceedings terminated prior to the estimated completion of
trial (through February 2013), whether by plea or for any other reason”, the balance of
the fee would be “deemed earned, and will be payable to Attorney Traini forthwith.” See
Exhibit D, Fee Agreement for Attorney Anthony M. Traini. In its response, the
Government found this claim to be “astounding” in light of the fact that Mr. Caramadre
had made a valid waiver of any conflict of interest in regard to Attorney Traini’s

5

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 6 of 28 PageID #: 2246

representation of Government witness, Edward Maggiacomo, an unidicted co-conspirator
who had entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the Government.
The Government’s position is, at the very least, ironic, in light of the fact that they
themselves sought to disqualify Attorney Traini, arguing to this Court that “the potential
conflict of interest is so serious that it is unwaivable.” See Motion of United States to
Disqualify Counsel Based on Conflict of Interest (hereinafter “Gov. Disq.”) at 5. Indeed,
the Government argued that to permit Attorney Traini to represent Mr. Caramadre
“would simply lay the groundwork for a future claim by Caramadre that he was denied
effective assistance of counsel due to Traini’s representation of Maggiacomo.” See Gov.
Disq. at 13. In any event, the particular conflict of interest at issue is the result primarily
of Attorney Traini’s “non-refundable fee agreement”, which obviously provides
tremendous financial incentive for Attorney Traini to induce Mr. Caramadre to plead
guilty. 1 This particular conflict appears to have been unanticipated by the parties in the
waiver proceedings.
Evidence of Innocence
The Government’s opposition suggests that Mr. Caramadre’s claim of innocence
“has no credibility”, characterizing his four year history of maintaining his innocence,
and unequivocally refusing to consider a plea agreement, as “loud and frequent ballyhoos
of innocence.” See Gov. Opp. at 26. In so concluding, however, the Government
completely ignores the fact that Mr. Caramadre risks a prosecution for perjury, as well as

1

There is some question as to the propriety of the fee agreement itself, as it is not signed by Mr.
Caramadre, but appears to have been drafted by Attorney Traini and Mr. Lepizzera, purportedly as a “duly
authorized” agent for Mr. Caramadre. It does not bear the signature of Mr. Caramadre, who will testify that
he did not authorize such a fee agreement.

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 7 of 28 PageID #: 2247

his loss of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Perhaps the most
important evidence of innocence is that which has been filed under seal.
Timing Of Mr. Caramadre’s Request
The Government’s memo states that Mr. Caramadre’s affidavit “admits” that it
was not until December 20, 2012 that he raised the issue of withdrawing his plea with his
attorneys, demanding put his options in writing. While the December 20 date was the first
time that he formally requested that his options be reduced to writing, he actually notified
Mr. Lepizzera verbally of his intention as early as December 8, 2012. In addition, on
December 10, Mr. Caramadre contacted Attorney Robert Flanders for a referral to an
attorney who could prosecute a motion to withdraw his plea. See Exhibit E, December
12, 2013 Email from Attorney Robert Flanders to Joseph Caramadre. Attorney Flanders
responded with a referral on December 12. Moreover, Mr. Caramadre will testify that he
first decided to pursue such action within days of having tenderd his plea.
Plea Agreement
The Government’s opposition opines that the fact that Mr. Caramadre pleaded
pursuant to a plea agreement “militates against allowing the defendant to withdraw his
plea.” Gov. Opp. at 27. In its memo, the Government repeatedly states that the statement
of facts incorporated into the fee agreement was drafted and negotiated by Mr.
Caramadre. See Gov. Opp. at 4 (“the agreed upon facts were repeatedly revised to
accommodate changes insisted upon by Caramadre”); at 13 (“most notable are the
detailed facts he painstakingly negotiated . . .”); and at 27 (“he negotiated the statement
of facts supporting the plea, and swore to them under oath”).

7

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 8 of 28 PageID #: 2248

In fact, Mr. Caramadre himself did not even see the statement of facts until the
Sunday night before his Monday morning plea. In an email from Attorney Lepizzera to
AUSA Vilker, Mr. Lepizzera informs Mr. Vilker of his belief that the statement of facts
is too broad. In his response to the email, AUSA Vilker informed Mr. Lepizzera that:
There’s not going to be much wiggle room on this Mike.
This is a culmination of input from my supervisors. If he’s
not willing to admit these facts, then we should let the jury
decide. If you have some specific changes here and there
you want, then we will consider those requests. But by in
large, this is what the Statement of Facts will be.
See Exhibit F, Saturday, November 17, 2012 Emails Between Attorney Lepizzera and
AUSA Vilker. In fact, the only substantive change to the plea agreement that was
suggested by Mr. Caramadre was a request to remove the name of his brother-in-law, and
Aegon Insurance, from the statement of facts. He had no other input in the drafting of the
statement of facts. Under these circumstances, the existence of a plea agreement militates
little, if at all, against withdrawal of the plea.
The Rule 11 Colloquoy
In his motion, Mr. Caramadre maintained that the Rule 11 hearing was defective
as a result of the Court’s failure to explore questions raised by Mr. Caramadre’s
acknowledged use of multiple prescription medications. See United States v. Parra, 936
F.2d 588 (1st Cir. 1991); see Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Joseph
Caramadre’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea, 29-34. In response, the Government
argues that the Court is entitled to rely on the representations Mr. Caramadre made in the
course of the plea colloquy. A court is entitled to give weight to a Defendant’s statements
at his change of plea colloquy absent a good reason for disregarding them. United
States v. Miranda, 654 F.3d 130, 138 (1st Cir. 2011) (emphasis added), quoting United

8

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 9 of 28 PageID #: 2249

States v. Torres-Rosario, 447 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir. 2006). A “defendant’s own assurances
in open court [regarding emotional or mental impairment] at the time of the plea may be
given less weight if later evidence to the contrary emerges.” Miranda, 654 at 138, quoting
United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 598 (1st Cir. 2013).
In this case, abundant reason has been given to disregard Mr. Caramadre’s
responses at the plea colloquy. His severe depression, the use of multiple medications to
treat his depression, the effect on him of his wife’s breakdown, and the realization that
his attorneys were providing no resistance to the Government’s case, in the aggregate,
induced a plea which was involuntary. Pursuant to Parra, it is incumbent upon the Court,
in light of its awareness of Mr. Caramadre’s medical history, to conduct a far more
searching inquiry into his ability to knowingly and voluntarily enter a guilty plea. The
failure to do so constitutes a Rule 11 violation, which itself warrants the withdrawal of
his plea.
Perhaps most importantly, is the fact that Mr. Caramadre made it clear to his
attorneys, prior to and at the time that he tendered his plea, that in order to plead guilty he
would have to lie to the Court regarding his admission to criminal conduct. At all times
prior to the tender of his plea, Mr. Caramadre denied any criminal conduct, and has
admitted to lying at the plea colloquy in order for the Court to accept the plea. There is no
dispute that Mr. Caramadre informed his attorneys that the only way he could agree to the
criminal conduct, as outlined in the statement of facts, was to lie.
“The First Circuit has stated that ‘whether a defendant has pled intelligently and
voluntarily, depends upon the competence of counsel’s advice’ and ‘ineffective
assistance of counsel, is . . . a fair and just reason’ supporting withdrawal.” United States

9

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 144 Filed 04/23/13 Page 10 of 28 PageID #: 2250

v. Desimone, 736 F.Supp. 2d 477, at 485-86 (D.C. RI 2010), quoting United States v.
Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 313 (1st Cir. 1987). Mr. Caramadre will testify that despite making
former counsel aware of the circumstance, he was led to believe that he could indeed
plead guilty despite his claims of actual innocence. Mr. Caramadre will testify that
Attorney Traini advised him (through some type of fanciful contrivance) that at the exact
moment that he pleaded guilty, he would in fact be guilty and therefore could tender his
plea under these circumstances. Nor was this the only misadvice Attorney Traini gave
Mr. Caramadre in an attempt to induce his plea. See Affidavit of Joseph Caramadre
(factually misadvising Mr. Caramadre that the longer the trial went on, the longer Mr.
Caramadre’s sentence would be). These circumstances alone warrant the grant of the
motion to withdraw guilty plea.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Mr. Caramadre’s motion to
withdraw his guilty plea.
