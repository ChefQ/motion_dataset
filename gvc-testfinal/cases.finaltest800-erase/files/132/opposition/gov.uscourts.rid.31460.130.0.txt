GOVERNMENT=S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
CARAMADRE=S MOTION TO WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA
The United States of America, by and through its undersigned
attorneys, hereby opposes Defendant Joseph Caramadre=s Motion to
Withdraw His Guilty Plea.
INTRODUCTION
After four days and an avalanche of damning evidence in what
was anticipated to be a three to fourth month trial, defendant Joseph
Caramadre (“Caramadre”) pled guilty on November 19, 2012, pursuant
to a written Plea Agreement and signed Statement of Facts.

Almost

four months later, as sentencing approaches, Caramadre has moved to
withdraw his plea.

A self-proclaimed master of exploiting

contractual loopholes, Caramadre’s latest now seeks to find a
loophole in his guilty plea by blaming, among others, his wife, his
lawyers, his psychotherapist, his co-defendant, and the Court. As
discussed below, every one of the factors adopted by the First Circuit

for evaluating a motion to withdraw a plea militates against granting
the defendant’s motion.

Accordingly, Caramadre’s motion to

withdraw his guilty plea should be denied.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
1. PRE-TRIAL
On November 17, 2011, Caramadre and his co-defendant Raymour
Radhakrishnan were charged in a sixty-six count indictment with wire
fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy, identity fraud, aggravated identity
theft, and money laundering.
count of witness tampering.

Caramadre was also charged with one
The Indictment alleges that Caramadre

devised and executed a fraudulent scheme, later joined by
Radhakrishnan, to make millions of dollars by securing the identities
of terminally ill people through material misrepresentations and
omissions to be used to purchase variable annuities and corporate
bonds with death benefit features.
Due to the length of the scheme and the large number of people
and transactions involved, trial was anticipated to last between
three and four months with seventy-five to one-hundred witnesses.
From the outset, Caramadre and Radhakrishnan sought to be tried
separately from each other despite the preference for joint trials
in the federal criminal justice system.

Initially, Caramadre

demanded a speedy trial, while Radhakrishnan requested additional
time to prepare.

The Court balanced these requests by setting the

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 3 of 31 PageID #: 2131

case for trial in the fall of 2012 and establishing a firm pre-trial
schedule.

(See generally ECF Nos. 15, 16, 19, 31, 32, 33).

Both

Radhakrishnan and Caramadre then moved for severances, which were
denied.

(See ECF Nos. 69 and 84).

failed.

That effort also

(See ECF No. 95).

The parties, and the Court, then underwent a lengthy and
vigorous process of jury selection which entailed issuing and
reviewing approximately 500 questionnaires.

Jury selection itself

took place over three days in October.
The government prepared for trial, including the preparation
of all its witnesses, throughout the summer and fall of 2012.

This

was a traumatic experience for many witnesses, who were required to
relive some of the most difficult moments in their lives.

Prior to

trial, at least seven government witnesses died, including three who
were never deposed pre-trial. 1
2. TRIAL
Trial began on November 13, 2012.

The government produced

overwhelming evidence of both defendants’ guilt.

Numerous

witnesses testified, including Edwin Rodriguez, a terminally ill

1

Daniel Bulpitt, Michelle Perotta and Matthew Kiely passed away without being
deposed because they were not diagnosed as terminally ill and their deaths were
not foreseeable to the government. Richard Wiley, Patrick Garvey, Robert Mizzoni,
Leon Bradshaw and Anthony Pittocco passed away after being deposed. Jason
Veveiros was too ill and subsequently passed away without being deposed.

paraplegic for whom testifying was both a physical and emotional
gauntlet, and the widows, widowers and children of deceased victims
of Caramadre’s identify theft scheme.

It was obvious to all

observers of the trial, including Caramadre and his wife, that both
defendants were likely to be convicted of most, if not all counts,
and face lengthy prison sentences.
After three days, at the instigation of Caramadre, the parties
began plea negotiations.

The plea agreement and accompanying signed

Statement of Facts were painstakingly negotiated throughout the
weekend of November 17-18, 2012.

The agreed upon facts were

repeatedly revised to accommodate changes insisted upon by
Caramadre. Ultimately, counsel for Caramadre (and Radhakrishnan)
successfully secured favorable plea agreements, capping the
defendants’ potential exposure at ten years imprisonment 2.

The

government agreed to these favorable terms in order to spare the
victims who had not yet testified the additional pain and suffering
of enduring that experience, as well as to conserve the government
and judicial resources which would be spent over the ensuing months.
On November 19, 2012, the Court conducted a hearing pursuant
to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11.

Caramadre, an attorney

and member of the Bar of this Court, swore under oath that he had

read, understood and signed the plea agreement and Statement of
Facts.

Caramadre further represented that he was satisfied with the

representation he received from his attorneys and that that no one
had threatened or coerced him in order to get him to plead guilty.
Caramadre assured the Court that notwithstanding his history of
depression and medications, he fully understood the proceedings and
the rights that he was giving up by pleading guilty.
proceeded with a full and thorough plea colloquy.

was discharged and the trial dismantled.

The jury

In the hallway after the

plea hearing, Caramadre personally thanked U.S. Attorney Peter
Neronha “for being so fair.”
LEGAL FRAMEWORK
It is a bedrock principal that having chosen to plead guilty,
a defendant possesses no absolute right to retract his plea.

United

States v. Gates, -- F.3d --, 2013 WL 765121 (1st Cir. 2013); United
States v. Negron-Narvaez, 403 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2005); United
States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir. 1997).
Rather, a defendant may be allowed to withdraw a guilty plea
before sentencing only for a “fair and just reason.” Marrero-Rivera,
124 F.3d at 347.
Id.

The burden of persuasion rests with the defendant.

It is “a heavy burden.”

United States v. Miranda-Gonzalez, 181
5

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 6 of 31 PageID #: 2134

F.3d 164 (1st Cir. 1999).
To determine whether the defendant has met this heavy burden,
the District Court must consider several factors, “the most
significant being whether the plea was voluntary, intelligent and
knowing, within the meaning of Rule 11.”
at 347.

Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d

“Other relevant considerations include (1) the plausibility

and weight of the proffered reason; (2) the timing of the request;
(3) whether the defendant asserted legal innocence; and (4) whether
the parties had reached, or breached, a plea agreement.”

Id. See

also United States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 834 (1st Cir. 1996); United
States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995). “Assuming the
defendant carries the burden of persuasion on the aforementioned
considerations, the District Court must weigh in balance any
demonstrable prejudice to the government were the defendant allowed
to withdraw the plea.” Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 347; Isom, 85 F.3d
at 835; United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1537 (1st Cir.
1989).
I.

THE RULE 11 HEARING

The First Circuit has repeatedly affirmed the refusal to vacate
a guilty plea “when Rule 11 procedures have been assiduously
observed.”

United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 312 (1st Cir. 1987).

“We have identified three ‘core’ Rule 11 concerns: 1) voluntariness,
i.e., absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the charge; and 3)
6

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 7 of 31 PageID #: 2135

knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea.”
124 F.3d at 348, n.7.

Marerro-Rivera,

“A total failure to address any “core concern”

mandates that a guilty plea be set aside.”

Id. at 348 (emphasis in

original).
“The courts seem to indicate that since they are bending over
backwards to make sure that a defendant is aware of what he is doing
when he enters a guilty plea, they will not allow a defendant to make
a mockery of the system by allowing him to withdraw his plea simply
because he changes his mind and now wants a jury trial.”

Ramos, 810

F.2d 308, quoting “Withdrawal of Guilty Pleas in the Federal Courts
Prior to Sentencing,” 27 Baylor L.Rev. 793, 799 (1975).
Far from a total failure to address any core concern of Rule
11, the change of plea colloquy assiduously followed Rule 11
procedures and ensured Caramadre’s change of plea was intelligent,
knowing and voluntary.

At the beginning of the hearing, Caramadre,

an attorney and member of the bar, was placed under oath.

The Court

inquired:

THE COURT: So you’ve… been sworn in. I’m going to ask you a
series of questions. You’re expected to answer all of my
questions truthfully. If you fail to answer any of my questions
truthfully, it could lead to additional charges against you for
perjury or for making a false statement. Do ... you understand
that?
MR. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 8 of 31 PageID #: 2136

(Hearing Transcript at 4).
In order to ensure the plea was knowing, voluntary and
intelligent, The Court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy
inquiring into multiple topics:
1. COMPETENCE
THE COURT:
Have ... you been treated recently for any
mental illness or addiction to narcotic drugs?
MR. CARAMADRE: Your Honor, I have been treated for mental
depression, both lately and for the last twenty years.
MR. TRAINI:
Excuse me, your Honor, if I may. I have with
me a list of Mr. Caramadre’s medications so that we don’t have
to go through them.
THE COURT:

Sure.

Could you just bring that up.

MR. TRAINI:

The Government has seen this, your Honor.

THE COURT:
And can we just confirm, with respect to Mr.
Caramadre, that you fully understand all the proceedings that
are going on here, correct?
MR. CARAMADRE: That is correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:
And nothing in terms of these medications would
have any effect on your ability to comprehend what’s going on
here?
MR. CARAMADRE: No, Sir.
THE COURT:

And counsel can just confirm that, please.

MR. TRAINI:

Yes, your Honor. That’s correct.

THE COURT:

All right.

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 9 of 31 PageID #: 2137

2. UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHARGES

THE COURT: You have seen a copy of the government’s charges
against you, is that right?
MR. CARAMADRE: That’s correct, your Honor.
THE COURT: And you . . . had a full opportunity to discuss all
of these charges against you with your counsel; is that right?
MR. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.
(Transcript at 6-7).

3. UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY

THE COURT: And did . . . you have a full opportunity to discuss
all of the charges against you and the plea agreements and the
consequences of these plea agreements with your counsel before
you signed the plea agreements?
MR. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.
***
THE COURT:
Now are … you fully satisfied – first of all,
were your counsel able to answer all of your questions regarding
all of the charges and the terms of the plea agreements with
you?
MR. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.
(Transcript at 7).

4. SATISFACTION WITH COUNSEL

THE COURT: And are… you fully satisfied with all of the
representation that you’ve received in this case from your
respective counsel?
MR. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.

(Transcript at 7).
5. ABSENCE OF COERCION

THE COURT: Now, has anyone made any promises to you of any kind
in order to get you to – other than what’s contained in the plea
agreement, or course in order to get you to plead guilty in these
cases?
MR. CARAMADRE: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Has anyone threatened you in any way to get you to
plead guilty?
MR. CARAMADRE: No, your Honor.
(Transcript at 7-8).

The Court then proceeded at length to explain to Caramadre the
maximum penalties he would face, the terms of the plea agreement,
the potential effect of the sentencing guidelines, the waiver of
appeal rights, and all the rights Caramadre would have at trial –
the presumption of innocence, the right to counsel, the right to cross
examine witnesses, the right to remain silent, the right to compel
witnesses, the burden of proof, etc.

(Transcript 8-16).

The Court

then inquired:

THE COURT: Now, by entering these pleas of guilty today, you’re
giving up all these rights that I’ve just described to you and
you understand that there will not be or we will not complete
the trial in this case. Do you understand that?
MR. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 11 of 31 PageID #: 2139

(Transcript at 16).

The Court then asked AUSA Vilker to read into the record the
Statement of Facts which formed the basis of the plea agreement.

The

Statement of Facts was explicitly negotiated by Mr. Caramadre, an
attorney, over a period of days.

After AUSA Vilker read the

Statement of Facts into the record the Court inquired:

THE COURT: So I need to ask you on the record, do … you agree
that these facts are true and these are the facts of the case?
Mr. Caramadre?
Mr. CARAMADRE: Yes, your Honor.
(Transcript at 25).
***
THE COURT: Now I’m going to ask… you how you wish to plead to
these charges, guilty or not guilty? Beginning with you Mr.
Caramadre.
MR. CARAMADRE: Guilty.
(Transcript at 25-26).

The Court was and is entitled to rely on these representations
by Caramadre.

normally bound by the representations that he himself makes in open
Court at the time of his plea.”

Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 352. The First Circuit has repeatedly
stated that A>[W]e will not permit a defendant to turn his back on
his own representations to the court merely because it would suit
his convenience to do so.=@ Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373 (quoting

U.S. 63, 74 (1977)).
II.

THE PROFFERED REASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL

Caramadre asserts numerous reasons to justify withdrawal.

He

claims (1) that he was incompetent to plead guilty due to “his
compromised mental health”; (2) “pressures created by the emotional
breakdown of his wife”; (3) his attorneys’ “insistent attempts to
induce a plea” and “deficient performance at trial”; (4) “infirmity
in the Rule 11 colloquy” and (5) the existence of an “unwaivable
conflict of interest” with respect to one of his attorneys. (Mem.
In Supp’t of Motion to Withdraw at 2).
Like the fraud scheme Caramadre perpetuated on terminally ill
people and financial institutions for nearly fifteen years,
Caramadre’s proffered reasons for withdrawal contain numerous

12

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 13 of 31 PageID #: 2141

misrepresentations and material omissions. Most notable are the
detailed facts he painstakingly negotiated and admitted to under oath
in open Court, and now denies.

But even assuming arguendo that the

factual allegations made by Caramadre in support of these claims are
true (a dubious proposition in light of the presumption in favor of
his previous, sworn testimony to the contrary at the change of plea
hearing), Caramadre still fails to meet his heavy burden of
demonstrating that his guilty plea was a total failure to address
any of Rule 11’s core concerns.

A[W]hen the defendant=s factual

allegations, even if true, fail to establish a cognizable defense,
they do not provide a reason for permitting withdrawal of a plea.@
United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1242 (1st Cir. 1991)(citing
Barker, 514 F.2d at 220).
1. CARAMADRE WAS NOT INCOMPENTENT
Caramadre claims that he was mentally incompetent to plead
guilty.

He cites his twenty-year history of depression, his

psychologist’s unavailability during the weekend that he negotiated
the plea and Statement of Facts, pressures he felt as a result of
his wife’s emotional breakdown, his adamant refusal to plead guilty
previously and the surprise of others that he decided to change his
plea to guilty. He fails to meet his burden.

13

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 14 of 31 PageID #: 2142

A. MENTAL COMPETENCE
Nothing in the affidavits submitted by Caramadre demonstrates
that Caramadre was mentally incompetent to plead guilty.

The

affidavit submitted by Caramadre’s treating psychiatrist, Sarah L.
Xavier, does not indicate that Caramadre suffered from any type of
psychosis at the time of the Rule 11 hearing which would render him
incapable of making a knowing and voluntary decision to plead guilty.
(Defense Exhibit D).

To the contrary, the affidavit demonstrates

that the only urgent calls Dr. Xavier received from Caramadre
occurred on “11/30/12 and 12/08/12,” two and three weeks after
Caramadre pled guilty.

Moreover, the affidavit states that

Caramadre “pled guilty in the context of his wife’s psychological
frailty” and “he was struggling with his decision.”

This

demonstrates classic buyer’s remorse and is not a valid basis for
a plea withdrawal.

It is quite apparent that Caramadre, having

achieved his desire of stopping the trial, resumed his “intense need
to declare his innocence.”

(See Defense Ex. D).

An intense need

to declare one’s innocence does not mean the person is innocent.
Caramadre also submitted an affidavit from his priest and
spiritual adviser, Rev. Robert Lacombe. (Defense Ex. C).

Rev.

Lacombe’s affidavit does not claim any medical credentials or
expertise in psychology or psychotherapy, and offers no medical
diagnosis that Caramadre was incapable of pleading guilty on November
14

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 15 of 31 PageID #: 2143

19, 2012.

In fact, Rev. Lacombe advised Caramadre to plead guilty

at the time.

Rev. Lacombe writes that “I now realize that lack of

a vigorous defense unduly frightened and compromised Mr. Caramadre’s
decision and adversely affected his family.

Had I known of the

specifics of the trial, as I do now, I would not have recommended”
that Caramadre plead guilty. (Defense Ex. C).

Rev. Lacombe’s

affidavit fails to identify his source of information regarding “the
specifics of the trial” or “lack of vigorous defense.”

Rev.

Lacombe’s affidavit does not establish incompetence.
Caramadre also submitted an affidavit from his psychotherapist,
Dr. Caron Zlotnick. (Defense Exhibit E). Again, Dr. Zlotnick’s
affidavit offers no claim that Caramadre suffered from psychosis or
was incapable of pleading guilty on November 19, 2012.

Its sole

purpose is to establish that Dr. Zlotnick was in South Africa during
the trial, and was “shocked” when she learned he pled guilty. It was
no surprise to anyone who actually saw the evidence presented at trial
that Caramadre decided to limit the damage and plead guilty.
Finally, Caramadre submits an affidavit from Dr. James Greer,
his current psychiatrist.

(Defense Ex. F).

Dr. Greer’s evaluation

took place in February 2013, more than two months after Caramadre
pled guilty.

Notably, Dr. Greer’s affidavit states that “At no point

in any history I reviewed or in the course of our examination was
there any evidence of or history consistent with psychosis or mania.”
15

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 16 of 31 PageID #: 2144

(Defense Ex. F, pp. 3).

Dr. Greer’s affidavit is based on records

he reviewed (the statements from Dr. Zlotnick and Dr. Xavier) as well
as Caramadre’s representations to him.

These included Caramadre’s

lack of faith in his attorneys and concern for his wife.

Caramadre

further told Dr. Greer “I begrudgingly went before the judge and
accepted the deal.”

Noticeably absent from Dr. Greer’s affidavit

is any report by Caramadre regarding his role in negotiating the
detailed Statement of Facts which he signed, nor the lengthy Rule
11 colloquy undergone by the Court.

Far from “begrudgingly

accepting the deal,” Caramadre knowingly and intelligently pled
guilty of his own free will, because it was in his best interest to
do so at the time.
B. MRS. CARAMADRE’S EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN
The affidavit submitted by Caramadre’s wife states “[t]he
government’s opening statement was very damaging to Joe’s case.

It

was the first time that I heard the factual allegations against Joe.”
(Defense Ex. M, ¶4).

“For the three and a half years prior to the

date Joe pleaded guilty, he always asserted his innocence despite
the great costs it had to our family.

Joe wanted to prove to our

children and family that he was innocent and that he was not a
criminal.”

(Defense Ex. M, ¶2).

The problem for Mr. Caramadre was

that he was not innocent, he is a criminal, and the evidence proved

16

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 17 of 31 PageID #: 2145

it.

Nonetheless, it appears that despite a 72 page speaking

Indictment issued by the grand jury a year earlier, discovery
provided to Caramadre containing the prior statements of every
potential witness in the government’s case, as well as numerous media
reports covering the case, Caramadre apparently succeeded in keeping
his wife in the dark about how he made his fortune.

It is therefore

unsurprising that within two days of observing the witnesses testify
against her husband, Mrs. Caramadre sadly suffered an emotional
breakdown.
While it is unfortunate that Mrs. Caramadre has suffered from
learning of her husband’s criminal conduct, any pressure Caramadre
felt to plead guilty in order to ease the pain he caused her is
irrelevant to the plea withdrawal analysis.

As the First Circuit

has said, Caramadre “misperceives the focus of the plea-retraction
inquiry: while evidence of this stripe is probative of an accused’s
motivation for pleading guilty, it does not necessarily show
coercion, duress, or involuntariness.

Criminal prosecutions are

stressful experiences for nearly all concerned – particularly
defendants and their families.

It is to be expected that feelings

will run strong within a family unit and that loved ones will advise,
counsel, implore, beseech and exhort defendants to take –or abjuremyriad courses of action.

The relevant question for plea withdrawal

is not whether the accused was sensitive to external considerations
17

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 18 of 31 PageID #: 2146

– many defendants are – but instead whether the decision to plead
was voluntary, i.e., a product of free will.”

Pellerito, 878 F.2d

at 1541 (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Ramos, 810 F.2d at
314; United States v. Buckley, 847 F.2d 1000 n. 6 (1st Cir. 1988).
In this case Caramadre pled guilty freely because he knew he would
be convicted and he wanted to limit his exposure in prison time. A
voluntary guilty plea does not transform into an involuntary one
simply because the defendant wanted to spare his wife from seeing
the additional evidence which would have been presented during the
rest of the trial.
In sum, Caramadre has failed to meet his burden of establishing
his mental health or that of his wife rendered his plea involuntary.
The First Circuit is rife with decisions in which defendants have
been barred from withdrawing their guilty pleas under similar
circumstances.

See e.g., United States v. Sousa, 468 F.3d 42 (1st

Cir. 2006)(denial of plea withdrawal where defendant’s wife
diagnosed with terminal illness four days before trial);
Miranda-Gonzalez, 181 F.3d 164 (1st Cir. 1999)(denial of plea
withdrawal where defendant took potentially mood altering medication
to treat depression and anxiety); United States v. Aker, 181 F.3d
167, 171 (1st Cir. 1999)(no plea withdrawal where defendant despondent
over death of his wife); Ramos, 810 F.2d at 314 (denial of plea
withdrawal despite defendant claim that emotionally depressed state
18

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 19 of 31 PageID #: 2147

affected voluntariness of plea); Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541 (denial
of plea withdrawal despite depressed state and family pressure);
Figueroa Vazquez v. United States, 718 F.2d 511, 512 (1st Cir.
1983)(denial of plea withdrawal despite claim defendant mentally
incompetent).
2. COUNSEL WERE NOT INEFFECTIVE
Caramadre next absurdly blames his decision to plead guilty on
the performance of his attorneys, Anthony M. Traini and Michael J.
Lepizzera.

The standard for evaluating ineffective assistance of

counsel claims pursuant to Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668
(1984), applies to pre-sentence attempts to withdraw a plea.
810 F.2d at 314.

Ramos,

To prevail, a defendant must show that “counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.”
Id.

The defendant must also demonstrate that “the deficient

performance prejudiced the defense.”

Negron-Navarez, 403 F.3d at

40.
It should be noted that Lepizzera represented Caramadre
beginning at least a year prior to return of the Indictment. 3
was added as co-counsel in July 2012.

Traini

Both Traini and Lepizzera are

Since the inception of the investigation, Caramadre (an attorney) has been
represented by numerous lawyers. He has been represented, in sequential order,
by Robert Flanders and Michael Connolly (plus a team of associates) from Hinckley,
Allen and Snyder; Lepizzera and his partner Scott DeMello of Lepizzera Lapricona;
James T. McCormack; Traini; and currently Randy Olen and Robert Watt. Caramadre
also briefly appeared pro se.

well respected, veteran defense counsel, highly experienced in
practicing federal criminal law.

Hindsight being twenty-twenty, at

least for Caramadre’s current counsel, Caramadre cherry picks
specific strategic and tactical decisions made by counsel during the
four days of what they believed would be a four month trial, (which
of course ended when Caramadre instructed them to initiate plea
negotiations with the government).

The defense case, had there been

one, would not have started until February 2013 at the earliest.
Traini and Lepizzera reserved opening statement so that it could be
delivered at that time.
In the face of four days of devastating trial testimony, Traini
and Lepizzera successfully negotiated a plea agreement at the request
of Caramadre.

The plea agreement capped Caramadre’s exposure to a

maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment with no mandatory minimum.
If the trial continued and Caramadre was convicted, he would have
faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years imprisonment, maximum
statutory penalties in excess of one hundred years, and an advisory
guideline range of life.

Most defendants would consider that heroic

work.
Caramadre first claims a failure to investigate witnesses.

As

proof, Caramadre offers an inconclusive e-mail requesting interviews
of three specific witnesses, none of whom were among those who
testified during the four days of trial.
20

“A defendant is entitled

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 21 of 31 PageID #: 2149

to lawyerly exercise of reasonable skill and diligence, not to an
unquestioning slave in a three-piece suit who will do whatever the
client bids, no matter how far-fetched.”

Pellerito, 878 F.2d at

1543.
Caramadre next critiques Lepizzera’s cross-examination.
Ironically, Caramadre contrasts Lepizzera’s cross of witnesses to
the cross-examination of Richard Wiley by prior counsel Robert
Flanders and Jeffrey Pine.

In an earlier pleading, Caramadre

attempted to suppress the testimony of Wiley and other terminally
ill deponents, arguing that Flanders and Pine had no meaningful
ability to cross examine. (See ECF No. 52).
In one example, Caramadre particularly faults Lepizerra’s
failure to establish that Deborah Blowers had undergone a lobectomy,
rather than a lobotomy, as Kenneth Blowers testified. Lepizzera’s
tactical decision not to hammer a widower regarding his understanding
of the fine details of his late wife’s brain surgery twenty years
earlier falls far from “objectively unreasonable,” particularly in
light of the fact that medical records in evidence documented Mrs.
Blowers’ limited brain function post-surgery.
In support of his critique, Caramadre submits an affidavit from
Harrison Condit.

To the extent that it proves anything, the

affidavit itself corroborates Blowers’ testimony that he thought he
received a phone call from Caramadre without ever previously knowing
21

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 22 of 31 PageID #: 2150

him.

It fills in a minor and irrelevant detail of how Caramadre got

Blowers’ phone number, i.e., through Condit.
to Caramadre.

It is of no assistance

Seen in this light, Lepizerra’s “restraint” on

cross-examination seems wise; it is a far cry from “objectively
unreasonable.”
Caramadre similarly attacks the cross-examination of other
witnesses, speculating how it could have been done better and
ignoring the inevitable rehabilitation on re-direct.

While it is

convenient for Caramadre to second guess counsel’s tactical and
strategic decisions now, they bear no weight on the effectiveness
of the representation.

See United States v. Farrah, 128 F.Supp 2d

103, 116 (D.Conn 2001)(Defense attorney's decisions to forego
opening statement, to forego vigorous pursuit of line of questioning
advocated by defendant during cross-examination, and to forego
calling several witnesses advocated by defendant, were strategic
decisions supported by sound reasoning and thus could not constitute
deficient performance). All told, Caramadre’s criticism amounts to
nothing more than arm-chair quarterbacking that falls well short of
ineffective assistance.
A. ALLEGED CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Caramadre also alleges that Traini had an unwaivable conflict
of interest as a result of his prior (and future) representation of
potential government witness Edward Maggiacomo.
22

Caramadre makes

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 23 of 31 PageID #: 2151

this astounding claim even after the Court made a finding, at his
urging, that any potential conflict was waivable, and that Caramadre
and Maggiacomo both made valid waivers.

(ECF. No. 71).

Caramadre

swore under oath in open Court that he knowingly, intelligently and
voluntarily waived any conflict of interest that Traini might have.
As has been seen, Caramadre has a habit of reneging his sworn
statements.

The expiration date on Caramadre’s credibility has long

since passed.
Next, citing no law whatsoever, Caramadre points to his fee
arrangement with Traini and complains that the Court failed to
address that “unwaivable” conflict in the form of an incentive for
Traini to urge Caramadre to plead guilty.

Caramadre, an attorney

well versed in fee-arrangements, ignores the fact that he himself
was in the best position to provide that information to the Court.
Even assuming the accuracy of Caramadre’s descriptions of
Traini’s advice to plead guilty, there is nothing ineffective or
coercive about an attorney advising a client to plead guilty.

“Even

assuming counsel persuaded him that a guilty plea would serve [the
defendant]’s best interest, the resultant plea would not be rendered
involuntary.”

Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 349; see also Williams

v. Chrans, 945 F.2d 926, 933 (7th Cir. 1991)(“Advice, even strong
urging, by counsel” does not invalidate a guilty plea).
“Nor can the mere fact that [defendant] and counsel may have
23

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 24 of 31 PageID #: 2152

undervalued the merit of any potential defense render the Rule 11
plea involuntary.”

Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 350.

“In

determining whether to arrive at a plea agreement, criminal
defendants, with the assistance of counsel, must compare the merit
of their defenses with the strength of the government’s case, as well
as the penalties likely to be imposed pursuant to a plea agreement
or following trial.

Were it otherwise, the belatedly-realized

mistakes in their pre-plea assessments were deemed sufficient,
without more to warrant plea withdrawals, plea agreements and the
pleas entered pursuant to them would become meaningless.”

Id.

3. THE TIMING OF CARAMADRE’S REQUEST
Caramadre did not file his Motion to Withdraw until more than
three months after his change of plea. “The timing of a motion to
withdraw a guilty plea is significant.

Delayed requests, even if

made before sentencing, are generally regarded with disfavor.”
Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373. “The rule of thumb is that the longer
a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency
his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.”

Id.

Accord, Isom, 85 F.3d at 838 (“We have repeatedly noted that the more
a request is delayed B even if made before sentence is imposed B the
more we will regard it with disfavor”).

“A swift change of heart

reduces the likelihood of prejudice to the government from permitting
withdrawal, and strongly indicates that the plea was entered in
24

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 25 of 31 PageID #: 2153

‘haste and confusion.’”

Ramos, 810 F.2d at 312.

Accordingly, the

First Circuit has found even small delays in the filing of a motion
to withdraw pleas grounds for denying the motions.

E.g., Ramos, 810

F.2d at 313 (thirteen day delay too long); United States v. Keefe,
621 F.2d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 1980) (three week delay too long); Nunez
Cordero v. United States, 533 F.2d 723, 726 (1st Cir. 1976) (two week
delay too long).
Caramadre’s own affidavit admits that it was not until December
20, 2012 that Caramadre raised the issue of withdrawing his plea with
attorneys Lepizzera and Traini, demanding they put in writing his
options.

(Defense Ex. K, ¶4). Caramadre did not even request

additional time to file the Motion to Withdraw the plea until January
11, 2013.

That request came after the draft PSR was issued,

identifying a guideline range of life and likely restitution in the
tens of millions of dollars.

It then took an additional 6 weeks

before the actual Motion to Withdraw was filed. It is quite
transparent that Caramadre’s “change of heart” is a calculated
maneuver, and his purported justifications for withdrawal have been
painstakingly assembled over many months.

“Courts need not accept

a defendant’s explanations uncritically.”

Parilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d

at 373.

25

4. ASSERTION OF LEGAL INNOCENCE
Caramadre makes much of his loud and frequent ballyhoos of
innocence.

Indeed, both his psychotherapist and his wife comment

on his “intense need to declare his innocence to the world” and “to
prove to his children and family he is innocent.” (Defense Ex. D and
M).

But “merely voicing a claim of innocence has no weight in the

plea withdrawal calculus; to be given weight, it must be credible.”
Gates, -- F.3d --, 2013 WL 765121 at *9, citing United States v.
Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 1996).
of innocence has no credibility.

Caramadre’s claim

“It is contradicted by the change

of plea colloquy in which he acknowledged that he committed the
charged offenses.

The defendant listened to the prosecutor’s

opening statement and the testimony of the government’s initial
witnesses, heard the prosecutor vouch for that version of the case,
accepted the accuracy of that version and admitted his culpability.”
Id.
“There are few if any criminal cases where the defendant cannot
devise some theory or story which, if believed by a jury, would result
in his acquittal.=@

Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 455 (citing Nunez- Cordero,

533 F.2d at 726)(quoting Barker, 514 F.2d at 221).

“Weak and

implausible assertions of innocence” made long after a properly
entered guilty plea cannot provide the basis for withdrawal of that
plea.

United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir.
26

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 27 of 31 PageID #: 2155

1996).

Caramadre’s assertion amounts to nothing more than a blanket

denial of the very facts he himself negotiated, signed and swore to
under oath.

It gets no weaker.

III. PLEA AGREEMENT
The final factor, whether the defendant and the government have
reached a plea agreement, also militates against allowing the
defendant to withdraw his plea.

Caramadre reached a plea agreement

with the Government which ended a trial in progress.

He negotiated

the Statement of Facts supporting the plea and swore to them under
oath.

He ought to be held to it.

IV.

PREJUDICE TO THE GOVERNMENT

As noted above, even assuming Caramadre carried his burden of
persuasion, the Court would need to weigh any prejudice to the
government if it were to permit withdrawal of the plea.
prejudice would be significant.

Here the

As an initial matter, if the Court

were to permit Caramadre to withdraw his plea, the government would
be required to move to vacate co-defendant Radhakrishnan’s guilty
plea as well.

As the Court and both defendants are aware, and the

plea agreements explicitly state in Paragraph 1(b), the defendants
were offered a package plea deal. If the Court were to decline to
vacate Radhakrishnan’s plea, Caramadre would effectively be
permitted to circumvent this Court’s order denying severance.

27

He

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 28 of 31 PageID #: 2156

will have found his “loophole,” and yet again, he will have lied to
get through it.
Moreover, due to the nature of the scheme Caramadre developed,
numerous potential government witnesses were already deceased or
dying as the investigation got underway.

Over Caramadre’s hard

fought objections, the Court permitted the government to depose, in
the presence of Caramadre and subject to cross-examination by his
counsel, several terminally ill witnesses who had outlived their
diagnoses.

As noted above, several witnesses died between the time

the Indictment was issued and the trial. It is unknown how many
further government witnesses will be unavailable if a new trial is
permitted.

One government witness, Edwin Rodriguez, is in extremely

poor health and it is highly uncertain whether he would be able to
testify again.

Mr. Rodriguez has already endured the physical,

mental, and emotional trauma of testifying and being cross-examined
(not to mention the necessary preparation) both in a Rule 15
deposition and at trial.

Other government witnesses include elderly

family members of terminally ill people who have since died.

Many

of these family members are themselves in poor health and may not
be able to testify if a new trial were granted.
Assembling the trial and preparing the witnesses was an enormous
and expensive undertaking which would need to be repeated.

The AUSAs

and assigned case agents spent close to one hundred percent of their
28

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 29 of 31 PageID #: 2157

time preparing for trial.
from important matters.

Repeating the exercise diverts resources

Selecting a new jury would be time consuming

and difficult, particularly in light of the defendants’ well
publicized guilty pleas.

The previous jurors made sacrifices in

their personal and professional lives to serve on the jury; their
sacrifice would be wasted and required from yet another group of
citizens.

In addition, Caramadre’s latest attorneys would likely

request additional time to prepare since they would need to learn
the case to prepare for trial.
Most importantly, Caramadre’s victims deserve closure.
pernicious scheme has done enough damage to their lives.

His

He invaded

the sanctity of their most precious moments, the hour of their loved
one’s death.

He was entitled to a fair trial; he received one.

He

ended the trial and pled guilty because it was in his interest to
do so, knowing that he was giving up that right forever.

His victims

should not need to relive the ordeal again so that Caramadre can get
a second bite at the apple.
V. NO NEED FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING
An evidentiary hearing on Caramadre’s Motion to Withdraw His
Guilty Plea is unnecessary because the facts alleged by Caramadre,
even if taken true, would not entitle him to relief.
v. Pulido, 566 F. 3d 52, 57(1st Cir. 2009).

United States

Evidentiary hearings are

not an entitlement; they are the exception, not the rule.
29

Isom, 85

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 130 Filed 03/12/13 Page 30 of 31 PageID #: 2158

F.3d at 838.

There is nothing in the facts submitted by Caramadre

that calls into question his competency to plead guilty.

Nor does

anything in Caramadre’s submission change that fact that he is an
attorney who knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently pled guilty
after negotiating and signing a detailed Statement of facts and Plea
Agreement.
Finally, by claiming ineffective assistance of counsel,
Caramadre waives the attorney client privilege with respect to his
representation by Attorneys Traini, Lepizzera and DeMello.

In the

event the Court does decide to grant an evidentiary hearing, it will
be necessary for the government to interview each of them, which in
turn, requires the permission of the Court.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant Caramadre’s Motion
to Withdraw His Guilty Plea should be denied.
