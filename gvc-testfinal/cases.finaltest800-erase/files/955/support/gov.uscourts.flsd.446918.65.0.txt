UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
MIAMI DIVISION
CASE NO. 14-cv-22991-KMW
ROBERT M. LAWRENCE,
Plaintiff,
v.
BAYVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC,
Defendant.
/
BAYVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC’S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY FINAL JUDGMENT AGAINST ROBERT M. LAWRENCE
I. INTRODUCTION
Robert Lawrence brings a one-count action against Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC
(Bayview) for violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. §
227(b)(1)(A)(iii). The crux of Mr. Lawrence's complaint is that defendant, Bayview Loan
Servicing, LLC (Bayview) placed calls to his cellular telephone1, without his prior express
consent using an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS).

Mr. Lawrence's claim is

misplaced, and seeks to ignore the undisputed fact that he repeatedly gave prior express consent
for Bayview to place those calls to his cellular telephone. Mr. Lawrence first provided his
cellular telephone number on a loan modification application, which fits perfectly within the
definition of prior express consent. He then continued to provide Bayview with his cellular
telephone number in thirty-two (32) separate letters in which he requested Bayview to assist in
resolving a variety of disputes he had with his mortgage loan. Because he provided Bayview

1

Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone number, (916) 715-3295, will be referred to as the
"cellular telephone number" for purposes of this motion.
{36360044;2}

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 2 of 17

with prior express consent to call his cellular telephone number, his TCPA claim fails, and
summary final judgment in Bayview's favor is appropriate.
II. UNDISPUTED FACTS2
Lawrence entered into a mortgage loan with American Brokers Conduit by executing a
note in the amount of $1,000,000.00 and a deed of trust securing the loan on May 21, 2007 (the
Loan). (S.U.F. ¶ 1.) The note was secured by a property located at 891 South Dyer Circle,
Incline Village, Nevada (the Property). (S.U.F. ¶ 1.) Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc. (Saxon)
was responsible for the daily management and administration of the Loan until April 2011.
(S.U.F. ¶ 2.) During this period Saxon was responsible for such tasks as the collection of Mr.
Lawrence's monthly mortgage payments and the review of the Loan for qualification for a loan
modification. (S.U.F. ¶ 2.)
Mr. Lawrence applied and was approved for a loan modification with Saxon. As part of
the loan modification Mr. Lawrence completed and submitted a Saxon Mortgage Financial
Statement. (S.U.F. ¶ 3.) Mr. Lawrence included his cellular telephone number (916) 715-3295
in the Saxon Mortgage Financial Statement. (S.U.F. ¶ 4.) Mr. Lawrence also included his
cellular telephone number in a letter to Saxon dated November 1, 2009. (S.U.F. ¶ 5.)
Bayview assumed the daily management and administration of the Loan, including the
collection of monthly mortgage payments from Mr. Lawrence, on or about April 3, 2011.
(S.U.F. ¶ 6.) Upon the transfer of servicing rights from Saxon to Bayview, all of the documents
contained in Saxon's loan file for Mr. Lawrence, including the Saxon Mortgage Financial
Statement and correspondence dated November 1, 2009, were transferred to Bayview. (S.U.F. ¶
7.) The file Bayview received from Saxon for the Loan was reviewed for accuracy and the

2

Bayview’s Statement of Undisputed Facts (S.U.F.) is filed contemporaneously with this

motion.
{36360044;2}

2

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 3 of 17

documents contained therein, including the Saxon Mortgage Financial Statement and
correspondence dated November 1, 2009, were uploaded into Bayview's records keeping
systems. (S.U.F. ¶ 8.) The information in the documents Bayview received from Saxon for the
Loan, including Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone number, was then used in the daily
management and administration of the Loan. (S.U.F. ¶ 8.)
The only accurate working number belonging to Mr. Lawrence Bayview has ever
possessed, from the time the loan was transferred from Saxon to the present, is the telephone
number (916) 715-3295. (S.U.F. ¶ 9.) Mr. Lawrence's current cellular telephone number, (916)
715-3295, is the first and only cellular telephone number he has ever had. (S.U.F. ¶ 10.) Mr.
Lawrence has had this cellular telephone number for approximately 20 years. (S.U.F. ¶ 10.)
Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone is the only telephone number he possesses. (S.U.F. ¶ 11.)
One of the methods by which Bayview contacts its clients is through use of ATDS calls.
(S.U.F. ¶ 12.) The purpose of each and every ATDS call Bayview places is related to the
management and administration, such as reminding clients a monthly mortgage payment is late
or collecting on a loan in default, each specific mortgage loan for the specific client Bayview is
attempting to contact. (S.U.F. ¶ 13.) Any and all ATDS calls placed to Mr. Lawrence's cellular
telephone for purposes of administration and management of the Loan. (S.U.F. ¶ 14.)
A Bayview representative spoke with Mr. Lawrence as the result of an ATDS call on
three dates, October 5, 2011, June 4, 2012, and July 7, 2012, from the commencement of
Bayview's servicing of Mr. Lawrence's loan to the present. (S.U.F. ¶ 15.) These are the only
instances wherein contact was made with Mr. Lawrence as the result of an ATDS. (S.U.F. ¶ 15.)
The only instances wherein Mr. Lawrence requested Bayview not to call him were verbal
requests which occurred during ATDS calls on the following dates: (1) October 5, 2011; (2) June
4, 2012; and (3) July 7, 2012. (S.U.F. ¶ 16.) Mr. Lawrence does not remember how many times
{36360044;2}

3

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 4 of 17

he verbally requested Bayview to cease calling him. (S.U.F. ¶ 17.) Bayview never received a
written request from Mr. Lawrence asking for Bayview not to call him. (S.U.F. ¶ 18.)
Mr. Lawrence obtained the multiple addresses to which he sent his letters to Bayview
from the mortgage loan statement mailed to him by Bayview and a 1099 form. (S.U.F. ¶ 19.)
Mr. Lawrence never mailed or addressed a letter to a specific department at Bayview because:
(1) Mr. Lawrence believed Bayview was capable of receiving a letter and distributing the letter
to the appropriate department; and (2) Mr. Lawrence does not know the names of the different
departments at Bayview. (S.U.F. ¶ 20.) None of the letters Mr. Lawrence sent to Bayview
included an explicit written limitation on how Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone could be used.
(S.U.F. ¶ 21.)
Mr. Lawrence sent Bayview a letter dated March 25, 2012, including his cellular
telephone number, which Bayview received. (S.U.F. ¶ 22.)
Mr. Lawrence sent Bayview a letter dated May 25, 2012, including his cellular telephone
number, which Bayview received. (S.U.F. ¶ 23.)

number, which Bayview received. (S.U.F. ¶ 24.)

telephone number, which Bayview received. (S.U.F. ¶ 25.)

number, which Bayview received on April 9, 2013. (S.U.F. ¶ 26.)

telephone number, which Bayview received on October 15, 2013. (S.U.F. ¶ 27.)

Mr. Lawrence sent Bayview a letter dated September 1, 2015, including his cellular
telephone number, which Bayview received on September 5, 2015. (S.U.F. ¶ 53.)
Mr. Lawrence's inclusion of his cellular telephone in his letters to Bayview was his
providing of his consent for Bayview to contact him on that cellular telephone in order to resolve
the issues raised in the letter. (S.U.F. ¶ 54.) Mr. Lawrence believes it would be appropriate for
someone who receives a letter with a phone number included in it to use that phone number to
contact the person. (S.U.F. ¶ 55.)
Mr. Lawrence included the contact information for his attorney in the letters bates
stamped "Lawrence RFP_511-518" so that if someone who received the letters wanted to contact
someone involved in this case they could contact Mr. Lawrence's attorney at the address and
telephone number provided in the letter. (S.U.F. ¶ 56.)

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A party may obtain summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is no genuine
dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 56(a). The parties may support their positions by citation to the record, including inter
alia, depositions, documents, affidavits, or declarations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). An issue is
genuine if “a reasonable trier of fact could return judgment for the non-moving party.”
Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, 516 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2008)
(quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986)). A fact is material if it
“might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.” Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S.
at 247-48). The Court views the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and
draws all reasonable inferences in its favor. See Davis v. Williams, 451 F.3d 759, 763 (11th Cir.
2006); Howard v. Steris Corp., 550 F. App’x 748, 750 (11th Cir. 2013) (“The court must view
all evidence most favorably toward the nonmoving party, and all justifiable inferences are to be
drawn in the nonmoving party’s favor.”). However, material facts set forth in the movant’s
statement of facts and supported by record evidence are deemed admitted if not controverted by
the opposing party. S.D.FLA.L.R.56.1(b).

IV. BAYVIEW IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT AS TO NEARLY ALL THE ATDS CALLS
Mr. Lawrence alleges Bayview violated the TCPA by making calls to his cellular
telephone using an ATDS in violation of 47 U.S.C. §227(b)(1)(A)(iii). (FAC3 ¶ 14.) The vast
majority of the alleged ATDS calls are exempt from liability because Mr. Lawrence provided
prior express consent to Bayview to be called on his cellular telephone by an ATDS.4 Mr.
Lawrence provided this prior express consent in two ways: (1) by including his cellular
telephone number on the Saxon loan modification application; and (2) by including his cellular
telephone number in at least 32 letters to Bayview. (S.U.F ¶ 3, 4, 22-53.)
A.

Mr. Lawrence gave prior express consent by including his cellular telephone
number in the Saxon Financial Statement.
"Congress has conferred upon the FCC general authority to make rules and regulations

necessary to carry out the provisions of the TCPA." Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc.,
786 F. 3d 1110, 1117 (11th Cir. 2014).5 The primary guide for interpreting the term "prior
express consent" in the TCPA is the FCC's 2008 Declaratory Ruling. See In re Rules and
Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (2008 FCC Ruling),
23 FCC Rcd. 559, 564. The 2008 FCC Ruling built upon and clarified a prior Report and Order
issued by the FCC in 1992. In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991 (1992 FCC Order ), 7 FCC Rcd. 8752, 8769 n. 57.

3

"FAC" refers to the first amended complaint. (ECF No. 41.)

4

Bayview concedes there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Lawrence
revoked his consent verbally on the phone with Bayview representatives on October 5, 2011,
June 4, 2012, and July 7, 2012. Therefore, Bayview does not seek summary final judgment for
those calls falling between these dates and the subsequent letter received by Bayview from Mr.
Lawrence reinstating his prior express consent for ATDS calls.
5

District courts are bound to follow the interpretations of the TCPA set out by the 2008
FCC Ruling as they lack the jurisdiction to "enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend" it under the
Hobbs Act, 47 U.S.C. §402(a). Mais, 786 F. 3d at 1120.
{36360044;2}

10

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 11 of 17

The FCC's 1992 Order interpreted the TCPA broadly and stated "persons who knowingly
release their phone numbers have in effect given their invitation or permission to be called at the
number which they have given, absent instructions to the contrary." 1992 FCC Order, 7 FCC
Rcd. at 8769. The 2008 FCC Ruling dealt more specifically with the prior express consent given
by a debtor to a creditor and ruled "wireless numbers that are provided by the called party to a
creditor in connection with an existing debt are permissible as calls made with the 'prior express
consent' of the called party." 2008 FCC Ruling, 23 FCC Rcd. at 559.
Mr. Lawrence's inclusion of his cellular telephone number in the Saxon loan modification
application materials falls squarely within the 2008 FCC Ruling's definition of prior express
consent. Id. at 564 ("the provision of a cell phone number to a creditor, e.g., as part of a credit
application, reasonably evidences prior express consent by the cell phone subscriber to be
contacted at that number regarding the debt"). The cellular telephone number was provided by
Mr. Lawrence, the called party. (S.U.F. ¶¶ 4, 5). Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone number was
provided in connection with his existing mortgage loan debt. (S.U.F. ¶¶ 3-5.) Any ATDS calls
which were subsequently placed to Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone by Bayview were placed in
connection with the administration and management of the Loan. (S.U.F. ¶ 14.).
The Eleventh Circuit has embraced a broad interpretation of the 2008 FCC Ruling on
prior express consent. See Mais, 786 F. 3d at 1122 (a debtor provided prior express consent for a
hospital attempting to collect a debt arising from care provided when the debtor's wife included
the debtor's cellular telephone on the hospital intake forms). "While the 2008 FCC Ruling listed
the completion of 'a credit application' as an example of the provision of a cell phone number to
a creditor, the Commission did so illustratively, not exclusively." Id. However, this matter does
not need a broad interpretation, Mr. Lawrence provided his cellular number in an application to

{36360044;2}

11

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 12 of 17

modify the terms of his mortgage loan i.e. the very type of credit application the FCC used as an
example in their 2008 Ruling. 23 FCC Rcd. at 564.
Courts have consistently found prior express consent where a cellular telephone number
is "give[n] . . . 'during the transaction' that involves the debt", just as Mr. Lawrence did with his
loan modification application. Stephen M. Hill v. Homeward Residential, Inc., No. 2:13-cv-388,
2015 WL 4978464 *4 (6th Cir. Aug 21, 2015) (finding prior express consent where a borrower
listed his cellular telephone number on a loan modification application); see also Cherkaoui v.
Santander Consumer USA, Inc., 32 F. Supp. 3d 811, 815 (S.D. Tex. 2014) ("Plaintiff's provision
of his cellphone number of the Credit Application constitutes his prior express consent to be
contacted on that cell phone using an automatic telephone dialing system.").
There is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Lawrence's inclusion of his
cellular telephone number in his loan modification application constituted prior express consent
under the TCPA.

The FCC rulings are clear and the courts have uniformly applied the

interpretation to hold that providing a cellular telephone number such as Mr. Lawrence did
constitutes prior express consent Bayview is entitled to summary final judgment as to liability
for all calls from the time Bayview commenced servicing of Mr. Lawrence's loan until October
5, 2011.6
B.

Mr. Lawrence gave prior express consent by including his cellular telephone
number in each letter sent to Bayview about his mortgage loan.
Mr. Lawrence has provided continuous, systematic prior express consent to call his

cellular telephone throughout his relationship with Bayview. In addition to providing his cellular

6

October 5, 2011 is the first date Bayview concedes there is an issue of material fact as to
whether Mr. Lawrence revoked consent. Prior to this date the facts are clear and undisputed that Mr.
Lawrence never expressed a desire not to be called.
{36360044;2}

12

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 13 of 17

telephone number in the loan modification application, Mr. Lawrence included his cellular
telephone number in at least 32 letters sent to Bayview. (S.U.F. ¶¶ 22-53).
Mr. Lawrence sent Bayview letters in a continuous and systematic manner which not
only meets the definition of prior express consent, but goes beyond that to a level of an
affirmative, express request to be contacted on his cellular telephone number. See id. Courts
that have reviewed the issue have found prior express consent in acts which were far more
passive than Mr. Lawrence's letter writing campaign. See Baird v. Sabre, Inc., et al., 995 F.
Supp. 2d 1100, 1104 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2014) (customer who provided her cellular telephone
number while booking a plane ticket provided prior express consent to receive ATDS calls); see
also Ebling v. Clearspring Loan Services, Inc., 2015 WL 3439161 *3 (D. Minn. April 14, 2015)
(finding express prior consent where plaintiff provided loan servicer with her cellular telephone
number verbally over the telephone); Chavez v. Advantage Group, 959 F. Supp. 2d 1279, (D. Co.
2013) (finding prior express consent for hospital collecting a debt from medical services where
plaintiff provided cellular telephone number in medical intake forms). While one letter including
his cellular telephone number would have been adequate to establish prior express consent, it is
abundantly clear in this situation based on the volume and substance of the multitude of letters
that prior express consent has been established.
Mr. Lawrence cannot sidestep this prior express consent by claiming he only included his
cellular telephone in the letters for use by certain individuals at Bayview. Such an attempt would
fail both legally and factually.
"[A] debtor does not need to give his consent to automated calls specifically; his general
consent to being called on a cellphone constitutes 'prior express consent'." The Eleventh Circuit
has directly ruled on the topic of whether specific consent for ATDS calls must be provided in
order to qualify as prior express consent. A recent opinion conducted a detailed analysis of prior
{36360044;2}

13

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 14 of 17

express consent and did not state that a party's consent must be to receiving auto-dialed, as
opposed to manual calls. Osorio v. State Farm Bank, FSB, 746 F. 3d 1242 (11th Cir. 2014).
Judge Middlebrooks recently viewed the Eleventh Circuit's failure to include such a distinction
between consent for manual calls and consent for ATDS calls as implicit agreement with "the
great weight of authority which has found that providing a cell phone number constitutes consent
to be called, whether manually or by auto-dial." Reed v. Morgan Drexen, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 3d
1287, 1295 (S.D. Fla. 2014).
While there are some courts7 which have held consent must be specifically provided for
ATDS, this view, as Judge Middlebrooks observed, is the minority. See Baisden v. Credit
Adjustments, Inc., No. 2:13-cv-992, 2015 WL 1046186 at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 10, 2015) (a debtor
who knowingly provides his cellular telephone number "is agreeing to allow the creditor to
contact him regarding his debt, regardless of the means"); Ebling v. Clearspring Loan Services,
Inc., 2015 WL 3439161 *2 (D. Minn. April 14, 2015) (quoting Baisden); Ranwick v. Texas Gila,
LLC, 37 F. Supp. 3d 1053, 1057-58 (D. Minn. Aug. 7, 2014) ("The thrust of the FCC's Rulings is
that a person need not specifically consent to be contacted using an autodialer or artificial or
prerecorded voice."); Steinhoff v. Star Tribune Media Co., Civ. No. 13-1750, 2014 WL 1207804
at *3 (D. Minn. Mar. 24, 2014) (absent specific instructions, providing a cellular telephone
number establishes prior express consent to be called by an ATDS).
The facts in this matter mirror a recent Sixth Circuit opinion finding the general provision
of a cellular telephone number in a loan modification application to be adequate prior express for

Edeh v. Midland Credit Management, Inc., 748 F. Supp. 2d 1030, 1038 (D. Minn. 2010)
(explicit consent is required for ATDS calls); Saunders v. NCO Financial Systems, Inc., 910 F.
Supp. 2d 464, 467 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2012) ("voluntarily furnishing a cellphone number to a
vendor or other contractual counterparty constitutes express consent"); Thrasher-Lyon v. CCS
Commercial, LLC, No. 11 C 4473, 2012 WL 3835089, at *2-3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 4, 2012) ("[T]he
consumer must give 'prior express consent' to robocalls – not to telephone calls in general.").

the mortgage loan servicer to place ATDS calls to the borrower in the course of collecting on the
debt. See Stephen M. Hill, 2015 WL 4978464 at *5 ("[A] debtor does not need to give his
consent to automated calls specifically; his general consent to being called on a cellphone
constitutes 'prior express consent'.").
Mr. Lawrence's contention that his cellular telephone number in the letters was only
meant for certain individuals at Bayview, and not general use, faces an overwhelming tide of
contrary facts. Nearly every single letter was addressed to Bayview Loan Servicing, not a
specific person or department, at Bayview's general address. (S.U.F. ¶¶ 22-27; 29; 33; 35;-37;
40-53; 58-62.)

When Mr. Lawrence wanted to contact a specific Bayview employee, he

addressed his letters to that person. (S.U.F. ¶¶ 28, 30-32; 34; 38-39.) Mr. Lawrence never made
any attempt to obtain a specific address or facsimile number for any specific person or
department.

(S.U.F. ¶ 20.)

His cellular telephone number was continuously included in

correspondence on topics as general as the tendering of monthly payments. (S.U.F. ¶ 41-53.) As
for the letters which were focused on specific topics, Mr. Lawrence admits he was providing his
cellular telephone number for use by any Bayview employee capable of aiding him. (S.U.F. ¶
54.)

Even Mr. Lawrence had to admit it is reasonable to assume one may use a telephone

number when provided in correspondence in the manner in which he repeatedly gave his cellular
telephone number. (S.U.F. ¶ 55.)
Mr. Lawrence's cellular telephone number was the only telephone number Bayview has
ever had in Mr. Lawrence's loan file. (S.U.F. ¶ 9.) It is the only telephone number Mr.
Lawrence currently possesses. (S.U.F. ¶ 11.) It is the first and only cellular telephone number
Mr. Lawrence has ever had, having used it for approximately 20 years. (S.U.F. ¶ 10) Mr.
Lawrence's claims that Bayview was not permitted to contact him on his cellular telephone are

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 65 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/15/2015 Page 16 of 17

bordering on disingenuous when it was the only telephone number by which Bayview could
possible reach him.
V. CONCLUSION
For years, Mr. Lawrence admittedly sent letter after letter requesting communication with
Bayview on his loan account, and expressly inviting and consenting to Bayview calling him on
his cellular telephone. Now he seeks statutory damages for the very calls he requested. Bayview
is entitled to summary final judgment on all ATDS calls placed from the time Bayview began
servicing Mr. Lawrence's loan until October 5, 2011. Bayview is also entitled to summary final
judgment on all calls falling after Bayview's receipt, on April 9, 2013, of Mr. Lawrence's letter
dated April 1, 2013 which included in it his cellular telephone number.
