UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO.: 1:14-CV-22991-KMW
ROBERT M. LAWRENCE,
Plaintiff,
vs.
BAYVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC,
Defendant.
________________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
FINAL JUDGMENT AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
There can be no doubt that the Federal Communications Commission1 (“FCC”)
contemplated a scenario where a consumer provides his cellular telephone number to the caller—
yet—said provision does not constitute express consent. After all, the FCC could not be more
clear on this point by including the words “absent instructions to the contrary” nearly every time
it has addressed this issue. Well, as it turns out, it is undisputed that Mr. Lawrence did give
instructions to the contrary.
As is to be expected with cross-motions for summary judgment—the Parties do not
disagree much on the facts and Plaintiff hereby incorporates his memorandum of law from his
own Motion for Summary Judgement. [D.E. 67]. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (“Bayview”)
essentially makes two points in support of its Motion for Summary Final Judgment (“the
Motion”). First, that Mr. Lawrence provided his express consent to be called on his cellular
telephone by an automatic dialing system (“ATDS”) by supplying his number on a loan
1

“Congress has conferred upon the FCC general authority to make rules and regulations necessary to carry out the
provisions of the TCPA.” Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc., 768 F.3d 1110, 1117 (11th Cir. 2014). The
Court is bound by the FCC’s rulings as the Hobbs Act, “expressly confers on the federal courts of appeals
“exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of” such FCC
orders.” See Mais, at 1119-1120 (internal citations omitted).

modification agreement, and second, that Mr. Lawrence’s provision of his number on subsequent
letters was also his express consent. Mr. Lawrence does not take issue with the former for
purposes of this response but takes great exception to the latter. Bayview has conveniently left in
the shadows the five crucial words Mr. Lawrence’s motion for summary judgement is based
upon—“absent instructions to the contrary”.
It is undisputed that Mr. Lawrence revoked any consent he may have given Bayview to
auto-dial his cellular telephone. Not once, not twice, but at least three different times. And
Bayview understood exactly what Mr. Lawrence said, but chose to ignore it. Mr. Lawrence’s
request to have the calls cease was seen by Bayview’s agents at least dozens upon dozens of
times. In fact, whenever any Bayview employee would look up Mr. Lawrence’s file, one of the
first things they would see was a “standout message” which since 2011 stated that Mr. Lawrence
had asked that Bayview stop calling him. Yet, Bayview failed to stop auto-dialing Mr.
Lawrence’s cellular telephone at least 280 times.
a. Mr. Lawrence Revoked his Express Consent
The TCPA exempts from liability calls made to a cell phone “made with the prior express
consent of the called party.” 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A). As early as 1992, the FCC held that
“persons who knowingly release their phone numbers have in effect given their invitation or
permission to be called at the number which they have given, absent instructions to the contrary."
1992 FCC Order, 7 FCC Rcd. at 8769. Of course, providing a number is not express consent to
be called via an ATDS as that is the definition of implied consent. However, the FCC has in
effect turned implied consent into express consent. Mr. Lawrence does not argue that provision
of his number on his loan modification agreement would be considered express consent.
However, the point Mr. Lawrence is making is that once revocation occurs, the stakes

2

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2015 Page 3 of 9

change. Revocation must mean something and cannot be looked upon in a vacuum. For purposes
of this Response, this principal shall be referred to as the “Renunciation Doctrine”. After all, the
FCC knew that there would be times where a consumer wanted to receive calls from a company
but not want to receive auto-dialed calls. This is exactly why the FCC added in the five words—
“absent instructions to the contrary”. This is exactly what happened here. Mr. Lawrence had
some serious issues with Bayview’s handling of his loan that he was trying to remedy. Again,
Mr. Lawrence is not arguing that his listing of his number would not be express consent under
normal circumstances. However, this is not normal circumstances. Here, Mr. Lawrence expressly
revoked consent. Once he expressly revoked his consent, the Renunciation Doctrine kicks in.
This logic is consistent with Eleventh Circuit law. “[C]onsent is terminated when the
actor knows or has reason to know that the other is no longer willing for him to continue the
particular conduct.” Osorio v. State Farm Bank, FSB, 746 F. 3d 1242, 1253 (2014) quoting
Gager v. Dell Fin. Servs., LLC, 727 F. 3d 265, 270-71 (3rd Cir. 2013).
To be fair, Bayview’s argument would be much more compelling if it had relied upon
Mr. Lawrence’s provision of his phone number on the 32 purported occasions cited in the
Motion. If Bayview had honored Mr. Lawrence’s repeated revocations, removed his number and
then added it back after Bayview received a letter contained the number, there could be a goodfaith policy argument. This is simply not the case. Bayview did not honor Mr. Lawrence’s
revocation. Bayview ignored a do-not-call flag dozen upon dozen of times. Bayview did not rely
on Mr. Lawrence’s provision of his number to Bayview in any way2.
It is undisputed that Mr. Lawrence revoked his consent at least 3 times. See Bayview’s
Statement of Undisputed Facts, ¶19 [D.E. 64-1] (“SOUF”). In fact, one of Bayview’s agents—

3

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2015 Page 4 of 9

David Vaughan—sent an e-mail to his supervisor regarding the do not call flag. SOMF, ¶9.
Conveniently for Bayview, that e-mail has since been destroyed. SOMF, ¶10. Moreover,
Bayview cannot argue that the subsequent letters overcome the Renunciation Doctrine because
Mr. Lawrence expressly revoked his consent even after sending Bayview a letter containing his
phone number. Even according to Bayview, Mr. Lawrence revoked his consent on October 5,
2011, June 4, 2012, and July 7, 2012. SOUF, ¶16.
Following the first undisputed revocation on October 5, 2011, the first time Bayview
claims Mr. Lawrence provided his number on a letter was on March 25, 2012. SOUF, ¶22. Mr.
Lawrence revoked his consent two times after that, on June 4, 2012, and July 7, 2012. Those two
revocations are clearly “instructions to the contrary”. The next time Bayview claims Mr.
Lawrence provided his number on a letter was on May 25, 2012. SOUF, ¶23. Mr. Lawrence
revoked his consent two times after that, on June 4, 2012, and July 7, 2012. Those two
revocations are clearly “instructions to the contrary”.
The next time Bayview claims Mr. Lawrence provided his number on a letter was on
June 30, 2012. SOUF, ¶24. Mr. Lawrence revoked his consent after that on July 7, 2012. This
revocation confirmed Mr. Lawrence’s “instructions to the contrary”. Again, it is undisputed that
Bayview did not rely on Mr. Lawrence’s provision of his number in the subsequent letters. That
is merely being used as an excuse now. Bayview simply cannot overcome the Renunciation
Doctrine. Bayview continued calling Mr. Lawrence via an ATDS despite being keenly aware
that he had revoked his consent.
According to Bayview’s own representative, every call that was placed to Mr. Lawrence
that was a progressive call would have contained the “standout message” stating that Mr.
Lawrence did not want to be called. SOMF, ¶19. As long as the “standout message” was in
4

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2015 Page 5 of 9

place, every loan counselor or customer service representative that called Mr. Lawrence would
have known that Mr. Lawrence didn't want to be called on his cell phone. SOMF, ¶19. According
to servicing notes for Mr. Lawrence’s loan3, a progressive call was placed on December 6, 2012.
[D.E. 63-2 at 34]. Thus, even as late as December 6, 2012, a Bayview agent was still seeing the
standout message stating that Mr. Lawrence did not wish to be called.
Mr. Lawrence maintains that the testimony in this matter demonstrates that every time a
call was transferred to an agent, the agent saw the do-not-call flag in the system and ignored it.
SOMF, ¶ 20. For example, on October 26, 2013 at 13:35, [D.E. 63-2 at 79] when a Bayview
agent left a message for Mr. Lawrence, that agent would have seen the standout screen with the
do-not-call flag, just as Mark Bernstein did. SOMF, ¶¶12, 18. Same thing on November 26, 2013
at 15:42. [D.E. 63-2 at 88]. Yet, in the month of November 2013, Bayview placed at least 25
calls to Mr. Lawrence’s cellular telephone and at least 41 calls in December 2013. At the very
least, whether every call raised the do-not-call flag is a question of material fact.
b. Mr. Lawrence properly Revoked Consent Numerous Times
While Mr. Lawrence maintains that it is crystal clear that the subsequent letters do not
constitute express consent, at the very least there remains a genuine question of material fact as
to whether Mr. :Lawrence’s revocation was reasonable. In footnote 233 of the FCC’s 2015
Order4, the FCC advised that “[w]hen assessing whether any particular means of revocation used
by a consumer was reasonable, we will look to the totality of the facts and circumstances
surrounding that specific situation”. Further, the FCC cited with approval the Third Circuit’s
holding that “in light of the TCPA’s purpose, any silence in the statute as to the right of
3

In support of its Motion, Bayview filed the affidavit of Vanessa Maestu. [D.E. 63-1]. Attached to the affidavit as
Exhibit A was the servicing notes for Mr. Lawrence’s loan. [D.E. 63-2].

In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the TCPA of 1991, Declaratory Ruling and Order, CG Docket No. 02–

5

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2015 Page 6 of 9

revocation should be construed in favor of consumers”. Order at fn. 248, citing Gager, 727 F.3d
265, 270 (3d Cir. 2013).
“The FCC concluded that, with respect to the issue of revocation of consent, “the most
reasonable interpretation of consent is to allow consumers to revoke consent if they decide they
no longer wish to receive voice calls or texts ... [t]his gives consent its most appropriate meaning
within the consumer-protection goals of the TCPA.”.” Morris v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC,
2015 WL 5072011, at *3 (S.D. Fla. 2015)(citing the 2015 FCC Order). Therefore, whether the
Mr. Lawrence’s method of revocation was reasonable becomes a question of fact to be
determined by a jury.
It is well-established that issues related to reasonableness are ones of fact which must be
resolved by a jury as they are not susceptible to being summarily adjudicated as a matter of law.
Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U.S. v. Studenic, 77 F.3d 412, 416 (11th Cir. 1996). Determining
whether one’s conduct was reasonable is typically assessed by a jury within the context of the
evidence presented. Gauck v. Meleski, 346 F.2d 433, 437 (5th Cir.1965); Gaisser v. Portfolio
Recovery Associates, LLC, 593 F. Supp. 2d 1297, 1301 (S.D. Fla. 2009); Ramirez v. Palisades
Collection LLC, 2008 WL 2512679, at *6 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (question of reasonableness of debt
collector's screening procedures regarding determination of applicable statute of limitations is an
issue of fact for jury); Niven v. National Action Financial Services, Inc., Case No. 07–cv–1326,
2008 WL 4190961, at *3 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (“Defendant's intent and whether the error was bona
fide are classic issues of fact, inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment.”).
Again, it is undisputed that Bayview did not rely on any of Mr. Lawrence’s letters
addressed to Bayview for express consent. SOMF, at ¶22. Bayview never stopped calling Mr.
Lawrence despite his multiple revocations, never removed his number despite his multiple
6

Case 1:14-cv-22991-KMW Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2015 Page 7 of 9

revocations, and took no action in any way to adhere to Mr. Lawrence’s multiple revocations.
Likewise, Bayview did not add Mr. Lawrence’s number to the account once he provided it on the
letters and Bayview is only looking back now and trying to take advantage of the letters although
the letters were of no benefit at the time to Bayview’s belief that Mr. Lawrence had consented to
be called. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of the times Mr. Lawrence provided his phone
number it was merely on a letterhead he had created that contained his address, telephone
number and e-mail address.
Moreover, it is undisputed that even after Bayview received letters with Mr. Lawrence’s
phone number; the “standout message” that popped up when Mr. Lawrence’s account was
accessed clearly stated that he did not want to receive any more calls. This message was seen
dozens of times, yet ignored. SOMF, at ¶¶ 19, 20. Even an e-mail to a supervisor regarding the
revocation went unheeded. SOMF, at ¶¶ 9, 10.
Bayview even continued calling Mr. Lawrence months after being served with the instant
TCPA lawsuit. Why? Because Mr. Lawrence included his number on a letterhead that
accompanied his monthly mortgage payment. Bayview claims that provision gave them the right
to call Mr. Lawrence via an ATDS despite the numerous revocations and despite the filing of the
instant action. If filing a lawsuit under the TCPA does not evidence a desire not to be called by
an ATDS—there is little could.
What is clear is that Bayview decided to just ignore Mr. Lawrence and the law. Bayview
should not be allowed to conjure up some theory about numbers on a letter template that were
completely meaningless to Bayview prior to the institution of this action.
c. It is Conclusively Established that Mr. Lawrence did not Provide his
Telephone Number to Bayview
Mr. Lawrence hereby incorporates by reference Section II(d) of his own Motion
