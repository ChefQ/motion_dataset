Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00279-RCL

Honorable Royce C. Lamberth
JUDICIAL WATCH, INC., ET AL.

DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR STATUS CONFERENCE
Defendants Judicial Watch, Inc. and Paul Orfanedes, by undersigned counsel and pursuant to
LCvR 7, hereby oppose the Plaintiff’s Motion for Status Conference. As grounds for this
Opposition, Defendants state as follows:
1.

Before conducting any discovery, even before this Court enters a Scheduling Order,

Plaintiff Peter Paul (“Paul”) requests that the Court hold a Status Conference to “address appropriate
interim means that Mr. Paul can obtain funds from Defendants”. Defendants submit that this request
is premature, improperly made through Judicial Watch’s former General Counsel, and unsupported
by fact or law.
2.

Unless Plaintiff’s counsel, Larry E. Klayman, agrees to withdraw as counsel for

Plaintiff, Defendants intend to move for disqualification. Accordingly, this Court should postpone
conducting any status conference or entering any scheduling order until after the question of
disqualification is resolved. The basis for Defendants’ intent to move for disqualification is based
on ethical obligations owed by Klayman to Judicial Watch that arise from Klayman’s prior position
as General Counsel of Judicial Watch while it represented Paul. Therefore, Klayman is a necessary

fact witness. Equally important is that fact that Klayman possesses confidential information
regarding Judicial Watch, which cannot be protected if he acts as counsel to Paul.
3.

While Judicial Watch categorically denies the allegations made by Paul in his Motion

for Status Conference, the fact that such allegations are included in a pleadings signed by Judicial
Watch’s former General Counsel highlights the prejudice that may result to Judicial Watch if
Klayman is permitted to continue with his willful breach of fiduciary duty.
4.

Finally, Paul’s request is premature. In essence, Paul’s ambiguous request does not

articulate any procedure authorizing this Court to invoke the extraordinary remedy of transferring
funds from Judicial Watch to Plaintiff without a trial. Paul seeks a remedy without conducting any
discovery or presenting his case to the fact-finder. More importantly, Defendants will demonstrate
that Paul’s claims are unfounded and lack any basis in fact. Accordingly, Defendants object to any
process that circumvents the normal right of a litigant to due process.
WHEREFORE, for all of the forgoing reasons, Defendants Judicial Watch, Inc. and Paul
Orfanedes respectfully requests that the Court DENY the Motion for Status Conference and
postpone any further proceedings until there is a resolution of the disqualification issue.
Respectfully submitted,
