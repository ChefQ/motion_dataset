IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

PETER PAUL, et al.,
Plaintiffs,
Civil Action No. 1:07–CV-00279-RCL
Honorable Royce C. Lamberth

v.
JUDICIAL WATCH, INC., et al.,
Defandants.

MOTION FOR STATUS CONFERENCE
Plaintiff, Peter Paul, respectfully requests a status conference with the Court. Mr.
Paul has been under house arrest for many years, following his abandonment by
Defendants, and counsel would like to address with the court appropriate interim means
that Mr. Paul can obtain funds from Defendants, as they had agreed to provide, to obtain
legal representation in order that he can retain criminal defense counsel that can take
appropriate steps to complete his sentencing and obtain his release from government
custody in order that his Constitution right to counsel can be exercised.
Mr. Paul had retained Judicial Watch to defend him in criminal proceedings that
involve Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, as he had contributed about $2 million dollars in
campaign contributions to the 2000 Senate campaign of the former First Lady. Judicial
Watch is holding funds that were to be used for Mr. Paul’s criminal defense, as a
fiduciary.
