Case No. 5:16-CV-155-FL
UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.,
.Plaintiff,

v.
ROBERT ZIMMERMAN,
Defendant.
MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW TO DISMISS COMPLAINT BASED
ON
LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER AND/OR PERSONAL JURISDICTION

PlajntiffUBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial"), a long-standing member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), has asked this Honorable Court for a
Preliminary Injunction to prevent Defendant Robert Zimmerman ("Zimmerman") from
arbitrating a claim he has lodged against UBS Financial with FINRA. FINRA was
authorized under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to resolve disputes between all
firms engaged in the securities industry and small investors who typically cannot afford
lengthy litigation in state or federal courts. FINRA is to broker/customer relations what
the FDIC is to bank/customer r~lations.
With its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiff is engaged in flagrant and
frivolous forum shopping. It does so because it fears the results of arbitration in the
FINRA forum and seeks to bully a relatively defenseless adversary into submission by
substituting a federal lawsuit, which it knows the Defendant cannot afford, for what is
typically an inexpensive arbitration hearing.

Case 5:16-cv-00155-FL Document 14 Filed 05/04/16 Page 1 of 6

The sole basis for Plaintiff' pursuit of a Preliminary Injunction to bar Zimmerman from
arbitrating his dispute with Plaintiff is that Zimmerman was not a customer of the
Plaintiff because Zimmerman purchased Plaintiffs' securities that are the subject of the
FINRA dispute not directly from the Plaintiff, but from a firm Plaintiff uses to market its
securities.

Over the years, FINRA has resolved thousands of disputes between FINRA's member

firms and the public. Moreover, the Director ofFINRA has already Denied PlaintiffUBS
Financials' request to abstain from the arbitration of Zimmerman's claim. (See Exhibit
A). FINRA has ruled that it considers Zimmerman to be a UBS Financial "customer," as
that term of art is defined by FINRA Rule 12200.

In addition to its own staff call its employers; securities "crap and vomit", in its·
Prospectus and related documents PlaintiffUBS Financial calls its securities "products"
(see Exhibit B), and whether or not Zimmerman purchased those products directly or
indirectly from the Plaintiff, Defendant Zimmerman is just as much a customer ofUBS
Financial as he would be a customer of General Motors if he had bought a vehicle from
one of its dealers or any other third party.

In addition to those jurisdictional issues this Court may raise, there are provided below
several jurisdictional issues for this Honorable Court to consider when considering
whether or not to Dismiss Plaintiff's pursuit of a Preliminary Injunction barring
Defendant from arbitrating his dispute with UBS Financial in the FINRA forum.

Case 5:16-cv-00155-FL Document 14 Filed 05/04/16 Page 2 of 6

1. A federal court always has the authority to determine whether it has the
jurisdiction to hear a particular case. United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622m 628
(2002) (citing United States v. Mine Workers ofAm, 330 U.S. 258,291 (1947).
Moreover, it is presumed that a cause lies outside of the jurisdiction of the federal
courts, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests with the party asserting
jurisdiction. Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. OfAm., 511 U.S. 375,377 (1994).
See also Wright & Miller§ 3522, pp. 103-05 "There is a presumption that a
federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and the party seeking to invoke
federal jurisdiction must affirmatively allege the facts supporting it."
2. Plaintiff is invoking a preemptive federal defense as the basis of Plaintiff's
Complaint. The declaratory-judgment seeking plaintiff should not be able to file a
complaint that anticipates a federal defense of the coercive action. Ne. Rl Reg'l

Commuter R.R. Corp. v. Hoey Farina & Downes, 212 F.3d 1010, 1014 (7th Cir.
2000). "If the plaintiff cannot get into federal court by anticipating what amounts
to a federal offense to a state-law cause of action, he should also not be able to use
the Declaratory Judgment Act to do so by asserting what is really a preemptive
federal defense as the basis of his complaint." , it is well established that, in a
declaratory judgment action, federal jurisdiction does not lie, 'if but for the
availability of the declaratory judgment procedure, the federal claim would arise
only as a defense to a state created action." City ofRome, N.Y. v. Verizon

Communications 362 F.3d 168, 182 (2nd Cir. 2004) (quoting Franchise Tax Bd,
463 U.S.at 16.) See also, Republican Party ofGuam v. Gutierrez, 277 F.3d 1086

Case 5:16-cv-00155-FL Document 14 Filed 05/04/16 Page 3 of 6

(9th Cir. 2002) (discussing well-pleaded complaint rule and declaratory
judgments.)
3. Federal jurisdiction is lacking because FINRA an unnamed party that is
indispensable to the proceeding and its position on the issue in dispute must be
considered. Rule 19(a) requires a court to join a party that is necessary to accord
complete relief among the existing parties. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(l). Plaintiff has
admitted that FINRA has Denied its request to abstain from arbitrating the
Defendants' dispute with Plaintiff, and is thus a necessary party to Plaintiff's
pursuit of relief form FINRAs' ruling.
4. As there is no amount in controversy in this Honorable Court, Plaintiff has failed
to qualify for federal jurisdiction because the Defendant has offered to settle his
dispute in the FINRA forum with Plaintiff for a sum less than the $75,000
required by 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Moreover, UBS Financial has entirely failed to
raise a substantial issue of federal jurisdiction or any other substantial issue. UBS
Financial has no substantial connection to North Carolina because it is not a North
Carolina corporation and Zimmerman's dispute with UBS Financial was brought
and is being managed by FINRA from its headquarters in New York City. Thus
UBS Financials' efforts to bar the arbitration of Zimmerman's Claim are
misconceived and misplaced. IfUBS Financial truly seeks to bar arbitration of
Zimmerman's Claim, it should seek an injunction against FINRA in New York
and not against Zimmerman in North Carolina.
5. Plaintiff has, as yet, failed to serve its Summons and Complaint on the Defendant
and has submitted zero proof of such service.

Case 5:16-cv-00155-FL Document 14 Filed 05/04/16 Page 4 of 6

WHEREFORE Defendant requests this Honorable Court to Grant his Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiffs Complaint, or should this Honorable Court decide to allow UBS Financial to
pursue its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction barring Zimmerman from arbitrating his
dispute with UBS Financial, then Zimmerman, a 75-year-old living on Social Security
and modest savings, respectfully requests an extension of time of four months, the same
amount of time UBS Financial has had to construct its Motion for a Preliminary
Injunction, to answer the Complaint and, if this Honorable Court is so willing, for this
Court to appoint Pro Bono counsel to represent the Defendant in this matter.
