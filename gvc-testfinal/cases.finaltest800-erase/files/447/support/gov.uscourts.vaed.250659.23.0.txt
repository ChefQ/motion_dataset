Civil Action No. 1:10cv112

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
Plaintiff, Teresa L. Pennington, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37
and Local Rule 37 files her motion for sanctions against Defendant Midland Credit
Management for failure to comply with the court’s discovery orders and states as follows:
1. On June 11, 2010, the court heard argument regarding the Plaintiff’s motion to
compel.

The court went through the discovery responses and clearly identified to

defendant which responses were insufficient and how the responses must be
supplemented no later than close of business June 16, 2010. The court had previously
warned defendant of the possibility of sanctions for non compliance, and it warned the
defendant again during the hearing.
2. By the close of business June 16, 2010, defendant had not complied with the
court’s order.

Counsel for Plaintiff had waited for the responses after telephoning

counsel for defendant. However, the wait was in vain as the response would not come
until the following morning.
3. After reviewing the documents, counsel for Plaintiff contacted counsel for
Defendant on the morning of June 18, 2010 in an effort to meet and confer over the

continuing deficiencies, net worth information that had not been produced, and the
improper use of Rule 33(d) in responses to interrogatories. Counsel for Defendant
indicated it would supplement some of the responses by close of business on Monday
June 21, 2010 and would not supplement other items.
4. As of the time of filing this motion, no supplementation has been received.
5. For the reasons stated in the memorandum in support of this motion that more
fully describes the deficiencies in the responses, Plaintiff requests that the court sanction
defendant for its behavior. Plaintiff incorporates his memorandum in support hereto.

CERTIFICATION
I, A. Hugo Blankingship, III certify that I contacted counsel for the Defendant John
Lynch via the telephone on June 18, 2010 in an effort to narrow these issues. I had
follow-up conversations with counsel for the Defendant regarding the failure to comply
with the court’s order. Nothing further could be achieved by discussing the matter with
opposing counsel. Plaintiff believes that it has complied with requirements of both Local
Civil Rule 7(E), 37(E), and paragraph ten of the court’s scheduling order.
WHEREFORE Plaintiff requests that the court enter an order that sanctions the
Defendant granting the Plaintiff the relief requested in the memorandum in support and
all such further relief that the court deems just and proper.
