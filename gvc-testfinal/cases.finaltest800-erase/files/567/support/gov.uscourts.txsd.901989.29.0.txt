CASE NO. 2:11-cv-226

DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant John McHugh, Secretary of the Department of the Army, respectfully
moves to dismiss this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff is presently running for Congress in the 34th District of Texas. He was
removed from his employment as an Industrial Engineer at the Corpus Christi Army Depot
for insubordination, discourtesy towards a supervisor, and making a false statement.
He claims that the Army’s disciplinary actions, including two suspensions and his
removal, and his non-selection for a supervisory position, were motivated by animus toward
his race/color (Black) and national origin (African-American), and in retaliation for
participation in prior protected activity.
The claims related to his five-day suspension should be dismissed for his failure to
timely exhaust his administrative remedies by initiating contact with an agency EEO
counselor within 45 days of the challenged action. Even if the five-day suspension survives
dismissal, this Court should grant summary judgment to the Army on it and his other claims.

His discriminatory discipline claims fail because he cannot identify similarly situated
comparators outside his protected class who were treated more favorably. His retaliation
claims based upon the five-day suspension and his non-selection fail because there is no
evidence that he participated in prior activity protected under Title VII at the time of the
actions. His retaliation claims related to his fourteen-day suspension and his termination fail
because he cannot show the requisite causal connection between his protected activity and
the challenged actions. In the alternative, all of his claims fail as a matter of law because he
cannot rebut the Army's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions.

II. UNDISPUTED FACTS
A.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff was employed as an Industrial Engineer at the Red River Army Depot from

February 1985 to November 1989. In 1989, his employment with the Red River Army Depot
was terminated for threatening a supervisor and making false, malicious statements against
coworkers and supervisors. Ex. B, 8:9-10). He apparently did not disclose that information
to CCAD personnel during the hiring process.
Plaintiff was employed at CCAD in November 2001 as an Industrial Engineer,
GS-0896-12, in the Industrial Engineering Division (“IED”) within the Directorate of
Engineering Services.
Ron Howe (Caucasian) was the Acting IED Chief, and Plaintiff’s first-line supervisor
from January 18, 2009, until Gary Hogg (Caucasian) reported for duty as the new IED Chief.
At all times relevant, Plaintiff’s second-line supervisor was Kresten Cook (Caucasian),
Director, Directorate of Engineering Services.

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 3 of 29

On February 13, 2009, July 16, 2009, and August 6, 2009, Plaintiff requested that the
Inspector General investigate the Directorate of Engineering Services and its personnel for
alleged improper management practices and contract fraud, and his allegation that Kresten
Cook improperly used the insignia of a Professional Engineer. None of these requests
alleged discrimination or retaliation. (Ex. D)
Howe, as the Acting IED Chief, scheduled a meeting between Plaintiff and a
coworker to address an issue Plaintiff had with the coworker. (Ex. A, 190:25-191:8) At the
appointed time, Plaintiff stuck his head in Howe’s office where Howe and the coworker were
waiting, walked in the doorway, looked around, and then turned around and left, without a
word. (Id. at 191:9-14.) When Howe went to Plaintiff’s office to discuss the matter, Plaintiff
became upset and called security, accusing Howe of harassing him. (Id. at 192:6-20.)

B.

5-DAY SUSPENSION - CABINET INCIDENT
On March 26, 2009, during the home team meeting, Howe authorized personnel from

a contractor, Knowledge-Based Systems, Inc. (“KBSI”), to move three KBSI filing cabinets
to accommodate additional contractor personnel. (Ex. E, 6:13-7:7.) The three cabinets were
moved into the office Plaintiff shared with another engineer, Eric Lundgren, and placed next
to Lundgren’s desk. They did not obstruct Plaintiff’s access to his desk or inhibit his ability
to perform his job duties. (Ex. B, 18:9-25.)
Coworkers reported to Mr. Howe that Plaintiff appeared agitated that the cabinets
were moved into his office without being coordinated through him. (Ex. E, 7:10-18; Ex. F.)

3

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 4 of 29

Coworkers also reported that Plaintiff was loud and yelled when questioning coworkers
about who authorized placing the cabinets in his office. (Ex. A, 243:21-244:7; Ex. F.)
Judith Ballard (White), IED Administrative Support Assistant, directed Plaintiff to
speak to Mr. Howe about the filing cabinet placement. (Ex. B, 20:15-20.) Plaintiff did not
speak to Mr. Howe. (Id. at 21:8-13.) Instead, he returned to his office and removed the files
from the first cabinet in order to move it out of his office. (Id. at 16:22-24, 18:14-19.)
Coworkers also submitted statements that they witnessed Plaintiff pull files out of the
cabinets and put them on an adjoining table where they spilled over onto the floor in disarray.
(Ex. F; Ex. A, 103:2-9; Ex. E, Tr. 7:21-8:2.)
Plaintiff’s office mate, Eric Lundgren, notified Ballard that Plaintiff was removing
files from the cabinets in order to move the cabinets out of the office. (Ex. E, 53:9-12.)
Ballard went to Plaintiff’s office to try to calm him down. (Ex. B, 21:2-6.) She informed
him that she directed the file cabinet move. (Id. at 21:5-7.) Coworkers reported to Howe that
they witnessed Plaintiff loudly tell Ballard that she had no right to change his office space
and push her back as he closed the door in her face. (Ex. A, 103:10-21; Ex. E, 8:3-10.)
On June 5, 2009, Howe proposed that the Army impose a 14-day suspension on
Plaintiff for creating a disturbance and for discourtesy related to the March 26 incident. (Ex.
B, 23:14-18; Ex. G.) Nora Ortiz, Management Employee Relations Specialist, CCAD
Civilian Personnel Advisory Center (“CPAC”), requested security presence when Howe
notified Plaintiff of the proposed suspension. (Ex. A, 60:1-18, 274:7-9.)

4

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 5 of 29

On July 24, 2009, Cook, the deciding official for the suspension, notified Plaintiff
of his decision to reduce Howe’s proposal to a 5-days’ suspension. (Ex. H.) Plaintiff served
his suspension July 27-31, 2009, and he returned to the workplace on August 3, 2009. (Id.)
On August 27, 2009, the Assistant Deputy Commander for Maintenance Operations denied
Plaintiff’s request for reduction of the 5-day suspension, finding Cook’s decision proper.
(Ex. I.)

C.

NON-SELECTION
On January 23, 2009, the Army issued two vacancy announcements (internal and

external) for a Supervisory Industrial Engineer (“IED Chief”) position. No applicants were
interviewed or selected under these announcements. The vacancy announcement was
subsequently amended to require one year of supervisory experience and reposted. (Ex. J,
50:8-51:1.) The Army convened a three member panel to make the selection. Kresten Cook
was the selecting official and panel chairperson. (Id. at 57:20-20, 58:3.) He chose Marc
Gonzales (Hispanic), Chief, Equipment Engineering and Management Division, and Luis
Salinas (Hispanic) Chief, Facilities Management Division, as panel members. (Id. at 58:3-4,
66:3-8, 98:18-19, 118:20-21.)
The CPAC referred ten applicants to the panel for consideration. (Id. at 94:17-18.)
The panel members independently ranked the resumes of the referred candidates; eight were
interviewed, including Plaintiff and Hogg. (Ex. K; Ex. J, 59:7-8.) The panel members asked
each interviewee the same four questions and independently ranked their responses. (Ex. J,
58:5-16, 62:5-8.) Based upon the interviews and resumes, each panel member identified his
5

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 6 of 29

top three choices for consideration. Plaintiff was not a top choice of any panelist. (Id. at
62:19-20.) The selectee was a top choice on all three panelists’ lists. (Ex. K.) After
checking the top three candidates’ references, the panel members reconvened and reached
a consensus that Hogg was the top candidate. (Ex. J, 84:22-85:1.) Kresten Cook followed
all applicable regulatory guidelines and directives in filling the supervisory IED chief
vacancy. (Id. at 138:20-23.) The selection process for the supervisory position was
consistent with CCAD’s standard procedure. (Id. at 136:12-137:4.)
On July 1, 2009, Cook notified Plaintiff that Gary Hogg had been selected for the
supervisory position. (Ex. L.) Hogg’s selection was effective August 3, 2009. (Ex. M.)

D.

14-DAY SUSPENSION - HOME MEETING INCIDENT
Hogg was in training August 3-6, 2009, and did not report for duty until the afternoon

of August 6, 2009. (Ex. A,.19:2-8, 97:4-23.) Howe remained the unofficial Acting IED
Chief the morning of August 6, 2009, because Hogg was in Human Resource training and
did not take responsibility for the division until approximately 11:00 a.m. (Id.) Howe
attended the August 6, 2009, home team meeting to present recent audit findings within IED
and to present safety findings for the week. (Id. at 98:4-99:1.)
The facilitator role at the home team meeting is usually rotated among the employees
on a monthly basis, pursuant to a roster created by the IED Chief. (Ex. A, 185:4-7; Ex. B,
30:1-6.) Plaintiff was the next name on the roster to facilitate the August 6 meeting. (Ex.
A. 158:7-12.) Upon arrival, Plaintiff ordered Howe to leave the meeting because he was
uninvited. (Ex. B, 31:8-18; Ex. A, 187:15-17.) Howe explained that he had information to
6

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 7 of 29

share with IED personnel. (Ex. A, 187:18-21.) Ballard told Plaintiff that she invited Howe,
at Kresten Cook’s direction, to attend the meeting. (Id. at 248:20-249:1.) Plaintiff called
security to remove Howe from the meeting. (Ex. B, 31:15-18.) Security contacted Kresten
Cook who indicated Howe was properly at the meeting. (Ex. A, 156:17-18; 160:15-161:2.)
Hogg requested via e-mail to meet with Plaintiff on August 17, 2009, to discuss the
August 6 incident as part of his investigation as to what happened at that meeting. (Ex. A,
30:19-31:9.) Plaintiff responded that he had a previous engagement with the Deputy
Commander and his union representative to appeal his 5-day suspension. (Id. at 31:15-23.)
Hogg told Plaintiff that the meeting would be short and reiterated that he expected Plaintiff’s
attendance. (Ex. N.) Plaintiff did not show up for the meeting with Hogg. (Ex. A, Tr.
32:8-14.)
Hogg scheduled a second mandatory meeting for August 25, 2009, with Plaintiff and
Nora Ortiz, from CPAC, to discuss the August 6 incident. (Ex. O.) Plaintiff did not show
up at the appointed time. (Ex. P.) On two occasions, Hogg called Plaintiff when he did not
show up at the appointed time. (Ex. A, 106:21-107:2.) During one call, Hogg asked Plaintiff
whether he was going to attend, to which Plaintiff said “no” and hung up. (Id.) Plaintiff ,
accompanied by his union representative, finally met with Hogg and Ortiz on August 31 to
discuss the August 6 incident. (Id. at 33:17-21.) Plaintiff refused to answer the questions
verbally during the meeting, insisting on providing written responses, which he did shortly
thereafter. (Id. at 34:4-21.)

7

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 8 of 29

On September 23, 2009, Hogg proposed that the Army impose a 30-day suspension
on Plaintiff for insubordination and creating a disturbance related to the August 6 incident.
(Ex. Q.) Plaintiff’s response to the proposed discipline was due within five days of receiving
the proposal. (Id.) Kresten Cook granted Plaintiff an extension until October 15, 2009, to
respond. (Ex. A, 281:22-282:8.) Plaintiff did not request a second deadline extension from
Cook, (Id. at 234:3-6), and made the decision not to submit a response, (Id. at 232:3-10). On
December 9, 2009, Cook notified Plaintiff of his decision to mitigate Hogg’s proposal and
reduce Plaintiff’s suspension for the August 6 incident to 14 days. (Id. at 38:23-39:5.)

E.

REMOVAL FROM FEDERAL SERVICE
On May 13, 2010, the union steward advised Plaintiff that Hogg, who had agreed to

excuse Plaintiff from home team meeting facilitator duties, nonetheless was still authorized
to assign Plaintiff action register responsibilities in the meetings. (Ex. E, 12:10-13:20.)
On October 4, 2010, Hogg sent an email to his employees, including Plaintiff, with
an attached spreadsheet indicating rotational responsibilities for the IED home team meetings
for fiscal year 2011. (Ex. R.) On the roster, Hogg assigned Plaintiff the task of maintaining
the action register for the month of October 2010. (Id.) Plaintiff responded at the end of the
day via e-mail to all IED staff that he was “absolutely NOT interested in participating.” (Id.;
Ex. E, 17:9-16.) Hogg responded verbally and via e-mail that the action register roles are
assigned duties and that he was expected to perform them. (Id. at 17:20-21:2.)

8

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 9 of 29

On October 6, 2010, just prior to the 8:00 a.m. meeting start time, Hogg asked Ballard
where Plaintiff was and then left the room to find Plaintiff. (Id. at 55:21-23.) At 9:10 a.m.,
Hogg drafted a Memorandum for Record (“MFR”) stating that he went to Plaintiff’s office
to remind him of the home team meeting and that Plaintiff told him to “get out of my office”
and that he had “no interest in participating” in the home team meeting. Hogg told Plaintiff
that, as his supervisor, he expected Plaintiff to speak to him in a respectful manner. Plaintiff
raised his voice and told Hogg, “You do not get to direct me, I do.” Hogg informed Plaintiff
that he would be meeting with the Personnel office to consider disciplinary action. (Ex. R;
Ex. E, 22:8-24:4.)
That afternoon, Hogg sent an email to Plaintiff notifying him that they needed to meet
at 2:00 p.m. on October 7 to discuss the incident. On October 7, Plaintiff responded by
sending the following threat and insult via mass e-mail distribution:
I do NOT know, have any idea or knowledge of what you spoke of. I have NO
idea what the heck you meant. Your sight is hateful, you are a bigot, a racist,
prejudice and have discriminated against me. There are two EEO cases on my
behalf against you pending and wish NOT to appear in your sight for any
reason till these cases are resolved. If you do NOT stop harassing me or the
CCAD management does NOT separate you and I from the Industrial Engineering Division office, your actions against me will surely lead to a disaster.
(Ex. S.)
At approximately 11:13 a.m. on October 7, Hogg approached Plaintiff in his office
and informed him that he had received his e-mail response, but that the meeting was
mandatory. As Hogg began speaking, Plaintiff walked around Hogg without uttering a word,
and left the office. Hogg directed him to stop but Plaintiff continued walking out the door.

9

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 10 of 29

(Ex. E, 215:6-21, 216:2-12.) Thirteen minutes later, at 11:26 a.m., Hogg sent Plaintiff an
e-mail summarizing what had occurred and reiterating that the 2:00 p.m. meeting was
mandatory. (Ex. T.) At 12:11 p.m., Plaintiff responded with another threatening e-mail:
Repeat, I do NOT know, have any idea or knowledge of what you spoke of.
I have NO idea what the heck you meant. Your sight is hateful, you are a
bigot, a racist, prejudice and have discriminated against me. There are two
EEO cases on my behalf against you pending and wish NOT to appear in your
sight for any reason till these cases are resolved. If you do NOT stop harassing
me or the CCAD management does NOT separate you and I from the
Industrial Engineering Division office, your actions against me will surely lead
to a disaster.
(Ex. E, 247:2-8; Ex. T.)
Plaintiff and his union representative appeared for the 2:00 p.m. meeting. Plaintiff
acknowledged that Hogg was his supervisor and that he received the e-mails describing the
responsibility assigned to him in the home team meetings. However, he denied being at his
desk when Hogg approached at 8:00 a.m. on October 6. Plaintiff further told Hogg that his
presence in Plaintiff’s office was itself an issue. (Ex. E, 253:1-254:2.)
On October 20, 2010, Plaintiff again failed to attend the home team meeting. (Ex. E,
32:16-21.) On October 25, Hogg met with Plaintiff to discuss his absence at the October 20
meeting. Plaintiff provided no reason for his absence and asked Hogg to show him the
regulation stating that the meeting was mandatory. (Id. at 33:6-24.)
On November 17, 2010, Hogg proposed Plaintiff’s removal from federal service based
upon his third offense of insubordination, discourtesy towards a supervisor, and false
statement related to the events that occurred October 4-7, 2010. (Ex. U.)

10

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 11 of 29

On December 17, 2010, William Braddy, Deputy Commander for Maintenance
Operations at CCAD and the deciding official on Plaintiff's removal, conducted a reply
meeting with Plaintiff and his union representative. Prior to making his decision, Braddy
also considered Plaintiff’s 90-page written reply. (Ex. E, 66:10-20.)
On March 14, 2011, Deputy Commander Braddy issued his decision, finding that all
of the charges and specifications were substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence and
that removal was the appropriate penalty for the misconduct. In rendering his penalty
decision, he noted that Plaintiff did not demonstrate remorse nor express any apology and
blamed others for his own conduct. He concluded that the 8:00 a.m. meeting Hogg
documented in the MFR did occur and that Plaintiff was not truthful. As part of his analysis,
Deputy Commander Braddy considered Plaintiff’s years of government experience and
exceptional performance ratings from 2006 through 2008 as a strong mitigating factor.
However, he found Plaintiff’s potential for rehabilitation very low in light of the seriousness
of the misconduct and the history of two prior similar disciplinary actions. Plaintiff's
removal was effective March 14, 2011. (Ex. V.)

G.

MSPB APPEAL
On April 11, 2011, Plaintiff filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board

(“MSPB”), alleging that his removal was the result of harmful error, discrimination, and
retaliation. (Ex. BB.)
On December 16, 2011, the Administrative Judge affirmed the Army’s action in
Plaintiff’s “mixed case” appeal, concluding that the penalty of removal was reasonable under
the circumstances. (Ex. CC.)
11

III. FIVE DAY SUSPENSION
The EEOC has promulgated regulations for the acceptance and processing of
discrimination complaints in federal employment. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.107(b). These
regulations provide time limits for initiating and processing an EEO complaint. To initiate
informal pre-complaint processing, an aggrieved federal employee must consult with an EEO
counselor within forty-five days of the alleged discriminatory event. See 29 C.F.R. §
1614.105(a)(1); Teemac v. Henderson, 298 F.3d 452 (5th Cir. 2002). If the matter is not
resolved by informal pre-complaint counseling, the agency must provide notice of the right
to file a formal complaint of discrimination. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(d). After receipt of
notice, the employee has fifteen calendar days to file the formal complaint. 29 C.F.R. §
1614.106(b).
These rules are not mere technicalities, but integral parts of Congress’ statutory
scheme of achieving a “careful blend of administrative and judicial enforcement powers.”
Brown v. General. Services Admin., 425 U.S. 820, 833 (1976). If a federal employee fails
to timely notify an EEO counselor, then he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,
and the Court should dismiss the claim. See Pacheco v. Mineta, 448 F.3d 783, 788 (5 th Cir.
2006); Vidal v. Chertoff, 293 Fed. Appx. 325 (5th Cir. 2008); Molina v. Vilsack, 748
F.Supp.2d 702 (S.D. Tex. 2010)(Jack, J.).
Plaintiff’s five day suspension commenced on July 27, 2009, and ended on July 31,
2009. He returned to the workplace on August 3, 2009.
On November 24, 2009, Plaintiff submitted Formal EEO Complaint Number
ARCCAD09OCT04786, alleging discrimination and reprisal related to his 5-day suspension
12

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 13 of 29

issued July 27, 2009, and his notice of proposed 14-day suspension based upon the August
6, 2009 incident. (Ex. X.) The claim related to his 5-day suspension in July 2009 was
rejected as untimely. (Ex. Z.)
On May 11, 2010, the EEOC Office of Federal Operations affirmed the Final Agency
Decision dismissing any claims related to his 5-day suspension as untimely, and dismissing
his claims related to the notice of proposed 14-day suspension as premature. (Ex. Y.)
On July 8, 2011, the EEO Commission Office of Federal Operations (EEOC OFO)
affirmed the Final Agency Decision finding no discrimination in Plaintiff’s non-selection.
(Ex. W.)
Any Title VII claims related to Plaintiff’s five-day suspension are barred because he
failed to contact a Department of Army EEO counselor within forty-five days of the effective
date of his suspension.
Plaintiff filed the complaint initiating this civil action on July 8, 2011. The Department of the Army EEO Compliance and Complaints Review (EEOCCR) dismissed EEO
Complaint Number ARCCAD09DEC05742 upon notice that Plaintiff filed the instant
judicial action. (Ex. AA.)
III. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
A.

Standard of Review
Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the

moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “The movant
bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the
absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Triple Tee Golf, Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253,
261 (5th Cir. 2007).
13

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 14 of 29

When the moving party has met its Rule 56 burden, the nonmoving party cannot
survive a summary judgment motion by resting on the mere allegations of its pleadings. The
nonmovant must identify specific evidence in the record and articulate how that evidence
supports that party’s claim. Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir. 2007). This
burden will not be satisfied by “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by
conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence.”
Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc).
B.

McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting
In employment discrimination cases, discrimination under Title VII may be proven

“through direct or circumstantial evidence.” Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476
F.3d 337, 345 (5th Cir. 2007). The Fifth Circuit has held that in cases where, as here, no
direct evidence of discriminatory intent has been produced, proof by means of circumstantial
evidence must be evaluated using the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 ( 1973). See Turner, 476 F.3d at 345; Rachid v. Jack
In The Box, Inc., 376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir. 2004). The McDonnell Douglas test applied to
Title VII disparate treatment cases is also applicable to Title VII unlawful retaliation cases.
Byers v. Dallas Morning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 427 (5th Cir. 2000).
Under the modified McDonnell Douglas framework, the Fifth Circuit has stated the
test as follows:

14

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 15 of 29

[T]he plaintiff must first demonstrate a prima facie case of
discrimination; the defendant then must articulate a legitimate,
non-discriminatory reason for its decision to terminate the plaintiff; and, if the
defendant meets its burden of production, the plaintiff must then offer
sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact either (1) [that]
the [defendant] employer's reason is a pretext or (2) that the [defendant]
employer's reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and
another motivating factor is the plaintiff's protected characteristic.
Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Grp., 482 F.3d 408, 411-12 (5 th Cir. 2007).
“Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under [the McDonnell
Douglas] framework, ‘[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant
intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.’”
Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000).
To avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff must show “the evidence, taken as a whole:
(1) creates a fact issue as to whether each of the employer’s stated reasons was not what
actually motivated the employer and (2) creates a reasonable inference that race [national
origin, or retaliation were determinative factor[s] in the actions of which plaintiff
complains.” Grimes v. Tex. Dep't of Mental Health & Mental Retardation, 102 F.3d 137,
141 (5th Cir. 1996). When, as here, the plaintiff fails to meet this burden, summary judgment
is proper.
C.

PRIMA FACIE CASE
1.

Plaintiff Cannot Establish Prima Facie Discriminatory Discipline Case

In his First Cause of Action, Plaintiff appears to generally allege that he was a victim
of disparate treatment on the basis of race/color and national origin when he was disciplined
on two occasions, not selected for the IED Chief position, and ultimately removed from
15

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 16 of 29

federal service. Plaintiff offers no direct evidence to support his discrimination claims and,
thus, must rely on the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting proof model. Defendant is
entitled to summary judgment on the claims related to the two suspensions and termination
because Plaintiff has offered no evidence to support the fourth prong of his prima facie case.
To establish a prima facie case of racial and/or national origin discrimination in
employment, an employee must demonstrate that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2)
he was qualified for the position at issue, (3) he was the subject of an adverse employment
action, and (4) he was treated less favorably because of his membership in that protected
class than were other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected
class, under nearly identical circumstances. Lee v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., 574 F.3d 253, 259
(5th Cir. 2009).
Plaintiff's discriminatory discipline claims fail because he cannot identify similarly
situated comparators who were treated more favorably.
Plaintiff cannot meet his threshold burden of establishing a prima facie case of
discrimination related to his two suspensions and termination because he cannot satisfy the
fourth element – that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside
his protected class, under nearly identical circumstances. See Wheeler v. BL Dev. Co., 415
F.3d 399, 405 (5th Cir. 2005). As such, these claims fail as a matter of law.
In order to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must demonstrate that a “similarly
situated” employee under “nearly identical” circumstances, was treated differently. Keelan
v. Majesco Software, Inc., 407 F.3d 332, 345 (5th Cir. 2005). Circumstances are nearly

16

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 17 of 29

identical when the employees being compared held the same job or responsibilities, shared
the same supervisor or had their employment status determined by the same person, and have
essentially comparable violation histories. Lee, 574 F.3d at 260 (citations omitted).
“[C]ritically, the plaintiff’s conduct that drew the adverse employment decision must have
been ‘nearly identical’ to that of the proffered comparator who allegedly drew dissimilar
employment decisions.” Lee, 574 F.3d at 260.
To meet his burden, Plaintiff proffers Hamilton Pabone (24 minutes late), Tom Green
(late), and Ken Norman (late) as similarly situated comparators. (Ex. A, 16:23-18:15.) In
contrast, Plaintiff was charged with insubordination, discourtesy to supervisors and making
false statements. Plaintiff’s evidence that these coworkers were not punished, or not
punished as severely as Plaintiff, for attendance-related issues fails to satisfy his burden to
identify similarly situated comparators. Because the “difference between [Plaintiff]’s
conduct and that of those alleged to be similarly situated accounts for the difference in
treatment received from the employer,” the employees are not similarly situated for the
purposes of an employment discrimination analysis. Lee, 574 F.3d at 260. Plaintiff’s failure
to come forward with probative evidence establishing that his suspensions and termination
were motivated by race or national origin entitles the Army to summary judgment on these
claims.
2.

Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Prima Facie Retaliation Case

In his Second Cause of Action, Plaintiff appears to allege that he was not selected for
the IED Chief position, disciplined on two occasions, and removed because he had engaged

17

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 18 of 29

in protected activity. Plaintiff offers no direct evidence to support his retaliation claims and,
thus, must rely on the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting proof model. Defendant is
entitled to summary judgment on the claims related the 5-day suspension and his
nonselection because Plaintiff has offered no evidence to support the first prong of his prima
facie case. Defendant is also entitled to summary judgment on the claims related to his
removal from federal service because he cannot satisfy the fourth prong of his prima facie
case.
To establish a prima facie retaliation case, an employee must demonstrate that: (1)
he engaged in a protected activity as defined by Title VII; (2) his employer was aware of that
activity; (3) he suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (4) there was a causal
connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Burlington
N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 584 U.S. 53, 68-69 (2006); McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492
F.3d 551, 557 (5 th Cir. 2007).
a.

Plaintiff’s retaliation claims related to the 5-day suspension and nonselection

fail because he cannot show he engaged in protected activity prior to these actions.
Plaintiff cannot meet his threshold burden to establish a prima facie retaliation case
related to his five day suspension and nonselection because he cannot satisfy the first prong
– that he participated in prior activity as defined by Title VII. Under Title VII, an employee
has engaged in protected activity if he has (1) “opposed any practice made an unlawful
employment practice by this subchapter,” or (2) “made a charge, testified, assisted, or
participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.”

18

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 19 of 29

42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Title VII prohibits discrimination “against any individual with
respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such
individual's race, color . . . or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(1). Thus, to be
actionable under Title VII, the activity must be related to discrimination in employment based
upon membership in one of the enunciated protected classes.
Plaintiff did not engage in any activity protected under Title VII prior to the Army
initiating the disciplinary action resulting in the five day suspension or prior to his
non-selection. Mr. Hogg proposed that the Army suspend Plaintiff for conduct related to the
filing cabinet incident on June 5, 2009. Cook notified Plaintiff of his non-selection on July
1, 2009. (Ex. L.) Thus, to establish retaliation, the protected activity had to have occurred
prior to July 1. The record evidence, however, shows that Plaintiff first initiated contact with
an EEO counselor on July 13, 2009, alleging discriminatory nonselection for the IED Chief
vacancy. (Ex. W.) Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff attempts to proffer prior Inspector
General complaints in support of his proof burden (Ex. B, 25:25-27:3), such activity, alleging
misconduct unrelated to the protections afforded under Title VII, is wholly insufficient
evidence of prior protected activity to establish a prima facie retaliation case under Title VII.
See Bartz v. Mitchell Ctr., 2008 WL 577388, *2 (W.D. Tex. 2008) (citations omitted) (“if the
conduct complained of by the plaintiff had nothing to do with race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin, a retaliation claim cannot be maintained under Title VII.”). Accordingly,
summary judgment should be granted to the Army on these claims.

Plaintiff’s retaliation claims related to his termination fail because he cannot

show the requisite causal connection.
Plaintiff cannot meet his threshold burden to establish a prima facie retaliation case
related to his removal from federal service because he cannot satisfy the fourth prong – a
causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment actions.
Temporal proximity between an EEO complaint and an employee’s removal can establish
the causation prong of his prima facie case. However, Plaintiff must show that the protected
activity and the adverse employment action are “very close” in time. Washburn v. Harvey,
504 F.3d 505, 511 (5th Cir. 2007). Courts have routinely held that a period greater than five
months is insufficient to make a prima facie showing of causation. Clark County School
Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001); Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 209
(10th Cir. 1997) (three months), Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7 th Cir. 1992)
(four months); Everett v. Central Mississippi, Inc. Head Start Program, 444 Fed. App’x 38,
(5th Cir. 2011) (5 months insufficient).
Plaintiff's prior protected activity is too remote in time from his removal to establish
the requisite causal connection. Plaintiff filed his last formal EEO complaint on February
5, 2010. (Ex. Z.) Mr. Hogg proposed his termination on November 17, 2010. (Ex. U.) The
passage of almost nine and a half months between Plaintiff’s protected activity and the
adverse action defeats Plaintiff's proof burden as to causation as a matter of law. The
absence of any evidence in the record showing the requisite causal connection warrants
summary judgment in the Army’s favor on this claim.

PRETEXT
Even were the Court to find that Plaintiff met his threshold burden of establishing

prima facie discrimination and retaliation cases, which the Army denies, his claims fail
because he cannot show the Army's legitimate nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reasons
were pretext. “A plaintiff may establish pretext either through evidence of disparate
treatment or by showing that the employer’s proffered explanation is false or ‘unworthy of
credence.’” Laxton, 333 F.3d at 578. “In order to rebut a defendant's showing of legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, [however] ‘[i]t is not enough . . . to dis-believe the
employer.’” Warren v. City of Tupelo, 332 Fed. App’x 176, 181 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting St.
Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993)). Rather, “the factfinder must believe
the plaintiff’s explanation of intentional discrimination.” Id. There is no evidence in the
record upon which a reasonable trier of fact could infer that any of the Army’s reasons for
its actions were pretext for intentional discrimination or retaliation and, therefore, this Court
should grant summary judgment in favor of the Army.
1.

Five Day Suspension

The Army’s proffered reason for suspending Plaintiff for five days – creating a
disturbance and discourtesy (first offense) – are legitimate nondiscriminatory and
nonretaliatory reasons for its actions. Plaintiff cannot show that the Army’s reasons were
false or unworthy of credence as required to survive summary judgment.
The undisputed record evidence shows the veracity of the Army’s reasons. Mr. Howe,
Plaintiff’s supervisor at the time of the filing cabinet incident, testified that he authorized

21

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 22 of 29

KBSI to move the filing cabinets during the mandatory March 26 home team meeting that
Plaintiff did not attend. Coworkers reported to Howe that Plaintiff appeared agitated that the
cabinets were moved into his office without being coordinated through him, (Ex. E, 7:10-18),
and that he yelled when questioning coworkers about who authorized placing the cabinets
in his office (Ex. A, 243:21-244:7). Plaintiff admits that he did not discuss the matter with
Howe before moving the cabinets despite both Hogg and Ballard directing him to do so.
Instead, he returned to his office and removed the files from the first cabinet in order to move
the cabinet out of his office. (Ex. B, 16:22-24, 18:14-19.) Coworkers also submitted
statements to Howe that they witnessed Junaid pull files out of the cabinets and put them on
an adjoining table where they spilled over onto the floor in disarray. (Ex. A, 103:2-9; Ex. E,
7:21; Ex. F.) Finally, coworkers reported to Howe that they witnessed Junaid loudly tell
Ballard that she had no right to change his office space and push her back as he closed the
door in her face. (Ex. A, 103:10-21; Ex. E, 8:3-10; Ex. F.) The decision to suspend Plaintiff
for five days was reasonable under these facts.
In his deposition, Plaintiff asserted, without corroboration or otherwise supporting
evidence, that the suspension was motivated by race and national origin because he had the
right to move contractor property out of his office. (Ex. B, 24:6-22.) Plaintiff’s subjective
belief as to the appropriateness of his actions is not probative evidence and insufficient to
survive summary judgment. See Moore v. Eli Lilly & Co., 990 F.2d 812 (5 th Cir.1993)
(subjective belief of pretext insufficient to require a jury trial). Plaintiff’s failure to rebut the
Army’s legitimate reasons for its actions warrants judgment in the Army's favor as a matter
of law on the claims related to the five-day suspension.
22

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

14-Day Suspension

Likewise, the Army's proffered reason for suspending Plaintiff for 14-days –
insubordination and creating a disturbance (second offense) – are legitimate nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reasons for its actions. Plaintiff cannot show that the
Army’s reasons were false or unworthy of credence as required to survive summary
judgment.
Plaintiff does not dispute the facts as documented in Hogg’s suspension proposal or
in Cook’s decision to mitigate the proposal and impose a 14-day suspension. On the morning
of August 6, 2009, Mr. Hogg had not yet assumed the IED Chief duties. (Ex. A, 97:4-23.)
Mr. Howe, who was Plaintiff’s first-line supervisor until 3 days earlier, attended the August
6, 2009, home team meeting to provide ISO Audit insufficiency findings within IED and to
present safety findings for the week. (Id. at 98:4-99:1.) Plaintiff was the meeting facilitator
because the assigned coworker was absent. (Id. at 158:7-12.) Plaintiff ordered Howe to
leave the home team meeting because he was uninvited. (Ex. B; Ex. A, 187:15-17.) Mr.
Howe explained that he had information to share with IED personnel. (Ex. A, 187:18-21.)
Despite Ms. Ballard telling Plaintiff that she invited Mr. Howe to attend the meeting, (Id. at
248:20-249:1), Plaintiff called security to remove Mr. Howe from the home team meeting,
(Ex. B, 31:15-18). The decision to suspend Plaintiff for 14-days was reasonable under these
facts, particularly as Plaintiff had returned only three days earlier from a 5-day suspension
for similar misconduct.

23

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 24 of 29

Plaintiff contends the 14-day suspension was motivated by race and national origin
discrimination because he was authorized as Acting IED Chief to call security and because
Mr. Cook did not afford him additional time to respond to the proposed suspension. Neither
of these contentions is supported by the record. As to the first contention, according to the
roster prepared by the IED Chief, Mr. Howe’s position for the eight months prior to the
August 6 incident, Tom Green was the assigned facilitator, not Acting IED Chief, for the
August 6 meeting. Plaintiff was the facilitator only because Mr. Green was absent that
morning, and, therefore, the duty fell to the next name on the roster – Plaintiff. (Ex. A,
158:7-12.) With regard to the second contention, the undisputed record evidence shows that
Mr. Cook granted Plaintiff an extension until October 15, 2009, to respond. (Ex. A,
281:22-282:8.) However, Plaintiff did not request a second deadline extension from Mr.
Cook, (Ex. A, 234:3-6) and made the decision not to submit a response, (Ex. A, 232:3-10).
Plaintiff’s failure to rebut the Army's legitimate reasons for its actions warrants judgment in
the Army's favor as a matter of law on the claims related to the 14-day suspension.
3.

Non-Selection

A plaintiff may rebut a defendant employer’s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason,
“survive summary judgment, and take his case to the jury by providing evidence that he was
‘clearly better qualified’ than the employee selected for the position at issue.” Celestine v.
Petroleos de Venezuella SA, 266 F.3d 343, 357 (5th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).
Plaintiff maintains that he is clearly more qualified than Hogg because he was already a
government employee and Hogg was a contractor at the time of the selection . (Ex. B,

24

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 25 of 29

11:4-20; 28:4-29:16.) However, the fact that Hogg’s industrial engineering experience was
in the private sector is not probative as to who was more qualified for the IED Chief position.
The record evidence shows that Plaintiff had a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering.
Hogg had both a bachelor’s degree and a master's degree in industrial engineering from
Texas A & M – College Station.
The selectee was the better qualified candidate for the IED Chief position. Plaintiff’s
subjective belief that he was not selected based upon discrimination or retaliation is
insufficient to create an inference of the Army’s discriminatory intent. Indeed, “a subjective
belief of discrimination, however genuine, [may not] be the basis of judicial relief.”
Lawrence v. Univ. of Tex. Med. Branch at Galveston, 163 F.3d 309, 313 (5 th Cir. 1999).
Plaintiff's failure to show that he was clearly more qualified than the selectee, or to identify
any evidence suggesting that the Army’s articulated reasons for not selecting him for the
supervisory position at issue were pretextual warrants judgment in the Army’s favor as a
matter of law on the claims related to Plaintiff’s nonselection for the IED Chief position.
4.

Removal

The Army's proffered reasons for removing Plaintiff from federal service –
insubordination, discourtesy to a supervisor, and making a false statements (third offense)
– are legitimate nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reasons for its actions. See Aldrup v.
Caldera, 274 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir. 2001) (insubordination on three separate occasions
sufficient nondiscriminatory reason for removal). Plaintiff cannot show that the Army’s
reasons were false or unworthy of credence as required to survive summary judgment.

25

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 26 of 29

The undisputed record evidence supports the charge of insubordination. The union
steward advised Plaintiff on May 13, 2010, that Mr. Hogg was authorized to assign Plaintiff
action register responsibilities. (Ex. E, 12:10-13:20.) On October 4, 2010, Mr. Hogg
assigned Plaintiff the task of maintaining the action register for the month of October 2010.
(Ex. R.) Plaintiff responded at the end of the day via e-mail to all IED staff that he was
“absolutely NOT interested in participating.” (Id.; Ex. E, 17:9-16.) Mr. Hogg responded
verbally and via e-mail that the action register roles are assigned duties and that he was
expected to perform them.

(Ex. E, 17:20-21:2.)

Nevertheless, Plaintiff ignored his

supervisor’s direction and did not attend the meeting.
The record evidence further shows that Plaintiff’s behavior was discourteous and
threatening to his supervisor. Mr. Hogg sent Plaintiff an e-mail that afternoon, notifying him
that a meeting scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on October 7 to discuss the incident. On October 7,
Plaintiff responded via mass e-mail distribution:
I do NOT know, have any idea or knowledge of what you spoke of. I have NO
idea what the heck you meant. Your sight is hateful, you are a bigot, a racist,
prejudice [sic] and have discriminated against me. There are two EEO cases
on my behalf against you pending and wish NOT to appear in your sight for
any reason till these cases are resolved. If you do NOT stop harassing me or
the CCAD management does NOT separate you and I from the Industrial
Engineering Division office, your actions against me will surely lead to a
disaster.
(Ex. S.)
At approximately 11:13 a.m. on October 7, Mr. Hogg approached Plaintiff in his
office and informed him that he had received his e-mail response but that the meeting was
mandatory. As Mr. Hogg began speaking, Plaintiff walked around Mr. Hogg without
26

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 27 of 29

uttering a word, and left the office. Mr. Hogg directed him to stop but Plaintiff continued
walking out the door. (Ex. E, 215:6-21, 216:2-12.) Thirteen minutes later, at 11:26 a.m., Mr.
Hogg sent Junaid an e-mail summarizing what had occurred and reiterating that the 2:00 p.m.
meeting was mandatory. (Ex. T.) Junaid responded with an e-mail at 12:11 p.m. stating:
Repeat, I do NOT know, have any idea or knowledge of what you spoke of.
I have NO idea what the heck you meant. Your sight is hateful, you are a
bigot, a racist, prejudice [sic] and have discriminated against me. There are
two EEO cases on my behalf against you pending and wish NOT to appear in
your sight for any reason till these cases are resolved. If you do NOT stop
harassing me or the CCAD management does NOT separate you and I from
the Industrial Engineering Division office, your actions against me will surely
lead to a disaster.
(Ex. E,. 247:2-8; Ex. T, ) Sending these e-mails, particularly the broad distribution Plaintiff
utilized, is threatening and disruptive to the work environment
Finally, the deciding official’s determination that Plaintiff gave a false statement when
he denied an encounter with Hogg occurred prior to the October 6 home team meeting is
supported by the record. In reaching this decision, Mr. Braddy found the fact Mr. Hogg
drafted an MFR on October 6, 2010, at 9:10 a.m., concerning the encounter to be credible
evidence that the encounter occurred as Hogg described. (Ex. V, Ex. R, Ex. E, 22:8-24:4.)
While Plaintiff’s government experience and exceptional performance ratings from 2006
through 2008 were strong mitigating factors, Mr. Braddy found removal appropriate because
Plaintiff’s potential for rehabilitation was very low in light of the seriousness of the
misconduct and the history of two prior similar disciplinary actions. (Ex. V.) Thus, Plaintiff
cannot show that the Army’s decision to remove him from federal service was pretext for
discrimination based upon his race and national origin, or in retaliation for participation in
prior protected activity.
27

Case 2:11-cv-00226 Document 29

Filed in TXSD on 04/06/12 Page 28 of 29

Plaintiff's behavior in refusing to attend the home team meetings as directed by his
supervisor was unreasonable and outside the protection of Title VII. A subordinate must
obey an order first and complain later, unless doing so would place them in a clearly
dangerous situation. Aldrup, 274 F.3d 282, 288). When, as here, an employee is unusually
combative, otherwise protected conduct may be so disruptive or inappropriate as to fall
outside the Title VII’s protection. See Rollins v. State of Fla. Dep’t of Law Enforcement, 868
F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir. 1989) (To determine the reasonableness of an employee’s opposition,
other courts have weighed “the need to protect individuals asserting their rights [under Title
VII] against an employer’s legitimate demands for loyalty, cooperation and a generally
productive work environment.”). The undisputed relevant evidence of record shows that the
Army’s actions were not motivated by discrimination or retaliation but, rather, Plaintiff’s
insubordinate and disrespectful behavior towards his supervisors and his behavior’s
disruption to the workplace. It was only after efforts to address his unreasonable refusal to
follow his supervisor’s directives and his repeated discourtesy proved unsuccessful that the
Army properly removed him from federal service. Accordingly, this Court should grant
summary judgment to the Army on Plaintiff’s discrimination and retaliation claims.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s claims related to the
five-day suspension in July 2009, grant the Army’s Motion for Summary Judgment, and enter
a final judgment in the Army’s favor on all claims.
