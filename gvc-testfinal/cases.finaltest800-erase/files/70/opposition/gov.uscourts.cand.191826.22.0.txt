MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

INTRODUCTION

3

It is simply disingenuous for O2 Micro to play coy. There can be no real dispute that an

4

actual case and controversy exists between O2 Micro International Limited (“O2 Micro”) and

5

Monolithic Powers Systems, Inc. (“MPS”) over U.S. Patent No. 6,804,129 (“the ‘129 Patent”).

6

For over six years, O2 Micro has relied on the ‘129 Patent and its family to wage a relentless

7

crusade against MPS, its suppliers and its customers. Through its Complaint, MPS petitions this

8

Court for the opportunity to shut the door on O2 Micro’s meritless campaign and free itself from

9

the business dampening effects of O2 Micro’s constant threat of further litigation.

10

In a deceptive effort to argue against jurisdiction, O2 Micro takes several liberties with the

11

relevant facts. O2 Micro now conveniently takes an expansive view of a covenant not to sue

12

given to MPS while simultaneously construing the same covenant much more narrowly in other

13

venues. O2 Micro also improperly dismisses its pending litigation of the ‘129 Patent against an

14

MPS customer as a basis of jurisdiction. Most egregiously, O2 Micro completely ignores the

15

historic and ongoing conflict between itself and MPS over the ‘129 Patent and its family.

16

MPS’s claims for declaratory relief result from an actual case and controversy between the

17

parties over the validity of the ‘129 Patent and its applicability to MPS products. Through this

18

lawsuit, MPS seeks to end this long-running dispute. This Court can and should exercise its

19

discretion to provide a forum for MPS to conclusively settle its dispute with O2 Micro and erase

20

ambiguities surrounding MPS’s right to market and sell its products, and its customers’ rights to

21

use them.

22

II.

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

23

The parties present the following issues for decision:

24

(1)

Does the introduction of new products combined with O2 Micro’s sweeping

25

litigation strategy against MPS and its customers support declaratory judgment

26

jurisdiction concerning the ‘129 Patent?

27

(2)

Should this Court exercise its discretion to hear MPS’s claims?

RELEVANT FACTS

2

A.

3

This motion should not be resolved in a vacuum. It is critical to recognize the broader and

4

overarching disputes between MPS and O2 Micro in order to understand the current controversy

5

between the parties concerning the ‘129 Patent. As this Court is well-aware, this suit is only the

6

latest in a series of litigations between the parties and customers involving competing power

7

inverter controllers. The dispute centers on three related O2 Micro patents—the ‘129 Patent, its

8

“parent” and its” grandparent”1—which share the same specification.

9

shotgun approach to litigating this patent family, asserting nearly identical claims against MPS,

10

its customers and its suppliers in various jurisdictions over essentially identical inverter

11

controllers.

A Long-Standing History of Litigation Exists Between The Parties.

O2 Micro adopted a

12

This Court resolved separate disputes over the ‘615 and ‘722 Patents. In O2 Micro Int’l,

13

Ltd. v. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., Case No. 01-3995 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 11, 2004), the Court

14

held on summary judgment that MPS’s products did not infringe any asserted claim of the ‘615

15

Patent. (Declaration of Matthew J. Brigham [“Brigham Decl.”], Ex. 1.) In O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd. v.

16

Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. et al., Case Nos. 04-2000 & 06-2929 (N.D. Cal.) [Oakland II],

17

the jury rendered a verdict that all asserted claims of the ‘722 Patent are invalid as obvious and by

18

virtue of the on-sale bar. (Brigham Decl., Ex. 2.) Final judgment is expected.

19

B.

20

The Oakland II Stipulation and Covenant Not to Sue Do Not Explicitly
Mention New MPS Products.

21

The ‘129 Patent dispute began when O2 Micro sued MPS in the Eastern District of Texas

22

the day the ‘129 Patent issued. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd. v. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. et al., Case

23

No. 04-0359 (filed Oct. 12, 2004). O2 Micro later amended its complaint to assert ‘129 Patent

24

claims against two MPS customers and an MPS supplier. Judge Ward subsequently transferred

25

the Texas case to this Court, where it was consolidated with the related ‘722 litigation on August

26

9, 2006.

The grandparent of the ‘129 Patent is U.S. Patent No. 6,259,615 (“the ‘615 Patent”). The parent of the ‘129 Patent
is U.S. Patent No. 6,396,722 (“the ‘722 Patent”).

1

Following the transfer and consolidation, O2 Micro communicated its intent to dismiss its

2

claims under the ‘129 Patent. (Brigham Decl., Exs. 3 and 4.) A stipulation was entered on

3

October 11, 2006 [“Oakland II stipulation”].

4

O2 Micro’s counsel represented that the Oakland II stipulation was prompted by the

5

absence of accused half-bridge inverter controllers in the consolidated cases. (See Brigham Decl.

6

Ex. 3) (“In light of the…limitation of the products at issue in [Oakland II] to MPS’ full-bridge

7

inverter controllers…O2 Micro intends to dismiss with prejudice its claim for infringement of the

8

‘129 Patent.”); (See also Brigham Decl. Ex. 4) (“If the defendants in those other cases do not use

9

half-bridge controllers, we suggest they raise the possibility of dismissing the ‘129 [Patent] in

10

their respective cases.”). O2 Micro’s intent is clear from the language of the stipulation itself,

11

which purports to extend only to future ‘129 Patent claims against MPS full-bridge inverters.

12

(Su Decl., Ex. C at 1.)2

13

Given the history of litigation between the parties, MPS reasonably believed a new suit on

14

the ‘129 Patent was imminent. MPS’s apprehension was not without cause. MPS continued to

15

innovate and expand its product offerings both before and after entry of the stipulation in

16

October, 2006. MPS began offering for sale new half-bridge inverter controllers marketed as the

17

MP1008. (Brigham Decl., Exs. 5 & 10.) MPS also began offering for sale new full-bridge

18

inverter controllers, including controllers marketed under the VION brand. MPS does not believe

19

these products infringe. Nevertheless, O2 Micro’s stated desire to accuse half-bridge products,

20

combined with the probability that O2 Micro would narrowly apply the covenant to only

21

specifically named full bridge products, placed MPS in the unenviable position of laboring under

22

the shadow of threatened infringement litigation.

The relevant portion of the stipulation reads:
O2 Micro covenants not to assert or reassert its ‘129 patent against named defendants for
infringement by MPS full bridge inverter controllers (and products incorporating said controllers)
made, used, imported, offered for sale or sold previously or currently having product designations
MP1010, MP1010B, MP1011, MP1012, MP1013, MP1015, MP1016, MP1018, MP1022,
MP1023, MP1024, MP1025, MP1026, MP1027, MP1029, MP1030, MP1031, MP1032, MP1035
and MP1038, evaluation boards EV0001, EV0002, EV0003, EV0004, EV0014, EV0017, EV0019,
EV0027, EV0031 and EV0037 incorporating certain of those inverter controllers.

C.

2

Meanwhile, despite the representation made and dismissal, O2 Micro continues to harass

3

MPS customers with the ‘129 Patent. While the transfer and consolidation of Oakland II played

4

out, O2 Micro sued an MPS customer, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (“Hon Hai”), on the ‘129

5

Patent in the Eastern District of Texas. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd. v. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.,

6

Case No. 05-0323 (filed July 18, 2005).

O2 Micro Continues to Sue MPS Customers on the ‘129 Patent.

7

O2 Micro, subsequent to the stipulation and jury verdict in Oakland II, is attempting to

8

amend its infringement contentions to accuse Hon Hai of infringing the ‘129 Patent through its

9

use of MPS products explicitly mentioned in the Oakland II stipulation. Accordingly, Hon Hai

10

moved for summary judgment, arguing the Oakland II stipulation resulted in an implied license

11

on those products. O2 Micro opposed, taking an unduly narrow interpretation of the stipulation:

12

The Stipulated Dismissal does not confer on MPS the right to practice the ‘129
patent or to sublicense its customers to do so. Rather, it merely contains a
promise by O2 Micro not to sue MPS for infringing the ‘129 patent with certain
products…. All that the Stipulated Dismissal provides to MPS is personal
immunity from suit for these particular acts of infringement.

13
14
15

*

16

*

*

O2 Micro’s covenant not to sue MPS on the ‘129 patent does not permit MPS to
make unconditioned sales of patented products.

17
18

(Brigham Decl., Ex. 6 [O2 Micro’s Sur-Reply to Hon Hai’s Motion for Summary Judgment], at 4,

19

7) (emphasis added). While Hon Hai’s motion remains pending, it is clear that O2 Micro is back

20

to its old forum-shopping ways. It dismissed its ‘129 Patent claims in this District to limit its

21

risks in a failing suit, only to resurrect those same claims in its preferred forum, the Eastern

22

District of Texas.

23

IV.

LEGAL STANDARD

24

The Supreme Court recently clarified the relationship between Article III’s jurisdictional

25

requirements and the Declaratory Judgment Act. MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., U.S., 127

S.Ct. 764 (2007).

Court advanced a broader standard reflecting the historical purpose of the Declaratory Judgment

2

Act—to provide a challenger with an alternative to the Hobson’s choice between “abandoning his

3

rights or risking prosecution.”

4

“definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.” Id.

5

at 771.

Id. at 773.

The new standard requires only that a dispute be

6

MedImmune has been interpreted as “lowering the bar for a plaintiff [bringing] a

7

declaratory judgment action in a patent dispute.” Frederick Goldman, Inc. v. West, 2007 WL

8

1989291, at *3 (S.D.N.Y July 6, 2007). Under MedImmune, a dispute is justiciable if it is “real

9

and substantial” and seeks “a decree of conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion

10

advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” 127 S.Ct. at 771 (citing Aetna

11

Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-41 (1937)). The standard is pragmatic and looks to

12

the totality of circumstances surrounding a particular dispute:
Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the
circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties
having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the
issuance of a declaratory judgment.

13
14
15
16

Id. at 771 (citing Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941)).

17

The Federal Circuit now addresses the question of declaratory jurisdiction “strictly on the

18

framework of MedImmune.” Benitec Australia, Ltd. v. Nucleonics, Inc., __ F.3d. __, Case No.

19

06-1122 at 10 (Fed. Cir., July 20, 2007).3 The Federal Circuit has applied MedImmune to expand

20

declaratory jurisdiction. See SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372 (2007)

21

(reversing dismissal of declaratory judgment action); Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Novartis Pharm.

22

Corp., 482 F.3d 1330 (2007) (same).

23

In SanDisk, the Federal Circuit held “Article III jurisdiction may be met where the

24

patentee takes a position that puts the declaratory judgment plaintiff in the position of either

25

pursuing arguably illegal behavior or abandoning that which he claims a right to do.” SanDisk,

Tellingly, O2 Micro relies exclusively on questionable precedent preceding MedImmune in arguing against
jurisdiction. See Benitec Australia, __ F.3d. __, Case No. 06-1122 at 9-10 (Fed. Cir., Jul. 20, 2007) (marginalizing
Super Sack Mfg. Corp. v. Chase Packaging Corp., 57 F.3d 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1995) and Amana Refrigeration, Inc. v.
Quadlux, Inc., 172 F.3d 852 (Fed. Cir. 1999) because they “applied the disapproved ‘reasonable apprehension of
imminent suit’ test.”). A copy of the Benitec Australia opinion is attached. (Brigham Decl., Ex. 7).

ARGUMENT

4

A.

5

O2 Micro’s attack on the face of the Complaint is without merit. When reviewing a

6

motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the courts assume that the allegations in the Complaint

7

are true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. Wolfe v. Strankman, 392 F.3d

8

358, 362 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1)).

9

following:

10
11
12

O2 Micro’s Facial Attack on the Complaint Is Meritless.

•

In its Complaint, MPS alleges the

O2 Micro has repeatedly asserted its patents against MPS, MPS’s

customers, and end-users of MPS’s power inverter controller products;
•

O2 Micro has filed lawsuits against MPS, MPS’s customers, and

13

end-users of MPS’s power inverter controller products, in which MPS products have

14

been accused of infringing O2 Micro patents, including the ‘129 Patent;

15
16
17

•

MPS has developed power inverter controller products that are not

accused of infringing in any pending lawsuit;
•

On information and belief, O2 Micro contends that these products,

18

and devices built using these products, infringe one or more of the ‘129 Patent’s claims

19

and that those claims are valid and enforceable; and

20
21

•

MPS denies that these products infringe any claim of the ‘129

The facts alleged in the Complaint are neither hypothetical nor speculative. Rather, the

7

Complaint reflects an actual controversy over the ‘129 Patent based on the long-standing legal

8

conflict between the parties, O2 Micro’s unduly narrow interpretation of the Oakland II

9

stipulation, O2 Micro’s continued forum shopping, and O2 Micro’s persistent harassment of MPS

10

customers. MPS is entitled to free itself from the haze of legal uncertainty surrounding its

11

marketing and selling of inverter controller products not explicitly named in the Oakland II

12

stipulation. MPS is also entitled to protect its financial interests and business relationships

against O2 Micro’s constant harassment.

There Is an Actual Controversy Between the Parties Over the ‘129 Patent.

O2 Micro Has Litigated and Is Aggressively Litigating the ‘129 Patent
Family.

16

The substantial history of litigation between MPS and O2 Micro over the ‘129 Patent

17

family cannot be ignored. The litigation history between parties is a critical factor in determining

18

whether an actual controversy exists. See Teva Pharm., 482 F.3d at 1344 (“[R]elated litigation

19

involving the same technology and the same parties is relevant in determining whether a

20

justiciable declaratory judgment controversy exists on other related patents.”); Cingular Wireless

22

litigation between the parties regarding the same technology showed a willingness on the part of

23

the defendant to pursue litigation). As detailed above, MPS and O2 Micro have a seven-year

24

history of litigation involving the technology at issue, including a prior litigation involving the

25

‘129 Patent and a continuing litigation over the same patent family. O2 Micro aggressively

26

O2 Micro also asserted the related ‘615 and ‘722 Patents against a different MPS

customer in a separate suit. O2 Micro Int’l, Ltd. v. Taiwan Sumida Elec., Inc., Case No. 03-0007

17

To put it mildly, O2 Micro has demonstrated little restraint in enforcing the ‘129 Patent

18

family against the world, and against MPS and its customers. O2 Micro’s aggressive approach to

19

enforcing its perceived patent rights counsel toward allowing MPS to pursue declaratory relief.

20

See e.g., SanDisk, 480 F.3d at 1383 (patentee’s “preparedness and willingness to enforce its

Even After the Stipulation, MPS Labored Under the Threat of
Litigation Over the ‘129 Patent.

3

The Declaratory Judgment Act “afford[s] relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and

4

controversy which the conflict between the parties has engendered.” Minnesota Mining & Mfg. v.

5

Norton Co., 929 F.2d 670 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (internal quotations omitted). Despite O2 Micro’s

6

carefully measured assurances in its Motion, after the stipulation MPS labored under the constant

7

uncertainty and insecurity of potential litigation under the ‘129 Patent. O2 Micro’s actions during

8

Oakland II signaled an intent to pursue ‘129 Patent claims against MPS’s new full-bridge and

9

half-bridge inverter controllers. Accordingly, MPS developed and marketed its new products

10

under a specter of uncertainty.

MPS continues to sell these products despite O2 Micro’s new

11

assertions that they are not afforded the protection of the stipulation.

12

For the first time in its Motion, O2 Micro takes an expansive reading of the stipulation.

13

Remarkably, O2 Micro now asserts that “[i]n the stipulation, O2 Micro agreed never to assert the

14

‘129 Patent against MPS.” (Mot. at 1.) If that is truly O2 Micro’s position, MPS agrees that there

15

is no real controversy. O2 Micro and MPS can quickly agree to an unambiguous amended

16

stipulation regarding the ‘129 Patent covering the sale, importation, and use of all present and

17

future MPS products, and dismiss this litigation.
But a closer reading of the Motion reveals that MPS is correct in being concerned that O2

18
19

Micro actually takes a narrow view of the stipulation. (See generally Mot. at 3.)

20

surface, O2 Micro believes that the stipulation is strictly limited to its express terms—that is, to

21

named MPS full-bridge products. In the Hon Hai litigation, O2 Micro has argued:
The Stipulated Dismissal does not confer on MPS the right to practice the ‘129
patent or to sublicense its customers to do so. Rather, it merely contains a
promise by O2 Micro not to sue MPS for infringing the ‘129 patent with certain
products…. All that the Stipulated Dismissal provides to MPS is personal
immunity from suit for these particular acts of infringement.

on the ‘129 Patent on products not previously accused of infringement in the earlier suit. Such

2

products include MPS’s half-bridge MP1008 product and new full-bridge products—products

3

currently being marketed and sold. Because of O2 Micro’s representations on the scope of the

4

stipulation, MPS and its customers are laboring under a cloud of uncertainty with respect to these

5

products, and one is facing new allegations in a suit in Texas.

6

These are the critical distinction that O2 Micro ignores in relying on Super Sack Mfg.

7

Corp. v. Chase Packaging Corp., 57 F.3d 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1995).

8

jurisdiction was not proper because the plaintiff “never contended that it [had] already taken

9

meaningful preparatory steps toward an infringing activity by planning to make a new product

10

that may later be said to infringe.” Id. at 1059-60. Because the new products were hypothetical,

11

the possibility of a future infringement suit was “simply too speculative.” Id. at 1060. By

12

measurable contrast, MPS’s apprehension is based on real—not hypothetical—products. MPS

13

has not merely planned new products not named in the stipulation, it is currently manufacturing

14

and selling them. Contrary to the plaintiff in Super Sack, MPS is engaged in present activity

15

which places it at risk of O2 Micro arguing for infringement liability. Id. at 1059 (discussing the

16

second requirement of the pre-MedImmune test for justiciability).

In Super Sack, declaratory

In view of MedImmune, O2 Micro’s reliance on Sharper Image is also misplaced.

18

Sharper Image Corp. v. Honeywell Inter., Inc., 2005 WL 2176903 (N.D. Cal.). Applying the now

19

rejected standard, Sharper Image concluded that a declaratory judgment plaintiff did not have a

20

“reasonable apprehension” of facing a suit over its products that were not included in a stipulated

21

dismissal. Id. at *3. Significantly, the district court implied that the dispute was not ripe for

22

adjudication until the patentee accused the new products of infringement. Id. at *2 (concluding

23

that dismissing the counterclaims for declaratory judgment would not preclude the defense “in a

24

future action accusing the products that are not in suit here”). Essentially, Sharper Image forced

the would-be challenger into a Hobson’s choice—of either abandoning his rights or risking

This is precisely the result the Supreme Court rejected in

O2 Micro’s Harassment of MPS Customers Establishes an Actual
Case or Controversy.

5

O2 Micro continues to harass MPS’s customers with the ‘129 Patent. O2 Micro is still

6

asserting the ‘129 Patent against one MPS customer, Hon Hai. Less than a month after the

7

stipulation was entered, O2 Micro also threatened litigation against at least one other MPS

8

customer. (See e.g. Brigham Decl, Ex. 8.) Remarkably, O2 Micro asserts its methodical pursuit

9

of MPS customers under the ‘129 Patent is of no moment. O2 Micro argues that MPS does not

10

have a protectable interest in the Hon Hai litigation because “MPS has not alleged it is required to

11

indemnify Hon Hai for infringement for the ‘129 Patent.” (Motion at 10.) Regardless of the

12

existence of a formal indemnity agreement, MPS is harmed by O2 Micro’s attacks on its

13

customers. O2 Micro is pressuring MPS by using its customers as proxies. O2 Micro’s actions

14

injure MPS by damaging its goodwill with current customers and by “souring the milk” in

15

negotiations with potential customers.

16

MPS has protectable interest in its customer relationships. This District has held, even

17

under the more restrictive “reasonable apprehension” standard, that a patentee’s litigation against

18

a challenger’s customers is enough to establish declaratory jurisdiction:

19
20
21

Defendant has initiated a suit against several of Plaintiff’s customers in the
District of Delaware. Thus, there can be no doubt regarding Defendant’s intent to
enforce its patents against such customers. Thus, based on Arrowhead, the Court
finds that the ‘reasonable apprehension’ requirement has been satisfied.

Court distinguished several opinions relied upon by O2 Micro because “neither case involved

customer suits.” Id. (distinguishing Super Sack, 57 F.3d 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1995) and Intellectual

Two recent opinions further demonstrate that O2 Micro’s persistent attacks on an MPS

customer support declaratory jurisdiction, regardless of the existence of a formal indemnity

agreement. WS Packaging Group, Inc. v. Global Commerce Group, LLC, 2007 WL 205559, at

*4 (E.D. Wis. Jan. 24, 2007) [Global I]; WS Packaging Group, Inc. v. Global Commerce Group,

5

LLC, 2007 WL 1394154 (E.D. Wis. May 11, 2007) [Global II]. Central to Global’s argument in

6

both cases was its covenant not to sue WS. Global argued (as O2 Micro does here) that the

7

covenant eliminated any controversy between the parties over the patent at issue.6 In Global I,

8

decided before the Federal Circuit acknowledged that MedImmune overruled its two-prong test,

9

Global’s motion to dismiss was denied. The court agreed that a case or controversy still existed

10

because Global was threatening WS’s customers with suit for infringement over the same patent.

11

Global I, at *2. The court held jurisdiction was proper because WS had agreed to indemnify its

12

customers, thereby exposing WS to legal harm. Id. at *3.

13

In response to Global I, Global amended its covenant not to sue to include customers

14

indemnified by WS. Global II, 2007 WL 1394154, at *2. The amended covenant directly

15

addressed the Global I opinion and should have extinguished any case or controversy. However,

16

the court again denied Global’s motion to dismiss, relying on the new standard announced by

17

MedImmune, as clarified by the Federal Circuit in SanDisk and Teva. Id. at *3-4. The court held

18

jurisdiction remained proper because Global’s threats were causing injury to WS in the form of

19

potential loss of customers and reputation. Global II, 2007 WL 1394154, at *4 (“Beyond the

20

injury that might arise from having to indemnify customers, WS faces the loss of its customer

21

base and reputation in these circumstances.”). In addition, even without an indemnity agreement,

22

WS could still face liability from its customers under state law. Id.

23

circumstances, the court decided the best approach was to let the parties clear the air so that

24

Global would stop its “scare-the-customer-and-run tactics that infect the competitive environment

Indeed, the facts in the instant case establish a even more compelling case for jurisdiction. In Global I, the parties
did not dispute that the stipulation extinguished Global’s ability to sue WS itself on the patent. 2007 WL 205559, at
*2. By contrast, MPS and O2 Micro dispute the impact of the Oakland II stipulation on O2 Micro’s ability to sue
MPS on products not explicitly mentioned.

Washington, D.C. v. Kline & Son Cement Repair, Inc., 474 F.Supp.2d 779, 784 (E.D. Va. 2007).

It is undisputed that this Court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction over a properly brought

10

declaratory judgment action. However, a district court must have good reason for doing so. See

11

EMC Corp. v. Norand Corp., 89 F.3d 807, 813 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (“the district court’s discretion is

12

not unfettered. A district court, for example, cannot decline to entertain [a declaratory judgment]

13

action as a matter of whim or personal disinclination.”). No good reason exists for this Court to

decline to hear MPS’s claims. Rather, both the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act and

judicial economy7 counsel toward resolving this controversy before this Court.

As outlined above, the ‘129 Patent is intimately related to two patents previously litigated before

this Court. The ‘129 Patent is a continuation of the ‘722 Patent, which in turn is a continuation of

19

the ‘615 Patent. The patents share a priority date and have a common specification. In 2004, this

20

Court held that MPS did not infringe claims of the ‘615 Patent, the grandparent of the ‘129

Patent. (Brigham Decl., Ex 1.) More recently, this Court presided over a two-week trial resulting

O2 Micro argues that considering MPS’s claims “would only lead to a waste of judicial resources.” (Mot. at 12.)
Quite frankly, O2 Micro lacks credibility to advocate for judicial economy. With a suit already pending in this Court
on the ‘722 Patent, O2 Micro brought its related ‘129 Patent claims by filing a new suit in Texas. This Court later
recognized O2 Micro’s strategy for what it was—forum shopping. (Brigham Decl., Ex. 9 at 7-8) (“If either party has
engaged in forum shopping, it is O2 Micro, which chose to sue in Texas at a time when it had two lawsuits against
MPS pending in this District.”)

Because of the similarities across the patents, this litigation will raise similar issues. The

2

Court’s familiarity with the common invalidity and inequitable conduct positions will promote

3

judicial economy and advance an equitable result.

4

experience with the patent family includes:

Highlights of this Court’s substantial

5

•

Granting non-infringement of the ‘615 Patent;

6

•

Subsequent finding of collateral estoppel precluding O2 Micro from enforcing the

7

‘615 Patent against other MPS customers;
•

8
9

Pending unfair competition claims based on O2 Micro’s bad faith efforts to use the
‘615 Patent to improve its market position;

•

10
11

Recent completion of its second trial involving the accused patents and/or
technology; and

•

12
13

Granting summary judgment that O2 Micro is not entitled to damages for any
infringement of any of these three patents.

14

This Court is also well-versed on the evidence related to the invalidity and

15

unenforceability of the ‘129 Patent. There is substantial overlap between the prior art relevant to

16

the ‘722 and ‘129 Patents. Having just completed a two-week trial involving the ‘722 Patent

17

resulting in an invalidity verdict, this Court is already familiar with evidence MPS intends to use

18

to invalidate the ‘129 Patent in this litigation. Furthermore, there is substantial overlap between

19

MPS’s ‘722 Patent and ‘129 Patent inequitable conduct claims.

20

In short, this Court has developed an extensive understanding of the parties, the asserted

21

patents, the technology, and the legal and evidentiary arguments related to this dispute. The

22

interests of judicial economy, fairness, and justice all counsel toward having this Court resolve

23

MPS’s claims.

For the foregoing reasons, O2 Micro’s motion should be denied.
