UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
IN AND FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
MIAMI DIVISION
Case No. 1:14-cv-21884-BB
DEBRA HARRIS and BARBARA
STARK, on behalf of themselves
and all others similarly situated,
Plaintiffs,
v.
NORDYNE, LLC,
Defendant.
____________________________/
PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT
Plaintiffs, Debra Harris and Barbara Stark, on behalf of themselves and all others
similarly situated (“Plaintiffs”), by and through the undersigned counsel, submit this response in
opposition to the Motion to Dismiss Class Action Complaint filed by Defendant, Nordyne, LLC
(“Defendant”). (Doc. 10). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant’s Motion should be
denied.
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs filed this class action on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated
Florida consumers who purchased residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”)
systems manufactured, distributed and sold by Defendant, Nordyne, LLC.

As alleged in the

Complaint, these HVAC units uniformly included defective copper evaporator coils that caused the
HVAC units to prematurely fail, thereby damaging consumers in the form of unanticipated
refrigerant leaks and associated labor costs. Despite knowing the defective evaporator coils would be
unknown to and not easily discoverable by consumers, Defendant failed to adequately disclose the

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 2 of 21

defect to consumers or to otherwise cure the defect. Plaintiffs and putative Class Members would not
have purchased HVAC systems manufactured by Defendant, or would have paid less for their HVAC
systems, had they known about the defect. Based upon these allegations, Plaintiffs have properly
pled claims against Defendant for violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act
(“FDUTPA”) and Unjust Enrichment.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiffs in this action are purchasers of Nordyne HVAC units sold under the brand names
Broan and Frigidaire, who suffered and sustained financial loss as a result of Defendant’s deceptive
and unfair conduct. Defendant Nordyne manufactures, distributes and sells HVAC systems under the
brand names of Broan, Frigidaire, Maytag, NuTone, Tappan, Westinghouse, Intertherm, Miller,
Broan Manufactured Housing, Gibson, Kelvinator, Philco and Mammoth. (Compl. ¶7). Nordyne
represents itself to the public as a “trusted name in the industry” that has been “designing and
manufacturing reliable heating and cooling products for more than 90 years.”

(Compl. ¶11).

Nordyne further represents that it “focuses on creating genuine value for its customers through a
unique combination of innovation, product performance and responsive support.” (Compl. ¶11).
Notwithstanding these representations, Nordyne systemically and uniformly manufactured,
distributed and sold defective HVAC systems into the stream of commerce, to the detriment of
consumers, including Plaintiffs and Class Members.
HVAC systems, like those manufactured by Nordyne, include an air handler component
which contains an evaporator coil that cools air within the home. When air passes through the coil,
refrigerant contained within the coil absorbs heat from the air and sends it back into the home in the
form of cool air. Refrigerant is not consumed in the process and is only lost if there is a leak in the
evaporator coil. Nordyne manufactured its HVAC systems to include evaporator coils with copper
tubing, which is susceptible to formicary corrosion. Formicary corrosion ultimately causes copper
coils to fail and refrigerant to leak from the corrosion-induced holes or cracks in the coils, which

2

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 3 of 21

prevents the HVAC system from generating cool air. Formicary corrosion also requires consumers
to repeatedly and prematurely refill their HVAC units with refrigerant, which is a significant
expense.
Nordyne knew that the copper coils within its HVAC units were vulnerable to formicary
corrosion, and that alternative designs, which were not likewise susceptible to formicary corrosion,
were available for use in its HVAC units. (Compl. ¶19). Despite knowledge that use of these
alternative designs would have prevented the premature coil failure, Nordyne continued using the
problematic copper evaporator coils in its air handlers through at least 2012. (Compl. ¶19). Nordyne
also continued to manufacture, distribute and sell HVAC systems with defective evaporator coils to
consumers in Florida, during which time Nordyne failed to disclose this defect to its consumers,
along with the availability of replacement coils that are not susceptible to formicary corrosion.
Both Plaintiffs in this action purchased Nordyne HVAC units with defective evaporator coils.
Likewise, both Plaintiffs’ units prematurely failed as a result of these defective evaporator coils,
causing Plaintiffs to incur damages – specifically, the replacement of the refrigerant and associated
labor costs. As alleged in the Complaint, had Plaintiffs and Class Members known of the defect and
costs associated with the premature failure of their HVAC units, they would not have purchased the
HVAC units or would have paid less for them. (Compl. ¶¶4, 29, 38, 46, 66).
Defendant attempts to escape liability for its deceptive and unfair conduct by arguing that
Plaintiffs have not identified any unfair or deceptive act or practice, have not established causation,
and have not pled their FDUTPA claim with the particularity required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. In doing so, Defendant misinterprets well-established law and attempts to
inject a series of unfounded assertions that are entirely contrary to the clear intent of FDUTPA. As
discussed below, there is substantial legal authority supporting Plaintiffs’ FDUTPA claims, which
more than adequately plead an unfair or deceptive act or practice and the requisite causation.

3

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 4 of 21

Further, while the law in this District requires Plaintiffs to meet the liberal pleading requirements of
Rule 8, Plaintiffs have more than adequately pled their FDUTPA claim to provide Defendant with
the requisite notice under both Rule 8 and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Defendant also contends that Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim cannot proceed because an
adequate remedy at law exists under FDUTPA, and because of the existence of an express warranty,
which conveniently does not cover the claims at issue. However, as described herein, it is well
established that Plaintiffs may assert alternative claims, and Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that there
is not an adequate remedy at law. In addition, the express warranty that Defendant references did not
constitute an express contract capable of eliminating Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim.
Finally, Defendant suggests that Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed on the basis that
Plaintiffs have not adequately pled diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1332(d) because
Defendant is a limited liability corporation (“LLC”), which allegedly required Plaintiffs to plead the
citizenship of each member of Defendant’s LLC.

However, Defendant cites no binding legal

authority to support this contention. Moreover, this argument is a red herring, as the managing
member of Nordyne is principally located in Rhode Island, which Defendant failed to acknowledge
in its Motion or disclose in its Initial Disclosures pursuant to Rule 26.
LEGAL STANDARD
When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept all facts alleged as true, and the
complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Rosenthal Collins Group,
LLC v. Moneytec, LLC, Case No. 08-60992-CIV, 2010 WL 556382, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 11, 2010).
Even after the Supreme Court’s decisions in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) and Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), a complaint need only state facts sufficient to raise the right
to relief above a speculative level. Gelfound v. Metlife Ins. Co. of Connecticut, Case No. 13-80479CIV, 2014 WL 584214, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 14, 2014). “The threshold is exceedingly low for a
complaint to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be

granted.” AXA Equitable Life Insurance Co. v. Infinity Financial Group LLC, et al., 608 F.Supp.2d
1349, 1353 (S.D. Fla. 2009). This jurisdiction has made it clear that “a motion to dismiss for failure
to state a claim is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.” Gasper v. Louisiana Stadium, 577
F.2d 897, 900 (5th Cir. 1978) (citing Madison v. Purdy, 410 F.2d 99, 100 (5th Cir. 1969)). When

ARGUMENTS
A. The Complaint Adequately States a Claim for Violation of the Florida Deceptive
and Unfair Trade Practices Act

The allegations set forth in Plaintiffs’ Complaint are more than sufficient to show that
Nordyne violated FDUTPA. A claim for damages under FDUTPA has three elements: (1) a
deceptive act or unfair practice; (2) causation; and (3) actual damages. See Rollins, Inc. v.
Butland, 951 So. 2d 860, 869 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006); Martorella v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co.,
2013 WL 1137514, at *3 (S.D. Fla. 2013); Galstaldi v. Sunvest Communities USA, LLC, 637 F.
Supp. 2d 1045, 1056 (S.D. Fla. 2009); Gavron v. Weather Shield Mfg., Inc., 819 F. Supp. 2d
1297, 1300 (S.D. Fla. 2011). Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled all three elements.
1. The FDUTPA Claim Is Not Subject to the Heightened Pleading
Requirements of Rule 9(b).
Defendant argues without merit that Plaintiffs have not pled their FDUTPA claim with
the particularity required by Rule 9(b).

However, courts in this District have specifically

recognized that the requirements of Rule 9(b) do not apply to FDUTPA claims and thus "the
heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) cannot serve as a basis to dismiss FDUTPA
claims." Guerrero v. Target Corp., 889 F.Supp.2d 1346, 1354 (S.D. Fla. 2012); Costa v.
Kerzner Int'l Resorts, Inc., Case No. 11-60663-CV-COHN, 2011 WL 2519244, at * 2 (S.D. Fla.
Jun. 23, 2011); Gastaldi v. Sunvest Communities USA, LLC, 637 F. Supp. 2d 1045 (S.D. Fla.
5

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 6 of 21

2009). Thus, a claim under FDUTPA need only meet the notice-pleading requirements of Rule
8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Id. Plaintiffs have adequately pled a claim for
FDUTPA pursuant to the liberal pleading requirements of Rule 8, and dismissal of Plaintiffs'
FDUTPA claim is not warranted.
However, whether Rule 8 or Rule 9(b) applies to Plaintiffs’ claims is of no consequence,
as Plaintiffs have more than adequately pled their FDUTPA claim to meet the heightened
particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). The detailed Complaint alleges the exact nature of the
defect, including that the defective evaporator coils have caused Nordyne’s HVAC systems to
prematurely fail due to the leakage of refrigerant stored within the coils. (Compl. ¶2). It further
alleges that Nordyne knew of the defective evaporator coils in its HVAC units prior to selling
them to Plaintiffs, but that it nevertheless continued to sell the HVAC units to consumers while
failing to disclose the defect to unsuspecting consumers, thereby taking away their bargaining
power to negotiate the diminished value of the product. (Compl. ¶¶19, 20, 22, 23, 63, 64).
Plaintiffs further allege that, as a result of Nordyne’s failure to disclose the subject defect to
consumers or to otherwise correct it, Nordyne engaged in unconscionable, deceptive and unfair
business practices, causing damages to Plaintiffs and Class Members, who reasonably expected
that Nordyne’s HVAC systems would not be defective and would function as intended. (Compl.
¶26).
With respect to both Class Representatives, the Complaint includes allegations of when
Ms. Harris and Ms. Stark purchased the subject HVAC units (Compl. ¶¶31, 40); the amounts that
they Plaintiff paid for their respective HVAC units (Compl. ¶¶32, 41); the dates of the
installations of their HVAC units (Compl. ¶¶33, 41); the time period during which their units
prematurely failed as a result of the defective evaporator coils (Compl. ¶¶34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42,

6

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 7 of 21

43); the steps that both Plaintiffs took to identify – and attempt to remedy – the nature of the
undisclosed defect (Compl. ¶¶35, 44); the out-of-pocket costs that both Plaintiffs incurred to
repair the undisclosed defect (Compl. ¶¶37, 45); and that both Plaintiffs would not have
purchased the HVAC units, or would have paid less for them, had they known about the
defective evaporator coils (Compl. ¶¶38, 46). In sum, these detailed allegations are more than
sufficient to meet the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).
2. Plaintiffs Have Adequately Alleged That Defendant Engaged in a
Deceptive and Unfair Course of Conduct.
Defendant maintains that Plaintiffs’ FDUTPA claim fails because they do not allege that
Defendant engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice. In doing so, Defendant ignores both
the detailed allegations in the Complaint and the clear intent of FDUTPA, which is “[t]o protect
the consuming public and legitimate business enterprises from those who engage in unfair
methods of competition, or unconscionable, deceptive, or unfair acts or practices in the conduct
of any trade or commerce” and is expressly intended to be liberally construed. Fla. Stat. §
501.202(2). Davis v. Powertel, Inc., 776 So. 2d 971, 973 (Fla. 1st DCA 2000).
While “FDUTPA itself does not define the elements of a cause of action for unfair trade
practices[,] …the standards of unfairness and deception for purposes of the FDUTPA are set
forth and interpreted by the Federal Trade Commission or the federal courts.” Gold Coast, 2006
WL 4579688, at *2 (citing Fla. Stat. §501.204(1) and §501.203(3)(b)). As interpreted by the
federal courts, “an unfair practice is ‘one that offends established public policy,’ or is ‘immoral,
unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.’” Martorella, 2013
WL 1137514, at *4 (citation omitted). Further, the Florida Supreme Court has noted that
“deception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the
consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment.” PNR, Inc. v.
7

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 8 of 21

Beacon Prop. Mgmt., Inc., 842 So.2d 773, 777 (Fla. 2003) (internal citations omitted).
Accordingly, FDUTPA explicitly allows for “omissions” to serve as a basis for allegations of
deceptive and unfair conduct.
Despite Defendant’s flagrant misinterpretation that FDUTPA only encompasses
egregious conduct, it is well established that FDUTPA should be liberally construed and the
scope of the conduct that may constitute a violation of the statute is extremely broad. 1 Citibank
(South Dakota) N.A. v. Nat'l Arbitration Council, Inc., No. 3:04-cv-1076-J-32MCR, 2006 WL
2691528, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 19, 2006) (finding that “[s]ince FDUTPA does not clearly define
what constitutes “unfair and deceptive,” courts have held that “the statute should be construed
liberally,” and that the concept should be regarded as “extremely broad.””) (citation omitted);
Davis, 776 So. 2d at 973 (indicating that FDUTPA must be liberally construed in order to
promote the policy of “protect[ing] the consuming public”); Dorestin v. Hollywood Imports, Inc.,
45 So.3d 819, 826, 832 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) (same).
When interpreting the liberal requirements of FDUTPA, courts have upheld and certified
class action claims regarding a manufacturer knowing of and failing to disclose product defects.
See Davis, 776 So.2d at 973 (granting class certification to FDUTPA claim where “[t]he

1

Defendant cites In re Fla. Cement & Concrete Antitrust Litig., 746 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1321
(S.D. Fla. 2010), Scott v. Capital One Bank & Capital One Servs., Case No. 8:08-cv-132-T30EAJ, 2008 WL 2157037, at *2-3 (M.D. Fla. May 20, 2008) and H & J Paving of Fla., Inc. v.
Nextel, Inc., 849 So.2d 1099, 1100 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003) for the proposition that FDUTPA only
encompasses egregious conduct, likening it to the Sherman Act, predatory lending practices or
the sale of “useless and obsolete” equipment. This is a complete mischaracterization of the
liberal intent of FDUTPA and incredibly misleading. Indeed, in Scott, the court denied
defendant’s motion to dismiss the FDUTPA claim and, in doing so, did nothing to suggest that
its ruling was limited to predatory lending practices, as Defendant suggests. Instead, the court
confirmed FDUTPA’s applicability to actions based upon omissions when it allowed the plaintiff
to proceed with a FDUTPA claim predicated upon the defendant’s “fail[ure] to provide adequate
information regarding Payment Protection coverage and restrictions prior to selling the product
to consumers.” Scott, 2008 WL 2157037, at *2-3.
8

common feature of the class claims, according to the plaintiffs, was that Powertel's alleged
nondisclosure had reduced the value of the phone in each case.”) (emphasis added). Thus, a
FDUTPA claim may rely upon a defendant’s alleged omissions, as opposed to alleging or
identifying specific misrepresentations. Here, Nordyne’s knowledge of the defective copper
coils, coupled with its failure to repair or disclose the defect to unsuspecting consumers, is a
deceptive and unfair practice.
In Matthews v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Case No. 12-60630-CIV, 2012 WL
2520675, at *2-3 (S.D. Fla. 2012), the plaintiff brought a FDUTPA claim based upon allegations
that the defendant manufactured and sold vehicles with a latent defect that did not manifest itself
within the applicable warranty period, and that the defendant knew of the defect, but failed to
disclose it to consumers. In that case, the defendant sought to dismiss the plaintiff’s claims on
the basis that the plaintiff did not allege either an affirmative misrepresentation or a defect
involving safety issues. The Court rejected those arguments and, in doing so, reiterated wellestablished law that an “[a]n unfair practice is one that offends established public policy and one
that is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers,” and
“deception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the
consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment.” Id. (citing PNR,
Inc. v. Beacon Prop. Mgmt., Inc., 842 So.2d 773, 777 (Fla. 2003)). Relying upon this firm legal
tenet, the Court also acknowledged that the law “require[es] liberal construction of FDUTPA in
order to promote the policy of ‘protect[ing] the consuming public,’” and found that the plaintiff
sufficiently alleged an unfair or deceptive trade practice with allegations that the defendant
“knowingly fail[ed] to disclose a material defect that diminishes a product’s value.” Id. (citing
Fla. Stat. §501.202(2)).

9

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 10 of 21

Similarly, in Doll v. Ford Motor Co., 814 F.Supp.2d 526, 548-549 (D. MD. 2011), the
court found that the plaintiff adequately alleged a claim under the liberal pleading requirements
of FDUTPA, among other consumer protection statutes in various states, where the plaintiff
alleged that the defendant knew of a defect in the product at issue, concealed its knowledge of
the defect from plaintiff and class members, and where the plaintiff alleged that he would have
paid significantly less for the vehicle or would not have purchased the vehicle if he knew of the
defect. See Barnext v. Offshore, LTD., v. Ferretti Group USA, Inc., Case No. 10-23869-CIV,
2012 WL 1570057, at *7 (S.D. Fla. May 2, 2012) (court allowed the plaintiff to proceed with a
FDUTPA claim where allegations of the defendant’s “unfair or deceptive acts at issue relate[d]
to Defendants' involvement in placing an air conditioner with components, known to ignite fires,
into the stream of commerce.”); Gavron v. WeatherShield Mfg., Inc., 819 F. Supp. 2d 1297, 1300
(S.D. Fla. 2011) (court found that plaintiff adequately pled a FDUTPA claim with respect to the
sale of defective windows where plaintiff did not rely on any of defendant’s alleged
misrepresentations and plaintiff alleged that defendant knew consumers were unaware of defects
and that the defects “would defeat the consumers’ ordinary, foreseeable, and reasonable
expectations concerning the performance of [the] doors and windows”).
Here, Plaintiffs have more than sufficiently pled facts supporting Defendant’s unfair or
deceptive acts or practices. This matter is properly founded upon Defendant’s failure to disclose
to consumers that its HVAC systems had defective evaporator coils, which compromised the
performance of the HVAC systems and caused consumers to incur unanticipated out-of-pocket
expenses for refrigerant and associated labor costs, along with increased utility bills, thereby
diminishing the value of the HVAC units. Defendant attempts to gloss over these facts by
arguing that this case is based upon simple puffery, and that Plaintiffs have merely cited

10

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 11 of 21

formulaic recitations of the elements of FDUTPA. These assertions are completely inaccurate.
This case is about Defendant’s deceptive representations and omissions that misled consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances, and led to actual damages, as detailed by the
following allegations in the Complaint:
1.

Nordyne manufactured, distributed and sold HVAC systems that it knew contained

materially defective copper evaporator coils that would fail prematurely under normal use.

(Compl. ¶ 64);
2.

Despite this knowledge, Nordyne failed to disclose or otherwise notify Plaintiffs and

putative Class Members of these adverse material facts, including the inherent likelihood of
premature failure of the HVAC systems, the likelihood of formicary corrosion, leaking of
refrigerant, and unanticipated out-of-pocket expenses in connection with repairs associated
with the defective coils. (Compl. ¶¶ 20, 64);

3.

These defects interfered with Plaintiffs and putative Class Members’ reasonable

expectations concerning the performance of the HVAC systems manufactured by Defendant,
and caused injury to Plaintiffs and putative Class Members. (Compl. ¶ 64);

4.

Nordyne knew the defect within the copper evaporator coils was unknown to and

would not be discovered by Plaintiffs and putative Class Members and would defeat their
ordinary, foreseeable and reasonable expectations concerning the performance of its HVAC
systems. (Compl. ¶¶ 21, 64);

5.

Rather than remedy the defect or inform consumers of the defect, Nordyne continued

to manufacture and distribute HVAC systems to Florida consumers without disclosing the
defect to these consumers. (Compl. ¶ 22);

11

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 12 of 21

6.

Nordyne knew that the design defects in its evaporator coils would cause them to

develop formicary corrosion, making them unreasonably susceptible to premature rupture
and refrigerant leaks when used under normal conditions. (Compl. ¶ 64);
7.

By failing to disclose that its HVAC systems contained defective evaporator coils

that caused premature failure of the units, Nordyne engaged in unconscionable, deceptive and
unfair business practices, causing damages to Plaintiffs and Class Members, who reasonably
expected that Nordyne’s HVAC systems would not be defective and would function as
intended. (Compl. ¶ 26); and

8.

Plaintiffs and putative Class Members would not have purchased the HVAC

systems manufactured by Nordyne, or would have paid less for the HVAC systems, had
they known about the defective evaporator coils. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 38, 46).
These allegations are more than adequate to state a FDUTPA claim in a case alleging unfair or
deceptive conduct regarding Defendant’s sale of a defective product to unsuspecting consumers.
See Collins v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 894 So.2d 988, 989 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004) (court found
plaintiff adequately stated a claim under FDUTPA where plaintiff alleged seatbelts were
defective, defendant knew or should have known of defect but took no action to remedy the
problem, and plaintiff based decision to purchase a Chrysler in part on reputation for safety);
James D. Hinson Elec. Contracting Co., Inc. v. Bellsouth Telecomms., Inc., Case No. 3:07-cv598-J-32MCR, 2008 WL 360803, at *3 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (court found that in order to adequately
plead a FDUTPA claim, a plaintiff need not allege that the defendant advertised or sold anything
of value to the plaintiff, and to require otherwise “would stand contrary to the express holdings
of other courts.”).
Nordyne further mischaracterizes Plaintiffs’ factual allegations and asks the Court to rely
upon unfounded assumptions in Defendant’s favor. For example, Nordyne argues that Plaintiffs have

12

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 13 of 21

alleged adequate disclosure of the defect, but no such allegation exists. 2 Plaintiffs clearly allege that
they were unaware of the defect in their HVAC units, and that if they had knowledge of the defect,
they would not have purchased the HVAC units or would have paid less for them.

Further, Defendant’s application of a limited warranty that intentionally excludes a
known defect is a violation of the FDUTPA. Doll v. Ford Motor Co., 814 F.Supp.2d 526, 54849 (D. MD. 2011) (finding plaintiff adequately alleged a claim under the Maine Unfair Trade
Practices Act, which, like FDUTPA, declares unlawful “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in
the conduct of any trade or commerce,” where plaintiff alleged that defendant intentionally
limited its warranty to exclude a known defect, concealed the existence of the defect, sold a
defective product that required prohibitively high repair costs, and alleged that he would not
have bought the product had defendant adequately disclosed the defect). Given the above,
Plaintiffs have adequately alleged Defendant’s violations of FDUTPA.
3. Plaintiffs Have Alleged Causation and Recoverable Damages.
Defendant argues, without merit, that actual reliance or the objective possibility of
reliance by a reasonable consumer is required for a FDUTPA claim. In doing so, Defendant
seeks to inject a reliance requirement into the causation element of FDUTPA that does not exist.
The Act simply does not require reliance in any form. Davis, 776 So. 2d at 973, review denied,
794 So. 2d 605 (Fla. 2001) (“A party asserting a deceptive trade practice claim need not show
actual reliance on the representation or omission at issue.”). Rather, the FDUTPA focuses on
whether an act is unfair or deceptive, and whether the representation or omissions at issue would
2

Defendant points to Plaintiffs’ allegation in paragraph 19 of the Complaint, wherein Plaintiffs
allege that Nordyne conceded on its website that the copper coils in its HVAC units were
susceptible to certain household items. However, nowhere in the Complaint do Plaintiffs allege
that they viewed, or were even aware of this disclosure. In addition, this disclosure was made
after both Plaintiffs purchased their HVAC units. Nonetheless, the adequacy of this disclosure is
not appropriately determined at the motion to dismiss stage, and is more suitable for the
summary judgment stage.

deceive an objectively reasonably person, not whether an individual plaintiff relied upon a
certain representation or omission.
Indeed, because “[t]he FDUTPA ‘is designed to protect not only the rights of litigants,
but also the rights of the consuming public at large[,]’” to impute a requirement for individual
reliance would interfere with the broad remedial purposes of the statute. Gold Coast Racing, Inc.
v. The Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., No. 05-61931-CIV, 2006 WL 4579688, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 6,
2006) (“Gold Coast”) (quoting Davis, 776 So.2d at 975) (class action for damages under
FDUTPA does not require allegation that individual members of class relied on act or omission
that is alleged to be unlawful). So “[w]hen addressing a deceptive or unfair trade practice claim,
the issue is not whether the plaintiff actually relied on the alleged practice, but whether the
practice was likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the same circumstances…” Gold
Coast, 2006 WL 4579688, at *2 (citing Davis, 776 So.2d at 973-74). See Gavron v. Weather
Shield Mfg., Inc., 819 F.Supp.2d 1297, 1301 (S.D. Fla. 2011); Fitzpatrick v. General Mills, Inc.,
635 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir. 2011); State, Office of Attorney Gen., Dep't of Legal Affairs v.
Commerce Commercial Leasing, LLC, 946 So. 2d 1253, 1258 (Fla. 1st DCA 2007) (“A
deceptive or unfair trade practice constitutes a somewhat unique tortious act because, although it
is similar to a claim of fraud, it is different in that, unlike fraud, a party asserting a deceptive
trade practice claim need not show actual reliance on the representation or omission at issue.”).
Further, a deceptive practice can damage a consumer even if the consumer does not rely on the
deceptive practice when purchasing a particular product. See Nelson v. Mead Johnson Nutrition
Co., 270 F.R.D. 689, 692 n. 2 (S.D. Fla. 2010). Hence, a plaintiff need not allege reliance on a
deceptive or unfair representation or omission in order to state a claim under FDUTPA, or to
establish the causation element of the FDUTPA.

14

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 15 of 21

Defendant also misconstrues the FDUTPA in arguing that Plaintiffs must have read or
heard specific representations that lead to an injury. As discussed above, FDUTPA expressly
allows for claims based upon deceptive representations or omissions that are likely to mislead
consumers. PNR, Inc., 842 So.2d at 777. Accordingly, FDUTPA does not require that Plaintiffs
or Class Members actually saw or relied upon Defendant’s deceptive representations, particularly
where, as here, the deceptive and unfair conduct at issue relates to a product that is integral to
Defendant’s business, which Defendant is distributing into the stream of commerce to unwitting
consumers. See James D. Hinson Elec. Contracting Co., Inc., 2008 WL 360803, at *3 (finding
that plaintiff adequately stated a FDUTPA claim, despite the fact that defendant did advertise,
solicit or provide something of value to plaintiff, where the defendant was “generally involved in
the offering of telecommunications services to the general public” and the conduct complained
of was an integral part of defendant’s business); Gold Coast, 2006 WL 4579688, at *2.
Defendant’s baseless arguments conveniently ignore Plaintiffs’ allegations that, as a
result of Defendant’s unfair and deceptive trade practices, Plaintiffs did not know at the time of
their installation that the HVAC units were defective. As alleged in the Complaint, when
Plaintiffs purchased their HVAC units, they reasonably believed they would function as intended
and that they were not defective. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant concealed the defect,
and that, if Plaintiffs had known of the defect, they would not have purchased the products or
would have paid less for them. Given these allegations, damages under FDUTPA are properly
measured by the difference between the value of the HVAC units with non-defective parts and
the value of the HVAC units, as delivered with defective evaporator coils. In re Porsche Cars
North America, Inc., 880 F.Supp.2d 801 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (allowing plaintiff to proceed with a
FDUTPA claim based upon the diminished value of his vehicle, which was measured as the

15

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 16 of 21

difference between the value of the vehicle with non-defective parts and the value of the vehicle
as delivered with defective coolant tubes). In other words, Plaintiffs and Class Members have
been damaged by the diminution in value of the HVAC units purchased, which is the proper
measure of damages under the FDUTPA. Matthews, 2012 WL 2520675, at *2-3 (citing Davis,
776 So. 2d at 973) (“…Florida courts have recognized that a FDUTPA claim is stated where the
defendant knowingly fails to disclose a material defect that diminishes a product's value.”).
In Matthews, the plaintiff brought a FDUTPA claim based upon allegations that the
defendant manufactured and sold vehicles with a latent defect involving coolant tubes that did
not manifest itself within the applicable warranty period, and that the defendant knew of the
defect, but failed to disclose it to consumers. Matthews, 2012 WL 2520675, at *2-3. The court
found that these allegations were sufficient to plead a FDUTPA claim. The court further found
that a consumer can recover under the FDUTPA when a defendant's deceptive conduct allegedly
diminishes the value of the product sold. Id. Notably, in Matthews, the plaintiff did not rely on
any of the defendant's express representations. Instead, it relied upon plaintiff’s allegations that,
had he known of the alleged coolant tube defect, he would not have purchased the vehicle at
issue or would have insisted on paying less for it. Id. See also Fla. Stat. § 501.202(2); Collins,
894 So.2d at 990 (finding plaintiff adequately pled a FDUTPA claim based on allegations of
defendant selling an automobile with defective seatbelt buckles, and defendant’s failure to
remedy same before selling the vehicle, and that “Florida courts have allowed diminished value
to serve as “actual damages” recoverable in a FDUTPA claim since at least Rollins in 1984.”)
(citing Rollins, Inc. v. Heller, 454 So.2d 580, 585 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984)).
Similarly, in Doll, 814 F.Supp.2d at 548-49, the court found that the plaintiff pled
sufficient facts to show that he was harmed as a result of the defendant’s omissions about a

16

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 17 of 21

torque converter defect and the resulting transmission failure in the vehicle that the plaintiff
purchased. As a result of the defendant’s omissions, coupled with the plaintiff’s allegations that
he would have paid less for the vehicle or would not have purchased the vehicle at all, had he
known of the defect, the court found that the plaintiff adequately alleged causation. See also
Martorella, 2013 WL 1137514, at *5 (finding causation established under the FDUTPA where
plaintiff alleged that defendants' unfair practices caused her damage when defendants
erroneously placed insurance coverage on a property at grossly excessive and exorbitant
insurance premiums); Rollins, Inc., 454 So.2d at 585 (finding that the costs associated with
repairing or replacing a defective alarm system amounted to actual damages under the
FDUTPA).
Based upon the abundance of case law cited above, Plaintiffs’ allegations are more than
sufficient to demonstrate both causation and damages under the FDUTPA.
B. The Complaint Adequately States a Claim for Unjust Enrichment

Defendant claims that Plaintiffs cannot maintain an unjust enrichment claim because they
have brought a FDUTPA claim and because of the existence of an express warranty, which
conveniently does not cover the claims at issue. Yet again, Defendant ignores the ample legal
authority confirming that Rule 8(d) allows pleading in the alternative, regardless of whether a
plaintiff may not ultimately recover under both theories. Kunzelmann v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
Case No. 9:11-cv-81373-DMM, 2012 WL 2003337, at *6 (S.D. Fla. June 4, 2012).
In the case of In re Horizon Organic Milk Plus DHA Omega-3 Marketing and Sales
Practice Litigation, 955 F.Supp.2d 1311, 1337 (S.D. Fla. 2013), the court denied a motion to
dismiss and allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with FDUTPA and unjust enrichment claims where
plaintiffs alleged that they did not have an adequate remedy at law. In doing so, the court cited

17

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 18 of 21

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Physicians Injury Care Ctr., Inc., 427 Fed. Appx. 714, 722
(11th Cir. 2011), wherein the Eleventh Circuit recently stated the following:
It is generally true that equitable remedies are not available under Florida law
when adequate legal remedies exist. Williams v. Bear Stearns & Co., 725 So.2d
397, 400 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998). However, that rule does not apply to unjust
enrichment claims.
Faced with this recent ruling, Defendant alternatively argues that the express warranty merits
dismissal of Plaintiffs’ FDUTPA claim. However, the existence of an express warranty, alone,
does not justify dismissal of Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim. Id; Martorella, 931 F.Supp.2d
at 1228 (finding that “it is not upon the allegation of the existence of a contract, but upon a
showing that an express contract exists that the unjust enrichment count fails.”).
Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant knowingly failed to disclose the latent defect with
its evaporator coils – a defect that is not covered by the express warranty and which clearly
removes the applicability of warranty law to this matter. Matthews, 2012 WL 2520675, at *3,
(court rejected defendant's argument that the vehicle's warranty barred the claim, stating,
“[plaintiff's] allegation that [defendant] knowingly failed to disclose the latent paint defect takes
this case outside of warranty law.”) See also, Morris v. ADT Sec. Services, 580 F.Supp.2d 1305
(S.D. Fla. 2008) (allowing plaintiff to proceed with unjust enrichment and FDUTPA claims,
despite defendant’s argument that the existence of a contract precluded both claims, and finding
it premature to dismiss either claim at the motion to dismiss stage).
Further, Defendant’s assertion that the existence of an express warranty precludes an
unjust enrichment claim in this matter is untenable.

The express warranty referenced by

Defendant precludes certain claims for reimbursement relating to the latent defect at issue,
including refrigerant and associated labor costs. Defendant is attempting to use this express
warranty as a smoke screen to avoid liability. As alleged in the Complaint, the crux of this case
18

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 19 of 21

is that Plaintiffs would not have purchased their HVAC units, or would have paid less for them,
had they known of the undisclosed defects and associated costs, which it was all-but-guaranteed
that Plaintiffs would incur. Given that Defendant’s warranty does not address the defect and
omissions at issue, the warranty has no bearing on Plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim.
C. Plaintiffs Have Adequately Pled CAFA Jurisdiction

Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have not properly pled diversity jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. §1332(d) because it is an LLC, which allegedly requires Plaintiffs to plead the identity
and citizenship of all members.

For purposes of CAFA jurisdiction, “an unincorporated

association [such as an LLC] is considered to be a citizen of the state in which it has its principal
place of business and the state under whose laws it is organized.” Lewis v. Seneff, Case No. 6:07cv-1245-Orl-22DAB, 2008 WL 3200273, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 5, 2008) (citing 28 U.S.C.
§1332(d)(10)); see also, Ferell v. Express Check Advance of SC LLC, 591 F.3d 698 (4th Cir.
2010) (finding that an LLC is an unincorporated association under 28 U.S.C. §1332(d)(10), and
that the location of the principal place of the LLC’s business, and not its members, is
determinative of its citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction under CAFA). Moreover,
CAFA does not require complete diversity, but rather, allows for federal jurisdiction if “any
member of the putative class is diverse from any defendant.” See 28 U.S.C. §1332(d)(2).
Here, Plaintiffs have specifically alleged that Defendant is organized under the laws of
Delaware and that it maintains its principal place of business in Missouri, from which it
manufactures, distributes, and sells the HVAC units at issue. (Compl. ¶7). Therefore, Plaintiffs
have adequately pled CAFA jurisdiction. Significantly, Defendant’s Motion fails to identify the
citizenship of any of its members or any other facts that would undermine jurisdiction under
CAFA. Defendant’s Certificate of Interested Parties also fails to identify its members or their
citizenship. (Doc. 21). Doing so would have revealed that Defendant’s managing member is
19

Case 1:14-cv-21884-BB Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/25/2014 Page 20 of 21

Nortek, Inc., which is located in Providence, Rhode Island. See Defendant’s Application by
Foreign Limited Liability Company for Authorization to Transact Business in Florida, attached
as Exhibit A. The managing member’s location outside of Florida further establishes that
diversity jurisdiction exists here.
CONCLUSION
For all of the above-discussed reasons, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Class Action
Complaint should be denied in its entirety, and Plaintiffs’ class action should be permitted to
proceed.
