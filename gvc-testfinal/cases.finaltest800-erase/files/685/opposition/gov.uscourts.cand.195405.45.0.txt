PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

This is a motion by Defendant AT&T Mobility, LLC, ("AT&T") against Plamtifts Zoltan
Stiener and Ynez Stiener (the "Stiencrs0x2122), to compel enforcement of an arbitration clause which
contains a class action waiver. AT&T claims that when the Stieners "contracted for wireless
service they expressly agreed to arbitrate... . on an individual (rather than a class-wide) basis" and
thal "[tJhe Federal Arbitration Act .. , as well as applicable state statutes requires them [to
arbitrate]. AT&T Mem. at 1. In fact, however, none of that is true.

First, the law is clear that class action waiver in the contractual agreement, which is
eoverned by California law, is unconscionable and unenforceable. Indeed, the law in the Ninth
Cireuit, which clearly and repeatedly has held such clauses to be unenforceable under California
law (which applies here), has been made chiefly in cases where this very same defendant has
sought to enforce ils agreements with the same class action waiver and which arc unconscionable
and uncnforceable for the same reasons.

Shrover v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., 498 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2007), decided by the
Ninth Circuit just last August, is directly on point and governs this case. There, this same
defendant,' represented by the sane lead counsel as is appearing here, made the same arguments it
how makes to enforce a materially similar contract with a class action waiver. The Ninth Circuit
did not hesitate, however, to invalidate the class action waiver as unconscionable. See, id. at 981-
97. Because AT&T had drafted the agreement so that if the class action waiver failed, the

arbitration clause automatically failed also, and the clause was stricken. fd. at 986-87. In so doing,

 

AT&T Corporation, AT&T Mobility LLC, New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc., and Cingular Wiretess,
LLC, are all corporate successors, predecessors or affiliaics. AT&T Corporation is the parent company. A
2004 merger between Cingular Wireless LLC and AT&T Wireless Services, inc. created New

Cingular Wireless Services, Inc. See, Shroyer, supra. al 979.

the Ninth Circuit noted that it was in agreement with ai least ten recent district court decisions
construing substantially similar contracts m cell phone agreements," half of which involved this
same Defendant.? Defendants' other argument, that the Federal Arbitration Act pre-empts
California law on unconscionability of class action waivers, was also definitively rejected by the
Ninth Circuit in Shrover. Contrary to AT&T's claims, that aspect of the decision is also binding on
ihis Court.

Nor was that the first time the Ninth Circuit has rejected this Defendants' unconscionable
attempts to avoid class actions. Four years ago in Ting v. AT&T, 319 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003),
ihe Circuit invalidated AT&T's attempt to impose a class action waiver. * Similar cfforts in state
courts within the Ninth Circuit have also been rebuffed. See, Scott vy. Cingular Wireless, 160

Wn.2d 843, 833 (Wash, 2007).

It i true that AT&T has sought to tinker with the terms of the arbitration clause, as it has in
the past, this time to offer "premium" payments which it claims provide an "incentive" to
individual actions. As we show below, howcver, the contractual difference, is more cosmetic than
real. The vaunted "incentives" to bring individual actions can be readily defeated by offering the
plaintiff a settlement payment of the small amount at stake which, in this case, could be as lillie as
$20, Ifon a contingency, the attorney's fee would barely pay for the cup of coffee served to the
client at the initial consultation. For the client to pay at attorney for services m these
circumstances would be madness.

Even were thesc "incentives" not illusory, which they are whenever small amounts are al
stake, they still do not address the core defects which have caused the California Supreme Court,
and the Ninth Circuit to hold arbitration clauses with class action waivers unconscionable under
Califormia law.

Further, even if the arbitration clause and the Class Aciion waiver were not unconscionable,

the motion must be denied because Plaintifis' request for public injunctive relief is not arbitrable.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

A, The Nature of the Claim

This action arises out of Defendants' pattern and practice of failing (o inform a
nationwide group of initial purchasers of the iPhone cellular telephone that fees of over $100
would be required 1o replacc the iPhone battery and maintain service while the battery was bemg
replaced. Effectively, Plaintiffs complain that the Defendants have engincered the product so that
the baltery is not replaceabie by the consumer and have used that fact to extract an unfairly ngh
price for batlery replacement. It is alleged that this was not disclosed prior to the Plaintiffs* (or

other class tncmbers} purchase of the iPhone.

B. The Formation of the Contract Between AT&T and the Stieners

Plaintiffs bought two iPhones for $599 each, plus tax, on June 29, 2007, tn San Francisco,
California. Asa condition of using the iPhone, Plaimti[fs were obligated to agree to a lwo-year
service plan with AT&T. Complaint 29. When the Stieners purchased their iPhones and
contracted for AT&T telephone service for their cell phones, apparently they were given only a
document summarizing AT&T's rate plans and a handout that describes the activation process. See
Declaration of Neal 8. Bermhoul, submitted in support of the motion (hereinaftcr Berinhout Dec.)
and AT&T Exhibits 1 and 2,

Apparently, at the time of purchase somewhere in the store there was an AT&T Terms of
Service Booklet which contains an arbitration clausc. Berinhout Dec. 8, and Defendants' Exhibit
3. The Tenna of Service agreement was also available on the web site,
hito dwnanw. wireless.ali.com, ifone knows where lo look. See, sercenshot of AT&T web site
annexed as Exhibit B ta the Declaration of Max Folkenilik, submitted herewith. Significantly,
neithet of the two documents given to the Steners at the point of purchase directed them io the
Terms of Service Agreement in the store, or to the agreement on the web site, See Defendants'
Exhibits 1 and 2.

Thereafter, in order to use the iPhones, Stieners had to "activate" them. That process
involves comecting the iPhone to a computer, and the computer te the internet and using Apple's
iTunes program to complete the activation process. See Berinhout Dec. 79. A video of the
activation process can be found at YouTube at http:/www.youtube.com `watch? v1 P52icRd-]M
(hereinafter YouTube Activation Video).

c. The Arbitration Clause

During the course of activation, a screen comes up thal states "Accept AT&T Service
Agreement" and the Tenns of Service, which are 18 pages long, including cover and mdex, see,

Defendants' Exhibit 3, show up in a box on the screen thai can only show a page or Icss at a time.

 

 

 

Gpposition Motion to Compel Arbitration
Zoltan Stiener and Yrez Steiner et af. v. Apple, fuc., AT&T Mobility, LEC, et af.
Page 5

 
 

 

The customer is required to scroll through sereen after screen in order to read its terms. See,
Defendants' Exhibit 4 at page 7, and YouTube Activation Video at 3:40-4:00.

The Terms of Service Agreement, which appears on the activation scrccn, differs in at least
one material way from the printed version that allegedly was "available" ai he AT&T store and is
submilted as Defendants' Exhibit 3: in the Exhibit, the sentence "This Agreement requires the use
of arbitration to resoive disputes and also limits the remedies available to you in the event ofa
dispute," appears in bold text. However, on the computer screen, that sentence is buried in the
middle of the screen and is nol in bold text or in any other way "conspicuous." Defendants*
Exhibit 4 at page 7. Thus, when Defendants quote the arbitration language in Exhibit 3 im bold text
and notes "emphasis in the original," it is not true that the "ernphasis" was in the original on the"
computer screen shown to the Steners.

The arbitration agreement provides an elabexate system of dispute resolution. First, a
Nolice of Dispute must be sent io AT&T's General Counsel in Georgia, and if no resolution is
agreed to in 30 days, then arbitration must bc commenced before the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"). Exhibit 3 at 12-13.

The arbitration is on an individual basis only, not on a class or combined basis. Exhibit 3 at
12 and 15. The arbitrator is without authority (o rule on a class basis and wilhout authority to issue
injunctive relief other than on an individual basis. Exhibit 3 at 15. While the agreement bas a
general severability clause, if the limits on class arbitrabihty are detcrmined to be unenforceable,
the entire arbitration clause fails. Exhibit 3 at 15.

AT&T agrees to pay the costs of the proceeding, a contract term previously held by the
Courts to be insufficient io change the unconscionabuility analysis, but not attorneys' fees, excep! as

provided by law or, if they are awarded, subjcct to the premium payments described below.
