IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

MILLENNIUM TGA, INC.,
No. 1:12-mc-00150-ESH-AK
Plaintiff,
v.
JOHN DOE,
Defendant.
NON-PARTY COMCAST CABLE COMMUNICATIONS, LLC’S MOTION FOR
EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLY WITH MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S
APRIL 18, 2012 ORDER CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW
Non-Party Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast”) respectfully requests an
extension of time of seven (7) days after the Court completes its review (Dkt. 16) of Magistrate
Judge Kay’s Court’s April 18, 2012 Order (“April 18 Order”) (Dkt. 15) to disclose information
required by the April 18 Order, if that Order is affirmed. In support thereof Comcast states as
follows:
1.

On April 18, 2012, Magistrate Judge Kay issued an order granting in part and

denying in part Plaintiff Millennium TGA, Inc.’s (“Millennium’s) motion to compel compliance
with subpoena (Dkt. 1). Comcast had objected to the subpoena and filed an Opposition to
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel (Dkt 7). Comcast also filed a Notice of Related Case and Request
for Reassignment (Dkt 8), which was neither addressed nor resolved in the April 18 Order.
2.

Pursuant to the April 18 Order under review, Comcast is required to disclose to

Plaintiff on or before June 17, 2012 certain specified information regarding over 300 of its
Internet services subscribers. On May 2, 2012, Comcast timely filed Objections to the April 18
Order (“Objections”) (Dkt. 16) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636. Plaintiff filed its Response to

Case 1:12-mc-00150-ESH-AK Document 19

Comcast’s Objections on May 17, 2012 (Dkt. 17) (“Response”). Comcast filed its Reply in
support of its Objections on May 24, 2012.
3.

Comcast has given notice to the affected subscribers. However, in order to

preserve the confidentiality of the subscribers’ identities while review of the April 18 Order is
pending, out of an abundance of caution, Comcast respectfully requests that the date for any
disclosure of information required by the April 18 Order be extended until seven (7) days after
the Court has resolved Comcast’s Objections, if that date is later than June 10, 2012. This will
allow for the Court to consider the matter without the possibility of a required disclosure that
would moot Comcast’s Objections.
4.

Pursuant to Local Rule 7(m), Comcast conferred with counsel for Plaintiff

Millennium TGA, provided him a copy of this motion, and counsel indicated he opposed the
grant of relief sought in this motion.
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Comcast respectfully requests that this Court
grant Comcast an extension of time of seven (7) days after the Court’s resolution of Comcast’s
Objections to comply with any disclosures required by the April 18 Order currently under review
if such review is not completed before June 10, 2012.
Dated: May 24, 2012
Respectfully submitted,
