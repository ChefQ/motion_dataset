1

Plaintiffs submit this Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant CTTC’s Motion for Entry

2

of Final Judgment. Because issues which the remaining Defendants apparently intend to contest

3

may overlap with those already decided and because the CTTC will not suffer any hardship, the

4

CTTC’s Motion should be denied.

5

Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “provides an exception to the general

6

principle that a final judgment is proper only after the rights and liabilities of all the parties to the

7

action have been adjudicated.” Hogan v. Consol. Rail Corp., 961 F.2d 1021, 1024–25 (2d Cir.

8

1992). “Where the complaint is dismissed as to one defendant but not others, the court should not,

9

as a general matter, direct the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) if the same or

10

closely related issues remain to be litigated against the undismissed defendants.” Id. at 1025.

11

As the CTTC points out, “[I]n deciding whether there are no just reasons to delay the

12

appeal of individual final judgments in a setting such as this, a district court must take into account

13

judicial administrative interests as well as the equities involved.” Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen.

14

Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 8 (1980). The district court must determine “whether the nature of the

15

claims already determined was such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues

16

more than once even if there were subsequent appeals.” Id. “A similarity of legal or factual issues

17

will weigh heavily against entry of judgment under the rule, and in such cases a Rule 54(b) order

18

will be proper only where necessary to avoid a harsh and unjust result, documented by further and

19

specific findings.” Frank Briscoe Co. v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 776 F.2d 1414, 1416 (9th Cir.

20

1985) (quoting Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965 (9th Cir. 1981)).

21

In dismissing the CTTC, the Court applied the Midcal test, as articulated in California

22

Retail Liquor Dealers Ass’n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980), and found that the

23

state action immunity doctrine, set forth in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 350–51 (1943),

24

immunizes the CTTC. The CTTC represents in its Motion that “[n]o remaining defendant has this

25

state agency attribute. This issue cannot reappear in any subsequent appeal relating to the action

26

against the Rental Car Defendants.” Def. CTTC’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Mot. Entry Final J. at 2.

27

In each of the Answers filed by the Rental Car Defendants, however, the state action doctrine is

28

asserted as an affirmative defense. See, e.g., Answer First Am. Compl. Def. Avis Budget Group,

Inc. at 7; Answer First Am. Compl. Def. Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc. at 8; Answer First

2

Am. Compl. Def. Fox Rent a Car, Inc. at 7. Due to the likely repetition of the state action

3

immunity issue, this case is not proper for Rule 54(b) certification. Should the Court enter

4

judgment under Rule 54(b), Plaintiffs would have to appeal now, despite the fact that the Rental

5

Car Defendants apparently intend to raise the state action immunity issue in this Court. Therefore,

6

administrative interests of judicial economy dictate that final judgment not be entered at this

7

juncture.

8

Furthermore, Plaintiffs respectfully dispute the grounds for CTTC dismissal, contending

9

that state action immunity cannot apply to the CTTC because, among other things, (a) it lacks the

10

authority to engage in final retail price fixing arrangements; (b) it has facilitated the collection of

11

monies in excess of statutory intention or allowance; and (c) as a body whose decisions are made

12

by a supermajority of industry members appointed by affected private corporations, it cannot

13

exercise “independent state supervision” under Midcal or other authority. Plaintiffs understand

14

that the Rental Car Defendants have a related theory about how state action immunity extends to

15

both of the price fixing offenses alleged and may advance that theory in motions before this Court.

16

Accordingly, judicial economy would appear to be furthered by combining the decisions as to the

17

application of antitrust law to the Defendants in this case into a single package for appellate

18

review, rather than to subject all parties to seriatim appeals in pieces.

19

In addition to the fact that administrative concerns dictate that certification under Rule

20

54(b) should not be granted, Defendants have failed to demonstrate that they will suffer any

21

hardship if certification is not granted. “Judgments under Rule 54(b) must be reserved for the

22

unusual case in which the costs and risks of multiplying the number of proceedings and of

23

overcrowding the appellate dockets are outbalanced by pressing needs of the litigants for an early

24

and separate judgment as to some claims or parties.” Frank Briscoe Co., 776 F.2d at 1416

25

(quoting Morrison-Knudsen Co., 655 F.2d at 965). Where potential hardships are those that would

26

result in any case, the entry of judgment under Rule 54(b) is not appropriate. See Hogan, 961 F.2d

27

at 1025 (finding Rule 54(b) certification inappropriate where the court “gave no indication that the

28

case was an exceptional one or that there would be any unusual hardship in requiring [the parties]

to await, in accordance with normal federal practice, the disposition of the entire case”). Here, the

2

CTTC has merely identified the uncertainties associated with not having a final judgment as

3

hardships. Cf. Shintom Am., Inc. v. Car Tels., Inc., 45 F.3d 1107, 1111 (7th Cir. 1995) (noting that

4

a party’s insolvency may constitute a special circumstance allowing for entry of judgment). Such

5

uncertainties exist in all cases and can therefore not be the basis for entry of judgment under Rule

6

54(b).

Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that Defendant CTTC’s Motion be denied.
