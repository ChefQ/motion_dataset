Defendant California Travel and Tourism Commission ("CTTC") respectfully submits this |
reply to Plaintiffs' opposition to CTTC's motion for entry of judgment. Because Plaintiffs have |

not established any just reason to delay entry of judgment, CTTC's motion should be granted.

I. Final Judgment Should Be Entered In Favor Of CTTC Because All Claims Against CTTC
Have Been Dismissed And There Is No Just Reason For Delay. |

"Behind Rule 54(b) is the recognition that with the liberal joinder of claims and parties

| now permitted by the federal rules, the policy against piecemeal review ... must be weighed |

against the untoward effects which can occur when decisions final as to some claims and some |

| parties cannot be entered until the litigation is final as to all claims and all parties." Bogosian v. |

Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 440 (30x00B0 Cir. 1977). Accordingly, final judgment is properly
entered where all claims against a defendant have been dismissed unless there is "just reason
for delay." Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 8 (1980). |
On July 24, 2008, this Court entered its Order Granting CTTC's Motion to Dismiss the
First Amended Complaint ("Order"), which disposed of all claims against CTTC, finding that
CTTC is immune from liability for an alleged antitrust violation under the state action doctrine. |
Order, p. 15. Plaintiffs contend that entry of judgment is not appropriate in this case because
there is a chance that remaining defendants might also assert a state action immunity defense,
and because they claim CTTC will not suffer any hardship. Plaintiffs are wrong on both counts.
CTTC's State Action Immunity Differs From The Potential Defenses Of All Other Defendants.
Plaintiffs argue that because the Rental Car Defendants have asserted state action

immunity as an affirmative defense, a similarity of the issues precludes entry of judgment for,

| CTTC. However, a state action immunity defense on the part of the Rental Car Defendants, if

| one is asserted, would not involve the same legal and factual issues that were the basis for

it
|

CTTC's state action defense. The Court correctly found that CTTC is "a state agency acting in a

non-sovereign capacity," Order, p. 12, which satistied the first prong of the Midcal test in that it.
acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal !
Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980). The Court also found that CTTC need not satisfy the |

second Midcal prong. Order, p. 12. No Rental Car Defendant has ever contended that it is a |

state agency, and whether CTTC is a state agency for antitrust purposes would not be an issue in
the determination of the Rental Car Defendants' defense.
The analysis of the first Midcal prong would not be the same for the CTTC and the Rental

Car Defendants either. Whether CTTC acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy would.

| not determine whether the Rental Car Defendants acted pursuant to this policy. Plaintiffs' First |

|

Amended Complaint makes clear that the alleged roles of the CTTC and the Rental Car |

| Defendants are very different. The FAC alleges that the CTTC's claimed role in the Rental Car |

| Defendants' alleged conspiracy was that it merely acted as a location for meetings. Therefore,

there is no similarity of issues that would require an appellate court to decide the same issue
more than once on subsequent appeals. Moreover, even if there is some interplay between the
issues, the Supreme Court has clearly stated that the presence of a similar issue would not.
"necessarily mean that Rule 54(b) certification would be improper." Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. |
Gen. Elec. Co), 446. U.S. af 8; n:2.

Plaintiffs point out that they "dispute the grounds for CTTC's dismissal." Opposition, 6. |
2. The fact that Plaintiffs disagree with the Court's dismissal of the claims against CTTC does |
nothing to create similarity between CTTC's immunity and any argument that the Rental Car
Defendants may or may not make hereafter under a different part of the Midcal test. The CITC.
is entitled to immunity as a state agency, whereas the Rental Car Defendants are not state |
agencies. Should Plaintiffs choose to appeal the Courts' judgment for CTTC, the appeal would |
be limited to the factual and legal issues relevant only to CTTC.

Prejudice to CTTC

Plaintiffs also erroneously assert that CTTC will suffer no hardship should it be forced to"
wait for finality of the dismissal of the claims against it. Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co.,
446 U.S. 1, provides a clear example that a party need not face dire, crippling injury caused by |
a delay to justify the entry of judgment. In Curtiss-Wright, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment |
without waiting for the remainder of the case to conclude merely because a statutory interest rate |
was somewhat lower than the prevailing rate. There was no danger that the plaintiff would

become insolvent due to the loss; indeed, the Court noted that the company would be able io.

satisfy a judgment on the counterclaim if necessary. Id. at 12.
The CITC does, however, stand to suffer the real and substantial harm of uncertainty

and continuing cost if required to wait for resolution of the remaining claim against the Rental

Car Defendants. Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, highlights the sufficiency of this

| harm. Bogosian was an antitrust case where two defendants were dismissed and thirteen

remained. In finding the Rule 54(b) certification proper, the appellate court found:

There is a possibility that decision on the contract theory pending trial could moot
the question presented on the appeal from the conspiracy-tying theory.
Nevertheless, a decision on that claim might take a number of years to reach,
and, in the interim, the defendants would bear the uncertainty arising from the
bel that they may be forced to defend a massive antitrust claim years in the
uture.

 

 

 

|
ld. at 443. The same harm exists here. The claims against CTTC do not simply implicate a few |

| dollars the Plaintiffs claim they were each improperly charged. The claims question the legality |

of the entire funding mechanism of a statutorily-created non-profit corporation, which the Court
has recognized operates as a state agency. CTTC is presently required by statute to collect and
spend $50 million a year promoting the State of California. Until final judgment is entered, it is
uncertain whether CTTC may carry out its mandate legally. This uncertainty represents sufficient
harm if CTTC is forced to wait years for such a determination, and demonstrates that there is no |
just reason for delay. In addition, CTTC will spend precious resources on monitoring this |
litigation if judgment is not entered at this time.

Plaintiffs' reliance on Frank Briscoe Co., Inc. v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc., 776 F.2d

1414 (1985), is misplaced. In that case, the Ninth Circuit found the district court's certification

improper because the district court failed to make the requisite express finding that there was no

just reason for delay. Id. at 1416. The court merely issued a minute order granting the motion |
without discussion. The case Frank Briscoe Co. quotes, as cited by Plaintiffs, also fails to support |
their arguments. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. v. Archer, 655 F2d. 962 (9" Cir. 1981), quoted by |
Frank Briscoe Co., held that Rule 54(b) certification there was improper, unlike the present case, |

because "[t]he claims disposed of by the Rule 54(b) judgment were inseverable, both legally and

factually, from claims that remained unadjudicated in the district court, and there were no.

| unusual and compelling circumstances that otherwise dictated entry of an early, separate
| judgment on that part of the case." Id. at 966. Given the inseverable nature of the claims, the.
| Ninth Circuit required a showing of prejudice to support entry of judgment under Rule 54(b). As |
| discussed above, the issue of CTTC's state action immunity is legally and factually distinct, ond |
| therefore severable, from the Rental Car Defendants' alleged agreement not to compete; and in |
| further distinction from the facts in Morrison-Knudsen, the CTTC stands to suffer sutticient harm
|| to justify entry of judgment now. |

Hogan v. Consol. Rail Corp., 961 F.2d 1021 (2d Cir. 1992), also provides no help to"
| Plaintiffs. In Hogan, the district court entered judgment in part so that an appellate ruling on the |
| decided claims would provide guidance for the district court's future handling of the case. The |
| Second Circuit found such certification to be improper because "the interrelationship of the |
dismissed and surviving claims" was too great. Id. at 1026. No similar concern is present here,
| as discussed, because of the factually and legally distinct nature of the claims against the CTTC.
va Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, CTTC respectfully requests the Court to enter final judgment

in CTTC's favor, directing that plaintiffs take nothing from CTTC by way of their First Amended |

| Complaint.

| | Contrary to the Plaintiff's argument, the Ninth Circuit has under some circumstances even
| approved entry of judgment under Rule 54(b) without any showing of impending harm. In
| Continental Airlines, Inc. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., B.F., 819 F.2d 1519 (9" Cir. 1987),
| the court held that judgment was properly entered where the purpose for doing so was simply to |
| establish res judicata effects in the state court lawsuit pending between the two parties, not to |

relieve a party of some harsh or unjust injury. |
