MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE IN
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWER

Defendants have previously filed a Motion for a More Definite Statement. They have
also filed a Motion to Strike improper material from the Plaintiffs’ complaint, as well as to strike
their Plaintiffs’ Response to their Motion in its entirety, because that document is replete with
improper and derogatory comments regarding the collective Defendants1. The Court has not yet
issued its ruling on these Motions. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ latest Motion, is merely an extension of
its prior response and reply to Defendants’ Motion for a More Definite Statement; its adds no
substance that is not already before this Court. And once again, Defendants are being forced to
file responses to Plaintiffs’ endless filings in their many lawsuits against these Defendants.
As stated previously, Federal Rule 8(a)(2) mandates that a complaint set forth a “short

1

In their Motion, Plaintiffs state that they “will not retract the statements made in the
previous filing.” Motion at ¶ 14. Defendants assume that Plaintiffs are referring to their Motion
to Strike.

and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Pleading special
matters, such as fraud, or aspects of RICO claims, have a heightened pleading standard, and must
be set forth with particularity. Fed. Rule Civ. P. 9(b). RICO claims, for example, must be
sufficient to ensure that a defendant has clear notice of the factual basis of the predicate acts.
Although Plaintiffs contend that they have complied with these rules, they have not. The
purported allegations contained in the Amended Complaint, are an incoherent mix of narrative,
interlaced with improper legal conclusions and citations to state and federal case law, numerous
federal statutes, the U.S. Constitution, secondary sources, and allegations of various torts of
invasion of privacy, fraud on a court, and breaches of contract, among others. If the Amended
Complaint is read by omitting the legal conclusions, and citations to cases, statutes, and
secondary sources, which comprise the bulk of the pleading, then there are relatively few facts
alleged, and certainly no facts to support their RICO claims.
Plaintiffs’ statements are mere bald allegations, yet the rules require that when pleading
special matters, such RICO claims, that the pleadings contain specific facts. Even in their
Motion, Plaintiffs are beseeching that the Defendants be required to respond to alleged violations
of 21 statutes that Plaintiffs have cited, however, it is Plaintiffs who should be required to plead
sufficient facts showing their entitlement to relief. Plaintiffs must properly plead their claims,
and then it will ultimately be Plaintiffs who must carry the burden of proof. To the contrary,
however, Plaintiffs allege very few facts, and then improperly seem to place the burden of proof
on the Defendants. For example, in their Motion, Plaintiffs ask if defense counsel can prove that
there was never a transceiver or transmitter in Mr. Shi and Ms. Fan’s house, or whether Mr. Shi
and Ms. Fan can prove that they were never part of a group that gathered defense information and

smuggled it from the country. See Motion at ¶ 15. Plaintiffs also improperly attempt to support
their Motion by reciting what they allege to be passages from pleadings in the Eastern District of
Virginia case. Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ position that the Defendants are only observing the
proceedings, which somehow warrants an admission of Plaintiffs’ allegations, is preposterous, as
is their prayer to the Court, which again, is an improper legal conclusion. See Motion at page 7,
¶ 17 and prayer for relief.
As stated previously, Defendants should not have to respond to such an incoherent
pleading, nor should they be forced to blindly set out on a discovery fishing expedition in an
attempt to figure out what the Plaintiffs’ claims are. To the contrary, Plaintiffs should be
required to plead sufficient facts, including facts to support their RICO claims. Accordingly,
Defendants request that the Court grant their Motion for a More Definite Statement, and deny
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Answer. Defendants also renew their Motion to Strike,
incorporated herein by reference.
