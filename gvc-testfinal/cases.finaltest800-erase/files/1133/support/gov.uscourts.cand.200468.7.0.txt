Case 5:08-cv-00991-JF Document7 Filed 03/31/2008 Page2of8

 

The Defendants submit the following Memorandum of Points and

Authorities in support of their Motion to Dismiss the Complaint.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

This action was brought under the Fair Debt Collection Act, 15 USC, 1692

 

et seq. the "Act"

It is hard to ascertain what constituted the alleged violations since the
pleading is general and conclusionary in nature. In addition. almost all of the

alleged violations were barred by the Statute of Limitations.

The "underlying" claim by the Defendants to the Plaintiff was a series of
Collection letters due to the Plaintiff's checks being returned for non-sufficient

funds.

Important dates for this Court to note are February 19, 2008, which is when
this lawsuit was filed and February 20, 2008, on which date any preceding

violations are barred by the one year statute of limitations as set forth in this brief.

(6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted;

A dismissal for failure to state claim on which relief can be granted is proper
if it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of
claim that would entitle him to relief, if complaint fails to allege an element
necessary for relief, or if affirmative defense or other bar to relief is apparent from
face of complaint. See Theuerkaufv. United Vaccines Div. of Harlan Sprague

Dawley, Inc., W.D.Mich.1993. 821 F.Supp. 1238.

THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BARS

CERTAIN CLAIMS IN THE COMPLAINT

The Motion to Dismiss should be granted as to both defendants on whom
the statute of limitations has passed. According to 15 USC Section 1692k(d), an
action to enforce any liability created by this subchapter may be brought...within
one year from the date on which the violation occurs. Paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17,
18,19, 20, 21, 22, 23,24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, and 76 all contain allegations that
are barred by the Statute of Limitation as they allege acts that are over one (1) year
old.

As all of the causes of action include facts barred by the statute of
limitations, the aforementioned Paragraphs should be stricken and the Motion to

Dismiss each cause of action should be granted.

Ul
IT IS UNCLEAR FROM THE REMAINING ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE

NOT BARRED BY THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF THE SPECIFIC

ACTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE VIOLATIONS

A motion to dismiss is the proper method for testing the legal sufficiency of
a complaint. Sioux City Community School Dist. v. International Tel. & Tel.
Corp.. N.D.Jowa 1978. 461 F.Supp. 662 See, also, Mason City Center Associates
v. Citv of Mason City. lowa, D.C.lowa 1979. 468 F.Supp. 737. Motion to dismiss
for failure of pleadings to state claim upon which relief can be granted is usual

method for testing legal sufficiency of complaint. CBS Inc. v. Springboard Intern.

Case 5:08-cv-00991-JF Document7 Filed 03/31/2008 Page6of8

Records, $.D.N.Y.1976, 429 F.Supp. 563, 199 U.S.P.O. 422.

In paragraph 102( b), Plaintiff claims that Defendants misrepresented the
character, amount or legal status of the debt, in violation of 15 USC Section
1692e(2)(A). There are no facts in the complaint that allege specific facts

supporting this allegation.

In Paragraph 102(d), Plaintiff alleges that Defendants attempted or
threatened to collect treble damages from Plaintiff pursuant to California Civil
Code Section 1719, an action that cannot legally be taken or that was not intended

to be taken, in violation of 15 USC Section 1692 e(5).

The action before this Court was based upon Plaintiff's NSF check.
California Civil Code Section 1719 does allow treble damages. As such, it is

unclear what specific facts of how Defendants violated 15 USC Section 1692

e(5).
