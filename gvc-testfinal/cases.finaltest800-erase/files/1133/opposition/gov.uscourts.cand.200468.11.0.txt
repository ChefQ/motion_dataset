NATURE OF THE CASE

23

This case was brought by HERMINIA LORENZO CRUZ against a debt collection agency,

24

INTERNATIONAL COLLECTION CORPORATION, and the individual who operates and

25

manages the collection agency, CHARLES D. HENDRICKSON. The Plaintiff alleges various

26

violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692, et seq. (hereinafter

27

“FDCPA”), which prohibits debt collectors from engaging in abusive, deceptive and unfair practices.

28

Plaintiff seeks actual damages, statutory damages, attorney fees and costs under the FDCPA.

Plaintiff also alleges several tort causes of action, specifically invasion of privacy by intrusion upon

seclusion, negligent collection, and tort-in-se. Plaintiff seeks actual and punitive damages for these

tort causes of action.

QUESTIONS PRESENTED

5

1.

Are allegations in the Complaint barred by the statute of limitations?

6

2.

Does the Complaint state a claim against the Defendant collection agency?

7

3.

Does the Complaint state a claim against the individual Defendant who operates and

8

manages the collection agency?

9

ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES

10

A.

11

Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss this action for failure to state a claim upon which

12

relief may be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In deciding

13

a motion to dismiss, a district court must accept the facts alleged in the Complaint as true.1 When

14

reviewing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the factual allegations

15

of the complaint are to be taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving

16

party.2 Generally, the Complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears that Plaintiff can prove

17

no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.3

18

B.

Standard for Motion to Dismiss

The “Least Sophisticated Consumer” Standard Is Used to Analyze Violations
of the FDCPA.

19
20

The FDCPA states that its purpose, in part, is “to eliminate abusive debt collection practices

21

by debt collectors.”4 The statute is designed to protect consumers from unscrupulous collectors,

whether or not there is a valid debt.5 The FDCPA broadly prohibits unfair or unconscionable

2

collection methods; conduct which harasses, oppresses or abuses any debtor; and any false,

3

deceptive or misleading statements, in connection with the collection of a debt.6 The FDCPA also

4

requires the debt collector to provide the consumer with a notice of his or her validation rights.7

5

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that whether a

6

communication or other conduct violates the FDCPA is to be determined by analyzing it from the

7

perspective of the “least sophisticated consumer.”8 The “least sophisticated consumer” standard is

8

objective—not subjective.9 Courts determine whether the “least sophisticated consumer” would be

9

misled or deceived by the statements made in a collection letter as a matter of law.10

10

“The basic purpose of the least sophisticated consumer standard is to ensure that the FDCPA

11

protects all consumers, the gullible as well as the shrewd.”11 “While protecting naive consumers,

12

the standard also prevents liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices

13

by preserving a quotient of reasonableness and presuming a basic level of understanding and

14

willingness to read with care.”12

15

“As the FDCPA is a strict liability statute, proof of one violation is sufficient to support

summary judgment for the plaintiff.”13 “Because the Act imposes strict liability, a consumer need

2

not show intentional conduct by the debt collector to be entitled to damages.”14 Furthermore, the

3

question of whether the consumer owes the alleged debt has no bearing on a suit brought pursuant

4

to the FDCPA.15

5

It is important to note that by protecting consumers from abusive, deceptive and unfair

6

collection practices, the FDCPA insures that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive

7

debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged.16 Moreover, the FDCPA further

8

insures that regardless of whether a consumer owes a debt, he or she will be treated in a reasonable

9

and in a civil manner.17

10
11
12

Accordingly, Plaintiff asserts that whether or not Defendants violated the FDCPA must be
evaluated from the standpoint of the “least sophisticated consumer.”

Under the Strict Liability Standard of the FDCPA, Plaintiff Has Pled Numerous
Violations of the FDCPA, as Seen from the Perspective of the “Least
Sophisticated Consumer.”

14
To establish a violation of the FDCPA, one need only show that: (1) the plaintiff has been
15
the object of collection activity arising from a consumer debt, (2) the defendant collecting the “debt”
16
is a “debt collector” as defined in the Act, and (3) the defendant has engaged in any act or omission
17

in violation of the prohibitions or requirements of the Act.18 Plaintiff has pled each of these

elements: (1) Plaintiff is a consumer,19 (2) Defendants are debt collectors,20 and (3) Defendants

2

violated various sections of the FDCPA.21

3

Because the FDCPA is a strict liability statute, proof of one violation is sufficient to defeat

4

a motion to dismiss and support summary judgment for a Plaintiff.22 In light of this strict liability

5

standard, a consumer need not show intentional conduct by the debt collector in order to be entitled

6

to damages,23 and there are no unimportant violations.24 Further, no proof of deception or actual

damages is required to obtain statutory remedies.25

barred by the FDCPA’s one year statute of limitations, and therefore should be stricken.26

2

Defendants further assert that each cause of action should be dismissed because these facts are

3

outside the FDCPA’s statute of limitations.27

4

While it is true that the FDCPA has a one year statute of limitation,28 this is not a bar to

5

Plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff has alleged that wrongful collection activities occurred within the year

6

prior to filing this case.29 Therefore, these facts, and the causes of action which rely on these facts,

7

are not barred by the FDCPA statute of limitations. Moreover, to the extent the Complaint contains

8

allegations regarding conduct outside of the FDCPA’s one year statute of limitation, these

9

allegations are admissible under the continuing violation theory of recovery recognized in the

10

Northern District of California.30 Therefore, any allegations which Plaintiff may have pled regarding

11

facts outside the one year statute of limitations are not barred, as they relate to Defendants’

12

continuing course of unlawful collection activities which violated the FDCPA.

13

Additionally, Plaintiff has pled facts which relate to causes of action with longer statutes of

14

limitation than the FDCPA, as discussed in further detail below. Therefore, these facts should not

15

and cannot be stricken from the Complaint.

16

For these reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied as to this issue.

Plaintiff’s second cause of action is invasion of privacy by intrusion upon seclusion—a tort

2

“An action for . . . injury to . . . an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of

3

another” is subject to a two year statute of limitations under California law.31 Therefore, factual

4

allegations outside of the FDCPA’s one year statute of limitation are not barred, as they are within

the two years provided for Plaintiff’s invasion of privacy cause of action. For this reason,

Defendant’s motion to dismiss should be denied as to this issue.

Plaintiff’s Claim of Negligent Collection is Not Barred by the Statute of

Plaintiff’s third cause of action is negligent collection, which is also “[a]n action for . . .

10

injury to . . . an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another,” and subject to a two

11

year statute of limitations.32 Therefore, factual allegations outside of the FDCPA’s one year statute

12

of limitations are not barred, as they are within the two years provided for Plaintiff’s negligence

13

cause of action. For this reason, Defendant’s motion to dismiss should be denied as to this issue.

14

4.

Plaintiff’s Claim of Tort-In-Se is Not Barred by the Statute of
Limitations

15
16

Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is tort-in-se, which is also “[a]n action for . . . injury to . .

17

. an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another,” and subject to a two year statute

18

of limitations.33 Therefore, factual allegations outside of the FDCPA’s one year statute of

19

limitations are not barred, as they are within the two years provided for Plaintiff’s negligence cause

20

of action. For this reason, Defendant’s motion to dismiss should be denied as to this issue.

21

E.

The Complaint Alleges Facts Sufficient to Support Plaintiff’s Claims Under the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

22
Defendants argue that “[t]here are not facts in the complaint that allege specific facts

alleged violations of federal law.

15 U.S.C. § 1692e(2)(A)

Plaintiff has alleged that, “Defendants misrepresented the character, amount or legal status

6

in paragraphs 77 - 83 of the Complaint. This Court has found that similar facts violate this section

7

of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.36 Therefore, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be

8

denied as to this issue.

9

15 U.S.C. § 1692e(5)

10

Plaintiff has alleged that, “Defendants attempted or threatened to collect treble damages from

11

Plaintiff pursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 1719, an action that cannot legally be taken or that was not

12

intended to be taken, in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(5).”37 The facts to support this violation are

13

alleged in paragraphs 77 - 83 of the Complaint. This Court has found that similar facts violate this

section of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.38 Therefore, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should

[sic] in the Complaint that would hold him personally liable for any wrongful acts.”39 However, the

2

allegations in the Complaint, which must be taken as true for purposes of this motion, are that this

3

Defendant “is a ‘debt collector’ within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).40 The Complaint

4

further alleges, on information and belief, that this Defendant, “is liable for the acts of [International

5

Collection Corporation] because he sets and approves [International Collection Corporation]

6

collection policies practices, procedures, and he directed the unlawful activities described herein.”41

7

Finally, the Complaint alleges that, “[a]t all times herein mentioned, each of the Defendants was an

8

officer, director, agent, servant, employee and/or joint venturer of his co-defendants, and each of

9

them, and at all said times, each Defendant was acting in the full course and scope of said office,

10

directorship, agency, service, employment and/or joint venture.”42

11

The Complaint alleges that HENDRICKSON set and approved the collection policies,

12

practices and procedures used by INTERNATIONAL COLLECTION CORPORATION and that

13

he directed the unlawful activities described in the Complaint. The Complaint alleges facts

14

sufficient to establish liability under the FDCPA as to Defendant, CHARLES D. HENDRICKSON.

15

Therefore, Plaintiff’s Complaint states a cause of action against this Defendant, and the motion to

16

dismiss should be denied as to this issue.

17

CONCLUSION

18

The Complaint filed in this case properly alleges facts sufficient to state causes of action

19

against all Defendants under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Negligence, Invasion of Privacy

20

and Tort-in-Se. All facts alleged are within the relevant statute of limitations for each of these

21

causes of action. Finally, the Complaint sufficiently alleges facts to state a claim against the

22

individual Defendant, HENDRICKSON. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court

23

deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in its entirety and find that Plaintiff’s Complaint states claims
