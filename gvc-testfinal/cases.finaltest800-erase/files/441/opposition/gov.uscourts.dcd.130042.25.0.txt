INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Uniboard Canada, Inc. (“
Uniboard”
) respectfully submits this
memorandum in opposition to the motion by Defendant Unilin Beheer B.V. (“
Unilin”
) to
consolidate Civil Action No. 1:08-cv-00399 (“
the Uniboard action”
) with Civil Action No. 1:08cv-00659 (“
the Pergo action”
).
In moving for consolidation, Unilin ignores the significant substantive and
procedural differences between the Uniboard action and the Pergo action. In so doing, Unilin
presents an incomplete picture of the relationship between the two actions, overstating the
overlap while completely disregarding the distinctions. The Pergo action and the Uniboard
action involve different parties, different claims for relief, different patents, different products,
different legal standards based upon different sections of the Patent Act, different discovery
issues, and different arbiters of fact. By failing to address these differences, Unilin vastly
overstates any purported efficiency gains that could be achieved through consolidation, and
obscures the advantages to be gained from allowing the Pergo action to proceed more quickly.
Indeed, although Unilin contends that “
it is hard to imagine two related actions
more deserving of consolidation,”Unilin is able to identify only three points of overlap between
these actions: (i) the validity of certain Unilin patents has been challenged in each; (ii) the parties
are represented by the same counsel; and (iii) both actions were recently filed. (Docket No. 23,
hereina
f
t
e
r“
Unilin Br.”at 3-4.) Yet, while the validity of Unilin patents has been generally
challenged in each, the central questions in the Pergo action are those of overlapping subject
matter and priority, while the central questions in the Uniboard action are those of validity and
infringement; the questions of law and fact pending before the Court in each respective action are

based upon different legal standards and concern different types of proof. And while it is true
that both actions were filed at roughly the same time, with the opposing parties in each action
being represented by the same counsel, these facts can hardly overcome the inconvenience, delay,
and confusion that would inevitably result from the consolidation of two cases that present
distinct and complicated issues. Instead, the parties could easily achieve the gains in judicial
economy that Unilin seeks by entering common-sense agreements relating to discovery and
claim construction issues, without having to confuse and convolute the discrete issues that each
case presents. In short, not only would consolidation cause a host of inefficiencies, but any
potential efficiencies that might be achieved through consolidation could be realized by other,
simpler means. Thus, Unilin’
s motion to consolidate the Uniboard action with the Pergo action
should be denied.
I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND: THE UNIBOARD ACTION AS COMPARED TO
THE PERGO ACTION
In the Uniboard action, Uniboard, a Canadian corporation, seeks a judicial

declaration that eight Unilin patents are invalid under one or more of Sections 101, 102, 103, and
112 of the Patent Act, and that none of Uniboard’
s laminate flooring products infringe any of
these eight patents. In response, Unilin asserted counterclaims for infringement of these same
eight patents, while counterclaim plaintiff Flooring Industries Ltd., sarl (“
Flooring Industries”
)
also counterclaimed for infringement of one of its patents (U.S. Patent No. 6,786,019).1 Both
Unilin and Flooring Industries seek compensatory and enhanced damages under 35 U.S.C. § 284.
The Uniboard action thus presents issues of patent validity, patent infringement, willfulness, and
damages, and both parties have demanded a jury trial.

In contrast, in the Pergo action, Pergo (Europe) AB (“
Pergo”
), a Swedish
corporation, seeks relief under Section 291 of the Patent Act. Neither Uniboard nor Flooring
Industries is a party to the Pergo action.2 While a key issue in the Uniboard action is whether
any Uniboard products infringe a valid and enforceable claim of either the Unilin or Flooring
Industries patents, no allegations of infringement have been (or could be) made in the Pergo
action. In addition, while the Uniboard action concerns the alleged infringement and invalidity
of eight Unilin patents and one Flooring Industries patent, the Pergo action concerns the priority
of the Unilin patents as compared to four Pergo patents. The Uniboard action therefore requires
the Court to compare the Unilin and Flooring Industries patents with the Uniboard products (to
determine whether these products infringe) and with any prior art (to determine whether any
asserted claim is valid). In contrast, the Pergo action requires a comparison of the Unilin patents
to the four asserted Pergo patents, rather than to any products that may embody the claims.
Moreover, only declaratory relief is sought by the parties in the Pergo action; no
party has sought (or may seek) compensatory or enhanced damages, as has been done in the
Uniboard action. And although both parties have demanded a jury trial to resolve the issues of
fact in the Uniboard action, the Pergo action is primarily a dispute over priority, which is an
issue of law to be resolved by the Court. As a final point of distinction, in the Pergo action,
Unilin has asserted several counterclaims for invalidity and unenforceability of the Pergo patents,
none of which are at issue in the Uniboard action.

Br. at 2–

support the proposition that the common ownership of a Canadian corporation (Uniboard) and a Swedish
corporation (Pergo) by a German corporation (Pfliederer) would support consolidation.

ARGUMENT
A.

STANDARDS GOVERNING THE GRANT OF CONSOLIDATION
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a), it is within the sound discretion of

the district court to order consolidation “
‘
[w]hen actions involving a common question of law or
fact are pending before [it].’
”Consolidation is appropriate only if the Court determines that
“
‘
savings of expense and gains of efficiency can be accomplished without sacrifice of justice.’
”
Blasko v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 243 F.R.D. 13, 15 (D.D.C. 2007) (quoting
Devlin v. Trans. Commc
’
ns Int’
l Union, 175 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir. 1999)). If confusion and
prejudice would result from a proposed consolidation, such considerations weigh in favor of
maintaining the pending actions as separate. Am. Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal Serv., 422
F. Supp. 2d 240, 245 (D.D.C. 2006). Typically, courts have placed the burden of showing the
commonality of factual and legal issues in different actions on the party moving for
consolidation. See, e.g., In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. 1993).
B.

CONSOLIDATION WILL BE INEFFICIENT, COSTLY, CONFUSING,
AND RESULT IN DELAY
Unilin’
s motion does not even refer to the standard for evaluating the propriety of

consolidation of related actions, which, as noted above, requires the Court to balance any alleged
gains in judicial efficiency against any potential confusion or prejudice. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
42(a); see also Blasko, 243 F.R.D. at 15 (D.D.C. 2007). Indeed, Unilin is unable to identify a
single instance where a Section 291 interference was consolidated with a separate infringement
action. Unilin instead cites Rohm & Haas Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 525 F. Supp. 1298, 1309-10
(D. Del. 1981) in support of its argument that the mere fact that certain of the same patents are at
issue in two different actions makes consolidation appropriate. (Unilin Br. at 4.) Rohm is
4

Case 1:08-cv-00399-RCL

Document 25

Page 8 of 15

distinguishable from the present facts, because the two cases to be consolidated involved the
same parties, and the same two issues: alleged patent invalidity and infringement. Id. at 1309.
No allegations of priority or inequitable conduct were pending in either action, as they are in the
Pergo action. Similarly, Unilin’
s citation of Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Henney, 94 F. Supp.
2d 36, 44 (D.D.C. 2000), is misplaced, because the two cases for which consolidation was
proposed required adjudication of identical legal issues and similar relief (outside the context of
patent infringement or patent interference). (Unilin Br. at 4.)
In contrast, the weight of authority suggests that under the circumstances
presented by the Pergo action and the Uniboard action, consolidation is inappropriate. For
instance, in Furminator, Inc. v. Ontel Products Corp., No. 4:06-cv-1294, 2006 WL 3827522
(E.D. Mo. Dec. 28, 2006), the court refused to consolidate two pending patent actions that
involved “
different patents, different parties and different products.”Id. at *1. In the first case,

that while these cases did present “
some common questions of law and fact with respect to claim
construction and validity . . . [it] is not unusual for there to be numerous cases which share
common questions of law or fact but which are not consolidated.”Id. at *3. The court
particularly emphasized the “
key factual distinction”that because different products were alleged
to have infringed related patents in each action, the infringement analyses were completely
distinct, and therefore consolidation would delay their ultimate resolution. Id.

5

Case 1:08-cv-00399-RCL

Document 25

Filed 07/07/2008

Page 9 of 15

Similarly, in Aerotel, Ltd. v. Verizon Communications Inc., 234 F.R.D. 64
(S.D.N.Y. 2005), the court denied consolidation where the issues in each respective suit did not
significantly overlap. In the first action, the plaintiff-patentee sued for damages for breach of a
licensing agreement, and a judicial declaration that certain of defendants’products were covered
by the patent-in-suit. Id. at 65. In the second action, the same patentee-plaintiff sued for
infringement of the same patent against unrelated defendants. In arguing for consolidation, the
defendant asserted that “
‘
in each case the Court will have to determine whether the Patent is
valid and whether the system through which defendants’prepaid telephone cards operate
infringes that patent.’
”Id. at 66 (citation omitted). While acknowledging that the validity of the
same patent was at issue in both cases, the court held that the different legal standards, different
relief, different parties, and different products at issue created “
substantial non-overlapping
issues that would lead to increased discovery costs and be confusing to the jury.”Id. at 66–67.
Just as the Furminator and Aerotel courts denied consolidation, so too should this
Court. While the Furminator court found the lack of overlap between products in the two cases
proposed to be consolidated to be dispositive, the factual distinction between the Pergo action
and the Uniboard action is even more compelling. No products or infringement issues have been
raised in the Pergo action, and thus the concerns about delay that the Furminator court identified
are even greater here. The Pergo action would be bogged down with discovery related to the
Unilin and Uniboard products, especially sales and damages, in the Uniboard action, which are
unrelated and irrelevant to the Court’
s determination of the interference, priority, and
enforceability issues. Similarly, merely raising a broad common issue of “
validity”of the same
patents, as Unilin has tried to do in its motion, was rejected in Aerotel. The nature of the validity

6

Case 1:08-cv-00399-RCL

Filed 07/07/2008

Page 10 of 15

arguments to be advanced in the Pergo action and the Uniboard action are distinct—and
enforceability issues have thus far been raised only in the Pergo action.
Aside from the issues identified in cases such as Furminator and Aerotel, several
other important attributes of the present cases weigh strongly against consolidation. Unilin has
sought to consolidate the Uniboard and Pergo actions for both the discovery and trial phases.
(Unilin Br. at 1.) Yet, because the issues presented by these cases are so different, consolidation
of discovery will only serve to delay the ultimate adjudication of the issues, while consolidation
for trial will be completely impractical. During discovery in the Uniboard action, because Unilin
and Flooring Industries have asserted infringement, they will likely seek evidence related to,
inter alia, Uniboard’
s manufacturing processes, quality control procedures and protocols, inhouse testing of panels, the design and development of Uniboard’
s product line, development of
installation instructions and videos for Uniboard’
s flooring products, relationships with
employees, distributors, suppliers, and retailers, and physical samples of the flooring products
accused of infringement. In addition, as part of their damages case, Unilin and Flooring
Industries can be expected to seek documents related to, inter alia, Uniboard’
s sales of the
product, royalties received, profits, losses, and marketing and licensing efforts. Unilin will likely
depose many of Uniboard’
s personnel or businesspersons, and both parties will present expert
reports and testimony on the issues of infringement, invalidity, and damages. None of these
documents or depositions are relevant to any of the key issues presented by the Pergo action. In
the Pergo action, the discovery phase will likely center on the inventors of both the Pergo and the
Unilin patents, as well as the contemporaneous documentary and physical evidence of
conception and reduction to practice of the subject-matter of the Unilin and Pergo patents from
the mid-1990s.

While the discovery phases in the Pergo action and the Uniboard action will in
large part be mutually exclusive, 3 the trial phases of these actions will be completely
incompatible. Unilin does not even acknowledge that the Uniboard action will be tried to a jury,
while the Pergo action will be the subject of a bench trial. The issues of overlapping subject
matter and enforceability—the critical issues in the Pergo action—are issues of law entrusted to
the sole discretion of the Court. See Advance Transformer Co. v. Levinson, 837 F.2d 1081, 1084
(Fed. Cir. 1988) (noting that a Section 291 action requires a determination by the court as to
whether two patents claim the same subject matter); see also PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. v.
Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., 225 F.3d 1315, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (noting that inequitable conduct
“
[is] not an issue for a jury to decide,”but is instead a question of law that is typically handled in
a bench trial).4 In contrast, the issues of infringement, validity, and damages—the critical issues
in the Uniboard action—are issues of fact to be heard by a jury, at least in the first instance. See,
e.g., Ferguson Beauregard/Logic Controls v. Mega Sys., Inc., 350 F.3d 1327, 1338 (Fed. Cir.
2003); Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 457 F.3d 1293, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2006), cert.
denied, 127 S. Ct. 2270 (2007). Presenting these contrasting issues in a single proceeding, as
Unilin has suggested, will serve only to confuse the jury. The concepts of infringement,

conclusion applies here, especially without any identification of such overlapping witnesses and evidence.

these attorneys may offer in the Pergo action would be completely irrelevant to the Uniboard action, where no
Pergo products or patents are at issue.

invalidity, and damages are complex enough without subjecting a lay jury to evidence relating to
interference-in-fact, priority, and enforceability. 5 Keeping these proceedings separate would
thus further judicial economy and prevent the inevitable confusion that would result from the
consolidation.
Unilin also overlooks the possibility that the Pergo action could moot some or all
of the issues in the Uniboard action. In its Amended Complaint, Pergo has extensively outlined
the basis for its claim to priority. Based upon the limited discovery that will be necessary in that
case (because the parties need not seek any evidence related to infringement and damages
allegations in order to proceed to a bench trial), this case would likely proceed expediently
(absent consolidation) to resolution. If the Court determines that the Pergo patents have priority
over the Unilin patents, then it would conclusively resolve the issues raised in the Uniboard
action, without the need for costly discovery or a full-blown jury trial. Consolidation would thus
not only delay resolution of the Pergo case, but it could result in the needless expenditure of the
parties’and the Court’
s resources on an action that may ultimately be rendered moot.
C.

BENEFITS OF CONSOLIDATION CAN BE OTHERWISE ACHIEVED
Unilin argues that consolidation will achieve two principal advantages: (i) the

briefs and hearing required to construe the claims of the Unilin patents. (Unilin Br. at 5.) Yet,
both of these gains to efficiency can be achieved without the drawbacks of delay and confusion
that would otherwise accompany consolidation. With regard to discovery, in prior litigations

5

Even though the issues in the Pergo action (including interference-in-fact, priority, and enforceability) are
within the exclusive province of the Court, Unilin nonetheless seeks to include this evidence in a consolidated
proceeding before a jury, which is not only inefficient, but which will undoubtedly create confusion.

9

Case 1:08-cv-00399-RCL

these parties and their counsel have entered into agreements to share discovery materials
between related actions, and there is no reason that such agreements could not be entered into
here. Thus, there should be no need for duplicative document productions, even absent
consolidation. Nor is there any reason to expect that witnesses will be called for depositions
twice, only to be asked the same questions again. It is likewise unreasonable for Unilin to argue
that there will be any real inefficiency in the claim construction process if the actions are not
combined. With both cases pending before the same judge and the opposing parties being
represented by the same counsel, any risk of inconsistent or duplicative argument—either
deliberate or inadvertent—is negligible. Indeed, because the comparisons in the two cases are
different (patent-to-patent vs. patent-to-product), the disputed claim terms at issue in each case
may very well be different. Plus, the construction of the Pergo patent claims will have no
bearing on the Uniboard action. Thus, just as consolidating discovery is all but certain to cause
delay, combining claim construction proceedings in the two actions is more likely to result in an
unwieldy and inefficient procedure.
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, Uniboard respectfully requests that the Court
deny Unilin’
s motion for consolidation of the Uniboard action with the Pergo action.
