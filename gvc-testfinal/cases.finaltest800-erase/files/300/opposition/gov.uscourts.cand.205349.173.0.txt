Defendants Holtzbrinck Networks GmbH and Holtzbrinck Ventures GmbH (collectively, the

“Holtzbrinck Defendants”) hereby join in the Opposition brief filed by defendant StudiVZ Ltd.

(“StudiVZ”). However, the Holtzbrinck Defendants also oppose Facebook’s motion on an additional

4

ground because they are not in exactly the same position as StudiVZ.

argument concerning the Holtzbrinck Defendants. The entire focus was on the then-existing disputes
between Facebook and StudiVZ only. (Dkt. 77 at 1:4, 1:8-9, 1:24-25; 2:22-23, 4:9-10; 4:16-19). The
Holtzbrinck Defendants opposed that motion, arguing that there was no need for a continuance of their
motion to dismiss because there were no outstanding discovery disputes between them and Facebook.
On January 28, 2009, the District Court ruled on Facebook’s Motion to Enlarge Time:

10

“A review of the record and the parties’ papers reveals that
Facebook has failed to demonstrate any reason to continue the
February 13, 2009 hearing as to either defendant with respect to
forum non conveniens, or as to Holtzbrinck with respect to
personal jurisdiction.”

11

(Dkt. 92 at 2:15-17). The Court granted Facebook’s request to file a supplemental brief, but only
as to personal jurisdiction over StudiVZ and only “in light of any newly discovered material,” but

15

did not grant Facebook’s request to file a supplemental opposition as to the Holtzbrinck Defendants or

16

as to any other issue. (Id. at 2:15-22). The Court continued the hearing as to both motions to

17

dismiss and all issues because of “judicial economy” and because a brief continuance was

18

“unlikely to prejudice any party.” (Id. at 2:18-20).1

19

Facebook was not permitted to use the extra time created by the continuance of the motions to

20

dismiss to propound new discovery against the Holtzbrinck Defendants. The Holtzbrinck Defendants’

21

motion should have already been heard. Their motion should not be continued yet again.

Moving the hearing date (yet again) would prejudice the Holtzbrinck Defendants if it resulted in them being subject
to new discovery requests.
