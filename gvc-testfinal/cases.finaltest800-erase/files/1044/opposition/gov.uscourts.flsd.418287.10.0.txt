ARGUMENT AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
The Amended Complaint Properly Complies with Rule 8 of the Fed. R. Civ. P.
On February 21, 2013, a nearly identical Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 7] was filed by Mark
Hanna in a similar student loan delinquency case filed by the undersigned in the Southern
District: United States v. Mark Hanna, 9:13-cv-80060-KAM. The motion was denied by the
Court on March 14, 2010 [D.E. 10]. The Court held: "[T]he complaint provides adequate factual
basis to support this cause of action. The additional information sought by Defendant can be
obtained by discovery." The instant motion should likewise be denied.
It is a general principle of law that the rule relating to pleading claims for relief is to be
liberally construed. Hanson v. Hunt Oil Co., 398 F.2d 578, 581 (8th Cir. 1968)(this rule requiring
that claim be a plain and short statement showing that pleader is entitled to relief is to be liberally
construed). In addition, complaints are construed favorably to their drafters, as the initial
complaint need not contain long and drawn-out allegations to be deemed sufficient. See Hrubec
v. National R.R. Passenger Corp. 981 F.2d 962 (7th Cir. 1992)(under system of notice pleading,
complaint need not narrate all relevant facts or recite law; all it has to do is set out claim for
relief). Finally, Courts must also consider all allegations and statements contained within the
complaints exhibits when determining whether or not Rule 8 has been properly complied with.
International Schools Services, Inc. v. AAUG Ins. Co., Ltd.,

2012 WL 5192265

(S.D.Fla.,2012)(to decide a motion to dismiss, courts generally consider only the allegations
contained in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record.).
Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. states, in relevant part, that a pleading that states a claim for
relief must contain:
(2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is

entitled to relief; and
In the current action, Plaintiff's Complaint specifically states that a debt is owed to the
United States in the amount of $38,555.14 as of November 23, 2010. Plaintiff also states that the
Defendant has refused to pay same. Finally, Plaintiff's Exhibit "A", which is incorporated into
the allegations of the Amended Complaint, specifically details the loan figures, the type of loan
provided and its purpose, and when the default occurred. Therefore, Plaintiff has properly met its
pleading burden pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss must be
denied.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny Defendant's Motion to
Dismiss.
