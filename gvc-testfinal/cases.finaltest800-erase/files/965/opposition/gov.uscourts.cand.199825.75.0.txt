I.

INTRODUCTION

6

The case at hand concerns certain disclosures that were provided to Plaintiff (and

7

potentially each class member) by their mortgage broker and/or Jay J. Ralston (“Plaintiff”) when

8

their Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage (“ARM”) loans were originated, processed and/or closed.

9

An Option ARM loan, including the loan products offered by MIG, has an adjustable interest rate,

10

and allows the borrower to make one of several possible payment amounts each month. Typically,

11

there are four payment options including a minimum payment option that can result in deferred

12

interest or negative amortization, an interest-only option that allows for full payment of monthly

13

interest to allow the borrower to avoid deferred interest, and two fully amortized payment options

14

(based on either a 30-year or 15-year loan) that allow the borrower to pay the loan off more

15

quickly by paying down principal and interest. Accordingly, while some borrowers’ loans may be

16

negatively amortized, others’ loans may be fully amortized, depending on each borrower’s

17

payment history and the payment option selected by the borrower each month.

18

The question raised by Plaintiff’s claims on the merits is whether Plaintiff received

19

adequate and appropriate disclosures from MIG, prior to loan funding, regarding the interest

20

rate(s) applicable to his Option ARM loan and the possibility of negative amortization occurring if

21

he were to make payments under the minimum payment option.

22

The putative classes defined in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) include a

23

California-only and a nationwide class of “[a]ll individuals who, within the four year period

24

preceding the filing of Plaintiff’s Complaint …, received an Option ARM loan through Defendant

25

1

Plaintiff has been previously informed Mortgage Investors Group, Inc. does not possess or
maintain any responsive documents. Plaintiff’s discovery requests have only been propounded
upon Mortgage Investors Group, a general partnership. Therefore, this motion should only have
been directed to Mortgage Investors Group, a general partnership and MIG assumes directing the
motion at Mortgage Investors Group, Inc. was Plaintiff error.

[MIG] on their primary residence ….” FAC at pg. 11. Plaintiff does not allege in the FAC, and

2

cannot allege, that each putative class member’s loan was negatively amortized. Importantly,

3

there is no operating pleading at this point. MIG’s Motion to Dismiss was granted in part and no

4

new pleadings have been filed.

5

Similarly, Plaintiff does not exclude from the class borrowers whose loans have paid off

6

and thus who no longer have a right to rescind their loan and for whom other potential remedies

7

may be foreclosed. See, e.g., King v. State of California, 784 F.2d 910, 913 (9th Cir. 1986).

8
The parties’ current discovery dispute centers on Plaintiff’s entitlement to class discovery
9
prior to class certification. MIG objects to producing class member-specific information prior to
10
certification of a class. MIG has remained consistent with this position throughout the litigation
PALMER, LOMBARDI & DONOHUE LLP
888 West 6th Street, 12th Floor
Los Angeles, California 90017

11
and stated in its Joint Rule 26(f) Report that its position is that it is inequitable to impose the high
12
cost and burden on Defendant(s) of classwide discovery when the pleadings have not been
13
finalized and the probability that a class will be certified is highly speculative given every that not
14
a single Court of Appeal nationwide has certified a class for rescission under TILA in these
15
circumstances. (See, Rule 26(f) Report, attached as Exhibit A.) The flood of dismissals of similar
16
complaints around the country on the pleadings, and in California specifically, have only served to
17
bolster MIG’s position. See Exhibit “B.”
18
The discovery Plaintiff is now seeking does not address class certification issues.
19
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses (“Motion”) seeks information that
20
could only be relevant, if at all, to possible resolution of the merits of putative class members’
21
individual claims (and/or enforcement of any relief ordered by the Court after trial). Therefore it
22
should be denied by the Court.

BACKGROUND AND HISTORY

24
MIG has produced thousands of pages of responsive documents to Plaintiff’s numerous
25
inspection demands, including every Option ARM loan product type originated by MIG. MIG has
26
made attempts to address Plaintiff’s dissatisfaction with its responses, including (i) addressing
27
Plaintiff’s concerns in substance (with detailed explanation of its position); (ii) forwarding further

1

documents; (iii) and requesting that Plaintiff advise MIG with specificity regarding what

2

additional documents he seeks. However, despite these efforts, Plaintiff has filed his Motion in an

3

attempt to have the Court order the production of documents. Plaintiff argues that the documents

4

this Motion seeks are both 1) relevant; and 2) not burdensome for MIG to produce. While these

5

factors generally provide the basis for resolving a discovery dispute, all parties (as well as the

6

Court) are aware of the special current circumstances of this case; circumstances which make

7

those arguments moot. The specifics of the documents requested take a back seat to the specifics

8

of class certifications and the evolving universe of similar ARM cases currently being litigated.

9

First, as a threshold issue, it is impracticable for the Court to make a determination as to

10

whether the information and/or documents requested by Plaintiff be produced at this time because,

11

currently, there is no operative pleading. On May 21, 2008, MIG and Mortgage Investors Group,

12

Inc. filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“Motion to Dismiss”). A

13

hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on August 15, 2008. On March 16, 2009, Judge

14

Jeremy Fogel entered an order (1) Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants’ Motion to

15

Dismiss with Leave to Amend; and (2) Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend. To date,

16

Plaintiff has not yet filed a Second Amended complaint. Therefore, neither the Court nor MIG

17

could possibly know in what context to analyze which specific documents are required for class

18

certification (and otherwise) at this time.

19

As the Court is aware, this case is one of more than 40 similar TILA Option ARM putative

20

class actions currently pending in California Federal court against a host of different defendants.

21

Many of these cases have been dismissed at the pleading stage, with many more dismissals

22

expected to be granted. In fact, a Motion to Dismiss was handed down in the Southern District

23

within the last week. (See Exhibit B). Given the fact that no operative pleading exists in this case,

24

along with the increasingly strong likelihood that once an operative pleading is in place it will be

25

dismissed, Plaintiff’s Motion is clearly premature, and should be denied by this Court.

26

Additionally, courts in similarly situated matters involving Option ARM class actions,

27

have already ruled on similar discovery motions, including the case of Jordan v. Paul Financial

28

LLC, CV07-04496-SI (N.D. Cal.). The facts of the case at hand are nearly identical to those in

There Is Currently No Operative Pleading To Guide Defendant And/Or The
Court.

Plaintiff’s Motion outlines the long procedural history of this case and the efforts made to

8

meet and confer. MIG makes no contentions regarding Plaintiff’s recitation of the procedural

9

history at this time because the only fact relevant to the parties’ discovery dispute is that on March

10

16, 2009, two days before Plaintiff’s Motion was filed, this Court granted (in part) MIG and

11

Mortgage Investor Group, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss and granted Plaintiff Leave to Amend. A

12

copy of the Court’s order has been attached as Exhibit C. To date, Plaintiff has not filed an

13

amended complaint. Without an operative pleading in place, there is no logical or efficient way

14

for MIG to determine the relevancy of the requested documentation, nor is it possible for the Court

15

to decide on same in ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion. Plaintiff’s Motion should be denied.

17
18

California Courts Have Heard Nearly Identical Discovery Motions To That Of
Plaintiff And Have Denied Said Motions.

California courts handling similar actions have faced motions to compel discovery which

19

are similar, if not nearly identical to the one at issue here. In Jordan, the Plaintiff sought the

20

following information in its Motion to Compel Discovery:

21
22
23
24
25

1.

The name and contact information of each putative class member to whom

defendant sold an ARM during the liability period.
2.

The identity of all subsequent purchasers and assignees of ARM loans entered into

between defendant and all putative class members.
3.

Five randomly-selected loan files for each subsequent purchaser or assignee of the

26

loans at issue; a complete copy of each version of the loan documents defendant used during the

27

liability period; and a copy of each of the loans defendant sold during the liability period.

28

Defendant in Jordan objected to the production of each category of information because
-5CV08-00536 JF

OPPOSITION OF DEFENDANT TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES

Case5:08-cv-00536-JF Document75

1

the identities of the putative class members, the information possessed by the class members, and

2

the identities of all subsequent purchasers or assignees was not relevant to class certification.

3

With regard to the loan files, Defendant in Jordan had agreed to provide a complete copy of each

4

version of its loan documents during the relevant time period, as well as five redacted loan files for

5

borrowers whose loans were assigned to the entity that purchased Plaintiff’s loan. [This practice

6

is nearly identical to the production efforts undertaken by MIG in this matter.]

7

In each instance, the Court in Jordan denied Plaintiff’s requests for documents. With

8

regards to the contact information of each putative class member, the Court ruled that “such a

9

request would not assist Plaintiff in meeting his burden of establishing that class certification is

888 West 6th Street, 12th Floor

proper.” (See Exhibit D.)
With regard to the identity of all subsequent purchasers and assignees, the Court stated that

12

while it understood that such subsequent purchasers/assignees may well be liable under Federal

13

law if the class is certified, the Court did not find it necessary for defendant to provide such

14

information before the issue or class certification is determined. The Court ruled it was not

15

relevant to class certification. (See Exhibit D.)

16

Finally, with regard to the randomly selected loan files, the Court found that the production

17

of each version of the defendant’s loan documents, as well as the redacted loan files from

18

borrowers whose loans were assigned to the entity that purchased plaintiff’s loans were sufficient.

19

The Court ruled said information is sufficient for the purposes of class certification “because all

20

plaintiff will need is a copy of each iteration of defendant’s ARM loan documents. The Court

21

does not see how knowledge of which specific type of documents was attached to loans that were

22

later acquired … will be relevant to class certification.” (See Exhibit D).

23

Importantly, these three categories of documents are exactly the type of documents

24

Plaintiff is requesting in its current Motion. As in Jordan, Plaintiff’s requests should be denied.

25

Plaintiff argues in its Motion that Jordan can be differentiated from the case at hand because the

26

parties in Jordan “agreed to limit initial discovery to issues directly related to class certification.”

27

This argument is misplaced. The fact is that the Court’s Order in Jordan, does not make any

28

reference to the parties voluntarily limiting the discovery to class issues. Therefore, Plaintiff’s

1

inference that such a stipulation played a role in the Court’s ruling is pure speculation. Plaintiff

2

also attempts to differentiate Jordan by stating that 1) Ralston has demonstrated that the

3

subsequent purchasers were “directly involved in crafting the loan terms passed to class members;

4

and 2) Ralston has demonstrated why the sample loans are relevant to class certification.

5

disagrees. The plaintiff in Jordan made similar arguments as to why the sample loans were

6

relevant and these arguments did not persuade the court. Additionally, Plaintiff has been given the

7

name of the subsequent purchaser his loan, Countrywide Home Loans, an entity which Plaintiff

8

presumably will be adding as a defendant if and when he files his second amended Complaint.

9

Again, Plaintiff’s demands are premature.

MIG

10

Regardless of how Plaintiff attempt to spin it, the uncontroverted reality is that a Judge in

11

the Northern District of California has recently ruled on the exact same categories of documents

12

requested here by Plaintiff and denied each one. MIG requests this Court do the same.

13
14
15

C.

Plaintiff’s Request For Information Regarding Subsequent Purchasers Should
Be Denied.

Plaintiff’s Motion seeks any and all documents relating to the identity of any subsequent

16

purchaser or assignee of the Option ARM loans sold by MIG during the relevant time period.

17

Plaintiff’s Document Request Nos. 1, 2 and 5 seek loan-specific documents identifying the

18

subsequent purchaser or assignee of each putative class member’s loan. MIG has objected to

19

Plaintiff’s requests on various grounds set forth in Exhibit E.

20

In response to Plaintiff’s requests, MIG provided Plaintiff with the name of the entity that

21

purchased his loan after funding, Countrywide Home Loans. Plaintiff’s request that MIG produce

22

information identifying the assignee or subsequent purchaser of each putative class member’s loan

23

should be denied.

24

As with individual borrower information, data regarding the assignment of each putative

25

class member’s loan is not relevant to the merits of Plaintiff’s individual claim, or whether a class

26

should be certified. Clearly, the finding of any liability on the part of MIG will rest purely on the

27

disclosures received by Mr. Ralston (and subsequent putative class members) at or before loan

28

funding which were events that occurred prior to the assignment or sale of each putative class
-7CV08-00536 JF

OPPOSITION OF DEFENDANT TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES

Case5:08-cv-00536-JF Document75

1

member’s loan. Similarly, subsequent purchaser information does not bear on the question of

2

whether a class can properly be certified in this case. Information regarding the subsequent

3

purchaser and/or assignee of each putative class member’s loan does not offer any support as to

4

the questions of whether Plaintiff’s claims are typical or if commonality is satisfied. Indeed, the

5

fact that the putative class members’ loans were assigned to numerous purchasers and securitized

6

into different loan pools counsels against certification of the putative class as defined in the FAC.

7

Plaintiff already has received permission to add and MIG has produced all of Ralston’s loan file.2

8

Second, this action would become extremely complicated and costly if Plaintiff is

888 West 6th Street, 12th Floor
Los Angeles, California 90017

Filed04/02/09 Page8 of 18

permitted to bring in all of the subsequent purchasers and/or assignees for each putative class

10

member prior to class certification. There are substantial issues that should be resolved before the

11

Court permits Plaintiff to pursue class discovery. One threshold issue is the scope of assignee

12

liability. Plaintiff’s most recent pleading does not allege the basis for a finding of liability against

13

any entity other than MIG. It does not explain plaintiff’s theory of liability against the purchaser

14

of Plaintiff’s loan. While TILA permits assignee liability in certain circumstances, 15 U.S.C. §

15

1641(a), (c), the holder in due course doctrine ordinarily bars assignee liability under California

16

law for negotiable instruments. See Cal. Com. Code §§ 3302, 3305(b); Finalco, Inc. v. Roosevelt,

17

235 Cal. App. 3d 1301, 1305 (1991). The scope of assignee liability under TILA and California

18

law would more than likely be raised by Countrywide Home Loans, should it be added as a

19

defendant when Plaintiff chooses to amend its complaint.

20

A second threshold issue that should be resolved prior to involving the

21

purchasers/assignees is class certification. There are numerous reasons why class certification for

22

Plaintiff’s liability and damages claims is not appropriate.3 Indeed in the Jordan case, the Court

23
24
25
26
27
28

2

Plaintiff does not have standing to pursue TILA damages or rescission against the subsequent purchasers and
assignees of loans other than his own, because he has not been injured by such entities. See Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).
3
For example, looking at the relief sought by plaintiff alone, case law holds that a right to rescission cannot be
awarded on a class basis. See Andrews v. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570 (7th Cir. 2008). ; McKenna v. First
Horizon Home Loan Corp., 475 F.3d 418, 423 (1st Cir. 2007). Similarly, the damages questions raised by plaintiff’s
claims are highly individualized. While not clear, plaintiff appears to be seeking actual damages in the form of
negative amortization paid by putative class members. As an initial matter, there is no basis to conclude that each
putative class member’s loan was negatively amortized. Moreover, even if the recovery of the amount of any negative

1

has denied plaintiff’s class certification motion. The identification of the assignees (and/or trusts

2

and trustees) is not necessary for the Court to make that decision. It also may be

3

appropriate for the Court to resolve the merits of Plaintiff’s individual claims against MIG,

4

possibly by dispositive motion, prior to bringing in the purchasers/assignees. If Plaintiff’s claims

5

against MIG fail, clearly there is no basis for the parties to litigate the scope of assignee liability

6

and the merits of putative class members’ potential claims against those entities. Plaintiff has

7

pointed to the case of Pence v. Union Fidelity Mortg., Inc. 2008 WL 5102242 No. 08-CV-0089-

8

WQH (JMA) (S.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2008) as an example of a case in which a court allowed a plaintiff

9

to receive discovery regarding the identities of subsequent purchasers/assignees prior to class

10

certification. However, Pence is clearly differentiable from the case at hand. First, in Pence,

11

Plaintiff requested information regarding number of ARM loans sold during the liability period.

12

MIG has already given Plaintiff this information in its interrogatory responses. Second, the

13

plaintiff in Pence requested the location of loan documents and other relevant information

14

concerning the loan practices of the defendant. Not only has MIG already produced over 32

15

different types of loan documents, but MIG also fails to see how the loan practices of MIG would

16

be revealed by discovery of whom MIG sold loans to.

17

Finally (and most importantly), the court in Pence made a conclusion regarding the scope

18

of discovery due in part to the fact that the defendant in that case had failed to appear. The court

19

did not offer any analysis as to how (or if) the requested documentation would assist in class

20

certification because there was not any opposition. In the current matter, not only is there

21

opposition, but MIG has already identified the assignees of Plaintiff’s loan – Countrywide Home

22

Loans. Therefore, Plaintiff’s attempt to rely on the findings in Pence fails.

23

There is little doubt that it would best serve all parties (and potential parties) for the Court

24
25
26
27

amortization was appropriate, the determination of such amount for any one class member will be fact-intensive and
time-consuming. Indeed, courts have found on numerous occasions that actual damages claims under TILA are not
suitable for class certification. See, e.g., Turner v. Beneficial Corp., 242 F.3d 1023, 1028 (11th Cir. 2000); Perrone v.
Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 232 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir. 2000). See also In re Smith, 289 F.3d 1155, 1157 (9th
Cir. 2002) (citing Turner and Perrone and holding that detrimental reliance is an element of a TILA actual damages
claim).

Firstly, putative class members do not serve the role of witnesses prior to class

10

certification. Putative class members do not possess information that is relevant to either

11

resolution of the merits of Mr. Ralston’s individual claim, or the question whether a class should

12

be certified. A mortgage transaction is individual and personal to the borrower. Whether the

13

disclosures Mr. Ralston received from MIG or his mortgage broker violated federal or state law

14

depends entirely on facts pertinent only to Mr. Ralston’s transaction.

15

For example, the TILA claim in the First Amended Complaint alleges that MIL violated

16

TILA as to Mr. Ralston’s transaction because it failed to “clearly and conspicuously” disclose,

17

among other things, information pertaining to operation of the interest rate and the risk of negative

18

amortization. Each of the questions raised by Plaintiff’s TILA claim must be resolved with

19

respect to Mr. Ralston’s loan; the disclosures received by other borrowers (from MIG, their

20

mortgage broker, or some other source) will not bear on MIG’s potential liability to Mr. Ralston.

21

The same is true for the remaining claims in the case, which range from the Second Cause

22

of Action, which brings a claim under California’s Unfair Competition Law, Bus. & Prof. Code §§

23

17200, et seq. (“UCL”) predicated entirely on the alleged TILA violations described above, to

24

Plaintiff’s claim in the Third Cause of Action for “Fraudulent Omissions” based on a purported

25

failure by MIG to disclose material facts that allegedly would have caused plaintiff not to enter

26

into the loan had the facts not been “omitted.” (But of course, at preset, there is no operating

27

pleading.) Resolution of each of these claims rests in part on the disclosures or representations

28

that each individual received in connection with their loan transaction, whether written or verbal,

6

disclosures.

7

For the same reason, information possessed by each individual borrower with respect to

8

the funding of their loan by MIG is not necessary to determine whether plaintiff’s claims can be

9

resolved on a class basis. Whether a class can properly be certified pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23

10

will depend on the substantive nature of the named plaintiff’s legal claims and the type of

11

evidence needed to establish those claims and defenses. See, e.g., General Telephone Co. v.

12

Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) ("the class determination generally involves considerations that

13

are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action'"); see also

14

Brown v. Fed. Express Corp., --- F.R.D. ---, 2008 WL 906517, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 26, 2008)

15

(same). To the extent that the various forms of disclosures used by MIG during the class period is

16

relevant to the class certification inquiry, MIG has agreed to produce the various form disclosures

17

that it used for Option ARM loans during the class period, as well as redacted sample loan files

18

from other borrowers who obtained Option ARM loans from MIG.

19

Resolution of the claims in the complaint do not depend on pattern or practice, and

20

identifying other class members will not assist the Court in determining typicality or superiority.

21

Satisfaction of the typicality requirement, for example, turns on whether resolution of plaintiff’s

22

individual claim will resolve each putative class member’s claim. See Sweet v. Pfizer, 232 F.R.D.

23

360, 367-69 (C.D. Cal. 2005). If the Court needs to review individual facts pertinent to each

24

putative class member to determine if the requirements of Fed. Civ. P. 23 are satisfied (not to

25

mention to resolve the merits of the class claims), class certification is not appropriate. See id.;

26

Metcalf v. Household Int’l, Inc., No. 99CV2066, 2001 WL 1608012, at *2-3 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 10,

Additionally, the putative class members have a legitimate expectation of privacy, and

4

releasing borrowers’ private loan and contact information to plaintiff would violate that privacy

5

right. It is unclear whether Plaintiff seeks Borrower contact information. Plaintiff has not moved

6

to compel responses that specifically sought that information. Plaintiff asserts that there are no

7

serious privacy considerations and that if there were privacy considerations, they are alleviated by

8

Plaintiff’s proposed protective order. (Motion at page 9.) MIG disagrees. First of all, the

9

proposed protective order would not protect the privacy of third party borrowers and their personal

10

and financial information. Secondly, Plaintiff has not made a showing of a “legitimate need to

11

know” which individuals obtained an Option ARM loan from MIG, where they live, what their

12

loan number was, and when they received the loan. Simply the fact that these individuals obtained

13

an Option ARM loan is private information bearing on their finances. Even if Plaintiff was

14

permitted access to the borrowers’ information, Plaintiff has not proposed giving the borrowers

15

any prior form of notice or right to opt-in or opt-out of communications. Instead, Plaintiff simply

16

argues that the existence of the proposed protective order is enough to protect the individuals’

17

privacy. It is not, because it does not provide notice to each borrower of counsel’s intention to

18

contact them.

19

Plaintiff’s reliance on Pioneer Electronics (USA), Inc. v. The Superior Court, 40 Cal. 4th

20

360 (2007), is misplaced. In Pioneer, a pivotal fact in the court’s decision to allow pre-

21

certification discovery of the names of putative class members was that those individuals had

22

already complained to Pioneer regarding the defects in the company’s DVD players. Accordingly,

23

those individuals had a reduced expectation of privacy and they potentially possessed information

24

that was relevant to the plaintiff’s claim, that is, the defective nature of Pioneer’s DVD player.

25

Further, and importantly, the court required that notice go out to the putative class members prior

26

to the release of their contact information to Plaintiff’s counsel.

27
28

Puerto v. The Superior Court, 158 Cal. App. 4th 1242 (2d Dist. 2008), is similarly
distinguishable. In Puerto, the plaintiff sought contact information regarding witnesses who

Case5:08-cv-00536-JF Document75

1

possessed discoverable information regarding the plaintiff’s claims, and the defendant had already

2

disclosed the names of the individuals, but not their contact information.

3

In this case, there is no basis for the Court to conclude that the putative class members

4

have a reduced expectation of privacy, as in Pioneer, or that they have discoverable information

5

that justifies an invasion of their privacy right. Moreover, the Court’s decision on class

6

certification in this case is not imminent, there are good grounds for a class not to be certified, and

7

Plaintiff’s notification of Mr. Ralston’s claims to thousands of putative class members will be

8

unnecessarily injurious to MIG.4 Despite over fifty copycat lawsuits to this one being filed, not a

9

single class has been certified.

Importantly, Northern District Magistrate Judge Seeborg ruled on a similar discovery issue

11

in the matter of Mandriguez v. World Savings, et al. No. C07-4497 JF CRS) (N.D. Cal. 2008).

12

(Attached as Exhibit F). In that case (with facts extremely similar to those at issue here), the

13

plaintiff moved to compel defendants to produce the contact information for putative class

14

members. Judge Seeborg, citing multiple cases, ruled that “releasing the [contact information] of

15

the putative class members will not help Plaintiffs reach their burden of demonstrating that class

16

certification is proper.” Judge Seeborg opined that it was an open question as to whether such

17

information would be discoverable should the class be certified. MIG requests that the Court

18

follow its previous ruling in this similarly situated case and deny Plaintiff’s request.

19

D.

20

Regarding Plaintiff’s other requests, MIG has already agreed to provide documents in

Plaintiff’s Request For Additional Loan Documents Should Be Denied.

21

response to Plaintiff’s Request No. 4, which seeks “[a] complete copy of each version of the ARM

22

Loan documents you provided to borrowers” during the relevant time period. MIG has produced

23

thousands of documents including every option ARM loan product type originated by MIG. By

24

type, MIG means versions of loan products such as a loan where the interest is fixed for the first

25

five years, but thereafter is variable. However exact language of the loan contracts and disclosures

26

could have changed with every single loan. It is impossible for MIG to know without examining

1

every one of the thousands of loans. What Plaintiff wants is the documents produced of the

2

various loan types but with the data filled in for the individual loan. Since this data changed on a

3

loan by loan basis, it would be entirely irrelevant to class certification.

Request No. 3 seeks five randomly selected loan files for each subsequent purchaser or

5

assignee of putative class members’ loans during the relevant time period. Again, MIG has

6

produced five Countrywide Home Loan loan files redacted of borrowers’ private information and

7

redacted as to each Option ARM loan product originated by MIG. The borrower data on each loan

8

file is extremely sensitive borrower information. Further, it is different on every single loan, and

9

therefore irrelevant to class certification. While not mentioned by Plaintiff, MIG has agreed to

10

produce, and will produce, five redacted loan files for borrowers whose loans were assigned to

11

Countrywide Home Loans. The types of disclosures MIG provided to borrowers at the time of

12

loan origination were not impacted by the entity that subsequently purchased the loans after

13

funding. As such, there is no logic to MIG producing a certain number of loan files that were sold

14

to each subsequent purchaser. The production of such files would be costly and time-consuming

15

with little benefit to the litigation. MIG’s production of its various form disclosures used during

16

the class period obviates the need for production of additional randomly-selected loan files. This

17

case revolves around disclosures provided to borrowers; most of the documents in the loan files do

18

not pertain to the disclosures and are irrelevant to Plaintiff’s claims.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Discovery is premature,

3

misplaced and seeks documents which are neither relevant nor appropriate for Plaintiff’s case.

4

MIG will continue to work with Plaintiff on discovery as the case progresses. MIG respectfully

5

requests that the Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion in its entirety.
