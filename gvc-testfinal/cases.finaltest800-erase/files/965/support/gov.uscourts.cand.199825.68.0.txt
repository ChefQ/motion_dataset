INTRODUCTION

2

Plaintiff brought this class action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated

3

(“Class Members”) to challenge the legality of certain Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (“ARM”)

4

loans sold by Defendants Mortgage Investors Group, Inc. and Mortgage Investors Group, a general

5

partnership, (“MIG” or “Defendants”) to Plaintiff and Class Members. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges

6

that Defendants failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose: (i) the actual interest rate on the loans;

7

(ii) that following the payment schedule provided will result in negative amortization such that the

8

principal balance will automatically increase; and (iii) that the initial interest rate provided did not

9

reflect the actual interest that Plaintiff and Class members would be paying on the loans, in violation

10

of the Truth In Lending Act (“TILA”), 15 U.S.C. §§1601, et seq., the California Unfair Competition

11

Law, Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq., and common law.1

12

Defendants did not service the loans it sold, but instead sold them off to larger investors or

13

“subsequent purchasers” almost immediately. These subsequent purchasers are liable for all TILA

14

violations. See 15 U.S.C. §1641(d)(1). Further, discovery in this case has confirmed that the

15

subsequent purchasers were not merely bystanders, but were actively involved in the fraudulent

16

concealment and nondisclosure of material facts. In fact, the subsequent purchasers dictated which

17

disclosures were included (or excluded) from the loan documents that Defendants provided to

18

Plaintiff and Class Members from the beginning. 2

19

With this Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses (“Motion”) Plaintiff seeks two

20

categories of information—each of which is directly relevant to the claims asserted and reasonably

21

calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible information: (1) the identity of subsequent

22

purchasers who directed MIG to use, and perhaps authored, the loan documents at issue here; and (2)

23

loan level information to demonstrate that Plaintiff’s claims are typical of those Class Members’

24

claims.

RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND STATEMENT OF FACTS
On January 27, 2008, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against Defendants pursuant to the Truth

3

in Lending Act (“TILA”), 15 U.S.C. §§1601, et seq., California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”),

4

Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq., and other statutory and common law. On May 8, 2008,

5

Plaintiff filed his FAC. (Docket No. 17.)

6

On May 21, 2008, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended

7

Complaint (“Motion to Dismiss”). A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on August 15,

8

2008. (Docket No. 25.)

9

On August 21, 2008, Plaintiff served his Requests for Documents to Defendants, Set One

10

(“Requests”) and Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One (“Interrogatories”). Anderson Decl.,

11

¶3. Defendants responded to Plaintiff’s Requests on September 22, 2008, but failed to produce any

12

responsive documents. Anderson Decl., Ex. B. Defendants also refused to fully respond to

13

Interrogatories. Anderson Decl., Ex. C.

14

On October 3, 2008, the parties met and conferred regarding Defendants’ objections and

15

deficient responses to Plaintiff’s discovery. On October 6, 2008, Plaintiff also requested that the

16

parties agree upon a stipulated protective order to govern the production of potentially confidential

17

information in the case. Anderson Decl., ¶6.

18

On October 9, 2008, Plaintiff proposed to Defendants a Stipulated Protective Order which,

19

among other things, specifically addressed the production of private consumer information.

20

Anderson Decl., Ex. D.

21

The parties met and conferred further on October 31, 2008. Defendants agreed to

22

supplement their prior responses and produce responsive documents by November 3, 2008.

23

Anderson Decl., ¶8.

24

Defendants did not supplement their responses until December 4, 2008, however, and did not

25

produce any documents until December 15, 2008. Anderson Decl., Exs. E, F; ¶10. In response to

26

Document Request No. 4, Defendants produced a copy of each loan version, but much of the loan-

27

specific information, such as the initial interest rate in the Notes, was redacted. Id., ¶10. The loan

28

versions did not include any payments schedules or Truth In Lending Disclosure Statements

(“TILDS”) provided to Class Members. In response to Document Request No. 3 (seeking five (5)

2

randomly selected loan files for each subsequent purchaser), Defendants produced a handful of loan

3

files sold to Countrywide, the purchaser of the named Plaintiff’s loan, but refused to produce sample

4

loan files sold to any other investor, arguing that such discovery was premature. Id., ¶10, Ex. F.

5

These loan files included TILDS and the Notes. However, all loan-specific and borrower specific

6

information was redacted from the documents, including all interest rates and payment schedules.

7

Anderson Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. J. Defendants did not produce documents in response to Document

8

Request No. 1 (seeking documents sufficient to identify each subsequent purchaser or assignee of

9

the loans sold to Plaintiff and Class Members) and Document Request No. 5 (seeking all reports that

10

summarize MIG’s subsequent sale or assignment of the subject loans). Id. Defendants also refused

11

to supplement their responses to Interrogatory No. 4 (requesting the identity the subsequent

12

purchaser for each subject loan). Anderson Decl., Ex. E.

13

On December 17, 2009, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File Second Amended

14

Compliant, seeking leave to add subsequent purchasers of or investors on Plaintiff Ralston’s loan.

15

(Docket No. 42)

16

On December 30, 2008, Plaintiff again requested that Defendants provide comments to or

17

approve the [Proposed] Stipulated Protective Order. On January 7, 2009, Plaintiff provided

18

Defendants with another copy of the proposed order. Anderson Decl., Ex. G.

19

On January 8, 2009, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendants regarding several deficiencies and

20

improper redactions in the documents produced. Specifically, Plaintiff stated that Defendants’

21

responses to Document Requests Nos. 1 and 3 were deficient in that Defendants failed to produce

22

responsive sample loan files. Plaintiff pointed out that Defendants admittedly sold the loans to Class

23

Members, regardless of which entity subsequently purchased them, rendering them directly relevant.

24

Moreover, Plaintiff noted that Defendants have acknowledged that the subsequent purchasers

25

dictated the terms and form of the loans in question, rending their identity and information regarding

26

which loans are attributable to them relevant and likely to lead to the discovery of admissible

27

evidence. Additionally, Plaintiff challenged the improper redactions plaguing Defendants’

28

Responses to Requests Nos. 3 and 4, explaining the plain relevance of the redacted information to

1

Plaintiff’s claims and, again, requesting that Defendants agree to, or provide feedback on, the

2

proposed Stipulated Protective Order. In a subsequent telephone conversation, Defendants stated

3

that they were under no obligation to enter into a stipulated protective order and again refused to

4

meet and confer regarding Plaintiff’s proposed order. Anderson Decl., ¶12.

5

On January 16, 2009, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set Two, in which Plaintiff

6

sought, among other information, the identity of the nonparty investors or subsequent purchasers

7

associated with each loan version Defendants produced in response to Plaintiff’s discovery.

8

Defendants responded on February 18, 2009, but refused to provide information regarding the source

9

of each loan version, on the ground that “neither plaintiff nor the putative class has a viable legal

10

claim against assignees…and it prematurely seeks information regarding putative class members and

11

others in advance of class certification.” Anderson Decl., Ex. H.

12

On February 23, 2009, counsel for Plaintiff took the deposition of Christine Rhea, President

13

of Mortgage Investors Group, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6). Among the topics identified in the

14

deposition notice was the source of the different loan versions Defendants used during the liability

15

period, copies of which Defendants had produced in response to Plaintiff’s Requests. Anderson

16

Decl., Ex. I. Ms. Rhea was unable or unwilling to testify to many of the topics listed in the

17

deposition notice. Id. Further, counsel for Defendants improperly instructed the witness not to

18

answer questions regarding the source of the loan documents to the degree such questions called for

19

disclosure of any subsequent purchaser or investor on Class Members’ loans. Counsel was unable to

20

identify any legitimate foundation for instructing the witness not to answer. Id., Ex. A.

21

On March 16, 2009, Judge Jeremy Fogel entered an Order (1) Granting In Part And Denying

22

In Part Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss With Leave To Amend; And (2) Granting Plaintiff’s Motion

23

For Leave To Amend. (Docket No. 66.)

IV.

15

ARGUMENT
Through the use of narrowly tailored requests, Plaintiff properly seeks documents sufficient

16

to identify subsequent purchasers or assignees of the subject ARM loans and certain loan-level

17

information including interest rates and payment schedules from sample loan files. Plaintiff is

18

entitled to “discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to the subject matter of the

19

litigation— including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any

20

documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons who know of any

21

discoverable matter.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). The discovery sought is directly relevant, indeed core,

22

to the subject matter of this litigation and should be produced.

23

A.

Information Regarding Liable Subsequent Purchasers Who Dictated The Terms
Of The Loans Is Relevant.

24
Defendants incorrectly contend that Plaintiff is not entitled to discover the identities of the
25
subsequent purchasers with whom MIG collaborated because no class has yet been certified.
26
Anderson Decl., ¶12. Defendants’ argument misapprehends discovery under the Federal Rules,
27
however, and seeks to impose an unduly narrow interpretation of the allegations.

Filed03/18/09 Page7 of 13

As at least one other court has recognized, Plaintiff is entitled to discovery regarding the

2

identities of subsequent purchasers and/or assignees of the loans prior to class certification because

3

the information is both necessary to the development of Plaintiff’s claims and likely to lead to the

4

discovery of admissible evidence. See Pence v. Union Fidelity Mortg., Inc. 2008 WL 5102242 at *2

5

No. 08-CV-0089-WQH (JMA) (S.D.Cal., Dec. 2, 2008) (granting plaintiff’s application to subpoena

6

non-party Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc. (“MERS”) for information regarding the

7

subsequent purchasers of plaintiff’s and putative class members’ loans). “Plaintiff and the putative

8

class will not be able to move forward with this case on a class basis unless they are permitted to

9

ascertain the identities of other persons or entities which may have potential liability for Plaintiff’s

10

individual and class claims.” Id. Plaintiff is further entitled to such discovery because the

11

subsequent purchasers of the loans are likely to have information concerning the creation and

12

location of documents that are relevant to the claims. Id.
As in Pence, the identity of subsequent purchasers of Class Members’ loans is relevant, not

13
14

only because such entities are liable to borrowers for TILA violations,3 but also because the

15

subsequent purchasers controlled the form and content of the loans MIG sold to borrowers with

16

understanding that the loan would later be sold to the subsequent purchaser. Defendants also admit

17

that they provided borrowers with whatever documents the subsequent purchaser required, with little

18

or no thought as to whether such documents complied with the law. Id., Ex. A. The various loan

19

versions produced demonstrate that the subsequent purchasers used similar language and the same

20

document preparation services to create the loan documents provided to MIG, who then sold the

21

loans to unsuspecting borrowers. Id., Exs. A, K.

22

Thus, subsequent purchasers, each of them, directly influenced Defendants’ unfair and illegal

23

business practices as they relate to the transactions at issue in this litigation. Indeed, the subsequent

24

purchasers and assignees are identified in the FAC as co-conspirators and potentially liable parties.

25

FAC, ¶8. Additionally, because the subsequent purchasers are in possession of information and

documents regarding the specific business practices which are the subject of this litigation, their

2

identities are also very likely to lead to the discovery of relevant and admissible evidence regarding

3

Plaintiff’s claims. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). It is difficult to imagine more relevant area for discovery.

4

Indeed, Defendants themselves have acknowledged the plain relevancy of the loan versions

5

by producing a complete copy of each version of the loan documents used during the defined

6

liability period. Anderson Decl., ¶10. Plaintiff is entitled to know the source of these admittedly

7

relevant documents.

8

Disclosing Information Relating to Approximately Six Subsequent
Purchasers Is Not Unduly Burdensome.

9
Discovery under the Federal Rules is broad, and the staged discovery Defendants suggest
10
would only be appropriate upon a showing of undue burden that clearly outweighs the probative
11
value of the evidence sought. Here, while entitled to seek much broader discovery, Plaintiff has
12
served a set of narrowly-crafted requests and interrogatories seeking information necessary to prevail
13
at class certification and identify all liable parties and coconspirators. Anderson Decl., Exs. B-C.
14
15
16
17
18
19

Specifically, in Document Request No. 1, Plaintiff seeks only documents “sufficient to identify” the
subsequent purchasers of the loans. Id. Ex., B. In Document Request No. 3, Plaintiff requested only
five sample loan files for each subsequent purchaser. Anderson Decl. Ex. B. Moreover, Defendants
admit that there are only five, or at the most, six subsequent purchasers with whom they conspired,
and that that information is readily available. Id., Ex. A. As far as Plaintiff’s Interrogatories are
concerned, Plaintiff seeks basic loan-level information associated with the loan. Id., Ex. C, E.

20
Defendants concede that they are able to easily run reports in their database to collect this data, along
21
22
23

with information relating to the specific loan type. Id., Ex. A.
Thus, Defendants have not articulated or otherwise shown any undue burden other than
simply stating that the information is premature and not relevant at this “stage of the litigation.” 4

24
25

4

In support of their efforts to resist producing this plainly relevant material, Defendants will
likely point to an order in Jordan v. Paul Financial LLC, CV07-04496-SI (N.D.Cal), where the court
denied discovery because plaintiff did not demonstrate why the information sought was relevant to
class certification. Id., Order Re Discovery (N.D.Cal., June 2, 2008) (Docket No. 58). That case is
readily distinguishable for a number of reasons, however. First, the parties in Jordan agreed to limit

Anderson Decl., ¶ 12. Because Defendants readily admit that disclosing which subsequent

2

purchasers are the sources of the various loan versions is not unduly burdensome, Plaintiff’s motion

3

should be granted.

4

B.

The Sample Loans and Loan-Level Information Requested Are Relevant and
Necessary To The Plaintiff’s Allegations.

5
With the exception of loan documents specifically related to the named Plaintiff, virtually all
6
of the documents produced by Defendant are replete with improper redactions. Defendant has
7
redacted not only borrowers’ personal information, but also information directly relevant and
8
necessary to Plaintiff’s claims, including, but not limited to, all interest rates and the payment
9

schedules provided to Class Members in the TILDS. See e.g., Anderson Decl., Ex. G.

10
The redacted information is relevant to the claims asserted in this case and will also
11
substantiate Plaintiff’s class allegations that Class Members were all subjected to the same
12
deceptive, incomplete and misleading information in their loan documents. Equally justified is
13
Plaintiff’s request for a sampling of loan files for each subsequent purchaser, as Plaintiff seeks to
14
demonstrate that the documents, teaser rates and payment schedules were commonly deceptive and
15
16
17
18
19

unlawful, regardless of what investor may have subsequently purchased the loans. 5

Privacy Concerns Are Adequately Addressed By The Proposed
Stipulated Protective Order.

initial discovery to issues directly relevant to class certification in their joint Rule 26(f) report, thus
limiting the court’s inquiry as to whether discovery regarding subsequent purchasers of the
plaintiff’s loans bore directly on class certification. Id. Here, the parties have not agreed to
bifurcated discovery, nor has it been ordered by this Court. Second, Plaintiff in this case has
demonstrated that the subsequent purchasers were directly involved in crafting the loan terms passed
on to Class Members. Anderson Decl. Ex. A, ¶ 12. Third, Plaintiff has demonstrated why the
sample loans sold to each subsequent purchaser are relevant to class certification here—because
sample loan files contain the interest rates and TILDS payment schedules that will demonstrate that
all of the loans were essentially the same, regardless of the subsequent purchaser.
5
While Defendants have produced the blank copies of the loan document versions used by
different investors who subsequently purchased the loans, only the sample loan files contain the
TILDS and information regarding the interest rate and payment schedules provided. Anderson

(Oct. 24, 2008, C.D.Cal.) (citing Pioneer Elecs., Inc. v. Superior Court, 40 Cal.4th 360

2

(2007))(emphasis in original). However, the right to privacy is not absolute, and if the need for the

3

information outweighs the risk of harm, the information must be produced. See, e.g., Oakes., 179

4

F.R.D. at 284. “[T]he court must balance the asserted right to privacy against the relevance and

5

necessity of the information sought by the plaintiff.” Tomassi, 2008 WL 4722393, at *3 (citing

6

Johnson v. Thompson, 971 F.2d 1487, 1497 (10th Cir.1992); Ragge v. MCA/Universal, 165 F.R.D.

7

601, 604-05 (C.D.Cal.1995)).

8
9

Thus, Courts first apply a three-part test to determine whether there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy and whether the invasion is serious. First, there must be a “legally protected

10

privacy interest.” See, e.g., Puerto v. Superior Court, 158 Cal.App. 4th 1242, 1251-1251 (2008)

11

(citations omitted). Second, there must be a reasonable expectation of privacy under the particular

12

circumstances. Id. Third, the invasion of privacy must be serious in nature, scope, and actual or

13

potential impact. Id. Only then will the court “balance the privacy interest at stake against other

14

competing or countervailing interests, which include the interest of the requesting party, fairness to

15

the litigants in conducting the litigation, and the consequences of granting or restricting access to the

16

information.” Id.

17

Plaintiff acknowledges that Class Members’ financial information is entitled to protection.

18

As Plaintiff has explained, the redacted data includes interest rates and payment schedules necessary

19

to establish that the loans were all similarly deceptive and automatically led to negative

20

amortization. Interest rates and payment schedules on their own do not constituted private

21

information. Moreover, documents containing private information should be produced pursuant to

22

the [Proposed] Stipulated Protective Order, which, among other things, explicitly protects and limits

23

the use of “Private Consumer Information” to address applicable state and federal law. Anderson

In short, MIG has not made any showing as to why the requested discovery should not be

Plaintiff is the appropriate means to address any privacy concerns. See e.g., Tomassi, 2008 WL
