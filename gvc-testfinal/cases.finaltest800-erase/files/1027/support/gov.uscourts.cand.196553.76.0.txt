NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Lead Plaintiff Shahpour Javidzad hereby moves for an

3

order permitting him to serve the Defendants not yet served in this case (“the Unserved

4

Defendants”) through Defendant LDK’s office located in this District, as permitted by Rule

5

4(f)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Motion is scheduled to be heard at 8:00 a.m.

on June 19, 2008, in the courtroom of the Honorable William H. Alsup, in the United States

STATEMENT OF ISSUE TO BE DECIDED
Whether Plaintiff’s motion should be granted.

11
12

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
This case is brought against LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (“LDK” or “the Company”), a Chinese

13

Company that last year chose to list itself on the New York Stock exchange in order to access the

14

U.S. capital markets. In doing so the Company and its officers and directors voluntarily subjected

15

themselves to the provisions of the U.S. securities laws. Nevertheless, five individual defendants

16

(“the Unserved Individual Defendants”), each of whom personally signed the Company’s initial

17

public offering registration statement, and each of whom undoubtedly has actual knowledge of

18

this litigation, have refused to allow counsel for the Company to accept service on their behalf, as

19

has a Chinese subsidiary of LDK. Ignoring the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure’s mandate that

20

they attempt in good faith to minimize the cost of service, the Unserved Individual Defendants,

21

who are residents of China, apparently want to avoid service entirely or, at the least, to make

22

service unreasonably difficult and expensive. At a minimum, the Unserved Individual

23

Defendants’ tactics will complicate and may delay these proceedings—any Defendants served

24

after the Court rules on the pending motion to dismiss are likely to argue that they are not bound

25

by the Court’s ruling since the Court did not have jurisdiction over them when it made its

26

decision.

27

When a court is faced with such a situation, the Federal Rules allow it to approve

28

reasonable alternatives to the costly, time consuming and possibly fruitless procedure of

attempting service outside the country through the cumbersome procedures of the Hague

2

Convention on Service Abroad. Consequently, to expedite this litigation, and to reduce the costs

3

associated with it, Plaintiff respectfully moves the Court to permit that the Unserved Defendants

4

be served through LDK’s California office on the reasonable premise that that office will transmit

5

the relevant documents to the Unserved Defendants, each of which is a director, senior officer or

6

subsidiary of LDK. A similar procedure for service has been specifically approved by the Ninth

7

Circuit.

8

BACKGROUND

9

This is a consolidated class action brought under the federal securities laws against LDK,

10

a Cayman Islands-incorporated Chinese company traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and

11

certain of its officers, directors and subsidiaries. Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Class Action

12

Complaint on March 10, 2008 and Defendants responded on April 7, 2008 with a motion to

13

dismiss. A hearing on that motion is set for May 15, 2008. Each of the individual Defendants

14

made statements specifically directed at American investors about LDK, including by signing

15

LDK’s proxy statement, that the Complaint alleges were materially false and misleading.

16

There are ten Defendants in this case, four of whom have been served—LDK itself; LDK

17

Solar USA, Inc., a subsidiary of LDK; Xiaofeng Peng, LDK’s Chief Executive Officer; and Jack

18

Lai, LDK’s Chief Financial Officer. Six Defendants also named in the Complaint have not been

19

served—Jiangxi LDK Solar, a Chinese subsidiary of LDK; Xingxue Tong, LDK’s President and

20

Chief Operating Officer; Qiqiang Yao, LDK’s Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer;

21

Liangbao Zhu, LDK’s Executive Vice President and a member of the Company’s board of

22

directors; Yonggang Shao, LDK’s Senior Vice President and a member of the Company’s board;

23

and Gang Wang, also a member of the Company’s board.

24

Counsel for LDK (who initially claimed to represent none of LDK’s officers, but who

25

subsequently indicated that they represented Defendants Peng and Lai after these two Defendants

26

had been served) have been unwilling to accept service for any of the Unserved Defendants or

27

even to clarify which, if any of the Unserved Defendants they represent. See Declaration of

28

Matthew B. Kaplan, ¶ 2, attached. Despite counsel’s apparent position that they do not represent

the Unserved Defendants, and therefore cannot accept service for them, counsel has argued to the

2

Court on their behalf, claiming that the Complaint supposedly does not adequately tie the

3

Unserved Individual Defendants to the fraud and should, therefore, be dismissed against them.

See, e.g., Defendants’ Reply Memorandum Of Points And Authorities In Support Of Motion To

fact regarding any statements, acts or the state of mind of five of the seven Defendants: Xingxue

7

Tong, Qiqiang Yao, Liangbao Zhu, Yonggang Shao and Gang Wang.”) (emphasis in original).

8
9

Each of the Unserved Individual Defendants works at LDK’s headquarters in China and
resides in China. Service of process in China is theoretically possible pursuant to the Hague

10

Convention but, is extraordinarily burdensome and time consuming. See Cincinnati Ins. Co. v.

11

Belkin Corp., No. 07-0615, 2008 WL 60402, at *1 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 2, 2008) (according to

12

affidavit, “service of process on Dongguan in China pursuant to the Hague Convention will take

13

between four and six months”). Moreover, in this case counsel for LDK has suggested that it may

14

not be possible to ever serve the Unserved Individual Defendants pursuant to the Hague

15

Convention. See Kaplan Decl. ¶ 3.

16

According to LDK’s web site, “LDK’s headquarters [is]…located in Hi-Tech Industrial

17

Park, Xinyu City, Jiangxi province in the People's Republic of China” and “[t]he company’s USA

18

office is located in Sunnyvale, California.” http://investor.ldksolar.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=

ARGUMENT
Service of process outside the United States is governed by Federal Rule of Civil

23

Procedure 4(f), which provides that such service may be made by means that include international

24

agreements such as the Hague Convention or, under subsection 4(f)(3), “by other means not

25

prohibited by international agreement, as the court orders.” According to the Ninth Circuit,

26

28
C OHEN , M ILSTEIN ,
H AUSFELD & T OLL
P.L.L.C.

“[a]s obvious from its plain language, service under Rule 4(f)(3)
must be (1) directed by the court; and (2) not prohibited by
international agreement. No other limitations are evident from the
text. In fact, as long as court-directed and not prohibited by an
international agreement, service of process ordered under Rule

4(f)(3) may be accomplished in contravention of the laws of the
foreign country.
Rio Properties, Inc. v. Rio Intern. Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1014 (9th Cir. 2002).
Rio Properties rejected a defendant’s argument that plaintiffs must use the other methods
of overseas service authorized by Rule 4(f), such as the Hague Convention, before asking a court
to authorize service by “other means.” The court explained that

6
7

We find no support for [the defendant’s] position. No such
requirement is found in the Rule’s text, implied by its structure, or
even hinted at in the advisory committee notes.

By all indications, court-directed service under Rule 4(f)(3)
is as favored as service available under Rule 4(f)(1) or Rule 4(f)(2).
Indeed, Rule 4(f)(3) is one of three separately numbered
subsections in Rule 4(f), and each subsection is separated from the
one previous merely by the simple conjunction “or.” Rule 4(f)(3) is
not subsumed within or in any way dominated by Rule 4(f)’s other
subsections; it stands independently, on equal footing. Moreover,
no language in Rules 4(f)(1) or 4(f)(2) indicates their primacy, and
certainly Rule 4(f)(3) includes no qualifiers or limitations which
indicate its availability only after attempting service of process by
other means.
Id. at 1015 (footnote and citations omitted); see also Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. v. Wikileaks,
No. C 08-00824 JSW2008 WL 413737, at *2 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 13, 2008) (“a plaintiff is not first
required to attempt service under Rule 4(f)(1) or Rule 4(f)(2)” before seeking court approval to
serve under rule 4(f)(3)).
Relying on Rio Properties, the district court in Nanya Technology Corp. v. Fujitsu Ltd.,
No. CIV 06-00025, 2007 WL 269087 (D. Guam Jan. 25, 2007), rejected the defendant’s
argument that a court can only authorize Rule 4(f)(3) service “where the recipient party does not
live in a member country of the Hague Convention” or in “urgent circumstances.” Id. at *5.
Emphasizing that “[w]e should not lose sight of what service of process is about, it is about
giving a party notice of the pendency of an action and the opportunity to respond,” the Court
upheld a magistrate judge’s authorization of service by alternate means under Rule 4(f)(3)
because “service was sufficient enough to give [defendant] Fujitsu notice and an opportunity to
respond.” Id. at *5; see also Seiko Epson Corp. v. Glory South Software Manufacturing, Inc., No.
06-CV-477, 2007 WL 219944, at *2 (D. Or. Jan. 24, 2007) (noting that the federal rule “stresses

actual notice, rather than strict formalism”).
Service of the Unserved Defendants through LDK is appropriate in this case. Since LDK

3

and two of its top officers are actively participating in this lawsuit there can be no reasonable

4

doubt that the Unserved Individual Defendants—each an officer or director of LDK—are aware

5

of it, especially since it is discussed in some detail in the Company’s recently filed Form F-20

6

annual report, a document that any competent officer or director would be familiar with. See

7

Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 69, Ex. S at 20, 49-50. Nevertheless, although

8

a defendant, including a defendant outside the United States, “has a duty to avoid unnecessary

9

expenses of serving the summons,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1), the Unserved Defendants have not

10
11

authorized counsel for LDK to accept service on their behalf.
The Unserved Individual Defendants’ attempt to evade service is especially troublesome

12

because the statements alleged to be false include statements in LDK’s initial public offering

13

registration statement, a document each Unserved Individual Defendant signed. Congress

14

imposed especially “heav[y] legal liability” on “persons signing [a] registration statement”

15

because such persons have a “moral responsibility to the public [that] is particularly heavy.”

16

Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., 513 U.S. 561, 581 (1995) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong.,

17

1st Sess., 5 (1933)). Signatories of registration statements who happen to reside outside the

18

United States have the same “moral responsibility to the public” and should not be allowed to use

19

their location to diminish or evade liability. Since each of the Unserved Individual Defendants

20

voluntarily signed a registration statement on behalf LDK, allowing the Company to sell shares in

21

the United States, it would be fair and reasonable for the Court to allow them to be served through

22

LDK’s U.S. office.

23

Any “method of service crafted by the district court [pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3)] must be

24

‘reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency

25

of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’” Rio Properties at 1016-

26

17 (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)). In Rio

27

Properties the court held that the district court had met this standard when it authorized service

28

on a Costa Rican defendant’s “international courier” in Miami even though that courier

apparently made delivery to the defendant’s “Costa Rican courier” rather than to the defendant

2

itself. Rio Properties at 1013.

3

The facts in this case present a better case for service pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3) than the

4

facts the court found sufficient in Rio Properties. Plaintiff here does not propose to serve a

5

courier working (possibly indirectly) for the Unserved Defendants, but to directly serve the

6

Unserved Defendants’ employer (or owner in the case of LDK’s Chinese subsidiary). It is

7

reasonable to assume that important documents hand delivered to LDK’s offices and addressed to

8

specific officers and directors of the Company will actually be transmitted to those officers and

9

directors. This is especially so since, if service is made on LDK’s U.S. office, LDK will

10

undoubtedly advise the Court if for some reason it is no longer able to contact any of the

11

Unserved Defendants.

12

Courts have also frequently permitted service by email pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3). See, e.g.

13

Bank Julius Baer at *2 (approving email service); Philip Morris USA Inc. v. Veles Ltd., No. 06

14

CV 2988, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19780 at *4-*9 & n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2007) (same, citing

15

cases). The method of service proposed by Plaintiff here is more likely to actually reach the

16

Unserved Defendants than is service through sometimes unreliable email. See Hall Tim,

17

“Mystery of lost messages as millions of emails fall into black hole,” Daily Telegraph (London)

18

May 31, 2007, at 12 (available on Westlaw at 2007 WLNR 10146682) (“Millions of emails have

19

been falling into a ‘black hole’ without any warning that they have disappeared, a major internet

20

provider admitted yesterday.”).

For the reasons set forth above Plaintiff’s motion should be granted.
