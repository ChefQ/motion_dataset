North Carolina Department of State Treasurer,
Defendant

Case No: 5:17-CV-00114-BO
RESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS AND
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Comes Now Rosita Sabrosso- Rennick, and responds to the
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and also Request leave to file an First
Amended Complaint (Proposed Complaint Attached) and asking the

court I say:
1. The Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss alleging that it has not

been served properly and that Plaintiff does not state a claim under
NCGS lA-1.
2. Plaintiff has amended her complaint to remove this claim, which
makes the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss moot.
3. The Defendant further argues that the Court should dismiss the
Complaint because Plaintiff served the incorrect party. Plaintiff admits,

Case 5:17-cv-00114-BO Document 18 Filed 06/30/17 Page 1 of 3

based on research, that the Defendant is accurate in their statement. To
remedy that issue,· Plaintiff filed a Motion for the Clerk to Reissue
. Summonses to the correct Defendant. The Motion is pending before the
Court and has not been ruled on.
4. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) states, in part, that ''leave [to amend] shall be
freely given when justice so requires." Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon

Inc. v. Alpha of Virgi.m"a., Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 940 (4th Cir. 1995). The
United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has consistently
applied this standard when justice so required. Id. at 941.
5. In the case at bar, there is a complete absence of undue delay, bad
faith or dilatory motive, undue prejudice, futility, or other compelling
reason to deny the proposed amendments. Allowing the amendments
will more clearly delineate Plaintiffs allegations. The clarification of
these issues should ultimately prove helpful to Defendant and this
Court. The proposed amendment is timely filed. This Motion should be
allowed since no ,compelling reason exists to deny the request.

6. Plaintiff will suffer severe prejudice if the Court would be inclined
the relief sought.
