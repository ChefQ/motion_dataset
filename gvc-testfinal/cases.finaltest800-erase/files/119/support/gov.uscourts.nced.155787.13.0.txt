MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO DISMISS
(Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), (4), (5), (6))

NOW COMES Defendant North Carolina Department of State Treasurer, by and through
the undersigned counsel, and hereby submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion to
dismiss the complaint and to deny Plaintiff’s request for entry of default, pursuant to Rules 12(b)
(2), (4), (5) and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Plaintiff initiated this action by filing an Application to Proceed in forma pauperis on 2
March 2017, along with an attached complaint and proposed summons. (DE-1, 1-1, 1-3). The
application was granted by order of 23 March 2017 and the summons and complaint were filed
24 March 2017. (DE-4, 5, 6) The summons was issued to the “North Carolina Dept. of State
Treasurer” (DE-6) and the complaint names as Defendant “North Carolina State Treasurer c/o
North Carolina Local Government Commission.” (DE-5) The Process Receipt and Return (US
Marshall form 285) names “North Carolina Department of State Treasurer” as the entity to serve
(DE-6-1), and the ‘green card’ shows that it was addressed to “North Carolina Dept. of State
Treasurer.” (DE-9)

2

On 22 May 2017, Defendant received via regular U.S. Mail Plaintiff’s “Request for an
Order of Default.” (DE-10)
Plaintiff’s complaint sets out two claims: (1) “Retaliation in Violation of The Title
Seven” and (2) “Retaliation in Violation of N.C.G.S. § 1A-1” which Plaintiff identifies as the
“Retaliation Employment Discrimination Act.” (DE-5, pp 1, 6) She alleges that on 2 December
2016, she received a right to sue letter from the EEOC. (DE-5, p 1) Plaintiff generally alleges
that she was hired by the Department of State Treasurer (“DST”) in June 2014, and from July
2015 until her eventual termination in February 2016, she was subjected to a series of
disciplinary actions, allegedly based on her poor work performance. Plaintiff contends that these
actions were in retaliation for her having complained to “HR” that her supervisor had spoken to
her in what she perceived to be a condescending manner, based upon her race. (DE-5, pp 1-6)
I.

PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO BRING DEFENDANT WITHIN THIS COURT’S
JURISDICTION, BECAUSE PROCESS AND ATTEMPTED SERVICE ON
DEFENDANT IS INSUFFICIENT.
Plaintiff’s complaint must be dismissed for insufficient process and service of process,

and consequent lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), 12(b)(4) and
12(b)(5). Plaintiff named an incorrect entity in the summons, such that a proper summons did
not issue, and as a result of the incorrect information, the summons and complaint were not
served on Defendant DST as provided by law, resulting in both insufficient process and service
of process under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(4) and (b)(5). Accordingly, this Court lacks personal
jurisdiction over DST under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). Miller v. Ingles, No. 1:09-CV-200, 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132035, at *9 (W.D.N.C. Oct. 30, 2009) (“Where the procedural requirements
of sufficient process and service of process are not satisfied, a court lacks power to assert
personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”) (internal citation and quotes omitted).

3

Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(2) provides that a state or local government:
must be served by . . .
(A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to its chief executive
officer; or
(B) serving a copy of each in the manner prescribed by that state’s law for
serving a summons or like process on such a defendant.
Id. (emphasis added). The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure establish the manner of
service of process with respect to an agency of the state:
. . . by personally delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the
process agent appointed by the agency in the manner hereinafter provided; by
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint, registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, addressed to said process agent.
N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(4)a (emphasis added). All state agencies are required by N.C. R. Civ. P.
4(j)(4)b to appoint a process agent by filing with the Attorney General the name and address of
the agent upon whom process may be served. “It is well-settled that process must be issued and
served in the matter prescribed by statute, and failure to do so makes the service invalid, even
though a defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit.” Ryals v. Hall-Lane Moving and Storage
Co., 122 N.C. App. 242, 247, 468 S.E.2d 600, 604, disc. rev. denied, 343 N.C. 514, 472 S.E.2d
19 (1996) (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). Without valid service, a court does not
have the requisite personal jurisdiction over the person or agency as required by law. Id.
Here, the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer is an agency of the State.
N.C.G.S. § 143A-30. As required by Rule 4, DST has appointed Sam Hayes, its General
Counsel, along with two paralegals in the Department, Shannon Conley and Angela Cooper, as
process

agents

for

service.

See,

General

However, Plaintiff’s Summons and Complaint were clearly not directed to any of the registered

4

agents, as required by Rule 4. (DE-6) Therefore, this Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint
for insufficient service of process pursuant to Rules 4(j)(2) and 12(b)(4) and (5).
“Although the technical requirements of service of process should be construed liberally
so long as the defendant has actual notice of the lawsuit, the mere fact of actual notice does not
excuse plain noncompliance with process requirements.”

Wilkerson v. Christian, No.

1:06CV00871, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12744, at *4-7 (M.D.N.C. Feb. 19, 2008) (internal
citation and quotes omitted); see also Koehler v. Dodwell, 152 F.3d 304, 306 (4th Cir. 1998)
(citing Armco Inc. v. Penrod-Stauffer Bldg. Sys., Inc., 733 F.2d 1087, 1089 (4th Cir. 1984)
(stating that “[s]ince there was no valid service of process, the district court was without
jurisdiction of the defendant”)); McDaniel v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., No. 3:08-CV-130, 2008
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58299, at *15 (W.D.N.C. July 7, 2008) (“When service of process is
insufficient, a court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant.”), appeal dismissed, 305 Fed.
Appx. 80 (4th Cir. 2008).
Because Plaintiff has failed to properly serve the Defendant by ensuring that her
summons and complaint were properly addressed to one of Defendant’s registered agents for
service of process, she cannot now claim that she is entitled to an order of default based upon
Defendant’s failure to respond.
II.

PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT IS SUBJECT TO DISMISSAL PURSUANT TO
RULE 12(b)(6).
Absent direct evidence, the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination under Title

VII are: (1) membership in a protected class; (2) satisfactory job performance; (3) adverse
employment action; and (4) different treatment from similarly situated employees outside the
protected class. See White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir. 2004). The
elements of a prima facie retaliation claim under Title VII are: (1) engagement in a protected

5

activity; (2) adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and
the employment action. See Mackey v. Shalala, 360 F.3d 463, 469 (4th Cir. 2004).
In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the factual allegations as
contained in the complaint are to be taken as true. Republican Party of North Carolina v.
Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992), cert denied, 510 U.S. 828 (1993). Though the court
must view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court “need not accept the
legal conclusions drawn from the facts [or] unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or
arguments.” Eastern Shore Mkts., Inc., v. J.D. Assocs. Ltd. P’ships, 213 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir.
2000); see also Labram v. Havel, 43 F.3d 918, 921 (4th Cir. 1995) (stating that the court is not
required to accept “conclusory allegations regarding the legal effect of the facts alleged.”)
Plaintiff’s own complaint negates the element that she was performing her job
satisfactorily, as it shows management’s repeated efforts to try to improve her performance
through face-to-face meetings, followed by progressive disciplinary action for poor performance,
including written warnings, and ultimately dismissal. Plaintiff fails to show that she was treated
differently from similarly situated employees outside the protected class, or that there was a
causal link between her alleged protected activity and her termination.
Finally, Plaintiff’s alleged violation of “N.C.G.S. § 1A-1” and/or the “Retaliation
Employment Discrimination Act” (DE-5, p 6) fails to state a cognizable claim. N.C.G.S. § 1A-1
sets forth the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. While it is not clear exactly what statute
Plaintiff is referencing, North Carolina does have a Retaliatory Employment Discrimination Act
(“REDA”), which generally authorizes the North Carolina Commissioner of Labor to investigate
certain labor violations, and prohibits retaliation against workers who make complaints under the
Act. N.C.G.S. § 95-240 et seq. Plaintiff has not alleged a workplace violation of the sort

6

encompassed by the REDA, such as wage and hour or workplace safety violations, nor has she
alleged that she exhausted her administrative remedies under that Act. See N.C.G.S. § 95-242
(requiring employee to file complaint within 180 days of alleged violation and obtain right to sue
letter from Commissioner of Labor).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Defendant respectfully request that Plaintiff’s request for
entry of default be denied, and that her complaint be dismissed with prejudice.
Respectfully submitted this 24rd day of May, 2017.
