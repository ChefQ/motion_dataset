ORDER
In a Memorandum-Decision and Order dated July 24, 2014, the Court granted Plaintiffs'
motion for summary judgment and denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment. See Dkt.
No. 51. The Court entered judgment in accordance with that Memorandum-Decision and Order
on July 29, 2014. See Dkt. No. 54. Defendants filed a motion to stay the Court's decision
pending an appeal, see Dkt. No. 52, which this Court granted to the extent that the Court's Order
was stayed nunc pro tunc for ninety days until October 22, 2014, see Dkt. No. 53. The Court

also instructed Plaintiffs to file their papers in opposition to Defendants' motion to stay pending
appeal by August 4, 2014, and advised Defendants that they could file a reply in further support
of their motion by August 4, 2014. See id. In addition, on August 12, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a
motion for attorney's fees, see Dkt. No. 59; and, on August 25, 2014, Defendants filed a motion
for reconsideration of the Court's Order granting Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, see
Dkt. No. 63.
Having reviewed the parties' submissions in support of and in opposition to Defendants'
motion for a stay pending an appeal, the Court hereby
ORDERS that Defendants' motion is DENIED; however, the Court will entertain a
motion to extend the stay beyond October 22, 2014. If Defendants wish to make such a motion,
they must file papers in support of that motion on or before October 3, 2014, setting forth in
detail what, if any, progress they have made to comply with the Court's decision. Plaintiffs may
file any opposition that they have to Defendants' motion on or before October 10, 2014. If
Defendants file such a motion, the Court will hear oral argument in support of, and in opposition
to, said motion on October 17, 2014, at 10:30 a.m.; and the Court further
ORDERS that the Court will hear oral argument in support of, and in opposition to,
Defendants' motion for reconsideration on October 17, 2014, at 10:30 a.m.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
