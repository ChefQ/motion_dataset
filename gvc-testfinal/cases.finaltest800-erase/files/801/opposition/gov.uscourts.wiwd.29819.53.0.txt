UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
AFFYMETRIX, INC. and
GREGORY L. KIRK,
Plaintiffs,
Case No. 3:11-cv-00184-bbc

vs.
ILLUMINA, INC.,
Defendant.

ILLUMINA’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO
REOPEN AND OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’
RENEWED MOTION FOR A HEARING ON INVENTORSHIP
Illumina responds to Plaintiffs’ motion to reopen (Dkt. #48) and opposes Plaintiffs’
renewed motion for a hearing on inventorship (Dkt. #49) as follows:
1.

Illumina does not oppose Plaintiffs’ motion to reopen this action.

2.

Upon reopening this action, Illumina respectfully requests that the Court dismiss

this action because Plaintiffs’ claims are barred (i) under the doctrine of res judicata; and
(ii) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a) because they were compulsory
counterclaims in the prior litigation. (See Illumina opening and reply briefs in support of its
motion to dismiss (Dkt. #19 & 33).) Affymetrix’s claims should be dismissed because it was a
party to the prior action. (Id.) Gregory Kirk’s claims should be dismissed because he was in
privity with Affymetrix in the previous action. (Id.)
3.

The fact that this Court and the Federal Circuit only decided the issue of

infringement on the merits (and not inventorship) does not save Plaintiffs’ claims in this case
from dismissal. Res judicata “‘bars not only those issues which were actually decided in a prior

Case: 3:11-cv-00184-bbc Document #: 53 Filed: 10/11/11 Page 2 of 4

suit, but also all other issues which could have been raised in that action.’” Cole v. Bd. of Trs.,
497 F.3d 770, 772 (7th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). In other words, res judicata applies even if
the prior claim was not actually litigated. Shaver v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 840 F.2d 1361, 1364
(7th Cir. 1988) (“In contrast to collateral estoppel, which bars issues actually litigated and
decided in a previous lawsuit, the doctrine of ‘res judicata bars not only those issues which were
actually decided in the prior action but also any issues which could have been raised.’”)
(citations omitted). The same is true of Rule 13(a): “COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM.
(1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that—at the time of its
service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction
or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim; and (B) does not require
adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.” Fed. R Civ. P. 13(a).
4.

In the event the Court determines that Affymetrix’s claims should be dismissed

but is uncertain as to whether Kirk was in privity with Affymetrix in the prior litigation, Illumina
respectfully requests limited discovery and additional briefing on this issue before this action
proceeds on the merits.
5.

In the event the Court denies Illumina’s motion to dismiss, Illumina disagrees that

inventorship is ripe for resolution. As set forth in Illumina’s previous brief in opposition to
Plaintiffs’ motion to set a hearing on inventorship, additional discovery is necessary and
warranted before this action is ready for resolution. (See Illumina Br. at 2-4 (Dkt. #23).) In
particular, Illumina should be allowed additional discovery on the issue of laches. (Id.) Laches
is a defense to a claim for correction of inventorship and is a viable defense in this action. (Id.)
Laches was not at issue in the prior litigation, which is why Illumina did not seek extensive
discovery on this issue then. (Id.)

Case: 3:11-cv-00184-bbc Document #: 53 Filed: 10/11/11 Page 3 of 4

6.

In addition to laches, Illumina should be allowed to seek discovery from Plaintiffs

regarding any agreements and arrangements between them that were not discovered during the
prior litigation. The agreement between Affymetrix and Kirk that was discovered during the
prior litigation did not seem to contemplate a standalone action for correction of inventorship
brought by both Affymetrix and Kirk. (See 2/8/10 Agreement between Affymetrix and Kirk
§§ 3.2 & 3.3 (Dkt. #130-24 in Case No. 09-cv-277-bbc).) Thus, it is possible that Affymetrix
and Kirk entered into a more recent agreement or arrangement pertaining to this action. Any
such arrangement could be relevant to Kirk’s bias as a witness, especially if it includes a
monetary incentive.
7.

Illumina should also be allowed to serve interrogatories and requests for

admission on Kirk on the issue of laches and other issues pertaining to inventorship because such
discovery tools were not available in the prior actions as Kirk was not a named party.
8.

Illumina also disagrees that the Court may resolve Plaintiffs’ claims for correction

of inventorship through a mere hearing. Instead, the Court should conduct a full bench trial,
during which the parties may call and cross-examine witnesses and present oral arguments to the
Court.
9.

Accordingly, in the event the Court denies Illumina’s motion to dismiss, Illumina

respectfully requests that the Court schedule a status conference to discuss these issues and the
case schedule.
