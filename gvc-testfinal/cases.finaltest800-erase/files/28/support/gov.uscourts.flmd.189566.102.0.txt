INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff’s Consolidated Second Amended Class Action Complaint1 (the “Second
Amended Complaint,” or “Sec. Am. Compl.”) is yet another example of a widely parroted
yet long discredited model of a securities fraud class action complaint that tries to transform
every decline in share price into a securities fraud by working backwards to recharacterize
everything that preceded the decline, no matter how innocuous, as evidence of fraud.
The Second Amended Complaint, like its two predecessors, centers around a broad
array of alleged misrepresentations that were “revealed” when the Company issued two press
releases, in November and December 2006, announcing the pendency of an SEC
investigation and receipt of a Grand Jury subpoena. However, those press releases have
nothing to do with the bulk of Plaintiff’s allegations, and the short press releases make
absolutely no admission of wrongdoing. Furthermore, since their announcement over two
years ago, to date no enforcement actions or indictments have been brought against the
Company or any of the Individual Defendants.

What really happened here is that the

Company properly announced the existence of pending government investigations, which
caused its stock price to drop. Plaintiff then seized on that stock-price decline to file a strike
1

The original Complaint was filed on December 28, 2006 [D.E. #1]. Plaintiff then filed the
Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on July 10, 2007 [D.E. #34] (the “First Amended Complaint”),
which this Court dismissed. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed the instant second amended complaint [D.E. #96], but
also titled it the “Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint.” To avoid confusion, the instant complaint is
hereinafter referred to as Plaintiff’s “Second Amended Complaint.”

lawsuit hoping to extract a settlement, and then “reverse engineered” a theory that the
Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct that allegedly caused the stock to drop.
The Second Amended Complaint is virtually identical in substance to Plaintiff’s first
amended complaint, which this Court has already struck down as a “shotgun pleading” that
“failed to connect the relevant facts to the elements of each claim.” Durham v. Whitney
Information Network, Inc., 2008 WL 4936999, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 17, 2008). [D.E. #95].
The Second Amended Complaint similarly provides a revisionist history of the Company that
is long on vague accusations, but devoid of any specifics about which statements supposedly
were fraudulent, why they were in error, and how each Defendant supposedly had knowledge
of the “fraud.” What purports to be a new complaint is nothing more than fundamentally the
same complaint that this Court has already dismissed; this new “version” just includes
section headings and a reorganization of identical same content. As set forth below, this is
precisely the type of case that Congress intended to curtail through the PSLRA by
heightening the pleading standards for private securities claims, and this is precisely the type
of case that the Supreme Court struck down in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.,
127 S. Ct. 2499 (2007).
Although Plaintiff has been given three chances to adequately state a cause of action,
the Second Amended Complaint remains a “puzzle pleading” of the sort that has been
repeatedly criticized by the federal courts. See, e.g., Wenger v. Lumisys, Inc., 2 F. Supp. 2d
1231, 1244 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (“In the context of securities class action complaints, courts
have repeatedly lamented Plaintiff’s counsels’ tendency to place the burden on the reader to
sort out the statements and match them with the corresponding adverse facts to solve the
‘puzzle’ of interpreting Plaintiff’s claims.”) (internal quotes and alteration omitted); In re
GlenFed Sec. Litig., 42 F.3d 1541, 1552 (9th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (superseded by statute on
other grounds) (These “puzzle-style” complaints are “an unwelcome and wholly unnecessary
{M2773455;1}

2

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 6 of 49

strain on defendants and the court system.”); In re Conner Peripherals, Inc., 1996 WL
193811, at *1 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (“Judicial resources are too scarce and worthy cases too
pressing for a court to spend its time rooting around in bloated complaints by experienced
lawyers for a handful of actionable allegations.”). Even the most thorough reading of the
Second Amended Complaint leaves one wondering exactly what the Company has done that
amounts to a violation of Rule 10b-5. Simply speaking, it is not the Court’s obligation to
weed through Plaintiff’s tangled mass of allegations in an effort to ascertain whether a
handful arguably amount to an actionable claim.
The Second Amended Complaint, now Plaintiff’s third bite at the apple, is a strike
lawsuit produced by “reverse engineering.” Plaintiff’s theories, which are nearly identical to
those in the First Amended Complaint, have three main components: (1) the Company
allegedly misled its stockholders regarding the amount of “deferred revenue” disclosed in the
Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”); (2) the
Company allegedly misled its stockholders regarding the level of reserves imposed by credit
card processors as protection against limited requests for customer credit card refunds
(known as “chargebacks”) and the level of those chargebacks; and (3) the Company’s entire
business model of selling stock market and real estate investment education seminars and
materials allegedly was a “sham.”
When the Second Amended Complaint is scrutinized, it is clear that Plaintiff has not
adequately alleged any basis for his allegations under the PSLRA and Tellabs, nor has he
cured the fatal deficiencies of his previous two complaints. Plaintiff has not alleged facts that
would give rise to any inference, let alone the statutorily required “strong” inference, that
Defendants acted with scienter. Moreover, and fatal to his allegations, Plaintiff cannot
satisfy the “reliance” and “loss causation” elements of a securities fraud claim because the
Company’s stock was not traded in an efficient market and because the November and

December 2006 press releases have no causal link to the fraud alleged. For all of these
reasons, this Court must dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.
II.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

This is a purported securities class action brought under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), Rule 10b-5
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
§ 78t(a), on behalf of a putative class of all purchasers of the common stock of the Company,
from August 11, 2005 through December 15, 2006 (the “Purported Class Period”).
The original Complaint (the “Complaint” or “Compl.”), filed on December 28, 2006,
alleged that the Company, Russell A. Whitney and Nicholas S. Maturo “deceiv[ed] the
investing public” by issuing materially false and misleading press releases about the success
of the Company. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 54 [D.E. #1]. Notably, the only “support” that Plaintiff
offered for his vague allegations was the inclusion of the lengthy excerpts from press releases
and SEC filings from the Purported Class Period. Compl. ¶¶ 24-44. Plaintiff’s initial claims
would have been subject to dismissal for failure to satisfy the PSLRA’s heightened pleading
requirements.
Evidently recognizing this fundamental flaw, and demonstrating Plaintiff’s intent to
use the Complaint as a “place holder” while it attempted to “reverse engineer” a theory of
fraud, Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint on July 10, 2007 [D.E. #34]. The First
Amended Complaint spanned 210 paragraphs and 111 pages.2 Despite its volume, the
unusually long pleading contained nothing of substance. Rather, its length was intended to

The First Amended Complaint was filed by Court-appointed Lead Plaintiff, Arnold Friedman, and
added additional Defendants Ronald S. Simon, Alfred R. Novas, John F. Kane, Rance Masheck and Ehrhart
Keefe Steiner & Hottman PC. Initial plaintiff Rodney Durham was unwilling to show that he bought or sold
any stock in the Company during the Purported Class Period. See Certification of Proposed Lead Plaintiff
Pursuant to Federal Securities Laws, dated December 21, 2006. He was apparently a “place holder plaintiff”
for the initial Complaint –– he was only included in the caption box of the First Amended Complaint for
supposed “administrative purposes.” First Amended Comp ¶ 23.

mask the insufficiency of its allegations and its inability to satisfy the pleading standards of
the PSLRA.

In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff largely abandoned his initial

argument regarding the allegedly misleading statements, and instead attempted to reverse
engineer a theory of accounting fraud.
On September 28, 2007, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss the First Amended
Complaint. [D.E. #50]. This Court did not reach all of the merits of the Motion to Dismiss.
Instead, the First Amended Complaint was dismissed for failure to meet the basic pleading
requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and the heightened requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9 and
the Reform Act.

Durham, 2008 WL 4936999.

Specifically, the Court held that “the

complaint is a typical shotgun pleading, in which each count incorporates by reference all
preceding paragraphs of the complaint” and “fails to sufficiently connect the elements of the
claims to the 196 paragraphs of the facts preceding them.” Id. at *1-*2. Therefore, the Court
dismissed the First Amended Complaint and directed Defendants to “refile their Motions to
Dismiss after Plaintiff has amended the Complaint.” Id. at *2.

STATEMENT OF FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Description Of The Company’s Business

Based in Cape Coral, Florida, the Company provides educational and training courses
for students throughout the United States and overseas, offering instruction in real estate
investing, stock market investment techniques, cash management, asset protection, and other
financially-oriented subjects.

See April 2, 2007 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2006.3 App. Tab 1.

In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court may take judicial notice of relevant documents publicly
filed with the SEC. Hubbard v. BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., 2008 WL 5250271 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2008);
Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., 187 F.3d 1271, 1287 (11th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, on September 28, 2007, at
the same time Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint, Defendants also filed
their Appendix to Defendants’ Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s
Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (“App.”), which this Court should consider on a motion to
dismiss. [D.E. # 53]. To avoid unnecessary duplication, Defendants incorporate their Appendix herein, rather
than re-filing the identical (and voluminous) document a second time.

Students primarily are recruited by attending free introductory workshops that are
hosted by one of the Company’s trainers and held at a local hotel or other rented auditorium
facility. Id. at 4. Thereafter, a student may purchase reference materials on the subject
discussed or may elect to receive further fee-based training in the many courses offered by
the Company, either in the student’s hometown or at regional training centers. Id. at 6. The
Company engages trainers, instructors, coaches and mentors in connection with various
educational course offerings. Id. at 4. Following the first fee-based training session, students
interested in learning more on the course topics also may subscribe to periodic publications,
purchase books or software programs, or attend advanced training courses. Sample advanced
courses include Commercial Real Estate Investing, Tax Liens and Deeds, Property
Management and Cash Flow, and Asset Protection and Tax Relief. In addition, the Company
provides a mentoring program, whereby students receive mentoring from someone
knowledgeable in the field. Id. at 6-9.
B.

The Company Announces Investigations By The SEC And USAO

The critical events relied upon by Plaintiff in the Second Amended Complaint are the
issuance of two press releases by the Company announcing investigations by the SEC and the
United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (“USAO”) on November
21, 2006, and December 15, 2006, respectively. The November 21, 2006 press release,
which Plaintiff claims to have “shocked and alarmed” investors, revealed only that the SEC
was investigating “the efficacy or trading success of the Company’s stock market education
programs” and “the Company’s acquisition of certain other companies.” Sec. Am. Compl.
¶ 140; App. Tab 2. In addition, the December 15, 2006 press release stated that the Company
“had received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the United States Attorney for the Eastern
District of Virginia and [the Company] had been notified that [it] was being investigated for
its marketing activities.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 142; App. Tab 3.

Page 10 of 49

These press releases have nothing to do with Plaintiff’s theories, as Plaintiff’s
theories relate to accounting for deferred revenues, the treatment of “chargebacks,” the
background of Mr. Whitney, or the fundamental nature of the Company’s business model. In
fact, Plaintiff fails to point to any portion of the press releases that actually identify, reveal,
or disclose any misconduct.

Instead, Plaintiff equates the Company’s disclosure of an

investigation with actual misconduct—despite the fact that no enforcement action against the
Company or the Individual Defendants has been brought in over two years since the
announcements. As discussed below, such an allegation is not sufficient under the PSLRA.
C.

Summary Of Allegations In The Second Amended Complaint

The Second Amended Complaint, mirroring the First Amended Complaint, abandons
much of the initial allegations of the original Complaint concerning alleged marketing
shortcomings. Instead, the Second Amended Complaint focuses on the same unsupported
accounting allegations in the First Amended Complaint concerning chargebacks from credit
card companies, Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 43-57, 116, and Defendants’ alleged manipulation
of Deferred Revenue.

Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 52(ii).

Plaintiff makes unsubstantiated and

baseless allegations of violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)
and alleged improper SEC filings. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28, 65, 73, 87, 89, 111-114. In
addition, Plaintiff unsuccessfully tries to claim that a business model based on “up-selling” is
somehow a violation of the federal securities laws. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 21, 38.
Rather than accept the obvious fact that uncertainty regarding the SEC and USAO
investigations caused the Company’s stock price to go down, and rather than await the
outcome of the investigations, Plaintiff raced to concoct allegations of fraud that he hopes
will require the Company to indemnify shareholders’ market losses. Plaintiff’s lengthy,
convoluted, and ill-defined theories of “fraud” include:

{M2773455;1}

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

•

Document 102

Filed 01/30/2009

Page 11 of 49

Theory One: Plaintiff contends that the Company committed fraud because it allegedly
did not properly report some unspecified level of deferred revenues. It is important to
understand that the Company’s students paid the Company upfront, and therefore, this
theory is limited to the question of when the Company recognized as “revenue” cash it
already had received. As the Second Amended Complaint concedes, the Company
disclosed at the outset of the class period that “[t]he Company’s policy has been to
recognize revenue at the earlier of the attendance of a course or one year from the date of
registration.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 70. Subsequently, the Second Amended Complaint
asserts that the Company “announced the need to restate [its] Company’s financial
statements from 2001 through and including 2005 so that recognition of revenue would
be in line with its previously-announced policies.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 109. Plaintiff
offers no specific allegations that the Company ever recognized revenue in a manner
contrary to these disclosures. And, the market responded to that news with an increase in
the Company’s share price. That is a market reality that Plaintiff chose to ignore.

•

Theory Two: Plaintiff contends that the Company committed fraud because it allegedly
failed to disclose (1) increased customer “chargebacks” (in which some customers asked
their credit card companies to refund the money they paid the Company for tuition) and
(2) how banks processing credit card payments to the Company reacted to such
chargebacks. Like his First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff devotes much of his Second
Amended Complaint to describing this so-called “crisis” that is nothing more than a
tempest in a teapot. The Second Amended Complaint concedes that the chargebacks at
issue were insignificant in light of the Company’s total revenues. See Sec. Am. Compl. ¶
50 ($1 million in chargebacks in the first half of 2004); Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 58 ($136
million in revenues in 2004); Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 43 (5% reserves sufficient to cover
chargebacks in second quarter of 2005). There is no allegation that the Company ever

{M2773455;1}

8

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 102

Filed 01/30/2009

Page 12 of 49

lost the right to receive credit card payments, and no credit card processor has filed suit.
When the credit card processors increased their reserves –– prior to the Purported Class
Period –– the Company timely disclosed the increased reserves.

Id.

The Second

Amended Complaint further contends that the Company committed fraud because it
allegedly failed to disclose that it had a strict policy limiting returns that, according to
Plaintiff’s naked assertions, was “unreasonable and illegal.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 48. Yet
Plaintiff identifies no law against a strict refund policy (and Defendants are not aware of
any), nor does he allege that the Defendants ever breached a specific contractual
obligation to any of their customers, nor, notably, does he allege that any student has ever
brought suit against the Company seeking a refund. The Second Amended Complaint
moreover admits that the Company disclosed in its SEC filings during the Purported
Class Period that “the fees are generally nonrefundable.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 71.
•

Theory Three: Plaintiff contends that the Company committed fraud because its entire
business model was allegedly a “sham” and that it somehow had a duty to (and failed to)
disclose certain background information about its founder. Plaintiff’s overblown rhetoric
–– e.g., the Company was allegedly “scamming consumers” with “worthless” products,
Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 37 –– is belied by the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint.
Far from painting a picture of an unsustainable model, the Second Amended Complaint
shows a tremendous financial success based on a growing platform of satisfied students.
Plaintiff, who himself purchased shares of the Company to profit from its sales of
seminars to students, cynically has tried to attack the Company by shedding crocodile
tears for its students. But the Company’s students, unlike Plaintiff, are satisfied, and this
Court should not be gulled into believing otherwise. As part of the “sham” theory,
Plaintiff contends that the Company allegedly committed fraud by failing to disclose
certain alleged negative facts about its founder, Russ Whitney, from 20 to 30 years ago.

Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 29-31, 97. Mr. Whitney’s youthful missteps are not alleged to be the
subject of the government’s investigation, nor to have been freshly revealed just prior to
any stock price decline. These allegations are nothing more than a thinly veiled effort to
prejudice the Court against Mr. Whitney.
As more fully set forth below, Plaintiff’s allegations are demonstrably baseless and
fail to satisfy the fundamental pleading requirements of the PSLRA.
IV.
A.

ARGUMENT

The PSLRA Imposes Heightened Pleading Standards With Regard to
Securities Fraud

In response to abuses in securities fraud class action lawsuits, Congress passed the
PSLRA in 1995. Pub. L. No. 104-67 (1995); see generally S. Rep. No. 98, 104th Cong.,
reprinted in 1995 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 679. In adopting the PSLRA, Congress
made the decision to impose a unique and rigorous set of pleading standards –– well beyond
that of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 9(b) –– applicable only to private securities
claims such as this one. As a result, in order to survive a motion to dismiss under the
PSLRA, even at this preliminary pleading stage, the Second Amended Complaint must
endure rigorous scrutiny under the heightened pleading standards established for Section
10(b) claims.4 See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 81
(2006).
Significantly, the PSLRA was enacted in response to widespread evidence of
“abusive and manipulative securities litigation” brought under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”) and the Exchange Act.5 See H.R. Rep. No. 369, 104th Cong., at 31-32;
4

In order to state a claim for securities fraud under Section 10(b), a plaintiff must allege (1) a
misstatement or omission, (2) of a material fact, (3) made with scienter, (4) upon which the plaintiff relied, (5)
that proximately caused the plaintiff’s injury. Bryant, 187 F.3d at 1281.
5

It has long been recognized that securities fraud cases are particularly susceptible to strike suits such
as this one. Considerations far removed from the merits, such as the cost of discovery, the potential exposure to
the corporation, and the reputational harm inherent in protracted litigation, often counsel settlement even when
{M2773455;1}

Bryant, 187 F.3d at 1271. “In enacting the PSLRA, Congress clearly intended to cut back the
ease with which shareholders, through federal class action suits, could hold corporations and
their officers at legal swordpoint, with resultant settlements netting millions for Plaintiffs’
lawyers, but pennies for their clients.” In re Manugistics Group, Inc. Sec. Litig., 1999 WL
1209509, *1 (D. Md. Aug. 6, 1999). In the PSLRA, Congress provided specific authority for
an aggressive review of securities fraud complaints by instituting a number of reforms aimed
at striking the appropriate balance between promoting effective enforcement of the securities
laws and protecting the investment community from “open-ended liability.” Id.; see also
Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2508 (listing reforms). “An important component of achieving this
goal was structuring the legislation to permit the dismissal of frivolous cases at the earliest
feasible stage of the litigation, thereby reducing the cost to the company, and by derivation,
to its shareholders, in defending a baseless action.” Id.
The PSLRA’s heightened pleading standard is found in Section 21D(b) of the
Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b). Section 21D(b) imposes two pleading requirements
(in addition to those set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 9(b)), and provides
that if these requirements are not met, “the court shall, on the motion of any defendant,
dismiss the complaint.”

Exchange Act § 21D(b)(3)(A), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(A)

(emphasis added).
The first critical requirement is to “specify each statement [alleged] to have been
misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and if an allegation
regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall
state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.” Exchange Act § 21D(b)(1),

the plaintiff’s chances of succeeding are exceedingly slim. See Janet Alexander, Do the Merits Matter? A Study
of Settlements in Securities Class Actions, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 497, 529-34 (1991). Plaintiff’s attorneys, by
contrast, may cobble together a complaint alleging violations of federal securities laws with relative ease,
enticed by the prospect of a lucrative fee in the event of settlement. See id. at 534-48.

(M.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2007). The second requirement is to “state with particularity facts giving
rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind” –– in this
case, “severe recklessness.” Exchange Act § 21D(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2); Bryant,
187 F.3d at 1287 (clarifying heightened pleading standard); Mizzaro, 544 F.3d at 1238; In re
Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703 at *3. Because the Second Amended Complaint does
not satisfy either pleading standard, it is mandatory under the statute that this Court dismiss
the Second Amended Complaint. Exchange Act § 21D(b)(3)(A), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(A)
(if these requirements are not met, “the court shall, on the motion of any defendant, dismiss
the complaint.”).
The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Tellabs reaffirmed the vitality of the
PSLRA’s heightened pleading standard as a bulwark against frivolous securities fraud
actions. In Tellabs, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff “must plead facts rendering an
inference of scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.” Tellabs, 127 S.
Ct. at 2513. (emphasis in original). In reaching these conclusions, the Court relied heavily
upon the animating purpose behind the Reform Act, i.e., the need to “curb perceived abuses
of the § 10(b) private action — nuisance filings, targeting of deep-pocket defendants,
vexatious discovery requests and manipulation by class action lawyers.” Id. at 2508 (internal
quotes omitted).
Here, as is more fully explained below, Plaintiff meets neither of the PSRLA’s
standards.6 First, he does not state with particularity each statement he believes to be
misleading, and why. Second, he does not state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong
6

As set forth below, because Plaintiff fails to adequately plead a primary violation under Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act, his Section 20(a) “controlling persons” claims of vicarious liability must also be
dismissed.

inference of severe recklessness. Thus, this case is precisely the type of securities litigation
that the Supreme Court struck down in Tellabs.

The Second Amended Complaint Fails To Allege Fraud With Particularity
As Required By The PSLRA
1.

The Second Amended Complaint Cannot Survive Because It Is Not
Based On Personal Knowledge

At the outset, allegations based upon investigation by plaintiff’s counsel are no longer
an acceptable approach to pleading under the PSLRA, and constitute grounds for dismissal of
the Second Amended Complaint. In re Manugistics Group Inc., 1999 WL 1209509 at *2.
Just as in the First Amended Complaint, the Second Amended Complaint is pled based on an
investigation of Plaintiff’s counsel. See e.g. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51, 115. Plaintiff concedes
that his allegations are “based upon the investigation of Plaintiff’s counsel, which included
a review and analysis of publicly available SEC filings, regulatory filings and reports,
securities analysts’ reports and advisories, press releases and other public statements and
media reports, as well as discussions with both public and confidential witnesses.” Sec. Am.
Compl. ¶ 175 (“Basis of Allegations”).

In other words, Plaintiff has no independent

knowledge on which his allegations are based. Lirette v. Shiva Corp., 999 F. Supp. 164, 165
(D. Mass. 1998) (finding that allegations based upon investigation by Plaintiffs’ counsel are
“no longer an acceptable approach to pleading.”)
2.

The Second Amended Complaint Cannot Survive Because It Does Not
Identify With Particularity What Statements Were False And
Misleading

A complaint alleging securities fraud must allege with particularity the “who, what,
why, where, and when” of the alleged fraud. Garfield v. NDC Health Corp, 466 F.3d 1255,
1262 (11th Cir. 2006); In re Smith Gardner Sec. Litig., 214 F. Supp. 2d 1291 (S.D. Fla.
2002); In re Peritus Software, 52 F. Supp. 2d 211 (D. Mass. 1999). This requirement is a
centerpiece of the PSLRA, and was imposed to prevent meritless “fishing expeditions.” See

H.R. Rep. No. 369, 104th Cong., at 31-32, 37, reprinted in 1995 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.
News 730, 730-731, 736.
Here, Plaintiff makes broad, catch-all allegations that Defendants made false and
misleading statements during the Purported Class Period “in the Company’s public filings
and releases regarding the background of Company founder Russ Whitney, the Company’s
business model, its ‘educational’ products, its financial results, its compliance with [GAAP]
and its internal controls.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 19-114.7 Plaintiff merely quotes and
summarizes the Company’s SEC filings and press releases and then blithely asserts that
“[t]he statements made by Defendants . . . were each materially false and misleading when
made,” see e.g., Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 69, without providing any meaningful explanation.
Rather, he instead regurgitates general theories about the Company’s alleged non-compliance
with GAAP (Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶

28, 65, 73, 87, 91, 102, 110) or criticisms of the

Company’s business model (Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 66, 87, 91, 95, 97, 104, 108).
Courts in this District reject this general approach to pleading as inconsistent with the
“who, what, when, where, and how” that must be pled pursuant to Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.
See In re Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703 at *4 (“Here, Plaintiff appears to allege, in
essence, that because the financial statements for the years 2000 through the first three
quarters of 2005 were restated, therefore the 15 or so public filings and 50 press releases
issued during that time period were erroneous and thus, fraudulent misrepresentations. The
Court rejects this whole-cloth approach as inconsistent with the required ‘who, what, when,
where, and how’ of Rule 9(b).”). The allegations of “misleading statements” in the Second
Amended Complaint do not satisfy the standard of pleading “(1) precisely what documents or
oral representations were made, and (2) the time and place of each such statement and the

content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what

1237 (affirming dismissal of complaint because it failed to satisfy the PSLRA’s heightened
pleading standards); In re Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703 at *5. As the Second
Amended Complaint fails to satisfy the PSLRA’s heightened pleading standards, dismissal is
the appropriate remedy.
C.

The Second Amended Complaint Fails To Allege A Strong Inference of
Scienter as Required by The PSLRA

In the securities fraud context, it is well-settled that allegations of scienter must be
pleaded with particularity. Exchange Act §21D(b)(2); Hubbard v. BankAtlantic Bancorp,
Inc., 2008 WL 5250271 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2008); Mizzaro, 544 F.3d at 1238-1239; In re
Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703 at *3; In re Recoton, 358 F. Supp. 2d at 1138. Under
the PSLRA, Plaintiff is required to plead particularized facts giving rise to a strong inference
of scienter. Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2501. To qualify as a “strong inference of scienter” within
the meaning of Section 21D(b)(2) of the PSLRA, an inference of scienter “must be more than
merely plausible or reasonable.” Id. at 2504-2505. A complaint only can survive if “a
reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as
any plausible opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Id. at 2502-03;
Mizzaro, 544 F.3d at 1238-1239. Tellabs further provides that omissions and ambiguities in
a plaintiff’s complaint should “count against inferring scienter.” Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2503.
In Mizzaro, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal, with prejudice, of a putative
securities class action complaint filed by purchasers of publicly traded common stock of

Home Depot, Inc. 544 F.3d 1230. The plaintiffs alleged that Home Depot committed
securities fraud by utilizing improper chargebacks to vendors that allegedly inflated the
company’s financial results. The court held that plaintiffs failed to allege facts giving rise to
a strong inference that the defendants acted with severe recklessness or supporting that Home
Depot’s financial statements were materially misstated. The court reasoned:
[S]imply alleging that a widespread fraud may have occurred is not enough.
Because scienter is an essential element of a securities fraud claim,
[plaintiffs’] allegations must create a strong inference – again, one that is
“cogent and compelling” – that the individual defendants knew about the
alleged fraud (or were severely reckless in not knowing about it) when they
made the purportedly false or misleading statements. In other words, to state
a claim against the individual defendants, [plaintiffs] also must allege facts
from which a reasonable person would infer that it is at least as likely as not
that the individual high-ranking defendants either orchestrated the alleged
fraud (and thus always knew about it), or learned about the alleged fraud
sometime before [the end of the class period], or were otherwise severely
reckless in not learning of the claimed fraud during that period. Like the
district court, we are convinced that the amended complaint falls short.
Id., 544 F.3d at 1247 (emphasis in original) (quoting Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,
Ltd., 127 S. Ct. 2499, 2510 (2007)).
In contravention of Eleventh Circuit precedent, Plaintiff seeks to establish scienter
partly by alleging that the Defendants had “motive and opportunity” to engage in the
allegedly fraudulent activity set forth in the Second Amended Complaint. Thus, Plaintiff
asserts that “Defendants were motivated to materially misrepresent to the SEC and investors
the true financial condition of the Company,” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 129, and that Defendants
had the opportunity to participate in the alleged fraudulent scheme “[b]y virtue of their highlevel positions, their direct participation in and awareness of the Company’s operations, and
intimate knowledge of the material falsity of the Company’s financial statements, press
releases, and other statements made to the investing public during the Class Period.” Sec.

Am. Compl. ¶ 171. Although some Circuits have accepted such “motive and opportunity”
pleadings as a basis for establishing scienter, the Eleventh Circuit has emphatically declined
to do so, even before the Supreme Court reaffirmed the strength of the PSLRA’s pleading
requirements in Tellabs.

See Bryant, 187 F.3d at 1285 (“[W]e reject the notion that

allegations of motive and opportunity to commit fraud, standing alone, are sufficient to
establish scienter in this Circuit.”); see also Hubbard v. BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., 2008
WL 5250271 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2008); Edward J. Goodman Life Income Trust v. Jabil
Circuit, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 2d 1221, 1238 (M.D. Fla. 2008).
1.

There Are No Facts Alleged to Suggest a Strong Inference of Scienter

Instead of alleging any meaningful factual detail to support a claim of securities
fraud, the Second Amended Complaint rests mostly on anecdotes and conclusory allegations,
such as the Company’s “business model was based on scamming consumers,” Sec. Am.
Compl. ¶¶ 37, 44, or that Defendants somehow had a duty to and failed to “disclose the true
background of Russ Whitney.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 97.
The Second Amended Complaint condemns the Company for its business model,
alleging that the “primary purpose in hosting classes was not to educate students to make
astounding amounts of money from stock market and real estate investments, but rather to
‘up-sell’ them even more unconscionably expensive and worthless classes.”

Sec. Am.

Compl. ¶ 21. The suggestion that there is something nefarious about a commercial enterprise
trying to “sell more product” is ridiculous. Certainly, a company has no duty to be altruistic
and provide its services at no cost to customers. Without question, a company’s interest in
promoting its product, increasing its revenue and enhancing the value to shareholders is a far

Page 21 of 49

more compelling and cogent explanation than any inference of fraud.8 See Tellabs, 127 S.
Ct. at 2510.
Plaintiff’s inclusion of Russell Whitney’s alleged background (dating back to his
teenage years) is nothing more than a smoke-screen to hide the otherwise insufficient
allegations, and a blatant attempt to prejudice the Court.9

For instance, allegations

concerning Mr. Whitney’s involvement in an alleged traffic accident in 1980 do not relate to
the Company’s success and are completely irrelevant to this matter. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 31.
Contrary to the allegations, Defendants had no duty to disclose Mr. Whitney’s distant
background.10 See also 17 C.F.R. § 229.401 (requiring disclosure of certain legal proceedings
that occurred in the past five years and that are “material to an evaluation of the ability or
integrity of any director, person nominated to become a director or executive officer of the
registrant.”) The PSLRA’s pleading standards demand much more than Plaintiff’s nebulous
characterization of Mr. Whitney’s background and the Company’s classes as “a sham.”

8

The Second Amended Complaint calls the Company’s classes “unconscionably expensive and
worthless.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 21. Bare allegations that the teachers and/or classes lack a certain quality do
not constitute grounds for a fraud claim, and a complaint about the quality of the classes has no connection at
all to a claim for securities fraud.
9

Equally important, as a matter of common sense, Plaintiff’s allegations about Mr. Whitney’s
background could hardly be material to stockholders, given that Plaintiff alleges that the Company’s website
already explains that Mr. Whitney started as “another high school drop out, street-wise, but headed nowhere.”
Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 29.
10

Even assuming that the traffic incident described in the Second Amended Complaint amounts to a
crime, courts consistently hold that the securities laws do not impose a general duty to disclose uncharged
criminal conduct of this sort. See, e.g., In re Marsh & Mclennan Cos. Sec. Litig., 501 F. Supp. 2d 452
(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (noting that “the securities laws do not impose a general duty to disclose . . . uncharged
criminal conduct”); In re Salomon Inc. Sec. Litig., 1994 WL 265917, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 1994) (“Absent
a duty to disclose, the mere failure to report or disclose criminal conduct by an employee of an issuer does not
constitute a violation of Section 10(b), even if such information is material.”); Ballan v. Wilfred Am.
Educational Corp., 720 F. Supp. 241, 249 (E.D.N.Y. 1989) (holding that the federal securities laws “do not
require a company’s management to confess guilt to uncharged crimes”). This is particularly true where, as
here, the conduct in question occurred nearly three decades ago.

The Second Amended Complaint Must Be Dismissed Because It Does
Not Sufficiently Identify Confidential Witnesses

In support of its allegations of fraud, and in contravention of standards imposed by
the PSLRA and Tellabs, the Second Amended Complaint relies on four “confidential”
witnesses.11 Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 22, 39, 40, 41, 42, 137. Although the Second Amended
Complaint devotes numerous paragraphs to the information allegedly provided by these four
confidential sources, that information is largely conclusory and anecdotal and fails to include
critical context and details. Id.
In Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., the Eleventh Circuit noted that courts should be
skeptical of confidential sources cited in securities fraud complaints, finding that confidential
witnesses are given credence only when the “the complaint unambiguously provides in a
cognizable and detailed way the basis of the whistleblower’s knowledge.” 544 F.3d 1230,
1239-40 (11th Cir. 2008). The Eleventh Circuit continued, holding that “the weight to be
afforded to allegations based on statements proffered by a confidential source depends on the
particularity of the allegations made in each case, and confidentiality is one factor that the
courts may consider . . . . Confidentiality, however, should not eviscerate the weight given if
the complaint otherwise fully describes the foundation or basis of the confidential witness’s
knowledge, including the position(s) held, the proximity to the offending conduct, and the
relevant time frame.” Id. at 1240 (emphasis added); see also Hubbard v. BankAtlantic
Bancorp, Inc., 2008 WL 5250271 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2008) (dismissing securities class
action complaint and refusing “to give any significant weight to the allegations based on
statements made by these confidential witnesses” where “there is no specific information as
to the confidential witnesses’ positions in the Company, their employment duties, the

Though the Second Amended Complaint references a CW#5 (presumably, another confidential
witness), there is no mention of a CW#4 or “Confidential Witness 4.”

foundation or basis for their knowledge, or whether they were even employed with the
Company during the relevant times in the Complaint”).12
In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff repeats the same deficient allegations
regarding his confidential witnesses and has added nothing to demonstrate how the
confidential witnesses were in a position to provide competent evidence. Under the standard
set forth in Mizzaro, the Second Amended Complaint’s description of the four confidential
witnesses is not pled with sufficient particularity to support the probability that the
confidential witnesses would possess information concerning the allegations contained
therein, nor does the Second Amended Complaint make any attempt at all to describe the
foundation of the confidential witnesses’ purported knowledge.13

Plaintiff’s failure to

12

In one of the first Circuit Court decisions to interpret Tellabs, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the
dismissal of a securities fraud claim that relied on statements from anonymous “confidential” witnesses because
such pleading does not satisfy the scienter requirement of the PSLRA. Higginbotham v. Baxter Int’l Inc., 495
F.3d 753 (7th Cir. 2007). The Higginbotham Court held that “confidential witness” allegations are not
sufficient under Tellabs and wholly rejected the argument that identities of “confidential witnesses” should be
protected to prevent retaliation, observing that “there is no ‘informer’s privilege’ in civil
litigation . . . Concealing names at the complaint stage thus does not protect informers from disclosure (and the
risk of retaliation); it does nothing but obstruct the judiciary’s ability to implement the PSLRA.” Id. at 757.
13

For example, Confidential Witness #1 allegedly was a “member of the Technical Support Team
during the Class Period . . . [and] had gotten a few calls which should have been routed to Customer Service, all
of which were from customers who were unhappy with the products.” The testimony from a tech-support
employee regarding “a few calls” expressing opinions on a product, intended for a customer service
representative does not indicate anything out of the ordinary. Sec. Am. Comp. ¶ 39. Confidential Witness #2
was allegedly a member of the “seminar sales team” during the Purported Class Period, who stated that “[i]n my
estimation, about 90% of people will not make their money back. You have to be responsible for your trades.
It is really hard to make money in the market without discipline . . . . [A]t least half of the class was a sales pitch
for more seminars and more products.” Sec. Am. Comp. ¶ 41. Confidential Witness #2 is not alleging anything
relating to a violation of securities laws; rather, s/he is offering his or her thoughts on the stock market in
general and on the fundamental principle of a company to sell its product. It is noteworthy that Confidential
Witness #3, allegedly “a member of the Company’s technical support team during the Class Period,” is
somehow in a position to offer an opinion that the “EduTrades proposed IPO never occurred” because
“information in the SEC registration was not ‘matching up.’” Sec. Am. Comp. ¶ 137. Would a member of the
technical support team who is not a part of the Company’s executive, legal or accounting department be familiar
enough with the EduTrades IPO that any credibility should attach to his or her statements? Surely, the answer
to that question is “no.” Moreover, the allegation that numbers were not “matching up” is the epitome of vague
pleading rejected under the PSLRA. Id. Finally, the only mention of the fourth confidential witness, CW#5, is
that s/he “was trained at the corporate office and . . . worked as a sales representative from July 2006 through
January 2007, [and] learned on the road that the objective was to close the sales.” This cannot possibly sound in
fraud, as any company whose purpose is sales would encourage its employees to “close the deal.” If an
aggressive sales posture amounted to fraud, virtually every sales-based company in the country would be put
out of business. Also, to the extent that s/he learned of matters “on the road,” that allegation does not give rise

sufficiently identify his four “confidential” witnesses requires dismissal of the Second
Amended Complaint.
3.

The Robert Paisola E-mail Does Not Establish Scienter

Identical to the First Amended Complaint, the centerpiece of Plaintiff’s “substantive
allegations” is a reproduction of the (unsubstantiated) allegations of an e-mail memorandum
by former employee Robert Paisola, dated August 18, 2005 (the “Paisola E-mail”).14 Sec.
Am. Compl. ¶¶ 117-125. Paisola himself is a convicted felon with a history of making false
allegations, and his allegations therefore do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
See Int’l Profit Assocs., Inc. v. Robert Paisola, 461 F. Supp. 2d 672, 675 (N.D. Ill. 2006)
(granting injunctive relief against Mr. Paisola for publishing defamatory allegations and false
and misleading information); United States v. Robert Paisola, a/k/a Robert H. Paisola, Jared
Rob DeHeart and Robert DeHeart, 2003 WL 21983788 (Utah Ct. App. 2003) (concerning
Mr. Paisola’s multiple convictions for making false loan applications and other matters).
As set forth in the Second Amended Complaint, Paisola ceased to be an employee of
the Company eight days into the Purported Class Period.

Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 125.

Therefore, it is impossible that Paisola could have had access during the entire Purported
Class Period to information relevant to the alleged “gross abuse of refund policy;
manipulation of deferred revenues; credit chargebacks and abuse of merchant credit
accounts; and artificial inflation of revenue figures.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 118.
Moreover, nothing about Paisola’s position or previous experience lends a modicum
of credibility to his allegations. Unsurprisingly, the Paisola E-mail raises more questions
to an inference that the Individual Defendants, who were executives in the corporate offices, participated in any
fraud.
14

Notably, there is no allegation that the Paisola E-mail was sent to Defendants Russell Whitney or
Alfred Novas. Plaintiff attempts to play fast and loose with the Court by insinuating that the Paisola E-mail was
sent to Russell Whitney. The Second Amended Complaint states that the Paisola E-mail was sent to Russell
Whitney Jr. (the son of Russell Whitney), who is not a named defendant and was not an executive or director of
the Company. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 117.

than answers: How did the Company respond to Paisola’s E-mail? What accounts were
allegedly in “crisis mode,” how much was involved, and what was the supposed crisis?
Which divisions were “out of control?” To what information did Paisola have access? Upon
what basis does Paisola allege that the Company’s accounting practices were not disclosed to
merchant banks, and which banks is he referring to? Is this merely another attempt by
Paisola to defame an innocent company?
These types of questions are not merely rhetorical, but are the types of questions that
a securities fraud complaint must answer clearly before it even has a chance to survive a
motion to dismiss. See Malin v. IVAX Corp., 17 F. Supp. 2d 1345, 1360 (S.D. Fla. 1998)
(plaintiffs did not adequately plead scienter merely by pleading the existence of an
undisclosed “massive practice of shelf-stock adjustments on numerous pharmaceutical
products” because the complaint was devoid of facts supporting any claim that the practice
existed, which products and customers were affected, the amount of the inventory
adjustments, and the extent to which the adjustments affected Ivax’s financial projections);
see also In re Smith Gardner, 214 F. Supp. 2d. at 1299; Echavarri v. Cellstar Corp., No. 991502-CIV-GRAHAM, slip op. at 11-14 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 3, 2000), App. Tab 4.

The Allegations Concerning Alleged Accounting Fraud Do Not Give
Rise to a Strong Inference of Scienter

Plaintiff’s allegations that the Company allegedly failed to properly report deferred
revenues in accordance with GAAP are insufficient to give rise to a strong inference of
scienter. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28, 65, 73, 87, 89, 111-114. As a threshold matter, a claim of
non-compliance with GAAP, even if pled and proven, does not establish securities fraud. In
re Recoton Corp., 358 F. Supp. 2d at 1147 (“[I]t is well-settled that allegations of GAAP and
GAAS [Generally Accepted Auditing Standards] violations are insufficient, by themselves,
to state a claim of fraud with particularity.”); see also Hubbard, 2008 WL at *17-18. Even
allegations of a severe departure from GAAP are not sufficient. See, e.g., Rehm v. Eagle Fin.

That is because generally accepted

accounting principles “are far from being a canonical set of rules,” but rather “tolerate a
range of ‘reasonable’ treatments, leaving the choice among alternatives to management.”
Thor Power Tool Co. v. Comm’r, 439 U.S. 522, 544 (1979); see also In re IKON Office
Solutions, Inc. Sec. Litig., 277 F.3d 658, 675 n.22 (3d Cir. 2002) (“GAAP is a term of art that
encompasses a wide range of acceptable procedures.”).15
The Second Amended Complaint makes sweeping allegations that deferred revenues
were manipulated, but offers no details to corroborate the amount of alleged improper
deferred revenue, when it was allegedly recognized in error, or why it was in error. The
PSLRA requires much, much more. The closest the Second Amended Complaint comes to
alleging specifics is that the Company purportedly “immediately recogniz[ed] material
amounts of ‘Coaching’ fees despite the fact that these services were virtually identical to
mentoring services.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 57.
In any event, Plaintiff has failed to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of
scienter in connection with these allegations. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that
the Paisola E-mail vaguely suggested that the Company’s decision to immediately recognize
revenue received from coaching is “not proper” and that the Company was “playing” a
“deferred revenue game.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 124. First, neither the Paisola E-mail nor the

revenue should be recognized in the same manner as mentoring revenue. Second, giving

Compare Zuckerman v. Smart Choice Automotive Group, Inc., 2000 WL 33996254 at *2 (M.D. Fla.
Aug. 29, 2000), in which the alleged earnings discrepancy arose following a “systematic practice of falsifying
customer information submitted to the Company’s credit review and approval division” which included forging
documents, recording down payments as having been paid that were not, in fact, paid, and misrepresenting the
true cost of vehicles. As distinguished by the court in In re Paincare, “there were allegations [in Zuckerman]
that the CFO failed to report that a subsidiary had been sold, and another subsidiary was falsely reported to have
engaged in revenue producing activities when, in fact, this subsidiary had no operations. Thus, Zuckerman
involved a failure to disclose known misdeeds and a purposeful withholding or misstating of known
information. By contrast, here there are no such allegations of corporate wrongdoing and cover-up. No
smoking guns are alleged, no corporate conspiracy is pled.” In re Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703 at * 6.

Plaintiff every possible benefit of the doubt (as is required for the purpose of this motion to
dismiss only), at best the Paisola Email describes an error that resulted in the premature
recognition of revenue by only $6 million per year, or 3.7% of 2005 revenues, and had no
effect on the Company’s cash flow statement. App. Tab 5.
As the Second Amended Complaint recognizes, the Company issued a press release
on May 15, 2006, followed by the filing of a Form 8-K with the SEC on May 19, 2006,
which announced the restatement of financial results to reflect a change in the Company’s
revenue recognition policy. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89-92; App. Tabs 6 and 7. The fact that a
restatement of audited financials occurred is not sufficient, in and of itself, to raise a strong
inference of scienter. Courts have held that a subsequent revelation of the errors of previous
statements does not imply scienter, because mere allegations that statements in one report
should have been made in earlier reports do not make out a claim of securities fraud. See
e.g., In re Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703 at *7 (dismissing securities class action
complaint, finding that the fact that an accounting error resulted in a restatement of earnings
“does not serve as an indicium of fraud under [the] circumstances.”). The restatement
announcement had no negative impact on the Company’s stock prices, and the amount of
revenue prematurely recognized was under 10% each year. App. Tab 5 at p. 4 (2005: 9.5%,
2004: 2.6%, 2003: 5.7%).
Under Tellabs, this Court is required to weigh the competing inferences to be drawn
from the allegations of the Second Amended Complaint and may find proper pleading of
scienter “only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least
as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” 127 S. Ct.
at 2510. No reasonable person could conclude that the woefully inadequate Paisola E-mail
(with nothing more) gives rise to a “cogent” inference that the Company knowingly or
recklessly misrepresented its deferred revenue, especially when compared to the “opposing

inference” to be drawn from the Company’s willingness to promptly report discovered
accounting issues during the Purported Class Period. Id.

The Allegations Concerning Alleged Chargebacks Do Not Give Rise
to an Inference of Scienter

Plaintiff’s attempt to paint a picture of an alleged credit card “chargeback” crisis also
fails because it concerns conduct and circumstances just as likely to be associated with
innocence –– and does not, therefore, give rise to a “strong inference of scienter” as required
by Tellabs. 127 S. Ct. at 2501; Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 116, 56-57, 95, 104, 122. A
“chargeback” occurs after a credit card customer cancels an order made under his or her
credit card number, and the merchant bank must charge back to the merchant account for the
canceled amount.16

This part of Plaintiff’s case is fatally flawed because chargeback

percentages are imposed on the Company by a third-party (i.e., each individual credit card
processing company), and further, there is no allegation by the Plaintiff that the Company has
inaccurately reported these rates in its public filings.
The Second Amended Complaint alleges that when the Company reported results in
its Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2005, it announced that credit card processing
reserves had been raised from 1% to 5%. “At that time, however, Defendants gave no
explanation as to why these rates had been raised a whopping 500% . . . .” Sec. Am. Compl.
¶¶ 43-44. Undisputedly, the second quarter of 2005 is outside of the Purported Class Period.
Therefore, an increase in the chargeback processing reserves prior to the Purported Class

16

See the Company’s Form 10-K, dated March 31, 2006 (the “Fiscal Year 2005 10-K”), which states
that “[t]he Company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions it
invests with. Restricted cash reflects amount retained by credit card merchants as a reserve for returns on credit
card transactions and deposit balances required under letters of credit.” App. Tab. 8 at p. F-7.

Period (without any increase during the Purported Class Period) is not relevant, nor is it
indicative of any “sham” at all.17
In addition, it is ordinary for any company that accepts payment by credit card to
have a credit card processing company agree to hold a certain percentage in reserve to cover
chargebacks. See Fiscal Year 2005 10-K, App. Tab 8. Nowhere does Plaintiff allege with
any specificity what the alleged chargeback percentage should have been. Allegations of
“ordinary conduct” do not support an inference that Defendants acted with fraudulent intent
under Tellabs. 127 S. Ct. at 2502. If ordinary conduct itself created a strong inference of
scienter, then nearly every case would satisfy the “strong inference” standard. But that is not
the law.
Finally, there is no nexus between the shareholders who are bringing this suit and
Defendants’ alleged “abuse of credit collection affiliates.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 57. If the
credit card companies thought that they had been defrauded, they could have brought their
own action –– but not a single one has done so. Alleged fraud against a third party,
especially when such third parties have never claimed fraud, does not give rise to any
inference that Defendants engaged in securities fraud against Plaintiff.
6.

Allegations About The Company’s Zero-Refund Policy Do Not Give
Rise to an Inference of Scienter

Also insufficient are Plaintiff’s allegations that the Company’s Zero-Refund policy
somehow gives rise to a strong inference of scienter. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 50-54, 119.
Nowhere in the Second Amended Complaint’s 175 paragraphs or 67 pages does Plaintiff
actually connect the dots and explain any significance of the allegations concerning the

17

Similarly, the Trefethen E-mail alleged in paragraph 116 of the Second Amended Complaint is
irrelevant, because it refers to the 1% chargeback percentage before it was increased. And by the date of the
Paisola E-mail, the Company had announced the increased chargeback percentage. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 43.

Company’s Zero Refund Policy and its alleged relationship to a violation of the securities
laws.
The Company sells product in the form of transferring knowledge in particular
subject matters. As opposed to a tangible item that one purchases and can return, there is no
way for a student to “return” the knowledge obtained from the Company once he or she has
taken the class. As such, it makes sense that the Company has a Zero Return Policy.18
Otherwise, there would be no way to protect against the unjust enrichment of someone taking
the class, acquiring the knowledge of the lectures, and then requesting a refund, with no way
for the Company to reacquire the information imparted.19 The bare allegation that Plaintiff is
unhappy with the structure of the Company’s refund policy is far too ambiguous to support a
“strong” inference of scienter.
7.

Plaintiff Fails to Allege Scienter Adequately With Respect to Any of
the Individual Defendants.

Unable to make specific allegations demonstrating scienter, Plaintiff tries to slide by
with allegations that the Individual Defendants engaged in isolated stock sales, held senior
management positions, and signed routine corporate filings. Courts consistently have held
that such general allegations are insufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter. In
re Smith Gardner, 214 F. Supp. 2d at 1303 (“[A] strong inference of scienter is not raised
simply because individual defendants held positions of control, were involved in day-to-day
activities, and signed SEC filings.”) (citations omitted); see also Miller v. Dyadic Intern.,
Inc., 2008 WL 5070279, at * 7 (S.D. Fla, Nov. 25, 2008).

18

The Second Amended Complaint also acknowledges that the Zero Refund Policy was not without
exception. “[T]here was a corporate mandate that had been directed to lower management that there would be
NO REFUNDS in any case, for any reason, with few exceptions.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 117 (emphasis added);
see also Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 54 (“[N]o customer could ever get a refund after three days.”) (emphasis added).
19

By analogy, Plaintiff’s allegations would support the argument that a law student who fails the bar
exam has grounds to obtain a refund from a bar exam prep course simply because he or she is unsatisfied with
the results. That is ridiculous.

First, Plaintiff’s allegations that Individual Defendants Kane, Simon, and Whitney
took advantage of the Company’s “inflated” stock price by selling some of their own shares
fails to create an inference of scienter at least as, or more, compelling than any opposing
inference one could draw from the facts alleged. See Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2510; Sec. Am.
Compl. ¶¶ 129, 131, 132. To the extent that Plaintiff relies on stock sales to infer fraudulent
intent, he must allege facts that show that the stock sales were “unusual” or “suspicious,”
which he has not done. Plaintiff has thereby failed to create an inference of scienter stronger
than the more logical inference that Messrs. Kane, Simon and Whitney routinely sold shares
of Company stock (a more plausible opposing inference).
Plaintiff’s allegations concerning stock sales by the Individual Defendants merely
raise issues of motive and opportunity, which the Eleventh Circuit has held insufficient to
create a strong inference of scienter. Bryant, 187 F. 3d at 1285-86. Second, the mere fact
that certain Individual Defendants sold shares of Company stock is not indicative of scienter
unless unusual in scope or timing, neither of which is pled. Hubbard, 2008 WL at *15; In re
Sunterra Corp. Sec. Litig., 199 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1330 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (“Stock sales by
officers do[] not give rise to fraudulent intent unless the sales are unusual or suspicious.”)
(quotations omitted); In re MicroStrategy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 115 F. Supp. 2d 620, 643 (E.D.
Va. 2000) (“‘[P]laintiffs must allege that the trades were made at times and in quantities that
were suspicious enough to support the necessary inference of scienter.’”).20
In determining whether the sale of shares creates an inference of scienter, the courts
look to “unusual or suspicious” stock sales that are “dramatically out of line with prior
trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside
20

The same is true of the allegations concerning the EduTrades Spinoff and Company’s PIPE
transaction. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 133-139. The EduTrades spinoff never occurred, Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 137, so
no one profited from that transaction. The PIPE transaction was done with sophisticated purchasers in an
exempt transaction, so it actually suggests that there was no fraud; otherwise those sophisticated investors
would have “uncovered” it.

information.” In re Vantive Corp. Sec. Litig., 283 F.3d 1079, 1092 (9th Cir. 2002). In
making this determination, the courts look to: “(1) the amount and percentage of shares sold
by insiders; (2) the timing of the sales; and (3) whether the sales were consistent with the
insider’s prior trading history.” In re Pixar Sec. Litig., 450 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1104 (N.D. Ca.
2006); see also In re Silicon Graphics, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 986 (9th Cir. 1999). A
complaint is inadequate where it fails to allege the total stock holdings, the relation of profits
made to total compensation levels, and prior trading history for each individual defendant,
such that the court has no basis to infer unusual trading. In re Burlington Coat Factory, 114
F.3d 1410, 1423 (3d Cir. 1997); In re Home Health Care Corp. of Am., Inc. Sec. Litig., 1999
WL 79057, *16 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 29, 1999).
Here, Plaintiff’s allegations fail to provide even the slightest factual support for the
existence of scienter with respect to the Individual Defendants’ sale of stock. All that
Plaintiff has alleged are the names of some Individual Defendants, the dates that shares were
allegedly sold within the Purported Class Period, the number of shares sold on that date, and
the total dollar amount of each sale. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 132. Glaringly absent from the
Second Amended Complaint is: (1) any information about the total shares held by each
defendant; (2) the trading history for each defendant so this Court can consider whether
trades within the Purported Class Period were normal and routine; or (3) information
indicating the relation of profits allegedly made to defendants’ total compensation levels.
Absent such information, there is no basis to infer scienter.21 In re Sunterra, 199 F. Supp. 2d
at 1330 (granting motion to dismiss securities class action complaint after holding that

Demonstrative of the inadequacy of the allegations, Plaintiff only alleges that during the Class
Period, Defendant Kane “liquidated over $414,000 of his personally-held Whitney common stock” (Sec. Am.
Compl. ¶ 8) and Defendant Simon “liquidated over $911,999 worth of his personally-held Whitney common
stock” (Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 6), and thereby these defendants supposedly took advantage of “the artificial
inflation in the price of Company stock.” Id. Although Kane and Simon are alleged to have sold a certain
amount of stock on a single day during the Purported Class Period, there is no allegation by Plaintiff that this
was inconsistent with either of their trading histories or part of an unusual trading pattern. The same type of
analysis is equally applicable to the allegations against Mr. Whitney.

defendants’ sales of stock were not alleged to be inconsistent with their trading history or
part of an unusual trading pattern); Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., 2000 WL 1140306, *8
(S.D. Fla. July 31, 2000) (granting individual defendants’ motion to dismiss and holding that
“[t]he plaintiffs . . . bear the burden of showing that sales by insiders were in fact unusual or
suspicious in amount and in timing.”).22 Without question, the Second Amended Complaint
fails to allege anything unusual, suspicious or out of line about Messrs. Kane, Simon and
Whitney’s alleged conduct. Accordingly, these allegations must be rejected as indicative of
scienter.
Similarly, Plaintiff alleges, without elaboration, that certain of the Individual
Defendants signed certain of the Company’s SEC filings. E.g., Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 70
(alleging that Whitney, Maturo and Simon “among others” signed the Company’s Form 10-Q
for 3Q:05); ¶ 80 (alleging that Whitney and Simon “signed Sarbanes-Oxley Certifications for
the period ending June 30, 2004,” which is well outside the Class Period); ¶ 96 (alleging that
Whitney and Novas certified the Company’s 1Q:06 Form 10-Q, for the quarter ending March
31, 2006”).23 However, such allegations are insufficient to give rise to a strong inference of
scienter because “it is well-established that ‘[a]llegations that a director or officer signed
public disclosures and/or was involved in the company’s daily operations, standing alone,
will not satisfy the pleading requirements of the PSLRA.’” Cheney, 2000 WL 1140306, *9

22

Also contradictory is that only three of the six Individual Defendants are alleged to have taken
advantage of the Company’s “inflated” stock price by allegedly selling shares of Company stock. Sec. Am.
Compl. ¶ 132. This is inconsistent with alleged fraud, because if there was a “massive” fraud, then all of the
officers would have sold their shares. This did not happen. See San Leandro Emergency Med. Group Profit
Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc., 75 F. 3d 801, 814 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that “the sale of stock by
one company executive does not give rise to a strong inference of the company’s fraudulent intent; the fact that
other defendants did not sell their shares during the relevant class period sufficiently undermines Plaintiff’s
claim regarding motive”); Acito v. IMCERA Group, Inc., 47 F. 3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding that lack of
sales by several defendants “undermines Plaintiff’s claim that defendants delayed notifying the public ‘so that
they could sell their stock at a huge profit.’”).
23

Plaintiff’s only allegations against Novas are that he was the signatory to public disclosures, and
accordingly, the allegations concerning Novas must be dismissed on their face.

Litig., 2007 WL 1068219 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (holding that allegations that defendants signed

Corp., 249 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (D. Utah 2002) (finding that plaintiffs’ conclusory allegations
that Individual Defendants were responsible for the Company’s public filings were
insufficient to create the requisite inference of scienter).
Apparently recognizing that his allegations concerning the Individual Defendants are
deficient, Plaintiff tries to salvage his Second Amended Complaint by claiming that the
Individual Defendants somehow committed securities fraud by virtue of their senior positions
in the Company. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11, 12, 171.24 But these allegations say nothing more
than that the Individual Defendants held management positions at Whitney, and the same
allegations could be cut and pasted indiscriminately into any securities class action complaint
against officers of any corporation. E.g., Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 11 (“Because of the Individual
Defendants positions with the Company, they had access to the adverse undisclosed
information about its business, operations, products . . .”) (emphasis added); ¶ 12 (“The
Individual Defendants, because of their positions of control and authority as officers and/or
directors of the Company, were able to and did control the content of various SEC
filings . . .”) (emphasis added). “[M]ere allegations that defendants held senior management

The few allegations against defendants Simon, Kane and Novas –– which were not even included in
the initial Complaint –– appear to be an afterthought and legally insufficient. Simon’s name, for example,
appears only a handful of times in the 175 paragraph Second Amended Complaint. E.g., Sec. Am. Compl. 6,
70, 71-72, 79- 81, 96. 111, 116-117, 119, 132, 162 . Similarly, the Second Amended Complaint mentions Kane
in only a few paragraphs. Sec. Am. Compl. 8, 116-117, 119, 132,. These few allegations are insufficient to
give rise to a strong inference that these Individual Defendants acted fraudulently, and Plaintiff’s claims against
them should, accordingly, be dismissed.

positions is insufficient to plead scienter.” Fidel v. Rampell, 2005 WL 5587454 (S.D. Fla.
Mar. 29, 2005) (citations omitted).
Plaintiff’s inclusion of the “Post Class Period Developments” similarly does nothing
to save his claims.

First, for every press release and announcement by the Company

referenced in the Post Class Period Development section of the Second Amended Complaint,
Plaintiff fails to mention that trading the days following each announcement the Company’s
stock traded went up, rather than down, as the Second Amended Complaint alludes. App.
Tab 15.

Second, Plaintiff makes no attempt at all to link the indictments of former

employees Linda Woolf and David Gengler or the termination of Richard O’Dor to the
Individual Defendants. See Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 159-164. Even putting aside that these
allegations concern events that occurred outside of the Class Period, cf. In re Scholastic
Corp. Sec. Litig., 252 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 2001) (indicating that courts may only rely on preclass period data and post-class period data if it sheds light on relevant issues), the Post-Class
allegations concern two individuals who are not even named in this action, and subsequently,
are nothing more than a red herring. Further, though the investigations resulted in actions
against two non-defendants, to date, no enforcement actions have been brought against the
Company or any of the Individual Defendants.

Accordingly, these allegations are

insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. Abrams v. Baker Hughes, Inc., 292 F.3d 424
(5th Cir. 2002) (affirming dismissal of securities fraud class action and holding that “[a]
pleading of scienter may not rest on the inference that defendants must have been aware of
the misstatement based on their positions within the company”).25

25

Demonstrative of Plaintiff’s own ambiguity and omissions, there is no allegation that the Willcoxon
Memorandum quoted in ¶ 128 of the Second Amended Complaint was sent to any of the Defendants, as it is
addressed only to “Michael McKenna –– Corporate Legal Counsel.” The Second Amended Complaint fails to
name the other “Senior Management Team” members to whom the e-mail allegedly was sent, and offers no
allegation that it was sent to any of the Defendants.

The Second Amended Complaint Fails To Demonstrate Reliance

It is clear from the face of the Second Amended Complaint and the public trading
data that Plaintiff’s attempt to utilize the fraud-on-the-market presumption to establish
reliance is to no avail. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 155-158. Since the market for the Company’s
shares was not efficient, an essential prerequisite to fraud-on-the-market doctrine, the Second
Amended Complaint should be dismissed for failure to adequately plead reliance.
Reliance upon an alleged misstatement or omission is an essential element of a
Section 10(b) claim. Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 243 (1988). The fraud-on-themarket doctrine can excuse a securities fraud plaintiff from showing actual reliance because
“reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed” when
the alleged misrepresentation or omission has been “disseminated into an impersonal, welldeveloped market for securities.” Id. at 247. The Basic presumption is “based on the
hypothesis that, in an open and developed securities market, the price of a company’s stock is
determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business.”
Id. at 241 (internal quotes omitted). Plaintiffs seeking to invoke the fraud-on-the-market
presumption bear the burden of establishing the efficiency of the market for the shares at
issue. In re Checkers Sec. Litig., 858 F. Supp. 1168, 1177 (M.D. Fla. 1994). As set forth
below, Plaintiff has not met this burden.
Although courts have declined to set forth a bright-line test for market efficiency, five
factors are generally accepted as the hallmarks of an “open and developed securities
market”: (1) a large weekly trading volume; (2) the existence of a significant number of
reports by securities analysts; (3) the existence of market makers and arbitrageurs in the
security; (4) the eligibility of the company to file an S-3 registration statement; and (5) a
history of immediate movement of the stock price caused by unexpected corporate events or
financial releases. See, e.g., Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., 213 F.R.D. 484, 498-500 (S.D.

Fla. 2003); Binder v. Gillespie, 184 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 1999). Taking these factors
into consideration, Plaintiff’s allegations that “the market for [the Company’s] stock was an
efficient market” are insufficient on their face. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 155. Because of this,
Plaintiff’s attempt to establish reliance based on the fraud-on-the-market theory fails.
As an initial matter, Plaintiff’s statement that the Over-The-Counter (“OTC”) market
is “highly efficient” is, at best, a gross overgeneralization. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 155. Shares in
the Company were thinly traded on the OTC market, rather than on an organized exchange,
during the Class Period. Because the market for OTC shares is less well-developed than for
securities listed on formal exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, it has been
recognized that “establishing the ‘fraud-on-the-market’ presumption for the over-the-counter
market is a more difficult task than establishing the presumption for [an organized
exchange].” Griffin v. GK Intelligent Sys., Inc., 196 F.R.D. 298, 301 (S.D. Tex. 2000).
Courts facing the issue have concluded that the OTC market is neither per se efficient nor
inefficient; instead, efficiency must be determined with regard to whether the market for the
shares at issue “processed information concerning the securit[y] in a rapid and accurate
manner.” In re AmeriFirst Sec. Litig., 139 F.R.D. 423, 431 (S.D. Fla. 1991). Courts have
dismissed cases such as this one where the plaintiff did not adequately allege an efficient
market. See In re Surebeam Corp. Sec. Litig., 2005 WL 5036360, *23-24 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 3,
2005) (granting motion to dismiss for failure to adequately plead reliance through the fraudon-the-market theory where complaint merely alleged that “stock traded in an efficient
market” without any particular facts demonstrating efficiency); Turbodyne Technologies, Inc.
Sec. Litig., 2000 WL 33961193, *1-2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 2000) (granting motion to dismiss
due to insufficient allegations of an “efficient market,” finding that “[t]his failure to plead
reliance requires that defendants’ motion to dismiss be granted.”).

Plaintiff’s bald assertion that the Company’s shares were “actively traded” is patently
untrue. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 155. For market efficiency purposes, active trading requires both
a large weekly volume of transactions and a significant “turnover rate,” which is calculated
by dividing the average weekly trading volume by the total number of shares outstanding
during the relevant period. See AmeriFirst, 139 F.R.D. at 431 n.5. Generally, a turnover rate
of two percent or more justifies a “strong presumption” that the market for the security is
efficient, while one percent justifies a “substantial presumption.” In re 2TheMart.com, Inc.
Sec. Litig., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 963 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (emphasis added).26
In the instant case, trading data from the Purported Class Period, of which this Court
may take judicial notice at the motion to dismiss stage,27 reflects an average weekly volume
of 71,024 shares, with a turnover rate of 0.68%, a number well below the 2% necessary to
justify a strong presumption for efficiency. App. Tabs 9-14.28 Indeed, for a substantial
number of days falling within the Purported Class Period, no shares of the Company were
publicly traded.

App. Tab 15.

These figures are hardly the hallmarks of efficiency,

especially when compared to the volumes and turnover rates found to be representative of an
efficient market in other cases involving OTC shares. See, e.g., AmeriFirst, 139 F.R.D. at
431 (average weekly volume of 575,000 shares with a turnover rate of 5.2%); Cammer v.

26

Plaintiff has previously argued that market efficiency cannot be properly addressed at the motion to
dismiss stage. However, courts have consistently been willing to dismiss securities class actions where market
efficiency is not adequately alleged on the face of the complaint. See, e.g., Turbodyne, 2000 WL 33961193 at
*1-2; In re Surebeam, 2005 WL 5036360, at *23-24. As the Second Amended Complaint fails to allege that the
Company's shares trade in an efficient market, dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate.
27

It is well-established that the court may take judicial notice of trading data regarding the shares of a
publicly traded corporation without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See,
e.g., La Grasta v. First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 841 (11th Cir. 2004); Ganino v. Citizens Utils. Co., 228
F.3d 154, 166 n.8 (2d Cir. 2000).
28

According to SEC filings, the Company had 8,704,410 shares of common stock outstanding on
August 10, 2005; 9,304,910 shares on November 4, 2005; 10,559,660 shares on January 6, 2006; 11,025,516
shares on June 22, 2006; 11,025,516 shares on August 11, 2006; and 11,728,159 shares on October 30, 2006.
App. Tabs. 9-14. The average of these figures, 10,391,360, was used to calculate turnover rate. Even under the
lowest of these numbers, the turnover rate was a remarkably low 0.82% during the class period.

Bloom, 711 F. Supp. 1264, 1283 n.30 (D.N.J. 1989) (average weekly volume of 750,000
shares).29
More importantly, the Company’s share price has failed to exhibit a consistent “cause
and effect relationship between unexpected corporate events or financial releases and an
immediate response in the stock price.” Id. at 1287. The timely reaction of a company’s
stock to public information is the very “essence of an efficient market and the foundation for
the fraud on the market theory.” Id. It is apparent from the face of the Second Amended
Complaint and the relevant trading data that the market’s ability to react to unexpected
statements from the Company was spotty at best. To be sure, the Company’s share price
declined after the issuance of the November 21, 2006, and December 15, 2006, press releases
announcing the SEC and USAO investigations. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 140-143; App. Tabs 2
and 3. However, the same cannot be said of the press release issued by the Company on May
15, 2006 and later incorporated in the 8-K filed by the Company on May 19, 2006, which
announced the restatement of financial results, and the December 21, 2006, press release
disclosing the termination of an executive for making unsubstantiated claims about his
trading records. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 161, 89-91, 144; App. Tabs 6, 7, and 17. Rather than
declining, the Company’s share price actually increased on the trading days immediately
following these ostensibly negative disclosures.30 App. Tab 15. The Second Amended
29

It is also illustrative that the Company filed an S-1, rather than S-3, registration statement during the
class period. App. Tab 16. Form S-3 allows established corporations with broadly traded stock to streamline
the disclosure process when registering shares for issuance. Eligibility to complete an S-3 registration statement
aids the efficiency analysis because “the SEC permits registration only on the premise that the stock is already
traded on an open and efficient market, such that further disclosure is unnecessary.” Cheney, 213 F.R.D. at 500
(internal quotes omitted). Issuers without an efficient market who thus are unable to satisfy the eligibility
requirements for the filing of an S-3, such as the Company, must file the more burdensome S-1 registration
statement.
30

In the opposition filed in connection with the previous motion to dismiss, Plaintiff claims that this
statement is “inaccurate” because the Company’s shares closed at $9.65 at the end of trading on May 16, 2006.
Because the press release was issued after the close of trading on May 15, 2006, the market would presumably
have digested the information contained therein by the open of trading on May 16, 2006, especially if the
market for the Company's shares is as “efficient” as Plaintiff claims in the Second Amended Complaint.
Accordingly, the relevant time for judging the impact of the May 15, 2006 press release is the open of trading

Complaint fails to address how the Company’s stock allegedly was traded in an efficient
market in light of these apparently inconsistent facts.
For these reasons, Plaintiff’s claim that he is entitled to utilize the fraud-on-themarket presumption must fail on its face, and the Second Amended Complaint should be
dismissed for failure to adequately plead reliance.
E.

The Second Amended Complaint Fails To Adequately Plead Loss
Causation

Even assuming that Plaintiff can establish reliance –– which he cannot –– the Second
Amended Complaint must nonetheless be dismissed because it fails to sufficiently show
actual economic loss as a result of Defendants’ purported misrepresentations. To make out a
claim under Section 10(b), the PSLRA requires that Plaintiff adequately plead “loss
causation,” which has been defined as “a causal connection between the [material]
misrepresentation and the economic loss.” Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 345
(2005); see also 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)(4).31 Logically speaking, for a share price to decline as
a result of allegedly fraudulent conduct, the fraudulent conduct must first be publicly
disclosed. See Dura, 544 U.S. at 342 (noting that the investor suffers no loss “before the
relevant truth begins to leak out”). Fatal to Plaintiff’s allegations is that the “revelations”
cited do not sufficiently establish a connection between the specific alleged fraudulent

on the following day, and as stated above, the shares in fact increased $0.05 from the close on May 15, 2006 to
the open on May 16, 2006. See infra pp. 42-43 for further discussion of the 8-K and press release.
31

The Eleventh Circuit also has discussed the loss causation requirement. In Robbins v. Koger
Properties, Inc., 116 F.3d 1441, 1447 (11th Cir. 1997), the court stated “[t]o prove loss causation, a plaintiff
must show that the untruth was in some reasonably direct, or proximate, way responsible for his loss. If the
investment decision is induced by misstatements or omissions that are material and that were relied on by the
claimant, but are not the proximate reason for his pecuniary loss, recovery . . . is not permitted.” (internal quotes
and citations omitted).

activity and a drop in stock prices. See In re TECO Energy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2006 WL
845161, *4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2006).
The critical events relied upon by Plaintiff in the Second Amended Complaint are the
issuance of two press releases announcing investigations by the SEC and the USAO on
November 21, 2006, and December 15, 2006, respectively.

Those are the only

announcements that caused a significant price drop. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 140-143; App.
Tabs 2 and 3. However, there is an insurmountable disconnect between those drops and
Plaintiff’s asserted fraud theories.

The two press releases make no mention at all of

Plaintiff’s “theories” of alleged fraud relating to disclosure related to Russ Whitney’s
background, credit card reserves, deferred revenue, or items that were restated.
Fear on the part of investors simply is not compensable under the securities laws. As
the Supreme Court has declared in no uncertain terms, private securities fraud actions are not
intended “to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect
them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.” Dura, 544 U.S.
at 345. As such, the allegation that the losses somehow resulted from misrepresentations or
omissions on the part of Defendants — rather than more plausible explanations — must fail.
The most reasonable explanation for the drop in price is not the disclosure of previously
hidden misconduct — which the releases did not accomplish — but investors’ fear of
litigation or the unknown consequences of regulatory inquiry. See Teacher’s Ret. Sys. of La.
v. Schoenfeld, 477 F.3d 162, 187-88 (4th Cir. 2007) (finding that where the relevant
disclosure itself did not reveal previous representations to have been fraudulent, the drop in
share price more logically occurred because the market feared a lawsuit).

Plaintiff summarily claims that he “acquired Whitney common stock during the Class
Period at artificially inflated prices and [was] damaged thereby” and that “all purchasers of
Whitney common stock during the Class Period suffered similar injury through their
purchase of Whitney common stock at artificially inflated prices. . . .” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶
157, 156. However, as the Supreme Court observed in Dura, an “‘artificially inflated price’
is not itself a relevant economic loss.” Dura, 544 U.S. at 347; see also Teacher’s Ret. Sys.,
477 F.3d at 186 (“[A] plaintiff does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . by
simply alleging that the plaintiff purchased defendant’s stock at an ‘artificially inflated
purchase price’ and thereby sustained damages.”).
For that reason, this Court has found that “[e]stablishing a connection between a drop
in stock price and the disclosure of the ‘truth’ about a defendant’s previous misstatement or
omission is essential in pleading loss causation . . . .” In re TECO Energy, 2006 WL 845161,
at *2; see also In re Paincare Holdings, 2007 WL 1229703, at *8 (“[T]o sufficiently plead
loss causation, a plaintiff must allege a disclosure or revelation of truth about a defendant’s
prior misstatement or omission that is in some way connected with a stock price drop.”); see
also In re Alamosa Holdings, Inc., 382 F. Supp. 2d 832, 862 (N.D. Tex. 2005) (“Because
none of the . . . alleged misrepresentations . . . were the subject of a corrective disclosure
followed by a drop in stock price, there can be no finding that such misrepresentations or
omissions caused Plaintiffs’ losses.”). Thus, in TECO, the court dismissed the complaint for
failure to plead loss causation when “the information contained in the purported revelations
[did] not identify, reveal or correct any prior misstatement, omission, or improper accounting
practice by Defendants.” 2006 WL 845161, at *4.

A number of courts have required that loss causation be pled under the heightened
pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 9(b). In Teacher’s Ret. Sys., 477 F.3d at 186, the
court found that a “[s]trong case can be made that because loss causation is among the
‘circumstances constituting fraud’ for which Rule 9(b) demands particularity, loss causation
should be pleaded with particularity.” Based on this observation and the public policy
concerns outlined in Dura, the court in Teacher’s Retirement concluded that loss causation
must be pled “with sufficient specificity to enable the court to evaluate whether the necessary
causal link exists.” Id; see also In re First Union Corp Sec Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
5083 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 20, 2006); but see Edward J. Goodman Life Income Trust v. Jabil
Circuit, Inc., 2009 WL 179669, *21 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 26, 2009).
Plaintiff fails to allege loss causation because the press releases announcing the SEC
and USAO investigations do not contain factual information that reveals any of the fraud
alleged by Plaintiff in the Second Amended Complaint. Under similar facts, the Eastern
District of Washington dismissed a complaint, holding that the announcement of a regulatory
investigation is insufficient, on its own, to plead loss causation. See Avista Corp. Sec. Litig.
415 F. Supp. 2d 1214 (E.D. Wash., 2005). In Avista, the court determined that “Plaintiffs fail
to allege loss causation because the two [disclosures announcing an investigation] do not
contain factual information that reveals any of these misrepresentations [alleged in the
complaint] or reveals any fraud by [Plaintiff.]” Id. at 1220.
As in TECO, the “critical disclosures” in the instant case involve no identification,
revelation, or correction of any prior alleged misstatement, omission, or improper accounting
practice. The November 21, 2006 press release, which Plaintiff claims to have “shocked and
alarmed” investors, revealed only that the SEC was investigating “the efficacy and trading

success of EduTrades, the Company’s stock market education programs” and “the
Company’s prior acquisitions of certain other entities.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 140; App. Tab 2.
Indeed, the relevant portion of the release, which spans only two sentences, makes no
mention of the alleged misrepresentations about Mr. Whitney’s background, the alleged
“spike” in chargebacks and disputed charges, the alleged accounting irregularities, or the
other allegedly fraudulent activities described in the Second Amended Complaint. See Sec.
Am. Compl. ¶ 2; see also Barr v. Matria Healthcare, Inc., 324 F. Supp. 2d 1369, 1380 (N.D.
Ga. 2004) (dismissing securities class action for failure to adequately plead loss causation).
The mere fact that a regulatory body decided to conduct a non-public inquiry into “efficacy
and trading success” and “acquisition[s]” can hardly be read as a revelation of the “true
facts” surrounding the wide array of alleged fraudulent activities enumerated in the Second
Amended Complaint, regardless of how “shocked and alarmed” Plaintiff fancies the
investing public to have been.
The same is true of the December 15, 2006 press release “revealing that the Company
had received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the United States Attorney for the Eastern District
of Virginia and [the Company] had been notified that [it] was being investigated for its
marketing activities.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 142. Again, Plaintiff fails to point to any portion
of the press release actually identifying, revealing, or disclosing any misconduct. App. Tab
3. Plaintiff’s attempt to equate the disclosure of an investigation with actual misconduct
woefully falls short of what is required to establish loss causation — especially when the
investigations in question have resulted in the revelation of no new factual information to the
public or any enforcement actions against the Defendants despite the passage of over two
years .

Plaintiff also ignores the Fiscal Year 2005 10-K, dated March 31, 2006, which was
filed by the Company during the heart of the Purported Class Period. Contrary to Plaintiff’s
allegations of its “shock and alarm” after the November and December press releases, the
Fiscal Year 2005 10-K disclosed several inquiries or investigations in the states of Florida,
Kansas, Wisconsin and Illinois concerning the business operations and advertising efforts
App. Tab. 8 at pp. 8-9.32

that Plaintiff now alleges were “a sham.”

Following the

Company’s filing of the Fiscal Year 2005 10-K that disclosed these inquiries, the Company’s
stock price rose steadily for five weeks. See App. Tab 15. This is yet another example of the
Company’s candor with the investing public, and demonstrative of Plaintiff’s inability to
adequately plead loss causation.
Finally, Plaintiff glosses over the press release issued by the Company on May 15,
2006, and the 8-K filed by the Company on May 19, 2006, which announced that the
Company would restate its financial results to reflect changes in its revenue recognition
policy. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89-91; App. Tabs 6 and 7. Since the filing represents the only
instance of what may properly be characterized as the identification, revelation, or correction
of “a prior misstatement, omission, or improper accounting practice,” TECO, 2006 WL
845161, at *4, during the Purported Class Period, the investing public’s reaction to the
disclosure is illuminating. The trading day immediately following the issuance of the press
release resulted not in “shock and alarm” on the part of investors, but a slight increase in the

As set forth in the Fiscal Year 2005 10-K, “The Florida investigation was commenced in 2005 and
stems from consumer complaints made to the state from years 2002-2005. According to information provided
to us by the state, there were approximately 50 complaints from across the country made to the Attorney
General’s telephone hotline over the past four years.” App. Tab 8. at p. 8.

Company’s share price, which opened $0.05 higher. See App. Tab 15.33 This conclusively
establishes the lack of any loss causation with respect to the alleged deferred revenue
violations.34
F.

The Court Cannot Impose 20(a) Liability Because There Is No 10(b)
Liability

In addition to seeking to impose direct liability on Defendants under Rule 10b-5,
Plaintiff seeks to impose secondary “control person” liability on them under Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 171-174. Because Plaintiff fails to adequately plead
a primary violation under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, their Section 20(a) “controlling
persons” claims must also be dismissed. See Hubbard v. BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., 2008
WL 5250271 at *8 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2008) (“Because the Court finds that Plaintiff has not

33

Plaintiff mentions two additional “revelations” of alleged misconduct by the Company and Mr.
Whitney, which were greeted by similar market non-reactions. First, the Company announced the “termination
of employment of [several executives]” and stated that one of these employees, Rance Masheck, “was
terminated due to the fact that his trading records do not substantiate claims which he made, and which the
Company broadcasted publicly, regarding his trading success.” Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 160-161. Second, Plaintiff
quotes the East Bay Express, a “local news website”, which purportedly questions statements and potential
omissions relating directly to Russ Whitney himself. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 29-31. As an initial matter, Plaintiff
concedes that these disclosures fall outside of the class period, making their relevancy questionable at best. In
any event, Plaintiff’s claims of “shock and alarm” on the part of the investing public are overstated, given that
share prices remained largely unchanged or in some cases increased during the relevant periods. For example,
after the December 21, 2006, press release disclosing Mr. Masheck’s termination, the Company’s share price
rose from $4.00 to $4.15 and steadily increased from there to end the following week at $5.35. App. Tab 15.
34

In the opposition filed in connection with the previous motion to dismiss, Plaintiff cited several
cases for the proposition that an “explicit disclosure” of the alleged misrepresentation is not required to satisfy
the loss causation element. However, these cases involved fact patterns where an initial partial disclosure of the
“true facts” was followed by subsequent disclosures providing further details about the alleged
misrepresentations. See, e.g., In re Bradley Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., 421 F. Supp. 2d 822, 828 (D.N.J. 2006)
(finding loss causation to be established where press release announcing SEC investigation “partially disclosed
what the alleged misrepresentations had concealed from the market,” and the alleged misrepresentations were
“later confirmed” by a subsequent restatement of earnings); In re Parmalat Sec. Litig., 375 F. Supp. 2d 278, 307
(S.D.N.Y. 2005) (holding that loss causation was adequately alleged based upon an announcement that the
company was “unable to pay bonds as they became due” where “the true extent of the fraud was [later] revealed
to the public [after the class period]”). In the instant case, by contrast, the only alleged corrective disclosures
are the brief press releases announcing the bare fact of the SEC and USAO investigations. These press releases
make no mention of the wide-ranging misrepresentations alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff
is not able to point to any additional public disclosures that later revealed the “true facts” about the alleged
misrepresentations set forth in the Second Amended Complaint. Most notably, it has now been over two years
since the SEC and USAO investigations were announced, and no enforcement action has been taken against the
Company.

Plaintiff Should Not Be Given Leave to Amend

The Second Amended Complaint is now Plaintiff’s third bite at the apple over a two
year period. At this point, the action should be dismissed with prejudice. See Edward J.
Goodman Life Income Trust, 2009 WL 179669, *34; PR Diamonds, Inc. v. Chandler, 364
F.3d 671, 700 (6th Cir. 2004) (“[W]e think it is correct to interpret the PSLRA as restricting
the ability of plaintiffs to amend their complaint” because “the purpose of the PSLRA would
be frustrated if district courts were required to allow repeated amendments to complaints
filed under the PSLRA.”) (citations and quotations omitted); Bay v. Palmisano, No. 01-0949,
2002 WL 31415713, *11 (E.D. La. Oct. 24, 2002) (denying request for leave to amend first
consolidated complaint and dismissing with prejudice).
As justice does not require district courts to waste their time on hopeless cases, leave
to amend may be denied if a proposed amendment fails to correct the deficiencies in the
original complaint or otherwise fails to state a claim. See Mizzaro v. Home Depot, 544 F.3d
at 1255, citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (describing “futility” as a basis for
denying leave); see also In re Splash Tech. Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig., 160 F. Supp. 2d 1059,
1073-75 (N.D. Cal. 2001) (granting dismissal prejudice where plaintiffs failed to correct
“puzzle pleading” defect by second amended complaint).

Defendants are entitled to a

dismissal with prejudice because any further amendment would be futile and would subject
Defendants to additional unwarranted delay, expense and prejudice. See Jag Media Holdings
