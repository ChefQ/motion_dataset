Lead Plaintiff Dr. Arnold Friedman (“Plaintiff”) respectfully submits his opposition
to the Company and the Individual Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Lead Plaintiff’s
opposition to Defendant Ehrhardt Keefe Steiner & Hottman P.C.’s motion to dismiss is
incorporated herein by reference.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Defendants criticize Plaintiff’s Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint
(“Complaint”) for being “virtually identical in substance to Plaintiff’s first amended
complaint” and complain that “this new ‘version’ just includes section headings and a
reorganization of identical same content.” Br. at 2. This argument is puzzling as the
previous complaint was stricken on form, not substance. 11/17/08 Order p. 3-5. Indeed,
Defendants’ previous motions to dismiss were denied. Id. In accordance with this Court’s
opinion that the “very long and very detailed” complaint did not sufficiently “connect the
relevant facts to the elements of each claim,” (Id.) Plaintiff filed an amended and completely
restructured Complaint – not to correct any deficiency on substance – but to provide clarity
for the Court to allow it to consider the merits of this case.
Nevertheless, Defendants claim that “[e]ven the most thorough reading of the
Complaint leaves one wondering exactly what the Company has done that amounts to a
violation of Rule 10b-5.” Br. at 3. Defendants go so far as to claim the Complaint alleges “a
tremendous financial success based on a growing platform of satisfied students . . . [T]he
Company’s students, unlike Plaintiff, are satisfied, and this Court should not be gulled into
believing otherwise.” Br. at 9. This contention is outrageous in light of Plaintiff’s allegations
that the Company’s purported success was based on pushing overpriced and worthless

1

products to customers so dissatisfied that the Company faced numerous consumer
complaints, is the subject of multiple litigations, and had to adopt secret return policies and
improperly record revenue to convey a positive financial condition to investors.
In truth, this Complaint presents a compelling case of securities fraud – precisely the
type of fraud the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”) were intended to protect investors
against. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants1 promoted in Whitney Information Network, Inc.’s
(“Whitney” or the “Company”) public filings and press releases during the Class Period the
Company’s educational programs as providing such valuable information that the fees
charged by the Company for its products and services often exceeded tens of thousands of
dollars – the cost equivalent of a four-year college education. E.g. ¶35. The purported high
quality of the Company’s products and services was also reported by Defendants to be
driving Whitney’s revenue and profit growth and, as a result, revenue was reported to have
increased from $41.3 million in 2001 to $224.7 million by the end of 2006.
In truth however, at the same time that Defendants were issuing these materially false
and misleading statements, Defendants knew but failed to disclose their products were
unconscionably overpriced and essentially worthless.

Whitney’s classes were often

dedicated at least 50% to up-selling more classes or other extraneous services. Teachers who
claimed to have become financially successful from using Whitney techniques for stock
trading had actually earned their money from pushing Whitney courses. Also known by

Defendants include the Company, various of its officers and/or directors during the Class Period – Russell A.
Whitney (“Russ Whitney”), Ronald Simon, Alfred Novas, John Kane, Nicholas Maturo, and Rance Masheck -as well as the Company’s outside auditor, Ehrhardt Keefe Steiner & Hottman PC.

Defendants but undisclosed to investors, Defendants’ manipulation of returns and abuse of
credit collection affiliates and customers had an immediate impact on the veracity and
completeness of the Company’s financial reports, in violation of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and SEC rules.

Defendants presented an inaccurate

portrayal of the financial health of the Company; artificially inflated reported Deferred
Revenues by representing that cash had been collected for classes in which students were
actually demanding repayment for the same funds; and manipulated revenue recognition,
immediately recognizing material amounts of “Coaching” fees which should have been
recorded as deferred revenues.
The Complaint includes the following highly-detailed indicia, among other details,
that collectively support a strong inference that Defendants acted with scienter – knowledge
and/or severe recklessness – when making the alleged false and misleading statements:
• an August 18, 2005 email memorandum from a Company Regional Manager to
Defendants Kane, Maturo, and Simon, and Russ Whitney, Jr. alerting Defendants no later
than the very first week of the Class Period to gross and shocking abuses of the Company
refund policy, manipulation of deferred revenues, credit chargebacks and abuse of
merchant credit accounts, and artificial inflation of revenue figures (¶¶ 117-125);
• an August 1, 2005 conference call, during which Company managers contemplated
ideas to deceive customers and deprive them of their ability to receive chargebacks (¶¶
51,124);
• a July 28, 2005 email from a Regional Manager warning that credit processors were
“greatly concerned” with certain accounts where students sought chargebacks (¶¶ 116118, 126);
• a July 28, 2005 email from the Director of Company Merchant Accounts reflecting
concerns of credit processors and noting “AMEX has already expressed concern
directly”(¶ ¶116-118);
• violations of GAAP, including intentional misclassification of “coaching” services as
immediate revenue when revenue should have been reported only when services were

later provided, up to 2.5 years in the future; representing cash – already demanded for
return – belonged to the Company (¶¶111-114);
• the Company’s Restatement of financials for 2001-2005 as a result of inflated
deferred revenues due to Defendants’ manipulation of return policies (¶26);
• suspiciously-timed departures of no fewer than six Company executives (including
the Audit Committee Chair) immediately after shocking announcements including that
the Company had received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the United States Attorney for
the Eastern District of Virginia (“USAO”) notifying the Company that it was being
investigated; a New York Times exposé on the Company; a Grand Jury investigation
revealing that the trading records of Rance Masheck, Vice President, Sales and Marketing
of EduTrades, Inc. (a subsidiary of the Company), did not substantiate claims he made in
the press; or the termination of Richard O'Dor, Director, Corporate Communications, for
a misstatement to the press without the knowledge of, or authorization by, the Company,
regarding the reason for the termination of Rance Masheck (¶¶142,161);
• allegations from a number of former Company employees that (i) the vast majority of
students were not expected to profit from any of the classes offered by Whitney and that
at least half of any class was nothing more than a “sales pitch” to up-sell more seminars
and products; (ii) speakers were not teachers, but rather sales persons, who
misrepresented their prior stock trading or real estate success, and whose primary source
of income was generated through selling classes for Whitney; and (iii) the proposed $33
million EduTrades IPO never occurred, and its SEC Registration was withdrawn in
December 2006, because information in the Registration was not verifiable. ¶¶ 41, 137.
In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants had motive and opportunity to commit
fraud, as the Individual Defendants collectively made millions in insider profits as a result of
the fraudulent scheme; Defendants sold $13.5 million in Company stock to PIPE (Private
Investment in Public Equity) investors and registered over 33 million more EduTrades shares
– to be sold to public investors in a later aborted spin-off; and Defendants and other insiders
benefited from a special dividend. ¶¶131-132.
Finally, as the media was drawn to the Company’s share price collapse, more adverse
reports were published, including the disclosure of the true fact that Russ Whitney had
fabricated his resume to create the false impression that he had built his personal wealth in

4

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Page 7 of 46

the real estate market, rather than from selling purported “educational” materials with little or
no actual value to others, that he had nearly gone bankrupt at a time he claimed to be rich,
and that he also had an extensive record of criminal activity and irresponsible actions, that
were affirmatively concealed from investors while Russ Whitney’s “story” and “success”
were touted as the driving force behind the Company. ¶¶29-31. These allegations support a
strong inference of scienter.
Defendants’ other technical arguments for dismissal also fail. Defendants argue that
Plaintiff has failed to plead loss causation. To plead loss causation, a plaintiff must allege a
disclosure or revelation of truth about a defendant's prior misstatement or omission that is in
some way connected with a stock price drop. Dura Pharm., Inc., 544 U.S. 336, 1631-32,
1634 (U.S. 2005). Plaintiff readily met these requirements here, as discussed in detail below,
including allegations of a one day decline of almost 36% at the end of the Class Period. ¶141.
The Complaint also adequately alleges the efficiency of the market for shares of Whitney.
¶155.
Defendants next argue that Plaintiff has not adequately pleaded reliance in
accordance with the fraud-on-the-market doctrine. Under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine,
“reliance is presumed when the statements at issue become public.”

Stoneridge Inv.

Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 761, 769 (2008). “[R]eliance may be
presumed where securities are traded on the open market, subject to the defendant proving
that the misrepresentations were not material or that the plaintiff's decision to purchase was
or would have been unaffected if he had known the true facts.” Lipton v. Documation, Inc.,
734 F.2d 740, 747-48 (11th Cir. 1984).

Defendants’ reliance argument is particularly

5

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 8 of 46

puzzling as Defendants fail to point to a single opinion supporting the decision of this factintensive issue at the motion to dismiss stage, nor can they.

This issue is entirely

inappropriate for resolution on this motion. See, e.g., Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., 213
F.R.D. 484, 499 (S.D. Fla. 2003).
Next, despite Defendants’ protestations to the contrary, the Complaint alleges—in
accordance with the particularity required by the PSLRA and Rule 9(b)—the specific
statements that were materially false and misleading and the detailed reasons each statement
was materially false when made.
For these and the additional reasons discussed in detail herein below, Defendants’
motion to dismiss should be denied in full.
ARGUMENT
The court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and
accept the factual allegations as true. SEC v. ESM Group, Inc., 835 F.2d 270, 272 (11th Cir.
1988). A complaint must merely allege facts sufficient “to raise a right to relief above the
speculative level.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-65 (2007).
II.

Plaintiff’s Section 10(b) Claim Is Adequately Pleaded
A. The Legal Standard for Scienter
Scienter allegations of a 10(b) claim will survive a motion to dismiss “if a reasonable

person would deem the inference cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference
one could draw from the facts alleged.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. 308, 2510 (U.S. 2007).2 Thus, if
the inferences properly drawn from the facts are in “equipoise,” (id. at 2514), the allegations
2

In this Circuit, to adequately plead the scienter, allegations that defendants were severely reckless suffice.
Ziemba v. Cascade Intern, Inc., 256 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir. 2001).

6

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Page 9 of 46

will survive a 12(b)(6) motion. In Tellabs, the Court reiterated the established principle that
when “faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a §10(b) action, courts must, as with any
motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all
factual allegations in the complaint as true.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 2510 (emphasis added).
“[C]ourts must consider the complaint in its entirety” and determine “whether all of
the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether
any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.” Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at
2509. Even “vague or ambiguous” allegations must be considered, as “the court's job is not to
scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to assess all the allegations holistically.” Id. at
2511.
This “holistic” approach, id. at 2511, no longer permits courts to ignore any factual
allegations that could support scienter simply because, standing alone, that fact would not
suffice to meet the requisite strong inference of scienter; rather each such fact must be given
some weight, and all facts are weighed together to determine whether the totality of the facts
alleged gives rise to a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiff’s scienter allegations, discussed
in detail below, readily meet this standard.
B. The Paisola E-mails Support a Strong Inference of Scienter
On August 18, 2005, at the outset of the Class Period, Whitney then-Regional
Manager Robert Paisola (“Paisola”) sent an email memorandum to senior officers and
directors of the Company, including Defendants Simon, Kane, and Maturo and to Russ
Whitney, Jr. which recited a series of control violations and Federal Securities Law and
Sarbanes-Oxley violations, as well as violations of the Company’s own Internal Code of

7

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 10 of 46

Conduct and Fair Business Practices. ¶118.
The red flag email raised numerous serious issues with senior management following
the completion of a site visitation audit. ¶117. For example, the email stated, in part:
[I] looked at all of the relevant data to come up with some plausible reason why our
chargeback rates in certain divisions were so out of control. … Going forward, we
[Paisola and Will Trefethen] reviewed some of the cases and together determined
that it was essential to gain the attention of senior management of the magnitude of
this problem. ¶119.
*
*
*
Based on this “line in the sand” directive [or “zero refund policy”], the respective
merchant accounts have been greatly affected. This is evidenced by a spreadsheet
that was received last week, analyzing the 2003-2004 and 2005 periods, which
clearly show the exposure that the Merchant Banks are facing as a result of our
relationship with their institutions …. The new goal of the management team should
be to meet in the middle … without continuing to put our valuable merchant
accounts at risk… ¶120.
* *
*
As of the date of this report, it is evident that the merchant banks have not been made
aware of the one year period threshold that is taken and needed to complete a transaction
internally, because of the promises of the one year of coaching and the one year
disclaimer to resolve the camps. The fact that we as an organization do not disclose
this to our merchant account processors is substantial…. ¶123.
*
*
*
The bottom line problem with this is that we are choosing to defer revenue on camps
and mentoring ONLY. Coaching is not a deferred item, as all of the revenue is
immediately booked. This is not proper. ¶124. (Emphasis added).
The email alerted senior officers that the Company’s abuse of its refund policy was eroding
the Company’s merchant credit card accounts, fundamentally undermining operations, and
reaching crisis levels by the beginning of Class Period. ¶120. Further, Paisola pointed out
issues with revenue recognition (which violated GAAP) that the Company concealed from its
merchant account processors as well as Defendants’ manipulation of the Company’s
“deferred income” in another important violation of accounting conventions. ¶124.
The Company hired Paisola in July 2005, presumably after careful evaluation of his

8

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 11 of 46

background and character and prior to involving Paisola in high-level legal compliance issues
and related responsibilities. Nevertheless, Defendants now try to discount the very employee
they hired on the basis of alleged conduct that occurred before he was hired.3 There was no
finding of defamation against Paisola on the civil suit cited by Defendants (id.), and the
trustworthiness of Paisola’s memorandum regarding these issues – as well as the credibility
and trustworthiness of Defendants – is an issue for trial.
Ironically, Defendants query: “How did the Company respond to Paisola’s email?”
Br. at 22. The answer is clear: Defendants fired Paisola within 72 hours of his detailed
memorandum listing myriad red flags that he sent to senior management. ¶125. Defendants
also ask: “To what information did Paisola have access?” Br. at 22. In a complaint filed by
the Company in 2005, it admitted giving Paisola “access to significant amounts of
confidential and proprietary information regarding WEG [Whitney Education Group]
including company policies and procedures, and documents regarding WEG’s finance and
operations.” See Declaration of Kim E. Miller (“Miller Decl.”) at Ex. H, ¶16. The
confidential corporate documents in Paisola’s possession included: “internal and confidential
company memoranda prepared exclusively for the use of Executive Management; a copy of
WEG’s internal policies and procedures for customer refunds; copies of confidential email
communications with regarding [sic] WEG’s financial information, customer refund issues,
and WEG’s relationships with various credit card providers; copies of student refund letters;
and a 2004 spreadsheet showing company revenue derived from its different brands.” Id.
3

In light of Defendant Russ Whitney’s history as a convicted felon, which facts were concealed from investors
throughout the Class Period while his “rags to riches” story was touted, it is nothing short of remarkable that
Defendants have the temerity to argue that “Paisola himself is a convicted felon with a history of making false
allegations, and his allegations therefore do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.” Br. at 21.

9

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 12 of 46

Defendants cannot now deny that Paisola was in possession of this information.
Defendants argue that the opposing inference to their knowing and/or reckless
behavior is that they were willing to “promptly report” Whitney’s accounting issues. Br. at
24, 25. In reality, Defendants fired Paisola immediately after he reported such issues and
continued to conceal the truth until more than a year later in November 2006. ¶¶125, 148.4
C. The Trefethen Email
On July 28, 2005, Will Trefethen (“Trefethen”), then Director of the Company’s
Merchant Account Program, warned in an email that:
We have done a great job keeping refunds down; however, chargeback
percentages have risen noticeably. . . . We must do something. Inaction will
certainly lead us to another TMF listing, making it very difficult to open
new merchant accounts. AMEX has already expressed concern directly with
a letter...
Trefethen suggested tactics such as using a merchant account with a better chargeback
percentage to hide the high level of sales lost to chargebacks. ¶118.
In assessing scienter, the Court should consider “the level of detail provided by the
confidential sources, the corroborative nature of the other facts alleged (including from other
sources), the coherence and plausibility of the allegations, the number of sources, the
reliability of the sources, and similar indicia.” See, e.g., In Re Cabletron Sys., 311 F.3d 11,
29-30 (1st Cir. 2002). Trefethen’s email is consistent with, and further bolsters and
corroborates, Paisola’s emails, supporting a strong inference of scienter.

4

In Malin v. IVAX Corp., 17 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (S.D. Fla. 1998), (Br. at 22), plaintiffs pleaded no specific details
but rather “attempt[ed] to allege scienter simply by arguing in a conclusory fashion that the failure to disclose
the shelf-stock adjustment practice was so outrageous that it had to have been done recklessly or knowingly.”
Malin, 17 F. Supp 2d at 1360.

Page 13 of 46

D. The OSHA Complaint and Anne Willcoxon Memorandum
Subsequent to his retaliatory termination, Paisola filed a complaint with the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). ¶126. That complaint, which was
not disclosed by Defendants, highlighted “issues… that could prove extremely problematic
for the organization,” including “duplicate and fabricated contracts,” “coerce[ing] the
students into paying for” undelivered goods or services, lying to merchant card providers,
and “Corporate Financial Data Manipulation on SEC Filings.” ¶¶126-128.
Further, the OSHA complaint references a formal memorandum from Anne
Willcoxon, Manger of Regulatory Compliance, to the Senior Management Team. ¶128. The
memorandum, another red-flag, stated, in part:
In our telesales division we continue to see exaggerated claims such as you can make
thousands of dollars in the first six months; you have your coach for a year but the
program is not explained accurately, students think their coach is available 24/7
immediately for any deal they may be in the bank officer’s office for. They are not
contacted immediately by their coach, they requested information be sent to them
before purchase but was never done, asked their credit cards not be charged until
they have spoken with their spouse, etc.
Some complaints have no validity while others should be taken very seriously. Having
been in sales myself, I know the pressure to meet sales goals is enormous but perhaps
it is at the expense of our integrity. ¶128 (emphasis added).
Anne Willcoxon’s memorandum further corroborates Paisola’s emails, supporting the
veracity of his reports and the strong inference of scienter created by the emails.
E. The Company’s Return and Chargeback Schemes
Whitney had a secret zero-refund policy designed to obfuscate and thwart customer
refund and chargeback requests. E.g. ¶¶ 23, 120. Much of the Whitney enrollment process
was designed to reduce students’ ability to later obtain a refund through a credit card

11

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 14 of 46

processor or bank. ¶50. The Company never disclosed this policy to its investors. See, e.g.,
¶23. GAAP violations combined with omissions regarding a company’s return policy in
public statements are “more than sufficient to support a fact-finder’s inference that [the
defendants] intended to deceive, manipulate, or defraud investors.” Chalverus v.
Pegasystems, Inc., 59 F. Supp. 2d 226, 235 (D. Mass 1999)(regarding omissions about a
company’s return policy).
The Company’s chargeback policy also supports a strong inference of scienter. On an
August 1, 2005 internal conference call, Company employees proposed ideas to deceive
customers and deprive them of their ability to receive chargebacks by pressuring them to
access a website that would require they click a button manifesting ironclad consent to accept
services that prohibit refunds or chargebacks. ¶52. The Company faced terminated merchant
accounts and chargebacks from its failure to provide any service to paying customers. ¶46.
Defendants knew that they were at fault that the chargebacks were happening as a result of its
“damage control.” ¶51. On the conference call, Trefethan stated that “the consumer’s getting
a little more aggressive with us… it’s our fault that the chargebacks are happening.” Paisola
replied that the rise in chargebacks resulting from the consumers’ increasing aggression was
a result of the Company drawing a “line in the sand” to which another Whitney employee
(Joe Gnapp) responded: “Right. What we’re doing is just damage control.” ¶51. The rise in
chargebacks, which hurt the Company’s financials and relationships with merchant
processors, was a direct result of the Defendants’ manipulation of refunds. ¶¶47-48.
F. The Company’s Accounting Fraud, GAAP Violations, and Subsequent
Restatement
The Complaint alleges that Defendants inflated the reporting of deferred revenues by

12

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 15 of 46

representing that cash already demanded for return by students belonged to the Company
¶49. The Complaint further alleges that Defendants manipulated revenue recognition by
immediately recognizing material amounts of coaching fees as revenue despite the fact that
they should have been deferred revenues. ¶¶57, 74.
The Company arbitrarily designated “Coaching” services as an immediate revenue item,
while “Mentoring” or other similar services – necessarily provided at a later date – were
classified as Deferred Revenues. This intentional misclassification of “Coaching” as
immediate revenue enabled Defendants to improperly realize tens of millions of dollars in
additional revenues that rightly should have been reported only when such Coaching
services were supplied. ¶74.
Defendants were aware of these revenue recognition problems no later than August
18, 2005 when Paisola emailed various Individual Defendants, among others, that the
Company’s revenue recognition was “not proper.” ¶124. It wasn’t until May 15, 2006,
however, that Defendants published a release announcing that Whitney would be forced to
restate its financial results for the years and quarterly periods of 2004 and 2005. ¶89. This
initial disclosure itself was materially false and misleading because, although Defendants
failed to reveal at the time, this restatement was actually evidence of the radically defective
internal controls within the Company, not a non-material event that should have been
disregarded as the Company indicated. Further, Defendants were aware or were severely
reckless in disregarding that this restatement still did not render the Company in compliance
with GAAP and SEC rules. ¶91. On June 28, 2006, the Company announced that it would
change its revenue recognition practices going back to 2000 and that the Company’s
restatement would cover the financials from 2003 through 2005. ¶¶100-101. However, on
November 13, 2006, the Company again announced the need for a restatement and
ultimately expanded the restatement to cover the financials from 2001 through 2005. ¶109.

“[C]ourts have held that allegations of GAAP violations, coupled with ignoring red
flags or warning signs of improprieties, can be sufficient to state a claim of securities fraud.”
In re Smith Gardner Sec. Litig., 214 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1302 (S.D. Fla. 2002). “The issuance
of a restatement may also contribute to the establishment of scienter. Where the number, size,
timing, nature, frequency, and context of the GAAP violations or restatement are taken into
account, the balance of the inferences to be drawn from such allegations may shift
significantly in favor of scienter.” In re AFC Enters., Inc. Sec. Litig., 348 F. Supp. 2d at
1372.
“[V]iolations of GAAP plus other averments of fraud … create a strong inference of
scienter.” Reina v. Tropical Sportswear Int'l, No. 8:03-cv-1958-T-23TGW, 2005 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 6129 (M.D. Fla. April 4, 2005). Further, the allegations of false and misleading
financial reporting and GAAP violations are sufficient to allege a strong inference of scienter
as to the CFOs. See id. (citing In re Sunbeam Sec. Litig., 89 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1340 (S.D.
Fla. 1999).
G. The Concealed Felonious Background of Russ Whitney
While the Company publicly touted Russ Whitney’s phony “rags to riches” tale,
including that he had “amassed a fortune of $4.7 million in real estate” by the age of 25, in
truth, Whitney was a convicted felon with less than $100,000 in highly leveraged property on
his 25th birthday. ¶31. In fact, just a few years after he purportedly had amassed this $4.7
million real estate fortune, Russ Whitney had a $1.2 million civil judgment against him for a
hit and run action for which he paid only about one third of the judgment after threatening to
file for bankruptcy. ¶¶20, 31. The Company website called Russ Whitney “a hard-driving,

14

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 17 of 46

intense achiever and leader who never slows his tireless pace…. [who] is the picture and
embodiment of success of the American Dream.” ¶29. In truth, as Defendants knew or were
severely reckless in not knowing, Russ Whitney was an ex-con with a history of financial
problems and the owner of a failing Company based on a sham product. Russ Whitney was
pleading guilty and serving time in prison in 1974, not working to build his first real estate
fortune as the Company claimed. ¶31. These allegations support a strong inference of
scienter.
H. The Suspiciously-Timed Departures of Numerous Company Executives
The Complaint alleges suspiciously-timed terminations and resignations of numerous
Company executives and the retaliatory termination of a high-level manager. Such
resignations and terminations of senior corporate officers can be indicative of scienter. See,
e.g., In re Adaptive Broadband Sec. Litig., No. C 01-1092 SC, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5887,
at *42-43 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2002) (the resignation of several corporate officers “as [the
company]'s financials were being restated and as [the company] was conducting its own
internal investigation … add[s] one more piece to the scienter puzzle"); See, e.g., Druskin v.
Answerthink, Inc., 299 F. Supp. 2d 1307, 1321 (S.D. Fla. 2004)(finding “no allegations
establishing scienter by virtue of ‘red flags’ such as a management shakeup.”).
On December 19, 2006, the Company announced the departures of Defendant
Maturo, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Defendant Masheck, VP Sales and
Marketing of a Whitney spin-off. ¶160. These terminations occurred just two business days
after the Company revealed that it received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the USAO notifying
the Company that it was being investigated for marketing activities. ¶¶142, 161. Richard

15

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 18 of 46

O’Dor, Director of Corporate Communications, was terminated on December 21, 2006. ¶161.
This termination occurred just days following the Grand Jury Subpoena and subsequent
investigation which revealed that O’Dor’s trading records did not substantiate claims he
made in the press. ¶161. On March 23, 2007, following a New York Times exposé on the
Company, Defendants announced the resignations of two of Whitney’s directors, Stephen
Cootley and Anthony Petrelli. Next, just as two large investors wrote to Whitney’s directors
to express concerns with the Company on July 2, 2007, Audit Committee Chairman Chester
Schwartz resigned from the Board of Directors.
Finally, Regional Manager Paisola was fired within 72 hours after circulating an
email memorandum raising numerous red flags to the Company’s top brass. ¶¶118, 125. This
series of no fewer than six high-level departures at suspicious times, along with an ill-timed
firing of a person who exposed corporate wrongdoing, supports a strong inference of
scienter.
I. Defendants’ Opportunity and Motive
The Individual Defendants’ motive and opportunity to inflate the price of Whitney
stock gives rise to a strong inference of scienter. ¶¶129-139. Although neither motive nor
opportunity is required under Tellabs, such allegations greatly bolster and support a strong
inference of scienter. See In re AFC Enterprises, Inc., Sec. Litig., 348 F. Supp. 2d 1363, 1373
(N.D. Ga. 2004) (evidence of motive and opportunity may contribute to an implication of
intent to defraud). Defendants were motivated to materially misrepresent to the SEC and
investors the true financial condition of the Company because their scheme enabled insiders
to sell millions in Company stock.

Page 19 of 46

In connection with the IPO, Defendant Russ Whitney grossed at least $5.635 million
in illegal insider trading proceeds. ¶138. After the Company’s stock was artificially inflated
following the Company’s false and misleading 2005 Form 10-K, Defendant Simon sold over
100,000 shares of Whitney stock to gross $911,999.00; Defendant Russ Whitney liquidated
another 100,000 Whitney shares to gross $950,000.00; and Defendant Kane liquidated
40,000 shares to reap gross proceeds of at least $414,000.00. ¶132. Red flags like insider
trading provide support for a finding of scienter. Schultz, 488 F. Supp. 2d at 1225.
Defendants’ scheme also enabled insiders to collect a special dividend. ¶¶105-106,
129. This large $1.00 per share cash dividend was made public accompanying an
announcement that the “special cash dividend reflected the confidence by our Board in our
ability to continue to grow our business, increase free cash flow and build shareholder
value.” ¶105. Most of this dividend, however, was reaped by the insiders of the Company.
¶129. Defendants were also able to sell $13.5 M in Whitney stock to PIPE investors prior to
the registration of those shares and thereafter able to register for sale $13.5 million in
Whitney shares, that were sold by PIPE Purchasers. ¶131. They were also able to register
over $33.0 million EduTrades shares – to be sold to more public investors in a later-aborted
spin-off transaction. ¶¶94, 129.
J. Defendants’ Sarbanes-Oxley Certifications
Sarbanes-Oxley certifications, signed by Defendants Whitney and Novas, are also
“probative of scienter” where, as here, “the person[s] signing the certification [were] severely
reckless in certifying the accuracy of the financial statements." Garfield v. NDC Health
Corp., 466 F.3d 1255, 1266 (11th Cir. 2006); See, e.g., ¶99. “This requirement is satisfied if

17

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 20 of 46

the person signing the certification had reason to know, or should have suspected, due to the
presence of glaring accounting irregularities or other “red flags,” that the financial statements
contained material misstatements or omissions. Id. at 1266.
Such “red flags” alleged here include tips, letters, documents, memoranda, and
conversations that should have alerted Defendants to the fraud, glaring accounting
irregularities, a government investigation, allegations of insider trading, the magnitude of the
improperly recognized revenue, whether the violations related to major balance sheet items
based on contracts of great financial importance, and whether the GAAP violation violates
the corporation's internal policies. Ziemba, 256 F.3d at 1210 (providing examples of red
flags); Schultz v. Applica, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 1219, 1225 (S.D. Fla. 2007). These
allegations support a strong inference of scienter.
K. Statements of Whitney’s Former Employees
In accordance with Tellabs, all of Plaintiff’s allegations must be considered, including
statements made by former employees of the Company. “[A]nonymous sources may be used
to sustain complaints under the PSLRA so long as the sources are described with sufficient
particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source
would possess the information alleged.” See, e.g., Marrari v. Medical Staffing Network
Holdings, Inc., 395 F. Supp. 2d 1169, 1188 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (following Second, Third, Fifth
and Tenth Circuits).
Defendants cite the Eleventh Circuit’s standard in Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., 544
F.3d 1230 (11th Cir. 2008) for confidential witnesses. Br. at 19-20. In Mizzaro, the Eleventh
Circuit expressly declined to adopt a rule requiring a securities fraud complaint to name

18

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 21 of 46

confidential sources, “so long as the complaint unambiguously provides in a cognizable and
detailed way the basis of the whistleblower's knowledge.” Id. (citations omitted). Though
defendants in Mizzaro raised the possibility that a confidential informant may be less credible
than one who is willing to put his name behind his accusations, the Court declined to put
significant weight on that consideration. Id.
In accordance with those requirements, Plaintiff alleges specific details about
confidential witnesses, former employees who worked at the Company during the Class
Period, whose statements are corroborated by each other and other documentary evidence
and events. Confidential Witnesses (“CW”) #1 and #3 were members of the Technical
Support Team and CW #2 was a member of the Sales Team, each during the Class Period.
¶¶39, 41, 137. Defendants’ attempt to discount the roles of these witnesses is unavailing. CW
#1 spoke directly with customers who were misinformed about contracts, put under pressure
to sign, and charged for data usage despite never having downloaded the software. ¶39. CW
#2’s role as a seminar sales team member also puts him/her in a position to attest to the
nature of the success stemming from those seminars and Whitney’s failing business model.
¶41. CW #3, a member of the technical support team, attested that Whitney’s EduTrades
SEC Registration was withdrawn because company data did not “match up.” ¶137. These
statements certainly corroborate the other allegations in the Complaint and support a strong
inference of scienter. 5

5

Defendants also argue, in a nearly 450 word footnote, that the Confidential Witnesses’ statements do not
contribute to the strong inference of scienter. Br. at 20 n. 13. For example, Defendants argue that “The
testimony from a tech-support employee regarding “a few calls” expressing opinions on a product, intended for
a customer service representative does not indicate anything out of the ordinary. . . .” Id. (emphasis in
original). There is no legal standard that requires that something be “out of the ordinary.” Plaintiff has not
alleged that a tech-support employee’s receipt of customer service calls is particularly unusual or indicative of

19

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 22 of 46

Defendants’ reliance on Higginbotham v. Baxter Int'l, Inc., 495 F.3d 753, 757 (7th
Cir. 2007) is misplaced. Higginbotham is a misinterpretation of Tellabs and the court’s
decision to discount “allegations from confidential witnesses” was incorrect. Higginbotham,
495 F.3d at 757. The only court in the Seventh Circuit to specifically address the use of
confidential witnesses since Higginbotham permitted the use of confidential witnesses to
corroborate information without requiring their naming. See Schleicher v. Wendt, 2007 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 67924, at *38 (S.D. Ind. September 12, 2007). Further, courts in the Fifth,
Ninth, and Second Circuits have expressly declined to follow the approach in Higginbotham.
E.g., In Central Laborers' Pension Fund v. Integrated Electrical Services Inc., 497 F.3d 546
(5th Cir. 2007), Rosenbaum Capital, LLC v. McNulty, 549 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1193 (N.D. Cal.
2008), City of Brockton Ret. Sys. v. Shaw Group, Inc., 540 F. Supp. 2d 464, 2008 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 30579 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).
L. Post-Class Period Statements
Contrary to Defendants’ contention (Br. at 32), the post-class period allegations shed
light on scienter, falsity, and materiality. Courts rely on information outside of the class
period for numerous reasons, including to “shed light on what a defendant should have
known during the class period.” In Re Scholastic Corp. Sec. Litig., 252 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir.
2001). (citations omitted). In addition, “[a]ny information that sheds light on whether class

fraud. However, the Complaint does allege that Confidential #1 received complaints that customers were
misinformed about what they signed; that customers were put under pressure to sign a complicated, detailed
contract quickly; and that customers that were charged for data usage when they hadn’t even downloaded
software. ¶39. These statements contribute to a strong inference of scienter in that they corroborate Plaintiff’s
allegations that the Company’s product was unconscionably overpriced and pushed upon customers who
inevitably demanded refunds or attempted chargebacks ¶37, Confidential Witness #1 and #5’s statements that
they witnessed high pressure sales tactics ¶40, 42, that the Company was forced to institute a zero refunds
policy ¶23, and that the Company faced increasing chargebacks ¶¶24-25.

20

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

period statements were false or materially misleading is relevant.” Id.
These post-class period statements include the departure of Defendants Maturo and
Masheck ¶125, the revelation that Whitney terminated Defendant Masheck for making false
statements about his prior trading success as well as the efficacy of the Whitney stock trading
system ¶126, that Whitney had undergone significant executive reorganization ¶127, that the
USAO indicted Whitney employees, in part for making false representations in order to sell
Whitney products while relying on the Company’s fraudulent marketing efforts, and that the
SEC filed civil fraud charges against them ¶¶ 128, 129. As discussed in detail above, the
termination of high level executives and corporate restructuring are indicia of scienter.
Further, claims by the USAO and SEC that certain Whitney employees were dishonest and
deceived customers in relying on the Company’s fraudulent marketing efforts contribute to a
strong inference that Defendants knew or acted with reckless disregard when making false
and misleading statements about the Company’s financial condition and business prospects.
M. The January 2009 Restatement
On January 15, 2009 the Company submitted its amended annual report (10-K/A) for
the year that ended December 31, 2006.6 According to the 10-K/A, after the SEC began
conducting a formal investigation into the Company’s compliance with securities laws and
the commencement of a grand jury investigation into the Company’s marketing activities by
the USAO, Whitney’s Board conducted its own internal investigation. After two years of

6

“Courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when
ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, . . . matters of which a court may take judicial notice.”
Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S. Ct. 2499, 2511 (U.S. 2007). “[I]n the context of securities
fraud, ‘SEC documents [may be treated] as public records capable of being judicially noticed at the motion to
dismiss stage.’ Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., 466 F.3d 1255, 1260 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Bryant v. Avado
Brands, Inc., 187 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir. 1999)).

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

investigation, the Company was forced to implement recommendations based on the
investigation’s findings.
Upon these recommendations, Defendants Whitney, Simon, Kane and Novas were
terminated from their executive/officer positions. Evidencing the Company’s complete lack
of internal controls and noncompliance with GAAP and SEC reporting rules, the restatement
also corrected errors relating to “disclosures of related party transactions, the method and
disclosure of certain acquisitions, depreciable lives of intangible assets and property, plant,
and equipment,” and additional changes with a more minimal effect on the Company’s cash
flows, liquidity, and/or financial position.
The Company executives concluded that “[Whitney’s] disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. . . [and] identified material weaknesses in [Whitney’s] internal
controls.”

The material weaknesses included, inter alia, the “Lack of knowledgeable

personnel in accounting and financial reporting areas, a lack of formalized processes and
procedures over key areas in the accounting and reporting functions, and inadequate
supervision and review over the financial reporting function.” Further, certain “intangible
assets and property plant and equipment were assigned incorrect depreciable lives,”
“Inventory related to Star Trader® had not been recorded as impaired at December 31,
2006,” and “Various accounts payable invoices were recorded in the incorrect period.”
The Company’s 10-K/A and numerous other public filings also reported that, in
addition to the SEC and USAO investigations, numerous judicially noticeable complaints and
investigations have been filed against Whitney which demonstrate customer dissatisfaction,

the Company’s lack of internal controls, and/or contribute to a strong inference of scienter.
These actions include:
•

The State of Florida commenced an investigation in 2005 stemming from
consumer complaints made between 2002 and 2005.

•

An additional inquiry by the Florida Attorney General’s Office on July 6, 2005
about complaints related to transactions between students and Gulfstream
Development Group – a company in which Defendant Whitney has an interest.
The complaints resulted in the commencement of a lawsuit naming Defendants
Whitney and Kane and Whitney Education Group.

•

The Indiana Attorney General filed a lawsuit in March 2005 for the Company’s
failure to comply with certain registration requirements.

•

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection
subpoenaed Whitney in August 2005 regarding information about advertising and
student testimonials.

•

The Kansas Attorney General subpoenaed Whitney in February 2006 regarding
information about advertising and student testimonials.

•

A derivative complaint was filed on March 8, 2007 against Whitney and
Defendants Whitney, Maturo, Simon in the Middle District of Florida alleging
Defendants violated fiduciary duties and securities laws.

•

On March 22, 2007 a complaint was filed against Defendants Whitney, Kane and
Whitney Education Group in Florida state court alleging breach of fiduciary
duties, constructive and common law fraud, and other violations.

•

On January 11, 2007 Whitney Canada and Whitney Information Network
received notice of an motion for authorization to instate a class action in Canada,
requested for all persons who have made various real estate investments at the
alleged inducement of Whitney and related entities.

As discussed in further detail above, high-level terminations, restatements, investigations,
and legal actions contribute to a strong inference of scienter. See also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor
Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S. Ct. 2499, 2509 (2007); In re AFC Enters., Inc. Sec. Litig., 348
F. Supp. 2d at 1372; In re Syncor Int'l Corp. Sec. Litig., 327 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1162 (C.D.

Cal. 2004).
N. The Complaint Adequately Alleges Scienter with Respect to Each Individual
Defendants Kane, Maturo, and Simon, Russ Whitney, Jr. were recipients of the
Paisola August 18, 2005 email discussed herein above. This red flag email from Paisola – so
alarming to the Company that it resulted in the rapid firing of Paisola – surely would have
been discussed at the highest levels, and therefore by all of the Individual Defendants. In
light of Defendant Russ Whitney’s control over his Company (see, e.g., ¶¶5, 138), the idea
that he was not promptly informed of the email and involved in the decision to fire Paisola
within 72 hours is difficult, if not impossible, to believe. Regardless, even if Defendant Russ
Whitney did not know, he was severely reckless in not knowing about such an explosive
email involving allegations of serious red flags at the Company involving its refunds,
chargebacks, overall Company policy, and compliance with the law and internal policies.
Under both Tellabs and the law of the Eleventh Circuit, Plaintiff may aggregate facts
to imply scienter as to each defendant. Phillips v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 374 F.3d 1015,
1017 (11th Cir. 2004). Defendants cite Fidel v. Rampell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45321, at
*15 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 29, 2005) for the proposition that “[m]ere allegations that Defendants
held senior management positions is insufficient to plead scienter.” Br. at. 31-32. This case
does not apply here. The Complaint does not turn on “mere” allegations of senior
management positions. Rather, the Complaint pleads with particularity that the Individual
Defendants were aware of, or at least reckless disregarded, the Company’s false public
statements before the first such statement was made – via, inter alia, documentation sent
directly to these individual in the first week of the Class Period discussing the fraud itself.

24

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 27 of 46

These highly specific, detailed allegations are further bolstered by the fact that each
of the Individual Defendants held a controlling position during the Class Period. Defendant
Whitney was Chairman and CEO, Defendant Simon was Executive Vice President and
Acting CFO, Defendant Novas was CFO, Defendant Kane was Executive VP of Operations,
Defendant Maturo was President and Chief Operating Officer, Defendant Masheck was VP
Sales and Marketing of a Whitney spin-off. ¶¶5-10. The Complaint asserts facts to support
the allegation that each possessed actual knowledge of the falsity of statements issued by
Whitney. Defendants Kane, Maturo, and Simon, and rwjr@russwhitney.com (presumably
Russ Whitney, Jr.), were recipients of the Paisola email. ¶21. The Complaint alleges
violations of GAAP in financial reports prepared and/or signed by each of the Individual
Defendants – including violations requiring a restatement of financials for five years. ¶¶109110. Where defendants control and approve the issuance of public statements during the class
period, have access to the company’s financial information, issue allegedly material false and
misleading press releases, and have GAAP violations that resulted in an overstatement of
earnings – there is a strong inference of scienter as to those individuals. See, e.g., Rehm v.
Eagle Fin. Corp., 954 F. Supp. 1246 (N.D. Ill 1997). These facts, when taken as a whole,
give rise to a strong inference of scienter for each Individual Defendant.
II. Plaintiff Has Adequately Pleaded Loss Causation
Plaintiff has adequately alleged loss causation in accordance with the Supreme
Court’s decision in Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005) and its progeny,
and in accordance with Rule 8 notice pleading which governs loss causation. See, e.g., In re
Immucor Inc. Sec. Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72335, *59-60 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 4,

25

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 28 of 46

2006)(“allegations of loss causation should be evaluated under the notice pleading standard
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules”). As a preliminary matter, loss causation is a fact-based inquiry
that is generally “not proper to resolve on a motion to dismiss.” In re Sears, Roebuck & Co.
ERISA Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3241, *19 (N.D. Ill Mar. 3, 2004); In re PSS World
Medical, Inc. Sec. Litig., 250 F. Supp. 2d 1335, 1358, 1351 (M.D. Fla. 2002).
In Dura, the Supreme Court held that to plead loss causation a plaintiff must allege
“the traditional elements of causation and loss.” Id. at 347. The Supreme Court found that a
complaint failed to allege loss causation where it failed “to claim that… share price fell
significantly after the truth became known.” Id. In short, the only requirement in pleading
loss causation is “to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal
connection that the plaintiff has in mind.” Immucor, at *59. To sufficiently plead loss
causation, a plaintiff must allege a disclosure or revelation of truth about a defendant's prior
misstatement or omission that is in some way connected with a stock price drop, even if that
connection may be made in a short and plain statement. Dura Pharm., Inc., 125 S. Ct. at
1631-32, 1634. Plaintiff readily met these requirements here.7
On November 21, 2006, Defendants published the first of two corrective disclosures,
a release revealing that the SEC had begun an investigation into the Company. According to
7

Rule 8(a) applies to loss causation. In re Coca-Cola Enters. Inc. Sec. Litig., 510 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1203 (N.D.
Ga. 2007), In re Teco Energy, Inc. Sec. Litig., Case No. 8:04-CV-1948-T-27EAJ , 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
73833 at *18-19 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 10, 2006) (citing Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346 (2005))
Defendants also argue that, despite the plain requirements of Dura, loss causation must be pleaded in
accordance with Rule 9(b). Br. at 40. In doing so, Defendants cite two cases in other Circuits, neither of which
holds that Rule 9(b) applies to the loss causation element of a 10(b) claim. In Teacher’s Ret. Sys, 477 F.3d 184,
the court merely held, in accordance with Dura, that “simply alleging that the plaintiff purchased defendant’s
stock at an ‘artificially inflated purchase price’ and thereby sustained damages” is not sufficient. As discussed
above, Plaintiff has met all the requirements of pleading loss causation, including the critical piece not present
in the complaint in Teacher’s, namely: the allegation of the causal connection to the stock drop. In In re First
Union Corp. Sec. Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5083 (W.D.N.C. January 20, 2006), after the announcements in
First Union, in fact, the stock price rose.

the release, the SEC was investigating the Company to determine whether the Company had
“complied with securities laws in connection with (i) the efficacy or trading success of the
Company’s stockmarket education programs, and, (ii) the Company’s acquisition of
certain other companies.” ¶140. (emphasis added). Defendants attempt to cast this as
somehow unrelated to the fraud alleged by mischaracterizing the release and excluding from
the selected quotation in their motion the most critical part of the release which questions
“whether the Company has complied with securities laws.” Br. at 40-41 (Emphasis added.)
Defendants’ alleged violations of securities laws are, of course, the precise subject matter of
the Complaint, and the fact that immediately following this press release the Company’s
stock fell to $5.25 per share, a one day decline of almost 36 % (¶141), is material; investors’
realization that the Company was under investigation for failure to comply with federal
securities laws caused stock prices to plummet.
The Complaint lays out in detail the fraud allegations relating to EduTrades, the
Company’s stock trading education unit for which the Company came under investigation by
the SEC. See e.g. ¶¶141-143. Central to the fraud perpetrated by Defendants was the effort to
legitimize their business to create a positive financial outlook for the Company so that the
IPO registration of EduTrades, which was expected to net the Company more than $30
million, (¶¶133-13), could go forward. Information revealed to the public that the SEC was
investigating the efficacy and trading success of EduTrades in connection with violation of
securities laws was the direct cause of the subsequent 36% drop in stock prices, and is linked
to the overall fraudulent scheme of the company.
In In re Bradley Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., 421 F. Supp. 2d 822 (D.N.J. 2006), the SEC

27

was conducting “an informal inquiry relating to the Company to determine whether there
have been violations of the federal securities laws.” Id. at 825. The defendants in Bradley
Pharms., like the Defendants here, argued that disclosure of an SEC investigation was not a
corrective disclosure because did not relate to plaintiff’s allegations and was a non-specific
inquiry. In holding that loss causation was adequately pleaded, the court found that the
defendants’ “rigid and dogmatic” (id. at 828) interpretation of Dura was unfounded. “In
Dura, the Supreme Court only suggested that the plaintiffs needed to have alleged in some
fashion that ‘the truth became known’ before ‘the share price fell.’” Id., citing Dura, 125 S.
Ct. at 1634.
Defendants also argue that the market’s fear of a lawsuit caused stock prices to drop,
proclaiming that “[f]ear on the part of investors simply is not compensable under the
securities laws.” Br. at 38. However, the “true cause” of the loss is not at issue here. That is a
matter for the finder of fact. See, e.g., In re Openwave Sys. Sec. Litig., 2007 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 80558, 42-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). Plaintiff has alleged that the announcement of the
SEC investigation alerted the market to the true, concealed adverse facts and caused the stock
prices to plummet: the SEC investigation had been initiated expressly to investigate whether
the securities laws had been violated, which investigation ties in directly to Plaintiff’s
securities fraud claims, including the running of and purported success of the EduTrades
program.
On December 15, 2006, the last day of the Class Period, after the market closed, the
Company issued the second corrective disclosure, a press release revealing that the Company
had received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the USAO and had been notified that the

28

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 31 of 46

Company was being investigated for its marketing activities. ¶142. On the next trading day,
December 18, 2006, shares of the Company dropped below $3.25 per share in response to the
December 15, 2006, press release. ¶143. The “marketing activities” for which the Company
was under investigation relate directly to the allegations in the Complaint. The Company’s
portrayal of itself and its practices and how the Company sold its product (its improper
recognition of revenue) are central to the Complaint. Plaintiff’s allegations about fraudulent
chargeback and refund policies are directly related to marketing issues.
Defendants argue that neither of the revelatory disclosures (of the SEC and USAO
investigations) was relevant to the allegations made in the Complaint.8 Defendants cite In re
TECO Energy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18101 (M.D. Fla. March 30, 2006),
for the proposition that Plaintiff has failed to establish a sufficient connection between the
“specific alleged fraudulent activity and a drop in stock prices.” Br. at 37-38. TECO does not
apply. In that case, plaintiffs relied “in large part… on analysts' reports that they allege
revealed Defendants' fraud.” In re TECO, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18101 at *8. Furthermore,
in TECO there had been a mid-class-period disclosure which undermined loss causation, and
the court found that there was nothing in the analysts’ reports which revealed fraudulent
behavior: “Plaintiffs do not connect any information disclosed in the market to any
misstatement or omission by Defendants” Id. at *15. The court found that the reports which
plaintiffs in TECO claimed were revelatory of fraud simply indicated that “analysts were
pessimistic regarding TECO's future.” Id. at *19.

8

Defendants go so far as to argue that only the Company’s restatement of financials during the Class Period
may be “properly be characterized” as a corrective disclosure. Br. at 42, citing TECO (distinguished in text).
This position is baseless and contradicted by Dura.

Courts have repeatedly rejected a central contention made by Defendants here; that to
establish loss causation, plaintiff must show a stock drop following an explicit disclosure,
e.g., a confession that a fraud in all its permutations has occurred.9 Here, Plaintiff has alleged
in detail the fraudulent scheme that caused inflated stock prices, disclosure of that fraud, and
resulting drastic decline in stock price. For these reasons, Plaintiff has adequately pleaded
loss causation.10
III. Plaintiff Has Adequately Alleged Reliance
Plaintiff has adequately pleaded reliance in accordance with the fraud-on-the-market
doctrine. Defendants’ “market inefficiency” arguments are premature as factual inquiries are
not appropriate for a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., 213 F.R.D.
484, 499 (S.D. Fla. 2003); Oscar Private Equity Invs. v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., 487 F.3d
261, 266 (5th Cir. 2007).
In Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988), the Supreme Court established that
reliance for a Section 10(b) claim may be shown through the fraud-on-the-market doctrine,
whereby “reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be
presumed” when the defendants’ misrepresentations or omissions have been “disseminated
into an impersonal, well-developed market for securities.” Basic, 485 U.S. at 247. To

See, e.g., Bristol-Meyers Squibb Sec. Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18448, *56 (D.N.J. Aug. 17,
2006)(rejecting defendants’ contention “that a plaintiff must show that the loss was caused by a corrective
disclosure that mirrors, with precision, the alleged fraud” and noting that “this theory of loss causation is
flawed…it does not follow from the precedent cited, or any precedent of which the Court is aware”); In re
Bradley Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., 421 F. Supp. 2d 822, 828 (D.N.J. 2006)(rejecting defendants’ argument that
disclosure of informal SEC inquiry could not be “corrective” of prior misrepresentation because it did not
specifically mention the subject of the misrepresentation”); See also, In re Immune Response Sec. Litig., 375 F.
Supp. 2d 1014, 1025; Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 572 Pension Fund v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 411 F. Supp. 2d 1172,
1176-77 (N.D. Cal. 2005); In re Parmalat Sec. Litig., 375 F. Supp. 2d 278, 305-07 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).
11
Defendants’ citation to the pre-Dura decision of Robbins v. Koger Properties, Inc., 116 F.3d 1441 (11th Cir.
1997), is misplaced. See Br. at n. 31. Robbins is a summary judgment decision; Defendants take a quote from
Robbins that addresses ultimate proof of loss causation rather than how to plead loss causation.

determine whether a market is “efficient” for purposes of a reliance analysis [at the proper
later stage], courts turn to the five factors addressed in Cammer v. Bloom, 711 F. Supp. 1264
(D.N.J. 1989).
The Cammer factors are: (1) the stock's average trading volume; (2) the number of
securities analysts that followed and reported on the stock; (3) the presence of market makers
and arbitrageurs; (4) the company's eligibility to file a Form S-3 Registration Statement; and
(5) a cause-and-effect relationship, over time, between unexpected corporate events or
financial releases and an immediate response in stock price. In re Xcelera.com Sec. Litig.,
430 F.3d 503, 511 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Cammer). More recently, use of the internet has
also become a barometer of market efficiency. See, e.g., In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec.
Litig., 241 F. Supp. 2d 281, 376-377 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)(“Certain technological advances –
especially the rise of the Internet – ensure that information permeates the market faster than
ever before. The increased ability of the market to quickly assimilate information from a
wider array of sources tips the balance more heavily in favor of applying the efficient market
hypothesis in these cases.”) During the Class Period, Defendants were also covered by
journalists, whose articles were posted on the Internet.
The Complaint adequately alleges the efficiency of the market for shares of Whitney.
¶155 (market for stock was efficient because: stock listed and actively traded on OTC, a
highly efficient automated market; Company filed periodic reports with SEC and OTC11;
regular dissemination of press releases on national circuits of major newswire service and
11

Courts have found that in analyzing whether a market is efficient, where the stock is traded is not the crucial
issue; a market which meets the Cammer factors is efficient, wherever traded. See, e.g., Binder v. Gillespie, 184
F.3d 1059, 1064 (9th Cir. 1999); Hoexter v. Simmons, 140 F.R.D. 416, 418 (D. Ariz. 1991); Hurley v. Federal
Deposit Ins. Corp., 719 F. Supp. 27, 32 (D. Mass. 1989).

other public disclosures; stock followed by several securities analysts; stock regularly
followed by investors on the internet; Company used websites to promote itself to broader
audience; price reacted quickly to unexpected news events); ¶156 (Whitney securities
promptly digested current information regarding Whitney from all publicly available sources
and reflected such information in Whitney stock price).
Defendants cite In re Surebeam Corp. Sec. Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26951 (S.D.
Cal. 2004), Br. at 34, which granted a motion to dismiss where the complaint merely alleged
that “stock traded in an efficient market” without any particular facts demonstrating
efficiency. In that case, however, the court specifically noted that “none of the Cammer
factors [we]re included in the Complaint.” In the case at bar, Plaintiff alleged that the
Cammer factors were present for the market in the Company’s stock. ¶¶ 155-158. Defendants
also cite In re Turbodyne Techs. Sec. Litig., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25738 (C.D. Cal. Mar.
13, 2002), Br. at 34, for the proposition that “failure to plead reliance requires that
defendants' motion to dismiss be granted.” Id. at *4. In Turbodyne, however, plaintiffs
adequately pleaded only two of the five Cammer factors. Cases, including In re Turbodyne
(2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25738 at *4), and In re 2TheMart.com Sec. Litig., 114 F. Supp. 2d
955, 964 (C.D. Cal. 2000), cited by Defendants (at 35), indicate that it is not necessary for a
plaintiff to ultimately demonstrate [prove] the presence of all five Cammer factors.
Though the factual issues of the Company’s trading volume and turnover rate are in
dispute, the average weekly trading volume of the Company for the Class Period was
approximately 71,000 shares. See Miller Decl. Ex. A-C. Most importantly, the market rapidly
absorbed new information about the Company. For instance, on December 13, 2005, the

32

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 35 of 46

Company announced a $13.5 million private placement of common stock and warrants. The
following trading day, December 14, 2005, Whitney stock closed at $7.90, up from $6.75 at
close-of-day on December 13. Miller Decl. at Ex. A. On November 14, 2006, the Company
was notified by the SEC that the Commission was conducting a private investigation to
determine whether the Company had complied with securities laws. The following trading
day, November 15, 2006, Whitney stock closed down at $5.65, down from $8.20 at close-ofday on November 14. Miller Decl. at Ex. A. On December 15, 2006, the Company
announced that it had received a subpoena from a grand jury convened by the USAO in
connection with an investigation into certain of the Company’s marketing activities. The
following trading day, December 18, 2006, Whitney stock closed at $3.50, down from $4.70
at close-of-day on December 15. Miller Decl. at Ex. A.
While these factual issues are not ripe for exploration at the motion to dismiss phase,
they provide premature evidentiary support to support Plaintiff’s adequate allegations the
market for Whitney stock was readily able to assimilate and promptly react to unexpected
news, both positive and negative, issued by the Company. The Company also reported in its
10-K for Fiscal Year 2001 that Michael Kirby, a registered representative of Spencer
Edwards, Inc., was a market maker in the Company's common stock. Miller Decl. at Ex. G.
Defendants’ incomplete, factually-laden and conclusory analysis of the trading
volume (a key rubric in considering efficiency under the Cammer analysis) is illustrative of
why further consideration of market efficiency is inappropriate at this time without
discovery. Defendants state that “trading data from the Purported Class Period, of which this
Court may take judicial notice at the motion to dismiss stage, reflects an average weekly

33

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 36 of 46

volume of 71,024 shares, with a turnover rate of 0.68%. . . .” Br. at 35
Defendants further state that “active trading requires both a large weekly volume of
transactions and a significant ‘turnover rate.’” Br. at 35. The Central District of California
case that Defendants rely upon goes on to say that “each factor need not be alleged in order
to give rise to the inference that the stock was traded in an efficient market.” In re
2TheMart.com Sec. Litig., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 964 (C.D.Cal. 2000). The other case
Defendants rely on to bolster the importance of turnover is In re Amerifirst Sec. Litigation,
139 F.R.D. 423, 431 (S.D.Fl. 1991), in which the court merely pointed out that plaintiffs had
established a significant turnover rate; the court did not hold that turnover rate is a critical
rubric for market efficiency.
Defendants claim to find the turnover rate by “dividing the average weekly trading
volume by the total number of shares outstanding during the relevant period.” Br. at 35.
However, upon calculating the average weekly trading volume of Company shares during the
Class Period, Plaintiff arrives at possible volumes of 71,178 shares, 70,849 shares, or 71,484
shares. Miller Decl. at ¶¶ 4-6. Yet Defendants come up with none of these three possible
numbers but rather with an average trading volume of 71,024. Br. at 35. There is no
explanation of how Defendants arrived at this number nor why the number differs from the
volumes arrived at from the publicly-available information about trade volume. The different
results suggest that Defendants are operating from a different set of trade data than Plaintiff.
Resolution of this discrepancy will have to wait for Plaintiff to have an opportunity for
discovery, another reason this issue is untimely.
Further, there is no reason to accept Defendants’ arrived-at “turnover rate” of .68%.

34

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Page 37 of 46

Defendants have indicated that the number they are using for TSO is 10,391,360. Br. at 35.
Without discovery, the only information available to Plaintiff about TSO is from the
Company’s quarterly and year-end filings with the SEC. Miller Decl. at ¶7.12
Defendants further claim that the market for Whitney stock was not efficient because
“the market’s ability to react to unexpected statements from the Company was spotty at
best.” Br. at 36. Defendants concede that the “Company’s share price declined after the
issuance of the November 21, 2006, and December 15, 2006, press releases announcing the
SEC and USAO investigations” id., but claim that the same cannot be said of the press
releases issued by the Company on May 15, 2006 and December 21, 2006. Br. at 36.
As a preliminary matter, neither of these announcements was alleged to be a
disclosure of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements. Indeed, the December
21, 2006 announcement disclosing the termination of an executive was made after the Class
Period.

As the Complaint clearly alleges, the post Class Period announcements of

terminations of high-level management team members had little impact on the market price
“because the market had already absorbed the true facts addressed in the Class Period
corrective disclosures: that the Company was being investigated by the SEC and the Attorney
General for the very type of fraudulent conduct at issue here regarding the Company’s
materially false and misleading financial statements.” ¶153.
Regarding the May 15, 2006 announcement – which Defendants imply should have
caused an overnight stock drop – the Complaint plainly alleges that the release was

12

A review of the Company’s quarterly filings reveals eight published numbers for TSO with as-of dates during
the class period. Defendants chose to exclude the final number in the Class Period and include a pre-Class
Period number of 8,704,410.

35

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 38 of 46

materially false and misleading, in part because Defendants “characterized it [as] a minor
event easily explained away” and led investors to believe that the Company was now in
compliance with GAAP and SEC reporting rules, thought it was not. ¶ 91. Nevertheless,
Defendants imply that the Company’s stock should have declined and claim that instead, the
share price increased on the trading days immediately following those releases. Br. at 36.
This is not accurate. On May 15, 2006, the date the Company’s announcement of restated
financials, shares for Whitney closed at $9.95. Miller Decl. at Ex. A. On May 16, the next
trading day, shares closed at $9.65. Miller Decl. at Ex. A. The market quickly assimilated the
bad news and reacted accordingly. Defendants have no legal basis to support that the market
must absorb an after-hours statement overnight, prior to the opening of the following trading
day. See, e.g. In re Merck & Co. Sec. Litig., 432 F.3d 261, 269 (3d Cir. 2005)(finding that
absorption “quickly and completely” means "in the period immediately following
disclosure," citing Oran v. Stafford, 226 F.3d 275, 281 (3d Cir. 2000), but that quickly and
completely “does not mean instantaneously, of course.”).13
Defendants also claim that Plaintiff ignores the Company’s first-filed 2005 10-K,
dated March 31, 2006, which included vague and dismissive information regarding several
inquiries and/or investigations in the states of Florida, Kansas, Wisconsin and Illinois
“concerning the business operations and advertising efforts that Plaintiff now alleges were “a
sham.” Br. at 42. According to Defendants, after these investigations were disclosed, “the

The December 19 release announcing the termination of Masheck and the December 21 release announcing
the resignation of O’Dor “after Management of the Company learned that Mr. O’Dor had made a misstatement
to the press without the knowledge of, or authorization by, the Company, regarding the reason for the
termination of Rance Masheck” came after the end of the Class Period, after the announcement of investigations
by the US Attorney’s Office and the SEC. The small stock price recovery following the news of O’Dor’s
resignation is easily attributed to market relief that the Company was finally cleaning house.

36

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Company’s stock price rose steadily for five weeks.” Br. at 42. This disclosure was made
three months after the end of the Class Period, as the market had already absorbed the true
facts addressed by the Class Period corrective disclosures: that the Company was being
investigated by the SEC and the USAO for the very fraud alleged.

Still, upon this

announcement, the stock price indeed fell, contrary to Defendants’ representations, from
$9.50 on March 30, 2006 to close at $9.00 on March 31, 2006.
Plaintiff has adequately pleaded reliance and the applicability of the fraud on the
market doctrine.
IV.

The Complaint Alleges Fraud With Particularity
A. Allegations in a Complaint May be Based on the Investigation of Counsel
The Complaint is based both on personal knowledge of the Plaintiff and upon

information and belief derived from the investigation of Plaintiff’s counsel. Contrary to
Defendants’ assertion, not only are allegations based upon investigation by Plaintiff’s
counsel an acceptable approach to pleading under the PSLRA, such an investigation is
required. The Eleventh Circuit has stated that “Congress contemplated that plaintiffs
ordinarily would be required to conduct a thorough investigation before filing suit….”
Phillips v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 374 F.3d 1015, 1018 n.5 (11th Cir. 2004)(citations
omitted). “[A]llegations based on the investigation of counsel are the equivalent of
allegations based on information and belief … and must comply with the Reform Act's
requirements for that manner of pleading.” In re Theragenics Corp. Sec. Litig., 105 F. Supp.
2d 1342, 1351 (N.D.Ga 2000), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)).
The Complaint states that “Plaintiff has alleged the following – except as to

37

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 40 of 46

allegations specifically pertaining to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel – based upon the
investigation of Plaintiff’s counsel. . . .” The Complaint alleges that it is based on personal
knowledge (those allegations pertaining to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel) and information
and belief (those based on the investigation of Plaintiff’s counsel). Those allegations based
on information and belief were pleaded with particularity in accordance with the PSLRA.
See Theragenics, 105 F. Supp. 2d at 1351.
Defendants’ reliance on In re Manugistics Group Inc., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22524
(D.Md. August 6, 1999)(Miller Decl. at Ex. I), an unpublished case from the District of
Maryland, for the proposition that a complaint must be based on personal knowledge, is
neither controlling nor persuasive. Br. at 13. Plaintiff was unable to find a single published
opinion in any federal court has cited to Manugistics for this proposition. In Manugistics the
plaintiff failed to state in its preamble whether the complaint was based on personal
knowledge, information and belief, or both. See Manugistics Complaint, Kim Decl. Exh. P.
The Complaint must simply state the basis for its factual allegations – personal knowledge or
information and belief or some combination thereof. See, e.g., In re Pss World Med., Inc Sec.
Litig., 250 F. Supp. 2d 1335, 1350 n.3 (M.D.Fla. 2002), Teachers’, 477 F.3d at 172 (4th Cir).
Defendants also cite Lirette v. Shiva Corp., 999 F. Supp. 164, 165 (D. Mass 1998).
Br. at 13. The court in Lirette did not find that “allegations based upon investigation by
plaintiffs’ counsel are ‘no longer an acceptable approach to pleading’” as Defendants claim.
Br. at 13. Rather, the court deemed insufficient “general assertions” that the allegations were
founded on information and belief and investigation by plaintiff’s counsel and permitted
plaintiffs to file a supplement to specify which allegations were based on information and

38

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 41 of 46

belief and which on personal knowledge. Clearly, the court in Lirette did not require
allegations to be based on personal knowledge alone. Eleventh Circuit law is clear that the
Complaint may, and should, be based on investigation by Plaintiff’s counsel.
B. The Complaint Identifies Which Statements Were False and Misleading
Statements with Particularity
Under the PSLRA, a 10(b) claim must “specify each statement alleged to have been
misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation
regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall
state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1).
Rule 9(b) states that “in all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting
fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity” F.R.C.P. 9(b); See also Brooks v. Blue
Cross & Blue Shield, 116 F.3d 1364, 1371 (11th Cir. 1997)(Rule 9(b) may be satisfied by a
“list containing allegations of fraud describing nature and subject of statements found to be
sufficient, even where precise words used were not alleged.” (citation omitted)).
The Complaint readily meets these requirements, despite Defendants’ protestations to
the contrary. First, the Complaint specifies, in detail, which documents contained
misrepresentations and the date on which the misrepresentations were made. See, e.g., ¶¶ 30,
32 (dated SEC filings), 93 (dated press release). Further, the Complaint specifies which
specific portions of those particular documents contained false and misleading statements by
selecting excerpts and bolding the most relevant false and misleading statements. The
Complaint identifies with specificity the manner in which each of the Defendants’
misstatements was materially false and misleading. See, e.g., ¶¶ 31, 46, 73. Regarding the

39

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 42 of 46

person responsible for making each statement, Defendants include the Company and the
Individual Defendants who hold controlling positions with the company, thereby having
access to the true undisclosed information and a duty to disseminate accurate information; as
such, all false and misleading statements and omissions are attributable to each Defendant.
Finally, the Complaint alleges “what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the
fraud.” See Brooks, 116 F.3d at 1371. For example, the Complaint alleges that, as a result of
the false statements and omissions, Defendants were able to take advantage of the almost
20% inflation that occurred in the price of Company stock and announced plans to spin off
EduTrades in an IPO. ¶133. The Complaint also alleges that Defendants took advantage of
the artificially inflated share price by liquidating privately-held company stock reaping
millions in unearned stock profits. ¶130-132. Defendants were able to liquidate millions in
Company stock, reap a large special dividend, sell millions in stock to PIPE investors, and
register $33.0 million EduTrade shares. ¶¶138-139.
Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to disclose the true adverse facts that the Company
improperly recognized revenue and materially overstated its profitability (¶¶70-75), issued
financial reports that were not in compliance with GAAP or SEC rules (¶¶111-114), had a
secret zero-refund policy that caused the Company to face huge amounts of chargebacks,
increasing the costliness of its merchant accounts and ruining relationships with credit card
processors (¶¶43*57), was forced to restate years of financials (¶¶88-95, 109-110), and had
an untenable business model that was a complete sham with no likelihood of success. (¶¶3242). Despite Defendants’ knowledge or reckless disregard of these facts, the Company
issued at least a dozen press releases and SEC filings during the Class Period riddled with

40

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 108

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 43 of 46

materially false and misleading statements to the contrary.
Despite this tremendous level of detail, Defendants contend, regarding the
manipulation of deferred revenues, that the Complaint “offers no details to corroborate the
amount of alleged improper deferred revenue, when it was allegedly recognized in error, or
why it was in error.” Br. at 23. Over several paragraphs, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
failed to properly defer revenue by, inter alia, recording all “educational” packages as
revenue despite failure to deliver services and products; arbitrarily designating “Coaching”
services as an immediate revenue item, while nearly identical services were classified as
Deferred Revenues -- enabling Defendants to wrongfully recognize tens of millions of dollars
in additional revenues that should have been deferred; and abusing Whitney’s refund policy.
E.g., ¶¶57, 74, 124. The Complaint alleges this enabled the Company “to prematurely and
improperly realize tens of millions of dollars in additional revenues.” ¶75. These allegations
are sufficiently particular to allege that Defendants did not properly record deferred revenue.
See, e.g., SEC v. Collins & Aikman Corp., 524 F. Supp. 2d 477, 495 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“Rule
9(b) does not require the court to delve into the minutiae of accounting regulations at the
pleading stage. On the contrary, at this stage, it is sufficient for plaintiff to allege with
specificity defendant's fraudulent actions.”); Gerber v. Bowditch, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
27552 (D. Mass. May 8, 2006) (“While Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) proscribes the pleading of fraud
by hindsight,' we also cannot expect plaintiffs to plead fraud with complete insight' before
discovery is complete.”)
V. The Individual Defendants Are Liable as Control Persons Under 20(a)
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act provides that “[e]very person who, directly or

41

indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or
regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally….” 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a). The
Eleventh Circuit requires that a Plaintiff allege 1) a primary violation of the securities laws
by a controlled person (the Company); 2) that defendant had the power to control the general
business affairs of the controlled person; and, 3) that defendant had the requisite power to
directly or indirectly control or influence the specific corporate policy which resulted in the
primary liability. Theoharous v. Fong, 256 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir. 2001).
As a preliminary matter, whether a defendant is a control person is a fact intensive
inquiry that is not appropriate for a motion to dismiss. See In re Unicapital Corp. Securities
Litigation, 149 F. Supp.2d 1353, 1368 n.23 (S.D. Fla. 2001)(citation omitted). In any event,
Plaintiff has adequately alleged that beyond the Individual Defendants’ liability for violation
of Section 10(b), they may also be held liable as control persons of the Company under 20(a).
Plaintiff has adequately pleaded a primary violation of Section 10(b) by the
Company, as well as the Individual Defendants. The Complaint also pleads that each of the
Individual Defendants had the power to control the business affairs of Whitney and are
jointly and severally liable under 20(a). See, e.g., ¶¶171-174. Defendant Whitney was
Chairman and CEO of the Company, Defendant Simon was Executive VP and Acting CFO,
Defendant Novas was CFO, Defendant Kane was Executive VP of Operations, Defendant
Maturo was President and Chief Operating Officer, and Defendant Masheck was VP Sales
and Marketing of a Whitney spin-off. ¶¶5-10. The Complaint also asserts facts to support the
allegation that each possessed actual knowledge of the falsity of statements issued by
Whitney including Defendants’ positions with the Company, receipt of internal emails and

42

memoranda, internal discussions, and corroborating statements by Confidential Witnesses.
By virtue of their positions with the Company, each Individual Defendant had the power to
control and/or influence the fraud conducted by the Defendants. Further, as signatories to the
SEC filings, the Individual Defendants influenced and controlled the dissemination of
materially false and misleading information to potential investors. As such, the Section 20(a)
claim is adequately pleaded.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied in full.14

In the event that this Court determines that any portion of this Complaint should be dismissed, Plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to re-plead pursuant to 15(a). “The Eleventh Circuit requires leave to amend be
granted where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim.” Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., 466 F.3d
1255, 1271 (11th Cir. 2006). Defendants’ arguments that leave to amend would be futile (Br. at 44-45) are
baseless. This case has not been considered on its merits and, if dismissed, Plaintiff should be granted lead to
replead to rectify any deficiencies.
