CASE NO. 10-5075
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO
COMPEL DISCOVERY

COMES NOW Joy R. Whipple, M. D., the above-named Plaintiff, by and through her
counsel of record, Shiloh M. MacNally of Gunderson, Palmer, Nelson & Ashmore, LLP, and
hereby submits this Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery. Dr.
Whipple requests an Order from this Court compelling answers to interrogatories, production of
documents.
ARGUMENT
A. Discovery Should be Compelled
Dr. Whipple has propounded the following five interrogatories:
1. How many cases did Tony Smith, D.O. review for you in each of the
following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010?
2. How many cases did Dr. Suzanne Benson review for you in each of the
following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010?
3. How many cases did Dr. Beth Schnars review for you in each of the following
years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010?
4. How many cases did Dr. Andrew Krouskop review for you in each of the
following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010?
5. How many cases did Pam McMillian, RN, MSC J review for you in each of
the following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010?
(Exhibit 1.) Unum has provided answers only for the year 2010. (Exhibit 2.)
Dr. Whipple has also made the following requests for production of documents:
1

Case 5:10-cv-05075-JLV Document 30 Filed 11/02/11 Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 78

1. Please provide the W-2 or 1099 you issued to Tony Smith, D.O. for each of
the following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
2. Please provide the W-2 or 1099 you issued to Dr. Suzanne Benson for each of
the following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
3. Please provide the W-2 or 1099 you issued to Dr. Beth Schnars for each of the
following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
4. Please provide the W-2 or 1099 you issued to Dr. Andrew Krouskop for each
of the following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
5. Please provide the W-2 or 1099 you issued to Pam McMillian, RN, MSC J for
each of the following years: 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
(Exhibit 3.) Unum has provided documentation for the year 2010 only. (Exhibit 1 Bates
stamped “UNUM 1-5”.)
The individuals mentioned in the interrogatories and requests for production are medical
advisors hired by Unum who reviewed Dr. Whipple’s case. They provided opinions which were
part of the basis for Unum’s denial of benefits to Dr. Whipple. The amount of money Unum
paid these individuals and the number of cases they reviewed may show bias and a conflict of
interest. If these individuals receive substantial income from Unum and review many cases, they
may have an interest in preserving their income and employment. “[P]hysicians repeatedly
retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of ‘not disabled’ in order to
save their employers money and preserve their own consulting arrangements.” Black & Decker
Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 832 (2003) (internal quotations omitted). Unum has
provided answers and documents for the year 2010 only, the year Dr. Whipple’s claim was
denied. However, the few years previous to 2010 are relevant to determine bias or a conflict of
interest because those years may indicate fiscal incentives not revealed from the 2010 year. The
year the claim was denied cannot be looked at in a vacuum as it is entirely relevant to review the
few years previous when determining whether a bias or conflict of interest exists. Dr. Whipple

requests this Court compel answers and production of documents for the remaining years
pursuant to Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn, 554 U.S. 105 (2008).
In Glenn, the United States Supreme Court held that when a district court reviews the
denial of benefits, it should take into account “several different, often case-specific, factors”
which include the existence of a conflict of interest. Glenn, 554 U.S. at 117. A conflict of
interest “should prove more important (perhaps of great importance) where circumstances
suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but not limited to,
cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.”
Id. The only way Dr. Whipple can provide evidence of the conflict of interest factor to the
district court is through discovery.
Post-Glenn this Court has already had the opportunity to address whether a plaintiff is
entitled to discovery of a conflict of interest in ERISA denial of benefits cases. In Hackett v.
Standard Insurance Co., No. CIV. 06-5040, 2010 WL 1494772 (D.S.D. April14, 2010) (Dock.
83) this Court stated:
Where a conflict of interest exists, the court, using its authority under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26, should allow plaintiff to inquire into any financial incentive an
administrator or its claims department may have in denying claims which, but for
the conflict, would seem appropriate for payment of benefits. Sanders v. Unum
Life Ins. Co. of Am., No. 4:08CV00421 JLH, 2008 WL 4493043, at *4 (E.D.Ark.
Oct.2, 2008); Burgio v. Prudential Life Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.R.D. 219, No. CV
06-6793(JS)(AKT), 253 F.R.D. 219, 2008 WL 4376241, at *18 (E.D.N.Y. Sept.
24, 2008); Myers v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 581 F.Supp.2d 904, No. 1:08-cv22, 2008 WL 4569969, at *10 (E.D.Tenn. Sept.22, 2008); Hogan-Cross v. Metro.
Life Ins. Co., 568 F.Supp.2d 410, 414 (S.D.N.Y.2008).
The same holds true with respect to the relationship between an administrator’s
claims department and those outside medical advisors who may have an incentive
to inappropriately deny claims so as to extend or otherwise enhance their
longstanding financial relationship with the administrator. Like Magistrate Judge
Duffy, this court agrees with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri, which held that “a conflict . . . cannot be considered in a
vacuum. Discovery is required to explore the nature and extent of the purported
conflict . . . at issue.” Sampson v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, No. 4:08CV
1290 CDP, 2009 WL 882407, at *2 (E.D.Mo. March 26, 2009) (recognizing the

court’s obligation to apply Glenn and ordering limited discovery beyond the
administrative record).
The landscape has, indeed, changed post- Glenn. The plaintiff must be allowed to
make inquiry into the factors which will affect the weight that the court must give
to the conflict of interest analysis under Woo v. Deluxe Corp., 144 F.3d 1157 (8th
Cir.1998).
Hackett, 2010 WL 1494772 at *3-4, (Dock. 83 pg. 7-8).

Dr. Whipple’s discovery requests are

limited, narrowly tailored and entirely relevant. Pursuant to Glenn and Hackett, Dr. Whipple
requests discovery should be compelled.1 To the extent the W-2s or 1099s contain confidential
information such as social security numbers, such sensitive information can be redacted.
CONCLUSION
Dr. Whipple requests an order compelling the above mentioned discovery pursuant to
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn, 554 U.S. 105 (2008) and Hackett v. Standard
Insurance Co., No. CIV. 06-5040, 2010 WL 1494772 (D.S.D. April14, 2010) (Dock. 83).
Dated this 2nd day of November, 2011.

In Hackett, Chief Judge Schreier compelled discovery under nearly identical interrogatories and requests even
before Glenn was decided. Hackett, Civ. 06-5040 (Dock. 37).
