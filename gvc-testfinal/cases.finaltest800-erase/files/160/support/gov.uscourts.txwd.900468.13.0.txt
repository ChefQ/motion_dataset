River. Border Patrol Agents observed them walking east of the Bridge of the
Americas Port of Entry. Jd. Subsequently, Border Patrol Agents arrested the
parents/guardians and their minor children. Jd. Ms. Dominguez Portillo and her
minor child and Ms. Vasquez-Hernandez and her minor child are from El Salvador.
Id. Ms. Natividad Zavala-Zavala and her grandchild, Mr. Yanez-Mancia and his
minor child, and Mr. Claudino-Lopez and his minor child are from Honduras. Id.

However, shortly after the arrests, the parents-defendants were separated
from their minor children. The parents-defendants are being detained in El Paso
charged with misdemeanors for illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1825, while the
whereabouts of the minor children remains unknown to the parents-defendants. The
parent-defendants do not know where in the country, in what facility or under what
conditions these minor children are being held. These minor children range in age
from 7 to 16 years. Needless to say, the experience of being separated from their
minor children for over two weeks in a foreign country has been stressful and
terrifying for these parents-defendants.
II. LEGAL ARGUMENT

The parents-defendants' separation from their minor children during the
children's immigration proceedings, and the premature 0x00A7 1325 charges against them,
constitutes a violation of the Flores Settlement and, most importantly, a violation
of the Due Process Clause with respect to the criminal complaints. The
proper remedy here, under basic principles of fairness of the Due Process Clause, is

for the government 1) to expeditiously reunite these parents with their minor children
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 3 of 16

pending the resolution of the children's immigration proceedings as mandated by the
Flores Settlement, and 2) to dismiss the premature criminal 0x00A7 1325 complaints against
the defendant-parents under basic due process principles.

At the outset, it is important to keep in mind that defendants with this
motion are not asking the court to analyze the strength of the government's
0x00A7 1325 cases against them. The parents-defendants' guilt or innocence under
0x00A7 1325 is not at issue on this motion. Rather, the parents-defendants are
asking the court to take into account the element of compulsion, i.e., the
separation from their minor children, which removes the voluntariness
from their guilty pleas that is required by the Due Process Clause.

With this in mind, the parents-defendants now turn to legal analysis of their
motion to dismiss.

A. Flores Settlement

With respect to the function of the Flores Settlement, a circuit court recently
observed:

The Flores Settlement arose out of a lawsuit first filed by plaintiffs in the

Central District of California in 1985, challenging the policies of the

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). ... The Settlement favors

family unification, and states the order of preference for persons into whose

custody detained minors are to be released, provided that detention is not
required to secure their appearance before immigration authorities or to
ensure the safety of themselves or others. The Settlement also addresses the
appropriate care of those minors who cannot be immediately released, and who

therefore remain in federal custody. This includes providing such minors
with the bond hearing...
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 4 of 16

See Flores v. Sessions ITI, 862 F.3d 863, 869 (9t" Cir. 2017) (emphasis added).

The Flores Settlement applies to all children, whether accompanied or
unaccompanied, who are detained in the legal custody of the government. Flores v.
Lynch, 828 F.3d 898 (9th Cir. 2016); see also Bunikyte ex rel. Bunikiene v. Chertoff,
No. 1:07-cv-00164-SS 2007 WL 1074070, at *1 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2007). Here, the
Flores Settlement implicates the parents-defendants in two respects.

First, the Flores Settlement provides for the care of minor children by their
parents (when parent and child were simultaneously arrested by immigration
authorities) while the resolution of the minor children's immigration proceedings is
pending. See August 23, 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE)
Parental Interests Directive in the Course of Civil Immigration Enforcement,
available at: http://www.ice.gov/dcolib/detention-
refrom/pdf/parental_interest_directive_signed.pdf. ICE's Parental Interests
Directive provides:

Policy. ICE personnel should ensure that the agency's immigration

enforcement activities do not unnecessarily disrupt the parental

rights of both alien parents or legal guardians of minor children.

Particular attention should be paid to immigration enforcement

activities involving: 1) parents or legal guardians who are primary

caretakers; 2) parents or legal guardians who have a direct interest in family
court or child welfare proceedings; 3) parents or legal guardians whose minor
children are physically present in the United States and are USCs or LPRs.

ICE will maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, placing,

monitoring, accommodating, and removing alien parents or legal guardians of
minor children while safeguarding their parental rights.

Id.

The Supreme Court has explained that a parent's right to the custody of
their child is among one of the "essential" and "basic civil rights of man." Stanley v.
Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972). And, the child has a reciprocal right to the care of
her parent. See Curnow v. Ridgecrest Police, 952 F.2d 321, 325 (9th Cir. 1991). And,
Congress has expressed its intent to keep children together with their parents when
apprehended by immigration authorities. When making appropriations to DHS,
Congress has stated:
The report expresses concern regarding reports that children apprehended by
DHS continue to be separated from their parents. The committee's report
language encourages ICE to work with reputable nonprofit organizations to
consider allowing family units to be placed in the intensive Supervised
Appearance Program. If detention is necessary, the report language
encourages ICE to house family members together in nonpenal, home-
like environments until the conclusion of their immigration
proceedings.
See Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 152 Cong. Rec. E1113-02,
2006 WL 1594390. There is no question that in cases involving minor children,
whether accompanied or unaccompanied, the family unit is of paramount concern to
Congress.
With this in mind, it is evident that the Supreme Court, Congress, and the

Flores Settlement do not support the government's separation of the five parents

from their children in the cases at bar. The government's mechanism of separating
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 6 of 16

the family unit and simultaneously charging and prosecuting these parents with a 0x00A7
1325 crime clearly perverts Supreme Court, Congressional, and Flores
Settlement intent.

Second, the Flores Settlement provides for the possibility of a simultaneous
release of the minor child and custodial parent after a bond hearing while the
children's immigration proceedings are pending. Flores v. Sessions III, 862 F.3d 863,
868-69 (9 Cir, 2017). The Flores Settlement provides for an opportunity to the minor
to be released on bond to a parent or guardian. And though the Flores Settlement
does not provide an affirmative release right for the accompanying parent, a
noncriminal alien may be released if he carries the burden of showing that he does
not present a danger to others and is not a threat to national security or a flight risk.
Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d at 909; and In re Guerra, 241. & N. Dec. 37, 38 (BIA 2006).
Congress has expressed its intent of simultaneous release of the juvenile and
the parent, legal guardian, or adult relative when they are apprehended
together by immigration authorities. Congress has stated:

[] the report expresses deep concern about reports that children, even as young

as nursing infants, apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement

(ICE) are being separated from their parents and placed in shelters

operated by the Department of Health and Human Services while parents are

held in separate jail-like facilities. The Committee's report language
directs DHS to release families or use alternatives to detention whenever
possible, and when detention of family units is necessary, the

Committee directs DHS to use appropriate detention space to house
them together.
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 7 of 16

See Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 151 Cong. Rec. E1025-01,
2005 WL 1185446.

In fact, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provide that if a parent, legal
guardian or adult "cannot be located to accept custody of the juvenile, and the juvenile
has identified a parent, legal guardian, or adult relative in Service detention,
simultaneous release of the juvenile and the parent, legal guardian, or adult
relative shall be evaluated on a discretionary case-by-case basis." See 8
C.F.R. 0x00A7 1236.3(b) (2) (emphasis added.). Because the parent is the primary
caretaker, available to take custody and care for his or her child, ICE's Parental
Interest Directive supports the release of the parent so that he can resume his or her
primary caregiver role. See August 23, 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement's (ICE) Parental Interests Directive in the Course of Civil Immigration
Enforcement, available at: http://www.ice.gov/dcolib/detention-
refrom/pdf/parental_interest_directive_signed.pdf. A child's unique vulnerability
necessitates the release of the parent with the child. Id.

And, the Supreme Court has also remarked that mothers should generally be
considered for release along with their children:

The Board of Immigration Appeals has stated that `an alien generally .. .

should not be detained or required to post bond except on a finding that he is

a threat to the national security . .. or that he is a poor bail risk.' . . In the case

of arrested alien juveniles, however, the INS cannot simply send them off into

the night on bond or recognizance. The parties to the present suit agree that
the Service must assure itself that someone will care for those minors pending
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 8 of 16

resolution of their deportation proceedings. That is easily done when the

juvenile's parents have also been detained and the family can be

released together[.]
Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 295 (1993).

Furthermore, women or men who are bona fide asylum seekers, i.e., those who
prove a credible fear of persecution, 8 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV), are eligible to
receive an individualized assessment of whether detention is warranted if they prove
a credible fear of persecution. Here, nothing in the record indicates that these five
parents do not qualify for asylum, much less that they pose any danger that would
require their detention. Again, the government's mechanism of separating the family
unit and simultaneously charging and prosecuting these parents with a 0x00A7 1325 crime
clearly truncates Supreme Court, Congressional, and Flores Settlement intent.

B. Due Process

The text of the Fifth Amendment states: "No person shall . . . be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law..." U.S. Const., amend. V. In
Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 238 (1986), the Supreme Court explained,
"persons within the territory of the United States... and ... even aliens... [may
not]... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law." Id; see
also Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976) (stressing that the Fifth Amendment

applies even to those "whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary, or

transitory."); Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212 (1953)
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 9 of 16

("aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only
after proceedings conforming to traditional standard of fairness encompassed in due
process of law."); and see also United States v. Campos-Asencio, 822 F.2d 506, 507,
509 (5th Cir. 1987) (due process applied to noncitizen apprehended for unlawful re-
entry).

For children, as for adults, "[f]reedom from imprisonment- from government
custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint- lies at the heart of the liberty
that [the Due Process] Clause protects." Zadydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001).

Here, the government's failure to comply with the Flores Settlement results in
two clear violations under basic principles of fairness of the Due Process Clause.

First, the 0x00A7 1325 charges against the parents-defendants are premature and
exhibit a violation of due process because these parents-defendants are being
deprived of an opportunity to explore and exhaust any administrative remedy they
may have with respect to the issue of bond and possible refugee or asylum status.
The Due Process Clause generally forbids detention beyond extremely short periods-
usually a matter of days- absent a hearing before a neutral decision-maker to
determine whether further confinement is necessary. Such hearings are a bedrock
due process requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750 (1987).
Bond hearings are not a new thing under the Flores Settlement, in fact, bond hearings

are regularly conducted by Immigration Judges for individuals detained by
Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document13 Filed 11/07/17 Page 10 of 16

immigration authorities under 8 U.S.C.0x00A7 1226(a); 8 C.F.R. 0x00A70x00A7 1003.19(a) and
1236.1(d)(1). Furthermore, refusing an opportunity for an immigration bond to a
parent or guardian undermines the children's due process interest in parental care.
See Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 844 (1977).

Moreover, under the Flores Settlement, the cases of these parents and children
are to be given meaningful review for purposes of refugee or asylum relief. Depriving
the parents-defendants the opportunity to a meaningful review of refugee or asylum
relief, under the Flores Setilement, is crucial in their defense against the
government's current 0x00A7 1325 charges against them. If the parent-defendants and
their children qualify for refugee or asylum status, they cannot be prosecuted for
being illegally in this country. It is as simple as that. Clearly, the government's lack
of compliance with the Flores Settlement results in prejudice to these parents-
defendants. Depriving the parents-defendants the opportunity to explore and
exhaust the administrative remedies for refugee or asylum relief that may be
available to them and to their children violates due process and is premature.

Second, and most importantly, the parents-defendants are extremely worried
about the safety and well-being of their minor children and want to put these 0x00A7 1325
charges behind them as quickly as possible in the hopes that they will be reunited
with their children as soon as possible. Thus these parents-defendants do not

voluntarily enter a plea of guilty as required by the Due Process Clause. They plea
