GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
DISMISS AND THE COURT’S NOVEMBER 2, 2017 ORDER
The Government hereby submits this response in opposition to the motion to dismiss filed
by five defendants1 and the Court’s order dated November 2, 2017. The Government respectfully
requests that the Court deny the Defendants motion and set these cases for arraignment.
I. BACKGROUND
A.

Facts

The following facts are taken from the criminal complaints and discovery in these cases.
(See, e.g., ECF No.2 6.) Ms. Dominguez is a citizen of El Salvador who left her country around

At the status conference on November 1, 2017, the Court agreed to allow defense counsel
to file a single, consolidated motion for all five cases. As discussed with the Court’s staff, the
Government is following that format in submitting this response, but maintains that it would be
inappropriate to consolidate these cases.

October 14, 2017, traveling through Mexico and arriving in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on October
21, 2017. United States Border Patrol apprehended Ms. Dominguez around 11:00 p.m. on October
21, 2017. At the time, Ms. Dominguez was walking on the levee road, north of the Rio Grande
River, approximately 3.89 miles east of the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry. She was
apprehended with a juvenile that she claimed was her daughter whom she had brought with her on
her journey from El Salvador.
Mr. Claudino is a citizen of Honduras. He left the town of Naco, Honduras, around October
6, 2017, and traveled by bus to Ciudad Juarez, crossing the borders between Honduras and Mexico
illegally in order to avoid detection along the way. Border Patrol apprehended Mr. Claudino
around 6:00 a.m. on October 23, 2017.

At the time, he was walking east on the levee

approximately 4.6 miles east of the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry. He was apprehended
with a juvenile that he claimed was his son whom he had brought with him on his journey from
Honduras.
Mr. Yanes is a citizen of Honduras. He left his country around September 23, 2017,
traveling by bus and other means until he arrived in Ciudad Juarez around October 21, 2017. After
staying with an unknown man in Ciudad Juarez, he was apprehended by the Border Patrol with a
group of fourteen individuals around 10:00 p.m. on October 22, 2017. At the time, he had just
crossed the Rio Grande River and was approximately 1.46 miles west of the Paso Del Norte Port
of Entry. One of the fourteen individuals was a juvenile whom Mr. Yanes claimed was his son
whom he had brought with him on his journey from Honduras.
Ms. Zavala is a citizen of Honduras. She left her country around August 23, 2017, traveling
by bus and other forms of transportation until arriving in Ciudad Juarez around October 9, 2017,
staying with strangers along the way. She stayed with an unknown man in Ciudad Juarez before

being apprehended by the Border Patrol with the same group of fourteen individuals as Mr. Yanes
on October 22, 2017. One of the fourteen individuals was a juvenile that Ms. Zavala claims is her
grand-daughter. (See Transcript at 10:24-11:2, United States v. Zavala-Zavala, No. EP:17-MJ04462-MAT (W.D. Tex. Oct. 24, 2017), ECF No. 14.)
Ms. Vasquez is a citizen of El Salvador. Border Patrol apprehended Ms. Vasquez around
10:00 p.m. on October 23, 2017. At the time, she was walking on the levee approximately one
mile east of the Ysleta Port of Entry. She was apprehended with a juvenile that she claimed was
her son.
B.

Procedural history

The Defendants were arrested and charged with committing the criminal offense of
violating 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(1)—i.e., improper entry by an alien. (See, e.g., ECF No. 6.) As a
result of the Defendants’ arrests, the juveniles were processed as unaccompanied juveniles, see 6
U.S.C. § 279(g)(2),3 and transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”)
as required by law. See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3) (requiring Government agencies to transfer custody

3

Counsel for the Government cannot confirm that the Defendants are, in fact, related to
the juveniles as they claim. Many juveniles entering in this manner appear to lack identifying
documents leaving Border Patrol unable to confirm their parentage. See 6 C.F.R. § 115.14
(directing DHS to “seek to obtain reliable evidence of a family relationship” when “determining
the existence of a family unit for detention purposes” as part of the regulations intended to prevent
sexual abuse of juveniles). The juveniles may have been deemed unaccompanied based on Border
Patrol’s lack of information concerning their parentage or in light of the fact that the Defendants
were charged for their criminal conduct. See U.S. ex rel. K.E.R.G. v. Sec’y of Health & Human
Servs., 638 F. App’x 154, 160 (3d Cir. 2016) (concluding that a juvenile was “properly designated
as [an unaccompanied juvenile] and transferred into HHS’s custody” where the adult
accompanying her had no legal or biological relationship to her); D.B. v. Cardall, 826 F.3d 721,
746-47 (4th Cir. 2016) (Floyd, J., dissenting) (disagreeing with the majority’s holding that having
a parent that is considered unfit renders a juvenile “unaccompanied,” but conceding that a juvenile
with an incarcerated parent would be “unaccompanied”).
-3-

of unaccompanied alien children to the Secretary of Health and Human Services “not later than 72
hours” after determining that the child is unaccompanied, absent exceptional circumstances).
ORR is charged with ensuring that the interests of juveniles are considered in decisions
and actions relating to the care and custody of unaccompanied alien children.

6 U.S.C.

§ 279(b)(1)(B). ORR has its own policies and procedures for placing children, reuniting them with
their families, determining whether to release or detain them, and keeping their information
confidential. See ORR, ORR Guide: Children Entering the United States Unaccompanied,
https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied

(last

reviewed Oct. 30, 2017). Specifically, Sections 1.7.4 and 2.1 of the ORR Guide set forth some of
the policies and procedures ORR takes to ensure the care and safety of alien juveniles apprehended
in the United States without a parent or legal guardian available to provide care and custody. Id.
ORR also has a process in place that allows ORR to find family members and others who may
qualify to care for an unaccompanied juvenile as soon as the juvenile enters ORR’s care. Id. at §§
1.7.4, 2.2. ORR also makes it possible for individuals looking for an alien juvenile in ORR custody
to make inquiries regarding the juvenile’s placement. Id. at § 1.5; see also ORR, Office of Refugee
Resettlement National Call Center, https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/orr-national-call-center
(last reviewed Nov. 16, 2016).4
The Defendants were then brought before the Court for initial appearances on October 23,
24, and 26, 2017, where the Court appointed counsel to represent them and set bond at $5,000.

Counsel for the Government’s legal research has not revealed (and the Defendants have
not cited) any statute or regulation which govern any process for the provision of information
regarding the juvenile children of undocumented aliens charged with a petty misdemeanor such as
illegal entry. For a more general discussion of the Government’s view of this area of the law, as
set forth by the Department of Justice, Civil Division, Office of Immigration Litigation, see
generally Respondents-Appellees’ Response Brief, Beltran v. Poston, No. 15-1993 (4th Cir. Feb.
8, 2016), ECF No. 43.
-4-

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 5 of 21

(ECF No. 8.) Pursuant to Rule 58(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an initial
appearance on a misdemeanor charge such as improper entry generally involves the court
informing the defendant of: the charge, the penalties, the right to retain counsel, the right to request
appointed counsel, the right not to make a statement, the circumstances under which the defendant
may secure pretrial release, and, for noncitizens, the right to request consular notification. In
addition to covering those subjects, the Court also asked of all the defendants whether any one of
them was accompanied by a “minor child or a minor sibling?” (ECF No. 14 at 8:19-20.) The
Court then asked whether any such defendants were “provided any information as to how to find
out about [their] whereabouts . . . or well-being?” (ECF No. 14 at 9:12-17.) The Court urged the
Defendants to “discuss this” with their attorney, who “may be able to assist you in at least finding
out some basic information.” (ECF No. 14 at 9:19-25.)5
As part of this discussion at his initial appearance, Mr. Claudino volunteered that Border
Patrol had told him that his son could potentially be placed with Mr. Claudino’s brother, who was
living in Los Angeles. (Transcript at 12:23-13:6, United States v. Claudino Lopez, No. EP:17-MJ04456-MAT (W.D. Tex. Oct. 24, 2017), ECF No. 15.) Ms. Zavala acknowledged that she was
provided with “a piece of paper” but that she did not “know what the paper says.” (Transcript at
11:14-17, United States v. Zavala-Zavala, No. EP:17-MJ-04462-MAT (W.D. Tex. Oct. 24, 2017),
ECF No. 14.) Ms. Vasquez stated that she was told that her son would be taken to a facility for
juveniles and that she was assured that her son “was going to be okay.” (Transcript at 8:7-22,
United States v. Vasquez-Hernandez, No. EP:17-MJ-04499-MAT (W.D. Tex. Oct. 26, 2017), ECF
No. 14.) After Ms. Vasquez stated that she was “worried” about her son, the Court responded: “I

5

The Government notes that the Defendants’ admissions at their initial appearances to
bringing other individuals is evidence that subjects them to criminal liability for committing the
felony offense of bringing aliens to the United States under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i).
-5-

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 6 of 21

would be very worried as well if it was me. I understand your worry and I understand your
frustration.” (Id. at 9:9-11.) Although the Government recognizes that the Court was expressing
empathy for the Defendants’ circumstances and does not question the Court’s impartiality on this
motion, it observes that the Court may have spoken inartfully in further advising Ms. Vasquez that:
“Your attorney is appointed to represent you on this charge. But given that you have this concern,
given that it can have an impact in your case as to whether you decide to plead guilty or not, since
the government has your child, you can discuss this with your attorney and hopefully your attorney
can give you some assistance, all right, in terms of being able to locate the child.” (Id. at 10:1318.) The Court initiated a dialogue with the defendants at Ms. Vasquez’s initial appearance in
Spanish; which dialogue was not translated into English so that it could be made part of the Record.
(Id. at 3:10-11.)
The Court then set the cases for a status conference on November 1, 2017. (ECF No. 11.)
At the status conference, the Court indicated that it was troubled by the circumstances of
defendants in § 1325 cases who had been traveling with juvenile children or siblings and were
unable to obtain information about them after being arrested. The Court indicated that it had done
its own research on the issue and recognized that it was a complex area, involving a number of
laws and agencies. The Court explained that it had asked CJA counsel to assist their clients to
obtain information in those circumstances, but that it was difficult to get that information by the
time most defendants in § 1325 cases would plead guilty. The Court stated that it was concerned
that the lack of information about the juveniles could impact the voluntariness of the Defendants’
guilty pleas. Thus, it indicated that it intended to issue an order outlining several issues that it
wanted the parties to brief.

-6-

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 7 of 21

Defense counsel stated that he was aware of the Court’s concerns and was ready to file a
motion on the subject within a matter of days. Defense counsel then agreed to await the Court’s
order, incorporate responses to the points in the order into the motion that he had drafted. The
Government requested the standard amount of time to respond to the motion under the Court’s
Local Rules, which the Court agreed to allow. See Local Rule CR-47(b).
On November 2, 2017, the Court issued its order (“Order”) outlining the issues it wished
the parties to address in their motion and response. (ECF No. 3.) On November 7, 2017, the
Defendants filed their motion to dismiss (“Mot.”) these cases.6 (ECF No. 13.) The Defendants
have not offered any testimony or other evidence in support of their motion and have not requested
a hearing in order to present any such evidence. To date, the Defendants have not been arraigned
or entered a plea. The Government now responds.
II. DISCUSSION
The Government opposes the Defendants’ unprecedented request for dismissal of these
criminal cases based on unfounded claims of coercion concerning circumstances entirely unrelated
to the underlying offenses. If granted, the relief the Defendants request would have the disastrous
effect of encouraging aliens to traffic or use children when making illegal entries into the United
States. To the extent that the Defendants are unable to plead voluntarily, their remedy is not
dismissal, it is to go to trial. Moreover, even if the Defendants had put forth any evidence
supporting their claims of involuntariness, the family-related concerns and purported withholding
of information that they allege, is not sufficient to render a plea involuntary under the law. Padilla
v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), does not suggest otherwise. Similarly, the Defendants’ reliance

6

The Government notes that the Defendants’ motion did not comply with Local Rule
CR-49(b)(1)(C)(i).
-7-

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 8 of 21

on Due Process is unavailing as they are being detained on criminal charges, with a bond set at
$5,000, which is undoubtedly constitutional. Furthermore, the civil Flores settlement and other
materials concerning immigration detention relied upon by the Defendants do not bolster their
claims as they do not confer any rights upon the Defendants and are plainly inapplicable in these
criminal prosecutions.
A.

This is a criminal prosecution and the Court lacks jurisdiction over unrelated
issues

The Defendants have been charged with the crime of improper entry by an alien. This
Court has jurisdiction over these cases pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3231. That jurisdiction does not
extend to the Defendants’ access to information concerning the juveniles with whom they were
apprehended and other tangential issues. See United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal, 355 F.3d
40, 55 (1st Cir. 2004) (concluding that the district court had jurisdiction over a criminal defendant
but did not have jurisdiction to issue orders concerning the custody of the defendant’s children).
The issues relevant to these cases as charged are whether the Government can establish the
elements of the offense and whether the Defendants have any defenses. As the Court knows, the
elements of improper entry are that the defendant: (1) was an alien; (2) who entered or attempted
to enter the United States; and (3) entered or attempted to enter at a time or place other than as
designated by immigration officers. 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(1). The Government must also establish
that venue is proper in the Western District of Texas. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 18. The Defendants
do not appear to dispute any of the elements of the charge, nor do they appear to raise any defenses.
Rather, they implicitly concede that the elements are satisfied, repeatedly protesting that they do
not wish to discuss the strength of the Government’s case against them. (Mot. 3, 13.)
Instead of raising any legitimate defense to these criminal prosecutions, the Defendants
contend that the prosecutions are “premature.” (Mot. 3, 9-10.) The Defendants appear to be
-8-

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 9 of 21

suggesting that they may be able to obtain asylum or some other form of status at some point in
the future. (See Mot. 8-10.) However, even if they are able to obtain any such status, it does not
change the fact that they were aliens at the time that they illegally entered the United States. See
United States v. Jimenez-Alcala, 353 F.3d 858, 861-62 (10th Cir. 2003) (indicating that “a
noncitizen does not become a ‘national of the United States’ merely by residing in this country for
a lengthy period of time, or by entering illegally and subjectively considering himself a person
who owes permanent allegiance to this country”). Elsewhere, the Defendants concede that the
alienage element is satisfied, referring to the United States as a “foreign country” to them.7 (Mot.
2.)
Instead of addressing the pending criminal charges against them, the Defendants request
the extraordinary remedy of dismissal on the basis of various proclamations, most of which are
based in civil caselaw and standards governing civil immigration detention. As discussed below,
these arguments are unavailing.
B.

There is no basis for dismissal

The Defendants request the extraordinary remedy of dismissal of the criminal complaints
against them without citing a single case or statute that supports their request. Rule 12 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure sets forth a number of bases for pretrial motions, such as a
lack of jurisdiction, defects in institution the prosecution, or defects in the charging document. See
Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2), (b)(3)(A), (b)(3)(B). These types of defects can result in dismissal. The

7

For the purposes of an illegal entry charge, an “alien” is any person who is not a citizen
or national of the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3). A person can become a “national” only
by birth or by completing the naturalization process. Omolo v. Gonzales, 452 F.3d 404, 409 (5th
Cir. 2006). The Defendants admit to being from foreign countries and do not claim to have
completed the naturalization process. Moreover, even if the alienage element was not satisfied,
criminal charges would still apply. See 19 U.S.C. § 1459(a), (e), & (g). Indeed, crossing the
international boundary at a place that is not a port of entry is a crime.
-9-

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 10 of 21

Defendants’ request, however, has no Rule 12 basis. Instead, it appears to be based on their
contention that if they plead guilty at some point in the future, it would be involuntary. (See Mot.
12-13.) In cases where the courts have found that a plea was involuntary, the remedy is that the
involuntary guilty plea is void, the defendant may enter a new plea, and proceed to trial. See, e.g.,
United States v. Anderson, 468 F.2d 440, 443 (5th Cir. 1972). The same is true with respect to a
Padilla violation. See United States v. Urias-Marrufo, 744 F.3d 361, 369 (5th Cir. 2014).
Consequently, even if the Defendants’ contentions about involuntariness and coercion were valid
(which, as discussed below, they are not), their remedy would be to proceed to trial.8
Moreover, dismissing these cases on that basis could have the disastrous effect of
incentivizing aliens to make illegal entries with juveniles in order to avoid prosecution, and thereby
encourage the trafficking of children. This would defy Congress’s directives. See D.B. v. Cardall,
826 F.3d 721, 738-39 (4th Cir. 2016) (noting that the relevant statutes and regulations in this area
reflect Congress’s “unmistakable” intention to protect alien children from trafficking and
exploitation); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(1) (directing various officials to “establish policies and
programs to ensure that unaccompanied alien children in the United States are protected from
traffickers and other persons seeking to victimize or otherwise engage such children in criminal,

8

The Defendants conclude their motion by proclaiming that the Government’s conduct is
“outrageous!” (Mot. 14.) To the extent they are asserting that the Government has engaged in
outrageous conduct warranting dismissal of the charges, their claim is without merit as they were
“active, willing participant[s] in the criminal conduct that le[d] to [their] arrest.” United States v.
Posada Carriles, 541 F.3d 344, 361 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Asibor, 109 F.3d
1023, 1039 (5th Cir. 1997)). Indeed, the Government played no role in the Defendants’ illegal
entries or their decision to bring juveniles with them while making their journeys over the course
of weeks and thousands of miles in order to illegally cross the Rio Grande River in the dark. As
noted above, although the Defendants are only currently charged with the misdemeanor offense of
illegal entry, their admitted conduct satisfies the elements of the felony offense of alien smuggling,
8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i).
- 10 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 11 of 21

harmful, or exploitative activity, including policies and programs reflecting best practices in
witness security programs.”).
Unfortunately there are numerous examples of adults who posed as the parents of children
that they were trafficking, smuggling, or using as props in an attempt to avoid prosecution. See,
e.g., United States v. Cabrera, 288 F.3d 163, 166 (5th Cir. 2002) (discussing a smuggling scheme
whereby the defendants “assisted individuals in illegally entering the United States from Mexico
by paying parents to permit their children to accompany immigrants across the border” in an
attempt to take advantage of a Border Patrol “policy of returning families with young children to
Mexico rather than detaining them and charging them with illegal entry”); Martinez De Martinez
v. Mukasey, 259 F. App’x 24, 25 (9th Cir. 2007) (affirming determination that an individual
“knowingly participated in the smuggling plan by pretending to be the alien child’s mother”); U.S.
Federal News, Ecuadorian Couple Sentenced to More Than 5 Years in Federal Prison for Alien
Smuggling Conspiracy, Sept. 7, 2016 (indicating that an investigation revealed that a defendant
“smuggled a 2-year-old El Salvadoran child through El Paso’s Bridge of the Americas Port of
Entry” by using “her own child’s birth certificate to facilitate the smuggling” and that another child
was raped by smugglers who were involved in the same conspiracy).9 Not only is the Defendants’
request unprecedented, it is bad policy that could endanger more children.

The events discussed in the article cited resulted in the following prosecutions: United
States v. Estrella Villota, No. EP:15-CR-1603-KC(1) (W.D. Tex. 2016) (conviction for alien
smuggling), United States v. Malagon Sandoya, No. EP:15-CR-1603-KC(2) (W.D. Tex. 2016),
(conviction for alien smuggling), and United States v. Marcial, No. EP:15-CR-1603-KC(5) (W.D.
Tex. 2016), (conviction for false statement). See also United States v. Castro, No. 3:11-CR-03064PRM (W.D. Tex.) (concerning the defendant’s prosecution for smuggling an Ecuadorian child who
she presented as her United States citizen daughter); United States v. Martinez Velez, No. 3:13-cr02685-DB (W.D. Tex.) (concerning the defendant’s prosecution for smuggling an Ecuadorian
child who she presented as her United States citizen son); United States v. Garcia, No. EP:17-MJ4746-RFC (W.D. Tex.) (concerning the defendant’s prosecution for smuggling a Mexican female

C.

The Defendants have not established coercion or involuntariness

The Defendants have not pled guilty or attempted to do so. However, through their counsel,
they claim that they feel coerced into pleading guilty because of their lack of information about
the juveniles. (Mot. 9-14.) The Defendants have not offered any evidence supporting their claims
of coercion (or even their claims to be the juveniles’ parents). As discussed above, to the extent
that they cannot voluntarily plead guilty, their remedy is to go to trial. Regardless, their allegations
do not rise to the level of rendering any plea involuntary under the applicable legal standards.
“The test for determining a guilty plea’s validity is ‘whether the plea represents a voluntary
and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.’” Matthew
v. Johnson, 201 F.3d 353, 364 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56 (1985)).
“The plea must be entered ‘voluntarily,’ i.e., not be the product of actual or threatened physical
harm, or mental coercion overbearing the will of the defendant or of state-induced emotions so
intense that the defendant was rendered unable to weigh rationally his options with the help of
counsel.” Id. at 365 (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Jones v. Estelle, 584 F.2d
687, 690 (5th Cir. 1978) (citing Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 750-51 (1970).
“Not all pressures to plead, however, are considered illegal inducements.” Grabowski v.
Jackson Cty. Pub. Defs. Office, 47 F.3d 1386, 1389 (5th Cir. 1995), vacated on reh’g en banc, 79
F.3d 478 (5th Cir. 1996).10 “There are many reasons why a defendant may choose to plead guilty.

child who she presented as her United States citizen son). The Court will also recall the recent
case of United States v. Serrano-Villeda, No. EP:17-MJ-03966-MAT (W.D. Tex.), which was
previously set for trial on November 7, 2017. In that case, the defendant was accompanied by his
daughter. Although they told Border Patrol that she was a juvenile at the time that they were
apprehended, she later admitted to being 19 years old.
10

Although the three-judge panel’s opinion in Grabowski was vacated when the Fifth
Circuit decided to take the case en banc, the en banc court reached the same decision as the threejudge panel on the habeas corpus relief implicated by the claim of involuntariness, albeit without
- 12 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 13 of 21

They do not, simply by being denominated ‘fears,’ necessitate the conclusion that the plea was not
voluntary.” Kent v. United States, 272 F.2d 795, 798 (1st Cir. 1959). Thus, “[e]motional turmoil
from being accused of a crime does not give rise to a finding of coercion.” Meachem v. Keane,
899 F. Supp. 1130, 1141 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Rather, “[t]he relevant question” in these circumstances
“is not whether the accused was sensitive to external considerations—many defendants are—but
instead whether the decision to plead was voluntary, i.e., a product of free will.” United States v.
Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1541 (1st Cir. 1989).
Notably, courts have generally found that family-related pressures do not rise to the level
of overcoming a defendant’s free will and rendering a plea involuntary. See Parrish v. Beto, 414
F.2d 770, 771 (5th Cir. 1969) (rejecting a claim of mental coercion based, in part, on “the dramatic
pleas of” the defendant’s mother); Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541 (concluding that evidence regarding
the defendant’s agitated emotional state brought on by conversations with his hospitalized mother
did not “necessarily show coercion, duress, or involuntariness”); Wojtowicz v. United States, 550
F.2d 786, 792 (2d Cir. 1977) (rejecting undue coercion claim based on the defendant’s assertion
that he pleaded guilty because he was afraid that his paramour would not wait for him if he went
to trial); United States ex rel. Mascia v. Zelker, 450 F.2d 166, 168-69 (2d Cir. 1971) (concluding
that pressure from defense counsel, combined with mother’s threat to commit suicide, were
insufficient to establish a need for evidentiary hearing on coercion); Kent, 272 F.2d at 798 (“The
fact that a defendant is told that his brother and others will be called to testify against him if he
stands trial cannot be illegal coercion, at least in the absence of an allegation that their testimony
would have been false.”); United States v. Gasaway, 437 F. App’x 428, 435 (6th Cir. 2011)

discussion. See Grabowski, 79 F.3d at 480. Thus, the three-judge panel’s opinion still presents
strong persuasive authority of the Fifth Circuit’s view on these issues.

(holding that family pressure to plead guilty “is not the type of coercion that makes a defendant’s
acceptance of a guilty plea involuntary”); United States v. Robinson, 427 F. App’x 163, 167 (3d
Cir. 2011) (similar); Maine v. Malo, 577 A.2d 332, 334 (Me. 1990) (concluding that “emotional
duress stemming from the effect of trial publicity on [the defendant’s] family” did not render his
plea involuntary). Indeed, even a threat to prosecute a defendant’s family members does not
constitute coercion when the Government has probable cause to bring such charges. See United
States v. Diaz, 733 F.2d 371, 375 (5th Cir. 1984).
Furthermore, the withholding of information directly related to the criminal case at issue
does not necessarily constitute coercion. United States v. Conroy, 567 F.3d 174, 179 (5th Cir.
2009) (holding that the withholding of exculpatory evidence, in addition to impeachment evidence,
does not render a guilty plea involuntary); see also United States v. Sanders, 843 F.3d 1050, 1054
(5th Cir. 2016). Thus, in United States v. Johnson, 603 F. App’x 867, 872 (11th Cir. 2015), the
Eleventh Circuit explained that the “Constitution requires only that a guilty plea be knowing and
voluntary; not that it be fully informed.” Accordingly, that court rejected the defendants’ argument
that the Government had an obligation to inform them of all facts that could be used to enhance
their Guidelines sentencing ranges. Id. It noted that any such information “only affects the
potential length of their sentences.” Id.

Consequently, because it did “not relate to their

convictions” it did “not affect the knowing and voluntary nature” of their pleas. Id.
Here, the Defendants have not pleaded guilty and are free to proceed to trial. Even if they
had pled guilty, however, they have not established any basis for their claim of coercion that would
allow them to withdraw such pleas. Moreover, ORR has not offered to provide more information
about the juveniles in exchange for the Defendants to plead guilty. Their ability to obtain that

- 14 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 15 of 21

information is contingent on following ORR’s policies, not their plea in these criminal cases. The
Defendants’ claims of involuntariness and coercion are unfounded.
D.

Padilla v. Kentucky has little or no relevance here

Both the Court’s order and the Defendants (Order 3; Mot. 11) invoke the Supreme Court’s
decision in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010). In Padilla, a noncitizen petitioner sought
postconviction relief from his conviction for transportation of methamphetamine based on the fact
that his trial counsel had failed to advise him that he would be subject to automatic deportation if
he pled guilty. Id. at 359-60. The Supreme Court held that trial counsel’s failure to advise the
petitioner about the immigration consequences of his plea constituted constitutionally deficient
performance under Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel standard. Id. at 366-69. The Court
did not reach the question of whether the petitioner could demonstrate prejudice such that he would
be entitled to postconviction relief. Id. at 374-75. In the wake of Padilla, Rule 11 was amended
to include a warning regarding immigration consequences for noncitizen defendants in the plea
colloquy. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(O).
The automatic deportation faced by the petitioner in Padilla is not analogous to the
Defendants’ situation with their alleged juvenile relatives. The Government has not suggested that
the Defendants’ decision to plead guilty or go to trial has any bearing on when and how they will
receive additional information concerning the juveniles. Rather, these criminal cases, which are
being litigated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, have no bearing on ORR’s custody of the juveniles.
Regardless of the outcome here, the Defendants will have to follow ORR’s policies to establish
their relationship with the juveniles in order to obtain information about them. Moreover, the

- 15 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 16 of 21

Defendants will be free to pursue whatever immigration relief they wish once their criminal cases
are concluded (regardless of the outcome).11
To the extent that Padilla has any application here, it would merely suggest that the Court
include a question in its colloquy to establish that the Defendants’ concern for the juveniles has
not overwhelmed them to the point that they can no longer voluntarily plead guilty. To the extent
that they are unable to do so voluntarily, they may proceed to trial.
E.

The Defendants have not established any Due Process violation

Lacking any legitimate basis for seeking dismissal of the charges against them, the
Defendants go on at length about alleged Due Process violations. (Mot. 8-14.) However, the
Defendants have been detained on criminal charges, with a bond set at $5,000.

This is

commonplace in the criminal justice system and plainly does not constitute a Due Process violation
any more that it would for any other alien facing criminal charges.
The Defendants’ detention is authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 3142, which was upheld against a
Due Process challenge by the Supreme Court in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987).
The modest $5,000 bond is plainly constitutional, particularly in light of the fact that the
Defendants are aliens with minimal or no ties to the United States who could easily flee to Mexico.
See United States v. McConnell, 842 F.2d 105, 109 (5th Cir. 1988) (upholding the setting of bail
at $750,000 even where the defendant was unable to pay it and concluding that it was “neither

11

The Defendants contend that they “have no options” to pursue their immigration claims
civilly because they lack the funds to hire an immigration attorney. (Mot. 11.) It is well-settled,
however, that there is no Sixth Amendment right to Government-funded counsel in immigration
proceedings. Prichard-Ciriza v. I.N.S., 978 F.2d 219, 222 (5th Cir. 1992). Padilla does not
suggest anything to the contrary, nor does it provide a license for appointed counsel in their
criminal cases to seek immigration relief on their behalf in those criminal cases.
- 16 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 17 of 21

constitutionally nor statutorily infirm”). The Defendants’ discussion of immigration bonds (see
Mot. 9-10) is entirely irrelevant to these criminal cases.
Moreover, the courts have also upheld various conditions of detention against civil
challenges, including “double-bunking” and “denials of such items as visitation, telephone access,
recreation, mail, legal materials, and showers for a three-day period.” Broussard v. Par. of
Orleans, 318 F.3d 644, 658 (5th Cir. 2003). The Defendants’ assertion of parental rights12 does
not change that analysis. See Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 498, 505-06 (5th Cir.
2006) (rejecting a claim of “substantive due process violation of parental rights” for an alien with
children who were United States citizens where she was barred from returning to the United States
as it “would subject to strict scrutiny any attempt by the government to incarcerate or bar from
entry into the country a parent with children, or child with parents, in the United States.”);
Ghaith v. Rauschenberger, 493 F. App’x 731, 739 (6th Cir. 2012) (concluding that allegations that
the police conspired to deny parental rights to a civil plaintiff-arrestee were “insufficient to
establish a constitutional violation”); McCurdy v. Dodd, 352 F.3d 820, 827 (3rd Cir.2003) (“[T]he
Supreme Court has protected the parent only when the government directly acts to sever or
otherwise affect his or her legal relationship with a child. The Court has never held that
governmental action that affects the parental relationship only incidentally ... is susceptible to
challenge for a violation of due process”) (quoting Valdivieso Ortiz v. Burgos, 807 F.2d 6, 8 (1st
Cir.1986)); Herrin v. Treon, 459 F. Supp. 2d 525, 544 (N.D. Tex. 2006) (rejecting civil claim
based on “constitutional rights as a parent”). The Defendants’ difficulty obtaining information

12

Of course, Ms. Zavala claims to be a grandparent, not a parent, of the juvenile with whom
she was apprehended. The Court was also inquiring more broadly at the initial appearances as to
whether any of the defendants present were traveling with a juvenile who was a “relative.” (ECF
No. 14 at 8:23-24.)
- 17 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 18 of 21

about the juveniles is no different from the circumstances faced by any other detained arrestee
facing criminal charges who has their liberty restricted. See Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576,
589 (1984) (upholding a constitutional challenge to a blanket prohibition on visits from family or
friends for pretrial detainees).
Furthermore, though not relevant for the purposes of these criminal cases, the Defendants
do not necessarily have the broad Due Process rights that they claim in the context of immigration
proceedings. The Supreme Court has explained that aliens who are “paroled” into the United
States for limited purposes have not effected an “entry,” and do not have the same constitutional
rights under the Due Process clause as citizens or aliens who have entered. See Zadvydas v. Davis,
533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (citing Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 188-90 (1958), and United
States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 269 (1990)); Castro v. Cabrera, 742 F.3d 595, 599601 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Gisbert v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 988 F.2d 1437, 1440-44 (5th Cir.), amended,
997 F.2d 1122 (5th Cir. 1993)); see also Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 531 (2003) (concluding
that an alien’s six month detention pending removal proceedings did not violate Due Process).
Regardless, the Defendants are currently detained on criminal charges, not in removal
proceedings. At this point, it is not clear what the outcome of their immigration proceedings will
be and they can litigate any Due Process claims once their criminal cases have concluded.13
F.

The civil Flores settlement has no applicability in these criminal cases

The Defendants discuss the civil Flores settlement at length and also quote from
aspirational policy statements on DHS’s website and Congressional floor speeches regarding

13

In fact, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss is an attempt to circumvent the civil process
through a criminal motion. See FED. R. CIV. P. 5.1(setting forth the requirements a party must
follow when raising a constitutional challenge to a statute). Additionally, the Government notes
that the civil process available to the Defendants is not within the scope of the Federal Public
Defender’s representation of the Defendants in these criminal proceedings.
- 18 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 19 of 21

appropriations bills. (Mot. 3-8.) The Court also asked about the Flores settlement in its Order.
(Order at 2.) These materials have no bearing on the criminal cases before the Court and do not
change the applicable legal analysis in any way.
The Flores settlement established policies for the detention, release and treatment of
juveniles in the custody of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. See D.B., 826 F.3d
at 732. The intent of the Flores settlement was to create minimum guidelines and requirements
regarding the juveniles’ conditions of confinement to ensure their well-being and safety. See
Walding v. United States, No. CIV.A. SA-08-CA124XR, 2009 WL 890265, at *20 (W.D. Tex.
Mar. 30, 2009). Further, the settlement’s “purpose was to establish minimum standards for
licensed programs relating to conditions of confinement.” Id. at 21.
Courts have held that the Flores settlement does not apply to the parents of such juveniles.
See Bunikyte, ex rel. Bunikiene v. Chertoff, No. A-07-CA-164-SS, 2007 WL 1074070, at *16
(W.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2007) (holding that the Flores settlement creates no rights in the parents of
alien juveniles); see also Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 908 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Bunikyte).
Moreover, a review of the Flores settlement shows that processes for the distribution of
information concerning juvenile aliens are not included in the settlement agreement. (See attached
Exhibit “A” Flores settlement.) Regardless, most of the Defendants’ discussion of the Flores
settlement concerns standards for civil detention during the course of immigration proceedings,
which—as discussed above—is irrelevant to this criminal case. As the Supreme Court has
explained, an immigration proceeding is “a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in
this country,” which is distinct from the crime of unlawful entry. I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468
U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984).

- 19 -

Case 3:17-mj-04409-MAT Document 17 Filed 11/20/17 Page 20 of 21

The Defendants also rely on a civil enforcement policy directive issued by the former acting
director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on its website (see Mot. 4, 7), which explicitly
states that it “may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil or criminal matter.” See U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 11064.1: Facilitating Parental Interests in the Course of
Civil

Immigration

Enforcement

Activities,

https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-

reform/pdf/parental_interest_directive_signed.pdf (issued Aug. 23, 2013). This civil directive is
plainly not binding on the current administration’s handling of criminal matters. Otherwise, the
Defendants also rely on two floor speeches of a single legislator on appropriations bills in 2005
and 2006 (Mot. 5-7), which are obviously not controlling here. Weinberger v. Rossi, 456 U.S. 25,
35 n.15 (1982) (stating that the remarks of even a “sponsor of legislation are certainly not
controlling in analyzing legislative history”). Simply put, the Flores settlement and other materials
concerning civil detention of juveniles have no bearing on these criminal prosecutions of adult
aliens.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.
