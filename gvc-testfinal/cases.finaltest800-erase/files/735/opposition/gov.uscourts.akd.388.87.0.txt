DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON
THE ISSUE OF EXEMPTION AT DOCKET 42
I.

INTRODUCTION

The evidence submitted by Gilbert to support his motion for
summary judgment consists of a self-serving, affidavit drafted
after his sworn deposition testimony.

The affidavit does not

support Gilbert’s motion for summary judgment and does not defeat
APC’s motion that the administrative exemption applies under both
the state and federal analyses.

See Docket 38 (APC’s Motion for

Summary Judgment to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Overtime Claims Under the
Administrative Exemption).

The relevant inquiry under the administrative exemption is
whether the employee’s job duties satisfy the statutory test for
an administrative employee.

Gilbert’s conclusory statements that

he was a glorified Safety Specialist are contradicted by his
deposition testimony and are not admissible evidence.

Gilbert’s motion takes issue with only two

prong

The undisputed admissible evidence shows

that Gilbert’s job duties satisfy both of these prongs.

different than those of a Safety Specialist.

was “no different” than a Safety Specialist.

There is no evidence that this work was the same as a Safety
Specialist.
Gilbert argues that his logs daily logs “best describe[]”
his job duties.

Docket 42 (Exhibit A).

The logs submitted

covering his time as a Safety Specialist (January 30, 2001 to
January 1, 2002) are very different from the logs covering his
time as a Safety Supervisor (January 3, 2002 to April 22, 2003).
Although Gilbert’s log notes are rather cryptic, they show that
he went from performing work in the Kaparuk field to work in an
office.

Put another way, the Safety Supervisor was a “white

collar” job.

As Gilbert points out in his motion, the federal

regulations defining an administrative employee provide that the

work of a Safety Specialist, only in an office, is incredulous

The regulations defining this prong, however, provide

that:
[t]he decisions made as a result of the exercise of

The fact that an employee’s

The undisputed evidence is that Gilbert acted as HSE
Manager in Doug Smith’s absence.

In regard to the administrative exemption prong requiring
that the employee perform work only under general supervision,
Gilbert states that he “did not fill in for Doug Smith as HSC
[sic] Manager.”

See Docket 43 ¶ 2.

This conclusory statement

is directly contrary to Doug Smith and not credible.

Smith

testified that when he was off rotation or not on the North
Slope, Gilbert filled the role of HSE manager and had authority
to make decisions that affected the HSE Department.

See Docket

While serious incidents or

accidents may have required that Gilbert notify Smith, he had
the autonomy to make recommendations and proceed accordingly.

Gilbert

independently

investigated

accidents

and

made

recommendations to prevent them from occurring in the future.
See id.(Exhibit A at 68-81). Because Smith was only on the slope
four days at a time, Gilbert could potentially be the acting HSE
almost half of the time he was on the slope.
