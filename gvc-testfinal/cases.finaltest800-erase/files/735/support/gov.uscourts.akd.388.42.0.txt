MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE
ISSUE OF EXEMPTION
INTRODUCTION
John Gilbert (Gilbert) was hired as a Safety Specialist by APC Natchiq, Inc, at the
Kuparak Field on the North Slope of Alaska. Gilbert was hired on January 30, 2001 to
January 1, 2002 after which he was promoted to Safety Supervisor and worked for
defendant through April 22, 2003. Gilbert filed a lawsuit on June 20, 2003, making a

claim for overtime pursuant to the Alaska Wage and Hour Act (AWHA), the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA), and a contractual claim for unpaid overtime.
Under both Federal and State Wage and Hour law, an employee is presumed to
be nonexempt (i.e. entitled to overtime).

Under State Wage and Hour law, the

employer must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the employee is exempt.
The burden of proof upon the defendant employer is, proof beyond a reasonable
doubt that the employee is exempt (i.e. not entitled to overtime). Additionally, under
State law, even if the employee performs exempt duties, if he/she spends more than
20% of his/her time on nonexempt duties, then he is nonexempt.
The defendant employer here has produced either no; or paltry, evidence to
indicate that Gilbert is exempt. This evidence, in no fashion, is sufficient to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that Gilbert was an exempt employee. Both additionally;
and as part of the foregoing, defendant made no time analysis of Gilbert’s day to day
duties to see whether or not he was performing exempt duties 20% of the time.
The position of Safety Specialist, as a matter of law, is nonexempt (i.e. entitled to
overtime).
A party could perform an independent analysis of the Safety Supervisor position
to decide it’s exempt status. Simplistically, perhaps the most efficient way to arrive at a
conclusion that the Safety Supervisor is nonexempt (keeping in mind, at all times, that
there is a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the employer to make the case
for exemption), is to ask what duties of the Safety Supervisor might be different from
the known exempt position of Safety Specialist?

In any event, there is no demonstration in the evidence developed in discovery to
show even by a preponderance of evidence (much less clear and convincing evidence,
much less proof beyond a reasonable doubt) that Gilbert, while working as a Safety
Supervisor was exempt from the overtime requirements. The Court should enter an
order, finding that, as a matter of law, Gilbert, while working as a Safety Supervisor
was nonexempt.
THE LAW
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a Federal act which ensures that
employees receive time-and-a-half for overtime for hours worked over 40 hours per
week. 29 USC § 207. The Alaska Wage & Hour Act (AWHA) is a state act which
ensures that time-and-a-half wages are paid for overtime hours over 40 hours a week
and/or eight hours a day. AS 23.10.060. The Alaska Wage & Hour Act can provide
greater protection for employees than the Federal act. Quinn v. ASEA, 944 P.2d 468, 471
(Alaska 1997). Both acts provide exemptions from overtime for persons employed in
“bona fide executive, administrative, or professional” positions. 29 USC § 213, AS
23.10.055(9). An employer who claims an exemption from the FLSA has the burden of
showing that the exemption applies. Donovan v. Nekton, Inc., 703 F.2d 1148, 1151 (9th
Cir. 1983).

The FLSA is to be liberally construed to apply to the furthest reaches

consistent with Congressional direction.

FLSA exemptions are to be narrowly

construed against employers, and are to be withheld except as to persons plainly and
unmistakably within their terms and spirit. Klem v. County of Santa Clara, 208 F.3d 1085,
1089 (9th Cir. 2000).

The purposes of the Alaska Wage & Hour Act are to compensate those who
labored in excess of the statutory maximum number of hours, for the wear and tear of
extra work, and to spread employment by inducing employers to shorten hours because
of the pressure of extra cost. Janes v. Otis Engineering Corp., 757 P.2d 50 (Alaska 1998).
The burden is on the employer to prove an exemption. Dayhoff v. Temsco Helicopters, 848
P.2d 1367 (Alaska 1993). The burden of proof in the State case is proof beyond a
reasonable doubt. Fred Meyer v. Bailey, 100 P.3d 881, 884 (Alaska 2004). Both the
AWHA and the FLSA are to be liberally construed in favor of the employee. Whitesides
v. U-Haul, 16 P.3d 729, 732 (Alaska 2001).
The Federal regulation applicable to this case, described as the “short test,”
defines an employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity as an employee
who
a)
is compensated on a salary basis at a
rate of at least $250.00 per week, per week;
b)
whose primary duty consists of the
performance of office or non-manual work directly
related to management policies or general business
operations of his employer or his employer’s
customers; and
c)
whose duties include work requiring
the exercise of discretion and independent
judgment.
29 CFR § 541.2.
Thus, APC Natchiq, Inc. must prove that Plaintiff Gilbert meets all of the
requirements in this regulation before he can be held exempt from coverage under the
FLSA as an exempt administrative employee.

The state regulation addressing administrative employees is 8 AAC 15.910(a)(1),
which in pertinent part requires that
(1) an “administrative employee” mean an employee
(A) whose primary duty consists of work directly
related to management policies or supervising the general
business operation of the employer;
(B) who customarily and regular exercises discretion
and independent judgment;
(C) who performs work only under general
supervision;
(D) who is paid on a salary or fee basis;
(E) who regularly and directly assists the proprietor
or an exempt executive employee of the employer; and
(F) who performs work along specialized or technical
lines requiring special training, experience or knowledge
and does not devote more than 20 percent…. Of the
employee’s weekly hours to activities that are not described
in this paragraph or (7) or (11) of this section [executive or
professional employee duties].
8 AAC 15.910(a)(1).
The key parallel provisions of these tests are that an exempt employee’s work
must be directly related to management policies or the general business operations of
his employer, and that the work requires the exercise of discretion and independent
judgment. Plaintiff Gilbert’s position as Safety Specialist meets neither of these two
important tests.
What Gilbert Did
Gilbert’s duties are best described by his daily logs (submitted as Exhibit A).
Additionally submitted by the employer is a job description (exhibit B). Gilbert did not
see his job description prior to the filing of a lawsuit in this matter, which he generally
agreed with the description as being at least partly descriptive of his job duties. Gilbert

states that his job as Safety Supervisor was essentially the same as a Safety Specialist,
doing most of his job duties in the office. See Gilbert Deposition, Exhibit D, p.32
through 41, line 18, p.152 through 166; and Affidavit of Gilbert filed with this motion.
Plaintiff’s Interrogatory No. 1 asked for Defendant’s explanation as to why Gilbert is
exempt (see pages 1-4 of Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s First Discovery requests,
attached as exhibit C).

Defendant answers conclusively referring to the Safety

Supervisor position description amount to about six lines of text.1
29 CFR § 541.205 discusses the definition of “directly related to management
policies or general business operations.” This phrase describes those types of activities
relating to the administrative operations of his business, as distinguished from
production. 29 CFR § 541.205. Gilbert was, in fact, involved in production.
One of the significant field duties that Gilbert would perform dealt with confined
space entry and hot work permits. As part of this process in doing confined space entry
permits, he would “sniff” out vacuum truck. He would take a gauge, which could read
various chemical gases and ensure that the levels of the gases were safe for entry. He
would also ensure that other safety procedures were in place to ensure continued safe
Plaintiff notes that these requests were answered after February 17, 2006, almost three years after
termination of Gilbert’s employment and nearly three years after filing the lawsuit. It seems, even at this
late date, that defendant APC had no idea what category of exemption Gilbert fit into. Administrative?
Professional? Executive?. Furthermore, even at this juncture, it is not clear to APC as to what purported
exempt category he might be in. Indeed, Gilbert’s deposition around the first of June 2006, defendant
APC changed their position of saying that Gilbert was exempt under the administrative, professional,
and executive exemptions to Gilbert being only exempt under the administrative exception, with a
possible fall back position of Gilbert being a, “supervisory employee” under the State law. See Smith
Deposition, Exhibit F, p.59 through p.61. Not only does this indicate that APC has no comprehensive
idea of why Gilbert was exempt, but also further fuels Gilbert’s motion to establish a lack of good faith
and it’s willful violation of the FLSA. Again, as a litigation strategy, “shot gunning” the exemption
categories may make sense, but from the point of view of attempting to demonstrate good faith or lack of
recklessness, it is clear evidence of conduct indicative of the defendant’s attempt to evade the act(s).

Sometimes employees entering the tanks would have to wear breathing

apparatus, there would have to be other employees stationed outside in case of
emergency, continuing ventilation may be necessary in order to keep the vessels below
acceptable levels for entry. In doing this, Gilbert was assisting the production of the oil
field.
29 CFR § 541.205(c)(1) …. [I]t is clear that bookkeepers,
secretaries, and clerks of various kinds hold the run-of-themine positions in an ordinary business and are not
performing work directly related to management policies
or general business operations. On the other hand, a tax
consultant employed either by an individual company or
by a firm of consultants is ordinarily doing work of
substantial importance to the management and the
operation of the business.
(2) …. A messenger boy who is entrusted with
carrying large sums of money or securities cannot be said
to be doing work of importance to the business, even
though serious consequences may flow from his neglect.
An employee operating very expensive equipment may
cause serious loss to his employer by the improper
performance of his duties. An inspector, such as, for
example, an inspector an insurance company, may cause
loss to his employer by the failure to perform his job
properly.
But such employees, obviously are not
performing work of substantial importance to the
management of the business that it can be said to be
“directly related to management policies or general
business operations” as that phrase is used in § 541.2.
(3) Some firms employee persons whom they
describe as “statisticians.” If all such a person does, in
effect, is to tabulate data, he is clearly not exempt.
However, if such an employee makes analysis of data and
draws conclusions which are important to the
determination of, or which, in fact determine financial,
merchandising, or other policy, clearly he is doing work
directly related to management policies or general business
operations. Similarly, a personnel employee may be a clerk
at a hiring window of a plant, or he may be a man who

determines or affects personnel employees affecting all the
workers in the establishment. In the latter case, he is clearly
doing work directly related to management policies and
general business operations. These examples illustrate the
two extremes. In each case, between these extreme types
are the many employees whose work may be of substantial
importance to management or operation of the business,
depending on the particular facts. 29 CFR § 541.205(c)(1-3).
Gilbert in his job did not affect policy. As a safety specialist, Gilbert encouraged
compliance with the safety rules. As a general rule, he did not write the safety rules,
and he never authorized exceptions to them.
29 CFR § 541.205(b) provides that
(B) The administrative operations of the business
include the work performed by so-called white-collar
employees engaged in “servicing” a business as, for
example, advising the management, planning, negotiating,
representing the company, purchasing, promoting sales,
and business research and control… 29 CFR § 541.205(b).
Gilbert did little or none of these things.
Primary Duty
The primary duty of an administrative employee is discussed under 29 CFR §
541.206, which incorporates by reference the primary duty definition for an executive
under 29 CFR § 541.103. That section indicates that, generally, in order for a duty to be
an employee’s primary duty, the major part (or over 50%) of the employee’s time is
spent in the performance of managerial duties. While not completely definitive, this is a
useful guideline. There may be other circumstances where an employee exercises his
discretionary powers during the balance of the rest of his time, and therefore his

Filed 08/04/2006

primary duty may be considered management.

Page 9 of 15

In this instance, Gilbert spent the

primary amount of his time as a Safety Supervisor doing office Safety Specialist duties.
Discretion and Independent Judgment
29 CFR § 541.207 discusses discretion and independent judgment.
(a) … The term [discretion and independent
judgment] as used in the regulations of subpart A of this
part, more over, implies that the person has the authority or
power to make an independent choice, free from immediate
direction or supervision and with respect to matters of
significance….
(b) The term must be applied in the light of all the
facts involved in the particular employment situation in
which the question arises. It has been most frequently
misunderstood and misapplied by employers and
employees in cases involving the following: (1) Confusion
between the exercise of discretion and independent
judgment, and the use of skill in applying techniques,
procedures, or specific standards; and (2) misapplication of
the term to employees making decisions relating to matters
of little importance.
(c) Distinguished from skills and procedures:
(1) … An employee who merely applies his
knowledge in following prescribed procedures or
determining which procedure to follow, or who determines
whether specified standards are met or whether an object
falls into one or another of a number of definite grades,
classes, or other categories, with or without the use of
testing or measuring devices, is not exercising discretion
and independent judgment within the meaning of § 541.2.
This is true even if there is some leeway in reaching a
conclusion as when an acceptable standard includes a
range or tolerance above or below a specified standard.
(2) A typical example of the application of skills and
procedures is ordinary inspection work of various kinds.
Inspectors normally perform specialized work along
standardized lines involving well-established techniques
and procedures which may have been catalogued and
described in manuals or other sources. Such inspectors rely
on techniques and skills acquired by special training or

experience.
They may have some leeway in the
performance of their work, but only within closely
prescribed limits. Employees of this type may make
recommendations on the basis of the information they
develop in the course of their inspections (as for example,
to accept or reject an insurance risk for a product
manufactured
to
specifications),
but
these
recommendations are based on the development of the
facts as to whether there is conformity with the prescribed
standards. In such cases, a decision to depart from the
prescribed standards or the permitted tolerance is typically
made by the inspector’s supervisor. The inspector is
engaged in exercising skill rather than discretion and
independent judgment within the meaning of the
regulations in Subpart A of this part. 29 CFR § 541.207(a),
(b) and (c)(1) and (c)(2).
The regulation goes on to describe graders and checkers. The difference between
an exempt employee and a non-exempt employee is that a grader or checker inspector
will apply facts to a known standard. Potentially, an exempt employee would take the
data compiled from these inspections, analyze it, and then perhaps make decisions that
would change production and/or pricing.
Gilbert had no discretionary function of this nature. (See Affidavit of Gilbert,
Exhibit G). If there was to be any deviation from a safety or any other procedure, it
would be decided by someone further up the chain of command than Gilbert. Gilbert
was as a Safety Supervisor who performed predominately Safety Specialist duties. It
would also not be unreasonable or inaccurate to describe Gilbert as a Safety Inspector.
Zuber v. APC 144 F.Appx. 657, 658 (9th Cir. 2005).
The appendix to part 541, of 29 CFR, at page 228; lists various occupations.
Inspectors are addressed at 29 CFR § 541.108, 541.205, and 541.207, and safety directors

(emphasis added) are addressed at 541.201 and 541.205. Sections 541.108(e) through (g)
talk about examiners or checkers, who are part of a production operation rather than a
part of a supervisory function. Production was indeed Gilbert’s job. Section 541.207
discusses once again the issues of inspectors or graders or checkers under the heading
of “Discretion and Independent Judgment.” Section 205 includes comments concerning
both inspectors and safety directors. See 29 CFR 541.205(c)(2) and (3) above. Further in
this regulation:
(5) The test of “directly related to management
policies or general business operations” is also met by
many persons employed as advisory specialists and
consultants to various kinds. Credit managers, safety
directors, claims agents and adjustors, wage rate analysts,
tax experts, account executives of advertising agencies,
customers, brokers, and stock exchange firms, promotion
men, and many others. 29 CFR § 541.205(c)(5). (Emphasis
added.)
Here the regulation includes the safety director as an exempt employee. Gilbert
was not a safety director. He was a rank-and-file safety inspector. The regulations
indicate that a director is exempt, and an inspector is non-exempt.
The safety director is also mentioned in 29 CFR § 541.201(a)(2)(ii): “Typical
examples of such employees are credit managers, purchasing agents, buyers, safety
directors, personnel directors, and labor relations directors.” (Emphasis added.) Clearly,
Gilbert’s position is not of the same category as those mentioned in this regulation.
Perhaps Doug Smith, as the HSC Manager, might be closer to a position of HSC

director, (see organizational chart, Exhibit E), yet Gilbert never was in that role.2 These
regulations clearly exclude Gilbert and his position as Safety Specialist/Safety
Supervisor from the exemption under the FLSA.
The Secretary of Labor’s interpretation of her own regulation3 is entitled to
deference and is controlling unless “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with regulation.”

Dayhoff v. Temsco Helicopters Inc. (Alaska 1993) discusses exemptions under the
ASHA and FLSA:
The AWHA is based upon the Fair Labor Standards
Act and the Federal interpretations of the FLSA are relevant
in interpreting the AWHA. McGinnis v. Stevens, 543 P.2d
1221, 1238-39 (Alaska 1975), appeal after remand, 570 P.2d
735 (Alaska 1977). Under the Federal law, the employer
has the burden to prove the exemption is applicable. Reeves
v. International Tel. & Tel. Corp., 357 F. Supp 295, 298 (WD
La. 1973), Aff’d, 616 F.2d 1342 (Fifth Circuit 1980), cert
denied, 449 U.S. 1077, 101 Supreme Court 857, 66 L.Ed. 2d
800 (1981).” “Exemptions are to be narrowly construed
against the employer.” Id. At 297. “If there is a reasonable
doubt as to whether the employee meets the criteria for
exemption, the employee should be ruled non-exempt.”
Adam v. United States, 26 Cl.Ct 782, 786 (Cl.Ct 1992). All
four elements must be met before an employee is found
Even if the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to the defendant, and that from time to time,
Gilbert was called the HSC Manager, and the Court would rule that an HSC Manager is an HSC Director;
Gilbert, whether anointed, with such title (of which there is no evidence), was not performing the duties
of that position and defendant’s have no substantive proof to that effect; and not to mention no proof
beyond a reasonable doubt to that effect. (See also Affidavit of Gilbert, Exhibit D).
3 The Federal Department of Labor regulations are split into two categories, the general regulations
(Subpart A) and the interpretive regulations (Subpart B). See 29 CFR § 541 Table of Contents at page 178

exempt. Id. Dayhoff v. Temsco Helicopters Inc., 848 P.2d 1367
(Alaska 1993).
The primary duties test under Federal law is oftentimes used when the factors of
state law are nearly identical and there is no authority interpreting state law. Webster
247 F.3d 917.
A long-standing Wage & Hour case that pertained to a position somewhat
similar to Mr. Gilbert’s job as a Safety Specialist dealt with a “field inspector” position
evaluated in O’Dell v. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, 856 F.2d 1142 (9th Cir. 1988).
Gilbert would maintain that the position held by O’Dell was significantly more of a
managerial type job than his position as Safety Specialist or Safety Supervisor. O’Dell’s
duties as a field inspector were described as follows:
Alyeska field inspectors work without supervision at
remote field locations along the pipeline. They maintain
daily contact with their supervisors by telephone. When a
field inspector determines that work fails to satisfy
minimum standards set out in “control documents,” he is
to attempt to handle the discrepancy onsite by negotiation
with the project supervisor. If a discrepancy cannot be
resolved onsite, the filed [sic] inspector documents the
problem and refers it to his supervisor or the Alyeska
engineering department, making recommendations for
waivers of specification if necessary. It is undisputed that
field inspectors can reject work if it is deemed
unacceptable. They can review and override the decisions
of quality control inspectors employed by contractors. In
1982 and 1983 Alyeska field inspectors helped develop
guidelines for inspection procedures. O’Dell at 1453.
O’Dell had the authority to override decisions of quality control inspectors and also
make recommendations for waiver of specification. Those are the types of duties which
would tend to lead one to believe an individual was exempt.

Case 3:03-cv-00174-RRB

Page 14 of 15

In any event, in O’Dell the court found O’Dell to be exempt. However, in doing
so the court ignored the applicable Department of Labor guideline regulations, citing
Hoyt v. General Insurance Co. of America, 249 F.2d 589, 590 (9th Cir. 1957). O’Dell and Hoyt
were both overruled in Auer v. Robbins, 419 U.S. 452, 461 (1997), as recognized in Webster
at 914. All this clearly stated in Bothell v. Phase Metrics, 299 F.3d 1120, 1129 (9th Cir.
2002). Clearly, there is controlling authority to say that a field inspector position is a
non-exempt position.
Controlling Ninth Circuit authority indicates that “field inspectors” are nonexempt employees. The field inspector in O’Dell has significantly more authority, and
was more similar to a managerial employee, than Gilbert was in the instant case.
Therefore, the controlling authority of Auer, O’Dell, and Webster require the court to find
that Plaintiff Gilbert, as a safety specialist or “safety inspector,”4 is a non-exempt
employee.
CONCLUSION
The burden of proof is on the defendant to show that Gilbert is beyond a
reasonable doubt an exempt employee. There is a presumption that he is not exempt.
The purported evidence of the defendant is paltry and clearly insufficient to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that Gilbert was an exempt employee as a Safety Supervisor.
This is true in general, however especially and specifically if one looks at the 20% test,

there is absolutely no evidence, of any type, of hourly breakdown specific to Gilbert,
and what he did to demonstrate an exemption.
Controlling 9th Cir. Authority, requires The Court to rule in plaintiff’s favor in
this regard. The O’dell case and associated cases show that a quality control inspector is
a nonexempt position.

Additionally, Auer, The Supreme Court authority says that

O’dell was initially wrongly decided. The Courts are bound to follow the administrative
regulation classifications found in the CFRs. The CFRs clearly define Safety Specialists
as exempt (especially in light of Zuber decision) the regulations do classify Safety
Directors as nonexempt.
Director.

There is no evidence to show that Gilbert was a Safety

The controlling law, both through O’dell and the CFRs favor Gilbert.

Especially when viewed in light of a substantial burden on the defendant and the proof
beyond a reasonable doubt requirement of state law.
