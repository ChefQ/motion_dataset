OMNIBUS MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT/CHANGE OF ADDRESS NOTICE

Comes now, Plaintiff, Lester Jon Ruston, and files this, his
Omnibus Motion to Amend Complaint, pursuant to Rule 15 Fed.Rul.Civ.P.
and his Change of Address Notice, and would show this Honorable Court
as follows: .

I.

Since the filing of this complaint, Defendants have conspired to
violate Texas Penal Code 0x00A7's 32.43, 32.46, 32.47, 20.02, 36.06 and
Chapter 31 Texas Penal Code "Witness Tampering", which is now "public
record" in Ruston v. Collin County, et al. 07-02829 in District Court
101st, Dallas County, Texas, which clearly shows cause why this Court
should issue injunctive relief against Defendants. Further, Defendants
did meet and conspire to incarcerate Plaintiff in a penitentiary,
despite the fact that he is not a convicted criminal, despite the Court's
holdings in Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71 (1992) and Jones v. Blanas,
393 F.3d 918 (9th Cir. 2004). Defendants have done so without statutory
authority, as held in McCann v. Cunningham, 315 F.Supp. 150 (DNH 2004),
despite the fact that Congress has forbidden this action in Lono v.
Fenton, 581 F.2d 645 (7th Cir. 1978). Further, Defendant's are conspiring
with the F.B.I. to deny Plaintiff access to information, in violation
of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 701-706, which allows

Judicial Review, pursuant to the Court's holdings in Center for Auto

 

Safety v. Tieman, 414 F.Supp. 215 (D.C. Dist. 1976) and Seafarers Int'l.
Union v. United StatesCoast Guard, 736 F.2d 19 (2nd Cir. 1984). The
Defendant's claim this complaint has no merit, despite the Supreme
Court's holding in Davis v. United Stats, 417 U.S. 333-344-455 (1974).
Case 2:06-cv-00526-DB-DN Document 26 Filed 05/11/2007 Page2of3

Il.

Defendants are conspiring with the Justice Department to punish
Plaintiff, in retaliation for this civil action, despite the Supreme
Court's holding in Deshaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services,
489 U.S. 189 (1989), due to their criminal insanity.

IIL.

Plaintiff's new address is P.O. Box 880, Ayer, Mass. 01432,
42 Patton Road, Devens, Mass. 01434 (978) 796-1000.

Wherefore, premises considered, Plaintiff, Lester Jon Ruston,
does file this, his Omnibus Amendment to Complaint and Notice of
Change of Address, pursuant to Rule 15 Fed.R.Civ.P., and does request
Judicial Notice of such, pursuant to Rule/201 Fed.Rul.Evidence.
