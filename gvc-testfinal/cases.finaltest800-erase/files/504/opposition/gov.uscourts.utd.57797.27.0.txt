ARGUMENT
Plaintiff’s complaint may not be amended without leave of court. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
15(a). The motion should be denied because any amendment would be futile. See Trujillo v.
Williams, 465 F.3d 1210, 1224 (10th Cir. 2006). As explained in the Church Defendants’
pending motion to dismiss, filed on November 15, 2006 (Doc. # 11), Plaintiff’s complaint,
amended or not, is clearly barred by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1915.
Accordingly, the Church Defendants request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s motion to amend and
grant the motion to dismiss.
DATED this 12th day of June, 2007.
