PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS THE
COMPLAINT
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff brings this civil rights action against the City of New York and two New
York City Police Officers alleging that, on June 17, 2010, defendants violated his rights under 42
U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by falsely arresting
him for trespass, using excessive force on him and illegally strip searching him. The false charge
was dismissed when the District Attorney’s Office declined prosecution.
Defendants argue in their motion to dismiss that the monetary settlement in
Lamont Tromp v. City of New York, Police Officers John Does 1-3, 10 CV 4973 (ILG) (JO)
(E.D.N.Y.) (hereinafter, Tromp I), released defendants from liability in the case now pending
before Your Honor (hereinafter, “Tromp II”), a different case addressing an entirely different
incident and involving different police officers.
For the following reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.

ARGUMENT
A.

The Terms of the Settlement in Tromp I Preclude the Settlement from Being Used
in Tromp II.
The language in the So Ordered Stipulation of Settlement and Order of Dismissal

in Tromp I, which defense counsel has not presented to this Court, is as follows:
In consideration for the payment of this sum [$17,500], plaintiff agrees to
dismissal with prejudice of all the claims against the named defendant, the City of
New York, and to release all defendants, including the defendants named herein
as “Police Officers John Does 1-3.” and all present and former employees or
agents of the City of New York, or any agency thereof, including, but not limited
to, the New York City Police Department, from any and all liability, claims or
rights of action which were or could have been alleged in this action, including all
claims for costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees.
Stipulation of Settlement and Order of Dismissal in Tromp I, docket entry # 11, at ¶ 2.
The terms of the Stipulation of Settlement and Order of Dismissal in Tromp I
precludes it from being used in any way in this case, Tromp II. Paragraph 4 of the stipulation,
which the City’s own lawyers drafted, states that “this stipulation shall not be admissible in,
nor is it related to, any other litigation or settlement negotiations.”
The parties’ intention in Tromp I to limit the settlement to the incident at issue in
that case is further demonstrated by the third sentence of the Stipulation of Settlement and Order
of Dismissal, at page 1, which states: “Whereas, the parties now desire to resolve the issues
raised in this litigation, without further proceedings and without admitting any fault or
liability[.]”
Accordingly, defendants’ motion should be denied because the language in the
settlement agreement upon which they rely is inadmissible in this case and because the language
demonstrates that the settlement is confined to the “issues raised” in Tromp I.

B.

The Settlement Documents in Tromp I Cannot Be Properly Read to Cover Tromp

II.
As explained in the civil rights case of Mandal, et al., v. City of New York, et al.,
No. 02 Civ. 1234, 2008 WL 754666 (S.D.N.Y. March 17, 2008),
A release is a species of contract and ‘is governed by the principles of contract
law.’ Although the scope and validity of a release of a federal claim are governed
by federal law, a federal court looks to state law to determine the content of that
federal law. Under New York law, the Court must give effect to the intent of the
parties to a contract as revealed by the language that they used. When the
contract is a release, the New York cases permit its enforcement only to the extent
that it contains an ‘explicit, unequivocal statement of a present promise to release
[a party] from liability.’ In considering the reach of a particular disputed
provision, a court must examine the entire structure of the agreement and attempt
to reconcile its various provisions. Thus, in this case the ‘[s]ettlement
[a]greement ... must be read as a whole,’ keeping in mind the controversy being
settled and the purpose for which the release was given.
Id. at *2 (internal citations omitted) (brackets and ellipses in original).
The court in Mandal further explained:
If a term in the release is ambiguous, the court may consider extrinsic evidence to
determine the intent of the parties. On the other hand, if the language used is
unambiguous, the court must avoid the temptation to redraft it to make it comply
with the court’s sense of equity. The release ‘may not be read to cover matters
which the parties did not intend to cover.’
Id. at *3 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). As explained in Mandal, “to the extent
that the release is subject to two conflicting interpretations, the Court must adopt the narrower
of the two possible interpretations.” Id. at *3 (citing Bank of N.Y. v Amoco Oil Co., 35 F.3d 643,
662 (2d Cir. 1994) (emphasis added)).
Applying the aforesaid principles, the court in Mandal found that the language of
the release used by the City of New York did not bar a second civil rights lawsuit by the plaintiff
in that case. Id. at **3-4.

Here, dismissal would be improper because the language in the Tromp 1
settlement papers stating that plaintiff releases the defendants in that case to claims “which were
or could have been alleged in this action” cannot reasonably be interpreted as an intention to
release a different set of police officers from liability for a different incident which City lawyers
did not even know about when they drafted the release. Plaintiff’s position is supported by the
unambiguous terms included by the City in the Stipulation of Settlement and Order of Dismissal
in Tromp I that the settlement agreement “shall not be admissible in, nor is it related to, any other
litigation or settlement negotiations” and that the parties only wish to “resolve the issues raised
in this litigation,” i.e. Tromp I.
Even if the Court finds that the language in the Tromp 1 settlement is ambiguous,
it was certainly not the parties’ intention to release the defendants in Tromp II from liability;
indeed, they were not even discussed. Where there is ambiguity in a contract, a jury trial is
required to resolve the factual issue of intent. See Burger King Corp. v. Horn & Hardart Co.,
893 F.2d 525, 528 (2d Cir. 1990) (“Summary judgment normally is inappropriate when a
contractual term is ambiguous because a triable issue of fact exists as to its interpretation.”);
Topps Co., Inc. v. Cadbury Stani S.A.I.C., 526 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 2008) (Summary judgment is
appropriate only when the contractual language is “wholly unambiguous.”).
The Court is not presented here with a situation where very broad language was
used in a release which unambiguously demonstrates that the parties intended to release a set of
defendants from all claims, even those that are unrelated to the first case, from the “beginning of
the world to the date of the release.” Cf . Graham v. Empire Bail Bonds, No. 09 CV 1635, 2010
WL 1849295, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 7, 2010) (granted defendants release “from all actions,
causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money ... from the beginning of the world to the day
4

Case 1:11-cv-02794-JBW-RLM Document 12 Filed 08/04/11 Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 75

of the date of this release” and where subsequent case “arises out of the same set of facts” as the
first case); Borah, Goldstein, Altschuler & Schwartz, P.C., No. 99 Civ. 3227, 2002 WL 1610923,
at **5-6 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2002) (“very broad language” granted defendant release of “all
claims arising from the beginning of time to date.”).
Finally, this Court should be mindful of the well-established principles that any
ambiguities in a contract are to be interpreted against the drafter, here, the City of New York.
Agway, Inc. v. Agway Petroleum Corp., No. 93 CV 557, 1993 WL 771008, at *1 (N.D.N.Y. Dec.
6, 1993), and that on a motion to dismiss, the court is required to draw all factual inferences in
favor of the non-moving party.
Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny defendants’ motion to dismiss.
