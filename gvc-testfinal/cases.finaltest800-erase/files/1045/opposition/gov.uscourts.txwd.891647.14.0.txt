Plaintiff Mark Koshnick (“Koshnick”) files this combined Response to Defendant
City of Lakeway’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 8) and Defendant City of Bee Cave’s Motion
to Dismiss (Doc. 9).1 The Cities’ motions should be denied for the following reasons:
I.

INTRODUCTION

In the early morning on September 12, 2015, Mark Koshnick had just finished
showering in an upstairs bathroom of his home and was preparing to go to sleep when
officers from the City of Lakeway and the City of Bee Cave (the “Cities”) forcibly entered
his home, including using a battering ram to break down the front door. (Pl.’s Orig.
Complaint at ¶¶ 8–9) (Doc. 1). Koshnick ran to the top of his stairs to see what was
unfolding, and as he stood there, officers grabbed Koshnick and dragged him down the
stairs, ultimately handcuffing him and placing him in a squad car. (Id. at ¶9). Although
City of Lakeway police had visited Koshnick’s home earlier to investigate a domestic
situation in which they suspected Koshnick had been hurt, Koshnick confirmed that he
and the home’s other occupants were safe, at which point the City of Lakeway police left,
obviously satisfied that the situation was under control. (Id. at ¶¶ 8,11). Nevertheless,
officers from both Cities returned, swarmed Koshnick’s home without warning, and
dragged Koshnick down his stairs and out of his home, using force where none was
necessary given that he was unarmed nonconfrontational, and was not resisting arrest.
(Id. at ¶ 9).

Because the City of Lakeway’s motion and the City of Bee Cave’s motion raise the same arguments and
commit the same errors of fact and law, and are presented with only slight differences, Koshnick responds
to both herein.

These police officers’ excessive use of force violated Koshnick’s constitutional
rights—including but not limited to depriving him of the right to bodily integrity and
liberty without due process of law—which physically, mentally, and emotionally injured
Koshnick. (Id. at ¶¶ 22, 24–28, 30–34). The Cities’ respective policymakers, the City of
Lakeway Police Department and the City of Bee Cave Police Department, made that
conduct possible through their policies and procedures. (Id.). They acted with deliberate
indifference to the unreasonable risk that something like this could happen to Koshnick
and others. (Id.). Further, the Cities’ respective police departments ratified the conduct of
these officers by failing to discipline officers based on this conduct and other complaints.
Koshnick filed suit against the Cities on September 1, 2017, and the Cities each
filed a motion to dismiss Koshnick’s complaint [“Complaint”] under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that:
(1)

Koshnick “clearly failed to allege any facts in his Complaint that could
support a claim” against them (Doc. 9 at 1), including arguing that no officer
violated the Constitution, thus precluding municipal liability. (Doc. 8 at 1);

(2)

that, although Koshnick filed his federal claim within the applicable twoyear limitations period, he should have further complied with Texas, not
federal, rules for service of process (Doc. 8 at 9; Doc. 9 at 10); and

(3)

the officers’ use of force could not have been excessive because the extent
of Koshnick’s injuries was not severe enough. (Doc. 8 at 8–10; Doc. 9 at 11).

As will be demonstrated in more detail below, these arguments are without merit,
and the Cities’ motions should be denied.

II.
A.

ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES

Standard and scope applicable to the Cities’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion.
Motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are viewed with disfavor and are rarely

granted. Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 231 (5th Cir. 2009). A complaint will not
be dismissed merely because it contains an imperfect statement of the legal theory
supporting the claim asserted. Johnson v. City of Shelby, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346 (2014). Federal
pleading rules simply call for “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleading is entitled to relief.” Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).
A court must first distill well-pleaded factual allegations, whose truth is presumed,
from any unsupported legal conclusions, whose truth cannot be assumed. See, e.g., Doe v.
Robertson, 751 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 2014). When there are well-pleaded factual allegations,
a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise
to an entitlement to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009); see also Baker v. Putnal, 75
F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996) (Well-pleaded facts are to be viewed “in the light most favorable
to the plaintiff.”). A complaint fails if it offers only “naked assertions devoid of further
factual enhancement.” Id. at 678. Importantly, the Court should not evaluate the merits of
the allegation, but satisfy itself only that the plaintiff has adequately pled a legally
cognizable claim. United States ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke’s Episcopal Hosp., 355 F.3d 370, 376 (5th
Cir. 2004).
Importantly here, “[a] district court is limited to considering the contents of the
pleadings and the attachments thereto when deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule
12(b)(6).” Villarreal v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 814 F.3d 763, 766 (5th Cir. 2016); Great Plains

3

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 6 of 23

Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 314 (5th Cir. 2002); Collins v.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498–99 (5th Cir. 2000). Thus, any basis for
dismissing Koshnick’s claims that relies on facts not shown on the face of the complaint
is misplaced.
B.

As a threshold matter, Koshnick’s claims were timely filed.
The affirmative defense of limitations can be raised in a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.

Lucky v. Haynes, Civ. No. 3:14–CV–2915–L, 2015 WL 4525689, at *3 (N.D. Tex. 2015).
However, a motion to dismiss on a statute of limitations defense may only be granted
where it is evident from the complaint that the action is time-barred. Jones v. Alcoa, Inc.,
339 F.3d 359, 366 (5th Cir. 2003).
Here, there is no question that Koshnick’s federal claim was filed within the
applicable two-year limitations period. The Cities do not dispute this fact. (Lakeway Mot.
at 8; Bee Cave Mot. at 10). Instead, the Cities urge this Court to apply a provision for
service under Texas law that, even though Koshnick timely filed his complaint in
accordance with federal rules, would require him to show he exercised due diligence in
effecting service. (Id.). However, that state law requirement does not apply to Koshnick’s
federal claim and, even if it does, whether service was effected with due diligence is a
matter outside the four corners of the complaint.
In a federal action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”), state law determines
the length of the statute of limitations. Ponder v. City of Denton, Tex., Civ. No. 4:13-CV-17,
2014 WL 5364026, at *2–3 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 21, 2014); Jackson v. Duke, 259 F.2d 3, 6 (5th Cir.
1958). The Cities argue that Texas’ due diligence service rule should apply to the filing

4

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 7 of 23

requirements for a federal claim, citing a state court case that does not address a federal
claim filed in federal court—the circumstances involved here—but instead concerns a
state claim filed in state court. Ashley v. Hawkins, 293 S.W.3d 175, 179 (Tex. 2009) (Lakeway
Mot. at 8; Bee Cave Mot. at 10). The Fifth Circuit has applied this rule in the context of
Texas claims brought in federal court. Rogers v. Dunham, 478 Fed. Appx. 875, 877–78 (5th
Cir. 2012) (per curiam); Jackson v. Duke, 259 F.2d 3, 6 (5th Cir. 1958).
However, the United States Supreme Court has expressly refused to “require that
when a federal court borrows a statute of limitations to apply to a federal cause of action,
the statute of limitation’s provisions for service must necessarily also be followed.” West
v. Conrail, 481 U.S. 35, 39 (1987); see also Gonzales v. Wyatt, 157 F.3d 1016, 1021 n.1 (5th Cir.
1998) (concluding that federal case law excluding other federal claims from Texas’ due
diligence rule “would apply to any cause of action based on federal law, presumably
including federal court section 1983 actions.”). And although one federal court in Texas
court has applied the rule to a Section 1983 claim,2 federal courts in Texas have more often
held that “the Texas rule requiring due diligence in service [] does not apply to Section
1983 claims filed in federal court.” Vela v. City of Austin, Tex., Civ. No. 1-15-CV-1015-RP,
2016 WL 1583676, at *3 (W.D. Tex. 2016); see also Casas v. City of Fort Wort Police Dept., Civ.
No. 4:15-CV-872-O, 2017 WL 3638321, at *4 (N.D. Tex. May 17, 2017); Scott v. Cypress Creek
Emergency Med. Srvs., Civ. No. H-06-1436, 2007 WL 2209268, at *6 (S.D. Tex. July 27, 2007).

See S.D. Tex. Mcallen Div., Oscar Daniel Granados v. Brooks, Civ. No. 7:15-CV-256, 2015 WL 8618716, at *3
(S.D. Tex. 2015).
2

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 8 of 23

If a complaint is filed timely, then the claim is not barred. Id.; FED. R. CIV. P. 3;
McGuire v. Turnbo, 137 F.3d 321, 324 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding that the district court erred
in relying on Texas’ due diligence requirement in addition to the statute of limitations for
the plaintiff’s federal civil claim). In this case, because Koshnick’s Section 1983 claim was
undisputedly filed within Texas’ two-year limitations period for personal-injury torts, the
Cities’ motion in this regard must be denied. Ponder, 2014 WL 5364026, at *2–3.
But, assuming that Texas’s due diligence in service rule actually applied here, the
nature of that affirmative defense is not one that can be considered or ruled on based
solely on the complaint. Rather, by its very nature, the affirmative defense requires that
evidence outside the four corners of the complaint be considered. After all, if this affirmative
defense even applies here, it will require affidavit proof of the efforts taken to serve the
two Cities after the complaint was filed. Such evidence is not appropriate in the Rule
12(b)(6) context and therefore the Cities’ motion on this ground must be denied.
C.

Koshnick need not prove liability or establish that he prevails on his claims in
order to state a claim for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes.
Importantly, there is a difference between the facts that must be proven to support

municipal liability, and the facts necessary to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. After all, so
long as the complaint contains sufficient factual allegations, a court should not grant a
motion to dismiss simply because of an imperfect statement of the legal theory
supporting the claim. Groden v. City of Dallas, 826 F.3d 280, 284 (5th Cir. 2016); see also
Balle v. Nueces Cty., Tex., Civ. No. 16-40789, 2017 WL 2590512, at *4 (5th Cir. June 15, 2017).
Despite Lakeway’s contention that Koshnick’s complaint fails because it “does not

6

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 9 of 23

adequately identify” a policymaker, a policy, or a custom (Lakeway Mot. at 5–6),
Koshnick is not required at the dismissal stage to identify a specific policy making official
or the specific policy that caused the constitutional violation against him.
1.

Specific facts proving a policy are not necessary to give a municipality
fair notice of allegations from which misconduct can be inferred.

At the outset, the Cities’ recitation of the federal pleading standard is incomplete
as applied to municipal liability claims. (See Lakeway Mot. at 2–3; Bee Cave Mot. at 2–3).
In the context of municipal liability, as opposed to individual officer liability, it is
exceedingly rare that a plaintiff will have access to (or personal knowledge of) specific
details regarding the existence or absence of internal policies or training procedures prior
to discovery. Thomas v. City of Galveston, Tex., 800 F. Supp. 2d 826, 842 (S.D. Tex. 2011).
At the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal stage, when notice is the overriding concern, only minimal
allegations should be required, and because a plaintiff will generally not have access to
specific municipal policies, allegations need not specify what the policy is. Id. at 842–43.
In seeking to articulate a standard that provides fair notice to defendant
municipalities, and to reconcile U.S. Supreme Court opinions that created some confusion
as to the proper pleading standard for municipal liability claims,3 the court in Thomas
described the level of pleading necessary:

In Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, the United States Supreme Court
rejected a heightened pleading standard that the Fifth Circuit had applied to Section 1983 claims against
municipalities. Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993).
Meanwhile, in a general context, the Court in Twombly and Iqbal held that claims must be plausible on their
face, meaning “the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the
defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1940 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007). This created confusion among courts considering municipal liability
3

7

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 10 of 23

Allegations that provide such notice could include, but are not limited to,
past incidents of misconduct to others, multiple harms that occurred to the
plaintiff himself, misconduct that occurred in the open, the involvement of
multiple officials in the misconduct, or the specific topic of the challenged
policy or training inadequacy. Those types of details, or any other minimal
elaboration a plaintiff can provide, help to “satisfy the requirement of
providing not only ‘fair notice’ of the nature of the claim, but also ‘grounds’
on which the claim rests,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 n. 3, 127 S. Ct. 1955, and
also to “permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of
misconduct.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950.
Thomas, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 843–44 (footnotes omitted). As the court in Thomas explained:
This balance, requiring more than boilerplate allegations but not
demanding specific facts that prove the existence of a policy, is in line with
the approach of other courts post-Iqbal. Where a plaintiff provides more
than a boilerplate recitation of the grounds for municipal liability, and
instead makes some additional allegation to put the municipality on fair
notice of the grounds for which it is being sued, “federal courts and litigants
must rely on summary judgment and control of discovery to weed out
unmeritorious claims sooner rather than later.” Leatherman, 507 U.S. at 16869, 113 S. Ct. 1160.
Id. at 844–45 (footnote omitted); see also Schaefer v. Whitted, 121 F. Supp. 3d 701, 718 (W.D.
Tex. 2015).
2.

The identity of policymaking officials is a question of state law, and a
complaint need only allege facts showing that a policy for which the
municipality is arguably liable.

Recently, the Fifth Circuit in Groden v. City of Dallas, Texas reversed a district court
that had dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint because he “did not plead the identity of the
policymaker of the alleged city policy.” Groden, 826 F.3d at 283. The Fifth Circuit

claims, where a plaintiff is unlikely to have access to the specific policies that would support plausible
liability against a municipal entity. Thomas, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 842.

8

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 11 of 23

emphasized that the identity of the policymaker is a question of state law,4 and a plaintiff
need not supply an answer to a legal question in her complaint—it need not be pled. Id.
at 284–85 (citing City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 124 (1988) (plurality opinion)).
“[T]he complaint need only allege facts that show an official policy, promulgated or
ratified by the policymaker, under which the municipality is said to be liable.” Id. at 284;
see also Balle, 2017 WL 2590512, at *4.
Koshnick has alleged facts which implicate the legal elements of a claim against
each of the Cities, and state law will properly enable the Court to ascertain the identify of
the policymaker responsible for the policies in question. Koshnick alleged that the Cities:
enacted policies that enabled the constitutionally injurious conduct; failed to enforce
policies that would have prevented this conduct; or ratified the conduct by failing to
condemn it. (Complaint at ¶¶ 12–13; 23–36). Thus, Koshnick satisfied federal pleading
requirements with regard to his Monell claim.
The Cities’ characterization of Koshnick’s Complaint as “quite clearly [] presented
as an attempt to use a respondeat superior approach to establishing liability against the
City” is simply incorrect. (Lakeway Mot. at 5; see also Bee Cave Mot. at 10). A plaintiff
asserting a Section 1983 claim does not rely on vicarious liability (respondeat superior)
because it is the “official policy or custom” of a municipality that is alleged to have caused

State law designates policymakers through state statutes, and through local ordinances and regulations.
Bolton v. City of Dallas, Tex., 541 F.3d 545, 550 (5th Cir. 2008) (consulting the Texas Government Code to
determine the policymaker for Texas cities); Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 1241, 1245 (5th Cir. 1993)
(consulting the Texas Educational Code to determine the policymaker for Texas school districts); Praprotnik,
485 U.S. at 125 (local ordinances and regulations.).
4

9

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 12 of 23

his constitutional deprivation. This is precisely what Koshnick has alleged and, as such,
the Cities’ motions should be denied. (Lakeway Mot. at 3; see generally Complaint).
D.

Koshnick alleged facts giving rise to the reasonable inference that the Cities
caused his constitutional injuries.
A municipality may be sued under Section 1983 “if it is alleged to have caused a

constitutional tort through a policy statement, ordinance, regulations, or decision
officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers.” Zarnow v. City of Wichita
Falls, 614 F.3d 161, 166 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 121).5 Even where
an officially adopted and promulgated policy does not appear to authorize the conduct
at issue, a municipality is still subject to a 1983 claim that alleges “a persistent,
widespread practice of city officials or employees, which . . . is so common and well
settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.” Thomas v. City
of Galveston, Tex., 800 F. Supp. 2d 826, 842 (S.D. Tex. 2011) (quoting Brown v. Bryan County,
219 F.3d 450, 457 (5th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted)).
1.

Koshnick’s injuries need not reach a certain severity for the police
officers’ use of force to be excessive.

The Cities contend that Koshnick can show no municipal liability for policies that
enable the Cities’ police officers to use excessive force because “the Complaint establishes
no more than a de minimus injury for which there may be no recovery.” [Lakeway Mot.
at 8; Bee Cave Mot. at 11). The Cities cite the Fifth Circuit’s previous holding that “[t]o

Under a Monell claim, a municipality is subject to liability when the plaintiff shows (1) an official policy;
(2) promulgated by a final policymaker; (3) that is a moving force behind the violation of the constitutional
right. Peterson v. City of Fort Worth, 588 F.3d 838, 847 (5th Cir. 2009); Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of the City
of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).
5

10

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 13 of 23

state a claim for excessive use of force, the plaintiff’s asserted injury must be more than
de minimis.” Freeman v. Gore, 483 F.3d 404, 417 (5th Cir. 2007).
“Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly correlated, and it is the latter that
ultimately counts.” Wilkins v. Gaddy, 559 U.S. 34, 38 (2010). The United States Supreme
Court in Gaddy expressly rejected using the extent of injury as the barometer of whether
a plaintiff has stated a claim for the excessive use of force: “An inmate who is gratuitously
beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely
because he has the good fortune to escape without serious injury.” Id. While the lower
court determined that the plaintiff failed to state a claim because “he simply has not
alleged that he suffered anything more than de minimus [sic] injury,” the Supreme
Court’s review of that decision was simple—“No.” Id. The force directed at a plaintiff is
not itself de minimis when it causes a discernible injury. Id.; Hudson v. McMillian, 929 F.2d
1014, 1015 (1990) (per curiam).6
Accordingly, the Lakeway and Bee Cave police officers’ use of force could not
cease to be excessive merely by declaring that Koshnick’s injuries should have been more
severe. Koshnick’s injuries were—and are—discernible, and the force that Koshnick
alleged caused such injury was excessive. The Complaint alleged: “As a direct result of

Koshnick has alleged that the Cities’ actions violated his substantive due process rights through the
Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and although these cases discuss excessive use of force in
the context of Eighth Amendment violations, the same reasoning applies to excessive use of force claims
generally. U.S. v. Daniels, 281 F.3d 168, 179 (5th Cir. 2002) (“[A] claim of excessive force by a law
enforcement officer is correctly examined under the same standard regardless whether the claim arises
under the Eighth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment.”) (citing Valencia v. Wiggins, 981 F.2d 1440
(5th Cir.1993)). Thus, while different standards govern whether the manner in which force was applied
under the circumstances violated the relevant constitutional provision, the inquiry in excessive force claims
is “not whether a certain quantum of injury was sustained.” Gaddy, 559 U.S. at 37.
6

11

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 14 of 23

the physical abuses, Plaintiff suffered, and continues to suffer, serious mental, emotional,
and physical injuries.” (Complaint at ¶ 34). These physical abuses occurred, as alleged,
when police officers dragged Koshnick down a flight of stairs, subduing him before
placing him in handcuffs. (Complaint at ¶¶ 9, 11). Thus, Koshnick has alleged discernible
injuries sufficient to state a claim.
2.

Koshnick’s Complaint sufficiently alleges that his constitutional injuries
resulted from the Cities’ official policies, customs, or practices.

Municipal liability results if a deprivation of constitutional rights was inflicted
pursuant to official custom or policy. Webster v. City of Houston, 735 F.2d 838, 842 (5th Cir.
1984) (en banc). Official policy is ordinarily contained in duly promulgated policy
statements, ordinances or regulations. Id. But a policy may also be evidenced by custom,
that is: a persistent, widespread practice of City officials or employees, which, although
not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and wellsettled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy. Id. Even a facially
innocuous policy will support liability if it was promulgated with deliberate indifference
to the known or obvious consequences that constitutional violations would result.
Piotrowsky v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 579 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing and quoting Bd. of
Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407 (1997)). This policy must also be the
moving force behind the violation. Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.
Here, Koshnick’s Complaint alleges among other things that the unlawful conduct
of the Lakeway and Bee Cave police officers included dragging Koshnick down a flight
of stairs without warning while:

12

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 15 of 23

•

Koshnick was “not a suspect;”

•

Koshnick was himself “the alleged victim of the initial domestic
disturbance call to the police dispatcher;”

•

Koshnick was “compliant and non-confrontational;”

•

Koshnick “did not make any gestures or efforts to evade or escape
the police officers;”

•

Koshnick “did not resist the commands of the officers and he did not
have any device or instrumentality in his hands which might have
been considered a weapon;”

•

Koshnick “did not actively or passively resist arrest;”

•

Koshnick, though handcuffed and placed in a squad car, “was never
arrested;” and

•

Using excessive force and escalating the situation “beyond the use of
verbal orders or controls” without objective or subjective reason to
do so.

(Complaint at ¶¶ 9, 11).7 It was this conduct that Koshnick alleges occurred as a result of
persistent, widespread practices so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom
that fairly represents the Cities’ written and unwritten policies and evidences a deliberate
indifference to the harms people like Koshnick were likely to suffer:
There is a pattern of misconduct originating from a failure to hire, train,
discipline or supervise the police officers of the City of Lakeway Police
Department and the City of Bee Cave Police Department. The practices of
the Officers, while not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated
policy and/or procedure, are so common and well settled as to constitute a

It is worth noting that Bee Cave’s Motion appears to justify what may appear as “deliberate indifference”
in failing to adopt a policy by arguing that the police officers’ entry into the home was justified. (Bee Cave
Mot. at 9–10). First, it is not the officers’ entry into his home that Koshnick alleges was excessive use of
force. Second, as explained further below, Koshnick did not allege a “failure to adopt a policy” as a basis
for his claim. Accordingly, Koshnick disputes these misrepresentations.

custom that fairly represents the policies of the respective cities over the
past five years.
The conduct described herein is strongly indicative of a situation of
endemic malfeasance at the administrative levels of the City of Lakeway
and the City of Bee Cave as well as the respective police departments. The
customs, patterns, policies (written and unwritten) show the Defendants’
calculated and callous disregard for the Constitutional rights and privileges
guaranteed to all United States Citizens, including the Plaintiff.
(Complaint at ¶¶15–16). Thus, the Complaint alleges that multiple officials in two Cities’
police departments were involved in the misconduct and specifies the topic of the
challenged policy. Such allegations provide sufficient detail to give the Cities fair notice
of the nature of the claim against them and the grounds on which the claim rests, while
permitting the court to “infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.” Thomas, 800
F. Supp. 2d at 843–44 (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950); Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 n. 3).

Koshnick’s pleading sufficiently alleges that his injuries originated from
the Cities’ failures in hiring, training, and supervising its police officers.

In addition to sufficiently identifying an official policy, custom or practice,
Plaintiff also alleges a claim for wrongful hiring, supervision, training, and discipline.
Failing to train municipal employees can also constitute a “policy” of the municipality.
City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989). Such a policy may be evident when the
officers’ assigned duties make “the need for more or different training [] so obvious, and
the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the
policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to
the need.” Id. at 390. For instance, because “city policymakers know to a moral certainty”
that arresting fleeing felons is part of police officers’ assigned duties, meaning that a

14

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 17 of 23

failure to train them on the “constitutional limits of the use of deadly force” shows
“deliberate indifference.” Id. at 390 n.10. Alternately, if officers repeatedly violate
constitutional rights, the need for further training becomes “plainly obvious to the city
policymakers,” who are deliberately indifferent when they fail to do so. Id.
The City of Bee Cave acknowledges that “when a failure to train an officer actually
causes an injury, [it may] in certain very limited circumstances, fairly be said to represent
a policy for which a governmental entity may be held responsible.” (Bee Cave Mot. at 5)
(citing City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390). This is precisely what the Complaint alleges.
Koshnick asserts that, in addition to failed policies, the Cities’ inadequate hiring,
training, and supervision of its police officers led officers from two Cities’ police
departments to drag Koshnick down the stairs and subdue him forcibly, when he posed
them no threat. (Complaint at ¶¶ 9, 11, 15, 17–18, 27, 33). Under the circumstances,
Koshnick alleges that the officers had no objective or subjective reason to use excessive
force or escalate the situation “beyond the use of verbal orders or controls.” (Complaint
at ¶ 11). According to Koshnick, this misconduct on the part of both Cities’ officers
demonstrates that the Cities are “guilty of wrongful hiring, training, supervising,
disciplining, and maintaining public servants of quality and character,” a practice he
claims is so common as to be “endemic.” (Complaint at ¶¶ 15–18). It is axiomatic that
responding to domestic disputes, like arresting fleeing felons, is part of police officers’
duties, which the Cities should know “to a moral certainty.” City of Canton, 489 U.S. at
390 n.10. Failing to train them on the constitutional limits of the use of force while
carrying out such duties evidences “deliberate indifference” constituting city policy.

15

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 18 of 23

Furthermore, the City of Lakeway does not specifically dispute Koshnick’s claims
that Lakeway failed to properly train, supervise, or hire its police officers, relying solely
on its mischaracterization of the Complaint as asserting these claims under a vicarious
liability theory.8 However, while the City of Bee Cave does contest Koshnick’s improper
hiring, training, and supervision claim, it makes two fundamental errors.
First, Bee Cave relies on evidence impermissible to consider in the Rule 12(b)(6)
context to argue that the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (“TCOLE”) standards
governing municipalities’ police officer training and supervision demonstrates that Bee
Cave’s officers received proper training. (Bee Cave Mot. at 6–8). Such evidence is not
proper at the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal stage. Villarreal v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 814 F.3d
763, 766 (5th Cir. 2016). Therefore, the Court may not, as Bee Cave urges, “accept as a
matter of judicial notice” any of the TCOLE standards for purposes of the Cities’ motions
to dismiss Koshnick’s claims.
Second, Bee Cave attempts to hold the Complaint to a standard beyond what
applies at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, measuring the allegations against what a plaintiff must
demonstrate “to prevail on a failure to train theory.” (Bee Cave Mot. at 5); Groden v. City
of Dallas, 826 F.3d 280, 284 (5th Cir. 2016). Such evaluation may be proper in a summary
judgment motion—but not in seeking a dismissal for failure to state a plausible claim
under the federal rules. Moreover, specifying precisely which facets of the Cities’ training
program are deficient is not required at the pleading stage, as it is exceedingly rare that

As shown above, none of the allegations in Koshnick’s Complaint asserts or relies on vicarious liability
(respondeat superior) to charge the Cities with Section 1983 liability.
8

16

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 19 of 23

a plaintiff will have access to (or personal knowledge of) such training procedures prior
to discovery. Thomas v. City of Galveston, Tex., 800 F. Supp. 2d 826, 842 (S.D. Tex. 2011).
Ultimately, Koshnick’s Complaint satisfies the pleading standard which this Rule
12(b)(6) motion to dismiss demands, giving the Cities fair notice of the grounds alleged
for a claim against them under Section 1983 for failing to properly hire, train, or supervise
their police officers.
4.

Koshnick’s pleading sufficiently alleges that the Cities ratified the
officers’ conduct.

“[W]hen a subordinate’s decision is subject to review by the municipality’s
authorized policymakers, they have retained the authority to measure the official’s
conduct for conformance with their policies. If the authorized policymakers approve a
subordinate’s decision and the basis for it, their ratification would be chargeable to the
municipality because their decision is final.” City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112,
127 (1988). While a ratification theory is generally recognized in only “the most extreme
factual situations,” that factual situation exists here. See World Wide St. Preachers Fellowship
v. Town of Columbia, 591 F.3d 747, 755 (5th Cir. 2009) (noting that theory applies where
“subordinate's actions are sufficiently extreme—for instance, an obvious violation of
clearly established law”).
In addition to alleging that the police officers acted in accordance with the Cities’
policies and that the Cities’ failure to properly train, supervise, and hire capable police
offers directly led to Koshnick’s injuries, the Complaint takes further exception to the
Cities’ failure to discipline the officers for their conduct. (Complaint at ¶¶ 12, 13).

17

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 20 of 23

Meanwhile, the officers were in a powerful position over Koshnick as they bashed his
front door with a battering ram and broke into his back door, taking Koshnick by surprise
while he was in a vulnerable position, having just finished a shower and being unarmed
without any way to defend himself. (Complaint at ¶¶9, 25–26). By failing to correct this
behavior, Koshnick alleges, the Cities “condoned and ratified” the conduct he alleges
violated his constitutional rights, evidencing a “willful, deliberate, malicious, or []
reckless disregard” for such liberties. (Complaint at ¶¶ 25, 26).
Additionally, although the Cities devote considerable discussion to arguing for
dismissal on the basis that Koshnick insufficiently pleaded a “failure to adopt policy”
(Lakeway Mot. at 7–8; Bee Cave Mot. at 9–10), Koshnick did not assert this as an
independent basis for his 1983 claim. Where the Complaint alleges that the Cities “failed
to enact and enforce” procedures to prevent the police officers’ conduct, it was within the
context of alleging that the Cities effectively condoned this conduct by: enacting policies
that enabled the conduct; failing to enforce policies that would have prevented this
conduct (even if the Cities had such policies in place); or ratifying the conduct by failing
to condemn it. (Complaint at ¶¶ 12–13; 23–36).
E.

Alternatively, Koshnick asks for leave to amend his complaint to address any
defects this Court observes in his pleadings.
As noted in detail above, Koshnick has adequately pleaded claims for municipal

liability against the Cities. However, if this Court perceives some deficiency in Koshnick’s
complaint, he respectfully requests leave to amend his complaint.

18

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 21 of 23

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 15(a) mandates that “’leave to amend shall
be freely given when justice so requires,’ and should be granted absent some justification
for refusal.” U.S. ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Tex. Inc., 336 F.3d 375, 386 (5th
Cir. 2003) (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). “If the underlying facts or
circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be
afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.” Foman, 371 U.S. at 182. Thus,
leave should be given unless some combination of the following factors weighs heavily
against amendment: (1) undue delay; (2) bad faith or dilatory motive; (3) repeated failures
to cure deficiencies by prior amendment; (4) undue prejudice to the opposing party; and
(5) the futility of the amendment. See U.S. ex rel. Hebert v. Dizney, 295 Fed. App’x 717, 724
(5th Cir. 2008). Here, none of these factors are present, particularly given that it is
Koshnick’s original Complaint that the Cities seek to dismiss. Accordingly, if Koshnick’s
allegations are deficient in some respect, he asks the Court for leave to amend his
Complaint.
III.

CONCLUSION

Koshnick’s allegations of the Cities’ police officers’ conduct and the Cities’ conduct
he alleges violates Section 1983—taken together with his elaboration on the events that
led to his constitutional, physical, mental, and emotional injury—satisfy the pleading
standards for a municipal liability claim. These allegations permit the court to infer more
than the mere possibility of misconduct and give the Cities fair notice of the nature of the
claims against them and the grounds on which these claims rest. Accordingly, Koshnick
properly pleaded his Section 1983 claims for injuries resulting from Lakeway and Bee

19

Case 1:17-cv-00852-LY Document 14 Filed 12/12/17 Page 22 of 23

Cave police officers’ excessive use of force based on the Cities’ official policies, customs,
or practices, and the Cities’ failure to hire, train, and supervise its police officers.
Moreover, Koshnick was not required to follow Texas’ procedures for service of
citation, thus, the timely filed Complaint is not subject to a limitations defense. Finally,
Koshnick’s Complaint never asserted punitive damages, so the Cities’ argument that his
claim is barred “to the extent Plaintiff asserts a claim for punitive damages” provides no
additional basis on which to support Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Koshnick’s claims.
IV.

PRAYER

For these reasons, Mark Koshnick respectfully requests that the City of Lakeway
and the City of Bee Caves’ motions to dismiss be denied in their entirely. Alternatively,
to the extent this Court believes that Koshnick’s Complaint is lacking in any regard, he
requests that he be given an opportunity to amend, as appropriate. Koshnick further
requests such other relief to which he may be justly and equitably entitled.
