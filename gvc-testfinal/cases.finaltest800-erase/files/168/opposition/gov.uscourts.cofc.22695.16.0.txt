Defendant, the United States of America, submits the following
response to plaintiff’s motion for a more definite statement and crossmotion for leave to file an amended answer:
I.

INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This is a tax refund case. Plaintiff Gene H. Yamagata seeks a refund

of personal income taxes paid in five tax years (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994,
and 1996). In his complaint, plaintiff states that he previously classified
Forever Living Products Japan (“FLPJ”) – a Japanese entity – as a
corporation under U.S. tax law. (See Complaint ¶¶ 15, 25, 36, 48, 58.)
Plaintiff claims that FLPJ now should be reclassified as a partnership under
U.S. tax law, entitling him to a tax refund. (See Complaint ¶¶ 16, 26, 37,
49, 59.)
Plaintiff asserts that the change in classification of FLPJ from a
corporation to a partnership would reduce his income tax liability by almost
$10 million during the years in suit. (See Complaint, Prayer for Relief.)
According to plaintiff, FLPJ’s reclassification would change the computation
of his tax liability in two material ways:
(1)

It would increase plaintiff’s foreign source income, which would
consequently increase plaintiff’s income tax liability.

(2)

At the same time, plaintiff could claim additional foreign tax
1

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 6 of 17

credits, which would consequently reduce the income taxes
that plaintiff owed.
(See Complaint, ¶¶ 17, 27, 38, 50, 60.) Plaintiff alleges that, because the
additional foreign tax credits would have a greater effect than the increased
foreign source income, on balance his income taxes owed would decline
during the years in suit. (Id.)
Defendant is defending this lawsuit because there is no factual or
legal support for plaintiff’s after-the-fact attempt to reclassify FLPJ as a
partnership. FLPJ should continue to be classified as a corporation during
each of the years in suit, and plaintiff’s tax-refund claims should be rejected
on that basis.
But even if plaintiff were to prevail on the entity-classification issue,
the tax effects of that reclassification are more complex than plaintiff
alleged. Notwithstanding plaintiff’s allegations, reclassification could
increase the taxes plaintiff owes for some of the years in suit.
Reclassification may also cause plaintiff to owe tax in other years as well.
Defendant pled three affirmative defenses based on the additional
taxes that plaintiff might owe as a result of FLPJ’s reclassification as a
partnership. The affirmative defenses allege:

2

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 7 of 17

(1)

Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the duty of consistency, because
plaintiff previously classified FLPJ as a corporation and FLPJ
cannot be effectively reclassified as a partnership, due to
statutes of limitation that preclude the assessment of tax that
plaintiff would owe in closed periods.

(2)

Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the doctrine of equitable
estoppel for the same reason.

(3)

To the extent that reclassification of FLPJ would increase the
tax owed by plaintiff to the United States, any tax refund
otherwise due to plaintiff should be reduced by the amount of
additional tax owed, under the doctrines of equitable
recoupment and/or set-off.

Plaintiff moved for a more definite statement of the affirmative
defense for equitable recoupment and/or set-off. In his motion, plaintiff
complains that defendant’s answer “omits any explanation of the defense,
such as the specific years affected, the type or amount of any income or
excise tax or other fundamental elements of the set-off claim.” (Motion at
2.)
If FLPJ were reclassified as a partnership, the ensuing tax
consequences would depend on the grounds that the Court might express
for changing FLPJ’s classification. The precise consequences would
further depend on facts that are known to plaintiff but not to defendant.
Thus, at this stage of the proceedings, it is not possible to allege and
quantify all of the tax consequences that may result. An answer, like a
3

complaint, need not, should not, and in this case cannot set out in full detail
all of the evidence on which it is based. RCFC 8(a) instead directs parties
to submit a “short and plain” statement of their claims and defenses.
Defendant believes that its original answer satisfies that directive.
Nonetheless, in an effort to address plaintiff’s concern, defendant
prepared an amended answer that further outlines the general tax
consequences that could affect plaintiff if FLPJ were reclassified as a
partnership. Defendant is moving for leave of Court to file this amended
answer. (Defendants’ Proposed “Amended Answer and Counterclaim” is
attached as Exhibit A hereto.)
II.

RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR MORE DEFINITE
STATEMENT
A.

Reclassification of FLPJ from a corporation to a
partnership could affect plaintiff’s tax situation in various
ways; the precise effects cannot be settled at this stage of
the case.

FLPJ’s reclassification as a partnership would have many tax
consequences, which fall into three broad categories: (1) those that occur
at the time of FLPJ’s reclassification from a corporation to a partnership; (2)
those that affect each of the tax years during which FLPJ would be
classified as a partnership; and (3) those that occur when FLPJ’s
4

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 9 of 17

classification reverts (as it must under subsequent rules) from a partnership
back to a corporation. Each could cause plaintiff to owe additional tax that
may offset any refund due to plaintiff.
First, FLPJ’s claimed reclassification would have tax consequences
at the time it would occur, when there would be a deemed liquidation of the
corporation, followed by a contribution of the distributed assets to the
partnership:
“Like most powerful tools, the ability to affect the classification
of the venture can result in unforeseen negative tax
consequences if used without an understanding of the
implications. For example, a foreign partnership or corporate
joint venture may amend its charter or other governing
instruments in a manner that changes its classification for U.S.
tax purposes. This change is considered to result in a deemed
liquidation of the former venture, followed by a deemed
recontribution of assets to the new venture. The deemed
liquidation and recontribution may trigger gain recognition or
other tax consequences under both domestic and international
tax provisions.”
Bruce N. Davis and Steven R. Lainoff, U.S. Taxation of Foreign Joint
Ventures, 46 Tax. L. Rev. 165, 170 n.15 (1991); see also Rev. Rul. 63-107,
1963-1 C.B. 71, 72. The deemed liquidation of corporate FLPJ could
cause plaintiff to realize either a gain or loss in his interest in the entity at
the time of the reclassification. The deemed recontribution of assets to

5

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 10 of 17

partnership FLPJ could cause plaintiff to owe an excise tax on the transfer
of those assets.
Second, during each year of FLPJ’s reclassification as a partnership,
the computation of the income taxes owed by plaintiff could be affected in
various ways. Plaintiff’s foreign source income could increase. Plaintiff’s
dividend income could decline. Plaintiff’s deductions could be affected.
Plaintiff could potentially claim additional foreign tax credits. Additional
adjustments to the computation of plaintiff’s tax liability may also be
necessary.1
Third, FLPJ would experience a second status change when FLPJ
would revert from a partnership back to a corporation at the end of the
years in suit. At that time, the applicable Kintner regulations were
superseded by new “check the box” regulations. See 26 CFR § 301.77011, et seq. The new regulations classified FLPJ as a corporation in 1997. If
FLPJ were classified as a partnership in 1996, it would revert from a
partnership to a corporation when the new regulations took effect.

1

In addition, during each year of FLPJ’s reclassification as a
partnership, plaintiff could owe excise taxes on the transfer of any property
to FLPJ.
6

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Page 11 of 17

As with the earlier change of classification, the reversion of FLPJ
from a partnership to a corporation would have its own tax consequences.
Reclassification of FLPJ from a partnership to a corporation would result in
the deemed liquidation of the partnership and deemed contribution of
assets to a new corporation. Davis and Lainoff, supra, at 170 n.15.
The deemed contribution of assets to the foreign corporation may result in
recognition of gain to plaintiff. In addition, depending on the facts, it is
possible that the deemed liquidation of the partnership would cause plaintiff
to realize gain in his partnership interest.
For each of these three broad effects, the “specific years affected”
and “the type or amount of any income or excise tax” cannot be determined
at this stage of the case. (See Motion at 2). The “specific years affected”
will depend on the years for which the Court might reclassify FLPJ as a
partnership and the grounds of any such reclassification. The “type or
amount” of taxes affected will depend on facts known to plaintiff but not
defendant. Such facts include, among other things, the basis of plaintiff’s
interest in FLPJ, the value of plaintiff’s interest in FLPJ at the time of any
reclassification, the nature and value of FLPJ’s assets at the time of any
reclassification, FLPJ’s earnings and profits during pertinent periods of

7

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

time, FLPJ’s income and deductions that may flow through to plaintiff’s tax
returns, the taxes paid by FLPJ for which plaintiff may claim a foreign tax
credit, and the financial records of the S-corporation through which plaintiff
owned shares in FLPJ.
At this stage of the proceedings, it is not possible for the affirmative
defenses to say more than defendant expressed in its Answer and
proposed amended answer. It would first be necessary for the Court to
determine whether FPLJ should be reclassified and, if so, when.
Defendant would then need to obtain discovery of the pertinent facts that
are known to plaintiff but not to defendant.
B.

Defendant’s answer is sufficiently specific.

Under the notice pleading requirements of the Rules of the Court of
Federal Claims, defendants’ answer is sufficiently specific. Rule 8(e)
states that “[e]ach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and
direct.” Rule 8(b) requires the Government’s affirmative defenses to be
pled “in short and plain terms.” And Rule 8(a) provides that claims for relief
must include “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleader is entitled to relief.”

8

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Page 13 of 17

Rule 12(e) permits a party to move for a more definite statement
where a pleading is “so vague and ambiguous” that a party cannot
reasonably be required to frame a response. However, “[t]he law disfavors
Rule 12(e) motions. Rule 12(e) provides a remedy for unintelligible
pleadings; it is not intended to correct a claimed lack of detail.” Resolution
Trust Corp. v. Gershman, 829 F. Supp. 1095, 1103 (E.D. Mo. 1993)
(citations omitted). “If the moving party could obtain the missing detail
through discovery, the motion should be denied.” Davison v. Santa
Barbara High Sch. Dist., 48 F. Supp 2d 1225, 1228 (1998); see also Fed.
Air Marshals v. United States, 74 Fed Cl. 484, 488 (2006) (denying motion
for more definite statement where party could obtain further specificity
during discovery).
Here, defendant’s affirmative defenses are short, plain, simple,
concise, and direct, just as the rules require. Plaintiff’s request for further
specificity – and particularly for the “specific years affected” and “the type
or amount of any income or excise tax” – puts the cart before the horse.
(See Motion at 2.) Plaintiff is asking the Court, at the outset of the case, to
require defendant to plead factual details that are contingent on questions
that the Court has not yet decided and that will depend on information in

9

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 14 of 17

plaintiff’s possession that is presently unknown to defendant. Plaintiff’s
motion asks that defendant do more than just plead its defense; he asks for
specific evidence and analysis that are properly the subject of the
proceedings that follow after an answer is filed.
C.

The equitable-recoupment defense in defendant’s answer
is not a counterclaim.
Plaintiff also asks the Court to order defendant to plead its defense

for equitable recoupment/set-off as a compulsory counterclaim. (See
Motion at 2-3.) However, as pled in defendant’s answer, the equitablerecoupment defense seeks merely to reduce “any tax refund due to
plaintiffs” by “the amount of [plaintiff’s] increased [tax] liabilities . . . .”
(Answer, ¶ 69.) It seeks only to abate the relief plaintiff seeks, rather than
assert an affirmative claim on behalf of the Government.
“The purpose of the doctrine of equitable recoupment is to prevent
unjust enrichment by either the taxpayer or government, and it . . . may be
invoked by the government to prohibit tax avoidance.” Last v. United
States, 37 Fed. Cl. 1, 8 (1996). Equitable recoupment permits “a party
litigating a tax claim in a timely proceeding” to “seek recoupment of a
related, and inconsistent, but now time-barred tax claim relating to the
same transaction.” United States v. Dalm, 494 U.S. 596, 608 (1990).

10

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 15 of 17

Recoupment is “a defense to another party’s tax related claim where the
two claims arise out of the same transaction or taxable event.” Last, 37
Fed. Cl. at 9 (quoting Harrah v. United States, 69 F.3d 1448, 1451 (9th Cir.
1995)). It “does not rise to an independent cause of action.” Id. at 9.
As pled in defendant’s answer, the equitable recoupment/set-off
issue is an affirmative defense, rather than a counterclaim, because (1) it
concerns potential assessments that are barred by applicable statutes of
limitation, and (2) it seeks to reduce the amount that plaintiff may recover
rather than obtain affirmative relief. Nonetheless, the Court is not bound by
the labels that are used if “a party has mistakenly designated a defense as
a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense,” and it may “treat the
pleading as if there had been a proper designation.” RCFC 8(c).
III.

DEFENDANT’S CROSS-MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN
AMENDED ANSWER
Rule 15(a) provides that a party “may amend the party’s pleading”

with leave of the Court, and “leave shall be freely given when justice so
requires.” Defendant respectfully requests the Court’s leave to file the
proposed “Amended Answer and Counterclaim” that is attached hereto.
The attached proposed “Amended Answer and Counterclaim”
includes further specificity regarding the tax consequences that could occur
11

Case 1:07-cv-00698-LMB

Document 16

Filed 02/27/2008

Page 16 of 17

if FLPJ were reclassified from a corporation to a partnership. (E.g.,
Proposed Amended Answer, ¶¶ 67-79.) Although the rules do not appear
to require this additional level of detail, defendant nonetheless proposes to
file an amended answer further to enable plaintiff to frame a responsive
pleading.
The attached proposed “Amended Answer and Counterclaim” also
clarifies that plaintiff’s equitable-recoupment defense applies only “to the
extent that the United States is foreclosed by statutes of limitation from
assessing plaintiff with the additional taxes owed.” (See Proposed
Amended Answer, ¶ 82.) However, it also adds an affirmative counterclaim
concerning taxes that plaintiff may owe where “the United States is not
foreclosed by statutes of limitation from assessing plaintiff.” (See Proposed
Amended Answer, ¶ 83.) Defendant believes that most of the additional
taxes that plaintiff may owe as a result of the reclassification of FLPJ would
likely affect closed years. However, because the statute of limitations may
not bar the assessment of all additional taxes that may result if FLPJ is
reclassified, out of an abundance of caution, defendant proposes to plead a
counterclaim to address that circumstance.
