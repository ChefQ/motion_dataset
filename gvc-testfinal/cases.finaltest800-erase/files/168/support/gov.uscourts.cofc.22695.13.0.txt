v.
* MOTION FOR MORE
* DEFINITE STATEMENT
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Defendant.
*
*
******************************************
Plaintiff, under Rule 12(e), Rules of the United States Federal Court of
Claims (“RCFC”), moves this Court to enter an order requiring Defendant to file a
more definite statement of its asserted “affirmative defense” of recoupment and/or
set-off. This Motion is supported by the following Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, which is incorporated by reference.
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
Defendant has raised the affirmative defenses of “set-off” and
“recoupment.” (Answer ¶69.) Plaintiff moves for a more definite statement.
Defendant’s basis for the set-off is that “the resulting reclassification of
Forever Living Products Japan would have various affects that would increase

plaintiff’s income tax and/or excise tax liability to the United States. Plaintiff’s tax
liability would increase both for some of the years in suit and for other years.” (Id.
¶69.) Defendant employs the same language in the other affirmative defenses
asserted in the Answer. (Id. ¶ ¶ 67-68.)
Defendant’s Answer, however, omits any explanation of the defense, such as
the specific years affected, the type or amount of any income or excise tax or other
fundamental elements of the set-off claim. Consequently, Plaintiff is unable to
frame a responsive pleading because of the vague and ambiguous language in the
Answer.
Plaintiff believes that any set-off is a compulsory counterclaim in this case.
See, e.g., Boers v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 725, 732-33 (1999) (stating that if
United State’s asserted set-off sought to “reduce the amount of what would
otherwise be the judgment in this case to zero to reflect the offset decision, that
offset would clearly be a compulsory counterclaim”); RFCF 13(a) (defining
compulsory counterclaim as one that “arises out of the transaction or occurrence
that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim”). Under the Rules,
Defendant is required to plead the compulsory counterclaim with specificity at the
time of and in its answer. See RCFC 13(a). Defendant failed to do so. The Court

should order Defendant to plead the factual basis of the set-off in sufficient detail
to permit Plaintiff to frame a meaningful reply to the set-off.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to enter an
order requiring Defendant to file a more definite statement with specificity and/or
as a compulsory counterclaim.
RESPECTFULLY submitted this ___ day of February, 2008.
