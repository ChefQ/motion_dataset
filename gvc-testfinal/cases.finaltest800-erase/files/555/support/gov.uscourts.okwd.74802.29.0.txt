NOTICE OF MOTION TO DISMISS
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that defendants Chesapeake Energy Corporation,
Aubrey K. McClendon, Marcus C. Rowland, Michael A. Johnson, Richard K.
Davidson, Frank A. Keating, Breen M. Kerr, Charles T. Maxwell, Merrill A.
Miller, Jr., Donald L. Nickles, and Frederick B. Whittemore (collectively,
“Company defendants”) hereby move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for
Violation of the Federal Securities laws (“Complaint”).
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Company defendants
seek an order dismissing the Amended Complaint in its entirety and with
prejudice.
The Motion to Dismiss is based on the Complaint’s failure to state a claim
under Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. As set forth by the
Supreme Court in Twombly and Iqbal, the Complaint lacks the requisite factual
allegations to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Further, the
Complaint’s allegations of loss causation are refuted by the face of the Complaint
and by publicly available facts.
The Motion to Dismiss is further based on the Notice of Motion and
Motion, the supporting memorandum of points and authorities, the Request for
Judicial Notice in Support of the Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint and
all exhibits attached thereto, all pleading and papers on file in this action, oral
argument counsel, if allowed, and any other matters that may be submitted to or
considered by the Court.
STATEMENT OF ISSUES:
1. Whether the Court should dismiss the Complaint for failing to state a
claim under Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933.
