limited liability company,

DEFENDANT GHOSTBED, INC.’S
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY
DEFENDANTS SHOULD NOT BE HELD
IN CONTEMPT

Plaintiff,
vs.
HONEST REVIEWS, LLC, a Florida
corporation, RYAN MONAHAN, an
individual, and GHOSTBED, INC., a
Delaware corporation,
Defendants.

Civil No. 2:17-cv-00138
District Judge Dee Benson

Case 2:17-cv-00138-DB Document 42 Filed 03/13/17 Page 2 of 5

Pursuant to the Court’s Order dated March 9, 2017 (Dkt. 35), Defendant GhostBed, Inc.
(“GhostBed”) respectfully submits this opposition to Plaintiff Purple Innovations, LLC’s
(“Purple’s”) Motion for Order to Show Cause Why Defendants Should Not Be Held in Contempt
(Dkt. 17.)
In its motion, Purple speculates that GhostBed is “working together” with Honest
Reviews, LLC and Mr. Monahan to post new articles on the honestmattressreviews.com website
in violation of the Court’s Temporary Restraining Order. (Dkt. 17 at 1-2, n.4.) But for all the
reasons detailed in GhostBed’s Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 36), and the sworn declarations of
GhostBed’s CEO, Mr. Werner, and Mr. Monahan himself, GhostBed did not violate the Court’s
Order because it does not own, operate, or contribute to the website in any way. (See Dkt. 31,
Declaration of M. Werner, dated March 8, 2017 (“Werner Decl.”) at ¶¶ 3-6; Dkt. 30, Declaration
of R. Monahan, dated March 7, 2017 (“Monahan Decl.”) at ¶ 12.)
GhostBed had no involvement with, let alone any control over, what Mr. Monahan and
Honest Reviews, LLC chose to say when conveying information about Purple on the
honestmattressreviews.com website. (Werner Decl. at ¶¶ 3-7.) Purple alleges—in a footnote—
that GhostBed should nevertheless be held accountable because Mr. Monahan is currently an
employee of GhostBed’s marketing department, has an office at GhostBed’s headquarters in
Florida and a telephone extension at that office, and can be reached using the email address
marketing@ghostbed.com. (Dkt. 17 at n. 4.) But none of those things are true. Mr. Monahan is
not, and has never been, an employee of GhostBed. (Werner Decl. at ¶ 11.) Mr. Monahan does
not have an office at GhostBed, or a phone extension, or an email address. (Id. at ¶¶ 15-19.) And
Mr. Monahan cannot be reached by calling the number on GhostBed’s website. (Id. at ¶ 18.)

Purple relies on a declaration from its own paid private investigator that called
GhostBed’s customer service number and spoke to a staffing agency contractor about Mr.
Monahan. (Dkt. 17 at n. 4.) Far from confirming Purple’s conspiracy theory, though, the actual
transcript of that phone call shows that it was the investigator who informed GhostBed’s
customer representative that there was an employee named Monahan, and the customer
representative responded that he was possibly in the northeast. (Dkt. 31, Exhibit 3, Transcript of
Telephone Call (“Transcript”) at 2; Werner Decl. at ¶¶ 22-34.) The rest of the transcript makes
plain, though, that the customer service representative did not know who Purple’s private
investigator was calling about. (Transcript at 2-3.) Purple’s so-called evidence of “collusion”
simply does not pass muster.
The only credible evidence in the record—sworn affidavits based on first-hand
knowledge—show that GhostBed: (i) does not own or control the honestmattressreviews.com
website; (ii) did not publish, direct, or otherwise suggest to anyone to publish any content on the
honestmattressreviews.com website; (iii) does not currently employ (and has never employed)
Mr. Monahan; and (iv) is not compensating Mr. Monahan or Honest Reviews, LLC in any way,
directly or indirectly, in connection with the honestmattressreviews.com website. (Werner Decl.
at ¶¶ 9-11, 15-20; Monahan Decl. at ¶ 12.) GhostBed, therefore, was not in a position to delete or
modify any of the website posts identified in the Court’s Order. Nor could it contribute to the
new posts complained about in Purple’s motion. For all of these reasons, and those set forth in
GhostBed’s Motion to Dismiss, GhostBed cannot be held in contempt and Purple’s motion
should be denied.
