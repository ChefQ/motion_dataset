BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.’S MOTION TO STAY EXECUTION OF FINAL DEFAULT

AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendant, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (“BANA”), pursuant to section 91 of Title 12 of
the United States Code and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b)(4), files its motion to Stay
Execution of the Default Final Judgment [Doc. 18] Pending Disposition of Rule 60 Motion to

STATEMENT OF FACTS
1.

On July 2, 2014, Plaintiffs NELSON CONIGLIO and JOYCE CONIGLIO

(“Plaintiffs”) sued BANA, alleging that BANA violated: (1) the Telephone Consumer Protection
Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. §§ 227, et seq., (“TCPA”); (2) the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15
U.S.C. §§ 1692, et seq., (“FDCPA”); and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, §§
559.55, Fla. Stat. et seq., (“FCCPA”). [Doc. 1].

2.

The Plaintiffs sought and obtained a clerk’s default after serving a bank employee

at a banking center in Charlotte, North Carolina. 1 [Doc. 6, 7].
3.

On August 15, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed, but did not serve on BANA, a Motion for

Default Judgment. [Doc. 8] (amended on August 18, 2014 [Doc. 13]). BANA was not served
with the Amended Motion for Default Judgment, or any post-complaint filings (and the
undersigned firm was not notified of this lawsuit).
4.

On October 21, 2014, this Court entered an order granting the Plaintiffs’

Amended Motion for Default Judgment. [Doc. 16]. This Court then entered a Final Judgment in
favor of the Plaintiffs for $1,051,000.00. [Doc. 18] (the “Final Judgment”).
5.

BANA just learned of entry of the Final Judgment on October 27, 2014. BANA

is finalizing its Motion for Relief from Judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b),
and anticipates filing the Motion on Wednesday, November 5, 2014.
6.

For the following reasons, BANA requests that this Court enter an order staying

the Final Judgment until it rules upon BANA’s Motion for Relief from Judgment, and if an
appeal is filed, it is resolved.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
BANA seeks an order staying execution of the Final Judgment and any proceedings to
enforce the Final Judgment. BANA is automatically entitled to a stay as the National Bank Act
prohibits a judgment creditor from executing a judgment against a national banking association
until the judgment has become final. A judgment is not final until all appeals have been

The Motion for Relief from Judgment, anticipated to be filed on November 5, 2014, will further
elaborate upon the undersigned firm’s service as counsel for BANA in two (2) other lawsuits
involving the identical borrowers and account holders. The undersigned firm has also
represented the bank in multiple other lawsuits where the Morgan & Morgan, P.A. law firm has
sued BANA. Despite this representation, no notice of this lawsuit was ever furnished to this law
firm or Reed Smith, P.A. (counsel for BANA in the pending TCPA class action, where the
Plaintiffs affirmatively tendered notice to opt out of the class).

concluded. A stay of execution is also appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b)
until this Court resolves BANA’s Motion for Relief from Judgment. Authority interpreting Rule
62(b) entitles BANA to a stay of execution without having to post a supersedeas bond.
However, if this Court disagrees, BANA respectfully requests that this Court set a bond amount,
give BANA adequate time to obtain a bond, and keep a temporary stay in place.
A. BANA is entitled to a stay of execution under the National Bank Act.
The National Bank Act dictates that “no attachment, injunction, or execution shall be
issued against such [national banking association] or its property before final judgment in any
suit, action, or proceeding, in any State, county, or municipal court.” 12 U.S.C. § 91 (emphasis
added). The term “final judgment” within section 91 means a “judgment on the merits which is
no longer subject to examination on appeal, either because of disposition on appeal and
conclusion of the appellate process, or because of the passage, without action, of the time for
seeking appellate review.” United States v. Lemaire, 826 F. 2d 387, 389 (5th Cir. 1987) (holding
that under the National Bank Act, judgment against the bank could not be executed during
pendency of the state court appeal); accord In re Richmond Produce Co., Inc., 195 B.R. 455,
465–66 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (affirming the bankruptcy court’s holding that “12 U.S.C. § 91 should
be construed to preclude any pre- or post-judgment remedies directing to securing or satisfying a
judgment against a national banking association until all appeals of the judgment have been
concluded”).
While section 91 only expressly refers to suits brought in state or municipal courts, it has
been recognized that section 91 also applies to judgments of federal district courts. Id. at 465
(“[T]he trustee’s argument that section 91 does not apply to remedies in suits or proceedings in
federal court is meritless. As the bankruptcy court recognized, the Supreme Court has explicitly

held that the predecessor to section 91 was intended to apply to actions in federal as well as state
courts.” (citing Pac. Nat’l Bank v. Mixter, 124 U.S. 721 (1888))).
Here, BANA is a national banking association. As such, it is entitled to all of the
protections afforded under section 91. Glad v. Thomas Cnty. Nat’l Bank, No. 87-1299-C, 1991
WL 261712, *2 (D. Kan. Nov. 14, 1991). Those protections include a stay of execution of any
judgment without the burden of having to post a bond. Id.; accord State Bank & Trust Co. of
Golden Meadow v. D.J. Griffin Boat, 926 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that section 91
permits a bank “to seek a stay of the lower court’s judgment without having to post a
supersedeas bond”). Therefore, under section 91 of the National Bank Act, BANA is entitled to
an order staying execution of the Final Judgment until any appeal becomes final, without posting
a supersedeas bond.
B. BANA is entitled to a stay of execution pursuant to Rule 62(b).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b) permits a district court to stay execution of a
judgment pending the disposition of certain post-trial motions, including a motion under Rule 60,
for relief from a judgment or order. Id.; see also Slip n’ Slide Records, Inc. v. TVT Records, LLC,
No. 05-21113, 2007 WL 1098751, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 8, 2007).
Further, “[w]hile a party may obtain a stay as a matter of right by posting a supersedeas
bond, the Court may waive the bond requirement in its discretion.” United States v. Fleming,
114 A.F.T.R.2d 2014-6120, at *2 (M.D. Fla. 2014) (citing United States v. Dornbrock, 101
A.F.T.R.2d 2008-2677, at *1 (S.D. Fla. 2008)). A court may consider the following factors in
determining whether to waive the bond requirement:
(1) the complexity of the collection process; (2) the amount of time
required to obtain a judgment after it is affirmed on appeal; (3) the degree
of confidence that the district court has in the availability of funds to pay
the judgment; (4) whether the defendant’s ability to pay the judgment is so
plain that the cost of a bond would be a waste of money; and (5) whether

the defendant is in such a precarious financial situation that the
requirement to post a bond would place other creditors of the defendant in
an insecure position.
Fleming, 114 A.F.T.R.2d 2014-6120, at *3 (quotations omitted); cf. Slip n’ Slide Records, Inc.,
2007 WL 1098751, at *2 (“[I]f a court finds that the defendant’s ability to satisfy its obligations,
now or in the future, is uncertain then it is not appropriate to stay execution of a judgment under
Rule 62(b).”).
Here, this Court should stay execution of the judgment pending resolution of the Motion
for Relief from Judgment and any appeal without requiring BANA to post a supersedeas bond.
Granting the motion for stay without the requirement for posting any bond will not jeopardize
the ability to collect on the judgment. See, e.g., Fleming, 114 A.F.T.R.2d 2014-6120; Slip n’
Slide Records, Inc., 2007 WL 1098751, at *2. BANA respectfully requests that this Court enter
a stay order without the requirement of a bond, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b),
until the disposition of the Motion for Relief from Final Judgment.
If this Court disagrees and is inclined to order a bond as a condition for stay, BANA
respectfully requests that this Court enter an order setting the amount of the bond, granting
BANA adequate time to obtain and file the bond with the Court, and causing a temporary stay to
remain in place until the bond is filed with the Court.
Certification as to Conferral under Local Rule 3.01(g): The undersigned counsel has
spoken with William P. Howard, Esq. of Morgan & Morgan, P.A. (Counsel for Plaintiffs) on
November 4, 2014 as to this Motion. Plaintiff’s counsel does not agree to the relief sought
