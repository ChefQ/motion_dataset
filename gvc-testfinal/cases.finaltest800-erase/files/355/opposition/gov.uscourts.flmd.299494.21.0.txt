LP,
Defendant.
_______________________________________/
PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
STAY OF EXECUTION MOTION AND RELATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62, and other applicable law, Nelson Coniglio
and Joyce Coniglio (together, the “Plaintiffs”), respond as follows to “Bank of America’s Motion to
Stay Execution of Final Default Judgment Pending Disposition of Motion to Vacate and Set Aside
Default and Default Judgment, and Incorporated Memorandum of Law,” (the “Stay of Execution
Motion”) (Dkt. 19) filed by Bank of America, N.A., a foreign corporation, f/k/a BAC Home Loans
Servicing (the “Defendant”) on or about November 4, 2014, in this action (this “Action”):
A. Background Allegations

1.

On July 2, 2014, the Plaintiffs initiated this Action by filing a “Complaint and

Demand for Jury Trial” (the “Complaint”) (Dkt. 1) seeking relief as against the Defendant for
violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq., among other
things.

2.

On July 2, 2014, the Clerk of this Court (the “Clerk”) issued a summons for the

Defendant (Dkt. 2), and initial process was served upon the Defendant on or as of July 10, 2014, as
evidenced by the return of service filed in this Action on or as of July 14, 2014 and again on August
18, 2014 (Dkt. 5 and 15).

Case 8:14-cv-01628-EAK-MAP Document 21 Filed 11/05/14 Page 2 of 6 PageID 172
3.

On August 1, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed their motion for entry of clerk’s default against

the Defendant (the “Default Motion”) (Dkt. 6), and the Clerk entered a default against the Defendant
(the “Clerk’s Default”) (Dkt.. 7) in response to the same on August 4, 2014.

4.

On August 15, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed their motion for default judgment against the

Defendant (Dkt. 8), that included a series of affidavits that together support all the relief requested
therein under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b). On August 18, 2014, the Default Judgment
Motion was amended (Dkt. 13), and supplemented by the affidavits of Nelson Coniglio, Joyce
Coniglio, and Jason Anthony Coniglio (Dkt. 10, 11, and 12). All of the foregoing are referred to
herein as the “Default Judgment Materials.”

5.

On October 21, 2014, this Court considered the Default Judgment Materials and

entered its “Order” (the “Default Judgment Order”) (Dkt. 16), granting the Plaintiffs’ relief under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b).

6.

Also on October 21, 2014, and in a manner consistent with the Default Judgment

Order, the Clerk entered a “Judgment in a Civil Case” (the “Judgment”) (Dkt. 18), in the amount of
$1,051,000, in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant, together with court costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees.
B. Allegations Relating to Relief Requested

7.

On November 5, 2014, the Defendant filed the Stay of Execution Motion that seeks

an order staying execution and enforcement of the Judgment pending disposition of a motion from
relief from judgment, which has yet to be filed, and any appeal.

8.

In the Stay of Execution Motion, the Defendant first argues that the National Bank

Act precludes the Plaintiffs from executing on the Judgment until the conclusion of the appellate
process, notwithstanding that no motion has been filed. Next, the Defendant asserts that pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b), this Court should use its discretion to stay any execution
pending a motion to set aside the Judgment and any appeal therefrom, and to not require the

2

Case 8:14-cv-01628-EAK-MAP Document 21 Filed 11/05/14 Page 3 of 6 PageID 173
Defendant to post a bond. Both of these requests are premature, as the Defendant has not even filed a
motion to set aside the Judgment.
C. Memorandum of Law
i.

The National Bank Act

The National Bank Act states that “no attachment, injunction, or execution, shall be issued
against such association or its property before final judgment in any suit, action, or proceeding in any
State, county, or municipal court.”

12 U.S.C. § 91 (emphasis added). Although the Stay of

Execution Motion cites to two cases for the proposition that a “final judgment” means a judgment on
the merits that is no longer subject to an appeal, those cases do not bind this Court to such a
construction. See U.S. v. Lemaire, 826 F.2d 387, 389 (5th Cir. 1987); In re Richmond Produce Co.,
Inc., 195 B.R. 455, 465–66 (N.D. Cal. 1996). Indeed, no such binding cases exist, and if any case
should be persuasive, it should be the Supreme Court case of Third Nat’l Bank in Nashville v. Impac
Ltd., 432 U.S. 312, 324 (1977), which firmly states, “Fairly read, the statute merely prevents
prejudgment seizure of bank property by creditors of the bank.” (emphasis added). Furthermore, the
Supreme Court has held that “final judgment” refers to a judgment that is final and appealable, not a
judgment that has already been appealed or in which time for an appeal has run. Melkonyan v.
Sullivan, 501 U.S. 89, 95; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(a). Therefore, to add to this definition of “final
judgment” in the National Bank Act is to construe the statute in a way not intended by Congress.
There is further persuasive authority that the National Bank Act refers to a final judgment
that has been rendered, instead of one that has gone through the appeals process.

Gutierrez v. Wells

Fargo Bank, N.A., No. C 07-05923 WHA, 2010 WL 4688989 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2010) and
Quinones v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., No. 09cv2748-AJB, 2012 WL 1473351 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 27,
2012) are both analogous to the issues at hand here. In Gutierrez, a plaintiff obtained a judgment
against Wells Fargo, who then moved to stay the judgment pending appeal without posting a bond.
Id. at *1. The Gutierrez court cited to the Supreme Court’s decision in Impac for its conclusion that
the term “before final judgment” is not equivalent to “after judgment and appeal,” and held that
3

Case 8:14-cv-01628-EAK-MAP Document 21 Filed 11/05/14 Page 4 of 6 PageID 174
Wells Fargo was not entitled to a stay pending appeal. Id. at *1; see also Quinones (citing Gutierrez
for the same holding).
Gutierrez and Quinones point out that the Lemaire case and other cases within the Fifth
Circuit are flawed in their reasoning that “final judgment” means after any appeals process because it
is inconsistent with previous Supreme Court rulings. Therefore, in reading the statute plainly, this
Court should determine that “before final judgment,” simply means before a final judgment is
rendered. Here, there is no question that a final judgment has been rendered, therefore, this Court
should deny the De
ii.

A Bond is Required Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62

Since the National Bank Act does not protect the Defendant from execution on a final
judgment after it is rendered, the Defendant is not automatically entitled to a stay of execution of the
Judgment or a waiver of the bond requirement. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b), a court
may stay the execution or enforcement of a judgment pending disposition of certain motions,
including a motion for relief from judgment, if there are appropriate terms for the opposing party's
security. See Hiscox Dedicated Corporate Member, Ltd. v. Matrix Group Ltd., Inc., No. 8:09–cv–
2465–T–33AEP, 2012 WL 333806 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 1, 2012). The Defendant argues that this Court
should use its discretion to stay execution of the Judgment pending a motion to vacate it and waive
the bond requirement. There are several flaws to this argument.
First, there is no pending motion to vacate the Judgment, which renders the Stay of Execution
Motion moot in this sense. See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Beemer & Associates XLVII, LLC, Nos.
3:10–cv–576–J–32JBT, 3:10–cv–577–J–32JBT, 2014 WL 5038333, *2 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 25, 2014)
(holding that since no motions under Rule 62(b) were pending, the motion for stay relief should be
denied as moot). Next, the Defendant gives no reason whatsoever in the Stay of Execution Motion
that the Court should use its discretion to stay execution of the Judgment pending a motion that has
not even been filed.
Finally, in the Stay of Execution Motion, the Defendant’s only argument that it should not
4

Case 8:14-cv-01628-EAK-MAP Document 21 Filed 11/05/14 Page 5 of 6 PageID 175
have to post a bond is that it “will not jeopardize the ability to collect on the judgment.” (Dkt. 19, p.
5). The Defendant provides no objective information regarding actual ability to pay. See Hiscox,
2012 WL 333806 at *1 (finding that since the plaintiff did not provide sufficient objective evidence
of ability to pay, a bond would be required and that a general statement of the plaintiff’s financial
position was a “mere platitude”). Further, the Defendant would not be prejudiced in any way by
providing a certified check for the full amount of the Judgment as security for obtaining a stay
because such funds would not be drawn upon until any motion or appeals have been resolved. Thus,
the Defendant should be required to post a bond as required under Rule 62(b).
D. Conclusion
Although there is no binding case law on the definition of “before final judgment” in the
National Bank Act, there is persuasive authority that the term means after a final judgment has been
rendered and not after any appeals process is complete. Since the Judgment is a final judgment, the
Plaintiffs should be permitted to execute thereon as any other final judgment, notwithstanding that is
still appealable. Additionally, this Court should not use its discretion to stay execution or to waive
the bond requirement because the Defendant has provided no reasonable justification therefor.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny the Stay of Execution
Motion, and grant such other relief as is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
