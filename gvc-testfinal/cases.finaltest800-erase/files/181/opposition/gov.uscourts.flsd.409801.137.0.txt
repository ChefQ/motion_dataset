__________________________________________/
PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
OF COURT’S DECEMBER 13, 2013 DISCOVERY ORDER AND MOTION FOR
ORDER STAYING DEFENDANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL DISCOVERY
AND REQUEST TO ADMIT
Defendant argues that the Court should reconsider its order of December 13, 2013 (Doc.
No. 132) because of newly discovered evidence. The disputed issue is Plaintiffs’ request for
production of documents relating to a C15 engine manufactured by Defendant. The context
involves Plaintiffs’ suit for breach of warranties regarding the Caterpillar Regeneration System
(CRS) which CAT put in all its heavy duty diesel engines (“HDDE”) to meet the 2007 EPA
emission standards. CAT manufactures a number of different sized (and horsepower) HDDE for
on-highway (as opposed to off-highway) use. The engines are put into vehicles manufactured
and sold by other vehicle manufacturers, such as Peterbuilt, Kenworth, and Van Hool. These onhighway vehicles include trucks and buses.

CAT designed and manufactured an exhaust

emissions control system referred to by CAT as its proprietary 2007 ACERT Technology
necessary for the engine exhaust to meet the 2007 EPA Standard 1 for all heavy duty diesel onhighway engines. The exhaust emission control systems lower the pollutant content of the diesel
engine identically in all CAT C13 and C15 diesel engines for which the 2007 EPA standard is
applicable (Model Year, MY2007 and later C13 and C15 on-highway diesel engines) regardless
of the size and horsepower of the heavy duty diesel engine used in the vehicle. The terms C13
and C15 designate the size, i.e., 13 liter and 15 liter, of the diesel engine itself, not the size of the
exhaust emissions control systems that reduce pollutants from the exhausts of those engines.
CAT designed, patented, and manufactured the exhaust emissions controls irrespective of the
engine to which they are attached. In addition, the Clean Air Act and the attendant EPA
regulations require that the emissions controls employed in all heavy duty, on-highway diesel
engines have an express Federal Emissions Warranty covering the various components that
comprise the entire exhaust emissions control system. The Federal Emissions Control Warranty
provides: “New Heavy Duty engines Powering On-Highway Vehicles-MY2007 and later C13
and C15: Caterpillar Inc. warrants to the initial and subsequent owner of a C13 or C15 diesel
engine (powering an on-highway truck).”
As demonstrated by the attached affidavit of Neil Hannemann, all the CAT exhaust
emissions controls used on CAT heavy duty heavy duty diesel engines are “materially identical”
and that representation is well supported by the CAT documents produced. (Exhibit 1). In
addition, Plaintiffs have provided their Rule 26 Expert Report from Mr. Hannemann that the C13
and C15 have a common defect in the 2007 ACERT exhaust emissions control warranted by
CAT.

40 CFR PART 86, Section 86.007-11.

Case 1:12-cv-23927-PAS Document 137 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/06/2014 Page 3 of 10

Plaintiff has sought discovery on the emissions controls designed and employed by CAT
in both C13 and C15. Plaintiffs’ expert’s analysis indicates that:
•
•
•
•
•

The emissions control systems developed by CAT to meet the 2007 EPA Standard is
identical in both the CAT C13 and C15 HDDE engines;
That there is no difference in the operation of CAT’s exhaust emissions controls based
upon the type of vehicle.
The CAT exhaust emission controls are referred to by CAT as its 2007 ACERT
Technology and the Caterpillar Regeneration System;
The 2007 ACERT and its CRS are defective in design, material and workmanship in
breach of the Federal Emission Control warranty; and
CAT’s response to the defects in the 2007 ACERT and the CRS have been the same for
both the C13 and C15 engine.
In addition, in response to Plaintiffs’ Third Request for Production, CAT has produced

hundreds of documents that have redacted information pertaining to the C15 engines,
establishing that CAT is not prejudiced by the discovery sought relating to C15 engines as they
can easily remove their redactions.
ARGUMENT
Defendant claims that it brings its Motion for Reconsideration based upon the newly
discovered fact that its C15 engine was “never sold [] for use in a bus application.” CAT’s
argument fails because: 1) CAT cannot credibly represent that the fact it claims to be “newly
discovered” was not actually known by CAT as early as 2007 when it first sold both the C15 and
C13 engines; 2) the matter for reconsideration is whether information on an identical emissions
control system used by CAT in the C15 engines is discoverable 2 under FRCP 26, not whether
Plaintiffs are typical under FRCP 23 because their busses had C13 as opposed to C15 engines;
and 3) Cat has propounded Rule 34 Second Supplemental Requests For Production, Rule 36
2

The Parties are engaged in pre-certification discovery, as opposed to merits discovery. As the
Court is aware, Supreme Court precedent of recent vintage requires rigorous analysis of Rule 23
requirements, particularly commonality, and predominance. To this end, common defects under
the Federal Emission Control Warranty are likely to be the subject significant discussion and
disagreement between the Parties.

Request To Admit, and Rule 33 Second Supplemental Interrogatories, all seeking discovery from
Plaintiffs on the C15 engines, discovery which Plaintiffs must, and can only, obtain from
Defendant.

1. There Is No Newly Discovered Evidence To Support Defendant’s Request For
Reconsideration.
CAT does not argue that the reconsideration of the Court’s prior discovery ruling is
necessary “to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice”, but rather “the availability of new
evidence.” (D.E. 133, p. 5). CAT claims that the Court’s order “was premised on allegations in
the third amended complaint that Plaintiffs purchased C15 powered engines.” Id. However, the
Court’s ruling does not state any such premise. To the contrary, the ruling states:
“Thus the undersigned concluded that because the C15 engines was part of the now
operative Complaint, the Plaintiffs were entitled to discovery related to that engine…the
undersigned expresses no opinion as to whether the C15 engine should be included in the
class allegations, but rather only opined that the operative complaint contained
allegations related to that engine thereby rendering Plaintiffs request for discovery related
to that engine relevant.”
Clearly, issues pertaining to Rule 23 class certification were expressly not decided by the
Court. Without question, the Third Amended Complaint makes numerous references to the C15
engines far beyond whether or not they were used to power buses, or were purchased by the
Plaintiffs.

EXHAUST

EMISSIONS

(AFTERTREATMENT) CONTROL SYSTEM”; ¶ 69, “COMMONALITY”; ¶¶ 75-80 “CLASS
ACTION REQUIREMENT”; ¶¶ 81-92 “BREACH OF EXPRESS EMISSION CONTROL
WARRANTY”.
Defendant attaches the Robert Niemeier Declaration, Ex. A. for the representation that
“Caterpillar did not sell EPA 2007 compliant C15 engines to any bus manufacturers for use in
bus applications.” Absent from Mr. Niemeier’s Declaration is that Caterpillar did not know this
4

Case 1:12-cv-23927-PAS Document 137 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/06/2014 Page 5 of 10

before November 2013. Defendant, in fact, knew to whom it sold its C15 engines when it sold
them.

2. The Matter For Reconsideration Is One Of Discovery Under Rule 26, Not Class
Certification Under Rule 23.
Defendant, in spite of failing to establish any “newly discovered” evidence to support
reconsideration, proceeds to explain “why discovery directed to the C15 Engine is not
appropriate during pre-certification stage of bifurcated discovery.” Id., p. 6. Defendant asserts
that “merits inquiry [has] no relevance or bearing on the determination of a Rule 23
requirement”.

Apart from acknowledging the significant constriction of Eisen, Defendant

provides no support for the discovery limitations with respect to this evidence or the class
requirements of this case.

Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint defines the CAT engines

subject to the litigation as “2007, 2008 or 2009 (‘2007-9) Caterpillar, Inc. C-13 or C-15 heavy
duty on-highway diesel engine (collectively ‘MY2007 CAT Engine’) containing exhaust
emission controls to reduce diesel engine exhaust emissions in compliance with the EPA’s 2007
Heavy Duty On Highway Emissions Standard.”. TAC, Preamble. And that CAT designed,
equipped, sold and warranted those engines. TAC, ¶¶ 1, 23-47. With respect to the Rule 23
requirements Plaintiffs have alleged the following common questions (TAC, ¶ 70):
a. Whether MY2007 CAT Engines are defective;
b. Whether Defendant manufactured, warranted, distributed, delivered, supplied,
inspected, marketed, leased, and/or sold MY2007 CAT Engines with CRS
exhaust emission controls that, as a matter of course, experienced or caused
repeated instances of engine derating, aftertreatment regeneration devices
plugging, the ARD head failing and/or clogging, as well as other CRS failures
that prevented the engines from properly functioning;
c. Whether Defendant breached its express Emissions Warranty;
d. Whether Defendant breached its implied warranties;
5

Case 1:12-cv-23927-PAS Document 137 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/06/2014 Page 6 of 10

e. Whether the Defendant’s CRS exhaust emission control was defective, which
defect could not be corrected by the replacement of parts or components, or
the employment of reasonable and customary labor;
f. Whether limitation of the Emissions Warranty to repair and replacement, in
the presence of repeated CRS failures, which have not been and cannot be
corrected by CAT, causes the emissions warranty to fail of its essential
purpose.
Expressly, Plaintiffs allege “whether MY2007 CAT Engine’s exhaust emission control,
the CRS, is inherently defective – causing repeated instances of check engine lights illuminating,
engine derating, aftertreatment regeneration devices plugging and/or clogging, as well as other
issues that prevented the engines from properly regenerating”. Id. ¶ 76. As indicated, the
Defendant’s uniform exhaust emission controls are identical in both the C13 and C15 engines;
and that Plaintiff alleges a breach of the Federal Emission Control Warranty both respect to
design and materials and workmanship. To establish defects in design, materials and
workmanship, the performance of similar or identical exhaust emissions controls in the C15
engines is relevant and material. Whether Plaintiffs’ experience with their C13 engines was
caused by driver error and/or failure of maintenance, as Defendant has alleged in its Answer,
makes similar the cause of similar failures, unrelated to driver error and maintenance, in the C15
exhaust emission controls relevant and material. Similarly, the adequacy or inadequacy of
remediation by CAT, and or modifications in design, or equipment, in the C15 exhaust emission
controls is relevant and material to the causes of failures, and adequacy of remediation in the
C13 engines.

3. Defendant Has Propounded Rule 34 Second Supplemental Requests For
Production, Rule 36 Request To Admit, and Rule 33 Second Supplemental
Interrogatories Seeking Discovery From Plaintiffs On The C15 Engines While
Refusing To Provide That Discovery To Plaintiffs
On December 11, 2013, Defendant propounded to each Plaintiff Rule 34 Second
Supplemental Requests For Production, Rule 36 Request To Admit, and Rule 33 Second
Supplemental Interrogatories, all of which relate to the relationship of the C13 to the C15
engines, and, in particular, the Rule 36 Request to Admit requires the discovery regarding the
C15 engine that Defendant refuses to provide. (See, e.g., Exhibits 2, 3, and 4 attached hereto.)
The Plaintiffs’ response to Defendant’s discovery is due January 12, 2013 and, as such, Plaintiffs
request that its Responses to Defendant’s discovery be stayed pending Defendant’s production of
the discovery requested.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court deny Defendant’s Motion For
Reconsideration and stay Plaintiffs’ Responses to Defendant’s Rule 34 Second Supplemental
Requests For Production, Rule 36 Request To Admit, and Rule 33 Second Supplemental
Interrogatories pending Defendant’s production of discovery, and for such other and further
relief as the court deems just under the premises.
