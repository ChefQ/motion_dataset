DEFENDANT’S MOTION AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
FOR: RECONSIDERATION OF THE COURT’S DECEMBER 13, 2013
DISCOVERY ORDER [DE—129] AND TEMPORARY STAY OF
DISCOVERY RELATED SOLELY TO THE C15 ENGINE
Defendant, Caterpillar Inc. (“Caterpillar”), moves pursuant to the Court’s December 17,
2013 Order [DE—132] Cancelling Informal Discovery Hearing and permitting Caterpillar to file
a Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s Prior Discovery Ruling [DE—129] based upon
newly discovered facts as a result of an investigation inspired by the Court’s ruling on November
22, 2013. Caterpillar seeks an order that the scope of pre-certification discovery should not
include the EPA 2007 Compliant C15 Heavy Duty On-Highway Engine (“C15 Engine”) because
Caterpillar never sold it for use in a bus application. Caterpillar also seeks a stay in discovery of
any information related solely to the C15 Engine until at least the resolution of this instant

Motion for Reconsideration. In support thereof, Caterpillar states as follows:

MATERIAL FACTS
Plaintiffs filed their original suit in this matter in May of 2012. Plaintiffs served that
complaint on Caterpillar on October 10, 2012, and Caterpillar removed it to this Court on
October 30, 2012. Since that time, Plaintiffs have filed three amended complaints and the parties
have actively participated in written pre-certification discovery. Until they filed their third
amended complaint on November 15, 2013 [DE—119], the class was clearly defined as
individuals who own or lease buses powered by EPA 2007 Compliant C13 bus engines (“C13
Engine”). Just after their second amended complaint was dismissed in mid-October 2013,
however, Plaintiffs indicated verbally for the first time that they believed the scope of discovery
served to date should have included the C15 Engine.

Caterpillar declined at the time to

voluntarily expand the scope of pre-certification discovery to include the C15 Engine because (i)
it was not part of the class definition in the Second Amended Complaint or any prior complaint,
and (ii) the document requests served up until that time specifically requested C13 Engine
information only.
Shortly after those discussions, but before Plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint,
Plaintiffs served a Fourth Request for Production on October 28, 2013, which was the first
formal request for discovery related to the C15 Engine. On November 22, 2013, Plaintiffs filed
their Fifth Request for Production. The fifth set contains an additional 62 requests seeking
documents related to the C15 Engine nearly identical to those previously sought over the last
year, which were expressly focused on the C13 Engine.

While the parties were negotiating how to deal with Plaintiffs’ effort to expand classcertification discovery to include the C15 Engine even though it is not part of the class, Plaintiffs
filed their third amended complaint. To obviate the need to address whether the C15 Engine was
within the scope of pre-certification discovery, Plaintiffs brought the new class-action complaint
on behalf of individuals who own or lease buses with EPA 2007 Compliant C13 or C15 engines.
This allegation has no evidentiary basis because Caterpillar did not sell any C15 Engines to bus
manufacturers for use in a bus application, which leads Caterpillar to conclude that there are no
class members who own or lease any buses equipped with that engine. See Declaration of
Robert Niemeier, Caterpillar’s Manager of Litigation Technical Support, which is attached to
this motion as Exhibit A, at ¶¶4–6. Indeed, Plaintiffs have identified no C15 engines owned or
leased by any of the putative class members and have acknowledged verbally that they do not
intend to allege that the class includes any buses equipped with a C15 engine.
Since the November 22, 2013 hearing where this issue was discussed, the Parties have
exchanged correspondence as part of Caterpillar’s effort to clarify what is, at best, an ambiguity
in Plaintiffs’ class allegations. See, e.g., correspondence between counsel dated November 29,
2013, December 2, 2013, December 9, 2013, December 12, 2013 and December 16, 2013, which
are attached as Composite Exhibit B.1 At a telephonic meet and confer conducted on the
afternoon of December 11, 2013, Plaintiffs agreed that the C15 Engine was not a bus engine, and
clarified that its class allegations were not intended to include the C15 engine. Plaintiffs’
claimed motivation for including any mention of the C15 was to make a case that the
1.
In this correspondence, Caterpillar also explained to Plaintiffs that if the pre-certification
discovery issues related to the C15 engine cannot be worked out, Caterpillar would need additional time to produce
documents related to the C15 beyond the December 18, 2013 due date. Despite the Court’s encouragement,
Plaintiffs would not agree to or even discuss an agreed extension of time to respond within the deadlines set by the
Court in the most recent scheduling order issued on November 21, 2013 [DE—124]. See DE—129, p. 4 (“the
Parties could agree amongst themselves to extend the response time to discovery requests so long as any agreement
did not run afoul of the deadlines set by the Court in the most recent scheduling order issued on November 21, 2013
[DE—124]”).

aftertreatment systems used on these two different engines was “materially identical.” This
position is consistent with Plaintiffs’ Expert Witness Identification [DE—107].
In that disclosure, Mr. Hannemann makes clear that his anticipated class certification
opinions will be that “[e]ach Plaintiff has experienced CRS faults that are typical of the same
defective systems in the C-13 engine.” Id., ¶I (emphasis added). To be sure, there is no mention
of the C15 Engine in this disclosure, which makes sense since none of the putative class
members own or lease any buses powered by that engine. See DE—107; see also Niemeier
Declaration, Exhibit A, at ¶¶4–6.
Plaintiffs would not agree to remedy the supposed ambiguity in their class allegations,
not even to file a proposed amendment by interlineation that Caterpillar drafted for them. Thus,
the apparent motivation for making this allegation was to expand pre-certification discovery to
include the C15 Engine even though documents related to that engine will not make any of the
factors for pre-certification2 more or less likely for the purpose of determining whether this
matter is proper as a class action.
Given that there are no buses powered by C15 Engines, and the C15 Engine cannot
therefore be a part of Plaintiffs’ putative class, Caterpillar requests this Court to reconsider its
order [DE—129] allowing pre-certification discovery on C15 Engines and requests that this
Court stay any C15 discovery during the pendency of this motion.

These factors include commonality, typicality, adequacy and numerosity. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a).

ARGUMENT
I.

THIS COURT SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS DISCOVERY ORDER BECAUSE INFORMATION
GATHERED SINCE THE NOVEMBER 22, 2013 HEARING CONFIRMS THERE ARE NO
BUSES POWERED BY C15 ENGINES IS MISLEADING
The “purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to correct manifest errors of law or fact

or to present newly discovered evidence.” Burger King Corp. v. Ashland Equities, Inc., 181 F.
Supp. 2d 1366, 1369 (S.D. Fla. 2002). There are three grounds for reconsideration: (1) an
intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence; and (3) the need to
correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice. Id. Here,

Caterpillar

seeks

reconsideration

based on newly discovered facts.
In its Order Following Informal Discovery Hearing, this Court ruled that the scope of
class discovery may include C15 engines. DE—129 at p. 5. This Court’s provided:
At the hearing, after hearing argument from both Parties, the Court noted
that subsequent to the Notice of Hearing being filed, the Plaintiffs filed their Third
Amended Class Action Complaint wherein both the Defendant’s C-13 and C-15
engine were identified as being the subject of the Plaintiffs’ claims (DE # 119).
The undersigned further noted that the Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended
Complaint on November 15, 2013, which was the deadline for the Plaintiffs to file
that Complaint pursuant to the Court’s Order which dismissed the Plaintiffs’
Second Amended Complaint (DE # 110). Thus, the undersigned concluded
that because the C-15 engine was part of the now-operative Complaint, the
Plaintiffs were entitled to discovery related to that engine. The undersigned
made clear, however, that she expressed no opinion as to whether the C-15 engine
should be included in the class allegations, but rather only opined that the
operative complaint contained allegations related to that engine thereby rendering
the Plaintiffs’ requests for discovery related to that engine relevant.
DE—129 at p. 2-3 (emphasis added). As can be seen from the above, the Court’s ruling was
premised on allegations in the third amended complaint that Plaintiffs purchased C15 powered
buses. See DE—119 at p. 1 & ¶¶ 61, 62, 62(a) - (e). After the Court’s Order following the
November 22, 2013 informal discovery hearing [DE—129], Caterpillar conducted a thorough
investigation confirming that it did not sell any C15 Engines for use in a bus application. See

Niemeier Declaration, Exhibit A, ¶4. As part of the meet and confer process, counsel for
Caterpillar discussed this finding with counsel for Plaintiffs on the afternoon of December 11,
2013. At that time, Plaintiffs confirmed that they did not intend to allege that the C15 was used
in a bus application or that the class included owners or lessors of buses powered by the C15.
Instead, the class is comprised of only owners and lessors of buses powered by C13 Engines, and
the purpose behind mentioning the C15 Engine was to emphasize Plaintiffs’ contention that it is
“materially identical” to the C13 Engine.3 Therefore, contrary to the apparently misleading class
allegations in the third amended complaint, there are no putative class members that own or lease
buses powered by C15 Engines. Caterpillar discusses below why discovery directed to the C15
Engine is not appropriate during the pre-certification stage of bifurcated discovery. See this
Court’s most recent scheduling orders [DE—117, DE—124] (bifurcating discovery and limiting
its scope to pre-certification issues until May 2, 2014).
II.

DOCUMENTS RELATED SOLELY TO C15 ENGINE BEYOND SCOPE OF PRECERTIFICATION DISCOVERY
A. The Scope of Pre-Certification Discovery is Limited to That Which Is Relevant to the
Determination of the Requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Rule 23 of the Federal Rules for Civil Procedure governs the certification of class action

lawsuits. In applying the Rule 23 criteria to determine if pre-certification is appropriate, the
court must examine the elements of the parties’ substantive claims and defenses in order to
analyze commonality, typicality, adequacy and numerosity of representation under Rule 23(a)
and maintainability under Rule 23(b). MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION (4th) §21.14. While
courts have acknowledged that some preliminary merits-based inquiry may be required during
the pre-certification phase in order to determine whether the claims and defenses can be

3.
While Caterpillar disagree that the engines’ aftertreatment regeneration systems are materially
identical, this debate is appropriate during the merits stage of this litigation, if ever.

presented and resolved on a class-wide basis, discovery related only to the merits delays the
certification process, may ultimately be unnecessary, and can create extraordinary and
unnecessary expense and burden. Id.
Discovery permitted during the pre-certification stage “must be sufficiently broad in
order that the plaintiffs have a realistic opportunity to meet these [Rule 23] requirements; at the
same time, the defendant must be protected from discovery which is overly burdensome [or]
irrelevant.” National Organization for Women, Farmington Valley Chapter v. Sperry Rand
Corp., 88 F.R.D. 272, 277 (D. Conn. 1980). In so keeping, “discovery is not to be used as a
weapon” and discovery on the merits should not be completed before the pre-certification. Id.
While there is not always a bright line between discovery into certification issues and
discovery into merits issues, certification discovery generally pertains to the requirements of
Rule 23 and tests whether the claims and defenses are subject to class-wide proof, while merits
discovery pertains to the strength and weaknesses of the claims or defenses and tests whether
they are likely to succeed. NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS, § 7:17 (5th Ed.) (2013). Indeed, the
Advisory Committee commented on this in its notes to the 2003 Amendments to Rule 23:
Although an evaluation of the probable outcome on the merits is not properly part
of the certification decision, discovery in aid of the certification decision often
includes information required to identify the nature of the issues that actually will
be presented at trial. In this sense it is appropriate to conduct controlled
discovery into the “merits,” limited to those aspects relevant to making the
certification decision on an informed basis. Active judicial supervision may be
required to achieve the most effective balance that expedites an informed
certification determination without forcing an artificial and ultimately wasteful
division between “certification discovery” and “merits discovery.”
F.R.C.P. 23(c)(1) advisory committee’s note (2003)(emphasis added).

Historically, certification related discovery has been driven by the Supreme Court’s
holding in 1974 that “nothing in either the language or history in Rule 23 . . . gives a court any
authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether
it may be maintained as a class action.” Eisen v. Carlisle and Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177, 94
S. Ct. 2140, 2152, (1974). In 2011, the Supreme Court explained that Eisen did not preclude any
merits discovery during the precertification phase, but held that a court’s class-certification
analysis must be “rigorous” and “may entail some overlap with the merits,” thus courts could
consider the merits if necessary to ascertain whether the prerequisites of Rule 23 have been
satisfied. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011); NEWBERG, §7:17. The
issue was revisited this year when the Court clarified Wal-Mart and stated the current status of
the law in holding:
Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the
certification stage. Merits questions may be considered to the extent—but only to
the extent—that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23
prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.
Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 1194-95 (2013).
From Eisen to Amgen, the Supreme Court has made clear that merits inquiry having no relevance
or bearing on the determination of a Rule 23 requirement should not be considered in the
certification stage.

B. Discovery Related to the C15 Engine, if Relevant to the Case at All, is Purely MeritsBased and is Not Appropriate During the Pre-Certification Phase.
Here, Plaintiffs seek overly burdensome discovery that is irrelevant to pre-certification
issues regarding the Caterpillar C15 Engine. As discussed, Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of
“bus owners and lessees” who purchased or leased a bus “containing a MY2007 CAT engine.”
See third amended complaint, ¶62. (Emphasis added). Plaintiff has defined “MY2007 CAT
engine” as used in the third amended complaint to be a “2007, 2008, or 2009 (“2007-9”)
Caterpillar, Inc. [sic.] C-13 or C-15 heavy duty on-highway diesel engine.” See id., pp. 1–2.
Caterpillar has shown via declaration that there are no C15 engines for bus applications.
Plaintiffs’ counsel has candidly admitted that, contrary to the plain language of their third
amended complaint, Plaintiffs do not intend to allege that there are any C15 engines in any of the
class representatives’ buses nor in any members of the putative class’s buses.

Plaintiffs

explained that their intent was merely to allege that the aftertreament system used in the C13
engines powering the class members’ buses is substantially similar to the aftertreatment system
used in the C15 truck engine. Plaintiffs’ clarification highlights the spurious nature of the
definition of “MY2007 CAT engine” chosen for the third amended complaint, and verifies that
there are no buses with C15 engines at issue in this lawsuit.
Plaintiffs’ disingenuous definition of “MY2007 CAT engine” in the third amended
complaint does nothing to bring the C15 Engine into the scope of discovery such that it would
aid the Court in determining any of the requirements of Rule 23 in this pre-certification stage.
Where Plaintiffs’ counsel admits that there are no C15 Engines in any of the buses that would be
the subject of this lawsuit, discovery related to the C15 Engine could not weigh into account for
the determination as to whether “common questions of law or fact common to class members
predominate over any questions affecting only individual class members.”

23(b)(3). If discovery of evidence related to the C15 is relevant to this case at all, it would go to
the answer to these types of questions,4 falling squarely into the category of merits discovery not
related to determining Rule 23 criteria, and thus, under Amgen, is not appropriate at this precertification stage of the case.
Amgen makes clear that it is the existence and predominance of common questions that
should concern the court at the pre-certification phase—evidence related to the answers to such
questions is merits-based and has no place in pre-certification discovery. Id. at 1195 (“the focus
of Rule 23(b)(3) is on the predominance of common questions”) (emphasis in the original); see
also Rodriguez v. Banco Central, 102 F.R.D. 897, 903 (D.P.R. 1984) (“to best serve the ends of
fairness and efficiency, the Court may direct the parties to focus their initial discovery on matters
pertaining to class questions.”) (emphasis added).

Here, Plaintiffs make no showing how

discovery related to an engine (the C15 Engine) that their counsel admits is not in any of the
buses to be included in the class can assist the Court in determining whether common questions
predominate such to warrant class certification.

4
Plaintiffs recently identified certain documents and statements that lead Caterpillar to conclude
that Plaintiffs intend to argue that the C15 is substantially similar to the C13 such that discovery of documents
related to the C15 may be relevant to the resolution of the allegations in the third amended complaint. Caterpillar
does not agree that the engines are substantially similar, but even if the Court were to determine at some point that
they are, discovery of related models or products that are not at issue in the lawsuit is well established to only be
relevant to notice or causation. United Oil Co., Inc. v. Parts Assoc., Inc., 227 F.R.D. 404, 411 (D. Md. 2005). Both
of these elements are are answers to questions posed by a lawsuit, and are entirely merits-based. They have no
bearing on class certification.

Between the C13 and the C15, only the C13 Engine is incorporated into the at-issue (or
any) buses. Further, Caterpillar has, at great time and expense,5 painstakingly produced the
equivalent of hundreds of thousands of documents related to the C13 Engine. Plaintiffs’ demand
that Caterpillar now undertake in responding to such voluminous and time consuming discovery
at a cost likely to exceed $150,000 during the pre-certification stage for another engine – one
that is by Plaintiffs’ agreement not part of the putative class in this lawsuit – is unreasonable and
unsupported by law. See National Organization for Women, 88 F.R.D. at 277 (“To spend either
three million or three hundred thousand dollars, in order to move a mountain of documents and
statistics from the defendant’s facilities to the plaintiffs’ offices, would be, in this precertification context, a wasteful and unjustifiable action.”). It is precisely this type of abusive
discovery practice in the pre-certification phase that the law has developed to prevent.
Based on Caterpillar’s investigation into the accuracy of Plaintiffs’ class-allegations in
the third amended complaint on which the Court based its December 13, 2013 order, Caterpillar
respectfully requests that the Court reconsider its ruling that the C15 is included in the scope of
the pre-certification discovery. 6 Plaintiffs have admitted and Caterpillar has confirmed through
internal investigation that there are no buses in the class with C15 engines. Because this
indicates that no C15 discovery would assist the Court in resolving the question of commonality
or any other Rule 23 requirement, Caterpillar respectfully requests that the Court enter an order
excluding the C15 from the scope of pre-certification stage of bifurcated discovery.

5.
In responding to the third set of requests to produce alone, Caterpillar’s efforts took 136 days and
roughly 1000 work hours, at a cost of over a quarter million dollars. See Declaration of Patrick Chavez,
Caterpillar’s Discovery Liaison, which is attached to this motion as Exhibit C,¶¶15, 19.
6.
As noted by the Court in its December 13, 2013 Order following an informal discovery hearing
[DE—129], Plaintiffs’ notice of hearing relating to the discoverability of materials concerning the C15 [DE—119]
was filed prior to Plaintiffs’ third amended complaint. Accordingly, the scope of pre-certification discovery
pursuant to the third amended complaint was not set for hearing; rather, the hearing was intended to focus on
whether Caterpillar’s already-served responses at the time should have included materials and information related to
C15 Engines.

III.

DISCOVERY RELATED SOLELY TO THE C15 ENGINE SHOULD BE STAYED PENDING
RESOLUTION OF THIS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
This Court has broad discretion to control discovery. Phipps v. Blakeney, 8 F.3d 788, 790

(11th Cir. 1993). This discretion extends to control over the timing of discovery to protect a
party from annoyance, oppression, or undue burden or expense.

Solar Star Sys., LLC v.

BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., No. 10-21105-CIV, 2011 WL 1226119, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 30,
2011). This also includes the discretion to stay discovery under appropriate circumstances. In
deciding whether to stay discovery pending resolution of a pending motion, the Court must
balance the harm produced by a delay in discovery against the possibility that the motion will be
granted and entirely eliminate the need for such discovery. Feldman v. Flood, 176 F.R.D. 651,
652 (M.D. Fla. 1997). This involves weighing the likely costs and burdens of proceeding with
discovery. Id. To make this analysis a court may “take a preliminary peek at the merits of the
allegedly dispositive motion to see if on its face there appears to be an immediate and clear
possibility that it will be granted.” Id.
This Court ordered Caterpillar to respond to the Fourth Request for Production, which
was deemed served on November 15, 2013, on or before December 18, 2013. DE—129 at p. 5.
Caterpillar timely responded to the Fourth Request for Production on December 18, 2013 by
producing over 1,000 responsive Bates numbered documents related to the C13.7 Caterpillar,
however, requests that this Court stay discovery related to C15 engines in the Fourth and Fifth
Requests for Production until this Court reconsiders its prior ruling that C15 class discovery is
relevant.8

As argued above, C15 Engines are not relevant to class certification issues.

Documents and information concerning those engines are only relevant, if at all, to merits
7.
Many of these Bates numbered materials are native documents, which only receive one Bates
number despite being the equivalent of many printed pages.

For the Court’s reference, Caterpillar attaches copies of the fourth and fifth sets of requests for
production to this motion as Composite Exhibit D.

discovery, which has been stayed by this Court. Accordingly, this Court’s ruling may obviate
entirely the need for this discovery at this stage of the litigation. Cf. Rich v. City of Jacksonville,
No. 3:09-cv-454-J-34MCR, 2010 WL 1141556, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 23, 2010).
Moreover, as detailed in the Declaration of Caterpillar’s discovery liaison, responding to
this discovery will be very costly and burdensome to Caterpillar. See Chavez Declaration,
Exhibit C, ¶¶9–19. On the other hand, the resulting harm to the Plaintiffs if a stay is granted
will be minimal. Plaintiffs waited to formally inject C15 Engines into this litigation until they
filed their third amended complaint on November 15, 2013, after the parties nearly completed
over a year of written discovery on the C13 Engine only. Similarly, there is no mention of the
C15 in Plaintiffs’ expert disclosure.

See DE—107.

These circumstances make clear that

documents related to the C15 Engine will do nothing to make it more or less likely that common
issues prevail over individual ones among a class of owners or lessors of buses powered by C13
Engines.

Accordingly, there can be no prejudice to Plaintiffs by staying this voluminous

production until at least this motion is resolved (and more likely for debate during merits
discovery).

Alternatively, should Caterpillar be required to provide this at-issue discovery

during the pre-certification, it will be impossible for Caterpillar to respond in less that 60 to 75
days for the reasons stated in the declaration of Caterpillar’s discovery liaison. See Exhibit C,
¶¶9, 18.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Caterpillar respectfully requests (i) reconsideration of this
Court’s December 13, 2013 order following an informal discovery hearing [DE—129], and (ii) a
determination that discovery related to the C15 – an engine that does not power any buses owned
or leased by putative class members – is not appropriate during the per-certification stage of
bifurcated discovery. Further, Caterpillar requests entry of an order staying discovery related
solely to the C15 Engine pending resolution of this motion. Alternatively, should the Court
deem discovery related only to the C15 appropriate during the pre-certification stage, Caterpillar
requests 75 days from the date of that order to serve responsive documents.

WHEREFORE Caterpillar requests entry of an Order (i) reconsidering the Court’s
December 13, 2013 Order following an informal discovery hearing [DE—129], (ii) deeming
documents and information related solely to the EPA 2007 Compliant C15 engine beyond the
scope of pre-certification discovery, (iii) staying discovery related solely to the EPA 2007
Compliant C15 engine at least until this motion is resolved, and (iv) awarding Caterpillar any
other relief deemed appropriate.

REQUEST

FOR

HEARING PURSUANT

TO

LOCAL RULE 7.1(b)(2): Caterpillar requests a

twenty minute hearing on this motion for reconsideration. Caterpillar desires a hearing, which
will be beneficial to the Court, because the issues to be determined regarding the scope of
discovery are fact intensive.

GOOD FAITH CONFERENCE PURSUANT

TO

LOCAL RULE 7.1(a)(3): Prior to filing this

motion, counsel for Caterpillar conferred with counsel for Plaintiffs in a good faith effort to
resolve or limit the issues discussed above. Plaintiffs agreed that they did not intend to allege
that there are any buses powered by the C15 or that the class is comprised of owners or lessors of
buses powered by C15 engines. But they refused to withdraw their discovery requests related to
