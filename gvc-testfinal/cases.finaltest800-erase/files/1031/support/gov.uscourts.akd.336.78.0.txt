-2After the complaint was initially filed, the Internal Revenue Service authorized the Department
of Justice to bring a separate action to reduce tax assessments to judgment and to foreclose on
tax liens against Rita M. Hymes, who is the wife of Donald L. Hymes and a party to the instant
suit. The proposed amended complaint, attached as Exhibit A, would add those claims against
Rita Hymes.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This is a civil action brought by the United States of America (1) to reduce to judgment
outstanding federal tax assessments in the amount of $199,456.79 against defendant Donald
Hymes, and (2) to foreclose on federal tax liens against his personal residence, which he shares
with his wife, Rita Hymes. The complaint was filed on June 3, 2005. Defendants Donald and
Rita Hymes each filed answers to the complaint on November 16, 2005.
The complaint originally named Rita Hymes as a defendant because of her interest in the
property that is the subject of this action. The property is located at 2340 Ravenwood,
Fairbanks, Alaska. According to the allegations in the complaint, Donald and Rita Hymes
purchased the property in 1974, and currently reside at the property. In 1988, the Hymeses
purported to transfer their interest in the property to their daughters Zena Hymes and Charla
Hymes. Zena and Charla Hymes then transferred their interests in the property to Aurora Trust,
of which both were trustees. Zena Hymes then transferred an interest in the property to Sunshine
Trust. Rita Hymes is the trustee of Sunshine Trust.
After the initial complaint was filed, the Department of Justice received authorization
from a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce tax assessments to judgment and to

-3foreclose on tax liens against Rita Hymes. These tax liens attach to the property which is the
subject of this action. Accordingly, the United States is now seeking to amend the initial
complaint to include these allegations pertaining to the tax assessments and the federal tax liens
on Rita Hymes’ interest in the property.
ARGUMENT
Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a party to seek leave of the
court to amend its pleading. Leave to amend generally should be freely given when justice so
requires. Gillette v. Tansy, 17 F.3d 308, 312 (10th Cir. 1994). Furthermore, Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 15(d) provides that supplemental pleadings may be added to allege relevant facts
occurring after the original pleading was filed. A supplemental pleading is designed to bring the
action up to date and to set forth new facts affecting the controversy. Manning v. City of
Auburn, 953 F.2d 1355, 1359-1360 (11th Cir. 1992). This policy is to be applied with
"extraordinary liberality." Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Rose, 893 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th
Cir. 1990). Thus, while leave to amend should not be granted automatically, the circumstances
under which Rule 15(a) "permits denial of leave to amend are limited." Ynclan v. Dept. of Air
Force, 943 F.2d 1388, 1391 (5th Cir. 1991). Specifically, leave to amend should be freely given
unless there is undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, undue
prejudice to the opposing party, or the amendment would be futile. See Foman v. Davis, 371
U.S. 178, 182 (1962).
In the instant action, the United States is seeking leave to amend the complaint to include
allegations relating to federal tax assessments against Rita Hymes. Rita Hymes is already named

1875325.1

Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB

-4as a defendant in the action because of her interest in the property on which the United States is
seeking foreclosure. Granting leave to amend the complaint would allow for the United States to
incorporate these new but related allegations against Rita Hymes and allow for any subsequent
foreclosure on the property to satisfy the tax liabilities of both owners.
Legal action regarding the assessments against Rita Hymes was not authorized until after
the initial complaint was filed. There is no bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the United
States, and amending the complaint will not prejudice the opposition because the assessments
against Rita Hymes represent outstanding tax liabilities that will be pursued by the government
regardless of the outcome of this motion. Because a scheduling order has not yet been entered in
this case, neither parties have commenced discovery. Thus, the facts surrounding the federal tax
liabilities of both Mr. and Mrs. Hymes can be discovered at the same time in the course of the
same civil action. Granting leave to amend the complaint would simply incorporate the related
allegations against Rita Hymes and allow the disposition of the property to be determined as part
of the same action, thus promoting judicial economy.
