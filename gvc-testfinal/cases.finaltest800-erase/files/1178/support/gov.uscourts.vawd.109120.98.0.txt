DOE PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO PROCEED UNDER PSEUDONYMS AND
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 1 of 18 Pageid#: 418

INTRODUCTION
The Doe Plaintiffs are an African-American man and three female members of a Jewish
synagogue in Charlottesville, who protested Defendants’ neo-Nazi and white supremacist march
in Charlottesville on August 11-12, 2017, and were attacked and threatened by Defendants, coconspirators, and their supporters. The Court should permit the Doe Plaintiffs to proceed under
pseudonyms in this case to protect them from further threats and physical and emotional harm.
Defendants, their co-conspirators, and their supporters openly advocate and planned for
violence against the Doe Plaintiffs, and have already physically attacked and threatened them.
Defendant and co-conspirator James Fields hit one of the Doe Plaintiffs with a car in a deadly
attack that killed one person and injured dozens of others, causing her to suffer severe injuries.
He barely missed another Doe Plaintiff in the same attack, but she was close enough that her
shirt was sprayed with the blood of the victims. Defendants and co-conspirators attacked
individuals, including other Doe Plaintiffs, with mace or another type of caustic substance, and
made threats against all of them, including “let’s fucking gas the kikes and have a race war” and
called for “ethnic cleansing.” Defendants do not even try to hide their calls for violence against
the Doe Plaintiffs, as they openly proclaim “we look up to men like Adolf Hitler . . . as
inspirations for what we can achieve.”
Defendants also have a practice of disclosing and publishing the identities of individuals
that oppose their message and conduct, so that those individuals become greater targets for
violence and threats from Defendants, their co-conspirators, and sympathizers.
Unless the Doe Plaintiffs are allowed to proceed anonymously, their identities will be
public and they will be subject to further violence and threats from Defendants, co-conspirators,

and their supporters because of their race, religion, status as plaintiffs, and because they
protested Defendants’ hateful beliefs.

Defendants Commit and Promote Racist and Anti-Semitic Violence.

Defendants are neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and white supremacists who espouse racist and
anti-Semitic ideologies and conspired to cause the violence and harassment in Charlottesville on
August 11 and 12. Compl., ¶¶ 21-45. Defendants and their followers explicitly advocate
violence against African Americans and Jews, and several Defendants have committed such
violence. Their hate-based violence and threats are well documented, and include:
•

On August 12, 2017, Defendant Fields drove a Dodge Challenger into a crowd of
peaceful counter-protesters in Charlottesville, injuring dozens -- including several
plaintiffs in this case -- and killing a 32-year old woman, Heather Heyer. Id., ¶
24. He is charged with second degree murder, malicious wounding, and hit and
run. Id.

•

After Defendant Fields’s attack, Defendant Loyal White Knights changed its
outgoing voicemail message to say: “Nothing makes us more proud at the KKK
than when we see white patriots such as James Fields, Jr., age 20, taking his car
and running over nine communist anti-fascist, killing one nigger-lover named
Heather Heyer. James Fields hail victory. It’s men like you that have made the
great white race strong and will be strong again.” Id., ¶ 44.

•

Defendant Tubbs previously served a four-year prison sentence for planning to
bomb Jewish- and black-owned businesses in Florida. Id., ¶ 36.

•

Defendant Kessler attacked a man in downtown Charlottesville while collecting
signatures for his petition to remove the African-American vice mayor, Wes
Bellamy, from the Charlottesville City Council. Id., ¶ 21.

•

Defendant Cantwell suggests to his followers “let’s fucking gas the kikes and
have a race war.” Compl., ¶ 23. He has been charged with two felony counts of
illegal use of tear gas and one felony count of malicious bodily injury by means of
a caustic substance for his actions in Charlottesville on August 11-12. Id., ¶ 23.

•

Defendant Daily Stormer calls its website the “world’s most genocidal” website,
and includes sections titled “Jewish Problem” and “Race War.” Id., ¶ 26.

•

Defendant Ray threatened to intimidate and harass Charlottesville’s Jewish
population, carried a banner (later posted on Defendant Daily Stormer’s website)
that read: “Gas the kikes, race war now!” Id., ¶ 187.

•

Defendant Spencer has called for “ethnic cleansing.” Id., ¶ 22.

•

In the run-up to the Charlottesville rally, Defendant Hill tweeted: “If you want to
defend the South and Western civilization from the Jew and his dark-skinned
allies, be at Charlottesville on 12 August,” and Defendant Daily Stormer wrote
“Next stop: Charlottesville, VA. Final stop: Auschwitz.” Id., ¶ 4, 94.

•

Defendant Heimbach, co-chair of the umbrella organization of approximately
twenty white supremacist organizations, Klan groups, and neo-Nazi groups, has
explained “we look up to men like Adolf Hitler . . . as inspirations for what we
can achieve.” Id., ¶ 32.

•

Defendant Traditionalist Worker Party has said: “Trust nobody who fails to name
the Jew, who fails to explicitly and consistently oppose the Jew, and who
preaches cleverness or nuance on the JQ [Jewish Question].” Id., ¶ 34.

•

Defendant Nationalist Front was conceived to be “the thread that would unite
white supremacist and white nationalist circles.” Id., ¶ 40.

•

Defendant Augustus Sol Invictus has said that a violent, second Civil War is
necessary. Id., ¶ 41.

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 4 of 18 Pageid#: 421

Many of Defendants utilize social media and other platforms allowing them to reach and
mobilize scores of devout followers. See id., ¶¶ 21-45. Not only do the Defendants themselves
murder, attack, threaten and/or harass Jews and non-whites, they urge and conspire with their
compatriots to engage in similar actions in the name of neo-Nazism and white supremacy.
Supra, pp. 2-3. Defendants organized and promoted a neo-Nazi and white supremacist march in
Charlottesville, Virginia, that took place on August 11-12, 2017. Compl., ¶¶ 1, 3. The marchers
came from all over to attend. Id., ¶ 1. The purpose of the march was to inflict violence and
instill fear on people who are targets of Defendants’ hatred, specifically Jews and African
Americans such as John Doe and Jane Does 1-3. Id., ¶¶ 21-45.
Defendants and their co-conspirators also engage in a practice known as “doxing,” where
they ascertain and then publish the personal information (such as names and addresses), of
people who oppose them or who are the targets of their hate. Compl., ¶¶ 127, 130-32. For
example, Defendant East Coast Knights published on the internet the home address of a woman
who opposed it, and told its followers “[w]e will be having a rally at this address next week.
Bring your own torch.” Id., ¶ 125. Another co-conspirator posted the address of a block party in
Charlottesville, describing it as a “Negro block party,” and urged other white supremacists to
attend, prompting one follower to suggest “[w]e shank them.” Id., ¶ 126. When Defendants’
opponents are identified, they are often subjected to death threats or other harm by Defendants or
their supporters. Indeed, the mother of the woman who was killed by Defendant Fields has
already received scores of death threats just for speaking out against Defendants and their cause. 1

C.

Defendants’ Violence and Harassment on August 11, 2017.

On August 11, 2017, Defendants organized and engaged in a torchlight march in
Charlottesville, which was to culminate at the statue of Thomas Jefferson near the Rotunda at
UVA. Id., ¶ 133; Exhibit 1, ¶ 4; Exhibit 4, ¶ 3. John Doe and Jane Doe 1 -- a male African
American and a female Jew, respectively -- were part of a small group of around 30 community
members and students who had gathered at the Rotunda to peacefully protest Defendants’ march.
Exhibit 1, ¶ 4; Exhibit 4, ¶ 3.
As Defendants’ mob reached the steps of the Rotunda, hundreds of neo-Nazis and white
supremacists descended upon John Doe, Jane Doe 1, and the others in their group who had
locked arms around the Thomas Jefferson statue. Exhibit 1, ¶ 5; Exhibit 4, ¶ 4. The mob
encircled John Doe and Jane Doe 1 and the other students, and blocked them from leaving the
area. Exhibit 1, ¶ 5; Exhibit 4, ¶ 4. Defendants and their co-conspirators shouted threats and
racist and anti-Semitic chants, including making monkey noises at the black protesters, and
shouting “blood and soil” (a Nazi slogan) and “Jews will not replace us.” Exhibit 1, ¶ 5; Exhibit
4, ¶ 4. At one point, Defendant Ray shouted, “The heat here is nothing compared to what you’re
going to get in the ovens!” Compl., ¶ 156. John Doe was one of the few African-American men
present, and he and Jane Doe 1 were each terrified and feared for their lives. Exhibit 1, ¶ 5;
Exhibit 4, ¶¶ 3-4. Members of Defendants’ mob also sprayed John Doe and Jane Doe 1 with
mace or another type of caustic substance, which caused their eyes to burn and made it difficult
to breathe. Exhibit 1, ¶ 5; Exhibit 4, ¶ 4.
As Defendants and their co-conspirators entrapped the peaceful protesters, they began to
throw their torches at the students. Exhibit 4, ¶ 4. Fearing for their lives, John Doe and Jane Doe
1 struggled to escape and eventually fled, while Defendants, with their followers and co-

5
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 6 of 18 Pageid#: 423

conspirators climbed to the top of the Thomas Jefferson statue and waved their torches high in
the air, yelling, “Hail Spencer! Hail victory!” Compl., ¶ 160; Exhibit 1, ¶ 5; Exhibit 4, ¶ 4.
D.

Defendants’ Violence and Harassment on August 12, 2017.

The following day, August 12, 2017, John Doe and Jane Does 1-3 all peacefully
protested Defendants’ march. Exhibit 1, ¶ 6; Exhibit 2, ¶ 4; Exhibit 3, ¶ 4; Exhibit 4, ¶ 5. During
the march, Defendants and their supporters carried anti-Semitic signs, wore Nazi swastikas, and
yelled and chanted anti-Semitic, racist, and pro-Nazi slogans, such as “Heil Hitler,” “Jews will
not replace us,” and “blood and soil.” Exhibit 3, ¶ 5; Exhibit 4, ¶ 5.
At one point, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 3 were on Fourth Street in downtown
Charlottesville, when Defendant Fields intentionally drove a car into the crowd of peaceful
protesters, killing a 32-year old woman, Heather Heyer, and injuring dozens of others. Compl.,
¶¶ 226-30; Exhibit 1, ¶ 7; Exhibit 3, ¶ 7. Jane Doe 1 was directly hit by Defendant Fields’s
vehicle. Exhibit 3, ¶ 9. Her sister, Jane Doe 3, who had been steps away from the attack, was so
close to the impact that blood of the victims sprayed onto her shirt. Exhibit 3, ¶ 8. In the
commotion after the attack, Jane Doe 3 initially could not find Jane Doe 1, but eventually found
her lying on the ground in shock and seriously injured. Exhibit 3, ¶ 9. The crash broke both of
her legs, and caused severe contusions, a concussion, and bleeding from her head. Exhibit 1, ¶¶
8-9; Exhibit 3, ¶ 9. Jane Doe 3 remained by her sister’s side and helped provide first aid for
nearly 30 minutes while they waited for an ambulance to take them to the emergency room.
Exhibit 1, ¶ 8; Exhibit 3, ¶ 10.
When the girls arrived at the hospital, Jane Doe 3 called her mother, Jane Doe 2, to let
her know what happened. Exhibit 2, ¶ 6; Exhibit 3, ¶ 10. When she arrived at the hospital it was
on lockdown due to the mass casualty event and was not allowing any family members of the

6
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 7 of 18 Pageid#: 424

wounded to enter. Exhibit 2, ¶ 6; Exhibit 3, ¶ 10. Jane Doe 2 finally found Jane Doe 3, who
collapsed into her mother’s arms, physically and emotionally exhausted. Exhibit 2, ¶ 6; Exhibit
3, ¶ 10.
When Jane Doe 2 was finally able to enter the hospital, she waited to hear any updates
about her daughter’s condition. Exhibit 2, ¶ 7. Watching the news in the waiting room, Jane
Doe 2, for the first time, saw the video of Defendant Fields driving into the crowd where her
daughters had been -- playing over and over on television. Id.
Jane Doe 1 required major surgery to repair bone and multiple ligaments, and spent
several days in the hospital. Exhibit 1, ¶ 9. Her recovery will take over a year and will require
extensive physical therapy sessions several times each week. Id. In addition to her severe
physical injuries, Jane Doe 1 also suffered emotional distress as a result of the attack. Exhibit 1,
¶ 9. She has been unable to return to school full time. Id.
Jane Doe 2, who was with her daughters shortly before the attack, has been unable to
resume a normal life. Exhibit 2, ¶ 8. She spends much of her time caring for her daughter, Jane
Doe 1. Id. She has sought psychological support for herself and her family, and suffers from
anxiety, which manifests in difficulty sleeping and difficulty focusing. Id.
Jane Doe 3, who only narrowly missed being struck in the attack, suffered severe
emotional distress as a result of Defendants’ conduct and attack on August 12. Exhibit 3, ¶ 11.
She spends a significant amount of time taking care of her sister, Jane Doe 1, and has not been
able to work or seek employment as a result. Id. She suffers from crippling anxiety, has had
difficulty sleeping and focusing, and has become hyper-vigilant and severely anxious in public
spaces after the attack. Id.

7
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 8 of 18 Pageid#: 425

John Doe suffered numerous emotional injuries as a result of the events on August 11-12,
2017. Exhibit 4, ¶ 6. He has had difficulty focusing in school, and when he walks past the
Thomas Jefferson statue on campus, he immediately recalls the harm, threats, and fear he
suffered. Id. He has also had trouble sleeping and developed a heightened, anxious sense of
awareness in public spaces. Id.
After the events on August 11-12, the Doe Plaintiffs met with a security expert and have
taken steps to increase their safety and guard against further harm from Defendants and their
supporters. Id., ¶ 7; Exhibit 1, ¶ 10; Exhibit 2, ¶ 9; Exhibit 3, ¶ 12.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE COURT SHOULD PERMIT THE DOE PLAINTIFFS TO PROCEED
ANONYMOUSLY.
A.

The Court Has Discretion to Allow Plaintiffs to Proceed Anonymously.

“Federal courts traditionally have recognized that in some cases the general presumption
of open trials -- including identification of parties and witnesses by their real names -- should
yield in deference to sufficiently pressing needs for party or witness anonymity.” James v.
Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 242 (4th Cir. 1993). “The crucial interests served by open judicial
proceedings are not compromised by allowing a party to proceed anonymously,” because “[i]f a
plaintiff is granted leave to proceed under a pseudonym, the public is not denied its right to
attend the proceedings or inspect the court’s opinions and orders.” Doe v. Alger, 317 F.R.D. 37,
39 (W.D. Va. 2016) (citations omitted). Thus, a federal court may exercise its discretion to
allow parties to proceed anonymously. James, 6 F.3d at 242.
In deciding whether to allow a party to proceed under a pseudonym, the Court will
balance the party’s interest in anonymity against the public interest in openness and any
prejudice to the defendants. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *1
8
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 9 of 18 Pageid#: 426

(D. Md. 2017). Under this analysis, the Fourth Circuit has identified a non-exhaustive list of
factors the Court should consider:
(1) whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid the
annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or is to preserve privacy in
a matter of sensitive and highly personal nature;
(2) whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to
the requesting party or even more critically, to innocent non-parties;
(3) the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected;
(4) whether the action is against a governmental or private party; and
(5) the risk of unfairness to the opposing party from allowing an action against it
to proceed anonymously.
Id. (citing James, 6 F.3d at 238-39). Consideration of these factors show the Court should
exercise its discretion to allow the Doe Plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonyms.
B.

The Doe Plaintiffs Already Suffered Violence and Harm from Defendants
and Their Supporters, and Are at Risk of Further Retaliatory Harm.

Courts routinely permit plaintiffs to proceed anonymously where there is a risk they
could be subject to “retaliation, physical harm or harassment” if their identities are disclosed.
E.g., Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *1-2 (allowing plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonyms where
there was a risk plaintiffs would be subjected to physical harm if their identities were disclosed);
Alger, 317 F.R.D. at 40 (“Doe’s identification . . . would likely increase his risk of [physical or
mental] harm from other persons.”); Doe v. New Ritz, Inc., 2015 WL 4389699, at *2 (D. Md.
2015) (allowing plaintiff to proceed under pseudonym where she had a “fear of physical and
mental harm” as a result of retaliation by defendants); see also Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 186
(5th Cir. 1981) (“Evidence on the record indicates that the Does may expect extensive
harassment and perhaps even violent reprisals if their identities are disclosed.”); Doe v. Shakur,
164 F.R.D. 359, 362 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“Plaintiff’s allegation that she has been subjected to death
9
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 10 of 18 Pageid#: 427

threats would provide a legitimate basis for allowing her to proceed anonymously.”); Doe v.
Barrow County, Ga., 219 F.R.D. 189, 193 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (allowing plaintiff to proceed
anonymously where others sharing her view received “boos” and were told to “shut up and sit
down,” and plaintiff feared retaliation for filing the lawsuit). This factor “weighs heavily” on the
analysis. Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *2.
If a plaintiff was already threatened or harmed by a defendant, that alone is a sufficient
basis to find there is a risk of retaliation, harm or harassment. Javier H. v. Garcia-Botello, 211
F.R.D. 194, 196 (W.D.N.Y. 2002) (allowing use of pseudonym where “[d]efendants have
threatened [plaintiffs] with violence in the past, and have demonstrated a willingness to carry out
those threats.”); Roe v. Providence Health Sys.-Or., 2007 WL 1876520, at *2 (D. Or. 2007)
(allowing use of pseudonym where plaintiff “suffered past violence” inflicted by defendant).
The risk of harm does not need to be certain or even probable. Rather, even “[p]otential
retaliatory physical or mental harm” is a sufficient basis to proceed anonymously. Trump, 2017
WL 818255, at *2. It is enough that a plaintiff “fears that disclosure of his participation in this
case could result in retaliation” or that she “may be harassed.” Id. at *2 (emphasis added) (citing
Does I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1071 (9th Cir. 2000) (explaining it
is enough if plaintiffs “fear” retaliation, and they “do not need to prove that they face a danger of
physical injury”) (emphasis in original)).
Courts will also permit anonymity if the disclosure of a plaintiff’s identity could
jeopardize the safety of their family members or subject them to harm or harassment. Trump,
2017 WL 818255, at *1 (allowing plaintiffs to proceed anonymously where harm could come “to
themselves or innocent family members”); Nelson v. Green, 2007 WL 984127, at *2 (W.D. Va.
2007) (allowing plaintiff-father to proceed anonymously to protect identity of plaintiff-daughter).

10
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 11 of 18 Pageid#: 428

Here, this factor “weighs heavily” in the Doe Plaintiffs’ favor.
First, the Doe Plaintiffs have all already been physically and/or emotionally injured by
the actions of Defendants and their supporters and co-conspirators. Defendant Fields struck Jane
Doe 1 with a car, causing severe physical injuries, including two broken legs. Supra, pp. 6-7.
Other co-conspirators sprayed John Doe and Jane Doe 1 with mace, and showered them with
threats and insults. Supra, pp. 4-5. Jane Doe 3 narrowly missed the car attack, but suffered the
emotional trauma of her sister being run over right beside her. Supra, pp. 6-7. Jane Doe 2 had to
watch video of Defendant Fields intentionally running over her daughter with a car, causing her
severe anxiety and requiring her to seek professional psychological support. Supra, pp. 6-7.
Second, if their identities are revealed, it is likely Doe Plaintiffs will face further
retaliatory harm and harassment. Defendants have repeatedly conspired to cause, called for, and
supported violence and harassment directed at African Americans, Jews, and others who protest
on their behalf, suggesting, for example, that people “gas the kikes” and start “ethnic cleansing.”
Supra, pp. 2-3. And, Defendants are well-known for publicly revealing and disseminating the
identities of people who speak out against them, encouraging and eliciting further threats of
violence, and potentially acts of violence, against innocent people -- such as the Doe Plaintiffs -who oppose Defendants’ race-based hatred. Supra, p. 3. The disclosure of the Doe Plaintiffs’
identities will expose them to additional harm by Defendants, their co-conspirators and other
sympathizers of Defendants who want to show support for the neo-Nazi and white supremacy
cause. After surviving Defendants’ violence on August 11-12 -- including a car attack that
already killed one peaceful protester -- the Court should not force the Doe Plaintiffs to risk
exposure to further retaliatory violence, threats, or harassment at the hands of Defendants, their
co-conspirators, or their supporters.

11
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 12 of 18 Pageid#: 429

Third, the Jane Does are all closely related family members. Thus, if any of them are
denied the right to proceed anonymously, it would be easy for Defendants or an assailant to
identify the others, which would jeopardize their safety and subject them to harm or harassment.
Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *1 (allowing plaintiffs to proceed anonymously where disclosure of
their true names could result in harm to “innocent family members”).
C.

Identification of the Jane Doe Plaintiffs Would Reveal Their “Highly
Personal” Religious Identity.

Courts will allow a plaintiff to proceed anonymously if the plaintiff seeks to do so, not to
avoid “annoyance and criticism,” but to preserve “highly personal” information that the plaintiff
does not want defendants or others to associate with her. Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *2
(granting permission to proceed anonymously where plaintiffs’ “religious faith . . . if disclosed,
could jeopardize their safety”); New Ritz, Inc., 2015 WL 4389699, at *2 (“Doe is not merely
concerned with avoiding annoyance or criticism; her unrebutted affidavit articulates a legitimate
fear of physical and mental harm.”). “[R]eligion is perhaps the quintessentially private matter.”
Stegall, 653 F.2d at 186; Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *2 (“[A] privacy concern relating to
religious faith . . . . [is] sensitive and personal in nature.”); Doe v. Porter, 370 F.3d 558, 560 (6th
Cir. 2004) (holding “personal beliefs and practices” are a “private matter” and allowing plaintiffs
to proceed anonymously).
Here, Defendants espouse pro-Nazi beliefs, hatred and violence toward Jews, suggested
that people “gas the kikes,” call for “ethnic cleansing,” urge their supporters to “defend the South
and Western civilization from the Jew,” propose “Final Stop: Auschwitz,” say they “look up to
men like Adolf Hitler,” and demand that others “consistently oppose the Jew.” Supra, pp. 2-3.
Jane Does 1-3 are members of a Jewish synagogue in Charlottesville. Thus, the public
identification of the Jane Does would allow Defendants to identify them as prime targets of their
12
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 98 Filed 11/13/17 Page 13 of 18 Pageid#: 430

violence and hatred. This “could jeopardize their safety,” and would only exacerbate the
likelihood of further harm, threats, and harassment the Jane Does would receive from Defendants
and their supporters. See Trump, 2017 WL 818255, at *2.
D.

Defendants Will Not Be Prejudiced.

There will be no prejudice to Defendants by the Doe Plaintiffs proceeding anonymously.
There are eleven plaintiffs in this case, and countless witnesses to Defendants’ conduct, so many
of the relevant facts will come from witnesses other than the Doe Plaintiffs. Barrow County,
Ga., 219 F.R.D. at 194 (holding there was no prejudice from plaintiff proceeding anonymously
because many facts “will likely come from witnesses other than the plaintiff”). And, Plaintiffs’
counsel will disclose the Doe Plaintiffs’ identities to the Court, and will negotiate an appropriate
protective order with defense counsel if, for example, “attorney’s eyes only” treatment of the
Does’ identities is appropriate. 2 E.g., id. at 193 (allowing plaintiff to proceed anonymously
where her identity would be revealed to the court and counsel for the defense).
E.

The Other Factors Do Not Outweigh Plaintiffs’ Interest in Proceeding
Anonymously.

The remaining factors -- whether any plaintiffs are minors, and whether the lawsuit is
against the government -- do not apply. See New Ritz, Inc., 2015 WL 4389699, at *2 (granting
permission to proceed anonymously, and noting that where parties were not minors, “[t]he third
factor does not apply”). Thus, the only applicable considerations weigh heavily in favor of the
Doe Plaintiffs proceeding anonymously in this case.

2

Defendants’ counsel, for the most part, has not yet entered an appearance in this matter,
so Plaintiffs’ counsel cannot yet consider the propriety of disclosing the Doe Plaintiffs’ identities
to defense counsel under an “attorney’s eyes only” designation.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant this Motion and order that the Doe
