DEFENDANT CITY OF BOSTON’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT
OF ITS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE THIRD PARTY COMPLAINT
AGAINST PSYCHEMEDICS CORPORATION
I.

BACKGROUND
This case is based on claims made by individual officers and MAMLEO, an

organization “represent[ing] the interests of all BPD law enforcement personnel and
applicants of color” (First Amended and Supplemental Complaint, ¶ 24). Plaintiffs allege
that the hair testing program in place at the BPD is “flawed” and results in “racially
biased” results, and is unlawful because it has a disparate impact on officers and
candidates of color, used despite the availability of alternative testing methods and
procedures, and constitutes discrimination. (First Amended and Supplemental
Complaint, ¶ ¶ 1, 2).

Plaintiffs specifically attack the validity of the hair test that is performed by
Psychemedics Corporation, the laboratory that performs the hair drug test under contract
with the City. See Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel,
docket number 60, at page 2: “Psychemedics’s flawed, imprecise, unreliable, arbitrary,
and racially biased drug test performed on hair samples (the “Hair Test”) is at the heart of
this civil rights action…”
Currently, the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Psychemedics to produce its standard
operating procedures is pending before the Court. The Court has scheduled a hearing on
the pending discovery motions, including all motions to compel, for October 24, 2007.
By agreement, the Court and the parties have divided the discovery events of the
case into roughly two stages, the first dealing with issues impacting the claims common
to all plaintiffs, and the issues peculiar to each plaintiff during the second. In so doing,
the Court directed that the litigation was primarily concerned with the accuracy and
validity of the hair drug test. See Electronic Clerk’s Notes for proceedings held before
Judge George A. O’Toole Jr., entered on the docket on February 9, 2006:
The court sets a status conference to take the temperature of the case as
counsel proceed along with the idea being primarily to the science but to
the extent that that requires knowing what happened to single people,
aspects of reliability and so on.

To date, none of the discovery conducted has involved the science of hair drug
testing, and the parties have agreed that all expert discovery will be commenced only
after the Court has ruled on the pending motions to compel. See Docket Number 44.
The City and Psychemedics are parties to a contract for the provision of hair drug
testing services. The contract contains an Amendment to the City’s standard contract that
sets forth express indemnification provisions, in pertinent part as follows:

7.2
The Contractor shall bear all loss resulting from the Contractor’s
wrongful or negligent acts or omissions before performance of services is
completed and after performance of services if the service or work product
fails to conform to specifications.
….
7.3
The Contractor shall assume the defense of and hold the City, its
officers, agents or employees, harmless from all suits and claims against
them or any of them arising from any wrongful or negligent act or
omission of the Contractor, its agents or employees, in any way connected
with performance under this Contract.
…
Contract 99-2807 (1998 – 1999) attached hereto as Exhibit A1.
The City seeks leave, pursuant to Rule 14(a), to file a Third Party complaint
against Psychemedics for indemnification and contribution. A copy of the proposed
complaint is attached as Exhibit B.

ARGUMENT

A.

Standard Of Review
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 14(a), provides that “At any time after the

commencement of an action the defending party, as a third party plaintiff, may cause a
summons and complaint to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or
who may be liable to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff’s claim against
the third-party plaintiff.” If the third-party seeks to file the third-party claim more than
ten days after serving the original answer, the party must obtain leave of court upon
notice to all parties to the action before so filing. F.R.Civ.P. Rule 14(a). Whether to
allow that leave is a matter of discretion of the district court, which should allow
impleader on any colorable claim of derivative liability that will not unduly delay or
otherwise prejudice the ongoing proceedings. Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio, LLC, 166
F.3d 389, 393 (1st Cir. 1999). Among the factors to be considered by the district court is

the merit or substance of the third party complaint. Davis et al. v. Protection One Alarm
Monitoring, Inc., 2005 WL 3728711 (D.Mass.)
1.

The Proposed Third Party Complaint is Meritorious

As is clear in this case, the “heart” of the action is whether the testing procedures
used by Psychemedics are reliable. The City’s liability to the Plaintiffs, if any, will only
stem from a finding that Psychemedics’s procedures are, as Plaintiffs claim, flawed or
unreliable.
Pursuant to the contract between the City and Psychemedics, Psychemedics has
expressly contracted to indemnify the City for any loss occasioned by its wrongful acts,
omissions, or negligence. Thus, should there be a finding that Psychemedics protocols
are insufficient in any respect, and should damages be charged against the City as a
result, Psychemedics is contractually obliged to protect the City from those damages.
Similarly, by statute, “whenever two or more persons are jointly liable in tort for
the same injury to person or property, there shall be a right of contribution among them.”
G.L. c. 231B § 1(a). According to the interpretation by the Supreme Judicial Court, “the
language of this statute requires that the potential contributor be directly liable to the
plaintiff.” Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Westerlind, 374 Mass. 524, 526 (1978). Because
the basis of liability, if any, against the City would be only occasioned by a failure of
Psychemedics’s testing procedures, Psychemedics is potentially directly liable to the
Plaintiffs in this case.
2.

Allowance Of The Third-Party Complaint Will Not Cause Prejudice or
Delay

Although fact discovery has been conducted by the parties, it is undisputed that all
discovery related to the Psychemedics protocols and the science of hair testing, in
general, has not yet commenced. Discovery in fact has been limited to Plaintiffs’
4

Case 1:05-cv-11832-GAO

Document 74

Page 5 of 7

examination of the various City officials who have been involved in the decision to
implement hair drug testing, in union negotiations, and in the imposition of discipline
upon notification of a positive test result. None of these discovery events touch upon the
potential liability of Psychemedics, and it cannot claim any prejudice for not having
appeared as a party defendant in the fact discovery component of this litigation.
Allowing the City to file its third-party complaint will not occasion any delay in
this action. As already discussed, expert discovery is held in abeyance with the Court’s
permission pending the resolution of the outstanding motions to compel. Psychemedics
is already a party to one motion, that addressing the ability of Plaintiffs to obtain the
laboratory’s standard operating procedures. Thus, Psychemedics is likely to be
intimately involved in expert discovery, at least to the extent that some or all of its
laboratory procedures will be reviewed, and its scientists potentially deposed. Since
none of these events have yet been scheduled, and since Psychemedics has been on notice
and able to protect its interest since Plaintiffs subpoenaed their documents, no delay in
this matter is anticipated if Psychemedics becomes a party defendant.
3.

The Interests of Judicial Economy Favor Impleader

The expert issues in this case are wholly related to the procedures used by
Psychemedics in performing its hair drug testing. It makes sense for Psychemedics to be
involved in this case not only as witness, but as a party fully able to participate in the
anticipated expert discovery. Psychemedics is better poised to defend its standard
operating procedures against Plaintiffs’ challenges than is the City, and allowing it to do
so in this initial litigation could potentially eliminate the need for any successor litigation
should the Plaintiffs’ prevail. If Psychemedics were not a party to this action, it is
conceivable that a second litigation could result from this action, wherein the City
invokes its right to indemnity under the contract, and Psychemedics challenges any
5

finding that its procedures were flawed. Any such finding may no be used as res judicata
or collateral estoppel if Psychemedics did not have an opportunity to litigate the issue in
the first action. Innovad Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 260 F.3d 1326, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2001).
Thus, it would be possible that the City would be forced to relitigate the same issues in
subsequent litigation – needlessly, since the issues could be resolved definitively if
Psychemedics were made a party to this action.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein, the City requests that the Court grant it leave to file

a third-party complaint against Psychemedics Corporation in this action.
