Plaintiffs Ronnie Jones, Richard Beckers, Walter Washington, William Earl Bridgeforth,
Shawn N. Harris, Eugene Wade, George C. Downing, Jr., Clararise Bristow, Rachelle Couch,
Keri Hogan, and the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers,
(hereinafter, “Plaintiffs”) hereby oppose the Defendant City of Boston’s Motion For Leave to
File Third Party Complaint Against Psychemedics Corporation (“Defendants’ Motion”).
BACKGROUND
This is a civil rights action concerning the defendants’1 flawed, imprecise, unreliable,
arbitrary, and racially biased mandatory drug test performed on hair samples (the “Hair Test”).
As Plaintiffs have alleged, the Hair Test is unlawful because, among other reasons, it has a
disparate, adverse, and discriminatory impact on Boston police officers and applicants of color
because these officers and applicants are more likely than other officers and applicants to have a
“false positive” on the Hair Test. In addition to challenging the scientific validity of the Hair
Test performed by Psychemedics, Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Defendants’ use of
the Hair Test in making employment decisions (1) disproportionately and adversely impacts
police officers and applicants of color and (2) constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis of
race as well as on the basis of a false and erroneous perception of a disability. First Amended
and Supplemental Complaint, ¶ 6.
On July 26, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants in Suffolk Superior
Court. On September 9, 2005, the Defendants removed the case to the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts. On April 7, 2006, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended
and Supplemental Complaint. On February 23, 2006, the parties filed a Joint Statement Pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(1) and Local Rule 16.1 (“Joint Statement”) (attached hereto as Exhibit A).
The Joint Statement provided that “[a]ll amendments and/or supplements to the pleadings shall
be filed on or before . . . April 28, 2006, without prejudice to the right of any party to move for
1

The defendants are the City of Boston, the Boston Police Department (“BPD”), and Edward
Davis, Commissioner of the Boston Police Department (collectively referred to herein as “Defendants.”).

leave to amend or supplement the pleadings as necessary in light of discovery or to conform with
the evidence or a change in the law.”

Joint Statement, p.3, ¶ 4. The Joint Statement also

provided that “[t]he parties share an interest in litigating this case as efficiently as possible.” Id.
at p. 1, ¶ II.
The parties filed a Joint Statement With a Revised, Proposed Discovery Schedule on
January 18, 2007, and a Joint Motion to Amend Scheduling Order on May 31, 2007. On June 5,
2007, this Court approved the parties’ proposed amendments to the Scheduling Order. Notably,
Defendants never requested any amendments to the April 28, 2006 deadline for amending or
supplementing pleadings, and no such amendments were ever made. On October 12, 2007,
more than two years after Plaintiffs filed this action, approximately one and one half years after
the deadline for amending or supplementing pleadings, and after the close of Stage I fact
discovery, Defendants filed their motion to add Psychemedics as a third-party defendant.
ARGUMENT
A.

Defendants’ Motion Should Be Denied Because Adding Psychemedics as a ThirdParty Defendant at this Late Stage in the Proceedings Will Unduly Delay The
Proceedings and Prejudice the Plaintiffs
1.

Adding Pscychemdics as a Third-Party Defendant Will Unduly Delay
The Proceedings

Some of the Plaintiffs suffered adverse employment consequences as a result of the Hair
Test five years ago.2 Because of Defendants’ adverse employment actions relating to the flawed
Hair Test, Plaintiffs lost their jobs, livelihoods, and reputations. Plaintiffs continue to endure the
emotional stress caused by Defendants’ actions, and prolonging this litigation will only result in
more harm to Plaintiffs.

2

The Defendants took adverse employment actions against the Plaintiffs during the period of
2002-2004.

The Defendants could have brought a motion to add Psychemedics as a third-party
defendant when the Plaintiffs filed their complaint. Clearly, there was no mystery that had to be
solved as to the identity of the entity that performs the Hair Test.

That the entity is

Psychemedics is plain from the face of the 2005 complaint -- and indeed, from the face of the
1998 contract between the City of Boston and Psychemedics. The only mystery is why the
Defendants chose to wait for over two years after the case was filed, and very close to the end of
Stage I fact discovery, to file the motion -- a mystery that Defendants do not even attempt to
explain. Whatever the reason for Defendants’ delay (and whatever the propriety of adding
Psychemedics as a defendant might have been two years ago or one year ago), it is altogether
inexcusable. Defendants’ Motion should be denied because the addition of Psychemedics as a
defendant in this case can only result in yet more delay and expense to a group of individuals
who simply cannot bear the burden.
Although courts have permitted defendants to file third-party complaints where the delay
was caused by newly emerging evidence, see e.g., Charlotte Motor Speedway, Inc. v.
International Ins. Co., 125 F.R.D. 127, 131-32 (M.D.N.C. 1989), courts have denied such
delayed filings where the defendants had reason to know the identities of possible third-party
Defendants, but failed to act within the deadline. See Hogan v. Janos Indus. Insulation Corp.,
102 F.R.D. 205, 206-07 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (denying third-party complaint where defendants had
reason to know of potential liability of third-party manufacturers after plaintiffs responded to
interrogatories but waited until after the six months required by the applicable local rule to join
additional parties). See also Local Rule D. Mass. 15.1(A) (emphasis added) (“Amendments
adding parties shall be sought as soon as an attorney reasonably can be expected to have become
aware of the identity of the proposed the new party.”).

The Defendants claim that the Court’s allowance of their third party complaint will not
cause any delay because “expert discovery is held in abeyance with the Court’s permission
pending the resolution of the outstanding motions to compel.” Memorandum in Support of
Defendants’ Motion at 5. This seems highly unlikely given that Plaintiffs and Defendants have
obtained leave to extend the discovery schedule several times in order to accommodate their
discovery needs and Psychemedics has already suggested that it would need to re-open the nowclosed Stage I discovery. See Psychemedics Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion
at p. 4.
It is well established that this Court has discretion to grant or deny Defendants’ belated
attempt to add a third-party defendant. See Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio, 166 F.3d 389, 393
(1st Cir. 1999) (emphasis added) (“[T]he determination is left to the informed discretion of the
district court, which should allow impleader on any colorable claim of derivative liability that
will not unduly delay or otherwise prejudice the ongoing proceedings.”). Here, because adding
Psychemedics as a third-party defendant at this late stage would unduly delay the proceedings,
Defendants’ Motion should be denied.
2.

Adding Psychemedics as a Third-Party Defendant Will Prejudice the
Plaintiffs

Adding Psychemedics as a third-party defendant at this late stage will greatly prejudice
the Plaintiffs, whose livelihoods and reputations have been at stake since they were wrongfully
discharged by the Defendants or denied employment more than three years ago. As the parties
agreed, this case should be litigated as efficiently as possible and Plaintiffs, if successful, should
be compensated for Defendants’ unlawful employment decisions. Adding Psychemedics will
also undoubtedly complicate this case and place an unacceptable burden on the Plaintiffs.
Indeed, Psychemedics refused to comply with Plaintiffs’ Rule 45 subpoenas and refused to
produce a single document, causing Plaintiffs to file motions to compel Psychemedics to produce

these documents. If Psychemedics continues with such stonewalling tactics as a third-party
defendant, Plaintiffs will be severely prejudiced.

Moreover, there is no doubt that

Psychemedics’ addition as a third-party defendant will cause Plaintiffs to expend additional
resources to counter Psychemedics’ stated desire to take depositions. Plaintiffs will also be
forced to spend additional resources responding to discovery requests and motions filed by
Psychemedics.
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny
Defendant City of Boston’s Motion For Leave to File Third Party Complaint Against
Psychemedics Corporation. In the alternative, if this Court grants Defendants’ Motion, Plaintiffs
request that the Court order that Psychemedics not be allowed to re-open any discovery or
otherwise cause additional delay or expense to Plaintiffs.
