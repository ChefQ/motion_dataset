CIVIL ACTION NO. 05-11832-GAO

PSYCHEMEDICS CORPORATION’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT CITY OF BOSTON’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE THIRD PARTY
COMPLAINT AGAINST PSYCHEMICS CORPORATION
NOW COMES Psychemedics Corporation, and hereby opposes the City of
Boston’s Motion For Leave To File Third Party Complaint against Psychemedics
Corporation (“City’s Motion”).
I.

BACKGROUND
This is a civil rights action involving claims that a certain drug testing procedure

administered to Boston police officers by the defendants produces results based on the
race of the subject. Such drug testing is performed pursuant to a contract between the
City of Boston and Psychemedics Corporation (“Psychemedics”), a biotechnology
company that has developed a patented hair testing technology for drugs of abuse.
The action was initially filed in Suffolk Superior Court on July 26, 2005, with a
track requiring disposition by September 17, 2006 (Exhibit A hereto). The City of Boston
removed it to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on
September 9, 2005. The parties filed a Joint Statement Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.26(f)
and Local Rule 16.1 on February 3, 2006, Exhibit B hereto, in which all parties agreed

that Amendments and/or supplements to the pleadings were required to be filed by April
28, 2006 1. No further amendment to such deadline has been proposed or ordered.
Pursuant to the various stipulations, joint statements and Orders of Court
reflected in the docket, it appears that discovery including depositions has been ongoing
and that all Stage 1 discovery was supposed to have been completed by August 3,
2007, subject to various motions to compel. Psychemedics, not having been a party to
the proceedings, is unaware of the nature and extent of the discovery that has already
occurred except insofar as the discovery sought from it.2
On October 12, 2007, the City of Boston filed its Motion for Leave to file a Third
Party Complaint sounding in indemnification and contribution.
II.

ARGUMENT
Psychemedics hereby opposes the City’s Motion on the grounds that the

deadline for amending has passed, the City has not met its burden of showing why it
should be allowed to bring Psychemedics in as a third party defendant at this late date,
and, counter to the City’s argument, Psychemedics contends that allowing the Motion
will not serve the purposes of judicial economy, and will cause prejudice and delay.
A.

The City’s Motion Should be Denied Because It is Seeking to Add
Psychemedics after the Deadline and It Has Not Set Forth Any
Proper Justification for the Delay.

As set forth above, the City, in submitting the Joint Statement to the Court on
February 3, 2006, agreed to be bound by the April 28, 2006 deadline for filing new
pleadings and bringing in additional parties. Although courts have discretion to permit a

1

Although the Plaintiffs suggested that the April 28, 2006 deadline be without prejudice
to the right of any party to move for leave to amend or supplement the pleadings as necessary in
light of discovery to conform with the evidence or a change in the law, the Defendants’ version
was absolute.
2
On November 3, 2006, the plaintiffs served Psychemedics with a depositon subpoena
requesting Psychemedics to produce various documents. Psychemedics has objected to
producing some of the items, and a motion to compel is pending.

party to bring in a third party after such deadline imposed by Local Rule, such discretion
is generally exercised only if the defendant was not dilatory or derelict, and no prejudice
will result. Gilpin v. Abraham, 231 F.Supp. 511 (E.D. Pa. 1964). Moreover, the
defendant has the burden of justifying late application for leave to join a third party
defendant. Goodman v. Neff, 251 F.Supp. 562 (E.D. Pa. 1966). Mere inadvertence or
carelessness is not a sufficient basis to excuse a delay. Saunders v. Jim Emes
Petroleum Co., Inc., 101 F.R.D. 405 (W.D. Pa. 1983). Rather, defendant must offer a
valid excuse for the delay. Blais Const. Co., Inc. v. Hanover Square Associates-I, 733
F.Supp. 149 (N.D. N.Y. 1990). While courts have permitted defendants to file late third
party complaints where the late filing was occasioned by newly emerging evidence
during discovery, see,e.g., Charlotte Motor Speedway, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., 125
F.R.D. 127 (M.D. N.C. 1989), courts have denied late filing where the defendants had
reason to know the identities of possible third party defendants, but failed to act within
the deadline. Hogan v. Janos Indus. Insulation Corp., 102 F.R.D. 205 (S.D. N.Y. 1984).
Similarly, courts have also denied requests for late filing of third party complaints where
the Defendant has failed to assert any reason for the delay. Lovallo v. Pittsburgh
Corning Corp., 99 F.R.D. 627 (E.D. Pa.1983).
The City in the present case has offered no reason for its delay in attempting to
bring this third party action. Indeed, the City cannot claim that it did not know of
Psychemedics’ existence until recently as it is relying on a contract entered into with
Psychemedics in 1998. Furthermore, Psychemedics was specifically brought into this
case for discovery purposes by subpoena served on it nearly a year ago. Surely, the
City cannot claim that it had no knowledge that Psychemedics could be brought in as a
party until now.
Inasmuch as the City is seeking to bring in a third party defendant approximately
18 months after the deadline for amending the pleadings, and it has offered no

Case 1:05-cv-11832-GAO

Document 78

Filed 10/22/2007

Page 4 of 5

justification for the delay, the Motion For Leave To File a Third Party Complaint should
be denied.
B.

The City’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Interests of
Judicial Economy are Not Served, and Psychemedics Will Be
Prejudiced By Adding It At This Late Date.

Contrary to the City’s contention, the interests of judicial economy would not be
served by adding Psychemedics as a third party defendant in an action for
indemnification and contribution. By adding this state claim as pendant to the federal
jurisdiction, the City is seeking to add new issues of contract interpretation, and the
assignment of responsibility between the City and Psychemedics for the testing
procedure taken. There may be other parties which Psychemedics may now wish to
implead. These types of indemnification actions are routinely brought if and only if a
defendant is found liable. If the City prevails in the underlying action, there would be no
need to bring Psychemedics in at all, and no need to try these additional issues. Thus
permitting Psychemedics to be added as a party may unduly delay this proceeding and
cause more litigation than denying the motion.
Furthermore, according to the docket, “stage 1 discovery” but for the scientific
discovery has apparently been completed, albeit without Psychemedics’ participation.
Psychemedics would be prejudiced by its not having been a party to such discovery; and
presumably would be entitled to retake depositions already taken. Furthermore,
discovery deadlines have passed, and various stipulations have been entered by the
parties without Psychemedics’ participation. Psychemedics would be prejudiced if such
deadlines were applied to it.
Psychemedics submits, as set forth above, that it will be prejudiced by permitting
the City to file a third party complaint at this late date in the proceedings, and the
interests of judicial economy will not be served by including in this action a traditional
state court claim for indemnification and contribution.

CONCLUSION
Inasmuch as the City has failed to meet its burden of showing a justification for

the delay in bringing this third party action, and that the interests of judicial economy will
be served by joining in Psychemedics, and Psychemedics will be prejudiced by being
brought into the proceedings at this late date, the City’s Motion for Leave To File Third
Party Complaint should be denied.
