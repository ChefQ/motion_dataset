1

Defendant THQ Inc. ("THQ") hereby moves for summary judgment or, in the

2 alternative, partial summary judgment on each claim for relief. This motion is based on
3 the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that THQ is therefore
4 entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
5

THQ is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's First Claim for Relief,

6 for infringement of a registered mark because THQ makes no use of Plaintiff's registered
7 marks, let alone any trademark use. THQ is also entitled to judgment as a matter of law
8 on Plaintiff's Second Claim for Relief, for false designation of origin, because Plaintiff
9 can neither establish a valid, protectable right in any of its alleged unregistered marks,
10 nor any infringing use by THQ. Plaintiff's Third Claim for Relief, for infringement of a
11 common law trademark under Arizona state law, requires the same elements as Plaintiff's
12 Lanham Act claims and therefore fails for these same reasons.
13

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

14 I.

INTRODUCTION

15

Plaintiff Ultimate Creations, Inc. ("Plaintiff") – a company owned by Warrior,1 an

16 individual who once wrestled professionally under the name "Ultimate Warrior" – filed
17 this action lobbing myriad, amorphous allegations of trademark infringement against
18 Defendant THQ Inc.'s ("THQ") video games without ever actually reviewing the
19 allegedly infringing games. A review of these video games by Warrior and his counsel
20 against a background of basic trademark law principles would have revealed that there is
21 absolutely no basis for this lawsuit.
22

As discussed more fully below, each of Plaintiff's three claims for relief can be

23 resolved as a matter of law. First, although Plaintiff claims infringement of all of its
24 registered trademarks, Plaintiff has no evidence that THQ has used these marks, let alone
25 used any of them as a trademark. Plaintiff can only point to the appearance of the word
26 "warrior" in some of THQ's games. Yet, including this word as a generic description of
27

28

Warrior was born James Hellwig but legally changed his name to Warrior.

1 any wrestler in the game does not infringe Plaintiff's rights in its "WARRIOR" mark and
2 is, in any event, squarely protected by the First Amendment.
3

Neither can Plaintiff succeed on its false designation of origin claim, by which it

4 claims infringement of alleged unregistered marks – the "likeness" or "character" of the
5 Ultimate Warrior and the Ultimate Warrior's "signature moves." Plaintiff cannot
6 establish any protectable right in these alleged marks and, like its claim with respect to its
7 registered marks, there is no evidence that THQ has made any infringing use. Plaintiff's
8 third claim for relief, infringement of a common law trademark under Arizona common
9 law, fails for these same reasons.
10

Thus, THQ's motion for summary judgment should be granted.

1 strategy. SOF ¶ 8. The company's portfolio of highly successful video games include
2 games based on Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and Cars; Nickelodeon's
3 SpongeBob SquarePants; and Power Rangers, as well as original titles. SOF ¶ 9. The
4 video games at issue here are the wrestling-related games that THQ releases pursuant to
5 its license with WWE (the "WWE games").3 SOF ¶ 10. WWE promotes live and
6 televised professional wrestling events featuring its professional wrestlers ("WWE
7 Superstars").

THQ's WWE games showcase the current WWE Superstars, whom the game

9 player can control in the ring in a quest to win the championship belt. 4 SOF ¶ 11. THQ
10 markets these games to WWE fans as a virtual opportunity to play in the WWE by
11 participating in the events and stories that WWE fans follow during the wrestling season.
12 SOF ¶ 12. To this end, THQ's WWE games are updated and released annually to contain
13 the most up-to-date roster of WWE Superstars, WWE images (such as the most recent
14 designs of WWE arenas and WWE Superstar costumes), and storylines. SOF ¶ 13.
15 Consumers buy annual games to ensure they have the most current characteristics of the

WWE Superstars In THQ's Games

Each of THQ's WWE video games features an extensive roster of WWE

20 Superstars. SOF ¶¶ 45, 48. To play the game, the game purchaser selects one of these
21 characters and then controls that character in either a single match or in several matches

Per the Court's direction, THQ is not submitting copies of the video games with

but will make available upon request games referenced in the Complaint,
26
as well as any other WWE game at issue (all of which were produced in discovery) along
27 with game consoles required for review. SOF ¶ 17. The WWE games are also described
28 in detail in Ms. Vrabeck's expert report. SOF ¶ 18.

Create-A-Wrestler Feature

As an extra feature, THQ's WWE games also include technology, similar to a

8 computer animation program, that allows a game player to create his or her own original
9 and unique wrestler and then play the game using that user-created wrestler (the "Create10 A-Wrestler Feature"). SOF ¶¶ 54, 58. To create an original wrestler with this feature,
11 the player starts with a generic human body form and then alters the body in potentially
12 hundreds, even thousands, of ways – e.g., changing the form's length of arms and legs,
13 shoulder breadth, skin color, head shape, jaw width, bicep size, neck width, hair length
14 and color, facial and body hair, etc. SOF ¶¶ 55, 58. The player can then choose from
15 thousands of generic clothing pieces, symbols, masks, tattoos, and accessories; customize
16 them (such as by altering these generic items in color, size, and orientation); and then
17 apply them to a created wrestler. SOF ¶¶ 56, 58. The possibilities for what a player can
18 create with this feature are literally infinite.5
19

Once the game player finalizes the appearance of his created wrestler, he can type

20 in a name for that character, select the wrestler's hometown, assign it the wrestling moves
21 it will use in entering the ring or in fighting opponents, give it strength attributes, and
22 pick music. SOF ¶ 57. The player can also give the created wrestler a "call name" – a
23 name that the game's announcing voice will call out when that wrestler walks into the
24 virtual arena – by choosing from a list of generic call names. SOF ¶¶ 29, 31. There is no

5

To demonstrate the limitless capabilities of this feature, THQ has included at
Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Cory Ledesma a DVD that shows how a player uses the
27 Create-a-Wrestler Feature to build an original wrestler. SOF ¶ 58. In this example, the
28 player creates a wrestler who looks like Superman.

1 call name "Ultimate Warrior" (or any other real-life wrestler), rather the possible call
2 names are generic names for wrestlers or fighters. SOF ¶¶ 30, 33-35. In two of THQ's
3 WWE games – SmackDown! vs. Raw and WrestleMania 21 – the game player can choose
4 a call name from a list of almost fifty possibilities, one possibility of which is "The
5 Warrior" or "Warrior." SOF ¶¶ 32-35. Other call names include "The Brawler," "The
6 Bruiser," "The Cheater," "The Criminal," "The Immortal," "The Legend," "The
7 Machine," "The Player," "The Professional," "The Samurai," "The Superstar," "The
8 Hero," "The Villain," and many others. Id. The full list of available call names in
9 SmackDown! vs. Raw, for example, is as follows:

THQ takes no action to limit the infinite possibilities for the Create-A-Wrestler

21 Feature. THQ does not provide purchasers with any instructions, or otherwise prompt, on
22 how to create specific characters in its games. SOF ¶¶ 59, 62. There does exist a small
23 group of very experienced video game players who spend hours experimenting with the
24 Create-A-Wrestler Feature to create wrestlers who look like real people – such as a sports
25 stars, pop singers, political figures, or actors. SOF ¶ 60. These players will sometimes
26 display on third-party internet sites images or videos of their interpretations of real people
27 or fictional characters as created wrestlers, along with the incredibly elaborate, multi-step

1 specifications required to replicate such created wrestlers. SOF ¶ 61. These
2 specifications list the codes that the player must enter into the game and the options the
3 player must choose. SOF ¶ 40. Yet, it is the game players, not THQ, who post such
4 information. SOF ¶¶ 61-62.
5

The objective of the WWE games is to allow purchasers to play with current

6 WWE Superstars in a virtual WWE experience. SOF ¶ 63. This is why the roster of
7 available WWE Superstars for the player to choose from is so large, realistic, and current.
8 The Create-A-Wrestler Feature is simply an extra or "add-on component" of these games.
9 A player can play (and, indeed, even win) each game without ever even entering the
10 Create-A-Wrestler section of these games. SOF ¶ 64.

Wrestling Moves Available For Game Play

In each of THQ's WWE games, there are hundreds of possible moves – indeed

13 upwards of 500 – that a game player can apply to either a WWE Superstar or a character
14 the player creates through the Create-A-Wrestler Feature and use when playing the game.
15 SOF ¶ 70. These available moves include wrestler ring entrances, fighting moves, moves
16 to finish a match (or "finishing moves"), and various other in-ring behaviors. SOF ¶ 71.

23 merely "pointing out to the district court . . . that there is an absence of evidence to
24 support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).
25 The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to set forth "specific facts showing that
26 there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250
27 (1986). Evidence presented in opposition must be admissible; the non-moving party may
28 not simply rest on the allegations of its complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). "Instead, the

Plaintiff's Claim For Infringement Of Federally Registered
Trademarks Fails As A Matter Of Law

Plaintiff cannot prevail on a Lanham Act claim – whether a claim brought under

6 Section 32, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) (infringement of a registered mark) or under Section
7 43(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (false designation of origin) – unless it proves that it owns a
8 valid mark and that THQ is using the same or a similar mark in commerce in connection
9 with the sale of goods or services in a manner that is likely to cause confusion. See
10 Brookfield Commc'ns, Inc. v. West Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1046 & n.6 (9th
11 Cir. 1999).
12

In typical trademark cases, the court considers whether a likelihood of confusion

13 exists using the eight-factor test originally set forth in AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599
14 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979). Surfvivor Media, Inc. v. Survivor Prods., 406 F.3d 625,
15 631 (9th Cir. 2005). Yet, where, as here, a defendant has not used the alleged mark in
16 connection with the sale of goods or services, "the Court need not apply the test for
17 likelihood of confusion." 6 Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., 985 F.
18 Supp. 949, 958 (C.D. Cal. 1997), aff'd, 194 F.3d 980 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Interactive
19 Prods. Corp. v. a2z Mobile Office Solutions, Inc., 326 F.3d 687, 698 (6th Cir. 2003)
20 (where no evidence of trademark use, unnecessary to examine test "traditionally used to
21 determine likelihood of confusion between two source-signifying marks"); 4 J. Thomas
22 McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 23:11.50, p. 23-75
23 (without use as a trademark, any confusion is "highly unlikely").
24
25

6

In any event, the absence of any actual confusion evidence, despite the fact that
THQ
has
successfully sold the games cited in the Complaint since 2003, SOF ¶¶ 15-16, is
26
a "powerful indication" that confusion is not likely. Cohn v. Petsmart, Inc., 281 F.3d
27 837, 843 (9th Cir. 2002). Nor is there any survey, or other, evidence showing any
28 likelihood of confusion. Plaintiff cannot remedy this fatal absence of evidence at trial.

Moreover, if a "defendant[ ] [is] only using [plaintiff's] trademark in a 'non-

2 trademark' way – that is, in a way that does not identify the source of a product – then
3 trademark infringement and false designation of origin laws do not apply." Interactive
4 Prods., 326 F.3d at 695; cf. New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc., 971
5 F.2d 302, 307 (9th Cir. 1992) (infringement laws "simply do not apply" to "non6 trademark use of a mark").
7

Even assuming Plaintiff's registered marks – the word marks "ULTIMATE

8 WARRIOR," "GENERATION WARRIOR," and "WARRIOR" and the design mark –
9 are valid trademarks, Plaintiff's claim of infringement of these marks cannot survive
10 summary judgment because there is no evidence that THQ has made a trademark use of
11 them, if even THQ made any use at all (which it has not).
1.

12
13
14

THQ Does Not Use "ULTIMATE WARRIOR" Or
"GENERATION WARRIOR" Marks

It is Plaintiff's burden to come forward with evidence that THQ has used its

15 alleged marks. Plaintiff has not done so and indeed cannot. THQ makes no use at all of
16 Plaintiff's alleged "ULTIMATE WARRIOR" and "GENERATION WARRIOR" marks
17 in its WWE games, let alone any use that is likely to cause consumer confusion. Not one
18 of these games includes a character named the "Ultimate Warrior" or "Generation
19 Warrior," or include the words "Ultimate Warrior" or "Generation Warrior" in any other
20 manner. SOF ¶¶ 19-20. Plaintiff has presented no evidence to the contrary. Indeed,
21 when questioned during his deposition regarding existence of these alleged marks in
22 THQ's games, Warrior could point to no place where they appeared. SOF ¶¶ 21-22.
23

THQ likewise does not reference the "Ultimate Warrior" or "Generation Warrior"

24 in any of its game packaging materials or in any television or print advertisement for
25 these games. SOF ¶¶ 23-24. Indeed, THQ's advertisements rely almost entirely on
26 images and footage of current WWE events and WWE Superstars, consistent with its
27
28
-81658150

1 marketing message that promotes playing the real-world experience of the WWE.7 SOF
2 ¶ 25.
3

Thus, without evidence of any use by THQ that could implicate the protections of

4 the Lanham Act, Plaintiff's infringement claim with respect to these registered marks fails
5 as a matter of law.
2.

6
7

"Warrior" Call-Name Does Not Infringe "WARRIOR" Mark

There is no character in any THQ WWE game called "Warrior," nor is there any

8 evidence that THQ uses "Warrior" in any of its advertising, marketing, or game
9 packaging materials for these games. SOF ¶¶ 26-27. Plaintiff nevertheless claims that
10 THQ infringes its alleged "WARRIOR" mark because after a purchaser creates a
11 wrestler, it can give it the call name "The Warrior" or "Warrior." SOF ¶ 28. Yet, as
12 explained below, Plaintiff's registration of the word mark "WARRIOR" does not give
13 Plaintiff the right to prevent THQ from using the word "warrior" in its list of generic call
14 name possibilities any more than to prevent the use of "brawler," "bruiser," "cheater," or
15 other fighter-description words. To grant Plaintiff the exclusive, monopolistic right it
16 claims over the word "warrior" would far exceed the Lanham Act's protections and
17 infringe First Amendment rights.

In its opposition, Plaintiff may point to a preliminary marketing document for
The Day of Reckoning 2 that erroneously listed the Ultimate Warrior among those
wrestlers who would appear in the game. THQ retracted this document as soon as it
realized the error. Yet, there is no need for the Court to even consider this because, as a
matter of law, this preliminary document, issued almost five months prior to the
distribution of this game cannot constitute a "use in commerce" pursuant to the Lanham
Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (defining "use in commerce" as occurring when the subject mark
is "placed in any manner on the goods . . . and . . . the goods are sold or transported in
commerce"); see also In re Port Authority of New York, 3 U.S.P.Q.2d 1453, 1455
(T.T.A.B. 1987) ("use of a mark in connection with advertising, promotion and
preparatory activities for services to be available at some time in the future" does not
present use in commerce).

Plaintiff Cannot Prevent THQ's Use Of The Word "Warrior"

The registration of "warrior" as a trademark does not grant Plaintiff an exclusive

3 right to all future uses of that word but only to the secondary meaning associated with
4 Plaintiff's goods or services. KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.,
5 543 U.S. 111, 122 (2004); New Kids, 971 F.2d at 306 ("A trademark is a limited property
6 right in a particular word, phrase, or symbol." (emphasis added)). Indeed, a defendant
7 may use a term that is another's trademark to "describe" his own goods or services under
8 the doctrine of fair use. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4); see also New Kids, 971 F.2d at 306.
9 This principle "protects the right of society at large to use words or images in their
10 primary descriptive sense, as against the claims of a trademark owner to exclusivity."
11 Car-Freshner Corp. v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., 70 F.3d 267, 269 (2d Cir. 1995). Yet,
12 although fair use cases are instructive here, THQ's use of the word "warrior" does not
13 even rise close to the level permitted under that doctrine. THQ does not use "warrior" to
14 describe or identify its goods or services. Rather, the word "warrior" appears only in its
15 ordinary, English-language meaning deep within THQ's product as one possible variable
16 a player can choose when creating his own character. Such use does not even implicate
17 the Lanham Act's protections.
18

In any event, no reasonable argument can be made that the existence of "warrior"

19 among the fifty or so other generic call name options could cause confusion as to the
20 source of THQ's games, or any association between Plaintiff and the games. Nothing in
21 THQ's games suggests that the "warrior" call name option was intended to be used with
22 any particular created character, let alone a character who resembles the Ultimate
23 Warrior. A game purchaser (unprompted and unaided by THQ) can choose to apply the
24 "warrior" call name to any character he creates – e.g., an Apache Warrior, a soldier in
25 uniform, a player on the Golden State Warriors basketball team, a Roman gladiator, or
26 even the player himself. The fact that a purchaser who wants to play the game with a

1 wrestler who resembles the Ultimate Warrior must create that wrestler independently and
2 then assign it the call name "warrior" suggests, if anything, no possibility of confusion.

THQ's Use Is Protected By The First Amendment

Even if the "warrior" call name possibility in THQ games could be deemed to

5 implicate the Lanham Act's protections, THQ's use of the word "warrior" is certainly
6 protected by the First Amendment. It is well-established in the courts in this Circuit that
7 video games, such as THQ's WWE games, are expressive works protected by the First
8 Amendment. See, e.g., E.S.S. Entm't 2000, Inc. v. Rock Star Videos, Inc., 444 F. Supp. 2d
9 1012, 1039 (C.D. Cal. 2006); Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Schwarzenegger, 401 F.
10 Supp. 2d 1034, 1044 (N.D. Cal. 2005); Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Maleng, 325
11 F.Supp.2d 1180, 1184-85 (W.D. Wash. 2004); see also Interactive Digital Software Ass'n
12 v. St. Louis County, 329 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. 2003) ("pictures, graphic design, concept
13 art, sounds, music, stories, and narrative present in video games" entitle them to First
14 Amendment protection). Because THQ uses "warrior" in an expressive work only as a
15 "part of a communicative message and not a source identifier, the First Amendment is
16 implicated in opposition to the [Plaintiff's] trademark right." E.S.S. Entm't 2000, 444 F.
17 Supp. 2d at 1039.
18

The First Amendment protects a defendant's use of trademark if that use (1)

19 "'surpasses the minimum threshold of artistic relevance to the [work's] content,'" and (2)
20 does not explicitly mislead as to the source or content of the work. Id. at 1040, 1044
21 (quoting Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994, 999 (2d Cir. 1989)); Mattel, Inc. v. MCA
22 Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894, 902 (9th Cir. 2002). This test is easily met here.
23

First, the word "warrior" is decidedly relevant to the work's content as this section

24 of the game assigns an identifying attribute to created wrestlers. The use of the word
25 "warrior" describes not the Ultimate Warrior but any person "engaged or experienced in
26 warfare . . . [or] a person of demonstrated courage, fortitude, zeal, or pugnacity."

1 Webster's New International Dictionary 2578 (3d ed. 1986). Just as the other unbranded
2 terms are fitting to announce a fighter or wrestler, so too is the word "warrior."
3

Second, THQ's use of the word "warrior" does not mislead consumers as to the

4 source or content of THQ's games where "warrior" does not appear on any of THQ's
5 game packaging or in any of its advertisements. See E.S.S. Entertainment 2000, Inc., 444
6 F. Supp. 2d at 1044 (video game element not used in packaging or advertising but only
7 visible after consumers purchase and play game, if at all, does not mislead). Consumers
8 see the word "warrior" after they have purchased the game, if at all (for it is possible to
9 play, even win, the game without ever entering the Create-A-Wrestler feature), and only
10 then in conjunction with fifty or so other unbranded terms.
11

Thus, because THQ's use does not implicate the protections of the Lanham Act

12 and, in any event, is protected by the First Amendment, Plaintiff's claim of infringement
13 with respect to the "WARRIOR" mark also fails as a matter of law.

THQ Does Not Use The Design Mark Or Any Confusingly
Similar Mark

Plaintiff claims that a game player "can create the Ultimate Warrior character

16

17 including using . . . the Ultimate Warrior logo," its registered design mark. SOF ¶¶ 3618 38. Yet, the very evidence Plaintiff has produced undermines any claim that THQ has
19 used this design mark, or any confusingly similar symbol, in any way in its games – let
20 alone made any use of the mark as a trademark in connection with the sale of goods or
21 services.
Plaintiff has not identified (and indeed cannot) the appearance of its mark in any

22

23 of THQ's games or in any materials advertising or marketing such games. SOF ¶¶ 39, 67.
24 Rather, Plaintiff's own evidence proves that purchasers who want a symbol that to them
25 resembles Ultimate Warrior's logo to appear in the game create it themselves. For
26 example, Plaintiff produced instructions posted on an internet site by video game player
27 "Slavetothemedia" who used the Create-A-Wrestler Feature to build a wrestler he
28 believed resembled the Ultimate Warrior in SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain. SOF

10 SOF ¶¶ 40-41. Placing face paint on the created wrestler – which Plaintiff also claims
11 replicates its design mark – requires similar multi-step instructions. SOF ¶ 40 (steps 8
12 though 10). Thus, the only way a symbol that even arguably resembles Plaintiff's mark
13 can appear in THQ's games is if someone with a keen interest in making it appear creates
14 it. This cannot support a claim of infringement against THQ.
15

Neither can the existence of a generic symbol in the game that is manipulated to

16 create something a player believes resembles the logo support this infringement claim.
17 The manipulated symbol, symbol number 25, appears as one of 150 or more generic
18 symbols available in the game to customize and decorate created characters. SOF ¶¶ 41,
19 43-44. THQ does not use the symbol as a trademark in connection with the sale of goods
20 or services. Further, the generic symbol that is manipulated:
21
22
23 is not similar to Plaintiff's registered design mark:

SOF ¶¶ 37, 42, 44. There is nothing about the generic symbol in the game that would

Plaintiff's False Designation Of Origin Claim Also Fails

Plaintiff also asserts a claim under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.
§ 1125(a), seeking to protect marks not the subject of federal registrations – the Ultimate
Warrior "character" or "likeness" and the "signature move sets" associated with that
character – from infringing use. This claim fails for two distinct reasons. First, Plaintiff
cannot pass the threshold validity requirement because Plaintiff cannot articulate any
protectable trademark or trade dress interest in the "character," "likeness," or "moves"
that would prevent THQ from using them. Second, like its claim with respect to the
registered marks, Plaintiff's claim fails because there is no evidence that THQ has made
any infringing use of these alleged marks.

Plaintiff's Claim Based On THQ's Alleged Use Of The Ultimate
Warrior "Character" Or "Likeness" Fails As A Matter Of Law

16

(a)

17

Plaintiff Does Not Own A Valid, Protectable Trademark Or
Trade Dress Right In The Ultimate Warrior "Character" Or
"Likeness"

Plaintiff cannot succeed on a section 43(a) claim with respect to the Ultimate

18

19 Warrior "character" or "likeness" because Plaintiff cannot show that such "character" or
20 "likeness" is even a valid trademark or trade dress right.
First, Plaintiff has failed even to identify the image of the character in which it

21

22 claims trademark or trade dress rights, asserting only that "[t]he Ultimate Warrior became
23 a well-known character." SOF ¶ 50. Indeed, Warrior himself testified during his
24 deposition that the Ultimate Warrior character "change[d] or evolve[d] over time,"
25 "throughout [his] whole career," and that the Ultimate Warrior character "had a bunch of
26 different colors and outfits to choose from." SOF ¶¶ 51, 52. Such a "vaguely defined
27 character lacking a specific image . . . is unable as a matter of law to 'achieve that fixture
28 or consistency of representation that would seem necessary to constitute a symbol in the

2 Inc. v. Nintendo Co., 578 F. Supp. 911, 924 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd, 746 F.2d 112 (2d Cir.
3 1984). Plaintiff's failure to define the scope of the Ultimate Warrior character is fatal to
4 its claim of trademark rights. See, e.g., Sony Pictures Entm't, Inc. v. Fireworks Entm't
5 Group, Inc., 156 F. Supp. 2d 1148, 1162-63 (C.D. Cal. 2001), vacated pursuant to
6 settlement, 2002 WL 32387901 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2002) (granting summary judgment on
7 § 43(a) claim where plaintiff could not identify mark for character "Zorro").8
8

Similarly, although Plaintiff peppered its complaint with allegations of a protected

9 "trade dress" associated with the Ultimate Warrior character, Plaintiff has not articulated
10 what elements make up its claimed trade dress and thus cannot establish a valid trade
11 dress right. Yurman Design, Inc. v. PAJ, Inc., 262 F.3d 101, 118 (2d Cir. 2001)
12 (judgment as matter of law appropriate where Plaintiff fails to identify specific elements
13 of trade dress); see also Big Island Candies, Inc. v. Cookie Corner, 269 F. Supp. 2d 1236,
14 1246 (D. Haw. 2003) (without articulation of elements, "it would be impossible for the
15 court to evaluate secondary meaning, genericness, or nonfunctionality, and it would be
16 impossible for the court to shape narrowly tailored relief"). Having had ample
17 opportunity to articulate the elements of its alleged trade dress, it is simply too late for
18 Plaintiff to remedy this failure. Walker & Zanger, Inc. v. Paragon Indus., Inc., 465 F.
19 Supp. 2d 956, 964 (N.D. Cal. 2006).9
20

Second, any claim of trademark or trade dress rights in the Ultimate Warrior

21 "character" or "likeness" – no matter how identified or defined – fails because Plaintiff
22

8

Evidence that WWE retains some rights in the Ultimate Warrior character –
23 whatever such rights are – also undermines any claim that the public identifies a single
24 source for Ultimate Warrior-related products. SOF ¶ 68. See, e.g., Universal City, 578 F.
Supp. at 924-25 (concluding no valid trademark in King Kong character where numerous
25 entities owned copyrights).
9

Additionally, "[t]rademark or trade dress protection extends only to product
features that are nonfunctional." Disc Golf Ass'n v. Champion Discs, Inc., 158 F.3d 1002,
27 1006 (9th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff cannot satisfy its burden of proving its asserted trade dress
28 is nonfunctional.

1 has not used such character or likeness to identify the source of its goods or services. A
2 "trademark" protected under section 43(a) is "any word, name, symbol, or device, or any
3 combination thereof . . . used by a person . . . to identify and distinguish his or her goods
4 . . . from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods."
5 15 U.S.C. § 1127. The purpose of trademarks has always been "[i]dentification of the
6 manufacturer or sponsor of a good or the provider of a service." New Kids, 971 F.2d at
7 305. "[T]o create trademark or trade dress rights, a designation must be proven to
8 perform the job of identification: to identify one source and distinguish it from other
9 sources. If it does not do this, then it is not protectable as a trademark, service mark,
10 trade dress or any similar exclusive right." 1 McCarthy, supra, at § 3:3, p. 3-6. Because
11 the Ultimate Warrior character (whatever its contours may be) does not function to
12 distinguish anything other than the image or character itself, the Lanham Act provides no
13 protection. Scholastic Inc. v. Speirs, 28 F. Supp. 2d 862, 870-71 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)

THQ Has Made No Use Of The Alleged "Character" Or
"Likeness"

Plaintiff's allegation that the fact that "one playing the game can create the

19

20 Ultimate Warrior character" somehow constitutes infringement of its rights by THQ
21 necessarily fails as a matter of law. SOF ¶ 53. It is undisputed that the Ultimate Warrior
22 "character" or "likeness" is not included in any of THQ's games – either in any game's
23 roster of WWE Superstars or among "unlockable" bonus characters. SOF ¶ 49. Instead,
24 the only way a character who resembles the Ultimate Warrior can appear in THQ's games
25 (if, indeed, such character ever even appears in the game) is if the purchaser himself
26 utilizes the Create-A-Wrestler Feature to build from scratch a wrestler the purchaser
27 believes resembles the Ultimate Warrior. SOF ¶ 65.

THQ provides the purchaser with nothing more than generic tools with which he

2 can experiment to create a wrestler who resembles any fantasy character or real-life
3 person. By "experiment[ing] with hundreds of variables to shape the face, head, torso,
4 arms, and legs" and "spend[ing] significant time designing clothing, skin, hair, and
5 accessories," the possibilities are "infinite." SOF ¶¶ 55-56 (Vrabeck Decl. & rpt. at 6).
6 The game player can use the Create-A-Wrestler Feature to fashion a character the player
7 believes resembles the Ultimate Warrior or – by using these exact same tools – his
8 favorite football star, his math teacher, the prom queen, a comic book hero, a wrestler
9 entirely of the player's own imagination, or the player himself. SOF ¶¶ 58, 66. Because
10 THQ in no way instructs or prompts purchasers in what to create, the Create-A-Wrestler
11 Feature is, in essence, nothing more than a high-tech box of crayons.
12

Thus, without a valid trademark to protect or any evidence of infringing conduct

13 on the part of THQ, Plaintiff's section 43(a) claim necessarily fails as a matter of law.10

Plaintiff's Claim Based On THQ's Alleged Use Of The Ultimate
Warrior's "Signature" Moves Fails As A Matter Of Law

Plaintiff claims that "signature move sets" exist in THQ's games that are evocative

17 of wrestling moves once performed by the Ultimate Warrior. SOF ¶¶ 50, 69. THQ
18 assumes arguendo, solely for the purpose of this summary judgment motion, that its
19 games contain wrestling moves similar to (or even the same as) wrestling moves once
20 used by the Ultimate Warrior and that such moves are even now (almost 10 years after
21 his retirement) identifiable with the Ultimate Warrior.11 Yet, even accepting such
22
10

Additionally, after a game player works for over an hour (following a set of
internet-posted directions) or even longer (if working from scratch) to create a character
24 who resembles the Ultimate Warrior – because that character does not exist in the game –
no confusion is possible.
25
11
Plaintiff cannot even identify the allegedly infringing "signature move sets."
26 During his deposition, Warrior claimed a ring entrance and finishing move to be his
27 signature, while claiming that elements of such sequences were also "signature." Warrior
Depo. at 17:14-19:4, 21:14-23:12, 24:13-26:16. Plaintiff's claim fails with respect to any

1 allegations as true, Plaintiff cannot prevail on its section 43(a) claim with respect to these
2 moves because none is a valid, protectable trademark and THQ has never used these
3 moves as a trademark in connection with the sale of goods or services.
4

(a)

5

Plaintiff's "Signature" Moves Are Not Valid Trademarks.

The Ultimate Warrior's wrestling moves – no matter how "trademark" they might

6 be in a colloquial sense – are not trademarks in a legal sense because Plaintiff has never
7 used them as a symbol "to identify and distinguish [its] goods . . . from those
8 manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods." 15 U.S.C.
9 § 1127; see also New Kids, 971 F.2d at 305. Wrestling maneuvers used by the Ultimate
10 Warrior to fight opponents and entertain the crowd were simply an aspect of his wrestling
11 performances. Plaintiff has never used these moves in any other context. SOF ¶¶ 72-73.
12 Because these moves have not been and are not used "to distinguish goods in commerce
13 or to denote their source" and do not "function[] to distinguish anything other than the
14 [moves themselves]," Plaintiff's claim cannot survive summary judgment. Scholastic, 28
15 F. Supp. 2d at 870-71.
16

Plaintiff cannot overcome this fatal defect by arguing that wrestling fans know that

17 it was the Ultimate Warrior who developed these moves or who commonly performed
18 them in the ring. See Warrior Depo. at 115:23-116:18 (claiming "people" seeing such
19 moves would say "[t]hat's an Ultimate Warrior thing"). That people may associate the
20 Ultimate Warrior with these moves as their inventor, developer, or original performer
21 does not give Plaintiff any trademark rights. Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox
22 Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 37 (2003) (section 43(a) protects "the producer of the tangible
23 goods that are offered for sale, and not . . . the author of any idea, concept, or
24 communication embodied in those goods").12
25
26

12

In Dastar, the Supreme Court also expressed concern regarding extending
27 trademark law to cover matters already within the proper scope of copyright – the very
28 extension plaintiff urges here. 539 U.S. at 37.

Indeed, in Oliveira v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 251 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), the Second

2 Circuit rejected an almost identical argument made by a Plaintiff who asserted trademark
3 rights in the recording of her "signature song." Plaintiff alleged that the public had come
4 to identify her with this recording – "her signature piece and the centerpiece of all her
5 concert appearances" – and thus claimed that this "signature performance" had become a
6 mark designating Plaintiff as the singer. Id. at 61. The court, however, found no support
7 for "the notion that a performing artist acquires a trademark or service mark signifying
8 herself in a recording of her own famous performance" and affirmed dismissal of the
9 section 43(a) claim. Id. at 62. Although musical compositions, such as tunes and jingles
10 played in commercials, could serve as marks for goods and services, a "signature
11 performance" that had never served such purpose did not warrant trademark protection.
12 Id.; see also EMI Catalogue P'ship v. Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc., 228 F.3d
13 56, 63 (2d Cir. 2000) (refusing to recognize musical composition as a mark for itself
14 "[b]ecause this would be tantamount to saying that a product itself – in this case, the song
15 – can serve as its own trademark").
16

Similarly, in Hughes v. Design Look Inc., 693 F. Supp. 1500, 1507 (S.D.N.Y.

17 1988), the court held that Warhol images which had never served a source-identifying
18 function were not entitled to trademark protection, despite the fact that the images
19 represented "the unique style of Andy Warhol." The fact that people who saw these
20 images would know they were created by Warhol was not enough. Id.; see also Galerie
21 Furstenberg v. Coffaro, 697 F. Supp. 1282, 1289 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (rejecting argument
22 that trademark exists because "art purchasing public identifies drawings exhibiting those
23 distinguishing images as works created by Dali").13
24
25
13

Even if plaintiff ever had valid trademark rights in the moves he performed in
the WWE, such rights have long been abandoned. 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Warrior has not
27 used these wrestling moves since he retired from wrestling in 1998 – almost 10 years ago.

Plaintiff has not established (and indeed cannot) that the alleged "signature" moves
have ever been used by THQ to identify the source of its games. SOF ¶ 74. There is no
evidence that these moves ever even appeared in any game packaging, advertising, or
marketing materials. Indeed, the appearance of "signature" moves of retired wrestlers in
such materials would be entirely inconsistent with THQ's marketing of the games based
on current WWE Superstars and storylines. Thus, a consumer considering whether to
purchase these games has no idea whether they contain moves similar to those once used
by the Ultimate Warrior (or any other wrestler).

THQ Has Made No Infringing Use Of The "Signature"
Moves

Indeed, even after purchasing the games, there is still no guarantee that a
consumer will ever even see or select the alleged "signature" moves out of the hundreds
of available moves. Indeed, some of the moves Plaintiff identifies exist only as
"unlockable" features of these games. SOF ¶ 75. Although there are many moves in the
games that are identified with the name of a real wrestler, and others that are identified by
number or code, there are no moves named "Ultimate Warrior." SOF ¶¶ 76-77. THQ
publishes no instructions regarding what moves were once used by which wrestlers (if
any are even so identifiable). SOF ¶ 78. A game purchaser thus has no way of knowing
that he can play with moves arguably evocative of the Ultimate Warrior, if any moves
even are, unless he tests out each and every move set and then decides on his own which
are evocative of the Ultimate Warrior.14

23
24
14

Thus, even the move set labeled "Move Set 71 OUW" in SmackDown! Here
Comes the Pain – which Plaintiff claims contains "signature" moves – would not lead a
26 consumer to think that Plaintiff has any involvement or association with these games.
Because there are pages of move sets referenced by the name of a real-life wrestler, a
27 reasonable consumer would no doubt conclude that where there is an association between
28 moves and a real wrestler, that wrestler's name identifies the move set.

Plaintiff's Claim For Infringement Of A Common Law Trademark
Fails For The Same Reasons As Plaintiff's Lanham Act Claims

Because Plaintiff must prove the same elements for its common law infringement

5 Lanham Act claims. See, e.g., United American Indus., Inc. v. Cumberland Packing

CONCLUSION

11

There are thus no triable issues of material fact with respect to any of Plaintiff's

13 judgment and bring this action to an end.
