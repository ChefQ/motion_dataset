MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO

David Adams, et al., by their attorneys, Michael Marshall and Schlachman, Belsky and
Weiner, P.A., file this Memorandum in Opposition of Defendants’ to Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment .
I. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMS MADE BY DEFENDANTS IN
THEIR MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
The Housing Authority of Baltimore City (hereinafter HABC) has moved for partial
summary judgment for determinations that twenty three (23) HABC employees were not
required to attend roll call for portions of time relevant to this lawsuit. HABC contends that
because these plaintiffs were not working or not attending roll call, they would not be entitled to
overtime compensation under Maryland Wage and Hour Law, Md. Code Ann., §§3-401, et. seq.
Plaintiffs assert that the HABC employees who did attend a fifteen minute pre-shift roll call

each day and worked during their non-compensated 30 minute lunch break worked 41.25 hours
per week and are entitled to overtime compensation under Maryland Wage and Hour Law.
The Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment specifies time periods that
certain plaintiffs would be unable to receive overtime compensation because they were not
attending roll call. Defendants state that the employees promoted to supervisory positions are
ineligible for overtime compensation under Maryland Wage and Hour Law, Section 3-403(a)(1).
The defendants allege that plaintiffs who were on administrative duty or attended a police
academy were not attending pre-shift roll call and would not be entitled to compensation. The
defendants specify that certain plaintiffs were not employed by HABC for time periods relevant
to the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs’ complaint submitted the original dates as generalizations and the dates
were not intended to account for individual differentiations in the time worked by specific
plaintiffs at HABC. The defendants could have requested admissions of fact to clarify these
generalizations and the plaintiffs would have verified the accuracy of roll call attendance and
time worked at HABC. The ruling on the defendants’ first motion for summary judgment made
the determination that supervisors would not be entitled to overtime compensation under
Maryland Wage and Hour Law. The basis for this ruling was, either in whole or in part, the lack
of information in affidavits of certain plaintiffs to refute the defendant’s assertions. Four
plaintiffs became supervisors during the time period covered in the complaint and this
determination was not made at the time the plaintiffs calculated the relevant time period.

II. FOUR PLAINTIFFS WERE PROMOTED TO A SUPERVISORY
POSITION DURING RELEVANT TIME PERIODS
The ruling on the HABC’s first motion for summary judgment determined that supervisors
did not sufficiently rebut allegations by Chief Bunch that their positions were mostly supervisory.
Six supervisors were dismissed from the lawsuit as a result of the first motion for summary
judgment. It is unclear if they were dismissed because their affidavits failed to challenge affidavits
by Chief Bunch and the remaining supervisors were not dismissed because their affidavits did
sufficiently challenge the HABC’s claims. The first summary judgment decision does not dismiss
supervisors Alistair Dais, Steven Evans, Gregory House and Delford Jimmerson. The four
remaining supervisors were promoted to supervisory positions during the lawsuit and their affidavits
stated what amount of time they spent supervising and doing the same activities as other officers,
thereby refuting Chief Bunch’s affidavit. Plaintiffs do agree to the time periods alleged by the
HABC that Alistair Dais, Steven Evans, Gregory House, and Delford Jimmerson were promoted.

III. NINE PLAINTIFFS ATTENDED A POLICE ACADEMY
DURING RELEVANT TIME PERIODS
Plaintiffs agree that Derek Brooks,1 Anthony Grant, Joseph Green, Roderick Jackson, Robert
Jordan,2 John Ross, Christopher Reisinger and Elihu Rushdan attended Police Academies
sponsored by various Maryland Police Agencies for the time period stipulated by HABC. Chief
Bunch states that these plaintiffs “took leave from HABC to attend police academy.” See Second
Supplemental Affidavit of Chief Hezekiah Bunch ¶ 21, 28, 30, 34, 38, 40, 44, 48, 53. These
plaintiffs do clarify that they remained HABC employees during their time at the academy. Several
of these Officers were also required to attend roll call. However, they did not have an interrupted
lunch and therefore their roll call attendance would not place them into an overtime situation. Only
Anthony Grant and Roderick Jackson3 attended roll call and were unable to take a full lunch during
their time at the police academy.

1

The HABC alleged that Derek Brooks started on November 20, 1997. Timesheets detailing
personal information about Officer Brooks state that his Entry on Duty (EOD) date was October
20, 1997. See Exhibit A. Because Officer Brooks did not attend roll call during this time, this
conflict does not change the time period alleged by HABC.
2

The HABC alleged that Robert Jordan started on July 27, 1998. Timesheets detailing personal
information about Officer Jordan state that his Entry on Duty (EOD) date was October 20, 1997. See
Exhibit B. Because Officer Jordan did not attend roll call during this time, this conflict does not change
the time period alleged by HABC.
3

In telephone conversations with Officer Grant and Officer Jackson they indicated to varying degrees
that they had an interrupted lunch or were not able to take lunch. They also stated that they attended
pre-shift roll call and required remedial training during their time at the academy. Remedial training
was 2-3 days per week for 1-1.5 hours and was necessary to raise their performance level to pass the
academy. Plaintiffs’ Counsel has not obtained signed affidavits from them at this time, despite requests
made to Officer Grant and Officer Jackson.

In telephone conversations with Norman Kenny, he disputed the time alleged by HABC that
he attended the police academy. He indicated that he graduated in January 1998, not on April 26,
1998 as alleged by the HABC. Plaintiffs’ counsel has not obtained a copy of his academy diploma
at this time, despite requests made to Officer Kenny.
III. TEN PLAINTIFFS DID NOT ATTEND ROLL CALL BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT
EMPLOYED BY HABC OR WERE ASSIGNED ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES
Plaintiffs agree that Trevor Britt, Johnnie Brown, Charles Earle, Jefferson Herriott,4 Stanley
McClean, Thomas Rouch left HABC for the period alleged by HABC. Plaintiffs agree that Donald
Brooks, Kenneth Dean, Patrick Rogers, and Erich Slaughter were suspended and assigned to
administrative duties for the time alleged by HABC.
IV. CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs do not dispute that Derek Brooks, Joseph Green, Robert Jordan, John Ross,
Christopher Reisinger, Elihu Rushdan, Trevor Britt, Johnnie Brown, Charles Earle, Jefferson
Herriott, Stanley McClean, Thomas Rouch, Donald Brooks, Kenneth Dean, Patrick Rogers, and
Erich Slaughter are not eligible to receive overtime compensation for the number of workweeks
asserted by HABC. As to Plaintiffs Sergeant Alistair Dais, Sergeant Steven Evans, Sergeant
Gregory House, and Sergeant Delford Jimmerson it is unclear whether they may be entitled to
compensation for the time after they became supervisors or if they are only included in the

4

Defendants refer to a plaintiff named Joseph Herriott in their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. There is
not a Joseph Herriott named in this complaint. There is a Jefferson Herriott, which the plaintiffs will assume was
the person to whom the defendants were referring.

lawsuit for the portion of time before they were promoted. Plaintiffs do agree to the promotion
dates alleged by HABC for Sergeant Dais, Sergeant Evans, Sergeant House, and Sergeant
Jimmerson.
Plaintiffs do dispute the time period that Anthony Grant and Roderick Jackson may be
eligible for overtime compensation. The HABC does not include the time period that they were
at the academy. However, Officer Grant and Officer Jackson were not always able to take a full
lunch, attended roll call and attended remedial training. Plaintiff Norman Kenny disputes the
time he attended the academy. The contradicting evidence raises an issue of material fact that
makes summary judgment on the time periods alleged by HABC inappropriate.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that HABC’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be
granted in part and denied in part.
