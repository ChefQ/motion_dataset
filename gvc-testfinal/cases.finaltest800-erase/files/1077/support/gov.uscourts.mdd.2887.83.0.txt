DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, defendants Housing Authority of Baltimore City
and various officials of the Housing Authority of Baltimore City hereby move for partial
summary judgment in their favor.
The remaining forty-eight (48) Plaintiffs in this action contend that during the 182
workweeks governing this Complaint (September 23, 1997 – March 25, 2001), they were
required to work through their non-paid 30 minute meal breaks and they were also
required to attend a non-compensable fifteen minute roll call prior to the start of their
shifts each work day. As a result of having not been credited with the thirty minutes of
work which they expended during their daily meal breaks, and as a result of their having
not been credited with the 15 minutes which they spent at daily pre-shift roll calls, the
Plaintiffs allege that they actually regularly worked 41.25 hours each workweek. Since
HABC did not credit them with the time spent at roll calls and meal breaks, they allege
they were wrongfully denied 1.25 hours of overtime each workweek.
The undisputed evidence, however, establishes that: (1)that four of the remaining
plaintiffs held supervisory and executive positions as Sergeants with the HABC Police

Force during a substantial period governing the Complaint and are not due the claimed
overtime for the period that they served in these exempt positions; (2) that another fifteen
remaining Plaintiffs did not attend pre-shift roll calls for substantial periods covering the
Complaint because they were not working at HABC during these substantial periods of
time; and (3) that during substantial periods of time governing the Complaint, four other
remaining Plaintiffs did not attend any pre-shift roll calls because they had been detailed
to administrative assignments pending internal charges and investigations against them.
These administrative assignments did not require or permit them to attend pre-shift roll
calls.
Defendants submit herewith a memorandum with exhibits in support of their
motion.
WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court enter partial
summary judgement in conformity with the undisputed evidence presented in the
accompanying Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Their Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment.
Respectfully Submitted,
