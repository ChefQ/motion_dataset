This memorandum is filed in response to Limelight’s Motion For Reconsideration Of The
Court’s Denial Of Limelight’s Motion For Judgment As A Matter Of Law.
Limelight’s Motion for Reconsideration is predicated on its argument that the Federal
Circuit decision in Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 2008 WL 2717689 (Fed. Cir. July 14,
2008) articulated a change in the legal standard for a finding of infringement of a method claim
where more than one person or entity performs the claimed method steps. Limelight’s motion to
reconsider should be denied because:
1.

The Muniauction decision did not change the legal standard; it simply

reiterated and applied the standard announced in BMC Resources, Inc. v. Paymentech
L.P., 498 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2007);
2.

The trial in the present case took place after the Federal Circuit’s decision

in BMC and the Court’s jury instructions in this case carefully incorporated the BMC
standard.
3.

The jury, having been instructed based on the BMC standard, found

infringement; it had sufficient evidence from which to make its finding.
1.

The Muniauction Decision Did Not Articulate New Law

In BMC Resources, Inc. v. Paymentech, L.P., 498 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Federal
Circuit held that in order to infringe a method claim, one entity must either perform all of the
steps of the claimed method or must direct or control the actions of others who perform some of
those steps. In the case at bar, the Court correctly charged the jury using the direction or control
standard. The jury found in favor of Akamai.
The Federal Circuit’s decision in Muniauction expressly confirms the BMC standard.
2008 WL 2717689 at *8. In that case, the trial took place before BMC was decided and, as a

4360090v1

result, the trial court did not charge the jury in accordance with the BMC standard. The Federal
Circuit assessed the case under the BMC standard and found insufficient evidence to support the
jury’s findings of infringement.
Limelight tells the Court that Muniauction created a new requirement for proving joint
infringement, viz., “a showing that the accused direct infringement is vicariously liable for the
acts committed by any other required to complete performance of the claimed method.”
Limelight Motion at p. 2; Memorandum at p. 2. This is simply not so. While the Federal
Circuit noted that “[u]nder BMC Resources, the control or direction standard is satisfied in
situations where the law would traditionally hold the accused direct infringer vicariously liable
for the acts committed by another party,” id., 2008 WL 2717689 at *9 (emphasis supplied), it
did not impose a new legal standard. Rather, it provided an example of one way of proving the
direction or control standard articulated in BMC.
2.

The Change Here Incorporated the BMC Standard

In this case, which was tried after the BMC decision, both parties requested, and the
Court included, a jury instruction expressly incorporating the BMC standard.1 Jury Charge,
13:53.2
3.

There Was Sufficient Evidence From Which The Jury Found
Infringement Applying the BMC Standard

In Muniauction, the patent claimed an auction process in which bond underwriters input
bids, the interest cost of the bid is calculated, the bid is transmitted over a network (e.g., the

In fact, the Court’s initial instruction to the jury said that Akamai had to prove that Limelight directed and
controlled the steps carried out by its customers. Jury Charge, 13:20-21 At the request of both parties at sidebar, the
Court corrected its instruction to say that Akamai had to prove that Limelight directed or controlled the steps carried
out by its customers. Jury Charge, 13:51-53

Internet), and the bid is displayed on the bond issuer’s terminal. The plaintiff alleged that the
Thomson, the entity that ran the auction system, infringed the claim. At the end of a decision
that is largely devoted to other issues, the Federal Circuit held, citing BMC, that a method claim
is infringed “if one party exercises direction or control over the entire process such that every
step is attributable to … the mastermind.” Muniauction, 2008 WL 2717689 at *8. The question,
the Court said, was whether there was sufficient direction or control by the auctioneer over the
independent bidder. On the record in the Muniauction case, the Federal Circuit held that it was
“not sufficient” to show merely that the patent holder “controls access to its system and instructs
bidders on its use” -- i.e., teaches them how to use the system. Id. at *9.
The facts of this case are grossly different from those of Muniauction and more than
sufficient to support the jury verdict of infringement under the BMC standard. Limelight’s
customers execute contracts with Limelight that require the customer to use Limelight’s “then
current Company processes … to enable … Customer Content to be delivered by” Limelight and
compel the customer to provide “all cooperation … reasonably necessary for Company
[Limelight] to implement its CDS [Content Distribution Service].” PX0429 at LLN0157950
(Ex. B); Gordon, 8:120. Limelight then gives to the customer a “short name” or hostname.
Gordon, 8:105-110; PX0382 (Ex. C). The short name is a virtual hostname that identifies the
customer’s content and points to the Limelight network. The customer must use the Limelightsupplied hostname, either in the URLs embedded in pages that are served by the customer, or
must serve a page that contains aliases for the Limelight-supplied hostname and then substitute
the Limelight-supplied hostname during the DNS process. Kelly, 9:114; PX0419 (Ex. D)
(Limelight Installation Guidelines: “…the customer will need to use” the “LLNW URL”)
(emphasis supplied). Either way, Limelight requires the customer to tag embedded objects of a

page so that requests for those objects resolve to the Limelight domain. The customer must
serve the page containing the Limelight-supplied hostname or an alias for that hostname. There
is no other purpose for providing a hostname to the customer, and no other way that Limelight
can provide the service that Limelight provides. Gordon, 8:118-119 (“… if they want us to
deliver content they have to publish [serve pages containing] URLs using that [Limelightassigned] short name … or implement a CNAME process to do that”).3
Thus, the only steps of claims 19-21 and 34 of the '703 patent that are performed by
persons other than Limelight are performed by Limelight’s content provider customers. Those
customers, once they sign Limelight’s contract, are under a contractual obligation to -implement Limelight’s content delivery method by serving pages that include a hostname
supplied by Limelight to the customer. The jury was entitled to find that Limelight was the
“mastermind,” that it directed or controlled the actions of its customers when they performed the
“tagging” and “serving the page” steps of the relevant claims. The jury was charged correctly.
The jury did so find. There is no basis in law or in fact for overturning its verdict.
