INTRODUCTION
Limelight Networks, Inc. (“Limelight”) moves for reconsideration of the Court’s July 1,

2008 denial of its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL). Limelight’s motion is based
on the July 14, 2008 Federal Circuit opinion in Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., -- F.3d --,
2008 WL 2717689 (Fed. Cir. July 14, 2008)1. In Muniauction, the Federal Circuit (in a
unanimous opinion written by Judge Gajarsa, the author of the prior Federal Circuit decision
regarding the ‘703 Patent in this suit2) established that the joint infringement theory relied upon
by Akamai in the present case requires a showing that the accused direct infringer is vicariously
liable for the acts committed by any others required to complete performance of the claimed
method. Further, the Court held as a matter of law that an accused infringer’s control over
access to an Internet-based system, coupled with instructions to customers on how to use that
system, is insufficient to establish direct infringement. Id. at *9. Thus, Akamai’s proof in this
case — which did not establish any basis for vicarious liability for the acts of others, and merely
showed that Limelight controlled access to its Internet-based system and provided instructions to
its customers on how to use that system — is insufficient as a matter of law.
Limelight therefore requests, based on the law established by the July 14, 2008 Federal
Circuit decision in Muniauction, that this Court reconsider its July 1, 2008 denial of Limelight’s
Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and enter judgment that Limelight does not infringe
Claims 19-21 and 34 of U.S. Patent No. 6,108,703 (“the ‘703 Patent”).

UNDER THE MUNIAUCTION STANDARD, LIMELIGHT IS NOT LIABLE FOR
DIRECT INFRINGEMENT
Limelight and Akamai do not dispute, and the evidence at trial confirmed, that no

single party performs every step of the asserted claims of the ‘703 Patent. Rather, Limelight’s
customers (not Limelight) allegedly perform certain steps of the asserted claims (including what
Akamai alleged was “tagging” in Claims 19-21 and 34 and “serving the given page from the
content provider domain” in Claims 19-21). (Docket # 345 (Limelight’s Mem. in Support of its
Mtns. for Judgment as a Matter of Law Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50) at 24-28). The evidence
Akamai asserts it presented to prove direct infringement3, under a “joint infringement” theory,
was that Limelight provides “instructions or directions” to its customers to perform one or more
steps of the asserted claims. (See Docket # 343 (Akamai’s Mem. in Opposition to Limelight’s
Mtn. for Judgment as a Matter of Law) at 31-33).
Two weeks after this Court denied Limelight’s Motion (See July 1, 2008 Electronic
Order), the Federal Circuit announced its vicarious liability standard in the Muniauction
decision, based on facts remarkably similar to the instant case. In Muniauction, the Court of
Appeals overturned a jury verdict of infringement (and a subsequent denial of JMOL for noninfringement), because no single party either performed or had another party perform on its
behalf each step of the asserted claims. And because the plaintiff identified no legal theory on
which the accused infringer might be vicariously liable for the actions of its customers, the
Federal Circuit held that the defendant could not infringe the asserted claims, as a matter of law.
Muniauction, 2008 WL 2717689 at *9.
The issue in Muniauction, also presented in the instant case, was whether the accused
infringer was responsible for the actions of its customers by issuing instructions to those
customers on how to use the accused Internet-based system. Reversing the jury verdict of
infringement, the Federal Circuit held that the fact the defendant controlled access to its Internet3

Akamai voluntarily abandoned all indirect infringement assertions prior to trial. (See Email from C. Perez to A.
Mackinnon on Feb. 10, 2008 attached hereto as Exhibit B; see also Trial Tr. 46:4-9, February 26, 2008,
Charge Conf, Transcript Appendix attached hereto as Exhibit C).

based system, and instructed its customers how to use that system, was legally insufficient to
establish direct infringement. Id. at *9.4
The claims at issue in Muniauction concerned a method of carrying out electronic
bidding on the Internet and required that a customer perform at least one step of the claimed
method (e.g., inputting the customer’s bid on his/her computer). Id. at *8-9. The accused
infringer operated the Internet-based bidding system and performed many of the other steps of
the asserted method claims. Id. at *8. The Federal Circuit held that the accused infringer was
not liable because no legal theory existed under which the accused infringer might be vicariously
liable for the actions of its customers. Id. at *9. “[M]ere ‘arms-length cooperation’ will not
give rise to direct infringement by any party.” Id. at *8 (emphasis added). Further, the fact that
the accused infringer “controls access to its system and instructs bidders on its use is not
sufficient to incur liability for direct infringement.” Id. at *9 (emphasis added).
The Muniauction case is remarkably similar to the instant case, most pertinently in terms
of the divided infringement facts. Like the patent claims in Muniauction, the asserted ‘703
Patent claims involve multiple steps which no one entity performs. Rather, the actions of both
the CDN operator and its customers are required to meet the requirements of each claimed
method.
Further, just as in Muniauction, Akamai’s theory of Limelight’s alleged liability was that
Limelight instructed its customers how to use the Limelight CDN system and gain access to its
system.5 This precise argument was considered and expressly found to be legally insufficient to
4

This intervening decision by the Federal Circuit on joint infringement justifies reconsideration. See Davis v.
Lehane, 89 F.Supp.2d 142, 147 (D. Mass. 2000) (stating that “a court should grant a motion for reconsideration
of an interlocutory order only when the movant demonstrates (1) an intervening change in the law; (2) the
discovery of new evidence not previously available; or (3) a clear error of law in the first order”); see also
Vermont Pure Holdings, Ltd. v. Nestle Waters N.A., Inc., Case No. Civ.A.03-11465 DPW, 2006 WL 839486 at
*3 (D. Mass. Mar. 28, 2006).

Akamai also argued that the customer’s acts that may comprise a step of the claim are “necessary” to use the
Limelight system. (See Docket # 343 at 35). This argument was also rejected in Muniauction. To use the
accused infringer’s online bidding system, its customers must input their bids into the customer’s computer (a
step in the claim); but the Federal Circuit held that such acts, even though necessary and under the instructions
of the accused infringer, were insufficient to establish direct infringement by the accused infringer.
Muniauction, 2008 WL 2717689 at *8.

establish direct infringement in Muniauction. As the Federal Circuit has now held, direct
infringement requires a showing that the accused direct infringer is vicariously liable for the acts
committed by any others required to complete performance of the claimed method, and an armslength relationship with customers, even when coupled with instructions to those customers on
how to use the accused infringer’s system can not suffice, as a matter of law, to prove direct
infringement.
Akamai also argued that Limelight’s “contractual relationship” with its customers was
sufficient “direction or control” to incur liability for the steps of the asserted claims performed
by those customers. (Docket # 343 at 31 fn. 11, 33). The patentee in Muniauction made the
same argument (see Muniauction Federal Circuit Brief, 2007 WL 4693007 at *47 attached hereto
as Exhibit D), which the Federal Circuit rejected — finding that the contractual relationship did
not suffice.
Under this binding precedent established by the Federal Circuit’s July 14, 2008 holding
in Muniauction, Akamai has not shown direct infringement by Limelight and the verdict should
be set aside.
III.

CONCLUSION
In light of the law established by the Federal Circuit’s July 14, 2008 decision in

Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., Limelight cannot be liable for infringement of the asserted
method claims of the ‘703 Patent. No evidence introduced by Akamai establishes that Limelight
is vicariously liable for the acts committed by any others required to complete performance of
the method covered by the asserted claims. And the fact that Limelight enters into contracts
with, and provides instruction to, its customers to perform certain acts in order to use the
Limelight CDN, is now ruled to be insufficient to establish direct infringement, as a matter of
law. Accordingly, the Court should reconsider its denial of Limelight’s Motion for Judgment as
a Matter of Law and enter judgment in Limelight’s favor that Limelight does not infringe Claims
19-21 or 34 of the ‘703 Patent.
