DEFENDANT TIME WARNER CABLE INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS OR, IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, TO STAY AND COMPEL ARBITRATION
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff is a customer of Time Warner Cable Inc. (“TWC”). Plaintiff brought this suit
seeking to certify national and statewide classes for the purposes of pursuing claims under the
federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and § 392.302(f) of the Texas Financial Code,
respectively. As a basis for his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that TWC called his cell phone in a
mistaken attempt to collect a debt owed by another TWC customer.
When Plaintiff became a TWC customer, he expressly agreed to arbitrate any dispute that
arose between him and TWC. The parties’ arbitration agreement also clearly provides that the
arbitrator (not a court) must resolve any issues regarding the scope and applicability of the
arbitration agreement. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s attempt to bring his dispute against TWC in
federal court is improper, and TWC requests that this Court dismiss or stay this lawsuit and
compel Plaintiff to submit this dispute to arbitration as agreed to by the parties.

RELEVANT FACTS

A. Plaintiff’s Relationship with TWC
Plaintiff has been a TWC customer since 2009. (Amended Compl (DE 21), ¶ 9.)
Specifically, Time Warner Cable provides high-speed internet services to Plaintiff. (Amended
Compl. ¶ 9.) At the time these services were installed, Plaintiff signed a work order1 (the “Work
Order”) in which he expressly accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms of TWC’s
Residential Services Subscriber Agreement, which were expressly incorporated by reference into
the Work Order. (Tagg. Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) The Residential Services Subscriber Agreement
included both an arbitration provision and a provision that TWC had the right to modify the
terms of the agreement. (Id.)
In 2010, TWC revised the Residential Services Subscriber Agreement to, among other
things, add an opt-out option to the arbitration provision, providing that customers had 30 days to
opt out of arbitration provision if they so wished. (Id., ¶ 7.) TWC informed Masters in a May
2010 billing statement about the revised Residential Services Subscriber Agreement and
specifically noted that the agreement included an arbitration clause and an opt-out option.2 (Id.)
The current and operative version of Time Warner Cable’s Residential Services
Subscriber Agreement (the “Subscriber Agreement”) is available online at
http://help.twcable.com/html/twc_sub_agreement.html. (Id., ¶ 8.) This site is available to
current and prospective customers alike at all times.3 (Id.)

Case 1:12-cv-00451-SS Document 28 Filed 09/06/12 Page 3 of 12

The Subscriber Agreement contains a broad arbitration clause that covers any dispute
between Plaintiff and TWC (the “Arbitration Clause”), including the alleged dispute which gives
rise to this litigation. (Subscriber Agreement, ¶ 15.) The first page of the Subscriber Agreement
expressly discloses the existence of the Arbitration Clause in bold, capital, red letters that are set
off from the surrounding text by a prominent box. (Subscriber Agreement, p. 1.) The Work
Order similarly discloses in prominent text adjacent to the signature line that Plaintiff was
agreeing to arbitration and waiving any right to a jury trial for any disputes with TWC. (Work
Order, p. 1.)
The Arbitration Clause is set forth in Paragraph 15 of the Subscriber Agreement. The
Clause states that both Masters and TWC agree that, if they cannot resolve a “Dispute”
informally, the parties will:
submit the Dispute to the American Arbitration Association for resolution under
its Commercial Arbitration Rules or, by separate mutual agreement, to another
arbitration institution. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local
“small claims” court, if its rules permit it.
(Subscriber Agreement, ¶ 15(a).) A “Dispute” is defined very broadly to include:
[A]ny dispute, claim, or controversy between you and [TWC] regarding any
aspect of your relationship with us, including those based on events that occurred
prior to the date of this Agreement.
(Subscriber Agreement ¶ 16(e).)
Nor is this an arbitration requirement foisted upon all TWC customers. The
Arbitration Clause very clearly states that any customer that does not want to waive his

3

Case 1:12-cv-00451-SS Document 28 Filed 09/06/12 Page 4 of 12

ability to bring claims within the court system may opt out of the Arbitration Clause.
(Subscriber Agreement ¶ 15(e).)4
The Arbitration Clause also clearly and unmistakably states that “The arbitrator
will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.” (Subscriber Agreement ¶ 15(b)
(emphasis added).) Therefore, whether Plaintiff’s claims in this litigation fall within the
broad scope of the Arbitration Clause is for an arbitrator to decide.
B. The Alleged Basis for Plaintiff’s Claims5
In this lawsuit, Plaintiff seeks to certify national and statewide classes to pursue claims
under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and § 392.302(f) of the Texas Financial Code,
respectively, because he allegedly received auto-dialed telephone calls on his cell phone from
Time Warner Cable between October 2011 and April 2012. The Plaintiff believes these calls are
actionable as they were purportedly made with the attempt to harass and without the Plaintiff’s
consent. (Amended Compl., ¶¶ 11-37.) TWC disputes the Plaintiff’s allegations. Whether the
claims are actionable, however, is not germane to the issue of whether this case should be heard
in federal court or within an arbitration proceeding.
III.

ARGUMENT

Given that the parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes between them, Plaintiff’s attempt
to litigate this dispute in federal court is improper and this case should be dismissed. The parties

4

The arbitration disclosure on the first page of the Subscriber Agreement also expressly
indicates that Plaintiff could “opt out” of the arbitration requirement pursuant to Section 15 of
the Subscriber Agreement. This provision clearly states that Plaintiff was not required to accept
the Arbitration Clause and could have opted out of the arbitration requirement by notifying TWC
in writing within 30 days of being notified of the opt-out option. (Subscriber Agreement, ¶
15(e).) Plaintiff did not opt out of the Arbitration Clause. (Tagg Decl., ¶ 9.)
5

Plaintiff’s allegations are taken from his Complaint. TWC does not admit the truth of those
allegations by referencing them in this Motion.
4

Case 1:12-cv-00451-SS Document 28 Filed 09/06/12 Page 5 of 12

executed a valid and binding Arbitration Clause, and have agreed to arbitrate any disputes
between them. Moreover, the parties have agreed that whether any particular dispute is covered
by the Arbitration Clause is to be resolved by the arbitrator. Accordingly, TWC requests that
this Court dismiss this case or, in the alternative, stay this case pending the arbitrator’s
determination as to whether this dispute falls within the parties’ Arbitration Clause.
A. Legal Standard for Motion to Compel Arbitration
As stated by the Fifth Circuit, “it bears repeating that we remain mindful of the strong
federal policy favoring arbitration.” Fedmet Corp. v. M/V BUYALYK, 194 F.3d 674, 676 (5th
Cir. 1999) (citing United Offshore Company v. Southern Deepwater Pipeline Co., 899 F.2d 405,
408 (5th Cir.1990); accord Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.,
460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983) (confirming that the Federal Arbitration Act “is a congressional
declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.”) Indeed, “[t]he
preference for arbitration is such that any doubts as to the availability of arbitration must be
resolved in favor of arbitration.” Fedmet Corp, 194 F.3d at 676.
A motion to compel arbitration is proper where (1) the parties entered into a valid
arbitration agreement; and (2) the dispute is within the scope of the agreement. See Graves v. BP
Am., Inc., 568 F.3d 221, 222 (5th Cir. 2009). The parties may delegate the second inquiry to the
arbitrator, so long as there “has been a clear demonstration that the parties contemplated it.”
Agere Sys., Inc. v. Samsung Elec. Co., Ltd., 560 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (reversing and
remanding to allow the arbitrator to determine the scope of arbitration agreement). Accordingly,
“even the issue of arbitrability ‘may be submitted to binding arbitration.’” Id. (internal quotation
marks omitted); accord Rent-A-Ctr., W. Inc. v. Jackson, 130 S. Ct. 2772, 2777 (2010)

5

Case 1:12-cv-00451-SS Document 28 Filed 09/06/12 Page 6 of 12

(“Arbitration agreements that clearly and unmistakably show intent to assign gateway issues
[such as arbitrability] to the arbitrator are fully enforceable.”).)
Where the parties have agreed that the arbitrator will determine whether a dispute falls
within the scope of the arbitration agreement, the Court need only conduct a limited inquiry to
determine whether “the assertion of arbitrability is wholly groundless.” Agere, 560 F.3d at 340.
Here, TWC’s assertion of arbitrability is clearly not “wholly groundless,” given that the
Arbitration Clause expressly covers any dispute between the parties. Therefore, this Court
should dismiss or stay this case, allow the parties to proceed with arbitration, and defer to the
parties’ agreement to allow the arbitrator to determine whether Plaintiff’s claims are covered by
the Arbitration Clause.
B. The Parties’ Arbitration Agreement is Valid.
The Arbitration Clause clearly demonstrates that the parties have entered into a valid
arbitration agreement. The validity of the arbitration agreement is governed by “ordinary statelaw principles that govern the formation of contracts.” See Graves, 568 F.3d at 222. As the
Supreme Court has held, “in applying general state-law principles of contract interpretation to
the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the Act, due regard must be
given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration
clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.” Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Bd. of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 475-76 (1989). Here, Plaintiff signed his Work
Order purchasing high-speed internet services from TWC, and by doing so and using those
services, Plaintiff accepted and agreed to be bound by the Subscriber Agreement. (Subscriber
Agreement p. 1.) The Arbitration Clause was prominently identified on both documents.

6

Case 1:12-cv-00451-SS Document 28 Filed 09/06/12 Page 7 of 12

Here, the Subscriber Agreement highlights the arbitration clause by referencing the
arbitration clause on the first page of the Subscriber Agreement, in bold, red, capital letters and
further expressly informs Plaintiff that he could opt out of the agreement if he wished.
(Subscriber Agreement p. 1.) The Work Order similarly highlighted the Arbitration Clause.
This level of enhanced notice was provided by TWC not as a legal requirement, but to ensure
that customers make knowing choices. Plaintiff willingly signed the Work Order, accepted cable
internet service from TWC, and never opted out of the Arbitration Clause. The case law is clear
that the Arbitration Clause is binding as long as it is part of the parties’ agreement. See In re
H.E. Butt Grocery Co., 17 S.W.3d 360, 370–71 (Tex. App. 2000). Therefore, the Arbitration
Clause is valid and enforceable.
C. The Parties Clearly and Unmistakably Agreed that the Arbitrator Will Decide
Arbitrability.
The Arbitration Clause sets forth the parties’ agreement that the arbitrator would
determine whether any dispute was covered by the Arbitration Clause. The Arbitration Clause
expressly states that “[t]he arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.”
(Subscriber Agreement ¶ 15(b).). The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has confirmed that such an
express contractual provision demonstrates the parties’ “unmistakable” intent to “to delegate the
power to decide arbitrability to the arbitrator.” See Agere, 560 F.3d at 340 (holding that contract
provision providing that the arbitrator “shall determine issues of arbitrability” demonstrated clear
and unmistakable agreement between the parties).6
The parties’ intent to delegate arbitrability to an arbitrator is further demonstrated by the
Arbitration Clause’s express incorporation of the American Arbitration Association’s
6

The scope of the arbitration agreement “is answered by applying the federal substantive law of
arbitrability.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

Case 1:12-cv-00451-SS Document 28 Filed 09/06/12 Page 8 of 12

Commercial Arbitration Rules (Subscriber Agreement ¶ 15(a).). The AAA’s rules state that
“[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any
objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.” (AAA
Rule 7(a).)7 Courts nationwide have consistently held that where the parties agree “to a broad
arbitration clause and explicitly incorporate rules that empower an arbitrator to decide issues of
arbitrability, the incorporation serves as clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties’ intent to
delegate such issues to an arbitrator.” Contec Corp. v. Remote Solution, Co., Ltd., 398 F.3d 205,
208 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Qualcomm Inc. v. Nokia Corp., 466 F.3d 1366, 1372–73 (Fed. Cir.
2006) (concluding that agreement’s incorporation of AAA rules clearly and unmistakably
showed parties' intent to delegate issue of determining arbitrability to arbitrator); Terminix Int'l
Co., LP v. Palmer Ranch Ltd. P’ship, 432 F.3d 1327, 1332–33 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that by
incorporating AAA Rules into arbitration agreement, parties clearly and unmistakably agreed
that arbitrator should decide whether arbitration clause was valid); Citifinancial, Inc. v. Newton,
359 F. Supp. 2d 545, 549–52 (S.D. Miss. 2005) (same); Sleeper Farms v. Agway, Inc., 211 F.
Supp. 2d 197, 200 (D. Me. 2002) (same). Therefore, the Arbitration Clause’s express
incorporation of the AAA’s Rules on its own would be sufficient evidence of the parties’
agreement to delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator. Here, however, the Arbitration Clause is
even more explicit – it expressly states that the parties agreed that “[t]he arbitrator will decide
whether a dispute can be arbitrated.” (Subscriber Agreement ¶ 15(b).)
Given the broad scope of the Arbitration Clause, the arbitrability of the parties’ dispute is
clear and TWC’s argument for arbitration is far from “wholly groundless.” Agere, 560 F.3d at

340. Moreover, “[w]henever the scope of an arbitration clause is in question, the court should
construe the clause in favor of arbitration.” City of Meridian, Miss. v. Algernon Blair, Inc., 721
F.2d 525, 527 (5th Cir. 1983) (citing United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S.
574, 582 (1960)). Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit “presume[s] that arbitration should not be
denied ‘unless it can be said with positive assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible
of an interpretation which would cover the dispute at issue.” Commerce Park of DFW Freeport
v. Mardian Constr. Co., 729 F.2d 334, 338 (5th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Given the scope of the Arbitration Clause and the presumption in favor of arbitration, it is
clear that the arbitrator must determine whether Plaintiff’s claims are arbitrable. Indeed,
Plaintiff’s dispute raised in this lawsuit centers on his relationship with TWC. He alleges that
TWC “harassed” him by calling him in an attempt to collect a debt, which was purportedly owed
by a different TWC customer. (Amended Compl. ¶¶ 11-36.) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s dispute
falls squarely within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. To the extent Plaintiff has any issue
with the arbitrability of this dispute, he must raise it with the arbitrator. See Agere, 560 F.3d at
340 (holding that the “resolution of [the] plausible arguments” regarding arbitrability “is left for
the arbitrator”). Therefore, this Court should enforce the parties’ Arbitration Clause and dismiss
Plaintiff’s Complaint. See Michael Angelo's Gourmet Foods, Inc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of
Pittsburgh, Pa., A-05-CA-912-SS, 2006 WL 2241225 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 4, 2006) (holding that
“dismissal, rather than a stay pending the outcome of arbitration” was proper where the
plaintiff’s claims “fall within the coverage of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate”); Alford v.
Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 975 F.2d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1992) (“The weight of authority
clearly supports dismissal of the case when all of the issues raised in the district court must be
submitted to arbitration.”)

IV.

CONCLUSION

In signing up for services with TWC, Plaintiff expressly agreed to submit any dispute
with TWC to arbitration and to permit the arbitrator to resolve any issues of arbitrability. If
Plaintiff did not wish to resolve disputes through arbitration, or not submit “all disputes” to
arbitration and have the arbitrator determine issues of arbitrability, Plaintiff could easily have
opted out of the parties’ mutual Arbitration Clause. He did not do so. Therefore, TWC
respectfully requests that this Court grant TWC’s Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, to
Stay and Compel Arbitration.
