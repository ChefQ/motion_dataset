I. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION

2

On October 29, 2010, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Defendants, alleging

3
4
5
6

violation of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. ECF No.1. The crux of the
Plaintiff’s complaint is that she was unlawfully threatened with garnishment by
Ms. Bull1, a debt collector and employee of Defendant Automated Accounts, Inc.

7
8

(hereinafter “Automated”). Defendants generally denied the Plaintiff’s allegations.

9

On September 20, 2011, Depositions of Ms. Bull and Ms. Braham were taken.

10

Although the precise wording of the verbal exchange between Ms. Bull and the

11

Plaintiff that formed the basis of this action is not fully agreed upon, Ms. Bull’s

12
13

deposition testimony reveals that the parties are sufficiently in agreement as to the

14

language that Plaintiff asserts is in violation of the FDCPA, such that no genuine

15

issue of material fact exists. Otherwise stated, taking Ms. Bull’s testimony in the

16
17

light most favorable to her, relying on her allegedly contemporaneous notes, and

18

assuming for the purpose of this motion that her deposition testimony is an

19

accurate reflection of the verbal exchange between Ms. Bull and Ms. Braham,

20

Defendants’ conduct violated the FDCPA and Plaintiff is entitled to judgment

21
22

against Ms. Bull and Automated on the issue of liability.

23
1

Ms. Bull was previously identified as Michelle Doe in the Plaintiff’s Complaint. Michelle Doe’s true identity, was

24
subsequently disclosed by the Defendants. The person identified as Michelle Doe in the Plaintiff’s Complaint is
25
identified as “Michelle Bull”, “Ms. Bull”, and “Defendant Bull” herein.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
An order granting summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence reveals

3
4
5
6

there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). “A genuine issue of material fact
exists if there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to

7
8
9
10

return a verdict for that party.” Spence v. ESAB Group, Inc., 623 F.3d 212, 216 (3d
Cir.2010) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct.
2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). In arguing that a genuine issue of material fact

11

exists that precludes summary judgment, the non-movant must identify specific
12
13

evidence in the record to support its position. Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112,

14

119 (5th Cir.2007). “ ‘However, the nonmovant cannot satisfy this burden with

15

conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla of evidence.’

16
17

” Id. (quoting Freeman v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, 369 F.3d 854, 860 (5th

18

Cir.2004)). The inquiry to be made mirrors the standard for a directed verdict:

19

whether the evidence presented by the party with the onus of proof is sufficient

20

that a jury could properly proceed to return a verdict for that party. Anderson v.
21
22

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).

23

Essentially, the question in ruling on a motion for summary judgment and on a

24

motion for directed verdict is whether the evidence presents a sufficient

25

disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one

party must prevail as a matter of law. Id., 106 S.Ct. at 2512.Where, as here, the
parties disagree about the precise wording of their verbal exchange but the parties

3
4
5

both recount an exchange in which the Defendants violated the applicable statute
(FDCPA), summary judgment is appropriate.

6

III. ARGUMENT

7

The FDCPA states that its purpose, in part, is "to eliminate abusive debt

8
9

collection practices by debt collectors." 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e). It is designed to

10

protect consumers from unscrupulous collectors, whether or not there is a valid

11

debt. Baker v. G.C. Services Corp., 677 F.2d 775, 777 (9th Cir. 1982). The
12
13

FDCPA broadly prohibits unfair or unconscionable collection methods; conduct

14

which harasses, oppresses or abuses any debtor; and any false, deceptive or

15

misleading statements, in connection with the collection of a debt; it also requires

16
17

debt collectors to give debtors certain information. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692d, 1692e,

18

and 1692f. "Congress intended the [FDCPA] be enforced primarily by

19

consumers." F.T.C. v. Shaffner, 626 F.2d 32, 35 (7th Cir. 1980). The FDCPA must

20

be enforced "as Congress has written it." Frey v. Gangwish, 970 F.2d 1516, 1521
21
22

(6th Cir. 1992).

A. For purposes of this motion there is no factual dispute about the Defendants’

violation

3

For purposes of this Summary Judgment Motion, Plaintiff relies solely on

4

the testimony of Ms. Bull regarding what was said to the Plaintiff during their
November 2, 2009 conversation. Although there is a dispute between the parties as

7
8

to exactly what was said, even if the Court draws every inference in favor of the
Defendants, as it must, it is still clear that the Defendants violated the FDCPA.
According to Ms. Bull’s own deposition testimony, she recounts her

10
11

conversation with Ms. Braham on November 2, 2009 as follow:
12
13

Q. Did you tell [Ms. Braham] that you were starting a legal process?

14
15

A. Yes, which is requesting assignment [of the account from the creditor],

16
17

which is what I did.

18
19

Q. And you didn’t know at that point if that would involve garnishment or not;

20

is that correct?
21

A. I had no idea…

22
23
24

Q. [Ms. Braham then] asked you if that meant garnishment, and you said that is

25

part of the legal process…?

judgment was a virtual certainty and therefore was deceptive).

B. The Court Must Analyze the Communication from the Standpoint of the
12

Least Sophisticated Debtor

13

Courts in this Circuit have been instructed that they "shall find a violation of

14
15

Section 1692e if [the collector's communication is] likely to deceive or mislead a

16
17

hypothetical 'least sophisticated debtor.'" Wade v. Regional Credit Ass'n, 87 F.3d

18

1098, 1100 (9th Cir. 1996). The standard is an "objective" one that "is 'lower than

19

simply examining whether particular language would deceive or mislead a

20

reasonable debtor. '" Terran v. Kaplan, 109 F.3d 1428,1431-32 (9th Cir. 1997),
21
22

quoting Swanson v. Southern Oregon Credit Service, Inc., 869 F.2d 1222, 1227

23

(9th Cir. 1988). As explained by Judge Cabranes in the seminal Second Circuit

24

case, ''The basic purpose of the least-sophisticated-consumer standard is to ensure

25

that the FDCPA protects all consumers, the gullible as well as the shrewd."

The Court’s inquiry does not include an analysis of the actual sophistication of the
Plaintiff. Defendants’ references to the academic achievements and background
of the Plaintiff are irrelevant for purposes of this case, as are the Defendant’s
comments on the reasonableness of the Plaintiff’s understanding.

12

“Whether conduct violates [the FDCPA] ... requires an objective analysis that

13

and "least sophisticated debtor" interchangeably [see e.g. Donohue v. Quick Collect,

determined to be of no legal consequence. Brown v. Card Service Center, 464 F.3d
450,453 n.1 (3rd Cir. 2006); see also Graziano v. Harrison, 950 F.2d 107, 111 n.5 (3rd

that "least sophisticated consumer" would be "a more appropriate phrase" in view of
FDCPA terminology).

3

The “least sophisticated debtor” standard is “lower than simply examining

(internal quotation marks omitted). The standard is “designed to protect consumers

7
8

of below average sophistication or intelligence,” or those who are “uninformed or
naive,” particularly when those individuals are targeted by debt collectors. Duffy v.
Landberg, 215 F.3d 871, 874–75 (8th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks

11

omitted); accord Evory v. RJM Acquisitions Funding L.L.C., 505 F.3d 769, 774
12
13

(7th Cir.2007) (cautioning that “if the debt collector has targeted a particularly

14

vulnerable group,” “the benchmark for deciding whether the communication is

15

deceptive would be the competence of the substantial bottom fraction of that

16
17
18
19

group”). At the same time, the standard “preserv[es] a quotient of reasonableness
and presum[es] a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care.”
Rosenau v. Unifund Corp., 539 F.3d 218, 221 (3d Cir.2008) (internal quotation

20

marks omitted). The FDCPA does not subject debt collectors to liability for
21

“bizarre,” “idiosyncratic,” or “peculiar” misinterpretations. See id.; Strand v.

In relevant part, 15 USC §1692e states:

4
5

A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or
means in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general
application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:
(4) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in
the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment,
or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the
debt collector or creditor intends to take such action.

“Section 1692e(10), which prohibits “[t]he use of any false representation or

irrelevant to the Courts analysis of this motion, the Plaintiff was deceived by Ms.
Bull’s statement into believing that her wages might be garnished. Hence, Ms.
Bull’s statements to the Plaintiff violate the FDCPA.

10

2009 conversation Defendant Bull told Ms. Braham that garnishment is part of the
legal process and that Defendants were going to start the legal process. (Bull Dep.

legal justification by which to institute any garnishment proceedings against the

debt collector's motion for summary judgment, stating:

Even if so, this would not necessarily carry the day for Friedman, for
the letters do not just say he was authorized to sue; they indicate that a
suit is imminent. Falsely threatening imminent litigation when the
decision whether to sue has not been made violates the FDCPA. The
fact that Friedman did in fact sue some debtors (including [the
plaintiff] ), though relevant, is not dispositive. The issue is whether
the threat of imminent litigation was true when made. Sowers v.

Defendants’ argument that literal truth insulates it from liability is directly

communication "does not state false facts." Simeon Management Corp. v. F.T.C.
579 F.2d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir. 1978) (affirming deception under the Federal Trade
Commission Act). The adoption of the least sophisticated consumer standard built

deceive"); Clomon v. Jackson, 988 F.2d at 1318 (“This standard is consistent with

6

the norms that courts have traditionally applied in consumer-protection law”).
Defendants would have this Court not only ignore the plain statutory language and
the controlling least sophisticated consumer standard but also reverse decades of

7
8

federal consumer protection jurisprudence.

9

Illustrating the application of these principles in the context of Defendant Bull’s

10

statement is the Third Circuit opinion in Brown v. Card Service Center, supra. The

11

district court in Brown had dismissed for failure to state a claim under § 1692e a
12
13

complaint based on the collector's statement that "refusal to cooperate could result

14

in a legal suit being filed" and "could result in our forwarding this account to our

15

attorney." 464 F.3d at 451-52. The consumer had alleged that the statements were

16
17

false and misleading because the collector (CSC) in fact had no intention of taking

18

such action; nevertheless, the lower court agreed with the collector that it had said

19

nothing that as a matter of law was false or misleading. In reaching this conclusion,

20

the District Court emphasized that the CSC Letter employed the conditional term
21
22

"could" as opposed to the affirmative term "will" ... The District Court found the

23

CSC Letter in compliance with the FDCPA because it merely stated what CSC

24

could do, if it so chose. 464 F.3d at 454-55 (emphasis in original).

The Third Circuit reversed ''because we conclude that it would be deceptive
under the FDCPA for CSC to assert that it could take an action that it had no

conclusive immunity from liability under the FDCPA because of the literal truth of

7
8
9
10

Ms. Bull’s statement garnishment is part of the legal process, the Third Circuit also
rejected the same argument in the context of litigation. The Third Circuit
discounted the statement's literal truth for the simple and decisive reason that the

11

least sophisticated consumer "might get the impression that litigation or referral to
12
13

a CSC lawyer would" occur under the stated conditions. Id.
The Third Circuit cited two separate FDCPA tenets that support its ruling

14
15

and further confirm the district court's ruling here. First, federal courts have

16
17

developed "as a useful tool in analyzing the 'least-sophisticated consumer' test" for

18

a § 1692e violation the '''more than one reasonable interpretation' standard."

19

Kistner v. Law Offices of Michael P. Margelefsky, !LC, 518 F.3d 433,441 (6th Cir.

20

2008). This test holds that a "debt collection letter is deceptive where it can be
21
22

reasonably read to have two or more different meanings, one of which is

23

inaccurate." Brown v. Card Service Center, 464 F.3d at 455 (internal quote and

24

citation omitted); see also Russell v. Equijax A.R.S., 74 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 1996)

test and concluded that the conditional statement under review would be deceptive
if the plaintiff could prove that what the collector stated "could" happen in fact

3
4

"seldom" occurred. 464 F.3d at 455. The Third Circuit's use of the "more than one

5

reasonable interpretation" test to determine deception in an unexplained

6

conditional statement is equally befitting here and establishes Defendants’

7
8
9
10

violation since Defendants have conceded the complete inapplicability of
garnishment to any action that they could or intended to take at the time the treat
was made.

11

For additional support the Third Circuit in Brown [464 F.3d at 455-56] also
12
13

relied on the FTC's FDCPA Staff Commentary, which provides the following

14

specific guidance to debt collectors who make statements of conditional action:

15

A debt collector may not state or imply that he or any third party may
take any action unless such action is legal and there is a reasonable
likelihood, at the time the statement is made, that such action will be
taken. A debt collector may state that certain action is possible, if it is
true that such action is legal and is frequently taken by the collector or
creditor with respect to similar debts; however, if the debt collector
has reason to know there are facts that make the action unlikely in the
particular case, a statement that the action was possible would be
misleading. FTC Statements of General Policy or Interpretation Staff
Commentary on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 53 Fed. Reg.
50097-50110, § 807(5)- 3, at 50106 (Dec. 13, 1988) (emphasis

conditional action must be simply "unlikely." See also LeBlanc v. Unifund CCR
Partners, 601 F3d 1185, 1190 n.9 (11th Cir. 2010).

6

This Court's established jurisprudence protecting consumers from deceptive

7
8

practices under the FDCPA and otherwise, case law exemplified by the Third

9

Circuit's Brown opinion, the FTC Commentary's illustration of deception squarely

10

describing and condemning Defendants' misconduct here, and prevailing FDCP A

11

principles adopted by every circuit court in the country all dramatically compel a
12
13

finding that these Defendants violated the FDCPA. Even the common law would

14

command this result. See e.g. Smith v. Duffey, 576 F.3d 336, 338 (7th Cir. 2009)

15

(the common law imposes a "duty of candor" and disclosure even "in the absence

16

of any special relationship ... just because the defendant's silence would mislead

the plaintiff because of something else that the defendant had said").

CONCLUSION

20

Whether a debt collector has engaged in misrepresentation "is [] an excellent
21

candidate for summary judgment, as only pure questions of law are presented." Valdez

23

v. Hunt And Henriques, 2002 WL 433595, (N.D.Cal. March 19, 2002). The parties

24

agree that Ms. Bull told Ms. Braham that the Defendants were going to start the “legal

25

process” and then told Ms. Braham that garnishment is a part of the “legal process”.

Defendants couch their defense to this action on the sole basis that, despite the fact

2

that Ms. Braham was misled by Ms. Bull’s statements into believing that Defendants

3
4

were going to garnish her wages, Ms. Bull’s statements cannot violate the FDCPA

5

because they are technically true. Contrary to the Defendant’s assertion, however, the

Court’s only analysis is whether Ms. Bull’s statements would be misleading to the

least sophisticated debtor. It is. Accordingly, the Court should find that the

Defendants statements violated the FDCPA (15 USC §1692e) and the Plaintiff’s
