Cf.

SCOTT MILSAP, being first duly sworn on oath deposes and says:

1. Tam over the age of 18 and am competent to testify in court. I make

 

this declaration based on my own personal knowledge of the matters stated
herein.
2. lam the President of defendant Automated Accounts, Inc. Automated
Accounts is a Washington corporation with a principle place of business in the
City, and County of Spokane, and is a properly licensed collection agency under
the Laws of Washington State.

| 3. At Automated Accounts we have conducted a survey of our files where
we have commenced a lawsuit in the years if 2009, 2010 and 2011. A copy of
that summary report is attached. Our computer records do not provide a
statistical report of which of our judgments at some point proceeded to an
execution to collect on the judgment. My staff conducted a sampling of the cases
filed by randomly reviewing the litigation files and we have determined that in

approximately twenty five (25) percent of the files reviewed Automated Accounts

attempted to garnishment of wages or bank account funds.

4. Based upon the random sampling done we have estimated the number

of judgments that had garnishment that occurred within 90 days of obtaining
jud pment and the estimated number of garnishments that occurred after 90 days

pos judgment.

5. I believe this non-scientific analysis fairly represents that Automated

Accounts, Inc. regularly proceeds to litigation to collect on assignments received
and regularly proceeds to execute on those judgments by garnishment of wages or

bank account funds.

DATED this 24 day of January, 2012, signed at Spokane, Washington.

SCOTT MILSAP, President, Automated
Accounts, Inc.
