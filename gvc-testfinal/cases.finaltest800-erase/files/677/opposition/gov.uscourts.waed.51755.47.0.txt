I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Starla Braham contends defendant Automated Accounts, Inc.
("Automated Accounts") misled her in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act ("FDCPA"). She claims this occurred when Automated Accounts truthfully told
her it would being the process of legal action against her and, in response to Ms.

Braham's question, explained this process included garnishment. With her summary

judgment motion, Ms. Braham now claims defendants' statements violated the
FDCPA as a matter of law. Not so. Defendants' statements were true, accurate, and
not likely to mislead even the least sophisticated consumer into fearing imminent
garnishment. Nonetheless, Ms. Braham insists she was deceived into believing her
wages could be garnished at any moment. Defendants suggested no such thing.
Indeed, defendants described their intended actions as beginning a "legal process,"
explicitly acknowledging the time such action would take. As case law on the issue
establishes, Ms. Braham's assumption to the contrary was not reasonable under even
the "least sophisticated consumer" standard. Rather than granting summary judgment
for plaintiff, this Court should rule as a matter of law that defendants committed no
violation of the FDCPA.
Il. FACTS

Defendants have already presented the facts in papers filed with their own

summary judgment motion.' Defendants have also filed a statement of facts in

response to plaintiff's statement." For brevity's sake, defendants will not repeat those

accounts in their entirety. Ms. Braham's recitation of Ms. Bull's deposition
testimony, however, omits facts that merit inclusion here.

Importantly, for purposes of her motion, Ms. Braham relies solely on the facts
as stated by Ms. Bull. See Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment on the Issue of Defendants' Liability Under 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692
("Plaintiffs Memorandum"), pp. 5-6. The following, therefore, relies chiefly on
evidence offered by Ms. Bull.

Ms. Bull spoke to Ms. Braham on November 2, 2009. See Deposition of
Michelle Bull ("Bull Dep.,") 78:6-14.'; see also Affidavit of Michelle Bull in Support
of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment ("Bull Aff."'), dated December 16,
2011. Ms. Bull advised Ms. Braham she was behind in the agreed-upon payments on
her debt and advised Ms. Braham Automated Accounts would start its "legal process"
to collect Ms. Braham's debt. Bull Dep., 78:6-14; Bull Aff; Automated Accounts
begins its legal process by requesting assignment of the consumer's debt. Bull Dep.,
79:13-14. After speaking to Ms. Braham, Ms. Bull requested assignment of Ms.
Braham's debt the same day she advised Ms. Braham she would begin the legal

process-November 2, 2009. Bull Dep., 79: 15-24.

Case 2:10-cv-00385-EFS Document 47 Filed 01/20/12

During their conversation on November 2, 2009, Ms. Braham asked Ms. Bull if
garnishment was part of the legal process. Bull Dep., 81:7-21; Bull Aff, Ms. Bull
answered that she believed so. Jd. Ms. Braham brought up the subject of
garnishment--Ms. Bull did not. Bull Dep., 100:20-24; Bull Aff' Ms. Bull never, at
any time during the conversation, told Ms. Braham Automated Accounts was going
to garnish Ms. Braham's wages. Bull Dep., 101:21-102:4.

On November 2, 2009, after her last conversation with Ms. Bull, Ms. Braham
called Ms. Bull's supervisor, Mario Ruiz, while visiting the home of her friend,
Tamara Ramm. Bull Dep., 15:20-21; Affidavit of Mario Ruiz in Support of
Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment ("Ruiz Aff.") filed December 16, 2011.
As he spoke with Ms. Braham, Mr. Ruiz heard a loud male voice in the background
telling her that Automated Accounts could not garnish her wages without obtaining a
judgment first. Ruiz Aff It was apparent to Mr. Ruiz that the man in the background
on Ms. Braham's end of the conversation, whom Mr. Ruiz presumed to be Ms.
Braham's husband, Larry Braham, was coaching Ms. Braham. Ruiz Aff Mr. Ruiz
heard the man say to Ms. Braham that she had been consistent in making her
payments to Automated Accounts, that Automated Accounts had no right to mention
garnishment without a judgment in place, and that Ms. Braham knew she had 90 days

from any missed payment before legal action could commence against her. Ruiz Aff:

From what he heard, Mr. Ruiz believed Ms. Braham received correct information
about when garnishment could occur on that date from the man speaking to her in the
background. Ruiz Aff

Til. ARGUMENT

Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), a court should grant summary judgment if no
genuine issue of material fact exists. In considering such a motion, the court must
construe all facts in favor of the non-moving party. Mena v. City of Simi Valley, 226
F.3d 1031, 1042 n.3 (9" Cir. 2000); Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9" Cir.
1998).

For purposes of her summary judgment motion, Ms. Braham relies solely on
the facts as stated by Ms. Bull in her deposition. See Memorandum in Support of
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Issue of Defendants' Liability Under
IS US.C. 0x00A7 1692 ("Plaintiff's Memorandum"), pp. 5-6. As the Court knows,
defendants have made their own motion contending the Court should grant summary
judgment in defendants' favor on all claims.' Relying on Ms. Bull's testimony and
construing it in defendants' favor underscores the propriety of denying plaintiff's

motion and granting defendants' motion.

Case 2:10-cv-00385-EFS Document 47 Filed 01/20/12

A. The Least Sophisticated Consumer Standard Is Objective and Presumes a

Basic Level of Understanding and Reasonableness on the Part of the
Debtor.

Ms. Braham correctly notes that the "least sophisticated consumer" standard
governs the issue of whether a defendant violated the FDCPA. Despite setting a low
bar, however, this standard presumes a basic level of reasonableness on the debtor's
part.

The "least sophisticated debtor" standard is "lower than simply examining

whether particular language would deceive or mislead a reasonable

debtor."...At the same time, the standard "preserv[es] a quotient of
reasonableness and presum[es] a basic level of understanding and willingness
to read with care."...The FDCPA does not subject debt collectors to liability
for "bizarre," "idiosyncratic," or "peculiar" misinterpretations.
Gonzales v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 660 F.3d 1055, 1061-62 (9" Cir. 2011)
(citations omitted; emphasis added). Also, the standard is objective; it does not
depend on the individual debtor's subjective understanding. Donohue v. Quick
Collect, Inc., 592 F.3d 1027, 1033 (9 Cir. 2010). A court applying the standard asks
whether a statement would likely deceive the "hypothetical" least sophisticated
consumer. Wade v. Regional Credit Association, 87 F.3d 1098, 1100 (9" Cir. 1996)
(affirming District Court's rejection of FDCPA claim where written notice contained

no false information). The question, therefore, is not whether Ms. Braham was

actually deceived, but whether a hypothetical "least sophisticated consumer" would

mislead the least sophisticated consumer.0x00B0
B. Defendants' Statements Were Not Likely to Deceive or Mislead the Least

Sophisticated Consumer and Thus Did Not Violate 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692e(4),
1692e(5), or 1692e(10) as a Matter of Law.

Section 1692e of the FDCPA prohibits a debt collector from making
representations or threatening actions the debt collector a) cannot legally take and b)

does not intend to take. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692e.' Conversely, a debt collector's

above in "Facts" section..
0x00B0 Plaintiff suggests defendants rely on the "literal truth" of their statements to Ms. Braham as a defense to her claims.
See Plaintiff's Memorandum, p. 14. That is not true. While defendants do maintain their statements to plaintiff were
true, the remainder of this memorandum demonstrates that defendants' statements were not only true, but were also not
likely to mislead the least sophisticated consumer.
' The relevant subsections provide:

A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the

collection of any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a

violation of this section:...
(4) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of
any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such

action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take such action.

(5) The threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.

representation does not violate these sections if the debt collector a) can legally take
the action and b) intends to do so. Id.

Statements like those made by Automated Accounts in this case do not, as a
matter of law, constitute violations of the FDCPA. A debt collector may legally seek
such remedies as garnishment, seizure, or attachment of property to collect a debt.
See, e.g., Shuler v. Ingram & Associates, et al., 710 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1224-25 (N.D.
Ala. 2010); aff'd, _ F. Supp.3d__, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 19897 (1 1" Cir. 2011)
(granting summary judgment for defendant on plaintiff's FDCPA claims). In Shuler,
defendant Ingram & Associates ("Ingram") made motion for summary judgment. For
purposes of that motion, the court accepted as true the plaintiffs allegation that
Ingram told plaintiff, "if we go forward, there will be a lien on your property and we
will garnish your wages, 25% of disposable income." Shuler, 710 F. Supp. 2d at
1218-19. The court found that Ingram was legally entitled to take those actions even
though it never filed a lawsuit against plaintiff. The court explained:

...Ingram, as a debt collection law firm, is legally entitled to seek the seizure,

garnishment, or attachment of the property or wages of Roger Shuler to collect
on the American Express debt. The statements that Ingram may place a lien on

obtain information concerning a consumer.

plaintiffs' property, garnish Shuler's wages, that Ingram prosecutes debts like
his, and always wins since the debt is owed, (doc. 61 at 7-10), do not constitute
threats or actions that Ingram could not or did not intend to take. Rather, the
statements placed plaintiffs on notice of options legally available to Ingram.

Shuler, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 1224-25 (footnote omitted).(R) Moreover, defendants fully
intended to begin the legal process as they stated. The fact that no lawsuit was filed
did not disprove Ingram's intent to take legal action. A debt collector's statement
that it intends to take legal action can establish a reasonable likelihood that it intends
to do so.

Finally, plaintiffs miss the mark when they contend that Ingram's failure to file
a lawsuit establishes that it never intended to file a lawsuit and therefore
violated 0x00A70x00A7 1692e(4) and (5). There is no provision in 0x00A7 1692e that states that
filing a lawsuit is the on/y way for a debt collector to establish that it actually
intended to file a lawsuit. To the contrary, because Ingram is a law firm
specializing in collections,...a reasonable likelihood existed that Ingram would
indeed sue to collect the debt when it so stated to plaintiffs. That Ingram (or
more likely, American Express) has not yet elected, or may have decided not,
to sue does not create a material dispute. Ingram's actions here are not akin to
those in Jeter in which the creditor represented that it would sue in five days if
the plaintiff failed to respond. 760 F.2d at 1175-76. Moreover, unlike Jeter,
plaintiffs here have not presented any evidence showing that Ingram never sues
debtors or sues only in extremely rare situations -- both of which factored in
the Jeter court's decision. /d. at 1176-77. Plaintiffs' failure to present this type
of evidence is not surprising since Ingram is, after all, a collection law firm.
Since NCO transferred Shuler's account to Ingram after it could not collect, a
reasonable likelihood existed that Ingram indeed intended to sue at the time it

 

(R) The fact that Ingram is a debt collection law firm and Automated Accounts is not does not meaningfully distinguish
Shuler from this case. Both are debt collectors under the FDCPA, and like any debt collector, Automated Accounts can,
and sometimes does, initiate legal action to collect debts. It began that process in this case, when Ms. Bull sought client

records and obtained an assignment.

made the statements at issue. Accordingly, summary judgment is warranted on
plaintiffs' 0x00A70x00A7 1692e(4) and (5) claims.

Shuler, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 1225.

Plaintiff makes much of the fact that no judgment existed at the time of Ms.
Braham's November 2009 conversation with Ms. Bull. That is irrelevant unless the
debt collector threatens imminent legal action. Shuler, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 1225. For
instance, Shuler distinguishes itself from a case in which a creditor threatened to sue
the plaintiff within five days:

That Ingram (or more likely, American Express) has not yet elected, or may
have decided not, to sue does not create a material dispute. Ingram's actions
here are not akin to those in Jeter in which the creditor represented that it
would sue in five days if the plaintiff failed to respond.).

Id. Indeed, plaintiff's own authority concedes that the imminence of a garnishment
threat is what makes it an "action that cannot legally be taken" and therefore a

FDCPA violation.

It is undisputed that Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiffs on March 20
threatening to garnish their wages. It is further undisputed that Defendant did
not have a judgment or other legal justification by which to do this. This
statement therefore violated the FDCPA by threatening action which cannot
legally be taken. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692e(4)-(5). Though garnishment of wages is
certainly legal, it is important to note that Defendant did not threaten
garnishment at some unknown future date, but rather, after ten days. Doc. 18-
5. Since Defendant did not have a judgment at that time and could not have
reasonably obtained one within ten days, this was action that could not legally

be taken.
