No. 92-872C
(Senior Judge Smith)

DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
ENTRY OF PARTIAL FINAL JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $55,028,000
Defendant, the United States, respectfully submits this opposition to the motion for entry
of partial final judgment in the amount of $55,028,000 filed by plaintiffs, American Savings
Bank, F.A., Keystone Holdings, Inc., Keystone Holdings Partners, L.P., N.A., Capital Holdings,
Inc., New American Capital, Inc., and New American Holdings, Inc. (collectively “plaintiffs”).
See Pl. Mot. Entry of Partial Final Judg. (June 20, 2008) (“Pl. Mot.”). Although the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed $55,028,000 as damages for breach of
the Note Forbearance, this is not sufficient grounds for partial final judgment at this stage.
Plaintiffs’ potential damages theory for breach of the Warrant Forbearance arises from the same
indivisible transaction as the Note Forbearance. We thus respectfully request that the Court defer
entry of final judgment with respect to the breach of the Note Forbearance until the Court has
resolved plaintiffs’ damages theory, if any, for breach of the Warrant Forbearance.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs filed suit in this Court alleging a breach of contract arising from the enactment
of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”),

Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (Aug. 9, 1989) §§ 211, 401(a)(1). On December 18, 2006, the
Court, upon summary judgment, found the Government liable and awarded plaintiffs
$55,028,000 in expectancy damages for breach of the Note Forbearance. Am. Sav. Bank v.
United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 756, 762 (2006). The Court also awarded plaintiffs $346,506,000 as
partial restitution for breach of the Warrant Forbearance. Am. Sav. Bank v. United States, 62
Fed. Cl. 6, 14-19 (2004); Am. Sav., 74 Fed. Cl. at 761.
Plaintiffs requested that the Court enter final judgment, rather than partial judgment
pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (“RCFC”). See
Pl. Mot. Final Judg. (Jan. 4, 2005). The Court granted plaintiffs’ request. Am. Sav., 74 Fed. Cl.
at 762. Moreover, at oral argument upon appeal, plaintiffs’ counsel stated that all claims had
been “merged into the final judgment,” and that plaintiffs “stipulated to the entry of final
judgment on all claims.” Oral Argument (Dec. 7, 2007) at 22-23 (attached as Exhibit A).
Upon appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded the
Court’s decision. Am. Sav. Bank v. United States, 519 F.3d 1316, 1324-28 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
The Federal Circuit affirmed this Court’s findings regarding liability and the award of
$55,028,000 for breach of the Note Forbearance, but reversed the Court’s $346,506,000 partial
restitution award on the grounds that the Warrant Forbearance was not divisible from the rest of
the transaction. The Federal Circuit held that, “[b]ecause the Court of Federal Claims incorrectly
found the contract divisible and awarded partial restitution on that basis, we reverse the trial
court's award of partial restitution relating to the Warrant Forbearance and remand for the trial
court to determine if damages, as opposed to partial restitution, are proper under another theory.”
Id. at 1328.

On June 20, 2008, the Federal Circuit denied our motion for rehearing with respect to the
breach of the Note Forbearance. Also on June 20, 2008, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that
the Court enter partial final judgment for the $55,028,000 for the breach of the Note Forbearance.
The mandate from the Federal Circuit issued on June 27, 2008.1 This response follows.
ARGUMENT
The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ request that the Court enter a $55,028,000 partial, final
judgment for plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ request conflicts with this Court’s standards for entry of
partial final judgment, which require that the remaining claim not share the same core operative
facts as the claim for which partial final judgment is sought. The breach of the Note Forbearance
and Warrant Forbearance arises from the same indivisible transaction. Indeed, it was this
indivisibility that caused the Federal Circuit to reverse this Court’s grant of partial restitution for
the Warrant Forbearance. Furthermore, plaintiffs have yet to present their damages theory, if
any, with respect to the Warrant Forbearance upon remand, so the elements of proof for both
damages theories could be intertwined. Indeed, if the Court concludes plaintiffs are not entitled
to further recovery, the judgment need not be rendered piecemeal, as plaintiffs suggest. Thus, the
Court should deny entry of final judgment with respect to the Note Forbearance as premature
until such time as the Court has resolved the related Warrant Forbearance.
A.

Plaintiffs Have Not Satisfied This Court’s Standards For Final Judgment

Payments of judgments against the United States may only be made with respect to
“final” judgments, partial or otherwise. 28 U.S.C. § 2517; see also 31 U.S.C. § 1304 (requiring
1

Because plaintiffs filed their motion before the Federal Circuit’s mandate, this Court did not
possess jurisdiction to consider plaintiff’s motion when it was filed. Moreover, the Court had not
conducted a status conference or established any schedule for further proceedings at the time of
filing. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss plaintiffs’ motion and require refiling.

“final judgment” for payment from Judgment Fund).2 Accordingly, any partial final judgment
must be entered pursuant to RCFC 54(b), which governs “Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or
Involving Multiple Parties.” RCFC 54(b) provides that, “[w]hen an action presents more than
one claim for relief . . . the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but
fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason
for delay . . . .” RCFC 54(b). Thus, the Court may enter partial, final judgment only if the Court
concludes that the breach of the Note Forbearance is a separate “claim” from the breach of the
Warrant Forbearance for the purposes of RCFC 54(b).
The Court should conclude that, although the Note Forbearance and Warrant Forbearance
involve different amounts of capital, they are not separate “claims” for the purposes of RCFC
54(b). Both forbearances arose from the same core operative facts, came from the same
indivisible transaction, and were affected by the same breach on the same date. Thus, under
RCFC 54(b), the Note Forbearance and Warrant Forbearance are not separate “claims” that
would make entry of partial final judgment appropriate.
In Adams v. United States, 51 Fed. Cl. 57, 59 (2001), this Court considered the standards
applicable for the entry of partial final judgment pursuant to RCFC 54(b). In Adams, the Court
concluded that four factors were relevant for determining whether multiple or separate claims are
present, and that would thus permit entry of a partial, final judgment under RCFC 54(b):

Although 31 U.S.C. § 1304 concerns payments from the Judgment Fund, payment of
Winstar-related judgments are drawn from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
(“FSLIC”) Resolution Fund. Appropriate Source for Payment of Judgments in United States v.
Winstar Corp. And Related Cases, 1998 WL 1180050 (O.L.G.) (July 22, 1998). Nevertheless,
both 31 U.S.C. § 1304 and 28 U.S.C. § 2517 concern the payment of judgments against the
United States and require that payments be made only for “final” judgments.

(1) The extent of factual overlap; (2) whether separate causes of
action depend upon proof of different facts or have different
burdens of proof; (3) whether the application of res judicata
considerations suggest that the claims are linked; and (4) whether
the multiple relief is for the same injury.
Adams, 51 Fed. Cl. at 59.
All four Adams factors indicate that the Note Forbearance award for which plaintiffs seek
partial final judgment and the reversed award with respect to the Warrant Forbearance are not
separate claims under Rule 54(b).
First, the extent of factual overlap between the Note Forbearance award and Warrant
Forbearance could not be greater. Both claims arise from the same contract, involve the same
thrift, and were found to have been breached by FIRREA. Both claims arise out of the same
facts concerning American Savings’ capital, assets, and liabilities. Indeed, it was this very
overlap that caused the Federal Circuit to conclude that the Warrant Forbearance was not
divisible from the rest of the American Savings transaction, including the Note Forbearance.
Am. Sav., 519 F.3d at 1328.
This factual overlap makes the entry of partial judgment here all the more inappropriate
because the Court has not yet considered what claims, if any, remain to be resolved. Certainly, if
the Court should conclude that all of plaintiffs’ claims have been fully adjudicated, then there is
no need for the Court to issue a partial judgment. Conversely, if the Court permits plaintiffs to
assert a new measure of damages regarding the Warrant Forbearance, the nature of that theory
will affect the plaintiffs’ request for partial judgment.
To the extent that plaintiffs’ yet-to-be-determined Warrant Forbearance damages theory
shares factual underpinnings with their damages theory for breach of the Note Forbearance, entry

of partial final judgment may prejudice our ability to respond to plaintiffs’ new theories. This
would be particularly true if plaintiffs advance some form of expectancy damages theory for the
Warrant Forbearance, as they did for the Note Forbearance. This uncertainty regarding the
possible damages theories weighs against entry of partial, final judgment.
The second factor enunciated by this Court in Adams also counsels against the
recognition of a separate claim for the purposes of RCFC 54(b). The request for relief regarding
the Note Forbearance arises from precisely the same “cause of action” as the Warrant
Forbearance, i.e., the breach of contract caused by FIRREA. The requests for relief arise from
the same set of operative facts, i.e., the American Savings transaction and the subsequent breach.
Despite involving different amounts of capital, the Note Forbearance and Warrant Forbearance
are not separate claims for the purposes of Rule 54(b). Thus, final judgment should await
resolution of all claims relating to that same core of operative facts.
The third Adams factor also fails to support plaintiffs’ position. Res judicata applies with
respect to a request for relief if it arises “with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or a
series of connected transactions, out of which [an earlier] action arose.” Adams, 51 Fed. Cl. at
59-60 (quoting Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. United States, 688 F.2d 765, 769 (Fed. Cir.
1982)). Given the shared core operative facts, res judicata would not permit the litigation of the
issues surrounding the breach of the Warrant Forbearance after final judgment for the Note
Forbearance. Indeed, under res judicata principles, entry of final judgment with respect to the
Note Forbearance would bar any further relief “with respect to all or any part of the transaction.”
Adams, 51 Fed. Cl. at 60. In other words, any damages theory plaintiffs might advance with

6

Case 1:92-cv-00872-LAS

Document 341

Filed 07/14/2008

Page 7 of 12

respect to the Warrant Forbearance would be barred by the final judgment for the Note
Forbearance, which was the same “claim” for the purposes of res judicata.
The final factor also contradicts plaintiffs’ position. The same injury – the Government’s
alleged breach of contract – comprises the bases for plaintiffs’ damages theories for both
forbearances. Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they seek a partial judgment for a
separate claim, and they are accordingly not entitled to a partial judgment under RCFC 54(b) or
any other Rule or provision of the law.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Arguments Are Unavailing

Plaintiffs do not identify the standard they must satisfy to be entitled to partial final
judgment, stating only in conclusory terms that, “nothing this Court decides with regards to the
remanded issue will affect the affirmed portion of judgment that Plaintiffs now seek to enforce.”
Pl. Mot. at 6. When the factors set forth in Adams are considered, it is evident the plaintiffs are
not entitled to partial final judgment because they have not established the existence of separate
claims. Contrary to plaintiffs’ argument, the determination of whether partial final judgment is
appropriate does not depend upon whether any other developments could affect the award for the
Note Forbearance. Rather, the Court must determine whether partial, final judgment for the Note
Forbearance could affect any still-undefined damages theory for the Warrant Forbearance.
In support of their motion, plaintiffs rely upon the Federal Circuit’s decision in King
Instrument Corp. v. Otari Corp., 814 F.2d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1987), and this Court’s decisions in
Home Savings of America v. United States, 69 Fed. Cl. 187, 190 (2005) and National Australia
Bank v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 435, 437-38 (2006). Pl. Mot. at 6-9. None of these cases
supports plaintiffs’ claim for partial final judgment in this case.

In King, the Federal Circuit considered this Court’s entry of partial final judgment with
respect to one category of damages for patent infringement. The plaintiffs in King claimed two
forms of damages for the infringement of the patent: machine damages and lost profits from the
sale of spare parts. The Federal Circuit had earlier affirmed this Court’s award for machine
damages, bur remanded the lost profits claim for further consideration. This Court entered
partial final judgment for the machine damages claim, which the Federal Circuit affirmed. King,
814 F.2d at 1561-62.
Here, unlike King, plaintiffs have not advanced two separate forms of damages. Instead,
there is one breach that affected two amounts of capital, the Note Forbearance and Warrant
Forbearance. Although these are separate amounts of capital, the type of injury, i.e., the loss of
the ability to count the capital toward the thrift’s regulatory capital requirements, is identical. By
contrast, in King, the machine damages and lost profits were different forms of damage that
involved different actions at different times. Thus, King does not support plaintiffs’ claim.
Similarly, in Home Savings, this Court only granted partial, final judgment after
determining that there was “no possibility of conflict” between the Federal Circuit’s award of
damages and the remaining claim upon remand. Home Sav., 69 Fed. Cl. at 192. The Court
based this finding, in part, upon the fact that there were two different sets of transactions
involved: the transactions for Federally-insured thrift, and state-insured thrifts. The Court,
moreover, reached this conclusion only after both theories of damages were identified in detail.
The Federal Circuit affirmed the trial court’s award with respect to the Federally-insured thrift,
but remanded for consideration of damages for the state-insured thrifts. Home Sav. of Am. v.
United States, 399 F.3d 1341, 1357-58 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

In Home Savings, as in King, there were separate transactions and facts separating the
two awards. In both cases, the trial courts knew the precise nature of the damage claims that
remained to be adjudicated. In this case, however, there was only one transaction, with two
different amounts of capital represented by the Note Forbearance and Warrant Forbearance.
Also, any recovery for the Warrant Forbearance would be based upon an undisclosed theory.
Furthermore, the Court in Home Savings noted that the procedures it employed are
intended to accomplish the same purposes as RCFC 54(b). Home Savings, 69 Fed. Cl. at 189
n.2. Accordingly, the Adams factors remain relevant under Home Savings. As we have
demonstrated above, the Note Forbearance and Warrant Forbearance share a common core of
operative facts, making partial final judgment inappropriate. Home Savings therefore does not
weigh in favor of partial final judgment.
Moreover, in National Australia, this Court denied entry of partial, final judgment where
the Federal Circuit had not affirmed a “definitive award quantum” and the plaintiffs did not
advance “segregable categories of damages.” Nat’l Australia, 74 Fed. Cl. at 439. Plaintiffs, at
most, have met the first of these criteria, but not the second. Plaintiffs assert that their Warrant
Forbearance damages are “segregable” from the Note Forbearance because any damages upon
remand “will only increase Plaintiffs’ damages award.” Pl. Mot. at 9. This is not the proper
analysis. Here, the two forbearances represent different amounts of capital, but the damages
calculations for both arise from the same core operative facts. Also, as noted above, we do not
know plaintiffs’ damages theory for the Warrant Forbearance, if any. Thus, judgment with
respect to the Note Forbearance could complicate, or foreclose, the calculation of any additional
damages with respect to the Warrant Forbearance.

Furthermore, in National Australia, the Court found that, “[h]ere, there was only one
transaction, and ultimately, there will only be one correct calculation of damages. An appeal
from a partial judgment would thus unavoidably duplicate both liability and damages issues in
the event of a subsequent appeal of the final judgment. Both judgments would arise out of a
single indivisible transaction.” Id. Here, both the Note Forbearance and Warrant Forbearance
“arise out of a single indivisible transaction.” Id. Indeed, it was this very indivisibility that
resulted in the Federal Circuit’s reversal of this Court’s earlier grant of partial restitution. Am.
Sav., 519 F.3d at 1328. Thus, as in National Australia, this Court should defer entry of final
judgment until all damages claims arising from the same “indivisible transaction” have been
resolved.
Finally, judicial economy militates against subdivision of the components of plaintiffs’
damages awards at this time. Plaintiffs will soon unveil whatever damages theory they present
for the breach of the Warrant Forbearance. After they do so, this Court will likely decide shortly
what further proceedings are necessary. Accordingly, the Court’s long-standing practice of not
subdividing cases for separate treatment of individual issues should prevail. Indeed, there is no
reason to set a precedent in this case that could lead to extensive motions practice and procedural
disputes regarding the finality of parts of judgments in other cases.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the Court deny plaintiffs’ motion
for partial final judgment.
