NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION

2

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Defendants Jiangxi LDK Solar, Xingxue Tong, Qiqiang

3

Yao, Liangbao Zhu, Yonggang Shao, and Gang Wang (collectively, the “Non-Speaking

4

Defendants”) hereby move to dismiss this action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2)

5

and 12(b)(6). The Motion is scheduled to be heard at 8:00 a.m. on August 28, 2008, in the

6

courtroom of the Honorable William H. Alsup, in the United States District Court for the

7

Northern District of California, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California. The Non-

8

Speaking Defendants request that all claims asserted in Lead Plaintiff’s Consolidated Class

9

Action Complaint be dismissed with prejudice.

10

STATEMENT OF ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

11

1. Whether the Court has personal jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking Defendants, all of

12

whom are domiciled or reside in the People’s Republic of China and have no

13

meaningful “contacts” with the United States.

14

2. Whether the federal securities claims asserted against the Non-Speaking Defendants

15

should be dismissed for failure to meet the heightened pleading standards under the

16

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Without identifying any specific false statements made by Defendants Jiangxi LDK

20

Solar, Xingxue Tong, Qiqiang Yao, Liangbao Zhu, Yonggang Shao, and Gang Wang

21

(collectively “Non-Speaking Defendants”), the Consolidated Class Action Complaint

22

(“Complaint”) alleges that the Non-Speaking Defendants violated federal securities laws by

23

overstating LDK’s polysilicon inventory. In addition to the grounds asserted by Defendants

24

LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (“LDK”), LDK Solar USA, Xiaofeng Peng, and Jack Lai’s motion to

25

dismiss (see DE #68), the clams against the Non-Speaking Defendants should be dismissed for

26

failure to plead personal jurisdiction and failure to identify any specific false statements to the

27

Non-Speaking Defendants.

28
ATTORNEYS AT LAW

First, Plaintiff’s claims against the Non-Speaking Defendants should be dismissed for

1

lack of personal jurisdiction. None of the Non-Speaking Defendants reside in the United States

2

or otherwise satisfy the “minimum contacts” requirements under the Due Process Clause of the

3

Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition, Plaintiff cannot allege

4

that the Non-Speaking Defendants committed or directed any conduct at residents in the United

5

States. As a result, this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking Defendants.

6

Moreover, the 10(b) and 20(a) claims against the Non-Speaking Defendants should be

7

dismissed because Plaintiff cannot attribute any false or misleading statements to any of the Non-

8

Speaking Defendants. The PSLRA requires Plaintiff to specify with particularity the false or

9

misleading statements or omissions attributable to each of the Non-Speaking Defendants. The

10

PSLRA also requires Plaintiffs to plead a “strong inference of scienter” against each individual

11

defendant. However, the Complaint relies solely on boilerplate and conclusory allegations that

12

as a group, the Non-Speaking Defendants made, approved or adopted numerous false statements

13

and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced in the dissemination of false and

14

misleading statements. These conclusory allegations fall far short of the requirements of the

15

PSLRA and should therefore be dismissed.

16

II.

17

STATEMENTS OF FACTS
The facts of this case were extensively documented in the Statement of Facts contained in

18

the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Lead Plaintiff’s Consolidated Class Action Complaint

19

Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and the Court’s May 29, 2008 Order Denying Defendants’ Motion to

20

Dismiss. Accordingly, the Non-Speaking Defendants will only address those facts necessary to

21

the disposition of this motion.

22

Based solely on the allegations of a disgruntled former employee, Charley Situ, the

23

Complaint alleges that Defendants LDK Solar and various officers and directors of LDK

24

(collectively “Defendants”) fraudulently overstated LDK’s polysilicon inventory in violation of

25

federal securities laws. While the Complaint attributes various misstatements to defendants

26

Xiaofeng Peng, LDK’s Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Lai, LDK’s Executive Vice President

27

and Chief Financial Officer, the Complaint is entirely devoid of any allegations that the Non-

28

Speaking Defendants made any allegedly false statements or knew that any statement was

allegedly false when made. Without any specific allegations of false statements, Plaintiff seeks

2

liability against the Non-Speaking Defendants based on nothing but boilerplate language that is

3

not supported by any factual basis:
[D]efendants acted with scienter in that they knew that the public documents and
statements issued or disseminated in the name of the Company were materially
false or misleading; knew that such statements would be issued or disseminated to
the investing public; and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced
in the issuance or dissemination of such statements or documents as primary
violators of the federal securities laws.

ARGUMENT
A.

There Is No Personal Jurisdiction Over the Non-Speaking Defendants
1.

Plaintiff Bears The Burden of Establishing Personal Jurisdiction

Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking

23

Defendants. See Doe v. Unocal Corp., 248 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir. 2001) (“It is plaintiff’s

24

burden to establish the Court’s personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”). In order to withstand a

25

motion to dismiss, Plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of the facts upon which

26

jurisdiction is predicated. See Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 800

27

(9th Cir. 2004). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment permits this Court to

28

exercise jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking Defendants only where “there exists ‘minimum

contacts’ between the defendant and the forum state.” World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

2

Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291 (1980). The “minimum contacts” rule prevents a defendant from

3

being forced to litigate in a jurisdiction where he has no meaningful contacts. Indeed, as the

4

Supreme Court noted in World-Wide Volkswagen:
Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience
from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State . .
. even if the forum State is the most convenient location for
litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of
interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its
power to render a valid judgment.

There are two types of personal jurisdiction: general and specific. See Reebok
10
International, Ltd. v. McLaughlin, 49 F.3d 1387, 1391 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S.
11
908, 116 S.Ct. 276, 133 L.Ed.2d 197 (1995). The Court may only exercise general jurisdiction if
12
a defendant’s contacts with the United States are “substantial” or “systematic and continuous.”
13
See Data Disc., Inc. v. Systems Tech. Assocs., Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1287 (9th Cir. 1977). In the
14
absence of general jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction is only appropriate if the quality and nature
15
of the defendant’s activity in relation to the particular cause of action justifies specific
16
jurisdiction over that defendant. See Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 802.
17
As detailed below, Plaintiff fails to meet his burden of demonstrating the requisite criteria
18
for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking Defendants.

Plaintiff Fails to Establish General Jurisdiction

20
The standard for establishing general jurisdiction is “‘fairly high,’ and requires that the
21
defendant’s contacts be of the sort that approximate physical presence.” Bancroft & Masters v.
22
Augusta Nat’l, 223 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. Cal. 2000). “This is an exacting standard, as it
23
should be, because a finding of general jurisdiction permits a defendant to be haled into court in
24
the forum state to answer for any of its activities anywhere in the world.” Schwarzenegger, 374
25
F.3d at 801. In Bancroft, the Ninth Circuit noted that in determining whether general jurisdiction
26
exists, the “[f]actors to be taken into consideration are whether the defendant makes sales,
27
solicits or engages in business in the state, serves the state’s markets, designates an agent for

Plaintiff does not come close to meeting this high standard for the Non-Speaking Defendants.

Jiangxi does not have agents for service of process in the United States. Id. ¶ 5. In the absence of

17

some of the Non-Speaking Defendants have traveled to the United States, their trips to the

18

United States are insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. See Core-Vent Corp. v. Nobel

19

Indus. AB, 11 F.3d 1482, 1490 (9th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted) (finding that

20

Swedish defendant’s five visits to California over the course of four years was insufficient to

21

establish general jurisdiction because a “[defendant] cannot be haled into a jurisdiction as a result

22

of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.”).

23

Simply stated, none of the Non-Speaking Defendants have ever submitted to the personal

24

jurisdiction of United States courts or otherwise sought the benefits of United States residency

specific personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant:
(1)
The non-resident defendant must purposefully direct his
activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or
resident thereof; or perform some act by which he purposefully
avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the
forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws;

Plaintiff Has Not Established “Purposeful Availment.”

A defendant purposefully avails himself of a forum when he “purposefully directs” his

15
16

activities at the residents of that forum. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472-73

17

(1985). A showing that a defendant “purposefully availed” itself to the privilege of doing

18

business in a forum “typically consists of evidence of the defendant’s actions in the forum, such

19

as executing or performing a contract there.” Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 802 (emphasis

20

added).

21

Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege that any of the Non-Speaking Defendants

22

purposefully availed themselves or directed any activities at residents in the United States. In

23

fact, the Complaint does not contain a single allegation that the Non-Speaking Defendants

24

engaged in any specific activity in the United States. Plaintiff does not, and cannot, provide

25

evidence of such specific activities for one reason: the Non-Speaking Defendants have taken no

26

action to purposefully avail themselves of any forum in the United States. As noted, none of the

27

Non-Speaking Defendants have any contacts or have otherwise availed themselves of the

28

benefits of United States residency and law.

Moreover, Plaintiff’s cursory argument that the Non-Speaking Defendants purposefully

2

directed conduct towards United States residents from outside the forum by signing, approving

3

and causing the distribution of LDK’s May 2007 F-1 fails as a matter of law. While specific

4

jurisdiction may be based on acts occurring outside the United States, there must be evidence

5

that the defendant: “(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3)

6

causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.” Yahoo! Inc.

7

v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L’ Antisemittisme, 433 F.3d 1119, 1206 (9th Cir. 2006).

8

Here, Plaintiff fails even to allege, let alone provide evidence, that the Non-Speaking Defendants

9

“expressly aimed” any conduct alleged in the Complaint at residents in the United States.

10

Indeed, the mere foreseeability that LDK’s May 2007 F-1 would have an effect in the

11

United States or that some stockholders reside in the United States, is insufficient to confer

12

personal jurisdiction if the alleged illicit actions did not specifically target the United States. In

13

In re Astrazeneca Sec. Litig., No. 05 Civ. 2688(TPG), 2008 WL 2332325 * 13 (S.D.N.Y. June 3,

14

2008), the Court dismissed claims for lack of personal jurisdiction against two foreign

15

defendants who were alleged to have “caused the distribution of false and misleading reports and

16

statements to [ ] investors in the U.S.” and “had actual knowledge that each of the

17

representations alleged . . . were materially false or misleading. . . .” Id. at * 13. The Court held

18

that plaintiff’s allegations were “applicable to all individual defendants as a result of their

19

positions within the company[,]” and therefore, “such conclusory allegations of participation in

20

the fraud are insufficient” for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction. Id.

21

The Court in Astrazeneca further denied plaintiff’s request for leave to amend the

22

complaint, based on plaintiff’s proposed amendment that the foreign defendants signed the

23

company’s F-3, an SEC filing that was incorporated into the Company’s 20-F. Id. The Court

24

concluded that “[t]his signing, undoubtedly in a foreign country, is insufficient for personal

25

jurisdiction in this case.” Id. ; see also In re Wireless Facilities, Inc. Deriv. Litig., No.

26

04CV1663 JAH (NLS), 2008 WL 2521748, * 6 fn. 5 (S.D. Cal. February 26, 2008), (allegations

27

1

Plaintiff’s allegations against the Non-Speaking Defendants based on their signing a single SEC

2

filing while abroad are wholly insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the Non-

3

Speaking Defendants.

4

Moreover, LDK’s contacts with the United States, no matter how pervasive, have no

5

bearing on whether the Non-Speaking Defendants purposefully availed themselves. See Calder

6

v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 790 (U.S. 1984) ). Rather “each defendant’s contacts . . . must be

7

assessed individually” and “are not to be judged according to their employer’s activities there.”

8

Id. “A court does not have jurisdiction over individual officers and employees of a corporation

9

just because the court has jurisdiction over the corporation . . . . Personal jurisdiction over

10

officers of a corporation in their individual capacities must be based on their personal contacts

11

with the forum, not their acts and contacts carried out solely in a corporate capacity.” See LeDuc

12

v. Kentucky Cent. Life Ins. Co., 814 F. Supp. 820, 825 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (finding no personal

13

jurisdiction over officers and directors even though general personal jurisdiction existed over the

14

company itself). As such, LDK’s activities and maintenance of an office in the United States are

15

irrelevant to the inquiry into whether personal jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking Defendants is

16

proper.

18
19

b.

Plaintiff’s Alleged Claims Do Not “Arise Out Of” Or “Relate To”
The Non-Speaking Defendants’ Activities In The United States.

The Court also lacks jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking Defendants because Plaintiff has

20

failed to allege that any of his claims “arise out of” or “relate to” any activity undertaken by the

21

Non-Speaking Defendants in the United States. As an initial matter, Plaintiff fails to allege or

22

identify any specific activities from which his claims against the Non-Speaking Defendants

23

could spring. Nor does the Complaint allege any specific acts or omissions undertaken on the

24

part of any single individual defendant in the United States. Because each individual defendant’s

25

activities must be assessed independently for purposes of establishing jurisdiction, Plaintiff’s

26

“group pleading” make such individual assessment impossible. See Calder, 465 U.S. at 790.

Plaintiff’s Section 10(b) Claims Against the Non-Speaking Defendants Fail As a
Matter of Law
1.
The Complaint Fails to Attribute Any False Or Misleading Statement To
Any of the Non-Speaking Defendants

To state a claim under Section 10(b), Plaintiff must allege that, in connection with the

10

ATTORNEYS AT LAW

Document 108

purchase or sale of securities, (1) a material misrepresentation or omission of fact, (2) made with
scienter, (3) on which plaintiffs relied, (4) that proximately caused plaintiff’s economic loss.
Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005). Under the heightened
pleading standards of the PSLRA, Plaintiff must specify with particularity a false or misleading
statement or omission attributable to each defendant. See Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v.
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 761, 768 (2008); see also In re Int’l Rectifier Corp. Secs.
Litig., No. CV 07-02544-JFW (VBKx), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44872, *32-36 (C.D. Cal. May
23, 2008), (noting that “courts since Stoneridge have continued to dismiss actors (including
insiders) who have not made any misleading statements, either explicitly or implicitly because
plaintiffs could not prove reliance on their actions”); In re Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Sec. Litig.,
548 F. Supp. 2d 1126 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (dismissing 10(b)claims against the Senior Vice President
of Sales & Marketing in part because he did not make any materially false statements). Of the
one hundred and sixty-five paragraphs contained in Plaintiff’s Complaint, there is not a single
allegation that any of the Non-Speaking Defendants made any false statements or participated in
the preparation of any publicly filed document or press release. Thus, the claims against the
Non-Speaking Defendants must be dismissed.

Moreover, even if the Court decides to exercise personal jurisdiction over the Non-Speaking
officer defendants, Plaintiff has still not established that jurisdiction exists over Wang, a nonexecutive board member with no operational responsibilities.

In In re Hansen Natural Corp. Sec. Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1142, a recent opinion

2

interpreting the Supreme Court’s decision in Stoneridge, the Court dismissed allegations of

statements as to each of the individual defendants. See 527 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1153 n.3 (C.D.

5

Cal. 2007) (noting that “[a] defendant must actually make a false or misleading statement in

6

7

International Rectifier, the court dismissed with prejudice Section 10(b) claims against two

8

defendants because neither “[we]re alleged to have made a material misrepresentation or

omission, nor [we]re they alleged to have substantially participated or been intricately involved

10

11

because Plaintiff fails to allege misleading statements made by any of the Non-Speaking

Defendants, the claims against them should be dismissed.

13

Nor does Plaintiff allege any facts to show that any of the Non-Speaking Defendants

14

“substantial[ly] participat[ed]” or were “intricate[ly] involve[d]” in the purported

15

misrepresentations in order to maintain a Section 10(b) claim against them. See Siemers v.

Here, the Complaint alleges only four specific false statements: (1) the statement in

10

commitments from suppliers are sufficient to satisfy over 90% of our estimated requirements for

11

2007 and approximately 50% of our estimated requirements for 2008,” see Compl. at ¶¶ 85-86;

12

(2) an August 1, 2007, LDK press release regarding cost advantages and the value of LDK’s

13

inventory, which quoted by Defendant Peng in, see Compl. at ¶¶ 97, 104; (3) an August 1, 2007,

14

conference call hosted by Defendants Peng and Lai regarding the value of LDK’s inventory, the

15

quantity of raw materials, and cost advantages, see Compl. at ¶¶ 111-112, 114, 116; and (4)

16

LDK’s October 4, 2007, press release regarding Situ’s allegations, which stated that “[t]he

17

management team believes that these allegations have no merit.” See Compl. at ¶ 123. Plaintiff

18

does not allege that any of these statements were made by the Non-Speaking Defendants, and do

19

not allege a single fact showing that any of the Non-Speaking Defendants – in any way –

20

participated in the making of these statements or had knowledge of them being made. Instead,

21

Plaintiff merely alleges in a conclusory fashion that the Non-Speaking Defendants signed a

22

proxy statement and somehow participated or acquiesced in the issuance or dissemination of

23

false or misleading documents and statements. Compl. ¶¶ 14, 16-19, 133. These allegations fail

24

to tie any of the Non-Speaking Defendants to the preparation of the allegedly false statements or

25

to the statements themselves and are unsupported by any specific facts of wrongdoing.

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims against the Non-Speaking Defendants should be dismissed.

facts giving rise to a strong inference” (15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2)) that each Defendant acted with

2

the intent “to deceive, manipulate, or defraud” LDK’s investors. In re Infosonics Corp. Sec.

3

Litig., NO. 06cv1231 BTM(WMc), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57784, *10 (S.D. Cal. 2007),

4

(citations omitted). In doing so, Plaintiff “must plead, in great detail, facts that constitute strong

5

circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.” In re Silicon

6

Graphics, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 1999).

7

Despite the PSLRA’s requirement that Plaintiff “state with particularity facts giving rise

8

to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind” as to “each alleged

9

misrepresentation or omission,” as noted above, the Complaint lacks any facts about the Non-

10

Speaking Defendants’ state of mind, let alone any allegations to infer a strong inference of

11

scienter. In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 960 (C.D. Cal. 2000)

12

(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2)) (emphasis added). Indeed, the Complaint does not allege that

13

the Non-Speaking Defendants made any misstatements at all, let alone give rise to a strong

14

inference of scienter. Plaintiff’s generic boilerplate allegations does not satisfy Plaintiff’s

15

obligation to plead specific facts that create a strong inference of scienter as to each Defendant

16

individually. The failure to allege any facts that could support a strong inference of scienter as to

17

the Non-Speaking Defendants is, by itself, fatal to the claims against those defendants.

18

Moreover, Plaintiff can place no reliance on the “group pleading” doctrine to cure this

19

defect. As this Court has already stated, the “group pleading” doctrine “contradicts the PSLRA’s

20

requirements.” See In re LDK Solar Sec. Litig., No. C 07-05182 WHA, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

21

42425, *34 (N.D. Cal. May 29, 2008)In re LDK, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42425 at *34 (citing

23

INSpire Insurance Solutions, Inc., 365 F.3d 353 (5th Cir. 2004)). This position was further

24

affirmed in International Rectifier, in which the court there held that “the group pleading

doctrine did not survive the PSLRA.” See 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44872 at *35 (citing In re

26

Hansen, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 1153-1163).

27

Furthermore, Plaintiff’s allegation that the Non-Speaking Defendants signed a document

28

that was filed with the SEC does not, by itself, establish a “strong inference” of scienter. See In

re Infonet Services Corp. Sec. Litig., 310 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1103 (C.D. Cal. 2003) (finding

2

strong showing of scienter not satisfied with general allegations that individual defendants signed

3

registration statement). As noted in Hansen, if that were all that was required, “scienter would

4

be established in every case where there was an accounting error or auditing mistake made by a

5

publicly traded company, thereby eviscerating the pleading requirements for scienter set forth in

6

the PSLRA.” In re Hansen, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 1159-1160 (citations omitted). Therefore, that

7

the Non-Speaking Defendants signed an SEC filing does not give rise to a strong inference of

8

scienter.

9

Finally, Plaintiff’s unsupported allegation that LDK’s accounting violated GAAP also

10

does not establish a “strong inference” of scienter. As this Court explained in In re Pacific

11

Gateway Exch., Inc., Sec. Litig., mere “allegations of failure to follow GAAP are not adequate to

12

establish scienter, because scienter requires more than a misapplication of accounting

13

principles.” 169 F. Supp. 2d 1160, 1167 (N.D. Cal. 2001) (quoting In re Worlds of Wonder Sec.

14

Litig., 35 F.3d 1407, 1426 (9th Cir. 1994)). To plead a strong inference of fraud in cases

15

alleging GAAP violations and accounting fraud, Plaintiff must provide copious detail of such

16

misconduct, rather than alleging in general terms that Defendants failed to comply with GAAP.

17

See, e.g., In re FVC.COM Sec. Litig., 136 F. Supp. 2d 1031, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (dismissing

18

complaint that failed to plead accounting fraud in detail).

19

Here, Plaintiff does not allege any facts that actually establish any GAAP violations.

20

Indeed, as LDK’s April 7, 2008 MTD explained, every single other person or entity that

21

examined the financials – including several accounting experts – found them GAAP compliant.

22

See LDK’s April 7, 2008 MTD at 6-7. Because Plaintiff has not provided any details regarding

23

the purported misconduct on the part of the Non-Speaking Defendants, Plaintiff falls far short of

24

the standard necessary for inferring scienter for the Non-Speaking Defendants from the alleged

25

GAAP violations.

a last resort that “by their receipt of information reflecting the true facts regarding LDK” and

2

their “associations with the Company which made them privy to confidential proprietary

3

information concerning LDK,” the Non-Speaking Defendants “participated in the fraudulent

4

scheme alleged.” See Compl. ¶ 133. However, Plaintiff’s unsupported conclusion is insufficient

5

to plead a strong inference of scienter as a matter of law.

6

F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1023 (N.D. Cal. 2002) (“Mere access to data is insufficient to support a

securities claim under the PSLRA.”); see also Int’l Rectifier, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *46

8

(citing In re Apple Computer, Inc., 243 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1023 (N.D. Cal. 2002).

See In re Apple Computer, Inc., 243

9

International Rectifier is particularly instructive. While the plaintiff there did not allege

10

any basis for the court to conclude that the CEO or CFO actually reviewed the information that

11

the plaintiff claimed they were privy to, the court held that “[m]ore importantly, even if [the

12

CEO] and [the CFO] had reviewed [the relevant] reports . . . it does not give rise to a strong

13

inference of scienter,” because there was “no basis for presuming that [the CEO] and [the CFO]

14

should have noticed [the alleged discrepancies], or that if they did, they should have been aware

15

of the significance of such [discrepancies].” See Int’l Rectifier, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *46-

16

47. Similarly here, Plaintiff does not allege any basis for the Court to conclude that any of the

17

Non-Speaking Defendants reviewed, or should have reviewed, the purportedly available

18

information, or that they should have been aware of the significance of any purported

19

deficiencies.

20

Plaintiff’s reliance on the Non-Speaking Defendants’ “associations with the Company” as

21

a means to establish a strong inference of scienter is also misplaced. See Compl. ¶ 133. In

22

Apple Computer, this Court made clear that it is not enough to merely allege that because of a

23

defendant’s position in a company that person must have known of the relevant facts. See 243 F.

24

Supp. 2d at 1026 (“It is not enough for Plaintiffs to allege that Defendants could have known

25

about the [ ] problems, or even that they should have known about them. Plaintiffs must allege

26

something approaching actual knowledge on the part of [senior officers] who made statements

27

regarding the company.”); see also In re Autodesk, Inc. Sec. Litig., 132 F. Supp. 2d 833, 844

28

(N.D. Cal. 2000) (“[P]laintiffs must do more than allege that these key officers had the requisite

knowledge by virtue of their ‘hands on’ positions, because that would eliminate the necessity for

2

specially pleading scienter, as any corporate officer could be said to possess the requisite

3

knowledge by virtue of his or her position.”).

4

Here, however, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts from which could draw a “strong

5

inference” of scienter, i.e., facts that establish that the Non-Speaking Defendants had knowledge

6

of the purported accounting deficiencies. Therefore, Plaintiff’s generic allegations – without any

7

averment showing that any of the Non-Speaking Defendants had anything approaching actual

8

knowledge and then made false or misleading statements – fail as a matter of law.2

9

The recent Ninth Circuit holding in Berson v. Applied Signal Tech., Inc., 527 F.3d 982

10

(9th Cir. 2008), does not rescue Plaintiff’s deficient Complaint. In that case, the Court held that

11

the plaintiffs were entitled to infer that the defendants were aware of facts that were “prominent

12

enough that it would be ‘absurd to suggest’ that top management was unaware of them.” Id. at

13

*17. The prominent fact in Berson, however, was the existence and effect of stop-work orders,

14

of which the Court stated that “it [wa]s hard to believe that [the defendants] would not have

15

known about stop-work orders,” because they were “high-level managers” who were “directly

16

responsible for [the Company’s] day-to-day operations,” and the stop-work orders had a

17

“devastating effect on the corporation’s revenue.” Id. at *12-14. The Court further stated that

18

“any number of company employees would be in a position to infer the issuance of stop-work

19

orders,” because they “have had the very obvious effect of putting numerous employees out of

20

work.” Id. at *4. Simply put, in Berson, the Court held only that it may be inferred that those

21

individuals that are directly involved in the day-to-day operations of a company possess

22

knowledge of those obvious corporate events about which would be apparent to “any number of

23

company employees.”

It should be noted that Plaintiff’s failure to establish knowledge of such purported accounting
deficiencies is particularly obvious with regard to Wang, a non-executive board member who did
not have any responsibility for the Company’s day-to-day management. See Weiss v. Amkor
Tech., Inc., 527 F. Supp. 2d 938, 950 (D. Ariz. 2007) (dismissing plaintiffs’ securities class
action complaint and finding that “[w]hat is missing from the [complaint] regarding the outside
directors’ scienter are factual allegations setting forth what information was presented to the
outside directors about any of the alleged misrepresentations, omissions, GAAP violations etc.
that put them on actual or constructive notice of fraudulent activity.”).

Berson is clearly distinguishable from the facts before this Court. Plaintiff has not come

2

close to alleging that the purported inventory discrepancies at LDK were so obvious that “any

3

number of employees would be in a position to infer” their existence. Indeed, quite the contrary,

4

assuming that inventory discrepancies did exist – which they did not – they escaped detection

5

from every qualified professional who looked for them. This includes two sets of independent

6

auditors, one independent world-class law firm, and two independent outside directors. See In re

7

LDK Solar Sec. Litig., No. C 07-05182 WHA, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42425, *14-16 (N.D. Cal.

8

May 29, 2008) LDK’s April 9, 2008 MTD at 6-7. There is quite simply no way to conclude that

9

“any number of company employees” at LDK would have been in a position to infer the

10

existence alleged accounting deficiencies, given that trained experts were unable to detect any

11

deficiencies. Also, unlike Berson, here, the source of Plaintiff’s Complaint – Situ’s e-mail –

12

shows that Situ did not communicate his concerns to any of the Non-Speaking Defendants.

13

Unlike Berson, the Court here should not accept an inference that is directly contrary to facts in

14

Situ’s judicially noticeable e-mail.

15

Moreover, the stop-work orders in Berson were sent from the company’s customers

16

(usually government agencies) to the company and the court concluded that it was reasonable to

17

assume that such a document would make its normal distribution within the company. See

18

Berson, 527 F.3d at 984, 987-89. But here, the determination of the quantity and quality of

19

LDK’s inventory admittedly involves more. As the Complaint and Situ’s e-mail allege, LDK’s

20

inventory was maintained in several different locations and Situ’s contention that it was wrong in

21

September 2007 arose from his review of various different records in August 2007.3 There is no

22

allegation establishing a strong inference that the Non-Speaking Defendants similarly counted or

23

tested LDK’s inventory and nothing to indicate the Non-Speaking Defendants were apprised of

24

any different opinions. Therefore, the inference drawn by the Court in Berson is not warranted

25

here.

The Complaint’s source, Situ’s e-mail, shows Situ did not verify the inventory in all those
sources and did nothing to determine its usability.
