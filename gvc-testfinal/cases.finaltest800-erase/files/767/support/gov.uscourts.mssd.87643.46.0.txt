CITY OF PEARL, MISSISSIPPI
AND MAYOR BRAD ROGERS
DEFENDANTS
______________________________________________________________________________
MEMORANDUM OF AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANT MAYOR BRAD ROGERS „MOTION TO DISMISS
______________________________________________________________________________
COMES NOW, the Defendant Mayor Brad Rogers (The Mayor) and submits this
Memorandum of Authorities in support of its Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended
Complaint of the Plaintiff(s), pursuant to Rules 8 and 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
IMMUNITY DEFENSES
Qualified Immunity
The Mayor invokes the affirmative defense of Qualified Immunity as a protection
for Plaintiff(s) Purposeful Discrimination claims against the Mayor. Qualified
Immunity protects public officials from the burden of litigation as well as from
Judgments. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817 (1982). Therefore, the issue should
be resolved early and when possible, before discovery. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.
635, 646 (1987).
“[A] Plaintiff seeking to defeat Qualified Immunity must show (1) that the
official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was clearly
established at the time of the challenged conduct.” Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F. 3d 359,
1

371 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011)). A
court may consider either prong of the qualified immunity analysis first. Pearson v.
Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009).
The Second Amended Complaint sets forth no set of facts explaining how the
Mayor violated a statutory or constitutional right of Plaintiff(s). The Second Amended
Complaint contains nothing more than blanket accusations against the Mayor with no
factual basis of the Mayor‟s conduct.
The Second Amended Complaint does not establish any set of facts or allude to
any evidence that can prove to the finder of fact that the Mayor intentionally
discriminated against low and moderate income housing. Since the Plaintiffs cannot
meet this burden the Second Amended Complaint against the Mayor should be
dismissed. See generally Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133,
141 (2000).
Legislative Immunity
The Mayor invokes the affirmative defense of Legislative Immunity. In Hughes
v. Tarrant County, Texas 948 F2d 918 (5th Cir. 1991) this Court … “discussed the various
legal standards for evaluating whether a particular activity is “legislative” rather than
“administrative”and therefore protected by absolute immunity. Bryan v. City of
Madison, Mississippi, 231 F3d 267, 273 (5th Cir. 2000). Legislative immunity protects
officials fulfilling legislative functions even if they are not “legislators.” Hughes v.
Tarrant County, Texas, 948 F2d 918, 920 (5th Cir. 1991).
“The first step in our analysis, therefore, is to determine exactly what activities
[Plaintiffs] ha[ve] challenged.” Bryan v. City of Madison, Mississippi, 231 F3d 267, 272
(5th Cir. 2000). Here, Plaintiff(s) have not and cannot plead facts detailing how the
Mayor “purposefully engaged in discrimination against low and moderate income
housing by the actions described hereinabove and further by adopting on June 27, 2013
an ordinance … titled “Rental Housing Code.”” Second Amended Complaint, Docket
#22, page 9 paragraph 32.

2

The actions of the Mayor, if any, were legislative in nature. The Rental Housing
Code in question was enacted by the Board of Alderman as general policy regarding the
health, safety and wellbeing of inhabitants, guests, the general public and first
responders. The Code applies equally to all persons and does not specifically target one
particular mobile home park over another.
Absolute Immunity
The Mayor invokes the affirmative defense of Absolute Immunity. Absolute
immunity applies to activities, not offices. Marreco v. City of Hialeah, 625 F. 2d 499,
508 (5th Cir. 1980). The Plaintiffs, in their Second Amended Complaint, can not show
any activity on the part of the Mayor that would lead this Court to a determination of
plausibility as it relates to the Purposeful Discrimination claim. Furthermore, Absolute
Immunity focuses on the governmental function being performed and the nature of the
responsibilities of the official, not on the specific action taken. Bogan v. Scott-Harris,
523 U.S. 44, 54-55 (1998); Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U.S. 193, 201-02 (1985). The Mayor
simply presided over Board meetings. The Mayor did not cast a vote on any of the
legislation that is the subject of this litigation. The Board of Alderman voted to enact
the Code which was part of the City of Pearl‟s (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
“City”) was general policy concerning the health, safety and wellbeing of the
inhabitants, guests, the general public and first responders.
Mississippi Tort Claims Act
The Mayor is an employee pursuant to the Mississippi Tort Claims Act
Mississippi Code Annotated Section 11-46-1(f) (2013) (hereinafter the “MTCA”).
According to MCTA Sec. 11-46-1(f) an “”Employee” means any officer, employee or
servant of the State of Mississippi or a political subdivision of the state, including
elected or appointed officials and persons acting on behalf of the state or political
subdivision in any official capacity, temporarily or permanently, in the service of the
state or a political subdivision whether with or without compensation, including
firefighters who are members of a volunteer fire department that is a political
subdivision.“
3

MTCA 11-46-7(2)(2013) states “[a]n employee may be joined in an action against
a governmental entity in a representative capacity if the act or omission complained of
is one for which the governmental entity may be liable, but no employee shall be held
personally liable for acts or omissions occurring within the course and scope of the
employees duties.”
Under the MTCA any governmental entity enjoys sovereign immunity, and no
aggrieved party can sue an employee in his individual capacity unless the employee
acted outside the scope of his employment. Miss. Dept. of Transp. v. Trosclair; 851 So.
2d 408, 413 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003). The Second Amended Complaint does not allege that
the Mayor was acting outside the scope of his employment. The Mayor enjoys
sovereign immunity to the state law claims and Plaintiffs cannot sue him.
FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RULES 8 AND 12
THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
The Second Amended Complaint reflects that the Rental Housing Code
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Code”) adopted on or about June 27, 2014
deals with various issues concerning the health safety and wellbeing of residents,
guests, the general public and first responders. Some of those issues are, including but
not limited to, sanitary facilities, food preparation facilities, garbage storage areas,
electrical/lighting services, thermal facilities, doors/windows, rooms, space and
occupancy, “safety and security”, foundations, exterior appearance, drainage and storm
water facilities, sprinklers, storm shelters and warning systems. The application of the
requirements of the Code is designed for the general purpose of public safety.
The adoption of the Code was accomplished by majority vote of the Board of
Alderman. Under the City‟s form of government the Mayor did not have a vote on the
Code. The Mayor is protected from this litigation because Plaintiff(s) allege no facts
that show the actions of the Mayor (1) violated a constitutional right and (2) violated a
clearly established law. Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2093 (2012).
4

The Second Amended Complaint does not allege any facts on how the Mayor
purposefully discriminated against anyone. The Second Amended Complaint does not
allege any facts that would lead the finder of fact to the determination that the Mayor is
liable to Plaintiff(s) for violation of any right listed therein.
The Second Amended Complaint does not allege any facts that show Plaintiffs
are in business to provide low and moderate income housing. The Second Amended
Complaint does not allege any facts on how the Code will destroy the economic
viability of rental units in the City of Pearl, Mississippi. The Second Amended
Complaint alleges no facts that would lead the finder of fact to the conclusion that the
Mayor is liable to Plaintiff(s) for targeting low or moderate income housing or
destroying economic viability of Rental Units in the City.
DISCUSSION
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires “a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief” Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556 U.S. 662, 667-78 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “[T]he
pleading standard Rule 8 announces … demands more than an unadorned, thedefendant-unlawfully-harmed –me accusation.” Id. at 678 (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).
A claim fails if it is a “formulaic recitation of the elements of [that] cause of
action,” which fails to satisfy Rule 8‟s pleading standard. Bell A. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 555 (2007). To plead facial plausibility, a plaintiff must set forth factual content that
permits the courts to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable. Iqbal,
556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009). Where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the
court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has not
sufficiently shown that the pleader is entitled to relief. Id. at 1950.
To avoid dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to
state a claim that is plausible on its face.” Bell A. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570
5

(2007). To be plausible, “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief
above the speculative level….” Id at 555 (citations and footnote omitted). “A claim has
facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw
the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009)(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at
556). Where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere
possibility of misconduct, the complaint has not sufficiently shown that the pleader is
entitled to relief. Id. at 1950.
Given the defects in the Plaintiffs‟ Second Amended Complaint requires that the
Defendant be awarded its reasonable attorney‟s fees and cost pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
1988(b). The Defendant should be allowed to submit the details of its attorney‟s fees
and expenses, once the Court makes a determination of the dismissal of the Plaintiffs‟
claims.
CONCLUSION
The Mayor is immune in this matter through the affirmative defenses of
Qualified Immunity, Legislative Immunity, Absolute Immunity and Sovereign State
Law Immunity via the MTCA. The Second Amended Complaint does not meet the
standard required by Rules 8 and 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and should
be dismissed and the Defendant be awarded all the cost and attorney‟s fees incurred in
defense of this action.

Respectfully submitted,
MAYOR BRAD ROGERS
