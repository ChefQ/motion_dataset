I.

BMI Concedes that Fact Discovery Is Not Premature
In its Reply, BMI appears to have silently abandoned its position that fact discovery is

premature. (Doc. No. 185 at 2-4) Indeed, BMI’s previous position is unsustainable given the
fact that on April 12th, one day after Accuray filed its opposition to this motion, BMI propounded
its own discovery requests (consisting of 44 document requests and 19 interrogatories).
Although BMI had the opportunity to alert the Court that it had served its own discovery requests
when it filed its Reply brief on April 15th, BMI failed to do so. Given that both sides have now
initiated discovery, one of BMI’s primary arguments for its motion is moot.
II.

BMI Has No Legal Support for its Objection that Accuray’s Requests are
Ultimate Conclusions of Law
BMI’s reply is devoid of case law to support its position that Accuray’s requests are directed

to ultimate legal conclusions.1 BMI does not respond to Accuray’s discussion of the case law,
yet still maintains that:“(1) whether the accused device has all or is missing the elements of a
claim, and (2) whether the prior art contains all or is missing the elements of a claim are ultimate
legal conclusions in a patent case.” The case law is contrary to BMI’s position. See, e.g., Phillip
M. Adams and Associates v. Dell, Inc., No. 1:05-cv-64, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3913 (D. Utah
2007). As Accuray explained in its opposition, after claim construction, the question of whether
each limitation of the claim can be found in an accused infringing device or in a prior art
reference is a factual question. See Doc. No.186 at 10-12.
III.

Dr. Rosen’s Tutorial Provided A Detailed Explanation of the Background of
the ‘283 Patent Technology
BMI misunderstands the purpose of Accuray’s reference to Dr. Rosen’s declaration and

tutorial. Dr. Rosen provided a detailed explanation of the background of the ‘283 patent

1

BMI cites to one case, United Coal, for the general proposition that requests for admission
should be phrased so that they can be admitted or denied with minimal explanation.
1

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 192 Filed 04/18/13 Page 3 of 8

technology, and Accuray’s Requests are designed in part to determine whether there is any
dispute about these basic technological facts. If BMI disagrees with Dr. Rosen’s explanation of
the technology, presumably it can deny certain Requests. In addition, BMI can also look to other
sources, including the ‘283 patent, the prior art of record, Accuray’s Invalidity Contentions, and
Accuray’s Initial Disclosures to answer the Requests. As BMI will find, Dr. Rosen’s tutorial is
consistent with these other sources.
IV.

Accuray’s Requests Do Not Require Expert Analysis or Lengthy
Explanations
BMI also complains that it cannot respond to Accuray’s Requests without hours of expert

analysis, and without lengthy and detailed explanations. Requests 1-90, 94-96, 98, 100, 105 and
106 call for admissions of basic facts and do not require either a lengthy response or an expert
report. BMI provides three examples, but none of them proves its point.
For example, Request No. 37 is directed to a basic fact about how the simulated annealing
optimization algorithm works. If BMI truly understands its own patent disclosure, it should be
able to answer this question without any expert assistance. The answer can plainly be found
within the Webb articles incorporated by reference in the ‘283 patent. Any qualified expert in
the field could readily answer the question without any lengthy explanation. Indeed, this
Request could be answered through a simple Wikipedia search or basic internet search.2
Request No. 58 simply asks BMI to admit or deny whether the Webb 1989 article discloses
“an apparatus for determining an optimized beam arrangement for applying radiation to a tumor
target volume while minimizing radiation of a structure volume in a patient as those terms are
used in the claims of the ‘283 patent.” The answer to this question can be found, for example, on
the very first page of the Webb 1989 article. E.g. “A method of computing the beam profiles for
2

See, e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing.
2

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 192 Filed 04/18/13 Page 4 of 8

multi-element multiple-beam radiotherapy treatment is presented . . . The aim of all radical
radiotherapy of local primary disease is to deliver a tumourcidal dose to a volume in space
containing and possibly extending a little beyond the margins of disease whilst at the same time
delivering as small as possible dose to normal tissue.” (Doc. No.186, Ex. 6, p. 1349) This
excerpt is explained in detail in Accuray’s LPR 3.4 Invalidity Contentions.
Request No. 95 asks BMI to admit that the royalty base for a reasonable royalty does not
include the data management or treatment delivery components of the CyberKnife system. BMI
is aware that the CyberKnife system includes three separate components: (1) data management,
(2 ) treatment delivery and (3) treatment planning. The only portion of the CyberKnife system
that BMI accuses of infringement is the treatment planning component, and thus a royalty base
for a reasonable royalty should not include the data management or treatment delivery
components. BMI should be able to admit or deny this with minimal effort. At most this request
involves the application of law to fact, which is entirely permissible under Rule 36(a)(1)(a).
BMI may qualify its answer, but may not refuse to answer.
Accuray’s Requests do not require any lengthy discussion. Under the Rules, BMI is
permitted to break down the Requests into sub-parts and respond to each. For example, if BMI
admits to certain portions of a request, it may specifically call out those portions and admit them.
Likewise, it may specifically call out and deny any portions of a Request to which it objects.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(4). This is not nearly as complicated as BMI makes it appear, and Accuray
is entitled to BMI’s position on these issues.
V.

BMI’s Vagueness Objection is No Excuse For Not Answering Accuray’s
Requests
BMI now argues that Accuray’s Requests are vague because Accuray does not point to specific

pages where the answers to the Requests can be found. Rule 36, however, requires BMI to provide a

3

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 192 Filed 04/18/13 Page 5 of 8

statement of its understanding of the specific Request, and answer it based on that understanding,
regardless of its vagueness objections. See, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc., Wallenstein, No. 92cv-5770, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18774, at *3 (E.D. Pa., Dec. 17, 1996). Furthermore, as Accuray
explained, the Requests are taken from the ‘283 patent, the Webb articles incorporated by reference
therein, Dr. Rosen’s tutorial, BMI’s infringement contentions, the pages of Accuray’s Initial
Disclosures which BMI cited in its infringement contentions, and the prior art references cited in
Accuray’s Invalidity Contentions. BMI should know the contents of its own patent, including the
Webb articles that are incorporated by reference and thus part of the ‘283 specification. BMI should
also know the contents of the pages from Accuray’s Initial Disclosures that it cited to support its
infringement contentions. If BMI used an expert to assist in the preparation of its infringement
contentions, it should already know the answers to Accuray’s Requests. If BMI did not use an
expert, and does not understand these documents without the use of an expert, it begs the question of
whether BMI ever had a good faith basis for its infringement contentions in this case.
Similarly, if BMI has read Accuray’s Invalidity Contentions, it should know exactly where to
look for answers to Accuray’s Requests. In August 2011, Accuray served its Invalidity Contentions,
including a document which provided a detailed prose explanation of where each limitation of the
claims is found in each of the prior art references, as well as a claim chart which pointed to specific
pages, column and line numbers in the prior art.

BMI should be able to admit or deny which claim

limitations are described in each of the prior art references, and pinpoint the disputed issues. If BMI
has not yet reviewed Accuray’s Invalidity Contentions, it must do so now because Rule 36 requires
BMI to make a reasonable inquiry. Willful blindness does not excuse BMI from answering the
Requests.
BMI’s objection to the word “the” displays a calculated disregard of basic principles of
mathematics. As BMI must know, each algorithm is a mathematical description of a problem. Each
mathematical problem has a “solution set,” a “cost” and “variables,” and thus it is appropriate to use

4

Case 2:10-cv-01043-TFM Document 192 Filed 04/18/13 Page 6 of 8

the article “the” in relationship to those words. Such background information can be found on
Wikipedia or a basic internet search. See e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing
(referring to “the solution space”).

BMI also mistakenly argues that Accuray is “trying to improperly shoehorn admissions as to
general statements about general algorithms into a non-infringement argument regarding
Accuray’s specific algorithms.” With respect to Claim 29, which BMI entirely ignores, the
substantial differences between linear optimization algorithms and stochastic optimization
algorithms such as simulated annealing are dispositive. In addition, Accuray’s algorithms do not
use the specific cost function of Claim 29, as construed by this Court. BMI protests that it needs
much more discovery, including source code, before it responds to Accuray’s Requests and
actually commits to an infringement position. However, access to Accuray’s source code will
not help BMI overcome the flaws in its infringement theory. This case can be decided at a
higher level of abstraction and without the additional and unnecessary burden and expense.
VI.

BMI Did Not Comply with the Meet and Confer Requirement
Ignoring the contemporaneous email correspondence, BMI argues that it complied with the

meet and confer requirement. However, the exhibits attached to Accuray’s opposition
substantiate Accuray’s description of the sequence of events. BMI refused to outline the
specifics of its objections in advance, although it clearly knew what its arguments would be.
Accuray simply asked BMI to provide some specificity to its objections so that Accuray could
meaningfully respond during the meet and confer –a customary practice when preparing to
address a potential discovery dispute. See Doc. No. 186, Ex. 1. BMI refused to provide the
information, and unilaterally refused to meet and confer.
Accordingly, Accuray respectfully requests that the Court deny BMI’s Motion for a
Protective Order and order BMI to respond to Accuray’s Requests Nos. 1-106 by April 25, 2013.
