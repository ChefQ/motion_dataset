Re:

United States v. William E. Baroni, Jr. and Bridget Anne Kelly
Crim. No. 15-193 (SDW)

Dear Judge Wigenton:
The United States respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendants’ May 27,
2015 joint request for an order directing the pretrial production of documents responsive to a
Rule 17(c) trial subpoena. Specifically, defendants Bridget Anne Kelly and William E. Baroni,
Jr. have asked the Court to compel the pretrial production of the following:
a. Any and all handwritten or typed notes, stenographic transcripts and audio and/or video
recordings of witness interviews conducted by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP (“Gibson
Dunn”) during its representation of the Office of the Governor of New Jersey from on or
about January 16, 2014 to the present, and
b. Any and all metadata and the document properties for all typed notes and interview
summaries created during interviews of witnesses during Gibson Dunn’s representation
of the Office of the Governor of New Jersey from on or about January 16, 2014 to the
present.
It is not clear from the defendants’ papers that the materials sought would be admissible
as evidence at trial. Furthermore, to the extent that the materials are sought for the purpose of
impeaching Government witnesses, they ordinarily would not properly be the subject of an order
compelling pretrial production under Rule 17. United States v. Cuthbertson, 630 F.2d 139, 144
(3d Cir. 1980). Nevertheless, without prejudice to the United States’ ability to challenge the
admissibility of any such materials at trial or to challenge any subsequent defense motion under

Case 2:15-cr-00193-SDW Document 17 Filed 06/04/15 Page 2 of 2 PageID: 209

Rule 17 to compel the pretrial production of witness statements or impeachment material, the
United States does not object to the issuance of the subpoena for the materials specified above.

Respectfully submitted,
PAUL J. FISHMAN
United States Attorney
