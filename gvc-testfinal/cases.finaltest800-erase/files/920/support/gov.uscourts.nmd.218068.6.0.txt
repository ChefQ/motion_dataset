IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO
EDWARD O’FINNEGAN,
Plaintiff,
v.

No. 10-CIV-965 WJ/LFG

CAPITAL ONE AUTO FINANCE,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT CAPITAL ONE AUTO FINANCE’S
MOTION TO DISMISS WITH ACCOMPANYING AUTHORITIES
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendant CAPITAL ONE
AUTO FINANCE, INC. (“Capital One”), by and through undersigned counsel,
respectfully submits this Motion to Dismiss the portion of Plaintiff's Complaint [DKT 1]
alleging a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act1. This Motion is supported by the
following Memorandum of Points and Authorities.

INTRODUCTION.
Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
("FCRA"), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq, as a matter of law and Capital One respectfully
requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiff's claim. While Capital One vigorously denies
the factual allegations that it engaged in conduct amounting to violations of the FCRA,
Capital One nevertheless accepts that for motion to dismiss purposes, the well pled
factual allegations made in the Complaint will be taken as true. However, Plaintiff's
alleged facts, even if true (which they are not), fail to subject Capital One to liability

Plaintiff has numerous allegations in his Complaint relating to FCRA claims. Specifically, COAF is seeking to
dismiss the claims made in paragraphs 37 through 100 of his Complaint.

Case 1:10-cv-00965-WJ -LFG Document 6

under the FCRA. Therefore, the portion of Plaintiff's Complaint relating to the FCRA
must be dismissed as a matter of law.
I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND.
Plaintiff alleges in the FCRA portion of his Complaint that he has no "valid" loan

agreement with Defendant Capital One, but "even if Plaintiff does have such an
agreement, which the Plaintiff denies, the alleged account is not in question here." [See
Complaint at §§ 8-9.] Further, Plaintiff alleges that Capital One reported inaccurate
information to credit reporting agencies and that Capital One allegedly refused to amend
the substance of its report after Plaintiff allegedly contacted Capital One to dispute the
information. [Id. at §§12-19.] However, even if everything that Plaintiff alleged was true,
Plaintiff has no standing to sue Capital One for these actions under the FCRA.
II.

LEGAL STANDARD.
To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain factual

allegations sufficient to "raise a right of relief above the speculative level." Bell Atl.
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Courts will not assume that a plaintiff can
prove facts beyond those alleged in the complaint. See Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal.
v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526 (1983); Jack Russell Terrier
Network of N. Cal. v. Am. Kennel Club, Inc., 407 F.3d 1027, 1035 (9th Cir. 2005).
Moreover, courts will not accept as true unsupported conclusions and unwarranted
inferences, couched as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct.
1937, 1950 (2009) (stating that pleadings which contain "no more than conclusions,
[without any factual support], are not entitled to the assumption of truth"). Rather, under
Rule 8(a), "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a
claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Id. at ___, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (quoting
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).

"A pleading that offers 'labels and conclusions' or 'a

formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.'" Id. (quoting
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). "Nor does a complaint suffice if i t tenders 'naked

Filed 11/22/10 Page 3 of 6

assertion[s]' devoid of 'further factual enhancement.'" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at
557).
As the Supreme Court held earlier last year in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, Rule 8(a)(2)
"demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."
Id. at ___, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. The Court emphasized that "[t]hreadbare recitals of the
elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice"
and that such thin pleading "does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed
with nothing more than conclusions." Id. at ___, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-50. In order to be
"facially plausible" the facts, as pled, must allow the court "to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. (quoting Twombly,
550 U.S. at 556). This requires "more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted
unlawfully," and more than an assertion of facts that are "merely consistent with" a
defendant's liability. Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).
III.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
1.

Capital One Is An Alleged Furnisher Of Information.

The FCRA places obligations on three specific “types of entities: (1) consumer
reporting agencies; (2) users of consumer reports; and (3) furnishers of information to
consumer reporting agencies." See Whisenant v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 258 F.
Supp. 2d 1312, 1316 (N.D. Okla. 2003) (citing Aklagi v. Nationscredit Fin., 196 F. Supp.
2d 1186, 1192 (D. Kan. 2002)). Plaintiff does not allege that Capital One is a consumer
reporting agency or a user of consumer reports. Instead, Plaintiff alleges that Capital One
"reported to Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, and Innovis credit reporting agencies
erroneous and inaccurate information". [See Plaintiff's Complaint at ¶48.] Accordingly,
and since Capital One's actions allegedly resulted in "adverse reports" to credit agencies,
Capital One is a furnisher of information under the FCRA by Plaintiff.
2.

Plaintiff does Not Have Standing To Bring A Private Cause Of Action
Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(a) Against Furnishers Of Information.

-3-

Case 1:10-cv-00965-WJ -LFG Document 6

Filed 11/22/10 Page 4 of 6

Under § 1681s-2(a), furnishers of information have a duty to provide accurate
information to a credit reporting agency. However, courts have recognized that there is
no private cause of action against a furnisher of information for violations of § 1681s-2(a)
- the duty to provide accurate information to a credit reporting agency. See, e.g., Nelson
v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., 282 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir. 2002)(“Congress did
not want furnishers of credit information exposed to suit by any and every consumer
dissatisfied with the credit information furnished.

Hence, Congress limited the

enforcement of the duties imposed by §1681s-2(a) to governmental bodies”); Roybal v.
Equifax, 405 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1179-80 (E.D. Cal. 2005); Cisneros v. Trans Union, LLC,
293 F. Supp. 2d 1167, 1174 (D. Haw. 2003); Whisenant, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 1316;
Stafford v. Cross Country Bank, 262 F. Supp. 2d 776, 782-83 (W.D. Ky. 2003); see also
15 U.S.C. §§ 1681s-2(c)(1), 1681s-2(d) (stating that violations of § 1681s-2(a) "shall be
enforced exclusively as provided under section 1681s of this title by the Federal agencies
and officials and the State officials identified in section 1681s of this title") (emphasis
added).
Plaintiff's Complaint is limited to allegations that Capital One violated 15 U.S.C. §
1681s-2(a) and (e). [See Complaint §§ 42-47, 56-65, 74-79 (specifically citing 15 U.S.C.
§ 1681s-2(a) and (e))]. Plaintiff does not allege that Capital One violated any other
portion of the FCRA. However, as described above, Plaintiff has no standing to sue
Capital One for violations of 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(a). Even if every allegation Plaintiff
makes in his Complaint is true, Congress did not provide for a private cause of action
under 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(a) and Plaintiff has no standing to sue Capital One for
violations of 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(a). Therefore, as a matter of law, the Complaint fails
to state a claim for relief and the FCRA claims described in paragraphs 37-100 of
Plaintiff's Complaint must be dismissed.
Moreover, Plaintiff's allegations under 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(e) fail for the same
reason. Paragraph (e) requires the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit

-4-

Filed 11/22/10 Page 5 of 6

Union Administration to establish and maintain guidelines for each person that furnishes
information to a consumer reporting agency. See 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(e)(1). Paragraph
(e) only applies to the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union
Administration and it does not impose any duty on Capital One. Capital One simply
cannot, as a matter of law, be liable under 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(e) because that section of
the law does not apply to Capital One.
IV.

CONCLUSION.
For the foregoing reasons, the Capital One respectfully requests that this Court

dismiss the portion of Plaintiff's Complaint relating to the FCRA in its entirety and with
prejudice.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 22th day of November, 2010.
