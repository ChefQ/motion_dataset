MOTION IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS
TO: CAPITAL ONES MOTION TO DISMISS

1. Comes now the Plaintiff Edward O'Finnegan, Pro'Se, and hereby submits his opposition
to the Defendant Capital One Auto to Dismiss.

2. Note: No action under DCPA is asserted against the Defendant Capital One Auto,

 

3. The Plaintiff brings this action against the Defendant as a result of Defendant's Capital
One Auto, violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681 and Telephone
Consumer Protection Act 47 U.S.C. 0x00A7 227.

4, This case is not about any alleged monies, alleged monies owed, or alleged accounts, or
judgments but rather what Defendant Capital One Auto, did or did not do when challenged
under the FCRA & TCPA. FCRA laws are geared directly at the provider of information to
credit reporting agencies and their failure at compliance. TCPA laws provide protection to
consumers against any person making any call using an automatic dialing system or an
artificial or prerecorded voice to cellular telephone services.

5. It is what they are supposed to do when challenged in credit reporting and not about
accounts owed or claimed to be owed. Where is the term "money" or debt in the FCRA?

There exists, the word "debt collector," because any consumer, such as this Plaintiff, has

Case 1:10-cv-00965-WJ -LFG Document 14 Filed 01/07/11 Page 2 of 24

the right to challenge the "debt collector and or providers of information such as the

Defendant.
Defendant claims there is no private right of action under 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681s-2(a), which

governs the duty of furnishers. The TCPA clearly provides private right of action under

47 U.S.C. 0x00A7 227 (b)(3). The Plaintiff will clarify the law from the FCRA

0x00A7 602. Congressional findings and statement of purpose [15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681]
(a) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. The Congress makes the following
findings:

(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting.
Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and
unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is
essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

0x00A7 603. Definitions; rules of construction [15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681a]

(a) Definitions and rules of construction set forth in this section are applicable for
the purposes of this title.

(b) The term "person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust,

estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or

agency, or other entity.

(c) The term "consumer" means an individual.

617. Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 16810]

(a) In general. Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any
requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that

consumer in an amount equal to the sum of

(1) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and
(2) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section,
the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney's fees as determined by
the court.

(b) Attorney's fees. On a finding by the court that an unsuccessful pleading,
motion, or other paper filed in connection with an action under this section was
filed in bad faith or for purposes of harassment, the court shall award to the
prevailing party attorney's fees reasonable in relation to the work expended in
responding to the pleading, motion, or other paper.

0x00A7 623. Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting
agencies

[15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681s-2]

(a) Duty of Furnishers of Information to Provide Accurate Information

(1) Prohibition

(A) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors. A person shall not
furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency
if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the

information is inaccurate.

(B) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors. A person shall
not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency
if

(i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the

person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and

Case 1:10-cv-00965-WJ -LFG Document 14 Filed 01/07/11 Page 4 of 24

(ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.

(C) No address requirement. A person who clearly and conspicuously specifies to
the consumer an address for notices referred to in subparagraph (B) shall not be
subject to subparagraph (A); however, nothing in subparagraph (B) shall require a
person to specify such an address.

(D) Definition. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "reasonable cause to
believe that the information is inaccurate" means having specific knowledge,
other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable
person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.

(2) Duty to correct and update information. A person who

(A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one
or more consumer reporting agencies about the person's transactions or
experiences with any consumer; and

(B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person
determines is not complete or accurate, shall promptly notify the consumer
reporting agency of that determination and provide to the agency any corrections
to that information, or any additional information, that is necessary to make the
information provided by the person to the agency complete and accurate, and
shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any of the information that remains not
complete or accurate.

(3) Duty to provide notice of dispute. If the completeness or accuracy of any
information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is

disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the

information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such

information is disputed by the consumer.

Case Law to Support private right of action under 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681s-2(a),
Dornhecker ro. Ameritech Corp., 99 F. Supp. 2d 918 (N.D. II]. 2000).

AUS. district court held that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et
seq., permits consumers to bring private causes of action against furnishers of
information to credit reporting agencies who fail to properly investigate disputed credit
information.

Here, a telephone services provider opened phone service accounts on behalf of third
persons who fraudulently used the names of other individuals. The provider subsequently
enlisted the services of collection agencies to satisfy the debts on the accounts. After
being made aware of the debts, the individuals whose names had been used notified the
credit reporting agencies of the fraud. After the individuals, collection agencies, and
credit reporting agencies notified the provider of the dispute, the provider reportedly
failed to investigate. The individuals sued the provider, alleging, among other claims, that
Defendant violated 1681s-2(b)(1) of the FCRA by failing to properly investigate the
disputed credit information. Defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that plaintiffs lacked
standing because the FCRA does not create a private right of action for consumers.
Denying the motion, the court agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court's analysis-set
forth in Cort v. Ash, 95 S. Ct. 2080 (1975) for determining whether an implied private
right of action exists under a statute. The four factors are: whether (1) the plaintiffis a

member of a class for whose benefit the statute was enacted; (2) the legislative history

indicates congressional intent, explicit or implicit, either to create or deny such a remedy;
(3) implying a private remedy would frustrate the underlying purposes of the legislative
scheme; and (4) the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law.

May it please the Court: the Plaintiff has disputed with the Defendant Capital One Auto
and The Credit Reporting Agencies in the same time period and has attached proof to this
Motion of these mailings via certified mail to both the Defendant and the credit bureaus.
The question is that during the investigation did the Defendant "talk" to the Bureaus and
vice versa how does anyone know without proof? Defendant claims they did an
investigation this is hearsay no proof other than their statement. Why did the Defendant
not provide this alleged investigation information to the Plaintiff after they had done their
alleged investigation? Most likely if they had it may have prevented this suit.

53. SCHILLER, J. February , 2003

54. In its motion, Sears contends that Plaintiff's claim under the FCRA should be dismissed
because consumers have no private right of action against a credit furnisher under 15
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681s-2(b). In the alternative, Sears argues that Mr. Sheffer's allegations are
legally insufficient because Plaintiff has failed to allege that a credit reporting agency has
sent a dispute verification form to Sears, Sears also moves for the dismissal of Mr.

Sheffer's defamation claim, arguing that the claim is preempted by the FCRA.

 

55. With respect to the issue of whether 0x00A7 1681s-2(b) creates a cause of action for a consumer
against a furnisher of credit information, Sears correctly notes that courts have reached

different conclusions. However, a clear majority of courts that have addressed this issue

 

has "effectively recognized Congress' obvious intent [to] create a private cause of action
through 0x00A7 1681s-2." Vazquez-Garcia v. Trans Union De P.R., Inc., 222 yen. Supp. 2d 150,
155 (D.PR. 2002); see also Nelson v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Corp., 282 F.3d 1037,
1058 (9th Cir. 2002) (describing purpose of 0x00A7 1681s-2(b) as "provid[ing] some private
remedy to injured consumers"). The reasoning in support of the majority view has been
aptly summarized:

56. The civil liability sections, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681n and 16810, explicitly provide a private
right of action for consumers wishing to enforce any provision of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act against "any person" who either "willfully fails to comply" or is "negligent
in failing to comply." Absent any explicit limitation, the plain language of 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7
1681n, 16810, 1681s-2(b) and (c) provide a private right of action for a consumer against
furnishers of information who have willfully or negligently failed to perform their duties

upon notice of a dispute. Furthermore, the negative inference of explicitly precluding a

Case 1:10-cv-00965-WJ -LFG Document 14 Filed 01/07/11 Page 8 of 24

consumer's right of action for violations of 0x00A7 1681s-2(a) is that they are preserved in 0x00A7
1681s-2(b). Accordingly, the plain language of the Fair Credit Reporting Act compels the
conclusion that there is a private right of action for consumers to enforce the investigation
and reporting duties imposed on furnishers of information.
Defendant Capital One Auto, that the Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim upon which
relief can be granted:
In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted, courts must accept as true all of the factual allegations pleaded in the complaint
and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. See Bd. of Trs. of
Bricklayers & Allied Crafismen Local 6 of N.J. Welfare Fund v. Wettlin Assocs., Inc., 237
F.3d 270, 272 (3d Cir. 2001).
Furthermore, a motion to dismiss will only be granted if it is clear that relief cannot be
granted to the Plaintiff under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the
complaint's allegations. See Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467U.S. 69, 73 (1984) (citing
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957); Erickson, 127 S.Ct. at 2200.
In Erickson...

In Erickson, the Supreme Court stressed the pro se status of the plaintiff

in Erickson - a far cry from the highly sophisticated antitrust counsel in

Bell Atlantic: The Court of Appeals' departure from the liberal pleading

standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is even more pronounced in this

particular case because petitioner has been proceeding, from the

litigation's outset, without counsel. A document filed pro se is "to be

liberally construed," Estelle {[v. Gambie], 429 U.S. [97] at 106, 97 S.Ct.

285, and " a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to
less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers," ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted). Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f) (".... All
pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice").
And
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only " a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."
Specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only "give the Co-
Defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it
rests." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 US. ----, ----, 127 S.Ct. 1955,
--- L.Ed.2d ----, ---- - ---- (2007) (slip op., at 7-8) (quoting Conley v.
Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). In addition,
when ruling on a Defendant's motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as
true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint. Bell Atlantic
Corp., supra, at 1955, 127 0x00A7.Ct. 1955 (slip op., at 8-9) (citing
Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 334 U.S. 506, 508, n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152
L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827,
104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct.
1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974)). Erickson, 127 S.Ct. at 2200.

The Plaintiff has disputed with the Furnisher/Defendant and the Credit Bureaus in the

same time frame certified mailings attached.

Case 1:10-cv-00965-WJ -LFG Document 14 Filed 01/07/11 Page 10 of 24

The OCC, Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, OTS, NCUA, and the FTC (Agencies) issued a
joint final rule (Final Rule) under Section 312 of the Fair and Accurate Credit
Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act
(FCRA). Section 623 of the FCRA describes the responsibilities of persons that furnish
information about consumers (furnishers) to credit reporting agencies (CRAs). The Final
Rule addresses the accuracy and integrity of reported information and furnishers'
responsibility to reinvestigate disputes based on direct disputes from consumers.
Furnishers are also required to establish policies and procedures to implement the

requirements.

The Final Rule became effective on July 1, 2010.

Policies and Procedures

The Final Rule requires furnishers to establish and implement reasonable written policies
and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers
furnished to a CRA. The policies and procedures must be appropriate to the nature, size,
complexity, and scope of the furnisher's activities.

Furnishers must consider the accuracy and integrity guidelines (in the Appendix of each
Agency's regulation) in developing policies and procedures. Furnishers must also review
them periodically and update them as necessary, but an audit requirement is not imposed.
Not all of the guidelines must be implemented.

According to the guidelines, furnishers' policies and procedures should identify areas that

compromise the accuracy or integrity of reported information, evaluate the effectiveness
