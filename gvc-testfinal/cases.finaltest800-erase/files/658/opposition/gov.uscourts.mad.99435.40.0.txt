FED.R.CIV.P. 60

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Normally, interlocutory orders such as the partial denial of a summary judgment motion

are not grounds for relief pursuant to Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See
Aguiar-Carrasquill v. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19 (lst Cir. P.R. 2006). Indeed, an order granting
summary judgment which adjudicates rights of fewer than all the parties is merely interlocutory
and not a final judgment. Gagne v. Carl Bauer Schrauben Fabrick, Gambh, 595 F.Sup. 1081
(D.C. Me. 1984); however, while a motion to reconsider an interlocutory order is not governed
by Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), it is within the discretion of the trial court to review. United Mine
Workers of America 1974 Pension Trust v. Pittston Co., 793 F.Sup. 339 (D.D.C. 1992).
III.

ARGUMENT
DEFENDANT’S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE THE SUMMARY
JUDGMENT RECORD SUPPORTS CLAIMS OF POLITICAL
DISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO PLAINTIFFS LYNCH, MOSCONE,
BERGERON, ELLIS, BARNES AND GRENNON
The plaintiffs address defendant’s concern which “contains numerous material factual

assertions that are not supported by the summary judgment record” (Defendant’s memorandum
pages 2-3).
The plaintiffs address each specific contention made by the defendant.
A.

PLAINTIFF LORNE LYNCH

The defendant alleges that the reference to her being “pissed off” at Lynch for attending a
fundraiser for her opponent Steven Murphy in East Boston has no immediate source in the
record. Furthermore, the defendant argues that there is no reference anywhere in the record that
defendant Cabral knew that Lynch had attended the fundraiser for Murphy.

On the contrary, Lynch’s deposition indicates a conversation that he had with Captain
Janelis indicating that Superintendent Eugene Sumpter made a comment that alluded to Cabral’s
knowledge of both Janelis’ and Lynch’s attendance at a fundraiser for Murphy in East Boston.
To the extent that there is no reference to the use of the phrase “pissed off” by the sheriff in the
plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion, Exhibit A of the instant memorandum indicates the
conversation that Lynch had with Cabral’s subordinate Superintendent Eugene Sumpter.
Lynch’s conversation is directly with Superintendent Murphy who indicated that he was aware
of people supporting Murphy and that those people who supported Murphy “were looking to
gain something out of it through Murphy being there.” (Exhibit A, p. 184).
Lynch then commented that he knew that Captain Janelis had been brought into an office
the day after the election to discuss Janelis’ own attendance at the Murphy fundraiser in East
Boston (Id. at p. 186). Lynch indicated that Janelis had told him that Janelis had been called into
Sumpter’s office along with a Captain Casey and a Jerry Walsh, and that part of the discussion
with Sumpter and Janelis had been the political event that both Janelis and Lynch attended (Id. at
p. 188). Based on this conversation with Janelis, based on this conversation with Sumpter and
Janelis, Lynch rightfully believed that the administration – including defendant Cabral – was
aware of Lynch’s support of her opponent Murphy (Id. at p. 188-189).
There is no intention by the plaintiff, Lynch, or his counsel to deceive the Court with
respect to the use of the phrase “pissed off.” As Lynch has stated, he believed that the defendant
had received a donation list of supporters who had donated money to her opponent, Murphy (Id.
at p. 189). Moreover, the clarification of the use of the phrase “pissed off” is expressed in the
attached Affidavit of Lorne Lynch (see Affidavit of Lorne Lynch).
With respect to there being no evidence in the summary judgment record that Cliff

Page 4 of 7

Carney told the plaintiff that “Cabral considers two types of good standing those who do their
job well and those support her,” the defendant is correct in saying that there is no support for this
entire quote. However, the defendant has misinterpreted the quote as attributed to Carney.
The plaintiffs do not allege that Carney uttered that “there are two types of good standing,
those who do the job well and those who support her,” but rather allege that Carney indicated
“there’s two types of good standing.” The defendant’s reference to the remaining part of the
phrase “those who do their job well and those who support her” is simply argument by the
plaintiffs as to what Carney’s intent was by the use of the phrase “two types of good standing.”
At no point does Lynch try to have this Court believe that, in fact, Carney said “two types of
good standing, those who do their jobs well and those who support her.” What Carney said was,
in fact, that there was “two types of good standing” (Exhibit A, p. 193). The remaining part of
the phrase is simply argument used by the plaintiffs to emphasize exactly what Carney meant by
the use of that phrase. As Lynch indicated later, what he assumed that Carney meant by the use
of the phrase “two types of good standing” that there was “political and union activity and the
way you do your job.” (Id. at p. 193).
B.

PLAINTIFF ALBERT MOSCONE

The defendant indicates that “there is no evidence in the summary judgment record that
Sheriff Cabral was aware that Moscone contributed $200.00 of his own money to Murphy’s
campaign . . .” To the contrary, as alluded to with respect to the deposition testimony of Lynch,
there was a “donation list” in which Lynch alluded Sheriff Cabral had received (Exhibit A, p.
189). Moreover, it is undisputed that Moscone had a fundraiser for Sheriff Cabral’s opponent
Steven Murphy in the 2000 race for the Suffolk County Sheriff’s position and made phone calls
on behalf of Murphy soliciting the support of others for Murphy’s candidacy. (Moscone

Page 5 of 7

deposition, p. 104). Defendant’s statement that plaintiff Moscone testified that he believed that
he had sent a $200.00 check to the Murphy campaign (Exhibit B, Moscone deposition, pp. 107108) and Lynch’s assertion that there was a donation list held by defendant Cabral of all of the
donations made to the Murphy campaign which support his retaliation claim.
Moreover, to the extent that the defendant claims that here is only “inadmissible hearsay”
evidence of any knowledge of Cabral that Moscone was supporting Murphy, defendants own
memorandum indicates that there was a direct conversation between Moscone and Cabral
concerning the 2004 campaign for Suffolk County Sheriff in which Moscone telephoned Cabral
and told her that he was not supporting Murphy (Moscone deposition, p. 126, defendants’
Exhibit 19, defendants’ undisputed facts nos. 207 and 208).
C.

PLAINTIFF DAVID BERGERON

Bergeron supported Murphy, and it is obvious that at the September 14, 2004 Democratic
primary, he held a sign for Murphy at the Holy Name School and had an interaction with the
defendant (Defendant’s Memorandum p. 7; see Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’
Opposition to Defendant Cabral’s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 18; see also Plaintiffs’
Exhibit 6 at pp. 81-86).
Finally, the defendant’s statement that the “Court mischaracterizes the interaction
between Steve Thompkins and plaintiffs Barnes and Grennons” and “Michael Harris’ testimony
regarding the extent to which support for Steven Murphy was a consideration in recommending
the names of 37 employees for decommissioning” is simply misplaced. The fact that Thompkins
indicated to Barnes and Grennon that they faced the prospect of losing their homes is knowledge
of the sheriff’s retaliation simply because of Thompkins position to the sheriff. The fact that it
may have occurred one year prior to both plaintiffs being decommissioned misses the point. It is

5

Case 1:05-cv-11661-RGS

Document 40

Filed 03/24/2008

Page 6 of 7

not the length of time between what Thompkins said and the actions taken by defendant Cabral,
but the fact that Thompkins said that Barnes and Grennon could face the prospect of losing their
homes, that is important and relevant to the plaintiffs’ claim against Cabral of retaliation.
The decommissioning of the plaintiffs is, in fact, an employment condition resulting in
the plaintiffs being reduced to “an unreasonably inferior position.” Stripping the plaintiffs of
their deputy sheriff’s commissioned status has resulted in a monetary loss to the plaintiffs
because they are now forbidden to work details, for which the status of being a deputy sheriff is
required. This situation has resulted in being rendered an “unreasonably inferior” position.
Agosto DeFeliciao v. Aopnte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1217-20 (lst. Cir. 1989 en banc). See also
Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayaguec, 467 F.3d 16, lst. Cir. 2006; Tores-Martinez v. Puerto Rico
Department of Corrections, 485 F.3d (19 lst Cir. 207). The plaintiffs were, in fact, deprived of
the benefit of deputy sheriff and the assignment of details which would logically lead a
reasonable person to conclude that they have established a “unreasonably inferior” work
environment.
Courts have held that depriving an employee of all or most of his work for an indefinite
period can be sufficient to establish an “unreasonably inferior work environment.” See RosarioUrdaz, 433 F.3d at 179 (“utterly depriving an employee of work indefinitely . . . might make out
a claim”); Gonzalez-Pina v. Rodriguez, 407 F.3d 425, 432 (lst Cir. 2005) (holding that such facts
were more than a scintilla of evidence, but reserving the question of whether they established
unreasonably inferior conditions); Rivera-Jimeenez v. Pierluisi, 362 F.3d 87, 94095 (lst Cir.
2004) (denial of benefits and assignments sufficient to show adverse action); Rodriguez-Pinto v.
Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 40 (lst Cir. 1993) (finding that plaintiff had made out a prima facie
case of political discrimination where “since his reassignment, plaintiff only has been assigned

clerical tasks which take ten minutes a day to perform.)
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons expressed above, the plaintiffs’ Motion for Relief from Judgment

Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 must be denied.

AFFIDAVIT OF LORNE LYNCH
I, Lorne Lynch, do hereby swear and depose the following:
1. After the September 2004 election, and sometime before February of 2005, I had a
conversation with Superintendent Sumpter in which he inferred that the administration was
aware of my support for Sheriff Cabral’s opponent Steven Murphy;
2. I indicated to Superintendent Sumpter during the course of this conversation that I had
no personal gain with respect to my support for defendant Cabral’s opponent Murphy and I
indicated that I supported him because I thought he was going to be a better sheriff;
3. Sometime in September of 2005, after the primary election, I had a conversation with
Captain Janelis and he indicated that he had been called into Superintendent Sumpter’s office and
questioned about his attendance and my attendance at a fundraiser for Murphy in East Boston.
