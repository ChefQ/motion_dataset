I INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs summary judgment motion is an ill-conceived attempt to adjudicate a series of
legal theories she asserts in her Second Amended Complaint ("SAC"), which are not supported
by law or fact. Generally, Plaintiff makes three arguments in her motion, none of which entitles
her to summary judgment.

Plaintiff contends that the Indemnification Agreement is (1) an invalid release, (2) an
improper indemnification of BOH's allegedly wrongful conduct, and (3) not a ratification of
Niroula's signatures on Plaintiff's checks. Separately, she repeats these arguments and raises
others in four sections each seeking either a declaratory judgment or rescission of the
Indemnification Agreement, but she is not entitled to either form of relief.

As to her three principal contentions, Plaintiff's release and indemnification arguments are
irrelevant, because BOH does not contend that the Indemnification Agreement is a release nor
that Plaintiff should indemnify BOH for its own alleged misconduct. Rather, BOH makes two
contentions that, when Plaintiff withdrew her forgery claims, (1) she ratified Niroula's signatures
as authorized to withdraw funds from her account and (2) she is precluded by Commercial Code 0x00A7
4-406(f) from pursuing any claims based on the allegedly forged checks. Neither defense
involves a release or an indemnification.

Plaintiff's most telling (and perhaps dispositive) admission in her summary judgment brief
and supporting declaration is that the $890,000 replacement check which Niroula gave her to
repay her for $508,000 in forged checks, included "an additional amount as an apology." S. J.
Mot. at 5:15; Hisamatsu Decl., { 5; emphasis supplied. Thus, for the first time, Plaintiff admits
that her motive for withdrawing her forgery claims was not merely to be repaid or "minimize her
losses," as she argues, but because she thought she was also receiving a $372,000 premium
payment "as an apology."

Plaintiff was apparently blinded by the prospect of this sizeable windfall. The Court may
recall from her SAC that she admits Citibank told her when she deposited the $890,000 check that
it would not clear for three days, or until October 25, 2006. SAC, | 40. However, on October 25,

2006, without first calling Citibank to determine if the $890,000 check had cleared, Plaintiff

signed the Indemnification Agreement and had it faxed to BOH. See, SAC, {ff 40, 45, and 47. In
fact, Plaintiff did not call Citibank until October 31, six days later, to learn that Niroula's
replacement check had not cleared. See, SAC, 47.

Plaintiff proffers many theories why withdrawing her three forgery claims should not be
construed as a ratification of Niroula's forged signatures, but none of these is viable. Having
withdrawn her forgery claims to BOH's substantial detriment, Plaintiff cannot here claim that her
actions should be rescinded and her funds returned, because she is not offering to and cannot
return BOH to the position it held before October 25, 2006.

Plaintiff's rescission-based summary judgment requests should be denied. To the extent
that the Court has any doubt about the invalidity of her summary judgment motion as a matter of
law, BOH requests pursuant to Rule 56(f), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that the Court deny
the pending summary judgment motion or continue the hearing so that BOH can conduct
discovery to establish that Plaintiff is not entitled to the relief she seeks.

Il. CHOICE OF LAW

Rather than duplicate them here, BOH refers the Court to its discussion of choice of law
issues in its motion to dismiss the SAC.
i. ISSUES ADDRESSED

0x00B0 BOH does not contend that the Indemnification Agreement is a release;

0x00B0 BOH does not contend that the Indemnification Agreement exculpates BOH for its

own alleged misconduct;

0x00B0 By withdrawing her forgery claims, Plaintiff ratified Niroula's signatures as

authorized to withdraw funds from her account;

. Declaratory relief is not appropriate; and

0x00B0 Rescission is not appropriate.

IV. DISCUSSION
A. BOH Does Not Contend That The Indemnification Agreement Is A Release

liability to Plaintiff on the forged checks.' But BOH does not contend that the Indemnification
Agreement is a release, so this issue is not in dispute.
B. BOH Does Not Contend That The Indemnification Agreement Exculpates
BOH For Its Own Allegedly Wrongful Conduct

Plaintiff claims that the Indemnification Agreement violates the Civil Code 0x00A7 1668
prohibition against relieving oneself of responsibility for fraud or willful injury to another. A
collateral effect of the Indemnification Agreement is to ratify the forger's signature and to
preclude Plaintiff's forgery claims, but those are not the kind of exculpations that Civil Code
0x00A7 1668 forbids. Plaintiff cites no authority to the contrary.

Relying on Queen Villas Homeowners Association v. TCB Property Management, 149
Cal.App.4th. 1 (2007), Plaintiff also argues that an indemnity agreement between two parties
cannot exculpate one of those parties for its own wrongdoing. Plaintiff misunderstands BOH's
position. BOH is not asserting an indemnity claim or defense in this action.

C. By Withdrawing Her Forgery Claims, Plaintiff Ratified Niroula's Signatures

As Authorized To Withdraw Funds From Her Account

A forged signature does not bind an account holder, such as Plaintiff, because it is not
authorized by her. Commercial Code 0x00A7 3-403(a). However, a check signed by someone other
than the account holder is not a forgery, if the account holder authorizes a third party to sign for
her. Commercial Code 0x00A70x00A7 3-401 (a) and 1-201(41) .

By withdrawing her forgery claims as to all $508,000 in allegedly forged checks, Plaintiff
in effect advised BOH either that she signed the three checks or that Niroula, an authorized
representative, did so. Commercial Code 0x00A7 3-403(a) ("An unauthorized signature may be ratified
for all purposes of this division."). As does California law, Hawaii law recognizes that an
account holder can ratify an otherwise unauthorized signature and waive her legal claim involving
an allegedly forged check. Hawaii Revised Statutes 0x00A7 490:3-403(a).

Plaintiff filed three timely forgery claims (Exh. "A" to SAC) alleging that Niroula stole
$508,000 from Plaintiff's BOH deposit account in Honolulu. If Plaintiff's forgery claims had

proven accurate, and she had done nothing more, BOH as the payor bank would have been liable

to return all of the stolen funds to her upon verification of the forgeries:

A payor bank's initial liability to its customer for making payment
of a check on a forged signature is absolute; that is, it applies
without regard to whether the bank exercised due care or was
negligent or worse. Roy Supply v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 39
Cal.App.4th 1051, 1062 (1995) ("Roy Supply"); emphasis supplied.

But Plaintiff did not rest with filing three forgery claims, and her additional conduct forms
the basis upon which her summary judgment motion should be denied, and the SAC should be
dismissed without leave to amend. After Plaintiff swore under oath that Niroula was a forger and
a thief, she flew to San Francisco at Niroula's request (not BOH's) to meet Niroula there and to
recover her stolen funds. SAC, { 39. Plaintiff does not allege that BOH encouraged her to
exercise this self-help remedy, nor does she allege that she informed BOH that she intended to
meet Niroula in San Francisco for any purpose.

The Court may recall that, in opposition to BOH's previous motion to dismiss Plaintiff's
FAC, Plaintiff argued, but did not allege, that BOH "coerce[d] her to investigate and negotiate
with an identity thief and a forger solely to escape payment on the unauthorized transactions."
Opp. at 17:19-22. The Court found that such an allegation, if made in the SAC, would be
persuasive to support her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. January 10, 2008
Order (the "Order'") at 18:19-21.

However, Plaintiff does not include that allegation in the SAC Instead, she alleges that
"At no time did BOH inform Plaintiff that she need not investigate or use self-help in order to
have her claims at BOH paid." SAC, { 39; emphasis supplied. BOH's failing to inform her not
to deal with Niroula, when BOH had no knowledge that that was her plan, is not tantamount to
"coercing" her to "investigate and negotiate with a thief." Moreover, that allegation is nothing
more that an argument that BOH owed her a duty to advise her about her legal rights, which this

Court soundly rejected in its Order (at p. 9 and passim). A depository bank has no such duty to

 

? Bank's counsel did a word search of the SAC and cannot find any allegation that BOH
"coerce[d] [Plaintiff] to investigate and negotiate with an identity thief and a forger solely to
escape payment on the unauthorized transactions."

What Plaintiff does allege in the SAC is this: At Niroula's request, she flew to San
Francisco after she had sworn three forgery affidavits accusing him of being a thief and a forger.
SAC, {ff 38, 39. While in San Francisco, Plaintiff allegedly again fell under Niroula's criminal
spell. SAC, 0x00A70x00A7 39-47, 127, 128. While apparently spellbound, she accepted an $890,000
replacement check from Niroula to repay the $508,000 in funds he stole from her, from which she
hoped to be repaid in full and recover a bonus as an apology. SAC, { 40; Hisamatsu Decl., {{ 5.

Niroula deposited the replacement check into Plaintiffs Citibank account. SAC, { 40.
Plaintiff admits that Citibank told her, and she knew, that the $890,000 check would not be
good funds for three days. Id.

Without first checking to see if the $890,000 check had cleared, on the third business day
after the deposit, Plaintiff withdrew her forgery claims and instructed BOH to release the
suspended funds in Niroula's BOH account. SAC, { 45. Plaintiff could easily have called
Citibank to determine that the $890,000 replacement check was no good. She inexplicably failed

to do so before executing the Indemnification Agreement and withdrawing her forgery claims.

Plaintiff acted in spite of the many warning signs that should have alerted her not to trust
Niroula:
0x00B0 Niroula made multiple real estate investment proposals to Plaintiff, which she

rejected (SAC, { 15);
0x00B0 Niroula stole her personal checks (SAC, {J 12, 20);
0x00B0 Niroula forged her signature on $508,000 worth of her checks (SAC, { 12);
0x00B0 Niroula repeatedly lied to her about meetings he allegedly set up for Plaintiff with

an immigration attorney (SAC, { 47);

0x00B0 Niroula lied to her about his family's not being able to wire replacement funds to

Hawaii (SAC, { 37);

 

> Similarly, Plaintiff complains that no one at BOH explained the meaning of the Indemnification
Agreement to her. SAC, 0x00A7 46. BOH had no such duty. Order at 9. And her concession that
BOH did not explain the Agreement to her eliminates any claim she might assert that BOH gave
her a "partial" explanation, which she might argue would require BOH to make additional
disclosures.

0x00B0 Niroula lied to her about his sister's alleged kidnapping and ransom (SAC, { 41);
and
0x00B0 Niroula lied to her about a threat on Plaintiff's life (SAC, { 41).
From the following SAC allegation, the Court can see why Plaintiff went to San Francisco
and why she withdrew her forgery claims:
In the event Defendant Niroula returned her family savings,
Plaintiff intended to withdraw her claims to BOH (Exs A.1, A.4
and A.7). If not, Plaintiff reasonably believed that she was still
protected by her pending claims at BOH and the bank's assurance

of an investigation in its claim forms. SAC, { 39; emphasis
supplied.

Plaintiff's allegation reveals that she was willing to withdraw her forgery claims on the
unproven assumption that Niroula had repaid her and also paid her a sizeable bonus as an
apology, without verifying that her assumption was correct. Her belief that she could withdraw
her forgery claims and continue to assert them as pending was not "reasonable," as she asserts.
See, SAC, { 39.

The Indemnification Agreement is written verification of Plaintiff's intention to allow
Niroula to withdraw funds from her account. When a party permits another to withdraw funds
from her account, she has ratified his signature as authorized for that purpose. Commercial Code
