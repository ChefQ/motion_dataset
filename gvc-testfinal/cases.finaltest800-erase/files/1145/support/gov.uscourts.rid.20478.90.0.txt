MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF SHIRLEY SCHUMACHER’S MOTION
TO ALTER OR AMEND JUDGMENT GRANTING FAIRFIELD RESORTS INC.’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Shirley Schumacher (“Plaintiff”) submits this Memorandum of Law in
support of her Motion to Alter or Amend the judgment issued by this Court on March 27, 2008.
The Court rejected Magistrate Judge Martin’s Report and Recommendation applicable to
Plaintiff’s discriminatory demotion claims issued June 8, 2007 and granted Fairfield Resorts
Inc.’s (“Fairfield”) motion for summary judgment to the extent that these claims are based on
plaintiff’s demotion while employed by Fairfield.
Pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff respectfully
submits that this Court should consider altering or amending its findings. The Court held that
Plaintiff failed to produce any evidence that an adverse employment action was taken against
her. Plaintiff submits that there is documentary evidence in this case that shows the following;
(1) Plaintiff was demoted from managing supervisor of sales associates to a lesser paying
position of sales associate; (2) that Plaintiff’s demotion adversely altered her terms and
conditions of employment; and (3) the demotion caused Plaintiff personal, professional and

physical harm that ultimately required treatment by her physician. Accordingly, for the
foregoing reasons explained more fully below, Plaintiff respectfully request that the Court Alter
its judgment and vacate its order granting Fairfield summary judgment with regard to her
demotion claims.
BACKROUND AND STANDARD OF REVIEW
In support of her motion to Alter or Amend, Plaintiff relies upon and incorporates by
reference herein the facts set forth in Magistrate Judge Martin’s Report and Recommendation
as well as the documentary evidence previously filed with the Court in support of Plaintiff’s
objection to defendant Fairfield’s motion for summary judgment.
Motions to Amend or Alter a judgment are appropriate where the court misunderstood
the facts, a party’s arguments, or the controlling law. Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d
1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000)
ARGUMENT
I. The Plaintiff had an adverse employment action taken against her when she was told
that she was no longer a manager before leaving for a scheduled vacation.

Plaintiff is able to point to the following evidence to support her claim that her demotion
was an adverse employment action taken against her after she complained of discriminatory
treatment by her supervisor Joseph Hutnick (“Hutnick”).( Plaintiff’s Aff. ¶ 4)
In January 2004, Plaintiff was employed by Fairfield as a sales manager supervising a
team of sales associates which varied in number from nine to thirteen as manager she
received a salary of $24,000 a year plus commissions. (Plaintiff’s Fairfield Deposition
(Plaintiff’s Dep.”) at 26-27, 32-33).

On or about February 1, 2004 Plaintiff was told by Hutnick that she was demoted from
sales manager to sales associate. (Plaintiff’s Dep. at 106) Her demotion is memorialized in
Fairfield documents that include a personnel chart describing the actual effective date of her
demotion to “sales associate” as January 31, 2004. (Plaintiff’s Fairfield Affidavit, Exhibit, 1)
and a Personnel Action Form dated February 11, 2004 that identifies her new job title as
“Sales Associate”. (Plaintiff’s Fairfield Affidavit Exhibit, 5) These documents were offered
by the Plaintiff as evidence of her discriminatory demotion and cited by Magistrate Judge
Martin in his Report and Recommendation (“R&R”) issued June 8, 2007 denying Fairfield’s
motion for summary judgment, to the extent that Plaintiff’s discrimination claims were based
on her demotion. (R&R at 22) It should be noted to the court that the effective date of
Plaintiff’s demotion was January 31, 2004 prior to her leaving for scheduled vacation.
A.

Plaintiff’s terms and conditions of employment were adversely effected by her
Demotion.
The demotion to Sales Associate removed the Plaintiff from her salaried status as a Sales

Manager at a loss of $24,000 a year and substantially reduced her duties and responsibilities
as a result. (Plaintiff’s Dep. at 78)
B.
Plaintiff sustained personal, professional and physical harm as a
consequence of her demotion.

To the extent that Plaintiff’s gender and age discrimination claims against Fairfield are
based on her demotion, such claims are viable and Fairfield’s Motion as to such claims should be
denied. (R&R at 58) Plaintiff’s supervisor Mr. Hutnick demoted her following her complaints of
his discriminatory treatment. Plaintiff’s Fairfield Affidavit (“Plaintiff’s Affidavit.”) ¶ 4,

Plaintiff’s demotion to sales associate and the loss of her salaried status caused her to become
very depressed and to obtain medical treatment from Dr. James D. Gloor. (Plaintiff’s Dep. at 8991) She went on disability leave due to stress from work. (Plaintiff’s Dep. at 76)

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should alter its judgment and vacate its order
granting Fairfield summary judgment with respect to the demotion claims asserted in Counts I,
II, IV, and V of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint.
