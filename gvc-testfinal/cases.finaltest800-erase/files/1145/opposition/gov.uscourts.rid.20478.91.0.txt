DEFENDANT FAIRFIELD RESORTS, INC.’S OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO ALTER OR AMEND JUDGMENT
Pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and LR Cv 7(b),
Defendant Fairfield Resorts, Inc. (“Fairfield”) hereby objects to plaintiff Shirley Schumacher’s
Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment entered in favor of Fairfield on March 27, 2008.
Fairfield objects to the plaintiff’s motion on the grounds that she does not satisfy the requisite
standard for alteration of the judgment under Rule 59(e). Furthermore, this Court properly
entered summary judgment, and later final judgment, in favor of Fairfield. In support of its
Objection, Fairfield relies on the accompanying Memorandum of Law.

DEFENDANT FAIRFIELD RESORTS, INC.’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN
SUPPORT OF ITS OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO
ALTER OR AMEND JUDGMENT
Defendant Fairfield Resorts, Inc. (“Fairfield”) submits this Memorandum of Law in
support of its Objection to plaintiff Shirley Schumacher’s Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment.
On March 27, 2008, this Court granted Fairfield’s Motion for Summary Judgment and entered
final judgment in favor of Fairfield on all counts of the plaintiff’s complaint. (Document Nos.
88, 89).1
After never responding to Fairfield’s Objection to the Report and Recommendation
issued on June 8, 2007 that recommended granting Fairfield’s Motion for Summary on all claims
except the discriminatory “demotion” claims, plaintiff now objects to the grant of summary
judgment and entry of final judgment in favor of Fairfield as to these claims. Fairfield submits
that plaintiff’s motion should be denied on the grounds that she fails to meet the standard for

This Court also entered summary judgment and final judgment in favor of defendant CORE, Inc. on all counts of
the plaintiff’s complaint, but this aspect of the Court’s order is not the subject of plaintiff’s Motion to Alter or
Amend the Judgment entered on March 27, 2008.

altering or amending a judgment under Rule 59(e), and because this Court properly concluded
that Fairfield’s discriminatory “demotion” claims fail as a matter of law.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On July 17, 2006, Fairfield and its co-defendant, CORE, Inc., each moved for summary
judgment on all counts of the plaintiff’s complaint. On August 10, 2006, plaintiff filed her
responses to the defendants’ motions for summary judgment.2 After holding a hearing on the
motions, on June 8, 2007, Magistrate Judge David L. Martin issued a Report and
Recommendation (the “R&R”), which granted Fairfield’s motion for summary judgment on all
Counts, except for Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5, to the extent that those claims are based on plaintiff’s
alleged demotion. (R&R at 61). On June 22, 2007, Fairfield objected to the R&R to the extent
that it recommended denial of Fairfield’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to plaintiff’s claims
based on her alleged demotion. Plaintiff never responded to Fairfield’s objection.
On March 27, 2008, this Court adopted the R&R with the exception of the denial of
summary judgment on the demotion claims in Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5, and further held that
Fairfield’s motion for summary judgment should be granted as to all counts of the plaintiff’s
complaint. (Document No. 88). As the basis for holding that plaintiff’s demotion claims fail as
a matter of law, this Court held that plaintiff failed to present any evidence that (1) she suffered
an adverse employment action relative to her demotion claims given that she never returned to
work after being told that, following her scheduled vacation, she would be relieved of her
managerial duties; (2) she suffered any change in her working conditions, salary, or other terms
of employment; and (3) she sustained any damages as a result of the prospect that she would be

Following the filing of these briefs, the Court ordered all parties to re-file the documents to comply with the page
limitations set forth in the Pretrial Order. The plaintiff and defendants later re-filed their papers.

relieved of her managerial duties upon returning to her employment. This Court entered final
judgment on March 27, 2008.
On April 9, 2008, following entry of the Court’s order granting summary judgment and
the entry of final judgment in favor of Fairfield, plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Alter or
Amend the Judgment.
ARGUMENT
Motions to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) “must either clearly establish a
manifest error of law or must present newly discovery evidence.” F.D.I.C. v. World Univ., Inc.,
978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1992); see Cruz v. Clock Island Parasail, Inc., C.A. No. 05-336-S, 2006
WL 3488702, at *2 (D.R.I. Nov. 30, 2006) (citing cases). This court has made clear that “Rule
59(e) motions are for the purpose of reconsideration, not initial consideration.” DeSenne v.
Jamestown Boat Yard, Inc., 781 F. Supp. 866, 869 (D.R.I. 1991) (emphasis in original); Santiago
v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998) (“A Rule 59(e) motion is aimed at
reconsideration, not intitial consideration, and may not be used to argue a new legal theory.”)
(internal quotations omitted).
In this case, plaintiff has failed to present any manifest error of law or newly discovered
evidence that would warrant the alteration or modification of the judgment entered in this case.
As grounds for reversing the judgment in favor Fairfield on the demotion claims, plaintiff argues
that she suffered an adverse employment action on account of her “demotion” because (1) she
was demoted from managing supervisor to the position of sales associate; (2) the demotion
adversely altered the terms of her employment because she was to receive a lower salary; and (3)
she was damaged because the loss of her salaried status caused her to suffer depression and
obtain medical treatment. (Motion to Alter Judgment at 5 – 6). In so arguing, plaintiff ignores

the critical fact that this Court based its decision in part on the fact that plaintiff was never
actually demoted. As Fairfield argued in its Motion for Summary Judgment, and again in its
Objection to the R&R, the plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action because she
never returned to work at Fairfield after leaving for her scheduled vacation. (See Fairfield’s
Objection to R&R at 6). The Court’s reliance on that fact when it dismissed the plaintiff’s
demotion claims is hardly a manifest error of law. Indeed, the Magistrate Judge recommended
dismissal of the plaintiff’s state and federal FMLA claims based on the related fact that plaintiff
claimed that she was unable to return to work until after her FMLA leave period expired – a
point of law that this Court adopted in granting Fairfield’s Motion for Summary Judgment and
which the plaintiff never contended was in error after losing that point in the R&R.
In an attempt to escape the fatal flaws that are inherent in her demotion claims, plaintiff
argues in her motion that she was in fact demoted prior to leaving for vacation and therefore she
suffered an adverse employment action. This conclusory argument, however, fails to take into
account the uncontested fact that she never returned to work, a fact which this Court in part
based its decision to grant Fairfield summary judgment. (See March 27, 2008 Order Granting
Summary Judgment, Document No. 88). Moreover, despite the plaintiff’s representations to the
contrary, the Magistrate Judge never relied on this evidence to support denial of the Motion for
Summary Judgment as to the demotion claim and the plaintiff never made the argument to this
Court. See DeSenne, 781 F. Supp. at 869 (denying motion under Rule 59(e), reasoning in part
that “[p]laintiff, in the present motion, relies to a great extent on arguments and facts that could
have been raised in her opposition to the original motion to dismiss but, inexplicably were not”).
Indeed, she never even responded to Fairfield’s Objection to the R&R, instead waiting until after
this Court entered final judgment to point to materials in the factual record never relied on

previously. Accordingly, plaintiff’s Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment in favor of Fairfield
should be denied.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and the analysis previously set forth in Fairfield’s Motion for
Summary Judgment and its Objection to the Report and Recommendation, plaintiff’s Motion to
Alter or Amend the Judgment should be denied.
