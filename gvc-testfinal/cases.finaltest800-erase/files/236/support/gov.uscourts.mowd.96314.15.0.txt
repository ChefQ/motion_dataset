Case No. 4:10-CV-00906-GAF

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6)
Defendant Robin Carnahan for Senate, Inc. (the "Carnahan Campaign"), moves pursuant
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), to dismiss the copyright infringement claim of
Defendant Fox Network News Network LLC (the “Fox Network”) Count I of the Complaint, for
failure to meet a necessary filing precondition.
In support, Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act provides in relevant part that "no civil
action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title."
17 U.S.C. § 411(a). However, Plaintiffs filed the complaint herein before the Fox Network had
filed a completed copyright application with the Copyright Office. Because the Fox Network
commenced its copyright claim prematurely, the Court cannot grant the Fox Network relief on its
copyright infringement claim and must therefore dismiss this claim. If this filing precondition
problem is not resolved, the validity of this lawsuit and any rulings made herein may be

questioned. The Carnahan Campaign has finished running, and thus ceased, television
broadcasting of the advertisement in question, and if the case proceeds, it could place the Court
and parties in the unusual situation of litigating a lawsuit never properly initiated as to broadcasts
of a political advertisement that have already terminated.
Additionally, because no copyright registration is attached to the Complaint, the Fox
Network has obscured the issue of the extent to which the materials used by the Carnahan
Campaign in its television political advertisement even fall within the Fox Network's copyright.1
This motion is supported by the pleadings and papers on file in this matter, and the
supporting Suggestions, as well as the Declaration of William C. Rava ("Rava Decl.") filed with
the Suggestions.
