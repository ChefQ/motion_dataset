Case No. 4:10-cv-00906-GAF

DEFENDANT’S SUGGESTIONS SUPPORTING MOTION
TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6)
Introduction
In this case, plaintiffs Fox News Network, LLC (the "Fox Network") and Christopher
Wallace ("Wallace") (together, "Plaintiffs") are attempting to use intellectual property and
Missouri tort laws to stifle core political speech in the heat of this election season. Defendant
Robin Carnahan for Senate, Inc. (the "Carnahan Campaign") is prepared to establish that its use
of a January 2006 Wallace interview of Rep. Roy Blunt (the "2006 Interview") is prototypical
fair use and that Wallace's tort claims are invalid.
But before even reaching those arguments on the merits, pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court should dismiss the Fox Network's copyright infringement
claim for failure to meet a necessary filing precondition. In particular, Plaintiffs filed the
complaint before Fox Network had filed a completed copyright application with the Copyright
Office. Because Fox Network commenced its copyright claim prematurely, the Court cannot

Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 1 of 10

grant the Fox Network relief on its copyright infringement claim and must therefore dismiss this
claim.
This motion is supported by the pleadings and papers on file in this matter as well as the
Declaration of William C. Rava ("Rava Decl.") filed herewith.
Factual Background
On September 15, 2010, Plaintiffs filed the complaint that initiated this litigation.
(Dkt. # 1.) The Complaint alleges that the Carnahan Campaign infringed the Fox Network's
copyrighted work and violated Wallace's rights of privacy and publicity by using portions of the
2006 Interview to criticize Rep. Roy Blunt, who is currently running against Robin Carnahan for
the Unites States Senate. Compl. ¶ 10. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs do not allege that a copyright
registration has issued on the 2006 Interview. Nor do they allege that they have filed a
completed copyright application with the Copyright Office. Instead, they allege simply that "[a]n
application for the United States copyright registration for the [2006] Interview is on file with the
United States Copyright Office under Case No. 1-487233081." Compl. ¶ 10.
The Fox Network's copyright application was not complete when it commenced this
litigation on September 15, 2010. The Fox Network, through counsel, apparently initiated an
online application on September 15 or 16 and presumably paid the associated registration fee at
that time. See Rava Decl. ¶4 and Ex. A thereto. The Copyright Office did not receive the
deposit materials necessary to complete the application until September 20, 2010, and did not
make the registration publicly available until September 24, 2010. Rava Decl. ¶ 5. The
registration (No. PAu3-480-604) includes an effective date of registration of September 20,
2010, the date on which the Copyright Office received the deposit material required to complete
the application. Id., Ex. A. The registration appears to claim copyright in all content of the

January 16, 2006, Fox News Sunday news program, and appears not to identify any materials
within that program as coming from other sources, such as stock photos or public domain photos.

ARGUMENT
PLAINTIFF FOX NETWORK HAS NOT MET THE STATUTORY PRECONDITION
TO ITS COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AND HAS NOT
PRODUCED THE REGISTRATION DEFINING ITS COPYRIGHT RIGHTS
The Fox Network has failed to meet, and cannot meet, the statutory precondition for a
copyright infringement lawsuit. (Section 1, below.) Moreover, the Fox Network’s failure to
provide the registration certificate upon which it bases its claim hampers consideration of this
case by the Court and the Carnahan Campaign. (Section 2, below.) For these reasons, this
action should be dismissed, or, at least, the Fox Network should be required to amend its
Complaint, showing full satisfaction of all filing preconditions, and attaching the copyright
registration certificate upon which it bases its copyright claim.
I. The Court Should Dismiss the Fox Network's Copyright Infringement Claim Because
the Fox Network Had Not Complied With the Filing Precondition Specified in the
Copyright Act.
The Fox Network's copyright infringement claim should be dismissed for failure to meet
a necessary precondition to commencing litigation. Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act
provides in relevant part that "no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United
States work shall be instituted until pre-registration or registration of the copyright claim has
been made in accordance with this title." 17 U.S.C. § 411(a). The Supreme Court recently held
that, although it "does not restrict a federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction," section 411(a)'s
registration requirement is a "precondition to filing a claim." Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,
130 S. Ct. 1237, 1241 (2010).

-3Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 3 of 10

As shown above, the Fox Network had not registered its copyright as of September 15,
2010, the date it filed this lawsuit. A registration was not issued on the relevant application until
on or about September 25, 2010, and it bore the effective date of September 20, 2010 (apparently
the date when the Fox Network filed the last of the required submissions for its application). The
Fox Network clearly did not have a complete copyright application on file with the Copyright
Office on September 15, 2010.
Although the Eighth Circuit has not yet taken a position on whether it is sufficient to have
filed a completed copyright application, or to have received a registration certificate (or
rejection) from the Copyright Office, see, e.g., Tri-Marketing, Inc. v. Mainstream Marketing
Services., Inc., 2009 WL 1408741 (D. Minn. May 19, 2009) at **2-3 ("recognize[ing] the split of
authority on this issue and not[ing] that it is aware of no Eighth Circuit case directly on point");
Cosmetic Ideas, Inc. v. IAC/InteractiveCorp., 606 F.3d 612, 615-16 (9th Cir. 2010) (describing
the conflicting approaches); TVI Inc. v. Infosoft Techs., Inc., 2006 WL 2850356 (E.D. Mo. Sept.
29, 2006) (same), there is no question that a complete copyright application is at least necessary.
"[T]he copyright owner may not sue for infringement under the federal Copyright Act until the
owner has delivered 'the deposit, application, and fee required for registration' to the United
States Copyright Office, a branch of the Library of Congress." Action Tapes, Inc. v. Mattson,
462 F.3d 1010, 1013 (8th Cir. 2006). In Action Tapes, the Eighth Circuit determined that section
411(a) barred a plaintiff's claims for additional protection for certain computer software
copyrights because the plaintiff failed to prove that it had properly applied for registration of the
computer program copyrights and deposited the required source codes before initiating its
lawsuit. Id. at 1013-14.

-4Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 4 of 10

In addition, since the Reed Elsevier decision, numerous district courts have dismissed
copyright infringement claims where the plaintiff has failed to allege that it had filed a completed
application with the Copyright Office before filing the complaint. See, e.g., Kruska v. Perverted
Justice Foundation Inc., 2010 WL 3210847 (D. Ariz. Aug. 9, 2010); TI Training Corp. v. FAAC,
Inc., 2010 WL 2490535 (D. Colo. June 15, 2010); Dawes-Lloyd v. Publish America, 2010 WL
3431663 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2010); Axxiom Mfg. v. McCoy Investments, Inc., 2010 WL 2545584
(S.D. Tex. June 21, 2010) (but granting plaintiff leave to amend).
These decisions comport with and reflect the Copyright Act itself. Section 410(d)
provides in relevant part that "The effective date of a copyright registration is the day on which
an application, deposit, and fee . . . have all been received in the Copyright Office." And section
411(a) further provides that, "In any case, however, where the deposit, application, and fee
required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and
registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if
notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights." See also
17 U.S.C. §§ 407, 408 (requiring deposit of work); 410 (requiring the Register of Copyrights to
consider the deposited material in issuing certificates of registration); 37 C.F.R. 202.20-24
(prescribing rules pertaining to deposit of work). Simply put, an application for copyright
registration is not complete – and the putative registrant therefore cannot initiate litigation,
whatever circuit he might happen to reside in – unless and until the Copyright Office receives the
deposit copy of the work.
Here, the Complaint did not and could not allege that the Fox Network owns a copyright
registration in the 2006 Interview. Instead, Paragraph 10 alleges only that the Fox Network had
an application on file. As of September 15, 2010, however, the day that the Fox Network filed

-5Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 5 of 10

the complaint, the Fox Network did not have a completed application on file with the Copyright
Office. Rava Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5. The effective date of the registration is five (5) days later –
September 20, 2010 – the date on which the Copyright Office finally received all the materials
required by the Copyright Act and related federal regulations in order to examine the application
and make a decision on issuance. 17 U.S.C. § 410(d); Rava Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. A. Thus, the Fox
Network's copyright application was not complete when it commenced this litigation. The Fox
Network therefore cannot prove that it met the preconditions to filing its copyright infringement
claim, and the Court should dismiss this claim.
If this filing precondition problem is not resolved, the validity of this lawsuit and any
rulings made herein may be questioned. In fact, the Carnahan Campaign has completed running,
and thus ceased, television broadcasting of the advertisement in question, and if the case
proceeds, it could place the Court and parties in the unusual situation of litigating a lawsuit never
properly initiated as to broadcasts of a political advertisement that have already terminated.
II. The Lack of a Proper Copyright Registration Hampers the Ability of the Court and the
Carnahan Campaign to Address the Fox Network's Copyright Claim.
The Fox Network's premature filing is more than a technical failure. Because the Fox
Network could not – and therefore did not – attach a completed copyright application (or, better
still, a registration certificate with the related application materials) to the Complaint, the Fox
Network has obscured the issue of whether all of the elements of the 2006 Interview used by the
Carnahan Campaign even fall within the Fox Network's copyright.
Moreover, because of Section 411 of the Copyright Act, copyright registrations are
typically attached to complaints for copyright infringement. The registrations define the legal
right upon which a plaintiff is suing, and define its scope. Particularly with respect to works that
incorporate public domain materials and works of others, registration certificates are essential,

-6Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 6 of 10

because material described on the copyright form as pre-existing works identify content for
which the claimant is not making a copyright claim.
For example, this suit involves the Fox Network's copyright claim with respect to a 24second segment from an hour-long interview program. The Carnahan Campaign believes that
certain creative content contained on approximately half of the 24-second clip does not fall
within the Fox Network's copyright claim. Specifically, for about one-half of the length of the
clip used, the only photographic material portrayed is a photograph of Rep. Blunt that appears to
have been taken from C-SPAN footage of the floor of the House of Representative, which, by
virtue of C-SPAN’s contract with the House, is a public domain photograph:

It is essential for a proper copyright registration to distinguish between the copyright claimant’s
original creative work, for which copyright can be claimed, and pre-existing works of others, for
which the claimant has no right and may not assert infringement.
The Carnahan Campaign believes that the photo shown on the two frames above
(representative of about half of the short clip from the Fox Network used in the Carnahan
Campaign political advertisement at issue here) is a public domain photograph. If the Fox
Network's copyright application correctly acknowledges that the 2006 Interview contained such

-7Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 7 of 10

public domain materials,1 that will facilitate consideration of the Carnahan Campaign's fair use
defense. Indeed, it is highly relevant, in the opinion of the Carnahan Campaign, not only that it
used a very small portion of the copyrighted program (about 24 seconds from an hour-long
program, less than 1% of the program), but that 50% of even that small segment was dominated
by a public domain photograph. Thus, if the Fox Network has accurately disclosed on its
copyright application its use of public domain materials, its submission of the copyright
registration will materially aid consideration of the Carnahan Campaign's fair use defense.
Alternatively, if the Fox Network has not disclosed its use of public domain and third
party copyrighted materials, as appears from the tardy copyright registration form that the
Carnahan Campaign was able to find recently, that is also highly relevant. If the Fox Network
claimed copyright in all of the content of the January 16, 2006, Fox News Sunday program,
including public domain photos such as those shown above, then the Fox Network's failure to
disclose its use of public domain material, and disclaim copyright protection for them, may
suggest that the Fox Network has made a knowingly overbroad copyright claim. Alternatively, if
the Fox Network justifies its failure to disclose its use of public domain material on the ground
that such use was not “substantial,” that too is highly relevant—for if the Fox Network's use of
more than 24 seconds of public domain material is not substantial, then the Carnahan Campaign's
1

Copyright registration forms contain a field for entry of information concerning whether the
material for which copyright is claimed may be an derivative work or compilation. The standard
Copyright Office instructions for such fields states, among other things, that the claimant should describe
pre-existing materials incorporated within the work for which copyright is claimed:
General Instructions: Complete space 6 if this work is a “changed version,”
“compilation,” or “derivative work,” and if it incorporates one or more earlier
works that have already been published or registered for copyright or that have
fallen into the public domain.

(emphasis added).

-8Case 4:10-cv-00906-GAF Document 16 Filed 10/08/10 Page 8 of 10

use of 24 seconds of the Fox Network's material, half of which was focused on that public
domain material, would also not be substantial for copyright infringement purposes. Whatever
the Fox Network's position as to the public domain material, it will be highly relevant for many
purposes, including assessing the good faith of the copyright claim, a relevant factor in a fair use
determination. Field v. Google, Inc., 412 F. Supp.2d 1106, 1122 (D. Nev. 2006) (considering
“good faith” as factor in fair use). The good or bad faith of the copyright claimant is also
relevant to the determination of whether fees should be assessed against such a copyright
claimant. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 535 (1994) (in considering fee requests under
section 505 of the copyright act, courts should consider “frivolousness, motivation, objective
unreasonableness (both in the factual and in the legal components of the case) and the need in
particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.”).
Conclusion
Plaintiffs' premature filing is fatal to its copyright infringement claim. Moreover,
disclosure of the copyright application and registration will promote the best handling of this
action. Accordingly, the Carnahan Campaign requests that the Court dismiss this action, or,
alternatively, require the Fox Network to amend its Count I, and include therein as exhibits its
copyright application and registration upon it seeks to rely.
