CONCISE STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE PRESENTED
Under the holding and rules of contract construction set forth in the
unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in M & G Polymers
USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135 S. Ct. 926 (2015), are the Plaintiffs entitled to retiree
health benefits only for the duration of the 1998 Collective Bargaining Agreement,
rather than to vested lifetime health benefits as this Court and the Sixth Circuit
ruled before the Supreme Court’s decision?

INTRODUCTION
Over seven years ago, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary
judgment on liability, ruling that their health benefits are vested for life. (R. 214,
Op. & Order 24.) The Sixth Circuit affirmed that vesting ruling. Reese v. CNH Am.
LLC, 574 F.3d 315, 321−24 (6th Cir. 2009) (“Reese I”), but the case has remained
alive and active due to the Sixth Circuit’s ruling that CNH may make reasonable
changes to Plaintiffs’ benefits. Both this Court and the Sixth Circuit grounded their
vesting decisions in UAW v. Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F.2d 1476 (6th Cir. 1983), and
decisions following it. On January 26, 2015, however, the Supreme Court of the
United States swept away Yard-Man as well as all the precedents and rules of
construction that have grown out of it. M & G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135
S. Ct. 926 (2015). Equally if not more important, the Supreme Court set forth new
rules of construction that now govern, in all circuits, the determination of whether
retiree health benefits are vested. Because the Supreme Court has overruled the
basis for the decision that Plaintiffs’ benefits are vested, and because application of
the new rules of construction to the terms of the 1998 Collective Bargaining
Agreement (“CBA”) show that the benefits are not vested as a matter of law,
summary judgment for Defendants is now appropriate. 1

1

The law of the case doctrine does not apply when an intervening decision
of a superior court undercuts the basis of a prior ruling. See Agostini v. Felton, 117
(continued . . .)

Set forth below are the undisputed facts—terms of the 1998 CBA—that are
now material under the new legal regime. Following the undisputed facts is a
discussion of Tackett, and why it requires entry of summary judgment for
Defendants on the vesting decision.
STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS 2
1.

The plaintiff class comprises individuals who retired from CNH or its

predecessor after July 1, 1994, but on or before April 1, 2005, as well as spouses
and dependents of those retirees. (R. 223, Stip. Order ¶ 5.)
2.

Plaintiffs currently receive their health benefits pursuant to the 1998

Group Benefit Plan (“GBP”), even if they retired while earlier CBAs were in

S. Ct. 1997, 2017 (1997) (because the case “would be decided differently under our
current [] law, we think adherence to [its prior decision] would undoubtedly work a
‘manifest injustice,’ such that the law of the case doctrine does not apply”); see
also United States v. Anglin, 601 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir. 2010) (explaining that the
law of the case doctrine is “not absolute;” two intervening Supreme Court
decisions undermined the district court’s conclusion, and the court must reconsider
it in light of these decisions). Defendants also respectfully submit that the prior
deadline of April 14, 2014, for filing summary judgment motions should not be
binding, and urge that the deadline be waived for the filing of this important
motion. At a minimum, the intervening decision of the Supreme Court in Tackett
constitutes good cause for allowing CNH to file its motion now. See Fed. R. Civ.
P. 16(b)(4).
2

The parties conducted substantial discovery in this case on the issue of
vesting. All of the relevant materials have been produced and depositions taken. As
demonstrated below, under Tackett the terms of the CBA control the decision in
this case, and silence on the duration of benefits defeats vesting. Tackett, 135 S. Ct.
at 937.

effect. See Reese I, 574 F.3d at 324; (1998 GBP § 6(I)(1)(a), (b)(c) (Ex. A).)
Specifically, the 1998 GBP provides that:
Employees who retire under the Case Corporation Pension Plan for
Hourly Paid Employees after 7/1/94, or their surviving spouses
eligible to receive a spouse’s pension under the provisions of that
Plan, shall be eligible for the Group Benefits as described in the
following paragraphs.
(1998 GBP § 6(I)(1)(a) (Ex. A) (emphasis added)); see also Reese I, 574 F.3d at
322 (quoting provision).
3.

The 1998 GBP “r[a]n concurrently with” and was a part of the 1998

Central Agreement. (1998 Cent. Agmt. art. 14 § 4 (Ex. B).) The Central Agreement
expired on May 2, 2004. (Id. art. 15); see also Reese I, 574 F.3d at 318.
4.

During negotiations in 2004 and 2005, the UAW deviated from its

previous bargaining practice, under which it moved existing retirees from each
expiring GBP to the next effective GBP. See Reese I, 574 F.3d at 324. Rather, the
UAW refused to negotiate benefits for existing retirees, so upon expiration of the
1998 GBP, Plaintiffs were not included in the 2005 GBP. (See R. 125 Ex. X, UAW
2004 Mins. 34–39.)
5.

No contributions were required of eligible retirees during the term of

the 1998 Central Agreement. (1998 GBP § 6(I)(3)(b)(1) (Ex. A)); see also Reese I,
574 F.3d at 318. The parties, however, entered a letter of understanding that states:
“[O]ver the term of the 1998 labor agreement . . . retirees who are
enrolled in a Company offered HMO, PPO or other plan will not have
3

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 7 of 16

Pg ID 16609

to pay any additional employee contributions above those which may
be required for enrollment in the Case Network Plan (if any).”
Reese I, 574 F.3d at 319 (emphasis added) (quoting “Cost of Healthcare Coverage”
Letter, 1998 GBP 79 (Ex. A)).
ARGUMENT
Summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to
any material fact” and the moving party “is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When the movant demonstrates that there are no
genuine disputes of material fact, “the burden shifts to the non-moving party to
present specific facts to prove that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Golden v.
Kelsey-Hayes Co., 954 F. Supp. 1173, 1182 (E.D. Mich. 1997); accord Matsushita
Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) (same).
I.

TACKETT SETS FORTH NEW RULES FOR VESTING
DECISIONS.
A.

Tackett Repudiated Yard-Man and All Rules of Construction
Derived From It.

In Tackett, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously 3 vacated
and remanded the Sixth Circuit’s decision that the retirees’ benefits in that case
3

All nine justices joined the Opinion of the Court in Tackett. Justice
Ginsburg expressly joined that Opinion and concurred; she did not merely “concur
in the result.” A concurrence that joins the Opinion of the Court carries no formal
precedential weight and, to the extent it departs from the majority opinion, the
majority opinion governs. See, e.g., Int’l Union, UAW v. Winters, 385 F.3d 1003,
1011–12 (6th Cir. 2004) (refusing to apply principles in concurring opinion, the
(continued . . .)
4

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 8 of 16

Pg ID 16610

were vested. It did much more than merely vacate and remand that case, however.
The Court expressly rejected the Yard-Man inference and all the rules of contract
construction that have grown up around it. First, the Court carefully reviewed the
reasoning of the Yard-Man decision itself, noting its determinations that the “will
provide” language “was ambiguous,” that inclusion of provisions for terminating
active employees’ coverage contrasted with the absence of provisions for
terminating coverage for the retirees, that a promise deemed applicable to some but
not all retirees was “illusory,” and that the “context” of retiree health benefits made
them “status benefits” which were unlikely to be left to future negotiations. 135
S. Ct. at 934.
Then, the Court discussed decisions following Yard-Man and the additional
rules of construction that have evolved, including holdings that the phrase “will
continue to provide” benefits unambiguously vests benefits, that a general
durational clause “‘says nothing’” about the duration of retiree benefits, and—of
author of which concurred in the majority opinion); accord, e.g., United States v.
Angel-Guzman, 506 F.3d 1007, 1012 n.7 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that majority
opinion governs over concurring opinion that joins in the majority). When “an
individual justice’s vote is not needed to form a majority, the meaning of a majority
opinion is to be found within the opinion itself because the gloss that an individual
[j]ustice chooses to place upon it is not authoritative.” B.H. ex rel. Hawk v. Easton
Area Sch. Dist., 725 F.3d 293, 310 (3d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Justice Ginsburg’s suggestion that certain rules of construction might
survive is inconsistent with the Opinion of the Court, and consequently is owed no
deference.
5

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 9 of 16

Pg ID 16611

particular importance here—that provisions tying eligibility for retiree health
benefits to receipt of pension benefits indicate that retiree health benefits are
vested. Id. at 934–35 (quoting Noe v. PolyOne Corp., 520 F.3d 548, 555 (6th Cir.
2008)).
Following this review, the Court repeatedly made clear that it rejected “the
inferences applied in Yard-Man and its progeny.” Id. at 935; see also id. at 933 (the
Yard-Man “inferences conflict with ordinary principles of contract law”); id. at 936
(“[T]he Court of Appeals [in Tackett] misapplied other traditional principles of
contract law . . . .”). Because the Sixth Circuit in Tackett had relied upon the
“context” of negotiations and on “the tying of eligibility for health care benefits to
receipt of pension benefits” as indicating vesting, the Supreme Court “rejected
[those] Yard-Man inferences as inconsistent with ordinary principles of contract
law,” and vacated the decision. 135 S. Ct. at 937. In short, none of the rules of
construction in Yard-Man or its progeny survive.
B.

Tackett Sets Forth Ordinary Rules of Contract Construction That
Govern This Case.

The Court also set forth rules of construction that must now govern
construction of CBAs, including:
•

“Parties . . . can and do voluntarily agree to make retiree benefits a
subject of mandatory collective bargaining,” id. at 936;

•

Congress determined in ERISA that “retiree health care benefits are
not a form of deferred compensation,” id.;
6

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 10 of 16

Pg ID 16612

•

The rule that general durational clauses do not govern retiree health
benefits “distort[s] the text of the agreement and conflict[s] with the
principle of contract law that the written agreement is presumed to
encompass the whole agreement of the parties,” id.;

•

The illusory contract doctrine does not apply if some but not all
retirees obtain a promised benefit, id.;

•

It is a “traditional principle that courts should not construe ambiguous
writings to create lifetime promises,” id.;

•

It is also a “traditional principle that ‘contractual obligations will
cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining
agreement,’ ” id. at 937 (quoting Litton Fin. Printing Div., Litton Bus.
Sys., Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190, 207 (1991)); and

•

“[W]hen a contract is silent as to the duration of retiree benefits, a
court may not infer that the parties intended those benefits to vest for
life,” id. at 937.

At least as significant as these rules of construction is the contrast drawn by
the Supreme Court between its disapproval of the Yard-Man inference favoring
vesting for collective bargaining agreements and its approval of the Sixth Circuit’s
decision disfavoring vesting for non-collectively bargained contracts. It quoted
with approval Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F.3d 388, 400 (6th Cir. 1998):
“‘Because vesting of welfare plan benefits is not required by law, an employer’s
commitment to vest such benefits is not to be inferred lightly; the intent to vest
must be found in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express
language.’” 135 S. Ct. at 937 (emphasis added). The Court reiterated later that “‘a
collective-bargaining agreement [may] provid[e] in explicit terms that certain

7

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 11 of 16

Pg ID 16613

benefits continue after the agreement’s expiration.’” Id. (quoting with alteration
Litton, 501 U.S. at 207) (emphasis added).4
Thus, the rules of construction that govern this case are no longer to be
found in Yard-Man and the decisions that followed it. Rather, the governing rules
are set forth in Tackett. The new rules of construction dictate a result in this case
opposite from the one founded on Yard-Man and its progeny.
II.

THE CORRECT CONSTRUCTION OF THE 1998 GBP
UNDER TACKETT IS THAT CNH DID NOT AGREE TO
PROVIDE PLAINTIFFS WITH VESTED BENEFITS.
A.

The Vesting Decision in This Case Relied on the Repudiated
Yard-Man Rules.

This Court’s decision granting summary judgment to Plaintiffs on vesting
(R. 214) expressly relied on Yard-Man and decisions following it, including Yolton
v. El Paso Tennessee Pipeline Co., 435 F.3d 571 (6th Cir. 2006). Of particular
importance was the precept that language tying eligibility for health care benefits
to receipt of pension benefits “speaks directly to duration: as long as the employee
or surviving spouse is eligible to receive a pension (which is presumed to be a
lifetime benefit).” (R. 214, Op. & Order 14 n.9.) This Court rejected a number of

4

Again, to the degree that Justice Ginsburg’s concurring opinion attempted
to put a gloss on the unanimous Opinion of the Court by stating that “no rule
requires ‘clear and express’ language in order to show that the parties intended
health-care benefits to vest,” 135 S. Ct. 938 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), her
comments carry no weight. (See note 3 above.)
8

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 12 of 16

Pg ID 16614

arguments advanced by CNH (id. at 14−23), but its basis for holding the benefits
vested was the Yard-Man inference and the tying of health benefits to pension
benefits.
The Sixth Circuit affirmed the vesting decision. Reese I, 574 F.3d at 321–24.
It observed that the Yard-Man inference provides a least “a nudge in favor of
vesting in close cases,” id. at 321, and also considered the prior Yolton decision
conclusive, id. at 322. The Sixth Circuit concluded:
Like Yolton: this case involves a CBA; it involved a health-care
benefits plan with identical language [to Yolton] concerning
entitlement to benefits upon retirement; it ties eligibility for health
benefits to eligibility for a pension; it does not contain a specific
durational clause while other benefit provisions in the CBA contain
such clauses . . . ; and above all it concerns employees who worked in
virtually identical circumstances . . . as the Yolton employees before
each group retired.
574 F.3d at 323. It emphasized “the centrality of the tying rationale in Yolton’s
merits determination and in cases before and since.” Id.
The Supreme Court directly and emphatically rejected each of these
rationales. As shown, it rejected the notion that collectively-bargained contracts
should be construed differently than non-collectively bargained contracts. 135
S. Ct. at 937. Decisions requiring that a CBA “include a specific durational clause
for retiree health care benefits to prevent vesting” “distort the text of the agreement
and conflict with the principle of contract law that the written agreement is
presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties.” Id. at 936. Whereas
9

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 13 of 16

Pg ID 16615

the Sixth Circuit in Tackett had, following the Yard-Man precedents, relied on the
“ ‘context of . . . labor-management negotiations,’ ” and “the tying of eligibility for
health care benefits to receipt of pension benefits,” the Court “reject[ed] the[se]
Yard-Man inferences as inconsistent with ordinary principles of contract law.” Id.
at 937; see also id. at 935 (reviewing rulings holding that general durational
clauses do not control retiree health benefits and that tying of eligibility for health
benefits to pension benefits requires vesting, but then stating: “We disagree with
the Court of Appeals’ assessment that the inferences applied in Yard-Man and its
progeny represent ordinary principles of contract law.”).
B.

Tackett Requires Summary Judgment for Defendants on the
Vesting Issue.

After removing the Yard-Man inferences that underlay the earlier vesting
decisions, the new rules governing contract interpretation defeat vesting as a matter
of law. First and foremost, the 1998 GBP contains “no clear and express” language
agreeing to vest Plaintiffs’ benefits, as required by the Supreme Court’s decision.
Tackett, 135 S. Ct. at 936−37; (see pages 7–8 above; SUMF ¶¶ 2–3, 5). Moreover,
the the1998 GBP—when viewed in its entirety—was not silent. It ran concurrently
with, and was part of, the 1998 Central Agreement, which had a specific
termination date. (SUMF ¶ 3.) Under Tackett, this Court can no longer ignore this
general durational clause. See 135 S. Ct. at 936. To do so would conflict with “the
traditional principle that ‘contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course,
10

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 14 of 16

Pg ID 16616

upon termination of the bargaining agreement.’” Id. at 937 (quoting Litton, 501
U.S. at 207). But even if the GBP were deemed silent on the duration of Plaintiffs’
benefits, “when a contract is silent as to the duration of retiree benefits, a court
may not infer that the parties intended those benefits to vest for life.” 135 S. Ct. at
937. Courts must not ignore the “traditional principle that courts should not
construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises.” Id. at 936 (citing 3A
Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 553, at 216 (1960)).
As for the “tying rationale,” the Supreme Court twice rejected the notion that
the tying of eligibility for health benefits to receipt of pension benefits indicated
vesting. It did so first in its review of general rules of contact construction that
have grown out of Yard-Man. See 135 S. Ct. at 935. It did so again in the final
section of the Opinion when it specifically rejected the Sixth Circuit’s reliance on
the tying analysis in Tackett. Id. at 937. In view of the “centrality of the tying
rationale” to the vesting decision in this case, Reese I, 574 F.3d at 323, the vesting
decision cannot stand.
In summary, under the ordinary principles of contract interpretation set forth
in Tackett, and contrary to the previous rulings of this Court and the Sixth Circuit,
the undisputed material facts as evidenced by the 1998 GBP demonstrate that
Plaintiffs’ health benefits were not vested as a matter of law. Accordingly, because
of the intervening and controlling decision of the Supreme Court of the United
11

2:04-cv-70592-PJD-PJK Doc # 439 Filed 02/24/15 Pg 15 of 16

Pg ID 16617

States in Tackett, CNH respectfully requests this Court to enter summary judgment
that Plaintiffs’ benefits expired upon expiration of the 1998 CBA, on May 2, 2004,
and are not vested.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, CNH urges the Court to grant its motion for
summary judgment.
