Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 208 Filed 01/29/10 Page 2 of 6

Memorandum of Points and Authorities
1. Background
On July 23, 2008, the defendant was charged via a 50 count indictment in this case. The

indictment addressed defendant's criminal conduct, in part, from on or about January 1, 2005,

 

through on or about April 15, 2008. On August 3, 2008, defendant was arrested near his
apartment in the Northern District of California. Defendant has been in custody since that date.
Since his arrest, the government has offered tojenter into plea negotiations with four attorneys
who have been assigned to represent defendant, including the initial defense attorney who was
appointed in the Northern District of California. In each case, counsel was apparently unable
to establish a working relationship wherein plea negotiations could be initiated. In each case,
the government understands that its desire to negotiate a potential resolution of the case pretrial
had been relayed to defendant by each of the four defense attorneys. In the interim, the
government continued to investigate defendant's conduct during the period covered by the
indictment and from April 15, 2008 through August 3, 2008. This investigation has been aided
by the materials found during the course of search warrants executed at defendant's California
apartment and storage unit. It has also released well over 10,000 pages of discovery for the
defendant to review. The original 50 count indictment, while significant, did not fully charge
and address all of defendant's criminal conduct within the subject time periods.

In December 2009, the government received notice of defendant's request to represent
himself. In light of the fact that up to that time, defendant had expressed no interest in entering
into plea negotiations, the government notified |the defendant of its intent to seek a superseding
indictment in the case. Via letter dated December 22, 2009, the government formally notified
defendant of its intent to file a superseding indictment in the case due to the fact that it appeared
that a pretrial resolution of the case appeared extremely unlikely (defendant to that date had
given the government no indication of any other reasonable resolution of this case pursuant to

a plea agreement). The December 220x2122 notice also advised defendant that the government was

willing to postpone seeking a superseding indictment in the case if he wished to enter into
serious plea negotiations to resolve all pending matters, with or without cooperation.

Via letter dated January 2, 2010, defendant communicated with the government, advised
that he was willing to discuss the issue of vindictive prosecution once he was granted pro se
status. The defendant did not offer to enter into plea negotiations in the letter. On January 7,
2010, defendant was permitted by the Court to represent himself. During the hearing on that
date, the government outlined, in detail, its willingness to enter into plea negotiations with
defendant, with or without cooperation. Via defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of "Motion
to Unseal Proceedings" signed by defendant on January 8, 2010, defendant indicated that he had
no interest in cooperating with the government, he was innocent and has absolutely no
information of interest for the government. Via letter dated January 14, 2010, the government
restated, in greater detail, the defendant's options regarding a reasonable pretrial resolution of
this case pursuant to a plea agreement, with or without cooperation with the government
(including a possible global settlement). In so doing, the government again offered to enter into

plea negotiations with defendant, with or without cooperation, and offered to extend the time for

the seeking of a superseding indictment past January 2010. The government, in light of the total

 

lack of interest defendant had expressed to th

defendant a deadline of January 21, 2010, in

date into entering into plea negotiations, gave

order to respond prior to its wide ranging plea

overtures and the seeking of a superseding indictment in this case. The also government offered

to extend the deadline for plea negotiations and the superseding indictment if the defendant

indicated that he wished to enter into plea negotiations. Via letter dated January 18, 2010,

defendant expressed no interest in entering into

any form of reasonable plea negotiations in the

case and, in closing, advised the government as follows: "At this time, the government's only

option at a quick and non public resolution (i.e.; keeping quiet the Fourth and Fifth Amendment

violations) is Court ordered immunity, return c
fair reading of defendant's conduct and written

entering into reasonable plea negotiations and

yf some property, and immediate release." Any
statements to date is that he is not interested in

contends that he is innocent.

I. Discussion

 

Defendant contends that the government intends to seek a superseding indictment due to
the fact that he has ultimately decided to represent himself. This is entirely not the case, the sole
reason the government intends to seek a superseding indictment in this case is that it has waited
patiently since August 3, 2008, with an open offer to attempt to resolve this case short of trial
and to date has received absolutely no expression of interest from the defendant, or any of his
four prior defense attorneys, of resolving this case via a plea agreement. Moreover, the
defendant has been formally offered an extension of the plea offer deadline and the potential
date for a superseding indictment in writing, and the defendant has rejected the government's
overture.

The case law is quite simple, when a defendant rejects the government's plea offer, the
government may chose to supersede the indictment. See e.g., United States v. Garza-Juarez, 992
F.2d 896 F.2d (9" Cir. 1993); United States v. Gastelum Almeida, 298 F.3d 1167 (9" Cir. 2002);
and United States v. Stewart, 770 F.2d 825 (9" Cir. 1995). In this case, defendant has not even
been willing to enter into plea negotiations. There is no sense making an offer in a case as
complex and far reaching as this if the defendant is not even willing to seriously consider one.
Accordingly, a superseding indictment in this case will be sought for one reason only,
defendant's rejection of all overtures to reasonably resolve this case via a plea agreement. Any
such superseding indictment will simply more fully address the wide ranging unlawful conduct

of defendant prior to his arrest.
