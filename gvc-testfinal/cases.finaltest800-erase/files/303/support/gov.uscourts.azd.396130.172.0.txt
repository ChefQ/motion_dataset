Plaintiff, MOTION FOR COURT ORDER
PROHIBITING VINDICTIVE
Vv. SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT

Daniel David Rigmaiden,

 

Defendant.

ee a ae

 

 

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se,
respectfully requests that the Court prohibit the government from
superseding the defendant's indictment, based on alleged conduct
related to the alleged scheme and known to the government as of
December 22, 2009, if it results in an increase in the number or
severity of the charges in the current indictment. In order to
prevent the government from superseding the indictment for the
same vindictive reasons in the future, the defendant requests
that the Court's prohibition order apply permanently.

This motion is being made because the government plans to
vindictively supersede the defendant's indictment, in the last
week of January 2010, in response to the defendant exercising his
Sixth Amendment right to represent himself.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

 

MOTION FOR COURT ORDER PROHIBITING VINDICTIVE
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT

I. INTRODUCTION

In response to the defendant exercising his Sixth Amendment
right to represent himself, the government now vindictively seeks
a superseding indictment. According to AUSA Battista's December
22, 2009 fax, the government intends to supersede the defendant's
indictment in the last week of January 2010. The government is
unhappy with the defendant electing to proceed without counsel and
the government wishes to use a vindictive superseding indictment,
and the threat thereof, to entice the defendant into immediate
plea negotiations.

The defendant and the government are currently not engaged in
plea negotiations of any sort and there have been no plea offers
made by either side in the past. The government may only use the
threat of a superseding indictment, as a negotiation tactic, once
plea negotiations have already begun. The government may not use
such a tactic to entice the defendant to merely enter into plea
negotiations. In doing so, the government intends to punish the
defendant for exercising a Constitutional right and seeks to avoid
having to deal with a pro se defendant. According to relevant case
law, a superseding indictment of this nature, and at this time, is
considered vindictive. The government intends to supersede the
defendant's indictment to include conduct allegedly occuring over
20 months ago. The government's 20 month delay further supports

the defendant's claim of a vindictive superseding indictment.
 

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document172 Filed 01/12/10 Page 6 of 16

_ II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

 

The defendant was indicted on July 23, 2008 for conduct
allegedly occuring between January 1, 2005 and April 15, 2008. The
defendant's indictment charges 1 count of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 371,
"Conspiracy," 24 counts of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1343, "Wire Fraud," 24
counts of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1028A(a)(1), "Aggravated Identity Theft,"

1 count of 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1341, "Mail Fraud," and 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 981, 21
U.S.C. 0x00A7 853 and 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2461, "Criminal Forfeiture."

The defendant was arrested on August 3, 2008 in Santa Clara,
California. The defendant has been in the custody of the United
States Attorney, via the United States Marshals, since the time of
his arrest.

On December 2, 2009, the defendant filed a "Motion For Leave
To Proceed Pro Se And To Place Philip Seplow Into Advisory

a

Position." By filing the motion to proceed pro se, the defendant

exercised his Sixth Amendment right to represent himself and to
make his own defense personally.

On December 24, 2009, the defendant had an "in person" legal
visit at Corrections Corporation of America, Central Arizona
Detention Center (CCA-CADC) with his attorney, Philip Seplow
("Seplow"). The legal visit occured in "visitation 3" from roughly
9:00am to 9:40am. At the legal visit, Seplow informed the defendant
that the government plans to supersede the defendant's current
indictment unless the defendant enters into serious plea
negotiations in order to resolve the case. Seplow gave the defendant
a copy of a December 22, 2009 fax sent to Seplow by Assistant
United States Attorney Frederick A. Battista ("AUSA Battista").

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document172 Filed 01/12/10 Page 7 of 16

A copy of the fax is attached to this memorandum as "Exhibit 01."

AUSA Battista stated in the fax that the government had
received the defendant's motion to proceed pro se and Seplow's
response to that motion. AUSA Battista further stated that "the
government has been patiently waiting for the defendant to
establish a productive working relationship with a defense attorney
in order to attempt to successfully resolve this matter short of
trial via a plea agreement." Id. After making reference to the
"current posture of the case" (i.e., the defendant proceeding pro
se), AUSA Battista went on to state that "such a resolution is
extremely unlikely." Id. AUSA Battista then stated that, "[a]s a
result," he intends to supersede the indictment to include what he
refers to as "the defendant's unlawful conduct" between April 15,
2008 and August 3, 2008. AUSA Battista stated that the defendant's
indictment will be superseded "most likely in the last week of
January 2010" unless "the defendant wishes to enter into serious
plea negotiations to resolve all pending matters." Id.

Seplow was appointed counsel for the defendant shortly after
July 27, 2009. For roughly the past 5 months, Seplow and the
defendant have been engaged in a productive working attorney-client
relationship. During the course of their productive working
attorney-client relationship, the government has made no formal or
informal plea offers to the defendant. As of the filing date of
this motion, the government and the defendant have not entered
into any plea negotiations whatsoever and no offers have been

made by either side.

TIT. ARGUMENT

The defendant exercised his Sixth Amendment right to represent
himself by filing a motion to proceed pro se. In response to the
defendant exercising his Sixth Amendment right, the government now
vindictively seeks a superseding indictment unless the defendant
enters into immediate plea negotiations. In doing so, the
government intends to punish the defendant for exercising a
Constitutional right and seeks to avoid having to deal with a pro
se defendant. A superseding indictment of this nature is vindictive
and it must be prohibited.

"To establish a claim of vindictiveness, a defendant must make
a threshold showing that charges of increased severity were
brought because he exercised a statutory, procedural, or
constitutional right in circumstances that give rise to an

appearance of vindictiveness."' United States v. Gilbert, 266 F.3d

 

1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). "Once this threshold showing is made, the burden shifts
to the prosecution to demonstrate a non-vindictive reason for the
prosecution." Id.

Actual vindictiveness must play no part in a prosecutorial
decision and "since the fear of such vindictiveness may
unconstitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of [his rights],"
the appearance of vindictiveness must also be avoided. North

Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725 (1969); Blackledge v. Perry,

 

417 U.S. 21, 28 (1974). The need to avoid the appearance of

vindictiveness has taken the form of a presumption of prosecutorial
vindictiveness. See United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 373

4
Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 172 Filed 01/12/10 Page 9 of 16

(1982). In this section of the memorandum, the defendant will offer
proof to support both a presumption of vindictiveness and actual
vindictiveness.

A. The government may only use the threat of a
superseding indictment, as a negotiation tactic,
during ongoing plea negotiations.

When AUSA Battista threatened the superseding indictment, the
defendant was not engaged in ongoing plea negotiations with the
government, no discussions of plea agreements had ever occured in
the past, and neither side had ever made a plea offer. AUSA
Battista's threat of a superseding indictment is not justified by
a context of ongoing plea negotiations.

Threatening a superseding indictment is an acceptable plea
negotiation tactic if used by the government during ongoing plea
negotiations. "[S]uch prosecutorial conduct is not meaningfully
distinguishable from charging more strictly at the outset and
then reducing the charges as a result of plea negotiations."
United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 463 (9th Cir. 2000).
In Gamez-Orduno, the prosecutor sought a superseding indictment
during the course of ongoing plea negotiations and the superseding
indictment was the subject of negotiations between the two parties.
See id. at 462-63. "In the context of pretrial plea negotiations
vindictiveness will not be presumed simply from the fact that a
more severe charge followed on, or even resulted from, the
defendant's exercise of a right." Id. at 462.

The present case is set apart from Gamez-Orduno considering
AUSA Battista seeks a superseding indictment merely to entice the

defendant to enter into plea negotiations and to prevent the

5
 

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document172 Filed 01/12/10 Page 10 of 16

defendant from proceeding pro se. See Exhibit, 01 ("If the
defendant wishes to enter into serious plea negotiations... the
government is willing to postpone seeking a superseding indictment

in this case."). In United States v. Garza-Juarez, the Ninth Circuit

 

rejected a vindictive prosecution claim considering "[t]he
government's decision to seek additional charges may have been
based solely on the rejection of the plea bargain." Id., 992 F.2d
899, 907 (9th Cir. 1993). In the present case, there have been no
plea bargains for the defendant to reject. The government may only
use the threat of a superseding indictment, as `a negotiation
tactic, once plea negotiations have already begun. The government
may not use such a tactic to entice the defendant to merely enter-.
into plea negotiations.
B. The threat of the superseding indictment came

in response to the defendant filing his motion

to proceed pro se.

The defendant exercised his Sixth Amendment right to represent
himself by filing a motion to proceed pro se. In response to that
motion, AUSA Battista stated that he would seek a superseding
indictment considering the defendant is unable to "establish a
productive working relationship with a defense attorney" to help
the government "attempt to successfully resolve [] [the case] short
of trial via a plea agreement." Exhibit, 01. AUSA Battista intends
to punish the defendant for exercising his Sixth Amendment right
and seeks to avoid having to deal with a pro se defendant. A
superseding indictment of this nature is considered vindictive.

"A prosecutor violates due process when he seeks additional
charges solely to punish a defendant for exercising a constitutional
