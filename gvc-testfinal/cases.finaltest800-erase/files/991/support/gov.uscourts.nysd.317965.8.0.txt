DEFENDANT TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO TRANSFER

Defendant Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ("Teva") moves to transfer this action to the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, where, for nearly four years, the same
parties have been litigating the validity and enforceability of the same principal patent that
plaintiffs claim to be infringed in this action, United States Patent No. 5,382,600 (`600 patent").
See Pfizer, Inc. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., No. 04-1418 DMC (D.N.J. 2004); Pfizer,
Inc. v. IVAX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., No. 07-CV-0174 DMC (D.N.J. 2007). The interests of
Judicial efficiency weigh heavily in favor of transfer. Plaintiffs have filed two prior actions
against Teva alleging infringement of the `600 patent, and the same parties have been litigating
issues concerning the validity and enforceability of the `600 patent in the District of New Jersey
since early 2004. Fact and expert discovery has been nearly completed, and motions for
summary judgment are due on March 7, 2008. Transferring this action to the District of New

Jersey will facilitate judicial efficiency by taking advantage of the District of New Jersey's
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page 2of12

experience with the issues between the parties, avoiding duplicative discovery, and permitting
the scheduling of joint hearings and conferences as appropriate.

The private interests favor neither forum. Witnesses, proof, and all discovery
necessitated by this action are as convenient in the District of New Jersey as they are here.
Although plaintiffs have chosen this forum for this new action, they Hvice chose the District of
New Jersey as the forum for their prior actions against Teva involving the same `600 patent
asserted here. The balance of interests overwhelmingly weigh in favor of transfer.

BACKGROUND

New Litigation Involving the `600 Patent

This is a patent infringement action under the Hatch-Waxman Act, 21 U.S.C. 0x00A7 355q),
commenced on December 12, 2007 by Pfizer, Inc., Pharmacia & Upjohn Company LLC, and
Pfizer Health AB (collectively, "Pfizer"). Pfizer alleges that Teva's manufacture, use, sale or
offer for sale of tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules, 2 and 4 mg ("tolterodine ER
capsules") would infringe the `600 patent and two other patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,630,162
("162 patent') and 6,770,295 (`295 patent') (collectively, "patents-in-suit"). (Comp. {0x00A7 19-
30.)

The `600 patent, a so-called "compound patent," is directed to a class of chemical
compounds-3,3-diphenylpropylamines-and the pharmaceutical compositions thereof.
(Compl., Ex. A.) These compounds include tolterodine tartrate, which is the active ingredient in
Pfizer's product Detrol LA(R) and Teva's tolterodine ER capsules. Affidavit of Don M. Kennedy
dated January 16, 2008 ("Kennedy Aff."), 4. The `162 patent and `295 patent are so-called
"formulation patents." They are directed to controlled release formulations of tolterodine having
certain pharmacological properties and methods for using such formulations to treat unstable or

overactive urinary bladder. (Compl. {4 11, 13 & Exs. B, C).

Prior Pending Litigation Concerning the `600 Patent

This is the third action between the parties involving the `600 patent. This new action
concerns the parties' extended release ("ER") drugs; the prior two cases concerned immediate
release ("IR") products. In the first action, commenced in March 2004 ("First Action"), Pfizer
alleged that Teva's commercial manufacture, use or sale of tolterodine tartrate tablets, 1 and 2
mg ("tolterodine IR tablets") would infringe that patent. See Complaint 0x00A7 20 in Pfizer, Inc. v.
Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., No. 04-1418(DMC) (dismissed March 2007), Kennedy Aff. Ex. 1.
Teva filed an answer and counterclaims in the First Action seeking a declaratory judgment that
the `600 patent was invalid for obviousness and unenforceable because of inequitable conduct by
the inventors and their attorneys during the prosecution of the `600 patent. Teva conceded
infringement of the `600 patent, if it was otherwise valid and enforceable. (Kennedy Aff. J 6.)

In late 2006, after Teva had acquired IVAX Corporation and its subsidiary VAX
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Kennedy Aff. 0x00A7 7), Teva decided to forego further development of its
tolterodine IR tablets tablet in favor of IVAX's formulation of tolterodine IR tablets and to
withdraw Teva's ANDA. Teva's withdrawal of its ANDA was effective on December 28, 2006,
and IVAX amended its ANDA concerning tolterodine IR tablets on January 10, 2007 to assert a
Paragraph IV Certification that Pfizer's `600 patent was invalid and/or unenforceable. (Kennedy
Aff. 97-9.)

The next day, January 11, 2007, Pfizer commenced a second action for infringement of
the `600 patent in the District of New Jersey, this time against VAX ("Second Action").
(Kennedy Aff. 0x00A7 10.) IVAX asserted the same affirmative defenses and counterclaims that Teva
raised in the First Action. Teva joined the action as a counterclaim-plaintiff, and Pfizer then
joined Teva as a defendant as well. (Kennedy Aff. 0x00A7 11.) With court approval of the District of
New Jersey, the parties agreed to dismiss the First Action and stipulated in the Second Action

3
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page 4of12

that all fact and expert discovery taken in the First Action would be treated as if taken in the
Second Action, and that the parties would not duplicate discovery from the First Action.
(Kennedy Aff. yen 12.)

In the First and Second Actions, the parties have actively litigated the validity and
enforceability of the `600 patent in the District of New Jersey for nearly four years. Discovery
has been extensive and has included the production of several hundred thousand pages of
documents; 18 depositions, including depositions of inventors, prosecuting attorneys and others,
of which four depositions took place in Sweden where a number of non-party inventors and
witnesses reside; and the submission of reports from and the depositions of eight expert
witnesses. (Kennedy Aff. 0x00A7 13.) In addition, the parties have briefed, and the District of New
Jersey has considered, numerous important disputes concerning the scope of discovery on the
validity and enforceability of the `600 patent, including discovery regarding secondary
considerations of non-obviousness of the compounds claimed in the `600 patent. Although the
First and Second Actions concerned Teva's and IVAX's ANDAs for the immediate release
("IR") form of tolterodine, Pfizer also sought, and the District of New Jersey permitted, certain
discovery from Teva on the extended release ("ER") products at issue in this new action-Detrol
LA(R) and Teva's tolterodine ER capsules. (Kennedy Aff. 9 15.) Discovery in the Second Action
is nearly completed, and motions for summary judgment are due on March 7, 2008.

APPLICABLE LAW

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil action to any other
federal district court where it might have been brought "[f]or the convenience of parties and
witnesses, in the interest of justice." [I]n determining whether to transfer venue, courts examine:

(1) whether the action could have been brought in the proposed transferee forum; and (2)
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page 5of12

whether the transfer would promote the convenience of parties and witnesses and would be in the
interests of justice. Coker v. Bank of America, 984 F. Supp. 757, 764 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).
ARGUMENT

I. COURTS ROUTINELY TRANSFER PATENT CASES TO DISTRICTS WHERE
THE SAME PATENT IS ALREADY BEING LITIGATED.

The Second Circuit has stated that "`[t]here is a strong policy favoring the litigation of
related claims in the same tribunal in order that pretrial discovery can be conducted more
efficiently, [duplicative] litigation can be avoided, thereby saving time and expense for both
parties and witnesses, and inconsistent results can be avoided." Wyndham Assocs. v. Bintliff, 398
F.2d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1968) (transferring patent action to Delaware court, which had "invested
substantial time in scheduling conferences, presiding over discovery disputes and ruling on
several motions"). "[C]ourts have observed that transfer is particularly appropriate in patent
cases where a prior pending lawsuit involves the same facts, transactions, or occurrences...."
Inline Connection Corp. v. Verizon Internet Servs., Inc, 402 F. Supp. 2d 695, 702 (E.D. Va.
2005).

Courts have routinely transferred patent infringement lawsuits in instances such as this
one -- where litigation involving the same patent was ongoing in another jurisdiction. See, e.g.,
E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Diamond Shamrock Corp., 522 F. Supp. 588, 592 (D. Del.
1981) (holding that the "overriding fact" in its transfer decision was the waste of judicial
resources that would result from duplicative patent validity actions); Air Prods. & Chems., Inc v.
MG Nitrogen Servs., Inc., 133 F. Supp. 2d 354, 357 (D. Del. 2001) (holding, without any
discussion of other 0x00A71404(a) factors, that "the interests of judicial economy dictate that an action
involving the same patents-in-suit and most of the same parties should not proceed

simultaneously in two different district courts"); Zoltar Satellite Sys., Inc. v. LG Elecs. Mobile
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page6of12

Commc'ns Co., 402 F. Supp. 2d 731 (E.D. Tex. 2005) (transferring where three of the same
patents-at-issue were also at issue in litigation before the transferee court ); Encyclopedia
Britannica, Inc. v. Magellan Navigation, Inc., 512 F. Supp. 2d 1169 (W.D. Wis. 2007)
(transferring where the plaintiff had a pending suit in another district involving one of the patents
before the court); JmagePoint Inc. v. Keyser Indus., Inc., No. 3:04-CV-119, 2005 WL 1242067
(E.D. Tenn. May 25, 2005) (holding that the pending related case in the Eastern District of
Kentucky provided a powerful reason to transfer); Aventis Pharma S.A. v. Sandoz Inc., No. 06-
3671(MLC), 2007 WL 1101228, at *3 (D.N.J. April 10, 2007) (holding that the transferee-
judge's familiarity with the patents and defenses at issue favor transfer).

I. TRIAL EFFICIENCY AND THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE FAVOR TRANSFER
TO THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.

The `600 patent claims a class of chemical compounds, including tolterodine tartrate,
which is the active ingredient in Pfizer's IR and ER products, and Teva's proposed IR and ER
products. In its Answer and Counterclaims, filed with this Court on January 3, 2008, Teva has
alleged that the `600 patent is invalid or unenforceable, the same defenses that were previously
asserted in the two prior New Jersey actions. The First and Second Actions were assigned to
District Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh and Magistrate Judge Mark Falk. Magistrate Judge Falk
has considered approximately 25 letters and letter briefs from the parties, primarily relating to
discovery disputes and case management issues, and the parties have filed additional motions
with Judge Cavanaugh - a motion to consolidate the two cases and two separate motions to
dismiss-although such motions were ultimately withdrawn. There have been 15 status
conferences, telephone conferences and hearings in the District of New Jersey and that court has
become familiar with legal issues and discovery issues relevant to the parties' claims and

defenses concerning the `600 patent. (Kennedy Aff. 14.)
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page7 of 12

Transferring this action to a court that already has extensive familiarity with the primary
patent asserted in this action would conserve judicial time and resources. See Aventis Pharma
S.A. v. Sandoz Inc., No. 06-3671(MLC), 2007 WL 1101228, at *3 (holding that the transferee-
judge's familiarity with the patents and defenses at issue favor transfer); Zoltar, 402 F.Supp.2d at
735, 737 (interest in judicial efficiency favored transfer where transferee court was familiar with
and has ongoing litigation concerning three of the patents-in-suit).

In addition, transferring this action to the District of New Jersey would obviate
duplicative discovery. Litigation concerning the validity and enforceability of `600 patent is
close to completion in the District of New Jersey; the parties' motions for summary judgment are
due on March 7, 2008. (Kennedy Aff. 0x00A7 16.) The parties have litigated and taken discovery
concerning the validity and enforceability of the `600 patent for nearly four years. Duplicating
that discovery on the `600 patent in this Court would waste the parties' and this Court's time and
resources. Indeed, the District of New Jersey has already permitted Pfizer to take certain
discovery related to the extended release drug products that are the subject of this action, Detrol
LA(R) and Teva's tolterodine ER capsules. (Kennedy Aff. cent 15.) Enabling the District of New
Jersey to manage additional discovery, if any, concerning the `600 patent would promote judicial
efficiency by ensuring that there will be no duplicative discovery in this action.

Finally, transfer would permit joinder of hearings, and if desirable, consolidation of this
action with the pending action between the parties concerning the `600 patent. Rule 42(a) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a court to order a joint hearing, trial, or otherwise
consolidate actions that involve common questions of law or fact. "The purpose of consolidation
is to streamline pretrial proceedings so as to avoid duplication of effort, and to prevent

conflicting outcomes in cases involving similar legal and factual issues." Jn re TMI Litig., 193 F.
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page 8of12

3d 613, 724 (3d Cir. 1999). Here, because both actions involve the `600 patent, and because
Teva has raised the same invalidity and unenforceability defenses with regard to that patent as it
did in the prior pending action between the parties, proceedings concerning discovery, motion
practice and court hearings on issues related to that patent can be consolidated in order to
preserve judicial resources and promote the interests of justice. See Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Inc. v. Perkin-Elmer Corp., \\ F. Supp. 2d 729, 730-31 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) Gudicial
efficiency inherent in joint management of pre-trial discovery, settlement, and consolidation
strongly favors transfer).

Tl. THE PRIVATE INTERESTS FAVOR NEITHER FORUM.

Transferring this action to the District of New Jersey would not adversely affect the
private interests of the parties. None of the operative facts related to the parties' claims and
defenses took place in New York or New Jersey. Most, if not all, of the potential witnesses
reside outside New York and New Jersey and, in the case of the inventors of the asserted patents,
outside the United States.' Therefore, proof and witnesses are as easily accessible in Newark,
New Jersey, where the other action between the parties is pending, as they would be in New
York. In any event, requiring any witnesses resident in New York to appear in nearby Newark
would not be unduly burdensome. See B.W.B. Controls, Inc. v. C.\S.E. Automation Eng'g &
Servs. Inc., 587 F. Supp. 1027, 1029 (W.D. La. 1984) (inconvenience to witnesses and location
of documents of a two-hour drive far outweighed by convenience of trying patent infringement

lawsuits involving the same patent before one judge).

 

Teva's principal office is in North Wales, Pennsylvania. To the extent any Teva affiliates have discoverable
information, those affiliates are foreign entities. Therefore, both forums are equally convenient for Teva.

The face of the patents-in-suit indicate that all but one of the sixteen listed inventors are from Sweden or
Denmark. One inventor is listed as being from Michigan. See U.S. Patent No. 5,382,600, U.S. Patent No.
6,630,162, and U.S. Patent No. 6,770,295, attached as exhibits A, B, and C, respectively, to Pfizer's
Complaint.
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page 9of12

The only arguable interest that favors this forum is Pfizer's interest in its own "choice of
forum," and any inconvenience resulting from transfer that Pfizer may claim because its
headquarters are located in New York. Pfizer's choice of forum should be given little weight in
this case, because Pfizer, by filing two prior actions against Teva involving the `600 patent in the
District of New Jersey, has shown its willingness to litigate in, and its preference for, that forum.
See Inline, 402 F. Supp. 2d at 701-02 (plaintiff's choice of forum not afforded substantial weight
where plaintiff chose transferee forum to litigate its patents for more than three years). In
addition, "[i]n complex patent litigation involving a multitude of large companies with facilities
and employees all over the country, the private interest factors often become diluted and less
influential in the transfer analysis." Zoltar, 402 F.Supp.2d at 738. Pfizer brought two prior
actions involving the `600 patent in the District of New Jersey. Therefore, where all other
factors point toward transfer, Pfizer's "new" choice of this forum should not be given significant
weight.

IV. BALANCING THE INTERESTS CLEARLY WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF
TRANSFER.

The "interests of justice" factor `""may be determinative to a particular transfer motion,
even if the convenience of the parties and witnesses might call for a different result." Regents of
the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 119 F.3d 1559, 1565-66 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Coffey v. Van Dorn
Iron Works, 796 F.2d 217, 220-21 (7th Cir. 1986). In Regents of the University of California v.
Eli Lilly & Co., the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held that a district court properly placed
determinative weight on the interests of justice factor in deciding to transfer a patent
infringement case because litigation concerning the same patent was already in progress. The
court reasoned that in cases where "several highly technical factual issues are presented and the

other relevant factors are in equipoise, the interest of judicial economy may favor transfer to a
Case 1:07-cv-11198-LTS Document8 Filed 01/16/2008 Page 10 of 12

court that has become familiar with the issues." /d. at 1565. Courts have recognized that there is
a strong public policy favoring transfer of patent infringement actions to courts where litigation
involving the same or a related patent is pending. The rationale underlying that policy is that
patent infringement actions tend to involve complicated technology and, as a result, courts are
required to expend significant time and effort to become familiar with that technology, the
patents, and the accused infringing product. See id. Here, litigation between the parties
concerning another tolterodine product and involving the principal patent of the three patents-in-
suit has been ongoing for almost four years in the District of New Jersey. That court has
developed expertise and familiarity with several issues that are to arise in this action, in
particular in the context of discovery concerning the validity and unenforceability of the `600
patent. Where, as here, the only interest favoring the Southern District of New York is the
"plaintiff's choice of forum", and where there is a great interest in judicial efficiency due to the
nature of this suit and the legal and factual issues it raises, transfer should be made to the court
that has already devoted substantial time and resources to those issues and the parties' positions

- the District of New Jersey.
