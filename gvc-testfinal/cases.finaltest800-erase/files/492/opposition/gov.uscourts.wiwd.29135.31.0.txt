Plaintiffs Motorola Mobility, Inc., and General Instrument Corporation (collectively,
“Motorola”) oppose defendant Microsoft’s motion to dismiss, stay or, in the alternative, transfer
venue [D.I. 20]. Motorola’s patent infringement action, No. 10-cv-699, should proceed in this
District.1
I.

INTRODUCTION
Motorola has selected the Western District of Wisconsin as its forum of choice in which

to pursue certain claims of patent infringement against Microsoft. This selection should not be
disturbed unless the transfer factors of 28 U.S.C. § 1404, as interpreted and applied by this Court
and the Seventh Circuit, make Washington “clearly more convenient.” They do not. This
District is substantially more likely than the Western District of Washington to promote judicial
efficiency by means of a speedy resolution of the dispute presented, and this District is as
convenient -- or more so -- to the non-party witnesses whose appearances are likely to be
necessary.
Nonetheless, Microsoft asks that this Court dismiss, stay or, in the alternative, transfer
venue. In doing so, Microsoft argues that a transfer analysis should be performed only in the
alternative and, instead, urges the Court to treat Motorola’s patent infringement claims as
compulsory counterclaims to a breach of contract action brought by Microsoft against Motorola,
Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc. -- but not Plaintiff General Instrument Corporation -- in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 10-cv-1823 (“the
Washington action”). Microsoft’s argument is without merit.

1

Filed concurrently herewith is Motorola’s opposition to a similar motion filed by Microsoft in
Civil Action No. 10-cv-700. Although the two opposition briefs are largely the same, Motorola notes that
there are several important differences that merit the Court’s attention. For example, the lawsuits involve
different patents, naming additional inventors, owned by additional entities, asserted against different
products. The significance of these differences is addressed throughout.

1

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 6 of 21

Whether Microsoft’s Washington action is even proper is in doubt -- Motorola has moved
to dismiss all of Microsoft’s claims.2 And even if Microsoft’s claims are not dismissed by the
Washington Court, no claim in the Washington action arises out of the same transaction or
occurrence as the patent infringement claims brought by Motorola in this District. Instead, each
claim in the Washington action relates to the impact of various letters of assurance, provided by
Motorola, Inc. to non-party standard setting organizations, on Motorola, Inc. and Motorola
Mobility, Inc.’s efforts to license their standards-essential patent portfolios. These are contract,
not patent infringement, issues. And General Instrument Corporation, the assignee-of-record and
owner of all right, title and interest in the patents in suit here, is neither a named defendant nor
even mentioned in the Washington action.
Even if the Court were to entertain Microsoft’s argument that the present lawsuit includes
compulsory counterclaims to the Washington action, Motorola’s choice of forum should control,
according to the applicable Seventh Circuit section 1404(a) transfer analysis. In particular, under
settled Seventh Circuit precedent, Motorola’s patent infringement action seeking coercive relief
should be given priority over Microsoft’s anticipatory action.
Accordingly, Microsoft’s motion should be denied. This lawsuit should be permitted to
proceed in this District.
II.

BRIEF STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS
On November 10, 2010, Motorola filed its Complaint in the present action [D.I. 1]. In

that Complaint, Motorola alleges that Microsoft has infringed and continues to infringe claims of
U.S. Patent Nos. 7,310,374 (“the ’374 patent”); 7,310,375 (“the ’375 patent”); and 7,310,376

2

See Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss, Microsoft Corp. v.
Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc., No. 10-cv-1823 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 15, 2010) (supporting
memorandum attached hereto as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Paul M. Schoenhard (“Decl.”)).

2

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 7 of 21

(“the ’376 patent”) (collectively, the “patents in suit”), each of which is duly assigned to Plaintiff
General Instrument Corporation. As further detailed in Motorola’s First Amended Complaint,
filed concurrently herewith, Motorola’s claims of infringement arise from Microsoft’s
manufacture, use, instruction to use, offer for sale, and/or sale of the Windows 7 operating
system and Internet Explorer 9 browser software.
Each of the patents in suit lists four inventors: Limin Wang, Rajeev Gandhi, Krit
Panusopone, and Ajay Luthra. Of these, Messrs. Wang, Panusopone and Luthra continue to
work for General Instrument Corporation and are thus under Motorola’s control. Mr. Gandhi is a
former employee, residing near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. See Decl. ¶¶ 3,4.
Four attorneys are known to have been involved in the prosecution of the patents in suit:
Robert P. Marley, Kin-Wah Tong, Steven L. Nichols, and Lawrence T. Cullen. Of these, Mr.
Cullen currently works for Motorola Mobility, Inc. and is thus under Motorola’s control.
Messrs. Marley, Tong and Nichols no longer work for Motorola and are believed to reside in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Utah, respectively. See Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.
Motorola is not currently aware of any non-party from whom evidence will be required to
establish Microsoft’s infringement. On information and belief, witnesses sufficient to provide
evidence of Microsoft’s infringement remain employed by, and thus under the control of,
Microsoft.
On December 20, 2010, Microsoft filed this motion to dismiss, stay or, in the alternative,
transfer venue. [D.I. 20.] In support of its motion, Microsoft argues that Motorola’s claims in
this District should be viewed as compulsory counterclaims to a separate complaint filed by
Microsoft on November 9, in the United States District Court for the Western District of

3

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 8 of 21

Washington against non-party Motorola, Inc. and Plaintiff Motorola Mobility, Inc., but not
against Plaintiff General Instrument Corporation.
In the Washington action, Microsoft purports to plead four causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) promissory estoppel; (3) waiver; and (4) declaratory judgment that Motorola’s
offers do not comply with its obligations. Notably, Microsoft did not request a declaratory
judgment of invalidity and/or non-infringement of any of the patents in suit here. Nor did
Microsoft assert any right or privilege to practice the inventions of the patents in suit or
otherwise seek any relief that would prevent Motorola from asserting its rights. Rather, all
claims pleaded in the Washington action -- to the extent they are cognizable -- arise out of two
letters sent by Motorola, Inc. to Microsoft, each offering to negotiate a license on reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms to a large portfolio of patents owned by Motorola, Inc. and/or its
subsidiaries and affiliates that are or may be essential to practice one or more industry standards.
III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Motorola’s Choice of Forum Should Control

Section 1404 of Title 28 provides in relevant part: “For the convenience of parties and
witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other
district or division where it might have been brought.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Section 1404 does
not, however, stand for the proposition that transfer of venue should be a routine matter. Rather,
the Court must consider all circumstances of the case, using the three statutory factors as place
holders in its analysis. See Coffey v. Van Dorn Iron Works, 796 F.2d 217, 219 (7th Cir. 1986).
Microsoft bears the burden of proving that its choice of forum is “clearly more convenient” than
the Western District of Wisconsin. See id. at 219-20.

4

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 9 of 21

Here, the Western District of Washington is not a “clearly more convenient” forum, and
the interest of justice rests with proceeding in this District. Motorola’s choice of the Western
District of Wisconsin should control.
1.

The convenience factors

The first two statutory considerations in a transfer analysis relate to the convenience of
the parties and witnesses.3

“With respect to the convenience evaluation, courts generally

consider the availability of and access to witnesses, and each party’s access to and distance from
resources in each forum. Other related factors include the location of material events and the
relative ease of access to sources of proof.” Research Automation, Inc. v. Schrader-Bridgeport
Int’l, Inc., 626 F.3d 973, 978 (7th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted).
Although the convenience evaluation once took center stage, advances in travel and
technology have minimized its value, especially in cases, as here, involving large, sophisticated,
multi-national corporations.

Specifically, the Court may assume that witnesses within the

control of the party calling them will appear voluntarily, and that technology has obviated the
concern over the location of documents and sources of proofs.

See E2Interactive, Inc. v.

Blackhawk Network, Inc., No. 09-cv-629, 2010 WL 3937911, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Oct. 6, 2010);
Sunbeam Prods., Inc. v. Homedics, Inc., 587 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1057 (W.D. Wis. 2008)
(“[D]ocuments easily can be transported between the two districts and their presence in [another
location] does not make it clearly more convenient”). “In patent lawsuits, where experts and
lawyers end up playing the starring roles, mention of ‘witnesses’ and ‘records’ in a given district
carries minimal weight.” Illumina, Inc. v. Affymetrix, Inc., No. 09-cv-277, 2009 WL 3062786, at
*3 (W.D. Wis. Sept. 21, 2009).

3

These considerations correspond to factors 3, 4, 5, and 6 listed on page 8 of Microsoft’s brief.

5

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 10 of 21

Microsoft asserts that the Western District of Washington is a more convenient location
for party witnesses.

In support, Microsoft discusses the proximity of Motorola’s Illinois

facilities to O’Hare airport, the number of flights each day between O’Hare and the Seattle
airport, and the inconvenience to any Microsoft witnesses located in Seattle of having to travel to
this Court. As this Court has noted, however, the location of party witnesses is not a heavily
weighted factor because “witnesses within the control of the party calling them, such as
employees, will appear voluntarily.” Adams v. Newell Rubbermaid Inc., No. 07-cv-313-S,
2007 WL 5613420, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Aug. 21, 2007) (citation omitted). Moreover, Microsoft’s
assertions that on balance Seattle is more convenient than Wisconsin for party witnesses is
simply not correct. Motorola Mobility is headquartered in Libertyville, Illinois, and General
Instrument is located in both Pennsylvania and in San Diego. The District of Washington is not
clearly more convenient for party witnesses in those locations than this District -- any witness
from these facilities will need to travel a significant distance to Seattle.

Thus, Microsoft’s

choice of Seattle merely shifts the burden of inconvenience as between the parties -- it does not
make Seattle “clearly more convenient” for all.
The location of non-party witnesses remains an important, but not dispositive, factor. See
Illumina, 2009 WL 3062786, at *4. But in this case, Motorola is not aware of any non-party
witness residing within the geographic bounds of either this District’s or the Western District of
Washington’s subpoena power. And the Western District of Washington is not “clearly more
convenient” than this District for the potential non-party witnesses that reside in Utah
(prosecuting attorney), Pennsylvania (inventor and prosecuting attorney) and New Jersey
(prosecuting attorney). If anything, this District is more convenient for the majority.

6

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 11 of 21

Finally, Microsoft has repeatedly embraced this District as a plaintiff. See Microsoft
Corp. v. Beltz Techs., No. 00-cv-126 (W.D. Wis.); Microsoft Corp. v. Aurora Computer Servs.,
No. 01-cv-681 (W.D. Wis.). And Microsoft has repeatedly accepted venue in this District as a
defendant. See AlmondNet, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., No. 10-cv-298 (W.D. Wis.); Yavitz LLC v.
Microsoft Corp., No. 10-cv-146 (W.D. Wis.); Freyburger LLC v. Microsoft Corp., No. 09-cv104 (W.D. Wis.); Hyperphrase Techs., LLC v. Microsoft Corp., No. 02-cv-647 (W.D. Wis.).
Indeed, insofar as Motorola could determine, Microsoft has not requested transfer or otherwise
contested venue in any patent lawsuit in this District naming Microsoft as a defendant in the past
decade, even though only Hyperphrase involved a Wisconsin-based plaintiff and inventors
resident in Wisconsin. Microsoft should not now be heard to claim that the Western District of
Wisconsin is inconvenient.
2.

The interest of justice

The primary consideration for this Court should be the “interest of justice.”4 “Factors
traditionally considered in an ‘interest of justice’ analysis relate to the efficient administration of
the court system.” Coffey, 796 F.2d at 221; see also Research Automation, 626 F.3d at 978. For
example, the Court’s evaluation may include consideration of docket congestion and likely speed
to trial in each forum, each court’s relative familiarity with the relevant law and technology, and
whether judicial resources could be saved by consolidating multiple cases in the same forum.
See id.
The “interest of justice” component is critical to a Section 1404 analysis and “may be
determinative in a particular case, even if the convenience of the parties and witnesses might call
for a different result.” Coffey, 796 F.2d at 220; see also Research Automation, 626 F.3d at 978.
This District has often found that, even where convenience considerations “tilt” in favor of the
4

This consideration corresponds to factors 7, 8, 9, and 10 on page 8 of Microsoft’s brief.

7

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 12 of 21

target transfer district, public and private interests in, for example, a speedy trial justify denying
the transfer. See Sunbeam Prods., 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1056 (“In terms of balancing the interest of
justice with the convenience of the parties, the scale tips in favor of denying transfer because the
importance of a speedy resolution to protect plaintiff’s patent rights outweighs the convenience
to defendant of litigating in its home district.”). This factor is of particular import in patent
cases, “because delay might frustrate a patent holder’s right and the value of its patent.”
E2Interactive, 2010 WL 3937911, at *4.
Here, Motorola has selected the Western District of Wisconsin both because of its speed
and familiarity with (and frequent adjudication of) patent law issues. Whereas patent cases are
frequently tried in an average of eleven to fifteen months in this District (see Decl. Exh. B), the
few patent cases that have been tried in the Western District of Washington have reached trial
after, on average, more than thirty months (see Decl. Exh. C).5 Indeed, there can be no debate
that this District is speedier and more experienced in the resolution of patent matters than the
proposed transferee district. Speed is particularly of the essence here, because, among other
things, one of the accused products has only recently been introduced (Windows 7), and another
is in the process of being introduced (Internet Explorer 9), into this District. See Illumina,
2009 WL 3062786, at *5. Moreover, there are no facts here that would militate against this
factor, such as an earlier-filed lawsuit, involving claims of invalidity or non-infringement of the
same patents, pending in the district to which the moving party seeks to transfer this case.
Accordingly, the interest of justice strongly militates against transfer. See Sunbeam
Prods., 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1058 (“[T]he fact remains that this is a relatively speedy federal court,

5

The time-to-trial statistics cited by Microsoft in footnote 9 of its brief are not limited to patent
cases, but instead are for all civil cases.

8

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 13 of 21

particularly with regard to patent lawsuits. The relative speed with which an action may be
resolved is an important consideration when selecting a venue.”).
Microsoft argues nonetheless that the interest of justice favors adjudication in the
Western District of Washington, because its Washington breach of contract action is pending
there, presenting the possibility of overlap or consolidation (assuming the claims are viewed as
related). This argument fails. Given the pendency of Motorola’s motion to dismiss all claims in
the Washington action, Microsoft’s argument is too tenuous to merit consideration.
Moreover, even if the Washington action is not dismissed, the claims at issue there and
the claims pending in this lawsuit do not present anywhere near the degree of overlap that was
considered by this Court in Nokia Corp. v. Apple, Inc. Unlike the situation here, in Nokia, the
defendant asked this Court to transfer the plaintiff’s claims to another venue in which the
plaintiff had brought other claims against the same defendant, involving common questions of
law and fact. See Decl. Exh. D at 2-3 (Order, Nokia Corp. v. Apple, Inc., No. 10-cv-249 (W.D.
Wis. Jan. 5, 2011)). The present lawsuit and Microsoft’s Washington action do not have such a
relationship.
First, unlike in Nokia, Motorola filed no “related” claim in Washington. Instead, the
Washington action was filed by Microsoft and is grounded in breach of contract and other
contractual claims, seeking a determination of a “FRAND” (fair, reasonable and
nondiscriminatory) royalty rate for use of standards essential patents.

It does not seek a

determination of patent validity and infringement by specific Microsoft products, as here. This
action seeks a determination that three specific patents have been infringed by particular
Microsoft products, along with a routine (i.e., not FRAND) damages calculation. Microsoft

9

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 14 of 21

could have sought in the Washington action a declaration of non-infringement or invalidity of the
three specific patents at issue here. It did not and, therefore, Nokia is inapposite.
Microsoft further argues that the interest of justice favors adjudication in the Western
District of Washington, because, among other things, “Microsoft is a large and prominent
employer in the Puget Sound (Seattle area) region.” [D.I. 20 at 13.] Microsoft thus appears to
argue that this lawsuit should be tried in a forum it believes to be biased in its favor. This
unvarnished appeal to local bias does not reflect the interest of justice. Microsoft goes on to
assert that “Washington has substantial interest in policing conduct directed at its residents.” But
the present lawsuit relates to the conduct of Microsoft, not conduct directed at Microsoft.
*

*

*

Here, Microsoft “has not clearly shown that the inconveniences it will experience by
trying this case in Madison outweigh [Motorola’s] legitimate interest in resolving this patent
dispute more quickly in this court.” E2Interactive, 2010 WL 3937911, at *5. Put another way,
Washington is not “clearly more convenient” than this District.

Motorola’s choice of the

Western District of Wisconsin should control.
B.

Motorola’s Claims Are Not Properly Viewed As Compulsory Counterclaims

In an effort to sidestep a principled transfer analysis, Microsoft urges this Court to view
Motorola’s patent infringement claims as compulsory counterclaims in Microsoft’s breach of
contract action against Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc. in the Western District of
Washington. This argument is both unpersuasive and logically flawed.
A counterclaim is compulsory when it “arises out of the same transaction or occurrence
that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a). The Federal
Circuit utilizes three tests to determine whether the “transaction or occurrence” test is met:

10

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 15 of 21

“(1) whether the legal and factual issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are largely the
same; (2) whether substantially the same evidence supports or refutes both the claim and the
counterclaim; and (3) whether there is a logical relationship between the claim and the
counterclaim.” Nasalok Coating Corp. v. Nylok Corp., 522 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
Here, the claims presented in the instant lawsuit and those presented in the Washington action do
not raise “largely” the same legal or factual issues; do not rely upon “substantially” the same
evidence; and bear only a tangential relationship to one another. The instant claims are not
compulsory counterclaims.
First, General Instrument Corporation is the assignee-of-record of, and owns the entire
right, title and interest to, each of the patents in suit here. Microsoft’s Washington action,
however, is not directed at, nor does it name as a defendant, Plaintiff General Instrument
Corporation.

Accordingly, Microsoft is hard-pressed to argue that General Instrument

Corporation should be obligated to assert its patent rights as compulsory counterclaims in a
separate lawsuit to which it is neither a party, nor even an essential third party.6
Second, Motorola’s patent infringement claims in this action bear little relation to the
contract claims asserted by Microsoft in the Washington action. The mere fact that the patents
asserted in this case are among the many patents that Motorola identified in its H.264 licensing
letter does not make the claims of this patent infringement action “logically related” to those of
the Seattle breach of contract action. Nor does it make the Washington and Wisconsin actions
“inextricably intertwined.”

6

Microsoft should not be heard to argue that its omission of General Instrument Corporation from
the Washington action may be cured by the filing of an amended complaint. Even if Microsoft were to so
amend, General Instrument’s claims here would be senior to any claims Microsoft could bring against it
in Washington.

11

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 16 of 21

Looking to the substance of the two lawsuits’ claims, Microsoft’s argument that the
claims are “logically related” proves to be insubstantial. The Washington action includes four
contractual and non-patent “claims”: (1) breach of contract; (2) promissory estoppel; (3) waiver;
and (4) a request for a declaratory judgment that the royalty rates initially offered by Motorola
Mobility, Inc. are not fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.

None of the “claims” in

Washington arises under the patent laws.7 Nor do the claims in the Washington action depend
on validity or infringement of the three specific patents asserted in this action. Indeed, Microsoft
has admitted as much in its Washington Complaint:
Motorola’s breach of its commitments does not depend on whether any Motorola
patents which Motorola has identified in relation to standards are, in fact,
“essential” to practicing those standards, whether those standards can be practiced
in ways that do not infringe the identified Motorola patents or whether Microsoft
has infringed any valid Motorola patents.
Decl. Exh. E ¶ 8. Thus, Microsoft agreed -- indeed, proclaimed -- that none of the contractual
“claims” in Washington is “largely the same” as the central issues in Wisconsin -- Microsoft’s
manufacture, use, sale, or offer for sale of its Windows 7 operating system and Internet
Explorer 9 browser software products, how the products work, and whether the products infringe
valid claims of the patents asserted here.
Microsoft could have raised these issues in Washington by including a declaratory
judgment claim of non-infringement and/or patent invalidity, as declaratory judgment plaintiffs
customarily do in patent cases. But it chose not to do so, because that plainly is not what the
Washington complaint is about.

And absent such a patent invalidity or non-infringement

declaratory judgment claim in Washington, Motorola’s claims in this case are not logically

Notably, in its Complaint in the Washington action, Microsoft does not plead federal question
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). See Decl. Exh. E ¶ 19 (Complaint, Microsoft Corporation v.
Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc., No. 10-cv-1823 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 9, 2010)).

related or inextricably intertwined with Microsoft’s claims in Washington and cannot be
compulsory counterclaims.
Contrary to Microsoft’s assertions, the claims it did actually bring in Washington are not
“largely the same” as the claims here. None of Microsoft’s claims would require the Washington
court to determine the quantum of damages available in an action for patent infringement.8
Indeed, Microsoft’s third “claim,” waiver, although it may be available in some cases as an
affirmative defense, is not even a legal claim.9 Nor has Microsoft cast its “waiver” claim as a
request for a declaratory judgment that the defense is available.
At most, Microsoft can argue that its Washington action implicates the quantum of
royalties that Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc. may seek in licenses to their standards
essential patents. But even so, Microsoft’s claims are directed to FRAND licensing terms for all
patents in Motorola’s H.264 portfolio -- not the patent infringement damages that may be owed
by Microsoft for its past infringement of three specific patents, or to the availability of injunctive
relief in this lawsuit for patent infringement. And the fact that that there may be overlap in some
evidence and overlap in some issues does not make a claim a compulsory counterclaim. At
most, it makes a claim a permissive counterclaim.
Microsoft directs this Court’s attention to several decisions in other districts in which
breach-of-contract and patent infringement claims were found to be related. Unlike the claims in

8

Although some courts have suggested in dicta that the Georgia-Pacific analysis often used for
determining reasonable royalty patent damages might be useful in determinations of FRAND licensing
terms, see, e.g., ESS Tech., Inc. v. PC-Tel, Inc., No. C-99-20292RMW, 2001 WL 1891713, at *3-6 (N.D.
Cal. Nov. 28, 2001), Motorola is not aware of any court that has yet attempted such an analysis. And
even if the Washington court elected to conduct such an analysis, its inquiry would necessarily relate to
Motorola’s entire standards-essential patent portfolios.

See Guesthouse Int’l, LLC v. Shoney’s N. Am. Corp., No. M2008-02567-COA-R3-CV,
2010 WL 987119, at *31 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2009); 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 197
(July 2010) (“Waiver is not a cause of action because it cannot create liability in and of itself, and waiver
cannot be asserted in a complaint as an offensive weapon.”).

the Washington action, however, in each of those cases the contract claims directly impacted
whether infringement could be found. See Fit Express, Inc. v. Circuit-Total Fitness, No. 07-cv62, 2008 WL 4450290 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 29, 2008); Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp.,
232 F. Supp. 814

(S.D.N.Y.

1964);

Phillips

Petroleum

Co.

v.

U.S.

Steel

Corp.,

566 F. Supp. 1093 (D. Del. 1983). For example, the contract claims at issue in Fit Express
related to the ownership of the asserted patent rights, such that their resolution was necessary to
establish ownership of any claim of infringement. The contract claims in Artvale were held to be
compulsory because the issue of infringement depended on the defendant’s rights under a
contract. And the contract claims in Phillips were held to be compulsory because they related to
the defendant’s specific licensing rights under a prior settlement agreement. The contract claims
at issue in the Washington action, however, relate to an alleged breach of Motorola’s obligations
to a standard setting organization and seek determination of a FRAND rate, regardless of
whether Microsoft has infringed any of the patents in suit here. And where, as here, patent
infringement claims are not inextricably intertwined with contract-styled claims, the claims
should not be viewed as part of the same transaction or occurrence. See, e.g., In re Recombinant
DNA Tech. Pat. & Contract Litig., 874 F. Supp. 904, 922 (S.D. Ind. 1994) (holding a claim
based on a settlement agreement not to be a compulsory counterclaim to a patent infringement
claim).
Third, to view Motorola’s patent infringement claims as compulsory counterclaims in the
Washington action would require Motorola to raise or waive all possible patent infringement
claims based on all patents that are or may be essential to the two sets of industry standards at
issue, or face preclusion. Hundreds of patents could be implicated. This Court should not force

14

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 19 of 21

so absurd a result. See Martino v. McDonald’s Sys., Inc., 598 F.2d 1079, 1082 (7th Cir. 1979)
(explaining that Rule 13(a) is designed to promote judicial economy).
Finally, Motorola has filed a motion to dismiss all claims of the Washington action under
Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. Motorola respectfully submits that, at a minimum, this Court
should not rule on the present motion that Motorola’s claims here are compulsory counterclaims
until after the Court in Washington rules on Motorola’s motion to dismiss Microsoft’s claims
there.
C.

Dismissal, Stay and Transfer Are Unnecessary and Inappropriate Remedies

Even if this Court were to view Motorola’s claims as related to Microsoft’s claims in the
Washington action, they should nonetheless proceed in this Court. It is neither necessary nor
appropriate to dismiss, stay or transfer Motorola’s claims.
Based on the Supreme Court’s instruction that “the plaintiff’s choice of forum should
rarely be disturbed,” the first-to-file rule ordinarily provides that the first suit filed in a series of
related suits will typically be given priority over the later-filed suits. Research Automation, Inc.
v. Schrader-Bridgeport Int’l, Inc., 626 F.3d 973, 979 (7th Cir. 2010) (citing Gulf Oil Corp. v.
Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947)). The Seventh Circuit, however, has “never laid down an
inflexible rule that the prior filing controls.” Research Automation, 626 F.3d at 980 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

On the contrary, the Seventh Circuit has stated explicitly that

“[w]here a case is filed first should weigh no more heavily in the district court’s analysis than the
plaintiff’s choice of forum in a section 1404(a) transfer analysis.” Id. at 982; see also Tempco
Electric Heater Corp. v. Omega Eng’g, Inc., 819 F.2d 746, 749-50 (7th Cir. 1987) (finding that
the “mere fact” that a plaintiff filed its action first “does not give it a ‘right’ to choose a forum”).
In particular, under Seventh Circuit law, considerations including whether the second-filed

15

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 31 Filed: 01/11/11 Page 20 of 21

action seeks coercive relief and whether the first-filed action was filed in anticipation of an
impending suit by the opposing party weigh against application of the first-filed rule. See
Research Automation, 626 F.3d at 980.
Even if this Court were to find that Motorola’s and Microsoft’s claims are related and
that Motorola’s claims are compulsory counterclaims, Motorola’s patent infringement action
should be given priority as a coercive action under Seventh Circuit precedent, over Microsoft’s
action seeking, among other things, multiple different forms of declaratory relief relating to its
breach of contract claim. Furthermore, Microsoft’s action, filed in response to a communication
from Motorola offering to license a portfolio of standards-essential patents that includes the three
patents now asserted here in Wisconsin, should be viewed as at most an “anticipatory” action
under Seventh Circuit law. These factors, in addition to the transfer factors discussed above,
weigh heavily against application of the first-filed rule here. See also Uniroyal Engineered
Prods., LLC v. Omnova Solutions Inc., No. 08-cv-586, 2009 WL 736700, at *1 (W.D. Wis. Mar.
18, 2009) (stating that when two patent actions “are filed within days of each other, it is more
appropriate to consider the convenience factors of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) rather than applying the
rigid rule that the first-filed action trumps the later-filed action”).
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Motorola respectfully requests that the Court deny Microsoft’s

motion. This lawsuit’s affirmative claims for patent infringement should be permitted to proceed
to a speedy resolution.
