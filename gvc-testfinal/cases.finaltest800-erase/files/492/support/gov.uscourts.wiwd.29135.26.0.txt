DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO
DISMISS, STAY OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TRANSFER VENUE
The Court should dismiss or transfer Motorola’s patent infringement action because its
infringement claims are compulsory counterclaims in Microsoft’s pending suit against Motorola
in the Western District of Washington. The prior-filed Washington suit involves facts and legal
disputes that are central to and would require resolution before Motorola could receive any relief
in this case. In any event, even if plaintiffs’ claims were not compulsory counterclaims such that
this case should be dismissed or stayed, the Court should in the alternative transfer this case to
the Western District of Washington pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404, because the Western District
of Washington hosts a first-filed action involving the same underlying facts and subject matter
and also is a more convenient venue.
I.

BACKGROUND FACTS
On November 9, 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola in the Western District of Washington

alleging breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and waiver (the “Washington action”). The
Washington action relates to Motorola’s promises to standards-setting organizations to offer

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 2 of 18

licenses to the patents asserted here (and many others) at reasonable royalty rates, with
reasonable terms and under non-discriminatory conditions. Complaint, d/e 1 at 1-2. Despite
such promises, Motorola demanded of Microsoft excessive and discriminatory royalties based on
products as to which the accused technology forms but a minor, and often optional, portion of the
product functionality. See, October 29, 2010 Letter from Motorola regarding H.264 patent
license, Exhibit 1 to Cederoth Declaration filed herewith. Microsoft’s Washington case seeks,
inter alia, relief declaring Motorola to be in breach of its binding promises and further limiting
damages for any use of its patents, if any, that Microsoft’s (or its suppliers’) compliance with the
related standards might have caused.
On November 10, 2010, Plaintiffs filed this suit against Microsoft (the “Wisconsin
action”), alleging patent infringement. Plaintiffs allege that Microsoft’s Windows 7 product
infringes patents that Motorola claims relate to H.264 technology, specifically, U.S. Patent Nos.
7,310,374 (the “’374 patent”), 7,310,375 (the “’375 patent”), and 7,310,376 (the “’376 patent”).1
H.264 technology is a now-accepted industry standard for video compression, which is used in
applications such as digital television, mobile TV, video conferencing, and Internet video
streaming. The patents-in-suit all facially relate to methods and systems of encoding and
decoding digital video content.2 Indeed, each of these patents expressly states that it relates to
the “H.264 standard.” (See, e.g. ‘374 patent, col. 1, lines 19-20, d/e 1, Exhibit 1).
Defendant Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) is a Washington corporation with its
principal place of business in Redmond, Washington, where it has been headquartered since
1

Plaintiffs currently have a related suit pending against Microsoft in the Western District of Wisconsin, captioned
10-cv-700. The 700 suit alleges that Microsoft’s Xbox 360 system infringes certain Motorola patents. Microsoft
has also moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, transfer the 700 case to the Western District of Washington.
2

The patents are titled “Macroblock Level Adaptive Frame/Field Coding for Digital Video Content.” See, d/e 1
Exhibits 1-3.

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 3 of 18

1979. Microsoft’s Window 7 products were developed in Redmond, Washington, where all key
decisions regarding marketing and product direction are made and all witnesses with knowledge
of the relevant facts are located. See generally, Declaration of Erich Andersen, filed herewith.
Microsoft is not currently aware of any employees located in Wisconsin who would have
relevant knowledge regarding this dispute, nor is Microsoft aware of any documents relevant to
this litigation that are maintained in Wisconsin. See generally, Andersen Decl..
Plaintiff Motorola Mobility, Inc. (“Motorola”) is a Delaware corporation with its
principal place of business in Libertyville, Illinois. Plaintiff General Instrument Corporation
(“General Instrument”) is also a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in
Horsham, Pennsylvania. General Instrument is wholly owned by Motorola and is the nominal
owner of the patents-in-suit. Although both Motorola and General Instrument are plaintiffs in
the Wisconsin action, Motorola, not General Instrument, sent Microsoft a letter demanding
royalties on the patents General Instrument purports to own, describing the patents as part of
“Motorola’s portfolio of patents,” and not mentioning General Instrument. See, Cederoth Ex.
1.3
Microsoft is also not aware of any third-party witnesses who are located in Wisconsin.
None of the named inventors of the patents-in-suit are listed on the patents as residents of
Wisconsin. Moreover, Motorola approached Microsoft in Washington to assert licensing
demands under the patents asserted here on H.264 technology, and it is Motorola’s conduct in
those licensing efforts that is the subject of the Washington action.

3

Consequently, even though only Motorola is a defendant in the Washington action, this motion will treat the
plaintiffs and Motorola as one.

II.

Because Motorola’s Patent Infringement Claims Are Compulsory Counterclaims in
the Washington Action, They Should Be Dismissed or Alternatively, Stayed in This
Later Filed Action.
A.

Motorola’s Patent Infringement Claims Are Compulsory Counterclaims In
the Washington Action.

Motorola’s Wisconsin action alleges counts that are compulsory counterclaims to
Microsoft’s claims in the Washington action. A counterclaim is compulsory when it “arises out
of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim.”
Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a). Rule 13(a) seeks to “prevent multiplicity of actions and to achieve
resolution in a single lawsuit of all disputes arising out of common matters.” Washawsky, 552
F.2d at 1261; Harley-Davidson Motor Co. v. Chrome Specialists, Inc., 173 F.R.D. 250, 252 (E.D.
Wis. 1997). The Seventh Circuit considers an action to “arise[] out of the same transaction or
occurrence” if there is a logical relationship between the actions. Washawsky & Co. v. Arcata
Nat’l Corp., 552 F.2d 1257, 1261 (7th Cir. 1977); Wilde v. Beneficial International, Inc., 2007
WL 2053458 at *3 (E.D. Wis. Jul. 16, 2007). According to the Seventh Circuit, courts should
interpret the words “transaction or occurrence” liberally in order to avoid the unnecessary
expense inherent in multiplicity of litigation. Washawsky, 552 F.2d at 1261; Harley-Davidson
Motor Co. v. Chrome Specialists, Inc., 173 F.R.D. 250, 252 (E.D. Wis. 1997).
Plaintiffs’ patent infringement claims are logically related to the claims pending in the
Washington action as the patents asserted here against Microsoft’s Windows 7 product are some
of the same patents that Motorola asserts to be related to H.264 standards. Moreover, the actions
are inextricably intertwined. Motorola specifically identified all of the patents asserted in this
case in its H.264-related licensing demands directed to Microsoft, which form the basis for the
Washington action.

4

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 5 of 18

And, in Washington, Microsoft’s complaint seeks, because of Motorola’s conduct and
prior representations to the standards-setting bodies, to limit any relief under Motorola’s patents
(i.e., damages, if any, and/or injunction) that Motorola can be awarded. . Here, Motorola seeks
patent infringement damages and injunctive relief on some of the patents at issue in Washington.
Resolving the parties’ respective claims in the Washington and Wisconsin actions, necessarily
requires deciding at least some of the same core issues using the same evidence – e.g., whether
and to what extent any potential patent damages claims are limited by Motorola’s prior
representations to the standards-setting bodies. Indeed, keeping these actions separate risks
inconsistent rulings on the same fundamental issues. Avante Intern. Technology, Inc. v. Hart
Intercivic, Inc., No. 08-636-GPM, 2009 WL 2448519 *5 (S.D.Ill. July 22, 2009)(“[T]here is
great risk that consideration of the same patent by two separate federal courts will create
inconsistent results”); Admiral Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., No 68-c-578,1969
WL 9568, 3 (N.D.Ill. Feb. 14,1969)([T]he possibility of inconsistent results [should] be avoided
whenever possible.... The administration of justice will be needlessly complicated if the court
first concluding its proceedings in these matters is called upon to reconsider its decision on
account of arguments or evidence presented by other parties in related cases heard elsewhere”).
Nor does it matter that the Wisconsin action may involve more issues (e.g., infringement in
addition to damages) than the Washington action so long as “core facts are common and material
to both actions.” Harley-Davidson, 173 F.R.D. at 252. The limitation on any potential Motorola
recovery on its patent claims represents just such an indisputably material fact.
If this action is allowed to continue, Microsoft’s defenses would involve the same facts
and legal theories that underlie the Washington action. Courts routinely have found breach of
contract claims like those in the Washington action to be compulsory counterclaims to a patent

5

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 6 of 18

infringement action. See, e.g., Fit Express, Inc. v. Circuit-Total Fitness, 2008 WL 4450290
(N.D. Miss. Sept. 29, 2008) (holding that breach of contract, fraud, and misrepresentation claims
were compulsory counterclaims to patent infringement suit because both suits centered on the
validity of the same patent assignment issues); Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp., 232 F.Supp.
814, 821 (S.D.N.Y. 1964) (noting that “[w]hether or not defendant’s acts constituted an
infringement is firmly linked to the question of defendant’s rights under the agreement”). See
also, Phillips Petroleum Co. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 566 F. Supp. 1093, 1097 (D.C. Del. 1983).
Logically, the converse is also true, and Motorola’s infringement claims are likewise compulsory
counterclaims to the Washington contract claims.
Resolution of the claims in the Washington action and the Wisconsin actions require, at
least in substantial part, assessing some of the same facts and legal theories. Rule 13(a) declares
such claims to be compulsory counterclaims to prevent a multiplicity of suits and the risk of
inconsistent results.
B.

Motorola’s Compulsory Counterclaims Should Therefore Be Dismissed, or
Alternatively, Stayed.

Because Motorola’s claims are compulsory counterclaims in the Washington action, the
proper course here is to dismiss this case or, at a minimum, to stay it pending resolution of the
Washington case. Wilde, 2007 WL 2053458 at *6. See also, 6 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §1418
(3d. ed.). “There is a rebuttable presumption that the first case filed should proceed and the
second case be abated.” Inforizons, Inc. v. VED Software Services, Inc., 204 F.R.D. 116, 120
(N.D. Ill. 2001). “In general, where a claim pending before a court is most properly brought as a
compulsory counterclaim in an earlier-filed suit in another court, the recommended course is for
the court in which the compulsory counterclaim is pending to stay proceedings or to dismiss the

6

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 7 of 18

counterclaim with leave to refile it in the earlier-filed suit.” Avante, 2009 WL 2431993 (S. D. Ill.
2009).
As the first filed case, Microsoft’s Washington action should proceed. Motorola and
General Instrument “bear[] the burden of showing a compelling circumstance or imbalance of
convenience to overcome the presumption that the second filed case should be dismissed in favor
of the first-filed case.” Inforizons, 204 F.R.D. at 120. Moreover, dismissal is favored “when it is
absolutely clear that dismissal will not adversely affect a litigant's interests.” Wilde, 2007 WL
2053458 at *6, citing Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Paramount Liquor Co., 203
F.3d 442, 444 (7th Cir. 2000).
Here, there are no compelling circumstances or any imbalance of convenience that
overcomes the presumption that the Wisconsin actions should be dismissed. Dismissal would
not adversely affect plaintiffs’ interests because Motorola and General Instrument could bring
their patent infringement allegations as counterclaims in the Washington Action – indeed, those
counterclaims are compulsory. And given recently-filed nature of both actions, there are no
procedural barriers to Motorola pursuing such counterclaims in the Washington action.
Alternatively, if the Court has any concern that plaintiffs’ claims cannot be completely
litigated in the Washington action, it should stay the Wisconsin cases pending resolution of the
Washington action. See Inforizons, 204 F.R.D. at 120.
III.

If the Wisconsin Actions Are Not Dismissed or Stayed, the Court Should Transfer
the Actions Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404.
Even if Motorola’s patent infringement claims were not compulsory counterclaims to the

Washington Action, the Wisconsin Action should be transferred to the Western District of
Washington pursuant to 28 U.S. C. § 1404. Section 1404(a) allows a district court to transfer if
(1) venue is proper in the transferor district, (2) the transferee court is in a district where the

7

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 8 of 18

action may have originally been brought, and (3) the transfer is in the interests of justice. 28
U.S.C. 1404(a). See also, Coffey v. Van Dorn. Iron Works, 796 F.2d 217, 219-20 (7th Cir. 1986).
The Wisconsin action satisfies all three of these factors, because Microsoft does not dispute that
venue is proper in this district, the Plaintiffs’ current action could have been brought against
Microsoft in the Western District of Washington, and the interests of justice would be served
best by a single court resolving the intertwined issues explained above.
In analyzing the interests of justice prong of § 1404, courts consider a number of factors
in deciding whether to transfer venue: (1) the plaintiff’s choice of forum; (2) the situs of
material events; (3) the convenience of the parties; (4) the convenience of non-party witnesses;
(5) the court’s power to compel the appearance of unwilling witnesses and the costs of obtaining
attendance of witnesses; (6) the location of physical evidence; (7) the relative familiarity of the
courts with applicable law; (8) the relationship between the forum community and the subject of
the litigation; (9) the congestion of the respective court dockets; and (10) whether transfer would
facilitate the consolidation of cases. Baymont Franchising, LLC v. Heartland Properties, LLC,
No. 05-C-0606, 2005 WL 2922225, *2 (E.D. Wis. Nov. 3, 2005), citing, Amoco Oil Co. v. Mobil
Oil Corp., 90 F. Supp. 2d 958, 960 (N.D. Ill. 2000). See also, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. v.
Magellan Navigation, Inc., 512 F. Supp. 2d 1169, 1176-77 (W.D. Wis. 2007); Connexus Credit
Union v. Connex Credit Union, 219 F.R.D. 465, 467 (W.D. Wis. 2003). As explained below, the
balance of these factors clearly weighs in favor of transfer to the Western District of Washington
where the related Washington action is already pending. Microsoft therefore asks the Court to
transfer the Wisconsin actions to the Western District of Washington.

8

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 9 of 18

A.

Because the Western District of Wisconsin Is Not Plaintiffs’ Home Forum,
Their Choice of Forum Receives No Special Deference.

In any venue transfer analysis, the plaintiff’s choice of forum receives little weight where
the chosen forum lacks any significant connection to the claims at issue. Chicago Rock Island
and Pacific R.R. Co. v. Igoe, 220 F.2d 299, 304 (7th Cir. 1955); Encyclopaedia Britannica, 512
F. Supp. 2d. at 1176 (plaintiff’s choice of forum receives “no special deference” where the
chosen forum is not plaintiff’s home forum).
The Western District of Wisconsin has no significant connection to plaintiffs’ claims.
Motorola is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Libertyville, Illinois
and has no particular relationship to this district. Similarly, General Instrument is also a
Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Horsham, Pennsylvania. Motorola
and General Instrument have not identified any activity or witnesses in the Western District of
Wisconsin, nor is Microsoft aware of any such activity or witnesses. Additionally, none of the
named inventors of the patents-in-suit are from Wisconsin, further illustrating a lack of
connection to the Wisconsin forum. As a result, this factor does not weigh against transfer.
B.

The Western District of Washington Is the Situs of the Material Events at
Issue.

This case involves accused activities in the Western District of Washington where
Microsoft is headquartered and operates. Microsoft has tens of thousands of employees in the
Redmond, Washington area, within the Western District of Washington. See Technical Concepts
L.P. v. Zurn Indus., Inc., No. 02 CV 5150, 2002 WL 31433408, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 31, 2002)
(holding that the location of the alleged infringer’s “princip[al] place of business is often the
critical and controlling consideration” because patent infringement suits “often focus on the
activities of the alleged infringer, its employees, and its documents” (internal citations omitted)).
The accused Microsoft Windows 7 product was designed in the Redmond area. Andersen Decl.,
9

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 10 of 18

¶ 7. Motorola’s infringement contentions are at such a vague level, however, that it is not
possible at this stage to identify specific individuals or entities responsible for the operations that
Motorola alleges to be infringing. In any event, Microsoft’s development and management
teams responsible for the Windows 7 product are based in the Redmond area in the Western
District of Washington, and it is highly likely that the relevant witnesses would be found on
those teams. Andersen Decl.,¶ 7. Similarly, witnesses with knowledge of sales, marketing, and
finance with respect to the accused product reside in the Western District of Washington.
Andersen Decl., ¶¶8-9.
Conversely, the Western District of Wisconsin has no relationship to the facts at issue,
and tellingly, Motorola alleges venue solely based on the fact that Microsoft’s products are sold
within the district. Complaint, d/e 1 at 3. That fact makes this district no more unique than any
other Federal judicial district, as Windows 7 and products employing it are sold nationwide. But,
Microsoft has no relevant operations or employees in this district. See generally, Andersen
Decl.. And as explained in the last section, plaintiffs have no established relationship to this
district. This factor weighs strongly in favor of transfer.
C.

The Western District of Washington Is a More Convenient Location for the
Parties.

As explained above, neither Motorola, nor General Instrument, nor Microsoft is located
in the Western District of Wisconsin. All Microsoft’s company witnesses and representatives are
located within the Western District of Washington, and no Microsoft witnesses, company or
third-party, are located in Wisconsin. Andersen Decl., ¶¶ 9-12. Microsoft is aware of no
Motorola or General Instruments witnesses in the Western District of Wisconsin. Moreover,
based on Patent Office records, none of the inventors appear to be from Wisconsin but are
instead located in San Diego, California.

10

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 11 of 18

Venue in the Western District of Wisconsin would require all three parties to travel for
court hearings and trial. Admittedly¸ the Western District of Wisconsin courthouse in Madison
is geographically closer to Motorola’s headquarters in Illinois than the Western District of
Washington court.4 Motorola’s Illinois facilities, on the other hand, are close to O’Hare airport
and would allow its corporate headquarters witnesses easy and direct access to the Western
District of Washington.5 O’Hare is one of the largest airports in the United States and on any
given day has dozens of flights departing to and arriving from the Seattle airport.6 General
Instruments is located in Pennsylvania, so although the Western District of Wisconsin is
physically closer, it is likely no easier for travel. On the other hand, the Western District of
Wisconsin is a substantially more inconvenient location for potential Microsoft witnesses. The
Dane County Airport in Madison does not have flights directly to the west coast.7 Microsoft’s
witnesses would have to fly into Chicago’s O’Hare airport and then drive three additional hours
to Madison.8

4

, Motorola’s Libertyville headquarters is about a two-hour drive from the courthouse in Madison with driving time
calculated by Bing.com/maps by entering in Motorola’s Libertyville headquarters (600 North US Hwy 45,
Libertyville IL) as a starting point, and the Western District of Wisconsin’s courthouse (120 North Henry Street,
Madison, WI) as an end point.

Driving time calculated by Bing.com/maps by entering in Motorola’s Libertyville headquarters (600 North US

The flight time between O’Hare and Seattle is approximately four hours. Daily arrival/departure information for
O’Hare available at http://www.flychicago.com/PassengerInformation/FlightInformation/Default.aspx.

Dane County Airport flight hub information available at: http://www.msnairport.com/planning/where.aspx.

The Milwaukee airport is somewhat closer to Madison than O’Hare Airport (1 hour and 20 minutes, as calculated
by Bing.com/maps entering General Mitchell Airport as the starting point and 120 North Henry Street, Madison, WI
as an end point). However, in the month of November, 2010 General Mitchell airport had only 5 flights
entering/leaving from/to the Seattle Airport, making it unlikely that Microsoft witnesses could fly directly into
Milwaukee from Seattle. See General Mitchell Monthly Data Report, available at
http://www.mitchellairport.com/facts.html. Alternately, regional connecting flights are available between O’Hare
and Madison.

11

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 12 of 18

The relatively small increase in travel time for Motorola’s headquarters witnesses does
not outweigh the clear convenience to Microsoft witnesses (with General Instrument’s witnesses
being neutral) that would result from trying this case in the Western District of Washington. See,
e.g. Heckler & Koch, Inc. v. Precision Airsoft, LLC, 1:09-cv-485-SEB-JMS, 2010 WL 1257450
*2 (S.D.Ind. Mar. 25, 2010) (holding that with modern transportation and the relatively small
increase in travel time involved in transporting witnesses from Georgia and Virginia to
Washington State instead of Indianapolis did not outweigh the “clear convenience that would be
gained by Defendant if this case were litigated in Washington State”).
As a result, the balance of the convenience to the parties weighs in favor of transfer. See
International Truck and Engine Corp. v. Dow-Hammond Trucks Co., 221 F. Supp. 2d 898, 905
(N.D. Ill. 2002) (holding that where the conduct giving rise to the dispute took place in
California, convenience to the parties weighed in favor of transfer to California, where the
defendant was located).
D.

The Western District of Washington Is a More Convenient Location for NonParty Witnesses.

Neither party has identified any third-party witnesses from Wisconsin. In fact, the
inventors for the patents-in-suit are all from California. If any of these inventors are called as
witnesses, Washington would clearly be a much closer and geographically more convenient
location for these witnesses. This factor weighs in favor of transfer.
E.

The Western District of Washington Provides Compulsory Process to
Compel the Attendance of Unwilling Witnesses.

Transferring the case to the Western District of Washington does not adversely affect the
availability of compulsory process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses. Microsoft is
not aware of any potential witnesses who would be subject to compulsory process in Wisconsin.
Thus, this factor is neutral in the transfer analysis.
12

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 13 of 18

F.

The Western District of Washington Provides Easier Access to Physical
Evidence.

The Western District of Washington provides easier access to documentary evidence
because Microsoft is located there, material events occurred there, and material witnesses reside
there. See, In re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1343-45 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that in
patent infringement cases “the bulk of the relevant evidence” is often from the defendant, and
therefore “the place where the defendant’s documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that
location”). Much of the documentary evidence related to the accused products is located at
Microsoft’s facilities in Redmond, Washington. Andersen Decl., ¶ 6. Conversely, Microsoft is
not aware of any documentary proof in the Western District of Wisconsin. Accordingly, this
factor weighs in favor of transfer.
G.

The District Court in the Western District of Washington Is Familiar With
Applicable Law.

Plaintiffs accuse Microsoft of patent infringement, which raises issues of federal patent
law and which both federal district courts are equally competent to address. Brunswick Bowling
v. Qubica USA, Inc., No. 05-c-3603, 2005 WL 2367764 *5 (N.D.Ill. Sep. 26, 2005) (Patent
infringement cases involve questions of federal law, district courts are “equally competent to
decide such matters”). Indeed, the accused Windows 7 product is available in every judicial
district nationwide. This factor is neutral in the § 1404 transfer analysis.
H.

The Western District of Washington Has a Closer Relationship to This Suit
Than the Western District of Wisconsin.

The Western District of Washington has a real and substantial interest in resolving
Motorola’s claims that Microsoft has infringed the patents-in-suit. Microsoft is a large and
prominent employer in the Puget Sound (Seattle area) region. Andersen Decl., ¶ 3. Residents of
the Western District of Washington area have a strong interest in resolving disputes over

13

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 14 of 18

Microsoft’s ability to develop and distribute its products. See Hoffman-La Roche, 587 F.3d at
1336. Correspondingly, Motorola affirmatively sought out Microsoft in Washington in its
licensing demands that form the basis of the Washington action, and Microsoft’s Washington
action seeks to limit any damages that Motorola might ever be awarded based on Windows 7’s
H.264 implementations. Conversely, the Western District of Wisconsin has minimal interest in
this case, while Washington has substantial interest in policing conduct directed at its residents.
Furthermore, the Federal Circuit has recently decided a number of mandamus cases
where it has instructed courts to transfer patent cases where, as here, there is “no meaningful
connection between the venue and the case.” In re TS Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315, 1318
(Fed. Cir. 2009) (entering writ of mandamus ordering the lower court to transfer case on the
grounds that the lower court had given too much weight to plaintiff’s choice of forum, ignored
precedent in assessing cost of attendance for witnesses, disregarded evidence that witnesses
would need to travel hundreds of miles to attend trial, failed to consider that access to sources of
proof would be easier in the transferee district, and disregarded precedent in analyzing the public
interest in having localized interests decided in the home forum). See also, In re Genentech,
Inc., 566 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Microsoft Corp., Docket No. 944 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 8,
2010), available at http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/2010-m944.118-10.1.pdf.
This factor weighs in favor of transfer.

Case: 3:10-cv-00699-bbc Document #: 26 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 15 of 18

I.

The Western District of Washington is Not Substantially Slower to Trial
Than the Western District of Wisconsin.

The relative congestion between the two districts is a neutral factor.9 Indeed, as
explained above, any final resolution of the infringement action here must await the
determination in Washington as to what, if any, limits there may be on Motorola’s ability to
recover damages. In addition, Microsoft understands that Motorola has licensed the patents in
suit. That Motorola has accepted license fees for using the patent technology indicates that it
could be fully compensated by a reasonable royalty, thus making a swift trial a less critical
factor. Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Siliconix Inc., No. 05-C-732-S, 2006 WL 517628, *5
(W.D. Wis. Mar. 2, 2006); Encyclopaedia Britannica, 512 F. Supp. 2d at 1176.
J.

Transfer Would Facilitate Consolidation of Related Cases.

As explained supra, Motorola’s patent infringement claims are compulsory counterclaims
to, or at the very least are very closely related to, the claims in the Washington Action, such that
they should be transferred to the Western District of Washington so that they can be consolidated
with the Washington action. Transferring this case to Washington would avoid duplicative
