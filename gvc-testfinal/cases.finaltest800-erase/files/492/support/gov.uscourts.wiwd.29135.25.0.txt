moves this Court for an order dismissing Motorola Mobility, Inc. and General Instrument
Corporation’s (collectively, “Motorola”) complaint on the basis that it asserts claims that are
compulsory counterclaims in Microsoft’s pending suit (2:10-cv-1823) against Motorola in the
Western District of Washington.1
