No. CR08-814-PHX-DGC
MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF

Defendant.

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion To Dismiss For Lack Of Access To Seized Storage Device Drive Images. All
18 members of the defendant's court-appointed defense refuse to purchase the computer
19 hardware/software needed in order for the defendant to gain access to the seized storage
20 device drive images—even after the Court approved funding for the task. Considering all
21 members of the defense refuse to assist the defendant with gaining access to the seized
22 storage device drive images, it was agreed that the government would file a motion for
23 authorization to purchase the needed hardware/software so that the defendant could access
24 the seized storage device drive images in the possession of the government. See July 22,
25 2011 Order at Dkt. # 581-1, p. 2 (“The Court [] indicated [at the July 20, 2011 status
26 conference] that it would be willing to sign an order authorizing the government to purchase
27 certain computer equipment for Defendant, to be reimbursed with court funds.”). Over one
28 month after the agreement, the government has not provided the defense with the needed

1 computer hardware/software nor has the government provided the defense with the seized
2 storage device drive images. The defendant has been incarcerated since August 3, 2008 and
3 he has been waiting to view vital evidence contained on the seized storage device drive
4 images since arriving in Arizona from California more than three years ago. The defendant
5 has been personally attempting to gain access to the seized storage device drive images since
6 he began representing himself in January of 2009. The defendant cannot continue further
7 with his defense preparation unless he has access to the seized storage device drive images.

8 Most pressing, the defendant needs to access the seized storage device drive images in order
9 to prepare certain sections of his Motion To Suppress.
10

The government is obligated to provide the defendant with the seized storage device

11 drive images pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Brady v.
12 Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 (9th
13 Cir. 2000). With respect to seized storage device drive images specifically, in State v.
14 Dingman the court reversed a conviction and remanded for a new trial after finding that the
15 trial court erred by denying the defendant meaningful access to hard drives seized from his
16 house. See id., 202 P.3d 388 (Wash App. 2009).
17

The defendant respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the case with prejudice due

18 to the defendant being unable to access the seized storage device drive images needed for
19 defense preparation.
20

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

21 however, he authorizes his shadow counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this motion and all
22 attachments on his behalf using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has
23 never attended law school. The defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be
24 liberally construed and held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
25 lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).
26

LRCrim 12.2(a) requires that the undersigned include the following statement in all

27 motions: “Excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(D) will occur as a result of this
28 motion or of an order based thereon.”
