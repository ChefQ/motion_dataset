The United States, by and through its attorneys undersigned, hereby respectfully responds
to defendant Daniel David Rigmaiden’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Access to Seized Storage
Device Drive Images at Docket No. 603. The government has been engaged in a lengthy and
ongoing process to provide defendant with access to the digital storage devices that were seized
in this case. Initially, the parties worked toward defendant hiring a reliable computer expert who
could safely and securely store mirrored images of the subject devices. Unfortunately, it appears
that defendant was unable to obtain one. In the interim, defendant has been provided with a
detailed index of the contents of the storage devices and the government has been willing to
respond to defendant’s innumerable, varied and complex individual discovery requests during

Case 2:08-cr-00814-DGC Document 630 Filed 09/22/11 Page 2 of 6

1

this same time period. If there are any individual items that defendant needs that are located on

2

the devices, arrangements could have, and can be made, to produce them for defendant. In the

3

interest of keeping this case moving forward, the government offered to assist defendant and the

4

Court with handling the costs of modifying defendant’s computer in order to allow him to access

5

the devices while in custody. The assistance was temporarily delayed while the government

6

focused its attention on defendant’s recent 110 page motion for discovery. The government’s

7

offer appears to be unprecedented in this District. In light of this fact, the lead prosecutor

8

assigned to the case has been required to request approval from his legal management team, his

9

Administrative Office and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys in Washington, DC.

10

The apparent final approval was just received on September 19, 2011.

11

Clearly, a motion to dismiss is inappropriate at this time. The evidence remains secure

12

and available for defendant’s examination once he has the proper computer equipment to

13

examine it. Defendant has suffered no prejudice by this delay. Moreover, the government is

14

unaware of any materials located on the devices that will aid defendant in his defense in this

15

case. It also appears from the government’s perspective any significant delay was not caused

16

by the government. Now that the final approval to permit the subject assistance has been

17

obtained, the government is attaching a proposed form of Order so that the parties and the Court

18

can continue moving forward with this endeavor. (See Exhibit 1, Proposed Order.) In addition,

19

for the Court’s information, the government has decided to bear the expense for any required

20

hard drive(s) and encryption software that will allow defendant access to the contents of the

21

devices.
For the above stated reasons, the United States respectfully requests that defendant’s

22
23

Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Access to Seized Storage Device Drive Images be denied.
