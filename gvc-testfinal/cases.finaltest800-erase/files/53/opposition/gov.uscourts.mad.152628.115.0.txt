Crim No.13-10200-GAO

GOVERNMENT=S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT=S MOTION TO SET
DATE FOR PRE-AUTHORIZATION PRESENTATION TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY
The United States of America, by and through its
undersigned counsel, respectfully opposes defendant=s motion for
an order requiring the United States Attorney to hear a
presentation of mitigating factors from him on an unspecified
date to be set in the future, which would effectively preclude
the United States Attorney from making a death-penalty
authorization recommendation to the Attorney General until after
that date.

As grounds for this opposition, the government

states the following:
BACKGROUND
The United States Attorney=s Manual (AUSAM@) sets forth
internal Department of Justice policies and procedures,
including procedures to be followed in potential death penalty
cases.

See USAM '' 9-10.010 to 9-10.190.

It provides (among

other things) that the Attorney General himself will make the
final decision about whether to seek the death penalty.
9-10.040.

USAM '

To facilitate that decision, the United States

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 2 of 13

Attorney in the charging district must make a confidential
submission of relevant information to the Attorney General “as
expeditiously as possible.”

USAM ' 9-10.040.

Before doing so,

the United States Attorney must give the defendant “a reasonable
opportunity to present any facts, including any mitigating
factors, for the consideration of the United States Attorney.”
USAM ' 9-10.080.

In this case, the government has informed

defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev that he must make his presentation
on or before October 24, 2013 (i.e. approximately six months
after the date of the crimes charged in the indictment), so that
the United States Attorney can make her recommendation to the
Attorney General on or about October 31, 2013.
Defendant now asks the Court to order the United States
Attorney to hear his presentation on a later, unspecified date
to be set some time in the future.

In so doing, he necessarily

is also asking the Court to bar the United States Attorney from
communicating her death-penalty authorization recommendation to
the Attorney General until after that unspecified future date.
He argues that the Court may do these things pursuant to its
“inherent scheduling authority,” and that it should do them
because the October 24, 2013 date does not give him a
“reasonable opportunity” to present mitigating factors for the
United States Attorney=s consideration.
2

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 3 of 13

Defendant=s motion must be denied for two reasons.

First,

as defendant appears to acknowledge, USAM procedures create no
legal rights and cannot be enforced by the courts.

Because this

Court has no authority to order the United States Attorney to
hear a mitigation presentation in the first place, it has no
authority to order the United States Attorney to do so on a
particular date.

Second, although the Court need not reach this

question, the October 24, 2013 date provides defendant with a
“reasonable opportunity” to make a meaningful mitigation
presentation while vindicating the strong public and
governmental interest in moving this case forward as
expeditiously as possible.

Defendant=s argument to the contrary

is based on a fundamental misapprehension of the purpose of the
mitigation presentation.
ARGUMENT
A.

Courts Have No Legal Authority to Set Dates For
Internal DOJ Procedures Such as the Pre-Authorization
Meeting With Defense Counsel.

The very first paragraph of the USAM explains its limited
purpose:
The United States Attorneys' Manual is
designed as a quick and ready reference for
United States Attorneys, Assistant United
States Attorneys, and Department attorneys
responsible for the prosecution of
violations of federal law. It contains
general policies and some procedures
3

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 4 of 13

relevant to the work of the United States
Attorneys' offices . . . . The Manual
provides only internal Department of Justice
guidance. It is not intended to, does not,
and may not be relied upon to create any
rights, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law by any party in any
matter civil or criminal.
In view of this language, every circuit court to consider
the question has held that the USAM=s provisions create no legal
rights and cannot be enforced by the courts.

See, e.g., United

States v. Lopez-Matias, 522 F.3d 150, 155-156 (1st Cir.)
(collecting cases), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 901 (2008); United
States v. Slone, ___ F.Supp.___, 2013 WL 5217932, at *3 n.2
(E.D. Ky. Sept. 13, 2013) (same).

See also United States v.

Furrow, 100 F.Supp.2d 1170, 1177 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (holding that
“the death penalty authorization process does not affect either
defendant’s substantive rights or the ultimate merits of
defendant’s case [and thus] . . . is not a constitutionally
critical stage” of the proceedings); United States v. Gomez, 62
F.Supp.2d 402 (D.R.I. 1999 (same); United States v. Shakir, 113
F.Supp.2d 1182, 1188 (M.D. Tenn. 2000) (same).

Defendant thus

has no enforceable right to make a mitigation presentation to
the United States Attorney at all, let alone to do so on a date
of his (or the Court’s) choosing.
Defendant sweeps aside this dispositive principle as if it
4

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 5 of 13

were beside the point.

He argues that even if he has no right

to make a mitigation presentation, the Court can nevertheless
order the United States Attorney to allow him to do so on a
particular date as an exercise of its “inherent scheduling
authority.”

But a court=s inherent scheduling authority does not

extend to the timing of discretionary procedures wholly within
the province of the Executive Branch.

As the Slone court

observed,
While the Court has inherent power to manage its
docket and to some extent supervise the administration
of criminal justice, it may not direct the Executive
Branch how to exercise its traditional prosecutorial
discretion. That discretion includes the decision
whether to seek the death penalty. So, even relying
on its administrative and supervisory authority, the
Court may not direct the process by which the
government decides whether a death sentence is
appropriate. . . .
Id. at *2; accord United States v. Hardrick, No. 10-202, 2011 WL
2516340, at *2 (E.D. La. Jun. 22, 2011) (“[T]he Court finds that
its authority to ensure the speedy and orderly administration of
justice and to manage its docket does not extend to controlling
internal deadlines within the Justice Department.”); United
States v. Jackson, No. 04-801, 2006 WL 59559, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.
Jan. 9, 2006) (“The Attorney General=s capital case review
procedure to determine whether, in the exercise of discretion,
to seek the death penalty is not part of the judicial
5

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 6 of 13

function.”).
Defendant=s argument that the Court has inherent power to
delay the progress of this case in order to make it “more fair,
orderly and, indeed, cost-effective,” Deft. Mot. at 1, is also
unavailing.

As the Slone court pointed out:

[Although] district courts may direct proceedings
efficiently for the benefit of all involved in
litigation, [j]udges do not have free reign to pursue
efficiency beyond the Courts; they are limited to
managing judicial business. See Link v. Wabash R. Co.,
370 U.S. 626, 630B31 (recognizing district courts=
inherent power ‘to manage their own affairs so as to
achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of
cases’ (emphasis added)). As a result, the Court has
no administrative interest here because its
proceedings are simply not affected by the
government’s schedule for the presentation of
mitigating evidence. . . . [A defendant=s]
presentation to the DOJ does not involve the Court.
If there is any risk to the Court’s docket, it is
delay from [the defendant’s] proposed schedule rather
than the Justice Department’s implementation of the
DPP.
Id. at *4; accord Hardrick, supra, at *2 (“The presentation
of mitigation evidence to the [government] . . . is a
matter of DOJ internal procedure and does not involve the
Court.”).
CJA Guideline 6.04 likewise provides no support for
defendant=s argument.

For one thing, the CJA Guidelines, like

the USAM, are entirely advisory and create no legal rights.
at *3.

Id.

For another thing, the entire purpose of CJA Guideline
6

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 7 of 13

6.04 is to control litigation costs by speeding up, rather than
slowing down, the death-penalty authorization process.

See Jon

B. Gould & Lisa Greenman, Judicial Conference Committee on
Defender Services, Update on the Cost and Quality of Defense
Representation in Federal Death Penalty Cases (September 2010),
at 106 (“Courts should exercise their supervisory powers to
ensure that the death penalty authorization process proceeds
expeditiously.”) (Attachment “A”).
Defendant=s heavy reliance on United States v. McGill, Case
No. 09-CR-2856-IEG (S.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 2010) -- an unpublished
district court order from the Southern District of California -highlights the weakness of his legal argument.

The court in

McGill was simply wrong when it stated that “[i]n issuing a
scheduling order [for a mitigation presentation], the Court is
not granting defendant any new right or invading the province of
the Department of Justice.” Id. at *4.

On the contrary, as

explained earlier, for a Court to order the United States
Attorney to hear a defendant=s mitigation presentation on a
particular date is effectively to grant him a right to it.
Similarly, the decision whether to seek the death penalty
in a given case -- and how to go about making the decision -are matters exclusively within the province of the Department of
Justice.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that making
7

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 8 of 13

investigatory and prosecutorial decisions is a “core executive
constitutional function,” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S.
456, 465 (1996), and therefore “outside the supervision of the
court,” Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481
U.S. 787, 807 (1987).

In keeping with this bedrock Separation-

of-Powers principle, several courts have held that “the Court
has no authority to interfere with internal DOJ policy governing
the prosecutorial decision of whether to seek the death
penalty.” Shakir, 113 F.Supp.2d at 1191; accord United States v.
Savage, No. 07-550-06, 2011 WL 6747479, at *2 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 23,
2011) (holding that a defense request to overrule the
government’s timeline for a mitigation presentation “is
essentially [a request] that we interfere with the discretionary
authority granted to the Government in making the decision as to
whether to seek the death penalty”); Jackson, supra, at *2
(holding that, as a legal matter, the process of obtaining
defense counsel=s views on death-penalty authorization decision
“is a process for the Attorney General to administer as he sees
fit”).
In short, the Court should deny defendant’s motion because
courts lack legal authority to manage internal Department of
Justice procedures concerning the decision to seek the death
penalty.

B.

The October 24, 2013 Meeting Date Provides Defendant
With a “Reasonable Opportunity” to Make a Mitigation
Presentation While Also Vindicating the Strong Public
And Governmental Interest in Moving This Case Forward.

Although the Court need not reach the question, the
scheduled October 24, 2013 meeting date allows defendant a
“reasonable opportunity” to make a mitigation presentation to
the United States Attorney.

Defendant’s argument to the

contrary reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of the
mitigation-presentation procedure.
adversary proceeding.

That procedure is not an

It offers the defense a reasonable

opportunity to present “facts, including any mitigating
factors,” that it wishes to bring to the government’s attention.
Of greatest interest to the government, especially in this case,
are any facts, circumstances, or conditions that the government
might not already be aware of or that the defense would like to
highlight for the government’s consideration.

The six months

during which the defense team has been diligently working on
this case have given them a “reasonable opportunity” to marshal
such information.

Cf. Savage, supra, at *4 (“[S]tatistics

[about ‘average’ time between indictment and authorization
decision] derived from cases where the facts and investigatory
needs of counsel are not known are of little value”).
Defendant’s claim that the government has unfairly rushed
9

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 10 of 13

him is simply false.

The October 24, 2013 date is a full six

months after the events giving rise to the charges in the
Indictment.

A team of experienced public defenders was

appointed to represent defendant on April 22, 2013, and an
attorney learned in the law applicable to capital cases was
added to the team on April 29, 2013, just 10 days after his
arrest.

On information and belief, defense counsel have been

meeting with defendant nearly every day or every other day since
then, as well as actively investigating potential mitigating
factors by meeting with his family members and others.

The

Special Administrative Measures of which defendant complains in
his motion did not go into effect until September 4, 2013, and
they do not hinder attorney-client meetings.

And the two brief

delays (in returning an indictment and providing automatic
discovery) that the government requested, and to which defendant
assented, benefitted the defense team as well as the government
by lengthening their opportunity to build trust with the
defendant and to conduct a mitigation investigation.
Although defendant complains that he needs more time to
review discovery, that is not a valid reason for delaying his
meeting with the United States Attorney.

For one thing, as

noted earlier, the chief purpose of that meeting is not for
defendant to comment on information received from the government
10

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 11 of 13

but rather for him to provide potentially mitigating information
that he has gathered from his own independent investigation.
For another thing, although the government has produced a
large volume of information to the defense, much of the most
compelling evidence is not voluminous.

That evidence consists

of surveillance video of the defendant’s planting a bomb at the
Marathon; an eyewitness who will testify that the defendant
carjacked, kidnaped, and robbed him; fingerprint, DNA, and
ballistics evidence linking the defendant and his brother to the
murder of Officer Sean Collier; several Watertown police
officers who will testify that the defendant tried to kill them
with explosives and gunfire; and a statement written in pen on
an inside wall of the boat where the defendant was hiding in
which he explains that the killing of innocent people was meant
to punish America for its actions overseas.

The surveillance

video and defendant’s statements were produced to the defense on
May 10, 2013 (i.e. less than four weeks after his arrest).

The

fingerprint, DNA, and ballistics evidence were provided as part
of automatic discovery on September 3, 2013 (i.e. nearly two
months before the scheduled meeting).

And the witness

statements were likewise produced on September 3, 2013 (even
though, as Jencks material, the statements did not have to be
produced until much later).
11

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 12 of 13

Also, it bears emphasis that in producing discovery, the
government has gone far beyond what is required by the
Constitution and the Federal and Local Rules.

It has produced

much more than is required, and it has produced many things much
earlier than required.

Its overproduction and early production

of information should not be used to justify unauthorized
judicial control of internal DOJ procedures.
As defendant knows, moreover, the scheduled October 24,
2013 meeting with the United States Attorney is only his first
opportunity to present mitigating information during the deathpenalty authorization process.

If the United States Attorney

recommends that the government seek the death penalty, the
defense will be given an opportunity to present mitigation
evidence and argument directly to the Attorney General’s Capital
Review Committee.

See USAM 9-10.120.

And even if the Attorney

General then authorizes the government to seek the death penalty
and to file a corresponding notice of intent, the defense may
still request that the notice be withdrawn if new mitigation
evidence comes to light.

See USAM 9-10.150.

Finally, the October 24, 2013 meeting date set by the
government reflects the strong public interest in moving this
case forward expeditiously.

Defendant is accused of one of the

most serious terrorist attacks against civilians on American
12

Case 1:13-cr-10200-GAO Document 115 Filed 10/15/13 Page 13 of 13

soil since September 11, 2001.

He is charged with brutally

murdering two women and a small child; maiming, blinding, and
deafening scores of others; carjacking a victim and then robbing
him; executing a police officer; and then attempting to murder
other police officers with bombs and gunfire.

The victims, who

were most affected by the charged crimes, as well as the general
public, are entitled to see justice done in this case without
undue delay.
WHEREFORE, the government respectfully requests that the
Court deny defendant’s motion for an order directing the United
States Attorney to delay hearing a mitigation presentation and
making a recommendation to the Attorney General until some
unspecified future date.

Respectfully submitted,
CARMEN M. ORTIZ
United States Attorney
