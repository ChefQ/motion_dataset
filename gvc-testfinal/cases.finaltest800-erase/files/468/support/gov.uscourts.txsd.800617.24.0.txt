DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS PENDING
REEXAMINATION OF U.S. PATENT NO. 7,249,372

AND REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY SUBMISSION

COMES NOW, Defendant Extended DISC North America, Inc. ("EDNA") and files this its
Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 7,249,372 with
accompanying Memorandum of Law, stating as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

l. Defendant EDNA moves for a stay of all proceedings in this action in light of the recently
filed request for ex parte reexamination of the patent-in-suit, United States Letters Patent No.
7,249,372 (filed Jan. 12, 2001) (the "372 Patent"), in the United States Patent & Trademark Office
("PTO"). The request raises substantial new questions of patentability based upon prior art not
considered in the original prosecution of the patent.

2. Because the validity and claim scope of the `372 Patent are central issues to this case, further
litigation in this Court pending the PTO's final determination will be duplicative ofthe PTO's efforts
and will waste valuable resources of the Court and the parties if the PTO ultimately declares the

asserted claims of the `372 Patent to be invalid or requires material changes in the scope of the

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/21/11 Page 2 of 12

claims. Ifa reexamination results in invalidity of the patent, the entire case will be dismissed. Ifthe
PTO determines that some or all of the asserted claims are unpatentable, then those claims would
be removed from the case, simplifying issues for trial. If any claims emerge from the reexamination
(whether the same or amended), examination of the prior art by the PTO, with its technical expertise,
will nonetheless aid the Court in claims construction and further invalidity analysis. Moreover,
because almost no work has been done on this case, a stay makes even more sense. Staying the case
now, while the PTO considers the request will save the parties and the Court needless costs of
litigation.
Il. BACKGROUND
A. Nature and Current Stage of the Proceeding

3. Plaintiff Target Training International, Ltd. ("TTI"), as the assignee of the 372 Patent, sued
EDNA alleging direct and indirect infringement of "at least claim 1" of the `372 Patent. See
Plaintiff's Original Complaint [Dkt. No. 1]. In response, EDNA filed a motion to dismiss under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b){6), which is currently pending before the Court [Dkt. No. 9].
Since the filing of this lawsuit and during the pendency of EDNA's motion to dismiss, an extensive
effort to gather pertinent prior art references has been undertaken, which shows that the alleged
invention was disclosed in public documents before the original patent owners filed their earliest
patent application. A central issue in this litigation will be the validity of the `372 Patent under
several sections of Title 35 of the U.S. Code, including 35 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7102 and 103 in light of'prior art.
4, On January 14, 2011, a request for ex parte reexamination of the `372 Patent was filed by
Extended DISC International, Ltd. ("EDI") with the PTO. A copy of the Request for Reexamination
which details the substantial new questions of patentability, and supporting Declaration of Jukka

Sappinen are attached. See Appendix, Ex. A. EDNA, party to this litigation, is an authorized

FADOCS\3955\000 I\Motiaon to Stay.pld.wpd 2

 
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/21/11 Page 3 of 12

reseller of EDI's online assessment tools in North America. The online platform developed by EDI
appears to be the target of TTI's patent infringement suit. Thus, importantly, determination of the
validity of the `372 Patent affects not only EDNA, but also EDI, its many other resellers around the
world, their downstream sellers, and many competitors as well as non-competitors of EDI/EDNA
that utilize an online platform for assessment tools, whether employee-related or otherwise.
5. The request is based upon four highly relevant and material prior art references that were not
disclosed, cited, or considered by the examiner during the original prosecution. These references
disclose the methods and systems of every single claim of the `372 Patent (claims 1-11). Therefore,
these references raise substantial new questions of patentability and, if fairly considered by the PTO,
the `372 Patent will be invalidated.
B. The Technology

6. The `372 Patent discloses a known method whereby employee evaluation firms sell, license,
or otherwise market employee evaluation forms and employee evaluation systems to other
businesses. In the usual manner, the forms are sold to businesses that utilize the forms to evaluate
their employees. Forms are usually delivered to the businesses on printed paper.
7. The `372 Patent relates to a method of distributing documents that includes the step of
displaying the documents on a web site. Responses to the documents are accepted on the web site.
After the responses have been accepted, they are processed into a report and the report is returned
to an interested party.

C. Reexamination Procedure in the Patent & Trademark Office
8. Because Congress has realized the "chilling effect" of the "cost incurred in defensive patent
litigation," it allows the PTO to reexamine issued patents to "permit efficient resolution of questions

about the validity of issued patents without recourse to expensive and lengthy infringement

FADOCS\3955\000 |\Mation to Stey.pld.wpd 3

 
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/21/11 Page 4 of 12

litigation." H.R. Rep. No. 96-1307(1), at 4 (1980). The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has
explained that the nature of a reexamination proceeding is to review doubtful patents in light of
information that was not considered or not fully considered by the PTO in its initial decision to issue
the patents. Jn re Etter, 756 F.2d 852, 856 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

9. Any person may file a request for reexamination. 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 302. A request for
reexamination of an issued patent permits the Director of the PTO to determine whether there is "a
substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent concerned." 35 U.S.C.
0x00A7303(a). In making the request, the requester must explain what it believes is the significance of the
new art. 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 302, Ifsuch a new question has been presented, reexamination will be ordered
by the Director. 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7304. The Director must determine within three months after the filing
of the request whether a substantial new question of patentability is presented, 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 303.
10. Moreover, the reexamination statute requires the PTO to conduct "[a]ll reexamination
proceedings under this section, including any appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and
Interferences..,with special dispatch." 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 305 (emphasis added). In addition, because the
`372 Patent is involved in litigation, the reexamination proceeding will "have priority over all other
cases." MANUAL OF PATENT EXAMINING PROCEDURES 0x00A7 2261.

11. According to the PTO's own issued statistics, ex parte reexaminations are granted in 92%
of the cases. See Ex Parte Reexamination Filing Data - September 30, 2010 at Appendix, Ex. B.
Following reexamination, patents can emerge with all the claims cancelled, all claims confirmed,
or with some or all of the claims having been changed. /d, According to the PTO statistics, of the
total ex parte reexamination certificates issued since 1981, just 23% of patents emerged with all
claims confirmed. Jd. All claims were canceled (or disclaimed) in 12% of cases and claims were

changed in 65% of cases. Id.

II. STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE
12. Should the Court exercise its discretion to stay this case in light of the PTO reexamination
of the validity of the patent-in-suit? Ethicon v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1426-27 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
IV. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES

13. District courts "have the inherent power to control [their] own docket[s], including the power
to stay proceedings." Soverain Software LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 356 F. Supp.2d 660, 662 (E.D.
Tex. 2005) (citing Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248 (1936)). This includes the authority to order
a stay pending conclusion of reexamination proceedings in the PTO. Ethicon, 849 F.2d at 1426-27.
14. _ A stay pending reexamination by the PTO benefits the district court proceedings in the
following ways:

a. All prior art presented to the Court will have been first considered by the PTO, with
its particular expertise;

b. Many discovery problems relating to prior art can be alleviated by the PTO

examination;

c. In those cases resulting in effective invalidity of the patent, the suit will likely be
dismissed;

d. The outcome of the reexamination may encourage a settlement without the further

use of the Court;

e. The record of reexamination would likely be entered at trial, thereby reducing the
complexity and length of the litigation;

f. Issues, defenses, and evidence will be more easily limited in pretrial conferences after
a reexamination; and

g. The cost will likely be reduced both for the parties and the Court.
Tesco Corp., (US) v. Varco I/P, Inc., No. H-05-2118, Slip Copy, 2006 WL 6625915, at *4 (S.D.Tex.

Nov. 9, 2006) (internal quotations and citations omitted),

FADOCS\3955\000 1\Motion to Stay.pld.wpd 5
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/21/11 Page 6 of 12

15. Reexamination can "facilitate trial of [an] issue by providing the district court with the expert
view of the PTO." Gould v. Control Laser Corp,, 705 F.2d 1340, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 1983); see also
Tesco Corp., 2006 WL 6625915, at "4. A stay is in order when the "outcome of the reexamination
would be likely to assist the court in determining patent validity and, if the claims were canceled in
the reexamination, would eliminate the need to try the infringement issue." Slip Track Sys., Inc. v.
Metal Lite, Inc., 159 F.3d 1337, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 1998).
16. In summary, a reexamination may eliminate most, if not all, of the issues in this litigation,
and, even if the claims are not cancelled, the reexamination will at least result in a narrowing and
a simplifying of the issues before the Court. Furthermore, the technical expertise provided by the
reexamination proceeding will be helpful to the Court on any issues that remain.

A. The Factors Balance in Favor of a Stay
17. Indeciding whether to stay litigation pending reexamination, district courts typically consider
three factors: "(1) whether a stay will cause undue prejudice or present a clear tactical disadvantage
to the nonmoving party; (2) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set ; and
(3) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and trial of the case." Cameras Onsite, LEC
v. Digital Mgmt. Solutions, Inc., No. H-09-2518, 2010 WL 1268054, at *2 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 24, 2010).
`Essentially, courts determine whether the benefits of a stay outweigh the inherent costs based on
these factors." Je. (quoting EchoStar Techs. Corp. v. TiVo, Inc., No. 5:05 CV 81, 2006 WL 2501494,
at *1 (E.D.Tex. Jul. 14, 2006)).

1. The first factor: A stay will not unduly prejudice or serve as a tactical disadvantage to
TTI because monetary damages are sufficient.

18. A stay will not cause any undue prejudice or serve as a clear tactical advantage to TTI. The

mere fact that a stay will cause a delay of the litigation does not constitute undue prejudice. Dataquill

Lid. v. High Tech Computer Corp., No. 08centv543-IEG-LSP, 2009 WL 1391537, at *3 (S.D. Cal. May
14, 2009); see also Alza Corp. v. Wyeth, No. Civ.A 9:06-CV-156, 2006 WL 3500015, at *1 (E.D.
Tex. Nov. 21, 2006) ("Reexamination does not threaten protracted or indefinite delay."). The statute
that gives TTI its patent rights is the same one that subjects TTI to reexamination; therefore, any
reexamination-related prejudice that TTI experiences is, by definition, not zndue. See KLA-Tencor
Corp. v. Nanometrics, Inc., No. C 05-03116 JSW, 2006 WL 708661, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16,
2006). Moreover, as discussed in more detail above, the PTO's procedures are specifically designed
to expedite the reexamination process, particularly for patents that are the subject of litigation.
Cameras Onsite, 2010 WL 1268054, at *3.

19. If TTYs patent claims are cancelled, or even modified, TTI will not suffer from a stay. In
fact, 1t will have saved litigation expenses. Even if TTI prevails in the reexamination, issues may
be simplified and any additional damages incurred during the stay will be compensable in money
damages. See JAB Distribs., LLC v. London Luxury, LLC, No. 09 C 5831, Slip Copy, 2010 WL
1882010, at *3 (N.DIIL May 11, 2010) ("Plaintiff's claim that it will suffer irreparable harm is
undermined by the fact that its complaint seeks monetary damages..."). Moreover, TTI has never
moved for a preliminary injunction; thus, any claim to be made of prejudice based upon a delay of
ultimate injunctive relief has little merit. See Cameras Onsite, 2010 WL 1268054, at *4 (granting
stay, finding that even without a stay, defendants could continue allegedly infringing activity where
plaintiff made no showing that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction); see also Magna Donnelly
Corp. v. Pilkington N.A., Inc., No. 4:06-CV-126, 2007 WL 772891, at *5 (W.D.Mich, Mar. 12,
2007) (rejecting plaintiffs argument that delay would cause irreparable damage to its business where
plaintiff had not moved for a preliminary injunction).

20. Here, all of TTI's claims surround the single patent-in-suit and, therefore, rest on the validity

FADOCS\3955\000 |\Motian to Stay.pld.wpd 7
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/21/11 Page 8 of 12

of the sole patent being reexamined. See Plaintiff's Original Complaint [Dkt. No. 1]. The benefits
of a stay for all involved - including TTI - more than outweigh any supposed prejudice resulting
from a stay. This factor weighs in favor of staying this case now.

2. The second factor: A stay will simplify the case.

21. Every cause of action in this case relates to the "372 Patent. The request for reexamination
details four significant prior art references before the PTO that were not cited by either the examiner
or the patent owner during prosecution. If the reexamination results in the patent being invalidated
based on prior art, this action will be moot. Even ifa stay is granted and the PTO does not invalidate
the claims or invalidates only some of the claims, the PTO's finding of validity would be admissible
in litigation. Cameras Onsite, 2010 WL 1268054, at *4. In either scenario involving ultimately
invalidated claims, if there is no stay, the Court and the parties will have wasted time and resources
by addressing those claims prior to the PTO's invalidation. /d. In addition, "the Court would have
the benefit of the PTO's expert analysis regarding prior art references." Id.; see also GPAC, Ine, v.
D.W.W. Enters., inc., 144 F.R.D. 60, 63 (D.N.J. 1992) (*...[T]he patent reexamination procedure
was clearly intended to provide the federal courts with the expertise of the PTO.").

22. The PTO's statistics demonstrate that in 77% of the cases claims are cancelled or changed
as a result of reexamination. See Appendix, Ex. B. There is little statistical chance that all claims
will survive reexamination without amendment. Jd. As such, a stay is a more efficient use of judicial
resources. This factor weighs heavily in favor of a stay.

3. The third factor: This case is in its infancy.

23. This case is in its very early stages. In fact, an answer is not even on file due to EDNA's
pending 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss [Dkt. No. 9]. Plaintiff has just sent out its first set of discovery

requests. No depositions have been taken. Neither party has submitted contentions or proposed

FADOCS\3955\000 Motion to Stay.pld.wpd 8

 
Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/21/11 Page 9 of 12

claim constructions to the Court, and the farkman hearing is not set until August 15,2011. Docket
call is set for May 18, 20132, fourteen months away.

24. Thesignificant amount of discovery and pretrial work that remains to be done argues in favor
ofastay. All of these discovery and pretrial procedures, including claim construction and invalidity
analysis, would benefit from, and be simplified by, the results of the reexamination. For this reason,
stays pending reexamination are common when lawsuits are at early stages such as this one, and even
when they are further along. See, e.g., Cameras Onsite, 2010 WL 1268054, at *5 (staying case that
was in its "beginning stage").

25, The fact that the PTO has not yet granted the request for reexamination should not alter this
conclusion. Courts, including courts in this district, have recognized the efficiency of staying a case
even before the PTO has granted or denied a request for reexamination. See, e.g, Magna Donnelly
Corp., 2007 WL 772891, at *6 (granting stay before the PTO ruled on request for reexamination);
Tesco Corp., 2006 WL 6625915, at *5 (same): Grayling Indus., Inc. v. GPAC, Inc., No. 1:89-CV-
451-ODE, 1991 WL 236196, at *3 (N.D.Ga. Mar. 25, 1991) (same). The PTO has three months
from the date of filing the request to decide whether a substantial question of patentability exists.
Under the current scheduling order, the next three months would require significant and costly
patent-related work to be done, including preparation of the parties' preliminary infringement and
invalidity contentions, investigating inequitable conduct claims, collecting and producing documents,
responding to written discovery, and exchange of the parties' proposed terms and claim elements
needing construction. Depositions are also likely. All of this work may be rendered moot or
significantly narrowed as a result of the outcome of reexamination. In the unlikely event the PTO
denies the request, this Court can simply lift the stay at that time. See Tesco Cerp., 2006 WL

6625915, at *5. Given the work and expenses that potentially could be saved, there is no downside

Case 4:10-cv-03350 Document 24 Filed in TXSD on 01/21/11 Page 10 of 12

to staying this case now.
26. - This factor weighs heavily in favor of granting a stay. Because "[t]he tremendous amounts
of time, money and energy usually expended in discovery and trial preparation in patent cases have
not as yet been incurred in this case,' EDNA's Motion should be granted. PIC, Inc. v. Prescon
Corp., 77 F.R.D. 678, 681 (D.C.Del. 1977).

V. REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY SUBMISSION
27. Because costs to both parties and to the Court mount each day, Defendant asks that this
Motion be submitted to the Court for consideration immediately upon filing.

VI. CONCLUSION

28. The costs of a patent suit to a small company like EDNA are sizable and potentially
disastrous. It would be an egregious waste of both the parties' and the Court's resources if the
litigation went forward and the claims were subsequently declared invalid or were amended as a
result of the reexamination proceeding. The results of a reexamination may also have a broader
impact since many companies use an online platform for various types of assessment products. A
multiplicity of lawsuits might be avoided by a stay. The factors undoubtedly weigh in favor ofa stay.
29. Defendant Extended DISC North America, Inc. respectfully requests that its Motion to Stay
Proceedings Pending Reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 7,249,372 be considered in an expedited
fashion and granted in its entirety, and that, accordingly, all further proceedings in this matter be
immediately stayed pending the resolution of the reexamination of the `372 Patent by the U.S. Patent

and Trademark Office.
