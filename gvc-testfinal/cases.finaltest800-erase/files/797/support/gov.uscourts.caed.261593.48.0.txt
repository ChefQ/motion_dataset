NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO DISMISS

1

2 TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:
3

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on September 12, 2014, at 10:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter

4 as the matter may be heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
5 California, located at 501 I Street, Sacramento, California, nominal defendant JPMorgan Chase &
6 Co. (“JPMorgan” or, with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) and the individual defendants, through
7 their undersigned counsel will, and hereby do, move to dismiss the Consolidated Shareholder
8 Derivative Complaint (“Complaint” or “Compl.”) pursuant to Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of
9 Civil Procedure for failure to make a pre-suit demand on JPMorgan’s Board of Directors and
10 pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3) for improper venue; and the individual defendants move to dismiss the
11 Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure
12 to state a claim with respect to the claim alleged under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange
13 Act of 1934. In the alternative, the nominal defendant and the individual defendants move to
14 transfer this action to the Southern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) or
15 § 1404(a).
16

The motion is based on this Notice of Motion, the supporting Memorandum of Points and

17 Authorities, the Declaration of Anthony J. Horan, the Declaration of Stuart J. Baskin, and exhibits
18 attached thereto, the complete files and records in this action, and such additional material and

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

INTRODUCTION
This action must be dismissed because the Complaint does not allege facts sufficient to

3

4 excuse Plaintiffs’ failure to make the requisite demand upon the Company’s Board of Directors
5 prior to bringing these purported derivative claims against certain current and former directors of
6 JPMorgan (the “Defendants”). On ten previous occasions, courts that have considered this issue
7 have unanimously reached the conclusion that the shareholder plaintiff failed to allege that
1
8 demand on the JPMorgan Board would be futile and was thus excused. Indeed, two of these

9 cases dealt with the exact same subject matter as this one – the issuance by the Company of
10 residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) – and under controlling New York law those
11 prior dismissals relating to RMBS collaterally estop Plaintiffs from relitigating the demand12 excused issue for a third time.
This Court need not reach the demand-excused issue in order to dispose of this action,

13

14 however, since both jurisdiction and venue are lacking. The gist of the Complaint is that
15 Defendants breached their fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the Company’s
16 RMBS-related activities. Absent a viable federal claim, there is no basis upon which this Court
17 may exercise jurisdiction over any of the Defendants: not one of them is a California resident; no
18 board meeting (or act or omission arising therefrom) occurred in California; and any injury to the
19 only relevant injured party, JPMorgan itself as the putative plaintiff in interest, would have
20 occurred in New York, where the firm is headquartered, and not in California. For similar

1 reasons, venue is lacking. Plaintiffs’ efforts to cure these deficiencies by adding a derivative
2 federal proxy claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act is unavailing not only because it fails
3 to plead demand excusal but also because it fails to state a claim and is insufficient to provide a
4 basis for pendent personal jurisdiction over the state law claims.
Finally, if the Court does not dismiss this action, fairness and efficiency support transfer

5

6 under Section 1404(a) to the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”), where a parallel
7 derivative suit raising the same RMBS-related claims is underway. The New York case has
8 already been consolidated with yet another derivative action against the JPMorgan Board and is
9 proceeding on an accelerated briefing schedule that will decide the same demand-excused issue
10 raised here. If not dismissed, this action should be transferred to the SDNY on the grounds that
11 transfer will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice,
12 particularly by avoiding the possibility of inconsistent legal and factual determinations.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

14

A.

15

Plaintiffs purport to bring this action on behalf of Nominal Defendant JPMorgan, a

The Defendants

16 Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York City. ¶ 23. The
17 Defendants are current and former members of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan. ¶¶ 25-37.
18 All of the Defendants who are currently serving on the Board (the “Director Defendants”) are
19 outside, non-management directors, with the exception of James Dimon, who is JPMorgan’s Chief
20 Executive Officer and Chairman. Id. As of the date the Complaint was filed on March 3, 2014
21 (the operative date for assessing demand futility, see Braddock v. Zimmerman, 906 A.2d 776, 785
22 (Del. 2006)), JPMorgan’s 11-member Board included 10 non-management directors, two of whom
2
23 joined the Board after the events at issue and are not named as defendants. ¶¶ 26-29, 32, 35-37.

24

B.

25

The Complaint arises out of the Company’s purchase and origination of residential

The Alleged Wrongdoing

26 mortgages and underwriting of RMBS from 2005 through 2007. ¶¶ 1, 116. Plaintiffs allege that
27
28

2

Linda B. Bammann and Michael A. Neal, who joined the Board on September 13, 2013, and
January 3, 2014, respectively, are not named as defendants.

1 JPMorgan has suffered losses from settlements concerning RMBS with the Department of Justice,
2 several state attorneys general, and other federal regulators, and may suffer additional losses from
3 possible future RMBS-related settlements or lawsuits. ¶¶ 4, 5, 14, 188, 190. The Complaint
4 alleges that in order to increase profitability the Company made an “aggressive change” in
5 business strategy to originate and securitize RMBS, ¶¶ 1, 8, 9, 116-19, and Company employees
6 evaded the Company’s controls by purchasing and originating mortgages and securitizing RMBS
7 that did not comply with the Company’s underwriting guidelines or the Company’s
8 representations in RMBS registration statements. ¶¶ 9-12, 139-53, 160-75. The Complaint claims
9 that the Defendants knew these representations and warranties were inaccurate (¶¶ 176-78), but
10 alleges no particularized facts to support this bare conclusion (as discussed in Point IV below).
11 The Complaint alleges that as a result of the alleged misrepresentations in the sale of the RMBS,
12 the Company has incurred substantial losses, including amounts paid to settle claims by federal
13 and state regulators and private parties. ¶¶ 14, 187-90.
In support of the derivative Section 14(a) claim, the Complaint alleges that the Company

14

15 was harmed because JPMorgan’s 2011 and 2012 proxy statements “falsely stated that the
16 Company’s Board of Directors maintained adequate and effective risk oversight over management
17 and failed to disclose to the Company’s shareholders material deficiencies in the Board’s oversight
18 of management and internal controls.” ¶ 306. As a result, the Complaint alleges, shareholders
19 voted to elect or re-elect directors and rejected a shareholder proposal requiring the Chairman of
20 the Board to be an independent outside director based on allegedly incomplete information. See
21 ¶¶ 193, 194, 197, 199-200, 306-07.

To be subject to general jurisdiction, an individual’s activities in a state must be “‘so

General Jurisdiction Is Unavailable

6 substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from
7 dealings entirely distinct from those activities.’” Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.
8 Brown, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2849 (2011) (citation omitted). “For an individual, the paradigm forum
9 for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile . . . .” Id. at 2853-54. The
10 Supreme Court recently confirmed the limited scope of general jurisdiction over non-resident
11 defendants in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 761-62 (2014), holding that general
12 jurisdiction usually can be asserted against a corporation only in its state of incorporation or
13 principal place of business. Here, the Complaint alleges that each of the Defendants is a citizen of
14 a state other than California (¶¶ 25-37) and does not purport to allege any other basis for general
15 jurisdiction over the Defendants.

Nor is there specific jurisdiction over any of the Defendants. A court has specific

Specific Jurisdiction Is Unavailable

18 jurisdiction over a defendant with respect to tort claims when (1) the defendant purposefully
19 directed his activities towards the state, (2) the plaintiff’s claim arises out of or relates to those
20 activities, and (3) the assertion of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and fair. Schwarzenegger v.
21 Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir. 2004). A plaintiff bears the burden of
22 establishing the first two elements of the test. Id. Only if the plaintiff succeeds in carrying its
23 burden with respect to those elements does the burden shift to the defendant to demonstrate that
24 assertion of personal jurisdiction would be unreasonable. Menken, 503 F.3d at 1057. At its core,

The alleged actions or inactions of the JPMorgan Board in connection with the issuance of

5 RMBS – which is the focus of the inquiry – are not alleged to have occurred in California. Indeed,
6 the JPMorgan Board has not held a meeting in California since May 2000, well before the relevant
7 time period at issue here. Declaration of Anthony J. Horan (“Horan Decl.”) ¶ 7. Rather, the
8 JPMorgan Board almost always meets in New York. Id. Moreover, Defendants did not
9 “purposefully direct” activities toward California in relation to the state law claims, which are not
10 brought on behalf of, and do not seek relief for, RMBS purchasers or homeowners in California.
11 These are derivative claims purportedly asserted on behalf of JPMorgan, and the only allegedly
12 injured party is JPMorgan itself, not any California citizen. Any purposeful activity in which
13 Defendants allegedly engaged occurred in and was directed to JPMorgan headquartered in New
14 York, which is why derivative suits almost always are heard in the state where a corporation has
15 its principal place of business or is incorporated.
16

This principle is illustrated by Beene v. Beene, where the court found no specific

17 jurisdiction over derivative claims brought by a California shareholder against the Tennessee
18 resident officers and directors of a Tennessee corporation. 2012 WL 3583021, at *6 (N.D. Cal.
19 Aug. 20, 2012). The court reasoned that the derivative claims were asserted on behalf of the
20 company, and thus the conduct at issue “would have been targeted at [the company] and the harm
21 would have been felt by [the company].” Id. Accordingly, the court held, “to the extent Plaintiff
22 brings derivative claims, he fails to meet his burden to show the Individual Defendants
23 purposefully directed their activities at Plaintiff or at California.” Id.
24

No doubt investors based in California – along with purchasers in many other states and

25 countries – bought some of the RMBS that the Company underwrote and issued in 2005-2007.
26 But to the extent that the Defendants allegedly failed to monitor those RMBS activities properly,
27 and thereby harmed JPMorgan, those actions and omissions were not purposefully directed to
28 California any more than to Ohio or Texas or Germany. Plaintiffs’ argument for specific

1 jurisdiction would equally allow suit to be brought anywhere and everywhere. That is not the law.
2 See Young v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 790 F.2d 567, 572 (7th Cir. 1986) (where Illinois
3 shareholder brought derivative action against non-resident directors of Colgate-Palmolive
4 challenging decision initially made at board meeting in Chicago, court held that “mere adverse
5 effects on a corporation which is present within a state are not enough” because “[d]ue process
6 does not allow the directors of a national corporation to be sued by its shareholders anywhere the
7 corporation happens to be present.”). Indeed, even in a direct action brought by allegedly harmed
8 investors, the court in In re Countrywide Financial Corporation Mortgage Backed Securities
9 Litigation held that allegations the defendant officers knew that RMBS certificates were “likely to
10 end up” with investors in California were insufficient to show purposeful direction. 2012 WL
11 1322884, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 26, 2012). The court reasoned that a contrary conclusion would
12 base personal jurisdiction over individual officers on the actions of the company and would
13 unconstitutionally “permit for nationwide jurisdiction over the control persons of any entity that
14 conducts business nationwide or releases securities to the national market.” Id. at *8-9.
15

Nor do the state law claims “arise out of” the Defendants’ alleged activities, as is required

16 for the Court to exercise specific jurisdiction. In the Ninth Circuit, “[t]he ‘arising out of’ prong
17 requires a ‘but for’ analysis, that is, the Court must ask: but for the nonresident defendants’
18 contacts with California, would plaintiffs’ claim against these defendants have arisen?” In re
19 Wireless Facilities, Inc. Deriv. Litig., 562 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1104 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (citing Ballard
20 v. Savage, 65 F.3d 1495, 1500 (9th Cir. 1995)). Here the but-for test clearly fails: Plaintiffs
21 would be able to allege the same derivative claims on JPMorgan’s behalf against the Defendants
22 regardless of whether any of JPMorgan’s RMBS-related activities occurred in or were directed
23 toward California (as opposed to all other jurisdictions).
24

Because the first two elements of the test for specific jurisdiction are not met, the Court

25 need not reach the issue of whether exercising jurisdiction would be reasonable and fair.
26 Nonetheless, application of the “reasonable and fair” factors, see Menken, 503 F.3d at 1060,
27 supports the conclusion that exercising jurisdiction here would be neither. The Defendants have

PLAINTIFFS’ NEWLY ADDED SECTION 14(a) CLAIM FAILS TO STATE A
CLAIM AND CANNOT SERVE AS A BASIS FOR PERSONAL JURISDICTION
Plaintiffs’ consolidated Complaint added a derivative federal claim under Section 14(a) of

10
the Exchange Act, for unspecified alleged misstatements and omissions regarding risk
11
management in JPMorgan’s 2011 and 2012 proxy statements. See, e.g., ¶¶ 194, 196, 201-02, 235,
12
261. This claim not only fails to meet the particularity requirements of the Private Securities
13
Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”), but also does not allege the necessary substantive elements of
14
a proxy disclosure claim. First, it does not and cannot allege the requisite economic harm or
15
causation necessary to support a claim under Section 14(a). Second, proxy claims alleging
16
corporate mismanagement or breaches of fiduciary duty not involving self-dealing (which is not
17
alleged here) are legally immaterial. Because the Section 14(a) claim fails to state a claim and
18
must be dismissed, there is no remaining federal claim that can be the basis for pendent personal
19
jurisdiction over the state law claims. Further, the federal claim cannot provide a basis for
20
personal jurisdiction in any event because it is immaterial and insubstantial and does not arise out
21

of the same nucleus of operative facts as the state law claims.4

The Section 14(a) Claim Fails To State a Claim and Should Be Dismissed

To state a claim under Section 14(a), Plaintiffs must plead “that (1) defendants made a

material misrepresentation or omission in a proxy statement; (2) with the requisite state of mind;
25
and (3) that the proxy statement was the transactional cause of harm of which plaintiff complains.

9 of those requirements.

11

1.

The Complaint Does Not Plead Causation

In order to plead a Section 14(a) claim, Plaintiffs must show both that (1) “the votes for a

12 specific corporate transaction requiring shareholder authorization . . . are obtained by a false proxy
13 statement” (i.e., transaction causation) and (2) the “transaction was the direct cause of [plaintiff’s]
14 pecuniary injury” (i.e., loss causation). In re VeriSign, Inc. Deriv. Litig., 531 F. Supp. 2d 1173,
15 1213 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (quoting Gen. Elec. Co. v. Cathcart, 980 F.2d 927, 932 (3d Cir. 1992)). In
16 other words, damages are available “‘only when the votes for a specific corporate transaction . . .
17 are obtained by a false proxy statement, and that transaction was the direct cause of the pecuniary
18 injury.’” In re HP, 2012 WL 4468423, at *11 (quoting Gen. Elec., 980 F.2d at 933). The
19 Complaint’s allegations that stockholders relied on supposed misstatements or omissions in the
20 2011 and 2012 proxy statements when they elected directors and rejected a stockholder proposal
21 requiring the Chairman of the Board to be an independent outside director, ¶¶ 193, 200, 306-07,
22 fail to fulfill these requirements.
23

The “essential link” standard requires that “the proxy statement at issue directly authorizes

24 the loss-generating corporate action.” SEC v. Mercury Interactive, LLC, 2009 WL 2984769, at *4
25 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 15, 2009) (quoting Hulliung v. Bolen, 548 F. Supp. 2d 336, 341 (N.D. Tex.
26 2008)). Here, the “loss-generating corporate action” is supposedly mismanagement that led to the
27 2005-2007 issuances of RMBS. However, “the re-election of directors who have allegedly
28 mismanaged the company is insufficient to meet the ‘essential link’ requirement of Section 14(a).”

For example, the plaintiffs in In re Diamond Foods claimed that a proxy statement

5 contained misstatements about the adequacy of internal controls. 2012 WL 1945814, at *7. The
6 court, after noting that the proxy statement did not call for a vote on any specific transaction,
7 rejected plaintiffs’ argument that “the proxy [was] actionable . . . because ‘it contained false
8 financial information that influenced the vote to re-elect the directors who were up for election.’”
9 Id. The court held that a “claim that the reelection of the directors was an essential link to loss10 generating corporate action because of the directors’ subsequent mismanagement” cannot form the
11 basis of liability under Section 14(a). Id. (quoting Kelley v. Rambus, Inc. 2008 WL 5170598 at *8
12 n.8).
13

Here, the fundamental causation defect in Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim is even starker

14 because the losses allegedly arose out of activities (RMBS issuances) that occurred many years
15 before the proxies and elections alleged in the Complaint. Neither the JPMorgan stockholders’
16 election of directors nor their vote whether to establish an independent Chairman could have been
17 “the direct cause of pecuniary injury for which recovery is sought” arising out of prior RMBS
18 transactions. Gen. Elec. Co., 980 F.2d at 933; see also In re HP, 2012 WL 4468423, at *10; In re
19 VeriSign, 531 F. Supp. at 1213 (holding plaintiffs failed to allege “direct injury” suffered by
20 corporation). Courts consistently hold, and logic dictates, that when the underlying conduct that
21 allegedly caused the company’s monetary loss (here, the RMBS-related activities in 2005-2007)
22 took place before the proxy statements were issued (in 2011 and 2012), subsequent corporate
23 actions being voted upon in those filings cannot have caused the claimed harm. In re HP, 2012
24 WL 4468423, at *11 (dismissing Section 14(a) claim premised on vote on stock incentive plan
25 because plaintiffs failed to allege that plan resulted in the earlier corporate waste that supposedly

2 preexisting’ injury, cannot form the basis for § 14 liability” (ellipses and citations omitted)).
3 Similarly, in Mercury Interactive, the alleged economic loss suffered by the company in
4 connection with a settlement entered into with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
5 after the proxy statements were issued was not caused by the proxy statements because the
6 settlement related to conduct that occurred prior to the proxy statements. See SEC v. Mercury

Proxy statements issued in 2011 and 2012 could not have caused JPMorgan’s alleged

10 losses from conduct that occurred from 2005 to 2007. Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim should be
11 dismissed for this reason alone. As discussed below, however, other grounds compel the same
12 result.
13
14

2.

The Complaint Does Not Allege Material Misrepresentations

Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim also is deficient because to the extent Plaintiffs attempt to

15 allege misstatements and omissions in the 2011 and 2012 proxy statements, Plaintiffs are seeking
16 to criticize the Defendants for failure to disclose their alleged mismanagement. Such statements
17 are not material as a matter of law. Section 14(a) does not create a cause of action for claims
18 premised on “alleged mismanagement or breach of fiduciary duty.” Desaigoudar v. Meyercord,
19 223 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 2000); see also In re Teledyne Def. Contract. Deriv. Litig., 849 F.
20 Supp. 1369, 1380-81 (C.D. Cal. 1993). Section 14(a) does not require disclosure of
21 “mismanagement, unadorned by self-dealing,” because such conduct is plainly “not material or
22 otherwise within the ambit of the federal securities laws” and mandating its disclosure “would
23 represent a move toward the federalization of corporate law that the Supreme Court has repeatedly
24 and emphatically rejected.” Gaines v. Haughton, 645 F.2d 761, 779 (9th Cir. 1981), overruled in
25 part on other grounds, In re McLinn, 739 F.2d 1395, 1397 (9th Cir. 1984); In re Diamond Foods,
26 2012 WL 1945814, at *7 (no Section 14(a) liability for claims of mismanagement); Schwartzman

1 compensation policies or code of ethics” was contrary to Gaines and amounted to “little more than
2 an attempt to present a breach of fiduciary duty claim as a Section 14(a) claim”). Plaintiffs’ claim,
3 which focuses on an alleged failure to disclose supposedly inadequate Board oversight and
4 internal controls (see, e.g., ¶¶ 197, 204, 205, 306, 307), is a classic example of alleged
5
5 mismanagement not subject to Section 14(a) liability.

Furthermore, general statements about the nature and quality of a company’s management

6

7 are held not to be actionable. That is true even when the statements made are far more positive
8 than the portions of the proxy statements copied into the Complaint here. For example, in ECA,
9 Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust v. JP Morgan Chase Co., 553 F.3d 187, 206 (2d Cir. 2009),
10 the court concluded that statements regarding a company’s “highly disciplined” risk management
11 and “standard-setting reputation for integrity” “are no more than ‘puffery’ which does not give rise
12 to securities violations.” Such “statements are too general to cause a reasonable investor to rely
13 upon them” and do not, “and could not, amount to a guarantee that its choices would prevent
6
14 failures in its risk management practices.” Id.

While the Supreme Court recognized a private derivative cause of action under Section 14(a) in
J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426 (1964), that holding is inconsistent with the Court’s
subsequent jurisprudence regarding implied causes of action and is likely to be overruled.
Subsequent decisions from the Court have disavowed the reasoning of Borak and substantially
narrowed the grounds for implying statutory private rights of action. See Stoneridge Inv. Partners,
LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, 552 U.S. 148, 164 (2008) (holding, contrary to the prior rule from
Borak, “it is [now] settled that there is an implied cause of action only if the underlying statute can
be interpreted to disclose the intent to create one”); Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S.
560, 577-78 (1979) (declining to “question the actual holding of” Borak, but rejecting its
reasoning and concluding that “[t]o the extent our analysis in today’s decision differs from that of
the Court in Borak, it suffices to say that in a series of cases since Borak we have adhered to a
stricter standard for the implication of private causes of action, and we follow that stricter standard
today”); Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 735-36 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting) (calling
Borak “incomprehensible as a matter of public policy,” unsupported by precedent, and “a singular
and, I believe, aberrant interpretation of a federal regulatory statute” because the decision
overlooks “Congress’ express creation of an administrative mechanism for enforcing that

objection to the viability of this claim.

The Complaint Does Not Plead the Section 14(a) Claim with the
Particularity Required by the PSLRA

The Section 14(a) claim should also be dismissed because it fails to meet the pleading
requirements of the PSLRA. The Complaint fails to identify with particularity any specific
statements that were supposedly misleading or why they were misleading, but instead simply
reproduces large portions of JPMorgan’s 2011 and 2012 proxy statements, including language
relating to the Board’s leadership structure, the independence of Board members, Board policies
regarding oversight of risk management, and the Board’s reasons for recommending against a
shareholder proposal to require a separation of the Chairman and CEO positions. ¶¶ 194-96, 20105, 236, 261, 264. The Complaint italicizes certain words in the disclosures, but does not allege
that the inclusion of those words or the omission of additional information “violated established
SEC regulations or any rules implicit in the regulations that specifically govern proxy statements
issued in connection with board elections.” In re Morgan Stanley Deriv. Litig., 542 F. Supp. 2d
317, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (dismissing derivative claim based on Rule 14a); see also Fisher v.
Kanas, 467 F. Supp. 2d 275, 281-82 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (dismissing § 14(a) claim based on proxy
statements’ characterization of compensation policies where the complaint failed to “allege that
the proxies contained any specific misrepresentation of compensation”).
Nor does the Complaint “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that
the defendant[s] acted with the required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2)(A). A Section
14(a) claim requires at least a showing of negligence, In re McKesson HBOC, 126 F. Supp. 2d at

did not act with due care with respect to the proxy statements, much less particularized facts that

As discussed in Point I above, personal jurisdiction does not exist as to any of the

The Section 14(a) Claim Cannot Provide a Basis for Personal Jurisdiction

4 Defendants with respect to the Delaware state law fiduciary duty claims that are the gravamen of
5 this action. Plaintiffs did not cure that defect by their addition of a claim under Section 14(a) of
6 the Exchange Act against 10 of the 13 Defendants. As to the Defendants sued on the Section
7 14(a) claim, Plaintiffs might attempt to rely upon the nationwide service of process provision in
8 Section 27 of the Exchange Act to assert personal jurisdiction, including over the Delaware state
9 law claims. See 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a); Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp. v. Vigman, 764 F.2d 1309, 1314, 131510 16 (9th Cir. 1985). Because the federal claim must be dismissed, however, it cannot “provide a
11 basis for asserting pendent personal jurisdiction over [Defendants] for the state law claims. There
12 is no remaining claim ‘in the same suit’ to which jurisdiction can be pendent.” Malone v. Clark
13 Nuber, P.S., 2008 WL 4279502, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 12, 2008), aff’d, 445 Fed. App’x 940
14 (9th Cir. 2011); Hall v. Nelson Aircraft Sales, Inc., 2006 WL 624907, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 9,
15 2006) (where claims giving rise to personal jurisdiction “fail as a matter of law, the remaining
16 claims may then be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.”); Anderson v. McGrath, 2012 WL
17 5381406, at *7 (D. Ariz. Nov. 1, 2012) (“Because the Court has dismissed the federal claims
18 against the Director Defendants, it will decline to exercise pendent personal jurisdiction over the
19 state law claims asserted against them.”) (citing cases).
20

Even if the Section 14 claim were not dismissed, pendent personal jurisdiction over the

21 state law claims would not exist because the state law claims and the Section 14(a) claim do not
22 arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts. See Action Embroidery Corp. v. Atl.
23 Embroidery, Inc., 368 F.3d 1174, 1181 (9th Cir. 2004). The Section 14(a) claim alleges false or
24 misleading proxy statements in 2011 and 2012 in soliciting shareholders to vote on the election of
25 directors and on shareholder proposals related to the election of a Lead Director and the separation
26 of the roles of Chairman and CEO. ¶¶ 191-212. These voting decisions in 2011 and 2012, and the
27 statements made in the proxy statements relating to Board oversight and structure, are not related
28 to the primary allegations in the Complaint, which all relate to JPMorgan’s allegedly improper

1 origination and sale of subprime RMBS to investors in 2005 to 2007. See, e.g., ¶ 40.
The only alleged nexus or “common nucleus” between the facts underlying the federal and

2

3 state claims is that Plaintiffs claim that the proxy statements, solicited 4 to 7 years after the
4 underlying RMBS transactions, “were false and misleading because they stated and implied that
5 the Board, with Dimon as both Chairman and CEO, was exercising effective oversight of
6 management, when in fact the directors knew that was not the case and that management had in
7 fact intentionally overridden and violated the Company’s own risk management rules, the
8 Company’s underwriting standards, and other key internal controls, as alleged in more detail
9 herein and in the Statement of Facts.” ¶ 197; see also ¶ 206. The proxy statement does not
10 address oversight or controls as to RMBS, and Plaintiffs’ vague assertions as to what the proxy
11 “implied” as to general oversight cannot bridge seven years in time and link a vote on the election
12 of directors in 2011 or 2012 to an alleged lack of controls as to RMBS transactions that occurred
13 years earlier. See, e.g., Witt Co. v. RISO, Inc., 948 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1251 (D. Or. 2013)
14 (rejecting pendent personal jurisdiction where both breach of contract and antitrust claims were
15 alleged, because “the relevant facts for analyzing the breach of contract and duty of good faith and
16 fair dealing claims are distinct enough that they do not arise ‘out of a common nucleus of
17 operative facts’ with the antitrust claim”); see also N.C. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. McKinley Fin. Serv.,
18 Inc., 386 F. Supp. 2d 648, 656-57 (M.D.N.C. 2005) (refusing to retain unrelated claims based
7
19 upon pendent personal jurisdiction).

Even when the requirements of pendent personal jurisdiction have been met (and here they

20

21 have not), the decision to assert jurisdiction “is left to the Court’s discretion and relies on
22 ‘considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants.’” Allen v. Similasan
23 Corp., 2013 WL 2120825, at *3 (S.D. Cal. May 14, 2013) (quoting Action Embroidery, 368 F.3d
24 at 1181). These considerations weigh heavily against the exercise of pendent personal jurisdiction
25

7

In addition, as shown in Point II.A above, the Section 14(a) claim is so immaterial and
insubstantial that it cannot be a basis for pendent personal jurisdiction over the state law claims or
26 the Section 14(a) claim itself as a matter of law. See Malone, 2008 WL 4279502, at *1-2; see also
San Mateo Cty. Transit Dist. v. Dearman, Fitzgerald & Roberts, Inc., 979 F.2d 1356, 1357-58 (9th

1 here. First, it would result in piecemeal litigation because pendent personal jurisdiction would not
2 extend to the three Defendants (Messrs. Harrison, Lipp, and Flynn) who are not sued under
3 Section 14(a). ¶ 305. See Action Embroidery Corp., 368 F.3d at 1180 (“Personal jurisdiction
4 must exist for each claim asserted against a defendant.”). Second, there is no reason for the Court
5 to exercise its discretion to keep this case in this forum and there are strong countervailing reasons
6 not to do so: The forum is far from JPMorgan’s principal place of business, there is no basis for
7 personal jurisdiction over any Defendants other than the Exchange Act’s nationwide service of
8 process provision (and not even that as to three of the Defendants), and there currently is an
9 overlapping case proceeding without jurisdictional or venue obstacles in the district where
10 JPMorgan has its principal place of business. That readily available forum is the proper one for a
11 derivative suit. See Point V. While the doctrine of pendent personal jurisdiction, when properly
12 deployed, may enhance judicial efficiency and fairness, it would have the opposite effect here.

VENUE IS IMPROPER IN THIS DISTRICT WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE
LAW CLAIMS
Venue over the state law claims is also lacking in this District. “Plaintiff has the burden of

15
proving that venue is proper in the district in which the suit was initiated.” Hope v. Otis Elevator
16
Co., 389 F. Supp. 2d 1235, 1243 (E.D. Cal. 2005); Piedmont Label Co. v. Sun Garden Packing
17
Co., 589 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1979). Because venue over the state law claims is improper, this
18
Court should dismiss them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3) or transfer this action to the SDNY pursuant
19
to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).
20
First, “[w]hen there are multiple parties and/or multiple claims in an action, the plaintiff
21
must establish that venue is proper as to each defendant and as to each claim.” Multimin USA,
22

1 law claims occurred in California, much less a “substantial part of the events or omissions.” See
2 Bockman v. First Am. Mktg. Corp., 459 F. App’x 157, 161 (3d Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original)
3 (events giving rise to derivative action against corporation’s directors for breach of fiduciary duty
4 were defendants’ acts or omissions as directors); In re First Solar, Inc. Deriv. Litig., 2013 WL
5 817132, at *10-11 (D. Del. Mar. 4, 2013) (in shareholder derivative action, venue was not proper
6 in state of incorporation, but instead in state where company was headquartered and director
7 defendants carried out majority of their duties). “[T]he ‘events or omissions’ inquiry focuses on
8 the defendant’s relevant activities—not the plaintiff’s.” Gamboa v. USA Cycling, Inc., 2013 WL
9 1700951, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2013) (quoting LeRoy v. Great W. United Corp., 443 U.S. 173,
10 183-84 (1979) (“The purpose of statutorily specified venue is to protect the defendant against the
11 risk that a plaintiff will select an unfair or inconvenient place of trial.”)). The Company’s broader
12 business activities in California therefore are not relevant to this inquiry, as it is merely a nominal
13 defendant and is properly aligned as a plaintiff for this purpose. Nor does the criminal
14 investigation in this District by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California
15 confer any basis for venue as to the Defendants. ¶ 18. Investigative activities of the United States
16 Attorney’s Office as to the Company are not a basis for venue against the Defendants. See
17 Sarandi v. Breu, 2009 WL 2871049, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2009) (investigation by U.S.
18 Attorney for Northern District of California into corporation’s alleged unlawful conduct in U.S.
19 did not provide a reason to retain derivative suit in that district, since focus of derivative claims
20 was directors’ conduct in Switzerland in failing to prevent that conduct).
21

Third, the Court should not assert “pendent venue” over the state law claims by virtue of

22 the statutory venue over the Section 14(a) claim – a legal theory that “has received limited
23 acceptance” and has never been approved by the Ninth Circuit. Gamboa, 2013 WL 1700951,
24 at *4. Even when accepted it is applied only “‘where venue exists for the principal cause of

1 cause of action asserted in the Complaint is breach of fiduciary duty, not the tacked-on Section
2 14(a) claim. Furthermore, for the reasons discussed above (see Points I and II.A), pendent venue
3 is not applicable because the Section 14(a) claim is not colorable, and the state law and Section

THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR FAILURE TO ALLEGE
THAT DEMAND ON THE BOARD IS EXCUSED
If the substantial jurisdictional and venue issues set forth above could be overcome, that

10
would still leave the core defect of the Complaint: Plaintiffs’ failure to make pre-suit demand
11
before commencing this action or to allege adequately that demand is excused. This precise issue
12
has been litigated in two previous RMBS-related derivative cases over the past two years, with
13
dismissal ordered in both cases. Those rulings serve as collateral estoppel in this case. And even
14
absent estoppel, this Court should follow the unanimous precedent of those two RMBS cases and
15
eight other decisions that have held that demand against the JPMorgan Board is not excused.
16
A.

17

Collateral Estoppel Precludes Plaintiffs from Relitigating Demand Futility
with Respect to the State Law Claims

The Complaint is the third attempt by JPMorgan shareholders to plead that pre-suit

18

19 demand would be futile based on allegations that the directors of JPMorgan face a substantial
20 likelihood of liability arising out of the Company’s RMBS-related activities. The first two
21 attempts were rejected in Siegal v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., 2012 WL 8161652 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.
22 Aug. 16, 2012), aff’d, 960 N.Y.S.2d 104 (App. Div. 2013), appeal denied, 990 N.E.2d 135 (N.Y.

Under the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1738, New

2 York law determines whether that state court’s prior adjudication has collateral estoppel effect.
3 See Sanchez v. Crown Equip. Corp., 141 F.3d 1178, 1998 WL 84152, at *1 (9th Cir. 1998)

It is well settled under New York law that collateral estoppel blocks repetitive, overlapping

8 derivative lawsuits that seek to circumvent the demand requirement. See, e.g., Carroll ex rel.

12 by different shareholder plaintiffs); Henik ex rel. LaBranche & Co. v. LaBranche, 433 F. Supp. 2d
13 372, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“[I]f this were not the rule, shareholder plaintiffs could indefinitely
14 relitigate the demand futility question in an unlimited number of state and federal courts, a result
15 the preclusion doctrine specifically is aimed at avoiding.”); see also Levin ex rel. Tyco Int’l Ltd. v.

21 differing factual allegations from the earlier dismissed complaints – based on the same underlying
22 conduct – cannot save their action from dismissal. “‘[E]ven if there are variations in the facts,’”

1 to be disinterested and independent. See n.1, supra. Two of those 10 outside directors are not
2 named as defendants, and their independence is not even challenged. As for the other eight
3 directors, the Complaint offers only generic and conclusory allegations repeatedly rejected by
4 New York and Delaware courts.
5

Director Fees. The assertion that demand is excused because the Directors receive

6 compensation for their service (¶¶ 242, 265, 270, 274, 276) is plainly insufficient. Allegations that
7 “directors are paid for their services as directors . . , without more, do not establish any financial
8 interest” to excuse demand. Grobow v. Perot, 539 A.2d 180, 188 (Del. 1988), overruled on other
9 grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (Del. 2000). Instead, a complaint must allege with
10 particularity that the alleged benefit received by the director is “material” and is significant enough
11 “in the context of the director’s economic circumstances, as to have made it improbable that the
12 director could perform her fiduciary duties to the . . . shareholders without being influenced by her
13 overriding personal interest.” Orman v. Cullman, 794 A.2d 5, 23 (Del. Ch. 2002) (emphasis in
11
14 original). The Complaint offers no such allegations.

15

Director Stock Compensation. Plaintiffs also claim that the Director Defendants lack

16 independence because they were improperly motivated to increase the Company’s profitability.
17 ¶¶ 222-23. But efforts to increase the overall profitability and price of JPMorgan’s stock are
18 consistent with the interests of all shareholders and cannot excuse demand. See In re Accuray,
19 Inc. S’holder Deriv. Litig., 757 F. Supp. 2d at 927.
20

Receipt of Loans and Credit. Plaintiffs next assert that certain Director Defendants lack

21 independence because they or companies with which they are associated received unspecified
22 loans, extensions of credit, or financial advisory services from JPMorgan. ¶¶ 243, 244, 266, 271,

1 278. However, as the Delaware Court of Chancery observed in rejecting similar allegations,
2 “JPMC is a national commercial and investment bank. That it provided financing to large
3 American companies should come as no shock to anyone. Yet this is all that the plaintiffs allege.”

6 loans/extensions of credit” excuse demand because conclusory allegations did not provide the
7 necessary “‘particularized facts about the materiality of the relationship[s] in question that would
8 create a reasonable doubt about the independence of the [] directors.’”) (citation omitted). The
9 claim that Defendant Crown is not independent because he has “benefited from charitable

14

Dominance by “Individual Defendants.” The Complaint finally makes the conclusory

15 allegation that the JPMorgan Board is dominated “by the Individual Defendants” (¶ 280), but does
16 not explain which Directors are controlling and which are controlled. Nor does the Complaint
17 allege particularized facts showing that any Director’s decision-making is so dominated by an
18 interested Director that he or she “would be more willing to risk his or her reputation than risk the
19 relationship with the interested director.” Beam, 845 A.2d at 1052; Freedman v. Adams, 2012 WL

The Complaint Does Not Plead with Particularity a Claim for
Breach of the Fiduciary Duty of Care, and Any Such Claim Is
Barred by the Exculpatory Provision in JPMorgan’s Charter

“Even where it is possible to hold directors responsible for a breach of the duty of care,

11 Delaware law requires that directors have acted with gross negligence,” and the definition of gross
12 negligence in Delaware corporate law is “extremely stringent.” In re Lear Corp. S’holder Litig.,
13 967 A.2d 640, 651-52 (Del. Ch. 2008). The definition is so “strict that it imports the concept of
14 recklessness into the gross negligence standard,” requiring a showing of the director’s “‘reckless
15 indifference to or a deliberate disregard of the whole body of stockholders or actions which are
16 without the bounds of reason.’” Id. at 652 n.45 (quoting Tomczak v. Morton Thiokol, Inc., 1990
17 WL 42607, at *12 (Del. Ch. Apr. 5, 1990)). Plaintiff’s Complaint does not come close to meeting
18 this standard.
19

Even if Plaintiffs could do so, JPMorgan’s shareholders have adopted a charter provision

20 that exculpates directors for any breach of the fiduciary duty of care. Delaware law permits
21 shareholders to adopt a charter provision “eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a
22 director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty
23 as a director,” with the sole exceptions of liability for: (i) breach of the director’s “duty of loyalty
24 to the corporation or its stockholders;” (ii) “acts or omissions not in good faith” or that “involve
25 intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;” (iii) unlawful payments of dividends and
26 unlawful stock purchases and redemptions; or (iv) “any transaction from which the director
27 derived an improper personal benefit.” 8 Del. C. § 102(b)(7). In accordance with this section,

1 Corporation Law of the State of Delaware . . . permits the limitation or elimination of the liability
2 of directors, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
3 stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.” Baskin Decl.
4 Ex. E, at 5 (art. 6(1)).
This Section 102(b)(7) exculpatory provision presents a “substantial impediment” to any

5

6 claim of “likely personal liability” and greatly increases Plaintiffs’ already onerous burden. See In
7 re Lear Corp., 967 A.2d at 647, 653. For example, in In re Goldman Sachs Group., Inc.
8 Shareholder Litigation, the court held, in light of the corporation’s exculpatory provision, that in
9 order to plead demand futility “the Plaintiffs must also plead particularized facts that demonstrate
10 that the directors acted with scienter; i.e., there was an ‘intentional dereliction of duty’ or ‘a
11 conscious disregard’ for their responsibilities, amounting to bad faith.” 2011 WL 4826104, at *12
12 (citation omitted); see In re Accuray, Inc. S’holder Deriv. Litig., 757 F. Supp. 2d at 927 (“The
13 exculpatory clause limits directors’ liability to actions that are made in bad faith or constitute
14 intentional misconduct.”); In re Autodesk, Inc. S’holder Deriv. Litig., 2008 WL 5234264, at *9-10
15 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2008) (on motion to dismiss, finding that the standard of bad faith is “scienter12

Under Delaware law, a claim even of gross negligence is “unavailing” in the face of an

attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference, and documents integral to plaintiff’s claims.
Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., 691 F.3d 1152, 1159-60 (9th Cir. 2012). The court may also take

The Complaint does not challenge specific actions of the Director Defendants but instead

2 claims that they failed in their duty of oversight because they did not implement internal controls
3 or enabled the Company’s allegedly wrongful conduct through their failure to supervise. E.g.,
4 ¶¶ 8-12, 40-45, 153-156, 160, 182, 214, 216-18, 228-33, 235, 258-60. Because claims for breach
5 of the duty of care (including gross negligence) are exculpated by JPMorgan’s charter, Plaintiffs’
6 can only excuse demand if they adequately allege a claim for breach of the fiduciary duty of
7 loyalty based on a bad-faith failure to oversee the affairs of the corporation. But this is “the most
8 difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.” In re
9 Caremark Int’l Inc. Deriv. Litig., 698 A.2d 959, 967 (Del. Ch. 1996). To establish such a claim, a
10 plaintiff must show: “(a) the directors utterly failed to implement any reporting or information
11 system or controls; or (b) having implemented such a system or controls, consciously failed to
12 monitor or oversee its operations thus disabling themselves from being informed of risks or
13 problems requiring their attention.” Stone, 911 A.2d at 370. It requires a showing that the
14 directors consciously disregarded their responsibilities, such that they have the “mindset of a
15 disloyal director—bad faith—because their indolence was so persistent that it could not be
16 ascribed to anything other than a knowing decision not to even try to make sure the corporation’s
17 officers had developed and were implementing a prudent approach to ensuring law compliance.”

but instead pleads the contrary: it describes in detail internal control processes and reporting

The Complaint Fails To Allege that the Director
Defendants Consciously Ignored “Red Flags”

bad faith by deliberately ignoring their oversight responsibilities, the plaintiff must plead
“particularized facts suggesting that the board was presented with ‘red flags’ alerting it to potential
misconduct” that they consciously and deliberately ignored. David B. Shaev Profit Sharing
Account v. Armstrong, 2006 WL 391931, at *5 (Del. Ch. Feb. 13, 2006), aff’d, 911 A.2d 802 (Del.
2006); In re Citigroup Inc., 964 A.2d at 128. Once again, general or conclusory allegations are
insufficient. In re Citigroup Inc. S’holders Litig., 2003 WL 21384599, at *2 (Del. Ch. June 5,
2003) (“‘[r]ed flags’ are only useful when they are either waved in one’s face or displayed so that
they are visible to the careful observer”), aff’d, 839 A.2d 666 (Del. 2003); Kanter v. Barella, 388
F. Supp. 2d 474, 480 (D.N.J. 2005) (oversight liability may exist only when directors turn a “blind
eye” to unlawful practices of which “they were aware”), aff’d, 489 F.3d 170 (3d Cir. 2007). As
shown below, Plaintiffs set forth no particularized factual allegations demonstrating that the
Director Defendants learned about and consciously ignored red flags of wrongdoing related to
RMBS.
13

The allegations that the Board later enhanced governance processes (¶¶ 208-10, 237-39, 261,
263-64), does not demonstrate a lack of processes; moreover, it negates a finding that the Board
25 acted in bad faith since it demonstrates “an evident effort to establish a reasonable system of
controls.” South v. Baker, 62 A.3d 1, 18 (Del. Ch. 2012); see also Saginaw Police & Fire Pension

Instead, Plaintiffs attempt to obscure the Complaint’s lack of particularized allegations

2 with lengthy recitations of immaterial detail that have nothing to do with the Director Defendants’
3 actions. The Complaint devotes many pages to descriptions of underwriting mortgages and
4 RMBS in the industry generally (¶¶ 70-114), the JPMorgan subsidiaries involved in those business
5 activities (¶¶ 126-37), and alleged wrongdoing by those subsidiaries (¶¶ 138-39, 159-173, 176-84,
6 186-90). The Complaint describes alleged actions by certain bank employees (¶¶ 141-43, 145,
7 148-50, 152, 182), loan officers (¶¶ 145-46, 148-50), underwriters (¶¶ 145, 147, 150-51, 153),

9 bank “Managing Directors” (¶¶ 5, 228-29, 248, 258), and a third party diligence firm (¶¶ 161-63,
10 165-70). The Complaint relies heavily on the Statement of Facts that accompanied the November
11 2013 settlement, but that document does not include a single reference to the Director Defendants
12 or provide any support for Plaintiffs’ wholly conclusory assertion that reports made to “Executive
13 Directors” or “Managing Directors” described in the Statement of Facts were provided to the
14 Board or any Board committee. See ¶¶ 5, 228-29, 248, 258. See, e.g., South v. Baker, 62 A.3d 1,
15 16 (Del. Ch. 2012) (rejecting use of mining regulator’s report stating that management failed to
16 institute policies to prevent accidents because “it is not reasonable to infer that the Board acted in
17 bad faith based on references to ‘management’”); In re SAIC Inc. Deriv. Litig., 948 F. Supp. 2d
18 366, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (refusing to infer director malfeasance based on admissions in the
19 statement of responsibility accompanying a deferred prosecution agreement concerning company
20 and management misconduct), aff’d, 2014 WL 322055 (2d Cir. Jan. 30, 2014).
21

Plaintiffs offer only the conclusory assertion that “Defendants knowingly authorized or

22 recklessly allowed JPMorgan to engage in substantial wrongdoing in the subprime mortgage
23 market” (¶ 40; see also ¶¶ 8, 16, 42, 44, 45, 47, 144), without any particularized allegations as to
24 what Director Defendants knew, when they learned about the supposed wrongdoing, or how they
25 learned of such wrongdoing. Similarly, allegations that the Director Defendants were motivated to

2 issuance of RMBS alleged in the Complaint.

Instead of pleading with particularity, Plaintiffs seek to rely on improper inferences or

4 conclusions, all of which have been rejected by courts. First, courts do not infer that if
5 wrongdoing occurred at a company the directors must have known of it. As the Supreme Court of
6 Delaware has observed, “directors’ good faith exercise of oversight responsibility may not
7 invariably prevent employees from violating criminal laws, or from causing the corporation to
8 incur significant financial liability, or both.” Stone, 911 A.2d at 373. Accordingly, in Stone, the
9 court affirmed the dismissal of a derivative complaint for failure to plead with particularity that the
10 directors were aware of red flags indicating a systematic failure of their compliance program and
11 policies even after the Company had paid $50 million in fines and penalties and was investigated
12 by three agencies and the U.S. Attorney for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money
13 laundering regulations. Id. at 373-74; see also Harold Grill 2 IRA v. Chenevert, 2013 WL
14 3014120, at *2-3 (Del. Ch. June 24, 2013) (holding that the plaintiff had failed to plead that
15 demand was excused even though the company was fined $55 million and agreed to change its
16 compliance practices after it violated U.S. export regulations and falsified its report to the State
17 Department because the complaint did not adequately plead that the directors knowingly caused
18 the corporation to violate the law). Federal courts in California have adhered to these principles.
19 In In re Oracle Corp. Derivative Litigation, the court explicitly rejected the argument that because
20 “purported overbilling occurred in the context of a large and pervasive ‘scheme’ over an extended
21 time period, and involved an important . . . customer . . . and large sums of money, the outside
22
14
Public statements by Company representatives after the relevant activities took place (¶¶ 119,
23 154, 172, 174) do not show that the Director Defendants knew of them at the time. Nor does the
April 2008 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York citing a deterioration in the quality
24 of the Company’s mortgage portfolio as a result of “‘loosened underwriting standards’” and the
need to “‘strengthen [its] exposure . . . framework.’” ¶ 173. Even if the Board was aware of this
25 April 2008 report (which the Complaint does not allege), it post-dated the alleged misconduct.
Plaintiffs incorrectly attempt to extend the time period for the alleged wrongdoing by
26 mischaracterizing the Statement of Facts agreed to by the Company in connection with its
settlement with the Department of Justice as “outlin[ing] how [JPMorgan] failed to disclose risks
27 of buying RMBS from 2005 to 2008.” ¶ 5. That document in fact expressly refers only to the
period 2005 to 2007. See Compl. Ex. A.

1 directors simply must have known.” 2011 WL 5444262, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 9, 2011).
2 Similarly, in In re Google, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, the court held demand was not
3 excused because plaintiffs’ allegations against the directors were “collective and general” and
4 failed to provide any “particularized allegations stating which particular director or directors had
5 knowledge of unlawful advertising.” 2012 WL 1611064, at *7 (N.D. Cal. May 8, 2012).
Next, Plaintiffs assert that certain Director Defendants knew about the misconduct because

6

7 they were members of Board committees charged with oversight. See ¶¶ 225-41, 252-64, 269,
8 273, 277. Such knowledge cannot be inferred by virtue of committee membership. See South v.
9 Baker, 62 A.3d at 17 (“As numerous Delaware decisions make clear, an allegation that the
10 underlying cause of a corporate trauma falls within the delegated authority of a board committee
11 does not support an inference that the directors on that committee knew of and consciously
12 disregarded the problem for purposes of Rule 23.1”); In re VeriFone Holdings, Inc. S’holder
13 Deriv. Litig., 2009 WL 1458233, at *8 (N.D. Cal. May 26, 2009) (“It is conclusory to state that the
14 directors knew about the internal problems in accounting because they were on the Audit
15 Committee . . . .”); In re CNET Networks, Inc., 483 F. Supp. 2d 947, 963 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (“Mere
16 membership on a committee or board without specific allegations as to defendants’ roles and
17 conduct, is insufficient to support a finding that directors were conflicted.”).
Plaintiffs also suggest that allegations of various types of unrelated misconduct, occurring

18

19 over a 20-year period (¶¶ 47-64), demonstrate that the Board must have known and consciously
15
20 ignored signs of misconduct specifically related to RMBS. Courts have again rejected such

21 efforts to plead demand futility. Thus the court in In re Citigroup concluded that the plaintiffs had
22 “utterly failed to show how Citigroup’s involvement with the financial scandals at Enron has any
23 relevance to Citigroup’s investments in subprime securities,” 964 A.2d at 129, the court in In re
24 Dow Chemical Co. Derivative Litigation held that past instances of misconduct, involving
25

15

Courts have already dismissed derivative complaints against JPMorgan officers and directors
arising out of these unrelated events. See, e.g., Halpert Enters., Inc. v. Harrison, 362 F. Supp. 2d

The Complaint Does Not Allege with Particularity that the
Director Defendants Face a Substantial Likelihood of Liability
for Breach of Fiduciary Duty Based on Alleged
Misrepresentations

The Complaint makes the conclusory allegation that “[e]ach of the Defendants also
breached his or her duty of loyalty and candor by concealing JPMorgan’s involvement in the
illegal RMBS sales through fraudulent and misleading representations and through the
concealment of material facts.” ¶ 285. This allegation is also insufficient to plead demand futility.
First, claims against directors based on alleged misrepresentations are exculpated under
Section 102(b)(7) and are insufficient to excuse demand absent particularized allegations that the
directors had knowledge that the representations were untrue. Malpiede v. Townson, 780 A.2d at
1086 & n.31; In re Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc., 954 A.2d 346, 362-63 (Del. Ch. 2008); In re
Dow Chem. Co. Deriv. Litig., 2010 WL 66769, at *10; In re VeriFone Holdings, Inc., 2009 WL
1458233, at *8 (“Without a showing of scienter, e.g., regarding the willingness of the directors to
issue SEC filings or other public statements that materially misrepresented or hid [the company’s]
alleged internal accounting problems, plaintiffs are hard pressed to establish a ‘substantial
likelihood of liability’ for false SEC filings and other public statements”). The Complaint lacks
any particularized allegations that each of the Director Defendants knew that representations were
false when made.
Second, the Complaint fails to identify any false or misleading representations made by
each of the Director Defendants. Plaintiffs allege that JPMorgan’s 2006 Form 10-K
misrepresented the Company’s underwriting standards for mortgage loans (¶ 122), but do not
identify any particular statement, or where in that document this alleged misrepresentation
supposedly appeared. As discussed in Point II above, Plaintiffs similarly fail to identify

1 misrepresentations in the proxy statements or how they harmed the Company.

Third, the Complaint does not allege particularized facts showing that each of the Director

3 Defendants was involved in the preparation of the challenged disclosures. Although the
4 Complaint alleges that certain Director Defendants signed the 2006 Form 10-K (¶¶ 122), signing
5 financial reports or other SEC filings is not a sufficient basis to assert a substantial likelihood of
6 liability. See Rahbari v. Oros, 732 F. Supp. 2d 367, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). In connection with the
7 challenged disclosures, the Complaint either makes no mention of the Director Defendants or
8 offers only conclusory assertions that the Director Defendants “failed to disclose” (see, e.g., ¶ 10)
9 or “caused” the Company to issue proxy statements in 2011 and 2012 that included alleged false
10 and misleading statements (¶¶ 191, 197, 200, 206, 207). These conclusory allegations cannot
11 excuse demand. See In re HP Deriv. Litig., 2012 WL 4468423, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2012)
12 (finding demand not excused because “[p]laintiffs do not allege that any Director prepared these
13 financial statements or that they were directly responsible for the misstatements”); In re Accuray,
14 Inc. S’holder Deriv. Litig., 757 F. Supp. 2d at 934 (dismissing derivative complaint because
15 “[p]laintiffs do not allege that any member . . . prepared these financial statements”); see also

Plaintiffs’ Remaining State Law Claims Do Not Give Rise to a Substantial

23
fair exchange.” Steiner v. Meyerson, 1995 WL 441999, at *1 (Del. Ch. July 19, 1995); see also In

1 director compensation based on the illegal conduct described herein.” ¶ 297. But this claim is not
2 pled with particularity and cannot overcome that “high hurdle” the Delaware law imposes for
3 challenging compensation awards. See Brehm, 746 A.2d at 263. A “proper challenge to a
4 compensation package requires a showing of bad faith or ‘an exchange of corporate assets for
5 consideration so disproportionately small as to lie beyond the range at which any reasonable
6 person might be willing to trade.’” In re Bidz.com, Inc. Deriv. Litig., 773 F. Supp. 2d 844, 854
7 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (citation omitted). No such facts are pleaded here.
8

The claim for unjust enrichment (Count III) is also insufficient because the only benefit

9 identified by Plaintiffs is that the Director Defendants received compensation. ¶ 300. Absent
10 allegations of fact indicating a causal relationship between the “benefit” and the challenged
11 conduct, the Complaint does not allege a substantial likelihood of liability on this claim. Taylor v.

IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THIS ACTION SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §§ 1404(a)
AND 1406(a)

15

In the alternative, this action should be transferred to the United States District Court for

16 the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), on the grounds
17 that transfer will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice.
18 Adoma v. Univ. of Phoenix, Inc., 711 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1151 (E.D. Cal. 2010). Transfer is
19 particularly warranted here, given that JPMorgan’s principal place of business is in New York
20 City, relevant witnesses are based in New York, and another shareholder derivative action raising
21 the same factual and legal issues is pending in the SDNY.
22

In deciding motions under Section 1404(a), courts take into account both public and

23 private interest factors. See Decker Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 843
24 (9th Cir. 1986). The public factors include relative docket congestion, any local interest in having
25 the controversy decided at home, and avoiding unnecessary problems with conflicts of laws or the
26 application of unfamiliar law. Id. (citing Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 241, 241 n.6

The public factors weigh heavily in favor of transfer. First, this District has no greater

Public Factors Favor Transfer to the SDNY

6 interest in this case than any other forum in the United States where the Company conducts
7 business activities, and it has much less interest than the SDNY, where JPMorgan is
8 headquartered. See, e.g., Duffer v. United Cont’l Holdings, Inc., 2013 WL 2147802, at *5 (S.D.
9 Cal. May 16, 2013) (“[T]he Northern District of Illinois has a stronger interest in trying this case
10 locally than does this district, as the Airline Defendants are headquartered there.”). The only
11 asserted connection to this District is that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for this District is conducting
12 a criminal investigation related to the Company’s RMBS activities, but that investigation does not
13 provide a sufficient connection between Plaintiffs’ derivative claims and this District to warrant
14 denial of a transfer. See Sarandi v. Breu, 2009 WL 2871049, at *7.
15

The interests of justice, and in particular judicial economy and the avoidance of duplicative

16 litigation and inconsistent judgments, favor transfer to the SDNY. Personal jurisdiction and venue
17 unquestionably exist in that court as to the claims asserted in this action, avoiding piecemeal or
18 duplicative litigation of the claims in multiple forums. In Henson v. Fidelity National Financial,
19 Inc., for example, the court transferred a case to the Central District of California because venue
20 did not exist as to one of plaintiff’s claims and thus the concomitant transfer of the co-plaintiff’s
21 claims would “prevent this lawsuit from being split and tried separately in different districts,”
22 “preserv[e] [judicial resources] by having one judge decide this case, rather than two,” and lessen
23 “the likelihood of different rulings, disparate outcomes, and the possibility of appeals and re24 litigation.” 2014 WL 641978, at *12 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 18, 2014). Similarly, in Shari’s Berries, the
25 action was transferred to a court where there was venue over all of plaintiff’s claims based on the
26 “desirability of trying all of [Plaintiff’s] claims in a single forum and the fact that the vast majority
27 of events giving rise to this action occurred” in the transferee district. 2006 WL 2382263, at *4

These considerations apply with special force to this case because a shareholder derivative

1

2 action filed on behalf of JPMorgan in the SDNY alleging virtually the same claims as alleged here
3 already is pending in the SDNY. Steinberg v. Dimon, No. 14-cv-688 (S.D.N.Y.). Transfer of this
4 action to the SDNY would lead to consolidation or coordination of these related cases and would
5 reduce burden, expense, and potential prejudice of duplicative litigation and inconsistent
6 judgments. See Cont’l Grain Co. v. FBL-585, 364 U.S. 19, 26 (1960) (“To permit a situation in
7 which two cases involving precisely the same issues are simultaneously pending in different
8 District Courts leads to the wastefulness of time, energy and money that § 1404(a) was designed to
9 prevent.”); Hawkins v. Gerber Prods. Co., 924 F. Supp. 2d 1208, 1214 (S.D. Cal. 2013) (action
10 transferred to a court where similar cases were pending so as to “serve the interest of justice due to
11 the possible consolidation of discovery and the conservation of time, energy and money, and the
12 avoidance of the possibility of inconsistent judgments”).
Lastly, the relative docket congestion in this District and the SDNY heavily weighs in

13

14 favor of transfer. See Brown v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co., 2014 WL 715082, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb.
15 14, 2014). “‘To measure congestion, courts compare the two fora’s median time from filing to
16 disposition or trial.’” Id. (quoting Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, 2011 WL 996343, at *8 (N.D.
17 Cal. Mar. 17, 2011)). The Federal Court Management Statistics for U.S. district courts as of
18 December 31, 2013 show a median time for civil cases from filing to disposition and to trial in the
19 SDNY of 8.2 and 32.4 months, respectively, while in this Court the median time for civil cases
20 from filing to disposition and to trial is 9.2 and 51.2 months, respectively. See Federal Court

22 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/FederalCourtManagementStatistics/district-courts-december16

7 consideration is often given to a plaintiff’s choice of forum, in this case that choice is entitled to
8 little or no weight. The real plaintiff here is JPMorgan, headquartered in New York. As to the
9 nominal plaintiffs, one is a citizen of New Jersey, while the other two claim to be citizens of
10 California but do not allege that they are residents of this District. Cf. Ader v. Belimed, Inc., 2012
11 WL 3234206, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2012) (“the quality of plaintiff’s contacts with California,
12 and particularly this judicial district, are not of a quality deserving controlling weight.”); see also
13 Fabus Corp. v. Asiana Express Corp., 2001 WL 253185, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2001) (“The
14 degree to which courts defer to the plaintiff’s chosen venue is substantially reduced where the
15 plaintiff’s venue choice is not its residence or where the forum chosen lacks a significant
16 connection to the activities alleged in the complaint.”). Moreover, where “an individual brings a
17 derivative suit . . . the named plaintiff’s choice of forum is given less weight.” Lou v. Belzberg,
18 834 F.2d 730, 739 (9th Cir. 1987). As the Supreme Court explained, “where there are hundreds of
19 potential plaintiffs, all equally entitled voluntarily to invest themselves with the corporation’s
20 cause of action and all of whom could with equal right go into their many home courts, the claim
21 of any one plaintiff that a forum is appropriate merely because it is his home forum is considerably
22 weakened.” Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947).
23

The convenience of the parties and witnesses strongly favors transfer. See Brown, 2014

24 WL 715082, at *4. The shareholder plaintiffs are merely acting in a derivative capacity on behalf
25 of nominal defendant JPMorgan, and thus are not real parties in interest or potential witnesses.
26 JPMorgan, on whose purported behalf this action has been brought, has its principal place of
27 business in New York (¶ 23), and it is vastly more efficient and cost-effective for the Company for
28 the case to be litigated there. Not one of the Defendants is a citizen of California, while two are

2 All of the current directors regularly travel to New York for meetings of the Board of Directors.
3 Horan Decl. ¶ 7. These facts weigh heavily in favor of transfer, as the Defendants would likely be
4 the primary witnesses. See Sarandi v. Breu, 2009 WL 2871049, at *7 (“[T]he most important
5 witnesses are the Defendants, since it is their conduct which is at issue in this case. . . . Novartis’
6 directors are being accused of breaching their fiduciary duties to the Company. . . . [T]he
7 resolution of Plaintiff’s claims ultimately will turn on the knowledge and conduct of the
8 Defendants.”); Johns v. Panera Bread Co., 2008 WL 2811827, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 21, 2008)
9 (“[T]he four witnesses who reside in Missouri will be better served through litigation in Missouri.
10 In addition, those living in the other states will also be better served by transfer, as their home
11 states are significantly closer to Missouri than to California.”).
12

Courts have consistently transferred actions asserting claims against a corporation to the

13 district of the corporation’s principal place of business, as that is almost always the most
14 convenient forum for the parties and witnesses – reasoning that is even more compelling when the
15 claims are purportedly brought on behalf of the corporation. See, e.g., Davis v. Social Serv.
16 Coordinators, Inc., 2013 WL 4483067, at *9 (“SSC’s corporate headquarters are in the Southern
17 District of Florida, its employment and policy decisions were formulated at its headquarters, and a
18 majority of the opt-in plaintiffs worked for SSC at its Miami Lakes facility in the Southern District
17
19 of Florida.”). As the Southern District of California recently explained in transferring a case to a

20 district where the defendant corporation was based:

See also Leroy-Garcia v. Brave Arts Licensing, 2013 WL 4013869, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 5,

principal places of business in or around Los Angeles. In such a situation, the court believes that
23 it is more convenient for the parties, on the whole, to litigate this action in the Central District of

[T]his case should be transferred to the Northern District of Illinois. While the
Airline Defendants did not provide a specific list of witnesses they intend to call
at trial, the Court finds many of the witnesses whose testimony would be relevant
to this case are located in the Northern District of Illinois, which is beyond this
Court’s subpoena power. Conversely, the Court finds none of the witnesses
whose testimony would be relevant are located in this district. . . . Similarly, the
Court finds that much of the documentary evidence in this case is located in the
Northern District of Illinois, while none of the documentary evidence is located in
this district. While technology aids in the sharing of documentary evidence, this
factor nonetheless tips in favor of transfer.

In addition, key non-party witnesses, such as members of management who reported to the

8

9 Board regarding the parts of JPMorgan’s business at issue in the Complaint, will primarily be
10 based in or near JPMorgan’s New York headquarters, favoring transfer. Horan Decl. ¶ 4. See
11 Italian Colors Rest. v. Am. Express, 2003 WL 22682482, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2003) (holding
12 that the fact that most of the witnesses would be employees of the defendant corporation favored
13 transfer); Brown, 2014 WL 715082, at *5 (likely location of non-party witnesses, including
14 current and former defendant company employees, weighed in favor of transfer); Foster v.
15 Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 2007 WL 4410408, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 14, 2007) (“[M]ost of
16 defendant’s management-level employees who oversee the special investigators or work in human
19
17 resources are based in Ohio” at the company’s headquarters).

More generally, because this case alleges wrongdoing by JPMorgan’s directors and

18

19 officers that caused injury to JPMorgan, the “center of gravity” of this action is in New York. “In
20 light of the location of the relevant documents and key witnesses, among other things, it readily
21 appears that” the state of the defendant company’s headquarters “is the center of gravity of this
22
23
24

18

The ease of access to sources of proof, such as relevant documentary evidence, is a factor to be
considered, and weighs in favor of transfer to the SDNY, where JPMorgan is based. See, e.g.,
Italian Colors Rest. v. Am. Express, 2003 WL 22682482, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2003)
(“Litigation costs weigh heavily in favor of transfer to the Southern District of New York, with
regard to both documentary and testamentary evidence. Documents pertaining to defendants’
business practices are most likely to be found at their principal place of business.”); Johns, 2008
WL 2811827, at *4 (“Neither party disputes the fact that most, if not all, of the evidence is located
at Panera’s Missouri headquarters.”).

19
Further, the JPMorgan entities alleged in the Complaint (¶¶ 125-33) to have been involved in the
27 activities alleged in the Complaint are based generally in New York, with none in California.

1 case and would be a more convenient forum.” Ader, 2012 WL 3234206, at *10. See also Johns,
2 2008 WL 2811827, at *5 (“[B]ecause all of Panera’s key witnesses and documents are located in
3 or near Missouri, the center of gravity would plainly appear to be the Eastern District of
4 Missouri.”); Hoefer v. United States Dep’t of Commerce, 2000 WL 890862, at *3 (N.D. Cal.
5 June 28, 2000) (“Litigation should proceed where the case finds its ‘center of gravity.’ Because
6 all of the defendants’ key witnesses and documents are located in or near Washington, DC, that
20
7 ‘center of gravity’ would appear plainly to be the nation’s capital.”) (internal citation omitted).

8 Because the “center of gravity” for this case is in New York, this action should be transferred to
9 the SDNY.

CONCLUSION

11

For all of the foregoing reasons, Nominal Defendant JPMorgan and the Defendants

12 respectfully request that the Court grant their motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety for
13 failure to plead demand futility and improper venue, and Defendants respectfully request that the
14 Court grant their motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and to dismiss the Section
15 14(a) claim for failure to state a claim. In the alternative, Nominal Defendant JPMorgan and
16 Defendants respectfully request that the Court transfer this action to the SDNY pursuant to 28
17 U.S.C. § 1404(a).

state where Plaintiff purports to have purchased a falsely advertised product, but in New Jersey,
the state where Gerber is headquartered and allegedly issued misrepresentations concerning its
probiotic products. The primary focus of this action is the development and marketing of certain
Gerber consumer goods, and decisions about how such goods were to be advertised to
consumers.”); Vernon v. Qwest Commc’ns Int’l, 643 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1272 (W.D. Wash. 2009)

the broadband product group, which develops and manages Qwest’s high-speed internet service, is
located in Denver, Colorado. The majority of persons involved in developing Qwest’s ETF reside
in Colorado. . . . Policy decisions regarding consumer sales, communications with customers,

advertising and marketing departments are located in Colorado . . . .”). See Horan Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.
