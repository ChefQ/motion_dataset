No. 17-363C
Judge Campbell-Smith

THE UNITED STATES’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS, OR IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, FOR AN ENLARGEMENT OF TIME
The United States respectfully moves the Court to stay this action pending a decision by
the Federal Circuit in Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Company v. United States, No.
17-1224 (Fed. Cir.). Plaintiffs Raymond G. Farmer, in his capacity as Liquidator of Consumers’
Choice Health Insurance Company, and Michael J. FitzGibbons, in his capacity as Special
Deputy Liquidator of Consumers’ Choice Health Insurance Company, (the “Liquidators”)
oppose this request.
In the alternative, pursuant to Rule 6(b), the United States requests a 60-day enlargement
of time, up to and including July 17, 2017, in which to respond to the Complaint. The United
States’ response is currently due May 18, 2017. The United States has not previously requested
an enlargement of time. Counsel for the Liquidators has stated that they consent to a 30-day
extension, but not the requested 60-day extension.
I.

Background
On March 17, 2017, the Liquidators filed this action seeking approximately $92 million

in money damages under Section 1342 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

(“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. § 18062, and 45 C.F.R. § 153.510(b), and for breach of contract and
Takings. Docket No. 1. The United States’ response to the Complaint is currently due on May
18, 2017.
This is the latest of 23 cases filed over the past year in this Court seeking relief under
identical and related legal theories to those asserted by the Liquidators. See Health Republic Ins.
Co. v. United States, No. 16-259C (Sweeney, J.);1 First Priority Life Ins. Co. v. United States,
No. 16-587C (Wolski, J.); Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina v. United States, No.

Health Republic – the first case – was filed on February 24, 2016.

These cases involve several technically-detailed provisions of the ACA and raise
significant jurisdictional issues as well as complex issues of appropriations law.

The

undersigned counsel represents the United States in each of these cases, which implicate a total
of $8.3 billion in the 2014 and 2015 benefit years.
On November 10, 2016, this Court entered the first decision in these cases in Land of
Lincoln, in favor of the United States, and on November 15, 2016, Land of Lincoln filed a notice
of appeal from that judgment. Briefing is expected to be complete by May 22, 2017.
Two other cases have reached the merits. In Moda Health Plan, the court granted partial
summary judgment on liability for the plaintiff and subsequently entered final judgment, Moda
Health Plan, Inc. v. United States, 130 Fed. Cl. 436 (2017) (Wheeler, J.), and on May 4, 2017,
the United States filed a notice of appeal from that judgment. In Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
North Carolina, the court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the government’s
implementation of the program is reasonable and consistent with the ACA. Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of North Carolina v. United States, -- Fed Cl. --, 2017 WL 1382976 (April 18, 2017)
(Griggsby, J.).
Dispositive motions have been fully briefed and are pending a decision in four other
cases: First Priority, Health Republic, Montana Health, and Maine Community Health Options.
Health Republic has been certified as a class action and cross-motions for summary judgment are
pending. In addition, a stay has already been entered in nine other cases: New Mexico Health
Connections, Minuteman Health, BCBSM, Alliant Health Plans, Blue Cross of Idaho Health
Service, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina, Neighborhood Health Plan, Medica
Health Plans, and Sanford Health Plan.

II.

A Stay Is Proper and Will Conserve Substantial Resources
“It is well established that every trial court has the power to stay its proceedings, which is

‘incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its
docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.’” Freeman v.
United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 530, 532 (2008) (citing Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254
(1936)). “Moreover, when and how to stay proceedings is within the sound discretion of the trial
court.” Id. (citation and internal punctuation omitted). The Supreme Court has highlighted the
conservation of judicial resources as an important reason for a trial court to stay proceedings in
any matter pending before it, particularly where the appellate court may resolve issues before the
trial court. Landis, 299 U.S. at 254-55; UnionBanCal Corp. & Subsidiaries v. United States, 93
Fed. Cl. 166, 167 (2010) (“The orderly course of justice and judicial economy is served when
granting a stay simplifies the ‘issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected to
result from a stay.’”) (quoting CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 (9th Cir. 1962)). Indeed,
the Supreme Court also recognized that in cases of great complexity and significance, like the
risk corridors issues in this case, “the individual may be required to submit to delay not
immoderate in extent and not oppressive in its consequences if the public welfare or convenience
will thereby be promoted,” especially where, as here, a decision by the Federal Circuit would
“settle” and “simplify” the issues presented. Landis, 299 U.S. at 256.
Because the legal issues presented in this case mirror the issues raised in Land of Lincoln,
and other earlier-filed cases, the further development of those cases on appeal will be instructive
and potentially dispositive. A stay therefore will conserve judicial resources and the resources of

4

both parties by potentially reducing the amount of briefing of issues already pending before the
Federal Circuit.
Accordingly, the United States seeks a time-limited, carefully-monitored stay pending
further developments in the appeal in Land of Lincoln. Within 30 days of the disposition of the
appeal in Land of Lincoln, the United States proposes that the parties submit a status report with
the Court outlining next steps. Alternatively, the parties can submit status reports every 45 days
(or at another appropriate interval acceptable to the Court) after entry of an order granting the
stay in order to closely monitor its continued utility.
III.

Conclusion
For these reasons, the United States respectfully requests that the Court stay this case

pending further development in the appeal of Land of Lincoln.
In the alternative, the United States requests an extension of 60 days, up to and including
July 17, 2017, to respond the Complaint. The Liquidators have consented to an extension of 30
days, until June 19, 2017.
