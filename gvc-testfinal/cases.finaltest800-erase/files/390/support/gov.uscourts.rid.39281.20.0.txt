Case 1:15-cv-00388-S-LDA Document 20 Filed 05/16/16 Page 7 of 21 PagelD #: 316

Plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company ("Philadelphia"), by and through its
attorneys, Sedgwick LLP and Morrison Mahoney LLP, respectfully submits this brief in support
of its motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

This case involves an insurance coverage dispute arising under a Directors and Officer's
("D&O") liability policy issued by Philadelphia to Providence Community Action Program
("ProCAP"). D&O policies are a form of "third-party liability insurance," and are meant to
provide liability insurance against claims for damages brought against an insured corporation, or
its directors or officers, by litigants who are clearly distinct from the covered insureds.! For
obvious reasons of collusion and moral hazard, a D&O insurer does not issue such coverage to
defend or indemnify one insured (e.g., a corporate officer) against allegations of misconduct
brought by a related insured (e.g., the insured corporation itself), Accordingly, D&O policies,
including the Philadelphia Policy at issue, explicitly exclude coverage for claims "by, at the behest,
or on behalf of" the insured corporation against its own officers and directors.

In this case, the corporate insured, ProCAP, became insolvent and was placed into
receivership. In an attempt to squeeze all of the potential proceeds out of ProCAP's assets,
ProCAP's Receiver, defendant Thomas S. Hemmendinger ("the Receiver" or "Hemmendinger"),

has endeavored to trigger D&O coverage under ProCAP's Policy by suing two ProCAP executives

 

' As one treatise has explained:
"First-party" insurance is a contract between the insurer and the insured to protect
the insured from its own actual losses and expenses. Property insurance, fidelity
insurance, and medical/health insurance are all examples of first-party insurance.
"Third-party" insurance is a contract to protect the insured from losses resulting
from actual or potential liability to a third party. This protection may involve
defending the insured from suit, paying or settling a claim against the insured, or a
combination of both. Liability insurance is third-party insurance.

Case 1:15-cv-00388-S-LDA Document 20 Filed 05/16/16 Page 8 of 21 PagelD #: 317

(defendants Frank Corbishley ("Corbishley") and William Bentley ("Bentley")) for alleged
violations of their fiduciary duties to ProCAP, and then seeking a settlement from Philadelphia.
Although the Receiver's claims are wholly derived from (and no different than) ProCAP's rights
of recovery against its former officers Corbishley and Bentley, in this action the Receiver and
Corbishley ("Defendants"') contend that, because the Receiver elected to bring suit under his own
name rather than ProCAP's, this nominal distinction avoids triggering the policy exclusion
intended to exclude coverage for such causes of action - the insured vs. insured exclusion. This
exclusion applies, and Defendants' position is untenable, for three reasons.

e First, the Policy was amended - at ProCAP's request and after Hemmendinger
assumed control of ProCAP - to provide that Hemmendinger would be
"perform[ing] services for" ProCAP in his role as Receiver, so that
Hemmendinger would receiver D&O coverage under the Policy. Accordingly,
the plain language of the Policy itself establishes that Hemmendinger was
acting "on behalf of' ProCAP in his role as Receiver.

0x00B0 Second, Rhode Island law' is clear that the Receiver steps into the shoes of
ProCAP, and may not bring any claim or exercise any right that ProCAP could
not have brought in the first instance. Because a suit brought in ProCAP's name
bringing identical claims against Corbishley and Bentley would clearly not
trigger coverage under the Policy, the merely nominal substitution of the

Receiver's name for ProCAP cannot create coverage where none existed before.

 

* As explained below, Bentley has not appeared and has defaulted in this case. Philadelphia's basis
for a judgment against Bentley, however, is identical to its case against the remaining Defendants.
* Unless otherwise indicated, Philadelphia asserts that Rhode Island law provides the relevant
substantive law in this diversity case.

0x00B0 Third, the Receiver's claims against Corbishley and Bentley make clear that the
Receiver is asserting ProCAP's liability claim against them for breach of their
fiduciary duties to ProCAP. In doing so, the Receiver effectively makes a
judicial admission that his claims are brought "by, at the behest, or on behalf
of" ProCAP.

Accordingly, Philadelphia respectfully requests that the Court issue a declaratory judgment
finding that Philadelphia does not owe a defense or indemnity under the Policy for the claims
brought against ProCAP's former officers by ProCAP's present Receiver, whether in his own
name or in ProCAP's.

Il. RELEVANT BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background

Philadelphia relies on all of the facts described in, and exhibits attached to, the Parties'
Agreed Statement of Facts ("ASF") (Docket No. 18), and the pleadings on file with the Court, as
well as the Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, filed herewith, and the Declaration of Lisa
Cassidy (Exhibit A). Philadelphia includes the following condensed narrative of pertinent facts.

Philadelphia is an insurance company that is organized under the laws of Pennsylvania,
with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. (ASF 2.) At all relevant times, ProCAP was
a private, not-for-profit corporation with its principal place of business in Providence, Rhode
Island. (ASF 1.) Philadelphia issued to ProCAP "Flexiplus Five" Insurance Policy No.
PHSD619786 ("the Policy") for the policy period from June 6, 2011 to June 8, 2012. (ASF 4.)
The Policy provides coverage on a claims-made basis, as limited by the Policy's terms and
conditions, for directors and officers liability. (ASF 4.)

On December 14, 2011, ProCAP's Board of Directors initiated a receivership proceeding
in the Providence County Superior Court, which promptly appointed defendant Hemmendinger to

mead

Case 1:15-cv-00388-S-LDA Document 20 Filed 05/16/16 Page 10 of 21 PagelD #: 319

act as ProCAP's temporary receiver. (ASF 6.) Hemmendinger has alleged that ProCAP was
forced into insolvency by the misconduct of Corbishley and Bentley. (ASF 14; Ex. I at 96-7.)
On January 4, 2012, the Providence County Superior Court appointed Hemmendinger as
ProCAP's permanent receiver. (ASF 10.) Hemmendinger's appointment as ProCAP's receiver
vests him "with the title to all assets, property, choses in action, and any rights of [ProCAP]" and
entitles him to bring "suits in [ProCAP's] name or in the Receiver's name ... and generally do any
other act which might be done by [ProCAP] or that may in the judgment of the Receiver be
necessary or desirable for the protection, maintenance and preservation of the property and assets
of [ProCAP]." (ASF 10, Ex. E at 993-4.)

On December 22, 2011, ProCAP's insurance broker (Troy, Pires & Allen, LLP) requested
that Philadelphia amend the Policy to ensure that it covers Hemmendinger. (ASF 7; Declaration
of Lisa Cassidy 0x00A7{{ 4-7.) Philadelphia promptly complied by issuing an endorsement that added
Hemmendinger (by name) to the Policy's definition of "Individual Insured" and described
Hemmendinger as an "independent contractor" who would "perform services for [ProCAP]."
(ASF 7, Ex. C.) ProCAP's insurance broker then sent a letter to ProCAP confirming that
Hemmoendinger had been added to the Policy and attaching a copy of the relevant endorsement.
(ASF 8, Ex. D.)

On February 22, 2012, counsel for Hemmendinger notified Philadelphia that
Hemmendinger, in his capacity as receiver of ProCAP, might assert claims against defendant
Corbishley who was, at all relevant times, the executive director of ProCAP. (ASF 11.) On March
24, 2012, Philadelphia sent a reservation of rights letter to Hemmendinger which reserved
Philadelphia's right to limit coverage in whole or in part and relied, among other provisions, upon

the Policy's Exclusion J. (ASF 12.) On June 6, 2012, Hemmendinger's counsel sent Philadelphia

a demand for payment of $1 million as the result of alleged misconduct by Corbishley and Bentley,
