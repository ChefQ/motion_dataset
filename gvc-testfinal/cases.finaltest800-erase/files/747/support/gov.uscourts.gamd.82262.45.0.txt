CASE NO.: 4:11-CV-38 (CDL)

AMENDMENT TO CLAIMANT’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
NEW TRIAL
COMES NOW the Claimant, Terrance Durr, and files this his Amendment to his
Memorandum in Support of Motion For New Trial (Doc. 44). As grounds for said amendment,
undersigned counsel would state as follows:
1.

Durr filed a motion for new trial and memorandum in support of said motion on

July 24, 2012. ( Doc. 43 & 44).
2.

On page two (2) of the memorandum, undersigned stated the applicable standard

of review is as follows:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a)(2) states as follows:
Further Action After a Nonjury Trial. After a nonjury trial, the court may, on
motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional
testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and
direct the entry of a new judgment.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 (a)(2)
A motion for new trial should be granted when “the verdict is against the clear
weight of the of the evidence or will result in a miscarriage of justice, even though there may be
substantial evidence which would prevent the direction of a verdict.” See Lipphardt v. Durango
Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., 267 F.3d 1183,1186 (11th Cir. 2001). (quoting Hewitt v. B.F.
Goodrich Co., 732 F.2d 1554, 1556 (11th Cir.1984)).
3.

Undersigned feels that he has an ethical obligation and duty to correct the

previously stated standard of review. Upon further research and review, undersigned asserts the
standard of review should be as follows:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a)(2) states as follows:
Further Action After a Nonjury Trial. After a nonjury trial, the court may, on
motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional
testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and
direct the entry of a new judgment.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 (a)(2)

A new trial should be granted when the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.
See, e.g. Hewitt v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 732 F.2d 1554, 1556 (11th Cir. 1984). In a nonjury case, a
motion for new trial should be based upon a “manifest error of law or mistake of fact” and
should only be granted for “substantial reasons.” See Ball v. Interoceanica Corp., 71 F.3d 73, 76
(2d Cir. 1995), cert denied, 519 U.S. 863, 117 S.Ct. 169, 136 L.Ed.2d 111 (1996) (quoting 11
CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & FRANK W. ELLIOTT, FEDERAL
PRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 2804 (2d ed. 1995)).
Respectfully submitted this the 25th day of July, 2012.
