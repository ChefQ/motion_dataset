PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO CLAIMANT’S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
COMES NOW, Plaintiff, the United States of America, by and through its
attorney, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, hereby
opposes the motion for new trial filed by Terrance Durr, through his counsel, Dustin
Fowler, Esq., and requests that this Court deny Claimant’s motion pursuant to FED.
R. CIV. P. 59.
INTRODUCTION
On June 26, 2012, this Court held a bench trial regarding the forfeiture of the
Defendant Property, to wit: $21,175.00 in United States funds. On June 29, 2012, the
Court entered a verdict forfeiting the Defendant Property to the United States of
America. The Order held that the United States currency constituted proceeds
traceable to an exchange for a controlled substance in violation of the Controlled

Case 4:11-cv-00038-CDL Document 46

Filed 08/14/12 Page 2 of 6

Substances Act. The evidence produced at trial was determined by the Court to be
sufficient to forfeit the currency and Claimant failed to prove a legitimate source for
the currency.
In his motion for a new trial, the Claimant does nothing more than argue that
the Court erred in deciding that the weight of the evidence favored forfeiture, and
that the Government’s evidence at trial was insufficient. Claimant has failed to offer
any new facts or evidence, nor provide any argument that the Court made any
findings or conclusions that were based on any error of the law or of the facts.
ANALYSIS OF LAW
A.

Applicable Standard of Review for a New Trial.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a)(2) states that “the court may, on motion
for a new trial, open the judgment… take additional testimony, amend findings of
fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new
judgment” after a judgment has been entered in a nonjury trial. FED.R.CIV.P.
59(a)(2). Claimant initially contended that the applicable standard of review for a
motion for new trial under Rule 59 was premised on whether “the verdict is against
the clear weight of the evidence or will result in a miscarriage of justice.” Lipphardt v.
Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., 267 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir. 2001). However, as
Claimant subsequently acknowledged, this standard of review is only applicable for
motions for new trial after a jury trial.

A motion for new trial following a nonjury case, should only be granted for
“substantial reasons” based upon “manifest error of law or mistake of fact.” Ball v.
Interoceanica Corp., 71 F.3d 73, 76 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting 11 Charles A. Wright,
Arthur R. Miller, & Frank W. Elliot, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2804 (2d ed. 1995)).
See also Tampa Port Authority v. M/V Duchess, 64 F. Supp. 2d 1303 (M.D. Fla. 1998);
Baucom v. Sisco Stevedoring, Case No. 06-0785-WE-B, 2008 WL 2428930 * 3 (S.D. Ala.
June 12, 2008). Neither Claimant’s initial filing, nor his amended memorandum
comes close to satisfying the requirements needed for Rule 59 relief following a
bench trial. Instead, Claimant simply disagrees with the Court’s findings and seeks
a different conclusion. These concerns do not constitute “substantial reasons” for
the court to open its judgment, reconsider evidence, and direct the entry of a new
judgment. The Claimant has not made any contentions that would be considered
distinct or separate from the issues already tried to demand a new trial. “A trial
court should not grant a new trial merely because the losing party could probably
present a better case on another trial.” Hannover Ins. Co. v. Dolly Trans Freight, Inc.,
Case No. 05-CV-576-Orl-19DAB, 2007 WL 170788 *2 (M.D.Fla. January 18, 2007.)
B.

Claimant fails to state and apply appropriate burden of proof.

The burden of proof in a forfeiture action requires that the United States
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant property is subject
to forfeiture. United States v. $183,791 in U.S. Currency, 391 F. Appx. 791, 794 (11th
Cir. 2010). The Eleventh Circuit has previously held that the United States “need

only show that the money was related to some illegal drug transaction.” Id.
(emphasis added). Further, to determine whether the United States has met this
burden, the Court looks to the “totality of the circumstances.” Id.
Then, after the government has met its burden of proof, the claimant may
seek to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Defendant Property
was not used to violate the Controlled Substances Act. United States v. Carrell, 252
F.3d 1193, 1201 (11th Cir. 2001). This may be done either by rebutting the United
States’ evidence that the property was utilized in a drug transaction or by claiming
the innocent owner defense, which requires a claimant to demonstrate that he or she
has no knowledge of the illegal activities and have not consented to any illegal
activities in connection with the property. Id. at 1201-03.
In its June 29, 2012 Order, this Court concluded that the totality of the
circumstances demonstrated that there was a substantial relationship between the
Defendant Property and the illegal drug activity. In fact, this Court listed several
factors that led the court to this conclusion in favor of the plaintiff. In his motion,
the Claimant provides an unnecessary re-examination of each of these factors.
Claimant was provided opportunity to provide evidence and he argued his
innocent owner defense. This Court concluded that Claimant failed to meet his
burden of proof and entered an order forfeiting the Defendant Property to the
United States. Thus, the Government will decline to address further these factors as
the Court has already made its determination.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Claimant has not shown any substantial reason
which a new trial should be granted. The Government respectfully requests that the
Claimant’s Motion for New Trial be denied.
