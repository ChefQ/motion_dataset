SHEILA SCHULZ,
Plaintiff,
vs.

Case No. 09-C-298

GREEN COUNTY, WISCONSIN,
Defendant.
_________________________________________________________________________
D EFEN D AN T S BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF ITS
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
_________________________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION
Every Wisconsin cou nty is requ ired to p rovid e ju venile intake services
u nd er Ch. 48 and 938 of the Wisconsin Statu tes. Cou nties can elect to p rovid e
su ch services either throu gh its circu it cou rt or its social/ hu m an services agency.
This case arises from a d ecision by the Green Cou nty Board of Su p ervisors at the
end of 2008 to restructure its juvenile intake function and to transfer those services
from the circu it cou rt (court-attached) to the Dep artm ent of H u m an Services
(agency-attached). Green Cou nty s reorganization decision was driven by a desire
to save the Cou nty m oney and to ensu re that the ju venile intake agency had
su fficient p ersonnel to allow the Cou nty to ad equ ately p rovid e the requ ired
juvenile intake services.

The reorganization affected Plaintiff Sheila Schu lz, w ho had been the
Director of Ju venile Intake for Green Cou nty. As a resu lt of the Cou nty s decision
to restru ctu re the d ep artm ent, her p osition, as w ell as another p art-tim e ju venile
intake p osition in the circu it cou rt, w ere elim inated . The reorganization resu lted
in d uties being transferred to the H u m an Services Department and a new position
being created in that department to provide juvenile intake services.
Plaintiff m aintains that by virtu e of her status as a ju venile intake w orker,
she had a p rop erty interest in her em p loym ent and that she had certain
pre-termination due p rocess rights u nd er the Fou rteenth Am end m ent to the U.S.
Constitu tion. H er claim of a p rop erty interest is p red icated on Wis. Stat. § 17.10,
which provides that, generally sp eaking, intake w orkers p rovid ing services u nd er
chs. 48 and 938 can only be rem oved for

cause.

Plaintiff alleges that the

Cou nty s reorganization d ep rived her of her p rop erty w ithou t ad equ ate d u e
process of law.
Presently before the Cou rt is w hether the

reorganization excep tion

negated the need for any p re-d ep rivation d u e p rocess. Defend ant Green Cou nty
m aintains that the d ecision to reorganize the ju venile intake function and to
transfer those functions to human services satisfies the reorganization excep tion,
w hich recognizes that a m u nicip al em p loyer is p erm itted to elim inate p ositions
and term inate em p loyees, even those w ho have a p rop erty interest in their
em p loym ent w ithou t d u e p rocess of law , as long as the action is related to a bone
fide reorganization and serves a legitimate governmental purpose.

Plaintiff acknow led ges the existence of the reorganization excep tion, but
has m aintained that the Cou nty s reorganization w as som ehow not legitim ate. As
fu lly set forth in this brief and the related p rop osed find ings of fact, the Cou nty s
d ecision to transfer the ju venile intake services w as financially m otivated and
resu lted in significant savings to the Cou nty. It red u ced the overall compensation
p aid to ju venile intake w orkers; it elim inated the need for a p art-tim e em p loyee
devoted exclusively to juvenile intake; and it eliminated the need for an additional
on-call p erson. The relocation of the ju venile intake fu nction also ensu red that the
agency had su fficient p ersonnel to p rovid e the requ ired services.

Unlike the

court-attached agency w hich had only one fu ll-tim e em p loyee, a vacant p art-time
position, and had to rely u p on contracted services from another nearby county,
the Green Cou nty H uman Services Dep artm ent had ad equ ate staff trained in
ju venile intake w ho w ere available to perform the ju venile intake fu nctions when
required.
In ad d ition to its d efense based on the

reorganization excep tion,

Defendant also m aintains that there w as no constitutional deprivation in that
Plaintiff w as never

removed

from office, bu t rather continu ed p rovid ing

ju venile intake services, albeit in a d ifferent d ep artm ent after the reorganization.
As she w as not technically rem oved from office, she d id not su ffer a constitu tional
deprivation that mandated any pre-deprivation due process.

PLAINTIFF CAN N OT ESTABLISH A D UE PROCESS VIOLATION
UN D ER THE FOURTEEN TH AMEN D MEN T TO THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION.
A.

Plaintiff w as not entitled to any d u e p rocess based on the
reorganization excep tion.

The Fou rteenth Am end m ent Du e Process Clau se p rovid es that [n]o state
shall ... d ep rive any p erson of life, liberty, or p rop erty, w ithou t d u e p rocess of
law .

U.S. Const. A mend. 14 § 1. Plaintiff s contend s that Green Cou nty deprived

her of a property interest (her p osition as a cou rt-attached ju venile intake w orker)
without ad equ ate p re-deprivation d u e p rocess of law in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. (Complaint, ¶¶ 34, 37).
There is no d isp u te that the Cou nty had the right to transfer its ju venile
intake services from the circu it cou rt to the H u m an Services Dep artm ent. Ind eed ,
Wisconsin statutes permit counties to provide the required juvenile intake services
either u nd er the su p ervision of the circu it cou rt or throu gh a cou nty d ep artm ent
providing social and/or human services. Wis. Stats. §§ 48.06(2) and 938.06(2). The
majority of other Wisconsin counties have its juvenile intake function attached to a
human services agency, as opposed to court-attached. (PFOF ¶ 50).
For p u rp oses of this m otion, Defend ant conced es that Schulz had a
p rop erty interest in her em p loym ent w ith the County. Wisconsin law p rovid es
that intake w orkers p rovid ing services u nd er Chs. 48 and 938 can only be
rem oved for cau se.

W is. Stat. § 17.10(6)(b)(1). Defend ant also recognizes that as

a general ru le, an em p loyee w ho has a p rop erty interest in his or her em p loym ent

5

can only be terminated after being afford ed certain pre-deprivation d u e p rocess.
Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1491-92,
84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).
Wisconsin courts, however, have recognized that a legitimate governmental
reorganization serves as a d efense to a d u e p rocess claim .

Und er the

reorganization excep tion, a m u nicip al em p loyer m ay term inate an em p loyee
w ith a p rop erty interest in his/her em p loym ent w ithou t d u e p rocess if the
termination is the result of a legitimate governmental reorganization. Misek v. City
of Chicago, 783 F.2d 98, 100 (7th Cir. 1986); see also Felde v. Town of Brookfield, 570 F.
Su p p . 2d 1070 (E.D. Wis. 2008); Castelaz v. City of M ilwaukee, 94 Wis. 2d 513, 521,
289 N .W.2d 259 (1980) (civil service law s d o not p revent a city or state from
term inating an em p loyee

if there are no fu nd s available or if the p osition is

abolished in good faith or otherw ise becom es u nnecessary ); State ex rel. Thein v.
City of M ilwaukee, 229 Wis. 12, 281 N .W. 653, 656 (1938) (hold ing that civil service
law s are not intend ed to p revent good faith reorganizations w ith a view to
securing greater efficiency); Dane County v. McCartney, 166 Wis. 2d 956, 963-64, 480
N .W.2d 830 (Ct. Ap p . 1992) (find ing that elim ination of a p osition p u rsu ant to a
reorganization d oes not entitle em p loyee to d u e p rocess).

Where the

reorganization excep tion ap p lies, it circu m scribes the em p loyee s su bstantive
p rop erty right. Campana v. City of Greenfield, 164 F. Su p p . 1078, 1092 (E.D. Wis.
2001).

The reorganization excep tion ap p lies to situ ations in w hich a restru ctu ring
or other cost-cu tting m easu re is im p lem ented and w here em p loyee p erform ance
is not an issu e. See, e.g., M isek, 783 F.2d at 100-101; Duffy v. Sarault, 892 F.2d 139,
147 (1st Cir. 1989); Hartman v. City of Providence, 636 F. Su p p . 1395, 1410 (D.R.I.
1986); Franks v. M agnolia Hosp., 999 F. Su p p 1310 (N .D. Miss. 1995). The logic is
clear. If a governm ental em p loyer is looking to reorganize a d ep artm ent or to
transfer functions for the sake of greater efficiency or cost-savings, a p reterm ination hearing w ou ld be su p erflu ou s. It w ou ld be su p erflu ou s becau se the
d ecision is not p red icated on any m iscond u ct or other performance-related
concerns that the p laintiff cou ld refu te in a p re-deprivation hearing. See, e.g.,
Digiacinto v. Harford County, M d., 818 F. Su p p . 903, 906 (D. Md . 1993); Christian v.
Cecil County, 817 F. Supp. 1279, 1284 (D. Md. 1993).
To requ ire a p re-term ination hearing in the context of a governm ental
reorganization w ou ld contravene the p u rp ose of a p re-term ination hearing,
which is to serve as a d eterm ination of w hether there are reasonable grou nd s to
believe that the charges against the em p loyee are tru e and su p p ort the p rop osed
action. M ontgomery v. City of A rdmore, 365 F.3d 926, 935 (10th Cir. 2004). The
p resent situ ation d oes not w arrant any p re-d ep rivation d u e p rocess, as it w as not
related to Plaintiff s performance, but rather aimed at providing greater efficiency
and to save County revenues.
The case perhap s m ost analogou s to the present situ ation is the Cou rt of
Ap p eals d ecision in McCartney, supra.

Cou nty as the d irector of social services. In that case, Dane Cou nty reorganized
its social services d ep artm ent and the com m u nity su p p ort and health services
d ep artm ent into the hu m an services d ep artm ent.

As a resu lt of the

reorganization, the d irector of social services p osition w as abolished and the
p laintiff lost his job. H e su bsequ ently ap p lied for and accep ted a p osition in the
hu m an services d ep artm ent. The cou rt noted that McCartney had a p rop erty
interest in his em p loym ent p u rsu ant to Wis. Stat. § 46.23(3)(d ). McCartney, 166
Wis. 2d at 967-68. N evertheless, becau se there w as no d isp u te that the cou nty
elim inated his p osition and transferred the d u ties of that p osition to another
d ep artm ent p u rsu ant to the reorganization, the reorganization excep tion ap p lied .
As a resu lt, the cou rt held that McCartney had no d u e p rocess right to a hearing
and could not maintain a due process claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. at 968.
The d istrict cou rt s d ecision in Felde v. Town of Brookfield, 570 F. Su p p . 2d
1070 (E.D. Wis. 2008), w here the tow n elim inated a p art-tim e fire chief p osition
and created a fu ll-tim e fire chief p osition, is also instru ctive. There, the chief had
a p rop erty interest in his job by virtu e of Wis. Stat. § 62.13. N evertheless, the
court similarly held that a for-cau se em p loyee w ho lost his p osition p u rsu ant to a
legitim ate governm ental reorganization is not entitled to any d u e p rocess
p rotections. Id. at 1074-75 (citing Thein, 229 Wis. 2d at 18). Becau se the p art-time
p osition w as abolished and a fu ll-tim e p osition w as created , the cou rt held that
no reasonable fact-find er cou ld find that the form er chief d id not lose his job as
p art of the reorganization.

form erly held .
B.

Id. at 1075.

The reorganization by Green County was legitimate.

As noted above, this excep tion only ap p lies w here the governm ental
reorganization is legitim ate.

Nelms v. Modisett, 153 F.3d 815, 821 (7th Cir. 1998);

Garrett v. Barnes, 961 F.2d 629, 634 (7th Cir. 1992). A m u nicipality cannot cry
reorganization
p rotections.

in ord er to circu m vent . . . constitu tional and statu tory

Misek, 783 F.2d at 101. Generally, an em p loyee can attack the

legitim acy of a reorganization by show ing that the reorganization d id not
actu ally occu r or that it w as d one in bad faith. Thein, 229 Wis. at 12 ( Civil
service law s are not to be evad ed by a sham abolition of an old p osition for the
p u rp ose of ou sting an incu m bent. ).
In the present case there is absolutely no evidence that the County is crying
reorganization in an effort to circu m vent constitu tional p rotections. There is
likewise no evid ence that the reorganization w as im p lem ented in bad faith or
that it w as intend ed to ou st Plaintiff from her p osition.

Ind eed , the exact

opposite is tru e. The d ecision w as d riven by a d esire to save the Cou nty m oney
and w as d one as p art of the 2009 bu d get p rocess. The Cou nty d id not seek to get
rid of Plaintiff. While the Cou nty w as requ ired contractu ally to p ost the new
union position, the County encou raged Plaintiff to ap p ly for the new position
and d id not interview anyone else for the new ly created p osition. (PFOF ¶¶ 54-

58). She w as hired to fill that new p osition in H u m an Services and rem ains
employed by the County in that capacity to the present day. (PFOF ¶¶ 59-60).
Plaintiff w ill likely argu e that her p osition w as not actu ally elim inated ,
as the Cou nty is statu torily requ ired to have a p osition p rovid ing ju venile intake
services. In som e circu m stances, evid ence as to w hether a p osition w as actu ally
elim inated can be strong evid ence of an illegitim ate reorganization. For instance,
w here a governm ental em p loyer claim s that it elim inated a p osition in ord er to
ju stify the rem oval of an em p loyee, evid ence that the p osition w as not actu ally
elim inated , bu t filled by another new em p loyee, w ou ld be strong evid ence that
the reorganization w as not legitim ate. H ow ever, w here an entire governmental
fu nction is transferred from one d ep artm ent to another for the sake of efficiency
and cost-savings, the fact that the d u ties continu ed to be p erform ed in the new
department is not evidence of illegitimacy.
Und er Wisconsin law , w hen a reorganization is carried ou t by a legislative
bod y, the cou rts m ay not inqu ire into the m otives of the legislators. Misek, 783
F.2d at 100-01; Felde, 570 F. Su p p . 2d at 1075; State ex. rel. M iller v. Baxter, 171 Wis.
193, 193, 176 N.W. 770 (1920). In Miller, the Wisconsin Su p rem e Cou rt held that a
cou rt cou ld not inqu ire into the m otives of a city cou ncil in abolishing the
p laintiffs jobs d esp ite evid ence and a find ing by the trial cou rt that the cou ncil

a legislative act, a reorganization is a sham only if it d id not actu ally occu r. Felde,
570 F. Su p p . 2d at 1975; Campana, 164 F. Su p p . 2d at 1094. As noted by the cou rt
in Campana, becau se I cannot consid er w hether the Cou ncil acted in bad faith
and becau se the Cou ncil elim inated the p osition entirely, rather than rep lacing
Cam p ana w ith a d ifferent em p loyee, the excep tion ap p lies.

Id. at 1095; see also

Felde, 570 F. Supp. 2d at 1074-75.
In the p resent case, there is no qu estion that the reorganization carried ou t
by the Cou nty Board of Su p ervisors w as a legislative act. Therefore, in assessing
w hether it w as legitim ate, the m otives of the Cou nty Board are im m aterial, and
this Cou rt m u st sim p ly d eterm ine w hether the reorganization actu ally occu rred .
Campana, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 1094.
The u nd isp u ted evid ence show s that the reorganization occu rred .
Positions in the circu it cou rt were elim inated and a new p osition in H u m an
Services w as created . (PFOF ¶¶ 49-55). Prior to the reorganization, the Cou nty
w as p rovid ing ju venile intake services throu gh a cou rt-attached agency that w as
staffed w ith one fu ll-tim e em ployee, a vacant part-tim e em p loyee, or other

11

Page 12 of 16

tem p orary or contracted em p loyees w ho filled in on an as-need ed basis. (PFOF
¶¶ 16-19). After the reorganization, all of the fu nctions were assu m ed and
p erform ed by em p loyees in the H u m an Services Departm ent. (PFOF ¶¶ 49, 59).
The fu nction of the chief ju venile intake w orker w as assu m ed by the Dee Jaye
Miles, the Supervisor of the CYF Unit of the Human Services Department. (PFOF
¶ 51).

When looking objectively at the reorganization, there is not cred ible

argument that it was a sham or did not actually occur.
Even if the motivation behind the reorganization is considered, the record
establishes that it w as legitimate.

The transfer of ju venile intake services to

hu m an services resu lted in better efficiency and significant costs savings to the
County. First, the Cou nty w as requ ired to p rovid e 24 hou r/ 7 d ay-per-week
coverage for ju venile intake services. (PFOF ¶ 25). Prior to the reorganization,
the Cou nty p aid an on-call ju venile intake w orker ap p roxim ately $10,000 p er
year. (PFOF ¶ 27). After the reorganization, as there w as alread y an on-call
employee available 24/7 in the CYF Unit of the Human Services Department, and
becau se that ind ivid u al cou ld also cover on-call services for ju venile intake, the
reorganization resu lted in one less on-call p erson being requ ired w ithin the
County at any given tim e. (PFOF ¶ 27, 53). This m eant that an on-call p erson
d ed icated exclu sively to ju venile intake w as no longer requ ired , thereby saving
the County approximately $10,000 per year. (PFOF ¶ 64).
Fu rtherm ore, becau se of the lack of d ep th w ithin the court-attached
juvenile intake agency, Schulz accrued significant overtime in 2007 and 2008. The

12

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Page 13 of 16

am ou nt of overtim e accru ed by Schu lz in 2009 has been significantly red u ced .
Plaintiff, for instance had over $10,000 in overtim e in 2007 and ap p roxim ately
$7,500 in overtim e in 2008. (PFOF ¶¶ 23-24). Yet, in 2009, her overtim e has
dropped to just slightly over $1,000. (PFOF ¶ 65).
Projections m ad e by Rhond a H u nter, the Cou nty s Director of Finance, in
the fall of 2008 w ere that the reorganization w ou ld save the Cou nty
approximately $75,000 per year. (PFOF ¶¶ 41-42). As it turned out, by the middle
of 2009, w hen these approximate savings w ere actually realized, the Cou nty
board allocated the ju venile intake bu d get and transferred ap p roxim ately $65,000
of the bu d get to hu m an services to cover the cost of the ju venile intake fu nction
and the rem aining balance of approximately $75,000 back into the Cou nty s
general fu nd . (PFOF ¶ 61-63). This $75,000 transfer represented an estim ate of
the actual cost-savings of the reorganization.
The reorganization also resu lted in the elim ination of the p art-time
p osition, w hich w as p reviou sly p art of the cou rt-attached bu d get. (PFOF ¶ 52).
After the reorganization, back-u p w hich had p reviou sly been p erform ed by the
part-tim e and contracted w orkers cou ld be assu m ed by one of the other
em p loyees in H u m an Services w ho w ere trained to p rovid e ju venile intake
services. This allow ed the cou nty to p rovid e better staff coverage for ju venile
intake.

Und er the p reviou s arrangem ent, the Cou nty had to rely u p on a

contracted em p loyee throu gh a d ifferent cou nty for back-u p or a p art-time
em p loyee w hen that p osition w as filled .

Und er the new arrangem ent, the

Page 14 of 16

Cou nty had a stable of trained social w orkers in hu m an services w ho cou ld assist
in providing the required services.
In conclu sion, becau se the reorganization actu ally occu rred and the record
d em onstrates that the reorganization w as legitim ate and fiscally m otivated , the
reorganization was legitimate and no pre-deprivation due process was required.
C.

Plaintiff w as not d enied to any d u e p rocess in that she w as never
rem oved from the job.
In the alternative, Defend ant m aintains that Plaintiff w as never rem oved

from her position, as she continu ed to p erform ju venile intake services for the
Cou nty w ithou t a gap in service. Becau se she w as not technically rem oved from
office, no due process was required.
Green Cou nty Board elim inated Plaintiff s job as chief ju venile intake
officer and transferred those d u ties to the H u m an Services Departm ent. A new
ju venile intake p osition w as created in H u m an Services to p erform the sam e
functions that Plaintiff had p reviou sly p erform ed . (PFOF ¶ 49). Plaintiff ap p lied
for and w as hired to fill that p osition, w hich she started on Janu ary 1, 2009, the
same day that her position in the circuit court was eliminated. (PFOF ¶¶ 57-60). In
that Plaintiff w as never rem oved from her p osition as a ju venile intake w orker,
and she continu ed w orking for the County p rovid ing ju venile intake services
w ithou t a gap in service, Plaintiff w as not entitled to any pre-deprivation due
process.

State law , w hich is the sou rce of her claim ed d u e p rocess right, p rovid es
that [d ]isp osition staff and intake w orkers ap p ointed to p rovid e services u nd er
Chs. 48 and 938 m ay only be removed for cau se.

The state law u p on w hich she

relies applies only to rem ovals from office. Plaintiff only had a d u e p rocess
right to continu ed em p loym ent in a job as a d isp osition staff or intake w orker
ap p ointed to p rovid e services u nd er Chs. 48 or 968.

W is. Stat. § 17.10(6)(b).

Plaintiff d id not have a right to the chief intake ju venile officer p osition in the
circuit court. Cf. Gustafson v. Jones, 117 F.3d 1015, 1020 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding that
a p olice officer d oes not have p rop erty interest in a job assignm ent becau se statu te
requ ired cau se for d ischarge and su sp ensions not transfers). The statu tory basis
for Plaintiff s claim d oes not extend to d em otions or transfers as op p osed to
rem ovals from office.
The case p erhap s m ost analogou s to the p resent facts is that of Johnson v.
City of Fort W ayne, 91 F.3d 922 (7th Cir. 1996). One of the issues p resented w as
w hether a firefighter w ho w as d em oted from his rank of Assistant Fire Chief to a
p osition as a firefighter w ithou t notice and a hearing violated his Fou rteenth
Amendment d u e p rocess rights. While there w as no d isp u te in that case that
Johnson had a p rotectable interest in a p osition as a firefighter and that he cou ld
only be dismissed for cause, the court analyzed whether Johnson had a protectable
p rop erty interest in the p osition as the Assistant Fire Chief.

The cou rt fou nd

that Johnson cou ld be m oved from the rank of Assistant Fire Chief to the rank of

firefighter and that su ch a transfer d id not im p licate any Fou rteenth Am end m ent
protections as he did not have a protectable property interest in his rank.
Similarly, w hile Schu lz had a p rotectable p rop erty interest in her p osition
as a d isp ositional staff or intake w orker p rovid ing services u nd er chs. 48 and 938,
she d id not have a p rotectable p rop erty interest in her p osition as the

chief

juvenile intake w orker. The reorganization w ith Green Cou nty d id not resu lt in
her rem oval from office, bu t rather allow ed her to continu e p rovid ing su ch
services in a d ifferent d ep artm ent. It w as tantam ou nt to a transfer, not a rem oval,
and did not violate her Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons articu lated herein, Plaintiff s d u e p rocess rights w ere not
violated, and summary judgment should be granted in Defendant s favor.
Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 5th day of February, 2010.
