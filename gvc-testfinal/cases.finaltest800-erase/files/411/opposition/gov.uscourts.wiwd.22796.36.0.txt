UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

SHEILA SCHULZ
Plaintiff,
v.

Case No. 09-CV-298

GREEN COUNTY, WISCONSIN
Defendant.

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Plaintiff Sheila Schulz, by her counsel, Garvey
McNeil & Associates, S.C. and the Law Office of Lawrence Bensky, LLC, submits the
following brief in response to Defendant’s memorandum of law in support of its
motion for summary judgment.

INTRODUCTION
This is a civil action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking damages
and equitable relief on behalf of Plaintiff for claims arising out of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. This action alleges Green County
wrongfully discharged plaintiff Sheila Schulz without due process of law.
Defendant has admitted Ms. Schulz had a property interest in her job created by

1

statue statute and protected by the Constitution; however, it argues Ms. Schulz was
not entitled to due process because it terminated her pursuant to a bona fide
governmental reorganization.
Defendant assumes that transferring juvenile intake services from the circuit
court to the county Human Services Department (“the Department”) with the
intention of saving money justified terminating Ms. Schulz. However, the
“reorganization defense” is not as simple as Defendant argues. Missing from
Defendant’s brief and proposed findings of fact are facts to prove Ms. Schulz’s
position was actually abolished, and facts to prove it engaged in a bona fide
reorganization. Factors that may establish a reorganization defense are identified in
the substantive law and are the Defendant’s burden to prove.
In arguing that Green County has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating
it engaged in a bona fide reorganization and was thus exempt from the statutory and
constitutional due process requirements, Plaintiff highlights the elements of the
reorganization defense that have been created in the common law, and supplies
additional proposed facts demonstrating why Green County cannot prove it satisfies
those elements.
SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence on record shows “there is
no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “Genuine” issues are those

2

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 3 of 31

upon which “a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (1986). “Material” facts
are identified by the substantive law of the case. Id. “Only disputes over facts that
might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude
the entry of summary judgment.” Id. (citations omitted).
After a moving party demonstrates “that there is an absence of evidence to
support the nonmoving party’s case,” the burden shifts to the non-moving party to
establish, beyond the pleadings, that there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548 (1986). In ruling on summary judgment,
all inferences must be drawn in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.
Baron v. City of Highland Park, 195 F.3d 333, 338 (7th Cir. 1999).
In the present case, Defendant has not presented facts sufficient to prove it is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Further, genuine issues of material fact
preclude summary judgment in its favor. Therefore, the Defendant’s motion must
be denied.
FACTS 1
Plaintiff Sheila Schulz served as Green County’s chief juvenile intake worker
since 1997, working at the Green County circuit court under the supervision of the
Honorable James Beer. (PFOF ¶¶ 9-11.) In that position, she provided services
mandated by Wisconsin statutes chapters 48 and 938. (Id.) Her duties included

Plaintiff relies on the facts set forth in her Response to Defendant’s Proposed Findings of Facts and
the Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Proposed Findings of Fact. The following is a summary.

removing delinquent and abused children from their homes and placing them into
custody, providing crisis counseling and making recommendations regarding final
disposition of juvenile matters. (PFOF ¶ 6.) On September 30th 2008, the County’s
Finance Committee—chaired by Harvey Mandel, who also sits on the County’s
Personnel Committee—informed Ms. Schulz it was considering transferring juvenile
intake services to the Children, Youth, and Families Unit (“CYF Unit”) of the county
human services department (the “Department”). (P’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 35.)
During an October 29, 2008 personnel committee meeting, several people
from the community, including police chiefs, school district officials, and attorneys,
spoke on behalf of keeping juvenile intake services court attached. (PFOF ¶¶ 43, 44.)
Many of the people who spoke provided written correspondence to the Committee.
(Id.) A handful of these letters are critical of the services provided by the Human
Services Department; none of these letters criticize any specific Human Services
employee. (APFOF ¶ 81.)
A few weeks later, on November 19, 2008, the personnel committee met in
closed session in violation of Wisconsin’s open meeting’s law to discuss the juvenile
intake function. (APFOF ¶¶ 81-93.) Upon reconvening in open session, the
committee passed a measure eliminating Ms. Schulz’s position and creating a new
juvenile intake position in the Department. (PFOF ¶ 48; APFOF ¶¶ 92-93.) This
resolution passed the full county board on December 9, 2008. (PFOF ¶ 49.)
In order to mitigate her damages, Ms. Schulz applied for a handful of other
jobs, including the “new” juvenile intake position with the County. (PFOF ¶ 57;

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 5 of 31

APFOF ¶ 97.) She was allowed to submit her application after a union posting
period had ended and nobody from the bargaining unit had “posted in.” (PFOF ¶
55.) Ms. Schulz had a two-hour interview with Greg Holcomb, Director of Human
Services, and Dee Jaye Miles, supervisor of the CYF Unit, and was later offered the
juvenile intake position in the Department. (PFOF ¶ 58; P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 58.) In
the new position, Ms. Schulz performs substantially similar duties but receives a
much lower salary and was placed at the bottom of the “lay-off” seniority list.
(PFOF ¶¶ 24, 65; APFOF ¶¶ 6, 113.)
In transferring juvenile intake services from the circuit court to the
Department, the Defendant did not actually eliminate Ms. Schulz’s position; it
moved it to another department. (APFOF ¶¶ 4-7.) At that same time, the CYF Unit
supervisor Dee Jaye Miles assumed Ms. Schulz’ former title as chief intake worker.
(P’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 51.) The County spent little time considering the transfer of
services, gave little consideration to how it would structure delivery of services and
did not seriously evaluate whether the transfer of services would achieve costsavings. (APFOF ¶¶ 8-16, 19, 20-26.) By contrast, Green County recently transferred
its two emergency management (“EMS”) employees from the Veteran’s Services
Department to the Sheriff’s Department. (APFOF ¶ 101.) This transfer of services
was discussed and studied for over two years, the departments involved engaged in
cooperative planning related to the transfer of services, and the employees involved
maintained their positions at no reduction in salary. (APFOF ¶ 102-105.)

ARGUMENT
The defendant concedes Ms. Schulz had a property interest in her job by way
of the Wisconsin Statutes and guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but argues the
common law reorganization exception preempts these statutory protections under
the present circumstances. (Def. Br. at 5-6.) In so arguing, Defendant does not
address primary components of the common law defense but nevertheless
concludes it engaged in a bona fide reorganization.
I.

Plaintiff’s Constitutional Due Process Rights
In her 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim, Ms. Schulz alleged Green County deprived her

of property without due process of law, contrary to the 14th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. (Compl. ¶ 1.) Procedural due process claims employ a two-prong test:
(1) whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected property interest and (2)
whether the deprivation was without due process. Evans v. Morgan, 304 F. Supp. 2d
1100, 1104 (W.D. Wis. 2003).
As an intake worker appointed to provide services under chs. 48 and 938 of
the Wisconsin Statutes, Ms. Schulz could only be removed for cause. Wis. Stat.
§17.10(6)(b). As a result, she had a property interest in her employment. Cleveland
Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538-39 (1985); Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 480 U.S. 564,
577 (1972). Ms. Schulz was terminated without procedures sufficient to satisfy the
14th Amendment’s due process requirements. (Compl., ¶¶ 22, 35-37, Dkt 1; P’s Resp.
to PFOF ¶¶ 48-49.) Notice of charges and an opportunity to respond are essential
elements of due process. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542. In this case, Ms. Schulz was

6

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 7 of 31

removed from office without being afforded the due process guaranteed by the 14th
Amendment. (Compl., ¶¶ 22, 35-37, Dkt 1; P’s Resp. to PFOF ¶¶ 48-49.)
Green County does not dispute that Ms. Schulz had a protected interest in her
employment. (Def.’s Proposed Conclusions of Law, ¶¶ 1, 2; Def. Br. at 5-6.)
II.

The reorganization exception does not defeat Plaintiff’s due process claim
Wisconsin and Seventh Circuit courts have recognized an exception to due

process requirements when a municipal employer has discharged an employee as
part of a governmental reorganization. Misek v. City of Chicago, 783 F.2d 98, 100 (7th
Cir. 1986); Campana v. City of Greenfield, 164 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1092 (E.D. Wis.
2001)(citing State ex rel. Thein v. City of Milwaukee, 229 Wis. 12, 12, 281 N.W. 653
(1938)) aff’d, 38 Fed.Appx.339, 2002 WL 1370055 (7th Cir. June 24, 2002). When a court
determines a defendant engaged in a bona fide reorganization, the plaintiff is not
entitled to the pre-discharge due process protections that would apply if no
reorganization had occurred. However, “this exception only applies if the
governmental reorganization is ‘legitimate,’” and “[a] municipality cannot cry
reorganization in order to circumvent constitutional and statutory protections.”
Campana, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 1092-92 (citing Garrett v. Barnes, 961 F.2d 629, 634 (7th
Cir. 1992); Misek, 783 F.2d at 101; Thein, 281 N.W. at 656 (stating “civil service laws
are not to be evaded by a sham abolition of an old position for the purpose of
ousting an incumbent”).
Though Wisconsin or Seventh Circuit courts have not enumerated specific
factors that courts must always consider in determining whether a “legitimate”

7

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 8 of 31

governmental reorganization in fact occurred, the courts generally agree that a
“critical fact” tending to show whether a reorganization in fact occurred is whether
the plaintiff’s position was actually abolished. Conine v. City of Marinette, 1994 WL
592188 (Wis. App., Nov. 1, 1994)(explaining Misek); Unger v. Gregory, 249 Wis. 161,
163, 23 N.W.2d 480 (1946) (explaining a new position cannot be created by giving a
new title to an old position involving the same duties, because a name change with
no change in duties indicates bad faith in creating the new position)(citing Thein, 281
N.W. 563). To determine whether a position has actually been abolished, courts
consider whether the new position demands greater responsibility, greater or
different qualifications or education, and additional or different duties. Thein, 281
N.W. at 656. In other words, a municipal employer may not simply state it is
abolishing or eliminating a position and be entitled to a finding that it engaged in a
legitimate governmental reorganization. When a government purports to eliminate
a position, and removes a for-cause employee as a result, it must prove the position
was truly eliminated by demonstrating that it did not create a “new” position to
assume substantially the same duties as the position it claimed to abolish. Unger,
249 Wis. at 163 (citing Thein, 281 N.W. at 655-56).
For example, in Thein, an early reorganization case, the Wisconsin Supreme
Court concluded the Plaintiff’s “old” position had been eliminated and a “new”
position created, because the new position required greater qualifications and was

8

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

intended to impose a substantial degree of additional duties. 2 281 N.W. at 654-56.
In Unger v. Gregory, the government engaged a civil service classification examiner
to study the duties of the positions. 249 Wis. at 164-65. The examiner determined
the duties of the new position were substantially different from those of the old. Id.
In Campana v. City of Greenfield, the court found the new position required different
qualifications and duties. 164 F.Supp.2d at 1094. In Nelms v. Modisett, the court
found on summary judgment that the undisputed facts showed that the plaintiff’s
position had been abolished, and that nobody had been hired in his place. 153 F.3d
815, 821 (7th Cir. 1998). In Conroy v. City of Chicago, it was undisputed that the
responsibilities of the old position and the new position were “completely
different.” 708 F.Supp. 927, 944 (N.S. Ill. 1989). In Limes-Miller v. City of Chicago, the
court found that “no one at all was hired to replace” the plaintiff. 773 F. Supp. 1130,
1140 (N.D. Ill 1991). In other cases it was undisputed that the plaintiff’s position was
actually abolished, and the plaintiffs did not claim otherwise. State ex. rel. Miller v.
Baxter, 171 Wis. 193, 176 N.W. 770, 771 (1920); McCartney, 166 Wis. 2d at 969; Felde v.
Town of Brookfield, 570 F.Supp.2d 1070, 1075 (E.D. Wis. 2008). In Misek, the 7th Circuit
reversed dismissal on the ground that the plaintiffs asserted that their jobs were
never abolished, distinguishing cases in which “the plaintiffs admitted that their

In Thein, the department of public works originally employed specialized inspectors to handle specific
divisions: inspector of electric and gas installation, inspector of dredging and docks, inspector of highways,
inspector of sewer construction, inspector of tunnel construction. 281 N.W. at 654. The public works
commissioner decided to abolish the old positions and create new “public works inspector” positions. Persons
in the new positions were required to inspect all public works, including paving, sewers, water pipes, tunnels,
etc. Id.

jobs had been abolished and that a reorganization had in fact taken place.” 783 F.2d
at 101.
Other federal courts have similarly examined whether the plaintiff’s position
had been abolished. In Hartman v. City of Providence, the Court noted the
evisceration of these duties “caused one of the plaintiff’s most time-consuming
responsibilities to evaporate into thin air.” 636 F.Supp. 1395, 1399 n. 5 ( D.R.I. 1986).
Three other positions were eliminated at the same time Ms. Hartman’s was. Id. at
1400. In Franks v. Magnolia Hosp., it was undisputed that 71 positions had been
eliminated in a reduction-in-force. 888 F.Supp. 1310, 1313 (N.D. Miss. 1995).
DeSimone v. Board of Ed. involved a § 1983 claim based on a New York law that
required the Board of Education to appoint the person who had performed in an
abolished position, if the Board created a new position that entailed similar duties.
612 F.Supp. 1586, 1570 (E.D.N.Y, 1985). The court granted summary judgment in
plaintiff’s favor because it found the “plaintiff’s old position and the newly created
position were sufficiently similar” to trigger due process requirements. Id. at 1571,
1574.
The above cases establish that, for purposes of the reorganization exception,
a position is not eliminated if the employer merely creates a “new” position
involving substantially similar duties as the “eliminated” position. Accordingly, if
the Court finds that the plaintiff’s job was not eliminated, no reorganization-in-fact
occurred that would allow a government to circumvent due process protections.
Misek, 783 F.2d at 101. If the plaintiff’s job was not eliminated, the inquiry ends.

10

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Page 11 of 31

Plaintiff was wrongfully discharged. However, if the court finds the plaintiff’s
position was indeed eliminated, then it must determine whether the plaintiff can
show the abolishment of the position was a pretext for terminating a disfavored
employee. See generally, Campana, 1094 F.Supp.2d at 1094. Courts often look to
evidence of a larger governmental reorganization or reduction in force to determine
whether the abolishment of the position was part of a larger reorganization or
whether it was pretext to let go of a disfavored employee.
The reorganization cases have established a variety of non-dispositive factors
to consider when determining whether a governmental unit conducted a
reorganization-in-fact. Those factors include: whether a legislative body acted
within its powers “and in the manner prescribed by law,” Miller, 176 N.W. at 772;
Misek, 783 F.2d at 100-01; whether the ordinance that terminated the plaintiff had
been legally adopted, Miller, 176 N.W. at 772; Unger, 249 Wis. at 163; whether the
legislative body considered case management, financial or budgetary information
and whether it had been presented faulty information before resolving to eliminate a
position, Haka v. Lincoln County, 533 F. Supp. 2d 895, 907, 911-912 (W.D. Wis. 2008);
whether two separate departments had been combined, Campana, 164 F. Supp.2d at
1087; the amount of time spent considering the reorganization, Id. at 1094, and
whether the municipality hired an outside consultant to perform an operations
review and suggest personnel or departmental changes, Limes-Miller, 773 F. Supp.
1130, 1139 (N.D. Ill. 1991).

11

Page 12 of 31

For example, in Limes-Miller, the Illinois Dept. of Commerce commissioned
Touche Ross, a major accounting and consulting firm, to perform an operations
review and create a procedures manual. Touche Ross recommended a restructuring
that included eliminating the unit in which the plaintiff worked. 773 F.Supp. at
1139. In Campana, the city council and staff “had conducted surveys and considered
several different organizational structures to try to save money and streamline
operations.” 164 F.Supp.2d at 1087. In Duffy v. Sarault, the government agency
created a management task force to study and report on the City’s operations. 892
F.2d 139, 141 (1st Cir. 1989). This task force suggested several positions be abolished
and several others created. Id. Consideration of the reorganization factors is critical,
because the reorganization defense is not intended as a mechanism to easily deprive
a person of constitutionally guaranteed property. Misek, 783 F.2d at 101.
Lastly, the reorganization defense is an affirmative defense and thus the
burden of establishing whether a “reorganization in fact” occurred is upon the
defendant. Misek, 783 F.2d at 101; Dane County v. McCartney, 166 Wis. 2d 956, 968,
480 N.W.2d 830 (Ct. App. 1992). A defendant may not simply assert it engaged in a
legitimate governmental reorganization and then require the plaintiff to disprove
the assertion.
a. The plaintiff’s position was not eliminated
Central to this case, is that the County did not prove Ms. Schulz’s job was
actually eliminated. On the contrary, it appears to concede it was not. (Def. Br. at 2,
10.) Defendant states a new position was created in the department to provide

12

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 13 of 31

juvenile intake services and that the chief intake worker’s supervisory duties were
given to another employee within the department. (Def. Br at 2, PFOF ¶ 51.)
Defendant offers no evidence that the new position created does not perform
substantially the same duties as the old, nor can it: Green County must provide the
services outlined in the statute. Defendant eliminated the only occupied position in
the county that handled juvenile intake services. 3 (PFOF ¶¶ 16-17; P.’s Resp. to
PFOF ¶ 39.) Because the statute requires these services the County had no choice
but to re-create the juvenile intake position. Ms. Schulz’s old position and the new
position share a primary purpose: to “Provide general intake services for the
Juvenile Court, screening children taken into custody.” 4 (APFOF ¶ 6.) At the time
the alleged reorganization occurred, the county did not create, re-create or re-write
any other job descriptions. (APFOF ¶ 5.) Thus, the county did not intend a
departmental reorganization; it simply intended to take the juvenile intake position
out of the circuit court and place it in the Department.
b. No bona fide reorganization occurred
Anticipating Plaintiff’s argument that her position was not eliminated,
Defendant concedes “evidence as to whether a position was actually eliminated can
be strong evidence of an illegitimate reorganization,” but then concludes this law
does not apply in this case, because undisputed evidence shows the juvenile intake
3

There were at least two other employees who filled in for Ms. Schulz, but who otherwise were not available
for full-time work. (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 39.)
4
The new job description contains all the duties of the old job description. Some additional duties listed
provide more detail into specific duties that had been performed in the old position but that were not included in
that description. (APFOF ¶ 6.) Other additional duties germane to being part of the CYF Unit require no
additional education, qualification or skills. (Id.)

Page 14 of 31

department was moved from the Circuit Court and placed in the Department. (Def.
Br. at 10.) Defendant cites no authority for this conclusion. Instead, Defendant
likens the present case to Dane County v. McCartney, where two county departments
were combined and the plaintiff lost his job as a result. In McCartney, it was
undisputed that Dane County eliminated Mr. McCartney’s position, and Mr.
McCartney did not claim otherwise. McCartney, 166 Wis. 2d at 969. The primary
issue that exists in the present case—whether a “reorganization” occurred at all, and
whether Ms. Schulz’s position was actually eliminated—did not exist in McCartney.
As such, McCartney is inapposite.
McCartney involved the highly publicized merger of the Dane County social
services department and the community support and health services department, to
create the human services department. Id. at 959; see also Mike Stamler, Matthews
Urges County to Limit Panels’ Power, Capital Times, Feb. 19, 1988 at 20; Mary
Balousek, Social Units Urged to Merge County Agencies Faulted in Report, Wisconsin
State Journal, May 12, 1989 at 1A; Mary Balousek, Phelps, Ezalarab Differ on County
Issues, Wisconsin State Journal, Mar. 20, 1989 at 1B. The “sweeping reorganization”
of the two departments in McCartney “had been discussed for years.” Id. The
County’s research related to the reorganization included 54 pages of
recommendations from two independent consulting firms and a task force report
issued by a University of Wisconsin professor. Balousek, Wisconsin State Journal,
May 12, 1989 at 1A . Both the consultants and the task force found serious flaws in
the way the County was providing services to the community. Id. Prior to the

14

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 15 of 31

reorganization, the merged departments were directed to create a “system of joint
planning, budget review and evaluation procedures.” Stamler, Capital Times, Feb.
19, 1988 at 20. The reorganization’s blueprint was established well before the
County board voted to fundamentally change the way in which Dane County would
supervise, administer, and deliver social services.
In contrast, Green County’s only research into whether the Department could
provide the statutorily required juvenile intake services was during a twentyminute, illegally closed session meeting of the County’s Personnel Committee, in
which the committee first excluded Ms. Schulz and then interviewed Ms. Miles and
Greg Holcomb to inquire whether the Department could handle the additional
duties. (APFOF ¶¶ 81-93.) The County has not produced any documentation that
would tend to show the Department could provide the services or that transferring
services would save any money. When asked to produce all documents related to
studies, analyses, consultations, meetings, comparisons or reviews related to the
relocation of juvenile intake services, the County produced three pages of handwritten post-it notes. (APFOF ¶ 11.)
The present case more closely mirrors Haka v. Lincoln County, where the
defendant alleged the reorganization defense to wrongful discharge under the False
Claims Act and the First Amendment. 533 F.Supp.2d at 898. In denying summary
judgment in defendant’s favor, this Court considered the following evidence of
illegitimacy, making summary judgment inappropriate:

15

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 16 of 31

It is undisputed that no one did any real investigation to determine
whether the reorganization would actually bring about the
improvements identified in the resolution, that no one attempted to
determine whether the [person who would assume Plaintiff’s duties]
was qualified to head the child support agency and that no one ever
seriously considered other options.
Id. at 911-12. Also relevant was that a champion of the reorganization—a county
board and finance committee member—“did not know what the fiscal impact of his
plan would be…, failed to support the resolution with any financial, budgetary or
case load data,” and provided the board with incorrect financial projections. Id. at
905-06.
As in Haka, the demonstrable absence of evidence to support the stated
reasons for the termination of Ms. Schulz’s employment would permit a reasonable
jury to conclude that the stated reasons were pretextual. Moreover, the evidence in
the record is sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to conclude that the County’s
action was taken in bad faith to remove Ms. Schulz from her position as Green
County’s chief intake worker. The evidence includes, for example, the
unprecedented attempt to get Judge Beer to discipline Ms. Schulz when she was out
for a medical emergency; Ms. Miles communications with County decision makers
questioning Ms. Schulz’s ethical conduct; the statement by the county board chair
that the county needed more oversight of Ms. Schulz; the county’s insistence that
Ms. Schulz be denied seniority, despite having allowed seniority to a part time
juvenile intake worker who transferred into the Department; the unwillingness of
County decision makers to even consider Ms. Schulz’s suggestions for budget

16

savings and for consolidating on-call functions, despite their claim now that their
goal was simply financial; and Ms. Miles’ statement that there was no need in early
October 2008 to consider consolidating on-call functions because it was “moot,” that
is, the transfer of the function was a done deal. See APFOF ¶¶ 107-119.
In addressing budgetary and personnel issues, Green County explored no
option other than the action taken, which it alleged required removing the plaintiff
from her position. (APFOF ¶ 16.) Judge Beer’s and Ms. Schulz’s and District
Attorney Luhman’s attempts to cooperate with the Department to resolve both the
financial and personnel issues related to the on-call system were ignored. (P.’s Resp.
to PFOF ¶¶ 36, 40, 53, 64.) Failure to explore options that would have retained the
plaintiff is evidence the County intended to remove her from office. See, e.g.
Campana, 164 F.Supp.2d at 1083-84 (city considered at least three different
organizational structures).
Next, Green County did not consider how the juvenile intake function would
be supervised. The Wisconsin statutes require a chief intake worker to supervise the
other workers, when the county employs more than one worker. Wis. Stat. §§
48.06(3), 938.06(3). Before the transfer, Ms. Schulz had acted at the chief worker.
(PFOF ¶ 12.) Supervising the juvenile intake department as a whole was Circuit
Court Judge Beer. (PFOF ¶ 11.) There is no evidence the county board ever
considered who would act as the chief worker, or whether taking the supervisory
duties away from the Circuit Court Judge (who is paid by the state) would have a
negative fiscal impact upon the County. (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶¶ 11, 51.) The record

17

Page 18 of 31

before the county board (as expressed in meeting minutes) is devoid of these
considerations. (See PFOF ¶ 44.) Quite possibly, Ms. Miles appointed herself chief.
Yet, even if the County had addressed the supervisory responsibility, there is no
evidence the County reviewed Ms. Miles qualifications to determine whether she
was qualified to serve as the chief intake worker or supervise the intake services. 5
(P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 51.) Ms. Miles has rarely if ever performed the juvenile intake
function, did not know what paperwork was required, and did not know the
procedures that must be followed when removing a child from his or her home and
placing that child into custody. (Id.)
Juvenile intake is not an easy position to learn. You have liability, you
have the law, you have policies and procedures. Taking someone’s
child into custody is a serious business that you need training on, that
you can’t just do willy-nilly. You have to know what you’re doing. So
it takes time to be a good intake worker and to be able to put all those
pieces together.
(Schulz Dep. p. 91.) Not only was the County’s lack of consideration related to the
supervisory responsibilities indicative of illegitimacy, it affects the community of
people in need of juvenile intake services.
Lastly, the County’s alleged cost-savings presented to the Personnel
Committee and full board was unsupported by any financial data or other evidence,
and provided no explanation for the alleged cost-savings. The Personnel Committee
and full board passed this resolution without demanding such evidence, when on its
face, the alleged cost-savings was patently unreasonable.
5

It is possible the County addressed these issues during the illegally closed session of the personnel committee,
discussed in Section II. C., infra.

The County’s Finance Director prepared a one-page document alleging a
$78,746 savings if juvenile intake services were performed by the Department. (P.’s
Resp. to PFOF ¶ 42; APFOF ¶ 27.) This document was presented at the October 29,
2008 Personnel Committee meeting, and was the only financial information the
board reviewed before enacting the resolution. (Id.) Among the most questionable
cost-savings allegations are those related to regular payroll (salary), overtime,
mileage, and insurance. 6
First, one primary reason the County transferred juvenile intake services to
the department was because one person could not handle the juvenile intake
workload, (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 52) yet the proposed budget at the Department only
budgeted one salary to handle all of juvenile intake. (APFOF ¶ 27). Moreover, at the
circuit court, Judge Beer’s time spent supervising the juvenile intake department
was on the State’s dime. (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 11.) After the transfer, the county
must pay Ms. Miles—an hourly employee who is entitled to overtime pay—for her
role in supervising the juvenile intake department. (APFOF ¶¶ 33, 34.) Related to
the salary are fringe benefits, which are calculated using a percentage of the regular
payroll. (APFOF ¶ 38.) If salary increases, fringe benefits increase proportionally.
The reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the Committee was aware the
proposed Department salary budget was inaccurate.

6

Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Findings of Fact provides a very detailed, line-item accounting that
demonstrates the alleged juvenile intake budget for the Department was unreasonable. (P.’s Add’l PFOF ¶¶ 2080.)

Second, the County was concerned with the amount of overtime Ms. Schulz
accumulated, but did not look into the causes of overtime in the juvenile intake
department, and thus relied upon a solution that had no chance of reducing
overtime. Overtime occurs in the juvenile intake department when a worker is
required to perform an intake function outside of normal business hours, or between
about 5:00 pm and 8:00 am. (APFOF ¶ 39.) Overtime for a juvenile intake worker
depends upon the number of calls the on-call worker receives, the amount of time it
takes to respond to the call, and any court appearances that extend outside normally
scheduled business hours. 7 (APFOF ¶ 40.) At the circuit court, Ms. Schulz
accumulated overtime for emergency situations relating to custody of children.
(APFOF ¶ 44.) She accumulated little if any overtime as it related to paperwork or
other intake duties of her office. (Id.) Because overtime is accrued whenever a
worker must respond to an emergency outside of normal business hours, the only
way to reduce over-time pay would be to employ a juvenile intake worker whose
normally scheduled hours are between 5:00 pm and 8:00 am and 24 hours on the
weekends, or require employees to forfeit the equivalent of their normally scheduled
hours to make up for the time spent handling emergencies. 8 (APFOF ¶¶ 42-43, 5154.) Neither of these options were implemented at the Department. (Id.) Had the
7

Per the ASFCME Unit 1162-A collective bargaining agreement, “Employees called out to work at a time not
consecutive with their regular schedule of hours shall receive the equivalent of a minimum of two (2) hours of
wages, either as compensatory time or pay.” (APFOF ¶¶ 49, 50.) Ms. Schulz was not subject to this contract at
the circuit court. (Id.)
8
Green County recently moved its emergency management (“EMS”) department from the Veteran’s Services to
the Sheriff’s Department. (APFOF ¶ 101.) One of concerns was EMS overtime. (APFOF ¶ 52.) At the
Sheriff’s department, there were employees whose regularly scheduled hours are between 5:00 pm and 8:00
am., and those employees were available to handle emergencies that occur after hours without incurring
overtime pay. (APFOF ¶ 53.)

20

Page 21 of 31

County diligently examined the juvenile intake overtime issue, it would have
realized the proposed solution was incapable of delivering the alleged savings.
Third, the County alleged it would save several thousand dollars on mileage
if the Department administered juvenile intake services. Mileage for the juvenile
intake worker occurs when the worker is required to travel somewhere to perform a
juvenile intake function. (APFOF ¶ 64.) Mileage for juvenile intake is directly
proportionate to the number of open cases. (APFOF ¶ 65.) The only way to
eliminate juvenile intake mileage would be to perform fewer services. (APFOF ¶
67.) Failing to perform the services would violate the Wisconsin Statutes. Ms.
Schulz explained to the Personnel Committee how mileage for juvenile intake is
calculated, yet the County has presented no evidence to show the Committee
demanded documentation or explanation from the Department to explain how it
would achieve estimated the cost-savings for mileage. (APFOF ¶ 68.) In actuality,
the cost-savings was based on utter speculation. At deposition Ms. Miles could
provide no basis for her estimate that juvenile intake mileage would be lower in the
Department, other than to state that she could not imagine anyone in her unit
having $7,200 in mileage. 9 (APFOF ¶ 72.) From these facts, a jury could conclude
the alleged cost-savings on mileage was erroneous.
Lastly, the county estimated transferring the juvenile intake services would
create a $900.00 savings on liability insurance premiums. (APFOF ¶ 78.) Green
County holds one liability insurance policy covering all County departments.
9

Ms. Miles later stated that one of her employees did incur this much mileage. (APFOF ¶ 73.)

21

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 22 of 31

(APFOF ¶ 75.) Each County department pays a percentage of the premium. If the
County eliminates one department, the County’s premium does not change.
(APFOF ¶ 77.) Either the County Finance Director or someone on the board should
have realized this alleged cost savings was inaccurate. The lack of attention to detail
is indicative of an illegitimate reorganization.
The Defendant contends the alleged cost-savings was accurate, because in
June of 2009, it transferred $74,633 to the County’s General Fund, which represents
the cost-savings on juvenile intake. (Def. Br. at 13.) If, however, at the end of the
fiscal year, a County department is over-budget, the County transfers money from
the General Fund to that department. (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 63.) For example, in
March of 2009, the Finance Committee authorized transfer of over $100,000 from the
General fund to the Human Services Department, to cover the Department’s 2008
budget shortfall. (Id.) Second, the Department did not provide the Finance
Committee with any documents to support the estimate that it only spent the
equivalent of one person’s salary on juvenile intake services for 2009, and at that
time, nobody had calculated the amount of time the Department had devoted to
juvenile intake. (APFOF ¶¶ 20-26.) Third, the CYF Unit, which absorbed the
juvenile intake function, was significantly over-budget in the three other areas of
estimated cost savings: overtime (between $3,300 and $9,280 over-budget), office
supplies (between $873 and $1,778 over-budget), and mileage (between $6,000 and
$8,712 over-budget). (APFOF ¶¶ 56, 63, 74.) The County Finance Director testified

22

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 23 of 31

that is possible these amounts reflect money spent on juvenile intake that were not
attributed to the juvenile intake account. (APFOF ¶ 26.)
The plaintiff does not dispute that the County has likely saved approximately
$10,000 as a result of consolidating the CYF Unit and juvenile intake “on call”
systems. This fact is immaterial, however, because this change did not require the
county to terminate Ms. Schulz. See P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 53.
The only other possible cost-savings is the fact that the county formerly paid
Ms. Schulz $26.99 per hour in 2008 to perform a function similar to what they hired
her to perform in 2009 for $19.27 per hour. The County asserted in its brief that one
reason for removing for Ms. Schulz was to create new a position at a lower salary.
(Def. Br. at 3.) This in itself is unlawful. By definition, that is not an allowable cause
under Wis. Stat. §§ 17.10(6)(b)1 and 17.001 (defining “cause” as inefficiency, neglect
of duty, official misconduct, or malfeasance in office). A municipality may not
terminate a for-cause employee because that employee is highly paid. If that were
the case, a County would have carte blanche to terminate any for-cause employee
under the guise of a legitimate cost-cutting measure. Moreover, any savings due to
the lower hourly rate was not a purpose of the transfer, but instead a result the
County mistakenly believed was a necessary consequence of the action. (P’s Resp.
to PFOF ¶ 40.)
Admissible evidence demonstrates the county had no basis for believing the
cost-savings alleged could be achieved, the unsupported, one-page of accounting
provided to the county was facially inaccurate, and in actuality, the county cannot

23

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Page 24 of 31

demonstrate it achieved the estimated cost savings. The Defendant’s motion should
be denied.
c. The resolution transferring juvenile intake services was voted on pursuant to an
illegal meeting
Reorganization cases have also placed emphasis upon whether a legislative
body acted within its powers “and in the manner prescribed by law.” Miller, 176
N.W. at 772; Misek, 783 F.2d at 100-01. Whether the governmental entity acted
legally has generally been addressed in the context of directing courts to avoid
considering the subjective motivations of individual or collective county board
members; however, a court may consider illegal procedures employed by the
legislative body when determining whether a reorganization-in-fact did or did not
occur. Thein, 281 N.W. at 655-56. In this case, the County’s Personnel Committee
voted to recommend the resolution that terminated Ms. Schulz pursuant to an
illegally closed meeting.
The Wisconsin open meeting law requires that every meeting of a
governmental body be held in open session unless specifically exempted under the
open meetings law. Wis. Stat. §§ 19.83(1), 19.82(1). One of these exemptions is
found under § 19.85(1)(c), which states a governmental body may consider in closed
session the “employment, promotion, compensation or performance evaluation data
of any public employee over which the governmental body has jurisdiction or
exercises responsibility.” The law also provides that “[n]o business may be taken up
at any closed session except that which relates to matters contained in the chief

24

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 25 of 31

presiding officer's announcement of the closed session.” Wis. Stat. § 19.85(1). The
Wisconsin Attorney General has interpreted § 19.85(1)(c) to be limited and narrowly
construed to considerations of employment, compensation, promotion and
performance evaluations of a specific employee or employees, and not to general policy
considerations. 80 Wis. Op. Atty. Gen. 176 (Feb. 25, 1992), 1992 WL 528441 (Wis.
A.G.)(emphasis added). This exception does not apply where personnel or
management policies are discussed generally. Id. (citing 49 Op.Att’y Gen. V (1960)).
The purpose of the exception is “to protect a particular employee who is being
considered or discussed and not to protect the public agency involved.” Id. On the
contrary, “The mere fact that items of public policy or future personnel relations are
to be discussed is not a sufficient reason for a secret meeting. It is, in fact, a reason
for holding an open meeting.” Id.
The County Personnel Committee discussed transferring the juvenile intake
services only twice. The first time was during an open session on October 29, 2008,
in which several people spoke and submitted written comments against the transfer.
(PFOF ¶ 43.) A handful of persons expressed concern over the Department’s ability
to provide juvenile intake services. (APFOF ¶ 81.) The Personnel Committee next
addressed the juvenile intake position in closed session during its November 19,
2008 meeting. (APFOF ¶¶83-84.)
The November 19, 2009 Personnel Committee minutes indicate the committee
went into closed session pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 19.85(1)(c). (APFOF ¶ 83.) Ms.
Schulz, who attended the meeting, was asked to leave for the closed session, and

25

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 26 of 31

Ms. Miles, along with her supervisor Greg Holcomb, stayed for the closed session.
(APFOF ¶ 86.) While Ms. Miles testified that she believed the purpose of the closed
session was to discuss her performance, the committee actually addressed the CYF
Unit’s general ability to absorb the juvenile intake function, whether the unit could
adequately respond to requests from law enforcement officials, and whether or not a
conflict of interest existed between juvenile intake custody decisions and her unit’s
budget. (APFOF ¶¶ 85-93.) One committee member characterized the closed
session as means to get representatives from Human Services in to get their follow
up to criticisms made about the Department in general during the October 29, 2008
meeting. (APFOF ¶ 84.) Immediately after reconvening in open session, the
committee voted to transfer the juvenile intake functions, thus terminating Ms.
Schulz’s employment. (APFOF ¶ 92-93.) The actual discussions that occurred
during the closed session were general policy discussions related to a county
department’s ability to handle additional duties. (APFOF ¶¶ 87-89.) Because the
Personnel Committee did not address the work performance of an individual, the
session was improperly closed. (APFOF ¶ 91.) Even if Ms. Miles at some point
during the closed session were asked to defend her own performance, it is clear that
general policy and structural matters dominated the meeting. The Defendant’s
failure to “act in a manner prescribed by law” in itself precludes summary judgment
in its favor. Miller, 176 N.W. at 772; Misek, 783 F.2d at 100-01; Thein, 281 N.W. at
655-56; Unger, 249 Wis. at 163.

In support of its reorganization defense, Green County contends the
following: 1) juvenile intake duties were moved from the circuit court to the county
human services department, 2) the county consolidated its statutorily mandated
juvenile intake on-call service with the CYF’s unit’s newly created discretionary oncall service, 3) the County hoped to save money by enacting the transfer, and 4) the
county hoped to eliminate the need for a part-time juvenile intake worker. Plaintiff
does not dispute that the county was authorized by statute to move juvenile intake
duties from the circuit court to the Department, and does not dispute the County
consolidated two on-call systems. These two items alone, however; do not
demonstrate the county engaged in a bona fide reorganization such that it was
justified in terminating her. Indeed, even if all four items were undisputed they
would be insufficient to invoke the reorganization exception because the termination
of the court-attached juvenile intake worker was not necessary for the transfer of the
function to the Department. The most logical inference based on the facts is that Ms.
Schulz was wrongfully removed from office.
III.

The County removed the Plaintiff from office
Lastly, the defendant argues Ms. Schulz was not removed from her position,

because after the county had terminated her, she applied for and was hired to
perform juvenile intake services for the county, with no break in service. (Def. Br. at
14.) To support its argument, Defendant contends Ms. Schulz was actually
demoted, and thus not entitled to any due process protections. (Id. at 15.) Genuine
and material evidence suggest Ms. Schulz was terminated and not demoted.

27

Page 28 of 31

After the resolution eliminating Ms. Schulz’s position passed the Personnel
Committee, Judge Beer wrote to Harvey Mandel asking if Ms. Schulz would be
offered the “new” position in Human Services. (APFOF ¶ 94.) Mr. Mandel did not
respond to him, and could offer no explanation as to why he outright ignored a
simple question posed by the County’s circuit court judge. (Id.)
After the resolution passed the full board Ms. Schulz applied for the “new”
juvenile intake job as was necessary to mitigate her damages. (PFOF ¶ 57.) Notably,
the county listed the new position as a grade 61 or 62 because they county did not
know who would end up being hired into the new position. (APFOF ¶ 96.) Ms.
Miles had encouraged a member of the bargaining unit to post into the position, but
that person declined. (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 55.) No other bargaining unit members
posted in, and the County has provided no evidence it received an application from
anyone besides Ms. Schulz. (Id.) Ms. Schulz was required to wait out a five day
union posting period, complete a full application, and endure a two hour interview.
(PFOF ¶ 55; P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 58.) After she was hired, she was subject to a 90
day probationary period. (APFOF ¶ 98.)
At the time Ms. Schulz applied for the Green County position, she applied for
other jobs. (APFOF ¶ 97.) The County concedes it did not guarantee her the job and
actually alleges it had to terminate her because the position was being placed in the
union, and the union required a posting to its members. (APFOF ¶ 17, 95; PFOF ¶
54.) However, Mr. Morgan testified that a juvenile intake position at human services
did not have to be part of the bargaining unit and that the County sought assurances

28

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 29 of 31

it was allowed to put the position in the union. (P.’s Resp. to PFOF ¶ 54.) Further,
the County’s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement itself was
erroneous. The agreement only requires posting to bargaining unit members when
a vacancy occurs. (Id.) If Ms. Schulz were transferred with the position she’d spent
eleven years in, there would not have been a vacancy. (Id.) It was the County’s
termination of Ms. Schulz that created the vacancy.
The fact that Ms. Schulz’s employment was ending caused her a tremendous
amount of distress. (APFOF ¶ 100.) At that time, one of her primary concerns was
maintaining her employer-provided health care for her and her children. (Id.) The
uncertainty surrounding this issue alone placed undue stress upon Ms. Schulz. (Id.)
Lastly, the county took all Ms. Schulz’s eighteen years of seniority (for lay-off
purposes) away upon being hired in the Department. (APFOF ¶ 113.) Mr. Morgan
testified that when a county employee transfers into a bargaining unit of a union,
that person’s seniority date for purposes of lay-off is the date they began working in
the new bargaining unit. (APFOF ¶ 109.) He testified that this is the case even when
a member of one bargaining unit transfers into a new bargaining unit of the same
union. (Id.) However, the county did not apply this policy to a county employee
who had been hired into a vacant position in the 1162-A bargaining unit four
months prior to Ms. Schulz. (APFOF ¶¶ 110-114.) The reasonable inference drawn
from this is that the reorganization was pretext to remove a disfavored employee.
The County argues it was required to remove Ms. Schulz from office because
the union contract prohibited transfer of an employee, yet argues it did not remove

29

Case: 3:09-cv-00298-wmc

Document #: 36

Filed: 02/26/2010

Page 30 of 31

her from office at all. The County cannot have it both ways. The most reasonable
inference based on the facts is that Ms. Schulz was removed from office within the
meaning of Wis. Stat. § 17.10.
CONCLUSION
At its core, this case is not about whether Green County reorganized its
juvenile intake department. It’s about whether the Plaintiff suffered a constitutional
deprivation as a result of wrongful discharge. Any Wisconsin county may
reorganize at will, but must do so within the bounds of various state statutes that
place burdens and responsibilities upon counties, including chapters 59, 48, 938 and
17. Plaintiff does not dispute that Green County was authorized by statute to place
its juvenile intake services in the Department; Plaintiff claims she was wrongfully
discharged when the County did so.
The cases are clear: a municipality cannot “cry reorganization” and have it be
so. Defendant claims it was interested in cutting costs. This is a legitimate concern
but hardly a unique one; one would be hard-pressed to find any municipality in this
State that has no cost-cutting concerns. The County was concerned with insuring
continuation of juvenile intake services in the event the intake worker was absent.
Again, this is a legitimate concern, but the county’s response of terminating the
person who had provided those services for eleven years was unnecessary, unfair,
and counterproductive. It also unconstitutionally took Ms. Schulz’s property
without due process of law. Because the Defendant did cannot prove it actually
eliminated Ms. Schulz’s position, and because it cannot prove it engaged in a bona

30

fide reorganization that actually included the elimination of Ms. Schulz’s position,
summary judgment in its favor is inappropriate, and Defendant’s motion should be
denied.
