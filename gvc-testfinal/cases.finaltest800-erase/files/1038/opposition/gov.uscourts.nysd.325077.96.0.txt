SUMMARY
Concord asserts that, as a matter of law, they cannot be liable for patent infringement

because Philips’ patent rights were exhausted when Concord purchased the infringing CDs from
a licensed manufacturer and co-Defendant, Music City Optical Media, Inc. (“Music City”).
Concord’s analysis, however, suffers from a critical flaw, namely, their improper assumption that
they purchase authorized CDs from Philips’ licensee. Simply stated, this is not true. Concord’s
assumption is directly contrary to Philips’ First Amended Complaint, which specifically alleges
why such CD sales are not authorized.

The mere fact that Philips has entered into an

unterminated license agreement with Music City does not establish that any sale by such licensee
is automatically an authorized sale. To the contrary, where, as here, a licensee fails to perform
under the license (by not paying royalties), any CD sales by the licensee are not authorized.
Because such CD sales are not authorized, the law is clear that there can be no exhaustion of
Philips’ patent rights. In addition, Concord’s reasoning contradicts established Supreme Court
precedent. Moreover, Philips has not terminated Music City’s license because it covers patents
and products other than the CD-Discs and the ‘846 Patent that are the subject of this action. For
these reasons, Concord’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied.
II.

ARGUMENT
A.

Applicable Standard - Rule 12(b)(6) Motions

When deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must accept all the
material allegations of the claim as true, even if doubtful in fact, and must draw all reasonable
inferences in the claimant's favor. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007);
Ruotolo v. City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir. 2008); Cerveceria Modelo, S.A. De C.
V. v. USPA Accessories LLC, 2008 WL 1710910, *2 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). The Court's role in
2

Page 3 of 10

deciding a motion to dismiss is merely to assess the legal feasibility of the Complaint, not to
assess the weight of the evidence that might be offered in support thereof. Leyse v. Clear
Channel Broadcasting, Inc., 2006 WL 23480, *1 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). Motions to dismiss under
Rule 12(b)(6) are rarely granted and are generally viewed with disfavor. See Patane v. Clark,
508 F.3d 106, 116 (2d Cir. 2007). Indeed, a well-pleaded Complaint may proceed even if it
appears that a recovery is very remote and unlikely. Bell Atlantic Corp., 127 S. Ct. at 1965.
In two recent decisions, Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct. 2197 (2007), and Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007), the Supreme Court revisited the liberal noticepleading standards embodied in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, and the narrow scope of a court's review when
the sufficiency of a pleading is challenged under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In Erickson (a case
ignored by Concord but the Supreme Court’s most recent pronouncement on this issue), the
Court reaffirmed Rule 8's liberal notice-pleading requirements, stating "[s]pecific facts are not
necessary; the statement need only 'give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the
grounds upon which it rests.' " Id. at 2200 (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp., 127 S. Ct. at 1964
(quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99 (1957)). Consistently, in Bell Atlantic,
the Court stated that adequate pleading requires "only enough facts to state a claim to relief that
is plausible on its face." Id. at 1974. 1
The Second Circuit interpreted Erickson and Bell Atlantic to require a district court to
apply "a flexible plausibility standard" when considering the sufficiency of a Complaint under
Rule 12(b)(6). Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157 (2d Cir. 2007). Under this "flexible plausibility
1

Philips’ First Amended Complaint is in marked contrast to C&D Defendants’
counterclaims for patent misuse and tortious interference with business relationships, which are
subject to Philips’ co-pending motion to dismiss (Dkt. 67), and which are not plausible on their
face.

standard," generalized allegations will often suffice; the standard "obliges a pleader to amplify a
claim with some factual allegations" only "in those contexts where such amplification is needed
to render the claim plausible." Id. at 157-58. In other words, if the liberal pleading standard is
met, the Complaint must be allowed to proceed "even if it strikes a savvy judge ... 'that a
recovery is very remote and unlikely.' " Bell Atlantic Corp., 127 S. Ct. at 1964.
Philips’ patent infringement claim against Concord meets the flexible plausibility
standard.
B.

The Doctrine Of Patent Exhaustion Is Inapplicable Because The CD Sales
Were Not Authorized From Philips’ Licensees

Concord does not purchase authorized CDs from a Philips’ licensee. Thus, they are
simply incorrect that the doctrine of patent exhaustion precludes Philips from enforcing its patent
rights against them. Indeed, it is well-established that patent “[e]xhaustion is triggered only by a
sale authorized by the patent holder.” Quanta Computer Inc. v. LG, Electronics, Inc., 128 S. Ct.
2109, 2121 (2008). Concord does not and cannot contest this point of law. Instead, they merely
describe the existence of an unterminated license agreement between Philips and Defendant
Music City to suggest that any CD purchases from this particular licensee are automatically
authorized.

This argument is flawed.

Not only is it inconsistent with fundamental legal

principles, but it runs afoul of Philips’ factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint.
It is hornbook law that the mere existence of a license does not provide a complete
defense for purposes of infringement or patent exhaustion. General Talking Pictures Corp. v
Western Elec. Co., 305 U.S. 124, 126-27 (1938). In General Talking Pictures, the Court found
a licensee was violating a field of use restriction in a license, and therefore the licensee and the
purchaser could be sued for patent infringement. Id. Where a licensee makes and sells a
patented article in violation of the terms of its license, “the effect is precisely the same as if no

4

Page 5 of 10

license whatsoever had been granted,” and the patentee can sue both the licensee and the
purchaser for infringement of the patent. Id. at 127. Moreover, a patentee may grant a license
“upon any condition the performance of which is reasonably within the reward which the
patentee by the grant of the patent is entitled to secure.” Id. (quoting United States v. General
Electric Co., 272 U.S. 476, 489 (1926)).
Philips has pleaded that Music City violated express conditions of the license (i.e., to
submit quarterly “Royalty Reporting Forms” to Philips listing all CD-Discs that it manufactures
and sells, to pay royalties on such CD-Discs, and to keep accurate books and records relating to
Music City’s manufacture and sale or other disposal of CD-Discs), and therefore Philips can sue
both Music City and Concord for unauthorized sales of CDs. Thus, the issue of whether patent
exhaustion attaches turns in part on whether the activity or sales are authorized under the license,
not on the mere existence of a license. See Quanta, 128 S. Ct. at 2122. Here, Philips clearly
alleges in its First Amended Complaint that Concord’s purchases of CDs made or sold by
Philips’ licensees, who are in material breach of their license agreements, are not authorized.
Even a cursory review of the patent license confirms that Music City has violated express
conditions of the agreement. According to § 2.01 of the patent license agreement (Exhibit M of
the “FAC”), Music City is licensed "to manufacture Licensed Products .... and sell or otherwise
dispose of Licensed Products so manufactured in all countries of the world." However, pursuant
to §1.15, Licensed Products are defined as "CD's.... which are duly reported and for which the
royalties due hereunder are paid in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement." Under
the express language of the license agreement, if the royalties are not reported and paid, then
products are not Licensed Products and no authorization, by definition, is given under the
agreement. A court's "consideration [on a motion to dismiss] is limited to facts stated on the face

5

of the complaint, in documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by
reference, and to matters of which judicial notice may be taken." Allen v. WestPoint-Pepperell,
Inc., 945 F.2d 40, 44 (2d Cir. 1991); accord, e.g., Faulkner v. Beer, 463 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.
2006). Thus, for at least this reason, Philips has properly established that Concord does not
purchase authorized CDs from a Philips’ licensee.
Additionally, in the First Amended Complaint, Philips alleges that Music City and others
were granted a license to make and sell CDs falling within the claims of U.S. Patent No.
5,068,846. (First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶¶ 58, 60, 68).

However, Concord ignores

Philips’ express allegations that any such licensed right to make and sell CDs is contingent upon
the payment of royalties to Philips (FAC ¶¶ 75-78, 96), and is conditioned upon the submission
of “Royalty Reporting Forms” to Philips and keeping records relating to the Defendants’
manufacture and sale or other disposal of CD-Discs (FAC ¶ 82). Concord also disregards
Philips’ allegation that the Defendant licensees have been making and selling CDs covered by
the ‘846 patent and have wrongly retained royalties that should have been paid to Philips.
(FAC ¶¶ 87-90, 95-97). Thus, the CD sales that Concord clings to are not authorized.
To suggest otherwise — as Concord does — vitiates a basic licensing principle: a patent
owner who licenses sales of a patented device rightfully expects to receive the value of the patent
in exchange for the license. Philips’ licensees have failed to pay the necessary royalties in
conjunction with their licenses, which are factual allegations that must be accepted as true for the
purposes of this motion. ATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir.
2007). Thus, any downstream CD sales from the Defendant licensees, including Music City, are
not authorized. Thus, Concord cannot rely on these sales to invoke patent exhaustion.

Concord’s argument that it is irrelevant that “Philips is alleging breach of the License
Agreement by Music City” highlights their confusion with respect to the doctrine of patent
exhaustion and the scope of patent infringement. The purpose of the patent exhaustion doctrine
has never been to provide bonanzas for purchasers and, in fact, patent exhaustion should not
apply unless “it may fairly be said that the patentee has received his reward for the use of the
article.” United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U.S. 265, 278 (1942). While a patentee is
“entitled to but one royalty for a patented machine,” he is entitled to obtain that one royalty, and
the patent exhaustion doctrine should not be applied so woodenly as to defeat that right. Id.
According to Concord’s erroneous reasoning, Philips has no right to collect royalties on the CDDiscs at issue. Such a standard not only contradicts logic, but also black letter law.
Furthermore, Concord’s reliance on Quanta is misplaced. Nothing in Quanta supports
Concord’s position that patent exhaustion applies here. The Supreme Court’s holding of patent
exhaustion in Quanta was based on the fact that there was an authorized sale from LG’s
licensee, Intel, to Quanta, the defendant. Quanta, 128 S. Ct. at 2121-22. There was no allegation
that Intel had failed to pay royalties to LG, and there certainly was no finding that Intel’s sales of
the licensed products were unauthorized. Thus, Quanta’s application of patent exhaustion was
limited to authorized downstream sales.

Unlike Quanta, this case concerns unauthorized

downstream sales. Therefore, Quanta supports Philips’ position that Concord’s motion should
be denied. Quanta expressly recognizes that unauthorized sales — such as those present here —
do not trigger patent exhaustion. Id. at 2122.
Moreover, the Supreme Court’s analysis in Quanta contradicts Concord’s broad
allegation that the mere existence of a license between Philips and Music City establishes
authorized sales. If Concord were correct, the Supreme Court would have had no reason to

7

Case 7:08-cv-04068-CS-GAY

Page 8 of 10

analyze the license agreements at issue in Quanta. Instead, the Court would have ended its
inquiry and based its finding of exhaustion on the mere fact that the plaintiff had licensed its
patent portfolio to another party. That, of course, is not how Quanta played out. Quanta
specifically inquired as to whether the sales under the license were authorized. Id. When taken
as true, as the law requires, Philips’ allegations establish that the downstream CD sales from the
Defendant licensees are unauthorized, and that as the patentee, Philips can sue both the licensees
and their customers, including Concord, for patent infringement.
C.

Music City Is Licensed for Other Products and Patents

The license agreement between Philips and Concord’s supplier, Music City, covers many
CD-Disc products and many patents, as described in the First Amended Complaint (FAC ¶ 58).
Only certain types of CD-Discs covered by such license are the subject of the present action (see
FAC ¶ 64, 68, 72). Music City does not appear to be breaching the license agreement for other
products or patents. Thus, Music City is in material breach of its license for some products, but
not for others, and therefore Philips has not terminated the license. This situation highlights the
reason why patent exhaustion cannot turn on whether or not a license agreement has been
terminated. As discussed above, the key inquiry is whether the licensee’s sales are unauthorized,
based on a material breach of the license. Philips has alleged that Music City has materially
breached its license and that the CD-Discs it makes and sells are unauthorized and therefore
infringing. These allegations must be accepted as true for this motion, and therefore the patent
exhaustion doctrine does not apply.
III.

CONCLUSION
For these reasons, Philips respectfully urges this Court to deny Concord’s Motion to

Dismiss.
