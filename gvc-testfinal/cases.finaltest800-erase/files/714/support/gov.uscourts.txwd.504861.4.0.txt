DEFENDANTS' PARTIAL MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULE 12(B)(6)

 

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

Defendants, ECS Telecom Services, LLC, Edward C. Skoog, Blanca S. Skoog, Rockie
Rish and Danny Miller, by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby file their Partial
- Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and respectfully show the following:

I.
INTRODUCTION

1, Plaintiffs filed their Original Complaint on August 24, 2011 alleging violations of
the Anti-Retaliation Provision and Overtime Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

of 1938.

 

 
Case 5:11-cv-00700-XR Document 4 Filed 09/15/11 Page 2 of 10

2. This motion only addresses Plaintiffs' Count II, Violations of the Overtime
Provision Claim, brought by Plaintiffs individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated.

3. On August 25, 2011, Plaintiffs served Defendants with the Original Complaint
(hereinafter "Complaint").

4, Defendants file this motion as their responsive pleading within twenty-one (21)
days of service.

5. Plaintiffs' Complaint does not provide specific factual allegations regarding the
overtime provisions claim alleged by all Plaintiffs and others similarly situated. The Complaint
fails to provide specific factual allegations concerning dates of employment, specific job

titles/positions, specific job duties, the common policy complained of, the number of overtime

hours allegedly worked and/or owed, specific descriptions of willful actions or specific

descriptions of how each Plaintiff was compensated.

6. The non-conclusory factual allegations, as opposed to legal conclusions, even if
taken as true, do not set forth a plausible claim for relief as required by the United States
Supreme Court in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft y. Iqbal,
129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009).

Il.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

7. Plaintiffs' Complaint can accurately be described as a "shotgun" pleading. It does
not contain sufficient factual allegations to state a claim upon which relief may be granted;
instead, it largely consists of legal conclusions and conclusory factual allegations which mirror

the statutory language.

Page 2 of 8

 
Case 5:11-cv-00700-XR Document4 Filed 09/15/11 Page 3 of 10

8. The first twenty-one (21) paragraphs of the Complaint consist of information
regarding parties, jurisdiction and venue. Plaintiffs' first proffer of facts appears in paragraphs
22-23, which contain the following conclusory general factual allegations:

The individual Plaintiffs Gregory D. Traub, Lars Kallas, Andres Hernandez, Israel

Soliz, Matthew Monk, Jerome Gonzales, Luis Villareal, and Moses Roozco! [sic],

and all other similarly situated employees did not receive overtime compensation

accumulated throughout their employment at ECS TELECOM SERVICES LLC.

Plaintiffs and all other similarly situated employees who worked an average of

sixteen (16) hours a day for five (5) to seven (7) days a week were only being

compensated for their base salary. Although Plaintiffs and all other similarly
situated employees were entitled to two (2) days off a week, Defendants still often
instructed them to work on their designated day-offs [sic]. However, overtime

wages and accumulated days-off [sic] were never fully compensated by

Defendants.

Plaintiffs then proceed to describe the collective class facts and allegations in paragraphs 24-31
using boilerplate statutory language, but offer no further specific factual allegations.

9. Plaintiffs' cause of action for FLSA Overtime Requirements claims was brought
by all Plaintiffs and on behalf of all others similarly situated. The allegations set forth under
Count II, paragraphs 36-44, merely recite the statutory language, elements of Plaintiffs' cause of
action, legal conclusions, and demands for relief. Plaintiffs only semblance of factual support
for its claim appears in paragraphs 22-23 however, those paragraphs consist of more legal
conclusions and a very generalized statement concerning average hours worked. Supra.

10. _- Plaintiffs fail to describe the facts of each individual's employment with adequate
specificity. For example, they do not describe dates of employment, specific job titles/positions,
specific job duties, the common policy complained of, the number of overtime hours allegedly

worked and/or owed or specific descriptions of how each Plaintiff was compensated. They .

further fail to describe the facts supporting their allegation that Defendants' willfully violated the

 

' Moses Roozco [sic] is identified as a Plaintiff for the first time in paragraph 22. Mr. Roozco [sic] does not appear
in the caption or paragraphs 10-16 of the Complaint in which the Plaintiffs are identified by name and address,

Page 3 of 8

 
Case 5:11-cv-00700-XR Document4 Filed 09/15/11 Page 4 of 10

FLSA. See Complaint, at para. 42. As Plaintiffs consist of seven (or eight) individuals,
notwithstanding the collective class, they should in the very least provide individualized fact
specific allegations that entitle them to an FLSA Overtime Requirements claim.

III.
ANALYSIS

A. Applicable Legal Standard

11. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), if a complaint fails to state a
claim upon which relief may be granted, a court is entitled to dismiss the complaint as a matter
of law. All factual allegations in the complaint should be taken as true; however, mere labels
and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements will not suffice. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at

1949; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see also Promotional Mgmt. Group v. Hsieh, No. SA-09-CV-

 

367-XR, 2009 WL 2849630, at *2 (W.D. Texas Sept. 1, 2009) ((citing Fernandez-Montez v.
Allied Pilots Assoc., 987 F.2d 278, 284 (Sth Cir. 1993) (stating in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
dismiss, all factual allegations recited in the complaint should be taken as true)). Moreover, a

GOOG

complaint is insufficient if it asserts "`naked assertions' devoid of `further factual
enhancement.'" Iqbal, 129 S. Ct: at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). While Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires the complaint to contain a "short and plain statement of
the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief" it also demands more than an "unadorned,
the-defendant unlawfully-harmed me accusation." Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing Twombly,
550 U.S. at 555).

12. In Iqbal, the United States Supreme Court applied the underlying principles in
Twombly to mandate a two-pronged approach to analyzing whether a pleading will survive a

motion to dismiss. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-1950. First, the court must identify and disregard

conclusory legal allegations which are not entitled to an assumption of truth. Id. at 1949-1950.

Page 4 of 8

 
Case 5:11-cv-00700-XR Document 4 _ Filed 09/15/11 Page 5 of 10

Second, after setting aside conclusory legal allegations, the Court must consider whether the
factual allegations plausibly suggest a claim for relief. Id. at 1950.

13. In examining the first prong, the Supreme Court stated "[t]hreadbare recitals of
the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id.
at 1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Furthermore, unlike factual allegations in a
complaint, a court is not obligated to accept as true a legal conclusion disguised as a factual
allegation. Id. at 1950. The Supreme Court also notes Rule 8 "does not unlock the doors of
discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions." Id. (citing Twombly, 550
USS at 556).

14. The second prong-the plausibility standard-requires that a complaint show a
claim for relief from which more than a mere possibility of misconduct can be inferred. Iqbal,
129 S.Ct. at 1950. Plaintiffs must "[nudge] their claims across the line from conceivable to
plausible" in order to avoid dismissal. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.

B. Plaintiffs' Claims Do Not Allege Sufficient Facts to State a Plausible Claim for
Relief.

15. Plaintiffs' Complaint cannot survive a motion to dismiss under the Twombly and
Iqbal standard. Plaintiffs' cause of action merely set forth formulaic legal elements and
conclusory allegations without substantiating them with non-conclusory facts.

16. In examining Plaintiffs' claims for Violations of the FLSA Overtime
Requirements (Count II), brought both individually and as part of a collective class, Plaintiffs
advance no more than a formulaic recitation of the elements and demand for damages in
paragraphs 36-44 of the Complaint. The most Plaintiffs allege in terms of factual support

appears in paragraph 23 of the Complaint which makes a general statement regarding the number

Page 5 of 8

 
Case 5:11-cv-00700-XR Document4 Filed 09/15/11 Page 6 of 10

of hours worked in regards to all seven (or eight) named Plaintiffs as well as all others similarly
situated. Supra. While collective actions can rest on more generalized pleadings, a complaint
should assert more specific facts about the individually named Plaintiff, if not about the entire

class. Mell v. GNC Corp. et al., No. 10-945, 2010 WL 4668966, at *7-8 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 9,

 

2010) (quoting Deleon v. Time Warner Cable, No. 09-2438, 2009 U.S. Dist. Lexis 74345, at *7

 

(C.D. Cal. July 17, 2009)).

17. In the case at bar, Plaintiffs fail to provide a breakdown for each individual
- regarding dates of employment, specific job titles/positions, specific job duties, the common
policy complained of, the number of overtime hours allegedly worked and/or owed or specific
descriptions of how each Plaintiff was compensated. Additionally, there is no explanation of
what willful conduct Plaintiffs are resting their claim on. Plaintiffs' overtime claims are
essentially the threadbare recitation of elements supported by conclusory facts against which the
Supreme Court cautioned. See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S at 555).
Thus, the Complaint fails to provide Defendants with notice of the circumstances under which
the alleged violations occurred. See Solis v. Time Warner Cable San Antonio, No. 10-CA-0231
XR, 2010 WL 2756800, at *1 (W.D. Tex. July `13, 2010) (stating that unlike original complaint,
amended complaint identified the employees related to the claim, job duties, job titles, and how
they were paid, and therefore survived the motion to dismiss). See also Mell at *7-8. (dismissing
an FLSA Overtime claim which was light on factual support regarding the amount and dates of
overtime hours worked, the specifics of the alleged employer policy, and a general allegation of
willful conduct on the part of the Defendants).

18. Without the requisite basic factual allegations, Plaintiffs' Overtime Provisions

Claim does not infer more than a mere possibility of misconduct. Plaintiffs have not "nudged"

Page 6 of 8

 
Case 5:11-cv-00700-XR Document 4 _ Filed 09/15/11 Page 7 of 10

their claims from conceivable to plausible. Therefore, Defendants motion to dismiss should be

granted.

IV.
CONCLUSION

19. For the reasons stated above, Defendants respectfully request that Count II of
Plaintiffs' Original Complaint be dismissed with prejudice for failing to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted, that Defendants be awarded attorneys' fees and cost incurred in bringing
their motion, and for all other relief, at law or in equity, which the Court deems appropriate.
