PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ PARTIAL MOTION TO DISMISS
PURUSANT TO RULE 12(b)(6)

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

COME

GREGORY

D.

TRAUB,

LARS

KALLAS,

ANDRES

HERNANDEZ, ISRAEL SOLIZ, MATTHEW MONK, JEROME GONZALES, and LUIS
VILLARREAL,1 Individually and on behalf of others similar situated individuals (“Plaintiff,
Plaintiffs” or Class members”), responding to Defendants’ Partial Motion to Dismiss
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), and would respectfully show unto the Court as follows:
1

Defendants’ Partial Motion to Dismiss references an individual by the name of “Moses Roozco.” This
individual is not a party-plaintiff and, to the extent that there is any confusion in this regard, Plaintiffs are
willing to amend their Complaint to delete any reference to this person.

1

PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY
1.

Plaintiffs filed and served Defendants with their Original Complaint on

August 24, 2011.

In their Complaint, Plaintiffs brought suit against Defendants for

violations of anti-retaliation and overtime requirements provisions under the Federal Labor
Standards Act (“FLSA”) of 1938.
2.

Defendants, in response to Plaintiffs’ Original Complaint, filed a Partial

Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to 12(b)(6), alleging that Plaintiffs’ Count II, setting forth
Defendants’ violation of the overtime requirements provision of the FLSA, does not provide
sufficient notice of the causes of action asserted and/or relief sought by Plaintiffs. In
particular, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss repeatedly states that Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails
to set forth “dates of employment, specific job titles/positions, specific job duties, the
common policy complained of, the number of overtime hours allegedly worked and/or owed
or specific allegations of how each Plaintiff was compensated.”
3.

Defendant ECS Telecom Services LLC is a family owned business with,

upon information and belief, approximately fifteen (15) employees. Edward C. Skoog and
his wife, Blanca S. Skoog, are the individual owners. Rockie Rish and Danny Miller are
managerial employees of the Company.
4.

Given the number of employees at ECS Telecom Services LLC, as well as

the fact that it is a closely held “mom and pop” business, it seems highly unlikely that
Defendants are not already fully aware of who the Plaintiffs are, the terms and conditions of
their employment with ECS Telecom Services LLC, their prior complaints regarding the
failure by the Company to pay them overtime wages as was the industry standard, and the
factual substance of their current claims.

2

5.

Defendants further assert that Plaintiffs’ Original Complaint fails to identify

the common policy complained of by Plaintiffs, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiffs
repeatedly state in their Complaint that it is Defendants’ “policy and practice … to deny
earned wages and overtime pay to the employees” in violation of the FLSA. Regardless,
when Plaintiffs’ Original Complaint is compared with governing authorities setting forth the
requirements for pleading such claims, it is clear that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is, at
best, without merit.
6.

Finally, it should be noted that, prior to filing their Motion to Dismiss,

Defendants’ counsel failed to ever confer with counsel for Plaintiffs regarding the substance
of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Defendants also fail to specify who their attorney in
charge is, as required by the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the Western
District of Texas.
ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
7.

In reviewing a Motion to Dismiss, the court must interpret the complaint in

favor of the plaintiff, and accept all well-pleaded facts to be true. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556
U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009); Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics
Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 164 (1993); Public Health Equip. &
Supply, Inc. v. Clarke Mosquito Control Products, 410 Fed. Appx.738, 740 (5th Cir. Tex.
2010).
Plaintiffs’ Complaint Provides Sufficient Notice of the Claims Asserted and the
Factual Bases for Such Claims
8.

As this Court is aware, Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

requires only “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to

3

relief.” FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). This basic pleading standard applies to all civil actions, with
limited and specific limitations. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 513 (2002).
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set forth specific,
detailed facts on which he bases his claim in his pleading. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154,
168 (1997); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). The basic
requirements of the “plain statement” are to give the defendant a fair notice of the
plaintiff’s claim, and the grounds upon which the claim rests. Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at
509. This basic “notice-pleading standard” was adopted to help ensure the focus of
litigation would be on the merits of a claim, and is applicable in most civil actions.
Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510. The “notice-pleading standard” relies on liberal discovery
rules and summary judgment motions to weed out unmeritorious claims. Id. Under the
simplified “notice-pleading standard,” a court may dismiss a claim only if it is clear that
relief cannot be granted under a set of facts consistent with the allegations. Id at 514;
Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984).
9.

In the present matter, Plaintiffs’ Original Complaint contains the required

plain and short statement specifying the claims against defendants, as well as identifies
the relief sought from the misconduct of the defendants, therefore, meeting the
requirement set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In addition, Plaintiffs’
Original Complaint has included supplemental information that properly and adequately
supports their claims against defendants, and the grounds upon which they rest.

4

Although No Heightened Pleading Standard Applies to Plaintiffs’ Claims, Plaintiffs’
Complaint Nonetheless Contains Sufficient Factual Allegations to Overcome a Rule
12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss
10.

To be considered “well-pleaded,” a complaint must contain some factual

allegations to give rise to a right to relief above a speculative level. Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937,
1949 (2009). The courts require enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on
its face. Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. at 558; Iqbal, 556 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. at 1949; Public
Health Equip. & Supply, Inc. v. Clarke Mosquito Control Products, 410 Fed. Appx. 738,
740 (5th Cir. Tex. 2010). To be facially plausible, the Plaintiff must plead content that
permits the court to draw the implication that the defendant is liable for the misconduct
alleged in the complaint. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950. When there are well-pleaded factual
allegations, the court should assume their truth, and determine whether the allegations are
facially plausible to give rise to an entitlement of relief Id. at 1941.
11.

The complaint must show more than mere possibility of misconduct. Id.

The complaint does not need to plead specific facts beyond what is necessary to state a
claim, and for entitlement to relief. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002). A
complaint is considered well-pleaded even if it appears that recovery is unlikely. Bell Atl.
Corp., 550 U.S. at 556. The court must interpret a complaint most favorable to the
plaintiff. Public Health Equip. & Supply, Inc. v. Clarke Mosquito Control Products, 410
Fed. Appx. 738, 740 (5th Cir. Tex. 2010).

Furthermore, requiring a higher standard of

specificity for certain claims can only be done through amending the Federal Rules of

5

Civil Procedure, not by judicial interpretation. Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544 (2007); Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002).
12.

In light of the foregoing, it is clear that Plaintiffs’ Complaint is sufficient

to place Defendants on fair notice of the underlying facts giving rise to their claims, as
well as the legal bases for such claims. Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss be denied.
PRAYER
For the aforementioned reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully asks that this court deny
Defendants’ Partial Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and for such other and
further relief to which this Court finds Plaintiffs justly entitled.

Respectfully submitted,

By:
