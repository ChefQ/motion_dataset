(Death Penalty Case)

PETITIONER ROBERT GENE WILL, II’s EXPEDITED MOTION TO STAY AND
HOLD PROCEEDINGS IN ABEYANCE
Petitioner Robert Gene Will, II respectfully asks this Court to stay the proceedings in this
case and hold them in abeyance so that he may pursue newly discovered, unexhausted claims in
state court. Documents belatedly produced by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office have
led to the discovery of new testimony further implicating alternative suspect Michael Alan
Rosario. Despite having these documents with information crucial to Mr. Will’s defense, the
State of Texas failed to turn them over before trial as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.
83 (1963). Petitioner intends to file a habeas petition in Texas state court to pursue his newly
discovered Brady and actual innocence claims before September 1, 2013 and is required by
Texas law to secure a stay in this Court before he may do so.
I.

BACKGROUND

Since his arrest on December 4, 2000, Mr. Will has steadfastly maintained that he is
innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. Mr. Will has consistently asserted that

Case 4:07-cv-01000 Document 133 Filed in TXSD on 08/07/13 Page 2 of 54

Michael Rosario killed Deputy Barrett Hill. In past orders, this Court has lamented the “strict
limitations” placed upon it by federal law and urged the State of Texas to “exercise restraint” in
the execution of Mr. Will’s sentence in light of the “grave” errors at his trial and the
“considerable evidence supporting Will’s innocence.” Dkt. 88, at 19-20. Since this Court
expressed such doubts about Mr. Will’s guilt, counsel has discovered additional new exculpatory
evidence never before disclosed to Mr. Will’s prior attorneys. See Exs. 5, 9, 10 (affidavits of
trial and state habeas counsel).
In September 2012, federal habeas counsel Samy Khalil was provided a document by the
District Attorney which states that Michael Rosario was placed into administrative separation in
the Harris County Jail after Deputy Hill’s murder because Rosario solicited inmate David Cruz
and the Texas Syndicate prison gang to “make [a] hit on co-def. Robt. Will.” See Ex. 1. The
State never disclosed this document to Mr. Will’s trial attorneys. See Exs. 9, 10 (affidavits of
trial counsel Anthony Osso and David Cunningham). The discovery of this document led to the
recent, sworn affidavit of David Cruz, which confirms that Rosario asked Cruz to “get the Texas
Syndicate to do a ‘hit’ on Will.” See Ex. 2. In the affidavit, Cruz further explains that Rosario
confessed to the murder and told Cruz he planned to “blame Will.” See id.
The State’s suppression of this evidence, precluding Mr. Will’s counsel from presenting
it to the jury, violates Mr. Will’s federal constitutional rights. Under federal law, Mr. Will must
exhaust any new claims in Texas state court prior to raising them in federal court, 28 U.S.C.
§ 2254(b)(1), and must do so before the 1-year statute of limitations has run. 28 U.S.C.
§ 2244(d)(1). Under Texas law, Mr. Will is unable to exhaust his new claims unless and until
this Court issues a stay. See Ex parte Soffar, 143 S.W. 3d 804, 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).
Accordingly, Mr. Will asks this Court to stay and hold in abeyance the federal proceedings
2

Case 4:07-cv-01000 Document 133 Filed in TXSD on 08/07/13 Page 3 of 54

herein to permit him to file a subsequent application for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals and raise these claims before the federal statute of limitations expires.
II.

This Newly Discovered Evidence Shows that Mr. Will is Entitled to a New Trial
The State withheld favorable, material evidence from the defense before trial in violation

of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Among documents never produced was Michael
Rosario’s prison “Administrative Separation Review Sheet” dated December 5, 2000 (the day
after the shooting) which states that Rosario “made contact w/ [prison officials in the Disruptive
Group Unit] to visit w/ David Cruz [Texas Syndicate affiliate] soliciting [the Texas Syndicate] to
make hit on co-def. Robt. Will.” See Ex. 1. Another document not disclosed to defense counsel
reveals that only days after Deputy Hill’s murder, Rosario admitted to Harris County Sheriff’s
Deputy Patricia Schifani that he was “part of the reason” Deputy Hill was murdered. See Ex. 3
(“Schifani Report”). These documents were produced by the District Attorney to federal habeas
counsel, Samy Khalil, in early September 2012.
Discovery of these documents has led to the new testimony of Mr. Rosario’s would-be
hitman, David Cruz. Mr. Cruz has provided a sworn affidavit stating that Rosario not only
solicited Mr. Will’s murder from the Texas Syndicate, but also confessed to shooting Deputy
Hill during a trip back from court with Rosario. See Ex. 2. The prison records of Michael
Rosario and David Cruz confirm that the two inmates were housed in the same jail on
December 5, 2000 and attended several court proceedings together in the Spring of 2001. All of
this previously undisclosed evidence adds to mounting evidence that Michael Rosario, not
Robert Will, committed the murder for which Mr. Will was condemned to death. Mr. Will now
seeks to bring claims of actual innocence and violation of due process under Brady based on this
newly discovered evidence.

III.

This Court Should Issue a Stay to Allow for State Review of Mr. Will’s Claims
A.

A Stay and Abeyance Is Necessary in this Case

Although Texas law permits a petitioner to file a successive state habeas petition, see
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 11.071, § 5(a)(2), it also requires that this Court issue a stay before a
Texas court will review Mr. Will’s claims. State law prohibits Texas courts from considering a
prisoner’s habeas application if the prisoner has a habeas petition pending in federal court related
to the same conviction. Soffar, 143 S.W. 3d at 805. In Soffar, the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals (T.C.C.A.) dismissed a subsequent state habeas application “because no federal court
ha[d] entered an order staying all proceedings in applicant’s pending parallel federal writ.” Id. at
807. A “parallel writ” is one “that relates to the same conviction or same matter.” See id. at 805
(citing Ex parte Powers, 487 S.W.2d 101 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972)) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Thus, under Texas law any subsequent state habeas application Mr. Will submits
would be subject to dismissal unless this Court issues a stay and abeyance. See id. at 807 (The
T.C.C.A. will “permit consideration of the merits of a subsequent writ . . . if the federal court
having jurisdiction over a parallel writ enters an order staying all of its proceedings for the
applicant to return to the appropriate Texas court to exhaust his state remedies.”); see, e.g., Ex
parte Murphy, No. WR-70,832-02, 2010 WL 3905152, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 6, 2010)
(“The record reflects that Applicant is currently challenging his conviction . . . in the United
States District Court . . . [and] that the federal district court has entered an order staying its
proceedings for Applicant to return to state court to consider his current unexhausted claims.
Therefore, this Court may exercise jurisdiction to consider this subsequent state application.”).
While state law prohibits Texas courts from reviewing Mr. Will’s new claims without a
stay from this Court, federal law prohibits this Court from granting Mr. Will federal habeas relief

4

Case 4:07-cv-01000 Document 133 Filed in TXSD on 08/07/13 Page 5 of 54

unless and until his claims have been exhausted in state court. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b); see Ex. 4,
Trevino v. Quarterman, No. 5:01-cv-00306-XR (W.D. TX filed Aug. 2, 2006) (order granting
motion to hold habeas petition in abeyance so petitioner could to return to state court and exhaust
Brady claim). Accordingly, no court currently may grant Mr. Will habeas relief pursuant to his
newly discovered constitutional claims until a stay is issued by this Court.
B.

A Stay and Abeyance Is Appropriate in this Case

District courts have discretion to stay federal habeas proceedings and hold them in
abeyance while a petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his state remedies. Rhines v. Weber,
544 U.S. 269, 277 (2005). A stay and abeyance is appropriate where: “(1) the petitioner has
good cause for failure to exhaust his claim, (2) the claim is not plainly meritless, and (3) the
petitioner has not engaged in intentional delay.” Schillereff v. Quarterman, 304 F. App’x 310,
314 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Rhines, 544 U.S. at 277-78).
A stay and abeyance is appropriate in this case. First, the factual basis for Mr. Will’s
new claims could not have been presented to the state courts in a prior state habeas application
because the State had never produced the evidence underlying those claims to any of Mr. Will’s
prior attorneys. See Exs. 5, 9, 10. Before Mr. Will’s trial, defense counsel made several Brady
requests that should have turned up state records related to Rosario’s attempted “hit” on Mr. Will
as well as the Schifani report. See id. In addition to the Brady requests, counsel also issued two
subpoenas to the Harris County Sheriff’s Disruptive Group Unit (DGU). See Exs. 6, 7. The
subpoenas specifically requested:

5

Case 4:07-cv-01000 Document 133 Filed in TXSD on 08/07/13 Page 6 of 54

[A] complete copy of any and all records relating to any interviews regarding
inmates Robert Gene Will II, Alan Michael Rosario or any other inmates
concerning the death of Deputy Barrett Hill. These records shall include any and
all information obtained from any source which directly or indirectly suggests that
an individual other than defendant Robert Gene Will II shot Deputy Barrett Hill.
Id.
In an effort seek compliance with the subpoena, Mr. Will’s trial counsel called Harris
County Jail Deputy Bobby Strickland to testify in a pre-trial hearing about the Sheriff’s lack of
any response to the subpoenas. Ex. 11, Trial Tr. Vol. 3, at 6-7; see Exs 9, 10. In answering
defense counsel’s questions, Deputy Strickland testified that “I have nothing pertaining to his
[Rob Will’s] case.” Ex. 11, at 10. Strickland, whose job it was to stay apprised of gang-related
activity and impose administrative separation of inmates to maintain security, refused to produce
jail records that could contain information that he considered “confidential.” See id. at 14-15.
Strickland explained that any informants he spoke to were speaking “on a confidential record.”
See id. The Harris County Jail Administrative Review Sheet containing evidence of the “hit”
was never produced to trial counsel in response to these subpoenas or at any other time. See Exs.
9, 10 (affidavits of trial counsel Anthony Osso and David Cunningham).
The suppressed records were also not available to Mr. Will’s state habeas counsel Leslie
Ribnik. Mr. Ribnik’s sworn affidavit states that he had never seen either of the two documents at
issue until recently despite extensive review of the District Attorney’s files. See Ex. 5.
Nor were the records available to previous federal habeas counsel. The State failed to
produce either document despite a subpoena issued by former federal habeas counsel under the
authority of this Court in March 2009 to the Harris County Sherriff’s Department for all of
Michael Rosario’s inmate records. See Ex. 8.

6

Case 4:07-cv-01000 Document 133 Filed in TXSD on 08/07/13 Page 7 of 54

Second, Mr. Will’s constitutional claims are not “plainly meritless.”

In Brady v.

Maryland, the Supreme Court held that suppression of material exculpatory evidence by the
prosecution, whether deliberate or inadvertent, violates due process.

373 U.S. at 86-87.

Evidence is material for purposes of a Brady claim when there is a “reasonable probability” that
the result at trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed. Banks v. Dretke,
540 U.S. 668, 698-99 (2004). The new evidence suppressed by the State shows that Michael
Rosario attempted to kill his childhood friend Rob Will because he feared Will would expose
him as the shooter in Deputy Hill’s murder. See Exs. 1, 2. The suppressed evidence also
indicates that Rosario confessed to being the shooter, boasting to both David Cruz and Deputy
Schifani that he believed he was untouchable because his father was a police officer. See Exs. 2,
3.
Because the State withheld this evidence, its case was much stronger and the defense case
was much weaker than the full facts would have suggested. See Exs. 9, 10. The State’s
suppression of this exculpatory evidence allowed its prosecutors to close their case by posing the
following questions to the jury: “[Are Rosario’s actions] the actions of somebody who has just
executed one of the finest people in this world? . . . [A]re those the actions of somebody who’s
just killed a police officer . . . ?” Ex. 12, Trial Tr. Vol. 26, at 151-52. The State could make this
argument only because it had suppressed all incriminating evidence of what Rosario actually did
after Deputy Hill’s murder -- attempt to kill the only other eyewitness to the shooting, Rob Will.
With this new evidence in hand, the defense would have had questions of its own for the jury: If
Rosario was innocent, why did Rosario try to kill Rob Will? If Rosario had nothing to do with
Deputy Hill’s murder and was hiding in the brush when it happened, as the State contended, why
did he feel the need to have his childhood friend murdered? Had the defense been able to present
7

Case 4:07-cv-01000 Document 133 Filed in TXSD on 08/07/13 Page 8 of 54

Mr. Cruz’s new testimony about Rosario’s attempted “hit” and the confirmatory prison report,
there is a reasonable probability that such evidence would have turned the tide in an already
close and contentious trial. See Exs. 9, 10; Dkt. 88, at 19 (“only circumstantial evidence
support[s] Will’s conviction and death sentence”); c.f. Wolfe v. Clarke, 819 F. Supp. 2d 538,
551-52 (E.D. Va. 2011) (finding Brady violation where police suppressed information of a
“hit”).
Third, a stay in this matter is not being sought for purposes of delay, nor is it a matter of
convenience for Mr. Will or his counsel. Rather, Texas law requires it. Further, this motion was
filed only days after petitioner’s counsel was able to obtain Mr. Cruz’s sworn affidavit and the
affidavits of his trial and state habeas counsel. See Exs. 2, 5, 9, 10. Lastly, undersigned counsel
represent that we will file a state habeas petition without delay by September 1, 2013.
In sum, Mr. Will asks this Court to stay the proceedings in his case and hold them in
abeyance so that he may exhaust state court remedies.
