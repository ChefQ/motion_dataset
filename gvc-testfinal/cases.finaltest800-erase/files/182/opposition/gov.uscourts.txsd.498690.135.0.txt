CIVIL ACTION 4:07-cv-1000
**CAPITAL LITIGANT**
Hon. Keith P. Ellison

AGREED ADVISORY AND PROPOSED SCHEDULE FOR BRIEFING
This action involves a habeas corpus case brought by a Texas state prisoner who was
convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.
Will and the Director propose that this Court stay and abate these federal habeas proceedings
so that Will may return to state court to exhaust and develop his new Brady claim. The Director
withdraws his previous objection to Will’s motion to stay and abate, on the agreed condition that
Will files his state writ within sixty days of the order staying this proceeding, and that within thirty
days of a final ruling by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, if necessary he would return to
reinstitute proceedings in this Court.
Will and the Director hope that this advisory will obviate the need for the hearing currently
set for August 21, 2013 and enable this Court to utilize its resources more effectively.

The previous named respondent in this action was Rick Thaler. This year, William

Institutions Division. Under Rule 25(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 43
(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Stephens “is automatically substituted as a party.”
