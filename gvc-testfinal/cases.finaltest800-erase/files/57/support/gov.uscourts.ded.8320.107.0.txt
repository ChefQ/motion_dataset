ALCON'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND ITS ANSWER

Defendants, Alcon Inc., Alcon Laboratories, Inc., and Alcon Research Ltd. (collectively
"Alcon"), respectfully submit this motion for leave to amend their Answer pursuant to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). In accordance with Local Rule 15.1, Alcon's proposed First
Amended Answer and one copy thereof are attached hereto as Exhibit A. A copy of the
proposed First Amended Answer indicating how it differs from Alcon's original Answer is
attached hereto as Exhibit B. Alcon waives an opening brief in support of its motion, relying on
the argument contained herein. The changes brought about by the proposed Amended Answer
include the addition of the following affirmative defenses and counterclaims: (1)
unenforceability of the '834 patent for inequitable conduct; (2) unenforceability of the 337
patent for inequitable conduct; (3) unenforceability of the 834 and/or '337 patents for unclean

hands; and (4) invalidity of the '834 patent for the misjoinder of an inventor(s).

Rule 15(a) mandates that leave to amend a pleading "shall be freely given when justice so
requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). "[T]his mandate is to be heeded." Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S.
178, 182 (1962).

In the absence of any apparent or declared reason - such as undue
delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,
repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously
allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of

allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc. - the
leave sought should, as the rules require, be "freely given."

Id.; see also Inre Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (rd Cir. 1997)
(following Foman).

On June 23 and 24, 2005, Alcon deposed the first-named inventor on the two patents-in-
suit, Orest Olejnik, Ph.D. Based on concessions made at that deposition, it became apparent that
Allergan orchestrated an elaborate scheme to defraud the United States Patent and Trademark
Office during the prosecution of the patents-in-suit. The means by which this scheme was
accomplished are pleaded with particularity in the proposed Amended Answer, but includes, in
respect of both asserted patents, material misrepresentations and omissions concerning the
testing of various compositions in connection with declarations submitted to the PTO to
overcome obviousness rejections based on purportedly "unexpected results." See Purdue
Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharm. Inc., 410 F.3d 690 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (patent held unenforceable for
inequitable conduct based on patentees' misleading declaration of "surprising results," which
implied the existence of testing that had not been performed.)

On July 20, 2005, Alcon deposed Carlos Fisher, Esq., the former in-house Allergan
patent attorney responsible for the prosecution of the patents-in-suit. At that deposition,
Allergan refused to offer any explanation inconsistent with the inference of fraud for certain

arguments made to the PTO by Mr. Fisher that were intended to mislead the Examiner to believe

Case 1:04-cv-00968-GMS Document 107 Filed 07/25/05 Page 3 of 6 PagelD #: 2084

that compositions claimed in the parent application were novel, when Allergan knew that they
were not. Alcon believes that the factual record developed to date is sufficient to render the
patents-in-suit unenforceable by virtue of Allergan's inequitable conduct during prosecution of
the patents-in-suit and related applications. Additional discovery is being sought which may
provide further evidence of Allergan's breach of its duty of candor, the materiality of the
breaches at issue, and Allergan's fraudulent intent.

Similarly, Alcon has discovered that the inventorship of United States Patent No.
6,641,834 ("the 0x00B0834 patent") is highly suspect. When both named inventors of the '834 patent-
in-suit (Drs. Olejnik and Kerslake) were questioned about the claims' "0.15% (w/v)" limitation,
neither took credit for that critical aspect of the invention. This adds to the mystery that already
exists with respect to the 0.15% limitation - a limitation utterly absent from the specification and
inappropriately added late in prosecution. While Alcon continues to seek discovery regarding
the conception of the alleged invention, it appears from the record developed to date that the
inventorship of the 834 is improper.

Allergan will not be prejudiced by the Court granting Alcon leave to amend. Allergan
needs no discovery with respect to its own conduct before the United States Patent and
Trademark Office and no discovery with regard to the inventorship on the '834 patent.
Moreover, even if Allergan needs to gather any information, several weeks of fact discovery
remain in this case, expert discovery has not yet begun, and the scheduled trial date is many
months away.

The grant of Alcon's motion would be consistent with sound public policy. "The far-
reaching social and economic consequences of a patent . . . give the public a paramount interest
in seeing that patent monopolies spring from backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable

conduct and that such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope." Precision Instrument

Mfg. Co. v. Auto. Maint. Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 816 (1945). Consequently, courts often grant

leave to add the defense of inequitable conduct. See, e.g., Lucent Tech., Inc. v. Extreme

Networks, Inc., No. 03-508 JJF (D. Del. Jan. 12, 2005) (order granting motion to file amended

answer and counterclaims adding inequitable conduct allegation); Enzo Life Sci., Inc. v. Digene

Corp., 270 F. Supp. 2d 484, 490 (D. Del. 2003) (granting motion to file amended answer adding

inequitable conduct allegation); see also Thompson-Hayward Chem. Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co.,

745 F.2d 27, 33 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (recognizing strong public interest in enforcing adherence to the

duty of candor in the Patent Office).

For at least the foregoing reasons, and those identified in Alcon's proposed Amended

Answer, Alcon respectfully requests that the Court grant Alcon's Motion For Leave to Amend

Its Answer.
