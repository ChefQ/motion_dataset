ALCON'S RESPONSE TO ALLERGAN'S PROVISIONAL
MOTION TO AMEND THE SCHEDULING ORDER

Defendants Alcon, Inc., Alcon Laboratories, Inc., and Alcon Research, Ltd. (together,
"Alcon") submit this response in opposition to the "provisional motion" to amend the Scheduling
Order filed by Allergan, Inc. and Allergan Sales, LLC (together, "Allergan"). (D.I. 117.)'

Allergan's "provisional motion" is premature on its face, and its arguments reflect that it
is primarily a vehicle intended to provide Allergan with a mechanism for putting in the "last
word" on Alcon's pending motion for leave to amend its answer. (D.I. 107.) Briefing on that

motion is complete, and should not be continued under the guise of a "provisional motion."

 

Allergan's Provisional Motion to Amend the Scheduling Order was filed electronically

on August 9, 2005, and was not served by hand. Accordingly, this statement has been filed
within the time prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e) and section E(5) of the Court's February 8,
2005 order, regarding electronic case filing policies and procedures, the effect of which extended
Alcon's time to file this statement until and including, August 26, 2005.

Accordingly, the Court should deny Allergan's motion as premature and improper.

Plaintiffs' "provisional motion" is meritless for two additional reasons. First, Allergan
already possesses complete knowledge of why it chose to make the misleading arguments it
made to the PTO, why it failed to disclose the prior art references identified in the proposed
amended answer, and why it identified Drs. Olejnik and Kerslake as the inventors of the late-
added claims concerning 0.15% brimonidine tartrate, despite neither even possessing knowledge
of the genesis of that alleged invention. These facts only became known to Alcon through
discovery, but are all inherently within the knowledge of Allergan. Thus, discovery of Alcon is
not needed for Allergan to defend against the new matters raised in the proposed amended
answer. Second, even if some discovery were required, there is no need to alter the trial schedule
in this case, as would be the effect of Allergan's motion. Alcon's summary judgment motion is
fully briefed and pending; Allergan has elected not to file any summary judgment motion; and
the next court date on the Scheduling Order is not until January 9, 2006, when the Final Pretrial
Order and motions-in-limine are due. Certainly, there are no circumstances presented by
Allergan's "provisional motion" that would justify a delay in that date, or in the scheduled
March 6, 2006 trial date.

Delay is not a neutral circumstance in this case. It benefits Allergan and would prejudice
Alcon, whose tentatively approved new drug product is being kept off the market today only by
virtue of this litigation. A prompt trial to decide this case on the merits is in the public interest,
as lower cost drugs should not be rendered unavailable through the assertion of invalid and

unenforceable patents.

For the foregoing reasons, Alcon respectfully requests that plaintiffs' provisional motion

to amend the Scheduling Order be denied.
