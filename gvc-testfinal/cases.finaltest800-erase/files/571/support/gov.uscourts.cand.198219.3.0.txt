1

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 and Civil Local Rule 7-11, plaintiff

2

Network Appliance, Inc. (“NetApp”) respectfully requests that the Court reschedule the initial

3

case management conference (“CMC”), currently set for March 11, 2008 at 10:00 AM to

4

January 8, 2008 at 10:00 AM or, if not then, no later than January 23, 2008.

5

NetApp filed this case because Sun Microsystems, Inc. (“Sun”) is “open-sourcing” what it

6

calls “ZFS” file system software code. That software code incorporates many of the patented

7

features developed by NetApp that have distinguished NetApp’s products from the competition

8

and have made them extremely successful. Sun, by injecting infringing code into the public

9

domain, is infecting open-source code and creating very harmful consequences both in the

10

marketplace and to the open-source community. One aspect of the relief NetApp plans to seek in

11

this case will be an injunction preventing Sun from continuing to support, update, and proliferate

12

infringing open-source software.

13

Because time is of the essence to prevent the further proliferation of the infected

14

open-source software code, this case was initially filed by NetApp in Texas in view of that

15

venue’s reputation for speed. In response, defendant Sun Microsystems, Inc. (“Sun”) threatened

16

to file a transfer motion. To avoid undue delay and dispute, NetApp agreed to the transfer of this

17

case to Your Honor with the explicit understanding that the parties would facilitate the prompt

18

resolution of this case. Indeed, a key aspect of the parties’ agreement was that the parties would

19

willingly schedule and participate in a prompt CMC before this Court.

20

reflected in the Agreed Motion to Transfer filed in Texas confirming that Your Honor “has agreed

21

to hear this matter and to conduct a prompt Case Management Conference.” Reines Decl. Exh. A

22

at 1-2.

This agreement is

23

That the parties agreed to seek a prompt CMC in this case is undisputed. In fact, the

24

parties held a teleconference with Your Honor in which they confirmed, before they entered into

25

their agreement, that this Court could accommodate a December CMC date to get this case

26

moving forthwith upon arrival in this District. Not once during the discussion with Your Honor

27

did Sun object to a December CMC. More recently, Sun has expressed an unduly stingy view of

28

the meaning of a prompt CMC, explaining its understanding of the objective of a prompt CMC to

be merely to ensure that a CMC would be held no later than if this case had remained in Texas:

2

“We agreed to a prompt CMC in the Texas case, so as to not materially delay the progress of that

3

case in light of the transfer.” Reines Decl. Exh. B at 3.

4

In view of the parties’ agreement, NetApp approached Sun to suggest January 8, 2008 for

5

the CMC. Given the upcoming holidays, this date is reasonably prompt. Setting the CMC for

6

January 8, 2008 would allow this case to move forward without unreasonable delay. That date

7

also makes sense because it was earlier than the January 23, 2008 CMC entered by the Texas

8

court, see Reines Decl. Exh. C at 1, which is the latest date that comports with either party’s

9

understanding of their agreement to schedule a “prompt” CMC. Indeed, Sun’s original response

10

appeared to be open to an early January conference in this case.1 But when NetApp asked Sun to

11

confirm whether it was agreeable to a January 8, 2008 CMC, Sun dragged its feet and failed to

12

provide a definite response. Indeed, Sun had still not provided a substantive response when,

13

today, the Clerk issued a standard order setting the CMC for March 11, 2008. Based on that form

14

order, Sun now takes the position that the March 11 CMC date is appropriate – despite the fact

15

that, if this case had remained in Texas, the CMC would occur months earlier. Reines Decl. Exh.

16

B at 1.

17

Regardless of whether Sun’s current position is an opportunistic attempt to delay

18

NetApp’s case, the fact remains that, even under Sun’s own interpretation of the parties’

19

agreement, the CMC should not be held any later than January 23, which is when the CMC would

20

have been held in Texas. Moreover, the faithful implementation of the parties’ agreement would

21

be to hold the CMC as soon as practical. January 8 is practical and Sun has not identified any

22

scheduling conflict that would prevent it from appearing on that date.

23

In conclusion, the Court should set the CMC in this case for January 8, but in no event

24

later than January 23. NetApp entered into the agreement to have this case transferred to this

Sun did, however, express serious concern about a January CMC for the case originally
assigned to Judge Ware, Case No. C 07-05488, because of the practical problems presented by
the state of the pleadings in that case. Reines Decl. Exh. B at 4. In that case, NetApp’s answer is
not due until December 21, and it does plan to bring number of patent infringement claims when
it files that answer. Given that record, NetApp agrees with Sun that a January CMC is
impractical for that case. Id. at 3.

Court in reliance on the express and documented understanding that this Court would move this

2

case forward. Delaying the CMC for months beyond when it would have been held in Texas is

3

unfair and disturbingly at odds with the arrangement that brought this case to this Court. The

4

Court should therefore grant NetApp’s motion, and a prompt CMC should be held on January 8.
