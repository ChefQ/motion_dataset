Case No. CR 11-0187-TUC LAB
DEFENDANT’S REQUEST
FOR VIDEOTAPING OF
COMPETENCY INTERVIEWS

20

The defense hereby respectfully requests that the Court, pursuant to the Fifth, Sixth and

21

Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, in the interests of justice and for the purposes of

22

preservation of evidence, order videotaping of all competency interviews of Mr. Loughner

23

during his commitment to MCFP Springfield pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d)(2). The instant

24

request focuses solely on competency interviews.

25

Background

26

Mr. Loughner is currently committed to a four-month term at MCFP Springfield for

27

restoration of competency under 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d)(2). His commitment began on October 12,

28
1

Case 4:11-cr-00187-LAB Document 360 Filed 10/26/11 Page 2 of 5

1

2011, after the Court found him substantially likely to be restored to competency. See Order of

2

September 30 (DE 343).

3

The defense requested videotaping of procedures at Springfield, first during

4

Mr. Loughner’s initial commitment there for a competency evaluation from March 23 to April

5

28, 2011. The Court granted that request, and found the video recordings it generated helpful

6

to its competency determination. See May 25, 2011 Transcript at 47-48.

7

The defense also requested videotaping during Mr. Loughner’s second commitment to

8

Springfield, which was for the purpose of determining whether he can be restored to competency

9

under § 42421(d)(1). Defense counsel initially sought videotaping of all clinical assessments

10

during this time, see DE 262, and later narrowed the scope of the request to accommodate the

11

BOP’s logistical concerns. See DE 279 (requesting video recording of only “formal, clinical

12

assessments” made by the BOP’s primary evaluator). At a hearing on the motion BOP prison

13

psychologist Christina Pietz expressed concerns with the scope of the request and suggested that

14

if the request were further narrowed to just competency interviews, “the interviews where I’m

15

asking specific competency-related questions,” the video recording would be far less intrusive

16

and less likely to interfere. See August 26, 2011 Transcript at 100.

17

Ultimately, the Court concluded that the utility of videotaping all clinical assessments

18

would be outweighed by the risk of interference with the restorability evaluation process due to

19

Mr. Loughner’s obsessive behavior and paranoia. See id. at 112-13. The Court denied the

20

motion without prejudice, indicating that it would readily reconsider the matter should the

21

situation change.1 Id. at 113.

Dr. Pietz agreed to “ask [Mr. Loughner] as he improves if he would be comfortable” with
videotaping and advise the Court. The Court directed Dr. Pietz to “report back...if you think the
situation changes from your present assessment where the presence of a camera and videotaping
with an audio function of the interviews won’t freak him out, won’t pose an obstacle to your
assessment and your interaction with him, then I’d like to know that as promptly as possible.”

Request for Videotaping of Competency Interviews

2

It appears that circumstances have now changed, and the defense hereby renews its

3

request for videotaping. This request is further narrowly tailored in scope, and seeks only video

4

recording of the competency interviews described by Dr. Pietz at the September 28, 2011. See

5

e.g., Transcript at pp. 61-62 (“formal competency interview”), 77 (“structured competency

6

interview”). Because the legal basis for the request remains the same as in the previous motions

7

which this Court is familiar with, defense counsel incorporates by reference the analyses in the

8

July 15 Request for Videotaping of Restoration Procedures and the August 11 Motion to

9

Reconsider. See DE 262 & 279.

10

The video recording request should be granted now. First, it appears that the competency

11

interviews referred to by Dr. Pietz have begun. BOP documents indicate that Dr. Pietz plans a

12

Competency Assessment sometime before November 12, 2011. See Exhibit A (under seal)

13

(“Individual Evaluation Plan” dated October 12, indicating that an assessment of competency

14

would occur “within 30 days”) (3-MCFP-002836 to 002837). November 12 is less than three

15

weeks away. The most recent production of BOP records indicates that Dr. Pietz had an

16

interview on October 17, 2011 discussing “competency related issues.”

17

Second, the scope of the instant request is minimally intrusive and unlikely to prove

18

unduly burdensome on BOP operations. The video recording equipment is readily available and

19

prison staff members are familiar with the process and techniques for its use. See August 26

20

Transcript at 101. Moreover, at the hearing on the previous motion, Dr. Pietz explained that

21

video recording of just formal competency interviews (as the defense presently requests) would

22

be much less burdensome than video recording of all clinical interviews (as previously

23

requested). She explained:

24
25
26
27

At some point when I feel confident that he’s no longer as psychotic, no longer as
depressed, I’m going to administer a competency instrument, and I also am going
to ask him very specific questions related to his competency to stand trial.
If you’re asking would I videotape just those last two things, the interviews where
I’m asking specific competency-related questions, that would be different and less
time-consuming than having to . . . videotape him every time I interview him to
assess his mental state. . . .

August 26 Transcript at 100 (emphasis added). Moreover, as the most recent BOP records

2

indicate, Mr. Loughner is being removed from his cell and taken to an interview room for the

3

competency evaluation. This is likely to make him more used to being transported before court

4

proceedings take place. As these proceedings will be held in a public forum, his adjustment to

5

a video camera is consistent with the BOP’s goals of restoration and preparing him through

6

repetition for some of the processes which a competent defendant faces.2 It also suggests that

7

the video equipment can be made ready prior to Mr. Loughner’s being brought into the room,

8

making the process far less intrusive.

9

Third, the limited video recording requested here is unlikely to interfere with BOP’s

10

efforts to restore Mr. Loughner. Unlike the last request for videotaping, it is no longer BOP’s

11

goal to evaluate whether Mr. Loughner can be restored to competency—an evaluative process

12

that the Court thought could be particularly sensitive to external influences. BOP is now charged

13

with actually restoring Mr. Loughner and, at some point, assessing whether he has in fact been

14

restored. This task is apt to be far less vulnerable to the observer effect that concerned the Court

15

about the previous video recording request. See August 26 Transcript at 113 (utility of video

16

recording was outweighed by “concerns that I have that having a camera, requiring a camera,

17

and audio taping will interfere with the mission of the Bureau of Prisons, which is to make the

18

assessment and report back to the Court”). Experience in this case supports this distinction. As

19

Dr. Pietz explained, the video recording during Mr. Loughner’s first commitment—for a

20

competency assessment, just like the subject of the video recording requested in this

21

motion—did not affect her evaluation or her ability to proceed with the competency evaluation.

22

See August 26 Transcript at 106.

23

Finally, Dr. Pietz’s discussion of “competency related issues” with Mr. Loughner and her

24

expressed intention to proceed with a competency assessment by November 12, 2011 suggests

25

that in her opinion he is better and therefore should be able to proceed with videotaping the

26
27

28

The Court has also used a video-camera in the courtroom for proceedings when
Mr. Loughner has been present, to project the proceedings in an “overflow” courtroom.

formal and/or structured competency interviews. See Testimony of Dr. Pietz, August 26, 2011,

2

at 100 (“At some point when I feel confident that he’s no longer as psychotic, no longer as

3

depressed, I’m going to administer a competency instrument, and I also am going to ask him very

4

specific questions related to his competency to stand trial.”); September 28, 2011 at 61-62 (“At

5

some point, when. . . it’s my opinion that he’s close to competency, I would do a formal

6

competency interview and I would take notes at that time.”) and at 77 (“When he’s better able

7

to do those sorts of things, I will do a structured competency interview.”). Thus, given

8

Dr. Pietz’s venture into “competency related issues” and intention to proceed with an assessment

9

by November 12, it appears the balance between the utility of video recording and risk of undue

10

interference has now tipped in favor of video recordings.3
Conclusion

11
12

The defense respectfully requests that the Court order that the formal competency

13

interviews of Mr. Loughner, including administration of competency instruments, be video

14

recorded and provided to defense counsel.
Respectfully submitted,

Failure to videotape these competency interviews will result in the permanent loss of
potentially critical evidence, and undermine the accuracy of the ultimate determination of what
are likely to be highly contested issues.
