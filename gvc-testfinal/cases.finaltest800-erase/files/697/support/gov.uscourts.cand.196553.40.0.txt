Case 3:07-cv-05182-WHA Document 40 Filed 12/10/2007 Page 5of 14

Class member Frans Veldman ("Movant") submits this Memorandum of Points and
Authorities in Support of Motion of Frans Veldman to Consolidate, to Be Appointed Lead Plaintiff,
and for Approval of his Selection of Lead and Liaison Counsel.

INTRODUCTION

Movant moves to be appointed Lead Plaintiff in this action against LDK Solar Co., Ltd.
("LDK" or the "Company"), and certain officers and directors of LDK, on behalf of all persons or
entities who purchased LDK securities during the period June 1, 2007 to October 8, 2007, inclusive
(the "Class Period"). Excluded from the class are Defendants, the officers and directors of the
Company, members of their immediate families, and their legal representatives, heirs, successors, or
assigns, and any entity in which Defendants have or had a controlling interest. The Class is seeking
redress pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act").

Movant purchased a total of 1,900 shares during the Class Period, and suffered approximate
losses' of $58,066 as a result of Defendants' misconduct. In Point I, Movant argues that
consolidation is appropriate because the actions involve common questions of law or fact. In Point
HI, Movant argues that he should be appointed Lead Plaintiff because Movant: (a) timely moved for
appointment as Lead Plaintiff; (b) suffered losses of approximately $58,066 in connection with the
transactions in LDK securities during the Class Period, and thus has a substantial financial interest in

this litigation; and (c) will adequately represent the interests of the Class. See 78u-4(a}(3)(B)Gii). In

 

' The losses suffered are not the same as Movant's legally compensable damages,
measurement of which is often a complex legal question which cannot be determined at this stage of
the litigation. The approximate losses can, however, be determined from the certifications required
under Section 21D of the Exchange Act and based on information concerning the current market for
the Company's securities. See Declaration of Brian Brooks in Support of Frans Veldman's Motion
to Consolidate, to be Appointed Lead Plaintiff and for Approval of his Selection of Lead Counsel,
executed on December 10, 2007 (the "Brooks Declaration"), Exhibits B and C.

Point II, Movant argues that his selection of Murray ,Frank & Sailer LLP as Lead Counsel, and

Glancy Binkow & Goldberg as Liaison Counsel, for the Class should be approved by the Court

because, pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"): i) the

presumptive Lead Plaintiff selects Lead Counsel and Liaison Counsel, and ii) because Murray, Frank

& Sailer LLP and Glancy, Binkow and Goldberg LLP have extensive experience in the prosecution

of securities class actions and will more than adequately represent the interests of all Class members.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On October 9, 2007, the plaintiff in Chester Tsang v. LDK Solar Co., Ltd. et al., 07-cv-8706
(JGK) filed a class action complaint in the Southern District of New York asserting violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleged that from June 1, 2007 to
October 2, 2007, the Company and certain others made materially false and misleading statements
regarding the Company's consolidated financial statements. Subsequently, six additional complaints
were filed against LDK and various other defendants, four of which were filed in this court, and two
of which were filed in the Southern District of New York.

Pursuant to Section 21D(a)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u 4(a)(3)(A), on
October 9, 2007, a notice was published over MARKET WIRE, a widely-circulated national business-
oriented wire service, advising investors of the pendency of the action, the claims asserted therein,
the purported class period, and their right to move this Court to be appointed Lead Plaintiff no later
than December 10, 2007. A copy of the notice is attached to the Brooks Declaration as Exhibit A.

Movant purchased shares of LDK during the Class Period, and now moves to be appointed
Lead Plaintiff. Mr. Veldman's certification is attached to the Brooks Declaration as Exhibit B. A

chart demonstrating Movant's losses is attached to the Brooks Declaration as Exhibit C.

 

? The additional cases filed in the Southern District of New York are Lui v. LDK Solar Co. et al., No.
07-cv-8766-JGK, and Halidou v. LDK Solar Co. et al., 07-cv-9745-IGK.

Case 3:07-cv-05182-WHA Document 40 Filed 12/10/2007 Page 7 of 14

STATEMENT OF FACTS

LDK is a Cayman Islands company, incorporated on May 1, 2006, that produces and sells
multicrystalline solar wafers to manufacturers of photovoltaic products, including solar cells and
solar modules, both in and outside of The People's Republic of China. In addition, LDK provides
wafer processing services to monocrystalline and multicrystalline solar cell `and module
manufacturers. LDK also sells polysilicon materials, including ingots and polysilicon scraps. Solar
waters are thin sheets of crystalline silicon material primarily made by slicing multicrystalline ingots
or monocrystalline boules. Solar wafers are the principal raw material used to produce solar cells,
which are devices capable of converting sunlight to electricity. Polysilicon feedstock is an essential
raw material used in manufacturing solar wafers.

During the Class Period, LDK made SEC filings and issued press releases discussing LDK's
financial condition. These SEC filings and press releases were materially false and misleading when
issued because they misrepresented and failed to disclose the following material adverse facts: (1)
that the Company had significantly less polysilicon feedstock inventory than it was reporting; (2)
that only a fraction of the feedstock inventory that the Company did have was of sufficient quality
for use in the manufacture of silicone wafers; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the
Company's financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On October 3, 2007, Piper Jaffray stated in a research note that "[w]e have confirmed that the

3

LDK financial controller recently left the company," and "[w]e are also aware of the former
controller's allegations of poor financial controls and a 250-tonne inventory discrepancy." In
reaction to this news, LDK ADSs closed at $51.65 on October 3, 2007, down 24.4% from the

previous day's close. On October 4, 2007, LDK issued a press release via PR NEWSWIRE denying

the allegations and announcing an independent audit of LDK's inventory. LDK ADSs closed at

$48.30 on October 4, 2007, down 6.5% from the previous day's close and 29.3% from the closing
price on October 2, 2007. On October 8, 2007, BLOOMBERG NEWS reported that "[t]he quality of
LDK's silicon ingots is so low that a recent production run produced tons of them that were too
contaminated for technicians to analyze," and that "LDK's inventories may be overvalued by as
much as $92 million." In reaction to this news, LDK ADSs closed at $37.50 on October 8, 2007,
down 26.4% from the previous day's close and 45.7% from October 2, 2007.
POINT I
CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE
Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:

When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending

before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the

matters in issue in the actions, it may order all the actions

consolidated, and it may make such orders concerning proceedings

therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a). Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for the consolidation
of actions involving common questions of law or fact. Movant asks this Court to consolidate all
related actions with this action, as well as any other action now pending or hereafter filed in or
transferred to this Judicial District as a class action on behalf of purchasers of the securities of LDK.
which arise out of the same facts as alleged in the above-referenced actions and allege violations of
Section 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

The class actions currently before the Court are ideally suited for consolidation pursuant to

Rule 42, since they present virtually identical claims for relief based upon a single course of conduct,
as described above. Thus, since the complaints present similar issues of law and fact, consolidation
of these actions promotes judicial economy by streamlining and simplifying pre-trial and discovery
motions and class certification issues, and by reducing the waste, confusion, and delay that could
result from multiple trials. Consolidation is particularly appropriate in securities class actions. See

Aronson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., 79 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1150 (N.D. Cal. 1999) ("It seems obvious

that fifty-four separate class actions predicated on the same set of misstatements by corporate

questions of fact."'),
Under Section 21D(a)(3)(B)Gi) of the Exchange Act, the Court must decide this motion to
consolidate before determining the Lead Plaintiff.
POINT II

MOVANT MEETS THE PSRLA'S
REQUIREMENTS FOR APPOINTMENT AS LEAD PLAINTIFF

Movant should be appointed Lead Plaintiff of the Class because he has complied with all of
the PSLRA's requirements for appointment as Lead Plaintiff, has demonstrated the largest financial
interest of plaintiffs for the Class in this litigation, and otherwise meets the relevant requirements of
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 within the meaning of the Exchange Act.

A. The PSLRA's Procedural Requirements

The PSLRA has established a procedure that governs the appointment of a Lead Plaintiff in
"each action arising under the [Securities Act and/or Exchange Act] that is brought as a plaintiff
class action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 78u-4(a)(1) and
(a)(3)(B)().

First, the plaintiff who files the initial action must publish a notice to the class, within 20
days of filing the action, informing class members of their right to file a motion for appointment as
Lead Plaintiff. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A)@). Plaintiff in the Tsang action caused such notice to
be published on October 9, 2007. See Brooks Declaration, Exhibit A. Within 60 days after
publication of the notice, any person or group of persons who are members of the proposed class
may apply to the Court to be appointed as Lead Plaintiff, whether or not they have previously filed a
complaint in the action. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A) and (B).

Second, the PSLRA provides that within 90 days after publication of the notice, the Court
shall consider any motion made by a class member and shall appoint as Lead Plaintiff the member or

members of the class that the Court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the

interests of class members. 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(a)(3)(B). In determining the "most adequate plaintiff,"
the PSLRA provides that:

[T]he court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any
private action arising under this title is the person or group of persons that --

(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a
notice...

{bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial
interest in the relief sought by the class; and

(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.

15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 77z-1{a)(3)(B)Gii) and 78u-4(2a)(3)(B)Gi); see also Erikson v. Cornerstone Propane
Partners LP, No. 03-2522, 2003 WL 22232387, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 15, 2003).

B. Movant Has Moved To Be Appointed Lead Plaintiff

The time period in which class members `may move to be appointed Lead Plaintiff herein
under 15 U.S.C. 0x00A79 78u-4(a)(3)(A) and (B) expires on December 10, 2007. Pursuant to the
provisions of the PSLRA and within the requisite time frame after publication of the required notice,
Movant herein timely moves this Court to be appointed Lead Plaintiff on behalf of all members of
the Class.

Frans Veldman has duly signed a certification stating that he has reviewed the complaint
filed in the action and is willing to serve as representative plaintiff on behalf of the Class. See
Brooks Declaration, Exhibit B. In addition, Movant has selected and retained experienced and
competent counsel to represent him and the Class. See Brooks Declaration, Exhibit D.

Accordingly, Movant has satisfied the individual requirements of 15 U.S.C.
0x00A70x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B) and is entitled to have his application for appointment as Lead Plaintiff and

selection of counsel, as set forth herein, considered and approved by the Court.
