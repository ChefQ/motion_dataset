prior to this Court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion to remand would be a waste of
resources. For this reason the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this court extend
Plaintiffs time to respond to the Defendants’ several motions to dismiss. Should
this Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion to remand, Plaintiffs request 28 days following
such order to prepare their response to the Defendants’ pending motions to dismiss.

Respectfully submitted this 14th Day of March, 2012, by:
