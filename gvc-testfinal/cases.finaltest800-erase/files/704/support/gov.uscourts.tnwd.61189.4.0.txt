Case No. 2:12-cv-02143-cgc

Removal of Case No. CH-11-1757-3 From
Chancery Court for the State of Tennessee
in Shelby County

MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULE 12(b)(1) AND 12(b)(6)
Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
Defendants the Democratic National Committee (the “DNC”), the Tennessee Democratic Party
(the “TNDP”), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (“Wasserman Schultz”), and Chip Forrester
(“Forrester” and collectively with the previously named defendants the “Defendants”) 1,
respectfully move this Court to dismiss this case in its entirety or in part.

Alternatively,

Defendants respectfully move this Court to dismiss all parties but for the TNDP, which is the
party responsible, under Tennessee law to submit the Democratic Party’s nominee to the
Tennessee Secretary of State Division of Elections. In support of this Motion to Dismiss,
Defendants state the following:

1

Plaintiffs also name the National Democratic Party of the USA, Inc. as a defendant, but this organization is
apparently a sham organization, most likely affiliated with the Shelby County Republican Party, and therefore, as
explained in greater detail herein, is not a proper party to this lawsuit. Accordingly, they will not be treated as a
proper defendant.

1. Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed in entirety because
Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims;
2. Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed because: 1) Federal law
prevents this Court from entering the relief requested because the determination of
whether a candidate is constitutionally qualified to hold the office of the President of the
United States is left, in the first instance, to the electorate and the United States Congress;
2) the Defendants have an absolute right to nominate whoever they want as their
candidate for President of the United States; 3) Plaintiffs cannot show that they will
detrimentally rely upon any misrepresentation made by the Defendants and therefore
cannot state a claim for either intentional or negligent misrepresentation;
3. Finally and alternatively, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), all Defendants but for the TNDP
must be dismissed in this case because only the TNDP has the authority to submit a name
to the Tennessee Secretary of State Division of Elections identifying the Democratic
Party’s nominee for President of the United States; and
4. In support of this Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants rely upon the following:
a. All pleadings filed to date;
b. All papers filed along with the Notice of Removal, filed on February 23, 2012;
c. The Memorandum in Support of the Motion To Dismiss filed contemporaneously
herewith (“Memo in Support”).
In light of the foregoing, and for the reasons articulated in the accompanying Memo in
Support, Defendants move this Court to dismiss this action in its entirety, or in the alternative
dismiss all Defendants but the TNDP.
Submitted this 1st day of March, 2012.
