Defendants
PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT
TO RULES 12(b)(1) AND 12(b)(6)
Pursuant to this Court’s Rules, Plaintiffs submit this Opposition and Memorandum in
Opposition to Defendant Democratic National Committee (“DNC”), Defendant Tennessee
Democratic Party (“TNDP”), Defendant Forrester, and Defendant Schultz’s motion to dismiss
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

Contrary to the Defendant’s Assertion, No Federal Court has Ruled on the
Question Presented Since 1874
The Defendants attempt to negate the importance of the instant lawsuit by asserting that

“Several courts at both the federal and state level have unfortunately had to address these
ridiculous allegations…all of the previous filed suits proved baseless.” See Doc. 5, Def.’s Mtn. at
2. However, nine pages later, in a footnote, the Defendants acknowledge that “Only one court

1 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 2 of 17

PageID 160

has reached the merits of whether President Obama is a ‘natural born citizen.’” See Doc. 5,
Def.’s Mtn. at 11, FN5. That court was an Indiana state court.
The fact is that no federal court has defined the term “natural born citizen” in its holding
since the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding in Minor v. Happersett. 88 U.S. 162, 167 (1874).
While over 100 cases have been filed in the past four years challenging candidate
Obama’s constitutional eligibility to hold the office of President, almost all of those cases have
been dismissed on procedural grounds. To the Plaintiffs’ knowledge only three cases have ruled
on the substantive issue, and two of those three had already held a procedural ground to be
determinative, but felt compelled to violate the doctrine of judicial restraint by commenting on
the substantive issue after determining that they didn’t have jurisdiction to reach the substantive
issue. Ankeny v. Governor of the State of Indiana, 916 N.E.2d 678, (Ind. App. 2010); Allen v.
Ariz. Democratic Party, No. C20121217 (Ariz. Prima Cnty. Super. Ct. 2012) (citing Ankeny,
916 N.E.2d 678); Welden v. Obama, No. 1215137-60 (Ga. OSAH 2012). Exactly zero federal
courts have ruled on the merits of applying Article II eligibility requirements to candidate
Obama. 1

The Defendants accuse the Plaintiffs of “an obvious attempt to demean the President and the
office” by referring to Mr. Obama as “Mr. Obama.” Doc. 5, Defs.’ Mot. at FN2. However, the
Plaintiffs’ complaint specifically stated: “Hereinafter this Complaint will refer to President
Obama, also known as Barack Hussein Obama Jr., Barack Obama II, and Barry Soetoro, as “Mr.
Obama.” This reference is not intended to be disrespectful to the office of the President or to the
individual Barack Obama. It is used only to identify the individual, separate from the office, and
to simplify communication for purposes of this Complaint.” 1st Amd. Compl. at FN2. The
Defendants also insist upon referring to candidate Obama as “President Obama.” Doc. 5, Defs.’
Mot. at FN2. However, this litigation is directed toward an individual candidate’s eligibility to
run for office. For purposes of the 2012 election candidate Obama is not yet President.
Therefore, referring to him as “President Obama” is inaccurate for the purposes of this litigation
because he has not yet been elected to the term of office for which the upcoming election is
being held.

PageID 161

Therefore, the Defendants statement that “all of the previously filed suits proved
baseless” is unsupported because only one state administrative court has reached the merits of
Article II eligibility. Welden v. Obama, No. 1215137-60 (Ga. OSAH 2012).2

II.

The Instant Case is Unique
The first five paragraphs of Plaintiffs’ complaint distinguish the Plaintiffs’ lawsuit from

any of the cases referred to by the Defendants.
Most importantly, the named Plaintiffs in the instant case include a Presidential
candidate, registered with the Federal Election Commission as running against candidate Obama.
Plfs. 1st Amd. Compl. ¶ 31. As discussed below, this difference overcomes the standing issue
that has led to dismissal of the huge majority of previous lawsuits challenging candidate
Obama’s eligibility.
Also, the instant case asserts negligence and fraud against non-governmental defendants.
Plfs. 1st Amd. Compl. ¶ 3. Plaintiffs are unaware of any case that has made such claims, or
named non-governmental defendants in relation to their handling of the Article II question
presented.
As discussed below, the Plaintiffs in the instant case have standing and this Court has
jurisdiction to reach the merits of the substantive question presented, which this Court has
already recognized as “important and not trivial.” Doc 18, Or. Denying Remand, at 9.

Liberty Legal Foundation represented one of the plaintiffs in the Georgia Office of State
Administration litigation. That litigation has been appealed through all levels of the Georgia
State Appellate Courts and LLF is now preparing a petition for certiorari to be filed with the U.S.
Supreme Court later this month. To the best of LLF’s knowledge this is the first court to deny all
procedural grounds for dismissal and actually reach the merits.

Dicta from Wong Kim Ark Cannot Negate the Minor Court’s Definition of
“Natural Born Citizen” Under Article II
Defendants’ motion notes that a handful of state cases have cited dicta from the Supreme

Court’s Wong Kim Ark (“WKA”) opinion in order to imply that the Supreme Court’s definition
of “natural born citizen” in Minor v. Happersett was overturned. 169 U.S. 649, 702 (1898); 88
U.S. 162, 167 (1874), respectively. This conclusion of law is demonstrably incorrect.
The holding of Wong Kim Ark did not address the definition of the term “natural born
citizen” nor did it address Article II qualifications to serve as President. 169 U.S. 649 at 705. The
WKA holding didn’t define the term “natural born citizen” because the WKA facts did not
present a question that required interpretation of Article II. Id. at 653. WKA explicitly addressed
the scope of 14th Amendment citizenship. Id. at 705. However, citizenship under the 14th
Amendment is legally distinct from “natural born citizen” as required under Article II for
eligibility to serve as President.
Unlike WKA, the Minor Court did define “natural born citizen” as that term is used in
Article II. Minor, 88 U.S. at 167. Unlike WKA, the Minor Court expressly used its definition of
“natural born citizen” to reach its holding. Id.
Because the WKA Court did not need to define Article II “natural born citizen” to reach
its holding, any inferences drawn from WKA about the term “natural born citizen” are simply
dicta. Black’s Law Dictionary 465 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (Defining Dictum
Gratis as, “A court’s discussion of points or questions not raised by the record or its suggestion
of rules not applicable in the case at bar.”)
In contrast, the Minor Court’s explicit definition of “natural born citizen” was part of its
holding because that Court specifically noted that defining this term was required in order to
reach its conclusion on the matter presented to the Court. 88 U.S. at 167; See also Black’s Law

4 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 5 of 17

PageID 163

Dictionary 737 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (Defining Holding as, “A court’s
determination of a matter of law pivotal to its decision; a principle drawn from such a
decision.”).
Therefore, the Minor Court’s definition of “natural born citizen” is binding precedent.
Black’s Law Dictionary 1195 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (“[A] case becomes a
precedent only for such a general rule as is necessary to the actual decision reached, when shorn
of unessential circumstances.”) (quoting 1 James Parker Hall, Introduction, American Law and
Procedure xlviii (1952)).
Since dicta cannot change binding precedent, the term “natural born citizen” under
Article II is defined by the Supreme Court’s decision in Minor.
Despite any state-court rulings to the contrary, simply being born in the United States
does not necessarily make one a “natural born citizen” as that term is used in Article II. Having a
mother that is a citizen of the United States does not necessarily make one a “natural born
citizen.” According to binding precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court, to be a “natural born
citizen” a person must be born in the United States of two parents that are U.S. citizens at the
time the “natural born citizen” is born. Minor, 88 U.S. at 167.3
Venerable rules of construction also prevent use of dicta from the WKA Court to overrule
the Minor Court’s precedential definition of “natural born citizen.” As Chief Justice Marshall
explained in Marbury v. Madison, “It cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is
intended to be without effect; and therefore such a construction is inadmissible, unless the words

3

The WKA Court recognized that the facts presented in that case did not give that Court an
opportunity to change the definition of Article II “natural born citizen.” This is why the WKA
Court expressly identified its holding as its holding. 169 U.S. at 705. The WKA holding is very
narrowly tailored to the facts addressed in the WKA case, and never mentions the term “natural
born citizen.” Id.

PageID 164

require it.” 5 U.S. 137, 174 (1805). This principal is also applied to statutory construction:
“When there are two acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect to both if
possible…The intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest.” United States v.
Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198 (1939). This venerable principal is still in use: “The Courts are
not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two statutes are
capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional
intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.” Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551
(1974); See also United States v. Tynen, 78 U.S. 88 (1870); Henderson’s Tobacco, 78 U.S. 652,
657 (1870); General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. United States, 286 U.S. 49, 61 (1932); Wood v.
United States, 41 U.S. 342, 362-363 (1842).
The Minor Court’s definition of Article II “natural born citizen” co-exists with the WKA
Court’s determination of the scope of 14th Amendment citizenship. By contrast, any inference
that WKA overturns Minor would leave Article II “natural born citizen” with no independent
meaning from the 14th Amendment’s “citizen.”
This conclusion is not changed by the fact that naturalized citizens can be distinguished
from 14th Amendment citizens. Each legal term, naturalized citizen, 14th Amendment citizen, and
Article II natural-born-citizen, must be given independent meaning if such independent meaning
can be given. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 174; Borden Co., 308 U.S. at 198.
Again, dicta from WKA cannot grant Article II “natural born citizen” status to candidate
Obama. 4

Plaintiffs Have Standing to Bring Suit
A. Plaintiff Dummett
As the Defendants are aware, the 9th Circuit recently confirmed that political candidates

for office have standing to challenge the eligibility of rival candidates for the same office. Drake
v. Obama, 664 F.3d 774, 782-783 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Owen v. Mulligan, 640 F.2d 1130, 113233 (9th Cir. 1981). Specifically, the Drake Court ruled that an independent candidate for
President of the United States has standing to challenge the constitutional qualifications of
candidate Obama. Id. citing Fulani v. Hogsett, 917 F.2d 1028, 1030 (7th Cir. 1990).
The Defendants assertion to this Court that Drake stands for the proposition that “third
party political candidates lacked standing to challenge whether President Obama satisfied
‘natural born citizen’ requirement,” is a misrepresentation. See Doc. 5, Defs.’ Mot. at 9. The
Drake Court first found that third party candidates do have standing to challenge competitor
candidates, and then determined that such standing becomes moot after the election at issue.
Drake, 664 F.3d at 782-783.
The “competitive standing” that the 9th Circuit confirmed in Drake is exactly the type of
standing alleged by Plaintiff Dummett in the instant case. 1 st Amd. Compl. ¶¶31-33.

B. Liberty Legal Foundation (LLF)
Defendants surprisingly argue that “protecting the rights of voters to have a
constitutionally qualified candidate on the state ballot…is not germane” to LLF’s purpose of
defending basic human rights. Doc. 5, Defs.’ Mot. at 10. This argument reflects a shocking lack
of understanding regarding the necessity for enforcement of constitutional protections to
safeguard basic human rights.

7 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 8 of 17

PageID 166

While it should be obvious, apparently it is not obvious enough: LLF’s purpose of
defending basic human rights includes advocating to have the U.S. Constitution enforced. The
Plaintiffs formally request judicial notice of the fact that enforcing the U.S. Constitution will,
without doubt, enhance basic human rights.

C. One Plaintiff with Standing Allows the Case to Proceed
Finally, and most importantly, only one Plaintiff needs to have standing in order to
maintain a suit. Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007). Because Plaintiff Dummett has
standing, all other Plaintiffs in the instant case, including Liberty Legal Foundation, also have
standing. The Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing must be DENIED.

V.

Defendants’ Preemption Argument Fails
A. Robinson and 3 U.S.C. §15 are Inapplicable
Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, Robinson v. Bowen and 3 U.S.C. §15 are inapplicable

to the instant case. Defs.’ Mot. At 8; citing 567 F. Supp. 2d at 1147. First, Robinson and 3 U.S.C.
§15 address the rights and responsibilities of delegates to the electoral college, not Presidential
candidate plaintiffs.
More importantly, if Robinson had been applicable to the facts at bar, it has been
overturned by Drake v. Obama. 664 F.3d 774, 782-783 (9th Cir. 2011). Robinson held that
“[j]udicial review - if any – should occur only after the electoral and Congressional processes
have run their course.” 567 F. Supp. 2d at 1147. However, the Drake Court held that such claims
would be justiciable before an election, but moot after the election had been held. 664 F.3d at
784. The 9th Circuit’s ruling that such challenges would be moot after the election precludes the
District Court’s holding that such challenges are precluded before the election.

8 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 9 of 17

PageID 167

B. Legislation Does Not Negate the Constitution
Defendants’ preemption argument also fails because 3 U.S.C. §15 sets forth procedures
for counting electoral votes in Congress, after the states have determined which electors they will
appoint. In other words, 3 U.S.C. §15 applies to the process that occurs after the general election.
3 U.S.C. §15 has nothing to do with how the states determine which electors they will appoint.
Article II, paragraph 2 states in relevant part “Each state shall appoint, in such manner as
the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors…” (emphasis added).
3 U.S.C. §15 sets forth the procedures that are followed pursuant to the third paragraph of
Article II. But the Defendants argument would have 3 U.S.C. §15 negate the second paragraph of
Article II. The instant litigation is about how the states will determine which electors the states
choose to appoint. The instant litigation has nothing to do with how those electors vote in the
electoral college process after the election.
If the Defendants’ were correct that 3 U.S.C. §15 preempts how states choose electors,
this would mean that an act of Congress can take away the States’ rights to determine how their
elections are to be governed. The Constitutional clause “[I]n such manner as the legislature
thereof may direct” would be negated by a simple act of Congress. Congress cannot alter the
Constitution, except via the amendment process. See Art. V.
If the Defendants argument was correct it would negate all state election laws,
everywhere in the country, because according to the Defendants’ logic such laws would interfere
with the field preemption the Defendants attribute to 3 U.S.C. §15.
All of the problems with the Defendants reading of 3 U.S.C. §15 are supported by, well,
simply reading 3 U.S.C. §15. Nothing in the statute indicates or implies an intention to preempt

9 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 10 of 17

PageID 168

the States’ right to select Presidential electors “in such manner as the legislature thereof may
direct.”
This is why the 9th Circuit ignored and overturned the Robinson Court. See Drake, 664
F.3d at 782-783.
C. Defendants’ Argument that the Will of the People Overrides the Constitution
Negates a Primary Purpose of the Constitution
The Defendants argue that “the determination of whether a candidate for President of the
United States is constitutionally qualified to hold that office rests, in the first instance with the
electorate.” Doc. 5, Defs.’ Mot. at 11.

This statement again reflects a complete lack of

understanding regarding Constitutional protections.
In a Constitutional Republic the power of the majority is limited and cannot infringe upon
protected rights of a minority. The Constitution is an anti-majoritarian document; meaning that it
protects individuals from invasions and usurpations by the majority. Constitutionally protected
rights are held inviolate regardless of the majority’s desire to violate them. Without such
protections any law enacted by Congress would be valid, even if it denied an individual their
right to life, liberty, or property. Without the anti-majoritarian protection of the Constitution,
Congress could legalize the killing of all Jews, for example, as was done in World War II
Germany. Constitutional requirements are absolute, and must be followed regardless of how
popular or unpopular such requirements may be, because they are in place to protect the
minority.
The Defendants’ presumption that popular vote overrides the Constitution demonstrates
their lack of understanding of the Constitution and emphasizes the critical role played by this
Court in protecting Americans from a tyrannical majority. This Court has the duty, obligation,

10 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 11 of 17

PageID 169

and authority to interpret the Constitution and protect each individual seeking its protection in
the face of constitutional violations. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, (1805).
The Defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted due to preemption, must be DENIED.

VI.

Right-to-Associate Precedent Does Not Support Defendant’s Motion
The Defendants are correct that “The Tennessee Democratic Party Has A Right To

Nominate Whoever It Wants As Its Candidate for President of the United States.” Doc. 5, Defs.’
Mot. at 14. However, that right does not give the Defendants the additional right to certify to the
State of Tennessee that its candidate is constitutionally qualified to hold the office of President
when their candidate is actually not constitutionally qualified to hold the office of President. In
other words, the Defendants’ constitutional right to freedom of association does not grant them
the additional right to lie to the State of Tennessee.
Contrary to the Defendants’ assertion, the Plaintiffs are not challenging the Democratic
Party’s right to “select a standard bearer who best represents the party’s ideologies and
preferences.” Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 575 (2000). Instead, the Plaintiffs
are pointing out that the Defendants’ right to select a candidate does not grant them an additional
right to misrepresent their candidate’s qualifications to officers of the States.
The Defendants’ argument morphs right-to-associate precedent into a political party’s
right to misrepresent facts with impunity. The Defendants argue that a political party’s right to
determine who will be a member of the party somehow also grants the party a Constitutional
right to lie to the States. No precedent supports this argument.
The right to associate has been interpreted to allow private groups to determine who will
and will not be members of the group. Jones, 530 U.S. at 575; Democratic Party of U.S. v.

11 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 12 of 17

PageID 170

Wisconsin, 450 U.S. 107 (1981); Duke v. Cleland, 954 F.2d 1526 (11th Cir. 1992); Belluso v.
Poythress, 485 F.Supp. 904 (N.D.Ga. 1980). However, no court has extended this right beyond
the confines of the private organization. A party can determine who it will include as members.
That party can also determine which of those members will be its candidates. However, nothing
in the Constitution or freedom-to-associate precedent extends this right to support the
Defendants’ assertion that they have a right to lie to the States.
Several right-to-associate cases did involve candidates’ exclusion from ballots. See
Democratic Party of U.S. v. Wisconsin, 450 U.S. 107 (1981); Duke v. Cleland, 954 F.2d 1526
(11th Cir. 1992); Belluso v. Poythress, 485 F.Supp. 904 (N.D.Ga. 1980). However, all of these
cases are exactly opposite to the present situation. All involved political parties excluding a
candidate because the party did nnt want to be associated with the candidate. In every case cited
the candidate sued the party and/or state for inclusion on the ballot after being excluded.
There are no cases where a political party’s decision to support a candidate created a
Constitutional right to certify false facts as true. Such precedent would place the political party’s
right-to-lie above the rights of the States and the citizens to not be defrauded. Such precedent
would negate any obligation for the political parties to ensure that certifications sent by them to
State officers reflect true statements. Such precedent would negate any purpose for the States to
require such certifications.
The Plaintiffs’ requested relief does nothing to interfere with the rights of the parties to
select candidates. The Democratic Party is free to choose Saddam Hussein or Mickey Mouse as
their next Presidential candidate. However, they do not have a constitutional right to submit
fraudulent or grossly negligent certifications to state officials about their candidates. In the
instant case the Plaintiffs’ requested relief does nothing to infringe on the Democratic Party’s

12 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 13 of 17

PageID 171

right of association because the Party can include candidate Obama, or any other individual, in
its organization. The Party can choose Mr. Obama, or any other person, to be its “standard
bearer.” The Party’s rights, however, end there.
The parties’ Constitutional right to select candidates ends with their right to select
candidates. It does not automatically create additional rights to knowingly lie to the States.
Since many candidates have been excluded from ballots for lack of qualification to hold
the office sought, we can safely conclude that the Defendant’s argument fails. The Defendants’
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, must be
DENIED.

VII.

Plaintiffs’ Complaint Properly Alleges Reliance

The Defendants cite precedent that recites the basic elements of negligent
misrepresentation and claim that the instant case does not reflect a strict, formulaic application of
these elements. Doc. 5, Defs.’ Mot. at 17. They argue that the Secretary of State is the one
relying on the Defendants’ misrepresentation, and the Secretary of State is not one of the
Plaintiffs.
However, an elementary understanding of tort law reveals that the reliance element arises
from the Plaintiffs’ burden to prove causation. Negligent misrepresentation is simply a sub-type
of the broader tort of negligence. The elements of negligence are duty, breach of duty, damages,
and causation. In the context of the instant case the duty element is the Defendants’ general duty
to not cause harm; the breach of duty happens to be negligent misrepresentation; the damage is
votes being cast for the Plaintiffs’ competitor; and that damage is directly caused by Secretary of
State’s reliance upon the Defendants’ negligent misrepresentation.

13 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 14 of 17

PageID 172

The fact that the misrepresentation is made to a non-plaintiff does not negate the fact that
the harm caused by Defendants’ negligence causes damage to the Plaintiffs. The precedent cited
by the Defendants recites elements that arise most of the time in the context of negligent
misrepresentation. However, these precedent were not intended to create blind adherence to
formulaic elements which ignore unpredictable fact patterns that arise in the real world.
Procedural and substantive law is all intended to support substantial justice.
In the alternative, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 states that leave to amend shall be
freely given when justice so requires. The Plaintiffs have, as stated above, shown that the
elements of simple negligence have been properly pled. Should this Court determine that the
current complaint does not support a claim of negligent misrepresentation, the Plaintiffs hereby
request leave to file an amended complaint to reflect a claim of simple negligence.
The Defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted, must be DENIED.

VIII. Defendants DNC and Schultz Should Not be Dismissed
The Defendants final argument is that Defendants DNC and Schultz should be dismissed
because Tennessee law makes the TNDP “solely and exclusively responsible” to certify its
Presidential candidate to the Tennessee Secretary of State. See Doc. 5, Defs.’ Mot. at 18; citing
Tenn. Code Ann. §2-5-201.
However, §2-5-201 does not contain the language asserted by the Defendants. §2-5-201
states in its entirety: “All ballots used in elections shall be printed and made as provided in this
chapter except to the extent that other sections of this title expressly provide otherwise.”

14 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 15 of 17

PageID 173

Despite pre-litigation research on Tennessee Election Code, LLF is unaware of any code
that would make the TNDP “solely and exclusively responsible” to certify its Presidential
candidate to the Tennessee Secretary of State.
Assuming, however, that such code exists, it would still fail to create grounds for
dismissing Defendants DNC and Schultz. Such code may require the TNDP to submit documents
to ensure that a candidate appear on the ballot. However, this would not necessarily preclude the
DNC or Schultz from additionally certifying to the Tennessee Secretary of State that the
Democratic Party has selected a specific candidate for the office of President.
In other words, despite the existence of such code Defendants DNC and Schultz, in her
capacity as Chairman of the DNC, would still be free to send certifications to the Tennessee
Secretary of State notifying him that the DNC has selected candidate Obama as the Democratic
Party’s Presidential candidate and certifying that he is constitutionally qualified to hold that
office.
In fact, the allegations contained within Plaintiffs’ complaint are based upon past actions
taken by Defendants DNC and past Chairmen of the DNC. In 2008 the DNC sent a document to
the Tennessee Secretary of State notifying the State that the Democratic Party had selected
candidate Obama as the Democratic Party’s Presidential candidate for the 2008 Presidential
general election. Attached as Ex. 2.
Also, during pre-litigation research performed by Liberty Legal Foundation (“LLF”) a
staffer working for the Tennessee Secretary of State discussed at length the process followed by
the State and confirmed that any certification from the DNC stating that Mr. Obama is the
Democratic Party’s selected candidate would result in candidate Obama’s name appearing on
Tennessee ballots, absent a specific objection from the TNDP.

15 of 17

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 19 Filed 05/03/12 Page 16 of 17

PageID 174

With all this in mind, it is clear that this Court would be unable to provide effective relief
absent inclusion of Defendants DNC and Schultz in the instant litigation. Defendants’ motion is
an attempt to avoid the authority of this Court by ensuring that even if a judgment is entered
against the TNDP, candidate Obama will still appear on the Tennessee ballot. If the DNC and
Schultz are dismissed they will send the fraudulent certification to the Tennessee Secretary of
State despite an ultimate judgment of this Court against the TNDP. The Secretary of State would
then be left with a certification from the DNC and silence from the TNDP. Such a circumstance
would almost certainly result in candidate Obama appearing on the Tennessee ballot.
This conclusion is supported by the fact that if Defendants DNC and Schultz did not
intend to send any certifying documents to Tennessee Secretary of State, these Defendants
should be willing to have this Court enter an agreed judgment prohibiting them from sending any
such documents. If they have no intention of sending such documents, such an agreed judgment
would not prejudice them in any way and would relieve them of further litigation in this case.
The only reason for the DNC to refuse to agree to such a judgment is for the DNC to retain its
ability to thwart a judgment by this Court against the Democratic Party.
Taking the “pleadings and submissions in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs and
views any disputed facts in plaintiffs’ favor,” it is clear that Defendants DNC and its Chairman
have acted in the past and are certain to perform acts this Fall that avail them of the personal
jurisdiction of this Court. Theunissen, 935 F.2d at 1459.
The Defendants’ motion to dismiss Defendants DNC and Shultz “because they are not
responsible,” must be DENIED.

IX.

Conclusion
For the reasons set forth herein, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss must be DENIED.
