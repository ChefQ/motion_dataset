Civil Action No. 3:12cv97 (REP)

CORELOGIC, INC., et al.
Defendants.
DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF THEIR
MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendants, CoreLogic, Inc. and CoreLogic National Background Data, LLC f/k/a
National Background Data, LLC (“NBD”, and when combined with CoreLogic, Inc., collectively
referred to as “CoreLogic,”), by counsel, and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), submit the
following memorandum in support of their Motion to Dismiss Count I of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
INTRODUCTION
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) authorizes the sale of public record information
by one “consumer reporting agency” (“CRA”) to another type of CRA known as “reseller,”
which, in turn, can supply the information to “users,” such as employers considering a job
application by a “consumer.” Hence, the FCRA contemplates and allows a chain of sale of data,
from one CRA to another, before the ultimate sale to a user. During this process, the FCRA, in §
1681k(a), imposes a duty to send a notice to the consumer on the CRA that ultimately supplies
public record information to an end user (i.e., prospective employer) that could have an adverse
impact on a job applicant.

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 2 of 26 PageID# 40

In this case, Plaintiff has alleged that CoreLogic, a CRA, sold public record information
concerning Plaintiff to another CRA, Verifications, Inc., a “reseller.” The data was then supplied
by Verifications, Inc. to its customer, Interstate Brands Corporation, which used the information
in making an employment decision about Plaintiff.
Based on these facts, Plaintiff makes an unprecedented claim against CoreLogic; namely,
that when one CRA sells the information to another CRA, which then resells the public record
information to a user, that 15 U.S.C. § 1681k(a)(1) requires both of the CRAs to send the notice
to the consumer, even though it is only the reseller that supplies any information to the user.
More specifically, Plaintiff claims that when Verifications, Inc. sold data to Interstate Brands,
both CoreLogic and Verifications were required under § 1681k(a)(1) to send entirely duplicate
notices to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s claim against CoreLogic is unprecedented for a reason: the plain language of
15 U.S.C. § 1681k(a) imposes no duty on a CRA which sells information to another CRA to send
a redundant § 1681k(a) notice. Section 1681k(a)(1)’s notification requirements are triggered
only when consumer information is provided by a consumer reporting agency for “employment
purposes” to the “user” of that data. See id. The sale at issue here meets neither such criterion
for liability.
Furthermore, even if the Court were to conclude that CoreLogic did somehow technically
violate § 1681k(a)(1), Plaintiff has failed to allege that any such violation was “willful” as a
matter of law, as he cannot show that CoreLogic’s conduct was “objectively unreasonable” – the
test for willfulness established by the United States Supreme Court for FCRA cases in Safeco
Insurance Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 69 (2007). Thus, Plaintiff’s conclusory – and
factually barred - assertion that CoreLogic “willfully” violated § 1681k(a)(1) under Count I must

2

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 3 of 26 PageID# 41

be rejected and any claim of “willfulness” under that claim dismissed with prejudice. And, with
no plausible claim of willfulness alleged, and no claim of “actual damages” having been asserted
by Plaintiff under Count I, Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the violation asserted under Count I.
STATEMENT OF ALLEGATIONS
The allegations of the Complaint, as related to the contentions of this Motion to Dismiss,
are as follows. Plaintiff alleges that CoreLogic, Inc. is the parent company of NBD. (Compl., ¶
9).1 CoreLogic, Inc. and NBD are “wholesale” data providers to “the background screening
industry” that “sell criminal and employment-purposed background checks solely on a wholesale
basis.” Id. at ¶¶ 10, 12. CoreLogic, Inc. and NBD “disburse consumer reports to third parties
under contract” for compensation. Id. at ¶ 16.
Plaintiff alleges that in August and September 2009, he applied for a job with Interstate
Brands Corporation (“Interstate”). Id. at ¶ 21. On November 5, 2009, Interstate engaged the
third-party consumer reporting agency and “reseller” Verifications, Inc. (“Verifications”) to
conduct a background check on Plaintiff. Id. at ¶ 22. “Immediately thereafter,” Verifications
ordered a background report from CoreLogic, which was subsequently provided to Verifications.
Id. at ¶ 23. The background report that was furnished by CoreLogic to Verifications regarding
Plaintiff allegedly contained a record of a criminal conviction from Pennsylvania. Id. at ¶ 26.
Plaintiff alleges that this conviction was not attributable to him, but rather to an unrelated
consumer with a similar name. Id. at 27.

“It is a general principle of corporate law deeply ingrained in our economic and legal systems that a
parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of another corporation’s stock) is not
liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.” United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 61 (1998). Plaintiff
disregards this time-honored principle by simply lumping together CoreLogic, Inc. and NBD in his
factual allegations. Indeed, the facts alleged in the Complaint against CoreLogic, Inc. do not even come
close to satisfying the rigorous standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Twombly and Iqbal to
plausibly establish how CoreLogic, Inc. violated the FCRA as to Plaintiff. The evidence will show that
CoreLogic, Inc. has been improperly named as a Defendant. CoreLogic reserves its rights to move for the
dismissal of CoreLogic, Inc. as a Defendant on this basis at the appropriate procedural juncture.

Filed 05/03/12 Page 4 of 26 PageID# 42

Plaintiff alleges that, “[as] soon as Verifications received the CoreLogic report, it placed
same within an online consumer report regarding the Plaintiff [that was] provided to
[Interstate].”

Id. at ¶ 28.

Plaintiff further alleges that “[w]hile [the] report [provided by

Verifications to Interstate] did not contain the details of the Pennsylvania convictions, it did
report that the Plaintiff’s history has come back with these ‘Hits’ in a search of his national
criminal background.” Id. Plaintiff contends that, as a result of the consumer report provided to
Interstate by Verifications, Interstate withdrew its offer of employment to him. Id. at ¶ 29.
There is no allegation that CoreLogic ever had any direct or indirect communications with
Interstate. See id. Rather, the Complaint makes clear that CoreLogic, as a “wholesaler” of
information, provided information only to Verifications, which acted as a “reseller” of that data
to Interstate. Id. at ¶ 20.
Plaintiff alleges that he never received a letter or any other communication from
CoreLogic at the time that the CoreLogic report was sent to Verifications in late 2009. Id. at ¶
33. Plaintiff further alleges that he also never received any communication from Verifications at
the time that his report was furnished by Verifications directly to Interstate.2 Id. at ¶ 34.
On the basis of these allegations, Plaintiff asserts three claims against CoreLogic. Count
I of the Complaint, which is the subject of this motion, alleges that CoreLogic failed to “timely
provide the required FCRA notices to the Plaintiff” in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1681k(a)(1) of the
FCRA. Id. at ¶ 55. Section 1681k(a) provides, in pertinent part:
A consumer reporting agency which furnishes a consumer report for
employment purposes and which for that purpose compiles and reports items of
information on consumers which are matters of public record and are likely to
have an adverse effect upon a consumer’s ability to obtain employment shall—
2

Plaintiff has also filed related actions against Verifications and Interstate, which assert overlapping
claims under the FCRA with respect to the claim pled in this action, as well as other FCRA claims. See
3:11cv514 (action against Verifications); 3:11cv507 (action against Interstate).

(1) at the time such public record information is reported to the user of
such consumer report, notify the consumer of the fact that public record
information is being reported by the consumer reporting agency, together
with the name and address of the person to whom such information is
being reported; or
(2) maintain strict procedures designed to insure that whenever public
record information which is likely to have an adverse effect on a
consumer’s ability to obtain employment is reported it is complete and up
to date.
Id. (emphases added). Plaintiff asserts this claim on the basis of a putative nationwide class of
consumers relative to whom CoreLogic allegedly did not place in the mail “a written notice that
[CoreLogic was] furnishing the subject report and containing the name of the person that was to
receive the report.” Id. at ¶ 47. Without any accompanying factual support, Plaintiff alleges that
this violation of § 1681k(a) by CoreLogic was “willful,” thereby entitling him to “statutory and
punitive damages.” Id. at ¶ 56.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
When considering a motion to dismiss, the Court should accept as true all well-pleaded
factual allegations and should view the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. See
De Sole v. United States, 947 F.2d 1169, 1171 (4th Cir. 1991). Even under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a),
however, the Court need not accept as true the legal conclusions, unwarranted inferences,
unreasonable conclusions, or arguments asserted in the complaint. See Eastern Shore Mkts., Inc.
v. J.D. Assocs. Ltd. P’Ship, 213 F.3d, 175, 180 (4th Cir. 2000); Edwards v. City of Goldsboro,
178 F.3d 231, 244 (4th Cir. 1999). Furthermore, a “pleading that offers ‘legal conclusions’ or ‘a
formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.’” Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).
“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,
accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949

5

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 6 of 26 PageID# 44

(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (pleading must contain a
“short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief”). A claim is
“factually plausible” when the claimant pleads “factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at
1949. “[A] court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings
that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.” Id.
at 1950. If any factual allegations remain, the Court then should review them to determine if a
plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for relief. Id.
Furthermore, “[p]ursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), a claim may be dismissed for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction.” Wollman v. Geren, 603 F. Supp. 2d 879, 883 (E.D. Va. 2009). CoreLogic
contends that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring his claim under Count I. “Because standing is an
element of subject matter jurisdiction, a defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing
should be treated under Rule 12(b)(1).” McInnes v. Lord Balt. Emple. Ret. Income Acct. Plan,
2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130512, at *4 (D. Md. Nov. 10, 2011). In such a situation, “the burden
of proving subject matter jurisdiction falls on the plaintiff.” Wollman, 603 F. Supp. 2d at 883.
ARGUMENT
For any potential liability to attach under § 1681k(a)(1), the sale of consumer information
at issue must be both to the “user” of that information and for “employment purposes.” The sale
of data from CoreLogic to Verifications meets neither of these conjunctive requirements for a
viable claim under that provision of the FCRA. Thus, for the reasons set forth in detail below,
Count I must be dismissed.
Moreover, given the compelling textual argument in favor of dismissal of Count I, as well
as the lack of any contrary authority in favor of Plaintiff’s misguided position, even if liability

6

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 7 of 26 PageID# 45

were possible under Count I, no violation of § 1681k(a)(1) can be deemed to have been “willful”
as a matter of law, and any such claim must also be dismissed. Additionally, the lack of any
“willful” violation, along with Plaintiff’s failure to allege any “actual damages” arising out of
Count I, means that Plaintiff has no standing to assert the claims alleged.
I.

PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER COUNT I, AS
CORELOGIC NEVER PROVIDED A CONSUMER REPORT “FOR
EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES” TO A “USER.”

Plaintiff’s claim under Count I is based on § 1681k(a)(1), which imposes a duty on CRAs
to send a notice to the consumer if the information is furnished “for employment purposes” to a
“user” and that information is likely to have “adverse impact” on the consumer’s “ability to
obtain employment.” 15 U.S.C. § 1681k(a)(1). Specifically, § 1681k(a)(1) requires, “at the time
such public record information is reported to the user of such consumer report,” that the CRA
reporting such information for employment purposes “notify the consumer of the fact that public
record information is being reported by the consumer reporting agency[.]” Id. (emphasis added).
In this case, CoreLogic provided information to Verifications, another CRA that Plaintiff
acknowledges was a “reseller” of information, and which provided the data to Interstate. See
Compl., ¶ 22. Thus, to hold CoreLogic liable under § 1681k(a)(1), Plaintiff must establish that
CoreLogic was furnishing information to a “user” for “employment purposes.” Plaintiff cannot
make either such showing, which would be at odds with the plain language of the FCRA, Federal
Trade Commission interpretation of the FCRA, persuasive authority, and the carefully-delineated
duties of users and CRAs under the FCRA. Thus, Plaintiff’s claim in Count I must be dismissed.
A.

Verifications is not a “user” under the FCRA, and therefore CoreLogic was
not furnishing information to a “user.”

While the FCRA uses the term “user” repeatedly, there is no express definition of that
term in the FCRA. Context, however, affirms the plain meaning of the term and indicates that a

7

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 8 of 26 PageID# 46

“user” for purposes of § 1681k is the person who actually uses the data in making a credit,
employment, or insurance decision affecting the consumer. Verifications falls outside of this
meaning of the term “user,” and therefore CoreLogic did not furnish a consumer report to a
“user” for the purposes of creating potential liability under § 1681k(a)(1).
1.

The provisions of the FCRA.

As a threshold matter, there is no express requirement in the FCRA, whether in §
1681k(a)(1) or elsewhere, requiring a CRA selling data to a reseller to provide notice to the
consumer under that provision. Plaintiff thus seeks to read into the statute a requirement that has
no firm basis in its text. This result should be avoided. See, e.g., Dugdale v. Nationwide Mut.
Fire Ins. Co., No. 4:05cv138, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17471, at *12 (E.D. Va. Feb. 14, 2006)
(“[T]his court declines to read into the statute words that are not there.”).
The other provisions of the FCRA also bear out this conclusion in numerous provisions.
For example, 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(1) of the FCRA requires that “users” certify to the CRA from
which a report for employment purposes is obtained, that the user has provided certain
disclosures to the consumer, and that “the consumer has authorized in writing . . . the
procurement of the report by that person.” Id. In short, that section contemplates direct contact
between the user and the consumer, such as a potential employer/employee relationship, where
consent may be obtained from the consumer. As the Complaint makes clear, only Interstate had
any direct contact with Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶ 9). Thus, Verifications, as a “reseller,” had no such
contact with Plaintiff such that its provision of these required assurances under the FCRA to
CoreLogic would have even been possible. (See Compl., ¶ 34).
Likewise, 15 U.S.C. § 1681m imposes requirements on “users taking adverse actions on
basis of information contained in consumer reports.” Id. Again, this section contemplates a

8

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 9 of 26 PageID# 47

direct link between the consumer and the user of the information, the latter of which is in a
position to take adverse action – including employment decisions – against the consumer.
Verifications was not in a position to take any action – adverse or otherwise – against Plaintiff,
neither has Plaintiff alleged that Verifications has taken such action. Thus, it was not a “user.”
Notably, Plaintiff does not allege any direct contact between CoreLogic and Interstate,3
and the lack of any direct contact between CoreLogic and Interstate underscores the illogical,
practical implications of imposing potential liability on CoreLogic under § 1681k(a)(1).
CoreLogic would be in no position to actually assess whether any of the information it provided
to Verifications would ultimately be reported to Interstate, and it would therefore be unable to
determine whether any such information would have an “adverse impact” on Plaintiff’s “ability
to obtain employment.” There is no allegation that CoreLogic was privy to any restrictions
imposed by Interstate (such as any direction to include or exclude certain records from the
report), such that CoreLogic would know whether the information it provided would ultimately
be transmitted to Interstate, and not just filtered out by Verifications. And, given the widelydivergent state laws regarding whether certain information can even be reported to a prospective
employer in that state, see, e.g., California Civil Code § 1786.16(a) (limiting the provision of
certain background data to information generated within seven years preceding the request),
CoreLogic would not know whether the information that it provided to Verifications would have
an “adverse impact” on Plaintiff’s employment prospects.
Returning to the text of the FCRA, the same result is compelled by the language of §
1681c(1)(h)(1)(B), which provides: “No prospective user of a consumer report or of a credit
score generated using the information in the file of a consumer that includes an extended fraud
alert in accordance with this section may establish a new credit plan or extension of credit . . . . ”
3

In fact, Plaintiff alleges that NBD does not sell directly to the client. (Compl., ¶ 12).

9

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 10 of 26 PageID# 48

Id. Again, the language of the FCRA contemplates that the “user” be in a position to take some
form of action against the consumer. See id.; see also 15 U.S.C. § 1681h(e) (“no consumer may
bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation . . . based on information disclosed by
a user of a consumer report to or for a consumer against whom the user has taken adverse
action.”) (emphasis added). Plaintiff’s Complaint makes no allegation that Verifications took an
adverse action against Plaintiff, presumably because Verifications, as a reseller of data, was not
in such a position.
Furthermore, the terms “consumer reporting agency” and “user” have distinct meanings
and responsibilities under the FCRA. Prior to the provision’s amendment in 1996, 15 U.S.C. §
1681n provided that civil liability could be imposed on “[a]ny consumer reporting agency or
user of information which willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this
title.” Id. (emphasis added). This disjunctive provision was later amended into its current form
to also subject “furnishers” of consumer information to civil liability through the use of the
more-inclusive term “person.” See, e.g., Ayers v. Equifax Info. Servs., No. 3:03cv551, 2003 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 23271, at *11 (E.D. Va. Dec. 16, 2003) (“Prior to amendment in 1996, sections
1681n and 1681o permitted suit against a consumer reporting agency or a user of information,
but not against a furnisher. After the statute was amended, ‘any person’ could be sued . . . .
[S]ince credit reporting agencies and users were already liable to consumers, Congress intended,
by the amendment language ‘any person,’ to enlarge the statute to include furnishers.”).
Nonetheless, the clear statutory distinction between “users” and “credit reporting agencies”
previously specified in § 1681n underscores that Plaintiffs’ conflation of these terms under §
1681k(a)(1) is improper and contrary to what Congress intended.

See also Boatner v.

Choicepoint Workplace Solutions, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44264, at *7 (D. Or. May 6,

2010) (“[T]he FCRA imposes different responsibilities based on whether a party is a user . . . or
CRA” and a user’s duty is largely independent of the duties of the CRA. This statutory scheme,
which allocates independent obligations among the many parties involved in the consumer credit
reporting process, shows no legislative intent to hold . . . CRAs liable for the actions of users.”).
2.

Persuasive judicial authority confirms the result required by the FCRA.

Consistent with the provisions detailed above, the courts interpreting the definition of
“user” under the FCRA, including those within the Fourth Circuit, make plain that a “user” of
information is the entity that has the authority to take some action affecting the consumer’s
interests. For instance, in Lema v. Citibank, N.A., 935 F. Supp. 695 (D. Md. 1996), the court
considered an allegation that the “defendants reported information obtained through their
transactions with plaintiff to a consumer reporting agency.” Id. at 698. Because there was no
allegation that the defendants themselves took any adverse action against the plaintiff, the court
held that the defendants are “not users of information for purposes of the FCRA.” Id.; compare
Austin v. Bankamerica Service Corp., 419 F. Supp. 730, 731, 733 (N.D. Ga. 1974) (a defendant
who denied the plaintiff credit on the basis of information obtained in a consumer report was a
“user” for purposes of the FCRA).
Similarly, in Alvarez Melendez v. Citibank, 705 F. Supp. 67 (D.P.R. 1988), the court held
that a defendant who merely furnished information to third parties regarding plaintiff’s credit
history “was not a user of consumer reports for the purpose of establishing civil liability under
the FCRA.” Id. at 69. The same result was reached in Jones v. Smith-McKinney Co., No. 04-cv80, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29761 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 18, 2004), where the court held as follows:
“Plaintiff has not alleged that McClish denied credit or increased rates as a result of information
contained in a consumer report. Based upon these facts, the plaintiff has not alleged facts which

11

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 12 of 26 PageID# 50

establish liability [as a user] under the FCRA.” Id. at *23-24. And, in sharp contrast, no court
has ever embraced the interpretation of the FCRA advanced by Plaintiff under Count I.
Plaintiff has not alleged that Verifications took, or was in any position to take, any direct
action against Plaintiff due to the information that was contained in his consumer report. Thus,
under the above authority, Verifications was not a “user” under the FCRA. Count I must be
dismissed.
3.

Federal Trade Commission guidance also demonstrates that Verifications
was not a “user” of consumer information.

The conclusion demanded by both the text of the FCRA and persuasive authority is
buttressed by the interpretative guidance provided by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
In interpreting the FCRA,4 the FTC has confirmed that a CRA must notify the consumer only
when such information “is provided to an employer or potential employer,” indicating that “user”
refers to the employer that ultimately uses the information to make its employment decision. See

available

at

http://www.ftc.gov/os/2011/07/110720fcrareport.pdf (hereinafter, “FTC, 40 Years of Experience,
at __”), attached as Exhibit A. Consistent with this view, the FTC requires that CRAs that
provide reports for employment purposes must notify consumers under § 1681k(a)(1), “even if
they are merely resellers of consumer reports obtained from other CRAs.” Id. at 81. This
requirement ensures that any CRA – whether it is a reseller or not – that provides a consumer
report to a user of that information must comply with § 1681k, and thus guarantees that one CRA

4

The FTC’s interpretation of its regulations is “controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with
the regulation[s] or there is any other reason to doubt that they reflected the [FTC’s] fair and considered
judgment.” Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing, 131 S. Ct. 2567, 2575 (2011).

12

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 13 of 26 PageID# 51

will always have a duty to send the required notice.5 No similar requirement is imposed on the
CRAs who provide such reports to a reseller, and with good reason – such a notice would be
completely redundant of the notices that already must indisputably be sent by the CRA dealing
directly with the user.
In short, Verifications was reseller, not a user, under the FCRA, and therefore CoreLogic
had no duty under § 1681k(a) to provide notice to the Plaintiff, as CoreLogic was not furnishing
information to a “user.” Therefore, Count I must be dismissed.
B.

CoreLogic did not provide information for an “employment purpose.”

Another reason why the FCRA does not impose the notice requirement on CRAs
supplying reports to resellers is because such reports are not provided to the reseller for an
“employment purpose,” as is required to trigger § 1681k(a). As the FTC explains, “[a] CRA
may furnish a consumer report to another CRA, so that the second CRA can sell such reports to
subscribers with a permissible purpose.” FTC, 40 Years of Experience, at 41. Thus, the FTC
does not look to whether the second CRA itself has permissible purpose, but whether the second
CRA is ultimately providing reports to end users with a permissible purpose.6 The fact that the
FTC treats CRA-to-CRA sales in this manner demonstrates that the FTC recognizes that such
transactions are not for “employment purposes,” which would itself be a permissible purpose
under the FCRA. 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a)(3)(b).

5

Indeed, in a related action, Plaintiff has pled an identical claim under § 1681k(a)(1) against
Verifications. See 3:11cv514 (Dkt. No. 20, Count I), attached as Exhibit B.
6

The FCRA does require that consumer reports to users only issue for certain permissible purposes. 15
U.S.C. § 1681b(a). Thus, the FTC explains that the CRA providing information to another CRA “must
comply with FCRA requirements to implement reasonable policies and procedures to limit the
distribution of consumer reports to those with permissible purposes.” Id. at 41. Thus, even though the
CRA-to-CRA exchange itself does not fall under any permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a),
that transaction is nonetheless permissible as long as the supplying CRA ensures that the subsequent user
of the consumer report is operating under a permissible purpose.

13

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 14 of 26 PageID# 52

Other provisions of the FCRA also counsel strongly in favor of the proposition that the
sale by a CRA to a reseller is not for an employment purpose. For example, as described above,
a user that seeks to obtain a consumer report for “employment purposes” must certify to the CRA
that it has made the required disclosures to the consumer and obtained the consumer’s consent.
See 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(b)(1). Therefore, if, unlike the FTC’s interpretation, the reseller’s
acquisition of the data from the wholesaler CRA was considered an employment purpose, then
the reseller also would need to make disclosures to and obtain consent from the consumer –
purely redundant steps that would already have been taken by the employer.
In fact, Plaintiff’s strained reading of § 1681k(a)(1) builds in several redundant steps to
the consumer reporting process under that provision that are not contemplated by the express
terms of the FCRA or FTC regulations and guidelines. To wit, under Plaintiffs’ theory, each
time that a user sought a consumer report for an employment purpose, every CRA that had ever
touched the information contained in that report – from the moment that information had been
retrieved from the public record – would have to obtain consent from the consumer and ensure
that certain disclosures had been provided to the consumer. Assuming all of these CRAs had
successfully accomplished that purported duty, each of them would then have to send an
identical notice under § 1681k to the consumer, notwithstanding the fact that the information in
each report could vary. Indeed, there is no conceptual limit to the number of redundant notices
that would be required under the interpretation of the FCRA advanced by Plaintiff in Count I.
This result should be avoided. See, e.g., Flint v. California, 594 F. Supp. 443, 447-48 (E.D. Cal.
1984) (declining to interpret 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) to require notice of right to sue from both
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the United States Attorney General,
because such a reading would require “redundant notices” and “the words of the statute and

common sense suggest another and better reading of the statute”); United States v. Carroll, 105
F.3d 740, 744 (1st Cir. 1997) (“[S]tatutes should be construed in a commonsense manner,
honoring plain meaning, and avoiding absurd or counterintuitive results.”)
Not only would this extremely redundant conception of FCRA notice, disclosure, and
consent requirements bring the entire process of consumer reporting to a crawl, but as noted
above, such redundancies are at odds with the specialized and contrasting duties of the various
constituents of the credit reporting process. Plaintiff’s position would render all CRAs “users”
and destroy the carefully-compartmentalized statutory treatment of CRAs under the FCRA.
Plaintiff’s claim under § 1681k(a)(1) must be dismissed.
II.

THERE WAS NO WILLFUL VIOLATION OF § 1681K(A)(1).

The FCRA provides that civil liability can only be imposed against a defendant in two
circumstances. The first avenue for liability is found in 15 U.S.C. § 1681n – “Civil liability for
willful noncompliance.” That provision states that “[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply”
with the FCRA is subject to actual or statutory damages, and potentially punitive damages. Id.
The second avenue for relief is provided in 15 U.S.C § 1681o – “Civil liability for negligent
noncompliance.” According to that provision, “[a]ny person who is negligent in failing to
comply” with the FCRA may be subject to actual damages only. Id. Importantly, these are the
only two avenues through which a defendant may be found civilly liable for an FCRA violation.
Here, Plaintiff has not alleged that he suffered any actual damages as a result of the
alleged violation of § 1681k(a)(1), and only asserts a claim for a “willful” violation. In light of
the foregoing statutory arguments, and as interpreted by the authority below, regardless of the
Court’s determination of whether CoreLogic committed any technical violation of § 1681k(a)(1),
any such violation was not “willful” as a matter of law.

In the wake of Safeco, the Complaint fails to plausibly allege that CoreLogic
willfully violated § 1681k(a)(1).

Although Plaintiff makes conclusory allegations of willfulness throughout the Complaint,
he fails to plausibly allege willfulness with respect to Count I. Recently, the Supreme Court
established a very high and objective threshold on what a plaintiff must show in order to prevail
on a willfulness claim under the FCRA – a burden Plaintiff has failed to meet. See Safeco
Insurance Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47 (2007).
In Safeco, the Supreme Court considered whether the defendant insurance companies
willfully violated the FCRA by not providing adverse action notices to applicants whose
insurance premium rates were higher than those offered to other applicants with the best possible
credit scores. Id. at 65. The FCRA requires insurance companies to provide adverse action
notices to applicants whose charge for insurance was “increased” based in whole, or in part, on
consumer report information. Id.; see also 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681m(a), 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i). Because
the word “increased,” as used in the FCRA’s definition of “adverse action” for insurance
purposes, was undefined, the Court interpreted the term to mean that an applicant receives a
higher insurance premium rate based, in whole or in part, on the applicant’s consumer report.
Safeco, 551 U.S. at 68. For one of the defendant insurers, Safeco, the Court explained that if
Safeco had used the applicants’ consumer reports to charge a higher premium rate, Safeco would
have taken adverse action, and it would have been an FCRA violation for Safeco to have failed
to provide the affected applicants with an adverse action notice. Id.
The Court then considered the standard for whether a defendant “willfully” violates the
FCRA, including whether “willfulness” also includes “recklessness.” Id. at 52. While it held
that the former encompassed the latter, the Court also concluded that this willfulness standard is
not met “unless the action is not only a violation [of the FCRA] under a reasonable reading of the

16

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 17 of 26 PageID# 55

statute’s terms, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater
than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.” Id. at 69. In order to overcome
this hurdle, it is the plaintiff’s burden to prove that a defendant’s attempts to comply with the
FCRA were “objectively unreasonable.” Id. Consequently, the “a violation does not cross the
willfulness threshold just because a defendant’s interpretation is erroneous; it must instead be
‘objectively unreasonable.’” Long v. Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc., 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 1269,
at *12 (3d Cir. Jan. 24, 2012) (citing Safeco, 551 U.S. at 69); see also Singleton v. Domino’s
Pizza, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8626, at *33-34 (D. Md. Jan. 25, 2012) (“[U]nless the
defendant’s interpretation of the statute is objectively unreasonable, a plaintiff will be unable to
show that the defendant willfully violated the FCRA.”).
In other words, to prevail on an FCRA claim of willfulness, the plaintiff must allege that
the defendant’s conduct created an “unjustifiably high risk” of violating the statute. Safeco, 551
U.S. at 70. To this end, in Safeco, the Court discussed two factors that are pertinent in analyzing
whether a company’s interpretation of the FCRA is “objectively unreasonable.” First, the Court
considered the clarity of the statutory text with respect to the challenged conduct. Specifically,
the Court held that if a company’s reading of the FCRA “has a foundation in the statutory text,”
e.g., if the relevant statutory provision is “less-than-pellucid,” that fact favors a finding that the
company acted reasonably and not willfully. Id. at 69-70; see also WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW
INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY, 978 (2002) (defining “pellucid” as: “extremely easy to understand;
readily intelligible or comprehensible; completely lacking in ambiguity or turgidity.”)
Second, the Court evaluated the amount of relevant judicial or agency guidance available
to the company to aid its efforts to interpret the relevant FCRA provision. In particular, the
Court stressed that it was “not a case in which the business subject to the Act had the benefit of

17

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 18 of 26 PageID# 56

guidance from the courts of appeals or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that might have
warned it away from the view it took. Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken on the
issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the FTC.” Id. at 70. This “dearth of
guidance,” along with the FCRA’s “less-than-pellucid statutory text,” persuaded the Safeco
Court to conclude that “Safeco’s reading [of the FCRA] was not objectively unreasonable, and
so falls well short of raising the ‘unjustifiably high risk’ of violating the statute necessary for
reckless liability.” Id. (emphasis added).
The Safeco Court summed up its guidance on the FCRA willfulness issue as follows:
“Where, as here, the statutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow for more than
one reasonable interpretation, it would defy history and current thinking to treat a defendant who
merely adopts one such interpretation as a knowing or reckless violator. Congress could not
have intended such a result for those who followed an interpretation that could reasonably have
found support in the courts, whatever their subjective intent may have been.” Id. at 70 n.20.
And, under such circumstances, the Court held that there was “no need for [the Ninth Circuit] to
remand the case for factual development” because evidence concerning the “subjective bad
faith” of the defendant was irrelevant when “the statutory text and relevant court and agency
guidance allow for more than one reasonable interpretation.” Id.; see also Levine v. World Fin.
Network Nat’l Bank, 554 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir. 2009) (“What matters under Safeco is the
text of the Act and authoritative interpretations of that text.”) (citations omitted).7

7

In this sense, the inquiry under Safeco is highly-akin to the analysis of whether a state official is subject
to qualified immunity from an asserted violation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See,
e.g., Wiley v. Doory, 14 F.3d 993, 995 (4th Cir. 1994) (“Qualified immunity shields a governmental
official from liability for civil monetary damages if the officer’s conduct does not violate clearly
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”). In that
context, it is settled that the issue of immunity can be decided on a motion to dismiss so that the court is
not burdened with a costly and wasteful litigation process. See Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991).
Likewise, the inquiry is one of “objective legal reasonableness,” which is a question of law for the court

18

The application of Safeco to the allegations pled under Count I.

When conducting an analysis parallel to the one conducted by the Court in Safeco, it is
evident that Plaintiff cannot carry his burden to demonstrate that any violation by CoreLogic
under Count I was “objectively unreasonable” and/or involved an “unjustifiably high risk” of
violating the FCRA. See, e.g., Fuges v. Southwest Fin. Servs., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134779, at
*17-18 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2011).
In the present case, like in Safeco, the term “user” of consumer information is not defined
anywhere in the FCRA. See 15 U.S.C. § 1681a. Also, like in Safeco, no judicial decisions, let
alone any decisions from any binding “court of appeals, id. at 70, have considered the issue of
whether a consumer reporting agency that is independently contracted to provide consumer data
to a reseller of that data is providing data to a “user” of that information such that the notification
requirements of § 1681k(a)(1) are then triggered. Both of these facts counsel strongly against a
finding of willfulness. See, e.g., Goode v. LexisNexis Risk & Info. Analytics Grp., 2012 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 39863, at *27-28 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 23, 2012) (finding no willful violation, “especially
given that no court of appeals had spoken on the issue”) (citing Safeco). Indeed, this “dearth of
guidance,” Safeco, 551 at 70, is also confirmed by the “FTC, 40 Years of Experience” report,
which summarizes literally hundreds of cases, formal agency interpretations, and FTC opinion
letters. Nothing in the 110-page report comes close to suggesting anything that “might have
warned [CoreLogic] away from” the overly-rigid and hyper-technical stance of the FCRA
advanced in Count I of the Complaint. Safeco, 551 U.S. at 70. Furthermore, for the reasons set

to decide. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987); see also Brown v. Mitchell, 327 F. Supp. 2d
615, 649 (E.D. Va. 2004) (“clearly established” means that, in light of preexisting law, “the unlawfulness
of the official’s conduct was reasonably and objectively apparent”). And, a defense of qualified
immunity may not be rebutted by evidence regarding a defendant’s intent. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U.S. 800, 812 (1982). All of these stringent principles similarly counsel in favor of the dismissal of
Plaintiff’s FCRA claim here.

19

forth in section I, supra, CoreLogic’s interpretation of the term “user” in § 1681k(a)(1) has a
strong (if not compelling) foundation in the statutory text.
Fundamentally, none of the objective indicia that the Court in Safeco used to determine
whether a willful violation of the FCRA is plausible are present here based on the “pellucid” text
of the FCRA. Based on these facts, and as set forth by the Court in Safeco, in no way can
CoreLogic’s alleged actions amount to an “objectively unreasonable” interpretation of §
1681k(a)(1). Therefore, the allegations of “willfulness” under Count I must be dismissed with
prejudice. See, e.g., Fuges, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134779, at *17-18 (“Here, given the FCRA’s
lack of clarity regarding whether the Act even covers companies such as Defendant Southwest
Financial Services, as well as the stunning paucity of guidance on the pertinent issues, no
reasonable jury could conclude that Southwest acted objectively unreasonably in determining
that the FCRA does not apply to its activities, in particular to its current owner reports such as
the one at issue in this matter.”); Simonoff v. Kaplan, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125414, *26
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2010) (granting a motion to dismiss due to a lack of willfulness because the
defendant’s interpretation of the FCRA was not objectively unreasonable, in part, because it “did
not have guidance from the courts of appeals nor from the FTC that might have discouraged it
from interpreting the statute as it did”).
C.

The judicial finding of a lack of any “willful” violation of § 1681k(a)(1) is
appropriate at this juncture.

Although Plaintiff may attempt to argue that dismissal of Counts I for a failure to plead
willfulness is premature at the 12(b)(6) stage, numerous authorities have reached the opposite
conclusion. While, in certain legal contexts, “the question of willfulness is an issue of fact for
the jury, . . . those cases usually involve questions of fact as to what the defendant knew at the
time of the alleged violation. That is not an issue in this case.” Goode, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

20

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 21 of 26 PageID# 59

39863, at 28 n.10. As established by Safeco, the question of willfulness in the context of the
FCRA violation alleged here “turns on whether the law was clear at the time of the alleged
violation.” Id. Thus, the issue is timely at the motion to dismiss stage. Id. (dismissing claim of
a willful violation of § 1681k(a)(1) on defendant’s motion to dismiss).
For example, in Long v. Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc., the plaintiff filed an action against
the defendant alleging that the defendant’s printing of a partially-redacted expiration date on his
on his receipt (i.e., “EXPIRY:04/##”) willfully violated the FCRA prohibition against publishing
the expiration date at the point of sale. 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 1269, at *2. On the defendants’
motion to dismiss, the district court concluded that “(1) printing the month of expiration,
standing alone, did not constitute the printing of an ‘expiration date’ under the statute, and (2) in
any event, [plaintiff] could not recover because the alleged violation was not ‘willful.’” Id. The
Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s willfulness claims on a
motion to dismiss. In doing so, the court stated that “[i]n light of Safeco, we conclude that
Hilfiger’s interpretation of the statute is not ‘objectively unreasonable’ and, thus, that Long has
not stated a claim for a willful violation of FACTA.” 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 1269 at *13.
Similarly, in Shlahtichman v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 615 F.3d 794 (7th Cir. 2010), the
Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a willfulness claim under under Rule 12(b)(6), holding:
We note finally that even if we have construed the statute too narrowly, dismissal
of [plaintiff’s] complaint was nevertheless appropriate because [defendant] did
not willfully violate the statute. [Plaintiff] has alleged no actual injury . . . and has
instead sought the statutory damages that are authorized for willful violations of
the truncation requirement . . . . To date, there has been no contrary opinion from
a court of appeals or federal agency suggesting that the company’s understanding
of the statute is wrong; and even if its construction of the statute turns out to be
mistaken, it is objectively reasonable nonetheless for all of the reasons we have
discussed. Consequently, if [defendant] did violate the statute by including the
expiration date of [plaintiff’s] credit card in the receipt it emailed to him, it did
not do so knowingly or recklessly.

Id. at 803-04; see also Simonoff, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125414, *26 (granting a motion to
dismiss FCRA claim due to a lack of willfulness); Goode, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39863, at *36
(“Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to demonstrate that such violation was willful”).
As shown by the cases above, Count I of the Complaint should be dismissed at this stage
of the litigation because Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege that CoreLogic willfully violated
the FCRA, and any such claim under Count I must be dismissed with prejudice.
D.

Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations of willfulness are legally insufficient.

Although academic in light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ claim for a “willful” violation of
the FCRA fails for yet another reason. As noted above, in the Complaint, without any factual
support, Plaintiff alleges that the alleged violation of § 1681k(a)(1) by CoreLogic was “willful.”
(Compl., ¶ 56). “To survive a motion to dismiss under Twombly, a complaint alleging gross
negligence and/or punitive damages must contain facts sufficient to show that the applicable
standards for recovery are plausibly met.” Stotesbury v. Pirate Duck Adventure, LLC, No. 3:11cv-18, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98130, at *10-11 (D.V.I. Aug. 30, 2011). Plaintiff’s claim for
punitive damages here, which is bereft of any facts, woefully fails to even attempt to satisfy this
burden. Hence, the alleged willful violation of § 1681k(a)(1) must be dismissed. See, e g., Odor
v. Wal-Mart Stores East, No. 10-287, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82571, at *5 (E.D. Ky. July 7,
2011) (dismissing claim for punitive damages because the “Plaintiff fail[ed] to provide any facts
to state a plausible claim that Defendant acted with any level of malice or ill will”).
III.

THE COURT MAY PROPERLY DISMISS COUNT I FOR FAILURE TO
PLEAD ACTUAL DAMAGES NECESSARY FOR A CLAIM OF
NEGLIGENT VIOLATION OF § 1681K(A)(1).

With no plausible claim of willful misconduct present, Count I must also be dismissed for
an additional reason.

Under Count I, Plaintiff seeks only punitive and statutory damages.

22

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Filed 05/03/12 Page 23 of 26 PageID# 61

(Compl., ¶ 56). While a claim for actual damages is alleged under other counts of the Complaint
(i.e., Count III), no such demand is made under Count I.
Without an allegation of actual damages, Plaintiff cannot succeed as a matter of law on a
claim of a negligent violation of § 1681k(a)(1), even if one were attempted to be asserted upon
amendment. See Banga v. NCUA, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93449, at *6 n.5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 6,
2009) (“Although FCRA also provides for a cause of action based on a negligent violation, such
cause of action requires a showing of actual damages.”); Pintos v. Pac. Creditors Ass’n, 2011
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41630, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 13, 2011) (“[F]or negligent violations, a
consumer may recover only actual damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees.”). Given the fact
that actual damages are a necessary element of a claim for negligent violation of the FCRA,
Plaintiff cannot prevail as a matter of law on any claims of negligence.8 Since Plaintiff is left
without any claim for a willful violation of the FCRA, as well as any claim for actual damages
that could plausibly support a claim for a negligent violation of Count I, that Count must be
dismissed with prejudice.
IV.

PLAINTIFF’S FAILURE TO ALLEGE AN ACTUAL INJURY-IN-FACT
DEPRIVES THE COURT OF ARTICLE III JURISDICTION OVER
COUNT I.

In this same vein, although Plaintiff cannot recover on Counts I because he has failed to
plausibly allege a willful violation of the FCRA or the actual damages necessary to support a
finding of negligence, Plaintiff’s Complaint must also be dismissed because of a more basic
deficiency. Namely, Plaintiff’s failure to allege an injury-in-fact strips the Court of subject
matter jurisdiction over Count I.

8

Given the entirely technical nature of the claim in Count I, it would be surprising indeed if Plaintiff
could, consistent with the strictures of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, make any claim of actual harm. In any event,
the phrase “actual damages,” or anything of a similar import, appears nowhere in Count I.

23

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 7

Article III of the United States Constitution provides that “judicial power” extends only
to “cases” and “controversies.” U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2. The Supreme Court enforces this
requirement by requiring that litigants have “standing to invoke the authority of a federal court.”
DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 (2006). To have standing, a plaintiff must
allege a “personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely
to be redressed by the requested relief.” Id. Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint has failed to allege a
“personal injury,” otherwise known as an “injury-in-fact” for the violation pled under Count I.
In order for an injury-in-fact to satisfy the Article III standing requirements, it must be
“concrete in both a qualitative and temporal sense.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155
(1990). That is to say, the injury must be “distinct and palpable” and not “conjectural” or
“hypothetical.” Id. Importantly, a litigant does not develop an injury-in-fact purely because
Congress authorizes a plaintiff to bring a suit based on a statutory violation. Raines v. Byrd, 521
U.S. 811, 820 n.3 (1997) (“Congress cannot erase Article III’s standing requirements by
statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.”). “For
‘although Congress may expand the definition of what constitutes an injury, essentially by
expanding the list of rights people enjoy, it may not eliminate the constitutional case or
controversy requirement.’” Morant v. Vaughn, No. 2:08cv155, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129417,
at *10-11 (E.D. Va. Jan. 8, 2009). “The ‘proper analysis of standing focuses on whether plaintiff
suffered an actual injury, not on whether a statute was violated.’” Id. at *11.9

9

Although the Supreme Court stated in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975), that “[t]he actual or
threatened injury required by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of “statutes creating legal rights, the
invasion of which creates standing,” subsequent cases have shown that Article III standing is not solely a
statutory question. As clarified by the Supreme Court in Lujan, the statement in Warth refers to
“Congress’ elevating to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that were
previously inadequate in law,” not the creation of de facto injuries out of thin air. See Lujan v. Defenders
of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 578 (1992) (emphasis in original). For Article III standing, there must exist
some injury-in-fact, separate and apart from the injury ordained by Congress.

Here, as discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to allege an actual injury under Count I.
Plaintiff has pled no actual damages in his Complaint under Count I, nor has he pled a manner in
which he was injured by the alleged violation of § 1681k(a)(1). While the FCRA may grant
plaintiffs the right to recover statutory damages, it cannot supplant the Constitution’s
requirement of an injury-in-fact. Since Plaintiff has failed to allege a distinct and palpable injury
aside from the violation of the statute itself, he has failed to present a case or controversy
sufficient to invoke Article III jurisdiction. Therefore, Count I must be dismissed.

WHEREFORE, Defendants, CoreLogic, Inc. and CoreLogic National Background Data,
