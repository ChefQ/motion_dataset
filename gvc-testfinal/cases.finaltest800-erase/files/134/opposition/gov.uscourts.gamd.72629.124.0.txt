UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA
ATHENS DIVISION
BASF AGRO B.V., MERIAL LIMITED,
and MERIAL SAS
Plaintiffs,

Civil Case No. 3:07-cv-00125-CDL

v.
CIPLA LIMITED, et al.,
Defendants, and
VELCERA, INC. and FIDOPHARM, INC.
Intervenors.

PLAINTIFFS MERIAL LIMITED AND MERIAL SAS’S
NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE RESPONSE TO
INTERVENORS VELCERA, INC. AND FIDOPHARM, INC.’S MOTION TO STAY
Plaintiffs Merial Limited and Merial SAS (collectively, “Merial”) hereby provide notice
of their intent to file a response to Intervenors Velcera, Inc. and FidoPharm, Inc.’s (collectively,
“Velcera’s”) Motion to Stay Damages and Sanctions Phase, which was filed after the close of
business on the day before the Thanksgiving holiday. Velcera’s latest Motion to Stay is merely a
rehash of the same motions to stay that were previously brought before, and denied by, both this
Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. As Merial will set forth in
its substantive response, a stay of these proceedings is not warranted. Merial intends to file its
response no later than Tuesday of next week.
