INTERVENORS VELCERA, INC.’S AND FIDOPHARM, INC.’S
BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR EMERGENCY MOTION TO STAY
DAMAGES PROCEEDINGS PENDING APPEAL OR
IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR AN EXTENSION OF
THE DISCOVERY PERIOD
I. INTRODUCTION
On January 11, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit will hear oral argument in the appeals of this Court’s June 21, 2011
contempt ruling (DE 75) (the “Contempt Order”). Between now and the
conclusion of the appeals, the parties in this case will conduct numerous fact
depositions, exchange expert reports, take and defend expert depositions,

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 2 of 22

litigate at least several discovery-related motions, brief and argue dispositive
motions, and prepare for and perhaps complete a bench trial. Along the
way, each party will likely incur additional legal fees and expenses
approaching, if not exceeding, $1 million. Simultaneously, Intervenors
Velcera, Inc. and FidoPharm, Inc. (collectively “Velcera”) will be defending
against a new trade dress infringement lawsuit and preliminary injunction
motion filed in this Court by Merial, Ltd. and Merial SAS (“Merial”).
Under these circumstances, an equitable stay of this case pending the
completion of the Federal Circuit appeal is warranted. District courts have
broad discretion to stay proceedings in the interest of conserving judicial and
party resources, and in the patent context, there is a strong policy in favor of
resolving liability appeals before damages are assessed. Here, the imminent
outcome of the appeals could entirely moot the ongoing damages
proceedings. With the appellate argument just seven weeks away, it makes
no sense for the parties to continue to engage in costly (and rapidly
escalating) litigation on damages issues, or for the Court to devote
substantial resources to deciding motions and conducting a trial.
Accordingly, Velcera respectfully requests that the Court stay the damages
and sanctions phase of this case pending resolution of Velcera’s appeal. In
the alternative, Velcera respectfully requests that the Court extend the
2

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 3 of 22

discovery period in the damages phase of this proceeding until sixty (60)
days after the Court rules on Velcera’s pending Motion to Compel (DE 121).
II. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND
In the Contempt Order, the Court ordered the seizure and destruction
of certain fipronil and s-methoprene containing products manufactured by
Defendant Cipla Limited (“Cipla”), permanently enjoined Velcera from
selling any such products in the United States, and indicated that it would
“conduct a hearing to determine an award to Merial for damages relating to
all sales committed in violation of the Court’s [prior injunction against
Cipla], including lost profits or a reasonable royalty for all sales.”
(Contempt Order at 46-48.) To “facilitate an immediate appeal” of the
Order, the Court directed that a final judgment be entered pursuant to Rule
54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Id. at 48). In addition, citing
“the potential immediate and serious impact of this Order on Cipla and
Velcera and the Court’s desire that they have an opportunity for meaningful
review,” the Court stayed enforcement of the Order for sixty (60) days.
(Id.).
On June 23, 2011, Velcera appealed the Contempt Order and
Judgment to the Federal Circuit. (DE 80). On the same day, Velcera moved
this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c) and Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1) to
3

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 4 of 22

extend the temporary stay pending review by the Federal Circuit. (DE 79).
On June 30, 2011, the Court denied Velcera’s motion. (DE 89). Velcera
then sought a stay of the Contempt Order and Judgment from the Federal
Circuit. (See Appellants’ Emergency Mot. to Stay Contempt Order and Inj.
Pending Appeal (Merial Ltd. v. Velcera, Inc.., Case Nos. 2011-1471, -1472
(Fed. Cir.) (“Fed. Cir. Appeal”), DE 31).) The Federal Circuit granted
Velcera’s motion in part and ordered that the portion of the Contempt Order
requiring the destruction of inventory be stayed during the pendency of the
appeal. (See Order dated August 17, 2011 (Fed. Cir. Appeal, DE 47).)1
The parties proceeded with merits briefing on the appeals, and on
November 21, 2011, the Federal Circuit issued an order scheduling the oral
argument for January 11, 2012. (Ex. A).
On October 3, 2011, this Court entered the damages and sanctions
phase scheduling order proposed by the parties (the “Scheduling Order”)
(DE 111). Under the current schedule, less than five weeks was allotted for

In the current Motion, Velcera does not seek to relitigate its previous
request for a stay. To the contrary, Velcera has fully complied with the
injunction by ceasing all sales of PetArmor® Plus and by isolating all
remaining inventory to prevent any further sale or distribution. Instead,
Velcera seeks a stay pursuant to settled case law that supports deferring
damages proceedings related to a pending liability appeal under a prudential
standard that is different and easier to meet than the standard governing
Velcera’s previous request to stay the Judgment pending appeal. (See Part
III(A) infra)).

depositions of fact witnesses, and the period for taking such depositions
closes on December 9, 2011. Expert discovery commences thereafter and
closes on January 20, 2012. Considering the complex and significant
damages issues facing the parties2, the current schedule is extremely
aggressive and presupposes that the parties will not require court
intervention. Unfortunately, Merial has engaged in multiple abuses of the
discovery process in this action, forcing Velcera to file a motion to compel
highly relevant documents from Merial (DE 121) and a motion for a
protective order because of Merial’s admitted violations of Local Rule 34
(DE 122). In addition, Merial has filed in another court a motion to quash a
third-party subpoena served by Velcera. Merial’s unwillingness to comply
with its discovery obligations, and its efforts to obstruct Velcera’s efforts to
obtain relevant discovery elsewhere, have placed the entire discovery

See Trell v. Marlee Elecs. Corp., 912 F.2d 1443, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
(“We recognize that an assessment of a royalty based on a fictional
negotiation is not a simple task. ‘Determining a fair and reasonable royalty is
often, . . . a difficult judicial chore, seeming often to involve more the talents
of a conjurer than those of a judge.’”) (citation omitted). As Judge Learned
Hand put it, “the whole notion of a reasonable royalty is a device in aid of
justice, by which that which is really incalculable shall be approximated.”
Cincinnati Car Co. v. N.Y. Rapid Transit Corp., 66 F.2d 592, 595 (2d Cir.
1933). See also Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Plywood Corp., 318 F. Supp.
1116, 1120 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) (setting forth fifteen non-exclusive factors to be
considered in reasonable royalty analysis). Therefore, conducting a
reasonable royalty analysis in this case will be challenging and complicated,
especially if the proceedings are conducted in a highly compressed time
period.
5

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 6 of 22

schedule in serious jeopardy. Simply put, Velcera cannot defend against
Merial’s claims without the discovery being withheld by Merial.
Another important factor impacting the current schedule is Merial’s
recent Complaint against Velcera alleging, among other things, trade dress
infringement based on the packaging of Velcera’s PetArmor® (fipronilonly) product. See Merial Limited v. Velcera, Inc. et al., 3:11-cv-00157CDL. On November 18, 2011, before Velcera had any opportunity to
respond to the Complaint, Merial filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.
The Court recently set a hearing date on Merial’s request for preliminary
injunction for December 5, 2011, which falls squarely in the middle of
discovery in the damages and sanctions phase of this case.
Merial never disclosed its plans to bring the trade dress action during
the negotiations between the parties regarding an appropriate discovery
schedule for the damages phase of this litigation. Considering that Velcera’s
PetArmor® product has been on the market for over seven months, it is
apparent that the timing of Merial’s Complaint and request for preliminary
injunctive relief was deliberately calculated to prejudice Velcera by
diverting its attention and resources during the expedited damages and
sanctions phase of this litigation. By effectively setting up two complex and
potentially “life threatening” litigation matters on one “fast track,” Merial
6

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 7 of 22

seeks to deprive Velcera of a full and fair opportunity to defend itself in
either case.
III.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY

A. Federal Courts and Congress Have Expressed a Strong Policy
Favoring the Resolution of Liability Appeals in Patent Cases
Before Damages Are Assessed
It is axiomatic that a federal court has broad discretion to stay
proceedings in the interests of “economy of time and effort for itself, for
counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248,
254 (1936); accord Coast Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 11,
15 (2001). The common sense principle underlying the exercise of this
authority is that, in some circumstances, it simply does not make sense to
undertake costly proceedings on matters that could be mooted by resolution
of an issue on appeal. See id. This principle is reflected in the general
equitable standard for staying damages proceedings pending appeal— a
standard that is different, and easier to meet, than the standard for staying
execution of a judgment pending appeal. Compare Coast Fed. Bank, 49
Fed. Cl. at 15 (holding that precedents concerning “stay[s] of the court’s
judgment pending appeal” were “inapposite” regarding motion for stay of
damages proceedings) with Order of June 30, 2011 (DE 89) (addressing
factors for staying execution of judgment pending appeal); Isaly Co. v.
7

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 8 of 22

Kraft, Inc., 622 F. Supp. 62, 62 (M.D. Fla. 1985) (staying damages
proceedings pending appeal notwithstanding trial judge’s statement that,
“[h]aving decided for Plaintiff on the facts and the law, I am obviously not
disposed to find that the Defendant now enjoys a likelihood of success on
the appeal”).
In the context of patent related litigation, settled precedents reflect a
strong policy favoring the resolution of liability appeals before damages are
assessed. See, e.g., Mendenhall v. Barber-Greene Co., 26 F.3d 1573, 1580
(Fed. Cir. 1994) (emphasizing that appellate resolution of liability question
would “avoid a burdensome determination of damages”).3 Indeed, as the
Federal Circuit has observed, Congress enacted some subsections of 28
U.S.C. § 1292, which would have allowed interlocutory appeal of the
Court’s contempt judgment and injunction absent the Court’s Rule 54(b)
certification, specifically to “permit a stay of a damages trial” pending

appeal of liability issues and other issues in infringement actions. In re
Calmar, Inc., 854 F.2d 461, 464 (Fed. Cir. 1988); accord SRI Int’l, Inc. v.
Adv. Tech. Labs., Inc., 45 F.3d 443, No. 93-1074, 1994 WL 712487, at *1
(Fed. Cir. Dec. 21, 1994) (“The purpose and rationale of § 1292(c)(2)—to
permit a district court to stay a damages trial pending the outcome of an
appeal on the merits—has been clearly stated by both Congress and the
Supreme Court. This court has heard those clear statements.”). All of these
cases, no matter which subsection of Section 1292 they address, stand for
the general proposition that expensive and time-consuming damages
determinations in patent cases should be deferred where a pending appeal
could “vitiate the [] proceedings below.” E.g., Coast Fed. Bank, 49 Fed. Cl.
at 15 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
In the current case, there is no question that Velcera’s appeal of the
Contempt Order and Judgment could moot the need for any damages
proceeding. As history has already shown, an analysis of the damages issues
in this case will be time consuming, complex and expensive. Moreover,
Merial’s initiation of yet another litigation matter against Velcera in which it
similarly seeks “expedited” relief further compounds the difficulties
currently faced in administering these cases. Therefore, it makes sense to
stay the damages proceedings in this case pending the Federal Circuit’s
9

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 10 of 22

imminent review of the Contempt Order and Judgment entered by this
Court.
B. The Damages Proceedings Will Involve Significant Discovery and
Expert Analysis Regarding Complex Market, Product and
Financial Issues
Merial and intends to seek a reasonable royalty and disgorgement of
any profits Velcera earned on the sale of its PetArmor® Plus product. (See
Scheduling Order (DE 111).) Merial’s approach to the damages phase of
this proceeding presents numerous legal and factual issues whose resolution
will burden not just the litigants, but also the Court and third parties.
Establishing a reasonable royalty requires the parties to take discovery
regarding a variety of issues, including, but not limited to, the structure of
the relevant market, the effect of distinct market channels on calculating any
reasonable royalty, the identity and acceptability of a variety of noninfringing substitutes to Merial’s Frontline® Plus product, and financial
information regarding the parties’ respective sales, costs and profit margins.
1. Determination of a Reasonable Royalty Involves Contested
Legal Issues and Complex Discovery
The prevalent method of determining an appropriate reasonable
royalty involves the determination of “a hypothetical royalty resulting from
arm’s length negotiation between a willing licensor and a willing licensee.”
Hanson v. Alpine Valley Ski Area, Inc., 718 F.2d 1075, 1078 (Fed. Cir.
10

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 11 of 22

1983). This hypothetical negotiation takes place at the time the infringement
began. Id. The analysis “necessarily involves some approximation of the
market as it would have hypothetically developed absent infringement,” but
also “requires sound economic and factual predicates.” Riles v. Shell
Exploration & Prod. Co., 298 F.3d 1302, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
A reasonable royalty rate can take many forms, including a lump sum,
a per unit amount, a percentage of sales, or a combination of such methods.
See Interactive Pictures Corp. v. Infinite Pictures, Inc., 274 F.3d 1371, 1384
(Fed. Cir. 2001) (recognizing lump sum payments); Wright v. United States,
53 Fed. Cl. 466, 478 (2002) (combined lump sum and running royalty).
Although the patent laws do not mandate any particular method to
determine a reasonable royalty, courts generally consider the following
fifteen, non-exclusive factors set forth in Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S.
Plywood Corp., 318 F. Supp. 1116, 1120 (S.D.N.Y. 1970):
1.
The royalties received by the patentee for the licensing of the
patent in suit, proving or tending to prove an established royalty.
2.
The rates paid by the licensee for the use of other patents
comparable to the patent in suit.
3.
The nature and scope of the license, as exclusive or nonexclusive; or as restricted or non-restricted in terms of territory or
with respect to whom the manufactured product may be sold.
4.
The licensor's established policy and marketing program to
maintain his patent monopoly by not licensing others to use the
11

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 12 of 22

invention or by granting licenses under special conditions designed to
preserve that monopoly.
5.
The commercial relationship between the licensor and
licensee, such as, whether they are competitors in the same territory in
the same line of business; or whether they are inventor and promoter.
6.
The effect of selling the patented specialty in promoting sales
of other products of the licensee; that existing value of the invention
to the licensor as a generator of sales of his non-patented items; and
the extent of such derivative or convoyed sales.
7.

The duration of the patent and the term of the license.

8.
The established profitability of the product made under the
patent; its commercial success; and its current popularity.
9.
The utility and advantages of the patent property over the old
modes or devices, if any, that had been used for working out similar
results.
10.
The nature of the patented invention; the character of the
commercial embodiment of it as owned and produced by the licensor;
and the benefits to those who have used the invention.
11.
The extent to which the infringer has made use of the
invention; and any evidence probative of the value of that use.
12.
The portion of the profit or of the selling price that may be
customary in the particular business or in comparable businesses to
allow for the use of the invention or analogous inventions.
13.
The portion of the realizable profit that should be credited to
the invention as distinguished from non-patented elements, the
manufacturing process, business risks, or significant features or
improvements added by the infringer.
14.

The opinion testimony of qualified experts.

12

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 13 of 22

15.
The amount that a licensor (such as the patentee) and a
licensee (such as the infringer) would have agreed upon (at the time
the infringement began) if both had been reasonably and voluntarily
trying to reach an agreement; that is, the amount which a prudent
licensee- who desired, as a business proposition, to obtain a license to
manufacture and sell a particular article embodying the patented
invention- would have been willing to pay as a royalty and yet be able
to make a reasonable profit and which amount would have been
acceptable by a prudent patentee who was willing to grant a license.
318 F. Supp. at 1120. Analysis of each of these factors in this case requires
significant document and deposition discovery from all parties and third
parties, as well as extensive expert reports and depositions.
2. Examples of Discovery and Information Needed
Merial’s decision to abandon any claim for lost profits has not
eliminated the need for discovery into its products’ profitability for purposes
of determining a reasonable royalty. Indeed, Georgia-Pacific Factor 8
specifically calls for consideration of the “established profitability” of
Merial’s product. See also See Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co., Inc., 56 F.3d
1538, 1554-55 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (acknowledging propriety of considering
patentee’s profit margin in determining “reasonable royalty”). In addition,
Velcera’s profit margin may also be factored into the reasonable royalty
analysis. See Hughes Tool Co. v. Dresser Indus. Inc., 816 F.2d 1549, 155658 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (considering propriety of reasonable royalty award in
light of infringer’s profit margin).
13

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 14 of 22

While each side may ultimately argue for different weights to be
attributed to each other’s profits, discovery of the profit information remains
necessary. Such information includes documentation of revenues and cost
structures (e.g., overhead, marketing expenses and manufacturing
investments). See Caterpillar, Inc. v. Detroit Diesel Corp., Civil Action No.
3:95CV489RM, 1997 WL 33165848, *4-5 (N.D. Ind. Jan. 24, 1997)
(holding that “sales, marketing, cost, and profit information” was
discoverable because “the profitability, cost, and sales of a product are
factors which are considered in determining a reasonable royalty . . . .”)
(citations omitted). Further, because the cost structures of companies are
unique, understanding the profit analysis requires consultation with damages
experts following receipt of company information available only through
written discovery and deposition testimony.
The same is true with respect to Georgia Pacific Factor 5, which
relates to the competitive positioning of the parties. This case does not
present the classic damages scenario where the parties agree that their
products compete for the same customers in the same sales channels.
Instead, the opposite is true – Merial purports to eschew the only channel
where PetArmor™ Plus is sold (at retail) in favor of a veterinary channel of
distribution. Specifically, according to Merial’s various public statements
14

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 15 of 22

on the subject, Merial only sells its Frontline® Plus product through
exclusive relationships with veterinarians. In contrast, Velcera sold its
PetArmor® Plus product only through retail channels (Wal-Mart and Sam’s
Club, specifically). Due to this market segmentation, it is necessary for the
parties to take discovery regarding these distinct channels of distribution in
the course of attempting to “approximat[e] the market as it have
hypothetically developed absent the [alleged] infringement.” Georgia
Pacific, 298 F.3d at 1311. Information needed on this issue includes
analysis and forecasts of each of these distinct markets; Merial’s policies and
enforcement of its veterinarian-only distribution; Merial’s own basis for
establishing and maintaining this restriction; and collection of evidence of
the actual effect of the entry into the over-the-counter market of Velcera.
This information is likely to show that the existence of market segmentation
resulted in little or no impact of the alleged infringement on Merial’s
ongoing sales, and thus may be a significant factor in determining the
hypothetical royalty to which Velcera and Merial would have agreed.
Related to the question of market segmentation is also price
segmentation. The price of Velcera’s product is significantly lower than
Merial’s product. Accordingly, investigation into the effect of price on a
consumer’s decision to purchase, in combination with the availability of the
15

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 16 of 22

product over-the-counter versus only through a veterinarian, is highly
relevant to the reasonable royalty analysis. This requires discovery into each
party’s pricing models, and Merial’s historical information relating to price.
Another significant area of discovery and analysis is Georgia-Pacific
Factor 9, which relates to the consideration on non-infringing substitutes to
the patented invention. Here, there were a number of non-infringing
alternatives available for Velcera to sell during the period of Velcera’s
alleged infringement, including Velcera’s own fipronil-only product. The
fact that Velcera could have marketed one of these alternative products or
formulations during the alleged period of infringement instead of taking a
hypothetical license from Merial is highly relevant to the determination of a
reasonable royalty, since it provides an option to enter the market without
any need to pay royalties. See Zygo Corp. v. Wyko Corp., 79 F.3d 1563,
1571-72 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (approving consideration of availability of
noninfringing device in determining reasonable royalty). To properly assess
this factor, it is necessary to take discovery from Merial and third parties
regarding the availability of non-infringing formulations and products that
are acceptable substitutes for Merial’s Frontline® Plus product. See id.
In addition to these particular issues that make the damages questions
in this case more complex than in the typical reasonably royalty scenario,
16

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 17 of 22

discovery regarding the following categories of information will also be
required:
 specific licensing or licensing negotiations relating to the ‘329 patent,
or other patents and products in the same field;
 settlement of any infringement claims under the ‘329 patent;
 Market strategies and analyses of market share;
 Advertising strategies and materials;
 Periodic sales data categorized by geographic area; and
 Forecasts and planning documents relating to anticipated sales; and
 license rates and terms in the industry.
See Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 632 F.3d 1292, 1314-15 (Fed. Cir.
2011) (rejecting “rule of thumb” for establishing reasonable royalty and
requiring that reasonable royalty be tied to the facts of the case);
ResQNet.com, Inc. v. Lansa, Inc., 594 F.3d 860, 872-873 (Fed. Cir. 2010)
(explaining relevance of licenses and settlements to reasonable royalty
calculation). The collection and processing of this information requires
substantial effort, as will the continued review of documents and information
that are produced by the parties and third parties.
C. Merial’s Refusal to Provide Any Meaningful Discovery in this
Action Renders Velcera’s Ability to Complete Discovery Within
the Current Schedule a Practical Impossibility

17

Case 3:07-cv-00125-CDL Document 123

Filed 11/23/11 Page 18 of 22

As reflected in Velcera’s Motion to Compel (DE 121), Merial has
obstructed Velcera’s efforts to take discovery regarding the various issues
discussed above at virtually every turn. By engaging in such a “scorched
earth” approach to discovery, Merial has effectively prevented Velcera from
completing the discovery it needs to defend against Merial’s claims within
the schedule set by the Court. Therefore, in the alternative to Velcera’s
request for a stay of these proceedings, Velcera respectfully requests that the
Court extend the current fact discovery period until sixty (60) days following
a ruling on Velcera’s Motion to Compel and stay any further deadlines set in
the Scheduling Order until further notice.
IV. CONCLUSION
Under the circumstances of this case, established Supreme Court and
Federal Circuit precedent counsel in favor of a stay of any damages
proceedings for the limited amount of additional time that it will take for the
Federal Circuit to complete its review of Velcera’s appeal. The Federal
Circuit’s decision could very well vitiate the damages proceedings in this
case. Therefore, Velcera respectfully requests that the Court grant its
request for a stay of the damages proceedings in this matter pending the
resolution of Velcera’s appeal.
Respectfully submitted this 23rd day of November, 2011.
