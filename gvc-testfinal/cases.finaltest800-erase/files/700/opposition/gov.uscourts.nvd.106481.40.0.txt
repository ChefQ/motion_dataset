MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I.

FACTS

18 A.

FACTS GIVING RISE TO THIS LITIGATION

19

On or about March 08, 2013, Mr. Harris (“Plaintiff”) was working as a cab driver for a duly

20 licensed taxicab company and was driving his marked cab unit and was responding to a call at the
21 time he was stopped by an unmarked SUV with LVMPD Officer Nielson and Henderson Detective
22 Perdue. (Doc. 28 ¶ 20). The Plaintiff stopped his vehicle and encountered two hostile individuals,
23 Defendant Nielson and Defendant Perdue, who identified themselves by badge as police officers.
24 (Doc. 28 ¶ 21).
25

At that time, the Plaintiff was not previously injured and advised the first officer that he

26 was being recorded and asked him why he had to be so rude and angry. Mr. Harris was initially
27 asked by Defendant Nielson “You in a hurry?” Mr. Harris responded that he was responding to a
28 radio call. Mr. Harris also advised Defendant Nielson and Defendant Perdue that they were on
2

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 3 of 25

1 camera. Defendant Nielson then threatened Mr. Harris with calling the Taxicab Authority if he
2 did not watch his mouth. (Doc. 28 ¶ 22).
3

Despite the Plaintiff not having committed any crime, Defendant Perdue then slammed his

4 badge shield against the passenger window identifying himself as a police officer. Both Defendant
5 Nielson and Defendant Perdue were in plain clothes and not acting as traffic officers. Defendant
6 Perdue then yelled profanity words to the effect that “we’re not fucking playing games.” Defendant
7 Perdue then continued his profanity by telling Mr. Harris that he was going to fucking jail. Mr.
8 Harris advised both officers the he was not resisting and attempted to state that he did not know
9 they were police officers when they got out of their car. Defendant Nielson then grabbed Mr.
10 Harris’ hands and maliciously pulled his finger to inflict pain. (Doc. 28 ¶ 23).
11

Defendant Perdue failed to prevent Defendant Nielson’s use of force which was committed

12 in his presence. On the contrary, Defendant Perdue chose not to de-escalate the situation. (Doc.
13 28 ¶ 24). As a result of Defendants’ use of force, and choice not to prevent the use of excessive
14 force, Plaintiff has suffered permanent injuries to his right middle finger. (Doc. 28 ¶ 25).
15 Moreover, Defendant Nielson and Defendant Perdue unreasonably seized Plaintiff. (Doc. 28 ¶ 26).
16 B.

SPECIFIC FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING CHIEF MOERS

17

Defendant Chief Patrick Moers (hereinafter “Chief Moers”) at all material times was Chief

18 of Police for the Henderson Police Department and was acting within the course and scope of his
19 employment. As Chief, Defendant Moers is a policy-making official for Henderson Police
20 Department with the power to make official and final policy for Henderson. Additionally,
21 Defendant Moers personally ratified, condoned and approved the acts of Defendant Perdue
22 Defendant Moers is sued in his individual capacity. (Doc. 28 ¶ 10). Chief Moers was the final
23 policy maker, and a supervisor of Defendant Perdue, who chose not to prohibit officers from
24 violating citizen’s Fourth Amendment rights. Defendant Moers is the policy maker for Henderson
25 and has failed to discipline and terminate Officers for physical violence against citizens. (Doc. 1
26 ¶ 42) (Due to a typographical error, Plaintiff inadvertently stated that Chief Moers is the policy
27 maker for “LVMPD” in this paragraph. In actuality Moers is the policy maker for Henderson
28 Police Department). The acts and omissions of all Defendants as set forth herein were at all
3

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 4 of 25

1 material times pursuant to the actual customs, policies, practices and procedures of Henderson,
2 which were personally created by Defendant Moers. (Doc. 28 ¶ 16). Henderson maintain de facto
3 policies to detain and handcuff citizens as a form of intimidation and in violation of well-settled
4 law by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. (Doc. 28 ¶ 30).
5

Defendant Moers chose to implement and enforce the guidelines, procedures, and

6 regulations of Henderson and supervised the conduct of the employees of Henderson to ensure they
7 act in conformance with well-settled constitutional law concerning seizures, arrests and legal basis
8 for the detention of individuals as well as the use of force in handcuffing and torturing a citizen
9 with unreasonable pain compliance techniques. (Doc. 28 ¶ 43). Defendant Moers’ choice not to
10 enforce the laws of the State of Nevada and the regulations of Henderson encouraged and caused
11 constitutional violations by the Defendant officer. (Doc. 28 ¶ 44).
12 C.

PLAINTIFF’S MONELL CLAIM AGAINST HENDERSON

13

The unconstitutional actions and/or omissions of Defendant Perdue, as well as other

14 officers employed by or acting on behalf of Defendant Henderson, on information and belief, were
15 pursuant to the following customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures of Henderson, stated in
16 the alternative, which were directed, encouraged, allowed, and/or ratified by policy making officers
17 for Henderson:
18

A.

19
20

citizens and the use of pain compliance techniques on traffic stops.
B.

21
22

To arrest and or detain individuals for traffic violations by handcuffing

To fail to use appropriate and generally accepted law enforcement
procedures by undercover officers.

C.

To fail to use appropriate and generally accepted law enforcement

23

procedures in requiring use of force reports to be used where an injury

24

occurs.

25
26

D.

To cover-up violations of constitutional rights by any or all of the
following:

28 . . .
4

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 5 of 25

1

i.

by failing to properly investigate and/or evaluate complaints or

2

incidents of excessive and unreasonable force, and unlawful

3

seizures and arrests, and/or handling of injured citizens;

4

ii

by ignoring and/or failing to properly and adequately investigate

5

and discipline unconstitutional or unlawful police activity by

6

refusing to conduct a full internal affairs complaint against the

7

Defendant officer; and by failing to advise citizens of the violation

8

and findings and disciplines.

9

iii

by allowing, tolerating, and/or encouraging police officers to: fail

10

to file complete and accurate police reports; file false police reports;

11

make false statements and/or to attempt to bolster officers’ stories;

12

and/or obstruct or interfere with investigations of unconstitutional

13

or unlawful police conduct, by withholding and/or concealing

14

material information.

15

E.

To allow, tolerate, and/or encourage a “code of silence” among law

16

enforcement officers and police department personnel, whereby an officer

17

or member of the department does not provide adverse information against

18

a fellow officer or member of the department; and

19
20
21

F.

To tolerate poorly performing officers and failing to adequately discipline
those officers for misconduct. (Doc. 28 ¶ 49).

The aforementioned customs, policies, practices, and procedures, were the moving force

22 and/or a proximate cause of the deprivations of Plaintiff’s clearly-established and well-settled
23 constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.(Doc. 1 ¶ 54).
24

Henderson participated in the coverup of the false arrest and false imprisonment of, and

25 use of excessive force upon, Plaintiff. Moreover, Henderson maintained de facto policies, and
26 organizational customs and cultures to handcuff and use painful holds on citizens in traffic stops
27 and to give “street justice” to individuals whom Henderson officers believed had disrespected their
28 authority. Henderson also refused to identify Doe Officers and to further conduct its investigation
5

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 6 of 25

1 in a transparent matter. Defendant Henderson’s de facto policies, and organizational customs and
2 cultures were the proximate cause behind the conduct causing Plaintiff to suffer the constitutional
3 violations. (Doc. 28 ¶ 50).
4

Moreover, upon information and belief, the unconstitutional actions and/or omissions of

5 Defendant Perdue, as described above, were approved, tolerated and/or ratified by policy-making
6 officer Defendant Moers for Henderson. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges,
7 the details of this incident has been revealed to Defendant Moers, and that such policy maker has
8 direct knowledge of the fact that the injury and false imprisonment of Plaintiff was not justified,
9 but rather represented an unconstitutional display of unreasonable and excessive force.
10 Notwithstanding this knowledge, Defendant Moers has approved Defendant Perdue’s actions, and
11 has made a deliberate choice to endorse Defendant Perdue’s excessive force.

By so doing,

12 Defendant Moers has shown affirmative agreement with the individual defendant officers’ actions,
13 and has ratified the unconstitutional acts of the individual Defendant officer. (Doc. 28 ¶ 53).

ARGUMENT

16 A.

STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR MOTIONS TO DISMISS

17

A court is required to construe complaints under the Civil Rights Act liberally. See,

18 Morrison v. Jones, 607 F.2d 1269 (1979). The Court's review of a 12(b) motion is based strictly
19 on the contents of the Complaint. Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir.
20 2001). The Court must accept the allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable
21 to the Plaintiff. Abramson v. Brounstein, 897 F.2d 389, 391 (9th Cir. 1990).
22

A complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt the Plaintiffs can

23 prove no set of facts in support of their claim that would entitle them to relief. Love v. United
24 States, 915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir. 1989). The only elements which need to be present in order
25 to establish a claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act are that the conduct complained of was
26 engaged in under color of state law and that such conduct subjected the Plaintiff to the deprivation
27 of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States. Morrison v.
28 Jones, 607 F.2d 1269 (1979) citing Marshall v. Sawyer, 301 F.2d 639 (9th Cir. 1962).
6

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 7 of 25

1

In Morrison, supra, the court stated, “at this preliminary stage of the proceedings, we

2 cannot say that [the Plaintiff] has failed to state a claim for relief based upon her constitutionally
3 secured rights to procedural due process of law and her substantive familial rights that have long
4 been considered the “basic civil rights of man.” Id. Though Morrison’s amended complaint was
5 inartfully drafted, the court stated, “[it] is required to construe complaints under the Civil Rights
6 Act liberally.” Id.
7

For a dismissal under 12(b)(6) to stand on appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals, it

8 must appear to a certainty that plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts that
9 could be proved. See King v. Atiyeh, 814 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir. 1987). A dismissal for failure
10 to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is reviewed de novo. Clegg v. Cult Awareness
11 Network, 18 F.3d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1994).
12 B.

PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT IS SUFFICIENTLY PLEAD PURSUANT TO FED R. CIV . PRO 8(A )

13

WITH FACTUAL BASIS TO WITHSTAND

14

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP) Rule 8(a) , General Rules of Pleading, provides

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS.

15 in relevant part:
16
17
18

(a) Claims for Relief. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief,
whether an original claim, counter-claim, cross-claim, or third-party
claim, shall contain (2) a short and plain statement of the claim
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for
judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or
of several different types may be demanded. (Emphasis Added)

19
20

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only notice pleading containing “a short

21 and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Allied Signal v. City
22 of Phoenix, 182 F.3d 692 (9th Cir. 1999). This liberal pleading standard only requires that “the
23 averments of the complaint sufficiently establish a basis for judgment against the defendant.” Id.,
24 citing, Yamaguchi v. United States Dep't of the Air Force, 109 F.3d 1475, 1481 (9th Cir.1997).
25 C.

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED A “PLAUSIBLE” CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT PERDUE

26

State officials, sued in their individual capacities, are "persons" within the meaning of

27 section 1983 and may be held personally liable for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on
28 actions taken in their official capacities. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 112 S. Ct. 358, 116 L. Ed.
7

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 8 of 25

1 2d 301 (1991). "To sustain an action under section 1983, a plaintiff must show (1) that the conduct
2 complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) that the conduct
3 deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right." Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d
4 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1989).
5

A person deprives another "of a constitutional right, within the meaning of § 1983 if he

6 does an affirmative act, participates in another's affirmative acts, or omits to perform an act which
7 he is legally required to do that causes the deprivation of which the plaintiff complains (emphasis
8 added). Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628,633 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting Johnson v. Duffy, 588 F.2d
9 740, 743 (9th Cir. 1978).
10

Officers who idly standby and fail to prevent fellow officers from using excessive force

11 are also liable to the plaintiff. U.S. v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1447 n. 25 (9th Cir. 1994)(judgment
12 aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 518 U.S 81, 116 S.Ct. 2038 (1996).
13

In this case, Plaintiff has specifically alleged that Detective Perdue failed to prevent Officer

14 Nielson use of force which was committed in his presence. On the contrary, Detective Perdue
15 chose not to de-escalate the situation. (Doc. 28, ¶ 24). As a result of Defendants’ use of force, and
16 choice not to prevent the use of excessive force, Plaintiff has suffered permanent injuries to his
17 right middle finger. (Doc. 28, ¶ 25). Moreover, Officer Nielson and Detective Perdue unreasonably
18 seized Plaintiff. (Doc. 28, ¶ 26).
19

The action of Officer Nielson and Detective Perdue constitutes unreasonable and excessive

20 use of force and deprivation of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourth and
21 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Detective Perdue failed to intervene
22 in the handcuffing and excessive force used by Officer Nielson. (Doc. 28, ¶ 29). Defendant was
23 complicit in the constitutional violations of Plaintiff by violating the constitutional rights of
24 Plaintiff through the use of handcuffing and unlawful detention even though Plaintiff had not
25 committed a crime or was in any way resistant to his authority because the Defendants LVMPD
26 and Henderson maintain de facto policies to detain and handcuff citizens as a form of intimidation
27 and in violation of well-settled law by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. (Doc. 28, ¶ 30).
28 Plaintiff was willfully, maliciously, and intentionally seized without justification, reasonable
8

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 9 of 25

1 suspicion, or probable cause. Plaintiff told both Defendant Officers he did not know they were
2 police officers initially because they were in a police car; did not have on uniforms; did not use a
3 police siren bubble to stop him; and did not initially show badges and acted rude and belligerent.
4 (Doc. 28, ¶ 31). Officer Nielson and Detective Perdue were acting in a manner that is well known
5 in the law enforcement community as a “Contempt of Cop”. (Doc. 28, ¶ 32). That intentional use
6 of an unlawful detention is often referred to as “street justice” where physical violence is used an
7 punishment; such as the twisting and injuring of Mr. Harris’ finger. (Doc. 28, ¶ 33). As a direct
8 result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff suffered violations of his constitutional rights
9 including the guarantee to be free from the deprivation of life or liberty without due process of law
10 and from unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (Doc. 28, ¶ 34). As a direct
11 and proximate result of the acts and omissions of Officer Nielson and Detective Perdue, Plaintiff
12 endured pain and further mental suffering, and he was deprived of his physical liberty. (Doc. 28,
13 ¶ 35). The handcuffing and denial of medical treatment against Plaintiff coupled with the unlawful
14 detention of Plaintiff by Officer Nielson and Detective Perdue when Defendant police officers
15 knew Mr. Harris had committed no crime nor was he a threat to the officers was done with actual
16 malice toward Plaintiff and with willful and wanton indifference to and deliberate disregard for
17 the constitutional rights of Plaintiff. (Doc. 28, ¶ 36). Lastly, at all times Defendant Perdue acted
18 in his official capacity as a law enforcement officer. (Doc. 28, ¶ 12).
19

Accepting these specific factual allegations as true, as required at the pleading stage, it is

20 apparent that Plaintiff has alleged specific facts which demonstrate that Defendant Perdue’s
21 conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional right when Defendant Perdue seized the
22 Plaintiff and failed to prevent Defendant Nielson’s excessive use of force which was committed
23 in Perdue’s presence; and that Defendant Perdue was acting under color of state law.
24 Consequently, Henderson’s Motion should be denied.

1 D.

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED A “PLAUSIBLE” THEORY OF SUPERVISORY LIABILITY AGAINST

2

CHIEF MOERS

3

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has never required a plaintiff to

4 allege that a supervisor was physically present when the injury occurred. Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d
5 1202, 1205-1206 (9th Cir. 2011). Rather, to be held liable the supervisor need not be directly and
6 personally involved in the same way as are the individual officers who are on the scene inflicting
7 constitutional injury. Id.
8

Supervisory liability is imposed against a supervisory official in his individual capacity for

9 his own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates, for
10 his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivations of which the complaint is made, or for conduct
11 that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others. Larez v. Los Angeles, 946
12 F.2d 630, 646 (9th Cir. 1991).
13

The Ninth Circuit has addressed the Iqbal decision as it relates to the Supreme Court

14 scaling back supervisory liability under §1983 and Bivens claims. See Castillo v. Skwarski, No.
15 C08-5683BHS, 2009 WL 4844801, at *7, *8 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 10, 2009); Al-Kidd v. Ashcroft,
16 580 F.3d 949, 965 (9th Cir.2009) (“Ninth Circuit identified four general situations in which
17 supervisory liability may be imposed: (1) for setting in motion a series of acts by others, or
18 knowingly refusing to terminate a series of acts by others, which they knew or reasonably should
19 have known would cause others to inflict constitutional injury; (2) for culpable action or inaction
20 in training, supervision, or control of subordinates; (3) for acquiescence in the constitutional
21 deprivation by subordinates; or (4) for conduct that shows a reckless or callous indifference to the
22 rights of others.”).
23

Chief Moers is a proper party this litigation, and Plaintiffs have asserted “plausible” claims

24 against Moers, because Defendant Moers is the policy making official of Henderson Police
25 Department at all times relevant to this litigation. In Larez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F. 2d 646
26 (9th Cir. 1991), The Ninth Circuit held that the police chief could be held individually liable
27 . . .
28 . . .
10

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 11 of 25

1 because he “condoned, ratified and encouraged the excessive use of force by failing to discipline
2 the individual officers responsible for constitutional violations and by failing to establish new
3 procedures to prevent future occurrences.”
4

Additionally, The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has long permitted

5 plaintiffs to hold supervisors individually liable in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suits when culpable action,
6 or inaction, is directly attributed to them. Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2011). The court
7 has never required a plaintiff to allege that a supervisor was physically present when the injury
8 occurred. Id. To be held liable, the supervisor need not be directly and personally involved in the
9 same way as are the individual officers who are on the scene inflicting constitutional injury.Id.
10 Rather, the supervisor's participation could include his own culpable action or inaction in the
11 training, supervision, or control of his subordinates, his acquiescence in the constitutional
12 deprivations of which the complaint is made, or conduct that showed a reckless or callous
13 indifference to the rights of others. Id.
14

In this case, Plaintiff has alleged that Chief Moers was the final policy maker, and a

15 supervisor of Defendant Perdue, who chose not to prohibit officers from violating citizen’s Fourth
16 Amendment rights. Defendant Moers is the policy maker for Henderson and has failed to discipline
17 and terminate Officers for physical violence against citizens. (Doc. 28 ¶ 42) (Due to a
18 typographical error, Plaintiff inadvertently stated that Chief Moers is the policy maker for
19 “LVMPD” in this paragraph. In actuality Moers is the policy maker for Henderson Police
20 Department). The acts and omissions of all Defendants as set forth herein were at all material times
21 pursuant to the actual customs, policies, practices and procedures of Henderson, which were
22 personally created by Defendant Moers. (Doc. 28 ¶ 16). Henderson maintain de facto policies to
23 detain and handcuff citizens as a form of intimidation and in violation of well-settled law by the
24 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. (Doc. 28 ¶ 30).
25

Defendant Moers chose to implement and enforce the guidelines, procedures, and

26 regulations of Henderson and supervised the conduct of the employees of Henderson to ensure they
27 act in conformance with well-settled constitutional law concerning seizures, arrests and legal basis
28 for the detention of individuals as well as the use of force in handcuffing and torturing a citizen
11

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 12 of 25

1 with unreasonable pain compliance techniques.(Doc. 28 ¶ 43). Defendant Moers’ choice not to
2 enforce the laws of the State of Nevada and the regulations of Henderson encouraged and caused
3 constitutional violations by the Defendant officer. (Doc. 28 ¶ 44). Lastly, Plaintiff alleged that
4 Chief Moers personally ratified, condoned and approved the acts of Defendant Perdue. (Doc. 28
5 ¶ 10).
6

Consequently, Plaintiff has alleged a viable theory of recovery against Chief Moers and

7 Defendant’s Motion should be denied because Defendant’s argument concerning Moers’ lack of
8 personal participation misapprehends the law of this jurisdiction.
9 E.
10

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED A “PLAUSIBLE” MONELL CLAIM AGAINST HENDERSON
A plaintiff can establish municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in one of three ways.

11 Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir. 1992). "First, the plaintiff may prove that a city
12 employee committed the alleged constitutional violation pursuant to a formal government policy
13 or a longstanding practice or custom which constitutes the standard operating procedure of the
14 local governmental entity." Id. "Second, the plaintiff may establish that the individual who

16 challenge action itself thus constituted an act of official governmental policy." Id. (citing Pembaur
17 v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480-81 (1986)). "Third, the plaintiff may prove that an official
18 with final policy-making authority ratified a subordinate's unconstitutional decision or action and
19 the basis for it. Id. at 1346-47 (citing City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 127 (1988)).

A local government entity may be held liable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 where the

Policy or Custom

22 alleged constitutional tort was inflicted in the execution of the entity's (1) policy or (2) custom.
23 Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91 (1978).
24

A policy or custom need not be a formally promulgated for purposes of § 1983, rather the

25 existence of a policy or custom may be inferred by the conduct. Henry v. County of Shasta, 132
26 F.3d 512, 519 (9th Cir. 1997). Additionally, existence of a policy or custom in a § 1983 municipal
27 liability claim may be proven by prior conduct or post-event evidence. Larez v. Los Angeles, 946

1

At paragraph 49 of his Complaint, Plaintiff specifically alleges that The unconstitutional

2 actions and/or omissions of Defendant Perdue, as well as other officers employed by or acting on
3 behalf of Defendant Henderson, on information and belief, were pursuant to the following
4 customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures of Henderson, stated in the alternative, which were
5 directed, encouraged, allowed, and/or ratified by policy making officers for Henderson: To arrest
6 and or detain individuals for traffic violations by handcuffing citizens and the use of pain
7 compliance techniques on traffic stops; To fail to use appropriate and generally accepted law
8 enforcement procedures by undercover officers; To fail to use appropriate and generally accepted
9 law enforcement procedures in requiring use of force reports to be used where an injury occurs;
10 To allow, tolerate, and/or encourage a “code of silence” among law enforcement officers and
11 police department personnel, whereby an officer or member of the department does not provide
12 adverse information against a fellow officer or member of the department; and, To tolerate poorly
13 performing officers and failing to adequately discipline those officers for misconduct; To cover-up
14 violations of constitutional rights by any or all of the following: (i) by failing to properly
15 investigate and/or evaluate complaints or incidents of excessive and unreasonable force, and
16 unlawful seizures and arrests, and/or handling of injured citizens; (ii) by ignoring and/or failing
17 to properly and adequately investigate and discipline unconstitutional or unlawful police activity
18 by refusing to conduct a full internal affairs complaint against the Defendant officer; and by failing
19 to advise citizens of the violation and findings and disciplines; (iii) by allowing, tolerating, and/or
20 encouraging police officers to: fail to file complete and accurate police reports; file false police
21 reports; make false statements and/or to attempt to bolster officers’ stories; and/or obstruct or
22 interfere with investigations of unconstitutional or unlawful police conduct, by withholding and/or
23 concealing material information. (Doc. 28 ¶ 49).
24

Plaintiff further alleged that Henderson participated in the coverup of the false arrest and

25 false imprisonment of, and use of excessive force upon, Plaintiff. Moreover, Henderson
26 maintained de facto policies, and organizational customs and cultures to handcuff and use painful
27 holds on citizens in traffic stops and to give “street justice” to individuals whom Henderson
28 officers believed had disrespected their authority. Henderson has also refused to identify Doe
13

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 14 of 25

1 Officers and to further conduct its investigation in a transparent matter. Defendant Henderson’s
2 de facto policies, and organizational customs and cultures were the proximate cause behind the
3 conduct causing Plaintiff to suffer the constitutional violations. (Doc. 28 ¶ 50).
4

Accepting all of the allegations concerning the foregoing policies, practices, and customs,

5 Plaintiff has stated a “plausible” Monell claim because the foregoing allegations demonstrate
6 Henderson’s de facto policies and an organizational custom and culture whereby the Henderson
7 Police Department was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional rights of citizens.
8 Consequently, Defendants Motion should be denied.

2.

Ratification

A single decision by a municipal official that ratifies unconstitutional conduct may be

11 sufficient to trigger section 1983 liability if that official has "final policymaking authority."
12 Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 481-83; Gillette, 979 F.2d at 1347.
13

The Ninth Circuit distinguishes between affirmative or deliberate conduct by a

14 policymaker, which constitutes ratification, and mere acquiescence, which is insufficient to
15 establish municipal liability by ratification. See Gillette supra. In Fuller v. City of Oakland, 47
16 F.3d 1522, 1534 (9th Cir. 1995), the court found section 1983 municipal liability where a police
17 chief ratified an unconstitutional investigation by expressly "approv[ing] both of the propriety of
18 the investigation and the reports conclusions." See, Christie, 176 F.3d at 1240 (finding municipal
19 liability via ratification where prosecutor "affirmatively approved" of alleged constitutional
20 violations).
21

In this case Plaintiff specifically alleged that the unconstitutional actions and/or omissions

22 of Defendant Perdue were approved, tolerated and/or ratified by policy-making officer Defendant
23 Moers for Henderson. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, the details of this
24 incident has been revealed to Defendant Moers, and that such policy maker has direct knowledge
25 of the fact that the injury and false imprisonment of Plaintiff was not justified, but rather
26 represented an unconstitutional display of unreasonable and excessive force. Notwithstanding this
27 knowledge, Defendant Moers has approved Defendant Perdue’s actions, and has made a deliberate
28 choice to endorse Defendant Perdue’s misconduct. By so doing, Defendant Moers has shown
14

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 15 of 25

1 affirmative agreement with the individual defendant officers’ actions, and has ratified the
2 unconstitutional acts of the individual Defendant officer. (Doc. 28 ¶ 53).
3

Moers’ ratification of Defendant Perdue’s unconstitutional actions demonstrates that

4 Defendant Perdue’s conduct was not inconsistent with the City's actual customs, even when that
5 conduct may have departed from published policies. Consequently, Defendant’s Motion should
6 be denied.
7 F.

DEFENDANTS MOERS AND PERDUE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

8

Qualified Immunity is an affirmative defense, therefore the Defendant's bear the burden of

9 proof. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001). In evaluating the issue of qualified immunity, the
10 court follows a two-part test: (1) whether the facts alleged "show [that] the officer[s'] conduct
11 violated a constitutional right"; and (2) whether the constitutional right in question was "clearly
12 established" such that "it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in
13 the situation he confronted." Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02 (2001); See also modifications
14 to Saucier following Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009).
15

The test for qualified immunity is objective. The defendant's actual purpose or state of mind

16 is not material. Whether rights were "clearly established" at the relevant time is determined in most
17 instances by looking at controlling published court decisions as of that time. United States v.
18 Lanier, 520 U.S.259, 269-71 (1997). It is not necessary, however, for the plaintiff to show a
19 published decision establishing the rights in question under precisely the same circumstances as
20 those presented in the case in question. See, Anderson v. Romero, 72 F.3d 518, 526-27 (7th
21 Cir.1995); Buonocore v. Harris, 65 F.3d 347, 356-57 (4th Cir.1995). To rule that until the
22 Supreme Court has spoken, no right of litigants in this circuit can be deemed established before
23 we have decided the issue would discourage anyone from being the first to bring a damages suit
24 in this court; he would be certain to be unable to obtain any damages. Burgess v. Lowery, 201 F.3d
25 942 (7th Cir. 2000).
26

Officers have no "discretion" to violate the Constitutional rights of citizens. Owen v. City

27 of Independence, Mo., 445 U.S. 622 (1980). A Defendant is only entitled to qualified immunity
28 if the Defendant did not violate "clearly established rights" at the time of the conduct in question.
15

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 16 of 25

1 Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817-818(1982). See, Mattos v. Agarano, 661 F.3d 433 (9th
2 Cir. 2011)(holding that the law must be well settled).
3

Additionally, the prohibition against acquiescence in the constitutional deprivations and

4 conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others was clearly
5 established at the time of the incident giving rise to this Complaint. Larez v. Los Angeles, 946 F.2d
6 630, 646 (9th Cir. 1991). Because there existed published opinions prohibiting acquiescence in the
7 constitutional deprivations and conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights
8 of others before the incident giving rise to this Complaint, any reasonable Chief would have been
9 aware that choosing not to prohibit officers from violating citizen’s Fourth Amendment rights,
10 failing to discipline and terminate Officers for physical violence against citizens. (Doc. 28 ¶ 42);
11 and maintaining de facto policies to detain and handcuff citizens as a form of intimidation and in
12 violation of well-settled law by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Doc. 28 ¶ 30) was unlawful.
13 Consequently, Defendant Moers is not entitled to qualified immunity because his decisions to not
14 to prohibit officers from violating citizen’s Fourth Amendment rights; failing to discipline and
15 terminate Officers for physical violence against citizens; and maintaining de facto policies to
16 detain and handcuff citizens as a form of intimidation demonstrates acquiescence in the
17 constitutional deprivations and conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights
18 of others. Consequently Moers in not entitled to qualified immunity.
19

Similarly, it was also well-settled at the time of this event that Officers who idly standby

20 and fail to prevent fellow officers from using excessive force are also liable to the plaintiff. U.S.
21 v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1447 n. 25 (9th Cir. 1994)(judgment aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other
22 grounds, 518 U.S 81, 116 S.Ct. 2038 (1996). Likewise, arrests without probable cause were
23 prohibited at the time of this incident. Morgan v. Woessner, 997 F.2d 1244 (9th Cir. 1993).
24 Consequently, Defendant Perdue is not entitled to qualified immunity because accepting Plaintiff’s
25 allegations as true, Perdue’s unconstitutional conduct violated clearly established law.
26 G.

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED A VIABLE CLAIM FOR FALSE IMPRISONMENT

27

Respondeat superior is a viable theory of liability against Henderson and Chief Moers for

28 state torts. See, Prell Hotel Corp. v. Antonacci, 86 Nev. 390 (1970) and N.R.S. 41.130. False
16

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 17 of 25

1 imprisonment is the confinement or detention of another person without sufficient legal authority.
2 NRS 200.460. An individual is liable for the tort of false imprisonment if: (1) he or she act
3 intending to confine the other or a third person within boundaries fixed by the actor; (2) his or her
4 acts directly or indirectly results in such a confinement of the other; and (3) the other is conscious
5 of the confinement or is harmed by it. Switzer v. Rivera, 174 F. Supp. 2d 1097, 1110 (D. Nev.
6 2001). In order to prove false arrest in a false imprisonment action, plaintiff must show that the
7 defendant instigated or effected an unlawful arrest. Nau v. Sellman, 104 Nev. 248, 757 P.2d 358
8 (1988).
9

In Nevada, the tort of false arrest is closely related of the common law tort of false

10 imprisonment. Nau v. Sellman, 104 Nev. 248 (1988); See also Nelson v. City of Las Vegas, 99
11 Nev. 548 (1983)(Analyzing false arrest and false imprisonment holding “ A police officer is not
12 liable for false arrest or imprisonment when he acts pursuant to a warrant that is valid on its face.
13 The facially valid warrant provides the legal cause or justification for the arrest, in the same way
14 that an arrest made with probable cause is privileged and not actionable.”). Moreover, Nevada’s
15 pattern jury instruction for false imprisonment, 6 IT 4, provides that “False imprisonment arising
16 from false arrest occurs when the claimant’s liberty is restrained under the probable imminence
17 of force without any legal cause or justification” Id. See also Jordan v. State ex. rel. Dept. of Motor
18 Vehicles, 121 Nev. 44 (2005)(holding a false-arrest claimant must show that the actor instigated
19 or effected an unlawful arrest. Similarly, false imprisonment arising from a false arrest occurs
20 when the claimant's liberty is restrained under the probable imminence of force without any legal
21 cause or justification.) overruled concerning standard of review for a Motion to Dismiss only.
22

Here, Plaintiff alleged that Despite the Plaintiff not having committed any crime, Defendant

23 Perdue then slapped his badge shield against the passenger window identifying himself as a police
24 officer. Both Defendant Nielson and Defendant Perdue were in plain clothes and not acting as
25 traffic officers. Defendant Perdue then yelled profanity words to the effect that “we’re not fucking
26 playing games.” Defendant Perdue continued his profanity by telling Mr. Harris that he was going
27 to fucking jail. Mr. Harris advised both officers the he was not resisting and attempted to state that
28 he did not know they were police officers when they got out of their car. (Doc. 28 ¶ 23).
17

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 18 of 25

1 Moreover, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant Perdue’s conduct of detaining and arresting Plaintiff
2 without legal probable cause constitutes false arrest and false imprisonment.(Doc. 28 ¶ 58). As a
3 direct and proximate result of Defendant Perdue’s conduct, Plaintiff has incurred special and
4 general damages. (Doc. 28 ¶ 59). Defendant Perdue’s conduct was committed intentionally,
5 maliciously, and with conscious disregard to the safety of Plaintiff warranting the imposition of
6 punitive damages.(Doc. 28 ¶ 60). Accepting Plaintiff’s allegations as true (1) Defendants intended
7 to confine Mr. Harris during the course of his detention and arrest when they physically stopped
8 Mr. Harris’ vehicle and prevented him from leaving; (2) Defendants’ actions directly caused the
9 confinement; and (3) Mr. Harris was aware that he was being confined and was not free to leave.
10 Consequently, Henderson’s Motion should be denied.
11 H.

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED A VIABLE CLAIM FOR IIED

12

Respondeat superior is a viable theory of liability against Henderson and Chief Moers for

13 state torts. See, Prell Hotel Corp. v. Antonacci, 86 Nev. 390 (1970) and N.R.S. 41.130. The
14 elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) claim are "(1) extreme and
15 outrageous conduct with either the intention of, or reckless disregard for, causing emotional
16 distress, (2) the plaintiff's having suffered severe or extreme emotional distress and (3) actual or
17 proximate causation." Star v. Rabello, 97 Nev. 124, 625 P.2d 90, 91-92 (Nev. 1981)
18

Here, Defendant Perdue’s use of force by handcuffing and false imprisonment of Plaintiff

19 was extreme and outrageous causing Plaintiff to suffer emotional distress and was done
20 intentionally and maliciously. (Doc. 28 ¶ 63). As a direct and proximate result of Defendant
21 Perdue’s intentional infliction of emotional distress upon Plaintiff, he has incurred special and
22 general damages, and is further entitled to punitive damages.(Doc. 28 ¶ 64). As a direct result of
23 the acts and omissions of the Defendants, and each of them, Plaintiff was caused to suffer physical
24 and mental injury, pain and suffering, and severe emotional distress and other related costs,
25 medical, and lost wages, including but not limited to attorney fees. (Doc. 28 ¶ 65).
26

Accepting Plaintiff’s allegations as true, it is apparent that Plaintiff has alleged specific

27 facts which demonstrate that the Defendants engaged in outrageous conduct which caused Plaintiff
28 to suffer severe emotional distress. Consequently, Henderson’s Motion should be denied.
18

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 19 of 25

1 I.

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED A VIABLE CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENCE

2

Plaintiff has alleged specific facts, in paragraphs 70 through 72, against Defendant

3 Moers. Moreover, respondeat superior is a viable theory of liability against Henderson and
4 Chief Moers for state torts. See, Prell Hotel Corp. v. Antonacci, 86 Nev. 390 (1970) and
5 N.R.S. 41.130. In order to prevail on a negligence theory a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1)
6 the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, (3) the
7 breach was the legal cause of the plaintiff’s injuries, and (4) the plaintiff suffered damages.
8 DeBoer v. Sr. Bridges of Sparks Fam. Hosp., 282p.3d727, 732 (2012).
9

Here Plaintiff has alleged that each Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to act with due

10 care in the execution and enforcement of any right, law, or legal obligation. (Doc. 28 ¶67). At
11 all times, each Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to act with reasonable care. (Doc. 28 ¶ 68).
12

The general duties of reasonable care and due care owed to Plaintiff by all Defendants

13 include but are not limited to the following specific obligations:
14

a.

15

to refrain from using excessive and/or unreasonable force against
Plaintiff;

16

b.

to refrain from unreasonably creating the situation where force is used;

17

c.

to refrain from abusing the authority granted to them by law;

18

d.

to refrain from violating Plaintiff’s rights guaranteed by the United

19

States and Nevada Constitutions, as set forth above, and as otherwise

20

protected by law. (Doc. 28 ¶ 69).

21

Additionally, these general duties of reasonable care and due care owed to Plaintiff by

22 Defendants Henderson, Chief Moers and Does III-X, include but are not limited to the
23 following specific obligations:
24

a.

to properly and adequately hire, investigate, train, supervise, monitor,

25

evaluate, and discipline, their employees, agents, and/or law enforcement

26

officers to ensure that those employees/agents/officers act at all times in

27

the public interest and in conformance with law;

28 . . .
19

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 20 of 25

b.

to make, enforce, and at all times act in conformance with policies and

2

customs that are lawful and protective of individual rights, including

3

Plaintiff’s;

4

c.

to refrain from making, enforcing, and/or tolerating the wrongful

5

policies and customs set forth above.(Doc. 28 ¶ 70).

6

Defendants, through their acts and omissions, breached each and every one of the

7 aforementioned duties owed to Plaintiff. (Doc. 28 ¶ 71). As a direct and proximate result of
8 Defendants’ negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages, and against each and every
9 Defendant. (Doc. 28 ¶ 72). Accepting Plaintiff’s allegations as true, it is apparent that Plaintiff
10 has alleged specific facts against Chief Moers which demonstrate that the Defendant Moers
11 breached duties of care which he owed Plaintiff, thereby causing Plaintiff damages.
12 Consequently, Defendant’s Motion should be denied.
13 J.

THIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF’S STATE TORT CLAIMS

14

It is within the discretion of the federal district court to hear pendant state tort claims

15 that arise out of a “common nucleus of operative fact”. United Mine Workers of America v.
16 Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966). To return the state tort claims to state court would be a waste
17 of judicial resources. Schneider v. TRW, Inc., 938 F.2d 986, 994 (9th Cir. 1991).
18

In this case, Plaintiff specifically invoked the supplemental jurisdiction of this Court

19 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (Doc. 1, ¶ 3). § 1367(c) generally provides the circumstances in
20 which a Court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Those instances include when
21 (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law, (2) the claim substantially
22 predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction, (3)
23 the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or (4) in
24 exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
25

In the case at hand, the central tenet of Plaintiff’s Complaint is excessive use of force

26 and unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Arising out of that same unlawful
27 arrest are state tort claims for and False Imprisonment, Intentional Infliction of Emotional
28 Distress and Negligence. Therefore the state tort claims arise of the same nucleus of operative
20

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 21 of 25

1 fact. Additionally, none of the circumstances in which a Court may, generally, decline to
2 exercise supplemental jurisdiction exist in this matter because claims for false arrest/false
3 imprisonment are well-settled in Nevada and do not involve novel or complex issue of State
4 law; Plaintiff’s state claims do not substantially predominate over his § 1983 claims; the
5 Plaintiff has viable claims under § 1983, and there do not exist, nor has Defendant alleged, that
6 there exist any exceptional circumstances or compelling reasons to decline jurisdiction.
7

On the contrary, the basis for Defendants argument concerning lack of supplemental

8 jurisdiction is premised upon the Court’s dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims under § 1983. As
9 analyzed above, Plaintiff submits that he has viable claims under § 1983. Therefore, Plaintiff
10 respectfully requests that this Court exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state
11 tort claims.
12 K.

PLAINTIFF ONLY SEEKS PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS

13

In the interest of clarity, Plaintiff does not seek punitive damages from the City of

14 Henderson but rather only seeks punitive damages against the individual Defendants as noted
15 in Plaintiff’s second prayer for relief. (“In excess of $75,000.00 in exemplary damages as to
16 individual Defendant’s”)(Doc. 1, p. 14).
17 L.

PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT IS APPROPRIATE

18

The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act provides: In a case of actual controversy within

19 its jurisdiction, except with respect to Federal taxes, any court of the United States, upon the
20 filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relation of any
21 interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
22 Any Such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be
23 reviewable as such. U.S.C.A. §§ 2201, 2202
24

A declaratory judgment rules upon the lawfulness of a particular statute, policy, or

25 government practice and, unlike an injunction, does not involve continuing oversight or
26 affirmative intervention by the court. See e. g. Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452 (1974).
27 Because of the lesser degree of intrusiveness into governmental affairs, the Supreme Court has
28 held that a grant of declaratory relief does not require a showing of irreparable injury Steffel, at
21

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 40 Filed 09/28/15 Page 22 of 25

1 466-67. Declaratory relief is appropriate where such relief may vindicate the plaintiff’s
2 position, clarify or settle legal issues, or forestall future litigation. Greater Los Angeles Council
3 on Deafness, Inc. v. Zolin, 812 F.2d 1103, 1111-13 (9th Cir. 1987).
4

Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint provides that: this is an action for declaratory judgment

5 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, for a finding that Defendant Henderson has chosen not to comply
6 with Plaintiff’s FOIA requests and providing injunctive relief requiring Defendant Henderson
7 to comply with Plaintiff’s FOIA requests because Plaintiff has an inadequate remedy at law in
8 that he is precluded from identifying the individuals whom violated his civil rights while acting
9 under the color of law as alleged herein. (Doc. 28 ¶ 19). Following this incident, Plaintiff made
10 FOIA requests upon Defendant Henderson, however each department chose not to comply with
11 the requests and affirmatively concealed their misconduct. (Doc. 28 ¶ 27).
12

In this case, Henderson is subject to Nevada’s State Freedom of Information Act which

13 is promulgated as Nevada’s Open Records law, NRS § 239. Consequently, Henderson is
14 subject to the state statute and this Court may properly require Henderson to comply with the
15 statute.
16 M.

IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO DISMISSAL, PLAINTIFFS OUGHT TO BE PERMITTED TO

17

AMEND THE COMPLAINT TO CLARIFY ANY DEFICIENCIES

22
23
24
25
26
27
28

(a)
Amendments. A party may amend his pleading once as a
matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is
served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading
is permitted and the action has not been placed upon trial
calendar, he may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is
served. Otherwise, a party may amend his pleading only by leave
of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave
shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead
in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining
for the response to the original pleading or within 10 days after
service of the amended pleading whichever period may be the
longer, unless the court otherwise orders.
(c) Relation back of Amendments. Whenever the claim or
defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the
conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be
set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to
the date of the original pleading.
22

FRCP 15(a) provides in part that a party may amend their pleadings by leave of court

2 and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. Although leave to amend a complaint
3 is not to be granted automatically, the policy permitting leave to amend is applied with
4 "extraordinary liberality." Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Rose, 893 F.2s 1074, 1079
5 (9th Cir. 1990). Therefore, to the extent that this Court determines any deficiencies exist in
6 Plaintiff’s Complaint, Plaintiff respectfully requests the opportunity to cure any deficiencies
7 through amendment.

CONCLUSION

3

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court deny Henderson’s Motion

4 because when the allegations contained in Plaintiff’s Complaint are accepted as true, as
5 required at the pleading stage, Plaintiff alleges plausible claims against Defendants Moers,
6 Perdue and Henderson. Moreover, Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity because
7 they committed constitutional violations contrary to clearly established law. Lastly, Plaintiff
8 has alleged viable state tort claims that arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact as his
9 federal claims.
10

To the extent that this Court determines that any deficiencies exist in Plaintiff’s

11 Complaint, Plaintiff respectfully requests the opportunity to cure any deficiencies through
12 amendment.
