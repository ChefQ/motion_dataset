FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Plaintiff alleges that he was pulled over while driving a taxicab on March 8, 2013, by
Defendants NIELSON, a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (“LVMPD”) Officer
and PERDUE, a “City of Henderson Police Officer assigned to a Regional Task Force.”
The conduct upon which Plaintiff bases his claims against PERDUE is limited to
allegations that he “slapped” his badge shield against the passenger window (of Plaintiff’s
2

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 3 of 21
stopped vehicle), to have identified himself as a police officer and “yelled profanity words”.
(Paragraphs 21 and 23). Plaintiff alleges that he was injured when Defendant NIELSON
of LVMPD “. . . . grabbed Mr. HARRIS’ hands and maliciously pulled his finger to inflict
pain.” Plaintiff alleges that PERDUE should have somehow prevented NIELSON’s
conduct. There is no allegation that PERDUE ever had any physical contact with Plaintiff.
No facts are alleged from which it could even be inferred that PERDUE knew in advance
that NIELSON planned to pull HARRIS’ finger, was aware that NIELSON was pulling
HARRIS’ finger or had any opportunity to intercede.
Defendant MOERS is alleged to have been the Chief of Police for the Henderson
Police Department. (Paragraph 10).
II.
DISMISSAL OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OF THE HENDERSON DEFENDANTS
IS APPROPRIATE BASED UPON PLAINTIFF’S FAILURE TO STATE ANY
CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED
A. Standard of Review for Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss
The standard of review on a motion made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure is that a plaintiff pleads sufficient facts “to state a claim for relief
that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955,
1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2) requires a pleading to contain a
“short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”
“A pleading that offers ‘labels and conclusions' or ‘a formulaic recitation’ of the
elements of a cause of action will not do.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173
L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d
929). “Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further
factual enhancement.’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167
3

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 4 of 21
L.Ed.2d 929). Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the
speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the First Amended
Complaint are true.

Twombly, supra at 555, 1959. The plausibility standard requires

“more than a sheer possibility that defendant has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at
1949.
In deciding a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must liberally construe the
claims, accept all factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint as true, and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Goldstein v. Pataki, 516 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir.
2008) (quoting Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002)).
However, this tenet “is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the
elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”
Iqbal, at 1949. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a First Amended
Complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. Id. At 1950, emphasis added.
“Rule 8 does not empower a party to plead the bare elements of his cause of action, affix
the label “general allegation” and expect his First Amended Complaint to survive a motion
to dismiss. Iqbal at 1953.
The

allegations

in

Plaintiff’s

First

Amended

Complaint

concerning

the

HENDERSON DEFENDANTS are almost entirely speculative, conjectural and conclusory
statements, rather than factual allegations. The Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is
predominated by non- factual allegations of the type exemplified in the quoted paragraphs:
32.

Officer Nielson and Detective Purdue were acting in a manner that
is well known in the law enforcement community as a “Contempt of
Cop”.

33.

That intentional use of an unlawful detention is often referred to as
“street justice” where physical violence is used as punishment;
such as the twisting and injuring of Mr. Harris’ finger.
4

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 5 of 21
44.

Defendants Gillespie, Moers, and Doe Officers III-X choice not to
enforce the laws of the State of Nevada and the regulations of
LVMPD and Henderson encouraged and caused constitutional
violations by the aforementioned officer.

The sparse facts alleged in the First Amended Complaint are random, non-specific,
unconnected. Specific facts that would be adequate to support each element of any of the
alleged causes of action are absent. Taken as a whole the alleged facts are unintelligible
and completely fail to state any claim upon which relief can be granted against either the
HENDERSON DEFENDANTS or any of them.
A motion to dismiss should be granted if the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for
relief that is plausible on its face. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007).
While all allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the light most
favorable to the nonmoving party, conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted
inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss. Associated Gen. Contractors v.
Met. Water Dist. of S. Cal., 159 F.3d 1178, 1181 (9th Cir. 1998).
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint fails to articulate a factual basis for a plausible
claim for any of the causes of actions alleged against the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS or
any of them. Dismissal of all claims against the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS for failure to
state a claim is appropriate.
III.
PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO ALLEGE FACTS WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A
VIOLATION OF ANY OF PLAINTIFF’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BY ANY OF THE
HENDERSON DEFENDANTS
To state a claim for relief under Section 1983, a plaintiff must state facts, not
conclusions and must show through his factual allegations the specific direct involvement
of a defendant in the constitutional deprivation alleged. Barren v. Harrington, 153 F. 3d
1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998). In order to state a Section 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege
5

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 6 of 21
two essential elements: (1) that a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United
States was violated, and (2) that the alleged violation was committed by a person acting
under the color of State law. Long v. County of L.A., 442 F.3d 1178, 1185 (9th Cir.2006)
(citing West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988).
In the instant matter, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is devoid factual
allegations which, if taken as true, would establish any viable claim against the
HENDERSON DEFENDANTS, or any of them, for a violation of any of Plaintiff’s
constitutional rights.

Officer PERDUE’S alleged conduct, if taken as true, does not

establish a constitutional violation. He allegedly identified himself as a police officer and
allegedly “slapped” his badge shield against the passenger window of Plaintiff’s already
stopped vehicle. Neither of those actions separately or combined establishes a violation
of a constitutional right.

Yelling or using profanity is likewise not a violation of a

constitutional right. There are no facts which support Plaintiff’s conclusory allegation that
circumstances existed which would have required PERDUE to intervene or prevent
NIELSON’S alleged conduct. See paragraphs 24 and 29.
Factual allegations sufficient to establish any plausible claim under Section 1983
against the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS, or any of them, are absent from Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff’s First and Second Claims for Relief as they
pertain to each of the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS should be dismissed.
IV.
PLAINTIFF HAS NOT ADEQUATELY ALLEGED A CLAIM FOR MUNICIPAL LIABILITY
PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. 1983 PURSUANT TO THE MONELL CASE AND HIS
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION SHOULD BE DISMISSED
Plaintiff has not identified any constitutional rights which are contended to have
been violated by the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS or any of them. Identification of a
6

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 7 of 21
violated constitutional right is absolutely required to establish a §1983 claim. Albright v.
Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S. Ct. 807, 811, 127 L.Ed.2d 114
(1994). If Plaintiffs have not suffered a violation of their constitutional rights, no action lies
pursuant to Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 98
S. Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) for municipal liability and dismissal is appropriate.
Even if it were determined that Plaintiff had somehow alleged a specific violation of
his constitutional rights here, he has failed to set forth sufficient factual allegations to
survive a motion to dismiss. His allegations throughout the First Amended Complaint, as
well as those specifically alleged in his Third Claim for Relief, are nothing more than
generalized and formulaic recitations which fail to articulate a cognizable theory of public
entity liability against the CITY. The allegations concerning municipal liability have no
specific reference or application to the scant facts alleged by Plaintiff. The allegations are
speculative and conclusory and fail to articulate a plausible claim against the CITY.
In Monell, supra, the United States Supreme Court held that a municipality, such as
the City of Henderson, may only be subject to liability under Section 1983 when it is the
moving force, pursuant to an existing policy or custom, which results in the alleged
constitutional tort. Monell, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91 (1978). It is only when the "execution of
the government's policy or custom ... inflicts the injury" that a municipality may be held
liable under Section 1983. Id. at 694. Section 1983 provides in relevant part:
Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,
custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,
subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen … to the deprivation of
any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,
shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or
other proper proceeding for redress … 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
(Emphasis added).
The Supreme Court held in Monell that the plain language and legislative history of
7

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 8 of 21
Section 1983 clearly shows that Congress did not intend for municipalities, like the City of
Henderson, "to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy … caused
a constitutional tort." At p. 691 (emphasis added).

Here the factual allegations are

inadequate, even if taken as true, to establish a constitutional tort. In the absence of a
constitutional tort there can be no municipal liability.
In determining whether official municipal policy is the cause of a constitutional tort, it
is not enough for a § 1983 plaintiff to merely identify conduct alleged to be attributable to
the municipality." Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404, 117
S. Ct. 1382, 1388 (1997). A governmental entity can only be liable under § 1983 when the
execution of that entity’s policy or custom, “whether made by its lawmakers or by those
whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury.” Id. at
694.
Paragraph 49 delineates the basis of Plaintiff’s claim alleged against the CITY:
The unconstitutional actions and/or omissions of the Defendant officers,
as well as other officers employed by or acting on behalf of Defendants
LVMPD and Henderson, “on information and belief”, are alleged to have
been pursuant to the following customs, policies, practices, and/or
procedures of LVMPD and Henderson, stated in the alternative, which
were directed, encouraged, allowed, and/or ratified by policy making
officers for the LVMPD and Henderson:
A.

To arrest and or detain individuals for traffic violations by
handcuffing citizens and the use of pain compliance techniques on
traffic stops.

B.

To fail to use appropriate and generally accepted law enforcement
procedures by undercover officers.

C.

To fail to use appropriate and generally accepted law enforcement
procedures in requiring use of force reports to be used where an
injury occurs.

D.

To cover-up violations of constitutional rights by any or all of the
following:
8

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 9 of 21
i.

by failing to properly investigate and/or evaluate complaints
or incidents of excessive and unreasonable force, and
unlawful seizures and arrests, and/or handling of injured
citizens;

ii

by ignoring and/or failing to properly and adequately
investigate and discipline unconstitutional or unlawful police
activity by refusing to conduct a full internal affairs complaint
against the Defendant officer; and by failing to advise
citizens of the violation and findings and disciplines.

iii

by allowing, tolerating, and/or encouraging police officers to:
fail to file complete and accurate police reports; file false
police reports; make false statements and/or to attempt to
bolster officers’ stories; and/or obstruct or interfere with
investigations of unconstitutional or unlawful police conduct,
by withholding and/or concealing material information.

E.

To allow, tolerate, and/or encourage a “code of silence” among law
enforcement officers and police department personnel, whereby an
officer or member of the department does not provide adverse
information against a fellow officer or member of the department;
and

F.

To tolerate poorly performing officers and failing to adequately
discipline those officers for misconduct.

In order to state a claim for any of the theories alleged in ¶49 each made “upon
information and belief”, there must be specific factual allegations to establish the
unsupported conclusions and complete speculation set forth in ¶49. Plaintiff has failed to
meet the rigorous Monell standards. Plaintiff’s allegations of municipal liability are nothing
more than formulaic recitations and are inadequate to state a claim. See Dougherty, 654
F.3d at 900-01 (dismissing § 1983 claims where plaintiffs' claims, as those here, lacked
any factual allegations regarding key elements of Monell).
The Ninth Circuit has held pursuant to Monell that municipalities are subject to
damages under § 1983 only when the plaintiff has been injured pursuant to an expressly
adopted official policy, a long-standing practice or custom, or the decision of a “final
policymaker.” Ellins v. City of Sierra Madre, 710 F.3d 1049, 1066 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting
9

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 10 of 21
Delia v. City of Rialto, 621 F.3d 1069, 1081–82 (9th Cir. 2010)).
To establish the liability of a governmental entity under Monell pursuant to a theory
that an official policy, longstanding practice, and/or custom was the basis for the
constitutional tort, a plaintiff must allege and allege facts which would establish that: (1)
the plaintiff was deprived of a constitutional right deprived; (2) that the municipality had a
policy; (3) that such policy amounted to deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's subject
constitutional right; and (4) such policy was the moving force behind the constitutional
violation. Dougherty v. City of Covina, 654 F.3d 892, 900 (9th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 133
S. Ct. 1725, 185 L. Ed. 2d 786 (2013) (citing Plumeau v. Sch. Dist. No. 40 Cnty. of
Yamhill, 130 F.3d 432, 438 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted;
alterations in original). Here Plaintiff fails to plead factual allegations which meet any of
the three (3) requirements articulated in Monell. Instead, Plaintiff relies on non-specific,
conclusory and conjectural allegations potentially covering vast areas of law enforcement
practice, all of which are premised upon “information and belief.”
It is well established that in a Section 1983 action a municipality cannot be held
liable on a theory of respondeat superior. Burns v.Barreto, 2011 WL 476505, 4 (E.D. Cal.
2011); Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611
(1978). In Burns, supra, the court outlined the requirements to establish municipal liability
in a Section 1983 action as follows:
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that in order to establish
municipal liability, “the plaintiff must establish: (1) that he [or she]
possessed a constitutional right of which he [or she] was deprived; (2) that
the municipality had a policy; (3) that this policy amounts to deliberate
indifference to the plaintiff's constitutional right; and (4) that the policy was
the moving force behind the constitutional violation.” Miranda v. City of
Cornelius, 429 F.3d 858, 868 (9th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation marks
omitted, modification in original); see also Levine, 525 F.3d at 907 (“To
establish [municipal] liability, a plaintiff must establish that he was
deprived of a constitutional right and that the city had a policy, practice, or
10

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 11 of 21
custom which amounted to ‘deliberate indifference’ to the constitutional
right and was the ‘moving force’ behind the constitutional violation.”) (citing
Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, 92 F.3d 831, 835 (9th Cir.1996)). With
respect to the last element, “[t]here must be a direct causal link between a
municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional
deprivation.” Villegas v. Gilroy Garlic Festival Ass'n, 541 F.3d 950, 957
(9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
In Barren, supra, the lower court had granted defendants’ motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim pursuant to Section 1983. The U.S. Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit
affirmed the dismissal on appeal. The complaint in issue was summarized by the 9th
Circuit as follows:
Barren's complaint comprised four separate allegations. Count I alleged
that the defendants had conspired to deny him his Fourth Amendment
rights by bringing charges against him without probable cause, thus
causing him to be incarcerated for 156 days before the charges were
dismissed. Count II alleged that his due process rights were violated when
he was held from May 1995 to October 1995 without a hearing. Count III
alleged that he was denied the equal protection of the laws and was
denied his First Amendment right of access to the courts when the
defendants caused his brass slip requesting payment of a court ordered
$5 filing fee, to be denied. Count IV alleged that the appellant was denied
access to the courts when his brass slip was denied, resulting in the
dismissal of his lawsuit, Barren v. Harrington, CV-N-96-254-DWH. At
1194.
A municipality is only liable if a municipal policy is a driving force behind the
constitutional deprivation. Villegas, supra; Galen v. County of Los Angeles, 477 F. 3d 652,
667 (9th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint has failed to allege facts which
would state any plausible claim for relief against the CITY for municipal liability under
Section 1983 pursuant under the Monell case. Plaintiff’s Third Claim for Relief should be
dismissed.
V.
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY PRECLUDES PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS AGAINST
DEFENDANT MOERS
Qualified immunity protects all government officials and employees, including police
11

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 12 of 21
officers, from suit in their individual capacities for actions taken within the scope of their
discretionary authority while acting under the color of state law. Somavia v. Las Vegas
Metro. Police Dep’t, 816 F. Supp. 638, 641 (D. Nev. 1993), aff'd, 15 F.3d 1089 (9th Cir.
1994). Not only does qualified immunity protect "'all but the plainly incompetent or those
who knowingly violate the law,'" [Estate of Ford v. Ramirez-Palmer, 301 F.3d 1043, 1049
(9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986))], it "generally protects
government officials so long as their conduct does not 'violate clearly established statutory
or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'" Herrera, 298 F.
Supp. 2d at 1051 (quoting Baker v. Racansky, 887 F.2d 183, 186 (9th Cir.1989)).
Discretionary authority includes all acts undertaken pursuant to the performance of the
official's duties that are within the scope of his or her authority.
“The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials 'from [personal]
liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established
statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'"
Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009) (quoting
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982)). To
determine if an official is protected by qualified immunity and therefore entitled to dismissal
of the claims against him, a court must ask "whether the plaintiff has alleged the
deprivation of an actual constitutional right" and "whether that right was clearly established
at the time of the alleged violations." Int'l Action Ctr. v. United States, 365 F.3d 20, 24, 361
U.S. App. D.C. 108 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Courts may "exercise their sound discretion in
deciding which of the two prongs ... should be addressed first in light of the circumstances
in the particular case at hand." Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236.

12

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 13 of 21
The second inquiry "must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,
not as a broad general proposition ... 'The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear
that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.'"
Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001) (quoting
Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987)). A
court must determine whether "it would be clear to a reasonable [official] that his conduct
was unlawful in the situation he confronted." Id. at 202.
Even if a law enforcement officer violates an individual's constitutional rights, the
officer may be protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Qualified immunity shields a
public official from individual liability for civil damages under § 1983, so long as his
conduct does not “violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.
Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). “Qualified immunity balances two important interests-the
need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the
need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their
duties reasonably. The protection of qualified immunity applies regardless of whether the
[police officer's] error is a mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed
questions of law and fact.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). See also, Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2012 U.S.
LEXIS 4132, 2012 WL 1969351 (2012).
The qualified immunity determination is a question of law, and the trial court has an
independent obligation to survey the relevant law to determine whether a constitutional
right was violated and whether that right was clearly established. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472

13

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 14 of 21
U.S. 511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985); Ennis v. Lott, 589 F. Supp. 2d 33,
36-37 (D.D.C. 2008).
It is abundantly clear that Plaintiff has failed to proffer factual allegations that would
establish that either MOERS or PERDUE violated clearly established statutory or
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. The factual
allegations are inadequate to articulate any claim for which the protection of qualified
immunity would not apply. Defendants MOERS and PERDUE should be found to have
qualified immunity premised upon the facts alleged (or lack thereof) and the claims for
relief asserted against them should be dismissed.
VI.
PLAINTIFF’S STATE LAW CLAIMS SHOULD BE DISMISSED
Plaintiff’s state law claims suffer from the same lack of factual support as the
Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims. Having failed to allege adequate facts to articulate the elements
of any of the state law claims, all of Plaintiff’s state law claims should be dismissed for
failure to state a claim.
VII.
PLAINTIFF’S INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS CLAIMS
AGAINST ALL OF THE HENDERSON DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE DISMISSED
In his Fifth Cause of Action Plaintiff alleges a claim against all Defendants for
intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED).

The only factual allegation made in

support of the claims is:
63.

Defendant Officer Nielson and Detective Purdue‘s (sic) use of force
by handcuffing and false imprisonment of Plaintiff was extreme and
outrageous causing Plaintiff to suffer emotional distress and was
done intentionally and maliciously.

In Nevada an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim requires proof (1) that
14

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 15 of 21
the defendant's conduct was "extreme and outrageous," (2) that the defendant either
intended to cause or recklessly disregarded the risk of causing emotional distress, (3) that
the plaintiff actually suffered severe or extreme emotional distress, and (4) that the
distress was actually or proximately the result of the defendant's conduct. Nelson v. City of
Las Vegas, 99 Nev. 548, 665 P.2d 1141, 1145 (Nev. 1983).
There are no factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint which would
establish the elements of IIED against any of the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS. Plaintiff’s
Fifth Claim for Relief should be dismissed as to all of the HENDERSON DEFENDANTS.
VIII.
PLAINTIFF HAS NOT STATED A CLAIM FOR RELIEF AGAINST CHIEF MOERS ON
ANY OF PLAINTIFF’S STATE LAW CLAIMS
Plaintiff’s Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claims for Relief pursuant to State law are
asserted against all Defendants.

There are insufficient facts alleged to establish the

elements of any of the state law claims alleged with respect to CHIEF MOERS. There is
no allegation that CHIEF MOERS was present when the acts complained of occurred.
There is nothing alleged in the First Amended Complaint which establishes any basis for
CHIEF MOERS to be individually liable for the state tort claims alleged. MOERS did not
have any relationship with PERDUE which would cause MOERS to be vicariously liable for
PERDUE’S conduct for False Arrest/False Imprisonment, IIED or Negligence. MOERS is
not alleged to have been present when any of the conduct upon which Plaintiff’s State law
claims is based occurred. It is not alleged that MOERS was involved or participated in the
incident out of which Plaintiff’s claims arise.
Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief against CHIEF MOERS for False Arrest,
False Imprisonment or Negligence and those claims as alleged against CHIEF MOERS
should be dismissed.

IX.
THE PLAINTIFFS STATE LAW CLAIM AGAINST CHIEF MOERS ARE BARRED BY
NRS 41.0335
NRS 41.0335(1)(b) precludes any action against a chief of a police department,
based solely on any act or omission of an officer of the department. MOERS has not been
alleged to have been present at the alleged stop of Plaintiff on March 8, 2013, nor to have
had any involvement. Although insufficient facts are alleged to state any claims under
State law, it is clear from the titles of the State Claims for Relief that an individual
Defendant would have to have had actual involvement in the acts or omissions necessary
for such claims in order to be liable. MOERS cannot be liable just because he was the
chief of the CITY OF HENDERSON Police Department. The Plaintiff’s Fourth, Fifth and
Sixth Claims for Relief against MOERS should be dismissed pursuant to the provisions of
NRS 41.0335.
X.
THIS COURT LACKS SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF’S
STATE LAW CLAIMS
Federal law confers supplemental jurisdiction on the district courts:
[I]n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the
district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims
that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction
that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the
United States Constitution.
28 U.S.C. 1367(a). A district court may only invoke its supplemental jurisdiction when
there is a “hook of original jurisdiction on which to hang it.” Herman Family Revocable
Trust v. Teddy Bear, 254 F.3d 802, 805 (9th Cir. 2001).

Section 1367 authorizes district

courts to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendent claims when it has
dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). As
16

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 17 of 21
the United States Supreme Court has held, supplemental jurisdiction “is a doctrine of
discretion, not of plaintiff’s right.” United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726
(1966).
In Gibbs, the Court made clear that the purpose of supplemental jurisdiction over
pendent state law claims is to promote judicial economy, convenience and fairness. Id.
When these considerations are absent, a federal court should be reticent to exercise
jurisdiction. Id. The Court explained that “if the federal claims are dismissed before trial,
even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be
dismissed as well.” Id.
Here, the dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims over which this Court would have original
jurisdiction, necessitates the dismissal of Plaintiff’s state law claims for which its
jurisdiction would be supplemental. The dismissal of Plaintiff’s state law claims would
most effectively promote judicial economy, convenience and fairness because Plaintiff
could pursue any state law claims that survive dismissal in a Nevada state court.
XI.
THE CLAIM FOR EXEMPLARY (PUNITIVE) DAMAGES AGAINST THE CITY IS
BARRED AND SHOULD BE DISMISSED
Separate allegations supporting a claim for exemplary damages are not included,
but Plaintiff has asked for an award of exemplary damages in his prayer for relief. Punitive
damages are not recoverable against the CITY on either the state or federal claims
alleged.
NRS 41.031 addresses the circumstances and conditions under which immunity is
waived to sue political subdivisions of the State of Nevada, including the CITY OF
HENDERSON. NRS 41.035(1) specifically provides that, an award for damages in an

17

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 18 of 21
action sounding in tort brought under NRS 41.031 “may not include any amount as
exemplary or punitive damages.”
It is, likewise, well established that punitive damages are not recoverable against a
municipality for Plaintiff’s federal law claims. In City of Newport v. Facts Concerts, Inc.,
453 U.S. 247, 266, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 2760, 69 L. Ed. 2d 616 (1981), a Section 1983 action,
the Court discussed the background and basis for the fact that punitive damages are not
awardable against a municipality. Punitive damages are not intended to compensate an
injured party, but instead to punish the tortfeasor and deter him and others from engaging
in the damaging conduct in the future.

In concluding that punitive damages are not

awardable against a municipality, the court stated:
[i]ndeed, punitive damages imposed on a municipality are in effect a
windfall to a fully compensated plaintiff, and are likely accompanied by an
increase in taxes or a reduction of services for the citizens footing the bill.
Neither reason nor justice suggests that such retribution should be visited
upon the shoulders of blameless or unknowing taxpayers. At p. 266, 2760.
There is no basis as a matter of law for an award of punitive damages against the
CITY OF HENDERSON in the instant matter, and the claim for an award of punitive
damages should therefore be dismissed.
Even viewing the factual allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is no
basis in fact or theory which would allow Plaintiff to recover punitive damages from
MOERS.

The claim for punitive damages against Defendant MOERS should also be

dismissed.
XII.
PLAINTIFF’S PRAYER FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE DISMISSED
Plaintiff alleges as follows in paragraph 4 of his First Amended Complaint, under
the heading “Jurisdiction”:
18

Case 2:15-cv-00337-GMN-PAL Document 39 Filed 09/10/15 Page 19 of 21
4.

Plaintiff also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief concerning
Defendant Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s and City of
Henderson’s willful violation with the compliance of the Freedom of
Information Act.

Plaintiff does not include a separate cause of action concerning the matters alleged
in paragraph 4, but in his prayer for damages seeks the following:
5.

Declaratory judgement that LVMPD and Henderson have chosen
not to comply with Plaintiff’s FOIA requests and injunctive relief
requiring the Defendants to do so.

Plaintiff does not state a claim for declaratory relief and his prayer for the remedy of
declaratory judgment should be dismissed.

The State of Nevada does not have a

“Freedom of Information Act”, so it must be presumed that the Act to which Plaintiff refers
is the Federal Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 551 and 552. It is well
established that FOIA only applies to agencies of the executive branch of the United
States government. Obama v. Draker, 664 F. 3d 774 (9th Cir. 2011); Moore v. United
Kingdom, 384 F. 3d 1079 (9th Cir. 2004). It does not apply to the CITY OF HENDERSON
which is a political subdivision of the State of Nevada. The court has no authority to
expand the scope of application of FOIA and there is no claim that Plaintiff can legally
pursue under FOIA against the parties to this action. Therefore, the requested declaratory
relief is not available as a matter of law and the claim asserted through the prayer for relief
should be dismissed.
XIII.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants CITY OF HENDERSON, OFFICER
PERDUE and CHIEF PATRICK MOERS respectfully request that this Honorable Court
