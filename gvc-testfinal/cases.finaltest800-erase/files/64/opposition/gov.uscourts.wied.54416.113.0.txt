UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

SIX STAR HOLDINGS, LLC and
FEROL, LLC
Plaintiffs,
v.

Case No. 10-C-893

CITY OF MILWAUKEE,
Defendant.
CITY RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR
AN AWARD OF NOMINAL DAMAGES BY THE COURT
TO PLAINTIFF SIX STAR HOLDINGS, LLC
______________________________________________________________________________
The City of Milwaukee respectfully requests the district court to deny the
plaintiff’s motion for an award of nominal damages by the court to plaintiff Six
Star Holdings, LLC (Document 109). Plaintiff Six Star Holdings, LLC has
abandoned its claim for alleged damages and neither plaintiff Six Star
Holdings, LLC or plaintiff Ferol, LLC may seek damages in connection with the
court’s March 13, 2013 Decision and Order.
In plaintiff’s response number 7 to the defendant’s first set of
interrogatories, plaintiffs stated “Plaintiffs will not attempt to prove any
damages in connection with the March 13, 2013 decision and order.

The

plaintiffs will only be proving damages in connection with the August 28, 2013
decision and order.” See, Response 7, Plaintiffs’ Response to Defendant’s First
Set of Interrogatories, March 7, 2014 (attached hereto, emphasis added).

Case 2:10-cv-00893-LA Filed 02/06/15 Page 1 of 3 Document 113

Further, in plaintiffs’ corrected response to Defendants’ First Set of
Requests to Admit dated March 24, 2014, plaintiffs admitted that “Plaintiff Six
Star Holdings, LLC will not seek any damages from the City of Milwaukee based
upon the district court’s previous decisions and order relative to its previous
theater license applications.” (Also attached hereto, emphasis added).
The court should deny the plaintiffs’ motion for nominal damages award
based upon sworn representations that they made to the City of Milwaukee in
March, 2014. Plaintiffs should not be permitted by the court to mislead the
defendant City of Milwaukee during the pendency of this litigation prior to the
close of discovery in this case. Frankly, this plaintiff’s motion two weeks before
jury trial is totally inappropriate given their prior admission and interrogatory
response.
Because plaintiff Six Star Holdings, LLC has twice denied that it will seek
any damages as a result of its 2011 theater license application for the 730
North Old World Third Street location or this court’s opinion of March 18,
2013, this motion in limine should be denied and the court should consider
ordering plaintiffs to pay for the costs of this response.
