IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE Eastern DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

SIX STAR HOLDINGS, LLC
and FEROL, LLC,
v.

Case No. 10-cv-893

CITY OF MILWAUKEE

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
FOR AN AWARD OF NOMINAL DAMAGES BY THE COURT
TO PLAINTIFF SIX STAR HOLDINGS, LLC

The Plaintiffs, Six Star Holdings, LLC, and Ferol, LLC, by their attorneys, The Jeff
Scott Olson Law Firm, S. C. by Jeff Scott Olson, hereby moves the Court to resolve the
claims of Plaintiff Six Star Holdings, LLC, in this case, by entering an award of nominal
damages in the amount of one dollar in favor of Plaintiff Six Star Holdings, LLC, and
against the Defendant city of Milwaukee.
The grounds for this motion are that the Plaintiffs do not intend to submit any
evidence of compensatory damages on behalf of Plaintiff Six Star Holdings, LLC, and it
may not recover punitive damages against a city, but it has established a violation of its
1
Case 2:10-cv-00893-LA Filed 01/30/15 Page 1 of 4 Document 109

constitutional rights, which entitles it to an award of nominal damages. “In an action
brought pursuant to Section 1983, “even when a litigant fails to prove actual
compensable injury, he is entitled to an award of nominal damages upon proof of
violation of a substantive constitutional right.” McKinney v. Rogers, 1995 WL 358655, at
*4 (N.D. Ind. 1995)(internal citations and quotation marks omitted); “Having vindicated
his constitutional rights, Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of nominal damages.
Smith v. City of Chicago, 913 F.2d 469, 473 (7th Cir.1990)(“Although compensatory
damages could not be recovered for a constitutional violation, absent a demonstration
of actual injury resulting from the constitutional violation, an award of nominal
damages would still be appropriate,” citing Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266–267
(1978)).
If Six Star’s case were submitted to the jury, and the Plaintiffs declined introduce
any evidence of actual damages to Six Star, as they plan, the jury would be directed to
enter a mandatory verdict for nominal damages. The concluding sentence of Seventh
Circuit Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 7.23 reads: “If you find in favor of Plaintiff but find
that the plaintiff has failed to prove compensatory damages, you must return a verdict
for Plaintiff in the amount of one dollar ($1.00).” (emphasis supplied.) Where, as here, it
is already established that a Plaintiff’s constitutional rights have been violated, that that
particular Plaintiff does not intend to introduce any evidence of damages, and that
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of nominal damages as a matter of law, there is nothing

for the jury to decide as to that Plaintiff, and the court should enter an award of
nominal damages.
