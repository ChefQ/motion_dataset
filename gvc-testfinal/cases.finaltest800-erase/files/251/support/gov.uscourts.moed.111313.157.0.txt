Case No. 11-CV-00077

UNITED STATES’ MOTION FOR VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL OF CERTAIN
CLAIMS IN THE AMENDED COMPLAINT
Pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff United States,
acting on behalf of United State Environmental Protection Agency, hereby moves for voluntary
dismissal of certain claims in the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 36) as described more fully
below. Plaintiff United States makes this motion to narrow and simplify the issues in this case,
thereby eliminating the need for further discovery or motions practice on the claims to be
dismissed.
1.

The First Claim for Relief (paragraphs 65-70) is voluntarily dismissed with

prejudice.
2.

The Second Claim for Relief (paragraphs 71 through 76) is voluntarily dismissed

with prejudice.
3.

The Fifth Claim for Relief is voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, but only to the

extent the Fifth Claim for Relief is based upon the primary superheater and turbine construction

projects performed at Rush Island Unit 1 during the 2001 through 2002 outage, as alleged in the
First Claim for Relief.
4.

The Sixth Claim for Relief is voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, but only to the

extent the Sixth Claim for Relief is based upon the primary superheater and turbine construction
projects performed at Rush Island Unit 2 during the 2003 through 2004 outage, as alleged in the
Second Claim for Relief.
If the Court grants this motion, the United States will, as expeditiously as reasonably
possible thereafter, file and serve via the Court’s CM/ECF system a Second Amended Complaint
that reflects voluntarily dismissal of the foregoing claims.
Respectfully submitted on this 1st day of October, 2013.
