MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

Beth Maxwell Stratton (the "Trustee") has filed a Motion to Sell (the

"Motion") three promissory notes and trust deeds (the "Assets"). Achab
objects.
The Motion (Docket Control No.: BMS-2) is not in the best interest of

the estate. The sale prices stated in the Motion do not represent the fair
market value of the Assets. The offer Achab sent to the trustee (Exhibit 1)
proves that the trustee can sell each of the 3 Assets for a price that is
at least $500 higher than the sale price stated in the Motion. Furthermore,
by filing a Motion To Sell that states that the sales are subject to higher
and better offers at the Sale Hearing, there is a possibility that one or
more of the notes will sell for an even higher price than the price offered
by Achab to the Trustee. ,

Wherefore, Achab requests that the Motion to Sell be denied.
