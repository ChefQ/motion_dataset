payments on the note from May 2010 forward.

6. NOTE No. 3: This is a promissory note by Veronica Brambila dated October
27, 2006, for the principal sum of $69,792.00 with interest from November 1, 2006, at the
rate of 7.75%, payable in monthly installments of $500.00 due the first day of each month
beginning December 2006, continuing until November 1, 2036, or paid. The note is secured
by a deed of trust on the real property located at 3812 E. Mono, Fresno, California. The
current fair market value of the real property is estimated to be between $35,000 to $38,000.
The principal balance owed on the property at the time of the bankruptcy filing, was
approximately $68,529.24. Trustee has received 16 payments. Old Dominion Capital has
offered to purchase the Note and Deed of Trust for $19,000.00. Buyer shall pay for all title
insurance. Buyer and seller shall split the costs of escrow. Buyer shall be entitled to all

7. Trustee has been receiving the monthly payments for each of the three real
properties, which would continue for years to come. In order to bring this bankruptcy estate
to a close, it is necessary for Trustee to sell the notes. Trustee believes the sale to Old
Dominion Capital is beneficial to the creditors and that the prices are justified given the low
values of the property.

WHEREFORE, Trustee prays that the sale of the Notes and Deeds of Trust to Old

Dominion Capital be approved.
