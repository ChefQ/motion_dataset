CIVIL ACTION NO.
2:16-cv-00694-MHH

DEFENDANT’S SUR-REPLY IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (“Nationstar”) files this Surreply in
Opposition to Plaintiffs Tommy and Katrina Heard’s Motion for Summary
Judgment (ECF No. 47) and states as follows.
I.

The D.C. Circuit’s pending decision in ACA International will control
the definition of an “Automatic Telephone Dialing System” – not the
Meyer ruling.
Plaintiffs contend that an unpublished federal district court decision from

California somehow is dispositive of whether Nationstar’s dialing system
constitutes an “automatic telephone dialing system” (ATDS) under the TCPA.
(See Pls.’ Summ. J. Reply (ECF No. 53) at 2 (citing Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery
Assocs., LLC, No. 3:11-cv-1008, 2011 WL 11712610 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2011))).
Yet, under the federal Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2342(1), district courts have no

30475869 v1

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 56 Filed 09/12/17 Page 2 of 7

jurisdiction to challenge or overturn final agency orders like the July 10, 2015 FCC
Order regarding the definition of an ATDS. Instead, only federal courts of appeals
have exclusive jurisdiction to review such final FCC decisions. See Murphy v.
DCI Biologicals Orlando, LLC, 797 F.3d 1302, 1306-07 (11th Cir. 2015); Mais v.
Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc., 768 F.3d 1110, 1119 (11th Cir. 2014). “This
procedural path created by the command of Congress ‘promotes judicial efficiency,
vests an appellate panel rather than a single district judge with the power of agency
review, and allows ‘uniform, nationwide interpretation of the federal statute by the
centralized expert agency created by Congress’ to enforce the TCPA.’” Mais, 768
F.3d at 1119 (quoting CE Design, Ltd. v. Prism Bus. Media, Inc., 606 F.3d 443,
450 (7th Cir. 2010)). The Hobbs Act is critical here because the D.C. Circuit in
ACA International will decide the issue currently pending before this Court:
whether the FCC’s broad definition of an ATDS exceeds its agency powers under
the TCPA. (See Nationstar’s Summ. J. Opp’n Mem. (ECF No. 51) at 11-16).
The Meyer decision, upon which Plaintiffs so heavily rely, was an
unpublished district court decision on a preliminary injunction motion. See Meyer,
2011 WL 11712610, at *6. The defendant did not even contest the ATDS issue on
appeal to the Ninth Circuit. See Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707
F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2012). More importantly, the Meyer decision rested on
the FCC’s 2003 Order, which found that a “predictive dialer” with the “capacity”

30475869 v1

2

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 56 Filed 09/12/17 Page 3 of 7

to dial numbers without human intervention constitutes an ATDS. See Meyer,
2011 WL 11712610, at *6 n.10 (citing In re Rules & Regs. Implementing the
TCPA, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, 14091-93 (2003)). But this aspect of the 2003 FCC
Order — that predictive dialers have the “capacity” to be an ATDS — was
incorporated into the July 10, 2015 FCC Order, which is on appeal to the D.C.
Circuit in ACA International. See In re Rules & Regs. Implementing the TCPA, 30
FCC Rcd. 7961, 7973-74 (2015). As discussed above, the Hobbs Act requires that
only a federal court of appeals — like the D.C. Circuit in ACA International — has
the power to set aside a final FCC order on a direct appeal from that order.
Murphy, 797 F.3d at 1306-07; Mais, 768 F.3d at 1119. Thus, rather than looking
to the unpublished district court decision in Meyer, this Court should stay this
action pending the outcome of the D.C. Circuit’s controlling decision in ACA
International. (See Nationstar’s Summ. J. Opp’n Mem. at 11-16).
II.

Nationstar’s actions were not “willful or knowing”; at the very least,
issues of disputed material fact bar summary judgment on this point.
Plaintiffs concede that Eleventh Circuit law requires that Nationstar must

have been aware that it used an ATDS in order to be liable for a “knowing or
willful” TCPA violation. (See Pls.’ Summ. J. Reply at 3 (citing Alea London Ltd.
v. Am. Home Servs., Inc., 638 F.3d 768, 776 (11th Cir. 2011))). For the reasons
articulated in the previous section and in its opposition brief, Nationstar has
established that it had — and continues to have — a good faith belief that its

30475869 v1

3

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 56 Filed 09/12/17 Page 4 of 7

equipment is not an ATDS and does not violate the TCPA. In addition, Plaintiffs
completely fail to address Nationstar’s assertion that it has policies and practices in
place to stop calling borrowers when a revocation request is made, (see Def.’s
Resp. & Counterstatement to Pls.’ Statement of Facts (ECF No. 52) ¶ 128), which
further shows Nationstar’s lack of “knowing or willful” conduct under the TCPA.
III.

Eleventh Circuit law is entirely consistent with the Second Circuit’s
Reyes ruling.
Plaintiffs assert that the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Osorio v. State Farm

Bank, F.S.B., 746 F.3d 1242, 1255 (11th Cir. 2014), which held that oral
revocation generally is allowed under the TCPA, is inconsistent with the Second
Circuit’s recent holding in Reyes that contractual consent to receive automated
calls cannot be unilaterally revoked once it is given. (Pls.’ Summ. J. Reply at 7-8).
But there is nothing inconsistent about these two decisions. Osorio expressly
excepted contractual calls from its holding: “We . . . conclude that Betancourt and
Osario, in the absence of any contractual restriction to the contrary, were free to
orally revoke any consent previously given to State Farm to call No. 8626 in
connection with Betancourt’s credit-card debt.”

Osario, 746 F.3d at 1255

(emphasis added). Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit recently reiterated this limitation
on the Osorio holding: “In Osorio, we applied common-law consent principles
and held that, absent a contractual restriction to the contrary, the TCPA allows a

30475869 v1

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 56 Filed 09/12/17 Page 5 of 7

consumer to orally revoke her consent to receive automated calls.” Schweitzer v.
Comenity Bank, 866 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir. 2017) (emphasis added).
IV.

Plaintiffs have not established any actual prejudice from the timing of
Nationstar’s res judicata defense for calls made before October 14, 2015.
Plaintiffs assert that Nationstar waived its res judicata defense based on the

Wright class action settlement by not raising it earlier. However, that defense did
not even exist until at least October 25, 2016, when the Seventh Circuit dismissed
the last remaining appeal from the final approval order in the Wright action. (See
Seventh Circuit Appeal No. 16-3537, Oct. 25, 2016 Order dismissing appeal).
Nationstar filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses in this case over four months
earlier, on June 13, 2016 (ECF No. 9), and the undersigned counsel did not
substitute into the case as counsel of record until August 1, 2016 and November
11, 2016. (See ECF Nos. 17, 27-28, 30-31).
Moreover, aside from a vague and unsupported assertion that raising the
defense “would violate the due process clause,” (Pls.’ Summ. J. Reply at 10),
Plaintiffs fail to articulate any actual prejudice they have suffered as a result of
Nationstar’s raising the res judicata defense when it did. Plaintiffs’ assertion that
they may not be part of the settlement class in Wright is without merit. In fact, a
postcard class notice was mailed to the Heards at their address of record in
Alexandria, Alabama, and was not returned.
