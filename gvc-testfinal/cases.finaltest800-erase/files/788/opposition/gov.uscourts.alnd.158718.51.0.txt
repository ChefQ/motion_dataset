DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (“Nationstar”), by its counsel, files
this Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs Tommy and Katrina Heard’s
(“Plaintiffs”) Motion for Summary Judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (ECF No.
47) (the “Motion”). Defendant requests that Plaintiffs’ Motion be denied because
there are disputed issues of material fact for the trier of fact to review, which
preclude judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor.
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs ask this Court to grant summary judgment as to both their

Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) and Fair Credit Reporting Act
(“FCRA”) claims. However, Plaintiff’s motion should be denied because disputed
issues of material fact render summary judgment inappropriate. Indeed, in some
instances, Plaintiffs have not even met their initial burden to provide evidence on
the necessary elements of their claims.

For instance, Plaintiffs seek to hold

Nationstar liable under the TCPA for calls Plaintiffs allege were made by an
automated telephone dialing system (“ATDS”), which is a threshold element of
their TCPA claim. However, the basic statutory definition of an ATDS requires
that Nationstar’s telephone system have “the capacity to store or produce telephone
numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.” 47 U.S.C.
§ 227.

30123833 v1

Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence to show that Nationstar’s

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 4 of 29

telephone system has the necessary capacity “to store or produce telephone
numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.” The only
evidence before the Court concerning the relevant capacity of Nationstar’s
telephone system is that Nationstar’s telephone system does not have the current
capacity “to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or
sequential number generator.” See Nationstar’s Response and Counterstatement to
Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts (“NSOF”) at ¶¶ 52, 130-131.
Plaintiffs also assert that Nationstar violated the FCRA by failing to conduct
a “reasonable investigation” into the Plaintiffs’ credit reporting disputes.
However, not only does the evidence before this Court tend to show that a
reasonable investigation was conducted, but the question of whether an
investigation was reasonable is routinely and properly left for the trier of fact to
determine. As such, summary judgment is not appropriate as to either of Plaintiffs’
claims and the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied.
II.

COUNTER STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS
In October of 2005, Plaintiffs refinanced their mortgage on the Property with

GMAC Mortgage.

NSOF ¶ 2. When applying to refinance their mortgage, the

Plaintiffs provided their cell phone number ending in 6545 (“Plaintiff’s Phone
Number”) on the loan application. Id. The servicing of the mortgage for the
Property was later transferred to Ocwen. NSOF at ¶ 8.

30123833 v1

2

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 5 of 29

On or about April 16 of 2015, the servicing of the mortgage on the Property
was transferred from Ocwen to Nationstar. NSOF at ¶¶ 8, 10. Prior to the transfer
of servicing from Ocwen to Nationstar, Ocwen records provided to Nationstar
show that Ocwen force placed insurance on the Property. NSOF at ¶¶ 6, 8, 10.
Thus, when the mortgage was transferred to Nationstar, it was transferred with a
negative escrow balance related to that force placed insurance. Id. When the
Plaintiffs’ mortgage was transferred from Ocwen, it had a negative escrow balance
of $329.49. NSOF at ¶ 8, 123.
Due to the force placed insurance and resulting escrow, the payment amount
due increased to cover the required escrow amount when the loan was transferred
to Nationstar. NSOF at ¶¶ 10, 14, 124. Plaintiffs’ payments in May and June 2015
were less than the amount due with the escrow amount included. NSOF at ¶¶ 10,
14, 124.

While escrow was subsequently removed from the account going

forward, Nationstar’s records for the mortgage showed a past due amount as a
result of the loan transferring with a negative escrow balance and the short
payment in or about May of 2016. NSOF at ¶¶ 10, 14, 122-125.
Nationstar attempted to contact and did contact Plaintiff Tommy Heard by
phone concerning the Mortgage and for collection purposes.

The telephone

equipment used to place many of the calls was the Avaya Proactive Contact
system. NSOF ¶¶ 52, 127. During the period of the calls at issue, the equipment

30123833 v1

3

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 6 of 29

did not have the current capacity to store or produce and dial telephone numbers to
be called using a random or sequential number generator. NSOF ¶¶ 52, 130-131.
Instead, Nationstar’s telephone equipment can only dial phone numbers that are
specifically downloaded onto it each day. Id. Nationstar’s telephone equipment
also does not, and did not, store any customer information. NSOF ¶¶ 52, 132. All
customer information, including customers’ account and contact information, is
instead stored on Nationstar’s host system. NSOF ¶¶ 52, 133.
Each day that Nationstar is making calls to its customers, it creates a list of
phone numbers to be called that day. NSOF ¶¶ 52, 134-136. That list is then
manually loaded onto the telephone equipment. Id. The list varies from day-today depending on the criteria defined by Nationstar. Id. Also, the list is manually
updated at least every hour by Nationstar based on updates to customers’ accounts.
Id. The updates to the list dictate which customers will and will not be called. Id.
In late 2015 and early 2016, Nationstar received disputes from the Plaintiffs
concerning the credit reporting of the mortgage account.

The disputes all

generically disputed the “current balance” or the “present previous account status.”
NSOF ¶¶ 75, 139-140. The disputes received from the credit bureaus requested
verification of “payment history profile, account status and payment rating.”
NSOF ¶¶ 139-141. Each dispute was individually reviewed and checked against
Nationstar’s records and payment history for the account. NSOF ¶¶ 142, 145-47.

30123833 v1

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 7 of 29

Nationstar’s agents, when investigating disputes, compare the information in the
disputes with the information within Nationstar’s records to determine if what is
being reported to the credit bureaus was consistent with the information in
Nationstar’s records.

NSOF ¶ 142.

Nationstar then updated or verified that

information accordingly. NSOF ¶ 145-147.
III.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must demonstrate

that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. See Jurich v. Compass Marine, Inc., 764 F.3d 1302,
1304 (11th Cir. 2014). Summary judgment is only appropriate if “the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, together with the
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.” Fed.
R. Civ. P. 56(c). Summary judgment is inappropriate if “the evidence is such that
a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). In determining whether a genuine
issue of material fact has been raised, the court must construe all inferences and
ambiguities against the movant and in favor of the non-moving party. United
States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962).
Additionally, the issues raised by Plaintiffs are mixed questions of law and
fact, involving the application of a legal standard to a particular set of facts. See

30123833 v1

5

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 8 of 29

TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 450 (1976). The United States
Supreme Court has noted that the underlying objective facts, even if free from
dispute, are only the starting point for determining what inferences a “reasonable”
person would draw from those facts. Id. Only if no reasonable minds could differ
about the inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts could the ultimate issue
be appropriately resolved by summary judgment. Id.
IV.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY
A.

Disputed Issues of Law and Material Fact Exist as to Whether
Nationstar Used An “Automatic Telephone Dialing System” as
Defined by the TCPA; Thus, Plaintiffs’ Motion Should be Denied
as to the TCPA Claim.

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 (the “TCPA”),
for purposes of this matter, regulates calls made to cell phones. More specifically,
the TCPA restricts when calls may be made using an “automatic telephone dialing
system” to a “telephone number assigned to a . . . cellular telephone service”
without the recipients consent. 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A). In order for Plaintiffs to
prevail on their TCPA claim, they must show that Nationstar called their cell
phone using an “automatic telephone dialing system” (ATDS) and that such calls
were made without prior consent. Id.; Buslepp v. Improv Miami, Inc., No. 12-cv60171, 2012 WL 4932692, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 16, 2012). The use of an ATDS
“is a threshold issue for liability under the TCPA.” Rose v. Wells Fargo Advisors,
LLC, No. 1:16-cv-562, 2016 WL 3369283, at *2 (N.D. Ga. June 14, 2016);

30123833 v1

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 9 of 29

Coatney v. Synchrony Bank, No. 6:16-cv-389, 2016 WL 4506315, at *2 (M.D. Fla.
Aug. 2, 2016) (“Whether Defendants used an ATDS when making telephone calls
to Plaintiff is ‘a threshold issue for liability under the TCPA and for the scope of
discovery.’” (quoting Rose, 2016 WL 3369283, at *2)).
The TCPA provides a very specific definition of the term “automated
telephone dialing system” (or “ATDS”):
The term “automatic telephone dialing system” means equipment which has
the capacity—
(A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a
random or sequential number generator; and
(B) to dial such numbers.
47 U.C.S. § 227(a)(1) (emphasis added).
Plaintiffs seek to hold Nationstar liable for allegedly calling their cell phone
using an “automatic telephone dialing system” (“ATDS”). See Motion at pp. 9-10.
However, Plaintiffs have produced no evidence whatsoever that Nationstar’s
telephone system “has the capacity to store or produce telephone numbers to be
called, using a random or sequential number generator.”

See Motion

generally; 47 U.C.S. § 227(a)(1) (emphasis added). This is because Nationstar’s
telephone system has no such capacity. NSOF ¶ 52. Nationstar cannot have
violated this provision of the TCPA with respect to the Plaintiffs because
Nationstar did not use an automatic telephone dialing system, as defined by the
TCPA, to place any of the calls at issue in this matter.
30123833 v1

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 10 of 29

When Congress passed the TCPA to regulate telemarketing in 1991,
Congress vested regulatory oversight of the TCPA to the Federal Communication
Commission. Since that time, the FCC has issued a number of regulations and
orders implementing the TCPA, including its recent order on July 10, 2015. See
In re Rules & Regs. Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 30 FCC
Rcd 7961, 7974-75 (2015) (hereinafter referred to as the “July 2015 Order”). It
was the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the question of the meaning of “capacity”
in the TCPA’s definition of an ATDS that led various industry groups to seek
clarification from the FCC that resulted in the July 2015 Order.
In the July 2015 Order, the FCC stated that, “Congress intended a broad
definition of autodialer, and that the Commission has already twice addressed the
issue in 2003 and 2008, stating that autodialers need only have the ‘capacity’ to
dial random and sequential numbers, rather than the ‘present ability’ to do so.” 30
FCC Rcd at 7974, ¶ 15. However, the FCC made it clear that under the TCPA,
equipment still must “have the ‘capacity’ to dial random and sequential numbers”
even if it does not have ‘the “present ability’ to do so.” July 2015 Order, 30 FCC
Rcd at 7974, ¶ 15 (emphasis added).

1

The FCC went on to state that, in “other

1

As discussed in Nationstar’s Motion to Stay [ECF No. 23] the FCC’s July 2015 Ruling is
currently under review in a consolidated appeal before the D.C. Circuit. Because the “July 2015
Ruling does not provide real clarity as to the difference between ‘potential’ and ‘theoretical’
capacity” numerous courts around the country have stayed pending TCPA cases to allow the
D.C. Circuit to provide needed clarity. See, e.g., Robinson v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 220 F.
Supp. 3d 1353, 1355 (S.D. Ga. 2016). It was this vague, over-expansive definition of the term
30123833 v1

8

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 11 of 29

words, the capacity of an autodialer is not limited to its current configuration but
also includes its potential functionalities.” Id. at 7974, ¶ 16.
While the FCC’s July 2015 Order is vague and overly expansive, what is
clear is that to qualify as an ATDS, the telephone system must still have the
“capacity” – whether present ability or some “potential functionality” – to “store or
produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number
generator.”

July 2015 Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 7974; 47 U.C.S. § 227(a)(1)

(emphasis added). Here, the evidence is undisputed that Nationstar’s telephone
system does not have the current capacity to store or produce and dial telephone
numbers to be called using a random or sequential number generator. NSOF ¶¶ 52,
130-134. And Plaintiffs have presented no evidence whatsoever that Nationstar’s
telephone system has the “potential functionality” to “store or produce telephone
numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.”
Plaintiff attempts to gloss over this complete lack of evidence of the capacity
of Nationstar’s telephone system to use a random or sequential number generator
by discussing prior FCC orders and citing the testimony of an individual call
representative, Ms. Wimberly.

See Motion at pp. 11-12.

However, Ms.

Wimberly’s testimony does nothing to establish that Nationstar’s telephone

“capacity” set forth in the July 2015 Order that led to numerous appeals, which have all been
consolidated before the D.C. Circuit in ACA International v. Federal Communications
Commission, Case No. 15-1211. See Nationstar’s Motion to Stay [ECF No. 23] at 1.
30123833 v1

9

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 12 of 29

equipment has the requisite capacity to be an ATDS.

Ms. Wimberly simply

explains how she uses the telephone equipment to speak with customers, indicating
that she herself does not initiate the calls. See NSOF ¶ 70. Ms. Wimberly never
states that no human intervention is required, that calls are made using a random or
sequential number generator, or that Nationstar’s system has such capacity. Id.
Instead, the only evidence is that Nationstar’s equipment does require human
intervention and does not have the capacity to make calls using a random or
sequential number generator. See NSOF ¶¶ 52, 70, 130-136.
Further, neither the 2003 nor the 2008 FCC Orders addressed whether an
ATDS must have the “current” versus “future” capacity for random or sequential
number generation. Plaintiffs cite sections of the 2003 and 2008 FCC Orders
[Motion at 9-10], but none of those cited sections explain whether technology that
does not have the current capacity for random or sequential number generation, but
may have some potential capacity to do so through theoretical alterations to the
software and/or hardware, constitutes an ATDS under the TCPA.

More

importantly, neither the 2003 nor 2008 FCC Orders eliminates the requirement that
to be an ATDS, the telephone equipment must still have the “capacity,” however
that term is defined, to “store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a
random or sequential number generator.” 47 U.S.C. § 227(a)(1); In Re Rules &
Regs. Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014

30123833 v1

10

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 13 of 29

(2003); In re Rules & Regs. Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 23
FCC Rcd. 559 (2008). While those rulings discussed telephone equipment that
could fall within the TCPA’s definition, neither eliminated the clear statutory
language that the telephone equipment must still have “capacity,” whether present
or some potential future functionality, to “store or produce telephone numbers to
be called, using a random or sequential number generator.” Id. This is why
clarification was sought from the FCC and why it issued the July 2015 Order.
Because the use of an ATDS “is a threshold issue” to prove a claim under
the TCPA, Rose, 2016 WL 3369283, at *2; Coatney v. Synchrony Bank, 2016 WL
4506315, at *2, and Plaintiffs have not met their burden of setting forth admissible
evidence that Nationstar’s telephone equipment can meet the definition of an
ATDS – as a matter of “current” or “potential capacity,” Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Summary Judgment should be denied.
B.

Alternatively, This Case Should Be Stayed Pending the Outcome
of the D.C. Circuit’s Decision in ACA International Regarding the
Definition of an ATDS.

In the consolidated ACA International appeal from the FCC’s July 2015
Order discussed above, the D.C. Circuit will review and address, among other
things, what equipment constitutes an “automatic telephone dialing system” as that
term is defined by the TCPA. Under the Hobbs Act, a federal court of appeals –
like the D.C. Circuit in ACA International – has the exclusive power to set aside a

30123833 v1

11

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 14 of 29

final FCC order like the July 2015 Order at issue here. See CE Design Ltd. v.
Prism Bus. Media, Inc., 606 F.3d 443, 446 (7th Cir. 2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. §
2342(1); 47 U.S.C. § 402(a)); Murphy v. DCI Biologicals Orlando, LLC, No. 6:12cv-1459, 2013 WL 6865772, at *6-7 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 31, 2013) (citing other cases).
If this Court determines that the July 2015 FCC Order is controlling on the
issue of whether Nationstar’s telephone equipment constitutes an ATDS, then it
should stay this case for the short time it will take for the D.C. Circuit to decide
whether that FCC order has any continuing validity. In assessing whether to stay
this case, the Court should assess “(1) whether a stay will unduly prejudice or
tactically disadvantage the nonmoving party; (2) whether a stay will simplify the
issues and streamline the trial, and (3) whether a stay will reduce the burden of
litigation on the parties and on the court.” See Coatney v. Synchrony Bank, 2016
WL 4506315, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 2, 2016). On October 19, 2016 – over nine
months ago – the D.C. Circuit held oral argument in the ACA International appeal,
and a ruling is expected very soon. That ruling may extinguish or significantly
curtail Plaintiffs’ summary judgment arguments regarding their TCPA claim in this
case. While this Court previously denied a motion to stay this action based on the
outcome of the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, discovery is over now and the only things left
to be done are to decide summary judgment and hold a trial. Because discovery
has concluded, there is no risk of fading memories or lost documents or witnesses.

30123833 v1

12

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 15 of 29

Plaintiffs will suffer no prejudice from a short delay in deciding their summary
judgment motion. On the other hand, deciding Plaintiffs’ summary judgment
motion on the basis of an FCC order that is likely to be overruled by the D.C.
Circuit would be both incredibly inefficient and unfair to Nationstar.
Nationstar therefore asks this Court to reconsider its earlier ruling and stay
its summary judgment decision until the outcome of the D.C. Circuit’s ACA
International decision, just as a legion of other federal courts across the country
already have done.

Plaintiffs’ Claimed TCPA Violations Were Not “Willful or
Knowing.”

Plaintiff claims that Nationstar’s alleged TCPA violations were “willful or
knowing” and therefore can give rise to up to treble damages under the statute. See
47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3). However, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that in order
to be liable for a “willful or knowing” violation of the TCPA, a defendant must
know that it is making calls with an “automatic telephone dialing system” as
defined by the TCPA:
The requirement of “willful[ ] or knowing[ ]” conduct requires the
violator to know he was performing the conduct that violates the
statute. Cf. Alea London Ltd. v. Am. Home Servs., Inc., 638 F.3d 768,
776 (11th Cir.2011) (“The [Act] does not require any intent for
liability except when awarding treble damages.”). For example, to

30123833 v1

14

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 17 of 29

violate section 227(b)(1)(A)(i), a defendant must know that he is
using an “automatic telephone dialing system” to place a “call” . . . .
Lary v. Trinity Physician Fin. & Ins. Servs., 780 F.3d 1101, 1107 (11th Cir. 2015)
(emphasis added).

As discussed in the previous section above, Nationstar’s

telephone equipment does not constitute an ATDS. At the very least, Nationstar
had a good faith belief, based on existing law, that its telephone equipment was not
an ATDS under the TCPA. Therefore, it did not commit a “willful or knowing”
violation under controlling Eleventh Circuit law.
Additionally, it is Nationstar’s policy that calls should stop when a customer
requests not to be called. NSOF at ¶ 122. In accordance with Nationstar’s policy,
when a borrower verbally makes a request that calls cease, Nationstar is supposed
to stop calling. Id. When such a request is made, the Nationstar agent is required
to obtain any necessary information from the borrower and remove the number or
raise the issue to a manager to handle. Id. As Nationstar has policies and practices
in place to stop calling borrowers when such a request is made, any failure to stop
the calls in this particular matter may have been a mistake by the agent, but it was
not a “willful or knowing” violation by Nationstar under the Eleventh Circuit’s
controlling standard. For this additional reason, Plaintiff has not proven that
Nationstar committed any “willful or knowing” violations under the TCPA.

D.

Plaintiffs Provided the Number to Nationstar and Could Not
Unilaterally Revoke Consent to Be Called.

The Welcome Letter sent to Plaintiffs when Nationstar began servicing the
loan contained Nationstar’s contact information and gave the Plaintiffs an
opportunity to update their own phone number and contact information. NSOF at
¶ 126. The second page of the Welcome Letter, directly under the space provided
for Plaintiffs to update their address or phone number, the Welcome Letter states,
“I consent to being contacted by Nationstar Mortgage LLC at any telephone
number I have provided. This includes, but is not limited to, calls from your
dialing system to my cellular or mobile telephone.” Id. On numerous occasions
after this letter was sent, Mr. Heard provided or affirmed his phone number to
Nationstar. See e.g. NSOF at ¶¶ 19, 32, 42 and 49. Having provided his number in
connection with the account, subject to the language in the Welcome Letter,
Plaintiffs could not unilaterally revoke consent to be called. See Reyes v. Lincoln
Automotive Fin. Servs., __ F.3d __, 2017 WL 2675363, at *4 (2d Cir. June 22,
2017) (holding that once contractual consent to receive cell phone calls is given, a
consumer cannot unilaterally revoke that consent under the TCPA).
E.

Plaintiffs’ TCPA Claims Are Also Barred to the Extent they are
Based on Conduct that Took Place Prior to October 14, 2015, the
Effective Date of the Wright Class-Action Settlement.

On August 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois entered a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice in Wright

30123833 v1

16

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 19 of 29

v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC, No. 1:14-cv-10457 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 29, 2016), ECF
No. 135. NSOF at ¶ 148. In Wright, the district court approved a class-action
settlement agreement (NSOF at ¶ 149) applying to “All persons in the United
States for whom Nationstar Mortgage LLC had in its records a cellular telephone
number as of October 14, 2015.” NSOF at ¶ 148 and Ex. 7 thereto at ¶ 12. The
Motion makes clear that Plaintiff is a member of this class. See, e.g., Motion at p.
4 (“Between August 22, 2015 and June 3, 2016, Plaintiffs were called . . . .”).
Plaintiff was a class member of the Wright class action and, under clearly
established law, “a release incorporated into an order approving a class action
settlement bars subsequent litigation based on the released claims.” Tropp v.
Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., 381 F.3d 591, 596 (7th Cir. 2004). See also
Sanders v. LVNV Funding, LLC, No. No. 1:06-cv-570, 2007 WL 854007 (S.D. Ind.
Feb. 26, 2007) (holding that a class member is bound by a settlement agreement
even if he claims that he did not actually receive class notice or wishes, with
hindsight, that he had opted out of the settlement).
Though Plaintiffs could have opted out of the class, they did not. See NSOF
at ¶ 148 and Ex. 7 at p. 12-15 (listing names of individuals who opted out and who
“validly excluded themselves from the Settlement”). Thus, Plaintiffs are bound by
the settlement agreement and the final judgment reached in the Wright case. As a
member of the Wright class and a party to the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs

30123833 v1

17

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 20 of 29

released all of their claims relating to telephone calls in this action through October
14, 2015 pursuant to the settlement. The Settlement Agreement defines “Released
Claims” as
any and all actual, potential, filed, known or unknown, fixed or
contingent, claimed or unclaimed, suspected or unsuspected, claims,
demands, liabilities, rights, causes of action, contracts or agreements,
extracontractual claims, damages, punitive, exemplary or multiplied
damages, expenses, costs, attorneys’ fees and/or obligations
(including “Unknown Claims” as defined below), whether in law or in
equity, accrued or unaccrued, direct, individual or representative, of
every nature and description whatsoever, whether based on the TCPA
or other federal, state, local, statutory, or common law or any other
law, rule or regulation, including the law of any jurisdiction outside
the United States, against the Released Parties, or any of them,
arising out of the facts, transactions, events, matters, occurrences,
acts, disclosures, statements, representations, omissions or failures to
act regarding the alleged making of Telephone Calls including, but
not limited to, any statutory, common law, arbitration or
administrative claim arising from the use of automatic telephone
dialing systems or an artificial or prerecorded voice, including any
claim under or for violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection
Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq., any Federal Communications
Commission regulations or orders implementing or interpreting the
TCPA, federal or state unfair and deceptive practices statutes, federal
or state unlawful debt collection practices statutes (including, but not
limited to, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692, et
seq.), invasion of privacy, conversion, breach of contract, unjust
enrichment, specific performance and/or promissory estoppel, and all
claims that were brought or that could have been brought in the
Action relating to such calls, belonging to any and all Releasing
Parties.
NSOF at ¶ 149 and Ex. 8 thereto at ¶ 1.24.
Under the plain language of this Release, Plaintiffs released not only their
TCPA claims, but also “any and all . . . actual [or] potential . . . causes of action . . .

30123833 v1

18

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 21 of 29

of every nature and description whatsoever, whether based on the TCPA or other
federal, state, local, statutory, or common law or any other law, rule or regulation .
. . against [Nationstar] . . . arising out of . . . the alleged making of Telephone
Calls.” Id. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be
denied to the extent that any of their TCPA claim is based on telephone calls
placed prior to October 14, 2015, the effective date of the Wright settlement.
F.

Genuine Issues of Disputed Material Fact Exist Regarding the
Reasonableness of Nationstar’s Investigation of Plaintiff’s Credit
Dispute, Precluding Summary Judgment on the FCRA Claim.

Plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on their FCRA
claim because they allege Nationstar failed to complete a reasonable investigation
of their consumer dispute.

However, the undisputed facts indicate that

Nationstar’s investigation was both reasonable and complied with the requirements
of the FCRA. Alternatively, the question of the reasonableness of the investigation
has long been a question for the trier of fact, rather than for disposition on
summary judgment, and should be reserved for the jury. Hinkle v. Midland Credit
Mgmt., Inc., 827 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir. 2016) (explaining that the question of
whether an investigation by a furnisher into a dispute is reasonable under the
FCRA is a factual question reserved for trial).
Under the FCRA, a cause of action against a furnisher of credit information
like Nationstar must be brought under 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b). To succeed on a

30123833 v1

19

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 22 of 29

claim under section 1681s-2(b), a plaintiff must establish that he or she disputed
the reporting of an account to a consumer reporting agency (“CRA”) and that the
CRA gave notice of the dispute to the company that furnished the information to
the CRA.

Only then does the furnisher’s obligation to conduct a reasonable

investigation arise. After receiving notice of the dispute from a CRA, the furnisher
must conduct a reasonable investigation of the specific dispute of which it received
notice. Stroud v. Bank of Am., 886 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1313-14 (S.D. Fla. 2012)
(citing Chiang v. Verizon New England Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 2010)). The
obligation imposed on the creditor is not one of strict liability. Id.
Moreover, “what is a reasonable investigation by a furnisher may vary
depending on the circumstances” and “the burden of showing the investigation was
unreasonable is on the plaintiff.” See Chiang, 595 F.3d at 38. “Absent allegations
of fraud, identity theft, or other issues not identifiable from the face of its records,
the furnisher need not do more than verify that the reported information is
consistent with the information in its records.” Krajewski v. Am. Honda Fin.
Corp., 557 F. Supp. 2d 596, 609 (E.D. Pa. 2008); see also Howard v. Pinnacle
Credit Servs., LLC, No. 4:09-cv-85, 2010 WL 2600753, at *3 (M.D. Ga. Jun. 24,
2010) (emphasizing an investigation is reasonable if the furnisher is able to “verify
that the reported information is consistent with the information in its records,” and
that the FCRA does not require a furnisher to do more). As such, “a furnisher

30123833 v1

20

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 23 of 29

‘need not do more than verify that the reported information is consistent with the
information in its records’ for an investigation to be reasonable.”

Taylor v.

Georgia Power Co., No. 2:15-cv-06, 2016 WL 6836935, at *3 (S.D. Ga. Nov. 18,
2016) (quoting Howard, 2010 WL 2600753, at *3). As the court explained in Van
Veen v. Equifax Info., 844 F. Supp. 2d 599, 605 (E.D. Va. 2012):
[Courts] must assess the reasonableness of . . . an information
furnisher’s investigation in light of what it learned about the dispute
from the CRA. . . . A furnisher is not required to uncover and correct
all inaccuracies on the consumer’s credit report. Rather, a furnisher is
required to correct only those inaccuracies it discovers during its
reasonable investigation. Accordingly, a furnisher cannot be held
liable for failing to correct those inaccuracies its reasonable
investigation fails to uncover.
Further, an investigation of consumer dispute is not necessarily unreasonable under
FCRA because it results in a substantive conclusion unfavorable to the consumer,
even if that conclusion turns out to be inaccurate. Gorman v. Wolpoff & Abramson,
LLP, 584 F.3d 1147,1161 1157 (2009); Fair Credit Reporting Act, § 623(b)(1)(A),
15 U.S.C. § 1681s–2(b)(1)(A).
In Westra v. Credit Control of Penellas, 409 F.3d 825 (7th Cir. 2005), the
furnisher had “received an [ACDV] . . . indicating that [plaintiff] was disputing the
charge on the basis that the account did not belong to him.” In response, the
furnisher verified that the plaintiff’s personal identifiers matched those in the
furnisher’s system. Id. The court held that this investigation was sufficient as a
matter of law. Id.
30123833 v1

21

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 24 of 29

(i)

The Reasonableness of An Investigation Required Under
the FCRA is Normally Reserved for Trial.

Courts have traditionally found that summary judgment is not an appropriate
way to determine if an investigation was reasonable or not. See Gorman, 584 F.3d
at 1157 (stating “the jury’s unique competence in applying the ‘reasonable man’
standard is thought ordinarily to preclude summary judgment”). The question of
whether Nationstar conducted a reasonable investigation required under the FCRA
is normally reserved for trial. Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1303; Westra, 409 F.3d at 827.
In Hinkel, the court addressed what might be necessary for a furnisher who is not
the original creditor. Id. The defendant in Hinkel was not the original creditor and,
in conducting its investigation into the dispute, reviewed the information it its
system but did not seek additional information form prior servicers or holders of
the account. Id., at 1305. The Hinkel court did not find that the defendant was not
reasonable in its investigation. Id. Instead, the court stated that a “jury could” find
that the furnishers reliance on its own records did not constitute a reasonable
investigation. Id. As such, the court overturned the grant of summary judgment,
reserving the question of the reasonableness of the investigation for the Jury. Id.
As shown below, a reasonable jury could find that Nationstar reasonably
investigated the disputed information thereby fully complying with the FCRA.

30123833 v1

22

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 25 of 29

(ii)

Nationstar Complied with the FCRA by Conducting a
Reasonable Investigation.

Summary judgment is not appropriate because Nationstar conducted a
reasonable investigation, and at worst, there is a dispute of fact as to the
reasonableness. Plaintiffs contend that Nationstar failed to complete a reasonable
investigation. However, the evidence before the court in this case does not support
that conclusion. To the contrary, the evidence is such that reasonable a jury could
find that Nationstar reasonably investigated the disputes.
The evidence before the Court indicates that Nationstar invested resources in
its team members in responding to Automated Credit Dispute Verification
(“ACDV”) reports from credit reporting agencies. Deposition testimony from
multiple Nationstar employees shows that Nationstar provided content-specific
training to its employees regarding how to handle ACDVs and also periodically
reviewed their performance to ensure proper handling of ACDVs. NSOF at ¶ 137.
Nationstar also dedicated its ACDV-trained staff solely to the task of responding to
ACDVs received from credit reporting agencies. Id. By tasking its employees
only with reviewing ACDVs, Nationstar’s employees can become adept at
properly handling these matters.
Further, it is undisputed that Nationstar’s employees conducted an
investigation into each of the Plaintiffs’ ACDVs received from the CRAs. NSOF
¶¶ 142, 145-47. Shope investigated the ACDV from Transunion and provided a

30123833 v1

23

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 26 of 29

response after verifying the information being reported with Nationstar’s records,
including a pay history. Id. Rotheram investigated the ACDV from Equifax and
responded for Nationstar.

Id.

Kasza reviewed and investigated the ACDV

received from Experian, including the pay history and the note, and then responded
on behalf of Nationstar. Id. These employees testified that they reviewed each
ACDV, going through all the information provided in the dispute and checking it
against Nationstar’s records for the account. NSOF at ¶ 142. Even assuming the
responses from Nationstar to the ACDVs contained inaccurate information, the
content of the responses does not render the investigations unreasonable as a
matter of law. Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1161.
Plaintiffs also assert that the investigation was not reasonable because the
employees reviewing the ACDVs never contacted Nationstar’s escrow department.
However, the information that the CRAs actually provided to Nationstar for review
shape the determination of the reasonableness of the investigation of ACDVs.
Gorman, 584 F.3d at 1157. As evidenced by the deposition testimony of each of
the employees, it is still not clear that any of the ACDVs received included
Plaintiffs’ dispute letter with the alleged proof of insurance, which may have
alerted the employees to take further action, including possibly contacting the
escrow department. NSOF at ¶¶ 97, 143-144. The content, or existence of, any
attachments to the ACDVs remains very much in dispute. Id. Plaintiffs’ evidence

30123833 v1

24

Case 2:16-cv-00694-MHH Document 51 Filed 07/26/17 Page 27 of 29

shows, at most, that they transmitted a letter to the CRAs when initiating their
dispute. They provide no evidence whatsoever that the letter was actually sent to
Nationstar by the CRAs. Moreover, even if the letter was sent, Plaintiffs provide
no evidence that it was in a format that could be seen or read by Nationstar. NSOF
at ¶¶ 97, 144. As part of the investigation of the ACDVs, a defendant is not
required to contact its escrow department or to “do more than verify that the
reported information is consistent with the information in its records.” Krajewski,
557 F. Supp. 2d at 610.
Nationstar’s reasonably investigated each of the ACDVs received from the
CRAs and confirmed the information being reported as consistent with its records.
See Westra, 409 F.3d at 826-27 (holding that the agency conducted a reasonable
investigation when it relied on internal records to verify a disputed debt). Based
on these facts, summary judgment on the FCRA claim is not warranted because
Nationstar’s investigation was reasonable as a matter of law or, at the very least, a
disputed issue of material fact remains for the jury to decide.
V.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Nationstar Mortgage, LLC respectfully
