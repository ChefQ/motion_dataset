INTRODUCTION

2

This case is a contract dispute between a financial advisor, Financial Technology Partners,

3

L.P. ( FT Partners ) and its former client, FNX Limited ( FNX or the Company ). FT Partners

4

asserts that FNX Limited and Farid Naib, as guarantor, breached a Financial Advisory Agreement

5

(the Advisory Agreement ) to pay FT Partners more than $856,000 in fees earned on finance

6
7

transactions, and further contends that FNX has an obligation under the Advisory Agreement to pay
an additional $750,000 upon sale of FNX to another company.

8

ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

9

Whether Plaintiff FT Partners claims against FNX, Ltd. and Farid Naib should be tried to a

10
jury given that (1) FT Partners made a timely demand for a jury trial, (2) the pre-litigation jury trial
11
12
13

waiver is in the Advisory Agreement is governed by California law and (3) such waivers have been
found to be unenforceable under California law.
FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

14

The Advisory Agreement that governs the dispute in this case was signed on or about

15
16

September 12, 2002. The Agreement contains the following clause:
Any right to trial by jury with respect to any action or proceeding arises
in connection with or as a result of either our engagement or any matter
referred to in this letter is hereby waived by the parties hereto. . . . This
letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of California without regard to principles of conflict of
laws.

Dkt. 1 (Notice of Removal, Complaint, Exh. A, p. 6 of 6).

22

25
26

Plaintiff Financial Technology Partners filed its initial Complaint in San Francisco Superior
Court on or about January 30, 2007. Dkt. 2. That Complaint contained a demand for a jury trial in
Paragraph 6 of the Complaint. Id. Defendants removed the case to this Court on or about March 6,
2007. Id. Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint pursuant to stipulation of the
parties, both of which also contained jury demands. Dkt. 29, 30.1

27

A First Amended Complaint was filed in San Francisco Superior Court before removal.

1

Although Defendants initially agreed that the case was triable to a jury in the initial Joint Case

2

Management Statement dated June 22, 2007. Dkt. 22, Defendants later stated their intention to bject

3

to Plaintiff s jury demand based on the pre-litigation jury trial waiver in the contract. See Joint

4

Supplemental Case Management Statement dated November 30, 2007, Dkt. 39. This Court ordered

5

on December 17, 2007, that the parties deal with the dispute over the bench versus jury trial in any

6

dispositive motions that the parties might file. Dkt. 40. The hearing on dispositive motions was to be

7

November 7, 2008. Id. No party filed dispositive motions.

8

Thereafter, the parties engaged in unsuccessful mediation efforts, and then submitted a further

9

joint supplemental case management statement on December 12, 2008. Dkt. 49. In response to the

10

joint supplemental case management statement, this Court issued an order providing the following:
By no later than January 2, 2009, Plaintiff shall file a motion regarding
whether the trial in this matter should be a jury or a bench trial. The
Court shall reset the trial and pretrial conference in the order resolving
the motion. . . .

11
12
13
14

Dkt. 51.

15

Plaintiff admittedly did not file the instant motion by January 2, 2009. Plaintiff has no

16

explanation for its failure other than (1) its counsel had always had the understanding and belief that

17

it would be Defendants burden to challenge Plaintiffs timely jury demand under Federal Rule of

18

Civil Procedure 39(a)(2), or through another procedure, and (2) misread the Court s Order as a result

19

of his understanding and belief. Declaration of Matthew G. Ball Â¶ 3. Counsel for Plaintiff

20

respectfully and humbly requests the Court not to allow his failure to affect this Court s decision on

21

Plaintiff s fundamental constitutional right of jury trial.

22

ARGUMENT

23

There is no dispute that Plaintiff made a timely and adequate jury demand. There is no

24

dispute that the Advisory Agreement provides that California law will govern its interpretation.

25

Under California law, a pre-litigation waiver of a jury trial such as that found in the Advisory

26

Agreement is unenforceable. Grafton Partners L.P. v. Superior Court, 36 Cal. 4th 944 (2005).

27

Accordingly, regardless of the pre-litigation waiver contained in the Advisory Agreement, FT
Partners is entitled to have its claims tried by a jury.

entitled to trial by jury on its claims.
