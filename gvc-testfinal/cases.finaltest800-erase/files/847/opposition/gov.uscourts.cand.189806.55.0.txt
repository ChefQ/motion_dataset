INTRODUCTION

1
2

Plaintiff’s tardy “motion regarding jury trial” attempts to invalidate a jury waiver

3

clause contained in its contract for financial advisory services (“Advisory Agreement”),

4

relying exclusively on California state law. But plaintiff fails to recognize that in

5

diversity cases the right to jury trial is governed by federal law, and federal law enforces

6

contractual waivers of jury trials. Thus, plaintiff is incorrect that the California Supreme

7

Court’s decision in Grafton Partners L.P. v. Superior Court, 36 Cal. 4th 944 (2005) is

8

controlling, or even persuasive authority. Federal law applies even when the dispute

9

arises from a contract containing California choice of law clause. See TransFirst

10

Holdings, Inc. v. Phillips, No. 3:06-CV-2303-P, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20483, at *7-*8

11

(N.D. Tex. Mar. 22, 2007). Under federal law, plaintiff’s waiver of jury trial is

12

enforceable. See id. at *8.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff Financial Technology Partners L.P. ( “FT Partners “) and defendant FNX

15

Limited (“FNX”) executed the Advisory Agreement dated September 23, 2002. The

16

Advisory Agreement was drafted by FT Partners. See Declaration of D. Christopher

17

Burdett in Support of Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion Regarding Jury Trial

18

(“Burdett Decl.”) Ex. A (McLaughlin Dep.) at 22:4-6; 23:2-12. The Advisory Agreement

19

contained the following clause:

20
21
22
23

Any right to trial by jury with respect to any action or proceeding arising in
connection with or as a result of either our engagement or any matter
referred to in this letter is hereby waived by the parties hereto.
See Burdett Decl. Ex. B (Advisory Agreement) at Annex A.
In response to the parties’ joint case management statement, this Court ordered that

24

“By no later than January 2, 2009, Plaintiff shall file a motion regarding whether the trial

25

in this matter should be a jury or a bench trial.” Doc. No. 51 (Order Continuing Dates)

26

at 1. On January 12, 2009 plaintiff filed its motion regarding jury trial, contending that

27

the jury trial waiver contained in the Advisory Agreement was unenforceable under

California law. Plaintiff’s Motion at 2. 1

2
3

ARGUMENT
I.

The California Supreme Court’s decision in Grafton has no bearing on plaintiff’s

4
5

right to a jury trial because federal law controls the right to a jury trial in diversity actions.

6

See Simler v. Conner, 372 U.S. 221, 222 (1963) (“[T]he right to a jury trial in the federal

7

courts is to be determined as a matter of federal law in diversity as well as other actions”);

8

see also Phoenix Leasing Inc. v. Sure Broad., Inc., 843 F. Supp. 1379, 1384 (D. Nev.

9

1994) (federal law governs validity of jury waiver in a diversity case); 8 James Wm.

10

Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 38.14[1] (3d ed. 2008) (“[E]ven when the source

11

of the substantive claim is in state law, federal law will determine the right to jury trial”).

12

The fact that a contract contains a choice of law provision does not alter this analysis. See

13

TransFirst Holdings, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20483, at *7-*8. In Transfirst Holdings, the

14

court rejected the defendants’ contention that California’s Grafton decision should apply

15

because of the contractual California choice of law provisions:

16

Defendants bring forward no authority for the proposition that state
law controls the right to a jury trial in federal court. Defendants argue that
the choice of law clause in the [contracts] should be honored by applying
California law on contractual jury waivers. This contractual choice of law
situation is analogous to a contract case in diversity where the law of a
particular state may govern the interpretation of the contract. In diversity
cases, federal courts have applied federal law to assess the enforceability of
jury waiver provisions. Defendants offer no reason why a case with a state
choice of law provision governing a contract should be distinguished from a
diversity case in deciding whether federal or state law applies to a
contractual jury waiver, and the court perceives no reason to make such a
distinction.

23

Id. at *7-*8 (citations omitted). Plaintiff’s motion does not suggest any reason why long-

24

standing federal authority should be overturned and California law should applied to the

25

right to a jury trial in this Court. 2

II.

FT Partners’ Waiver Of Jury Trial Is Enforceable Under Federal Law.
Under federal law, contractual waivers of jury trials are enforceable. Applied

3

Elastomerics, Inc. v. Z-Man Fishing Prods., Inc., 521 F. Supp. 2d 1031, 1044 (N.D. Cal.

4

2007) (“[U]nder federal law, parties may contractually waive their right to a jury trial”);

5

Okura & Co. (Am.) Inc. v. Careau Group, 783 F. Supp. 482, 488-89 (C.D. Cal. 1991)

6

(enforcing waiver provisions in loan documents). Federal law enforces such waivers

7

when they are entered into knowingly and voluntarily. See Tracinda Corp. v.

8

DaimlerChrysler AG, 502 F.3d 212, 222 (3d Cir. 2007) (“[T]o be valid, a jury waiver

9

must be made knowingly and voluntarily . . .”); Applied Elastomerics, 521 F. Supp. 2d at

10

1044 (“‘[T]he right to civil jury trial . . . may be waived by a contract knowingly and

11

voluntarily executed’”) (quoting Okura, 783 F. Supp. at 488); see also 8 James Wm.

12

Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 38.52[3][a] (3d ed. 2008) (“The parties to a

13

contract may, by prior written agreement, entered into knowingly and voluntarily, waive

14

the right to a jury trial”); 9 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and

15

Procedure § 2321 (3d ed. 2008) (“A contractual provision for waiver of jury trial in the

16

event of a dispute among the contradicting parties will be enforced . . .”).

17

In this case, plaintiff has not made any attempt to argue that the waiver contained

18

in FT Partners’ Advisory Agreement was not knowing or voluntary. Indeed, plaintiff

19

drafted the clause waiving jury trial. Burdett Decl. Ex. A (McLaughlin Dep.) at 22:4-6;

20

23:2-12. Steve McLaughlin, the founder, managing partner, and sole member of plaintiff

21

(id. at 8:23-25) testified that he was familiar with the jury trial waiver that FT Partners

22

included in the majority of its agreements:

24

Q. Let’s take a look at a signed version of the advisory agreement
previously marked as Exhibit 7. I just want to confirm that this is the final
version and the signature by Financial Technology Partners LLC; is that by
you?

1

A Yes.

2

Q -- you see the second to last sentence about the waiver of right to a trial
by jury? Do you see that?

3

A I see that.
4

Q Is that something you discussed with Farid Naib?
5

A I don’t recall.
6
7

Q Okay. Did you even know that that was in there, the waiver of right to
trial by jury?

8

A I -- I don’t recall. Yeah, generally familiar with my agreements.

9

Q And it’s basically in all of your agreements?

10
11

A Not necessarily, but majority probably.
Id. at 112:1-22.

12

FT Partners is not an unsophisticated party. Steve McLaughlin, a graduate of the

13

Wharton School of Business (id. at 17:6-8), testified that he has “negotiated many legal

14

documents, drafted many legal documents, and signed many legal documents that I have

15

drafted or played a large part in drafting . . .”. Id. at 25:23-26:1. In these circumstances,

16

contractual provisions waiving jury trials are enforced. See, e.g., Phoenix Leasing, 843 F.

17

Supp. at 1384-85, 1390 (holding that a waiver of jury trial by defendant was “knowing,

18

intelligent and voluntary” where, inter alia, the waiver clause was not inconspicuous, the

19

defendant had an opportunity to negotiate, and the defendant was “experienced,

20

professional and sophisticated in business dealings”); Brown v. Cushman & Wakefield,

21

Inc., 235 F. Supp. 2d 291, 293-94 & n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (waiver of jury trial was

22

knowing and voluntary because it was conspicuous, and plaintiff who had M.B.A. and had

23

worked as investment banker, was not in an unfair bargaining position and could have

24

tried to negotiate about waiver clause).
