Case 3:09-cv-05077-BHS Document16 Filed 03/27/09 Page 2 of 9

A. Receivership Is Compulsory On These Undisputed Facts.

Silicon & Solar admits that it is insolvent and owes LDK around $5 million worth of
silicon, but still contends that "LDK has not made the factual showing" of "danger of the loss
of rents or profits, of fraud, or a necessity to protect the property from destruction or injury, or
prevent its removal during the pendency of the action." (Opposition to Motion to Appoint
Receiver ("Opp.") at 1:24 and 8:1). Silicon & Solar contends that receivership is available only
where the debtor corporation is a bad actor seeking to evade debts that it has the resources (but
not the intention) to honor. Since Silicon & Solar has the best intentions, but is simply
incapable of delivering the silicon or refunding LDK's payments, it contends receivership
should be denied. (Opp. at 8:7-15.) Silicon & Solar misstates Washington law, which requires
receivership when sought by a creditor of an insolvent corporation.

1. Corporate insolvency alorie compels receivership.

Washington law is absolutely plain: corporate insolvency, in the face of a substantial
claim, mandates receivership:

Whatever the rule may be in other jurisdictions, the rule is
established in this state that a simple contract creditor, whose claim
is not controverted, is entitled to a receivership against a debtor
corporation upon a mere showing of insolvency. In Oleson v.
Bank of Tacoma, 15 Wash. 148, 45 Pac. 734 [1896], the court said:
"Such being the provisions of our statute, it seems too clear for
argument that the court of proper jurisdiction has a right to appoint
a receiver, at the instance of any party interested, whenever it is
made to appear to it that such corporation is insolvent, or has
forfeited its corporate rights. No other conditions are imposed by
the statute, and to import any other would be judicial legislation."

Davis v. Consolidated Coal Co., 41 Wash. 480, 483, 84 P. 22, 23 (1906) (emphasis added).
"T A] creditor has only to establish the fact that he is such, and that the corporation of which he

is such creditor is insolvent, to make it a duty of the proper court to appoint a receiver." New

York Nat. Exchange Bank v. Metropolitan Sav. Bank, 28 Wash. 553, 563, 68 P. 905,
908 (1902) (emphasis added).

The relevant section of the receivership statute remains essentially identical today.' It
is as true today as it was in 1902 that a "mere showing of insolvency" compels the appointment
ofa receiver. Silicon & Solar does not dispute its insolvency. Therefore, LDK is entitled to
the appointment of a receiver.

2. Corporate misconduct is not required by the receivership statute.

Washington courts have explicitly rejected the argument that some sort of misconduct
on the part of the debtor corporation is necessary or even relevant under the receivership
statute. Regardless how honorable the debtor corporation is, "upon a showing that a
corporation is insolvent and possesses assets, the court, under the statute above quoted, upon a
proper application therefor, must appoint a receiver." Kreide v. Independence League of Am.,
188 Wash. 376, 378, 62 P.2d 1101 (1936) (emphasis added). The Kreide "[r]espondent
argue[d] that it [was] a charitable, nonprofit corporation, organized pursuant to Rem. Stat. 0x00A70x00A7
3872, 3873, and that for this reason its affairs should not be placed in the hands of a receiver."
Id. at 378. The Washington Supreme Court rejected that argument and held that the
corporation's noble purpose was simply irrelevant. "It clearly appearing from the record that

appellants have an unsatisfied judgment against respondent, and that respondent is insolvent

 

' A century ago, the receivership statute provided, "'A receiver may be appointed by
the court in the following cases: .. . (5) When a corporation has been dissolved or is insolvent,
or is in imminent danger of insolvency, or has forfeited its corporate rights." New York Nat.
Exchange Bank v. Metropolitan Sav. Bank, 28 Wash. 553, 562, 68 P. 905, 908 (1902).

Today's statute provides, "A receiver may be appointed .. . (i) In an action against any
person who is not an individual if the object of the action is the dissolution of that person, or if
that person has been dissolved, or if that person is insolvent or is not generally paying the
person's debts as those debts become due unless they are the subject of bona fide dispute, or if
that person is in imminent danger of insolvency." RCW 7.60.025(1)(i).

and owns property which apparently is subject to the claims of its creditors, including
appellants, the trial court erred in refusing to appoint a receiver for respondent upon appellants'
demand." Id. at 380 (emphasis added). Whether the insolvent corporation was run by saints
was beside the point. Likewise, in Warren v. Porter Const. Co., 29 Wn.2d 785, 786-87, 189
P.2d 255 (1948), the Washington Supreme Court held that a substantial claim (in excess of
$15,000) against an insolvent corporation (that had only about $1,000 in its bank account)
"demanded" the appointment of a receiver; there was no need to determine whether the debtor
corporations had mingled assets and failed to observe corporate formalities.

Silicon & Solar's protests of good intentions are irrelevant. What is relevant is the
corporation's candid admission that "Silicon & Solar LLC is unable to refund the money
advanced by LDK because it has been spent in the regular course of business." Duvall Decl.
q 14." (Opp. at 5:12-13.) This undisputed insolvency compels the appointment of a receiver.

3. Silicon & Solar misrepresents Washington precedent.

Silicon & Solar cites Union Boom Co. v. Samish River Boom Co., 33 Wash. 144, 75
P.53 (1903), for the proposition that in addition to corporate insolvency, the creditor must also
show "danger of the loss of rents or profits, of fraud, or a necessity to protect the property from
destruction or injury, or prevent its removal during the pendency of the action." (Opp. at 8:1).
Silicon & Solar misrepresents the law. The Union Boom court was construing a completely
different section of the receivership statute than the corporate insolvency provision applicable
here.

In Union Boom, the plaintiff, Samish River Boom Co., alleged that it had bought from
the state the land on which Union Boom Co. was doing business; Samish River claimed it was
entitled to take possession of that land and to recover all the profits that Union Boom had

earned in using it since the date of sale. Id. at 146-47. Samish River sought the appointment of

a receiver during the pendency of the action that would determine whether Samish River was
entitled to the relief it sought. Id. at 147. The basis of Samish River's claim for a receivership
was not that Union Boom was insolvent. Rather, Samish River pleaded (but did not show), "if
[Union Boom] continues in the possession of said property during the pendency of this action,
[Samish River] will be still further damaged, and said damages will be entirely irreparable, as
[Samish River] will have no way of recovering the same.'" Id. at 149.

The section of the receivership statute at issue in Union Boom corresponds to RCW
7.60.025(1)(b)(i), permitting a provisional receivership "during the pendency of any action to
foreclose upon any lien against or for forfeiture of any interest in real or personal property"
where "[t]he property or its revenue-producing potential is in danger of being lost or materially
injured or impaired." Under that provision, the movant must show "that the property, fund, or
rents and profits in controversy are in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured, or
when, in the discretion of the court, it may be necessary to secure ample justice to the parties."
Union Boom at 151.

That section of the statute is not at issue here, and Union Boom is irrelevant to LDK's
claim. As we have seen, Washington courts uniformly hold that under RCW 7.60.025(1)(i),
corporate insolvency in the face of a substantial claim "demands" receivership. "No other
conditions are imposed by the statute and to import any other would be judicial legislation."
B. Silicon & Solar Will Continue Operations In Receivership.

Silicon & Solar points out that, though insolvent, it continues to do business, citing a
new purchase order from LDK (which, upon review, turns out not to be an entirely "new"
purchase order, but rather to provide for credit against the debt Silicon & Solar owes LDK.
(Duvall Dec. Ex. E)) Silicon & Solar seems to imply such ongoing commercial activity bars

receivership, as though receivership were available only against defunct corporations. But this

Case 3:09-cv-05077-BHS Document16 Filed 03/27/09 Page 6 of 9

is not the case: an insolvent corporation in receivership can continue to do business. That is
why a general receiver has the power "to do all things which the owner of the business or
property might do in the ordinary course of the operation of the business as a going concern."
RCW 7.60.060; cf. RCW 7.60.130.

The key to the analysis is not whether Silicon & Solar continues to engage in
commercial activity, but rather, whether it is unable "to meet its obligations in the ordinary
course of business." Warren v. Porter Const. Co., 29 Wn.2d 785, 786, 189 P.2d 255, 256
(1948). Silicon & Solar concedes it meets this definition of insolvency, a concession that
compels the appointment of a receiver. It will be in the interests of both parties if Silicon &
Solar continues to deliver silicon while in receivership, and the statute permits that result.

C. Receivership Is Available Even If The Creditor Cannot Be Made Whole.

Silicon & Solar contends that it has never been profitable, and that problems with the
global economy and the quality of the product delivered by its sub-suppliers have "led to cash
flow problems." (Opp. at 2:15-19.) Silicon & Solar states, "there are no assets to `dissipate'
and there is no product sitting around just waiting to be shipped. Available silicon has already
been shipped to LDK." (Id. at 8:12-13.) Silicon & Solar implies the Court should deny LDK's
motion as futile.

Silicon & Solar's argument that corporate poverty should defeat a motion to appoint a
receiver misapprehends Washington law. The receivership statute does not require that the
creditor seeking the appointment of a receiver demonstrate that the debtor have assets sufficient
to satisfy the creditor's claims; indeed, such a requirement would be nonsensical in the face of
the provision for the appointment of a receiver for an insolvent corporation. RCW
7.60.025(1)(i). LDK need show only that there are some assets for the receiver to take control

of. Kreide at 380. Silicon & Solar admits that it has some assets: it recently "shipped an

additional 3,700 kilograms of silicon wafers to LDK in Hong Kong," (Opp. at 4:9), and it
anticipates shipping another 1,000 kilograms to LDK in the near future, (id. at 5:10), although
these shipments fall short of satisfying Silicon & Solar's obligations to LDK.. Silicon & Solar
thus admits that LDK has a substantial claim against an insolvent corporation that has some
assets that a receiver can assume control over. These undisputed facts compel receivership.

D. LDK Provided Adequate Notice.

Silicon & Solar complains that at a February meeting, "LDK did not mention that it had
filed the lawsuit against Silicon & Solar that very day"; "LDK chose not to notify Silicon &
Solar or Duvall of the existence of the pending lawsuit until nearly a month after it had been
filed." (Id. at 3:11-14; 4:18-22.) The legal relevance of these facts remains obscure, since
Silicon & Solar does not contend LDK violated any Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; or that
Silicon & Solar would like to move for a continuance; or that the receivership statute requires a
creditor provide informal notice of the possibility of litigation prior to filing suit. |

Silicon & Solar seems to complain, "It was not very nice of you to sue us all of a
sudden like that." Unfortunately for everyone, a receiver is necessary here. Receivership is not
a punishment nor a commentary on the character of Silicon & Solar's management, but simply
the remedy compelled by the undisputed facts. Receivership ensures that a disinterested third
party review Silicon & Solar's assets, review its outstanding liabilities, and, as the Court's
agent and accountable to the Court's oversight, act so far as possible under the circumstances to

address claims of creditors against this admittedly insolvent corporation.
