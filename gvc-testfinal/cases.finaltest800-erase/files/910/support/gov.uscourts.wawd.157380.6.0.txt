deliver. Appointment of a general receiver is necessary order to protect LDK and potentially

other claimants.
I. FACTS

LDK is a Chinese company that designs and manufactures multi-crystalline solar
wafers, the principal component used to make solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity.
(Declaration of Zhou Min { 2.) Silicon & Solar is Washington company that has served as
LDK's supplie of IC grade silicon, a necessary component of solar wafers. (Id. 0x00A7 4.) LDK and
Silicon & Solar have done business since 2005. (Id.) LDK always paid for the silicon in
advance of delivery. (Id. cent 5.)

In late 2008, Silicon & Solar ceased making scheduled deliveries of silicon to LDK.
(Id. 6.) LDK has made payments of $5,749,371.23 for IC grade silicon that Silicon & Solar
has never delivered. (Id. | 7.) In January, 2009, Silicon & Solar apologetically informed LDK
that Silicon &)Solar had ceased operations and closed its doors. (Id. { 8.) Silicon & Solar has
refused to deliver the $5,749,371.23 worth of IC grade silicon pursuant to the contracts or
return the money, despite demand. (Id. {| 9.) |

On February 7, 2009, Silicon & Solar informed LDK that Silicon & Solar had lost most
of LDK's $5,749,371.23 in failed transactions with its sub-suppliers. (Declaration of Ken
Leava { 2.) In one case, silicon was delivered but it did not meet LDK's specifications
(meaning there should be something to resell). (Id.) In another case, the silicon was not
delivered at all. In a third case, the sub-supplier closed down. (Id.) At least some of the sub-
suppliers are i the U.S. (Id.) Others may be in Germany and Japan. (Id.)

In response, LDK proposed an immediate meeting to choreograph pursuit of Silicon &
Solar's sub-suppliers. (Declaration of James D. Nelson { 2 and Ex. A.) Silicon & Solar finally
responded almost two weeks later on February 25, 2009. (Id. 3 and Ex. B.) Silicon & Solar

expressed some willingness to make financial records available to LDK. (Id.) Silicon & Solar,
however, refused to make its management available to assist LDK. (Id.)
Il. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY

A. Appointment of a General Receiver Is Warranted.

Fed. R: Civ. P. 66 and LR 66 provide for the appointment of receivers. Washington law
also provides a remedy for persons in LDK's predicament: appointment of a receiver, who is "a
person appointed by the court as the court's agent, and subject to the court's direction, to take
possession of, manage, or dispose of property of a person." RCW 7.60.005(10). Receivership
is appropriate where, as here, undisputed claims are made against an insolvent corporation:

i [A] receiver shall be appointed only if the court additionally
| determines that the appointment of a receiver is reasonably
inecessary and that other available remedies either are not
:available or are inadequate:

(i) In an action against any person who is not an individual .. . if
that person is insolvent or is not generally paying the person's
debts as those debts become due unless they are the subject of
bona fide dispute, or if that person is in imminent danger of
insolvency.

RCW 7.60.025. "The test of the solvency of a corporation is its ability to meet its obligations
in the ordinary course of business" Warren v. Porter Const. Co., 29 Wn.2d 785, 786, 189 P.2d
255, 256 (1948). 7

Silicon & Solar, which has admitted that it can neither deliver the silicon nor reimburse
LDK the money it has paid for the silicon, and which states that it is no longer in business,

concedes that it cannot meet its obligations in the daily course of business and is an insolvent

corporation for the purpose of Washington's receivership law. Appointment of a receiver to

marshal the assets of Silicon & Solar and LDK's claim against those assets is clearly warranted.

Further, where the corporation is completely defunct, as Silicon & Solar appears to be,

it is appropriate to appoint a general receiver, with authority to marshal all its assets, manage its

daily business; and handle all claims; if Silicon & Solar can prove that the general receivership

should be converted to a more limited, custodial receivership, the Court can convert it. RCW

7.60.015.

B. Thomas M. Keller Would Is Uniquely Qualified to Serve as Receiver in this Case.

Thomas M. Keller is uniquely qualified to serve as receiver in this case because he has

Iv. CONCLUSION
Silicon & Solar admits it has gone out of business and cannot meet its obligation to
LDK. Siliconj& Solar owes LDK more than $5 million worth of goods it makes no
representation;that it will ever be able to deliver. The Court should promptly appoint a receiver

to protect the assets of Silicon & Solar from dispersal and protect LDK's interest in those
i
assets. Thomas M. Keller is uniquely qualified to serve as receiver in this case. A proposed

order is attached.
