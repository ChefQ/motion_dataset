DEFENDANT R. ALLEN STANFORD'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF EXPEDITED MOTION TO PERMIT NEW
ATTORNEYS TO APPEAR FOR LIMITED PURPOSE

Defendant R. Allen Stanford seeks an Order from this Court permitting Patton
Boggs LLP ("Patton Boggs") and Sydow & McDonald, LLP ("Sydow & McDonald")
(Patton Boggs and Sydow & McDonald are collectively referred to herein as "the
Firms"), to appear for the limited purpose of resolving whether Mr. Stanford will be
granted access to monies to pay for his legal fees and expenses. Mr. Stanford submits
that there is good cause to grant this Motion, as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

On February 17, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")

sought an order from the United States District Court for the Northern District of

Texas to seize and freeze the assets of Defendant R. Allen Stanford and his business

of more than a decade, the Stanford Group Companies. See Securities and Exchange
1
Case 4:09-cr-00342 Document 89 _ Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 4 of 10

Commission v. Stanford Int'l Bank, Ltd., Case No. 3:09-cv-0298-N. The SEC succeeded
in its efforts to obtain such an order essentially by default because Mr. Stanford
asserted his Fifth Amendment rights. Those assets, as well as Mr. Stanford's records,
clothing and personal possessions, are now in the control of a Receiver. Mr. Stanford,
therefore, is not able to access those funds or other assets to pay for attorneys to
represent him in this case or otherwise effectively defend himself.

Moreover, although Mr. Stanford is an intended beneficiary of his companies'
various insurance policies, to include a Directors & Officers Liability insurance policy,
he has been denied the benefits to those policies because the Receiver has made the
erroneous claim that all insurance policy proceeds, including those contractually
obligated to cover Mr. Stanford's defense costs on an as-incurred basis, belong to the
Receivership Estate. This issue ts currently being litigated in the SEC civil proceeding
by Patton Boggs and Sydow & McDonald, who Mr. Stanford retained to represent
him in that action.

Although Mr. Stanford had been represented by Dick DeGuerin of DeGuerin
& Dickson in the criminal proceeding, Mr. DeGuerin filed a motion to withdraw as
counsel on July 31, 2009.

Mr. Stanford therefore now seeks an order from this Court permitting Patton
Boggs and Sydow & McDonald to make a limited appearance in this case to resolve
the issue of whether Mr. Stanford will be able to pay attorneys in this criminal action.

Mr. Stanford and the Firms have agreed that, if the Firms are successful in obtaining
2
Case 4:09-cr-00342 Document 89 _~ Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 5 of 10

those assurances from the Court, Patton Boggs and Sydow & McDonald will make a
full appearance on Mr. Stanford's behalf in this case.
Il. ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY

A. Mr. Stanford Has Agreed To Permit the Firms to Make a Limited
Appearance.

Defendant R. Allen Stanford retained the Firms to make a limited appearance
as attorneys of record in this case. Specifically, Mr. Stanford has retained Patton
Boggs for purposes of seeking an order from this Court: (i) allowing Mr. Stanford's
lawyers to be paid for their services on Mr. Stanford's behalf in this case; and, (i)
providing that any funds, including, without limitation, insurance policy proceeds,
designated to pay the legal fees and costs for representing Mr. Stanford in this case
will not be frozen or otherwise forfeited. Mr. Stanford retained Sydow & McDonald
to serve as local counsel given that Patton Boggs has an office only in Dallas, Texas.
In support of that endeavor, the Firms will seek permission to file a supplemental
brief in reply to the government's opposition to the Stanford's Expedited Motion for
An Order Directing The United States to Release Funds or to Dismiss the

Indictment, attached hereto as Exhibit A, and may move for additional relief?

 

' Mr. Stanford further requested, and the Firms agreed, to take over the appeal
pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

* Counsel for Patton Boggs conferred with Assistant United States Attorney Gregg
Costa on August 3, 2009 and August 4, 2009, regarding filing a supplemental reply
brief and an extension of time to do so, which Mr. Costa consented to if the Court
granted the motion to make a lumited appearance.

3
Case 4:09-cr-00342 Document 89 _ Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 6 of 10

The Firms and Mr. Stanford have further agreed that Patton Boggs' appearance
in this case is contingent on obtaining a court order allowing the Firm to enter a
limited appearance as described above. Therefore, if the Court does not consent to
the terms described above, the Firms and Mr. Stanford have agreed that Patton Boggs
shall not otherwise enter an appearance in this case.' Mr. Stanford and Patton Boggs
have agreed, however, that if the Firms are successful in obtaining such a court order,
and the issue of the attorneys' fees and expenses is resolved in Mr. Stanford's favor,
Patton Boggs will make a full appearance on Mr. Stanford's behalf in this case.

B. Texas Practice and Case Law Permits Attorneys to Make Limited
Appearances and to Withdraw Thereafter.

Federal courts in Texas, including in the SEC's civil case against Mr. Stanford,
routinely permit attorneys to make limited appearances to litigate a variety of issues,
after which these attorneys are permitted to withdraw as counsel of record. See e.g,
Ex. B (March 2, 2009 Hearing Trans.), at 9-10, from Securities and Exchange Commission
". Stanford Int'l Bank, Ltd, Case No. 3:09-cv-0298-N (permitting attorney to make
limited appearance on Mr. Stanford's behalf for purposes of asking for a continuance
of a temporary restraining order motion; attorney subsequently withdrew); see also, e.g.,

Krivan v. Dallas County, No. 3-99-CV-1560-D, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20614, at *3 n.2

 

> 'The Firms submit that they have appeared solely in the above-captioned criminal
case for the limited purpose of seeking the relief described in this Motion. Mr.
Stanford and the Firms have agreed that the Firms will withdraw and not continue to
represent Mr. Stanford in this case if they are unable to obtain an order from this
Court as described above.
Case 4:09-cr-00342 Document 89 _ Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 7 of 10

(N.D. Tex. Dec. 12, 2001) (noting that attomey made a limited appearance on
criminal defendant's behalf, and then withdrew); see aso, Texas Disciplinary Rules of
Professional Conduct Rule 1.02(b) ("[a] lawyer may limit the scope, objectives and
general methods of the representation if the client consents after consultation") and
cmt. 4 ("The scope of representation provided by a lawyer may be limited by
agreement with the client or by the terms under which the lawyer's services are made
available to the client.").*

Mr. Stanford acknowledges that he has reasonable notice, by virtue of the
agreement he executed with Patton Boggs, that the Firms have been retained for a
limited purpose here pending resolution of the fees issue. Mr. Stanford accordingly
submits that good cause exists to permit Patton Boggs and Sydow & McDonald to

make a limited appearance in this case for the reasons described above.

 

* See also, Great Western Coal, Inc. v. Brown, 146 B.R. 702, 704 (Bankr. $.D. Tex. 1992)
("The Attorney General for the State of South Carolina made a limited appearance to
prosecute her motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment grounds. Santee Cooper
also made a limited appearance through counsel to raise the same Eleventh
Amendment immunity defense."); Houston Chapter of Int'l Ass'n of Black Professional
Firefighters v. Houston, Civil Action No. H-86-3553, 1991 US. Dist. LEXIS 13391, at *3
(S.D. Tex. May 3, 1991) (Lake, J.) (permitting attomey "to enter a limited appearance
for plaintiffs, for the purpose of investigating the merits of the claims raised and for
the purpose of assisting in their resolution"); Eastern Texas R. Co. v. Railroad Com., 242
F, 300, 305 (W.D. Tex. 1917) (permitting attorneys to make limited appearance to
contest jurisdiction).

CONCLUSION

Wherefore, in consideration of Texas law and the representation agreement

between Mr. Stanford and the Firms, Mr. Stanford respectfully requests the Court

grant the instant motion.
