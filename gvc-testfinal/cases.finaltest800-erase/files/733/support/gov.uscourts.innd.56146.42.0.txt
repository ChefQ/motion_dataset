HEARTLAND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES, LLC'S MOTION TO
DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT
MATTER JURISDICTION IN LIGHT OF COVENANT NOT TO SUE
Pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Heartland Recreational
Vehicles, LLC ("Heartland") respectfully moves to dismiss Forest River, Inc.'s ("Forest River")
counterclaims alleging invalidity, non-infringement, and unenforceability. Such claims are moot
in light of Heartland's covenant not to sue Forest River for infringement of U.S. Patent No.
7,278,650 ("the '650 Patent"). The Covenant Not To Sue is filed contemporaneously herewith.
The grounds for Heartland's motion are set forth more fully in the accompanying
Memorandum in Support of Heartland Recreational Vehicles, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Certain
Claims for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Light of Covenant Not to Sue.
WHEREFORE, Heartland respectfully requests that this court dismiss, without prejudice,
Forest River, Inc.'s counterclaims involving validity, infringement, and enforceability.
