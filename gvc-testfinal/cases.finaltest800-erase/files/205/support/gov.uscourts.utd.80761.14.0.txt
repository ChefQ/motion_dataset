MOTION TO EXTEND FILING
DEADLINE

Case No. 2:llev00558-CW-SA

Judge Clark Waddoups
Magistrate Judge Samuel Alba

 

The Plaintiff hereby move(s) the Court for an Order extending the time to file
Memorandum Supporting Objection to Defendants Motion to Dismiss for the following

reasons:

1. Plaintiff has been very ill and was eventually hospitalized on July 5, 2011 for a
colonoscopy.

2. During the colonoscopy, the doctor removed cancerous polyps.

3. Plaintiff also broke her foot and has been on pain medication since June 24, 2011.
Case 2:11-cv-00558-CW -SA Document 14 _ Filed 07/08/11 Page 2 of 3

4, Plaintiff saw a foot and ankle specialist on July 1, 2011 who put her in an air cast
and advised her to rest as much as possible.
5. Plaintiff is a stay at home mother and her 3-year-old daughter contracted a very

bad virus sometime between June 16, 2011 and when Plaintiff took daughter to
pediatrician on July 5, 2011.

6. Daughter was and still is very ill with throat polyps and diarrhea and was
considered highly contagious so Plaintiff could not send daughter to a babysitter
or day care.

7. Hence, Plaintiff had no time to prepare a Memorandum supporting her Objection
to Defendants Motion to Dismiss.

8. Furthermore, Plaintiff is planning to address Defendants concerns noted in their

Motion to Dismiss by enumerating Plaintiffs causes of action and adding a
modicum of facts to prove elements of each cause of action.

9, In the interest of fairness and justice, Plaintiff requests an extension of 30
calendar days, deadline to be extended to August 14, 2011, to respond to Motion

to Dismiss.
