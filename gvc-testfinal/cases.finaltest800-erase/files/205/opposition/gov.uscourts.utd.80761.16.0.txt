MEMORANDUM OPPOSING MOTION TO
EXTEND FILING DEADLINE [DKT 14]

JESSE ANNE MAJORS,
Plaintiff,
v.

Case No.: 2:11cv00558 CW

THOMAS JEFFERSON SCHOOL OF LAW,
et al,
Defendants,

Plaintiff has moved the court for an order extending the time for her to respond to
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, Docket No. 3. The docket shows that on June 29, 2011 Plaintiff
filed her Objection to Motion to Dismiss, Docket no. 9. DUCivR 7-1(b)(3) specifically addresses
this situation. It allows for a motion and moving memorandum, an opposing memorandum, which is
what Plaintiff’s Objection (Docket No. 9) was. The rule specifically provides “no other memoranda
will be allowed without leave of court.” Plaintiff’s objection, brief as it was, was her opposing

memorandum. She is not entitled to supplement it further.
Plaintiff included in her extension motion a recitation of reasons she could not answer
timely. The Motion to Dismiss was filed on June 16, 2011. Plaintiff responded with her objection on
June 29, 2011, failing to take advantage of the 28 days allowed for her response under DUCivR 71(4). While the Plaintiff’s reasons may well have constituted “good cause” under Rule 6(b)(1)(A)
Fed. R. Civ. P. had she requested an extension prior to the running of the 28 days allowed by
DUCivR 7-1(4) once she responded the issue of good cause was moot.
Given the pleading standards currently in force flowing from the Supreme Court’s Twombly
and Iqbal opinions the extension Plaintiff seeks would be futile given the state of Plaintiff’s
Amended Complaint. The court should deny the extension motion and set the Motion to Dismiss for
hearing.
DATED this 8th day of July, 2011.
