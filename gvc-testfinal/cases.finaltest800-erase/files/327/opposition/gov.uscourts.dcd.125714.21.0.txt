Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00963 (RMU)

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS CLAIMS
ONE THROUGH FOUR OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT
The Department of Education (“Education”) repeatedly attempts to recast the version of
events surrounding Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington’s (“CREW”)
Complaint under the Federal Records Act (“FRA”) and the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”). Education employees twice told CREW’s counsel that they sometimes use private
email addresses to conduct official business and that this issue had arisen in the past in the
context of other FOIA requests. See Declaration of Dan Roth, CREW Counsel (“Roth Decl.”) at
¶ 9 (attached as Exhibit 1). CREW brought this lawsuit under the FRA after it was denied access
to agency records that were created by agency employees using outside email accounts.

Before CREW filed its original Complaint against Education based on the agency’s
violation of the FRA, CREW sent a letter to the Secretary of Education (“Secretary”), the
National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”) and the Archivist to put them on
notice of Education’s FRA violations. Once it was clear to CREW that none of these parties was
investigating or resolving Education’s violations of the FRA, CREW amended its Complaint to
add these additional parties.
In addition, after exhausting all of its administrative remedies under the FOIA, CREW
amended its Complaint to include allegations under the FOIA, based on Education’s failure to
respond fully to CREW’s FOIA request and failure to grant CREW its request for a fee waiver.
CREW filed its original FOIA request in March 2007. Next, at the suggestion of Education,
CREW participated in a conference call with employees of Education in May 2007, to discuss
narrowing its request. Finally, in May 2007, CREW sent another FOIA request narrowing the
items requested under its original March 28th FOIA. Despite CREW’s repeated attempts to
narrow its FOIA request and despite the fact that it met the requirements under FOIA for a fee
waiver, Education has continued to withhold documents responsive to CREW’s FOIA and has
denied CREW a fee waiver.
Defendants have now moved to dismiss claims one through four of CREW’s Amended
Complaint, which includes the additional FRA counts against the Secretary, Archivist and
NARA, arguing that plaintiff lacks standing to sue and the claims are not ripe for adjudication.
Defendants also argue that CREW’s claim under the FOIA, based on Education’s failure to
provide CREW the documents it requested, must be dismissed because it is not ripe for
adjudication and fails to state a claim.

Contrary to defendants’ claims, CREW has been injured by the actions of Education in a
manner recognized by the Court and therefore has standing under the FRA. Moreover, CREW is
entitled to the records and fee waiver it requested in accordance with the FOIA - - which
requires that agency records be made available upon a request that reasonably describes such
records. Here, there is no doubt that CREW has submitted a FOIA request that reasonably
describes the information being sought, and has also satisfied the elements required for a fee
waiver. Under these circumstances defendants’ motion to dismiss must be denied.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On March 28, 2007, CREW sent a FOIA request to Education seeking records, regardless
of format and including electronic records and information, of communications and other
contacts concerning the Reading First program. Amended Complaint, ¶ 30 and Exhibit A to
Roth Decl., ¶ 2.
On April 16, 2007, Education sent CREW a letter acknowledging CREW’s FOIA
request, enclosing a CD containing 421 pages of documents in response to item 4 of the FOIA
request, seeking clarification for items 1 through 3 of the FOIA and denying CREW’s fee waiver
request. Amended Complaint, ¶ 31 and Exhibit B to Roth Decl., ¶ 4.
In its letter denying CREW’s fee waiver request, Education stated that CREW failed to
show both that disclosure of the documents to CREW would contribute to the understanding of
the public at large, because the public would be required to do its own analysis of the requested
documents to reach any possible understanding of the information; and that CREW failed to
show that the disclosure would contribute significantly to the public’s understanding of
government operations, because certain information already existed in the public domain on

Reading First. Exhibit B to Roth Decl., ¶ 4.
On May 9, 2007, CREW’s counsel participated in a conference call with Education about
CREW’s FOIA request. Amended Complaint, ¶ 32 and Exhibit C to Roth Decl., ¶ 8.
Education officials -- who included representatives from the agency’s FOIA office, its Office of
the General Counsel and its Office of Elementary and Secondary Education -- advised CREW
that the agency could not search for email pertaining to any particular subject matter without
having the identity of a specific recipient or sender. Id.
In addition, a Department official advised CREW that Education personnel “often use
private email addresses” and that Education “wouldn’t have access to that.” Id. Education
officials confirmed that agency personnel use private email accounts for official business and
that this issue had arisen in the past in the context of other FOIA requests. Id.
On May 11, 2007, CREW sent an email to Education appealing its denial of CREW’s fee
waiver request. Amended Complaint, ¶ 33 and Exhibit D to Roth Decl., ¶ 14.
CREW’s appeal explained that CREW’s request would contribute significantly to the public’s
understanding of the issues involved because there were significant inconsistencies in the public
record as to the involvement of Secretary Spellings in the administration of the Reading First
program prior to her becoming Secretary of Education. Id. The records CREW was seeking
would clarify the public record. Id.
CREW’s letter further discussed Education’s denial of CREW’s fee waiver based on
whether the information CREW was seeking would add to the public’s understanding of the
administration of the Reading First program because the public would be required to do its own
analysis of the requested documents. Id. CREW explained that its FOIA request stated that

4

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 5 of 21

CREW would analyze the information responsive to its request, and would likely share its
analysis with the public, either through memoranda, reports or press releases. Amended
Complaint, ¶ 33 and Exhibit D to Roth Decl., ¶ 14.
In a follow-up telephone call on May 14, 2007, an Education FOIA officer confirmed to
CREW’s counsel that Education employees sometimes use private email addresses to conduct
official business, that such material would not be included in the agency’s response to CREW’s
FOIA request and that this issue had come up in the past. Amended Complaint, ¶ 34 and Roth
Decl., ¶ 15.
In light of this information, CREW sent a letter to Education’s Inspector General dated
May 15, 2007, requesting that he commence an immediate investigation “to assess the extent and
duration” of Education’s practice of using outside email accounts to conduct official business,
“the amount of official correspondence that has been lost or destroyed, and the effect of this
practice on all records requests to the Department of Education.” Amended Complaint, ¶ 35 and
Exhibit C to Roth Decl., ¶ 17.
CREW’s May 15 letter also pointed out that in addition to CREW’s FOIA request,
reporters have also been requesting agency documents under the FOIA, as has Rep. George
Miller, Chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. Amended Complaint, ¶ 36.
On May 21, 2007, CREW sent an email to Education narrowing its FOIA request in order
to aid Education in its search for records responsive to the request. Amended Complaint, ¶ 37
and Exhibit E to Roth Decl., ¶ 18-21. The narrowed FOIA request revised the scope of Item 1
from the entire Department to a list of 14 of the 33 offices listed on Education’s online
Coordinating Structure Chart. Id.

5

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 6 of 21

In addition, request Item 1 sought records mentioning or relating to several enumerated
reading programs and terms and “any other issue related to reading instruction or education.” Id.
In response to concerns raised by Education officials during the May 9, 2007 conference call,
CREW narrowed this item further by deleting that phrase and replacing it with records related to
“Early Reading First” and “Science-Based Reading Research.” Id.
Finally, CREW narrowed Items 2 and 3 of CREW’s FOIA request from contacts with
and regarding all educational publishers to an enumerated list of seven publishers. Id.
On May 23, 2007, CREW sent a letter to Secretary Spellings advising her that it had filed
a lawsuit against the Department of Education challenging the failure of the agency to preserve
copies of electronic records of official Education business created by agency employees through
the use of non-governmental email accounts. Amended Complaint, ¶ 38. CREW further
requested that Secretary Spellings, with the assistance of the Archivist, initiate action to prevent
the further removal or destruction of the electronic records. Id.
On June 8, 2007, Education sent CREW a letter responding to CREW’s May 11, 2007
email appealing Education’s initial denial of CREW’s request for a fee waiver. Amended
Complaint, ¶ 40 and Exhibit F to Roth Decl., ¶ 23. In its letter, Education affirmed its denial of
CREW’s request for a fee waiver. Id. Specifically, Education stated that its fee waiver denial
was based on its conclusion that many of the records responsive to CREW’s request had nothing
to do with the Reading First program, and disclosure of those materials would not enhance
public understanding of Education’s administration of the program. Id.
Education’s June 8, 2007 fee waiver denial also based its decision on its finding that
CREW failed to identify and provide examples of the significant inconsistencies in the public

6

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Page 7 of 21

record with respect to Secretary Spellings’ involvement in Reading First prior to her tenure as
Secretary. Id.
On June 21, 2007, CREW sent Education another letter appealing Education’s denial of
CREW’s fee waiver request. Amended Complaint, ¶ 41, Exhibit G to Roth Decl. ¶ 23.
CREW’s letter outlined all of the previous communications between it and Education, including
CREW’s narrowing of its FOIA request. The letter also discussed, in detail, how CREW
satisfied the two-prong statutory test for a fee waiver. Id.
First, CREW reiterated to Education that it had narrowed its request and now sought a
smaller category of documents that specifically related to the Reading First Program. Id.
Second, and in response to Education’s contention that it failed to identify and provide examples
of the inconsistencies in the public record with respect to Secretary Spellings, CREW explained
that Exhibit 1 to its original FOIA request contained documents that highlighted some of the
inconsistencies. Id. CREW also listed additional examples of the serious inconsistencies in its
June 21, 2007 letter. Id.
Finally, CREW answered Education’s contention - - and use of three internet links to
make this point - - that information about the agency’s contacts with educational publishers had
already been examined in the public sphere. Amended Complaint, ¶ 41, Exhibit G to Roth Decl.
¶ 23. CREW pointed out that one of the links the agency provided was expired and the second
and third links focused on a report that was categorically different and distinct from the
information CREW was seeking in its FOIA request. Id.
On August 23, 2007, Education sent a letter responding to CREW’s May 11, 2007 email
that narrowed its original FOIA request. Amended Complaint, ¶ 42 and Exhibit H. Education’s

7

letter once again stated that CREW’s narrowed FOIA request failed to identify the Department
officials whose communications were sought, failed to identify a specific program or specific
subject matter focus for the Department’s search and that the time period identified in the request
predated the legislation that is the subjection of the request. Id.
On September 6, 2007, Education affirmed its denial of CREW’s second fee waiver
appeal of June 21, 2007. Amended Complaint, ¶ 43 and Exhibit I. Education’s letter stated that
CREW had failed to meet its burden with respect to the public interest prong of the fee waiver
test because its FOIA request was “overbroad to qualify for a fee waiver;” that the FOIA request
would not significantly enhance public understanding relative to the inconsistencies in the public
record; and that the information CREW is seeking would not likely contribute significantly to the
public’s understanding of the extent to which publishers were in contact with Education and
Administration personnel during the Reading First development and grant process. Id.
STATUTORY BACKGROUND
The Federal Records Act
The FRA is a series of statutes that govern the creation, management and disposal of
federal records. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2118, 3101-3107 and 3301-3324. Among other things,
the FRA ensures “[a]ccurate and complete documentation of the policies and transactions of the
Federal Government,” as well as “judicious preservation and disposal of records.” 44 U.S.C. §
2902.
To fulfill this purpose, the FRA requires the head of each agency to “make and preserve
records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies,
decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency.” Id. at § 3101. Under the

8

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 9 of 21

statute, each agency must also “establish and maintain an active, continuing program for the
economical and efficient management of the records of the agency,” id. at § 3102, and must
“establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records” the agency head determines are
necessary and required by regulations of the Archivist. Id. at § 3105.
The FRA also prescribes the exclusive mechanism for the disposal of federal records,
which it defines to include:
all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable
materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics,
made or received by an agency of the United States
Government under Federal law or in connection with
the transaction of public business and preserved or
appropriate for preservation by that agency . . as evidence
of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures
operations, or other activities of the Government or because
of the informational value of data in them.
44 U.S.C. § 3301. No records may be “alienated or destroyed” except pursuant to the disposal
provisions of the FRA. Id. at § 3314.
An agency wishing to dispose of records must first submit to the archivist either lists of
records the agency head determines “are not needed by it in the transaction of its current
business,” 44 U.S.C. § 303a(2), or “schedules proposing the disposal after the lapse of specified
periods of time of records of a specified form or character” that the agency head determines will
not have “sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their further
preservation by the Government.” Id. at § 3303a(3). Upon receipt of such a request, the
archivist must issue a notice requesting public comment on the agency’s proposal and the
archivists’s staff must conduct its own assessment of the value of the records the agency is
proposing to destroy. Id. at § 3303a(a). The archivist is free to accept or reject an agency’s

proposal. Id.
The Freedom of Information Act
The FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, requires agencies of the federal government to release
requested records to the public unless one or more specific statutory exemptions apply. An
agency must respond to a party making a FOIA request within 20 working days, notifying that
party of at least the agency’s determination whether or not to fulfill the request, and of the
requester’s right to appeal the agency’s determination to the agency head. 5 U.S.C. §
552(a)(6)(A)(I).
An agency must respond to a FOIA appeal within 20 working days, notifying the
appealing party of the agency’s determination to either release the withheld records or uphold the
denial. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).
This Court has jurisdiction, upon receipt of a complaint, “to enjoin the agency from
withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly
withheld from the complainant.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).
The FOIA also requires each agency to promulgate regulations specifying a fee schedule
for the processing of FOIA requests and establishing procedures and guidelines for the waiver or
reduction of fees. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A). Defendant Education’s fee waiver regulations are
found at 34 CFR § 5.64. Both the FOIA and Education regulations provide that documents
should be produced at no charge to the requester or at a reduced charge if “disclosure of the
information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 34 CFR § 5.64(a).

ARGUMENT
I.

CREW HAS STANDING TO BRING THIS FRA LAWSUIT AGAINST THE
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, THE ARCHIVIST AND NARA
CHALLENGING THEIR FAILURE TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO
ENSURE ADEQUATE PRESERVATION OF ALL AGENCY RECORDS.
CREW’s standing to sue rests on an “an injury-in-fact that is “fairly traceable” to the

challenged act and “likely to be redressed by the requested relief.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S.
737, 751 (1984); see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). CREW’s
injury, an inability to obtain through the FOIA information necessary to accomplish CREW’s
mission, is directly traceable to Education’s improper document retention procedures and the
failure of the Secretary, Archivist and NARA to take enforcement action to ensure adequate
preservation of Education’s records. This is all that Article III of the Constitution requires.
A.

Plaintiff’s Injury is Sufficient to Confer Standing

CREW has met its burden of establishing an injury-in-fact for Article III purposes.
CREW is an organization dedicated to informing and educating the public about the conduct of
public officials. Toward that end, CREW uses the FOIA to gather relevant information.
Here, CREW filed a FOIA request with Education for documents that would reflect,
among other things, the degree to which the Reading First Program has been influenced by
political and other outside interests. Education’s policy of knowingly permitting agency
employees to use outside email accounts when conducting agency business deprived CREW of
access to documents responsive to its FOIA request but not maintained by Education because
they were not stored on agency servers. CREW also put the Secretary, Archivist and NARA on
notice of Education’s refusal to comply with the requirements of the FRA when it sent them a
letter on May 23, 2007, advising them of these practices. Amended Complaint, ¶ 38.
11

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 12 of 21

Because of Education’s record-keeping policies, CREW was frustrated in achieving its
mission when it sought and was denied the requested information. Defendant’s refusal to
comply with the requirements of the FRA has hindered CREW’s ability to report and publish
information in furtherance of its programmatic activities.1 Compare Spann v. Colonial Village,
Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“if an organization points to a concrete and demonstrable
injury to its activities . . .the organization passes through the first [standing] gateway”). Article
III requires nothing more. Additionally, the refusal of the Secretary, Archivist and NARA to
initiate enforcement action to prevent Education’s continued non-compliance of the requirements
of the FRA, further frustrates CREW’s mission and programmatic activities.
In arguing to the contrary, defendant misapplies American Friends Service Committee v.
Webster, 720 F.2d 29, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1983), and mis-characterizes CREW as like those plaintiffs
the Webster Court found were “questionable” for standing purposes. In Webster, various
individuals and organizations challenged the FBI’s records destruction program as contrary to
law, including the FRA. Id. The Court in Webster recognized three categories of plaintiffs: (1) a
group that included individuals and organizations whose need for documents arose out of their
professions, and “had in the past made FOIA requests . . . had other requests pending, and
intended to request FBI files in the future”; (2) a group that consisted of individuals who were
subjects of FBI investigations or alleged victims of FBI activities; and (3) a group that included
organizations seeking to further civil liberties and civil rights who argued that the destruction of

1

As noted in its complaint, CREW uses a combination of research, litigation, advocacy
and public education to expose unethical and illegal conduct by those involved in government.
Complaint ¶ 4. CREW has been “harmed by Education’s failure to comply with the FRA
because that failure has denied CREW access to documents that are a critical part of the record
concerning the Reading First Program.” Id. at ¶ 24.
12

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 13 of 21

the documents deprived them of research materials that they could disseminate. Id.
Here, Education argues that CREW is most analogous to this third group of plaintiffs.
Unlike this group, however, CREW has made FOIA requests in the past, has FOIA requests
pending with Education, and intends to request documents in the future. This distinction makes
CREW like the first group of Webster plaintiffs and dictates here, as in Webster, that CREW has
standing to bring this FRA lawsuit. Like that group, CREW uses the documents it seeks through
its FOIA requests, not for political purposes, but to share information with the public through
memoranda, reports, or press releases. See Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282, 288 (D.C. Cir.
1991) (finding plaintiffs that were researchers and historians who made extensive use of
government documents were within the zone of interests of the records creation and management
provisions of the FRA). For example, on June 27, 2007, CREW released a report, The Best Laid
Plans: The Story of How the Government Ignored its own Gulf Coast Hurricane Plan, about the
problems with the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina victims that relied
significantly on documents CREW obtained through a FOIA request to the Department of State.
CREW has used and will continue to use the FOIA to gain access to agency records that
relate to the propriety of government activity. By adopting a policy whereby Education
employees use outside email accounts to conduct official business with the knowledge that
electronic records created as a result of that use were and continue to be sought under the FOIA,
Education has denied CREW access to requested records. This policy is arbitrary, capricious,
and contrary to law because it results in the failure to preserve records containing adequate and
proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential
transactions of the agency. 44 U.S.C. § 3101. And for any future request, CREW is at the

13

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 14 of 21

complete mercy of Education’s document policy.
To the extent Webster left open whether the kind of injury plaintiff has suffered here is
sufficient for Article III standing purposes, as defendants suggest, post-Webster cases make clear
that denial of information constitutes an injury-in-fact. So, for example, in Federal Election
Comm’n v. Atkins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), the Supreme Court found that a plaintiff had standing to
challenge the Commission’s refusal to disclose campaign-related contributions and expenditures
as the Federal Election Campaign Act requires, reasoning that informational harm is sufficiently
concrete and specific to constitute an injury-in-fact. Likewise, in Public Citizen v. Dep’t of
Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989), the Supreme Court recognized that denial of access to committee
meetings and records under the Federal Advisory Committee Act constituted an injury-in-fact for
Article III purposes. And, in Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,
489 U.S. 749 (1989), a suit under the FOIA challenging the agency’s denial of a request for
specific agency records, standing was satisfied by the denial of requested records.
As a frequent FOIA user, CREW’s interests are also within the zone-of-interests of the
FRA. CREW has used and will continue to use the FOIA to gain access to agency records that
relate to the propriety of government activity. By adopting a policy whereby Education records
are not adequately preserved, the defendants have denied CREW access to requested records.
This policy is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because it results in the failure to
preserve records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions,
policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the agency. 44 U.S.C. § 3101.
Moreover, the information sought by CREW has an undeniable effect upon CREW’s ability to
inform and educate the public, which it does on a continuing, ongoing basis. See Armstrong,

14

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 15 of 21

924 F.2d at 288 (plaintiff researchers and historians who made extensive use of government
documents were within the zone-of-interests of the records creation and management provisions
of the FRA).
In sum, CREW’s inability to obtain information it seeks through its FOIA request for
Education documents has led and will continue to lead to “concrete damage” to CREW’s
mission. Through this impairment, CREW has met its burden of establishing an injury-in-fact
for Article III standing purposes.
B.

CREW’s Injury is Traceable to Defendant’s Practices under the FRA

CREW’s claims of injury are neither speculative nor hypothetical. In March 2007,
CREW requested documents under the FOIA pertaining to Education’s Reading First program
and also sought a waiver of the fees associated with its request. In response to its FOIA and fee
waiver requests, Education released to CREW a CD containing 421 pages of documents
responsive to item four of the FOIA. Education, however, has refused to respond to the
remaining items requested in CREW’s FOIA based on the dubious argument that it needs
clarification of the information CREW is seeking. Roth Decl. at ¶ 7. Moreover, despite
CREW’s May 11th and May 21st appeals which clearly outlined the required elements for a fee
waiver, Education has continued to deny CREW’s request for a fee waiver, based on its
misguided assumption that the disclosure of the information CREW requested would not
contribute to the understanding of the public at large and because it believes that the disclosure
of the information will not contribute significantly to the public understanding of government
operations or activities.
Although CREW sufficiently satisfied the required elements for a fee waiver in both of

15

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 21

Filed 10/29/2007

Page 16 of 21

its appeals, Education refuses to grant CREW a fee waiver, and now bases its Motion to Dismiss
on its own conduct, not CREW’s conduct. The defendants, however, cannot defeat CREW’s
standing by unilaterally declaring CREW’s request insufficient, particularly where their
characterization defies the facts and commonsense. Education continues to argue that it is
unable to respond to CREW’s FOIA request because CREW failed to clarify the request.
CREW, however, attempted to narrow the scope of its FOIA, but to no avail.
First, CREW’s request for documents is sufficiently clear. It is the conduct of Education
that is deficient in failing to come to terms with CREW’s FOIA request as written and clarified.
Each of the issues that Education outlined during the parties’ teleconference and in writing
regarding the broad nature of CREW’s FOIA request were addressed in CREW’s narrowed
request of May 21, 2007.2 Despite CREW’s narrowed request that addresses these issues, the

2

CREW’s narrowed May 21, 2007 FOIA request was not only sufficiently detailed, but it
reasonably describes the information being sought:
Any and all documents and records from January 20, 2001, to the present, in the offices
of: 1) The Secretary, 2) Senior Counselor, 3) Chief of Staff, 4) Deputy Secretary, 5)
Management Improvement Team, 6) Elementary and Secondary Education, 7) Institute of
Education Sciences, 8) Planning Evaluation and Policy Development, 9) Civil Rights, 10)
Innovation and Improvement, 11) Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, 12)
Management, 13) Chief Financial Officer and 14) Communications and Outreach, in the
following categories:
1. All communications of the above-listed offices to, from, or referencing any member of
the White House staff, including, but not limited to, then-Domestic Policy Advisor
Margaret Spellings or Margaret LaMontagne, that mention or relate to Reading First,
Early Reading First, “Scientifically Based Reading Research”/”Science Based Reading
Research”/”SBRR” or DIBELS.
2. All communications of the above-listed offices, including calendar references and

agency continues to claim that CREW has failed to identify the Education officials whose
communications are sought, even though CREW’s May 21st FOIA specifically requested the
communications between 14 of the 33 offices listed on Education’s online Coordinating
Structure Chart and then-Domestic Policy Advisor Margaret Spellings or Margaret LaMontagne.
Moreover, even though CREW’s FOIA is for records related specifically to the Reading First,
Early Reading First, Scientifically Based Reading Research/Science Based Reading
Research/SBRR or DIBELS programs, Education continues to argue that CREW’s FOIA request
fails to identify a specific program or a specific subject matter focus for the agency’s search for
responsive records.
Education is unable to meet its burden of justifying its continued withholding of the
information requested by CREW. In FOIA lawsuits, it is the defendant agency that bears the
burden of justifying its withholding of requested information under the FOIA, and Education has
failed here to meets this burden. LaRouche v. U.S. Dep’t. of Justice, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
25416 (D.D.C. 2001) (In order to justify the adequacy of its search the agency must prove that
“each document that falls within the class requested either has been produced, is unidentifiable,
or is wholly exempt for the Act’s inspection requirements.”). Education has failed to justify its
withholding of the remaining items requested in CREW’s narrowed FOIA of May 21, 2007.
Second, because CREW is entitled to a fee waiver, Education’s continued denial of
CREW’s request for a fee waiver actually reinforces CREW’s injury-in-fact standing argument

consultants, or contractors of the following educational publishers: Houghton Mifflin

Foresman, Voyager (including, but not limited to, Randy Best), Cambium Learning,
Sopris West, and Intellitools.

under Article III. Campbell v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 35 (finding fault with analysis
used by agency to award partial fee waiver).
As the record makes clear, CREW repeatedly met the requirements for a fee waiver and
answered the questions raised by Education - - whether the disclosure of the documents would
contribute to the understanding of the public at large, and whether the disclosure would
contribute significantly to the public’s understanding of government operations. CREW
explained that the documents it sought would contribute significantly to the public’s
understanding of the issues involved because of the significant inconsistencies in the public
record as to the involvement of Secretary Spellings in the administration of the highly
controversial Reading First program. Moreover, the documents CREW is seeking would add to
the public’s understanding of the administration of the Reading First program because CREW
would analyze the information responsive to its request, and would share its analysis with the
public, either through memoranda, reports or press releases.
Under these circumstances, plaintiff’s injury is traceable exclusively to defendant’s
refusal to grant plaintiff a fee waiver and to release to plaintiff its requested records.
II.

CREW’s FRA AND FOIA CLAIMS ARE RIPE FOR ADJUDICATION
Finally, Education argues that CREW’s claims are so “shapeless” as to be unripe.

Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Claims One through Four of the Amended Complaint at 18-23.
To the contrary, CREW has alleged sufficient facts within its Complaint for the Court to
make an informed decision about Education’s violation of the FRA. These allegations regarding
Education’s arbitrary, capricious and illegal policy relate to agency employees’ use of outside
email accounts to conduct official business with the result that Education is not preserving

18

agency records. See Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 33-35, 38. As such, CREW’s claims are not based
on “contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,”
nor are they based on some “abstract disagreements” of policy. See Worth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d
854, 861 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Rather, the allegations in CREW’s Complaint, which are detailed and
specific enough for the Court to ascertain the contours for purposes of judicial review, are based
on Education’s articulated policy and its inability to produce documents responsive to CREW’s
FOIA as a direct result of that policy.
Moreover, the unresolved nature of the fee waiver issue does not deem CREW’s claim
that Education has failed to produce responsive records under the FOIA premature. Education,
without resolution of the fee waiver issue, has already produced over 400 documents to CREW.
Moreover, even though Education informed CREW of the requirement of prepayment of fees
exceeding $250 because of the broad scope of CREW’s FOIA request, Education has never
informed CREW of the ultimate cost of producing the documents for CREW. CREW’s last
appeal regarding the fee waiver issue was on June 21, 2007. In this appeal, CREW included a
packet of information that outlined the required elements for a fee waiver and included exhibits.
Education did not respond to CREW’s final appeal until September 6, 2007, and never once
informed CREW what the cost would be for the search and production of the documents at issue.
Instead, it merely concluded that CREW’s appeal and Education’s response constituted
exhaustion of the administrative remedies available to CREW under FOIA, and informed CREW
that it had the right to seek judicial review of the decision. Therefore, CREW’s claims under the
FRA and the FOIA are ripe for adjudication.

PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS ONE THROUGH FOUR STATE CLAIMS UNDER THE
FRA AND THE FOIA
In order for a Court to grant a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure, it should accept the allegations of the complaint as true, draw all inferences in the
plaintiff's favor, and affirm only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts
that could be proved consistent with the allegations. Croixland Properties Ltd. P'ship v.
Corcoran, 174 F.3d 213, 215 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The Court will, therefore, look to whether the
plaintiff can prove any set of facts consistent with the allegations in its complaint that will entitle
it to relief. Id.
The FRA requires that the head of each agency “make and preserve records containing
adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, and essential transactions of the agency.” 44 U.S.C. § 3101. The FOIA provides that
each agency shall make its records promptly available upon request. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).
Here, CREW has alleged in its Amended Complaint the necessary facts to state claims under
these statutes, specifically that it was denied access to agency records it requested under the
FOIA that were created by agency employees using outside email accounts, and that the
defendants knew employees were using outside email accounts but took no action to ensure
appropriate preservation of all agency records. These facts alone are sufficient to state claims for
relief under the FRA and the FOIA. CREW, however, has gone beyond these facts to provide
additional facts within its Complaint of its attempt to work with Education to not only clarify and
narrow its FOIA request, but also resolve any outstanding issues related to its request for a fee
waiver. Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 32-34, 37, 41.
Looking at the totality of CREW’s complaint it is clear that any deficiencies are those of
20

the defendants and their near complete failure to comply with their statutory obligations under
the FOIA and FRA. It necessarily follows that defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state
a claim must be denied.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, CREW respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants’
motion to dismiss.
