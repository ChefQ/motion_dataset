Case No. 1:07CV00963-RMU

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS CLAIMS ONE THROUGH FOUR OF THE
AMENDED COMPLAINT
INTRODUCTION
The Department of Education (“the Department”) has maintained throughout this
litigation that Plaintiff, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington’s (“Plaintiff”), real
complaint and only alleged injury arise from the Department’s response to Plaintiff’s March 28,
2007 Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request. The Department denied Plaintiff’s request
for a fee waiver and therefore, by regulation, suspended processing that request. Plaintiff,
however, filed this action under the Federal Records Act (“FRA”), alleging that Plaintiff failed to
receive emails responsive to its request because the Department has not properly maintained
emails created pursuant to an alleged policy authorizing employees to conduct official business
by private email accounts. No such policy exists. But even if it did, none of Plaintiff’s factual

Page 2 of 27

allegations substantiate the alleged FRA violation. That alleged violation like the policy
purportedly challenged here is a product of Plaintiff’s imagination.
Now that the Department’s original motion to dismiss is fully briefed and pending before
this Court, Plaintiff has conceded that its allegations give rise to a FOIA claim based on the
Department’s fee waiver denial and has amended the Complaint to include that claim. However,
rather than voluntarily dismiss the improperly brought FRA claim, Plaintiff merely bootstraps its
FOIA claim here. The Amended Complaint cures none of the deficiencies with Plaintiff’s FRA
claim and incredibly adds two new Defendants to that claim. Thus, all of the arguments in the
Department’s previous filings apply with equal force here. See Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss
for Lack of Jurisdiction (filed July 23, 2007); Reply in Support of Defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction (filed Sept. 10, 2007); Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to File Surreply (filed Sept. 11, 2007). Plaintiff’s FRA claim, even as
amended, still should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as to all Defendants.
Dismissal on that basis is also warranted for Plaintiff’s newly alleged claim challenging
the Department’s failure to produce records under FOIA. That claim is premature at best or
alternatively fails to state a claim given the suspended status of Plaintiff’s FOIA request. By
regulation, the Department cannot process that request until the issue over fees is resolved and
therefore, at least until then, has no obligation to produce records. Thus, the only claim properly
before this Court is Plaintiff’s challenge to the denial of its request for a fee waiver.1 All other
claims in this action should dismissed.

1

While Defendants do not dispute that this Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s
challenge to the fee waiver denial, they do dispute that that claim has any merit.

STATUTORY BACKGROUND
Federal Records Act
The Federal Records Act sets forth agency requirements for records creation,
management, and disposal. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 2101, et seq., 2901, et seq., 3101, et seq., 3301, et
seq. Specifically, the Act requires agencies to establish standards and procedures intended to
promote “[a]ccurate and complete documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal
Government,” “[c]ontrol of the quantity and quality of records produced by the Federal
Government,” “[s]implification of the activities, systems, and processes of records creation and
of records maintenance and use,” and “[j]udicious preservation and disposal of records.” 44
U.S.C. § 2902(1), (2), (4), (5). The Archivist “shall provide guidance and assistance to Federal
agencies . . . to ensur[e] adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of
the Federal Government and ensur[e] proper records disposition.” 44 U.S.C. § 2904.
Towards those ends, agencies are required to “make and preserve records containing
adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, and essential transactions of the agency.” 44 U.S.C. § 3101. Each agency must
establish “controls over the creation and . . . maintenance and use” of such records and establish
safeguards against their unauthorized removal or loss. 44 U.S.C. §§ 3102, 3105. Every agency
head must submit to the Archivist a list of records in the agency’s custody and proposed
schedules for their disposal after specified lapses of time. See 44 U.S.C. § 3303. The disposal
schedules are published for notice and comment and thereafter must be approved by the Archivist
before records may be disposed pursuant to them. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3303, 3303a. Federal
records may only be destroyed pursuant to disposition schedules approved by the Archivist. See
3

Page 4 of 27

44 U.S.C. §§ 3303, 3303a.
If an agency head becomes aware of “any actual, impending, or threatened unlawful
removal, defacing, alteration, or destruction of [agency] records,” the agency head, with the
assistance of the Archivist, “shall initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of
the records he knows or has reason to believe have been unlawfully removed from his agency.”
44 U.S.C. § 3106. If the Archivist learns of such actual or threatened unlawful activity, he must
notify the agency head and, if the agency head fails to take action to recover the records or seek
other redress within a reasonable time, the Archivist shall request that the Attorney General
initiate such an action. See 44 U.S.C. § 2905.
Freedom of Information Act
The Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) generally requires each agency to “make
available to the public” agency records and other information unless exempted by the Act. See 5
U.S.C. § 552. Specifically, the Act provides that “each agency, upon any request for [such]
records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published
rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records
promptly available to any person.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).
Each Agency is required to promulgate regulations “specifying the schedule of fees
applicable to the processing of requests under th[at] section and establishing procedures and
guidelines for determining when such fees should be waived or reduced.” 5 U.S.C. §
552(a)(4)(A)(i). Such regulations must provide that:
(1) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search,
duplication, and review, when records are requested for commercial use;

4

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 18

Filed 10/16/2007

Page 5 of 27

(2) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication
when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an
educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or
scientific research; or a representative of the news media; and
(3) for any request not described in (1) or (2), fees shall be limited to reasonable
standard charges for document search and duplication.
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). “No agency may require advance payment of any fees unless the
requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, or the agency has determined that
the fees will exceed $250.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(v).
The Department of Education’s regulations pursuant to these provisions are set forth in
34 C.F.R. Subtitle A, Part 5.
STATEMENT OF FACTS2
On March 28, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the Department of Education
seeking four broad categories of documents:
(1) “All communications from any Department office . . . to, from, or referencing
any member of the White House staff . . . that mention or relate to Reading First,
‘Science Based Reading Research’/’SBRR,’ DIBELS, or any other issue related to
reading instruction or education”;
(2) “All Department contacts or communications . . . with education publishers,
their executives, employees, consultants, or contractors”;
(3) “All Department contacts or communications that mention or relate to contacts
with educational publishers, their executives, or employees”; and

2

The Statement of Facts is based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint
(“Amend. Compl.”), the admissions of Plaintiff, and the attached Declaration of Angela
Arrington (“Arrington Decl.”), all of which this Court properly may consider in ruling on a
motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. See National Community Reinvestment Coalition v.
National Credit Union Admin., 290 F. Supp. 2d 124, 131 (D.D.C. 2003) (“In resolving a Rule
12(b)(1) motion for lack of jurisdiction . . . courts are generally free to consider relevant
materials outside the pleadings.”).

(4) “[A]ll documents previously disclosed under FOIA to Andrew Brownstein,
Travis Hicks and/or the Title I Monitor.”
Amended Complaint (“Amend. Compl.”) Ex. A (emphasis omitted). Plaintiff requested that the
fees associated with processing its request be waived. See Amend. Compl. Ex. A.
Department personnel, upon receiving Plaintiff’s request, reviewed it and determined that
it did “not reasonably describe the records sought” and therefore could not be processed as
written. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 7. Plaintiff’s request, for example, did not specify the names of
Department or White House personnel or publishing company employees whose communications
were sought. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 7. A search for records with “White House” or a publisher’s
name would be unduly burdensome and overly broad. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 7.
By letter dated April 16, 2007, the Department acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff’s FOIA
request and enclosed a CD responsive to item (4) of Plaintiff’s request containing documents
“previously disclosed under FOIA to the Title I Monitor.” See Amend. Compl. Ex. B. The letter
went on to explain that the Department needed “clarification for items 1 through 3 of [Plaintiff’s]
request” which “encompass a large volume of information on broad topics related to individuals
in the Department and ‘White House staff,’ without identifying specific individuals, offices, or
subjects.” Arrington Decl. ¶ 8 & Amend. Compl. Ex. B. Plaintiff was advised that “the
Department is unable to process your request regarding items 1 through 3 without further
clarification.” Arrington Decl. ¶ 8 & Amend. Compl. Ex. B. The letter also informed Plaintiff
that its fee waiver request had been denied because Plaintiff had not demonstrated entitlement to
a waiver under FOIA. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 8. The Department therefore advised Plaintiff that
until these issues were resolved, the Department could not process Plaintiff’s request. See

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 18

Page 7 of 27

Arrington Decl. ¶¶ 5c & 8.
At Plaintiff’s request, agency personnel participated in a teleconference with Plaintiff to
discuss its FOIA request. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9. Plaintiff did not understand why the
Department could not process its request as written and apparently was under the misimpression
that the Department had centralized electronic search capabilities. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9a. In
an effort to correct that misimpression, the teleconference participants explained that to fulfill
Plaintiff’s request for “[a]ll Department . . . communications . . . with educational publishers,
their executives, employees, consultants, or contractors,” every Department employee’s email
account would have to be searched “one at a time.” See Arrington Decl. ¶¶ 6 & 9a. Plaintiff
was further advised that, even assuming the Department had the resources to conduct such a
broad search, the agency could not capture all such communications because without individual
names, the Department could not identify publishers’ “executives, employees, consultants, or
contractors . . . [that] chose to contact Department employees using private e-mail accounts.”
See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9c. Plaintiff inquired what it needed to do to sufficiently narrow its request
and was advised to review the request again in light of the discussion. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9.
The Department also agreed to allow Plaintiff to submit additional information in support of its
request for a fee waiver, which Plaintiff did by email dated May 11, 2007. See Arrington Decl.
¶¶ 9-10.
In a subsequent telephone conversation on May 14, 2007, the Department confirmed that
if Plaintiff wanted the Department to include private emails in its search that Plaintiff would have
to supply those email addresses. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 11. By email dated May 14, 2007,
Plaintiff memorialized its understanding of the conversations with the Department on narrowing
7

its FOIA request as follows:
the Department’s FOIA technology does not allow for subject matter or keyword
searches throughout the email system, so a search undertaken pursuant to the
original terms of our request would require individual searches of each of the
Department’s approximately 4,500 employee email accounts. Additionally, . . .
email communications on personal email accounts would not be covered by such
a search3 . . . .
See Amend. Compl. Ex. G at p. 71. Plaintiff also renewed its request for a copy of the FOIA
request submitted by Title I Monitor. See Amend. Compl. Ex. G at p. 71. Plaintiff indicated that
it would “formalize any narrowing language in a letter to the Department.” See Amend. Compl.
Ex. G at p. 71. Plaintiff’s purportedly narrowed FOIA request sought from fourteen identified
Department offices, “[a]ll communications . . . [with] White House staff . . . that mention or
relate to Reading First, Early Reading First, ‘Scientifically Based Reading Research’/‘Science
Based Reading Research’/‘SBRR’ or DIBELS” and “all communications” with employees of
Houghton Mifflin, SRA/McGraw Hill, Pearson Scott Foresman, Voyager, Cambium Learning,
Sopris West, and Intellitools. See Amend. Compl. Ex. E. However, Plaintiff provided only two
publishing company employees by name. See Amend. Compl. Ex. E. Plaintiff also added a
request for all communications that mention or relate to an additional program, Early Reading
First. See Amend. Compl. Ex. E. Otherwise, “all other language in [Plaintiff’s] original request
[] remain[ed] unchanged.” See Amend. Compl. Ex. E.

3

This statement evidently is the source of Plaintiff’s confusion. Plaintiff was actually
told that “it is not unheard of for members of the public to contact Department employees using
private e-mail accounts” and that without individual names, the Department would not be able to
capture such communications in its search. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9c.

On May 15, 2007, Plaintiff sent a letter to the Department’s Inspector General requesting
that his office commence an investigation into “the extent to which Department of Education
employees have been using non-governmental e-mail accounts for official business.” Amend.
Compl. Ex. C. The letter speculated that “[i]f [] employees are regularly using private email
accounts to send official email and the Department neither tracks nor stores such email . . . the
Department . . . is likely operating in violation of the Federal Records Act.” Amend. Compl. Ex.
C. Plaintiff sent Dr. Allen Weinstein, the Archivist of the United States, and several members of
Congress a carbon copy of that letter. See Amend. Compl. Ex. C.
A week later, Plaintiff filed the instant action alleging that the Department had violated
the FRA by failing to preserve and properly dispose of records allegedly created pursuant to the
“policy of Education to permit agency employees to use outside email accounts to conduct
official business.” Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 49, 53. That same day, Plaintiff announced on its website
that it had “sent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to seven agencies seeking copies of
all record-keeping guidance and policies” because it was “trying to determine whether agency
non-compliance with federal record-keeping laws and regulations, especially as to email, is a
government-wide problem.” Crew Sends FOIA Requests Seeking Record-Keeping Policies to
Seven Agencies (“CREW Sends FOIA Requests”) (May 22, 2007), published at
http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/28510. The May 22, 2007 request sent to the Department
of Education requested “any and all record-keeping guidance and policies dating from January 1,
2001, to the present . . . includ[ing] . . . guidance and policies on the creation, maintenance and
disposition of federal records, including guidance and policies concerning the Federal Records

Act.”4 Arrington Decl. Ex. A. On May 23, 2007, the day after submitting that FOIA request and
filing the instant lawsuit, Plaintiff sent a letter to the Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings
advising her of the lawsuit and requesting that she “initiate action” to prevent any alleged
“further removal or destruction of the electronic records.” Amend. Compl. ¶ 38.
Through an exchange of letters beginning June 8, 2007, the Department affirmed its
earlier denial of Plaintiff’s request for a fee waiver, and Plaintiff appealed that decision. See
Amend. Compl. Exs. F, G, I. The Department advised Plaintiff, however, that by regulation, the
Department was required to “allow a requester to modify [its] request if fees of more than $25.00
are anticipated” and that advanced payment was required “if the cost is expected to be greater
than $250.00.” Amend. Compl. Ex. F. Plaintiff was encouraged to narrow its request because its
“broad scope . . . would require significant time and resources to search for and review
responsive records.” Amend. Compl. Ex. F. Plaintiff to date has not provided the required
clarification. Arrington Decl. ¶ 19.
By letter dated June 6, 2007, the Department reaffirmed its denial of Plaintiff’s fee waiver
request and advised Plaintiff that “[t]his letter constitutes exhaustion of the administrative
remedies available . . . under FOIA.” Amend. Compl. Ex. I.
On October 2, 2007, after the Department’s original motion to dismiss was fully briefed
and pending before the Court, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint containing three new claims
and three new Defendants. Claim One alleges that the Department and Secretary Spellings
violated the FRA by failing to preserve records created pursuant to the alleged policy authorizing

By letter dated August 8, 2007, the Department provided Plaintiff with past and current
copies of the Department’s policies and procedures for complying with the Federal Records Act
in response to Plaintiff’s May 22, 2007 FOIA request. Arrington Decl. ¶ 14.

employees to conduct official business over private email accounts. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 4750. Claim Two alleges that the Department and the Secretary violated the FRA by permitting
disposal of records created pursuant to that alleged policy. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 51-55. Claim
Three alleges that the Archivist and the Secretary violated the FRA by failing to initiate
enforcement action against the Department for its alleged record-keeping practices. See Amend.
Compl. ¶¶ 56-62. Claims Four and Five allege that the Department violated FOIA by,
respectively, failing to produce records responsive to Plaintiff’s March 28, 2007 FOIA request
and denying Plaintiff’s request for a fee waiver. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 63-69. Only Claims
One through Four are at issue in this motion.5
ARGUMENT
With the exception of Plaintiff’s challenge to the Department’s fee waiver denial, none of
the claims in the Amended Complaint is properly before this Court. “The judicial power of the
United States . . . is not an unconditioned authority” but is limited by Article III of the
Constitution.” Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &
State, 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). That Article “confines the federal courts to adjudicating actual
‘cases’ and ‘controversies.’” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984). In the absence of an
actual case or controversy, the Court is without jurisdiction to decide the case. See Warth v.
Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975); see also Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 502 (1961). Thus, a
court must ensure that its authority is invoked where there is “a lively conflict between
antagonistic demands, actively pressed, which make resolution of the controverted issue a
practical necessity,” (id. at 503) – a requirement “founded in concern about the proper – and
5

Defendants have filed an Answer in response to Claim Five.

properly limited – role of the courts in a democratic society,” (Warth, 422 U.S. at 498).
Otherwise, “the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public
significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the
questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.”
Id. at 500.
In an effort to give meaning to Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement, “courts have
developed a series of principles termed ‘justiciability doctrines,’ among which are standing,
ripeness, mootness, and the political question doctrine.” National Treas. Employees Union v.
United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1996). These doctrines consist of both “prudential
elements which Congress is free to override and core component[s] which are essential and
unchanging part[s] of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.” Id. (internal quotations
omitted). This action implicates core components of that requirement – standing and ripeness –
whose absence requires dismissal of Claims One through Four in the Amended Complaint for
lack of jurisdiction.
I.

THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S FRA CLAIMS IN THIS
ACTION FOR LACK OF STANDING.
All of the FRA claims in the Amended Complaint should be dismissed on standing

grounds. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 47-62. A plaintiff’s standing is a “predicate to any exercise of
[this Court’s] jurisdiction.” Florida Audubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996).
Standing is “an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement.” Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The requirements of standing are well
established. See id. at 560-61. “[A plaintiff] must show injury in fact that was caused by the

12

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Filed 10/16/2007

Page 13 of 27

conduct of the defendants and that can be redressed by judicial relief.” Public Citizen, Inc. v.
National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 489 F.3d 1279, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The absence of
any one of these elements is sufficient to dismiss a claim on standing grounds. See US Ecology,
Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Interior, 231 F.3d 20, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“a deficiency on any
one of the three [elements] suffices to defeat standing”). Indeed, “[u]ntil a judicially cognizable
injury is shown no other inquiry is relevant to consideration of [] standing.” Schlesinger v.
Reservists Comm. to Stop War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 n.16 (1974). Dismissal is required here
because Plaintiff has not alleged a cognizable injury.
A.

Plaintiff’s Alleged Injury Is Insufficient to Confer Standing Under the FRA.

Plaintiff’s only alleged injury is “denied [] access to records . . . ‘in the public interest’”
and “harm[ to Plaintiff’s] ability to provide full, accurate and current information to the public.”
Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 10, 12. This case squarely presents a question left open in prior FRA cases,
namely, whether such injury is sufficient for standing purposes. Courts in this Circuit have
suggested that its sufficiency is “questionable.” See American Friends Serv. Comm. v. Webster,
720 F.2d 29, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1983); American Friends Serv. Comm. v. Webster, 485 F. Supp. 222,
227 (D.D.C. 1980). In Webster, three categories of plaintiffs brought an action to challenge the
FBI’s record destruction program. One category of plaintiffs included “organizations whose
goals and purposes are alleged to require access to the files and records of the FBI in order to
enable them to disseminate information for organizational, educational, and political purposes.”
Id. at 226. These plaintiffs claimed that if the FBI’s files were destroyed, “they w[ould] be
deprived of raw material for primary research in the areas of their activities.” Id. at 227. The
district court regarded that claimed injury as “questionable” for standing purposes. Id. However,
13

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 18

Filed 10/16/2007

Page 14 of 27

because the other plaintiffs had adequately shown injury for standing purposes, the district court
concluded that it was “not necessary to decide that question.” Id. In the subsequent appeal, the
D.C. Circuit also refrained from deciding that question “[s]ince the district court based its finding
of standing only on the injuries . . . [of the other] groups of plaintiffs.” Webster, 720 F.2d at 46
n.23. Thus, it is “unsettled whether the requisite injury-in-fact standard is met” by an
organization’s claimed need for files earmarked for destruction to “disseminate information” for
organizational, educational, or political purposes. See Webster, 485 F. Supp. at 226-27.
Even if that injury were sufficient for standing purposes, Plaintiff could not make that
claim here because of the status of Plaintiff’s FOIA request. The Department has not begun to
process Plaintiff’s requests for communications between the Department and White House staff
concerning the Reading First Program or for communications between the Department and
educational publishers. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 16. Therefore, no determination has been made as
to which Department records are responsive to that request and thus Plaintiff cannot possibly
claim that any documents needed for its purposes have been earmarked for destruction. See
Arrington Decl. ¶ 17. Plaintiff merely speculates that documents responsive to its request are not
properly being maintained. See Amend. Compl. Ex. C. (“If . . . Department of Education
employees are using or have used outside, non-governmental email addresses for government
business and have not retained copies of those records on the Department’s files, the Department
is failing to ‘accurate[ly] and complete[ly] document[] the policies and transactions of the
Federal Government’ . . . in violation of the FRA”); id. (“If [] employees are regularly using
private email accounts to send official email and the Department neither tracks nor stores such
email . . . the Department of Education is likely operating in violation of the Federal Records
14

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Act”).
It is well established, however, that speculative or hypothetical claims of injury are
insufficient to confer standing. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426
U.S. 26, 44 (1976) (“unadorned speculation will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial
power”). Rather, the alleged injury “must be certainly impending,” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495
U.S. 149, 158 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and “real and immediate,”
City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983). Since Plaintiff’s claimed injury is
neither, Plaintiff lacks standing as to all of its FRA claims, which are predicated on the same
speculation. See Amend. Compl. Ex. C (Letter from CREW Executive Director to the
Department of Education’s Inspector General (May 15, 2007)) (alleging that “if” the Department
is failing to preserve emails from private email accounts, it “likely” is operating in violation of
the FRA); Amend. Compl. ¶ 58 (alleging that the Archivist and the Secretary violated the FRA
by failing to initiate action based on Plaintiff’s speculation in that letter).
B.

Plaintiff’s Alleged Injury Is Not Traceable to Defendants’ Practices Under
the FRA.

Plaintiff alternatively lacks standing because its alleged injury was not caused by either
the Department’s alleged practices under the FRA or the alleged failure of the Archivist or
Secretary to initiate action based on such practices. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 50, 54 (alleging harm
from denial of “a right of access to information in the public interest”); see also Amend. Compl.
¶ 60. Standing requires that the alleged injury be “‘fairly traceable’ to the challenged act.”
National Treasury, 101 F.3d at 1427. Plaintiff’s alleged injury clearly is not. Plaintiff “[t]o date
[] has not received copies of any emails responsive to its March 28, 2007 FOIA request,”

15

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Page 16 of 27

(Amend. Compl. ¶ 44), not because of any alleged noncompliance with the FRA by Defendants
but because the Department has suspended processing Plaintiff’s FOIA request.
If, as here, there is an unresolved issue over fees associated with a FOIA request, the
Department by regulation suspends processing that request. See 34 C.F.R. § 5.62(c) (“Requests
under this section are not deemed to have been received . . . until the Department receives the
satisfactory assurance [of full payment] or advance payment”); 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A); see also
Arrington Decl. ¶ 5c (explaining that processing is suspended if a fee waiver request is denied
and not successfully appealed). Plaintiff was so advised well before this action was filed. See
Amend. Compl. Ex. B (Letter from Maria-Teresa Cueva to Daniel Roth (Apr. 16, 2007))
(advising Plaintiff that “[o]nce we receive your clarification and the issues regarding charges are
resolved, we will begin processing your request”). Thus, Plaintiff’s failure to receive emails –
indeed, any communications – responsive to its request has nothing to do with the Department’s
FRA practices.6

6

In the April 16, 2007 letter denying Plaintiff’s fee waiver request, the Department
enclosed a CD containing records previously disclosed to another FOIA requester. That letter
made clear, however, that the Department could not process Items 1-3 of Plaintiff’s FOIA request
until Plaintiff provided the requested clarification. See Amend. Compl. Ex. B; see also Amend.
Compl. Ex. F (Letter to Daniel Roth from Maria-Teresa Cueva (June 8, 2007)) (“The Department
notes initially that, because you received information responsive to item number 4 of your March
28, 2007 request, your request for a fee waiver is deemed to concern only the items numbered 1,
2 and 3”). Only those items requested “communications.” See Amend. Compl. Ex. A (Plaintiff’s
March 28, 2007 FOIA request).

Plaintiff is also well aware that even upon resolution of the fee issue, the Department
cannot process that request because it is overly broad, and Plaintiff to date has failed to
sufficiently narrow the scope.7 See Arrington Decl. ¶ 19 (“As [Plaintiff’s] request currently
reads, it does not reasonably describe the records sought and therefore, even upon resolution of
the fee dispute, the Department cannot begin to search for responsive records until the requester
clarifies the request.”); see also Amend. Compl. Ex. B (Letter from Maria-Teresa Cueva to
Daniel Roth (Apr. 16, 2007)) (“Items 1 through 3 of your request encompass a large volume of
information on broad topics . . . [and c]onsequently, your request does not reasonably describe
the records sought, and the Department is unable to process your request regarding items 1
through 3 without further clarification”); Arrington Decl. ¶ 9 (describing May 9, 2007 telephone
call with Plaintiff to discuss the “need for CREW to narrow the request”); Amend. Compl. Ex. E
(Email from Daniel Roth to Angela Arrington (May 21, 2007)) (acknowledging that Plaintiff was
advised that the “technological limitations of the Department’s email search technology would
require the Department to search approximately 4,500 email accounts unless the request is
narrowed further”); Amend. Compl. Ex. F (Letter from Maria-Teresa Cueva to Daniel Roth (June
8, 2007)) (reiterating that “[a]s the Department indicated during the May 9, 2007 conference call
. . . we encourage you to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the
requested information as expeditiously as possible”). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff has
suffered any injury at all, it is traceable to Plaintiff’s own failure to submit an appropriately

7

Although Plaintiff submitted a purportedly narrowed request the day before filing its
initial Complaint in this action, Plaintiff’s revised request “failed to sufficiently narrow the scope
or reasonably describe the records sought” and therefore remains insufficient for processing
under the FOIA. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 13 & Amend. Compl. Ex. E.

narrowed FOIA request and secondarily to the Department’s refusal to waive the substantial costs
to process the request as submitted. Standing, however, requires that the alleged injury be
traceable to the conduct challenged. Since that is clearly not the case as to any of Plaintiff’s FRA
claims, those claims should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
II.

NEITHER PLAINTIFF’S FRA CLAIMS NOR ITS FOIA CLAIM ALLEGING
THAT THE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS IS RIPE
FOR RESOLUTION.
This Court should dismiss all of Plaintiff’s claims, with the exception of its challenge to

the fee waiver denial, as unripe. The ripeness doctrine “shares the constitutional requirement of
standing that an injury in fact be certainly impending,” which, as discussed earlier, is not so here.
National Treasury, 101 F.3d at 1427. Prudentially, however, the ripeness doctrine “prevent[s]
the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract
disagreements.” Worth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d 854, 861 (D.C. Cir. 2006). By refusing to hear such
disagreements, federal courts “enhance judicial economy, and ensure that a record adequate to
support an informed decision exists when the case is heard.” Navegar, Inc. v. United States, 103
F.3d 994, 998 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Where, as here, “the dispute is so shapeless that the [C]ourt is
necessarily called upon to hypothesize regarding not only the facts of the dispute, but the very
‘policy’ . . . that is challenged[] such is the [] paradigm of an advisory opinion.” Hotel &
Restaurant Employees Union v. Smith, 846 F.2d 1499, 1517 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Since this Court
lacks jurisdiction to issue such opinions, Claims One through Four should be dismissed.

Plaintiff’s FRA Claims Are Predicated on Contingent Events.

Plaintiff effectively concedes that whether the alleged Department policy authorizing use
of private email accounts – even assuming it existed – violates the FRA is contingent on whether
the Department is properly retaining and disposing of emails created under that policy. See
Amend. Compl. Ex. C (Letter from CREW Executive Director to the Department of Education’s
Inspector General (May 15, 2007)) (“If . . . Department of Education employees are using or have
used outside, non-governmental email addresses for government business and have not retained
copies of those records on the Department’s files, the Department is failing to ‘accurate[ly] and
complete[ly] document[] the policies and transactions of the Federal Government’ . . . in
violation of the FRA” (emphasis added)); id. (“If [] employees are regularly using private email
accounts to send official email and the Department neither tracks nor stores such email . . . the
Department of Education is likely operating in violation of the Federal Records Act” (emphasis
added)). Plaintiff originally alleged no facts of such unlawful operation. Now, after testing its
theory of “non-compliance with federal record-keeping laws and regulations, especially as to
email,” Plaintiff still is unable to allege facts substantiating an FRA violation by the Department.
CREW Sends FOIA Requests, at http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/28510; see also Arrington
Decl. ¶ 14 & Ex. A (Plaintiff’s May 22, 2007 FOIA Request to the Department of Education)
(requesting “any and all record-keeping guidance and policies dating from January 1, 2001, to the
present, for federal records of the Department”).8 Even after receiving copies of the
Department’s policies, Plaintiff continues to rely on the same allegations from the Original
8

Plaintiff submitted this FOIA request the same day it filed this action. The Department
produced copies of its current record-keeping policies to Plaintiff on August 8, 2007. See
Arrington Decl. ¶ 14.

Complaint filed when Plaintiff admittedly was “trying to determine” whether there was agency
non-compliance with the FRA. See CREW Sends FOIA Requests, at
http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/28510 (announcing that CREW sent FOIA requests to
“seven agencies seeking copies of all record-keeping guidance and policies” because “CREW is
trying to determine whether agency non-compliance with federal record-keeping laws and
regulations, especially as to email, is a government-wide problem”). Specifically, Plaintiff
alleges only that it was advised that “[communications from private email addresses] would not
be included in the agency’s response to [Plaintiff’s] FOIA request.” Amend. Compl. ¶ 34; see
also Amend. Compl. ¶ 32 (alleging that the Plaintiff was advised that “Education ‘wouldn’t have
access to that’”).9 That basis is wholly inadequate for an informed decision by this Court and
thus Plaintiff’s FRA claims against the Department are clearly unripe. See Navegar, Inc., 103
F.3d at 998 (noting that the ripeness requirement ensures that the record before the court is
“adequate to support an informed decision”).
Since Plaintiff’s other FRA claims against the Secretary and the Archivist are predicated
on that same insubstantial basis, those claims necessarily are unripe, too. See Amend. Compl. ¶
58 (alleging that the “Archivist has violated his mandatory, non-discretionary duty since May 15,
2007 . . . [to] commence an immediate investigation”);10 Amend. Compl. ¶ 59 (alleging that
Secretary Spellings “has violated her mandatory, non-discretionary duty to maintain safeguards

9

This allegation, however, appears in a sentence that has no clear reference for the
singular pronoun “that.” See Amend. Compl. ¶ 32. Plaintiff instead has cobbled together
seemingly unrelated statements in an effort to bolster its deficient claims under the FRA.
10

The May 15, 2007 date is a reference to Plaintiff’s letter to the Department of
Education Inspector General. See Amend. Compl. Ex. C. The Archivist as well as several
members of Congress merely received a carbon copy of that letter.

to prevent the removal of Education records”). None of the allegations in the Complaint
demonstrates “any actual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal . . . or destruction of
records in the [Department’s] custody” that would give rise to either the Archivist’s or the
Secretary’s enforcement obligations under the FRA. See 44 U.S.C. § 2905; 44 U.S.C. § 3106.
Instead, as already discussed, Plaintiff has alleged mere contingencies. See Amend. Compl. Ex.
C (Letter from CREW Executive Director to the Department of Education’s Inspector General
(May 15, 2007)) (alleging that “if” the Department has not retained copies of records created on
“outside, non-governmental email addresses,” it is “in violation of the FRA”); id. (“If . . . the
Department neither tracks nor stores such email . . . the Department of Education is likely
operating in violation of the Federal Records Act”). All of Plaintiff’s FRA claims therefore are
improperly before this Court.
B.

Plaintiff’s Challenge to the Department’s Failure to Produce Records
Responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA Request Is Unripe.

As long as the fee waiver issue remains unresolved, Plaintiff’s claim that the Department
failed to produce responsive records is premature at best. See Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 61, 62 (alleging
that Plaintiff “is entitled by law to access to the records requested under the FOIA . . . . [and
t]herefore, defendant violated FOIA’s mandate to release agency records”). FOIA obligates an
agency to produce nonexempt records upon a request that “reasonably describes such records and
[] is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures
to be followed.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). In the absence of such a request, that obligation is not
triggered. Here, the Department has no obligation to produce responsive records because
Plaintiff has not reasonably described the records it seeks and the issue of fees is unresolved.

21

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 18

Filed 10/16/2007

Page 22 of 27

See, e.g., Amend. Compl. Ex. B (“Once we receive your clarification and the issues regarding
charges are resolved, we will begin processing your request.”); id. (“your request does not
reasonably describe the records sought, and the Department is unable to process your request
regarding items 1 through 3 without further clarification”).
Indeed, by regulation, a request that involves such a significant expenditure of time and
resources to process is not even “deemed to have been received . . . until the Department receives
the satisfactory assurance [of full payment] or advance payment.” 34 C.F.R. § 5.62(c). It is well
established that “[i]f no FOIA request is received, an agency has no reason to search or produce
records and similarly has no basis to respond.” Brunsilius v. United States Department of
Energy, 2007 WL 2791709, at *4-5 (D.D.C., Sept. 26, 2007) (concluding that “[w]here DOE
requires an advance payment by the requester, the request is not considered received until the
payment is in the agency’s possession”); Carbe v. BATF, 2004 WL 2051359, at *8 (D.D.C., Aug.
12, 2004) (“If no FOIA request is received, an agency has no reason to search and produce
records . . . .”); Hutchins v. Department of Justice, 2005 WL 1334941, at 2 (D.D.C., June 6,
2005) (“Without any showing that the agency received the request, the agency has no obligation
to respond to it.”); see also Pollack v. Department of Justice, 49 F.3d 115, 120 (4th Cir. 1995)
(concluding that an agency “had the authority to cease processing [a FOIA] request” where the
requester did not commit to pay the required advance payment). Under the circumstances here,
the Department properly suspended processing Plaintiff’s request and had no obligation to
produce the requested communications.

Document 18

Plaintiff’s March 28, 2007 FOIA request sought four broad categories of records:
(1) “All communications from any Department office . . . to, from, or referencing any
member of the White House staff . . . that mention or relate to Reading First, ‘Science
Based Reading Research’/‘SBRR,’ DIBELS, or any other issue related to reading
instruction or education”;
(2) “All Department contacts or communications . . . with educational publishers, their
executives, employees, consultants, or contractors”;
(3) “All Department contacts or communications that mention or relate to contacts with
educational publishers, their executives, or employees”; and
(4) “[A]ll documents previously disclosed under FOIA to Andrew Brownstein, Travis
Hicks and/or the Title I Monitor.”
Amend. Compl. Ex. A (emphasis omitted). Plaintiff was advised that the Department could not
process Items (1), (2), or (3) without further clarification. See Amend. Compl. Ex. B; see also
Arrington Decl. ¶ 9 (describing the May 9, 2007 conference call with Plaintiff to discuss
narrowing its request). By letter dated June 8, 2007, the Department informed Plaintiff of the
requirement of prepayment of fees exceeding $250 and advised Plaintiff that the “broad scope of
your request would require significant time and resources to search for and review responsive
records.” Amend. Compl. Ex. F (Letter from Maria-Teresa Cueva to Daniel Roth (June 8,
2007)). Although Plaintiff was encouraged to narrow its request, Plaintiff failed to do so
sufficiently so that the Department could proceed with processing. See id.; see also Arrington
Decl. ¶ 19 (“As the request currently reads, it does not reasonably describe the records sought
and therefore, even upon resolution of the fee dispute, the Department cannot begin to search for
responsive records until the requester clarifies the request.”). Plaintiff’s FOIA request therefore
continues to remain in suspended status. See Amend Compl. Ex. B (“Once we receive your
clarification and the issues regarding charges are resolved, we will begin processing your
23

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 18

Filed 10/16/2007

request.”). As long as Plaintiff’s request remains in that status, the Department’s obligation to
produce responsive records is not triggered. Thus, Claim Four alleging that the Department
violated FOIA by failing to produce records, at best, is not ripe. This Court accordingly should
dismiss that claim as well.
III.

THIS COURT ALTERNATIVELY SHOULD DISMISS CLAIMS ONE
THROUGH FOUR OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO
STATE A CLAIM.
Even if this Court determines that it has jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s FRA claims and

FOIA claim alleging failure to produce records, dismissal is nevertheless warranted for failure to
state a claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure is warranted where the complaint’s allegations are insufficient to state or infer
a necessary element of a claim. See Wells v. United States, 851 F.2d 1471, 1473 (D.C. Cir. 1988)
(“Assuming all factual allegations are true, a court must dismiss a complaint if the plaintiff fails
to establish a right to relief based on the facts alleged in the complaint.”). As already
demonstrated, Plaintiff’s allegations are deficient in that respect as to all of its claims under the
FRA because the record is utterly devoid of facts permitting an inference of the Department’s
unlawful record-keeping practices – a necessary predicate for the Department’s alleged violation
and the Secretary and the Archivist’s enforcement obligations.
Plaintiff’s FOIA challenge to the Department’s failure to produce records is likewise
lacking a necessary predicate – the statutory obligation to produce records. As already discussed,
as long as the issue of fees is unresolved and Plaintiff refuses to sufficiently narrow its request,
the Department has no obligation to respond to that request. By regulation, such a request is
deemed “not received” and thus the Department “has no reason to search or produce records.”

Brunsilius, 2007 WL 2791709, at *4; 34 C.F.R. § 5.62(c); 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). Thus,
whether this Court analyzes Claims One through Four under Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, those claims cannot withstand dismissal.
