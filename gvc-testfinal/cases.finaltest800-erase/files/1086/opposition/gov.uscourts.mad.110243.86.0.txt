CIVIL ACTION NO: 07-11189-RGS

MEMORANDUM OF BIOCARE MEDICAL LLC IN OPPOSITION TO HARVARD’S
PARTIALLY ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO STAY AND COMPEL ARBITRATION
Defendant, Biocare Medical LLC (“Biocare”), hereby opposes the Motion to Compel
Arbitration brought by the President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”).
Introduction and Overview of Harvard’s Motion
This Court is fully familiar with the facts and stage of proceedings. Harvard’s position is
that the dispute between the parties is subject to the arbitration provision contained in the
Biological Materials License Agreement between Harvard and Biocare (the “Biocare License”).
Harvard calls the arbitration provision “mandatory” and states that the outcome to this case will
turn on the interpretation of certain provisions of the Biocare License. Harvard states that it (and
AsymmetRx) “anticipate” an argument that the Biocare License was not a patent license
permitting Biocare to sell p63 in the commercial diagnostic field. Harvard goes on to refer to
this Court’s Memorandum and Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, dated
September 29, 2008, for the proposition that this Court devoted most of its attention to the
interpretation of the Biocare License as between Biocare and Harvard and, therefore, not enough

to whether the license granted Biocare rights to the after-acquired patents. Harvard - - without
ever initiating a dispute of its own or ever even committing itself to an argument, now appears to
be taking issue with this Court’s ruling “that Biocare has satisfied its burden of demonstrating an
entitlement to an implied license under the [ ] patents.” (See footnote 15 to Memorandum and
Order on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment).1
The Arbitration Provision – Harvard’s Failure to Initiate Within a Reasonable Time
Section 7.11 of the Biocare License contains the subject Arbitration clause. It reads:
In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating
to any provision of this Agreement or the breach thereof, the
PARTIES shall try to settle such conflicts amicably between
themselves. Subject to the limitation stated in the final sentence of
this Section, any such conflict which the PARTIES are unable to
resolve shall be settled through arbitration conducted in accordance
with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
demand for arbitration shall be filed within a reasonable time after
the controversy or claim has arisen, and in no event after the date
upon which institution of legal proceedings based on such
controversy or claim would be barred by the applicable statute of
limitation. Such arbitration shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts.
The award through arbitration shall be final and binding. Either
PARTY may enter any such award in a court having jurisdiction or
may make application to such court for judicial acceptance of the
award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either PARTY may, without
recourse to arbitration, assert against the other PARTY a thirdparty claim or cross-claim in any action brought by a third party, to
which the subject matter of this Agreement may be relevant.
It is indisputable that Harvard has not initiated its “demand” for arbitration “within a
reasonable time after the controversy or claim” arose; indeed, far from it.

AsymmetRx’s

complaints to Harvard about the Harvard-Biocare License were first brought to Harvard’s
attention by AsymmetRx over seven (7) years ago; that fact is well-documented. That passage of

1

Biocare notes that not even in the newly-filed Amended Complaint has Harvard directly asserted an actionable
fact, a breach of the Biocare License Agreement, or any other independent claim for patent infringement. It is
essentially the same Complaint filed by AsymmetRx in June, 2007.

time is violative of any applicable statute of limitations, whether sounding in tort or in contract,
and therefore Harvard’s demand for arbitration is time-barred. The arbitration clause provides
that “in no event [shall the demand be made] after the date upon which institution of legal
proceedings based on such controversy or claim would be barred by the applicable statute of
limitation”.
The essence of arbitration is to arrive at a quick and final decision, such that the parties
can avoid the inherent cost and delays associated with litigation. Parties are to file a demand for
arbitration within “a reasonable time” so that they do not double-deal and use it as a strategy, as
here. In this case, Harvard has sat idly by for over seven (7) years while it has accepted royalty
payments from Biocare on sales of p63, without objection. While Biocare has absorbed untold
legal expense and business carrying costs, Harvard has quietly observed one outcome after
another.

Biocare has already suffered prejudice due to Harvard’s acquiescence, and now

Harvard has waived its right to demand arbitration.
Harvard’s Timeline of Delay
On September 22, 2003, nearly one year following execution of the Biocare License, the
inventors of p63 and founders of AsymmetRx wrote a letter to Prem Das, the Director of the
Office of Technology Licensing for Harvard Medical School, complaining of Dr. Henry
Oettinger’s involvement and lobbying for his removal from any further negotiations of a
licensing agreement between Harvard and AsymmetRx (the “Das letter”). Chief among their
complaints was their disagreement over his management of the intellectual property – the p63;
his negotiation of the Biocare License; and, his proposed offer to sell licenses to an additional
eighteen (18) vendors. It was following this Complaint that Dr. Oettinger attempted to persuade

Case 1:07-cv-11189-RGS Document 86

Filed 12/02/10 Page 4 of 7

Biocare to execute an amendment to the Biocare License. At least as of September 22, 2003,
over seven (7) years ago, Harvard was on notice of AsymmetRx’s dispute.
Next, over 4½ years ago, at a meeting on March 29, 2006 at the law offices of Goodwin
Proctor LLP, Harvard met with AsymmetRx to develop a strategy to defeat Biocare’s interests
under its License Agreement. Specifically, they met to discuss and devise ways to find Biocare
to be in breach of their license in ways other than selling the antibody outside the AsymmetRxdisputed field (e.g., insurance obligations or through an audit). Over one year later, on June 27,
2007, AsymmetRx filed its lawsuit. For 3½ years, from the Das letter through the filing of the
AsymmetRx Complaint, AsymmetRx pushed Harvard to terminate the Biocare License and
Harvard, for its part, reacted by quietly agreeing to various schemes.
On March 17, 2008, Biocare’s counsel wrote a letter to Isaac T. Kohlberg, Senior
Associate Provost and Chief Technology Development Officer at Harvard looking to invoke
Sections 7.4(a) and (b), the so-called cooperation clauses within the Biocare License from which
Biocare sought to review its own license file maintained by Harvard. (See Exhibit “A” counsel
letter.) Not until August 18, 2010, did Harvard ever mention or even refer to the Arbitration
clause - - over three (3) years after the lawsuit was filed and 2½ years following Biocare’s letter
to Mr. Kohlberg at Harvard. Even so, the mention of arbitration was not through the filing of a
demand but by a voicemail from Harvard’s counsel, wherein he states Harvard’s decision to
arbitrate was arrived at after discussion between Harvard and AsymmetRx; AsymmetRx not
even being a party to the Biocare License. (See Exhibit “B” hereto – Biocare’s response to
voicemail.) In sum, it has taken Harvard over seven (7) years to arrive at the decision to seek
arbitration, during which time it has never terminated the Biocare License; never declared

1278771v1

Case 1:07-cv-11189-RGS Document 86

Filed 12/02/10 Page 5 of 7

Biocare to be in breach; and never alleged Biocare to be infringing the very patents which are the
subject of this case.
Argument
Biocare believes that Harvard’s delay, alone, is dispositive of its Motion to Compel.
Moreover, given Harvard’s undeniable alliance with AsymmetRx throughout, and the fact that it
has closely monitored the AsymmetRx-Biocare litigation from point of filing, Harvard’s
participation to date is not unlike that of a silent litigant. Harvard has had the benefit of the
discovery, the arguments, the decisions and opinions, while giving up precious little of its own.
In Davis v. Continental Airlines, the California Court of Appeals for the Second District held
that the defendants had waived their right to arbitrate when they delayed their motion to compel
arbitration until after they had engaged in extensive discovery. 59 Cal. App. 4th 205 (1997). The
court indicated that a waiver may be found when a party seeking arbitration "has (1) previously
taken steps inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration, (2) unreasonably delayed in seeking
arbitration, or (3) acted in bad faith or with willful misconduct." Id. At 212. The court
concluded that a party waives its right to arbitrate when it uses discovery in judicial proceedings
to learn what a defendant’s likely strategy will be in arbitration: "[S]uch procedural
gamesmanship provides ample support for the trial judge's conclusion that plaintiffs filed their
action in bad faith, and by doing so waived their right to arbitrate", stating further that “[t]he
courtroom may not be used as convenient vestibule to the arbitration hall so as to allow a party to
create his own unique structure combining litigation and arbitration."

Id.

In reaching its

determination, the Davis court emphasized that Continental did nothing for six months to compel
arbitration. Id.

Conclusion
For all of the foregoing reasons, Biocare requests that this Court deny Harvard’s Motion
to Stay and to Compel Arbitration.
