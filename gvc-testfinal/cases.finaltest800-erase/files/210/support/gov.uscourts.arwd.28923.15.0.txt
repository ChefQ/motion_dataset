*all times are CDT

Itis undisputed that the Separate Defendants have not answered the Complaint nor
alleged any defenses provided by Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On
April 11, 2007, at 4:21 p.m. CDT, defense counsel Michael P. Turiello acknowledged by e-
mail to Plaintiffs' counsel that the answer in this case was due the following day, and stated

as follows:

 
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document15_ Filed 05/03/2007 Page 3of5

Jason-

| believe our answer is due in the Sims case tomorrow. Would you agree to

an order extending our time to answer otherwise plead? Let me know.

Thanks.

Mike

After an April 12, 2007 telephone conversation with defense counsel, Michael P.
Turiello, Plaintiffs' counsel responded by letter sent via facsimile at 1:44 p.m. and via e-
mail at 1:53 p.m. to Mr. Turiello and to Christy D. Comstock, as follows:

Dear Mike:

| enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding the answer that is due

today in the Sims v. Menu Foods litigation. Please be advised that | will

agree to give you a fourteen (14) day extension to file a responsive pleading.

If you decide to file a motion for an extension greater than that period of

time, please advise the Court in your motion that | had agreed to a fourteen

(14) day extension.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,

Jason M. Hatfield

Mr. Turiello rejected the offer of extension by e-mail dated April 12, 2007, as
follows:

Jason-

It was nice speaking with you as well. | will need more than 14 days so we

will be filing a motion to stay on behalf of the four served defendants. Please

let me know when you have worked your way through the Hague Convention

and served Menu Foods Income Fund. Thanks.

Mike

Separate Defendants did not answer or defend the Complaint, did not ask for an

extension, but instead filed their Motion to Stay on April 12, 2007 at 8:04 p.m. CDT
Case 5:07-cv-05053-JLH Document15_ Filed 05/03/2007 Page4of5

(Document #7) and their Separate Defendants' Brief in Support of Motion to Stay on April
12, 2007 at 8:06 p.m. CDT (Document #8), with exhibits being filed the following day
(Document #9).

A motion to stay does not satisfy the obligation to answer or extend the time to plead
under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, since a motion to stay is not a
motion listed under Rule 12 which will excuse the otherwise timely filing of an answer.
Thus, the time has run and the Separate Defendants are in default.

As noted by the Court's Order of May 2, 2007 (Document #13), "Plaintiffs counter
that... they should not be prevented from commencing discovery." The ruling of the Court
to "abide by the wisdom of Rule 1.5" accepts that 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 does not affect or suspend
orders and pretrial proceedings in the district court, thus requiring answers to be timely filed
and allowing discovery to commence at the district court level. Plaintiffs are severely
prejudiced in their attempt to proceed with discovery against any of the Defendants herein
due to the lack of a responsive pleading by any Defendant, thereby limiting Plaintiffs from
knowledge of what defenses will be alleged and what facts are in dispute.

Plaintiffs seek this Court's permission to obtain entry of default, as required by Rule
55 in an action against the Separate Defendants.
