1.

the Menu Foods Defendants (with the exception of Separate Defendant Menu Foods
Income Fund) on March 23, 2007.
2.

On April 12, 2007, the Menu Foods Defendants which had been served

filed a Motion to Stay seeking, inter alia, a stay of the proceedings pending a transfer
decision by the Judicial Panel on Multi District Litigation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1407
and pending a determination of class certification by the transferor court, including an
explicit request that the Court stay Defendants’ “obligation to timely respond to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint.”
3.

On April 18, 2007, Plaintiffs responded that Menu Foods’ Motion to

Stay should be denied and requested that the Court “order Defendants to answer
Plaintiffs’ Complaint.”
4.

On April 24, 2007, Defendant Menu Foods Income Fund entered its

appearance and Defendants filed their reply, providing the Court notice of the Judicial
Panel hearing on May 31, 2007.
5.

On April 27, 2007, Judge Dawson stayed the case of Widen, et al. v. Menu

Foods, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., et al., Civil No. 07-5055, and the undersigned counsel
proposed Agreed Orders of Stay, including preservation language, to Plaintiffs’
counsel in the above-captioned case, Sims, as well as to counsel in Gray, et al. v. Menu
Foods, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., et al., Civil No. 07-5065, pending before Judge Dawson in
the Fort Smith Division, and counsel in Cooper, et al. v. Menu Foods, Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc., et al., Civil No. 07-4036, pending before Judge Barnes in the Texarkana Division.

In addition to Widen, thirty-one (31) of the approximately seventy (70) cases
nationwide have been stayed pending outcome of the Judicial Panel hearing of the
Plaintiffs’ Motions for Multi-District Litigation; in many of the remaining cases,
Defendants either have not been served, or are in the process of negotiating stays or
extensions.
6.

On May 2, 2007, the Court entered its Order, denying Menu Foods’

Motion to Stay.
7.

One day later, on May 3, 2007, Plaintiffs filed their Rule 55 Motion for

Default Judgment, stating that the Menu Foods Separate Defendants “failed to file an
answer or otherwise defend in the current matter in a timely manner” as required on
April 12, 2007 and arguing that they “are entitled to a default against the Separate
Defendants.” It is unclear whether Plaintiffs are seeking a default judgment on behalf
of the named Plaintiffs or if they are seeking default judgment on behalf of
themselves as well as the uncertified class which they purportedly represent.
8.

Plaintiffs’ pleadings offer no legal citation in support of their argument

that the Motion to Stay, with its explicit request that the Court stay Defendants’
obligation to respond to the Plaintiffs’ complaint, was insufficient to toll Defendants’
deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint until such time as the Court ruled on the
Motion to Stay. Further, Plaintiffs’ bare contention that they have been “severely
prejudiced in their attempt to proceed with discovery . . . due to the lack of a
responsive pleading” is undermined by Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure which sets forth the time-table for first conferring, then making initial
disclosures and finally, engaging in discovery.

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default

Judgment is without merit.
9.

The Menu Foods Defendants respectfully request that Plaintiffs’ Motion

for Default Judgment be denied, and that Defendants’ Motion for Extension of Time
to Respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint be granted, and that Defendants be granted a
minimum of thirty (30) days to respond to Plaintiffs’ complaint, during which time
Defendants will, inter alia, move to consolidate each of the four (4) related Western
District of Arkansas cases – Sims, Gray, Widen and Cooper – into one proceeding;
pursue motions to stay in the remaining Western District of Arkansas cases, Gray and
Cooper, and seek reconsideration of the Court’s denial of the stay in this matter.
10.

If the Court deems necessary, the undersigned counsel desires to appear

before this Honorable Court to be heard on Defendants’ Motion for Extension of
Time and on Defendants’ response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default Judgment.
WHEREFORE, Defendants, MENU FOODS INCOME FUND, MENU
FOODS MIDWEST CORPORATION, MENU FOODS SOUTH DAKOTA,
INC., MENU FOODS, INC. and MENU FOODS HOLDINGS, INC., respectfully
request this Honorable Court enter an Order denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default
and an Order granting Defendants additional time of no less than thirty (30) days to
respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
