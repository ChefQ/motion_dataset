PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS'
MOTION TO DISMISS

Casey M. Price (`Plaintiff') files this response against the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss
and shows the Court as follows:

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

The Plaintiff was charged with Driving While Intoxicated in Cause No. 150,3045, styled
as State of Texas vs. Casey M. Price, in the County Criminal Court at Law No. 14 of Harris
County, Texas, before the Honorable Carolyn Marks Johnson ("Defendant Johnson"). The jury
in this case ultimately acquitted the Plaintiff and pronounced her as "not guilty." The Plaintiff
has brought the present complaint against Defendants for violation of 42 U.S.C.A. 0x00A7 1983,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring. (See Pl.'s Original Compl.)
Specifically, the Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Johnson illegally detained her and subjected her
to a non-warranted urinalysis after the jury had rendered a not guilty verdict thereby acquitting

her of all charges.

II. ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES

The Defendants, in their Motion to Dismiss, have purportedly alleged that the "causes of
action of the Plaintiff should be dismissed against Judge Johnson because of absolute judicial
immunity" and "[t]he causes of action against Harris County should be dismissed because Judge
Johnson was not an employee or policy maker for the County,' and more so, because the
Defendants allegedly "come within a waiver of sovereign immunity."

a. Defendant Johnson is not protected under the doctrine of absolute judicial

immunity.

As a general rule of law, the doctrine of judicial immunity protects judges from "every
action taken with regard to that function -whether good or bad, honest or dishonest, well-
intentioned or not- is immune from suit." B.K. v. Cox, 116 S.W.3d 351, 359 (Tex. App.--
Houston [14" Dist.] 2003, no pet). See also Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 547 (1967). Further,
the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity does not extend to the actions taken by a judge in the
clear absence of subject matter jurisdiction. However, at the same time, absolute judicial
immunity "extends to all judicial acts unless such acts fall clearly outside the judge's subject-
matter jurisdiction." Garza v. Morales, 923 S.W.2d 800, 802 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi,1996);
see also Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 98 S. Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978), Turner v.
Pruitt, 161 Tex. 532, 342 S.W.2d 422, 423 (1961); Bradt v. West, 892 S.W.2d 56, 66 (Tex. App.-
-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied); Spencer v. City of Seagoville, 700 S.W.2d 953, 957-58

(Tex. App.--Dallas 1985, no writ).

In Stump, the United States Supreme Court laid down relevant factors for the court to

consider when determining what constitutes a "judicial" act. Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349,
Case 4:09-cv-01966 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 3of9

98 S. Ct. 1099, 1107, 55 L.Ed.2d 331, 362 (1978). The factors explained in Stump are reflected
in Bradt and relied upon by the Defendants in their Motion to Dismiss. Relying on Brad?, the
Defendants argue that the Defendant Johnson is entitled to absolute judicial immunity.
However, the Bradt court outlined the following factors to be considered when determining
absolute judicial immunity. These factors are: "(1) whether the act complained of is one
normally performed by a judge, (2) whether the act occurred in the courtroom or an appropriate
adjunct such as the judge's chambers, (3) whether the controversy centered around a case
pending before the judge, and (4) whether the act arose out of a visit to the judge in his judicial
capacity." Bradt, 892 S.W.2d at 67; see also Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir.
1993); McAlester v. Brown, 469 F.2d 1280, 1282 (Sth Cir. 1972). The Defendants have
conveniently limited their reliance on Bradt, miserably failing to appreciate the Bradt court's
observation that "[i]n some circumstances" there can be immunity even though all the factors
enunciated may not be met. Bradt, 892 S.W.2d at 67 (citing Adams, 764 F.2d at 297, n.2.). The
Bradt court's observation that all facts need not "be given equal weight . . . rather, they should be
weighted according to the facts of the particular case" was conveniently ignored by the
Defendants. Id. See also Adams, 764 F.2d at 297, 298 (applying the first factor to analyze
whether "the issuance of a `show cause' order and citing for contempt are acts normally
performed by a judge" to determine absolute judicial immunity); Harris v. Francis, 2000 WL
175588, No. 05-99-00866-CV, at *3 (Tex. App.--Dallas, Feb 16, 2000) (applying the first factor
to analyze whether "granting of a request for a writ of attachment is an act normally performed
by a judge" to determine absolute judicial immunity); see also Erwin v. State, 729 S.W.2d 709,

714 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987); Ex parte Johnson, 654 S.W.2d 415, 422 (Tex. 1983); In re Lane,
Case 4:09-cv-01966 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page4of9

972 S.W.2d 920, 921 (Tex. App.--Beaumont 1998, no pet.) (applying the first factor to analyze

the judicial immunity similar to Harris).

Considering the factual circumstances of the foregoing authorities, the Court should
apply the first factor in Bradt to determine whether Judge Johnson is entitled to absolute
immunity because the alleged judicial action of Defendant Johnson in detaining and ordering the
Plaintiff to undergo a urinalysis test after the jury's acquittal is the primary issue leading to this
very litigation. Moreover, Defendant Johnson has failed to show any authority that her action is
normally performed by judges in Texas, or in any other jurisdiction within the United States.
There is no statute or case law in Texas that grants power to a judge to detain a plaintiff after a
not guilty jury verdict has been passed. This clearly establishes the non-judiciality of Defendant
Johnson's act and clearly bars Defendant Johnson from the protection given under the absolute

immunity doctrine.

Further, Curry v. Wilson, as cited by the Defendants, is clearly distinguishable from the
present case. In Curry, the acquitted defendant argued that the court had no jurisdiction to order
him to re-pay legal fees because the moment the court entered a judgment of acquittal in his case,
the court's jurisdiction was terminated. Curry v. Wilson, 853 S.W.2d 40, 44 (Tex. Crim. App.
1993). The Curry court held that the defendant was not entitled to relief because the court's
order was derived from a provision provided by a statute. Id. The Curry court further observed
that, "the trial court will not have authority to determine the issues which are present in the
indictment against the defendant/applicant because the jury had already returned a verdict of
not guilty against the defendant." (Emphasis added). Id at 45. The only reason the Curry court

allowed the post-verdict order was because it's decision was substantiated by the Code of
Case 4:09-cv-01966 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 5of9

Criminal Procedure. In the present case, Defendant Johnson detained the Plaintiff after the jury
rendered their not guilty verdict and acquitting the Plaintiff of all charges. Defendant Johnson
had no authority, statutory or otherwise, to interfere with the jury's judgment and detain the
Plaintiff. See United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 573, 97 S. Ct. 1349, 1355
(1977) (observing that "[a] trial judge is [] barred from attempting to override or interfere with
the jurors' independent judgment in a manner contrary to the interests of the accused"). It is
therefore clearly established that Defendant Johnson's acts of detaining the Plaintiff and
subjecting her to a urinalysis are non-judicial and that Defendant Johnson is not entitled to

absolute judicial immunity.

b. Defendant Harris County is liable to Plaintiff because of its official policies.

Defendant Harris County attempts to dispose of Plaintiff's 0x00A7 1983 claim by arguing that
Defendant Johnson is not an official policymaker for Defendant Harris County. This argument

fails to appreciate the true import of Plaintiffs allegations.

First, Plaintiff's Complaint is not alleging that Judge Johnson's actions, alone, violated
Plaintiffs constitutional rights. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that several court officials, including the
prosecutor, the sheriff, and the court's staff all allowed this constitutional violation to occur
because of a failure to adequately train and supervise and because of deficient policies and
procedures in Harris County to address such violations. (See Complaint 4-5.) A closer reading
of the Complaint renders Defendants' arguments as to Harris County's liability completely

trelevant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the case law actually supports Plaintiff, not Defendants.

Plaintiff's pleadings are, therefore, sufficient to survive an attack under Rule 12(b)(6).
Case 4:09-cv-01966 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 6of9

Defendants cite several cases in support of their argument, namely, Johnson v. Moore, 958 F.2d
92, 94 (5"0x2122 Cir. 1992), Krueger v. Reimer, 66 F.3d 75, 76 (5" Cir. 1995), and Davis v. Tarrant
County, 565 F.3d 214 6" Cir. 2009). Johnson and Davis are distinguishable, however, in that
the judges involved were solely responsible for the unconstitutional conduct. See Johnson, 958
F.2d at 93-94 (noting that the judge denied the plaintiff right to counsel and that plaintiff alleged
that the judge was the ultimate policymaker for the governmental entity); Davis, 565 F.3d at 216-
17 (involving state district judges denying an attorney's application to be included in court
appointments). In the present case, several state actors were responsible including the judge, the

sheriff's office, and the court staff.

Defendants' reliance on Krueger is also misplaced. In Krueger, the court held that the
judge and prosecutor were immune because they were acting in their official capacities and that
the county was not liable because a "local judge acting in his or her judicial capacity is not
considered a local government official whose acts are attributable to the county." Krueger, 66
F.3d at 76-77 (emphasis added). The present case is very different. The state actors involved in
violating Plaintiff's constitutional rights were acting under color of state law but were not acting
within the confines of their authority because Plaintiff was declared innocent by a jury. She was
legally free to leave the courthouse but was unlawfully detained, in contravention of her
constitutional rights. Judge Johnson was not acting in her judicial capacity. She abused her

authority and was supported by several other state actors when doing so.

Plaintiff has found case law that is more factually applicable to this case. In Ambrose v.
City of New York, the plaintiff alleged that the municipal defendant had failed to adequately train
and supervise its law enforcement personnel as to interview techniques and exculpatory

evidence. Ambrose v. City of New York, Case No. 02-CV-10200 (KMK), 2009 WL 890106 at *1

6
Case 4:09-cv-01966 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page7of9

(S.D.N.Y. March 31, 2009). Such pleading was held to be sufficient under Rule 12(b)(6). Jd. at
*20-21. Although Ambrose is not a case from within the Fifth Circuit, it serves to remind the
Defendants that the key inquiry at this stage is whether Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a case
against Defendant Harris County. Plaintiff has specifically alleged that the county's policies and
procedures failed to prevent the conduct that gave rise to violations of Plaintiff's constitutional
rights. (Complaint 5.) Hence, Defendants have failed to make a successful argument under Rule

12(b)(6) as to Plaintiffs 0x00A7 1983 claim against Defendant Harris County.

Alternatively, even if the Court determines that more specific pleading is required,
Plaintiff requests that the Court grant Plaintiff leave to amend her Complaint within 30 days after

any such order by the Court.

Cc. Defendants' negligent hiring arguments fail to take federal law into account.

Defendants attempt to confuse the issues when they argue that Plaintiff's negligent hiring
claim fails under Rule 12(b)(6). Defendants premise their arguments under the Texas Tort
Claims Act. What Defendants fail to recognize, however, is that a federal basis exists by which
Defendant Harris County can be held liable. See Monell v. Dept. of Social Svcs., 436 U.S. 658,
98 S.Ct. 2018 (1978). Monell recognizes a claim against a local government if that local
government's "custom" caused a plaintiff's constitutional violations. /d. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at
2035-36. In Ambrose, the court denied a motion to dismiss where the plaintiff had alleged that
the municipality engaged in negligent hiring and supervision and, thereby, violated Monell.
Ambrose, 2009 WL 890106 at *19-21. In the present case, the Plaintiff has alleged that

3 ce.

Defendant Harris County's "policies and procedures" - i.e., customs - caused the state actors at

issue to be completely unprepared to protect Plaintiff's constitutional rights. The Texas Tort
Case 4:09-cv-01966 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 08/04/2009 Page 8of9

Claims Act in inapplicable. Federal law still holds Defendant Harris County accountable for its

failures.

Alternatively, even if the Court determines that more specific pleading is required,
Plaintiff requests that the Court grant Plaintiff leave to amend her Complaint within 30 days after

any such order by the Court.

III. CONCLUSION

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Plaintiff prays that the Defendants

Motion to Dismiss be DENIED.
