DATA SECURITY BREACH
LITIGATION

I.

OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
FOR CERTIFICATION UNDER
28 U.S.C.A. § 1292(B)

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This Court stayed litigation in the judicial forum and directed Plaintiffs to proceed

individually in arbitration. Plaintiffs in the Bercaw-Miller-Shaver Group (“Moving Plaintiffs”)
now seek an interlocutory review of this Court’s Order. Normally, no interlocutory review is
provided for an Order staying an action and compelling arbitration. Congress, in crafting the
Federal Arbitration Act, took special care to protect such orders from interlocutory review except
in narrow circumstances. 9 U.S.C.A. §16(b)(1)-(2) states that:
Except as otherwise provided in section 1292(b) of title 28, an appeal may not be
taken from an interlocutory order--(1) granting a stay of any action under section
3 of this title; [or] (2) directing arbitration to proceed under section 4 of this title.
Section 16(b) “reflects a deliberate determination that appeal rules should reflect a strong policy
favoring arbitration.” 15B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris.2d § 3914.17.
Therefore, Moving Plaintiffs could only petition the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals for
review if this Court were to certify the opinion under 28 U.S.C.A. §1292(b). See, e.g., In re
Pisgah Contractors, Inc., 117 F.3d 133, 137 (4th Cir. 1997). Faced with a similar motion to
certify a recent order compelling arbitration, Judge Reidinger concluded:
This provision “was not intended to allow interlocutory appeal in ordinary suits,”
or “as a vehicle to provide early review of difficult rulings in hard cases.” Rather,
section 1292(b) “is limited to extraordinary cases where early appellate review
might avoid protracted and expensive litigation.” Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

Document 33

Filed 04/02/2009

Page 1 of 14

has noted that section 1292(b) “should be used sparingly and ... its requirements
must be strictly construed.”
Stephens v. Wachovia Bank, 2008 WL 1820928, *4 (W.D.N.C.) (citations omitted).
For Moving Plaintiffs to obtain section 1292(b) interlocutory review, the Court would
have to modify its prior Order to say that the opinion “[1] involves a controlling question of law
as to which there is [2] substantial ground for difference of opinion and [3] that an immediate
appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation[.]” 28
U.S.C.A. §1292(b) (emphasis added) “Because section 1292(b) should be used sparingly, its
requirements should be strictly construed.” American Stainless & Supply, LLC v. All Points
Capital Corp., 2009 WL 82469 at *2 (M.D.N.C.).

The “appellant must demonstrate that

exceptional circumstances justify a departure from the basic policy of postponing appellate
review until after the entry of a final judgment.”

In re Poor, 2008 WL 3925268 at *2

(W.D.N.C.)(quotation marks and citation omitted)(denying certification).
In summary, as detailed subsequently in this memorandum, Plaintiffs’ request to certify
the Court’s ruling fails to satisfy any of the three section 1292(b) requirements—much less all of
them, as is required. First, Moving Plaintiffs fail to identify a “controlling question of law” on
which to base their motion. As the procedural history of this matter shows, the Court found the
LendingTree Terms of Use enforceable, under both California and North Carolina law, based on
detailed factual findings. As demonstrated below, these rulings of enforceability did not hinge
on a controlling question of law – or, as one court has termed it, on “narrow question[s] of pure
law.” In re Charlotte Commercial Group, Inc., 2003 WL 1790882 at *3 (M.D.N.C.).
Second, Moving Plaintiffs fail to show any “substantial ground for difference of opinion”
on the pertinent issues of law. They claim that the Court’s rulings as to unconscionability and
State interest are at odds with how a California court would have decided the matter. As shown

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

Document 33

Filed 04/02/2009

Page 2 of 14

below, however, the California case law that Moving Plaintiffs contend shows a difference of
opinion on the substantive issue of unconscionability is inapposite. On the separate choice of
law issue—California’s interest in application of its law rather than North Carolina law—
Moving Plaintiffs do not cite to any case law as at odds with this Court’s decision.
Third, Moving Plaintiffs fail to show “that an immediate appeal from the order may
materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” Moving Plaintiffs argue that the
Court will suffer waste and delay adjudicating claims against non-LendingTree Defendants while
proceedings against LendingTree are in arbitration. Moving Plaintiffs are wrong as a practical
matter, as Moving Plaintiffs have already obtained defaults against all but one of the nonLendingTree Defendants, and that Defendant has failed to answer. And, as a legal matter, courts
across the country have rejected the idea that binding arbitration agreements should be set aside
over “split-forum” concerns.
Each failure of Moving Plaintiffs to satisfy an element of Section 1292(b) is an
independently sufficient reason to deny the current Motion.
II.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A.
The Court Stayed the Spinozzi, Mitchell, and Carson Cases and Compelled
Individual Arbitration
The first time that this Court upheld LendingTree’s Terms of Use against charges of
unconscionability was August 21, 2008. The Court stayed Spinozzi, Mitchell, and Carson and
compelled each case to individual arbitration. See Exhibit A, August 21, 2008 Transcript of this
Court’s Ruling (“1T”).
The Court found that the LendingTree Terms of Use constituted a valid, binding, and
enforceable contract. The Court’s pivotal factual finding was as follows:

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

3
Document 33

Filed 04/02/2009

Page 3 of 14

Both parties in this case indicated assent to the terms of use…LendingTree by
providing the website and the terms and plaintiffs by affirm[atively] checking the
box stating that they agreed to those terms.
[Id. at 1T54:13-16.]
The Court found that there were “no facts indicating unfair surprise,” 1T58:14-15, that
“plaintiffs were able to peruse LendingTree’s website at their leisure,” 1T58:19-20, that plaintiffs
had a duty to read before they accepted the Terms of Use, 1T58:21-59-20, and that “Plaintiffs
have not demonstrated a lack of meaningful choice,” as LendingTree “has a number of major
competitors, any of which were just as available to Plaintiffs,” 1T59:21-24.
Based on these facts, the Court stayed the actions and compelled individual arbitration.
To date, these Plaintiffs have not filed for arbitration.
B.
The Court Stayed the Shaver, Miller, Garcia, Bradley, and Bercaw Cases and
Compelled Individual Arbitration
Subsequently, all the remaining LendingTree cases venued outside North Carolina were
transferred to this Court for consistent pre-trial treatment. The Court heard LendingTree’s
second Motion to Stay and Compel Arbitration on February 5, 2009. See, Exhibit B, February 5,
2009 Transcript of this Court’s Ruling (“2T”). The Court granted LendingTree’s Motion.
Plaintiffs challenged the North Carolina choice of law provision in LendingTree’s Terms
of Use. In relevant part, under the Restatement, the parties’ choice of law provision will be
upheld unless “application of the chosen law would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a
State which has a greater material interest that the chosen law[.]” 2T4:17-24.
Far from being “contrary to a fundamental policy” of California law, the Court found that
LendingTree’s Terms of Use would be upheld under California law. 2T5:13-19, citing Discover
Bank v. Superior Court, 30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76 (Cal. 2005)(applying a three-part test to determine
whether a contract is substantively unconscionable). While the Terms of Use constituted a

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

4
Document 33

Filed 04/02/2009

Page 4 of 14

consumer contract of adhesion (Discover Bank’s first factor), the amounts in controversy under
the Terms of Use were not “predictably small,” (the second factor) and Plaintiffs had not ever
alleged a scheme on LendingTree’s part to cheat its customers (the third factor). 2T5:-7.
The Court further found that North Carolina law—not California law---controls. “Even if
the class action waiver were unconscionable and did violate a fundamental policy of California,
it is abundantly clear to this Court that California’s interest in this litigation is not materially
greater than North Carolina’s.” 2T8:11-13 (emphasis added). “Most significantly, none of the
Plaintiffs are California residents.” 2T8:21-22. The Court also noted that the alleged California
corporate defendants have never appeared, that “[i]t is clear that LendingTree is the key
defendant, and that LendingTree is based in North Carolina,” and that Plaintiffs’ predominant
claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act focused on how LendingTree protected consumer
information housed in North Carolina. 2T9:2-3, 2T9:13-16.
Accordingly, “the Court must enforce the parties’ choice of North Carolina law.”
2T9:23-25.

The Court then upheld the Terms of Use under North Carolina’s law of

unconscionability. As in its August 21 ruling, the Court found that the LendingTree agreement
was not procedurally unconscionable, noting as a matter of fact that “there was no unfair
surprise” and “no lack of meaningful choice” 2T11:4-14. The Court stayed the action and
compelled individual arbitration.

Plaintiffs, including Moving Plaintiffs, have not filed for

arbitration.

III.

LEGAL ARGUMENT

A.

Moving Plaintiffs Articulate No Controlling Question of Law

1.

The Substantive Unconscionability “Question”
Certification under 28 U.S.C.A. §1292(b) is reserved for “narrow question[s] of pure

law.” In re Charlotte Commercial Group, Inc., 2003 WL 1790882 at *2 (M.D.N.C.). Yet
Moving Plaintiffs allege as error only rulings of mixed fact and law.
Moving Plaintiffs claim that the Court misapplied Discover Bank, erroneously requiring
Moving Plaintiffs to satisfy every factor cited by the California Supreme Court.

Moving

Plaintiffs are mistaken. Rather, the Court correctly applied California law to a series of facts
which would not result in a finding of unconscionability under Discover Bank or under any other
California precedent.1
In the sole point of fact which the Court decided in favor of Moving Plaintiffs, the Court
found that “the agreement is a consumer contract of adhesion drafted by the party that has a
superior bargaining power or powers.” 2T5:21-23. But Moving Plaintiffs point to nothing in
Discover Bank or its progeny that would suggest a class action waiver in a consumer contract of
adhesion is per se invalid. To the contrary, Discover Bank held only that “at least some class
action waivers in consumer contracts are unconscionable under California law,” that “adhesive
contracts are generally enforced,” and that “[c]lass action and arbitration waivers are not, in the
abstract, exculpatory clauses.” Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th at 160 (emphasis added).

1

To

Moreover, the correct application of California law is effectively moot unless the Court
also erred in concluding that the Restatement formula requires application of North Carolina law.
Otherwise, California law on these issues is of only academic interest and cannot provide a basis
for section 1292(b) certification.

determine whether a particular clause is or is not exculpatory requires an examination of all
circumstances, something the Court here undertook.
It is clearly a question of fact whether the amounts in dispute under the Terms of Use
would be predictably small, so as to weigh in favor of unconscionability under the second factor
of the Discover Bank test. The Court found, as a matter of fact, that the amounts were not so
predictably small. Likewise, it is a question of fact whether Moving Plaintiffs had alleged a
scheme whereby LendingTree would defraud its consumers by making use of the arbitration
provision, per the third factor of Discover Bank. As a matter of fact, the Court found Moving
Plaintiffs had not so alleged. Paradoxically, Moving Plaintiffs themselves concede that they
cannot reargue these points “given the limited scope of a §1292(b) petition.” PB, p.8 n.4. Yet
these factual findings, which Moving Plaintiffs admit they cannot challenge, amply support the
Court’s decision under California law.
Moving Plaintiffs further suggest that they were not given the benefit of a “sliding scale”
approach to unconscionability, under which “the more substantively oppressive the contract
term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that
the term is unenforceable[.]” PB, p. 5 n.3. Moving Plaintiffs ignore the fact that the Court found
none of the Terms of Use substantively oppressive and found no indications of procedural
unconscionability, noting only that this, like most consumer contracts, is a form contract. On
any scale, sliding or not, Moving Plaintiffs fail.
2.

The ‘Materially Greater Interest’ “Question”
As this Court found, an independently-sufficient reason to uphold the Terms of Use’s

choice of North Carolina law is that “it is abundantly clear to this Court that California’s interest
in this litigation is not materially greater than North Carolina’s.” 2T8:11-13. Even if the Terms

Page 7 of 14

of Use were unconscionable under California law (and, as the Court correctly concluded, they
are not), California has too attenuated a connection to this matter for its public policy to trump
clear contract terms.
This, again, is not a narrow question of pure law. Rather, the Court’s ruling was
grounded in factual findings with respect to the domicile of the parties and the place of the
wrong. Moving Plaintiffs disagree with the factual finding that the domicile of the relevant
parties is North Carolina. Moving Plaintiffs disagree with the factual finding that the alleged
conduct put at issue by the Complaints would have had a focus in North Carolina. These mere
disagreements are not issues of law certifiable to the Fourth Circuit.
B.

Moving Plaintiffs Present No Grounds for a Substantial Difference of Opinion

1.

The Substantive Unconscionability “Question”
Moving Plaintiffs claim there are grounds for substantial difference of opinion under

California law as to whether LendingTree’s Terms of Use are substantively unconscionable.
Moving Plaintiffs do not support this allegation.
Moving Plaintiffs do not cite to any California case, federal or State, in which a class
action waiver was stricken solely because it was contained in a contract of adhesion. In America
Online v. Superior Court, the class action waiver was stricken because plaintiffs, California
residents, had made claims under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. That California statute
contains a provision which prevents the waiver of the right to bring CLRA claims in a class
action format. “California courts will refuse to defer to the selected forum if to do so would
substantially diminish the rights of California residents in a way that violates our state’s public
policy.” 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 12 (Cal. App. 1st Dist. 2001)(emphasis added). Not one of
Plaintiffs is a California resident or has brought a CLRA claim. Accord, Shroyer v. New

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

Document 33

Page 8 of 14

Cingular Wireless Servs., 498 F.3d 976, 979 (9th Cir. Cal. 2007)(alleging violations of the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act).
In Szetela v. Discover Bank, at issue was not just a consumer contract of adhesion, but a
bill stuffer amendment to a credit card agreement. 97 Cal. App. 4th 1094 (Cal. App. 4th Dist.
2002). LendingTree did not hide its arbitration clause; as this Court has twice found, each
consumer had to affirmatively agree to a conspicuously-disclosed arbitration clause to use
LendingTree’s services. In Szetela, the consumer’s “only option, if he did not wish to accept the
amendment, was to close his account.” Id. at 1100. LendingTree did not put any pressure on
any of the Plaintiffs to agree to arbitration, did not threaten to sever any existing relationship. In
Szetela, the arbitration provision “provides the customer with no benefit whatsoever.” Id. at
1101.

Here, LendingTree could not offer the free service Moving Plaintiffs enjoyed (and

affirmatively sought out) without some means to manage litigation costs. Szetela is not apposite.
None of these cases indicates “grounds for substantial difference of opinion” from the
Court’s ruling that a class action waiver in a contract of adhesion, alone, does not
unconscionability make, even under California law.
2.

The ‘Materially Greater Interest’ “Question”
Moving Plaintiffs contend there are grounds for substantial difference of opinion under

California law as to whether California had a materially greater interest in application of its
policies than does North Carolina. With respect to this second non-question “question,” Moving
Plaintiffs do not cite to a single authority which disagrees with the Court’s approach. Moving
Plaintiffs do not cite any authority for their suggestion that mere equipoise between the interests
of the States (which no one has found) should be resolved in favor of voiding an otherwise
binding choice of law provision.

C.
Moving Plaintiffs Do Not Show How Immediate Appeal Would Advance the
Termination of the Litigation
Moving Plaintiffs suggest that decisions to stay and compel arbitration are uniquely wellsuited for certification under §1292(b).

Contrary to the contention of Moving Plaintiffs,

§1292(b) certification has been denied routinely with respect to orders compelling a stay and
arbitration. See, e.g., Stephens v. Wachovia Corp., 2008 WL 1820928 at *4 (W.D.N.C.).
Without an appeal, Plaintiff will proceed to arbitration for what should be a
relatively direct and concise proceeding pertaining only to her account. Once
arbitration is completed, this litigation will essentially be over, with the exception
of confirming the award, if that is applicable. If the Court allowed this
interlocutory appeal to proceed, the case would have to work its way through the
appellate process before the parties could proceed to arbitration, and ultimately, to
the conclusion of this litigation. Thus, certifying an interlocutory appeal on the
narrow issue pertaining to the class action waiver only would delay the resolution
of this case.
[Id.]
Accord, In Re: American Marine Holding Co., 14 F.3d 276 (5th Cir. 1994).
Moving Plaintiffs claim that the Court will waste time if this matter is pursued in two
forums: arbitration (as to LendingTree) and litigation (as to all other Defendants). Given that
Plaintiffs have already obtained defaults against all but one of the non-LendingTree Defendants
and the remaining one has failed to appear, it is unclear what, if anything, is left for the Court to
do. (Indeed, Plaintiffs took no action to default these defendants until the Court prompted them
to do so at the hearing on the motion to compel.) Moreover, courts have roundly rejected the
argument that an arbitration agreement should be voided simply because it does not encompass
all potential claims against all potential parties. See, e.g., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,
470 U.S. 213, 221 (1985)(“The preeminent concern of Congress in passing the [Federal
Arbitration] Act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered, and that
concern requires that we enforce agreements to arbitrate, even if the result is ‘piecemeal’

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

litigation”); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 1
(1983)(same); Salley v. Option One Mortg. Corp., 246 Fed. Appx. 87, 90 (3d Cir. 2007)(“the
reservation of foreclosure and other in rem remedies does not, as a matter of law, render the
Agreement substantively unconscionable”). It would be incongruous to certify this case for
appeal on the basis of an argument that has been so thoroughly discredited as contrary to the
aims of the Federal Arbitration Act.
Lastly, Moving Plaintiffs represent only three of the eight cases consolidated before this
Court for consistent pre-trial treatment. Granting this Motion would put these eight cases on
inconsistent tracks, as three cases would be seeking interlocutory review while five would not.
The result would be further delay.
The delay at hand is not caused by arbitration, but by Moving Plaintiffs’ refusal to
arbitrate. Even after the Court’s Order, Moving Plaintiffs have not filed for individual arbitration
in accordance with the Terms of Use. Granting Moving Plaintiffs the right to petition the Fourth
Circuit for interlocutory review would only further compound the delay Moving Plaintiffs have
caused.
IV.

CONCLUSION
In this motion to certify, Moving Plaintiffs face a very heavy burden. They must show

that both the Court’s decision that the parties’ selection of North Carolina law and the Court’s
decision that, even under California law, the Terms of Use are enforceable present controlling
questions of law. They must also show that a substantial difference of opinion exists as to both
of these issues. Finally, they must also show that an interlocutory appeal of these issues would
materially advance the termination of this litigation. Plaintiffs do not establish any of these

points, and certainly not all of them. For all of these reasons, Moving Plaintiffs’ Motion to
certify this case for interlocutory appeal should be denied.
