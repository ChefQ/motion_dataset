THE BERCAW-MILLER-SHAVER GROUP PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM
OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR CERTIFICATION FOR
APPEAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)
INTRODUCTION
Following extensive briefing by the parties and a hearing, the Court ruled from
the bench on February 5, 2009 that Plaintiffs were required to arbitrate all claims raised
against Lending Tree in the Consolidated Amended Class Complaint. See Transcript, p.
75, attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In reaching this decision, the Court found that the
Lending Tree forum selection clause, which contained a class action waiver provision,
was not unconscionable under California law, and that California does not have a
materially greater interest in this litigation than North Carolina. See Transcript, pp. 6771. Plaintiffs, of course, disagree with these rulings. Plaintiffs respectfully submit that
both of these rulings are subject to substantial disagreement by California courts and
other federal courts applying California law, as discussed below, and that immediate
appeal should be permitted so that the Fourth Circuit can resolve the issues.
ARGUMENT
I.

Standards for Certification Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)
28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) provides an avenue for interlocutory appeal from a non-final

order, either on a court’s own initiative or pursuant to a request for certification by a

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

party. The standards governing a court’s decision to certify a legal issue or ruling for
immediate appeal are set forth in the statute itself:
When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not
otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that
such order involves a controlling question of law as to which
there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an
immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the
ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing
in such order. The Court of Appeals which would have
jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may thereupon, in its
discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if
application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order.
28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) (emphasis added).
The rationale for certification of a non-final order for immediate appeal, and the
considerations to be applied to a decision to certify, were discussed at length in Howes v.
W.R. Peele, Sr. Trust, 889 F.Supp 849 (E.D.N.C. 1995) (Britt, J.):
The purpose of § 1292(b) is to allow for an early appeal of an order
when appellate-level resolution of issues addressed by that order
may provide more efficient disposition of the litigation. Ford
Motor Credit Co. v. S.E. Barnhart & Sons, Inc., 664 F.2d 377, 380
(3d Cir.1981). . . . [T]he application of the statute in practice is not
straightforward because of the great flexibility it provides to a
district court in deciding whether to certify an order for appeal.
This decision of whether to certify is wholly within the discretion
of the court issuing that order. Graves v. C & S Nat'l Bank of Ga.,
491 F.Supp. 280, 283 (D.S.C.1980) (citing Bachowski v. Usery,
545 F.2d 363, 368 (3d Cir.1976)). In deciding whether to certify an
order for interlocutory appeal, courts employ the two-prong test
established by the language of § 1292(b). North Carolina ex rel.
Long v. Alexander & Alexander Servs., Inc., 685 F.Supp. 114, 115
(E.D.N.C.1988).
*
*
*
The question of what constitutes a “controlling question of law”
has given courts somewhat more difficulty because the courts have
devised no set formula for making such a determination and, as a
result, this criterion tends to blend with the second prong of the test
for certification, which speaks to the potential for materially
advancing the litigation. 16 Wright, et al., Federal Practice and
Procedure § 3930, at 159. At the very least, a question is

controlling if its incorrect disposition would require reversal of a
final judgment for further proceedings. Id. (citing Katz v. Carte
Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, 755 (3d Cir.1974)).
Id. at 851-53.
Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the Court’s February 5, 2009 ruling, requiring
Plaintiffs to arbitrate all pending claims against Lending Tree, meets the standards for
certification, and that the particular facts of this case make certification of the Court’s
arbitration ruling especially appropriate.
II.

The Court’s Ruling Granting a Stay and Requiring Plaintiffs to Arbitrate
Their Claims Against Lending Tree Involves a Controlling Question of Law
for Which There is a Substantial Ground for Difference of Opinion
A.

The Ruling Involves a Controlling Question of Law

While there is no set formula for determining when a question of law is
controlling for the purposes of § 1292(b), it has been widely accepted that a question is
controlling “if its incorrect disposition would require reversal of the final judgment for
further proceedings.” Howes, 889 F. Supp. at 852-853, citing 16 Wright, et. al., Federal
Practice and Procedure § 3930, and Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, 755 (3rd
Cir. 1974). “A controlling question of law, for Section 1292(b) purposes, is ‘every order
which, if erroneous, would be reversible error on final appeal.’ It is not required that
reversal of the order terminate the litigation or that the order be on the claim’s merits.
‘Controlling’ means ‘serious to the conduct of the litigation, either practically or legally.’
From the practical standpoint, saving the district court’s time and the litigant’s expenses
is a ‘highly relevant factor.’” Norvergence, Inc. v. Nortel Networks, Ltd., 2008 WL
5136842, at *2 (D.N.J., Dec. 5, 2008) (slip copy) (citing Katz, supra).

It has previously been held that an order compelling arbitration is controlling, and
thus, subject to § 1292(b) certification, because it effectively transfers the case to another
forum for resolution. See Vimar Seguros Y Reaseguros v. M/V Sky Reefer, 1993 WL
137483, at *5 (D. Mass. 1993) (“In this case, the Order [compelling arbitration] should be
regarded as ‘controlling’ because it requires the dispute to be referred to another tribunal
for decision.”), aff’d (on certified appeal), 29 F.3d 727 (1st Cir. 1994), aff’d, 515 U.S.
528, 115 S.Ct. 2322 (1995). See generally Kuehner v. Dickenson & Co., 84 F.3d 316,
318 (9th Cir. 1996) (order compelling arbitration and staying case certified for immediate
appeal by district court, and appeal accepted by circuit court of appeals); cf. Johnson v.
Circuit City Stores, 148 F.3d 373, 376 (4th Cir. 1998) (order denying motion to compel
arbitration certified by district court, and appeal accepted by circuit court).
The Court’s February 5, 2009 ruling, granting Lending Tree’s motion to stay and
to compel arbitration, plainly meets the ‘controlling decision’ standard. As a result of the
Court’s decision, Plaintiffs must now – collectively or individually – prosecute their
claims against Lending Tree in an entirely different forum (arbitration), subject to the
Court’s review of any arbitration award(s) that result.1

Plaintiffs would then have to

arbitrate their claims, then challenge the initial ruling sending their claims to arbitration
on plenary appeal, and if successful, the results of the arbitration would be thrown out,
and pre-trial proceedings against Lending Tree would commence anew in this Court.
Stated otherwise, if the Court’s arbitration ruling was an “incorrect disposition,”
as Plaintiffs maintain it was, reversal of the ultimate final judgment and remand for
further proceedings would be required, making this a classic case for interlocutory review
1

See generally, ATAC Corp. v. Arthur Treachers, Inc., 280 F.3d 1091, 1097-98 (6th Cir. 2002) (arbitration
order staying proceedings and administratively closing case was not sufficiently final given that case was
subject to re-opening when arbitration was completed, to permit court review of arbitration awards).

under § 1292. See supra Howes; Katz; Norvergence. See also 16 Wright, et. al., Federal
Practice and Procedure § 3930 (“The advantages of immediate appeal increase with the
probabilities of prompt reversal, the length of the district court proceedings saved by
reversal of an erroneous ruling, and the substantiality of the burdens imposed on the
parties by a wrong ruling.”).
B.

There is a Substantial Ground for Disagreement Regarding the Arbitration
Ruling

In deciding that the Lending Tree arbitration clause is enforceable here, the Court
made two key findings: 1) that the clause did not contravene California public policy; that
is, the clause was not unconscionable under California law; and 2) California does not
have a materially greater interest in this litigation than North Carolina. See Transcript,
pp. 67-71. Plaintiffs respectfully submit that there is substantial ground for disagreement
as to both of these findings, as California decisional law strongly suggests that these
issues likely would be decided differently by a California court or another federal court
applying California law.
1

The Substantive Unconscionability Question

On the unconsionability issue, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to establish all
three aspects of what it described as the “three-part test” under Discover Bank2 for
substantive unconscionability in California. See Transcript, pp. 67-70.3 This ruling

2

Discover Bank v. Superior Court, 30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76 (Cal. 2005).
As discussed in the prior briefing, California courts apply a “sliding scale” as between procedural and
substantive unconscionability, such that a strong showing of procedural unconscionability greatly reduces a
party’s need to further show substantive unconscionability. Plaintiffs’ Opposition, p. 11. See Shroyer v.
New Cingular Wireless, Inc., 498 F.3d 976, 981-982 (9th Cir. 2007) (“California courts apply a ‘sliding
scale,’ so that the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural
unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.”);
Szetela v. Discover Bank, 97 Cal. App.4th 1094, 1099-1100 (Cal. Ct. App. 4th 2002) (“[T]he more
substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to
come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.”). Plaintiffs’ burden regarding

deviates substantially from several prior cases decided under California law, which were
cited in Plaintiffs’ memorandum. Specifically, it is established law in California that a
party need not meet all three of the criteria for substantive unconscionability to make a
forum selection clause unenforceable, and, in fact, it has previously been held that
satisfaction of only one of the three can be sufficient. Because there is no requirement
that all three parts of the Discover Bank “test” be met for substantive unconscionability to
be established, the Court’s contrary holding raises a substantial ground for disagreement
as to this aspect of the Court’s arbitration decision.
“[T]here are most certainly circumstances in which a class action waiver is
unconscionable under California law despite the fact that all three parts of the
Discover Bank test are not satisfied[.]” Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless, 498 F.3d at
983 (emphasis added). The Shroyer decision is consistent with the holdings of California
state courts which have likewise held that satisfaction of a single substantive criteria can
be sufficient to preclude enforcement of a forum selection clause. For example, in
America Online, Inc. v. Superior Court, 90 Cal.App.4th 1, (Cal. Ct. App.2d 2001), citing
the importance of consumer class action jurisprudence in consumer actions involving
relatively small amounts of money, the court found that inclusion of a class action waiver
in a forum selection clause is, by itself, grounds to refuse to enforce the clause based on
unconscionability. Id. at 17-18 (“[T]he right to seek class action relief in consumer cases
has been extolled by California courts. A notable example is the opinion in Vasquez [] . .
. That this view has endured over the last 30 years is of little surprise given the
importance class action consumer litigation has come to play in this state. In light of that

substantive unconscionability should therefore have been substantially eased, though there was no
indication in the Court’s ruling that such consideration or adjustment had been made.

history, we cannot accept AOL's assertion that the elimination of class actions for
consumer remedies if the forum selection clause is enforced is a matter of insubstantial
moment. The unavailability of class action relief in this context is sufficient in and
by itself to preclude enforcement of the TOS forum selection clause.”) (emphasis
added).
Similarly, California courts have held that where, as here, a class action waiver is
entirely one-sided, that is, only one party gives up a meaningful right to class litigation or
arbitration, a strong case for substantive unconscionability is made based on that basis
alone:
Although styled as a mutual prohibition on representative
or class actions, it is difficult to envision the circumstances under
which the provision might negatively impact Discover, because
credit card companies typically do not sue their customers in class
action lawsuits. This provision is clearly meant to prevent
customers, such as Szetela and those he seeks to represent, from
seeking redress for relatively small amounts of money, such as the
$29 sought by Szetela. Fully aware that few customers will go to
the time and trouble of suing in small claims court, Discover has
instead sought to create for itself virtual immunity from class or
representative actions despite their potential merit, while suffering
no similar detriment to its own rights. . . . While the advantages to
Discover are obvious, such a practice contradicts the California
Legislature's stated policy of discouraging unfair and unlawful
business practices, and of creating a mechanism for a
representative to seek relief on behalf of the general public as a
private attorney general. (See, e.g., Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et
seq.) It provides the customer with no benefit whatsoever; to the
contrary, it seriously jeopardizes customers' consumer rights by
prohibiting any effective means of litigating Discover's business
practices. This is not only substantively unconscionable, it violates
public policy by granting Discover a “get out of jail free” card
while compromising important consumer rights.
Szetela v. Discover Bank, 97 Cal. App.4th at 1101, cited with approval in Discover Bank
v. Superior Court, 30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 84 (Cal. 2005).

In marked contrast to these California decisions, the Court here required Plaintiffs
to meet all three criteria for substantive unconscionability, and, having found that
Plaintiff did not meet all three, ruled against them.4 The Court’s strict adherence to the
purported “three-part test” thus reveals that there are substantial grounds for
disagreement on the Court’s unconscionability findings.
2

The ‘Materially Greater Interest’ Question

Though it found that the forum selection clause was not unconscionable under
California law, the Court nonetheless further decided that “it is abundantly clear [] that
California’s interest in this litigation is not materially greater than North Carolina’s.” See
Transcript, p. 70. There are substantial grounds for disagreement on the Court’s
resolution of this issue as well, as the case law in California strongly indicates that a
different conclusion would be reached there.
When addressing the ‘materially greater interest’ test, California courts have put
great emphasis on the domicile of the parties, the place of the wrong, and which state’s
laws are at issue (if any). See generally, Douglas v. United States Dist. Court, 495 F.3d
1062, 1067 n.2 (9th Cir. 2007); Discover Bank v. Superior Ct. of Los Angeles, 134
Cal.App.4th 886, 895 (2005); J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc. v. Superior Court, 113
Cal.App.4th 195, 221 (2003); see also Transcript, p. 70 (citing these same
considerations).
With respect to the domicile of the parties, the Court essentially limited its
analysis to the representative Plaintiffs and Lending Tree (which it dubbed the “key”
defendant), all but ignoring the presence of the five (5) California-based defendants in

4

Plaintiffs maintain that they in fact met all three requirements applied by the Court, but will not reargue
this point given the limited scope of a § 1292(b) petition.

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

Page 8 of 15

this case,5 and also ignored the putative class of California consumers Plaintiffs seek to
represent in this litigation. When all of the parties in interest are properly considered, the
domicile issue weighs strongly in favor of California.
It was not disputed here that Plaintiffs have brought several claims against
Lending Tree and the remaining California defendants under California state consumer
protection laws. See Transcript, pp. 49-51. California obviously has a greater interest in
overseeing the prosecution of its laws than North Carolina, so this factor too raises
ground for disagreement.
As to the place of the wrong, the Court basically assumed that the birthplace of
the wrongdoing was North Carolina, rather than California, because Lending Tree has its
“home office” there - - even though all of the recipients of the protected consumer
information are located in California and the information was thus received there. There
was simply no basis in the record for the Court to conclude that merely because data was
sent from North Carolina (even assuming that it was),6 that the wrongdoing emanated
from there. It is certainly possible that the data was sent as a result of contacts or
requests initiated by persons in California, rather than vice-versa, but discovery has not
yet progressed to the point that this question can be answered definitively.
In this regard, it is also noteworthy that Lending Tree itself alleged in the
California action it filed against the California-based defendants that the wrongful
conduct occurred in California. See Transcript, p. 42. Plaintiffs therefore submit that at

5

See Transcript, pp. 48-49 (listing California defendants: Newport Lending Corp.; Southern California
Marketing Corp.; Home Loan Consultants, Inc.; Chapman Capital, Inc.; and Sage Credit Co.).
6
Lending Tree’s Irvine, California headquarters is, in fact, larger than its North Carolina “home office.”

best, this factor is in equipoise, and the other two factors, which favor California, should
have controlled.
For these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that there are substantial grounds
for disagreement regarding the Court’s ‘materially greater interest’ ruling here.
III.

Immediate Appeal of the Court’s Stay Ruling May Advance the Ultimate
Termination of the Litigation
As the Court is aware, there are several additional defendants remaining in this

litigation, none of whom could take advantage of the Lending Tree arbitration clause,
including the class action waiver provision therein. See Transcript, pp. 48-49. The
presence of these additional defendants, Plaintiffs submit, means that immediate appeal
of the Court’s arbitration ruling likely will advance the ultimate termination of the
litigation, as a reversal would eliminate the dual-track proceedings that the ruling creates.
The MDL litigation has not been terminated as a result of the Court’s arbitration
decree; Plaintiffs will continue litigating their claims against the additional defendants,
and the Court will preside over these consolidated pre-trial proceedings. It is only when
these cases are ready for trial (assuming no pre-trial disposition) that the Court’s
responsibility over the litigation will end, as the individual actions are transferred back to
the transferor courts for trial. The Court’s arbitration ruling necessarily means that
Plaintiffs will be arbitrating their claims against Lending Tree concurrent with the ongoing MDL proceedings against the non-Lending Tree defendants. Such dual-track
proceedings represent a tremendous waste of party and system resources, especially if, as
here, a reversal of the Court’s arbitration ruling is possible.7

7

The presence of the additional defendants distinguishes this case from Stephens v. Wachovia Corp., 2008
WL 1820928, at *4 (W.D.N.C. 2008) (Reidinger, J.), where the court held that interlocutory appeal of an
arbitration order would not materially advance the litigation.

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

10
Document 27

Filed 03/16/2009

Page 10 of 15

A reversal of the Court’s ruling would mean that all claims against all defendants
could be prosecuted in a single forum (pre-trial), which would no doubt save a
tremendous amount of time and resources. Consolidation involving all claims and all
defendants also significantly increases the possibility of a global compromise resolution,
which may not be attainable while litigation and arbitration are proceeding on parallel
tracks. These very considerations were found to merit immediate appeal of an arbitration
ruling in a consumer class action case in Hoffman v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 2007
WL 5659406, at *4 (C.D. Cal. 2007):
Plaintiff argues immediate appeal of the Arbitration Order will
materially advance the litigation since both her individual and class
claims are currently stayed pending arbitration. (Motion 16:16-19.)
Defendant contends arbitration is a more reasonable and efficient
alternative method of materially advancing the litigation toward a
final resolution, at which point, an appeal from final judgment
could then be taken. (Opposition 13:19-24.) Again, the Court
agrees with Plaintiff.
*
*
*
Here, the litigation is stayed pending the submission of
Plaintiff's claims to arbitration on an individual basis. There is
no pending trial, and discovery has not been completed.
Resolution of the choice of law question in favor of Plaintiff
could materially advance the litigation by allowing Plaintiff's
claims to move forward without an unnecessary arbitration,
giving the parties an opportunity to settle or dismiss without
having to wait for an appeal following final judgment. The
Ninth Circuit has previously accepted interlocutory appeals from
orders compelling arbitration while court proceedings are stayed,
implying such appeals do have the potential to materially advance
the litigation. See Kuehner v. Dickinson & Co., 84 F.3d 316 (9th
Cir.1996).
(Emphasis added).
On the other hand, absent an immediate appeal, the Court would, in addition to
overseeing the consolidated pre-trial proceedings involving the non-Lending Tree
defendants, retain jurisdiction to review any and all awards entered in the Lending Tree

Case 3:08-md-01976-FDW

11

Page 11 of 15

arbitration.8 Whether these awards are individual or class-based, plenary appeal (or
appeals) could be filed following the Court’s review, including a review of the Court’s
initial arbitration decision. If reversed, the Court would then be required to oversee pretrial proceedings of Plaintiffs’ class claims against Lending Tree, which likely would
have been completed had interlocutory review been granted. Accordingly, immediate
appeal of the arbitration order at issue represents an opportunity to advance the ultimate
termination of the MDL proceedings, and to avoid the needless expenditure of substantial
time and other resources associated with parallel proceedings.
In addition, immediate appeal is merited here because this litigation, as to all
defendants, is in its infancy. Discovery has not yet commenced, as against Lending Tree
or the remaining defendants, and significant pre-trial proceedings remain. Accordingly,
permitting the Fourth Circuit to review the Court’s arbitration decision will in no way
delay the ultimate transfer of these actions to the transferor districts for trial, a
consideration that otherwise cuts against immediate review. See e.g., 16 Wright, et. al.,
Federal Practice and Procedure § 3930 (“Delay may be a particularly strong ground for
denying appeal if certification is sought from a ruling made shortly before a trial expected
to be brief.”); Hoffman, 2007 WL 5659406, at *4 (granting certification, noting that no
trial date was set and discovery had not been completed).

8

Plaintiffs anticipate that Lending Tree will argue that class-wide arbitration is not available under its
contract with the members of the putative class. If successful, this argument likely would result in a series
of individual arbitrations being conducted. Regardless of how long this process might take, the Court
would retain jurisdiction to review each of the awards. See Arthur Treachers, Inc., 280 F.3d at 1097-98
(administrative order closing case would be lifted for court to review resulting arbitration awards). This
would, in turn, prolong the proceedings in this Court.

Because immediate review may advance the ultimate termination of these MDL
proceedings, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the Court should certify its February 5,
2009 ruling pursuant to §1292.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court certify for
immediate review its February 5, 2009 ruling requiring Plaintiffs to arbitrate all claims
raised against Lending Tree in this litigation. The Court’s Order meets the standards for
certification set forth in 28 U.S.C. §1292(b), and, Plaintiffs submit, immediate review
will ultimately avoid the inefficiencies and inconsistencies associated with having the
claims raised in Plaintiffs’ Complaint prosecuted in two very different forums: arbitration
(class or individual) against Lending Tree, and continued litigation here against the
remaining defendants.
