Civil Action No.: 3:08-MD-1976

THE BERCAW-MILLER-SHAVER GROUP PLAINTIFFS’ PETITION FOR
CERTIFICATION FOR APPEAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)
The Bercaw-Miller-Shaver Group Plaintiffs, through undersigned counsel, and
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), respectfully request that the Court certify its February 5,
2009 ruling granting Defendant LendingTree, LLC’s (hereafter “Lending Tree”)
“Consolidated Motion to Stay and Compel Arbitration” to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for immediate appeal. As set forth in the accompanying
Memorandum of Law, the Court’s decision involves a controlling question of law for
which there is substantial grounds for a difference of opinion, and immediate appeal
likely will advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. Interlocutory review under
§ 1292(b) is therefore appropriate, and Plaintiffs submit that a certification of the Court’s
decision should be filed.
Dated: March 16, 2009.
Respectfully submitted,

By:
