MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT AND STATEMENT OF ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

3

Plaintiff GABRIELLE GANGITANO brings this action against defendants DISTRICT and

4

ALEX TAURKE (“TAURKE”), a math professor at Cabrillo Community College, for violations of Title

5

IX and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 arising out of alleged sexual harassment by TAURKE. Plaintiff’s complaint

6

fails to allege facts sufficient to state each of the claims asserted, relying on “naked assertions” devoid of

7

“further factual enhancement.” (Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

8

Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007).) dismissal is warranted because:

9
10
11

1) The First Cause of Action is unsupported by facts to state a claim for violation of Title IX by
the DISTRICT; and,
2) The DISTRICT has Eleventh Amendment immunity against a §1983 claim.

12

II.

FACTS ALLEGED BY PLAINTIFF

13

During the time described in her complaint, Plaintiff was an undergraduate at Cabrillo

14

Community College majoring in Math. TAURKE was her professor. She was also a teaching assistant

15

for TAURKE. (Complaint ¶ 15.)

16

TAURKE “began to make sexually suggestive acts” such as “offering Plaintiff food from his

17

lunch; closing the blinds in his office prior to Plaintiff’s arranged meetings with him; hugging Plaintiff;

18

suggesting that Plaintiff remove layers of clothing, like scarf [sic] or jacket, due to the warm temperature

19

in his office; forcing Plaintiff feel [sic] his scars; and recommending that Plaintiff not transfer to another

20

University despite a scholarship.” (Id. ¶ 17.) He also sent her emails inviting her to his office to meet

21

outside of her role as his teaching assistant and telling her she was beautiful. (Id. ¶¶ 19-20.)

22

On May 18, 2016, TAURKE told Plaintiff, “You have that superpower where you are

23

enchantingly beautiful and incredibly smart and funny and beautiful inside and out and you have a

24

superpower of casting a spell on people and you’ve cast a spell on me.” He hugged her and touched and

25

stroked her legs. (Id. ¶ 20.)

26

On May 20, 2016, Plaintiff met with TAURKE in his office. TAURKE had closed the blinds in

27

his office. During their meeting, TAURKE moved his chair closer to Plaintiff “so he could put his knees

28

around hers to their knees and thighs would touch. In addition, he caressed and stroked the side of

1

Plaintiff’s face and head.” (Id. ¶ 21.)

2

Between May 22, 2016 and May 24, 2016, Plaintiff attempted to contact the Title IX coordinator

3

at CABRILLO. She was “deferred to many offices, until she was finally directed to male athletic coach.”

4

She did not feel comfortable speaking to him and felt she could not make a complaint. (Id. ¶ 25.)

A.

ARGUMENT

The Complaint is Subject to Dismissal Under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6)

7

Dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is proper where there is either a “lack of a cognizable

8

legal theory” or “the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.” (Balistreri v.

9

Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).) The Court must determine whether plaintiffs

10

would be entitled to some form of relief if the facts alleged in the complaint were true. (Conley v.

11

Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957), abrogated in part by Twombly, 550 U.S. at 560; De La Cruz v.

12

Tormey, 582 F.2d 45, 48 (9th Cir. 1978).) The Court need not accept as true, conclusory allegations,

13

unreasonable inferences, legal characterizations or unwarranted deductions of fact or legal conclusions

14

couched as facts. (Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, 18 F.3d 752, 754-755 (9th

15

Cir. 1994); Western Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 630 (9th Cir. 1981).)

16

FRCP Rule 8 “demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed me

17

accusation…A pleading that offers ‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a

18

cause of action will not do.’…Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertions’ devoid of

19

‘further factual enhancement.’” (Iqbal, supra at 678; Twombly, supra at 555.) “To survive a motion to

20

dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that

21

is plausible on its face.’ … A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that

22

allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.

23

… The plausibility standard … asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted

24

unlawfully. … Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability, it

25

‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’” (Iqbal, 556 U.S. at

26

678; Moss v. U.S. Secret Servs., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009).) “Threadbare recitals of the elements

27

of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. … Rule 8 … does not

28

unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions. … [O]nly a

Case 5:17-cv-02870-LHK Document 16 Filed 06/29/17 Page 4 of 7

1

complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss ... where the well-pleaded

2

facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint … has

3

not ‘shown’ – ‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” (Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-679.) As our Ninth Circuit

4

recognizes:

5

[T]o be entitled to the presumption of truth, allegations in a complaint … may not
simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain sufficient allegations
of underlying facts … the factual allegations that are taken as true must plausibly
suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party
to be subjected to the expense of discovery and continued litigation.

8

(AE ex rel. Hernandez v. County of Tulare, 666 F.3d 631, 637 (9th Cir. 2012); Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d

9

1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).) “Twombly and Iqbal … distilled to their essence, impose two requirements.

10

First, the reviewing court … is not required to credit legal conclusions…Second, the complaint cannot

11

survive a motion to dismiss unless it alleges facts that plausibly (not merely conceivably) entitle plaintiff

12

to relief.” (Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1067-1068 (9th Cir. 2011).) “Thus, a court discounts

13

conclusory statements, which are not entitled to the presumption of truth, before determining whether a

14

claim is plausible.” (Chavez v. U.S., 683 F.3d 1102, 1109 (9th Cir. 2012).)

15

B.

The First Cause of Action for Violation of Title IX Fails to State a Claim

16

Plaintiff attempts to allege two theories under Title IX against the DISTRICT. Both theories fail

17

to state a claim and are subject to dismissal because: (1) no facts are established to establish that the

18

DISTRICT had actual knowledge of alleged sexual harassment, and (2) there is no right of action for

19

alleged deficiencies in administrative requirements.

20
21

1.

The Complaint Fails to Allege Facts to Show that the DISTRICT had Actual Notice
of Sexual Harassment

22

A school district is not liable under Title IX for a teacher’s sexual harassment of a student absent

23

actual notice and deliberate indifference. (Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S.

24

274, 292 (1998).)

25

In Gebser, the Court held that when a teacher has allegedly sexually harassed a student, “unless

26

an official of the school district who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures on the

27

District’s behalf has actual notice of, and is deliberately indifferent to, the teacher’s misconduct”

28

recovery against the District is barred. (Id. at 277.) The Supreme Court has further held that a school

USDC Case No.: :17-cv-02870-LHK

Case 5:17-cv-02870-LHK Document 16 Filed 06/29/17 Page 5 of 7

1

district’s liability for teacher-on-student sexual harassment is not based on respondeat superior or

2

vicarious liability, but rather is based on the District’s own intentional conduct in remaining idle after

3

receiving actual notice of sexual harassment. (Id. at 285; Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe

4

County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 641-42 (1999).)

5

To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must also prove they were subject to either quid pro

6

quo sexual harassment or a sexually hostile educational environment. (Kleencic v. Ohia State Univ., 263

7

F.3d 504, 510 (6th Cir. 2001); Morse v. Regents of Univ. of Colorado, 154 F.3d 1124, 1127 (10th Cir.

8

1998).)

9

The facts, as pled, show that the DISTRICT did not have notice of the alleged sexual harassment.

10

Plaintiff asserts that the DISTRICT had “actual knowledge of TAURKE’s unfitness” but does not allege

11

facts to support that contention. Rather, as pled, the complaint establishes that because Plaintiff did not

12

report the alleged sexual harassment to anyone at the DISTRICT (let alone “an official of the school

13

district who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures on the district’s behalf”) the

14

DISTRICT did not have actual notice of the alleged sexual harassment.

15
16

2.

There is No Private Right of Action Under Title IX for Violation of Administrative
Requirements

17

There is no private right of action under Title IX for violations of administrative requirements,

18

including Department of Education (“DOE”) regulations. (Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School

19

District, 524 U.S. 274, 292 (1998).) Further, failure to adhere to DOE regulations “does not constitute

20

deliberate indifference.” (Moore v. Regents of the University of California, 2016 WL 4917103 at 3.)

21

In Gebser, as is the case here, the petitioners focused primarily on the school district’s “asserted

22

failure to promulgate and publicize an effective policy and grievance procedure for sexual harassment

23

claims.” The Court held that the District’s “alleged failure to comply with the regulations ... does not

24

establish the requisite actual notice and deliberate indifference.

25

promulgate a grievance procedure does not itself constitute ‘discrimination’ under Title IX.”

And in any event, the failure to

26

In 2016, this court granted a Motion to Dismiss in a similar case for the same reason. The

27

plaintiff in Moore v. Regents of the University of California alleged in her Complaint that Defendants

28

violated the standards set forth by a “Dear Colleague Letter” promulgated by the “DOE” and therefore

USDC Case No.: :17-cv-02870-LHK

Case 5:17-cv-02870-LHK Document 16 Filed 06/29/17 Page 6 of 7

1

“acted with deliberate indifference in deviating significantly from the standard of care outlined by the

2

‘DOE.’” (Moore v. Regents of the University of California, 2016 WL 4917103 at 3.) The Court

3

reiterated the holding from Gebser that there is no private right of action under Title IX for violations of

4

DOE administrative requirements. (Id.)

5

Plaintiff alleges that the DISTRICT “failed to provide Plaintiff, and other students and employees

6

of [the DISTRICT] with sufficient, easily understandable and accessible information on how to present

7

complaints of such unlawful conduct, or identification of an appropriate Title IX Coordinator.” She

8

contends that this allegation supports her Title IX Cause of Action. However, under Gebser, this does

9

not state a claim under Title IX.

10

C.

The DISTRICT has Eleventh Amendment Immunity Against a §1983 Claim

11

The DISTRICT, as a state agency, is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. “Under the

12

Eleventh Amendment, agencies of the state are immune from private damage actions or suits for

13

injunctive relief brought in federal court.” (Mitchell v. Los Angeles Cty. Cmty. Coll. Dist., 861 F.2d 198,

14

201 (9th Cir. 1988). Claims for damages against a state or a state official acting in his or her official

15

capacity are barred under § 1983. (Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 342 (1979).)

16

Community College Districts are arms of the State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and,

17

thus, immune from suit under § 1983. See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. at 342; Cerrato v. San Francisco

18

Community College Dist., 26 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir. 1994); Mitchell v. Los Angeles Community College

19

Dist., 861 F.2d 198, 201 (9th Cir. 1988). No amendment can cure the defects of the civil rights pleadings

20

since the DISTRICT is immune from suit. The second Cause of Action alleges only a § 1983 claim, so

21

dismissal of that claim in its entirety is appropriate as to the DISTRICT.

22
23
24
25
26
27
28

The Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cerrato v. San Francisco Community College District, 26 F.3d 968
(9th Cir. 1994), states:
As a threshold matter, the defendants argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars this court
from hearing Cerrato's section 1983 claims. They argue that such a result is compelled by
Mitchell . . . in which we held that [a] California community college school district was a
state entity that possessed Eleventh Amendment immunity from section 1983 claims. We
agree with the defendants that the Eleventh Amendment bars us from hearing Cerrato's
claims against the SFCC district. In general, the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal
court from hearing claims by a citizen against dependent instrumentalities of the state.
We have held that community college districts are dependent instrumentalities of the
state of California. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to hear Cerrato's claims against the
district. Id. at 972 (citations omitted).

1

Dismissal without prejudice would be futile because this claim similarly may not be asserted in

2

state court against the DISTRICT. The State is not a “person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
