Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Notice Of

17 Objection To Government's Request (Dkt. #1026) For Additional Time To Respond To Dkt.
18 #1013 And Notice Of Objection To Government Responding To Dkt. #1013 At All And Notice
19 Of Intent To Strike Government Response. On May 17, 2013, the government filed Dkt.
20 #1026 wherein it stated that the defendant had no objection to the government taking
21 additional time to respond to four pending motions. However, when the defendant's defense
22 asked the defendant for his position on the government's request, he was only informed of
23 the government's intent to respond to Dkt. #1000, #1005, and #1016. The defendant was not
24 notified of the government's intent to respond to the defendant's First Supplement to Motion
25 for Order Requiring Government to Comply With Data Deletion Requirements of N.D. Cal.
26 08-70460-HRL/PVT, 08-70503-PVT, and 08-70502-PVT Warrants (Dkt. #1013).
27 Furthermore, the defendant could not have inferred the government's intent to respond

1 considering Dkt. #1013 (previously Dkt. #927) and the parent motion at Dkt. #846[1] were
2 already denied by the Court on March 28, 2013 via Dkt. #1009.

The defendant objects to the government receiving additional time to respond to Dkt.

5 alone by June 7, 2013, considering the motion and its parent motion were already denied by
6 the Court at Dkt. #1009. On May 15, 2013, the defendant filed his notice of interlocutory
7 appeal to the Ninth Circuit (Dkt. #1018) appealing the district court's order denying Dkt.
8 #1013 (previously #927) and denying Dkt. #846. Two days later, the government established
9 its intent to respond to Dkt. #1013 but did not inform the defendant of that intent prior to
10 filing its request for additional time at Dkt. #1026. Had the defendant been asked for his
11 position prior to the government filing Dkt. #1026, the defendant would have objected to the
12 government's request with respect to Dkt. #1013.
13

The government responding to Dkt. #1013 after it was denied and while an appeal is

14 pending in the Ninth Circuit is a clear legal tactic designed to create the appearance that the
15 underlying issue is yet to receive “a complete and final determination... in the district court.”
16 United States v. Griffin, 617 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1980). The Ninth Circuit recently ordered
17 the defendant to show cause as to why the issue being appealed is final. Therefore, the
18 government's intent to respond to Dkt. #1013 is a tactic that will only confuse the issue for
19 those reviewing the record. In addition, the government responding to Dkt. #1013 is a tactic
20 to place new arguments on the district court record so that they can be raised by the
21 government on appeal. The defendant objects to the government's tactics and will move to
22 strike its response to Dkt. #1013 if filed by the government.
23

This notice was drafted by the pro se defendant, however, he authorizes his shadow

24 counsel, Philip Seplow, to file this notice on his behalf using the ECF system.
25

It is not expected that excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) will occur as a

26 result of this notice.
