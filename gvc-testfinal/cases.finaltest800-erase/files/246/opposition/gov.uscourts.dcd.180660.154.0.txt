OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe respectfully opposes the motion for extension of time
filed by defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. While the Tribe and its counsel ordinarily
would not object to reasonable modifications to the briefing schedule, this is not an ordinary

situation. The Tribe has worked tirelessly to present the issues in this case to the Court on a
schedule that would allow their resolution prior to the initiation of pipeline operations. The
easement decision at the heart of this case was issued on February 8—the key underlying
documents were not provided to the Tribe until the following day. Even so, the Tribe filed its
summary judgment motion just a few days later, after securing the parties’ agreement to the
schedule that gave the Corps and Dakota Access a full three weeks to prepare opposition briefs.
That agreed schedule was based on Dakota Access’s representation to the Court that construction
would take between 60 and 83 days to complete. Once the schedule was agreed upon, however,
it became evident that construction was proceeding much faster. Accordingly, as it stands
already, it will be difficult to complete briefing and render a decision before operations
commence, which gravely prejudices the Tribe.
The Tribe recognizes that this case creates significant burdens on all counsel as well as
the Court. However, the Corps agreed to the schedule with full knowledge of the change in its
legal team, and with full knowledge of the issues that were to be presented in the Tribe’s motion.
And the Tribe has worked closely with Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, other parties, and opposing
counsel to minimize the risk that other filings (like CRST’s summary judgment motion) would
interfere with the agreed briefing schedule. As the Court recognized during a recent status
conference, this case should be a high priority for resources within the Department of Justice,
and the Tribe believes that it is. For that reason, the Tribe respectfully requests that the Corps be
granted no more than two additional days to finalize its brief.
Whether the Court grants a two-day or a seven-day extension, the Tribe respectfully
requests that Dakota Access be held to the original deadline. Dakota Access has not indicated an
intention to seek additional time, has not presented any justification requiring additional time,

and does not face the same issues as the Corps, such as a change in the lead counsel role. If
Dakota Access files its brief on March 7, as it previously agreed, it will allow the Tribe to begin
work on its reply brief prior to the Corps filing its opposition. 1

Under the current schedule, the Tribe has two weeks to reply to the Dakota Access and Corps
oppositions. Accordingly, if the Court grants an extension, the Tribe respectfully requests an
equivalent extension for its reply, although it will endeavor to file its reply prior to the deadline.
