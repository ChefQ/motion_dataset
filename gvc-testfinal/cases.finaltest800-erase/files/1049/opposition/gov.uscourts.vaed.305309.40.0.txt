Case No. 2:14-CV-187-RGD-LRL

DEFENDANT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY’S OPPOSITION
TO HILL-ROM’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
I.

INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Hill-Rom’s request for a preliminary injunction—a drastic and extraordinary form of

relief that rarely should issue—is doomed on every front.1
First, Hill-Rom cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits of its patent
infringement claims. To overcome the prior art in order to get the patents issued, Hill-Rom told
the U.S. Patent Office that systems that function like GE’s Hand Hygiene System are not
covered by the asserted patent claims. In fact, virtually all of Hill-Rom’s infringement theories
raised in its motion were either specifically disclaimed, or else depend upon functionality that
1

As explained in GE’s pending motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (ECF
36, 37), Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and Hill-Rom Manufacturing, Inc. also lack standing to bring
this case. Moreover, because the allegations in the complaint do not distinguish between the
Plaintiffs, it is impossible to determine which allegations are attributable to Hill-Rom Services,
Inc., the only plaintiff that may plausibly have standing. Plaintiffs’ failure to adequately plead
standing is alone enough to defeat plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion. See, e.g., Bushnell,
Inc. v. Brunton Co., 659 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1166 (D. Kan. 2009) (denying preliminary injunction
due to plaintiffs’ lack of standing); Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2001) (reversing
grant of preliminary injunction because plaintiffs lacked standing). GE’s use of “Hill-Rom” is
solely for convenience and is not a concession that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this case.

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 2 of 32 PageID# 438

Hill-Rom’s own expert acknowledged does not exist in GE’s system. Hill-Rom therefore is not
likely to succeed on its infringement claims. Moreover, in the event that Hill-Rom’s
infringement theories are accepted, as a consequence, the asserted claims would be invalid as
having already been disclosed in the prior art.
Hill-Rom also cannot prove irreparable injury. Although Hill-Rom now claims urgency
in this matter, it waited over a year to bring suit. GE began marketing its Hand Hygiene System
in 2009, and by 2012, GE had already installed hundreds of hand-washing monitoring stations in
the Summerville facility identified in Hill-Rom’s motion. GE also distributed information sheets
there throughout the 2012 time period. Hill-Rom thus knew or should have known about GE’s
system at least because Hill-Rom sells its own products at that same facility. Tellingly, HillRom admits that it knew about GE’s system at least as early as “the Spring of 2013,” but offers
no explanation for waiting until May 2014 to bring this matter of supposed “immediate and
irreparable harm” to the Court’s attention. Hill-Rom’s delay is fatal to its motion.2
Hill-Rom also offers no credible evidence of any actual lost sales, market share,
goodwill, price erosion, nor any evidence that GE’s customers would buy hand-washing systems
from Hill-Rom but for GE’s alleged infringement. Instead, Hill-Rom’s supporting declarations
are replete with speculation and inadmissible hearsay. See, e.g., McMullin Decl. at ¶ 29 (“I have
been informed by HCA . . .”), ¶ 31 (“representatives of HCA have stated . . .”), ¶ 36 (“my
discussions with HCA’s leadership team . . .”), ¶ 37 (“the healthcare facility was told by HCA
management . . .”), ¶ 41 (“I am informed and believe that. . .”); Wildman Decl. at ¶ 8 (“I spoke
with hospital personnel . . .”), ¶ 10 (“I was informed that . . .”), ¶ 26 (“I was informed by hospital
2

See, e.g., High Tech Med. Instrumentation, Inc. v. New Image Indus., Inc., 49 F.3d 1551, 1557
(Fed. Cir. 1995) (“17 months is a substantial period of delay that militates against the issuance of
a preliminary injunction by demonstrating that there is no apparent urgency to the request for
injunctive relief.”).

staff . . .”). And there is good reason for Hill-Rom’s utter lack of evidence to support its
motion—of the nearly 6,000 hospitals in the United States, GE’s Hand Hygiene System is
presently installed in only five of them. Of further significant importance are the facts that there
are more than a dozen competitors in the market, GE’s total revenues for the accused system is
less than $400,000, and GE presently has no orders to install any further systems. Thus, HillRom clearly has not been irreparably harmed by anything GE has done. Moreover, to the extent
GE succeeds in installing any additional systems in the short period before trial, Hill-Rom can
easily be compensated with money damages, which is the antithesis of irreparable injury.
Finally, the balance of the hardships and the public interest weigh against an injunction.
Hill-Rom waited nearly a decade after the earliest asserted patent issued before entering the
relevant market, and Hill-Rom’s success does not depend in any way upon the outcome of this
case. In fact, Hill-Rom has reported more than $1.6B in annual revenues, with only $5M (less
than 0.3 percent) in hand-washing monitoring system sales. Moreover, hand-washing monitoring
systems save lives, so preliminarily enjoining such sales would be against the public interest.
For all of these reasons, Hill-Rom’s request for a preliminary injunction should be denied.
II.

THE RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY & GE’S AGILETRAC™ HAND HYGIENE SYSTEM
The technology at issue relates to monitoring a person’s hand-washing in a healthcare

facility. Hill-Rom’s patents disclose specific implementations for monitoring compliance with
hand-washing policies, requiring the system to track healthcare workers’ movement among
“zones” as they come into contact with potentially contaminated people or equipment, in order to
determine if the person may have become contaminated. To minimize the hardware and
software required for this system, Hill-Rom’s patents further claim a sensor that can aggregate
all of the pertinent data bits into a single package of information for analysis by a master station.

3

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 4 of 32 PageID# 440

GE’s accused AgileTrac™ Hand Hygiene System, although elegant in its operation, does
not contain these features. GE implemented its hand hygiene product as an “add-on” to GE’s
non-accused, existing Real-Time Location System (RTLS) infrastructure product, which has
been used for years to keep track of equipment like hospital beds and wheelchairs.3 The “addon” consists of a sensor mounted to hand-washing soap dispensers, and a software program.
This system does not track movement of people among zones, nor does it monitor contact
between people or equipment or combine the relevant data bits into a single package of
information for a master station. And GE’s system certainly does not determine if a person is
contaminated, as Hill-Rom’s patents describe.
Instead, GE’s system uses ordinary infrared and radio frequency sensors to keep track of
a person’s location in a hospital, in much the same way that a hospital can track its beds and
wheelchairs. The soap dispensers use a separate sensor to send a signal when the dispenser
handle is actuated. Once per day, in the middle of the night, a software program compares the
dispenser data with the location data to attempt to correlate hand-washing events with location
change events. The software then generates a report showing average hand-washing compliance
over time. As demonstrated below and in the supporting declaration of GE’s expert, Dr. Gill
Tsouri, GE’s system does not read on the asserted claims.
III.

LEGAL STANDARDS
A preliminary injunction is a “drastic and extraordinary remedy that is not to be routinely

granted.” Nat’l Steel Car, Ltd. v. Canadian Pac. Ry., Ltd., 357 F.3d 1319, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2004);
see also Pennington v. PNC Mortgage, 2010 WL 8741958 at *2 (E.D. Va. Aug. 11, 2010)

(internal citations omitted); PRE Holding, Inc. v. Monaghan Med. Corp., 2009 WL 3874171 at
*1 (E.D. Va. Nov. 17, 2009) (denying preliminary injunction); H. Jay Spiegel & Associates, P.C.
v. Spiegel, 652 F. Supp. 2d 630, 634 (E.D. Va. 2008) (denying preliminary injunction). In order
to receive a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to succeed on the
merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the
balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Apple Inc. v.
Samsung Elecs. Co., 695 F.3d 1370, 1373-74 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res.
Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). If a “clear showing” of entitlement with respect to
any of the four factors is missing, a motion for a preliminary injunction must be denied. Because
the determination of likelihood of success is a matter of substantive patent law, district courts
weighing preliminary injunctions apply Federal Circuit precedent. See Revision Military, Inc. v.
Balboa Mfg. Co., 700 F.3d 524, 525 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
A preliminary injunction cannot issue unless a patentee establishes that it is likely to
succeed “on all disputed liability issues at trial.” New England Braiding Co. v. A.W. Chesterton
Co., 970 F.2d 878, 882 (Fed. Cir. 1992). No such showing is made where the defendant raises a
“substantial question” as to either the validity of the asserted patents or the merits of the
plaintiff’s infringement case. See Oakley Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int’l., 316 F.3d 1331, 1340 (Fed.
Cir. 2003) (“the injunction should not issue if the party opposing the injunction raises ‘a
substantial question’ concerning infringement or validity”). The plaintiff bears the burden of
proving that any defense the defendant raises “lacks substantial merit.” Id.; see also New Eng.
Braiding Co., 970 F.2d at 883. In order to raise a substantial question of validity, a defendant
need not “make out a case of actual invalidity.” See Amazon.com, Inc. v. BarnesandNoble.com,

Inc., 239 F.3d 1343 at 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Satisfaction of the “substantial question”
requirement merely requires a showing that the patents are vulnerable to an invalidity challenge
at trial. See id. (“Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction stage, while validity is
the issue at trial.”).
IV.

DISCUSSION
A.

Hill-Rom Is Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits
1.

GE’s Hand Hygiene System Does Not Infringe Any of the Asserted Claims

GE’s system—which essentially is an add-on to its existing, non-accused RTLS
architecture—works like the prior art systems that Hill-Rom repeatedly distinguished as different
from its claimed invention during the prosecution of each of the asserted patents. See Dirksmeier
Decl. at ¶¶ 10, 25. Unsurprisingly, then, Hill-Rom’s brief offers nothing but bare parroting of the
claim language without any explanation of how GE’s system allegedly infringes the asserted
claims. See, e.g., Hill-Rom’s PI Brief (“PI Brief”) at 10-13. Moreover, Hill-Rom’s declaration
from Mr. Wildman is replete with hearsay that does not inform how GE’s Hand Hygiene System
functions in any way that is actually relevant to the asserted claims. See, e.g., Wildman Decl. at
¶¶ 8, 10, 26. And Hill-Rom’s expert, Dr. Felder, attempts to read the asserted patents on GE’s
system in a way that Hill-Rom disclaimed in the prosecution history. Dr. Felder and Mr.
Wildman both inaccurately describe GE’s system and otherwise acknowledge various missing
elements in their own analysis. Thus, Hill-Rom’s brief and supporting evidence fall far short of
demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits.
In contrast, GE’s evidence—the declarations of GE Global Product Manager Rob
Wallace and hand-hygiene monitoring expert Dr. Gill Tsouri—confirm that GE’s system does
not infringe any of the asserted claims. Dr. Tsouri even visited the very same Summerville
facility that Dr. Felder and Mr. Wildman visited to confirm that his opinions are correct. Even

6

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 7 of 32 PageID# 443

though, as noted below, simply raising substantial questions concerning infringement is enough
to defeat this motion, the question here is not even close. Among other things, GE’s system does
not include numerous elements that the asserted claims require, including: (1) tracking
movement of people among zones to assess contamination; (2) tracking contact between people
and other people or equipment; and (3) aggregating signal data into a single packet of
information. Hill-Rom’s motion should therefore be denied.
a.

Legal Overview

To determine infringement, the Court must first construe the patent claims and then
compare the properly construed claims to the accused device. Carroll Touch, Inc. v. Electro
Mech. Sys., Inc., 15 F.3d 1573, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Infringement can be found only if each
and every claim limitation is present in the accused product. General Elec. Co. v. Nintendo Co.,
179 F.3d 1350, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1999). At this preliminary stage, the existence of a “substantial
question” as to whether the accused product contains every element of the properly construed
claims requires denial of Hill-Rom’s motion. See Oakley, 316 F.3d at 1339. Hill-Rom has not—
and cannot—establish infringement, let alone make the requisite clear showing of infringement
given that the accused devices do not practice numerous limitations of each asserted claim.
b.

The ’818 Patent
1)

Independent Claim 1

Hill-Rom alleges that GE’s Hand Hygiene System infringes independent claims 1, 37,
and 43, and dependent claims 2, 3, 6, 12-15,44, 45, 47, 48, 52, and 56 of the ‘818 Patent.
Independent claim 1 requires among other things a method “which tracks movement of a person
through a facility.” But GE’s system does not track movement and instead only records the
present location of a person. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 46, 66-72, 75; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 20. Hill-Rom’s
expert, Dr. Felder, opines that recording a person’s present location is tracking movement. Yet

7

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 8 of 32 PageID# 444

his opinion is directly contrary to what Hill-Rom told the Patent Office, emphasizing that using
sensors to track the current location of a person is not tracking movement. Bosco Decl., Exhibit
A (‘818 File History (“FH”) at 179. Hill-Rom thus surrendered this claim scope and cannot now
argue that GE’s system tracks movement. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki
Co., 535 U.S. 722, 723 (2002).
Claim 1 also requires determining if a person “washed her hands since her most recent
exposure to a contamination zone other than her current exposure to the patient contact zone.”
GE’s system undisputedly does not use the “zone manager” feature of the RTLS software and
thus does not meet this limitation either. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 46-47, 73-78; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶
20-21; Wildman Decl. at ¶ 29 (“I did not observe the zone manager in connection with my visit
to study the hand hygiene system . . . .”). Indeed, GE’s system does not determine if a person
has been exposed to a contamination zone or a patient contact zone, and it certainly does not
determine if a person washed her hands since moving from one such zone to another. Tsouri
Decl. at ¶ 46-47, 73-78; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 20-21. Perhaps realizing after his visit to Sunnyvale
that GE’s system does not use the “zone manager” feature, Dr. Felder opines generally that the
“contamination zone” in GE’s system is the hallway. Felder Decl. at ¶ 24. But the patent
specification clearly says otherwise: “[A] hallway, is not a contamination zone.” 12:18-21.
In GE’s system, hand-washing is required every time a worker enters a patient room—
this is true regardless of the worker’s previous location, regardless of whether the room is
occupied or empty, and regardless of whether the person is actually contaminated. Tsouri Decl.
at ¶ 46-47, 73-78; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 20-21. This functionality is precisely what Hill-Rom
surrendered to overcome a rejection of claim 1: “[The prior art] Applonie [reference] fails to
teach determining that the person has been exposed to a contamination zone. Applonie makes

8

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 9 of 32 PageID# 445

any person that wants to enter the [room] wash his/her hands. There is no determination that
the person is actually contaminated or any suggestion that any area of Applonie is a
contamination zone.” Bosco Decl., Exhibit A (‘818 FH) at 180 (emphasis added). Thus, HillRom cannot now argue that claim 1 reads on GE’s system. Festo Corp., 535 U.S. at 723.
Because GE’s Hand Hygiene System does not infringe independent claim 1, it likewise does not
infringe any of the claims depending from claim 1.4 See Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 82-103.
2)

Independent Claim 37

Independent claim 37 requires among other things a method for “determining whether a
person who has been contaminated due to exposure to a contamination zone has left the
contamination zone.” But GE’s system does not determine if a person has been contaminated,
has been exposed to a contamination zone, or has left a contamination zone. Tsouri Decl. at ¶
104-111; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 20-21. Instead, as stated above, hand-washing is required every
time a person enters a room with a monitored dispenser. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 46-47, 104-111;
Wallace Decl. at ¶ 20-21. As with claim 1, Hill-Rom told the Patent Office concerning claim 37
that there must be a step of “determining whether a person who has been contaminated due to
exposure to a contamination zone has left the contamination zone.” Bosco Decl., Exhibit A
(‘818 FH) at 182 (emphasis added). Hill-Rom argued that a system that “just requires everyone
to wash” “does not disclose a contamination zone.” Id. Like the prior art, GE’s system “just
requires everyone to wash” and thus does not meet this claim limitation. Festo Corp., 535 U.S.
at 723.
Claim 37 also requires “determining whether the person has washed her hands within a
trigger time since leaving the contamination zone.” (emphasis added). But as discussed above,
4

GE’s system does not infringe the asserted claims for numerous additional reasons, as set forth
in Dr. Tsouri’s declaration. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 64-137.

9

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 10 of 32 PageID# 446

GE’s system does not monitor for movement among zones. Moreover, Dr. Felder only identifies
a determination in GE’s system of a person entering a patient room. Felder Decl. at ¶ 35. Dr.
Felder thus necessarily believes that entering a room is equivalent to leaving a room. But this
issue also arose during prosecution before the Patent Office, where Hill-Rom argued that these
two are not the same. In distinguishing the Cohen prior art, Hill-Rom asserted: “The badge of
Cohen is activated as being contaminated as soon as the badge enters a monitored area. . . .
Claim 28 [which issued as claim 37] clearly requires that the handwashing is performed after
leaving the contamination zone.” Bosco Decl., Exhibit A (‘818 FH) at 183 (emphasis added);
Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 109-110. Thus, as with the other limitations, Hill-Rom surrendered the very
scope that Dr. Felder attempts to recapture, and GE’s system therefore does not infringe claim
37. See Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 104-111.
3)

Independent Claim 43

Independent claim 43 discloses a first set of sensors to “track movement of a person
through a facility.” Again, GE’s system does not track movement of people. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶
46, 114-115; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 20. Moreover, to overcome a rejection of this claim, Hill-Rom
told the Patent Office that “[a] plurality of first sensors . . . would not be in communication with
each [sic] or have any way of noting movement of a person between a plurality of locations.
Therefore, any information gathered by the proposed plurality of first sensors 5 would not track
movement, but rather would be presence information.” Bosco Decl., Exhibit A (‘818 FH) at
188 (emphasis added); Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 115. Hill-Rom thus surrendered claim scope that would
otherwise cover sensors—such as those found in GE’s system—that track the present location of
a person rather than movement. Claim 43 also discloses a second set of sensors that
communicate with a master station, but in GE’s system, the second set of sensors communicates
with a reader, not a master station. Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 116; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 12-17. The reader

10

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 11 of 32 PageID# 447

and master station are different components, and Hill-Rom has not alleged that they are
equivalent.
Lastly, claim 43—like claims 1 and 37—also require the “zone” system that GE’s system
does not use. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 117-122; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 20-21. Hill-Rom again argued
during prosecution to overcome a rejection of this claim that a system using sensors that do not
know the difference between a patient contact zone and some other area is not covered by claim
43. Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 119. GE’s sensors do not detect or distinguish a patient contact zone from
any other zone and thus GE’s system does not infringe this claim. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 117-122;
Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 20-21.5
c.

The ’470 Patent

Hill-Rom alleges that GE’s Hand Hygiene System infringes independent claim 15 and
dependent claims 16 and 19 of the ‘470 Patent. Claim 15 discloses a computer program that can
“access a predetermined hygiene policy” setting out the requirements for hand-washing. But
GE’s system is not programmed to access a predetermined policy by, for example, allowing
software to access a database with information reflecting various hand-washing requirements.
Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 177-178; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 28. Even Dr. Felder acknowledged in his
declaration that GE’s system is pre-programmed with a time limit for washing hands, and he
otherwise does not identify any functionality in GE’s system that reflects any ability for it to
‘access a policy.’ Felder Decl. at ¶ 55. In this regard, Mr. Wildman misstates the GE system’s
functionality when he suggests that a facility can change the timing protocol; as Mr. Wallace
explained, this simply is not possible. Wildman Decl. at ¶ 33; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 28.

5

Because GE’s Hand Hygiene System does not infringe independent claim 43, it likewise does
not infringe any of the dependent claims. GE’s system does not infringe the asserted claims for
numerous additional reasons, as set forth in Dr. Tsouri’s declaration. Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 112-137.

11

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 12 of 32 PageID# 448

Claim 15 also requires monitoring contact between two items. See Claim 15 (disclosing
“an instance of contact between a first item and a second item . . . to detect compliance or noncompliance with the hygiene policy”). This limitation is wholly lacking from GE’s system—
simply put, GE’s system does not monitor contact between two items. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 180188; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 20, 25. In this regard, Dr. Felder’s analysis strains credibility when he
opines that the first “item” is a person and the second “item” is the soap dispenser. See Felder
Decl. at ¶¶ 56, 59. This argument is nonsensical because if the “second item” is the soap
dispenser, then the person would have to wash her hands after touching the soap dispenser. In
other words, the person would need to wash her hands immediately after washing her hands—a
never-ending loop of hand-washing. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 180-188. Not surprisingly, the claims,
specification, and prosecution history refute this tortured position by confirming that the “second
item” is not the soap dispenser. Id.
Hill-Rom in fact emphasized during the prosecution history—in order to overcome a
rejection of this claim—that the “second item” is equipment that can be moved around the
hospital: “Cohen’s [prior art] system is designed to communicate with a human user and not to
monitor movable inanimate objects such as hospital equipment. Cohen does not disclose or
suggest the possibility of adapting the disclosed system to track hygiene related to movable
inanimate objects, such as hospital equipment.” Bosco Decl., Exhibit B (‘470 FH) at 66; Tsouri
Decl. at ¶ 186. Thus, the soap dispenser is not the “second item,” and GE’s system otherwise
does not monitor contact between two items. Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 180-188; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 20,

12

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 13 of 32 PageID# 449

25. At least for these reasons, the GE Hand Hygiene System does not infringe claim 15 of the
‘470 Patent.6
d.

The ’544 Patent

Hill-Rom alleges that GE’s Hand Hygiene System infringes independent claim 1 and
dependent claims 5, 13, and 14 of the ‘544 Patent. Claim 1 requires a sensor that can detect the
presence of a person in a hand-washing area. Dr. Felder identifies GE’s reader as the claimed
“sensor,” but GE’s reader does not detect the presence of people, whether in a hand-washing area
or otherwise. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 212-220. Instead, GE’s system works as follows: Signposts in
hospital rooms continuously broadcast a periodic signal that is received by personnel badges, and
the badges are equipped with receivers that detect the infrared light from the signposts. Tsouri
Decl. at ¶¶ 32-36, 212-220; Wallace Decl. at ¶¶ 5-11. Tellingly, to overcome a rejection of claim
1 by the Patent Office, Hill-Rom argued that systems like GE’s are not covered by claim 1:
“[T]he EMU 140 continuously broadcasts a periodic signal into the monitored area so that when
a badge 150 enters the EMU 140’s broadcast area, the badge 150 receives the signals from the
EMU 140. Therefore, [the prior art] Cohen teaches that the badge 150 detects itself as being in a
monitored area, rather than a sensor detecting a badge in a monitored area.” Bosco Decl.,
Exhibit C (‘544 FH) at 73 (emphasis in original) Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 216-219. Thus, once again,
Hill-Rom told the Patent Office that its patent was different than systems that worked like GE’s
system and narrowed the scope of claim 1 to exclude the very way that GE’s system functions.
Id.

6

Because GE’s system does not infringe independent claim 15, it likewise does not infringe any
of the dependent claims. GE’s system does not infringe the asserted claims for numerous
additional reasons, as set forth in Dr. Tsouri’s declaration. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 176-196.

13

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 14 of 32 PageID# 450

Claim 1 also requires the hand-washing monitoring device to “generate a compliance
signal indicative of whether the person has or has not” washed her hands. GE’s system,
however, does not generate a signal if a person does not wash her hands. Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 222;
Wallace Decl. at ¶ 23. Thus, GE’s system does not infringe claim 1 for this additional reason.
Finally, claim 1 discloses a “combined signal” that is sent to the “master station,” the
combined signal containing the identification number of the personnel badge and information
indicating that the hand-washing device was used. The alleged benefit of the “combined signal”
is that the invention uses only one sensor to detect a person and to monitor hand-washing, not
two separate sensors as in the prior art: “[T]he presently claimed invention only requires one
sensor unit (e.g. 108) to implement both of these features. . . . Cohen only discloses and teaches
embodiments in which two monitoring units (130 and 140) are used. . . . There, it is explained
that Cohen’s monitor 140 detects the presence of the user by periodically broadcasting a signal
that is received by the badge 150, while another monitor, the monitor 130, determines whether
the user wearing the badge has performed the desired action.” Bosco Decl., Exhibit C (‘544 FH)
at 47-48 (emphasis in original) Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 217.
Hill-Rom further explained during prosecution that the signal combines bits of data
indicating hand-washing status with other bits of data indicating the identity of the caregiver, and
that these bits are combined into a single packet of data that is transmitted to the master station.
Bosco Decl., Exhibit C (‘544 FH) at 72; Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 225-226. Hill-Rom then amended
claim 1 to require a “combined signal,” in order to emphasize that the system “combines a
compliance signal and an identification signal and can be generated by a single sensor.” Bosco
Decl., Exhibit C (‘544 FH) at 26. But GE’s system does not have any such combined signal.
Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 49, 224-229; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 24. Instead, GE’s system functions like the

14

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 15 of 32 PageID# 451

prior art Cohen reference, sending separate signals from the hand-washing device and signals
from the badge. Id. These signals are not combined into a single packet of data, and instead, the
GE RTLS software must run a program against the separate data streams to determine
compliance. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 42-45, 49, 224-229; Wallace Decl. at ¶ 18-19, 24. At least for
these reasons, the GE Hand Hygiene System does not infringe claim 1 of the ‘544 Patent.7
In sum, GE’s Hand Hygiene System does not infringe any of the asserted patent claims.
At a minimum, there is a “substantial question” as to whether GE’s product contains every
element of the asserted claims. Because Hill-Rom cannot show a reasonable likelihood of
success on the merits, its motion should be denied.
2.

GE Does Not Induce or Contribute to Any Infringement

Because there is no direct infringement of any of the asserted claims, GE also does not
indirectly infringe the asserted patents under 35 U.S.C. § 271(b)-(c). See Limelight Networks,
Inc. v. Akamai Tech., Inc., ___ U.S. ___, slip. op. at 5 (June 2, 2014). With respect to induced
infringement, there is no evidence that GE specifically intended for its customers to infringe the
asserted patents. Hill-Rom alleges no facts to support its allegation that GE “actively and
knowingly aid[ed] and abet[ted] another’s direct infringement,” so its arguments must be
rejected. See PI Brief at 13-14; DSU Med. Corp. v. JMS Co., Ltd., 471 F.3d 1293, 1306 (Fed.
Cir. 2006) (en banc in relevant part). As to contributory infringement, the components of GE’s
system have substantial non-infringing uses. In fact, the majority of the components in GE’s
system have been in use since the 1990s—prior to when the applications leading to the asserted
patents were even filed—for purposes that have nothing to do with the asserted patents. See

7

Because GE’s system does not infringe independent claim 1, it likewise does not infringe any
of the dependent claims. GE’s system does not infringe the asserted claims for numerous
additional reasons, as set forth in Dr. Tsouri’s declaration. Tsouri Decl. at ¶¶ 207-236.

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 16 of 32 PageID# 452

Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 5. Indeed, the accused system uses RTLS technology to manage assets
such as hospital beds and wheelchairs, and these components were installed long before the
asserted patents even issued. Id.; see In Re Bill of Lading Transmission and Processing System
Patent Litigation, 681 F.3d 1323 at 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“For purposes of contributory
infringement, the inquiry focuses on whether the accused products can be used for purposes
other than infringement.”).

The Hill-Rom Patents Are Vulnerable To Invalidity Challenges
a.

Legal Overview

A patented invention is anticipated if “all of the elements and limitations of the claim are
described in a single prior art reference.” Hakim v. Cannon Avent Group, Plc, 479 F.3d 1313,
1319 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Disclosure in an anticipatory prior art reference can be either express or
inherent, and inherent disclosure can exist even if those of ordinary skill in the art at the time
were not cognizant of the disclosure. See Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Pharma. Prods., Inc., 471 F.3d
1363 (Fed. Cir., 2006) (“Inherent anticipation does not require that a person of ordinary skill in
the art at the time would have recognized the inherent disclosure.”) (internal citation and
quotation omitted). A reference anticipates a claim, moreover, if one of ordinary skill in the art
could use the disclosure to practice the invention without undue experimentation. Adv. Display
Sys., Inc. v. Kent State Univ., 212 F.3d 1272, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2000)
A claim is invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103 in several circumstances, including
(1) if all elements were present in the prior art, and a person of ordinary skill would have reason
to combine the prior art to reach the claimed invention, and (2) a person of ordinary skill in the
art would have reason to modify a particular piece or pieces of prior art to arrive at the claimed
invention. See KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 427 (2007). Under the “expansive
and flexible approach” the Supreme Court has mandated for combining and modifying prior art

16

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 17 of 32 PageID# 453

references to determine whether a claim is invalid as obvious, the Court has noted that when a
patent “‘simply arranges old elements with each performing the same function it had been known
to perform’ and yields no more than one would expect from such an arrangement, the
combination is obvious.” Id. at 417 (citation omitted).
b.

Under Hill-Rom’s Infringement Theory, the Asserted Claims Are
Invalid as Anticipated or Rendered Obvious by the Prior Art

If the asserted claims of the Hill-Rom patents are read broadly enough to cover GE’s
Hand Hygiene System, then those claims are anticipated or rendered obvious by several prior art
hand hygiene systems. One such system is disclosed in U.K. Patent Application GB 2,324,397 A
to Michael Goodier and Ivan Moore (“Goodier”). Bosco Decl., Exhibit D.8 Like GE’s system,
Goodier discloses a hand-hygiene system that requires employees to wash their hands within a
certain period of time after entering a room. Id. at 3, 6. In Goodier, one sensor is placed at the
entrance to the room, and another sensor is placed at a hand-washing station within the room. Id.
at 1-2, 4-5; Figs. 1 & 2. When an employee enters the room, the sensor at the entrance reads that
employee’s personal identification badge, and passes a corresponding signal to a central
processor. Id. at 5. If the sensor at the hand-washing station detects the employee’s badge and
the occurrence of hand washing, that sensor sends a corresponding signal to the central
processor. Id. The central processor keeps a record of all employee entries into the restricted
area and whether a hand washing has occurred on each entry. Id. at 4, 6-7.9

8

Goodier qualifies as prior art under at least 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), because it was published more
than one year before the earliest possible application date of the asserted patents.

9

The disclosure in Goodier is broad enough to cover hand hygiene in both the food preparation
and healthcare industries. See Tsouri Decl. ¶ 140.

17

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 18 of 32 PageID# 454

As explained by GE’s expert, Dr. Tsouri, under Hill-Rom’s theory of infringement
against GE’s system, Goodier anticipates or renders obvious all of the asserted claims.10 Tsouri
Decl. ¶¶ 138-171, 197-205, 237-246. With respect to the ‘818 patent, Goodier receives location
information and hand-washing information, determines whether a person who has entered a
room has washed her hands within a preset period of time, and updates compliance information
for that person. Id. ¶¶ 138-171. With respect to the ‘544 patent, Goodier discloses a system that
includes a sensor at a hand-washing device, identification badges, a hand-washing monitoring
device, a network, and a master station. Id. ¶¶ 237-246. And with respect to the ‘470 patent,
Goodier discloses software in a central processor that receives information identifying an
employee from an identification badge, receives information about the location of the employee
from the badge, receives information about the employee’s use of the hand-washing station,
determines whether the employee complied with a hygiene policy, and generates a report. Id. ¶¶
197-205. Accordingly, if Hill-Rom’s asserted claims are read broadly enough to cover GE’s
Hand Hygiene System, then there is at least a substantial question as to the validity of those
claims, and that substantial question precludes issuance of a preliminary injunction. See Helifix
Ltd. v. Blok-Lok, Ltd., 208 F.3d 1339, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“If the alleged infringer raises a
substantial question concerning validity, i.e., asserts an invalidity defense that the patentee
cannot prove ‘lacks substantial merit,’ the preliminary injunction should not issue.”).11
10

Because Goodier was not considered by the Patent Office during prosecution of any of the
asserted patents, it will be easier at trial for GE to sustain its burden of proving that the asserted
claims are invalid. See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P’ship, 131 S. Ct. 2238, 2251 (2011) (“[I]f the
PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment may lose significant force[,
a]nd, concomitantly, the challenger’s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity defense by
clear and convincing evidence may be easier to sustain.”).
11

Certain asserted claims are also vulnerable to invalidity challenges under 35 U.S.C. § 101,
because they are directed to the unpatentable abstract idea of monitoring whether a person has
washed her hands. See Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 4303 (2014)

18

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 19 of 32 PageID# 455

c.

The Asserted Claims of the ‘470 Patent Are Furthermore Invalid as
Indefinite

Hill-Rom is further unlikely to succeed on the merits regarding the ‘470 Patent because
claim 15 and the claims depending therefrom are indefinite. See Tsouri Decl. at ¶ 206. A patent
claim is invalid as indefinite under 35 U.S.C. §112, ¶2 if, when “read in light of the specification
delineating the patent, and the prosecution history, [it] fail[s] to inform, with reasonable
certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.” Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig
Instruments, Inc., 572 U.S. ___, slip. op. at 1, 134 S. Ct. 2120 (June 2, 2014). Here, claim 15
identifies five separate “items”: “an item” that is cleaned, “an item” that is identified, “an item”
that is tracked, and “a first item” and “a second item” that are in contact with each other. Tsouri
Decl. at ¶ 206. On its face, the claim does not define whether any of these “items” are in any way
related to each other. Id. It is impossible to tell, for example, if the “item” that is cleaned is the
“first item,” the “second item,” or a different “item” altogether. Id. The same applies to any of
the other identified “an item” limitations. Id. Hill-Rom’s infringement theory points out the
problem. Hill-Rom argues that “an item” that is cleaned, “an item” that is identified, and “an
item” that is tracked are all referring to “a first item,” despite the fact that the claim does not so
provide. The claims are so vague that there is no reason why one, two, or three of the “an item”
limitations could not refer to “a second item” or some other “item” or separate “items.” As a
consequence, one of ordinary skill in the art is unable to determine the scope of claim 15, or any
of the claims that depend therefrom, with reasonable certainty. See Regents of the Univ. of Minn.
v. AGA Med. Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144194, *43-46 (D. Minn. Dec. 14, 2011) (“[T]he
Court must identify what the phrase modifies, and that is an impossible task. Needless to say, if

(finding claims directed to abstract idea unpatentable); Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus
Labs., Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1289, 1293 (2012) (finding that “abstract ideas are not patentable”).

19

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 20 of 32 PageID# 456

the Court cannot identify the thing that [the invention operates upon], neither can a potential
infringer.”). Thus, Hill-Rom is unlikely to succeed on the merits for this additional reason.
B.

Hill-Rom Has Not Shown Irreparable Harm

Even if Hill-Rom had shown a likelihood of success on the merits—which it has not—
Hill-Rom would still not be entitled to any injunctive relief at least for the following reasons: (1)
Hill-Rom delayed in bringing suit; (2) GE’s continued sale of its Hand Hygiene System during
the pendency of this litigation would have little impact, if any, on Hill-Rom’s current or future
business; (3) Hill-Rom’s reputation and goodwill are not dependent upon sales of hand-hygiene
systems; (4) sales of hand-hygiene systems do not drive sales of other products; and (5) any
losses Hill-Rom may sustain during the pendency of this litigation are easily quantifiable. See
generally J. Malackowski Decl., submitted herewith.
“[T]he irreparable harm inquiry seeks to measure harms that no damages payment,
however great, could address.” Celsis In Vitro, Inc. v. CellzDirect, Inc., 664 F.3d 922, 930 (Fed.
Cir. 2012). Demonstrating irreparable harm requires a “clear showing that [plaintiff] is at risk of
irreparable harm, which entails showing a likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable
injury.” Apple, 695 F.3d at 1374 (quotations omitted) (emphasis added); Direx Israel, Ltd. v.
Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991) (“Moreover, the required
‘irreparable harm’ must be ‘neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.’”). No
presumption of irreparable harm arises even if a plaintiff proves likelihood of success on the
merits. See Automated Merchandising Sys., Inc. v. Crane Co., 357 F. App’x 297, 301 (Fed. Cir.
2009) (describing the presumption of irreparable harm as “discarded” in the wake of the
Supreme Court’s eBay decision). As demonstrated below and in the supporting expert
declaration of James Malackowski, Hill-Rom has not shown any irreparable harm.

1.

Hill-Rom’s Delay in Seeking a Preliminary Injunction is Fatal to Its Claim
of Irreparable Harm

As an initial matter, Hill-Rom is not entitled to a preliminary injunction because it
substantially delayed in bringing its motion. Indeed, a patentee’s delay in seeking injunctive
relief belies the notion that it would suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction. See T.J. Smith
& Nephew Ltd. v. Consolidated Medical Equipment, Inc., 821 F.2d 646, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1987)
(delay is “incompatible” with irreparable harm”); see also Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics
Co., Ltd., 678 F.3d 1314 at 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (delay suggests that “the patentee is not
irreparably harmed by the infringement”); Nutrition 21 v. U.S., 930 F.2d 867, 872 (Fed. Cir.
1991) (delay suggests a lack of irreparable harm).
Specifically, Hill-Rom claims to have brought its motion based on its discovery of GE’s
Hand Hygiene System at the Summerville, South Carolina, facility. See PI Brief at 5. While
Hill-Rom does not disclose precisely when it learned of GE’s system at Summerville, GE has
been marketing its Hand Hygiene System since 2009, and by November 2012, GE had already
installed approximately 270 sidecars (and 181 staff badges) in the Summerville facility.
Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 8, 13. GE also openly distributed its information sheets at Summerville
throughout the 2012 time period. Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶¶ 17-18. Moreover, GE’s Hand Hygiene
System is not discreet—the most open and obvious evidence of the installation is the sidecar,
which is approximately 8” by 5”, and is located next to each soap or alcohol dispenser.
Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 12. The system also uses staff badges, which beep every time they receive
a signal from a dispenser. Id. GE’s system was also described in the press in numerous
outlets—including Reuters and the Charleston Regional Business Journal—starting at least in
April 2013. Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 19. Finally, the Summerville facility buys products from Hill-

21

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 22 of 32 PageID# 458

Rom, including at least Hill-Rom’s hospital beds and Nurse Call system. Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶
14. Thus, Hill-Rom has known about or should have known about GE’s system for years.
If Hill-Rom’s alleged irreparable harm is as urgent as it claims, then Hill-Rom should
have filed its injunction request years ago, and certainly no later than a year ago when it claims
to have learned that GE had entered this market. See McMullin Decl. at ¶ 34 (“In approximately
the Spring of 2013, Hill-Rom learned that GE was entering the nascent market for RTLS-based
hand hygiene systems . . . .”). Indeed, even if Hill-Rom somehow did not know about GE’s
entrance into the market in 2009, its installation in Summerville in 2012, or the press reports in
early 2013, Hill-Rom undisputedly had actual knowledge of GE’s system by “the Spring of
2013.” But Hill-Rom offers no explanation for its delay in seeking a preliminary injunction.
Courts have found that delays of as little as two months are fatal to a preliminary injunction
request. See Novozymes A/S v. Danisco A/S, 2010 WL 3783682, at *4 (W.D. Wis. 2010)
(finding that the patentee’s two month delay in seeking a preliminary injunction further showed
it would not suffer irreparable harm in having to wait for a full trial as the court had a fast
docket, and therefore the full trial would be set a mere few months later); see also High Tech
Medical Instrumentation, Inc. v. New Image Indus., Inc., 49 F.3d 1551, 1557 (Fed.Cir.1995)
(“[a]bsent a good explanation, ... 17 months is a substantial period of delay that militates against
the issuance of a preliminary injunction by demonstrating that there is no apparent urgency to the
request for injunctive relief.”); Capital Machine Co., Inc. v. Miller Veneers, Inc., 2010 WL
3000769, at *1 (S.D. Ind. 2010) (denying patentee’s motion for a preliminary injunction without
even considering the likelihood of success on the merits because the court found that the patentee
could not show irreparable harm where it, inter alia, waited for over a year after filing the suit to

22

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 23 of 32 PageID# 459

move for a preliminary injunction). Here, Hill-Rom’s delay in bringing suit fatally undermines
its allegations of urgency.
Moreover, the earliest of Hill-Rom’s patents issued over ten years ago in 2004; Hill
Rom’s insistence that “[t]he window of opportunity for Hill-Rom to realize the value of its
patents is now” is thus difficult to reconcile with its delay in bringing suit and even longer delay
in entering the relevant market. PI Brief at 19 (emphasis in original). Hill-Rom’s motion should
thus be denied for these reasons.
2.

Hill-Rom’s Lost Sales and Market Share Arguments Are Purely
Speculative

Next, Hill-Rom presents no evidence of actual past or future lost sales or contracts.
Instead, Hill-Rom only speculates over the potential for an unknown number of lost sales in
unknown locations at unknown times to unknown customers. But speculative opportunity loss
and the “loss” of potential, unknown, future market share is not a ground for injunctive relief.
See, e.g., Automated Merchandising Systems, Inc., 357 F. App’x at 301 (reversing district court
finding of irreparable harm since the evidence showed only a “speculative loss” of sales and
market share); see also Nutrition 21, 930 F.2d at 871 (“[N]either the difficulty of calculating
losses in market share, nor speculation that such losses might occur, amount to proof of special
circumstances justifying the extraordinary relief of an injunction prior to trial.”).
The sole support for Hill-Rom’s claim of any lost sales is the following statement from
Hill-Rom’s fact witness, Mr. McMullin: “Hill-Rom . . . is aware of at least one instance in which
it initially made a sale, but the sale was then cancelled when the healthcare facility was told by
HCA management that it was required to use GE’s AgileTrac system.” McMullin Decl. at ¶ 37.
But this statement—aside from being rank, inadmissible hearsay—is factually misleading at least
because (1) HCA’s facilities have no obligation to use GE’s system, and (2) Hill-Rom admits

23

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 24 of 32 PageID# 460

that it has enjoyed its own “success promoting its RTLS-based hand hygiene system within some
segments of HCA.” See Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 20 (explaining that HCA’s contract with GE does
not obligate HCA to purchase any of its Hand Hygiene Systems); McMullin Decl. at ¶ 31
(acknowledging Hill-Rom’s success with HCA). Even if Mr. McMullin’s statement was true
and admissible, it would be vastly insufficient to warrant relief as extraordinary as a preliminary
injunction. See, e.g., Automated Merchandising, 357 F. App’x at 300-301 (“lost sales standing
alone are insufficient to prove irreparable harm” (internal quotations omitted)).
Moreover, the type of evidence that Hill-Rom offered—declarations replete with
speculation and hearsay—is precisely what this District rejected in Dynamic Manufacturing. See
Dynamic Mfg. Inc. v. Craze, 1998 WL 241201 at *4 (E.D. Va. Feb. 23, 1998) (denying
preliminary injunction where plaintiff’s only evidence of harm—lost sales—was one witness’s
anecdotal testimony of a customer choosing between products, which was deemed “speculative
at best”). Other courts have also repeatedly rejected such speculation in denying preliminary
injunction motions. See Mike’s Train House, Inc. v. Broadway Ltd. Imports, LLC, 708 F. Supp.
2d 527, 533 (D. Md. 2010) (denying motion where plaintiff’s evidence—an affidavit asserting
lost investments, “lo[ss] of existing customers and potential customers,” and market share
erosion—were insufficient to prove irreparable harm); MicroAire Surgical Instruments, LLC v.
Arthrex, Inc., 726 F. Supp. 2d 604, 639 (W.D. Va. 2010) (“Therefore, there clearly must be more
than the potential for lost sales as a result of a competitor product entering the market to establish
irreparable harm.”) (denying preliminary injunction where plaintiff speculated over potential lost
sales); Automated Merchandising Sys., Inc., 357 Fed. Appx. at 300-01 (noting that the affidavit
by plaintiff’s president only identified the loss of one customer, which is insufficient loss of
market share to warrant an injunction); Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Grip–Pak, Inc., 906 F.2d 679

24

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 25 of 32 PageID# 461

(Fed. Cir. 1990) (finding potential lost sales insufficient to show irreparable harm and nothing
that to find otherwise “would require a finding of irreparable harm to every
manufacture/patentee, regardless of circumstances.”).
Hill-Rom cannot prove any lost sales or market share because there are virtually no sales
to lose. For instance, there are currently almost six thousand hospitals in the United States, but
GE has installed its AgileTrac™ software system in only fifty-three total hospitals. Dirksmeier
Decl. at ¶¶ 9, 30. Out of those 53 hospitals, only five have installed GE’s Hand Hygiene System.
Id. GE presently has no sales orders for its Hand Hygiene System in any HCA hospitals.
Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 30. Hill-Rom also specifically argues that it is concerned about being
disadvantaged over GE’s relationship with HCA, but there are only 165 HCA hospitals, a small
percentage (less than 3%) of the total market. Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶¶ 9, 30. Hill-Rom’s concern
is also belied by the fact that Hill-Rom has in fact made a hand hygiene system sale at an HCA
hospital. McMullin Decl. at ¶¶ 32-33; see also id. at ¶ 42 (“HCA and Hill-Rom have had
ongoing discussions regarding expansion of usage . . . .”), ¶ 43 (“Hill-Rom believes that [it] . . .
could increase substantially its annual sales to HCA.”). Hill-Rom can thus hardly be heard to
complain that it will be unable to secure a contract with HCA due to GE’s alleged infringement
when Hill-Rom has already secured a contract with HCA and has positive expectations of
substantial future sales.
Next, although Hill-Rom claims that the hand hygiene market is a multi-million dollar
business, in reality, GE’s limited sales of its Hand Hygiene System has netted total revenues of
only $357,412.66. Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶¶ 23, 31. Outside of GE and Hill-Rom, at least fifteen
other companies are currently competing in the hand hygiene monitoring market. Dirksmeier
Decl. at ¶ 21; Malackowski Decl. at ¶ 12. Although there is no evidence that Hill-Rom—rather

25

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 26 of 32 PageID# 462

than its fifteen competitors—would have sold its hand-hygiene system to GE’s five customers
but for GE’s presence in the market, even assuming that Hill-Rom would have made those sales,
Hill-Rom’s lost profits could be no more than $357,412.66.
Hill-Rom’s allegations concerning lost ancillary sales are also purely speculative and
unsupported by the evidence. In fact, GE’s hand hygiene product has never driven any sales of
any RTLS-enabled installations. Compare Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 25 (“The hand hygiene product
has never driven any GEHC RTLS-enabled installations.”) with McMullin Decl. at ¶ 20 (“HillRom anticipates that it will make significant additional sales of its RTLS and other proprietary
information technology solutions and product portfolio if it is able to sell its RTLS-based hand
hygiene system.”); see also Malackowski Decl. at ¶¶ 22-25. The discrepancy in this evidence
alone is sufficient to raise a substantial question as to Hill-Rom’s allegations.
Finally, even if Hill-Rom’s declarations were probative, they prove nothing about
whether Hill-Rom will lose any future sales to GE. Indeed, since Hill-Rom has not chosen to
enter this market in any significant form, it has no market share to lose, nor does it have any
sales data from which the Court could reasonably infer some baseline level of consumer demand
for its products. Hill-Rom therefore cannot present any credible evidence that, absent an
injunction, it would make any sales at all, much less that some reasonably ascertainable portion
of these hypothetical sales would be lost to GE. In this regard, Hill-Rom’s expert, Dr. Reiff, is
simply wrong that “the patent-holder and the [alleged] infringer are head-to-head competitors for
key contracts.” Decl. at ¶ 30. Indeed, given Hill-Rom’s minimal market share and the fifteen
other participants in addition to GE in the hand-hygiene market, Hill-Rom’s allegation that it can
ascribe any asserted diversion of customers to GE with any degree of certainty is fanciful.

(Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that the Court “do[es] not doubt that generic competition will impact
Abbott’s sales . . . but that alone does not establish that Abbott’s harm will be irreparable.”).

Hill-Rom’s Price Erosion and Loss of Reputation and Goodwill
Arguments Are Likewise Unsupported by the Evidence

Nor does Hill-Rom provide any evidence to support its speculative claim of irreparable
harm in the form of price erosion and loss of goodwill. See Malackowski Decl. at ¶¶ 26-29.
Because Hill-Rom sat on its invention for over a decade, Hill-Rom has no customer goodwill to
lose, nor does it have an established pricing structure that GE’s sales could conceivably erode.
Such purely speculative injury is not the basis for an irreparable harm finding. Automated
Merchandising Sys., Inc., 357 Fed. Appx. at 300-01 (vacating preliminary injunction and finding
that plaintiff’s price erosion theory was supported only by conclusory statement that it was
possible). Moreover, to protect Hill-Rom’s alleged reputation and goodwill and prevent any
alleged price erosion, Hill-Rom would need to seek injunctive relief against its fifteen other
competitors, which Hill-Rom has not done. Thus, Hill-Rom’s reputation and price erosion
arguments are without merit.
4.

Hill-Rom’s Infrastructure Investment and Switching Cost Arguments Are
Overstated

Hill-Rom also vastly overstates the infrastructure and switching costs for the accused
technology. See PI Brief at 18; McMullin Decl. at ¶ 26. Hand-hygiene systems are merely addon products to existing RTLS infrastructures, and the hygiene system can be switched to another
infrastructure with an adapter. See Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶¶ 5-7, 10, 11. Moreover, the reasons for
the slowness in hospitals acquiring hand-hygiene solutions is not due to infrastructure costs, but
rather due to the highly competitive nature of the market. Dirksmeier Decl. at ¶ 26;
Malackowski Decl. at ¶¶ 17-21. As noted above, there are presently seventeen competitors
vying to supply hand-hygiene systems.

5.

Monetary Damages Will Sufficiently Compensate Hill-Rom for Any
Alleged Infringement

Hill-Rom’s allegation that monetary damages will be insufficient to compensate HillRom for any alleged harm is wholly without merit. First, “there is no presumption that money
damages will be inadequate in connection with a motion for an injunction pendente lite. Some
evidence and reasoned analysis for that inadequacy should be proffered.” Nutrition 21, 930 F.2d
at 871–72 (emphasis in original) (vacating grant of a preliminary injunction where only evidence
was speculation as to the loss of market share). In fact, the Federal Circuit has stated that lost
sales alone are presumed compensable through damages. Automated Merchandising Sys., Inc.,
357 Fed. Appx. at 301 (vacating preliminary injunction: “Lost sales (without more) are presumed
to be compensable through damages, so they do not require injunctive relief.”).
Any alleged harm that Hill-Rom has suffered is easily quantifiable with monetary
damages. Malackowski Decl. at ¶¶ 30-36; see Pergo, Inc. v. Faus Grp., Inc., 401 F. Supp. 2d
515, 527-29 (E.D.N.C. 2005) (denying preliminary injunction where even assuming even that
evidence of lost sales was sufficiently shown, this harm could be easily calculated and thus was
not irreparable). Here, most of GE’s revenue is generated from the initial sale of the system
installation, a license fee for the software, and the various hardware components. Dirksmeier
Decl. at ¶ 24. Subsequent revenue streams include a yearly fee for maintenance and support
services for the hardware and software. Id. All of these amounts are readily quantifiable, and
Hill-Rom’s lost profits cannot be more than GE’s $357,412.66 in revenue. Id. at ¶¶ 23-24. GE
has no future sales that Hill-Rom could have otherwise made, and Hill-Rom has already secured
a sales relationship with HCA. Thus, Hill-Rom has not and will not sustain any damages that
cannot be quantified.

6.

The Only Hill-Rom Parties That Could Suffer Irreparable Harm Have No
Standing to Assert the Patents

Finally, Hill-Rom’s complaint alleges that Hill-Rom Services (HRS) has all property
rights to the asserted patents, and that Hill-Rom Manufacturing (HRM) and Hill-Rom Company
(HRC) are the parties that manufacture and distribute the systems that use the asserted patents.
Complaint at ¶¶ 10, 12, 14. Thus, HRS, as a mere patent-holding entity, cannot possibly be
suffering irreparable harm because it does not make or distribute any competing products. And
HRM and HRC—as manufacturers and distributers—have no standing to seek injunctive relief
because they do not own the asserted patents. WiAV Solutions LLC v. Motorola, Inc., 631 F.3d
1257, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Sicom Sys., Ltd. v. Agilent Technologies, Inc., 427 F.3d 971, 976
(Fed. Cir. 2005). Because the only party with possible standing in this case—HRS—cannot
possibly be suffering any harm, Hill-Rom’s motion should be denied for this additional reason.
C.

The Balance of Hardships Does Not Weigh in Hill-Rom’s Favor

The balance of the hardships does not weigh in Hill-Rom’s favor, which is another,
independent basis to deny Hill-Rom’s request. See Winter, 555 U.S. at 24. First, Hill-Rom
argues that GE is a large company that sells many products; but this factor weighs in GE’s favor
because it shows GE’s ability to satisfy any judgment. See Dynamic Mfg. Inc. v. Craze, 1998 WL
241201 at *13 (E.D. Va. Feb. 23, 1998) (denying preliminary injunction in part because
defendant would be able to pay any damages). Moreover, Hill-Rom itself is a large company
that sells many products, so this factor is neutral at best. See, e.g., PI Brief at 22 (identifying
Hill-Rom’s other product lines, including NurseCall, WatchChild, and hospital beds);
Malackowski Decl. at ¶ 14. Indeed, Hill-Rom’s sales of its competing hand-washing monitoring
product are only 0.3% of its overall revenues. Id. Finally, aside from its failure to identify any
actual lost sales, Hill-Rom does not allege that absent a preliminary injunction, Hill-Rom will

29

Case 2:14-cv-00187-RGD-LRL Document 40 Filed 06/23/14 Page 30 of 32 PageID# 466

have to change any of its business plans, layoff its employees, discontinue any products, or
otherwise do anything but carry out its business as usual. Thus, Hill-Rom provides no evidence
of any actual harm that outweighs disrupting GE’s business while this litigation is pending.
D.

The Public Interest Does Not Support Granting a Preliminary Injunction

Finally, the public interest does not support an injunction. First, the public has a strong
interest in having a wide choice of products. See Nano-Second Tech. Co. v. Dynaflex Int’l, 2011
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111836 at *13 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2011) (The “public interest in continued
market competition for these products disfavors a preliminary injunction.”); Wachovia Sec., LLC
v. Gates, WL 1803612 at *3 (E.D. Va. Apr. 21, 2008) (denying preliminary injunction as against
the public interest where the injunction would prevent customers from engaging in the free
market of relevant products and services). Second, GE’s product saves lives. This District has
found that with important healthcare services, entering an injunction “would clearly be against
the interests of public health and safety.” Hampton Univ. v. Accred. Council For Pharm. Edu.,
611 F. Supp. 2d 557, 569-72 (E.D. Va. 2009) (denying a preliminary injunction even though
most factors weighed in its favor due to the “weighty public interests at stake” where the “case
involves medical professionals . . . who are responsible for preparing and dispensing life-saving
(and, in some cases of error, life-threatening) medications in hospitals”). Here, Hill-Rom alleges
that as many as 75,000 people die annually from healthcare-associated infections and that handhygiene compliance “translates to human lives saved.” PI Brief at 2-4. The public interest thus
cannot be served by an injunction on life-saving products.
V.

CONCLUSION
Hill-Rom has not shown that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction. GE has raised

substantial questions of non-infringement and invalidity, and Hill-Rom failed to put forth
sufficient evidence of irreparable harm. For these reasons, Hill-Rom’s motion should be denied.
