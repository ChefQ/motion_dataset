Case No. 1:14-cv-00112-RJ-CG

PLAINTIFF WILDEARTH GUARDIANS’ RESPONSE TO
FEDERAL DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR VOLUNTARY REMAND
Plaintiff WildEarth Guardians (“Guardians”) initiated this litigation in 20131 to remedy
the chronic failure of the Federal Defendants to address the potentially significant environmental
impacts of coal mining at the San Juan Mine in northwest New Mexico and to involve the public
in their mining-related decision in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act
(“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4231 et seq. In approving the San Juan Mining Plan challenged in this
1

The claims here originated in WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE, 104 F. Supp. 3d 1208 (D. Colo.
2015), as part of a challenge to seven Mining Plans for coal mines in four different states. The
court there severed and transferred the San Juan Mine claims to this Court and the Spring Creek
Mine claims to the District of Montana, retaining claims related to two mining plans for
Colorado mines. Guardians prevailed on the merits in the Districts of Colorado and Montana.
Guardians submitted WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE to this Court as supplemental authority on
May 11, 2015. ECF Doc. 67. Guardians submitted WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE, 2016 WL
259285 (D. Mont. Jan. 21, 2016), to this Court as supplemental authority on May 4, 2016. ECF
Doc. 87. This opinion accepted most of the Magistrate Judge’s recommendations found in
WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE, 2015 WL 6442724 (D. Mont. Oct. 23, 2015) (Magistrate
Findings and Recommendations), with some modifications to the recommended remedy as
explained herein.

litigation, Federal Defendants failed to comply with NEPA in two specific ways. First, Federal
Defendants failed to provide the public with any notice of or opportunity to participate in the
NEPA process for the decision approving the San Juan Mining Plan and, instead, opted to
conduct the NEPA process for the Mining Plan wholly within the confines of the Office of
Surface Mining’s Denver office. ECF Doc. 40 ¶ 50. Second, Federal Defendants failed to take a
hard look at potentially significant environmental impacts, in particular, impacts to air quality
from the expansion of coal mining at the San Juan Mine. To support approval of the Mining
Plan, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement prepared a one-page Finding
of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”). The FONSI purported to analyze the environmental
impacts of expanded coal mining operations at the San Juan Mine, but did nothing more than
reference existing NEPA and non-NEPA documents from nearly a decade earlier, and rely on
them for analysis of the environmental impacts of additional mining. AR 11 (Mining Plan
FONSI). Federal Defendants made no effort to evaluate whether the decade-old documents they
relied on were relevant to or sufficient for assessing impacts of mining additional coal from San
Juan Mine almost 10 years later.
Federal Defendants seek a voluntary remand of the challenged Mining Plan approval to
prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) analyzing the Mining Plan’s impacts
pursuant to NEPA. Federal Defendants propose to complete this analysis in three years, and
request that mining continue under the challenged Plan during the remand. ECF Doc. 91 (July
18, 2016). Guardians does not oppose remanding the challenged decision to the agency to
prepare an EIS; however, for the reasons discussed below, Guardians respectfully requests that
the Court: (1) impose additional reasonable conditions on the remand Order to ensure the timely
completion of the EIS —specifically, deferred vacatur of the Mining Plan and quarterly progress

reports to the Court by Federal Defendants, (2) declare that Guardians is a prevailing party, and
(3) retain jurisdiction over this case to enforce the remand Order.
ARGUMENT
I.

If the Court Remands the Decision, the Court Should Impose a Deferred Vacatur
Requirement Consistent with Remedies Ordered in Similar Cases.
Federal Defendants request remand without vacatur of their Mining Plan approval

because the Mine represents it would be harmed by immediate vacatur of the Mining Plan. ECF
Docs. 91 at 11-12, 92-1 at 4-7. Federal Defendants also cite to Guardians’ similar mining plan
challenges in the Districts of Colorado and Montana where the courts ruled in Guardians’ favor
on the merits and ordered Federal Defendants to perform NEPA analyses for the challenged
mining plans without immediately vacating the Plans. ECF Doc. 91 at 11. Although the courts in
those cases did not order immediate vacatur of the challenged mining plans, which would have
resulted in immediate cessation of mining on federal leases covered by the challenged plan, the
courts imposed both a time frame for completion of the NEPA analyses and deferred ordering
vacatur of the mining plans until the close of the time period for completing the NEPA analyses.
If the Court grants Federal Defendants’ Motion, Guardians requests the same conditions here.
In WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE, 104 F. Supp. 3d 1208 (D. Colo. 2015) (“WildEarth
Guardians I”), Guardians challenged Federal Defendants’ approvals of two mining plans
expanding mining of federal coal at two Colorado mines, claiming Federal Defendants failed to
comply with NEPA in the same manner alleged in this case. Ruling in Guardians’ favor on all
claims, the court there ordered Federal Defendants to complete a NEPA analysis in 120 days and
deferred entering a vacatur order at that time. Id. at 1232. However, the court also ordered that:
If this process has not been completed within the 120-day window, then an order of
vacatur will be immediately effective absent further court order based upon very good
cause shown.

Case 1:14-cv-00112-RJ-CG Document 95 Filed 08/02/16 Page 4 of 9

Id. Federal Defendants completed the court-ordered NEPA analysis and issued a new mining
plan approval within the 120-day time period, rendering vacatur unnecessary.2
In WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE, 2015 WL 6442724 (D. Mont. Oct. 23, 2015)
(“WildEarth Guardians II”), Guardians challenged Federal Defendants’ approval of a mining
plan for the Spring Creek Mine in Montana, alleging similar violations of NEPA. Ruling in
Guardians’ favor on all claims and guided by the remedy fashioned in WildEarth Guardians I,
the Magistrate Judge there made the following recommendations as to remedy:
. . . that vacatur be deferred for a period of 180 days from the date of the final order . . .
[and] that Federal Defendants, during this time period, be required to correct NEPA
violations by preparing an updated environmental assessment, taking a hard look at the
direct and indirect environmental effects of the [Spring Creek] mining plan amendment,
and complying with applicable public notice requirements.
Id. at *9. The District Judge accepted the Magistrate Judge’s recommended remedy with respect
to deferred vacatur, modified the remedy to allow Federal Defendants 240 days to complete a
new NEPA analysis, added the requirement that Federal Defendants file monthly status reports
with the court within the 240-day period, and allowed Federal Defendants to “seek leave to
extend the 240-day deadline upon a showing of good cause.” WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE,
2016 WL 259285, at *3 (D. Mont. Jan. 21, 2016). According to Federal Defendants’ most recent
status report filed in the District of Montana on July 21, 2016, the NEPA process for the
environmental assessment remains on schedule for completion within the court-ordered
deadline.3 WildEarth Guardians v. OSMRE, Case No. 1:14-cv-00013, Dkt. 150 (D. Mont.).

2

As Federal Defendants explain in note 3 of their Motion, the Tenth Circuit vacated the district
court judgment in WildEarth Guardians I on mootness grounds following Federal Defendants’
completion of new court-ordered NEPA analyses and issuance of new decisions for the
challenged mining plans. ECF Doc. 91 at 9.

In addition to WildEarth Guardians I and II, Federal Defendants also cite to Cook Inletkeeper
v. EPA, 400 Fed. Appx. 239, 241 (9th Cir. 2010), and Def. of Wildlife v. Jackson, 791 F. Supp.
4

Case 1:14-cv-00112-RJ-CG Document 95 Filed 08/02/16 Page 5 of 9

In fashioning appropriate remedies in WildEarth Guardians I and II, both courts
recognized that remand with vacatur is a typical remedy in Administrative Procedure Act cases
and that courts have the discretion to fashion an alternative remedy on equitable grounds.
WildEarth Guardians I, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 1231; WildEarth Guardians II, 2015 WL 6442724, at
*8. Both courts applied the test for vacatur adopted by the Ninth and D.C. Circuits that balances
the seriousness of the agency’s errors with “the disruptive consequences of an interim change
that may itself be changed” to determine that immediate vacatur of the mining plans was not
warranted and instead deferred vacatur to provide incentive for Federal Defendants to complete
new NEPA analyses in a timely manner. Id. at 1231; id. at *8-9.
If the Court grants Federal Defendants’ Motion here, remand coupled with deferred
vacatur of the Mining Plan and quarterly status reports to the Court is appropriate and consistent
with the remedies ordered by courts in other districts dealing with similar mining plan
challenges. In their Motion, Federal Defendants have committed to completing an EIS for the
San Juan Mining Plan in three years, thus an Order deferring vacatur of the Mining Plan to a
point three years in the future would not immediately result in any of the harms to mining
operations or mine workers articulated in Federal Defendants’ Motion or Intervenor’s
declaration. ECF Docs. 91 at 11, 92-1 at 4-7. Mining will not cease at the San Juan Mine nor will
mining operations be otherwise affected if the Court issues an Order that includes deferred

2d 96, 118-19 (D.D.C. 2011), as examples of where courts granted an agency’s request for a
voluntary remand without imposing vacatur of the challenged decisions. Dkt. 91 at 11. However,
neither of these cases speak to the issue of whether deferred vacatur pending an agency’s
compliance with the terms of a remand order is appropriate. Therefore, these cases are inapposite
for the issues before this Court. WildEarth Guardians I and II are directly analogous to the
current case and, therefore, provide relevant guidance in crafting a remand Order.
5

Case 1:14-cv-00112-RJ-CG Document 95 Filed 08/02/16 Page 6 of 9

vacatur.4 Indeed, the possibility of vacatur would not even arise until 2019 at the earliest. By
2019, Federal Defendants will know if completion of the EIS is likely to be delayed, and for
good cause, could seek an extension of the EIS deadline from the Court, as allowed by the courts
in WildEarth Guardians I and II.
Federal Defendants have timely complied with court orders in WildEarth Guardians I
and II, avoiding vacatur in WildEarth Guardians I and on track to avoid vactur in WildEarth
Guardians II. Accordingly, it follows here that Federal Defendants will make every effort to
timely comply with a court-ordered deadline for completion of an EIS within three years
incentivized by the prospect of vacatur of the Mining Plan for a missed deadline. Given Federal
Defendants’ compliance with similar court orders in other mining plan cases, actual vacatur of
the San Juan Mining Plan (and the cessation of mining activities) in the future would be highly
unlikely.
II.

If the Court Declines to Impose Deferred Vacatur on the Remand Order, the Court
Should Set a More Expeditious Time Frame for Completion of the EIS.
Deferred vacatur should be a necessary component of any remand Order to ensure that

Federal Defendants satisfy their commitment to complete an EIS for the Mining Plan within
three years. If, however, the Court declines to include deferred vacatur in its remand Order, then
Guardians asks the Court to consider imposing a more expeditious time frame for completion of
the EIS, requiring completion of the EIS and a new decision within two years of the date of the
Order.

4

Deferred vacatur is consistent with Federal Defendants’ request that the Court maintain the
“status quo” of mining during the pendency of the remand. Dkt. 91 at 11. Vacatur of the San
Juan Mining Plan, and its attendant disruption of mining operations, would only become a
concrete reality if Federal Defendants fail to follow through with their commitment to complete
an EIS for the Mining Plan, and do not obtain an extension of the deadline from the Court on a
showing of good cause.

Case 1:14-cv-00112-RJ-CG Document 95 Filed 08/02/16 Page 7 of 9

Guardians has already been harmed by Federal Defendants’ approval of the San Juan
Mining Plan in the absence of a compliant NEPA analysis and public involvement. As a
procedural statute, NEPA’s fundamental purpose is to influence the agency’s decisionmaking
process “by focusing the [federal] agency’s attention on the environmental consequences of a
proposed project,” so as to “ensure[ ] that important effects will not be overlooked or
underestimated only to be discovered after resources have been committed or the die otherwise
cast.” Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989). The “assessment
of all ‘reasonably foreseeable’ impacts must occur at the earliest practicable point, and must take
place before an ‘irretrievable commitment of resources’ is made.” New Mexico ex rel.
Richardson v. BLM, 565 F.3d 683, 718 (10th Cir. 2009); 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(v); 40 C.F.R.
§§ 1501.2, 1502.22. “[W]hen a decision to which NEPA obligations attach is made without the
informed environmental consideration that NEPA requires, the harm that NEPA intends to
prevent has been suffered.” Sierra Club v. Marsh, 872 F.2d 497, 500 (1st Cir. 1989) (citations
omitted).
Accordingly, Guardians asks the Court to impose an expeditious time frame for
completion of the EIS because mining on the lease subject to the challenged Mining Plan has
commenced, and will continue throughout the duration of the NEPA analysis. In the absence of
deferred vacatur, a two-year time frame will prevent prolonged harm to Guardians and the
environment from ongoing coal mining authorized without adequate environmental analysis.
Without deferred vacatur, Federal Defendants have no incentive to complete their proposed
NEPA analysis in a timely manner and can delay completion indefinitely. Imposing a shorter
time frame and retaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the terms of the remand Order, will
ensure that completion of the EIS for the Mining Plan remains a priority for Federal Defendants.

III.

The Court Should Declare Plaintiff a “Prevailing Party.”

Finally, if the Court grants Federal Defendants’ motion, regardless of whether the Court
includes a deferred vacatur provision in its Order, Guardians respectfully requests that the Court
include in its Order a finding that Plaintiff is a “prevailing party” within the meaning of the
Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”), 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). Such a finding will preserve
Guardians’ ability to seek fees and costs associated with pursuing its NEPA claims. Guardians
should be deemed a prevailing party in this case because, even though granting Federal
Defendants’ motion will preclude a judgment on the merits of the case, achieving a remand order
and an EIS that includes opportunities for public participation prior to a new decision on the
Mining Plan are the remedies Guardians seeks in this case. ECF Doc. 37 at 18-19 (Amended
Complaint). See Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t. of Health & Human Res.,
532 U.S. 598, 604-05 (2001) (A plaintiff must establish that the federal court action resulted in a
“material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties” and that the alteration was “judicially
sanctioned”); Perez-Arellano v. Smith, 279 F.3d 791, 794 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that the
Buckhannon rule regarding prevailing party status governs EAJA fee applications); RuedaMenicucci v. INS, 132 F.3d 493, 495 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding a plaintiff is a prevailing party
under EAJA where there has been a voluntary remand to an agency without a judgment on the
merits and “the remand order terminates the litigation in favor of the claimant.”). WildEarth
Guardians I, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 1232, and WildEarth Guardians II, 2016 WL 259285, at *3,
both determined that Guardians was entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees under EAJA.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Guardians respectfully requests that the Court: (1) grant in part
Federal Defendants’ Motion with respect to the request for a voluntary remand to complete an

8

Case 1:14-cv-00112-RJ-CG Document 95 Filed 08/02/16 Page 9 of 9

EIS for the San Juan Mining Plan within three years; (2) defer vacatur of the challenged Mining
Plan for three years pending timely completion of the NEPA process; (3) require Federal
Defendants to file quarterly status reports with the Court during the three-year time frame; (4)
allow Federal Defendants to seek leave to extend the three-year deadline upon a showing of very
good cause; and (5) declare Plaintiff WildEarth Guardians is a prevailing party.
