Plaintiff,
Case No. 07 - C - 544
v. Honorable William C. Griesbach

PRODO-PAK CORPORATION,

Defendant.

 

PLAINTIFF'S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE

 

The Defendznt Prodo Pak Corporation's (PP) Motion to Transfer Venue of this case to
New Jersey should be denied because venue is appropriate in the Eastern District of Wisconsin,

Green Bay Division.

INTRODUCTION

This case is a story about PP creating a disastrous situation for Curwood, and then
intentionally making it worse.

PP called Curwood and proposed to build and sell to Curwood two (2) packaging
machines (Machines). Curwood would then lease the Machines to a company named Degussa -
and Degussa, in turn, would buy packaging products from Curwood to be used in the Machines.

Proposals were passed, purchase orders were sent, a lease for the Machines was signed
and Curwood paid for the Machines. All was good until the Machines did not work as proposed,

watranted and required and Degussa cancelled its lease of the Machines.

Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 1 of 22 Document 14
PP then offe-ed to buy the Machines back from Curwood, at a discount of course. Again
Curwood agreed and transferred title and ownership of the Machines back to PP. PP, however,
had other ideas and never paid Curwood and refused to discuss the situation.

Being left wth no alternative, Curwood sued PP in this Court initially alleging breach of
contract, breach of warranty and misrepresentation because the Machines did not work, and
breach of contract end property loss through misrepresentation for PP's failure to pay for the
Machines after Curwood sent them back.!

PP then filed its Motion to Transfer Venue to New Jersey which is now being opposed by

Curwood.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

Curwood is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and duly authorized to
do business in Wis:onsin, with its corporate offices located at 2200 Badger Ave, Oshkosh,
Wisconsin. Curwood is in the business of manufacturing flexible packaging for worldwide
distribution. (First Amended Complaint, hereinafter "1 A. Compl." 1; Affidavit of Steven J.
Price in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Transfer Venue, hereinafter "Price Aff." 3).
Curwood has no facilities, offices or property in the state of New Jersey. (Price Aff. 94).

PP is a New Jersey corporation with its principal offices located at 77 Commerce Street,
Garfield, New Jersey. PP is in the business of manufacturing pouch and tube filling and sealing
machinery for worldwide distribution. (1*t A. Compl. 2).

On October |, 2003, John Mueller (Mueller), President of PP, sent Jeff Hopp (Hopp), the

Marketing Manager for Curwood, an unsolicited fax communication, summarizing and

 

' The day after PP filed is Motion to Transfer Venue, Curwood filed a First Amended Complaint adding causes of
action for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit also based on PP's failure to pay for the Machines. Those
additional claims are not germane to the venue issue currently before the Court.

Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 2 of 22 Document 14
proposing a three-way business relationship between PP, Curwood and Degussa Flavors and
Fruit Systems, US, LLC (Degussa). In this relationship, PP would manufacture the two
packaging Machine: and sell them to Curwood. Curwood would then lease the Machines at no
cost to Degussa in exchange for Degussa purchasing packaging material from Curwood. (10x00B0 A.
Comp. 0x00A75; Hopp Affidavit in Opposition to defendant's Motion to Transfer Venue, hereinafter
"Hopp Aff." 93, Price Aff. $5).

As a follow up, on October 8, 2003, Mueller traveled to Curwood headquarters in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and met with Curwood representatives. In this meeting, the Machines and
scope of the project were discussed. (Hopp Aff. 4).

Mueller then sent a letter to Hopp by U.S. mail recapping the discussions from the face-
to-face meeting the previous day. With this correspondence, Mueller also included a draft
proposal to build the Machines. Curwood then had various telephonic, fax and e-mail
communications from Mueller regarding certain terms of the draft proposal and agreement was
reached on a final proposal on October 30, 2003. This proposal was then sent from PP to
Curwood in Oshkos1, Wisconsin and it is the proposal that governed the conduct of the parties
(Proposal). (10x00B0. A. Compl. 0x00A76; Hopp Aff. 95, 6).

Curwood then signed a lease agreement with Degussa for the Machines. The lease was
for a term of thirty-six (36) months, and required Degussa to purchase from Curwood certain
quantities of packaging film. (10x00B0 A. Compl. 0x00A78; Hopp Aff. 97).

As part of the agreement and transaction with PP, in November 2003, Curwood sent to
PP Purchase Order No. 30926-03 for the Machines. (1 A. Compl. 0x00A79; Hopp Aff. 8). (Purchase

Order). The Terms and Conditions of Purchase on the reverse of each page of the Purchase

Order contain the following relevant language:

Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 3 of 22 Document 14
1. Complete Agreement. This purchase order, including these
general conditions and any specifications or attachments hereto,
constitutes the sole and entire agreement between Buyer and the
Seller. No other terms or conditions shall be binding upon Buyer.
Should any of the terms and conditions of this purchase order be at
variance with any of the terms and conditions of sale of the Seller,
it is understood and agreed that the terms and conditions of this
purchase order will prevail.

KOK

16. Applicable Law. The laws of the state where the Buyer's plant or
location is situated to which the terms sold hereunder are to be
shipped or at which the services are to be performed, shall govern
all_ matters relating to this order _as to formation of obligation,
interpretation and performance.

(Empk asis added).

At the end of' the Purchase Order, just below the signature line it states:

THIS OF.DER IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE
FACE AND REVERSE SIDE HEREOF

(Emphasis in original).

The intent and effect of Paragraph 1 of these Terms and Conditions was to nullify the
venue and choice of law provisions upon which PP relies in an attempt to transfer venue of this
case to New Jersey.

The intent and effect of Paragraph 16 of the Terms and Conditions was to obtain and
maintain venue in Wisconsin. The Machines were built at the request of and for the benefit of
Curwood, with its main plant and location in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Indeed, PP's relevant
communications (in person, fax, phone, voicemail, email) with Curwood were directed at
Curwood's plant and location in Oshkosh. (Price Aff. 96; Price Aff. Ex. A).

On December 9, 2003, PP faxed Curwood a letter in Oshkosh, Wisconsin confirming that

the machine drawings had been released for fabrication. (10x00B0 A. Compl. 410; Hopp Aff. 99; Hopp

Aff. Ex. A).

Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 4 of 22 Document 14
Beginning in June 2004 and continuing until the termination of the project, there were
significant problems and defects with the Machines. Curwood spent many man hours attempting
to remedy the defec:s including twelve (12) formal service calls by Curwood service personnel
from July 2004 through February 2005. Also as part of the parties' attempts to fix the problems
with the Machines, with the knowledge of and at the request of PP, Curwood fabricated parts in
its machine shop located in New London, Wisconsin and shipped them to PP. The total value of
these parts is estimeted at between $5,000 and $8,000. There were also numerous telephonic,
fax and e-mail communications from PP to Curwood personnel in an attempt to have the
Machines conform 1o the terms of the Proposal and to perform as represented, warranted and
required by Degussa. (Hopp. Aff. 10).

In or around July 2004, one Machine was shipped by PP to Degussa at its filling plant
located in Gardena, California. Delivery of this Machine operated to transfer title, ownership,
possession and projerty of the Machines from PP in New Jersey to Curwood in Oshkosh,
Wisconsin. (1 A. Compl. 911; Defendant's Answer to Plaintiff's Original Complaint,
hereinafter "Original Answer" 911; Hopp Aff. 911). The second Machine never left New Jersey.

On October 20, 2004, without solicitation or invitation by Curwood, PP sent to
Curwood's Meat Market Manager also located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, two separate alternative
proposals for another machine for a separate project. (Hopp Aff. 412).

Because the Machines never worked properly, on January 28, 2005, senior counsel for
Degussa notified Curwood in writing of its intent to cancel the lease for Curwood's failure to
provide fully operatle equipment. (1 A. Compl. { 12; Hopp Aff. 0x00A713; Hopp Aff. Ex. B.).

Curwood then received an e-mail from Mueller stating PP may have leads on potential

buyers for the Machines if Curwood would sell the Machines back to PP and provided an

5
Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 5 of 22 Document 14
estimate of the cost to retro-fit the Machines for new uses. (10x00B0 A. Compl. 0x00A713; Hopp Aff. 14;
Hopp. Aff. Ex. C).

On May 23, 2005, Hopp had a telephone conversation with Mueller about a potential sale
by PP of the Machines to a customer in Bangladesh. Mueller indicated that Curwood would
need to relinquish title and ownership of the Machines to PP for retro-fitting.

On June 7, 2005, a verbal agreement was reached between Curwood and PP for PP to buy
the Machines back from Curwood for a payment of $240,000 and PP would also issue a credit
for its last invoice tc Curwood of $63,931.25. PP would also be required to present to Curwood
a letter of credit demonstrating that the funds for the $240,000 purchase price were available to
PP. On June 10, 2C05, Mueller sent Hopp an email outlining the financial terms of this verbal
agreement and faxec. a draft letter of credit on June 13, 2005. (1* A. Compl. 913, 14; Hopp Aff.
415-18; Hopp Aff. Exs. D, E).

On June 20, 2005, Mueller sent Hopp an e-mail indicating PP anticipated shipping the
Machines in late October or early November and requested a change in the date of payment for
the Machines. On July 21, 2005, Mueller forwarded to Curwood in Oshkosh written
confirmation of the final terms of PP's purchase of the Machines back from Curwood. (the Buy
Back Contract) In tis correspondence, PP affirmatively represented Curwood would receive the
purchase funds on cr before December 1, 2005. (1st A. Compl. ff] 15, 16; Hopp Aff. 19, 20;
Hopp Aff. Exs. F, G)

On July 29, 2005, relying on discussions with Mueller and the Buy Back Contract,
Curwood confirmed in writing its transfer of title and ownership of the Machines from
Wisconsin back to F'P and acknowledged again the written terms and conditions of the Buy Back

Contract. The first Machine was then shipped from California back to New Jersey.

Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 6 of 22 Document 14
On August 23, 2005, Mueller e-mailed Curwood indicating new parts had been released
for fabrication on the Machines in preparation of resale of them by PP. (10x00B0 A. Compl. 9918, 19;
Hopp Aff. (921, 22; Hopp Aff. Exs. H, I; Original Answer 0x00A719).

Curwood rec2ived no payment from PP by the December 1, 2005 deadline. To date, PP
has not paid Curwood any money for the Machines. (10x00B0 A. Compl. 421-23; Hopp Aff. 9923-26;
Hopp Aff. Ex. J; Orizinal Answer 0x00A722).

In addition to the specific in-person, mail, fax and e-mail contacts detailed above, there
were numerous othe: contacts and correspondence by U.S. mail, fax, e-mail and telephone from
PP to Curwood in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Through the course of dealings between PP and
Curwood, PP also forwarded to Curwood at its offices in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, invoices for
payments due. Curwood made all payments except for the final payment of $63,931.25. All
payments were made by Curwood from Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

Curwood had at least five (5) employees located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, work on this
project. All of these: employees are potential witnesses. Alternatively, PP listed in Paragraph A
of its Rule 26 Initial Disclosures only one (1) employee, Mueller, as an individual with
discoverable information that it may use to support its claims or defenses. (Hopp Aff. 4927-29;
Ex. K).

All of Curw o0d's documents and tangible evidence, except the Machines, are located in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The current location and condition of the Machines is unknown to

Curwood. (Hopp A:*f. 930).

ARGUMENT

I PRODO PAK'S VENUE LANGUAGE DOES NOT CONTROL

In its attempt to have venue transferred, PP relies solely on language in the Proposal
stating:

This agreement and any purchase or sale arising hereunder shall be
governed, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
State of New Jersey. Any litigation concerning this agreement shall be
under the jurisdiction of a state or federal court located within New
Jersev.

(PP's Initial Brief in Support of Motion to Transfer Venue, p. 1).
Consequently, if the Court finds that this language does not control venue in this case,

PP's Motion must fail.

PP's brief argument completely ignores the language in Curwood's Purchase Order as

follows:

1. Complete Agreement. This purchase order, including these
general conditions and any specifications or attachments hereto,
constitutes the sole and entire agreement between Buyer and the
Seller. No other terms or conditions shall be binding upon Buyer.
Should any of the terms and conditions of this purchase order be at
variance with any of the terms and conditions of sale of the Seller,
it is understood and agreed that the terms and conditions of this
purchase order will prevail.

OKO

16. Applicable Law. The laws of the state where the Buyer's plant or
location is situated to which the terms sold hereunder are to be
shipped or at which the services are to be performed, shall govern
all matters relating to this order_as to formation of obligation,
interpretation and performance.

 

? Although not directly relevant to the question of venue, Curwood does not waive and reserves the right to argue at
any time in this litigation that the Terms and Conditions attached at the end of Exhibit A to the affidavit of John
Mueller is not the final version of the Terms and Conditions agreed upon and which governed the conduct of and
rights and remedies available to the parties.

Case 1:07-cv-00544-WCG Filed 02/07/08 Page 8 of 22 Document 14
(Emphasis added).

This language operates to negate the venue language noted in the Proposal and
specifically states that venue shall lie in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.

More particularly, the intent and effect of Paragraph | was to nullify the venue and
choice of law provisions upon which PP relies in an attempt to transfer venue of this case to New
Jersey.

The intent and effect of Paragraph 16 was to obtain and maintain venue in Wisconsin.
The Machines were luilt at the request of and for the benefit of Curwood, with its main plant and
location in Oshkosh. Wisconsin. Indeed, PP's relevant communications (in person, fax, phone,
voicemail, email) to Curwood were directed to Curwood's location in Oshkosh.

Alternatively, and without waiving the foregoing, if the Court determines that Curwood's
venue language contained in its Purchase Order does not, in and of itself, allow venue in the
Eastern District, PP's argument also ignores the claims by Curwood relating to the Buy Back
Contract. The language upon which PP relies states "[a]ny litigation concerning this agreement
shall be under the jurisdiction of a state or federal court located within New Jersey." (emphasis
added). The agreement to which reference is made is the Proposal, not the Buy Back Contract.
By its own terms, PP's venue language does not apply to the Buy Back Contract. As such, venue
is proper in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.

Again alternatively, and without waiving any arguments above, if the Court does not find
the above arguments persuasive, the venue provisions in the Proposal and in the Purchase Order
cancel each other. "n essence, the "battle of the forms" is a draw. If that is the case, the Court
then should analyze PP's Motion under federal venue statutes, then perhaps Wisconsin's long

arm statute.

I. FEDERAL VENUE PROVISIONS PREVENT TRANSFER AND ALLOW
VENUE IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

PP can only obtain a change of venue "[flor the convenience of the parties and witnesses,
in the interest of justice..." 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1404. PP has the burden of showing New Jersey is "a
clearly more conven.ent" forum. Heller Pin. Inc. v. Midwhey Powder Co., 883 F.2d 1286, 1293
(7" Cir. 1989). Great weight must be afforded a plaintiff's venue choice. Federal Deposit Ins.
Corp. v. Citizens Bank & Trust Co., 592 F.2d 364, 368, (7 Cir.), cert. denied, 444 US. 829,
100 S.Ct. 56, 62 L.Ed 37 (1979). Also, contradicting PP's reasoning in its Motion, a venue
clause in a contract is not dispositive under 0x00A7 1404(a). Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.,
487 U.S. 22, 108 S.Ct. 2239, 2245, 101 L.Ed.2d 22 (1988).

This case should remain in the Eastern District of Wisconsin because a plaintiff's choice
of forum governs unless circumstances point elsewhere. Kahn v. General Motors Corp., 889
F.2d 1078, 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1989). A transfer of venue should be denied when the only effect
would be to shift inconvenience from the defendant to the plaintiff. Kleinerman v. Luxtron
Corp., 107 F.Supp.2d 122 (D. Mass. 2000) ("Transfer is not appropriate where its effect is
merely to shift inconvenience from one party to another"). Where Curwood has filed suit in its
home district, where all of its facilities and employees are located, and where it was the victim of
a breach of contract, warranty and misrepresentation concerning not one, but two contracts,
substantial weight st.ould be given to that choice of forum.

While 28 U.!5.C. 0x00A7 1404(a) authorizes transfers for convenience, the facts weigh heavily
in favor keeping this action in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. As an initial matter, the State of
Wisconsin has a substantial interest in providing citizen of the state access to the federal court
system. Additionally, Curwood's business headquarters, officers, and facilities are located in

Oshkosh and New London, both of which are in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. All of
