Case No. 07-C-544

PRODO-PAK CORPORATION
Defendant
______________________________________________________________________________
DEFENDANT’S BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE
______________________________________________________________________________

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiff, a Delaware corporation having its corporate offices in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
filed this suit on June 14, 2007. The defendant, Prodo Pak Corporation, a Delaware
corporation with its offices and plant in Garfield, New Jersey, filed its answer on or about
August 31, 2007. In its affirmative defenses it indicated that venue was improperly laid and
should have been in New Jersey.
Counts one through three of the four count complaint seek damages from the defendant
pursuant to defendant’s October 30, 2003 proposal to sell packaging machines to the
plaintiff. That proposal, attached as Exhibit A to the Mueller affidavit, upon which the
plaintiff relies, contained the following forum selection clause:
“ This agreement and any purchase or sale arising hereunder shall be governed,
construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey.
Any litigation concerning this agreement shall be under the jurisdiction of a state or
federal court located within New Jersey.” (Emphasis supplied).
Defendant now moves for a transfer of venue in reliance on this clause.

I. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT DEFENDANT’‘S
MOTION TO TRANSFER THIS MATTER TO THE
DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY PURSUANT TO
THE FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE IN THE
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
28 U.S.C. section 1406 (a) provides that a District Court shall transfer venue in an action
wrongly laid to a District in which it could have been brought.. A contractual forum selection
clause is “prima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the resisting
party to be unreasonable under the circumstances.” M/S Bremen v. Zapata Offshore Co., 407
U.S. 1, 10, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 1913, 32 L.Ed. 513 (1972).
Here the agreement which is the primary focus of the complaint contains the following
forum selection clause:
“ This agreement and any purchase or sale arising hereunder shall be governed,
construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey.
Any litigation concerning this agreement shall be under the jurisdiction of a state or
federal court located within New Jersey.” (Emphasis supplied)
Mueller affidavit, Exhibit A, par. 9 of last page.
Because this forum selection clause applies to “Any” litigation, its selection of a federal
or state court located in New Jersey is clear and venue should be transferred..
CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, it is respectfully submitted that the Court should issue an order
transferring the within litigation to the District of New Jersey.
