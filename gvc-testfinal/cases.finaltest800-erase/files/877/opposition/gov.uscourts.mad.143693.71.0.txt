Plaintiffs’’ Brian Perry, Kim Perry and Cheryl Miller (“Plaintiffs”) provide the following
responses to the each individual Statement of Fact (“SOF”) in the Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. In responding to the
individual statements of fact herein, Plaintiffs do not concede or acknowledge the materiality of
any or all of said statements of fact (whether admitted or not).
A. ERM’s Non-Refundable Fees at Issue in This Litigation
1.

ERM is a real estate management company which manages residential apartment
properties in Massachusetts as authorized agent of the owners of those properties.
[Answer to Amended Complaint ¶¶ 4, 12.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted that ERM is a real estate management company which manages residential
apartment properties in Massachusetts as authorized agent of the property owners,
and further responds that ERM signs all of the leases as the lessor for all of these
properties. [Defendant’s Revised and Amended Answers to Plaintiff’s First Set of

Interrogatories (“Revised Answers”), No. 3 (Exhibit 1 hereto); Deposition of Denise
Beihoffer (“Beihoffer Dep.”) at 79 (Exhibit 2 hereto).]
2.

As of December 31, 2012, ERM managed 29 residential apartment properties in
Massachusetts. [Deposition of Denise Beihoffer (“Beihoffer Dep.”), attached hereto
as Exhibit A, at 29-35; Beihoffer Dep. Ex. 12, attached hereto as Exhibit B.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

Application Fee
3.

Prior to September 27, 2013, when an individual wished to lease an ERM-managed
property in Massachusetts, she would first fill out an application and pay a $50
application processing fee. [Beihoffer Dep. at 53-56, 118.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted, with the exception of the phrase, “[p]rior to September 27, 2013,” which is
not supported by the cited testimony.

4.

ERM’s application fee was non-refundable. [Amended Complaint ¶ 26.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

5.

ERM’s application fee was disclosed and paid at the time the rental application was
filled out by the applicant. [Beihoffer Dep. at 55-56.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

2

6.

ERM’s application fee was intended to cover both the hard and soft costs of
processing applications, to determine whether an applicant was eligible to receive a
lease offer. [Beihoffer Dep. at 54-55.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that SOF No. 6 accurately describes ERM’s stated purpose for the
application fee.

7.

ERM’s costs of processing applications included verifying references and prior rental
history, reviewing credit reports, conducting criminal background checks, and
reviewing employment history, along with the fees and employee time associated
with these tasks. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that ERM’s costs of processing applications included verifying
references, reviewing credit reports, and conducting criminal background checks.
The remainder of No. 7 is denied, as it is not supported by the cited testimony.
Further, there is no evidence as to what ERM’s actual costs were.

8.

ERM’s application fee was charged to all applicants in Massachusetts except: (1)
individuals who qualify for housing assistance; and (2) employees of large
corporations with which Equity has a master lease agreement. [Beihoffer Dep. at 56;
Deposition of Thomas Lebling (“Lebling Dep.”), attached hereto as Exhibit C, at 28.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

9.

ERM’s application fee was in existence for at least fifteen years. [Beihoffer Dep. at
15-16, 53.]

3

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.
10.

On September 27, 2013, ERM stopped charging application fees to all applicants for
rental properties in Massachusetts. [Affidavit of Thomas Lebling (“Lebling Aff.”),
attached hereto as Exhibit D, ¶¶ 2-3.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

Move-In Fee
11.

Up until February 2012, and for at least fifteen years prior to then, ERM charged a
move-in fee to new residents who were moving into an apartment community.
[Beihoffer Dep. at 39-40.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs’ admit SOF No. 11, except for the phrase, “[u]p until February 2012.” That
portion of SOF No. 11 is denied for the reasons stated in the Response to SOF No. 17
below. The move-in fee was also sometimes referred to by ERM as an “amenity fee.”
[April 18, 2010 e-mail from Melissa Reis to Cheryl Miller, referencing an amenity
fee in the sum of $500 (Exhibit 3 hereto); Information Summary Sheet from the West
End Apartments, referencing a $500 amenity fee (Exhibit 4 hereto).]

12.

ERM’s move-in fee was intended to offset the hard and soft costs that ERM typically
incurred in getting an apartment ready for move-in, such as marketing, lease
preparation, communications with tenants, and decorating, along with associated
employee time. [Beihoffer Dep. at 40-41.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:

4

Denied, as ERM at times gave a different description and explanation of the movein fee and its purpose, inconsistent with SOF No. 12. See West End Apartments
summary sheet provided to Plaintiff Cheryl Miller (Exhibit 4), identifiying the same
fee as an “Amenity Fee” in the sum of $500, and described it as a “one-time fee”
covering, “24 hour fitness center, 24 hour concierge services, 24 hour maintenance,
7-day freight elevator availab[ility]; Similarly, Melissa Reis’ April 18, 2010 e-mail
(Exhibit 3) refers to the move-in fee as an “amenity fee” (“[t]he $500 Amenity fee is
a one-time fee that includes the fitness center, concierge, maintenance and freight
elevator.”) 1]
13.

ERM’s move-in fee was disclosed as a lease charge. [Beihoffer Dep. at 41, 45.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

14.

ERM’s move-in fee was collected at the time the lease was signed or at move-in.
[Beihoffer Dep. at 41.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

15.

ERM’s move-in fee was non-refundable. [Beihoffer Dep. at 45-46.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

16.

The amount of ERM’s move-in fee varied by property within Massachusetts, based
on market conditions. [Beihoffer Dep. at 118-119.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs’ admit that there was some variation among the Massachusetts properties as

1

These are the same costs that ERM claims to be covered by its “community fee.” See SOF No. 37.

5

to the amount of the move-in fee.
17.

At the end of February 2012, ERM stopped collecting move-in fees in Massachusetts
due to the decision in Hermida v. Archstone, 826 F. Supp. 2d 380, 381 (D. Mass.
2011). [Beihoffer Dep. at 42-43.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs deny SOF No. 17 as stated. Further responding, Plaintiffs state as follows:
At the end of February, 2012, due to the decision in Hermida v. Archstone, 826 F.
Supp. 2d 380 (D. Mass. 2011), ERM temporarily suspended the collection of movein fees in Massachusetts, or, stated another way, ERM at that time stopped collecting
move-in fees prior to occupancy in Massachusetts. Approximately one month later,
on or about March 28, 2012, ERM “pushed [the move-in fee] into the second month
[of tenancy].” At that time, ERM resumed the charging and collection of the move-in
fee (or an amenity fee), re-labeling it as a “community fee,” and instead of collecting
it prior to occupancy, put in place a procedure by which the fee would still be
charged prior to occupancy but would be collected at the beginning of the second full
month of tenancy. [February 27, 2012 e-mail from Tom Lebling to Dave Romano
(ERM 009075) (Exhibit 5); February 29, 2012 e-mail from Tom Lebling to Martha
Sharrock (ERM 009761-9762 at 9761) (Exhibit 6); May 11, 2012 e-mail from Lynn
Bora to Martha Sharrock (ERM 009789) (Exhibit 7); February 27, 2012 e-mail from
Lynn Bora to various recipients (ERM 009068) (Exhibit 8).]

18.

ERM’s move-in fee was different from the “amenity use fee” at issue in Hermida, but
ERM made the business decision to stop charging a move-in fee until the issues
raised in Hermida were settled in Massachusetts. [Beihoffer Dep. at 43, 49-51.]

6

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs’ admit that ERM made a decision to suspend charging the move-in fee, or
to stop charging the move-in fee prior to occupancy as a result of the Hermida
decision. In all other respects, SOF No. 18 is denied. There is no material distinction
between the amenity fee at issue in Hermida and the non-refundable move-in fee
charged by ERM (which was also at times referred to as an amenity fee), nor is there
any material distinction between the fee that ERM has called a “community” fee and
the amenity fee at issue in Hermida. Further, ERM and Equity Residential (“Equity”)
personnel at times referred to the move-in fee as an amenity fee. See Response to
SOF No. 12 above, and exhibits referenced therein. And the fee that came to be
called a community fee was described by an Equity regional vice president as an
“amenity/common area fee” to be collected “at the beginning of their second full
month of tenancy.” [February 27, 2012 e-mail from Lynn Bora, ERM 9068 (Exhibit
8 hereto); see also Response to SOF Nos. 11 and 17 above and citations referenced
therein] In sum, the move-in fee and the community fee are one and the same.
Up-Front Pet Fee
19.

At the end of February 2012, ERM charged a one-time, up-front pet fee to
prospective tenants who intended to keep a pet(s) at an ERM property. [Beihoffer
Dep. at 59-61.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

20.

ERM’s up-front pet fee was sometimes referred to as a “pet privilege fee.” [Beihoffer
Dep. at 59-60.]

7

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs deny SOF No. 20, as it is not supported by the cited testimony.
21.

ERM’s up-front pet fee was disclosed as a lease charge. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

22.

ERM’s up-front pet fee was collected at the time the lease was signed or at move-in.
[Id.]

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.
23.

ERM’S up-front pet fee was for a tenant’s privilege of keeping a pet at the property,
and was intended to offset costs resulting from having pets in an apartment
community. [Beihoffer Dep. at 60.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs’ admit that SOF No. 23 accurately describes ERM’s stated purpose for the
up-front pet fee.

24.

The amount of ERM’s up-front pet fee varied from property to property in
Massachusetts, depending on market conditions and the type and number of pets
owned by the tenant. [Beihoffer Dep. at 119.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that there was some variation among the Massachusetts properties as
to the amount of the up-front pet fee.

25.

ERM’s up-front pet fee was non-refundable. [Amended Complaint ¶ 33.]

8

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.
26.

ERM did not charge tenants both an up-front pet fee and monthly pet rent (as further
described below at ¶¶ 28-34). [Beihoffer Dep. at 65.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the up-front pet fees and monthly pet fees were in a way
alternatives to each other, such that a tenant would not have been charged both an upfront pet fee and monthly pet fees.

27.

In February 2012, ERM stopped collecting up-front pet fees in Massachusetts due to
the decision in Hermida. [Beihoffer Dep. at 60-61.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that ERM stopped collecting up-front pet fees in Massachusetts in
February 2012, due to the Hermida decision, and that ERM has not as yet resumed
the collection of up-front pet fees at its Massachusetts properties.

Monthly Pet Fee (aka “Pet Rent”)
28.

ERM charges monthly pet rent to some tenants who wish to keep a pet(s) at an ERM
property. [Beihoffer Dep. at 63.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
In responding to SOF No. 28 (and in admitting all or any portion of it), Plaintiffs are
preserving their objection to, and are not accepting or acknowledging the use of the
term “pet rent” for what is actually a pet fee. This same objection is incorporated into
Plaintiffs’ responses to SOF Nos. 29 through 35 below, as if stated separately in each
response. Subject to that objection, Plaintiffs admit SOF No. 28 with the exception of

9

the phrase “some tenants.” The monthly pet fees are mandatory for pet-owning
tenants, with a specified exception for service animals. And like rent and some other
fees, the monthly pet fee may be waived in certain situations as a marketing device to
attract tenants. [Beihoffer Dep. at 65-66]

29.

ERM’s monthly pet rent is for the privilege of keeping a pet at the property, and is
intended to offset costs associated with having pets in the apartment community.
[Beihoffer Dep. at 64.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that SOF No. 29 accurately describes ERM’s stated purpose for the
monthly pet fees.

30.

The amount of ERM’s monthly pet rent varies from property to property in
Massachusetts, based on market conditions and the type and number of pets owned by
the tenant. [Beihoffer Dep. at 119-120.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the amount of the monthly pet fee varies among ERM’s
Massachusetts properties.

31.

ERM’s monthly pet rent is disclosed in the ERM lease. [Beihoffer Dep. at 63.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

32.

ERM’s monthly pet rent is paid at same time rent is paid. [Beihoffer Dep. at 64.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

10

33.

ERM’s monthly pet rent is pro-rated if a tenant moves into an apartment before the
first of the month. [Plaintiffs’ Brian and Kim Perry’s Responses to Defendants’
Requests for Admission (“Perrys Admission”), attached hereto as Exhibit E, No.
7/Ex. 3.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

34.

ERM’s monthly pet rent is non-refundable. [Amended Complaint ¶ 33.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

35.

ERM did not charge tenants both monthly pet rent and an up-front pet fee (at least
when such up-front fees were still being charged by ERM, as described above at ¶¶
19-27). [Beihoffer Dep. at 65.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
See Response to SOF No. 26 above.

Community Fee
36.

ERM started charging a community fee in May 2012. [Beihoffer Dep. at 66-67.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that ERM charges its Massachusetts tenants a fee it calls a
“community fee.” Plaintiffs neither admit nor deny that May 2012 was when ERM
started charging the community fee, as the evidence appears to be conflicting on
when that practice started. While the cited testimony (Beihoffer Dep. at 66-67)
appears to indicate that it started in May 2012, certain documents produced by
ERM indicate that it started charging the community fee on or about March 28, 2012.

11

[March 27, 2012 e-mail from Patricia Cooper to various recipients, ERM 003780,
Exhibit 9 hereto; Lynn Bora’s May 11, 2012 e-mail to Martha Sharrock, ERM
009789 (Exhibit 7 hereto).] In addition, the community fee is the same fee as the
move-in fee previously collected prior to occupancy, or an amenity fee. See
Responses to SOF Nos. 11, 17 and 18 above, and exhibits cited therein.

37.

ERM’s community fee is intended to offset some of the costs associated with
maintaining the entire property, such as common areas, landscaping, fitness center,
and pool. [Beihoffer Dep. at 68; Lebling Dep. at 25-26.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that SOF No. 37 accurately describes ERM’s stated purpose for the
community fee.

38.

ERM’s community fee is disclosed in the lease via a lease addendum. [Beihoffer
Dep. at 69-71.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

39.

ERM’s community fee is not collected until the beginning of the second full month of
occupancy. [Beihoffer Dep. at 68.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that while the community fee is disclosed and charged at or prior to
the commencement of the tenancy, it is not actually collected until the beginning of
the second month.

12

40.

ERM’s community fee is collected after the expiration of ERM’s 30-day “Total
Satisfaction Guarantee.” [Beihoffer Dep. at 71-72.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the community fee is collected at the beginning of the second full
month of occupancy, but Plaintiffs deny that either the community fee or the time at
which it is collected has anything to do with the “30-day ‘Total Satisfaction
Guarantee.’” The collection of the community fee was pushed to the beginning of the
second month in an attempt to evade the effect of the Hermida decision, and for no
other reason. In a training presentation on the Massachusetts non-refundable
community fee directed to ERM’s Massachusetts property managers and leasing
agents, under “What NOT to say . . .,” Massachusetts employees were told that they
“shouldn’t [] say during the sales process about the [community] fee” that “[ERM]
wait[s] to apply this charge because of a MA state law,” in order not to reveal the true
purpose for delaying collection to the beginning of the second month. [Massachusetts
Non-Refundable Community Fee training slides, at 2 (Exhibit 10 hereto); Deposition
of Lynn Bora (“Bora Dep”). at 97.] (Exhibit 11 hereto). The community fee is
actually a resumption or continuation of the move-in fee, or an amenity fee, with a
simple tweak as to the timing of collection. See Responses to SOF Nos. 11, 17 and
18 above, and Exhibits cited therein.

41.

ERM’s 30-day “Total Satisfaction Guarantee” permits a tenant in an ERM apartment
to terminate her lease, if, after 30 days, she is not completely satisfied with the
apartment. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:

13

Plaintiffs admit that the “Total Satisfaction Guarantee” permits a tenant to
Terminate the lease after 30 days under certain conditions and subject to
certain limitations. And it was up to the property manager to decide whether or not
the guarantee conditions were satisfied. [Beihoffer Dep. at 71-72; Bora Dep. at 3940]
42.

The amount of ERM’s community fee varies from property to property across
Massachusetts, based on market conditions. [Beihoffer Dep. at 117.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the amount of the community fee varies among ERM’s
Massachusetts properties.

43.

ERM’s community fee is non-refundable. [Beihoffer Dep. at 72.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

B. Facts Specific to Plaintiff Cheryl Miller
44.

In the spring of 2010, Miller was living in an apartment at 18 Mt. Vernon St., in
Boston, for which she paid $3,175/month in rent. [Deposition of Cheryl Miller
(“Miller Dep.”), attached hereto as Exhibit F, at 13.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

45.

Miller started looking for other apartments because she wanted an apartment with
lower rent. [Miller Dep. at 13.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:

14

Admitted.
46.

On or about April 2010, Miller found an apartment at 10 Emerson Place, an ERMmanaged property, with a rent of $2,065. [Miller Dep. at 15-16; Plaintiff Cheryl
Miller’s Response to Defendant’s Requests for Admission (“Miller Admission”),
attached hereto as Exhibit G, No. 1/Ex. 1.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

47.

Miller liked the fact that the rent at 10 Emerson Place was less than what she was
paying at 18 Mt. Vernon St. [Miller Dep. at 18-19.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the initial rent for Miller’s apartment at 10 Emerson Place was
less than what she was paying at her previous apartment, at 18 Mt. Vernon St., and
that the lower rent was something she was looking for in moving from the Mt.
Vernon St. apartment.

48.

Miller also like the fact that 10 Emerson Place was across the street from her morning
place of work. [Miller Dep. at 19.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

49.

Miller filled out an application for rental for 10 Emerson Place on April 9, 2010.
[Miller Admission No. 1/Ex. 1; Miller Dep. at 16.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

15

50.

Miller was aware that there was a $50 non-refundable application processing fee
associated with the application. [Miller Dep. at 17.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that Miller was aware at the time she was filling out the rental
application that there was a $50 non-refundable application fee associated with
the application process.

51.

Miller did not ask what the application fee was for; she simply “thought it was the
cost of doing business with Equity Residential.” [Miller Dep. at 17-18.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

52.

According to Miller, the costs associated with ERM’s processing of an application –
checking with prior landlords, doing criminal background checks, etc. – were
“reasonable.” [Miller Dep. at 25.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
SOF No. 52, as stated, is denied. Plaintiffs admit that Miller thought it reasonable
that there might be costs associated with the processing of an application, such as
checking with prior landlords and doing criminal background checks, which is what
the cited testimony says. But Miller’s cited testimony does not say that the costs
associated with ERM’s processing of an application are reasonable.

53.

On April 14, 2010, Miller paid the $50.00 non-refundable application fee. [Miller
Admission No. 2.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

16

54.

After her rental application was approved, Miller executed a one-year lease,
commencing May 1, 2010 and expiring April 30, 2011, for Apartment #18B at 10
Emerson Place. [Miller Admission Nos. 6-7/Exs. 2-3.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

55.

Miller’s 2010-2011 lease disclosed a $500.00 “NonRefundable MI Fee.” [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

56.

In separate payments made on April 19, 2010 ($300.00) and April 27, 2010
($200.00), Miller paid the $500.00 non-refundable move-in fee disclosed in her 20102011 lease. [Miller Admission Nos. 11-12.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

57.

Miller did not ask any questions about the $500 non-refundable move-in fee, despite
having the opportunity to ask. [Miller Dep. at 32-34.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted, with the qualification that the time frame is as of the time Miller paid the
$500 non-refundable move-in fee, prior to occupancy. Further responding, Plaintiffs
note that the $500 move-in fee paid by Miller was also referred to by ERM personnel
and by ERM documents provided to her as an “amenity fee.” See Response to SOF
No. 11 above (and exhibits cited therein).

58.

Miller did not have any “concerns” about paying the $500 non-refundable move-in
fee. [Miller Dep. at 34, 36.]

17

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted, with the qualification that the time frame is as of the time Miller paid the
$500 non-refundable move-in fee, prior to occupancy.
59.

Miller also paid a $500.00 security deposit in connection with her 2010-2011 lease.
[Miller Dep. at 32.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

60.

Miller moved into her apartment at 10 Emerson Place on May 1, 2010. [Miller
Admission No. 14.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

61.

Miller did not own a pet, nor was she assessed any charges for pets at 10 Emerson
Place. [Miller Admission Nos. 19-20.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

62.

Miller has not owned a pet since she moved from the suburbs to Boston in 2006;
nevertheless, Miller feels qualified to represent pet owners in this lawsuit “because if
I had had a pet, I would have paid the fee, just like them.” [Miller Dep. at 71-72.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs object to SOF No. 62, as it is not a statement of fact, but is in the nature of a
legal Conclusion. Subject to this objection, Plaintiffs admit that SOF No. 62
accurately represents Miller’s cited testimony as to her ability to represent people
who paid pet fees. In all other respects, SOF No. 62 is denied.

18

63.

Miller also was not charged at any time, nor did she pay, a “community fee” at 10
Emerson Place. [Miller Admission No. 21.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that Miller was not charged and did not pay a fee “known as” or
labeled as a “community” fee at Emerson Place. In all other respects, SOF No. 63 is
denied. For the reasons stated in Plaintiffs’ Responses to SOF Nos. 17 and 36 above,
the fee known as and labeled as a “community” fee is actually the same fee as the
move-in fee or an amenity fee, with the collection of the fee pushed into the second
month of the tenancy. So the move-in fee that Miller paid was actually the same fee
as the community fee, but collected at a different time.

64.

The total dollar amount paid by Miller at or prior to her move-in date was $3,115
($50 application fee + $500 move-in fee + $500 security deposit + $2,065 first
month’s rent). [Miller Admission Nos. 2, 6-7, 11-12/Exs. 2-4; Miller Dep. at 32.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

65.

The total dollar amount paid by Miller at or prior to her move-in date did not exceed
the total dollar amount of the sum of her security deposit plus her first month’s rent
plus her last month’s rent plus the installation cost for a new lock and key. [Miller
Admission No. 27.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

19

66.

On April 26, 2011, Miller signed a second lease for Apartment #18B at 10 Emerson
Place, commencing May 1, 2011 and expiring April 30, 2012. [Miller Admission
Nos. 16-17/Exs. 6-7.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

67.

Miller’s rent pursuant to the 2011-2012 lease was $2,180/month. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

68.

The 2011-2012 rent represented to Miller an “acceptable” increase from the previous
year. [Miller Dep. at 40-41.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

69.

On March 14, 2012, Miller signed a third lease for Apartment #18B at 10 Emerson
Place, commencing May 1, 2012 and expiring April 30, 2013. [Miller Dep. at 41-42;
Miller Dep. Ex. 37, attached hereto as Exhibit H.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

70.

Miller’s rent pursuant to the 2012-2013 lease was $2,498/month. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

71.

Miller was not happy with the increase in rent in her 2012-2013 lease, but she signed
the lease anyway. [Miller Dep. at 44-46.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:

20

Miller admits that she was not happy with the increase in rent to $2498 per month,
but signed the lease because she needed more time to find another apartment, and
that the $2498 per month rent was a reduction of $50 that she negotiated from the
original amount demanded by ERM.
72.

Sometime in early 2012, a friend told Miller about another apartment in the Beacon
Hill area, at 145 Pinckney St., that might be coming available in July 2012 and that
might be available for a lower monthly rent. [Miller Dep. at 42, 46.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

73.

Even as of Spring 2012, Miller’s concern was with the monthly rent at 10 Emerson
Place, not with the $50 application fee or $500 move-in fee that she had paid, nor did
Miller ever asked for a refund of either fee. [Miller Dep. at 52, 54.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs deny SOF No. 73 as stated, because it mixes conclusions with facts and
provides a misleading summary of the cited testimony. Plaintiffs admit that Miller,
prior to seeking legal advice and consulting with counsel, did not seek a refund of
either the application fee or move-in fee she paid to ERM. Plaintiffs also admit that
prior to the time she sought legal advice from Attorney Preston Leonard, Miller had
no reason to believe that these fees were unlawful and in fact, prior to consulting with
an attorney, she assumed they were legal. [Miller Dep. at 52.]

74.

The only thing Miller was not satisfied with at 10 Emerson Place was that her rent
had been raised too much in the 2012-2013 lease. [Miller Dep. at 28-29.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:

21

Plaintiffs admit that Miller had an issue with the rent increases at Emerson Place,
but deny SOF No. 74 in all other respects.
75.

On May 8, 2012, Miller filled out a rental application for an apartment at 145
Pinckney St. [Miller Dep. at 43-44; Miller Dep. Ex. 38, attached hereto as Exhibit I.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

76.

Miller subsequently signed a two-year lease, commencing July 1, 2012 and expiring
June 30, 2014, for Apartment #125 at 145 Pinckney St., with a monthly rent of
$2,200. [Miller Dep. at 43-47; Miller Dep. Ex. 39, attached hereto as Exhibit J.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

77.

In early July, 2013, Miller moved into her new apartment at 145 Pinckney St. and
terminated her lease at 10 Emerson Place. [Miller Dep. at 42; Miller Admission No.
18.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

78.

Miller paid a $500 move-in fee in conjunction with the 145 Pinckney St. apartment
“[s]ometime prior to moving in or the day of moving in.” [Miller Dep. at 54-55.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Denied, as Miller did not pay a “move-in fee” prior to moving into the 145 Pinckney
Street apartment, much less a move-in fee of the type she paid to ERM prior to
moving into her Emerson Place apartment. Miller did pay a moving fee to the
River House Condominium Association. As noted, this fee was a fee to cover the

22

costs associated with her moving into the building on a weekend, including the cost
of extra staff people being available for the weekend move (“[t]here is a nonrefundable weekend-holiday moving fee of $500.”). [River House Handbook at 24
(Exhibit 12 hereto); Miller Dep. at 55-56.] Further, the $500 moving fee Miller paid
at 145 Pinckney Street was paid to the condominium association, and not to her
landlords at 145 Pinckney Street, who are Dolores and Joseph Fazio. [Miller Dep. at
54; ERM Exh. J]. The moving fee was not a “move-in” fee, in part because it was to
be paid to cover moving costs for moves both into and out of the building at 145
Pinckney Street. This moving fee was to be paid by unit owners and tenants of unit
owners, i.e., anyone who was moving into or out of a unit at 145 Pinckney Street, and
the amount of the fee varied, depending on whether the move was on a weekend or
holiday, as Miller’s was ($500), or on a weekday ($250). [River House Handbook
(Exhibit 12); Miller Dep. at 56-58.]
79.

Miller has not challenged the move-in fee she paid for the 145 Pinckney St.
apartment. [Miller Dep. at 55-57.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted that Miller did not challenge the moving fee she paid to the River House
Condominium Association for her move into the building at 145 Pinckney Street.

80.

Miller viewed the move-in fee for the 145 Pinckney St. apartment as a “one-time
deal” associated with move-in. [Miller Dep. at 56-57.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Denied as incomplete and misleading. Miller’s understanding was that the moving
fee at 145 Pinckney Street was intended to cover moving costs, including having

23

“extra help available on [the] day [of her weekend move]” and “was associated with
costs related to the day that [she] actually moved in.” [Miller Dep. at 56-58.]
81.

Miller stated, however, that she has no problem with “other monthly charges,” so
long as they are “baked into” rent.” [Miller Dep. at 58.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Denied, as not supported by the cited testimony. In addition, SOF No. 81 is
incomprehensible.

C. Facts Specific to Plaintiffs Brian and Kim Perry
82.

The Perrys currently live in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. [Deposition of Brian Perry
(“B. Perry Dep.”), attached hereto as Exhibit K, at 4.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

83.

In December 2011, the Perrys were living in Massachusetts. They had just sold a
condominium they owned there and were looking for apartments that offered a sixmonth lease prior to their move back to the Chicago area in the summer of 2012. [B.
Perry Dep. at 9-11.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

84.

In addition to a six-month lease, the Perrys were looking for a community that would
be “appropriate” for their family and young son and “pet-friendly” for their cat. [B.
Perry Dep. at 11-12.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

24

85.

The Perrys were also looking for an apartment they could afford. [B. Perry Dep. at
13.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

86.

With the assistance of a broker, the Perrys looked at three apartment properties in the
Waltham area. [B. Perry Dep. at 10-11, 16-17.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

87.

The property that best fit the Perrys’ criteria was Longview Place, an ERM-managed
property. [B. Perry Dep. at 18.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that there were certain features about Unit 107-207 at Longview
Place that were attractive to the Perrys (as indicated in the cited testimony), and
that Longview Place is an ERM-managed property. In all other respects, SOF No. 87
is denied.

88.

On December 8, 2011, the Perrys each filled out an application for rental for an
apartment at Longview Place. [Perrys Admission No. 1/Ex. 1.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

89.

The Perrys understood that they each had to pay a $50 application fee in connection
with the processing of their applications. [B. Perry Dep. at 19-20.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the Perrys were asked to pay an application fee in connection

25

with their rental application. In all other respects, SOF No. 89 is denied, as it is not
supported by the cited testimony.
90.

Brian Perry understood that it was “common” and “typical” for landlords to
investigate criminal history and credit history of applicants for rental, and was not
surprised that ERM charged a $50 fee to offset these and other, similar costs. [B.
Perry Dep. at 20-21.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

91.

On December 13, 2011, the Perrys paid their two $50 application fees as a lump sum
of $100. [Perrys Admission No. 2.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the Perrys paid a total of $100 for application fees to ERM.

92.

On December 23, 2011, after their rental applications were approved, the Perrys
executed a six-month lease for Apartment #207 at Longview Place. [Perrys
Admission Nos. 8-9/Exs. 4-5.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

93.

The Perrys’ December 23 lease disclosed a $99.00 “Non-refundable MI Fee.” Id.
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

94.

The non-refundable move-in fee at Longview Place was originally $350.00, but was
reduced to $99.00 for the Perrys. [Perrys Admission No. 11.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:

26

Admitted.
95.

The Perrys paid the $99.00 non-refundable move-in fee to ERM on or before
December 23, 2011. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

96.

On December 23, 2011, the same day they signed the lease, the Perrys paid the prorated portion of their rent for December, which included monthly apartment rent
($561.77), monthly pet rent ($8.71), and monthly parking ($7.26). [Perrys Admission
No. 7/Ex. 3; B. Perry Dep. at 26-27.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

97.

The Perrys moved into Apartment #207 at Longview Place on December 23, 2011.
[Perrys Admission No. 16.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

98.

On January 4, 2012, the Perrys executed a new lease for Apartment #207. [B. Perry
Dep. Ex. 25, attached hereto as Exhibit L.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted, except to note that Brian Perry’s signature on Exhibit L is dated January 3,
2012, while Kim Perry’s signature on that document is dated January 4, 2012.

99.

The new lease disclosed additional monthly payments ($50/month) that the Perrys
would be making for an on-site storage unit that had just become available. [Id.; B.
Perry Dep. at 32-33.]

27

Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.
100.

Neither the Perrys’ December 23 lease nor their January 4 lease reflects any charge
for a “one time” or “up-front” pet fee, nor did the Perrys in fact pay any up-front pet
fee. [Perrys Admission No. 15.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

101.

Neither the Perrys’ December 23 lease nor their January 4 lease reflects any charge
for a “community fee,” nor did the Perrys in fact pay a community fee. [Perrys
Admission No. 19.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the leases signed by the Perrys did not reflect a charge called a
“community fee” and that the Perrys did not pay a fee “known as” or labeled as a
“community” fee. In all other respects, SOF No. 101 is denied. For the reasons
stated in Plaintiffs’ Responses to SOF Nos. 17 and 36 above, the fee known as and
labeled as a “community” fee is actually the same fee as the move-in fee or an
amenity fee, with the collection of the fee simply pushed into the second month of the
tenancy. So the move-in fee that the Perrys paid was actually the same fee as the
community fee, but collected at a different time.

102.

The Perrys were not required to pay, nor did they ever pay, a security deposit at
Longview Place. [B. Perry Dep. at 28.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

28

103.

The Perrys understood all of the fees and charges they paid during the application and
leasing process at Longview Place, had the opportunity to ask questions about them,
and never asked for a refund of them during their tenancy. [B. Perry Dep. at 30;
Deposition of Kimberly Perry (“K. Perry Dep.”), attached hereto as Exhibit M, at 27.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the fees and charges were disclosed on the Perrys’move-in cost
Sheet and/or the leases that the Perrys signed, and that the Perrys “understood those
Charges as being the charges required for [them] to move into [the] apartment.” [B.
Perry Dep. at 30.] In all other respects, SOF No. 103 is denied.

104.

The total dollar amount paid by the Perrys at or prior to their move-in date was
approximately $2,767 (2x$50 application fee + $99 move-in fee + $578 pro-rated
total monthly rent + $1,990 first month’s total monthly rent). [Perrys Admission Nos.
7-9/Exs. 3-5.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the Perrys paid $100 in application fees and a $99 move-in fee at
or prior to their move-in date. Plaintiffs also admit that the Perrys paid pro-rated
monthly rent of $561.77, a pro-rated monthly pet fee of $8.71 and a pro-rated
monthly parking fee of $7.26. The total of those three pro-rated amounts is $578
(rounded up).

According to their December 23, 2011 lease, the monthly rent was

$1990, which included charges for monthly parking ($25) and a monthly pet fee for
their cat ($30).
105.

The total dollar amount paid by the Perrys at or prior to their move-in date did not
exceed the total dollar amount of the sum of their security deposit plus first month’s

29

rent plus last month’s rent plus the installation cost for a new lock and key. [Perrys
Admission No. 25.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

106.

The Perrys enjoyed living at Longview Place; the staff at Longview Place were
helpful; and the Perrys’ apartment “met expectations.” [B. Perry Dep. at 38; K. Perry
Dep. at 8.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

107.

On June 26, 2012, the Perrys moved out of Longview Place and relocated to the
Chicago area. [Perrys Admission No. 18; B. Perry Dep. at 38.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

D. Plaintiffs’ Complaints and 93A Demand Letters, and ERM’s Responses
108.

On May 1, 2012, the Perrys filed a putative class action lawsuit against ERM. In that
suit, the Perrys challenged only ERM’s non-refundable move-in fee, and no other
fees. [ECF Doc No. 1; Perry Admission Nos. 22-24.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

109.

The Perrys had previously sent ERM a demand letter pursuant to Chapter 93A on
February 23, 2012. In their letter, the Perrys demanded a refund of the nonrefundable move-in fee, plus interest, both as to them and as to other Massachusetts

30

tenants similarly situated. [Affidavit of Craig M. White (“White Aff.”), attached
hereto as Exhibit N, ¶ 3.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted that the February 23, 2012 demand was for refund of the move-in fee, but
this demand also encompasses the fee that ERM has labeled a “community fee,” as
that fee is the same as the move-in fee or amenity fee, the only difference being that
the community fee is collected at a later time, as part of ERM’s transparent attempt to
evade the law and the Hermida decision.
110.

On March 6, 2012, in response to the Perrys’ February 23 demand, ERM offered the
Perrys a full refund of their move-in fee, plus interest. ERM declined, however, to
offer any settlement to the putative class, at least until such time as class discovery
and certification were complete. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that ERM, in response to the Perrys’ February 23 demand letter,
offered the Perrys the sum of $99.46 in settlement and that ERM
refused to offer any settlement to the class. In all other respects, SOF No. 110 is
denied, as the March 6, 2012 letter makes no mention of class discovery or class
certification, nor does it make any reference to interest or the method or manner of
calculating interest on the move-in fee.

111.

On May 8, 2012, Miller filed suit – also on a class basis, and also for move-in fees
only. [Case No. 12-10836-RWZ, Doc No. 1; Miller Admission Nos. 24-26.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

31

112.

Also on May 8, 2012, Miller sent ERM a Chapter 93A class demand letter,
demanding a refund of move-in fees only. [White Aff. ¶ 3.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that on May 8, 2012, Miller sent ERM a Chapter 93A class demand
letter, demanding a refund of move-in fees or amenity fees on a class basis. This
demand also encompasses the fee that ERM has labeled a “community fee,” as that
fee is the same as the move-in fee or amenity fee, the only difference being that the
community fee is collected at a later time.

113.

On May 25, 2012, ERM offered Miller a full refund of her move-in fee, plus interest,
but declined to make any class offers until a class was certified. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that ERM, in response to the Miller’s May 8, 2012 demand letter,
offered Miller the sum of $525 in settlement and that ERM refused to offer any
settlement to the class. In all other respects, SOF No. 113 is denied, as the March 25,
2012 letter makes no mention of class certification, nor does it make any reference to
interest or the method or manner of calculating interest on the move-in fee.

114.

On August 24, 2012, Miller and the Perrys sent a combined Chapter 93A demand
letter seeking from ERM a refund of application fees and monthly pet fees, on behalf
of themselves and all Massachusetts tenants similarly situated. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted, except that Plaintiffs deny that the August 24, 2012 demand was only for
Application fees and monthly pet fees; rather, the demand was for pet fees generally,
which included up-front pet fees, as well as monthly pet fees.

32

115.

On September 26, 2012, ERM offered Plaintiffs’ a full refund of the application fees
(for both Miller and the Perrys) and the monthly pet fees (for the Perrys), plus
interest, but declined to make any class offers. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

116.

Neither Miller nor the Perrys ever sent ERM a Chapter 93A letter demanding a refund
of any up-front pet fees or community fees, nor did they ever pay either of these fees.
[Miller Admission Nos. 19-21; Perry Admission Nos. 15, 19.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Denied for the reasons stated in Responses to SOF Nos. 109, 112 and 114 above,
except that Plaintiffs admit that they did not pay any up-front pet fees. See also
Responses to SOF Nos. 17, 36, 63 and 101.

117.

On February 19, 2013, Plaintiffs’ filed a Consolidated and Amended Class Action
Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) seeking relief pursuant to both G.L. c. 186, § 15B
and G.L. c. 93A, § 2. [ECF Doc No. 41.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Admitted.

118.

In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs’ seek a refund of ERM’s move-in fee, just as
they had in their initial complaints. [Id.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Denied as stated, because in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek, among other

33

things, a refund for all Class members of fees charged by ERM and defined as
“amenity fees,” consisting of fees labeled as move-in fees, amenity fees or
community fees.
119.

In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs’ seek a refund of ERM’s application fee and
monthly pet fee, both fees that Plaintiffs’ did not contest in their initial complaints.
[Miller Admission Nos. 24-26; Perry Admission Nos. 22-24.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that the Amended Complaint seeks, among other things, a refund for
Class members of application fees and pet fees, consisting of both monthly pet fees
and up-front pet fees and that Plaintiffs’ initial complaints did not include claims for
application fees or pet fees.

120.

In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs’ seek a refund of ERM’s up-front pet fee and
community fee, both fees that Plaintiffs’ did not contest in their initial complaints, nor
in fact were Plaintiffs’ ever charged them by ERM. [Miller Admission Nos. 19-21,
24-26; Perry Admission Nos. 15, 19, 22-24.]
Plaintiffs’ Response:
Plaintiffs admit that in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek, among other things,
a refund for Class members of up-front pet fees and community fees paid by them,
that Plaintiffs’ initial complaints did not include claims for pet fees or community
fees, and that none of the Plaintiffs paid an up-front pet fee. Plaintiffs also admit that
they did not pay a fee labeled as a “community fee,” but that the community fee
charged and collected by ERM is the same fee as the move-in fee that the Plaintiffs

34

paid, the only difference being that it is collected at a later time. See Responses to
SOF Nos. 17, 36, 63, 101, 109, 112.
PLAINTIFFS’ STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL
UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS
Plaintiffs submit the following statement of undisputed material facts in opposition to
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and in support of their Cross-Motion for Summary
Judgment.
P1.

During the time that ERM charged an application fee, a non-refundable move-in

fee and a community fee to its Massachusetts tenants, those fees were, aside from certain welldefined exceptions, mandatory and not optional, as “all residents have to pay [application fees
and non-refundable move-in fees].” [March 15, 2011 e-mail from Megan Beaman to Tessi
Dahlen, ERM 009836-9838, at 9836 (Exhibit 13 hereto); Lebling Dep. at 28, 35; Beihoffer Dep.
at 45-46, 51, 55-56, 72, 73]
P2.

The only exceptions to the non-refundable move-in fee for ERM’s Massachusetts

tenants were: a) affordable housing participants; b) Section 8 Program participants; c) tenants
renewing their leases; d) tenants transferring from one unit to another in the same community;
and e) waivers of the fee at various times in order to attract potential tenants. [Defendant’s
Revised and Amended Answers to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Interrogatories (“Revised Answers”),
No. 1 (Exhibit 1 hereto).]
P3.

Massachusetts is the only state in which ERM charges a “community” fee.

[Beihoffer Dep. at 72-74.]
P4.

The community fee is disclosed to ERM tenants in an addendum to the lease, and

may, in certain circumstances, be disclosed to tenants or prospective tenants at an earlier time.

35

[Massachusetts Non-Refundable Community Fee training slides (Exhibit 10 hereto), at 3;
Beihoffer Dep. at 69-70.]
P5.

Massachusetts tenants commit or agree to pay the community fee at the time they

sign the lease. [Beihoffer Dep. at 75]
P6.

The initials “NRM,” as used by ERM or Equity personnel in internal

communications, refer to “non-refundable move-in fee.” [Bora Dep. at 29.]
P7.

After ERM stopped collecting up-front pet fee in February, 2012, as a result of the

decision in Hermida (See SOF No. 27), ERM increased its security deposit for pet-owning
tenants in order to compensate for the loss of the up-front pet fees. [February 28, 2012 e-mail
from Lynn Bora to Dave Romano, ERM 009128-9129 at 9128 (Exhibit 14 hereto); February 29,
2012 e-mail from Lynn Bora to Tom Lebling, ERM 009761-9762 at 9761 (Exhibit 6 hereto).]
