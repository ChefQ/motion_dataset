Plaintiff,
v.
Daniel David Rigmaiden,

GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS
REQUESTING THE COURT TO
ORDER CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT
SERVICES

Defendant.

15
16

The United States, through undersigned counsel, responds to Defendant’s “Motion

17 Requesting The Court To Order Defendant’s Private Investigator To Do His Job, Or, In The
18 Alternative, To Dismiss The Case With Prejudice” (CR 813), “Motion Requesting The Court
19 To Order Defendant’s Shadow Counsel To Locate A Runner Service For Defendant” (CR 814),
20 and “Motion Requesting The Court To Order Mr. Horne To Do His Job Or, In The Alternative,
21 To Dismiss The Case With Prejudice” (CR 815).
22

The Criminal Justice Act states that indigent defendants can obtain through ex parte

23 application “investigative, expert, or other services necessary for adequate representation.” See
24 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1); see also United States v. Armstrong, 621 F.2d 951, 956 (9th Cir. 1980)
25 (“[T]he Criminal Justice Act requires a district court to authorize defense services for an indigent
26 defendant ‘in circumstances in which a reasonable attorney would engage such services for a
27 client having the independent financial means to pay for them.’”); United States v. Sims, 617
28 F.2d 1371, 1375 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that district court’s failure to appoint defense expert

1 under 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1) is not constitutional violation absent showing of prejudice by
2 clear and convincing evidence).
3

Defendant claims in his motions that certain services are necessary for his defense, and

4 that the individuals currently performing the services are not up to the task. At this time, the
5 United States takes no position on these requests for services or the selection of particular
6 individuals to perform them. The United States opposes, however, Defendant’s alternative
7 request for dismissal of the charges with prejudice. Defendant provides no authority suggesting
8 that dismissal of charges with prejudice is an appropriate remedy in this context.
