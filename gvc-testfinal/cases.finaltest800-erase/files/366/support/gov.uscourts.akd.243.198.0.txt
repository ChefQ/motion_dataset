No. 3:92-cv-0734-HRH

The State of Alaska respectfully moves to strike, or requests that the Court otherwise
disregard, Exhibits 1-3 and related online references to the Peratrovich parties’ “which waters”
reply brief (Docket 188). Those exhibits and references are speculative inadmissible hearsay,
substantially post-date promulgation of the agency rule being reviewed in this case, go way
beyond the administrative record, and could not possibly have been relied on for the Tongass
Forest withdrawals a century ago on which the Peratrovich claims rely. The State recognizes

that the Peratrovich reply brief was filed two months ago, yet feels compelled to bring this matter
to the Court’s attention for the record.
1.

The Federal Defendants adopted their rule asserting federal reserved water rights

(FRWRs) in January, 1999. 64 Fed.Reg. 1276 (Jan. 8, 1999); AR Tab 413. This Court has held
that rulemaking was a lawful procedural vehicle by which to identify the Federal Defendants’
claims to FRWRs for ANILCA Title VIII jurisdiction. Order dated May 17, 2007 at 26-27, 32
(Doc. 110). As a result of that ruling, this is a judicial review case in which review is restricted
to the administrative record plus those materials (such as maps, public records, and standard
references) of which the Court may properly take judicial notice. See, e.g., State’s Which Waters
Opp. Brief at 8 n. 21 (Doc. 169 at 21) & State’s Which Waters Reply Br. at 12-13 incl. n. 14
(Doc. 182 at 21-22); see also Fed.R.Evid. 802.
2.

In their Supplemental Reply Brief on the “Which Waters” Issue, the Peratrovich

parties rely upon and attach and/or cite the online references to four documents that post-date the
January 1999 rule adoption, were not part of the administrative record, are not needed to explain
or fill gaps in the administrative record or to respond to any non-record matter relied upon by
the Federal Defendants in their rule adoption, and are inadmissible hearsay. These materials
are: (1) a 2002 article by Scott M. Gende, et al., entitled “Pacific Salmon in Aquatic and
Terrestrial Ecosystems;” (2) a 2003 article by DD Mathewson, et al., entitled “Nitrogen Uptake
in Riparian Plant Communities Across a Sharp Ecological Boundary of Salmon Density;” (3) a
2000 publication “Great Bear Rainforest”; and (4) a February, 2000 article by Ted Gresh, et al.,
entitled “Salmon Decline Creates Nutrient Deficit in Northwest Streams.” See Peratrovich Reply
Br. at pp. 10, 11 & 13 incl. notes 13-17 & 22, and Exhibits 1, 2 & 3 (Docs. 188, 188-2, 190-2,
and 193-2) (Exhibits spread over several ECF numbers).

Peratrovich claims these publications show that President Theodore Roosevelt in

1902, 1907, and 1909 must have implicitly intended to reserve federal water rights in the marine
waters in the area of the Tongass Forest because, in Peratrovich’s view: (1) marine waters are
necessary as a medium for salmon to swim in; (2) salmon use these waters to swim upstream to
spawn and then die; (3) the bodies of decomposing salmon are allegedly necessary to fertilize
trees; and (4) ensuring a supply of timber is a primary purpose of the 1902, 1907, and 1909
Tongass reservations. Peratrovich Reply at pp.10-11 (Doc. 188). Peratrovich cites the articles
as allegedly supporting point (3) in this chain of reasoning. These articles when read closely
actually undermine rather than support Peratrovich’s remarkable conclusions. 1 But as a
threshold matter they are plainly non-record, post-decisional, hearsay documents not otherwise
admissible in this matter in the first place.
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, the Court should strike or otherwise disregard Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 and
related online references to the Peratrovich Supplemental Reply Brief from its consideration of
the pending “which waters” briefing. A proposed Order is attached.

1

The most comprehensive of the four publications cited by Peratrovich (the article by Gende, et
al.) concludes that any link between salmon-derived nutrients and the health of animals and plants in a
narrow “riparian zone” immediately adjacent to water has never been thoroughly examined and that there
is a danger of overstating it through speculation. “Although it is intuitively appealing to assume that such
evidence suggests that productivity [of adjacent riparian areas] is enhanced [by salmon-derived nutrients],
studies confirming such productivity have not been done.” Gende, et al., Peratrovich Reply Exh. 1 at 3 &
9 (Doc. 188-2 at 4 & Doc. 193-2 at 1) See also id., Exh. 1 at 6 (Doc. 188-2 at 7) (because certain trees
produce nitrogen, “the importance of salmon-derived [nitrogen] may be less than commonly assumed
….”). The articles agree this is a new area of research. Of course, none of this new research was
available at the time the Tongass reservations were made in the early 1900s.
