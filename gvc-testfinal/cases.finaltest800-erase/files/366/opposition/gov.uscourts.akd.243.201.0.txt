INTRODUCTION

The Peratrovich plaintiffs completed their briefing on the "Which Waters" phase in
the jointly managed Katie John and Peratrovich cases on April 7, 2008. Two and one
half months later, the State belatedly asks this Court to strike or otherwise "disregard"
evidentiary material submitted along with that brief. Because the evidentiary material is

properly before the Court, and given the delay in the State's request, the State's motion

should be denied.

ARGUMENT

I. The Evidence is Responsive to New Argument by the State in its
Response.

The State of Alaska cannot have it both ways. First, it went to great lengths to
persuade this Court that the resolution of the "which waters" issue would be facilitated if
placed in a factual context. E.g., State of Alaska Plan for Briefing the "Which Waters"
Issues (Docket 113 in case number 3:05-cv-00006-HRH filed 06/01/2007). Indeed, as
noted by the State itself:

The court believes that everyone's understanding of the "which waters"
issue and how it should be resolved will be enhanced by briefing which

has a factual context.

June 29, 2007 Order on Motions to Amend Briefing Schedule (Docket 131 in
case number 3:05-cv-00006-HRH filed 06/29/2007) at 8-9.

Yet now the State wants to prevent the Court from considering facts directly
responsive to the State's (factually unsupported) claim that: "Salt Water Is Not Needed
to Make Trees Grow or Freshwater Rivers Flow." State of Alaska's Brief in Opposition
to the Katie John and Peratrovich Plaintiffs' Opening Briefs on Which Waters (Docket
169-1 in case number 3:05-cv-00006-HRH filed 01/07/2008) at 47 (Caption of Section
IV(C)(1)). Within that section, the State argues, again without citation to any factual
support of any kind whatsoever: "Peratrovich claims, contrary to all plain facts, that a
FRWR in marine (i.e., salt) waters is necessary to provide a `continuous supply of
timber and to protect flows of rivers within the [Tongass] forest." State's Brief in
Opposition at 47 (emphasis supplied). The State should not be allowed to: 1)
successfully represent that these issues must be placed in a factual context; 2) claim
that argument on an issue is "contrary to all plain facts;" and then 3) have this Court

strike the "plain facts" that the State claims do not exist and which demonstrate the
necessity of marine waters to fulfill the primary purpose for creation of the Tongass
National Forest.

The factual material the State asks this Court to "disregard" is responsive to, and
demonstrates the lack of merit in, a number of the State of Alaska's unsupported factual
allegations. Given the legal maxim that the failure to respond to an argument is the
concession of the argument, the evidentiary material submitted by the Peratrovich
plaintiffs is not only admissible, it was necessary to show the lack of merit in the State's
unsupported claims. Scognamillo v. Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, 2005 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 20221, at *22 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2005)(`"failure to respond to arguments
essentially concedes them'). The State of Alaska invited the factual response of the
Peratrovich parties, and should not now be heard to object after its invitation was
accepted.

Hl. Articles Published in Scientific Journals are Admissible.

The State recognized the admissibility of the evidence it now seeks to strike when it
conceded that the Court can rely on "those materials (such as maps, public records,
and standard references) of which the Court may properly take judicial notice." State's
Brief in Opposition at 8 n.19. Specifically, Fed. R. Evid. 803 (8) provides that public
records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or
agencies are admissible, and Fed. R. Evid. 803 (18) provides that published periodicals
on the subject of science established as a reliable authority by judicial notice are not
excluded by the hearsay rule. The Peratrovich plaintiffs' Exhibits 1 and 4 fall within the
hearsay exceptions of Rule 803 (8) and (18). Exhibit 1 is a National Park Service

document, and Exhibit 4 is the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan for
2008. Exhibits 2 and 3 fall within the hearsay exception of Rule 803 (18) as they are
articles from scientific periodicals of which the court may take judicial notice. This is
particularly true where, as here, the evidence is offered as rebuttal to unsupported
factual assertions by the State. Cf. Reilly v. Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 275 (1949)(*It
certainly is illogical, if not actually unfair, to permit witnesses to give expert opinions
based on book knowledge, and then deprive the party challenging such evidence of all
opportunity to interrogate them about divergent opinions expressed in other reputable
books').

lll. APA Review Limitations do not Apply to the "Which Waters" Issue
Before the Court.

This case was brought by the Peratrovich plaintiffs, not as an APA challenge to rule
making, but as a cause of action under section 807 of ANILCA, 16 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3117, to
enforce the application of the subsistence priorities in section 804 of ANILCA, 16 U.S.C.
0x00A7 3114. As this Court has specifically held, the relief sought by the Peratrovich Plaintiffs
"ig plainly available under the judicial enforcement provision of ANILCA, 16 U.S.C. 0x00A7
3117, if available administrative remedies have been exhausted. Here, the available
administrative remedies have been exhausted." May 31, 2006 Order on Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings (Docket 178 in case number 3:92-cv-00734-HRH filed
05/31/2006) at 22.

Nothing in section 807 of ANILCA limits the rights of the Peratrovich plaintiffs to facts
or documents in the administrative record when seeking to have the Secretaries extend
subsistence priorities to all "public lands" in Alaska as required by section 102 of

ANILCA, 16 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3102. The State concedes as much given that it does not seek to

strike any of the exhibits or citation to online references attached to or otherwise
included in the Peratrovich Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief on the "which waters" issue.
Finally, as noted by the State itself:

The Court appears to have answered the first, "what process', issue to
the extent it intends to by ruling in its May 17, 2007 Order (Docket No.
110) that the federal regulations are an appropriate identification of
where the Federal agencies claim to have FRWR for subsistence
regulation purposes but that those regulations are nota conclusive
determination of any such rights. Order at 26-27. In other words, as
the State understands that Order, the Federal Defendants may assert
such jurisdiction through that rulemaking and without conclusively
adjudicating the correctness of those claims as a pre-condition to
asserting such jurisdiction, but the actual existence of such
jurisdiction, and its extent, is not conclusively established by that
administrative rule, as to any particular water body, portion of
water body, or category of water bodies."

State of Alaska Plan for Briefing the "Which Waters" Issues (Docket 113 in case
number 3:05-cv-O0006-HRH filed 06/01/2007) at 2 (emphasis supplied).

IV. | The Challenged Evidence Corroborates the Historical Record, which
Demonstrates that the Tongass National Forest included Marine
Waters Critical to Fulfilling the Primary Purpose for Creation of this
Federal Reservation.

The State, again without citation to legal authority, claims that subsequent scientific
evidence confirming the validity of articulated reasons to include marine waters in a
federal reserve is inadmissible. Not only does the proffered evidence directly contradict
the State's claims regarding the interdependence of marine waters and adjacent forests,
that same evidence also confirms that reasons articulated over a century ago for
including marine waters in the Tongass National Forest have since been shown to be
scientifically valid.

As noted in earlier briefing (facts left entirely unchallenged by the State), the
Tongass National Forest was created with boundaries intentionally drawn to include

marine waters because of their importance to the ecology of the forests. See
Supplemental Brief of Related Case Plaintiffs Peratrovich, et al., on the "Which Waters"
Issue (Docket 150-1 in case number 3:05-cv-00006-HRH filed 10/29/07 ) at 6-16
(Section IV(D)(facts uncontested by State of Alaska). One of the men relied upon
heavily by President Theodore Roosevelt when establishing the Tongass National
Forest was F. E. Olmsted of the Forestry Bureau's inspection service. Chief Forester
Gifford Pinchot sent Olmsted to Alaska to investigate and consider whether the
Alexander Archipelago should be abolished or additional reserves should be
established. Olmsted filed a report that argued in favor of reserving the "whole of
Southeast Alaska." Recognizing the importance of the Pacific Ocean in shaping the
character of this federal forest, Olmsted observed that:

The most striking feature of the whole region is the wonderful system of

deep water-ways. Until this is thoroughly comprehended no true idea of

the general conditions can be had. It is the sea which makes this region

unique. The islands are fairly cut to pieces by innumerable tongues of the

ocean, and upon this ocean and its numberless inlets transportation is

wholly dependent. The sea is the life of the country; without it there would

be no life, no industry.

Olmsted added that "[mJen and freight move by boat only, subject to the ever
changing moods of sea, wind and tide. In this lies the great distinction between the
inland reserves of the States and the marine forest of south-east Alaska." As a result, in
his 1906 report on the Alexander Archipelago, Olmsted proposed that the forest be
greatly expanded to include the waters and open ocean such that "the whole country"

would be a reserve (emphasis in original). This report formed the basis for the

expansion of the Tongass National Forest in 1909. Peratrovich Supplemental Brief at 8-

12.

Case 3:05-cv-00006-HRH Document 201 Filed 07/07/2008 Page 7 of9

Olmstead's understanding of the interdependency of the ocean and the forest has
subsequently been proven to be true, as demonstrated by the evidence at issue in this
motion. Simply because Olmstead did not read these reports before writing his own
does not diminish the evidentiary value of these reports in confirming the validity of
Olmstead's understanding of the need to include marine waters in the Tongass National
Forest.

V. The State's Motion is Untimely.

The State concedes in its motion that it waited to file the motion until months after
the evidence to which it objects was submitted to the Court. Motion to Strike at 1-2.
That failure to timely bring the motion waives the objection the State now makes. Auto
Drive-Away Co., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 360 F.2d 446, 448-49 (5th Cir.
1966) (holding that, absent timely motion to strike, affidavit's non-compliance with
procedural rules waived); see also 1 Jack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger,
Weinstein's Federal Evidence 0x00A7 103.11 (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 1997)(An
objection is 'timely' if it is made as soon as the opponent knows, or should know, that
the objection is applicable)(footnotes omitted); cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)(motion to strike
must be filed within twenty days). The State offers no explanation or excuse for its
admitted failure to timely object, instead merely saying it raises the belated objection
now, "for the record." The State's failure to offer any acceptable excuse for the untimely
filing of the motion further confirms the propriety of denying the relief now sought by the
State.

Clearly here, the "objection" was known to the State months ago. Indeed, the State
itself objected to certain exhibits offered by the Katie John plaintiffs months ago (e.g.

Case 3:05-cv-00006-HRH Document 201 Filed 07/07/2008 Page 8of9

State's Brief in Opposition at 8 n.21). Yet, as noted in the Peratrovich reply brief
(Related Case Peratrovich Plaintiffs Supplemental Rely Brief (Docket 188-1 in case
number 3:05-cv-00006-HRH filed 04/07/2008) at 2 n.3), neither the U.S. nor the State
raised any objection to the Peratrovich Plaintiffs' exhibits. In footnote 3 of their reply,
the Peratrovich Plaintiffs specifically point out that this Court's review is not limited to
the administrative record. That is especially true here where the Court asked that a
factual context be provided to put the legal argument into context.

Having failed to timely object to the evidentiary submissions at issue here, having
known of its potential objection months ago as demonstrated by its objection to other
proffered evidence, offering no excuse for its failure to timely object, and having waited
ten weeks before noting its complaint, the State's objection to the evidence offered by
way of its delayed motion to strike should be deemed untimely and denied.

VI. There is no Legal Support for the State's Request that the Court
"Disregard" the Evidence.

Finally, the State's request that the Court "disregard" the evidence must be denied.
The State did not cite any authority for the proposition that the sought after relief is
appropriate, apparently because none exists. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, when
considering a similar issue, has held that it is improper for a district court to "disregard"
evidence without ruling on the merits of a motion to strike. Parries v. Makino, Inc., 122
Fed. Appx. 826, at *834-35; 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 26612 at *23 (6th Cir. Dec. 21,
2004)(describing as puzzling district court's ruling that timely motion to strike was moot
because court had "made no reference" to the proferred evidence, directing court on

remand to make explicit ruling on the motion).
