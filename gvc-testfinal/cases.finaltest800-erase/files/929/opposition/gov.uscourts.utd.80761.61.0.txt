Plaintiff,
v.

Case No.: 2:11cv00558 CW

THOMAS JEFFERSON SCHOOL OF LAW,
et al,
Defendants.

Defendant responds to Plaintiff’s filings docketed as numbers 59 and 60 by incorporating by
reference its response to Plaintiff’s items docketed as numbers 19, 29, 30, 31, 51, and 56 which they
appear to replicate in whole or in part.
In short, Plaintiff has shown herself incapable of adhering to the rules of civil procedure, has
failed to follow the requirements of Rule 4 Fed. R. Civ. P. and has shown no reason why the
