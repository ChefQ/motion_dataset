Summons serves as a response to that statement to ensure that all defendants are part of
Plaintiff s cause of action.
I certify that I served a copy of the Complaint and Summons on the following defendants
by mail, registered agent or commercial courier service that requires the defendant to sign a
receipt and provides for return of that receipt to me.
The original document acknowledging receipt via registered agent in on file with the
court.
Plaintiff made substantial effort to send a copy of Complaint and Summons to each
individual defendant via Certified Mail, Restricted Delivery, but these copies were returned to
Plaintiff with notification from U.S. Postal Service and Postmaster that Defendants noted below
refused to claim the letters.
For those Defendants marked with a letter "A" next to their name, first attempt for
delivery was made on June 8, 2011; second attempt was made on June 16,2011; mail was
returned, via hand-delivery by Postmaster, "returned to sender" on July 8, 2011.
For those Defendants marked with a letter "B" next to their name, first attempt for
delivery was made on June 9, 2011; second attempt was made on June 21, 2011; mail was
returned to the post office June 28, 2011; a note requiring Plaintiff to pick up mail was left on
July 20, 2011 and July 26, 2011; Plaintiff picked up returned mail on July 28, 2011.
For those Defendants marked with a letter "c" next to their name, first attempt for
delivery was made on June 9, 2011; second attempt was made on June 21, 2011; mail was
returned to the post office June 28,2011; a note requiring Plaintiff to pick up mail was left on
July 24, 2011; Plaintiff picked up returned mail on July 28, 2011.

MOTION FOR ORDER DECLARING ALL DEFENDANTS PROPERLY SERVED

Plaintiff argues that Defendants intentionally refused delivery of Plaintiff's documents
because Defendants knew what the documents were and did not want to accept them or were
advised by counsel not to accept any correspondence from Plaintiff.
Plaintiff further argues that refusing delivery essentially put Defendants on notice of said
action. After all, it is not common practice for a law school to refuse delivery of documents from
their students unless they are told to so.
The original documents acknowledging refusal of delivery are already on file with the
court.
THEREFORE,
Plaintiff requests:
1. An order is entered certifying that proper service has been made against all defendants
listed above;
2. An order is entered stating that no further action is necessary for proper service;
3. An order is entered stating that all defendants have been put on notice of Plaintiff's
complaint and summons;
4. An order is entered stating that all defendants are therefore, proper defendants and are a
party to this lawsuit.
OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
MOTION FOR SUBSTITUTED SERVICE

According to Utah Rules of Civil Procedure 4( d)( 4), "If you cannot find the person to be
served after using reasonable diligence, or if you can show the court that the person is avoiding

service, you can ask permission to serve the complaint and summons (or other document
required to be served under URCP 4) by some other means." Utah Rules of Civil Procedure 4
also permit "someone outside Utah to be served in the same way as someone in Utah, following
URCP 4".
Plaintiff avers that it is impractical to secure personal service of process in this cause of
action upon Defendants, either by certified or registered mail or by delivery to Defendants in
person because said Defendants, are refusing to accept any certified or registered mail for the
purpose of evading service of process. Furthermore, Thomas Jefferson School of Law is
Defendants' usual place of business, which makes it highly unlikely that Defendants' would not
have received Plaintiffs Complaint and Summons after three attempts.
Plaintiff avers that Defendants, Rudy Hasl, Jeffrey Joseph, Beth Kransberger, Eric
Mitnick, Julie Garrett, Claire Wright, Joy Delman, Julie Cromer-Young, Arnold Rosenberg, Jane
Larrington, Patrick Meyer, Lisa Ferreira, Jan Dauss, Lisa Chigos and All Members of the Ethics
Committee of Thomas Jefferson School of Law 2006-2011 consciously avoided service of
. process. In a calculated manner, they avoided service of process four times: three times via
certified mail and one time via registered agent found listed on the State of California's Secretary
of State's website for finding registered agents.h1tl2://k@Jer.sos.ca.gov/cbs.aspx (last accessed
May 6,2011).
Specifically with regard to Jeff Joseph, confirmed in an email dated, May 27,2011, he
was put on notice of the lawsuit because he informed me that Plaintiff did not properly serve the
other individuals named in the lawsuit. He cannot now claim no notice of the lawsuit. He also

contacted and retained attorney Robert Wilde, who is the defense attorney in the pending
litigation.
Plaintiff contends that Defendants have purposely avoided service of process and that
Plaintiff has more than satisfied the reasonable diligence standards required for alternative
standards in getting all seventeen individual defendants served.
Therefore, Plaintiff requests any of the following methods be allowed as viable means for
giving above named Defendants notice of Complaint and Summons:
1. Allow a copy of the complaint and summons to be issued via electronic email to the
email address for each defendant as listed on their employer's website;
2. Direct attorney Robert Wilde to advise other defendants of complaint and summons and
provide a copy of such to each;
3. Direct Jeffrey Joseph, General Counsel for Thomas Jefferson School of Law, who is
already aware of this lawsuit to provide notice and advise other defendants of complaint
and summons and provide a copy of such to each; and/or
4. Allow publication in the San Diego Reader, one of the most common newspapers in San
Diego County and which is distributed to Thomas Jefferson School of Law on a daily
basis.
Plaintiff further requests that the costs for attempting service via certified mail and
certified agent be paid directly to her because defendants have purposely, and knowingly avoided
service of process and, although Plaintiff has not requested a waiver of service as of yet,
URCP 4(f) allows the court to impose on the defendants the costs incurred in effecting service.
