I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

On February 18, 2009, Plaintiff Adriean Delaney' filed this lawsuit against Geisha NYC,
LLC d/b/a Japonais, Miae Lim, Lester Burgher, Richard Wahlstedt, and Jeffrey Beers
(collectively "Defendants" or "Japonais'"') seeking unpaid wages under the Fair Labor Standards
Act ("FLSA") and New York law. Plaintiff brought the FLSA claim on behalf of himself and all
non-exempt persons employed by Japonais in a tipped position ("Covered Employees") within
the last three years ("FLSA Period"). The Complaint alleges that Defendants (1) failed to pay
Covered Employees the proper minimum wage under the FLSA and New York Labor Law
("NYLL"); (2) unlawfully retained portions of Covered Employees' tips in violation of the
NYLL,; (3) failed to pay Covered Employees the spread of hours premium required by New York
law on workdays lasting longer than ten (10) hours; and (4) failed to compensate Covered
Employees for the cost of their uniforms or provide them with a laundry premium as required by
New York law.

By this motion", Plaintiffs seek the following:

(1) Conditional certification of the FLSA claim as a representative collective action

pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b).?

 

' Since Plaintiff commenced this action, seven other individuals have opted-in to the lawsuit as
party plaintiffs. Plaintiff and the other opt-ins are hereafter referred to as "Plaintiffs."

Case 1:09-cv-01458-WHP Document 29 ~ Filed 06/26/2009 Page 7 of 21

(2) Court-facilitated notice of this FLSA action to Covered Employees, including a
consent form (or opt-in form) as authorized by the FLSA.

(3) Approval of the proposed FLSA notice of this action and the consent form.

(4) Production of names, last known mailing addresses, alternate addresses, telephone
numbers, Social Security numbers, and dates of employment of all Covered Employees.

(5) Posting of the Notice, along with consent forms, in a conspicuous location in
Japonais Restaurant.

IL. BACKGROUND

Defendants collectively own and operate Japonais Restaurant in Manhattan. Plaintiffs
have worked as tipped employees at Japonais within the last three years.

Defendants systematically pay Plaintiffs and all other Covered Employees pursuant to
federal and state tip credits that entitle restaurant employers to pay tipped employees a lower
minimum wage as long as the employees earn a certain amount in tips. 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 203(m); 12
N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. 0x00A7 137-1.5; (Delaney Decl. 2; Duverger Decl. { 2; Feld Decl.
2: Feld Ex, 2; Powell Decl. 2; Weber Decl. 0x00A7 2.). Currently, the federal minimum wage for
food service workers who receive tips is $2.13 per hour, as opposed to the regular minimum
wage of $6.55 per hour. 29 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 203(m), 206. The current New York minimum wage for
tipped food service workers is $4.60 per hour, as opposed to the regular minimum wage of $7.15
per hour. 12 N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. 0x00A7 137-1.5.

Under the FLSA, an employer of tipped employees must pay its employees the full
hourly minimum wage unless the employer satisfies certain requirements, in which case the

employer may pay a lower direct cash wage. To avail itself of the tip credit, (1) the hourly rate

 

3 Plaintiffs do not currently seek class certification of their state law claims under Fed. R. Civ. P.
23 ("Rule 23").
Case 1:09-cv-01458-WHP Document 29 Filed 06/26/2009 Page 8 of 21

actually paid plus the employee's tips must equal or exceed the federal minimum wage; and (2)
the employee must retain all tips received, although she may pool her tips with employees "who
customarily and regularly receive tips." 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 203(m) (stating that the tip credit "shall not
apply with respect to any tipped employee unless such employee has been informed by the
employer of the provisions of this subsection, and all tips received by such employee have been
retained by the employee, except that this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the
pooling of tips among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips").

If a tip pool includes a manager or employees who do not customarily and regularly
receive tips, the employer may not take a tip credit and must pay its employees the full minimum
wage. Id.; Chung v. New Silver Palace Rest., 246 F. Supp. 2d 220, 230 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) ("The
taking of shares of waiters tips by [persons] with managerial authority . . . violates the statutory
condition that `all tips' received by the waiters and busboys be `retained' by the waiters and
busboys."); Ayres v. 127 Rest. Corp, 12 F. Supp. 2d 305, 308-309 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (finding that
as Defendant's manager "was not an employee `who customarily and regularly received tips,'"
he could not be part of the tip pool); Wajcman v. Investment Corp. of Palm Beach, No. 07 Civ.
80912, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21939, at *9 n.1 (S.D. Fla. March 20, 2008) ("[T]he practice of
forced sharing of tips with management is an illegal practice, regardless of whether the members
of management are also engaged in services that could be the subject of tipping. This type of tip
sharing is deemed to violate the statutory condition that `all tips' received by the employees be
`retained' by the `employees."").

Here, Japonais requires its tipped employees to participate in a mandatory tip pool
arrangement. (Duverger Decl. 0x00A7 3; Feld Decl. { 2; Powell Decl. 0x00A7 3; Weber Decl. 43.) The

terms of the tip pool are created and enforced by the restaurant's management and apply equally
Case 1:09-cv-01458-WHP Document 29 Filed 06/26/2009 Page 9 of 21

to all Covered Employees. (Delaney Decl. J] 4, 17; Duverger Decl. 3, 5, 18; Feld Decl. ff 3,
4, 18; Powell Decl. J] 3, 19; Weber Decl. J] 3, 5, 17.) This tip pool is illegal because it includes
managerial employees and/or non-service employees who do not customarily and regularly
receive tips from customers. Chung, 246 F. Supp. 2d at 229 (invalidating a tip pool in which
management participated); see also (Delaney Decl. 0x00A7 3; Duverger Decl. 5; Feld Decl. { 5;
Weber Decl. 7 5; Powell Decl. 4 5.).

Plaintiffs have identified specific managers who illegally participated in the tip pool,
namely, Ference Dominguez, Jerrad Ruiz, Roger Alcain, Kana Soto, Anna Maria Poveda Garces,
Humberto (Gino) De La Hoz, John Sweiss, and Nadir Nadir. (Delaney Decl. J 6; Duverger Decl.
{| 7; Feld Decl. 1 7; Powell Decl. J 6; Weber Dec. 0x00A7 6.) In determining whether an individual is a
manager, courts consider, inter alia, whether he or she has hiring and firing authority, supervises
staff, sets schedules, and grants time off. Chung, 246 F. Supp. 2d at 223 (stating that "the
authority to hire and fire employees [and] set work schedules" are managerial in nature); Ayres,
12 F. Supp. 2d at 308 & n.1 (stating that managerial duties include hiring, firing, suspending, and
supervising employees, and citing with approval a decision under the National Labor Relations
Act finding that supervisors who, infer alia, interviewed applicants and approved time off were
the employer's agents). The individuals Plaintiffs identified as managers had and exercised the
authority to do all of these things.

Defendants' own schedules list Messrs, Dominguez, Ruiz, Nadir, and Sweiss, as well as
Ms. Sato and Ms. Poveda Garces, as Maitre D'/Managers. (Schulman Ex. 3.) These same
individuals are included on Japonais' tip-out sheet, which clearly show that they receive tips.
(Schulman Ex. 4.) Mr. De La Hoz informed opt-in Plaintiff Stephanie Powell that these

individuals are listed as captains as opposed to managers on the tip out sheets so that they could
Case 1:09-cv-01458-WHP Document 29 Filed 06/26/2009 Page 10 of 21

receive tips. (Powell Decl. 75.) Mr. De La Hoz's business card stated that he was a manager,
reflecting his actual position. (/d.) These individuals' duties show that they were, in fact,
managers.

These managers had hiring and firing authority, which they exercised routinely.

(Delaney Decl. 0x00A7 8-9; Duverger Decl. ff 9-10; Feld Decl. J] 9-10; Powell Decl. {] 9-10; Weber
Decl. f 8-9.) All of the managers disciplined employees, supervised floor activity, assigned
Covered Employees to specific sections, dealt with customer complaints, conducted pre-shift
meetings, and had scheduling authority. (Delaney Decl. ff 10-16; Duverger Decl. ff 11-17; Feld
Decl. ff 11-17; Powell Decl. [J 11-17; Weber Decl. ff 11-16.) Managers only rarely engaged in
direct customer service; such activities were done on an as-needed basis and were merely
incidental to their managerial duties. (Delaney J 7; Duverger {| 8; Feld 0x00A7 8; Powell { 8).
Wajcman, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21939, at *8, 12 (stating that an employee who customarily
and regularly receives tips is one who has "more than de minimis service interaction with
customers" and that the court must "look[] to both the quantity and quality of customer
interaction"); cf Chung, 246 F. Supp. 2d at 229 ("[T]he practice of forced sharing of tips with
management is . . . an illegal practice, regardless of whether the members of management were
engaged in restaurant services that could be the subject of tipping.").

Plaintiffs' declarations identify numerous specific examples of managers exercising their
managerial power by supervising and disciplining employees and controlling their schedules.
For example, Mr, Dominguez and Mr. Ruiz terminated an employee named Kenta Goto, and Ms.
Poveda Garces fired a lounge server named Josh. (Delaney Decl. {| 9; Duverger Decl. { 10,
Powell Decl. 0x00A7 10.) Mr. Dominguez disciplined opt-in Plaintiff Marc-Marie Duverger on

numerous occasions. (Duverger Decl. { 11.) Mr. Dominguez, Ms. Sato, and Mr. Ruiz all
