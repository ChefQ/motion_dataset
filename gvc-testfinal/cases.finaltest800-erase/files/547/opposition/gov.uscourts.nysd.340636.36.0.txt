I PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Plaintiff Adriean Delaney and the seven opt-in participants, former servers, lounge
servers, bartenders, and a host at Japonais, an upscale Japanese-fusion Restaurant located at 111
180x2122 Street in New York City ("Japonais" or the "Restaurant"), allege principally that they were
not paid the proper minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") because they
were forced to share tips with service captains-who they allege are members of management-
under Japonais' tip-out arrangement.! Although the servers frequently received hundreds of
dollars each night, due in no small part to the efforts of the service captains whose assistance
enabled them to service more tables at a time, Plaintiff contends that Japonais' tip-out policy
violated the FLSA because, in addition to their service and customer related duties, the captains
had some unspecified quasi-management duties. Plaintiff makes this allegation despite a recent
investigation of Japonais' pay practices by the New York State Department of Labor
("NYSDOL"), after which the NYSDOL determined no action was necessary regarding service
captains' inclusion in the tip-out pool. (See Declaration of Sandy Park, dated July 13, 2009
("Park Decl."), J 18).

Additionally, although Plaintiff purported to file the Complaint in this matter on
February 18, 2009, "individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated," it is not even
entirely clear what class he seeks to represent, as he states that he seeks to represent all "tipped
employees." Specifically, it is not clear whether the term "tipped employees" refers to those
positions at the Restaurant that receive tips directly from customers, which would include only

servers, lounge servers, and bartenders, or also to those positions that receive portions of tips

 

Plaintiff also alleges violations of New York Labor Law, which are not at issue in this motion, as any
class treatment of such claims is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, not FLSA 0x00A7 216(b).

? All declarations submitted by Defendants in opposition to the instant motion, which are referred to
herein, are attached as exhibits to the Declaration of A. Michael Weber, Esq., dated July 14, 2009.
Case 1:09-cv-01458-THK Document 36 _ Filed 07/14/09 Page 6 of 29

from the Restaurant's server tip-out pool.. Moreover, Plaintiff's proposed notice is addressed to
"all non-managerial tipped employees of Japonais," a group that would include the service
captains that Plaintiff asserts are not similarly situated to Plaintiff and the opt-in Plaintiffs. (See
Declaration of Denise A. Schulman, dated June 26, 2009 ("Schulman Decl.") Ex. 1).

The proposed notice then confusingly also makes reference to the right to make a
claim by all former hourly employees of the restaurant. Jd. As discussed below, servers and
bartenders are the only employees who receive tips directly from customers at the Restaurant.
Servers retain 66% of their tips for lunch shifts and 53% for dinner shifts. (Park Decl. { 8).
Bartenders who work at the public bar (as opposed to service bartenders, who make drinks for
customers dining in the dining room or lounge areas of the Restaurant) participate in a separate
"bar only" tip-out pool, in which they tip-out 25% of their tips to the barbacks and 5% of food
sales from the bar to food runners. (/d.). Plaintiff and the opt-in participants were all employed
for relatively short periods of time as servers, lounge servers, or bartenders, except for Tram
Dang, who also worked as a host before becoming a server. Hosts, such as opt-in Plaintiff, Tram
Dang, are not tipped by customers, nor do they share in the tip-out pool at the Restaurant. As
such, Ms. Dang did not participate in the tip-out pool until after she transferred positions from
host to server. Additionally, opt-in Plaintiffs Benjamin Weber and Sheree Hovsepian were
bartenders, who participated in the "bar only" tip-out pool, which did not include any service
captains. Consequently, as demonstrated further herein, Plaintiff has failed to meet the
requirements for conditional certification to set forth a proposed collective group that is similarly
situated and that was subjected to a common policy or practice that violated the FLSA. Thus, his
motion for conditional certification should be denied.

Moreover, Plaintiff has found only a handful of other potential collective action plaintiffs
Case 1:09-cv-01458-THK Document 36 _ Filed 07/14/09 Page 7 of 29

since filing his complaint nearly six months ago and even though the New York State
Department of Labor ("NYSDOL") began its investigation 2007. Consequently, Plaintiff now
seeks the gleam of a "court approved" notice of an FLSA action in the hopes of making his
claims seem more attractive, yet certification of a collective action and court-approved notice to
a potential class is not an appropriate method to determine whether others wish to join a
collective action. As such, this Court should not permit Plaintiff to use a judicially approved
notice to lend credence to claims that, to date, have not generated interest or support from the
overwhelming majority of the putative collective plaintiffs.

Finally, as explained below, Plaintiff bases his motion for conditional certification
chiefly on hearsay, hyperbole, and misrepresentations. Under any standard for certifying a
collective action, there must be some credible evidence showing that putative class members
were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the FLSA. Here, when the facts are
separated from the fictions drafted by Plaintiffs counsel, Plaintiff fails to meet this burden. The
goal of allowing employees who are owed wages to recover them is best served by proceeding
apace to resolve plaintiffs' claims individually, rather than continuing to litigate collective and
class action issues that do not benefit the actual plaintiffs.

For these reasons, conditional certification of Plaintiff's FLSA claims as a
collective action is simply not appropriate, and the Court should deny Plaintiff's motion in its

entirety.

Il. STATEMENT OF FACTS

On July 19, 2006, Defendant Geisha NYC LLC opened Japonais in New York City.
Individual Defendants Miae Lim, Lester Burgher, Richard Walhstedt, and Jeffrey Beers have

varying ownership interests and involvement in the Restaurant. (Park Decl. 0x00A7 2). Japonais hired
Case 1:09-cv-01458-THK Document 36 _ Filed 07/14/09 Page 8 of 29

its first food service employees in June 2006, and provided intensive, in-depth training from
approximately June 19 to July 19 regarding the special attributes of the Restaurant (Park Decl. J
3). Japonais opened its doors to the paying public on July 24, 2006. (/d.).

A. Facts Relating To Tipped Employees

Since its opening, Japonais has employed a team approach to servicing its
customers. While many restaurants provide service with just waiters and busboys, Japonais
utilizes a much broader team, each with specific service tasks, including service captains,
servers, food runners, bussers, assistant bussers, service bartenders, and barbacks, (collectively,
the "Service Employees"). (Id. 0x00A7 4). The Restaurant's Service Employees are well compensated.
During their training period, all Service Employees receive, at minimum, the applicable
minimum wage required by federal and state law, absent any deduction for the tip credit. Ud.
5). After their training period is complete, Service Employees begin receiving gratuities from
customers, as well as an hourly wage from Japonais. (/d.). The FLSA allows Japonais to take a
"tip credit" against the minimum wage by including in its calculation of wages a portion of the
amount that the Service Employees receive in tips. 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 203(m). With tips and wages,
the restaurant's tipped employees receive well in excess of the minimum wage.

All of the Service Employees share in the tips that are left by customers upon
payment of their checks, and which are collected by the servers. (Jd. J 8). Contrary to Plaintiff's
assertions, captains are not managers; rather, they are the liaisons between Restaurant
management and the Service Employees. (Jd. J 13; Declaration of Roberto Araujo, dated July 9,
2009 ("Araujo Decl."), yen 6). In fact, service captains spend the majority of their time performing
customer service duties, which include those of a traditional server, those of a host, and any other
service required to ensure that customers have an exceptional dining experience. (Park Decl. 0x00A7

14; Araujo Decl., J 5).
Case 1:09-cv-01458-THK Document 36 Filed 07/14/09 Page 9 of 29

Japonais' style of service and philosophy plays a big role in the particular
importance of captains at the Restaurant. (Park Decl. { 14). With two different kitchens and two
executive chefs, the Restaurant is essentially two restaurants combined into one so that
customers have more options from which to choose. (/d.). Due to its unique setup and menu
offerings, servers need to be able to explain the Restaurant concept, and ensure that the food is
served continuously, rather than in courses, as in more traditional restaurants. (Ud). The
captains help coordinate the food from both kitchens for the servers. (/d.; Araujo Decl., 95). In
addition to their contributions to traditional service, which include seating the diners, taking
orders, serving food and wine, making sure that the tables were being fully serviced, notifying
the kitchen of any special requirements, such as food allergies or substitutions, and
troubleshooting and fielding customer complaints and requests, captains are also required to
adjust for server errors. (Ud; Declaration of Sueshi Maeda, dated May 20, 2009 ("Maeda
Decl."), 0x00A7 6; Declaration of Bate Ning, dated May 21, 2009 ("Ning Decl."), 5; Declaration of
Jung Ki Park, dated June 3, 2009 ("Jung Ki Park Decl."), 0x00A7 7; Declaration of Juliana Kenworthy
("Kenworthy Decl."), dated June 3, 2009, 0x00A7 7; Araujo Decl. {f 5, 6).

Due to the extensive and unique nature and unfamiliarity of our menu and its
ingredients, guests may change their minds because they did not fully understand what they
ordered or how to consume it. (Park Decl. 0x00A7 14). Captains are there to remedy any errors by
servers, accommodate changes from guests, and communicate them properly to the kitchen and
upper management. (/d.; Araujo Decl., 0x00A7 5, 6). Thus, service captains are an integral part of the
service experience at Japonais, as their service of and interaction with customers enhances the
customers' dining experience and often increases the gratuities left for the servers. (Park Decl.

14).
Case 1:09-cv-01458-THK Document 36 Filed 07/14/09 Page 10 of 29

At opening, Japonais employed a tip pooling system. (Maeda Decl., 7 6; Ning
Decl., 0x00A7 8; Jung Ki Park Decl., 0x00A7 6). Under that system, each Service Employee was assigned a
point value, and on a given night, the points of all Service Employees on duty were aggregated
for a gross point total. (Park Decl. 7 6). Each night, all tips paid by diners were pooled and
divided by the gross point total, resulting in a dollar value for each point. (id). An individual's
share of the tip pool for the night was calculated by multiplying the individual's point value by
that night's dollar value for each point. (/d.). However, within approximately one month of
opening, the servers approached Restaurant management to propose that the Restaurant adopt a
tip-out policy instead. (Maeda Decl., 6; Ning Decl., 0x00A7 8; Jung Ki Park Decl., 4] 8; Park Decl., {
7).

The servers felt that a tip-out arrangement would better reward servers who had
busier nights, worked harder on a particular shift, or simply had more generous customers. Id.
Consequently, the servers suggested that, rather than have the servers combine their tips before
distributing them amongst all of the Service Employees, each individual server would "tip-out"
47% of his or her tips from the dinner shift and 34% of his or her tips from the lunch shift to
remaining members of the staff and would retain the remainder of his or her own tips.0x00B0 (Maeda
Decl., {ff 6, 8; Ning Decl., {{ 7-8; Park Decl., 0x00A7 8). Management agreed to institute this
voluntary tip-out policy. (Maeda Decl., 6; Ning Decl., 0x00A7 8; Park Decl., 0x00A7 7). During the
interview process, prospective new hires are informed of the Restaurant's tip-out policy and are
also given a consent form which they are asked to sign to indicate their agreement with the tip-
out arrangement before beginning work. (Maeda Decl., { 10; Park Decl. { 9).

Although service captains, food runners, bussers, assistant bussers, service

 

3 The lower tip-out percentage is used for the lunch shift because there are no barbacks or service
bartenders working the lunch shift.
