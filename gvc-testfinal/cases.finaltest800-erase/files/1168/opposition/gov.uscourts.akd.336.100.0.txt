Opposition to UNITED STATES' MOTION TO STRIKE COUNTERCLAIM
Come now, Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes
("the Hymes") with this Opposition to UNITED STATES' MOTION
TO STRIKE COUNTERCLAIM ("Motion").
The Hymes did reserve the right to amend their Answer to the
Amended Complaint by the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ("USA").
This is found Docket 85-1 page 21 being #27. The Hymes are
exercising this right to add other affirmative defenses
evidenced by Jennifer D. Auchterlonie's complete refusal to
provide even one piece of substantive evidence to. support
the USA's claim. If leave of this Court is required, then
the Hymes will ask for leave of this Court, otherwise the

Hymes will be forced to file in a separate Case and then

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document100 ~ Filed 04/02/2007 Page2of3

this Court will combine both Cases with this Court being
financially rewarded by the extra monies received for
filing.

Therefore, to conserve judicial resources, the Motion
should be DENIED; and, if a Motion for Leave of Court to
file the Counterclaim is required by this Court, the Hymes
motion this Court for leave to file the Counterclaim as the
Hymes did reserve the right to add other affirmative
defenses and no one objected then.
