its motion, the United States submits the following:

Hymes on Februar 8, 2007. In support of

1. Procedural History

On August 22, 2006, the United States filed a motion to amend the complaint in this

matter, to add allegations against defendant Rita M. Hymes. Dkt. #77. The Court granted the
United States' motion, Dkt. #83, and the amended complaint was fied on September 19,2006,

Dkt. #84.

On October 13,2006, defendants Donald L. Hymes and Rita M. Hymes filed an answer to

the amended complaint. Dkt. #85. The answer does not set forth any counterclaims against the
United States.

On November 22,2006, the Cour entered its Scheduling and Planing Order in this
matter. Dkt. #89. Pursuant to that order, motions to amend the pleadings must be served and
filed on or before December 22, 2006.
On Februar 8, 2007, defendants Donald L. Hymes and Rita M. Hymes filed their

counterclaim. Dkt. #90. Defendants did not fie a motion seeking leave of Court to file their

counterclaim.
2. Argument
Pursuant to Rule 13(t) of

the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure, defendants must obtain

leave of court to add a counterclaim that was omitted from its answer. Such leave may be
granted "( w )hen a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect, or when

justice requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(t); see Ralston-Purina Co. v.

Bertie, 541 F.2d 1363, 1367 (9th Cir. 1976).

Defendants have made no attempt to obtain leave of cour for the filing of their
counterclaim. The deadline for motions to amend pleadings in this matter was December 22,
2006. Defendants have failed to show

any cause for their late pleading.

Moreover, defendants have made no showing that the claims set forth in the counterclaim
arise out of

that of

the same transaction or occurence or otherwise concern the same subject matter as

the United States' Amended Complaint herein. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a), (b). While not

altogether clear, the facts alleged in the counterclaim appear to concern certain requests made by

defendants under the Freedom of Information Act and certain dealings between defendants and
IRS employees. Each ofthe 39 alleged causes of action in the counterclaim are entirely

incomprehensible.
Because defendants have failed to show

any cause for their late-filed counterclaim, and

have failed to show how the claims set forth in the counterclaim bear any relation to the case at
bar, the United States respectfully requests that the Court strike defendants' counterclaim.
Dated this i 5th day of March, 2007.

Respectfully Submitted,
