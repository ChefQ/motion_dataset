PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF COLLECTIVE ACTION AND
REQUEST FOR NOTICE TO POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS
PURSUANT TO SECTION 216(b)

 

Plaintiffs, Jose Angel Lopez and Michael James Lyons, Individually and on
behalf of all others similarly situated, ("Plaintiffs'"), file this Motion for Certification of
Collective Action and Request for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs and would show the
Court as follows:

I. SUMMARY OF CASE

1.1 Plaintiffs have filed a Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") claim against
Defendants Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc., Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services LLC f/k/a
Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services, Inc., and Archer Tubular Services LLC (collectively
"the Allis-Chalmers Defendants") because the Allis-Chalmers Defendants failed to pay
overtime compensation to Plaintiffs and other current and former laborers who were

misclassified as "independent contractors" who worked more than forty (40) hours per
workweek as is required by 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 207(a) and 29 C.F.R. 0x00A7 778.101. The Allis-
Chalmers Defendants routinely required these "independent contractors" to work more
than forty (40) hours per workweek without paying them overtime or time and a half
pursuant to the FLSA even though they performed the same tasks and functions as full-
time employees who were paid in accordance with the FLSA. Further, Plaintiffs and the
Potential Plaintiffs did not and currently do not perform work that meets the definition
of exempt work under the FLSA. The Allis-Chalmers Defendants benefited from
willfully depriving these "independent contractors" of their hard earned wages.

1.2. Additional individuals who are or were employed by the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants suffer, and continue to suffer, injury as a result of the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants' violations of the FLSA. These unnamed individuals are similarly situated
to the named Plaintiffs because (1) they have or had similar job duties and titles, (2) they
have or had the same hourly pay structure, (3) they all work or worked for the Allis-
Chalmers Defendants, (4) they were all required to sign "independent contractor"
agreements by the Allis-Chalmers Defendants, and (5) they were all required or
permitted to work overtime without receiving time and a half pursuant to the FLSA.
Accordingly, the named Plaintiffs seek to proceed in this FLSA action collectively with
other similarly situated "independent contractors" of the Allis-Chalmers Defendants.

1.3 The FLSA specifically confers the right of a party plaintiff to maintain an
action on behalf of him/herself and those similarly situated to him/her. 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7
216(b). 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b) provides, in pertinent part:

An action to recover liability ... may be maintained against any
employers ... by any one or more employees for and on behalf of ...

themselves and other employees similarly situated. No employee
shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless she gives her

consent in writing to become such party and such consent is filed in
the court in which such action is brought.

14 Collective actions serve the dual interests of serving justice and efficient
case management, and benefit the plaintiffs, defendants and the courts by avoiding a
multiplicity of duplicative suits, expediting the disposition of the action and reducing
the attorneys' fees, costs and expenses associated with each affected individual having
to pursue his or her own action. Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U.S. 165, 110 S.Ct.
482, 107 L.Ed. 480 (1989). "These benefits, however, depend on employees receiving
accurate and timely notice concerning the pendency of the collective action so that they
can make informed decisions about whether to participate." Id. at 165 (emphasis
added). |

1.5 To that end, it is well settled that in a collective action brought pursuant to
0x00A7 216(b) of the FLSA, district courts have the discretionary power to authorize the
sending of notice to potential class members. Id. Indeed, the "broad remedial purposes
of the FLSA are best served" if the district court facilitates such notice. Brooks v. Bell
South Telecommunications, Inc., 164 F.R.D. 561, 566 (N.D. Ala. 1955). In the absence of
court-authorized notification to all similarly situated employees, those employees may
(i) not receive timely, complete and accurate information as to the pendency of this
action, (ii) lack meaningful access to the court, and (iii) have no practical or efficient
method of vindicating their rights. Riojas v. Seal Products, Inc., 82 F.R.D. 613 (S.D. Tex.
1979) (court holding that notions of fundamental fairness dictate that notice should be
sent).

1.6 This Motion for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs is brought pursuant to the
collective action provisions of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b). This is not a motion for

class certification pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather,

Motion for Certification of Collective Action and Page 3
Request for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs Pursuant to Section 216(b)
Case 2:11-cv-00353 Document 10 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/17/12 Page 4 of 19

under the FLSA and the case law interpreting it, individuals may bring "collective
actions" on behalf of themselves and on behalf of those "similarly situated." However,
in sharp contrast to Rule 23 class action cases, collective actions under this statute are
opt-in rather than opt-out. There are potentially many other former laborers who were
misclassified as "independent contractors" who may not be aware of this suit or their
rights to proceed in this forum. Plaintiffs are therefore requesting that this Court issue a
Notice to "all current and former laborers who were misclassified as `independent
contractors' by Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc., Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services LLC, Allis-
Chalmers Tubular Services, Inc. and/or Archer Tubular Services LLC" who did not
receive full compensation pursuant to the FLSA ("Potential Plaintiffs"). The Notice
requested by Plaintiffs, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and
incorporated as if set out fully herein, would provide the Potential Plaintiffs with
information about this lawsuit and allow them to make an informed decision as to
whether or not to join this case.

1.7 Plaintiffs and Potential Plaintiffs were subject to a common policy,
practice and procedure transgressing the requirements of the FLSA. Specifically,
Plaintiffs contend that they and those current and former laborers who were required to
sign "independent contractor" agreements by Defendant Allis-Chalmers and therefore
"similarly situated" to them were not paid correctly for all hours worked over forty (40)
hours per workweek.

1.8 Plaintiffs contend that they are similarly situated to current and former
laborers who were misclassified as "independent contractors" by the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants at any time from November 1, 2008 through the present.

1.9 Plaintiffs, by this Motion, request this Court to enter an order authorizing
this case to move forward as a collective action.

1.10 Plaintiffs, by this Motion, request this Court to order the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants to produce a computer-readable file containing the names and current
contact information including: addresses, e-mail addresses (if available) and telephone
numbers of such "similarly situated" current and former laborers from November 1,
2008 through the present so that Court-ordered notice may be implemented.

1.11 Plaintiffs, by this Motion, and pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 215, request this
Court to order the Allis-Chalmers Defendants to post, on its company bulletin boards
and send via regular company newsletter, the Notice to Potential Plaintiffs authorized
by the Court.

1.12 Plaintiffs, by this Motion, request this Court to order the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants and individuals under its direction and control to refrain from interfering,
by written or unwritten policy, by action or by statement, with the right of its
employees to choose to opt-in as a Plaintiff to this cause of action and to refrain from
retaliation of any kind against those employees who do choose to opt-in to this action.

1.13 In support of this Motion, Plaintiffs have submitted an appendix
providing to the Court (1) a proposed Notice to Potential Plaintiffs, (2) a proposed Opt-
In Consent Form, and (3) affidavits of Plaintiffs, establishing support for a collective
action.

Il. FACTS

2.1. The Allis-Chalmers are a global multi-faceted oilfield service provider
serving oil and gas exploration and production companies in rental services, drilling
and completion services, directional drilling, tubular services, underbalanced services
and production services. The Allis-Chalmers Defendants are headquartered in
Houston, Texas, but operate throughout the United States and internationally, primarily
in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

2.2 Plaintiff Lopez was originally employed by the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants from approximately January 2005 until August 2006 as a non-exempt "full-
time employee" in its tubular division. Plaintiff Lopez was re-hired by the Allis-
Chalmers Defendants and was again employed in the tubular division from
approximately March 2008 until August 2008. During his time as a non-exempt "full-
time employee" of the Allis-Chalmers Defendants, Plaintiff Lopez received time and a
half for all overtime hours worked pursuant to the FLSA.

2.3 Plaintiff Lopez was then re-hired by the Allis-Chalmers Defendants to
perform the same work as he previously performed but this time, as an "independent
contractor," from approximately November 2010 until April 2011. Plaintiff Lopez was
seriously injured in the course and scope of his employment, subsequently had his left
arm amputated below the elbow, and is now unable to work. Notably, the Allis-
Chalmers Defendants argued successfully in workers' compensation pleadings in Texas
that Plaintiff Lopez was an employee - not an "independent contractor" - and during
the time Plaintiff Lopez was misclassified as an "independent contractor," he worked
alongside full-time employees of the Allis-Chalmers Defendants performing the same
tasks and functions, but Plaintiff Lopez did not receive time and a half pursuant to the
FLSA.' As such, principles of judicial estoppel preclude the Allis-Chalmers Defendants
from now contending that Plaintiff Lopez was an "independent contractor." See New
Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 1815, 149 L.Ed.2d 968, 977-78
(2001). Moreover, Plaintiff Lopez was paid hourly, or "straight pay," at a rate

determined by the Allis-Chalmers Defendants for all hours worked. See Affidavit of

 

' Jose Lopez v. Allis-Chalmers Energy | AIG; DWC NO. 11213653-01-CC, Texas Workers' Compensation
Commission Hearings Division, Corpus Christi Field Office, Corpus Christi, Texas, August 23, 2011.

Jose Angel "Joe" Lopez, attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and incorporated as if set forth
fully herein.

2.4 Plaintiff Lyons was employed by the Allis-Chalmers Defendants from
approximately January 2011 until May 2011. During that time, Plaintiff Lyons worked
for the Allis-Chalmers Defendants in its tubular division alongside "full-time
employees" and performed the same tasks and functions, but did not receive time and a
half for all overtime hours worked pursuant to the FLSA. Moreover, Plaintiff Lyons
was paid hourly, or "straight pay," at a rate determined by the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants for all hours worked. See Affidavit of Michael James Lyons, attached hereto
as Exhibit "C" and incorporated as if set out fully herein.

2.5 The Allis-Chalmers Defendants required the Plaintiffs to sign an
"independent contractor agreement" prior to employment, and represented that each
Plaintiff would be promoted to "full-time employee" status upon the completion of a
90-day probationary period, and thereafter become eligible for overtime compensation
and other benefits. Plaintiffs both successfully completed the alleged 90-day
"probationary period" but were never promoted to "full-time employee" status.
Instead, the Allis-Chalmers Defendants required or permitted the Plaintiffs to work
alongside "full-time employees" and perform the same tasks and functions, but were
not paid time and a half for all hours they worked over forty (40) hours per workweek.
The Allis-Chalmers Defendants either determined or were responsible for almost every
factor in the profit or loss equation of its oilfield services business as the Plaintiffs and
Potential Class Members had no substantial investment in the business dealings of the
Allis-Chalmers Defendants and were simply paid for services rendered. Plaintiffs and
Potential Class Members worked exclusively on jobs secured by the Allis-Chalmers
Defendants. The Allis-Chalmers Defendants supplied all of the tools and major

Case 2:11-cv-00353 Document 10 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/17/12 Page 8 of 19

equipment needed for jobs and did not charge Plaintiffs and the Potential Class
Members for the use of those items. In addition, the Allis-Chalmers Defendants
supplied the materials used for the jobs on which Plaintiffs and the Potential Class
Members worked. The Allis-Chalmers Defendants determined the fees and costs paid
by its customers and in turn its customers paid the Allis-Chalmers Defendants for the
work done. Moreover, Plaintiffs and the Potential Class Members performed their
services under the name of the Allis-Chalmers Defendants and the services performed
were directly integrated into the Allis-Chalmers Defendants' oilfield services business.

2.6 The Plaintiffs and Potential Plaintiffs did not qualify for any recognized
FLSA exemption. Specifically, the Plaintiffs and Potential Plaintiffs did not regularly
perform managerial functions. Instead, the Plaintiffs and Potential Plaintiffs spent the
entirety of their working hours performing non-managerial and non-exempt functions
on behalf of Defendant Allis-Chalmers. The Plaintiffs and Potential Plaintiffs did not
customarily or regularly exercise discretionary power, nor did they possess the
authority to hire or fire other employees or make weighted recommendations
concerning hiring, firing, or advancement. Further, the Plaintiffs and Potential Plaintiffs
did not regularly direct or manage the work of two or more full-time employees.

2.7. The Allis-Chalmers Defendants regularly required the Plaintiffs and
Potential Plaintiffs to work longer than forty (40) hours per workweek, and failed and
refused to compensate them for such work in excess of forty (40) hours at rates not less
than one and one-half times the regular rates at which they were employed, contrary to
the provisions of Section 207(a) of the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 207(a). Accordingly, the
Plaintiffs contend that the Allis-Chalmers Defendants owe them, and the Potential
Plaintiffs, overtime compensation under 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 207(a)(1).

2.8 Plaintiffs do not presently know the names, addresses and/or telephone
numbers of all "independent contractors" with whom they worked with at the Allis-
Chalmers Defendants.

III. ISSUE PRESENTED

3.1 Should Potential Plaintiffs be notified about the existence of this action so
that they can make an informed decision about whether to join this suit and stop the
statute of limitations from running on their claims for unpaid overtime compensation?

IV. THE COURT IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE NOTICE
TO ALL POTENTIAL OPT-INS

4.1 Courts are authorized to facilitate notice to potential plaintiffs in collective
actions brought under 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 216(b). Hoffiman-LaRoche, 493 U.S. at 169; Dybach, 942
F.2d at 1567-68. Court facilitation of notice to potential opt-ins serves the "broad
remedial purpose of the Act [FLSA]." Dybach, 942 F.2d at 1567.

4.2 For an opt-in class to be created under Section 216(b), an employee need
only show that he is suing his employer for himself and on behalf of other employees
"similarly situated." Grayson v. K Mart Corp., 79 F.3d 1086, 1096 (11 Cir.), cert. denied,
__ US. ---__, 117 S.Ct. 435 (1996). Plaintiffs' claims and positions need not be
identical to those of putative class members, but need only be similar. Id.; Tucker, 872 F.
Supp. at 947. Plaintiffs need only demonstrate a reasonable basis for the allegation that
a class of similarly situated persons may exist. Grayson v. K Mart, 79 F.3d at 1097.

4.3 The standard plaintiffs must meet is thus considerably less stringent than
the proof required for joinder pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a) or for class certification
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Grayson v. K Mart, 79 F.3d at 1096. See also, Mooney v. Aramco
Services Co., 54 F.3d 1207, 1214 (50x2122 Cir. 1995) (applying a "fairly lenient standard" for

0x00A7216(b) determinations). It is also abundantly clear that the notice motion is not a ruling

Request for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs Pursuant to Section 216(b)
Case 2:11-cv-00353 Document 10 Filed in TXSD 0n 01/17/12 Page 10 of 19

on the merits of the Plaintiffs' claims. Grayson v. K Mart, 79 F.3d at 1099 n.17; Garner,
802 F. Supp. at 423 n.3. See also, Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974)
(plaintiffs need not demonstrate they will prevail on the merits even to obtain class
certification under the more demanding requirements of Rule 23 and the requirements
of Section 216(b) are far less stringent).

4.4  Insum, all Plaintiffs need demonstrate at this stage of a collective action is
that "there are other employees of the ... employer who [may] desire to "opt-in" and
that these other employees are "similarly situated" with respect to their job
requirements and with regard to their pay provisions." Dybach, 942 F.2d at 1567-68;
Tucker, 927 F. Supp. at 947. Plaintiffs may establish this through substantial and
detailed allegations in their complaint with some modicum of evidentiary support in
the form of affidavits. Grayson v. K Mart, 79 F.3d at 1097. As demonstrated below,
Plaintiffs in this case more than meet this standard for creating an opt-in class and for
issuance of notice under 0x00A7216(b).

A, Issuance of Notice is Appropriate in This Case Because Plaintiffs Meet
the Similarly Situated Standard.

 

4.5 In this case, the current and former misclassified "independent
contractors" of the Allis-Chalmers Defendants who were required to routinely work
more than forty (40) hours in a workweek without being paid overtime for all such
hours, form a cohesive group of similarly situated employees. The Allis-Chalmers
Defendants had a practice of requiring "independent contractors" to work more than
forty (40) hours per workweek without paying them time and a half even though they
performed the same tasks and functions as full-time employees who were paid time
and a half pursuant to the FLSA. Because each member of the proposed opt-in "class"

was required to work more than forty (40) hours per workweek and was paid on an
