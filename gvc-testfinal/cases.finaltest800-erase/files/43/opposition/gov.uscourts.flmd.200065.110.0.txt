As the authorities cited hereinbelow demonstrate, Triads Motion to Dismiss is without 2 metit and - .
must be denied. | fe | |
- `Background
Triad was the insurer of mortgage loans used to back certificates sold by Credit Suisse
Fist Boston ("CSFB"). Unfortunately for the buyers of those certificates, the Credit Suisse

Defendants represented that the mortgage pools were comprised of performing mortgage loans

that were backed by real property. sufficient.to provide collateral for the loans, To the contrary,

the mortgage loans were often under collateralized, or in default, when the certificates were sold

to the investing public, including Bankers. When CSFB and its co-defendants submitted claims
 

cee `for: somie eof the loans, `Triad | declined coverage 0 `on. nthe basis that, amongst other things, the loans - Doe cee Oy

"Point n

 

. BANKER'S Is A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY UNDER"
TBE TRIAD INSURANCE POLICY. :

"Triad Pd atompts to argue o that F Bankers j is not a third tpaty beneficiary under the insurance Se oo

3 contract `because Bankers cannot show that there \ was a direct intent to confer a direct and . i,

substantial benefit upon it. "Triad, claims that this is `80  esause the subject i insurance policy as ~

defines : an | insured as a person designate i in the policy 0 or. a `person t to whom coverage 1 was .

assigned with its written 2. approval Contrary to `Triad's assertion, "it is not necessary that third- oe

party beneficiaries be identified or identifiable at the time of the making of the contract. " 98]
Third Avenue Corp. v. Beltramini, 485 N.Y.8.2d 535 (N LY. 1985); Pilot Air Freight Corp. v. City
of Buffalo, No. CIV-91-308E, 1991 WL 275051 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 1991). "Tt is also true that
the person who claims to be a third-party beneficiary must be one of a class of persons intended.
ote be benefited." Id

Here, although Bankers was not identified in the insurance policy, it was a third party

beneficiary to the policy because the policy was procured to ultimately' protect its investment as

Point ot

oe `BANKERS cent CAN PROPERLY SUE TRIAD FOR BREACH OF. F CONTRACT FOR
SS _ DENYING COVERAGE UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICY |

 

"The second point Triad 2 raises `for dismissal i is `its allegation that the i `insurance cent policy ee -

| . `permitted it it to decline coverage. because Bankers alleged that the Joans in, the mortgage pool : an

were * `amongst cent other. Teasons | s . _ procured by fraud " o See Second Am. Compl, "i: 29 - 30. a . a

Triad's . "defense" `that "fraud" by. the borrowers of the cent mortgage loans permits a. . denial of if . oo

- coverage is is an . affirmative defense, `ut not a basis for dismissal against Banker's 5 `claim of a

oo wrongful denial of coverage. Tn fact, paragraphs 29 9 and 30 of the Amended Complaint provide ee

- that Triad denied i insurance coverage to the centficate holders fx the defaulted loans. Bankers, ; |
however, has not alleged that Triad yen was s entitled to deny cent coverage cent for the loans whether on the
basis of fraud | or for any other reason. In fact, paragraph 29 of the Amended Complaint merely

makes reference to the fact that Triad itself alleged fraud as one of the basis (not the only basis)

for the denial of coverage. Bankers, however, has alleged in Count VII Second Amended -

Complaint that Triad was not entitled to deny coverage, and therefore breached the insurance

The mere fact that Triad may claim that the mortgage loans were (c) procured by fi fraud and

its denial of liability on that basis is not the end of the analysis, even when the i insurance policy |
