______________________________________/
DEFENDANT TRIAD GUARANTY INSURANCE CORPORATION’S MOTION TO
DISMISS UNDER FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 12(b)(6) AND
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendant, Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation (“Triad”), by its attorneys, Thomas J.
Cunningham and Simon A. Fleischmann, submits this Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and incorporated memorandum of law and respectfully requests entry of
an Order dismissing Plaintiff’s single count against Triad, with prejudice.
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff filed its Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on May 6, 2008, following the
Court’s Order On Motions to Dismiss dated April 22, 2008 (“Dismissal Order”) granting in part and
denying in part the Defendants’ separate motions to dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (A copy of the Dismissal Order is attached to this
Motion as Exhibit 1.) The Dismissal Order granted Triad’s Motion to Dismiss, with leave granted
to allow Plaintiff to amend its pleading and attempt to include allegations to establish that it is a

direct third-party beneficiary under the mortgage guaranty insurance policy attached to the SAC as
Exhibit E (the “Policy”).
Triad should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6), this time with prejudice, because the SAC
fails to sufficiently allege that Plaintiff is a direct third-party beneficiary under the Policy. Triad owes
Plaintiff no contractual duty under the Policy. Plaintiff does not enjoy any privity of contract with
Triad. Plaintiff therefore is not entitled to sue for breach of contract. In addition, even if Plaintiff
could sue under the Policy, the SAC fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of
contract. For these reason, as set forth in detail below, Plaintiff’s claim against Triad should be
dismissed in its entirety, with prejudice, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).
MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD
Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint. Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-66 (2007); Fowler v. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co., 343
F.2d 150, 153 (5th Cir. 1965). To avoid dismissal, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support
the allegations in the complaint and state a plausible claim. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct.
1955, 1965 (2007). Even under the liberal pleading standard in federal courts, conclusory statements
standing alone will not withstand a motion to dismiss. Perry v. Thompson, 786 F.2d 1093, 1094 (11th
Cir. 1986). Rather, the complaint must provide facts from which the conclusions averred in the
complaint can be reasonably derived. Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., 450 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir. 2006).
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TRIAD
The Court by now is familiar with Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding its purchase of certain
securities in the asset-backed securities issue of certain mortgage-backed pass-through certificates
entitled “CSFB Mortgage-Banked Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2001-28” (the “Securities”),
which are secured by a pool of consumer mortgage loans held and serviced in a trust. (SAC, ¶¶ 14,
18, 28.)

Plaintiff alleges that Triad issued the Policy to cover the mortgage loans used as collateral for
the Securities. (SAC, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff acknowledges that Bank One, N.A., the predecessor trustee of
the trust, is the sole insured party under the Policy. (SAC, ¶ 92.) The Policy does not identify
Plaintiff as an insured party, nor does the Policy identify owners of the Securities as a class of
insured parties or beneficiaries under the Policy. (SAC, Ex. E.) While the Policy provides for the
transfer of coverage by written assignment and approval by Triad (SAC, Ex. E at § 1.N.), Plaintiff
does not allege that it received an assignment of coverage under the Policy despite having ample
opportunities to do so in its three separate complaints thus far in the action.
Plaintiff admits that the Policy was “[a]cquired for the benefit of the trust…” (SAC, ¶ 18 b.)
According to the SAC, proceeds of the Policy were to be paid directly to the trustee of the trust, and
then distributed by the trustee to the owners of the Securities. (SAC, ¶ 92.) Despite admitting this
dictionary-definition of an indirect benefit, Plaintiff concludes that it is somehow a direct third-party
beneficiary of the Policy. (SAC, ¶ 93.) However, Plaintiff cannot overcome the fact that it is at best
an indirect beneficiary of the Policy simply by alleging, in a conclusory fashion, that it is not so. See
Bank of North Georgia v. Reznick Group, P.C., 262 Fed. Appx. 928, 930 (11th Cir. 2008) (the terms of a
written instrument attached to a complaint controls plaintiff’s contradictory allegations).
Plaintiff purports to assert a breach of contract claim against Triad (Count VIII), alleging
that Triad “declined to cover many of the mortgage loans in the pool on the basis, amongst other
things, that the loans had been procured through the use of fraud.” (SAC, ¶¶ 29c., 95.) However,
aside from having no standing to assert this claim, Plaintiff makes no allegation to help the Court
understand how Triad’s conduct breached the Policy. As set forth below, the allegations against
Triad fall short of stating any claim because Plaintiff is not a direct third-party beneficiary under the
Policy, and Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to establish that Triad has breached the Policy.
Accordingly, Triad’s Motion to Dismiss should be granted.

ARGUMENT1
I.

PLAINTIFF IS NOT A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE POLICY
AND THEREFORE DOES NOT HAVE STANDING TO BRING A BREACH OF
CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST TRIAD.
Under Florida law, an alleged third-party beneficiary has standing to enforce a contract only

where the third-party receives a direct benefit from the contract. (Dismissal Order at 11 (citing Blu-J,
Inc. v. Kemper C.P.A. Group 916 F.2d 637, 640 (11th Cir. 1990)).) In granting Triad’s motion to
dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, the Court rightly looked to the terms of the Policy to
determine whether Plaintiff was a direct beneficiary of the Policy. (Dismissal Order at 12.) The
Court found that the Policy confers the direct benefit of its coverage only upon “Insured” persons.
(Dismissal Order at 12.) “Insured” is defined in the Policy as:
N.

Insured means:
1.

The Person designated on the face of the Policy; or

2.

any Person to whom coverage has been assigned with the written
approval of the Company as provided in Section II.J. resulting in a
change in the Insured named on a Certificate in accordance with
this Policy

(SAC, Ex. E at § I.N.) The Court found that the terms of the Policy demonstrate that Plaintiff is
not and cannot be a direct third-party beneficiary of the Policy with standing to sue, unless Plaintiff
can allege that it received an assignment of coverage upon written approval of Triad. (Dismissal
Order at 12.) Specifically, the Court found,
[The terms of the Policy] make clear that Bank One was the party Triad intended to
insure. The Court then looks to evidence of another “Insured” assigned with written
approval of Triad. No such evidence has been presented, nor has Plaintiff alleged
that such evidence exists.

Triad assumes for the limited purposes of this Motion that Florida law applies in this case. Triad does not
waive, and expressly reserves, its right to later argue that the law of another jurisdiction applies.

(Dismissal Order at 12 (citing Dyal v. Union Bag-Camp. Paper Corp., 236 F.2d 387, 393 (5th Cir. 1959)).)
In granting Triad’s motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, the Court gave Plaintiff the
opportunity to amend its pleading to assert that it received an assignment of coverage under the
Policy upon written approval by Triad. (Dismissal Order at 12.) However, Plaintiff did not and
could not do that. The claim against Triad in the SAC makes no such allegation and should
therefore be dismissed with prejudice.
The Court should reject Plaintiff’s conclusory allegation that it is a third-party beneficiary
under the Policy because the express terms of the Policy trump Plaintiffs’ contradictory allegations.
Bank of North Georgia v. Reznick Group, P.C., No. 07-11919, 2008 WL 134118, at *1 (11th Cir. Jan. 15,
2008) (the terms of a written instrument attached to a complaint controls plaintiff’s contradictory
allegations). The person designated on the face of the Policy is the predecessor trustee of the trust,
not the Plaintiff. Plaintiff is not identified anywhere in the Policy by name. Purchasers of the
Securities are not identified anywhere in the Policy as a class. There is no language anywhere in the
Policy that confers a direct benefit to Plaintiff. The only party entitled to benefit (and thus the only
party with a standing to sue) is the trustee of the trust.
Plaintiff pleads itself out of Court by admitting that the Policy was “[a]cquired for the benefit
of the trust,” and that the proceeds of the Policy are to be paid directly to the trustee of the trust and
then distributed by the trustee to the owners of the Securities. (SAC, ¶¶ 18 b, 92.) Plaintiff thus
correctly points out that the beneficiaries of the trust receive only an incidental benefit from the
Policy, not directly from Triad but instead from Triad’s “Insured,” which is the only direct
beneficiary under the Policy. As owner of the Securities, Plaintiff’s status as an indirect beneficiary
of the Policy is similar to the shareholders of a corporation who receive only an indirect benefit
from contracts the corporation enters into. See Stevens v. Lowder, 643 F.2d 1078, 1080 (5th Cir. 1981)
(affirming district court’s holding that shareholders do not have standing to sue a third-party based

on a contract entered into with the shareholder’s corporation). Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot be a
direct third-party beneficiary under the Policy. Therefore, Plaintiff’s claim against Triad should be
dismissed with prejudice.
II.

PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM BECAUSE IT ALLEGES THAT
COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS LOANS WAS DENIED ON THE BASIS OF
FRAUD, HOWEVER, CASE LAW AND THE POLICY ITSELF SPECIFICALLY
PERMIT DENIAL OF COVERAGE FOR LOANS PROCURED BY FRAUD.
Plaintiff alleges, in a brief and conclusory manner, that Triad breached its obligations under

the Policy by not properly paying claims to the trustee of the trust. ( SAC, ¶ 95.) Even assuming
Plaintiff has standing to bring a breach of contract suit as a third-party beneficiary, this allegation is
completely unsupported by any facts to state a claim that rises above mere speculation. Plaintiff’s
only remotely plausible argument that Triad breached any duty is that Triad declined to cover a
portion of the mortgage loans securing the Securities “on the basis, amongst other things, that the
loans were procured through the use of fraud.” (SAC, ¶ 29 c.) What Plaintiff fails to aver, however,
is how this alleged conduct breaches the Policy.
Triad’s right to deny claims involving fraud is readily apparent in both the language of the
Policy and Florida case law. As provided in the Policy, claims made involving or arising out of fraud
by Bank One, N.A. (as Insured) or Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (as Servicer) are explicitly
excluded from insurance coverage. (SAC, Exhibit E, at Section III.D.) Additionally, courts in
Florida have recognized and upheld the validity of such provisions. See Schneer v. Allstate Indem. Co.,
767 So.2d 485 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000). Therefore, even accepting as true Plaintiff’s conclusory
allegations regarding other parties, such allegations fail to establish a claim for breach of contract
against Triad. Accordingly, Count VIII of the Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice under
Rule 12(b)(6).

CONCLUSION
The plain language of the Policy demonstrates that Plaintiff is not a direct intended thirdparty beneficiary of the Policy. The Policy language provides no rights to third-parties, directly or
even incidentally. Accordingly, the Policy attached to the Second Amended Complaint as Exhibit E
plainly establishes that Triad owes no contractual duty to Plaintiff as an intended third-party
beneficiary or otherwise. Even if Plaintiff had standing to bring a breach of contract claim against
Triad, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to put Triad on notice as to its conduct that
represents the supposed breach of contract. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim for “breach of third-party
beneficiary contract” must be dismissed with prejudice.
For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Triad’s Motion to Dismiss Pursuant
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and award such further relief as the Court finds just and
appropriate.
