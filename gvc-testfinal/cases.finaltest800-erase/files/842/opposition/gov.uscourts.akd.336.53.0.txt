The United States of America, by its undersigned counsel,

place of filing documents in this case from the Court’s Anchorage

office to its Fairbanks office.
DISCUSSION
The United States brought this action to reduce tax
assessments against defendant Donald L. Hymes to judgment and to
foreclose federal tax liens against a parcel of real property
held by nominees or alter egos of Donald L. Hymes.

Due to a

clerical error, this action was filed with the Court’s Anchorage
office rather than its Fairbanks office.
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(b), any civil action may be
transferred to another division upon motion or consent of all
parties.

Further, Local Rule 3.3(d) provides for transfer of an

action to another division within this District upon motion of a
party.1
In this case, the facts alleged in the United States’
complaint took place in the Fairbanks area, and the tax
liabilities at issue were incurred in that area.

Further, as

defendants note in their motion, a majority of the defendants are
located in the Fairbanks area.

Because defendants lack access to

the Court’s electronic case filing system, requiring them to file
pleadings with the Court in Anchorage rather than Fairbanks
causes unnecessary delays and expense.

Additionally, the judge

However, the United States notes that Local Rule
3.3(c)(2) permits parties to file documents in either Anchorage
or “the location of the court in which venue lies.” Local Rule
3.3(c)(2). In this case, venue lies in Fairbanks, and filing of
documents in Fairbanks is appropriate.

assigned to this matter maintains chambers in Fairbanks.

Only a

clerical error caused the action to be filed in Anchorage.

Thus,

both the interest of justice and the convenience of the parties
require that the Court’s Fairbanks Division be designated the
place for filing documents in this matter.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant
defendants’ motion and designate Fairbanks as the place for
filing documents in this case.
DATED this 22d day of March, 2006.
Respectfully submitted,
DEBORAH M. SMITH
