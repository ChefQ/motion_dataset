CASE NO. 3:10-CV-023

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PIONEER’S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I. NATURE OF PROCEEDING
This is an action in which the Plaintiff, Merry Warner (“Warner”), alleges that her
termination by the Defendant, Pioneer Auto Sales and Leasing, Inc., (“Pioneer”), was a retaliatory
discharge in violation of Title VII, specifically 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-3(a) and that Pioneer is
liable for hostile work environment. Pioneer has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment in this case
and Plaintiff files her Response in Opposition.

Sonny Balser about Chris Sarna’s behavior toward her. (Warner Dep. at 131, L.18-25). At least
every other day and every weekend Chris Sarna would ask Merry Warner out on a date, which Merry
Warner refused. (Warner Dep. at 132, L.1-15). On January 7, 2008 Merry Warner wrote on her
calendar and told Chris “no way” as to his asking her out. (Warner Dep. at 132, L.16-17, Warner
Dep. Exhibit 9). On January 15, 2008 Merry Warner noted on her calendar that Chris Sarna told

too busy to talk with her, which she noted on her calendar. (Warner Dep. at 163, L.13-23, Warner

III. ARGUMENT
A.

Summary Judgment

Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
5

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 6 of 13
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ.
P. 56(c). This Rule permits the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery,
against a party “who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element
essential to that party’s case, and in which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552-53 (1986).
In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court accepts as true the non-moving party’s
evidence, draws all legitimate inferences in favor of the non-moving party, and does not weigh the
evidence nor the credibility of witnesses. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 249-51, 106 S.
Ct. at 2511(1986).
Substantive law determines which facts are material that might affect the outcome of the suit
under the governing law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S. Ct. at 2510. Irrelevant or unnecessary
facts do not preclude summary judgment even when they are in dispute. Id. The issue of fact must
be genuine. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
A party moving for summary judgment initially has the burden of showing the absence of any
genuine issue of material fact from the evidence of record. Schroeder v. Barth, Inc., 969 F.2d 421, 423
(7th Cir. 1992). If the Defendant meets its burden, Plaintiff then must go beyond the pleadings and
present adequate, specific facts which show that a genuine issue exists. Celotex, 477 U.S. 317, 324
(1986). Plaintiff must do more than create a mere “colorable” factual dispute to defeat summary
judgment. The disputed facts must be material, i.e., outcome determinative. Anderson, 477 U.S.
242, 248-249 (1986).
However, the court in considering a summary judgment motion, must draw all reasonable
inferences “in the light most favorable” to the Plaintiff, and must resolve any doubt against the
moving party. Lloyd v. Bridgeport Brass Corp., 811 F. Supp. 401 (S.D. Ind. 1993). If a reasonable fact
6

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 7 of 13
finder could find for Plaintiff, summary judgment is inappropriate. Lloyd, 811 F.Supp. at 404; Shields
Enters, Inc. v. First Chicago Corp., 975 F.2d 1290, 1294 (7th Cir. 1992). The court may not make
credibility determinations or decide which inferences to draw from the facts, as these are jobs for the
fact finder. Payne v. Pauley, 337 F.3d 767, 770 (7th Cir. 2003). The non-movant does not have to
match the movant witness for witness, nor persuade the court that his case is convincing, but only
has to come forward with appropriate evidence demonstrating that there is a pending dispute of
material fact. Waldridge v. American Hoechst Corp., 24 F.3d 918, 921 (7th Cir. 1994).
B.

Title VII - as to retaliatory discharge

In Count II of Plaintiff’s Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that her termination from employment
was due to her complaints of sexual harassment.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly prohibits retaliation by an employer:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate
against any of his employees or applicants for employment...because he has
opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,
or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner
in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.
(Emphasis added.). 42 U.S.C. 2000e-3(a).
Generally, in order to demonstrate that Pioneer retaliated against her, Warner must meet
three criteria: (1) she engaged in protected expression; (2) she suffered an adverse employment
action; and, (3) there is a causal connection between the protected expression and the adverse
employment action. Bell v. EPA, 232 F.3d 546, 554 (7th Cir.2000); Pasqua v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 101
F.3d 514, 518 (7th Cir.1996).
As U.S.C. 2000e-3(a) indicates, there are two different theories under which an employee
may bring a claim for retaliation. The first claim centers around an employee who has “participated
in any investigation, charge or complaint,” whereas the second method is because an employee
“opposed” the unlawful discrimination. To bring a claim for retaliation, an employee must have
done something or said something that is protected under the law. Section 703(a), the anti7

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 8 of 13
retaliation provision of Title VII, is designed to work with the anti-discrimination provisions that
make it unlawful to treat an employee differently, or harass an employee because of race, color,
religion, sex or national origin. As our Supreme Court stated in Burlington Northern and Fe Railway
Company v. Sheila White, 126 S. Ct.2405 (2006), “[the substantive provision seeks to prevent injury
to individuals based on who they are, i.e., their status. The anti-retaliation provision seeks to
prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, i.e., their conduct.”
The conduct of Merry Warner which led to the termination of her employment was her
complaints regarding Chris Sarna continuous requests asking her out on a date as well as
pornographic e-mails which Merry Warner received. As set out in Plaintiff’s Statement of Material
Facts, Merry Warner documented on her 2008 calendar some of her complaints about Chris Sarna
to Brent Schafer who was a Manager at Pioneer. The following facts set out in Plaintiff’s Statement
of general issues support this. On January 7, 2008 Merry Warner wrote on her calendar and told
Chris “no way” as to his asking her out. (Warner Dep. at 132, L.16-17, Warner Dep. Exhibit 9). On
January 22, 2008 Merry Warner noted on her calendar that she complained to Brent Schafer about
Chris Sarna constantly asking her out on a date. (Warner Dep. at 133, L.18-24, Warner Dep. Exhibit
9). On May 28, 2008 Merry Warner complained again to Brent Schafer about Chris Sarna asking
her out. (Warner Dep. at 150, L.8-15, Warner Dep. Exhibit 9). On August 20, 2008 Merry Warner
complained to Brent Schafer about the e-mail she saw. (Warner Dep. at 160, L.2-9). On September
25, 2008 Merry Warner attempted to call Brent Schafer again but he was too busy too talk with her,
which she noted on her calendar. (Warner Dep. at 163, L.13-23, Warner Dep. Exhibit 9) Merry
Warner has documented her protected activity as to her complaints about sexual harassment.
In addition, In order to succeed on a retaliation claim Warner does not need to prove that
the sexual harassment was serious enough to constitute a Title VII violation, but that Warner
subjectively felt she had been sexually harassed. Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center, 544 F 3d 766,

8

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 9 of 13
771 (7th Cir. 2008). The type of sexual harassment which would sufficient to create a claim for
retaliation includes uninvited sexual solicitations and pornographic pictures. Id. at 722. Chris Sarna
continuously asked Merry Warner out on a date while she was employed at Pioneer. (Warner Dep.
at 132, L.7-15, at 130, L.1-9). Exhibit 9 of Warner Deposition is a calendar prepared by Merry
Warner. (Warner Dep. at 128, L.22-25). On January 3, 2008 Merry Warner told Sonny Balser about
Chris Sarna’s behavior toward her. (Warner Dep. at 131, L.18-25). At least every other day and
every weekend Chris Sarna would ask Merry Warner out on a date, which Merry Warner refused.
(Warner Dep. at 132, L.1-15). On January 7, 2008 Merry Warner wrote on her calendar and told
Chris “no way” as to his asking her out. (Warner Dep. at 132, L.16-17, Warner Dep. Exhibit 9). On
January 15, 2008 Merry Warner noted on her calendar that Chris Sarna told her he wished he was
her boyfriend. (Warner Dep. at 133, L.12-15, Warner Dep. Exhibit 9). Chris Sarna contacted Merry
Warner every Friday to ask her out. (Warner Dep. at 134, L.18-19). Chris Sarna kept asking Merry
Warner how her love life and sex life was. (Warner Dep. at 136, L. 16-17). On February 14, 2008
Chris Sarna told Merry Warner: “ gee Mary I wish I could get into your pants. How’s your love life.
I hate my wife. I’m not happy. Come on, say you’re going to come and see me this weekend and
watch me play.” (Warner Dep. at 136, L .7-10). In addition, Merry Warner testified that she
received pornographic e-mails. Chris Sarna showed Warner an offensive cartoon about Barbie.
(Warner Dep. at 18, L.2-10, Warner Dep. Exhibit 1-4). Merry Warner complained to Sonny Balser
about Chris Sarna showing her the offensive e-mail. (Warner Dep. at 20, L.16-18). Merry Warner
complained to Brent Schafer about the offensive e-mail. (Warner Dep. at 21, L.12-17). Merry
Warner found additional offensive e-mails while employed at Pioneer. (Warner Dep. at 25, L.9-12,
Warner Dep. Exhibit 2). Chris Sarna gave Merry Warner additional offensive e-mails. (Warner Dep.
at 33, L.14, Warner Dep. Exhibit 1-4).
It is undisputed that Merry Warner’s employment was terminated on October 17, 2008 this

9

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 10 of 13
constitutes an adverse employment action for a retaliation claim. Id.
Having established material facts with regard to Warner’s complaints about Chris Sarna’s
sexual harassment and the adverse employment action taken by Pioneer, it is necessary for Warner
to establish a casual connection between her statutory protected activity of her complaints about
Chris Sarna’s sexual harassment ant the termination of employment. Merry Warner made a notation
on her calendar that the complaint to Brent Schafer, her supervisor at late as August 20, 2008 and
September 25, 2008. Merry Warner’s employment was terminated on October 17, 2008. Generally
a month between complaints of sexual harassment and termination to create a casual connection
for purposes of a retaliation claim. Id.
Having established a prima false claim for retaliation, Pioneer has the burden of showing that
it would have made the same decision to terminate Warner’s employment regardless of her
complaints as to sexual harassment. Id. at 773-774. Pioneer does not address this issue in its Brief
and has not specifically designated material evidence on this issue other than to provide a business
reason that her termination was for poor performance.
Warner has designated the following evidence which create genuine fact as to whether
Pioneer’s reason for termination of Warner’s untrue: There was no written warnings as to Merry
Warner. (Schafer Dep. at 19, L.10-11). Pioneer has no written documentation as to Merry Warner’s
performance. (Schafer Dep. at 25, L.1-2). Merry Warner received a $1,000 bonus while employed
at Pioneer. (Schafer Dep. at 29, L.5-13, at 30, L.19-25). Brent Schafer never disciplined Merry
Warner. (Schafer Dep. at 36, L.24-25, at 37, L1-3). Merry Warner was never disciplined in any way
while employed at Pioneer. (Warner Dep. at 175, L.9-12). Merry Warner was never advised that she
was not meeting the expectations of her employment at Pioneer. (Warner Dep. at 175, L.13-16).
There are genuine issues of fact as to each element necessary to create a claim for retaliatory
discharge and Pioneer’s Motion For Summary Judgment must be denied as to this issue.

C.

Title VII - hostile work environment

Count I of Plaintiff’s Complaint sets out Plaintiff’s claim under Title VII for hostile work
environment. To establish a claim for hostile work environment Warner must demonstrate that a)
she was subjected to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, b) the conduct was severe or persuasive
enough to create a hostile work environment and c) there is a basis for employment liability.
In order to demonstrate that Warner was subject to unwelcome conduct it is sufficient to
demonstrate the claimant refused the advances on harassment. Benitez v American Standard Circuits,
Inc., 678 F. Supp. 745, 756 (F.D. Ill. 2010). Merry Warner testified that Chris Sarna asked her out
on a date on a continuos basis during her employment and each time she refused.
In order to establish the second element necessary for a hostile work environment claim it
is necessary for Warner to demonstrate that the conduct was based on sex which was by motivated
by sexual desire. Id. at 757. Merry Warner testified during her deposition that Chris Sarna
continuously asking her out on a date was sexually motivated. For example on February 14, 2008
Chris Sarna told Merry Warner: “ gee Mary I wish I could get into your pants. How’s your love life.
I.. Hate my wife. I’m not happy. Come on, say you’re going to come and see me this weekend and
watch me play.” (Warner Dep at 136, L . 7-10).
The third element necessary to establish claim for hostile work environment is to
demonstrate that the harassment was severe on persuasive as to alter the condition of her
employment. The harassing conduct does not need to be both severe and persuasive. Jackson v
County of Racine, 476 F 3d 493, 499. (7th Cir. 2007). Persuasive conduct such as taking an
inappropriate interest in the employee’s relationship with her marriage along with inappropriate
sexual comments is sufficient to create hostile work environment. Robinson v Sappington, 35, F 3d,
317, 330. (7th Cir. 2004).
In this case Chris Sarna continuously asked her out on a date and made other sexual

11

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 12 of 13
comments. This is sufficient to create a hostile work environment. As set out in the prior section,
Chris Sarna took continuous interest as to her relationships with other men and wanted to establish
a sexual relationship with her. In addition, Merry Warner received e-mails with pornographic
images.
The fourth requirement for establishing a hostile work environment claim is employer
liability. The employer’s liability is strict if the harassing individual is the employee’s supervisor and
there was tangible employment action such as discharge. Jackson v County of Racine, Supra at 501.
Since it is undisputed that Chris Sarna was Warner’s supervisor and her employment was terminated,
Pioneer’s strictly liable for the hostile work environment created by Chris Sarna. This is further
reinforced by the fact that Pioneer had no system for employees at Pioneer to complain about sexual
harassment during the time that Merry Warner was employed and did not ever have an employee
handbook. At the very least there are issues of fact as the negligence of Pioneer as to its lack of a
system for employees to report sexual harassment. Id.
Pioneer in its Brief takes many pages to analyze the instant messages which had been saved
on Pioneer’s computer. It is clear from the deposition testimony of Chris Sarna and Brent Schafer
as well as of Merry Warner that there was only one computer in the Osceola office and anyone could
be at the computer and type instant messages. Both Chris Sarna and Brent Schafer conceded that
during their deposition it was impossible to tell definitely who sent a message. Sonny Balser would
pretend to be Merry Warner in sending instant messages. (Warner Dep. at 170, L.1-16). For this
reason Merry Warner in the statement of material facts has designated the deposition testimony of
Chris Sarna, Brent Schafer, and Merry Warner and their exhibits which create genuine issues of fact
and do not believe the instant messages introduced by Pioneer are credible.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons set out in this Brief, Plaintiff moves this court to deny

12

USDC IN/ND case 3:10-cv-00023-CAN document 20 filed 01/31/11 page 13 of 13
Defendant’s Motion for Summary since these are issues of material fact with regard to Warner’s
claims for retaliation and for a hostile work environment.
