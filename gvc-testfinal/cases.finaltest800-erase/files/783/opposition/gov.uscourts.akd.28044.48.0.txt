Case 3:10-cr-00061-RRB Document 48 Filed 05/24/17 Page 1 of 6

As to the request to transfer to the community confinement to the District of
Maine, as the defendant alleges that decision has already been made by the United
States Probation Office, and, if true, the United States is not opposed.
As to defendant Rockwood’s requested modification of the terms of
supervised release in that he be released to the United Kingdom as he is the
functional equivalent of a foreign nations, said motion should be denied.
A.

Removal of the Residential Reentry Center Condition

Previously, the Defendant successfully filed a motion for a Modification of
the Terms of Supervised Release. Docked No. 26. The Order following that
motion, Docket No. 27, filed on June 16, 2015, granted a modification as follows:
“[t]he Defendant will enter a residential reentry center outside of Boston,
Massachusetts, for a term of up to six months or until such time that he secures a
personal residence approved by probation. While a resident of the residential
reentry center, the Defendant will abide by all program rules and regulations.” (See
Docket No. 27).
The Defendant states that he is no longer being released to the District of
Massachusetts, but instead the District of Maine. No evidence is presented that
show this is true. Contrary, on August 4, 2015, the Defendant was found ineligible
by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for participation in a RRC based on
“verified security concerns”. (See Letter from Federal Bureau of Prisons, Docket
U.S. v. Rockwood

3:10-cr-00061-RRB
Case 3:10-cr-00061-RRB Document 48 Filed 05/24/17 Page 2 of 6

No. 43, Attachment 1). On October 19, 2016, the decision was reviewed by the
BOP and was reaffirmed. (See Docket No. 43, Attachment 1). No documentation is
present to show that the BOP has changed their determination regarding the
Defendant’s security concerns and that he is now suitable for a RRC program.
Without any showing of a change in circumstances, we see no reason to modify the
Defendant’s terms of supervised release.
As well, the Defendant states that he has secured a personal residence
approved by probation in the District of Maine. The assertion by the Defendant is
that if the Defendant has obtained an approved personal residence then that
provision in the terms of supervised release is no longer pertinent and should
therefore be removed. No evidence is provided to support this claim as well.
If such a situation exists, a modification to the terms of supervised release
would not be the proper result. If true that the Defendant has secured a personal
residence approved by the correct probation location, then there is no need to
modify the terms of supervised release beyond changing the location of his RRC if
it is now the incorrect district. The current terms of supervised release allow the
Defendant to be released from the residential reentry center upon securing a
personal residence approved by probation. See Docket No. 27. If the Defendant has
secured such a residence and it is approved, then the order already allows him to
go to the approved personal residence instead of a RRC and the United States

would not be opposed but no modification to the terms of supervised release is
needed. If that is indeed the case, the defendant should provide the court with
evidence that he has secured a residence and Probation agrees to the transfer to
Maine.
B.

Serving the Period of Supervised Release in England

The more important aspect of the defendant’s motion concerns his request
that the Court add a condition to the terms of his supervised release that he be
allowed to serve the period of supervised release in England. In his motion the
Defendant asserts arguments based on ease of reintegration, financial
considerations, and permission in statute to allow such terms in a supervised
release. None of the factors the Defendant asserts are the factors that statute
requires the Court consider when considering a condition of supervised release.
18 U.S.C. § 3585(c). As well, none of what the Defendant asserts is persuasive
when considering the statutory factors. Finally, the Defendant’s reliance on statute
while arguing its permissiveness in allowing him to serve the remainder of his
supervised release in England is misplaced and incorrect.
The factors to be considered in including a term for supervised release are
listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3585(c), which includes 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B),
(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) by reference. Those statutes
require the Court to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the
U.S. v. Rockwood
Page 4 of 6
3:10-cr-00061-RRB
Case 3:10-cr-00061-RRB Document 48 Filed 05/24/17 Page 4 of 6

history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentence and the
sentencing range stablished for the offense, any pertinent policy statement, the
need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar
records, and the need to provide restitution to any victims.
None of the factors that the Defendant asserts, that of financial concerns or
the Defendant’s ability to return to his family, are factors § 3585(c) list to have the
Court consider. At best, they are secondary concerns that can be considered when
weighing some of the factors. The current terms of supervised release are well
within the statutory factors the Court is to consider and have not been contested.
As the Defendant has not presented any evidence that would cause the Court to
need to reconsider the factors laid out by statute, there is no cause or basis for
further review or alteration.
Lastly, the Defendant asserts that 18 U.S.C. § 3585(d) would permit the
Court to order him to serve his supervised release under the control of another
country. The part of the statute that the Defendant likely speaks of reads “[i]f an
alien defendant is subject to deportation, the court may provide, as a condition of
supervised release, that he be deported and remain outside the United States, and
may order that he be delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for such
deportation.” This section of the statute clearly does not apply to the Defendant.
The Defendant is not an alien, being a citizen of the United States, and is not

Case 3:10-cr-00061-RRB Document 48 Filed 05/24/17 Page 5 of 6

subject to deportation because of his charges and is not the ‘functional equivalent’
of an alien.
After thoroughly reviewing the pertinent documents and case law, the Court
will find that the Defendant has failed to demonstrate sufficient grounds on which
his motion should be granted. Therefore, the Defendant’s Motion Requesting
Modification of Supervised Release Conditions should be DENIED.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED May 24, 2017, in Anchorage, Alaska.
