_____________________________________________/
DEFENDANT, CASHSTAR INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS
FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM
Defendant, CashStar Inc., (“CashStar”) hereby files its Motion to Dismiss for Failure to
State a Claim, as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION

On August 17, 2015, Plaintiff filed her initial Complaint alleging that Defendant iCard
Gift Card, LLC (“iCard”) violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) by
sending “text message calls to the cellular telephones of consumers.” [D.E. 1, at ¶1]. Then, after
approximately sixteen (16) months of motion practice and discovery (including discovery as to
“iCard’s financials”), as well as failed settlement discussions with iCard, Plaintiff sought leave to
amend her complaint to add CashStar as a defendant. [D.E. 60, p. 4.]. In other words, after
failing to settle her claim with iCard, Plaintiff set out to find another pocket and now seeks to
improperly hold CashStar liable for the text message sent by iCard. In support of that effort,

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 2 of 15

Plaintiff has put forth purely speculative, conclusory allegations that cannot survive a challenge
under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6).
In a purely conclusory fashion and without any support, Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend
asserts CashStar “directed Defendant iCard to place the unlawful text message at issue.” [D.E.
65, at pp. 1, 2, 12].

Plaintiff’s First Amended Class Action Complaint (the “Amended

Complaint”) then simply blends CashStar and iCard together to blame them both for the text
messages that iCard sent. [D.E. 65, D.E. 34, at ¶¶ 2-6]. Regardless of this ambiguity in the
Amended Complaint, it cannot be disputed that CashStar cannot be directly liable for a violation
of the TCPA since CashStar never sent (or “initiated”) any text message at issue here.1 It is
clear, therefore, that Plaintiff’s attempt to drag CashStar into this case is based on legally
deficient aiding and abetting or vicarious liability theories.
Regardless of her theory of recovery, the Plaintiff’s claim against CashStar fails because
(1) as a matter of law, there is no aiding and abetting liability under the TCPA; and (2) Plaintiff’s
concocted vicarious liability theory is entirely unsupported by the facts pled and the case law she
relies upon, and is based entirely on improper “labels and conclusions.” An examination of the
cases the Plaintiff cites in her Motion to Amend (as well as others addressing vicarious liability
under the TCPA) shows that Plaintiff is attempting to fit the proverbial round peg into the square
hole by making broad, unsupported allegations that attempt to entirely re-characterize the
express language of the CashStar-iCard Agreement and CashStar’s limited contractual role as a
supplier of gift cards. In summary, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint should be dismissed because
it lacks any basis for the allegations against CashStar except for unsupported “labels and
conclusions” that Fed R. Civ P. 12(b)(6) is intended to preclude.
1

Nothing in this Motion is intended as, or should be construed as, a statement or implication by CashStar that iCard
violated any local, state, or federal laws. CashStar is not aware of any such violations.

II.

FACTS
1.

Procedural History

Plaintiff, Cecelia Snyder (“Plaintiff’), filed her Complaint on August 17, 2015, alleging
iCard violated the TCPA. [D.E. 1]. On December 5, 2016, Plaintiff filed her Motion to Amend
to add CashStar as a defendant. [D.E. 60]. On December 27, 2016, this Court granted Plaintiff’s
Motion to Amend. [D.E. 64]. On December 28, 2016, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint.
[D.E. 65].
Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend explains the path that brought her to attempt to add
CashStar, and unveils her improper motivations in doing so. Specifically, after receiving from
iCard “information as to the size of the class. The Parties then engaged in extensive settlement
discussion. [D.E. 60, p. 4.]. “As part of these discussions … Plaintiff propounded a second set
of discovery requests regarding iCard’s financials.” [Id.]. The settlement discussions “did not
result in any settlement.” [Id.]. Then, Plaintiff went fishing and began serving a series of third
party subpoenas. [D.E. 60, p 2]. Plaintiff served such a subpoena on CashStar and, in response,
CashStar produced the January 19, 2012 Digital Gift Card Distribution Agreement between
CashStar and iCard (the “Agreement”).

[D.E. 60, pp. 4-5].

Interestingly, while Plaintiff

references CashStar’s production of the Agreement in her Motion to Amend and relies upon such
production to assert that “it became apparent that CashStar was jointly responsible for the
unlawful text message calls at issue,” Plaintiff does not attach the Agreement either to her
Motion or the Amended Complaint. [D.E. 60, p. 5; see also D.E. 65, ¶ 18]. Instead, after
obtaining financial information from iCard and failing to settle her case, Plaintiff decided to
target CashStar and summarily assert, without any support, that CashStar “worked with, and
directed, Defendant iCard to place the unlawful text messages at issue.” [D.E. 60, pp. 1, 2, 12].
3

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 4 of 15

To support her concocted theory, in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff simply combines
the Defendants as “sellers of gift cards for retail stores” and asserts the “Defendants engaged in
an invasive and unlawful form of marketing: the transmission of unauthorized advertisements in
the form of ‘text message’ calls . . .” [D.E. 65, at ¶ 2].
2.

The CashStar-iCard Agreement

The CashStar-iCard Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A2, was executed
January 19, 2012 and provides that CashStar will provide its API (application programming
interface) to iCard to allow iCard to order digital gift cards through CashStar’s platform.
[Exhibit A, p. 1 General Description]. The Agreement provides that iCard “will market and
promote the Cards via relevant points of contact with Members, including but without limitation
[iCard’s] Sites and current advertising campaigns where appropriate.” [Exh. A., p. 3, Section 5].
The Agreement further provides that iCard “will perform its obligations hereunder in accordance
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations now or hereafter in effect.”
[Exh. A, p. 6, Section 18d]. The Agreement further provides that iCard is an independent
contractor, and that “none of the terms set forth in this Agreement will be construed as creating a
partnership, joint venture, agency, master-servant, employment, trust, or any other relationship . .
.” [Exh. A., p. 4, Section 9]. The Agreement makes no reference of any kind to telephone calls
or text messages to consumers, and does not direct or authorize iCard to place telephone calls or
send text messages to anyone by or on behalf of CashStar. [Exh. A].

2

Since Plaintiff specifically references the Agreement in her Motion to Amend and makes reference to the contract
between CashStar and iCard in the Amended Complaint, which Agreement is central to the Plaintiff’s claim against
CashStar, the Court may consider the Agreement as part of the pleadings for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,
and CashStar’s attaching the Agreement to its Motion to Dismiss will not require conversion of the motion into a
motion for summary judgment. See Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, 116 F. 3d 1364, 1369 (11th
Cir. 1997); Venture Assoc. Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., 978 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir. 1993) (“Documents that a
defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's
complaint and are central to her claim.”).

3.

Plaintiff’s Involvement with iCard and The Text Message

As shown in the voluminous motion practice to date in this matter, including Plaintiff’s
April 7, 2016 Declaration, Plaintiff’s allegations arise from her use of iCard’s website,
www.icardgiftcard.com. [D.E. 65; D.E. 42-3]. The record contains printouts from the iCard
website, including the pages visited by Plaintiff, as well as her description of the steps she took
to register through iCard’s website. [Id.; see also D.E. 80-2]. None of the printouts from the
iCard website previously relied upon and submitted to the Court by both Plaintiff and iCard refer
to or mention CashStar.
The text message at issue states, in totality, “Do you have an iPhone? Download the new
iCard Gift Card app in the App Store and save 10% on your gift card purchase. Enter promo
code: APP10.” [D.E. 65, at ¶ 15].

The text message does not reference CashStar in any way or

state it was sent by or on behalf of CashStar.
III.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
A.

Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim

To sustain her claim against CashStar, the Plaintiff must meet her “obligation to provide
the grounds of [her] entitlement to relief,” and she must allege more than “labels and
conclusions”; her complaint must include “[f]actual allegations [adequate] to raise a right to
relief above the speculative level.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)
(internal citations and quotations omitted).

Thus, the factual allegations in the Amended

Complaint must “possess enough heft” to set forth “a plausible entitlement to relief.” Id.
Additionally, “while notice pleading may not require that the pleader allege a ‘specific fact’ to
cover every element or allege ‘with precision’ each element of a claim, it is still necessary that a
complaint ‘contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements

5

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 6 of 15

necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.’” Financial Security Assurance,
Inc. v. Stephens, Inc. et al., 500 F. 3d. 1276 (11th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted). “[C]onclusory
allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not
prevent dismissal.” Oxford Asset Management, Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F. 3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir.
2002).
The Amended Complaint is replete with conclusory allegations, and unsupported and
unwarranted deductions that should not survive dismissal.
1.

Plaintiff Cannot Establish Direct Liability Against CashStar

Plaintiff has intentionally lumped the Defendants together in the Amended Complaint in
an attempt to create liability against CashStar for the text message sent by iCard. For example,
the Amended Complaint asserts “[b]eginning in 2015, and continuing for weeks if not months,
Defendants directed the mass transmission of wireless spam to the cell phones of individuals
intended to be potential purchasers of their gift cards.” [D.E. 65, at ¶ 14]. Such lumping
together of the Defendants is, in and of itself, grounds for dismissal of the Amended Complaint.
See Bentley v. Bank of America, NA, 773 F. Supp. 2d 1367 (S.D. Florida 2011) (dismissing
section 227(b)(1)(A) claim because “nowhere in the complaint does Plaintiff identify which
Defendant made each call, but instead he simply lumps the Defendants together despite that they
are separate and distinct legal entities.”).
Despite her unsupported allegations as they pertain to CashStar, Plaintiff cannot dispute
that iCard sent the text message at issue, not CashStar. Plaintiff has previously asserted this fact
in this case, and again concedes this point in the Amended Complaint where she alleges the text
message at issue came from an “SMS short code operated by iCard and/or its agents.” [D.E. 65,
at ¶¶ 15, 16]. As such, CashStar cannot be held directly liable for any violation of the TCPA.

6

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 7 of 15

As explained in Shamblin v. Obama for America, 2015 WL 1754628 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 17, 2015),
which Plaintiff cites in her Motion to Amend, the FCC has established that “a seller is not
directly liable for a violation of the TCPA unless it initiates a call, but may be held vicariously
liable under federal common law agency principles for a TCPA violation by a third-party
telemarketer.” Shamblin, 2015 WL 1754628, at *5 (citing Dish Network LLC Declaratory
Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd. 6574 (2013)). It was established long ago that iCard sent the text message
at issue here, not CashStar. Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot assert that CashStar initiated or sent
any such text message, and CashStar is therefore not directly liable for any violation of the
TCPA. Any attempt by the Plaintiff to assert otherwise is entirely unsupported and must be
rejected.
2.

Plaintiff’s Aiding and Abetting Theory Must Be Rejected

To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to assert that CashStar is somehow liable for the text
message sent by iCard based on an aiding and abetting theory, such a theory is not recognized
under the TCPA.
As noted by the Supreme Court in Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank
of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164 (1994), aiding and abetting liability in the civil context is not
generally available, and requires specific Congressional action as determined on a statute-bystatute basis. Central Bank, at 181-82. “When Congress enacts a statute under which a person
may sue and recover damages from a private defendant for the defendant’s violation of some
statutory norm, there is no general presumption that the plaintiff may also sue aiders and
abetters.” Central Bank, at 182. The TCPA does not provide for liability under an aiding and
abetting theory. See Baltimore-Washington Telephone Co. v. Hot Leads Co., LLC, 584 F. Supp.
2d 736, 745 (D. Md. 2008); TCPA, 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3).

7

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 8 of 15

The conclusory allegations of the Amended Complaint are that CashStar “directed” iCard
to send the text message. [D.E. 65, ¶¶ 16, 21]. Plaintiff, of course, provides no support for this
conclusion. To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to assert that CashStar aided and abetted iCard
in violating the TCPA, there is no such viable theory of recovery, and any such attempt should
be rejected, and the claims dismissed.
3.

Plaintiff Cannot Establish CashStar is Vicariously Liable for
iCard’s Alleged Violation of the TCPA

As set forth above, Plaintiff cannot establish any claim for direct liability against
CashStar, and likewise cannot assert a claim that CashStar aided and abetted iCard in a violation
of the TCPA. A vicarious liability theory, therefore, is Plaintiff’s only hope. An analysis of the
established law, coupled with the purely speculative and unsupported “labels and conclusions” of
the Amended Complaint. shows that Plaintiff cannot sustain such a claim and CashStar should be
dismissed from this action.
a.

Overview of Vicarious Liability Under the TCPA

Again, the allegations of the Amended Complaint are vague to the extent the Plaintiff
intentionally lumps Defendants iCard and CashStar together. That said, it appears that the
Plaintiff is attempting to establish CashStar’s liability for iCard’s alleged TCPA violation based
on a vicarious liability theory. Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend asserts that “as the entity that
directly benefitted from and directed iCard to undertake such marketing activity, CashStar can be
held jointly liable with iCard.” [D.E. 60, at p. 14]. In support of her argument, Plaintiff cites to
Shamblin v. Obama for America, 2015 WL 1754628 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 17, 2015) and the FCC’s
Declaratory Ruling, Dish Network LLC Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd. 6574 (2013).
Applying those teachings (as well as the teachings from other courts that have considered

8

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 9 of 15

vicarious liability under the TCPA), to the unsupported conclusory allegations of the Amended
Complaint shows the Amended Complaint must be dismissed as against CashStar.
As the Court noted in Shamblin, the “FCC has explained that vicarious liability may be
predicated upon federal common law agency principles.” Shamblin, at * 6 (citing Dish Network,
28 FCC Rcd. at 6586). As explained by the court, those principles include classical agency,
apparent authority, and ratification. Id. “A court determining the existence of vicarious liability
must first assess whether the principal had the necessary agency relationship with the direct
wrongdoer to support such liability.” Legg v. Voice Media Group, Inc., 20 F. Supp. 3d 1370,
1377 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (citing CFTC v. Gibraltar Monetary Corp., 575 F.3d 1180, 1189 (11th Cir.
2009). To support the requisite agency relationship, the Plaintiff would have to establish that
CashStar “exercised substantial control over” iCard’s actions, or “ratification of the agent’s
conduct, or representations that the agent acts with authority . . .” Legg, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 1377
(citing CFTC, 575 F.3d at 1189 and Dish Network, 28 FCC Rcd. At 6586-87). Additionally, the
“FFC has specifically ‘rejected’ the argument that vicarious liability extends beyond these
delineated agency principles in the context of the TCPA.” Id. (citing Dish Network, at 658586).3

3

It is worth noting that Shamblin involved claims that DNC Services Corporation should be vicariously liable for
calls made by Obama for America. Shamblin, at *1. In Shamblin, “the record shows that DNC Services provided
voter information to Obama for America, reviewed telemarketing scripts, and also provided technical support.” Id.
at * 5. The FCC’s Declaratory Ruling in Dish Network involved petitions to the FCC that arose in two federal court
lawsuits, each of which concerned “telemarketing retailers” and “authorized dealers” making telemarketing calls
attempting to sell satellite television services for EchoStar and Dish Network, respectively. Dish Network, at 65766579. The FFC addressed whether a company specifically hiring a telemarketer to market their products could be
liable even though they did not directly “initiate” such calls, and reasoned that “both the entity that engages a
telemarketer and the telemarketer so engaged may be liable for TCPA violations.” In re Dialing Services, LLC, 29
FCC Rcd. 5537 (2014) (referencing Dish Network) (emphasis added).

b.

Plaintiff Has Not Set Forth a Valid Vicarious Liability
Theory

The Amended Complaint fails to assert a proper claim for vicarious liability as against
CashStar. The Amended Complaint lacks required allegations, and instead relies on unsupported
“labels and conclusions” that do not satisfy the legal requirements for vicarious liability under
the TCPA, and should thus be rejected under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6). The reason the Amended
Complaint lacks such allegations is because Plaintiff simply can not assert the required elements
in good faith.
The CashStar-iCard Agreement does not address telemarketing or text message
campaigns in any way. [Exh. A.]. Given this, Plaintiff is attempting to conflate the “marketing”
mentioned in the Agreement with the type of “telemarketing” addressed in the case law and FCC
Declaratory Ruling she relies upon. Plaintiff then takes the unsupported, conclusory leap to say
that the CashStar-iCard Agreement somehow establishes a principal-agency relationship and
further that it means CashStar was hiring or directing iCard to telemarket its products. As set
forth above, the CashStar-iCard Agreement explicitly states that no principal-agency relationship
is created, no such direction is included in the CashStar-iCard Agreement, and Plaintiff cannot
point to anything to support such a bald assertion. Instead, Plaintiff attempts to deduce that when
the Agreement states that iCard “will market and promote Cards” that CashStar somehow
exercised substantial control over, and directed iCard, to engage in an improper text message
campaign. [See Exh. A. at p. 3, Section 5; D.E. 65, at ¶ 21]. There is no support for such an
allegation, and such “conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal
conclusions masquerading as facts” cannot survive dismissal. Oxford Asset Management, Ltd. v.
Jaharis, 297 F. 3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).
1.

Lack of Substantial Control
10

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 11 of 15

The Amended Complaint fails to set forth anything to establish that CashStar “exercised
substantial control over” iCard’s actions. Legg, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 1377 (citing CFTC, 575 F.3d
at 1189. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida has reasoned that
the issue of “control” is key to the determination of whether a party will be vicariously liable for
unconsented to calls made on its behalf pursuant to section 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the TCPA. Mais
v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc. et al., 944 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1243 (S.D. Florida 2013)
(rev’d in part 768 F.3d 1110 (11th Cir. 2014).4 In Mais, the plaintiff, Mark Mais, sued medical
provider Florida United Radiology (“Florida United”), Sheridan Acquisitions, P.A. (“Sheridan”),
Florida United’s parent company, and Gulf Coast Collection Bureau (“Gulf Coast”) for violating
the TCPA, section 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) (the same section cited in the Plaintiff’s complaint here).
Mais alleged that Florida United and Sheridan were vicariously liable for 15-30 predictive dialer
bill collection calls Gulf Coast made to his cell phone in violation of the TCPA. Mais at 1231.
The Mais Court granted summary judgment in favor of Florida United and Sheridan as to
the claims that they were vicariously liable for Gulf Coast’s actions on the grounds that neither
Sheridan nor Florida United “exercised, or had the right to exercise the kind of control over Gulf
Coast necessary to create vicarious liability.” Id. at 1244. First the court analyzed the parties’
bill collection contract. Id. The contract identified Gulf Coast as an “independent contractor.”
Id. “Most significantly” the Mais Court noted, the contract “is silent” as to how Gulf Coast
would collect debts. Id. It did not specify equipment to be used by Gulf Coast (i.e. predictive
dialer) to carry out debt collection or define procedures Gulf Coast would use to communicate
with debtors. “By its silence, the contract left such matters to Gulf Coast’s judgment and
wisdom as an expert debt collector.” Id. The Mais Court highlighted the fact that the contract
4

The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit reversed Mais, in part, on other grounds that did not affect the District
Court’s entry of summary judgment against Florida United and Sheridan. Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau,
Inc., 768 F. 3d 1110 (11th Cir. 2014).

11

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 12 of 15

required Gulf Coast to do all work in accordance with the law. Id. Ultimately, the Mais Court
found an “absence of control” of “all relevant aspects of Gulf Coast’s conduct or procedures”
and held there cannot be vicarious liability. Id.
Similarly, the CashStar-iCard Agreement identifies iCard as an independent contractor,
and does not direct or instruct iCard as to how it would conduct its business or “market” gift
cards. Like the contract in Mais, the Agreement is silent as to how iCard would market gift
cards, other than stating iCard would “market and promote the Cards via relevant points of
contact with Members, including but without limitation [iCard’s] Sites and current advertising
campaigns where appropriate.” [Exh. A, at p. 3, § 5]. Also like the contract in Mais, the
Agreement further provides that iCard “will perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with
all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations now or hereafter in effect.”
[Exh. A, p. 6, Section 18d].
2.

The Amended Complaint Does Not Establish
Grounds for Apparent Authority

Similarly, Plaintiff cannot point to a single fact, website printout, or anything that
amounts to “representations that the agent acts with authority . . .” to support an apparent
authority argument. Legg, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 1377 (citing CFTC, 575 F.3d at 1189 and Dish
Network, 28 FCC Rcd. At 6586-87). As Plaintiff herself explained in her Declaration submitted
to the Court on April 8, 2016, she visited iCard’s website in 2013 and completed a “New
Customer Account Set-Up form”. [D.E. 42-3, ¶¶ 2-3]. Plaintiff has also previously filed with
the Court printouts from the iCard website she visited in support of her prior motion practice.
[D.E. 42-4; see also iCard Website printouts submitted by iCard at D.E. 80-1]. Nothing therein
points to CashStar, and the Amended Complaint does not allege in any way that iCard somehow
held out to the Plaintiff (or anyone else) that it was the agent of CashStar or acting with authority
12

Case 0:15-cv-61718-WPD Document 84 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/24/2017 Page 13 of 15

on behalf of CashStar. See Legg, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 1377 (citing CFTC, 575 F.3d at 1189 and
Dish Network, 28 FCC Rcd. At 6586-87) (discussing apparent authority agency principle).
3.

No Ratification

Lastly, Plaintiff does not allege that CashStar somehow ratified the text message at issue,
and Plaintiff cannot point to any fact that would establish that CashStar was even aware of the
text message campaign that iCard admits it elected to send in mid-2015. [D.E. 34, ¶¶ 2-6]. See
Legg, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 1377 (discussing ratification and citing CFTC, 575 F.3d at 1189 and
Dish Network, 28 FCC Rcd. At 6586-87). Further, the text message at issue states, in totality,
“Do you have an iPhone? Download the new iCard Gift Card app in the App Store and save 10%
on your gift card purchase. Enter promo code: APP10.” [D.E. 65, at ¶ 15]. The text message
does not reference CashStar in any way or state it was sent by or on behalf of CashStar.
Plaintiff cannot sustain a claim that CashStar is vicariously liable for iCard’s violation of
the TCPA because Plaintiff cannot establish the requisite agency relationship that the FCC
mandates to sustain such a theory. Neither can Plaintiff hide behind, or attempt to rely on
“conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as
facts” to prevent dismissal of her claim against CashStar. Oxford Asset Management, Ltd. v.
Jaharis, 297 F. 3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).
IV.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint should be dismissed for
failure to state a claim against CashStar.
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Defendant CashStar Inc. respectfully requests
that this Court enter an Order (1) dismissing Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint as against CashStar;
and (2) entering all such other relief as is deemed just and equitable under the circumstances.
