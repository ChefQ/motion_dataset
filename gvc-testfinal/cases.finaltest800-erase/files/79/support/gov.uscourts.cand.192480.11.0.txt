TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

3

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on September 17, 2007 at 9:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as

4

the matter may be heard in Courtroom 8 of the above-entitled Court located at 280 South 1st Street,

5

4th Floor, San Jose, California 95113, defendants Okun Holdings, Inc., Investment Properties of

America, LLC, Edward H. Okun and Richard B. Simring (collectively, “Defendants”) will, and

7

hereby do, move this Court for an order dismissing plaintiff Anita Hunter’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint

8

without leave to amend.

9

This Motion is made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on

10

the grounds that Defendants do not have sufficient contacts with California—either generally or

11

with respect to the subject matter of the Complaint—to subject them to jurisdiction in this State.

12

This Motion is based upon this Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss, the attached

13

Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the concurrently-filed Declarations of Edward H. Okun

14

and Richard B. Simring, the concurrently-filed proposed order, the pleadings and records on file

15

herein, such further papers as may be filed in connection with this Motion and on such further

16

evidence and argument as may be presented at the hearing on this Motion.

Counsel for Defendants has conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel and the scheduled hearing

I.

I TRODUCTIO

3

Plaintiff Anita Hunter’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety for lack

4

of personal jurisdiction. Defendants Okun Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), Investment Properties of

5

America, LLC (“IPofA”), Edward H. Okun and Richard B. Simring (collectively, “Defendants”)

6

are not domiciled in California, and they do not do business in California or otherwise have

7

minimum contacts with this State. Additionally, this action does not concern any purported

8

wrongdoing by Defendants. Rather, it is premised solely on alleged acts by nonparties 1031

9

Advance, Inc. (“Advance”) and its parent company, The 1031 Tax Group, LLC (“Tax Group”).

10

The Complaint’s only factual allegations tying the conduct of these nonparties to Defendants are

11

that Mr. Okun is a member and Mr. Simring was an officer of Tax Group, a Delaware limited

12

liability company. These allegations, however, plainly are insufficient as a matter of law to support

13

jurisdiction over Mr. Okun, Mr. Simring or the other Defendants. Accordingly, the Complaint

14

should be dismissed without leave to amend.

B.

The Individual Defendants

Defendants’ Lack Of Involvement In The Conduct Alleged In The Complaint

18

The central contention in Plaintiff’s Complaint is that Advance, a California corporation,

19

breached its obligations as a “qualified intermediary” under a Real Property Exchange Agreement

20

(the “Agreement”) governing Plaintiff’s tax-deferred “1031 exchange” of real property. Complaint

21

¶ 35, Ex. A, p. 1; see id. ¶ 40.1 In particular, Plaintiff contends that Advance failed to return

22

exchange proceeds in its possession. Id. ¶ 40. Based solely on this alleged breach by Advance,

23
24
25
26
27
28

1

A “1031 exchange” is made pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 1031, which provides that
that “[n]o gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a
trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind
which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.” 26 U.S.C. §
1031(a)(1). A “qualified intermediary” provides the mandatory mechanics of a 1031 exchange. The
sale proceeds of the property go directly to the qualified intermediary, who holds them until they
are needed to acquire replacement property. The qualified intermediary then delivers the funds
directly to the closing agent who deeds the replacement property to the taxpayer.

Plaintiff purports to assert a nationwide class action against Tax Group—Advance’s parent

company and a nonparty to the Agreement—and all of Tax Group’s “subsidiaries.” Id. ¶ 28.

3

But Plaintiff has not named Advance, Tax Group or any of its “subsidiaries” as a defendant

4

in this action. Instead, Plaintiff has sued Defendants—persons and entities who are not parties to

5

the Agreement and otherwise have had no dealings with Plaintiff.2

ARGUME T

7

Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the Court to dismiss

8

Plaintiff’s Complaint in its entirety if it finds that Defendants are not subject to personal

9

jurisdiction in California. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that

10

jurisdiction exists as to each Defendant. Ballard v. Savage, 65 F.3d 1495, 1498 (9th Cir. 1995).

11

Plaintiff cannot meet her burden through conclusory allegations. Rather, she must allege well-pled

12

facts establishing all of the necessary jurisdictional bases. China Technology Global Corp. v.

13

Fuller, Tubb, Pomeroy & Stokes, No. C 05-01793 JW, 2005 WL 1513153, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. June

14

27, 2005) (Ware, J.). Further, in assessing Plaintiff’s showing, the Court may consider evidence

15

presented in Defendants’ affidavits. Doe v. Unocal, 248 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation

16

omitted). And the allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint, if contradicted by Defendants’ affidavits, are

17

insufficient. See, e.g., Pena v. Valo, 563 F. Supp. 742, 747 (C.D. Cal. 1983) (holding that Plaintiff

18

failed to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction where he relied only on conclusory allegations

19

in his complaint in response to allegations in defendants’ affidavits).

20

Where, as here, there is no applicable federal jurisdictional statute, the Court has personal

21

jurisdiction over Defendants to the extent permitted by California’s long-arm statute. Panavision

22

Int’l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1320 (9th Cir. 1998). California’s long-arm statute permits a

23

court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the extent permitted by the

24
25
26
27
28

2

Plaintiff alleges that the Agreement is entered into between her and Defendants. Complaint, ¶ 35.
The Agreement, however, is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit A and it states that it is entered
into by and between Plaintiff and Advance. Id., Ex. A, p. 1. It is well-settled that the facts set forth
in the Agreement control over Plaintiff’s inconsistent allegations in her Complaint. Thompson v.
Illinois Dept. of Prof. Reg., 300 F.3d 750, 754 (7th Cir. 2002) (“(W)hen a written instrument
contradicts allegations in a complaint to which it is attached, the exhibit trumps the allegations.”)

Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10. In order

2

to satisfy due process requirements, each of the Defendants must have “minimum contacts” with

3

California such that the maintenance of this suit here “does not offend the traditional notions of fair

4

play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S. Ct.

8

(1984). Where there is general jurisdiction, the Court can exercise jurisdiction as to any cause of

9

action, even if unrelated to Defendants’ activities within California. Burger King Corp. v.

10

Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 477-78, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985). Otherwise, the Court

11

may exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendants only if there is a direct relationship between

12

Defendants’ contacts with California and Plaintiff’s claims in her Complaint. Hirsch v. Blue Cross,

13

Blue Shield of Kansas City, 800 F.2d 1474, 1477 (9th Cir. 1986). As detailed below, neither

14

general nor specific jurisdiction exists over any of the Defendants.

15

A.

one Of The Defendants Are Subject To General Jurisdiction.

16

Because Defendants are not domiciled in California, they may be subject to general

17

jurisdiction only if their activities in this State are “substantial” or “continuous and systematic.”

18

Helicopteros, 466 U.S. 408, 414-416, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1984). The standard for

19

establishing general jurisdiction is “fairly high” and Defendants’ contacts must be of the sort that

20

“approximate physical presence” in California. Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta Nat’l, Inc.,

21

223 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted; emphasis added); see Schwarzenegger v.

22

Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 801 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[a finding of general jurisdiction] is an

23

exacting standard, as it should be, because a finding of general jurisdiction permits a defendant to

24

be haled into court in the forum state to answer for any of its activities anywhere in the world”); see

25

also Congoleum Corp. v. DLW Aktiengesellschaft, 729 F.2d 1240, 1242-43 (9th Cir. 1984)

26

(foreign corporation’s sales and marketing efforts in forum state, including solicitation of orders,

27

promotion of products to potential customers through the mail and through showroom displays, and

28

attendance at trade shows and sales meetings, held insufficient to assert general jurisdiction).

1

Defendants’ contacts with California are far from continuous and systematic contacts of the

2

sort that approximate physical presence in this State. The corporate Defendants—Holdings and

3

IPofA—are not incorporated or organized under California law, are not headquartered in California

4

and are not qualified to do business here. They never have operated, conducted, engaged in or

5

carried on any business in California. They never have had an office or business agent in

6

California. They never have had a mailing address, telephone number or bank account in

7

California. They never have owned any real or personal property in California. They never have

8

advertised in California. They never have made or sold goods or services to residents of California.

9

They never have designated an agent for service of process in California. They never have paid or

10

been assessed any taxes by the State of California. And they never have commenced a legal action

11

in a court located in California. Okun Decl. ¶¶ 2-19.

12

The individual Defendants—Mr. Okun and Mr. Simring—are not California residents, and

13

they do not have a residence, mailing address, telephone number, bank account, investment

14

account, office, agents or a place of business in California. They do not operate, conduct, engage in

15

or carry on any business in California. They do not own, lease or possess any real property in

16

California. They do not pay income or property taxes to the State of California. And they never

17

have commenced a legal action in a court located in California. Okun Decl. ¶¶ 20-25; Simring

18

Decl. ¶¶ 2-7. Under these circumstances, none of the Defendants are subject to general jurisdiction

19

in California.

20

B.

one Of The Defendants Are Subject To Specific Jurisdiction.

21

Since Defendants are not subject to general jurisdiction, this action should be dismissed

22

unless Plaintiff demonstrates a sufficient nexus between her claims and Defendants activities

23

within California such that specific jurisdiction is proper. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472. In this

24

regard, Ninth Circuit precedent requires Plaintiff to allege facts establishing: (1) Defendants have

25

purposefully availed themselves of the benefits and protections of California law; (2) Plaintiff’s

26

claims arise directly out of Defendants’ contacts with California; and (3) the exercise of

27

jurisdiction over Defendants is reasonable. Bancroft, 223 F.3d at 1086. Plaintiff has not alleged,

28

nor can she allege, facts establishing any of these requirements.

Defendants Have ot Purposefully Availed Themselves Of The Benefits And
Protections Of California Law.

3

Defendants may be deemed to have “purposefully availed” themselves of the benefits and

4

protections of California law only if they have purposefully directed activities at residents of

5

California or purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities within

6

California. Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253-54, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (1958); see

7

Figi Graphics, Inc. v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 33 F. Supp. 2d 1263, 1266 (S.D. Cal. 1998) (“purposeful

8

availment” means “deliberate action” toward forum state) (citing Ballard, 65 F.3d at 1498). This

9

requirement ensures that Defendants will not be haled into this Court based upon “random,

10

6535 WILSHIRE BOULEVARD, SUITE 203, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA 90048

1.

Document 11

fortuitous or attenuated” contacts with California. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475.

11

Defendants’ contacts with California are, at best, random and fortuitous because they do not

12

conduct any business or other activities within California, and they have not engaged in any

13

business or activities purposefully directed at California residents. See Okun Decl. ¶¶ 21-25;

14

Simring Decl. ¶¶ 3-7. Further, the Complaint does not allege any facts such that the activities in

15

California of any other person or entity are attributable to Defendants. The Complaint’s only

16

factual allegations seeking to create such a link are that Mr. Okun is a member and Mr. Simring

17

was an officer of non-party Tax Group. Complaint ¶¶ 14-15. But Tax Group is a Delaware limited

18

liability company that maintains its principal place of business in Richmond, Virginia. Okun Decl.

19

¶ 26. And its mere ownership of Advance, a California corporation, is insufficient to subject Tax

20

Group—let alone Defendants—to personal jurisdiction in California. See Transure, Inc. v. Marsh &

21

McLennan, Inc., 766 F.2d 1297, 1299 (9th Cir. 1985) (“[T]he existence of a parent-subsidiary

22

relationship is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over companies.”); Platten v. HG

23

Bermuda Exempted Ltd., 437 F.3d 118, 139 (1st Cir. 2006) (“The mere fact that a subsidiary

24

company does business within a state does not confer jurisdiction over its non-resident parent, even

25

if the parent is the sole owner of the subsidiary. There is a presumption of corporate separateness

26

that must be overcome by clear evidence.”).

27

Additionally, discovery would not reveal any facts linking Defendants to activities in

28

California such that jurisdiction is proper. Holdings has never done any business in California or

Plaintiffs’ Claims Do ot Arise Out Of Any California-Related Activities By
Defendants.

11

Plaintiff’s claims may be deemed to arise out of Defendants’ contacts with California only

12

if “but for” these contacts, Plaintiff would not have sustained her purported injury. Terracom v.

13

Valley Nat’l Bank, 49 F.3d 555, 561 (9th Cir. 1995). Defendants’ activities, if “too attenuated” to

14

Plaintiff’s alleged injury, will not satisfy this standard. Doe v. Am. Nat’l Red Cross, 112 F.3d

15

1048, 1041 (9th Cir. 1997).

16

Defendants’ nearly non-existent contacts with California are far too attenuated to Plaintiff’s

17

alleged injury to satisfy the “but for” test. As noted above, the Complaint’s only factual allegations

18

attempting to link Defendants to California are that Mr. Okun is a member and Mr. Simring was an

19

officer of Tax Group and Tax Group is the parent company of Advance, a California corporation.

20

Complaint ¶¶ 14-15, 34. Even assuming the truth of these contentions, they do not establish—or

21

even tend to establish—that: (a) Tax Group, a Delaware entity, undertook any activities in

22

California; or (b) “but for” Mr. Okun’s and/or Mr. Simring’s involvement with Tax Group, she

23

would not have sustained her purported injury. Furthermore, as just detailed, discovery would not

extent of Defendants’ “purposeful” interjection into California; (2) the burden on Defendant in

8

defending in California; (3) the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the Defendants’ States;

9

(4) California’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; (5) the most efficient judicial resolution of the

10

controversy; (6) the importance of California to Plaintiff’s interest in convenient and effective

11

relief; and (7) the existence of an alternative forum. Core-Vent Corp. v. Nobel Indus., 11 F.3d

12

1482, 1485 (9th Cir. 1993).

Exercising Jurisdiction Over Defendants Would Be Unreasonable.

13

Balancing these factors, it would be unreasonable to exercise jurisdiction here. Defendants

14

have not purposefully interjected themselves into California. See Okun Decl. ¶¶ 2-29; Simring

15

Decl. ¶¶ 2-8. Yet they would face an extreme and undue burden if they were forced to defend

16

themselves here. Defendants would incur substantial inconvenience and expense in traveling to

17

California, and producing documents and witnesses here, nearly all of which would be located in

18

Virginia and Florida. Even if Plaintiff’s burden in traveling to Virginia and Florida equals

19

Defendants’ burden, and it would not, this factor tips in favor of Defendants because the law of

20

personal jurisdiction is “primarily concerned with the defendant’s burden.” Terracom, 49 F.3d at

21

561. Further, since most of the parties, witnesses and documents are located in Virginia and

22

Florida, California is not the most efficient forum to resolve this controversy. Finally, Plaintiff may

23

pursue her claims against Defendants in alternative forums—Virginia and Florida.
