INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff, a California resident, filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, against Defendants for, among other
things, RICO violation, fraud and breach of contract. Plaintiff alleges Defendants' pervasive
contacts with California, and alter ego liability of Defendants and a third party, The 1031 Tax
Group ("Tax Group"), and its San Jose office, 1031 Advance, Inc. ("Advance"). Tax Group and

Advance operated a 1031 exchange business in California and are currently in bankruptcy.

Case 5:07-cv-02795-JW Document18 ~~ Filed 09/04/2007 Page 2 of 11

Defendants challenge this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over them on the
grounds that the exercise of personal jurisdiction violates the general standards of due process
under the United States Constitution. Defendants allege that they lack sufficient contacts with
the forum State to allow the Court to assert general or specific jurisdiction. Defendants do not
contest Plaintiff's alter ego allegations, including Plaintiff's claim that the alter egos of
Defendants had sufficient contacts with the State; they merely state that they were not involved
in the day-to-day operations.

Preliminary evidence establishes a prima facie showing of minimum contacts with the
forum State through an alter ego theory of liability and/or the exercise of nationwide personal
jurisdiction available in RICO actions. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over Defendants
because the alter egos of Defendants had contacts with the forum State sufficient for exercise of
general and/or specific jurisdiction over them. Additionally, one of the Defendants had
independent contacts with California, so consistent and systematic as to allow exercise of general
jurisdiction.

In the event that the Court deems the preliminary evidence insufficient to allow the Court
to establish jurisdiction, Plaintiff requests that the Court grant a continuance of this hearing and
order that jurisdictional discovery may be conducted based on a colorable showing of
jurisdiction.

II.
LEGAL ARGUMENT

A. PLAINTIFF MADE A PRIMA FACIE SHOWING OF PERSONAL
JURISDICTION BY SHOWING THAT DEFENDANTS ARE THE
ALTER EGO OF A BUSINESS HAVING MINIMUM CONTACTS
WITH CALIFORNIA.

When a defendant's motion to dismiss is made as its initial response, and no evidentiary
hearing is held, plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists.

Case 5:07-cv-02795-JW Document18 ~ Filed 09/04/2007 Page3 of 11

Assoc., Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977) To make a prima facie showing, plaintiff need

 

only demonstrate facts that, if true, would support jurisdiction over the defendant. Ballard v.
Savage, 65 F.3d 1495, 1498 (9th Cir. 1995).
Uncontroverted allegations in the complaint are deemed true. WNS, Inc. v. Farron, 884

F.2d 200, 204 (Sth Cir. 1989).

 

Here, such a prima facie showing has been made by showing that Defendant OKUN,
HOLDINGS, IPOfA and SIMRING had minimum contacts with California, sufficient to
establish personal jurisdiction over them.

1. A Prima Facie Showing of Personal Jurisdiction Over
Non-Resident Defendants through Alter Ego Liability is
Shown by a Unity of Interests Between Contesting
Defendants and a Resident Third Party and by a
Showing of Injustice.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over all Defendants in the case at bar because
Defendants are the alter ego of Tax Group, now in bankruptcy, whose San Jose, California,
office, Advance, was a 1031 exchange qualified intermediary doing business in California.

Under the body of federal law governing the exercise of in personam jurisdiction, it is
well established that if a corporation is the alter ego of an individual defendant, or one
corporation the alter ego of another, the Court may "pierce the corporate veil" jurisdictionally
and attribute "contacts" accordingly. Ado Finance, AG v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 931 F.
Supp. 711, 715 (D. Cal. 1996), citing Certified Building Products, Inc. v. NLRB, 528 F.2d 968
(9th Cir. 1975).

In Ado Finance, the Court stated that "if a corporation is an alter ego of an individual or
another corporation, then the district court may disregard the corporate form and exercise
personal jurisdiction over the other individual or entity." Ado Finance, 931 F.Supp. at 715. The
Court further stated that the corporate form may be ignored in cases in which the corporation is
the agent or alter ego of the individual defendant or where there is an identity of interests

between the corporation and the individuals. Ado Finance, 931 F.Supp. at 715, referring to Davis

v. Metro Productions, Inc., 885 F.2d 515, 520-21 (9th Cir. 1989), citing Dietal v. Day. 16 Ariz.

880 F. Supp. 743, 750 (C.D.Cai. 1995).

In Ado Finance, the contesting defendants claimed that the court was without jurisdiction
over them because there was no factual basis to pierce the corporate veil, because there was no
evidence of bad faith or fraud, because the corporation was always adequately capitalized,
because the corporation adequately observed all corporate formalities, because there had been no

"asset stripping" by the corporation, because the contesting defendants had never agreed to be

responsible for the corporation's debts, and because the contesting defendants were never

poor
co

employees, officers, directors or agents of the corporation, nor even its shareholders, having only

indirect share interest though holding companies. Despite the contentions of contesting

defendants, the Court denied their motion to dismiss, holding that where there is personal

of the contesting defendants, then the Court has personal jurisdiction over the contesting

of the resident corporation, while the CEO had no actual control.

Here, the situation is almost identical. Third party Tax Group's San Jose Office,
Advance, was "acquired by [Defendant OKUN'S] interests." (Decl. of OKUN 2:26) Defendant
OKUN is the "sole owner and officer" of Advance. (Decl. of OKUN 3:1) Advance is a
subsidiary of Tax Group, and Tax Group is wholly owned by Defendant HOLDINGS. (Decl. of
PARR 2:4-9, Exhibit 1) Defendant HOLDINGS, in turn, is wholly owned by Defendant OKUN.
(Decl. of OKUN 1:3-4) Thus, Defendant OKUN had sole control and management over the
affairs of Advance and Defendant HOLDINGS.

Further, address of Advance on the California Secretary of State's website is identical to
the address of IPOfA, HOLDINGS, and Tax Group. Decl. of Parr, 3224-28, 4:1-8.

In addition, Defendant OKUN and Defendant SEMRING dominated the management and
operations of Advance and Tax Group. Defendant OKUN, as sole owner of both the subsidiary
and parent companies, dominated the activities of Advance and Tax Group. Defendant OKUN
undertook such managerial decision making as appointing Defendant SIMRING as the Chief
Executive Officer of Tax Group and its subsidiaries, inclusive of the San Jose Office in
California, to the extent that instructions were given by Defendant OKUN to all subsidiaries to
only act upon Defendant SIMRING's instructions. (Decl. of HUNTER 2:25, 3:1-7) Further, Tax
Group, controlled by OKUN, issued unsecured promissory notes to HOLDINGS, controlled by
OKUN, in the amount of $132,000,000.00. Decl. of PARR 2:10-13, 2:20-24) It is easy to infer
that an unsecured note for $132,000,000 with the payment term "on demand" would be given by
a lender to an entity only if that entity is an alter ego of the lender.

Finally, OKUN reported the income of the subsidiaries on his personal tax return. (Decl.
of PARR 3:1-5).

Thus, a unity of interest existed between Defendants OKUN, IPofA, HOLDINGS and
SIMRING under the Ado Finance test.

b, Failure to pierce the corporate veil will result in fraud or injustice
under the Ado Finance test.

Case 5:07-cv-02795-JW Document18 Filed 09/04/2007 Page 6 of 11

In Ado Finance, supra, the evidence that failure to pierce the corporate veil would result
in fraud or injustice was sufficient in that the contesting defendants dominated the corporation
and stripped it of its assets. Moreover, plaintiff proffered evidence that the corporation has spun.
off subsidiaries for less than their true value, and siphoned off liquid assets by loaning substantial
sums of money to its holding company, and dramatically reduced its share capital by more than
half.

Here, the facts are substantially similar. Tax Group, controlled by OKUN, issued
unsecured promissory notes to HOLDINGS, controlled by OKUN, in the amount of
$132,000,000.00 and virtually stripped the assets of Tax Group and Advance by taking
$132,000,000.00, which companies are both in bankruptcy. (Declaration of PARR 2:13-17)
Defendants exploited HOLDINGS and Advance by "borrowing" unsecured monies. They then
threw the empty corporate and LLC shells to the bankruptcy trustee and now, apparently,
suggest, without making an affirmative contention, that no personal jurisdiction exists because
the alter ego of a named defendant is in bankruptcy. Defendants cite no authority for such
suggestion, |

At the same time, the Defendants who are not in bankruptcy continue to enjoy their
bounty and are trying to escape liability in California by using their stacking-doll like business
structure as a defense against this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over them.

Not to allow piercing of the corporate veil between OKUN, HOLDINGS, IPOfA on the
one hand and Tax Group and Advance on the other, would cause great injustice to California
residents, who lost their money entrusted to Advance and Tax Group.

Therefore, Plaintiff made a sufficient prima facie showing to allow the Court to exercise
in personam jurisdiction through pleading Defendants' unity of interest with Tax Group and
Advance, the latter having sufficient contact with California. In addition, Plaintiff has made a
sufficient showing that injustice would occur if the Defendants were allowed to avoid personal

jurisdiction in California.

2. Defendants' Contact With California though Tax
Group and Advance Was Substantial so as to Warrant
the Exercise of General Jurisdiction Over Them.

General jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant is found if a foreign defendant's

activities in the forum are substantial, continuous and systematic. Ado Finance, AG v.

 

MeDonnell Douglas Corp., 931 F. Supp. 711, 714-715 (D. Cal. 1996), citing Perkins v. Benguet
Consolidated Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 446 (1952).

Defendants, through Tax Group and Advance, marketed to and did business with
Californians related to providing qualified intermediary services for California residents
engaging in the process of real estate exchanges. (Decl. of Hunter, 1:24-28, 2:1-2, 493, 4.)
Advance was registered by the California Secretary of State. (Decl. of Parr, Exhibit 4.)

Defendants, through Tax Group and Advance engaged in marketing of their 1031
exchange services to the residents of California, such as placing ads in local Yellow Pages and
engaging services of professional marketing companies, as is evidenced from the list of creditors
of Tax Group. (Decl. of Parr, 3:6-11, {10.)

Furthermore, Tax Group had an insurance broker in California, through which tax Group
secured a bond for $10,000,000, which it displayed to California residents via internet. Decl. of
Parr, 2:26-28, 98.

Lastly, Defendant IPOfA advertised and sold tenancy in common interests in its real
property to California residents, and employed brokers to market and sell said interests in
California. Decl. of Hunter, 3:8-16, 911.

Courts have found general jurisdiction on much lesser contact. The 9" circuit court in
Ballard, supra, acquiesced in the Third Circuit court's decision in Provident Nat'l Bank v.
California Fed. Sav. & Loan, 819 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1987), where the court found general
jurisdiction over a California bank where the only meager connections to Pennsylvania were
that: (1) .066 percent of its depositors were Pennsylvania residents; (2) .071 percent in

outstanding loans were traceable to Pennsylvania residents; (3) it maintained a "zero balance"

account with Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh to clear its California checks cashed in Pennsylvania;
and (4) it may or may not have purchased mortgages on the open market that were secured by
real property in Pennsylvania. The court found those contacts substantial, continuous and
systematic so as to find general jurisdiction.

Here, advertising and selling the IPOfA product in California undoubtedly constitutes
grounds for exercise of general jurisdiction.

Thus, Defendants acts through IPOfA, Tax Group and Advance were substantial,
continuous and systematic so permit exercise of general jurisdiction over them.

3. Contact with California was Specific and Purposeful so as to Warrant
the Exercise of Specific Jurisdiction

If a nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum state are not so pervasive to permit
exercise of general jurisdiction, the court may still assert specific jurisdiction if the foram
contacts give rise to a cause of action. Ado Finance. AG v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 931 F.
Supp. 711, 715 (D. Cal. 1996) citing Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 250-253 (1958).

The Ninth Circuit uses a three-part test to evaluate the nature and quality of a defendant's
contacts for purposes of specific jurisdiction: (1) the nonresident defendant must perform some
act by which he purposefully avails himself of the benefits and protections of the forum state's
laws; (2) the plaintiff's claim must arise out of or result from the defendant's forum related
activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable. Data Disc, supra, 557 F.2d at
1287; Sher v. Johnson, 911 F.2d 1357, 1361 (th Cir. 1990).

Here, Plaintiff claim arises out of the California activities of Defendants, where, instead
of facilitating the 1031 exchange for Plaintiff, Defendants, who had unfettered control over Tax
Group and Advance, transferred Plaintiff's money from California to entities controlled by
Defendants in other jurisdictions. ( Decl. of Hunter, 2:13-17). Thus, Defendants purposefully
availed themselves to the jurisdiction in California.

Exercise of personal jurisdiction in California would be reasonable, in light of the

activities of OKUN "interests" (Decl. of OKUN 2:27), in California, operated by Defendants

OKUN and SIMRING, and in light of the substantial injuries to numerous California residents.

B. ONCE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER ONE DEFENDANT
IS ESTABLISHED IN RICO ACTIONS, THE COURT MAY
EXRECISE JURISDICTION OVER OTHER DEFENDANTS
THROUGH NATIONWIDE JURISDICTION.

In certain matters, federal Courts are empowered to exercise nationwide personal
jurisdiction such that if the Defendant has minimum contacts with the United States as a whole,
then said Defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction in any federal district within the
United States (Bourassa v. Desrochers, 938 F.2D 1056, 1058(1991) (allowing nationwide
personal jurisdiction in a securities fraud action)). Some Courts have held that RICO actions fall
within the category of actions allowing for nationwide jurisdiction (See Republic of Pan. v.
BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) 8.A., 119 F.3d 935, 942 (1997).

The RICO statute authorizes venue for civil actions in any district in which the defendant
"resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs" (18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1965(a)) and it authorizes
service of process "in any judicial district in which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or
transacts his affairs" (18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1965(d)). The Complaint alleges that the named Defendants
had agents in, and transacted affairs in the forum state. Thus, pursuant to the terms of the RICO
statute, the named Defendants are subject to jurisdiction in California.

The Ninth Circuit has held that 18 U.S.C.S. 0x00A7 1965(b) allows for nationwide personal
jurisdiction in RICO cases only when it is shown that the ends of justice require it (Butcher's
Union Local No. 498 v. SDC Invest.. Inc., 788 F.2d 535, 538 (1986)). The ends of justice are
served by venue in the forum state if a plaintiff can show that there is no other district in which a
court will have personal jurisdiction over all of the alleged co-conspirators (Id at 539). In this
matter, as stated in Defendants' moving papers, Defendants HOLDINGS and IPofA are Virginia
corporations. Defendants OKUN and SIMRING are residents of the State of Florida. Therefore,
there is no district in which a Court would have personal jurisdiction over all of the Defendants.

As a result, the ends of justice are served by allowing nationwide personal jurisdiction and

keeping the case in California.

C. IF THE COURT FINDS THAT PLAINTIFE'S SHOWING OF
THE PRIMA FACIE JURISDICTION IS INSUFFICIENT,
PLAINTIFF ALTERNATIVELY REQUESTS A CONTINUANCE
TO ALLOW JURISDICTIONAL DISCOVERY.

The court in its discretion may continue the hearing in order to permit discovery for
purposes of determining jurisdictional facts. Orchid Biosciences, Inc. v St. Louis Univ., 198
F.R.D. 670, 672-673 (SD Cal. 2001). Courts are afforded a significant amount of leeway in
deciding whether parties may conduct discovery relating to jurisdictional issues while a motion
to dismiss is pending, and where pertinent facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction are in

dispute, discovery should be allowed. Orchid. at 672-673.

 

Here, Plaintiff made at least a colorable showing of personal jurisdiction, as stated
hereinabove, and in the Declarations of Hunter and Parr and jurisdictional discovery should be
granted if the Court find that further discovery is necessary to demonstrate facts sufficient to
constitute a basis for jurisdiction. In such case, Plaintiff would respectfully request an order
allowing jurisdictional discovery and continuing the hearing on the motion so as to enable her to
conduct such discovery.

Til.
CONCLUSION

Based on the above, Plaintiff requests that the motion to dismiss be denied, or,

alternatively, be continued to allow Plaintiff to conduct jurisdictional discovery. Alternatively,

should the motion be granted, Plaintiff respectfully requests leave to amend the Complaint to add

specific allegations with regard to the nature of the relationship, and activities between
Defendants, Tax Group and Advance.
