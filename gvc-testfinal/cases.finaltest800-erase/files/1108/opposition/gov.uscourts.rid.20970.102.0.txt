To put it mildly, this is not the first time Tower has mentioned sanctions in this matter.
To date, Tower has already filed a motion seeking sanctions on at least eight different grounds,
threatened two additional sanctions motions, including for what it thought were insufficiently
detailed affirmative defenses,1 and now has filed this motion, once again asking this Court to
severely punish ELE and its attorneys. Fully consistent with Tower’s past practice, it files this
motion on a hodge-podge of sometimes minor grounds, the vast majority of which this Court has
already addressed in a prior sanctions motion, and all of which have already been raised by
Tower in previous filings. Worst still, the very motion in which Tower asks this Court to
exercise its inherent power to level a (possibly record-setting) sanction for hundreds of
thousands of dollars against ELE for alleged inaccuracies and overstatements contains numerous
inaccuracies and overstatements of its own. For example:
Claim: “… as CEO it is hard to believe that [Long Zhang] did not know that Shanghai
ELE had sold vast quantities of LCDIs to U.S. customers (74,247 units for
$391,565) that Tower later uncovered.” Tower Br. at 7 (emphasis added).

Tower’s first threatened motion for sanctions came on May 25, 2007, when despite knowing that ELE’s counsel
was in Hong Kong at the time and despite ELE’s good faith efforts to address any and all of Tower’s concerns with
ELE’s discovery responses, Tower’s counsel sent an email at 10:53 AM EST (10:53 PM local time in Hong Kong)
to ELE’s counsel informing ELE that Tower intended to file a motion for sanctions against ELE at 1:30 PM EST
that same day (1:30 AM local time in Hong Kong). ELE’s local counsel promptly responded to Tower’s counsel’s
email and expressed his concerns as to why Tower insisted that its motion for sanctions must be filed by 1:30 PM
EST. Tower subsequently agreed to delay filing its motion until Tuesday, May 29, 2007. On Tuesday, May 29,
2007 at approximately 3:33 AM local time in Hong Kong (3:23 PM EST), ELE’s counsel responded by email to
Tower’s draft motion for sanctions and explained in detail why Tower’s motion was without merit. Tower did not
file its motion for sanctions on May 29, 2007. Second, after ELE filed its Answer and Counterclaim to Tower’s
Complaint, Tower sent a letter and served a motion for sanctions under Rule 11 on the grounds that ELE did not
sufficiently plead the standard patent litigation defenses of inequitable conduct, unclean hands, and patent misuse.
Notably, in a prior litigation between Tower and Technology Research Corporation (“TRC”) before this very Court
(Tower Manufacturing Corporation v. Technology Research Corporation, C.A. No. 06-212-T-DLM (D.R.I.) (the
“Tower-TRC Litigation”)), Tower filed a Motion for More Definite Statement with respect to TRC's inequitable
conduct, unclean hands, and patent misuse affirmative defenses and counterclaims, and the Court denied that
motion. Although ELE’s Answer and Counterclaim had the same level of detail that this Court found appropriate in
the Tower-TRC Litigation, and ELE therefore was well aware that Tower's draft motion for sanctions was meritless,
ELE compromised and withdrew those affirmative defenses in order to avoid the time and expense of opposing that
motion and wasting further court resources on such an unnecessary motion.

THE TRUTH: ELE’s sales of LCDIs directly into the United States (i.e., less than
75,000 at the time Mr. Zhang signed the declaration) do not represent “vast
quantities” relative to ELE’s world-wide sales, for which ELE has sold several
million LCDI devices, the vast majority of which were, and are, to Far East
manufacturers.
Claim: “Shanghai ELE misdirected the Court to First Circuit law on personal
jurisdiction[.] … In the face of [the Court’s question as to why ELE cited a First
Circuit case], Shanghai ELE could not make any good faith argument for
extending, modifying, or reversing existing law such that Shanghai ELE would
not be required to follow Federal Circuit authority.”

Tower Br. at 12-13

(emphasis added).
THE TRUTH: In response to the Court’s question as to why ELE cited a First Circuit
case, ELE responded: “[We cited the First Circuit case] [b]ecause we did not find
a Federal Circuit case directly on that issue, your Honor. We don’t dispute that
Federal Circuit law applies.” Motion to Dismiss Hearing Tr. at 23:3-7 (emphasis
added). Contrary to Tower’s arguments, ELE clearly did not “misdirect” the
Court or lack good faith in citing the case as Tower suggests.
Claim: “At worst, however, the timing suggests that [ELE] may have attempted to bury
the 34 pages of customer support documents by swearing one day that they did
not exist, yet providing them in Chinese the next.” Tower Br. at 20 (emphasis
added).
THE TRUTH: The thirty four pages of customer feedback forms were produced in a
separate document production consisting solely of these 34 pages a day after the
answers to written depositions were served, and therefore were clearly not
“buried” in a larger document production as Tower suggests.
Tower’s efforts to affirmatively mislead this Court in hopes of obtaining its fees and costs
in connection with jurisdictional discovery should not be tolerated. This is particularly so where

it is demanding “hundreds of thousands of dollars” even while remaining unwilling to even
enumerate how it reached these numbers.2
In Magistrate Martin’s Report and Recommendation regarding ELE’s Motion to Dismiss
(Docket. No. 80, “Report and Recommendation”), Magistrate Martin admonished ELE and its
counsel for the overstatements for which Tower now seeks sanctions. In doing so, Magistrate
Martin noted that he found some of ELE’s behavior “troubling” and “disturbing” -- words that
Tower tirelessly repeats in its brief (five times in all). See Tower Br. at 1, 5, 13, 17. Now, three
months after the Report and Recommendation was issued, Tower comes back to Court and seeks
sanctions for the same conduct about which its has already complained, the same conduct for
which the Court has already admonished ELE, and in many respects the same conduct for which
Tower already moved for, and been awarded, sanctions.
Simply put, enough is enough. ELE has provided extensive and detailed discovery and
information concerning a wide array of issues as to its operations. In its good faith efforts to do
so, it made a handful of misstatements which the declarations of Long Zhang and Barkley Bao
(attached hereto as Exhibits B and C) confirm were nothing more than honest mistakes. Every
statement ever made by ELE to this Court was believed to be true at the time it was made, and

2

Through ELE’s attempts to resolve the issues raised by Tower’s latest sanctions motion, ELE understands that
Tower is claiming that it should receive at least $315,000. See Declaration of Joshua M. Dalton (“Dalton Decl.”) at
¶ 4 (attached hereto as Exhibit A). Tower’s figure of $315,000 allegedly does not include Tower’s costs and fees
associated with researching and drafting its opposition to ELE’s Motion to Dismiss, which Tower does not
purportedly seek. Id. ELE is at a complete loss for how Tower could conceivably have spent over $300,000 on
jurisdictional discovery alone. Notably, ELE has not spent over $300,000 on the entire case. Id. at ¶ 5.
Nonetheless, in hopes of furthering a settlement dialogue, ELE offered to settle this dispute for $30,000 -- which
ELE viewed as more than the nuisance value of briefing and arguing the motion -- but Tower rejected that offer and
refused to make a counteroffer. Id. at ¶¶ 7-8. Indeed, Tower’s counsel responded by voicemail and stated that if
ELE could not start the settlement discussion at “six figures,” then Tower was “not interested at all.” Id. at 8.
ELE’s counsel responded by email and noted that ELE was struggling to understand how Tower could claim it was
entitled to fees anywhere near the $30,000 ELE had offered to settle, let alone the $300,000+ it was demanding. As
such, ELE requested that Tower provide a more detailed fee claim, and specifically, to indicate what if any of the
fees it was demanding were unrelated to issues already vetted by the Court or that are otherwise not properly the
subject of a motion for sanctions. See Ex. 1 to Dalton Decl. Tower has thus far never provided the requested
breakdown of its fees or otherwise responded to the questions posed in the email. Dalton Decl. at 10. Because
Tower has no conceivable basis for claiming damages in a range of “six figures,” let alone over $300,000, ELE has
been forced to respond to Tower’s Motion.

ELE's representatives deeply regret that a handful of them turned out in hindsight to be anything
less than 100% accurate. ELE has taken this situation to heart, and intends to be even more
careful, precise, and diligent going forward. ELE respectfully suggests that this Court’s stern
admonishment to ELE in the Report and Recommendation is a sufficient sanction, and that the
parties should now move on to the merits of this case. For these reasons, and those discussed
herein, this motion for sanctions should be denied.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE COURT SHOULD NOT EXERCISE ITS INHERENT
POWER TO SANCTION SHANGHAI ELE ON THESE FACTS
Acknowledging that it failed to abide by the procedures set forth in Rule 11 for

requesting sanctions, Tower now tries to shoe-horn its time-barred request into the Court’s
“inherent power” to sanction ELE and use it to award Tower “hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
Tower Br. at 1. There is no question that this Court possesses the inherent power to sanction
litigation misconduct. See, e.g., Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin, 60 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1995)
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Chambers, 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991)) (holding that
a district court may use its inherent powers to assess attorneys’ fees against a party that has
“acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.”). Nevertheless, such
powers should not be used lightly. “Before awarding sanctions under its inherent powers,
however, the court must make an explicit finding that counsel's conduct ‘constituted or was
tantamount to bad faith.’” Primus Automotive Financial Services v. Batarse, 115 F.3d 644, 648649 (9th Cir. 1997), quoting Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 767 (1980). Indeed,
the United States Supreme Court has made clear that the inherent power of the court to sanction
alleged misconduct should be used sparingly. See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44 (“Because of their
very potency, inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.”).
Nothing at issue here merits exercise of such powers, let alone to the extreme degree
requested by Tower. Tower provides no evidence to suggest that ELE or its counsel “acted in
bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” As discussed below, the statements

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

at issue from Mr. Zhang and Mr. Bao were innocent mistakes. Each believed their statements to
be true and accurate at the time they made them, and none of the overstatements cost Tower any
more money than it would have spent in jurisdictional discovery absent the statements.
Accordingly, ELE should not be sanctioned for those statements. Likewise, Tower’s request for
the Court to exercise its inherent power and sanction ELE for the arguments that it made
concerning the applicable jurisdictional law is baseless. ELE’s jurisdictional arguments were
entirely proper and are not sanctionable.
A.

The Overstatements by Mr. Zhang in his Declaration Do Not
Justify Sanctions

On or about November 16, 2006, Mr. Zhang signed a declaration that was submitted in
support of ELE’s Motion to Dismiss (the “Declaration”). The Declaration was Mr. Zhang’s first
personal involvement in United States litigation.

See Second Declaration of Long Zhang

(“Zhang 2d Decl.”) at ¶ 2. While Tower admits that “the record does not show that Mr. Zhang
knew Shanghai ELE sold to U.S. customers at the time Mr. Zhang executed his declaration,”
Tower argues that as its CEO, Mr. Zhang somehow should have known that ELE’s LCDIs were
being sold to U.S. customers. Tower Br. 7 (emphasis added).
It is undisputed that Mr. Zhang did not misstate any of ELE’s direct contacts (or lack
thereof) specifically with the State of Rhode Island. Only after and through ELE’s extensive
search for, and review of, documents and information in response to Tower’s discovery requests
in 2007, did ELE learn that the 2006 Declaration overstated ELE’s lack of sales of LCDIs and
GFCIs directly into the United States as a whole. Zhang 2d Decl. at ¶ 4. Specifically, while
confirming that “[t]here are two types of Shanghai ELE’s products that are currently sold in the
United States markets,” the 2006 Declaration indicated that those products did not come into the
United States directly, but instead came to the United States only through exporters or as part of
a completed product manufactured outside of the United States. Id. at ¶ 5. Although those
statements would have been accurate as to ELE’s shipments to Rhode Island directly, Mr. Zhang

5

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

Page 7 of 24

came to understand after the fact that the statements, as written, overstated ELE’s lack of sales to
the United States directly. Id.
As affirmed by his attached declaration, at the time Mr. Zhang signed the Declaration, he
believed his statements to be completely true and accurate. Zhang 2d Decl. at ¶ 6. ELE is a
privately owned manufacturer of household electrical products, with its headquarters located in
the City of Shanghai, China, and other manufacturing facilities located in Jiangsu and Zhejiang
Provinces, China. Id. When ELE began its sales of LCDI devices in December 2005, it focused
its sales efforts on original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in China and the Far East. Id.
Its focus was not, and has never been, on United States OEMs, and ELE did not export any
LCDI devices to the United States during the first sales cycle (which lasted through early 2006).
Id. In the following year’s sales cycle (for which ELE was in the midst of at the time the
Declaration was signed), ELE again focused it sales on OEMs in the Far East, and as such Mr.
Zhang assumed that no sales had been made directly to the United States. Id. However,
unbeknownst to Mr. Zhang, at the time the Declaration was signed, ELE’s sales department had
managed to make a small number of sales (for a total of less than a hundred thousand units out of
millions sold in China) to two manufacturers in the States of Texas and New York respectively.
Id.
Mr. Zhang and ELE had no intent to deceive this Court or Tower, nor did Mr. Zhang
intend to overstate ELE’s lack of contacts with the United States generally in paragraphs 10, 11,
and 15 of the Declaration. Zhang 2d Decl. at ¶ 7. Rather, as the Chief Executive Officer of
ELE, Mr. Zhang did not have significant involvement in the day-to day-operations, and as such
was not aware of these new, low-level sales directly to the United States. Id. While all of Mr.
Zhang’s statements concerning ELE’s lack of contacts specifically with the State of Rhode
Island were true (including Paragraphs 3-9, 12-14, 17-19, 21-22, 24), Mr. Zhang recognizes that
he should not have been so definitive in making assertions concerning ELE’s lack of contacts
with the United States generally. Id.

Notably, the overstatements by ELE did not help its cause in this case. Since GFCIs are
not in any way at issue in this case, ELE’s GFCI sales into the United States were irrelevant.
Tower never seriously contended this to be a “general jurisdiction” case, and went on to concede
-- after discovery -- that ELE did not have continuous and systematic contacts into the United
States with either its GFCI or LCDI products to justify a finding of general jurisdiction.
With respect to LCDIs, ELE’s LCDI sales directly into the United States represent de
minimis percentage of ELE’s worldwide LCDI sales.

After the statements were made,

jurisdictional discovery proceeded and facts were learned that contradicted Mr. Zhang’s
representations. By the time Tower opposed the Motion to Dismiss, the overstatements were
well known by both parties, and Tower specifically noted ELE’s direct LCDI sales in its
opposition to ELE’s Motion to Dismiss. See, e.g., Tower Opp. to Motion to Dismiss at 10. In its
reply brief, ELE acknowledged those facts, did not hide from the facts, and never relied on the
overstatements. Rather, in its reply brief, ELE acknowledged the true facts, accepted those facts,
and applied them to the law. Even Tower concedes that ELE applied the true facts in its reply
brief. Tower Br. at 13-14 (“[ELE] flipped [the statements] into an argument that its direct U.S.
Sales supported its position against Rule 4(k)(2) jurisdiction in Rhode Island.”).
ELE recognizes that once it came to learn about them, it would have been better to
affirmatively notify the Court of the overstatements, or at least drop a footnote in the reply brief
specifically calling out the overstatements and acknowledging that it was not relying on them.
Nonetheless, despite considering ELE’s conduct and specifically noting Mr. Zhang’s
overstatements, Magistrate Martin did not sanction ELE for the overstatements or ELE’s failure
to correct the statements. Instead, Magistrate Martin publicly admonished ELE for failing to
correct the statements. ELE and its counsel respect the public admonishment and do not take it
lightly. In view of the public admonishment, ELE does not believe that further sanctions are
warranted under the Court’s inherent power.
Tower’s arguments for the exercise of the Court’s inherent power here are unavailing.
Tower’s reliance on Rottlund Co., Inc. v. Pinnacle Corp., 22 F.R.D. 363 (D. Minn. 2004) is

A/72530191.7/3313764-3300207036

7

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

misplaced, as the conduct that motivated the Court there to exercise its inherent power and
sanction the defendant was far worse than that alleged here.

Specifically, in Rottlund, in

connection with a suit concerning allegedly infringing designs of townhomes in Minnesota, the
defendant denied having any contact with the State of Minnesota, moved to dismiss for lack or
personal jurisdiction and objected to participating in discovery while its motion to dismiss was
pending, arguing that “[t]he Court should deny Rotlund’s request to go fishing for non-existent
facts relating to jurisdiction.” Id. at 378 (emphasis in original). Despite these arguments, during
discovery the defendant produced a file the defendant referred to as “a great big file called
Minnesota,” which “demonstrated that [defendant’s] architect was heavily involved in designing
the allegedly infringing townhomes in Minnesota.” Id. at 365, 377 (emphasis in original).
Indeed, it was subsequently learned that defendant’s in-house counsel received the Minnesota
file twenty days before oral argument on the motion to dismiss -- an argument where defendant
again asserted that “there is no evidence that [defendant] actually designs, builds, or sells homes
in Minnesota[.]”. Id. at 378 (emphasis in original). In view of information learned in discovery,
the Court found that “had [this information] been disclosed to outside counsel, the motion to
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction most likely would not have even been filed; thus
relieving Rottlund of all fees and costs incurred.” Id. at 379.
The same can not be said here. ELE did not misrepresent any facts related to its contacts
with Rhode Island specifically, and had Mr. Zhang identified the handful of sales of LCDIs to
Texas and New York, the motion to dismiss clearly would still have been filed. Indeed, Tower
does not even purport to seek its fees in connection with having to oppose the motion to dismiss.
Moreover, in Rottlund even in view of “[defendant’s] troubling pattern of conduct involving the
abuse of the judicial process, discovery incompetence, and defiance of Court orders, not to
mention periodic episodes of brazen disrespect to the Court and an instance of cowardly

harassment during a deposition,” the Court only awarded plaintiff $4,492.70 as a sanction for the
alleged misrepresentations in the motion to dismiss pleadings.3 Rottlund, 22 F.R.D. at 364.
Tower also cannot seriously contend that the innocent mistakes made in this case are
analogous to the extreme misconduct that occurred in Qualcomm Corp. v. Broadcomm Corp.¸
No. 05-1958, 2008 WL 66932 (S.D. Cal. 2008). There, the Court sanctioned Qualcomm and its
attorneys $8.5 million for committing “incredible discovery violation[s] by intentionally hiding
or recklessly ignoring relevant documents, ignoring or rejecting numerous warning signs that
Qualcomm’s document search was inadequate, and blindly accepting Qualcomm’s unsupported
assurances that its document search was adequate.” Id. at *18 (emphasis added). In Qualcomm,
the defendant failed to produce “forty-six thousand documents (totaling more than three hundred
thousand pages), which had been requested but not produced in discovery.” Id. at 6. Here, ELE
and its counsel’s conduct in no way rises to the level of conduct perpetrated by Qualcomm and
its attorneys. ELE’s counsel meticulously walked through Mr. Zhang’s Declaration paragraph
by paragraph and assuredly pushed for documents throughout the jurisdictional discovery phase.
Unless Tower is suggesting that counsel was required to fly to China to personally audit ELE’s
financials, ELE’s counsel did everything it should have done to vet the accuracy of the initial
statements. ELE and its counsel certainly did not “intentionally” deceive Tower or this Court.4

3

In Rottlund, the plaintiff had moved for sanctions under Rule 11 after the motion to dismiss, but the Court denied
that motion and refused to revisit its Rule 11 ruling. Id. at 366-67. Nonetheless, the Court found that defendant’s
pattern of misconduct, including the misconduct from its lack of candor during the motion to dismiss, warranted
sanctions under the Court’s inherent power.
4

Tower’s reliance on Meridith, Inc. v. Marketing Resources Group of Oregon, Inc., 2005 WL 2334294 (E.D. Mo.
2005) and Kraemer Export Corp. v. Peg Perego U.S.A., Inc., 1994 WL 86357 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) for the proposition
that the Court should sanction ELE under Rule 11 is also misplaced. In Meridith, the plaintiff moved under Rule 11
for sanctions in connection with defendants’ assertion that they did not have any contact with the plaintiff in
Missouri (i.e., the subject forum). Even in view of the misrepresentation concerning contacts with the subject
forum, the Court only awarded sanctions against each defendant in the amount $4,000 ($1,500 each to be paid to the
plaintiff and $2,500 to be paid to the Court). See Meridith, Inc., 2005 WL 2334294 at *5. Similarly, in Kraemer,
the Court sanctioned the defendant under Rule 11 for misrepresenting that it did not have an office in New York (i.e.,
the subject forum). Again, here, ELE did not overstate any facts related to its contacts with Rhode Island and the
overstatements that were made did not cost Tower any more money than it would have spent regardless. “[C]ourts
ought not invoke Rule 11 for slight cause; the wheels of justice would grind to a halt if lawyers everywhere were
sanctioned every time they made unfounded objections, weak arguments, and dubious factual claims. Young v. City

Accordingly, the Court should deny Tower’s request for the Court to exercise its inherent power
to sanction ELE for the overstatements made by Mr. Zhang.
B.

The Minor Inconsistency Noted in Mr. Bao’s Answers to
Written Deposition Questions Does Not Justify Sanctions

Repeating arguments that it made in its opposition to ELE’s Motion to Dismiss (see Opp.
Br. at 11), Tower points to a single customer support feedback form indicating quality control
problems that LG had with certain LCDI devices, and argues that ELE mislead Tower and the
Court because that single feedback form produced by ELE a day after ELE served Mr. Bao’s
answers to the 141 written deposition questions contradicts a select few answers to the written
deposition questions.

Specifically, Tower asked in Question 27: “To what customer or

customers did Shanghai ELE provide customer support regarding a ‘technical problem’?” Mr.
Bao responded to Question 27 as follows: “After a duly diligent review of our customer support
feedback forms, I have not located records of any instances in which such support was provided
to any LCDI customer.” In Question 30, Tower asked: “For each customer listed in response to
question 27, list all individuals with which Shanghai ELE had contact regarding such customer
support.” Mr. Bao responded to Question 30 as follows: “After a duly diligent review of our
customer support feedback forms, I have not located records of any instances in which such
support was provided to any LCDI customer. In general, Shanghai ELE does not record the
name of the individual seeking customer support.” Second Declaration of Barkley Bao (“Bao
2d. Decl.”) at ¶ 8. Tower asked similar questions concerning customer support and customer
service generally and business problems, transports problems, and storage problems specifically.
Id.
Tower asked 141 detailed questions, including dozens that related to customer
interactions that made subtle distinctions between customer support, customer service, business

of Providence ex. Rel. Napolitano, 404 F.3d 33, 39-40 (1st Cir. 2005) (setting aside Rule 11 sanctions, vacating

problems, technical problems, transportation problems, delivery problems, and others.

The

document to which Tower refers (ELE-TRC000793) as contradicting Mr. Bao’s answer to
Question 30 relates to products with quality control problems that were returned by LG’s factory
in China. Id. at ¶ 10. Apparently these LCDIs were assembled in air conditioner units by LG’s
factory in China and then shipped to the United States to be sold, but were returned back from
the U.S. due to quality control problems. Id. Mr. Bao did not understand that feedback form, or
any of the feedback forms, to be related to “technical problems,” a term that he understood at the
time of answering the 141 written deposition questions to mean something like design defects or
problems that require technical support from ELE to the air conditioner manufacturers. Id. In
response to quality control complaints by air conditioner manufacturers, the issues were
internally resolved within ELE, and sometimes ELE would replace the LCDIs returned by the air
conditioner manufacturers with replacement LCDIs. Id. The responses, in short, were nothing
more than a good faith attempt to fairly and accurately answer the (quite precise and narrow)
questions posed.
Mr. Bao served as the point person for ELE in connection with its efforts to collect
documents and information in response to Tower’s discovery requests, and he personally
reviewed the customer feedback forms before responding to the written deposition questions.
Bao 2d. Decl. at ¶ 2, 11. Notably, when Mr. Bao reviewed the customer feedback forms, he
noted that they were all in Chinese and therefore assumed they were all records related to air
conditioner manufacturers in China. Id. at ¶ 11. Prior to preparing the responses, Mr. Bao
conferred by telephone with counsel and discussed each of the 141 written deposition questions
and answers one by one. Bao 2d. Decl. at ¶ 6. At the time that Mr. Bao answered the 141
written deposition questions, he did not believe that any of his answers contradicted the feedback
forms. Bao 2d. Decl. at ¶ 11.
In light of the myriad different sub-questions posed to Mr. Bao, ELE does not believe any
of the answers contradict the feedback forms. To the extent the Court believes that they do, ELE
certainly had no intent to deceive Tower or the Court. Indeed, as reflected by ELE’s production

of the customer feedback forms the day after serving the answers to the written deposition
questions, ELE plainly had no intent to deceive Tower in responding to the 141 written
deposition questions. Bao 2d. Decl. at ¶¶ 7, 12. Moreover, contrary to Tower’s claims, ELE did
not “bury” the customer feedback forms. The customer feedback forms that purport to contradict
Mr. Bao’s testimony were produced in a separate document production consisting solely of the
customer feedback forms. Id. There clearly was no intent to deceive by giving an answer to a
question one day and producing documents that arguably contradict that answer the next day.
Specifically separating the customer feedback forms into their own separate production is not
“burying” the documents, and if anything, ELE’s separate production of the documents shows its
good faith efforts not to hide the feedback forms. Accordingly, the Court should not exercise its
inherent power to sanction ELE for an arguable inconsistency in Mr. Bao’s answers to the
written deposition questions.
For the same reasons as well as counsel’s significant efforts to gather the information at
issue, sanctions under Rule 26(g) are also improper. Rule 26(g) “imposes an affirmative duty to
engage in pretrial discovery in a responsible manner that is consistent with the spirit and
purposes of Rule 26 through 37.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g), adv. Comm. notes 1983 amendments.
While the rule encourages sanctions5 where counsel or a party makes a faulty response after
failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry, what constitutes a reasonable inquiry depends on the
“totality of the circumstances.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g), adv. Comm. notes 1983 amendments.
Importantly, counsel “may rely on assertions by the client and on communications with other
counsel as long as that reliance is appropriate under the circumstances.” Id.
Here, counsel conferred with Mr. Bao and walked through the 141 questions and answers
one by one, confirming the accuracy for each.

Moreover, ELE produced the alleged

Rule 26(g) permits an “appropriate sanction” to be levied on “the person who made the certification, the party on
whose behalf the disclosure, request, response, or objection is made, or both.” The sanctions “may include an order
to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, caused by the violation.” Fed.
R. Civ. P. 26(g).

contradictory customer feedback forms in a separate document production the day after serving
the answers to written deposition questions. There clearly was no deceptive intent on ELE or its
counsel’s part. Neither ELE nor its counsel understood the answers to be incorrect at the time
they served them, and the steps that ELE took to confirm the accuracy of the response were
certainly sufficient under the circumstances. See Maynard v. Nygren, 332 F.3d 462, 470 (7th
Cir. 2003) (holding that attorney could not be sanctioned under rule authorizing sanctions against
attorneys for certifying discovery disclosures in violation of rules, where counsel had no
knowledge that discovery response was inadequate).
C.

ELE’s Arguments Concerning The Applicable Jurisdictional
Law Do Not Justify Sanctions

Adopting a “spaghetti approach” of throwing as many allegations against the wall as
possible, Tower incredibly argues next that ELE and its counsel should be sanctioned for (1) not
citing the Federal Circuit case Beverly Hills Fan Co. v. Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558
(Fed. Cir. 1994) in its initial moving brief in support of its Motion to Dismiss and (2) citing the
First Circuit case Boit v. Gar-Tec Products, Inc., 967 F.2d 671 (1st Cir. 1992) in its reply brief.
Both arguments are weightless.
First, Beverly Hills Fan was not dispositive to ELE’s Motion to Dismiss. As the United
States Supreme Court has made clear time and time again, it -- not the Federal Circuit -- is the
final arbiter of patent disputes. The controlling authority setting forth the proper standards that
the Court should consider in determining whether personal jurisdiction exists (including under a
stream of commerce theory) have been established by the Supreme Court, including in the cases
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,
471 U.S. 462 (1985) and Asahi Metal Industries Co. v. Superior Court of California, 480 U.S.
102 (1987) -- all of which were cited by Beverly Hills Fan as setting forth the proper test for
determining whether personal jurisdiction exists in a patent case and all of which were cited by
ELE its initial moving brief.

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

Page 15 of 24

This is not a case where a party obtained relief by misrepresenting the law and failing to
cite controlling authority. ELE cited the proper standards for personal jurisdiction as established
by the Supreme Court and applied those standards to the facts of this case. Tower opposed that
motion and argued that Beverly Hills Fan was factually analogous to the present dispute. On
reply, ELE distinguished Beverly Hills Fan. The Beverly Hills Fan case was before the Court,
and both sides presented their arguments with respect to that case. While the Court ultimately
concluded that Beverly Hills Fan was factually analogous and relied upon it in finding
jurisdiction here, ELE’s failure to cite the case in its initial moving brief is plainly not
sanctionable conduct. See Miera v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 143 F.3d 1337, 1342-43 (10th Cir. 1998)
(holding that attorney’s failure to cite dispositive federal case holding was not so unreasonable as
to warrant holding attorney personally liable for costs and attorney fees). In essence, Tower is
arguing that because ELE did not agree with Tower’s application of Beverly Hills Fan, ELE
should be sanctioned. That clearly is not the law.
Second, Tower wholly misrepresents the facts in arguing that “ELE misdirected the
Court to First Circuit law on personal jurisdiction”

Tower Br. at 12 (emphasis added).

Specifically, Tower claims that after misdirecting the Court:
ELE then continued to argue the incorrect law, including at the hearing on the
Motion to Dismiss, where Magistrate Judge Martin specifically noted this issue by
asking Shanghai ELE’s Counsel: ‘[w]hy do you cite Boit versus Gar-tech
Products, a First Circuit Case…?’ (Motion to Dismiss Hr’g Tr. 22:19-21, attached
as Ex. B to Bifano Dec.). In the face of this question, Shanghai ELE could not
make any good faith argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law
such that Shanghai ELE would not be required to follow Federal Circuit authority.
Instead, it misdirected the Court by incorrectly implying that it was Tower who
had cited the incorrect law in Tower’s Rule 4(k)(2) arguments. … Rather than
charging Tower with off-point legal research, Shanghai ELE should have properly
investigated the law before filing and arguing its Motion to Dismiss.
Tower Br. at 12-13. A review of the hearing transcript reflects that Tower’s assertions are
baseless. In response to the Court’s question as to why ELE cited the First Circuit case, counsel
responded:
[We cited Boit] [b]ecause we did not find a Federal Circuit case directly on that
issue, your Honor. We don’t dispute that Federal Circuit law applies. And by the
A/72530191.7/3313764-3300207036

way, I would add, that if you notice in their papers when they get to 4(k)(2), they
start coming back to -- they argue First Circuit law applies.
Motion to Dismiss Hearing Tr. at 23:3-7. Contrary to Tower’s assertions, ELE confirmed, as it
stated in its moving papers, that it did not dispute that Federal Circuit law applies. Thus, ELE
did not misdirect the Court to First Circuit law. Rather, ELE cited a First Circuit case instead of
a Federal Circuit case because it did not find a Federal Circuit case with such clear language on
the indisputable point it was asserting, namely that “mere awareness that a product may end up
in the forum state does not constitute ‘purposeful availment.’” Furthermore, contrary to Tower’s
assertions, in response to Tower’s claim that ELE’s counsel “charg[ed] Tower with off-point
legal research,” ELE never claimed that Tower cited Boit in support of its Rule 4(k)(2)
arguments. Rather, ELE correctly noted that Tower cited First Circuit case law in connection
with its Rule 4(k)(2) arguments.
In the final analysis, Tower has set forth no evidence to suggest that ELE acted in bad
faith sufficient for the Court to exercise its inherent power to sanction, and has only managed to
rehash old issues and skew and exaggerate the facts in its attempt to do so. Tower’s request for
sanctions pursuant to the Court’s inherent power should be denied.
II.

ELE AND ITS COUNSEL SHOULD NOT BE SANCTIONED
UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1927
Tower’s request for sanctions under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 is largely duplicative of its first

motion for sanctions filed in connection with ELE’s alleged discovery abuses, and therefore to
the extent those issues have been vetted and ruled upon by the Court, they should not be
revisited. In order to recover attorneys’ fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927, “an attorney’s
conduct must multiply the proceedings and be ‘unreasonable and vexatious’ to warrant the
imposition of sanctions.” Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 631 (1st Cir. 1990). “Courts should …
exercise [their sanctioning power pursuant to § 1927] only in instances of a serious and studied
disregard for the orderly process of justice.” Ford v. Temple Hosp., 790 F.2d 342, 347 (3d Cir.
1986). “[M]erely unintended, inadvertent, and negligent acts will not support an imposition of
sanctions under section 1927.” Cruz, 896 F.2d at 613 (affirming award of $3,000 sanction as a

A/72530191.7/3313764-3300207036

result of plaintiff’s pursuit of frivolous claims and sanctioning plaintiff $1,000 for appealing the
sanctions order); see also In re 680 Fifth Ave. Associates, 218 B.R. 305, 322-23 (Bkrtcy.
S.D.N.Y. 1998) (denying request for sanctions under § 1927 where attorney’s misstatement was
apparently the result of confusion, and not of any improper purpose such as delay or harassment,
and did not lead to increased proceedings).
Here, ELE and its counsel did not unreasonably or vexatiously multiply the proceedings.
Notably, Tower is not complaining about the result of the motion to dismiss (i.e., because it won
the motion) or that Tower had to research and draft an opposition to the motion (i.e., as Tower
does not suggest that ELE was somehow not entitled to move to dismiss the case), so the sole
question at issue in Tower’s motion for sanctions under § 1927 is simple: what costs and fees, if
any, would have been saved if the alleged overstatements and inaccuracies never occurred? As
detailed in Sections A through H below, there is no category of costs or fees that Tower can
contend were the result of Mr. Zhang’s statements about a lack of direct U.S. Sales of LCDI and
GFCI devices or the ambiguities raised by a single customer feedback form as compared with
Mr. Bao’s answers to deposition questions.

Accordingly, ELE did not “multiply the

proceedings,” and Tower’s request for sanctions under § 1927 should be denied.
A.

Jurisdictional Discovery (Generally)

Tower cannot in good faith claim that it should be awarded its costs and fees for
jurisdictional discovery generally. There is no dispute that ELE’s LCDI sales are and have
always been overwhelmingly to Far East manufacturers. The notion that an initial affidavit that
said there were a “handful” of United States sales outside Rhode Island (as opposed to an
affidavit that said there were “no” sales in the United States) would have resulted in any less
jurisdictional discovery is simply not credible.

If anything, Tower’s pattern of aggressive

behavior to date proves that Tower would have by no means simply taken ELE’s word for it -- a
point that Tower even acknowledges in its most recent sanctions motion. See Tower Br. at 17.
Tower apparently ignores that as the plaintiff, it bears the burden of proving the court’s
personal jurisdiction over ELE. See Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 674-75 (1st Cir.

A/72530191.7/3313764-3300207036

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

1992). Here, the statements at issue from the Zhang declaration (i.e., that ELE did not sell
LCDIs to U.S. customers or sell GFCI’s to U.S. customers) were not relevant to the basis on
which the Court found jurisdiction. The basis for jurisdiction was a stream of commerce theory
that ELE sold LCDIs to foreign manufacturers with an inferred knowledge that those products
would end up in Rhode Island. The sale of products outside the United States that ended up in
the United States was never disputed, and Tower had the burden of establishing that inferred
knowledge regarding Rhode Island.

Therefore Tower clearly would have had to conduct

discovery regarding ELE’s sales of its LCDI devices regardless of the overstatements by Mr.
Zhang.
Accordingly, Tower is not entitled to its costs and fees associated with all jurisdictional
discovery.
B.

Opposing ELE’s Motion for Protective Order

Tower cannot in good faith claim that it should be awarded it costs and fees associated
with opposing ELE’s Motion for Protective Order (Docket No. 22). As discussed in detail in that
moving brief, on December 14, 2006, almost a week after Tower propounded its written
discovery requests, Tower faxed a Notice of Deposition pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6). The Notice
of Deposition was limited to a single topic, namely ELE’s “customer support center” in America,
based on a statement on ELE’s website. The Notice of Deposition further stated that the
deposition was to occur in Boston, Massachusetts at Tower’s counsel’s office. In the cover
letter enclosing the Notice of Deposition, Tower stated that it would be “willing to discuss a
mutually convenient U.S. location and date for the deposition.” Believing the deposition notice
to go well beyond the scope of discovery allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ELE
filed the Motion for Protective Order on December 22, 2006.
On January 22, 2007, the Court held a hearing on ELE’s Motion for a Protective Order.
Notably, once Tower’s counsel was given an opportunity to speak, in response to the Court’s
suggestion that the deposition occur in China, Tower’s counsel quickly offered to conduct the
deposition in China and informed the Court of his law firm’s two facilities in China. On

A/72530191.7/3313764-3300207036

17

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

Document 102

Filed 05/16/2008

Page 19 of 24

February 5, 2007, the Court entered an Order, which was drafted by Tower, denying ELE’s
Motion for a Protective Order and authorizing Tower to conduct a deposition of ELE’s witness
“at a mutually convenient time and place in the People’s Republic of China, in a location as close
as practicable to Shanghai.” See February 5, 2007 Order (Docket No. 40) (the “February 5
Order”).
Given that the Court agreed with ELE that the deposition should not proceed in Boston, it
clearly was not bad faith for ELE to file its Motion for Protective Order, and therefore, Tower
should not be awarded any fees in connection with this motion.
C.

Moving to Compel Discovery against ELE

Tower cannot in good faith claim that it should be awarded it costs and fees associated
with moving to compel discovery against ELE (Docket No. 27). On January 8, 2007, while
ELE’s Motion for Protective Order was pending, Tower filed a Motion to Compel discovery,
specifically seeking further responses from ELE in response to Tower’s First Set of
Interrogatories and First Request for Production of Documents. On March 16, 2007, the Court
issued an Order concerning Tower’s Motions to Compel discovery. Notably, the Court denied in
part Tower’s motion and painstakingly rewrote most of Tower’s interrogatories and requests for
production to limit their scope. See March 16 Order Granting In Part Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Discovery (Docket No. 49) (the “March 16 Discovery Order”) (modifying Interrogatory
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and Request for Production Nos. 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12). The Court outright granted
Tower’s request with respect to only Interrogatory No. 3 and Request for Production No. 5, and
the Court outright denied Tower’s request with respect to Interrogatory No. 7 and held that to
extent the ruling did not grant the motion, the motion was deemed denied.
Accordingly, in view of the Court’s denials of Tower’s Motion to Compel in many
respects and rewriting of Tower’s discovery requests in other respects, ELE plainly was justified
in objecting to Tower’s discovery as written, which necessitated Tower’s Motion to Compel
Discovery. As such, Tower should not be awarded any fees in connection with this motion.

Moving to Compel Compliance Concerning the Deposition in
China

Tower cannot in good faith claim that it should be awarded it costs and fees associated
with moving to compel compliance with the Court’s February 5 Order (Docket No. 44). After
the hearing on the Motion for Protective Order, and after the Court entered the February 5 Order
(which was drafted by Tower), Tower determined that Chinese law did not permit deposition of
Chinese citizens in Beijing or other places on the mainland of China, and therefore filed another
Motion to Compel, this time seeking to have the 30(b)(6) deposition be taken in Hong Kong.
Although Tower titled its motion a “Motion to Compel Compliance with the Court’s February 5,
2007 Order,” the Motion really sought to modify the Court’s Order.
While the Court ultimately granted Tower’s Motion to Compel Compliance with the
February 5 Order and instructed that ELE have its Rule 30(b)(6) representative apply for
permission to travel to Hong Kong for the purpose of being deposed in that city (See March 16,
2007 Order Granting Motion to Compel Compliance (Docket No. 50) (the “March 16
Compliance Order”)), the Court did not suggest that ELE had any bad faith in not obtaining
permits to travel to Hong Kong until after the Court ordered it to so travel. Accordingly, Tower
should not be awarded any fees in connection with this motion.
E.

Moving for Sanctions (I)

Tower cannot in good faith claim that it should be awarded it costs and fees associated
with filing its first motion for sanctions (Docket No. 56). On June 6, 2007, Tower filed a motion
for sanctions against ELE. In that motion, Tower complained about numerous issues, all falling
into three broad categories of conduct: (1) ELE’s conduct relating to the deposition of ELE’s
30(b)(6) witness; (2) ELE’s responses to Tower’s First Set of Interrogatories and First Request
for Production of Documents; and (3) Tower’s need to take, and ELE’s “involvement” in, thirdparty discovery.
After full briefing by both parties and oral argument, on August 10, 2007, the Court
issued an Order denying all but one small piece of what was requested in Tower’s first Motion
for Sanctions (the “Sanctions Order”).

A/72530191.7/3313764-3300207036

Specifically, the Court denied Tower’s request for

19

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

Document 102

Filed 05/16/2008

Page 21 of 24

sanctions with respect to (1) ELE filing its motion for protective order, (2) ELE’s unwillingness
to travel to Hong Kong in view of the language of the February 5 Order (which was drafted by
Tower), (3) Tower’s request for sanctions for alleged violations of the March 16 Compliance
Order, (4) ELE’s discovery responses, and (5) Towers need to take, and ELE’s involvement
with, third party discovery. The only conduct for which ELE was sanctioned was with respect to
conduct during the 30(b)(6) deposition, for which the Court ordered ELE to pay Tower one-half
of the cost of the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, including one-half of the attorney’s fees which were
attributed to the services of Attorney John S. Cotter during that deposition. In addition, the
Court granted Tower permission to take a further deposition of Mr. Bao, but the deposition was
to be by written questions pursuant to Rule 31(a) and limited to the same two matters which the
Court previously authorized. ELE was ordered to pay Tower’s attorney’s fees for preparing the
questions up to a maximum of three hours time for one attorney.
The many issues that Tower already raised in its first motion for sanctions (including
conduct during 30(b)(6) deposition, ELE responses to discovery requests, and Tower’s third
party discovery) have been vetted by the Court and should not be revisited on this second motion
for sanctions.
F.

Preparing Written Deposition Questions

Tower cannot in good faith claim that it should be awarded further costs and fees
associated with preparing the written deposition questions. On September 10, 2007, Tower
served a Notice of Taking Rule 31 Deposition Upon Written Questions (the “Notice”). The
Notice included 141 questions and four deposition exhibits (with accompanying Chinese
translations) and provided that the deposition upon written questions of Mr. Bao would be taken
before an available court reporter at the offices of Tower’s counsel in Hong Kong.6 On October
10, 2007, ELE served its answers to the 141 written deposition questions.

6

On September 11, 2007, Tower sent a follow up letter stating that the Order required Mr. Bao to return to Hong
Kong to answer the written deposition questions. In view of Tower’s unreasonable interpretation of the Sanctions
Order, ELE was forced to move the Court for clarification that the Sanctions Order did not require Mr. Bao to return

(Footnote Continued on Next Page.)

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

Document 102

Filed 05/16/2008

Page 22 of 24

The written deposition questions, which were the result of the first motion for sanctions,
have already been accounted for and therefore are not properly subject to this Motion for
Sanctions.
G.

Translating ELE Documents

To extent Tower suggests that ELE should be sanctioned for producing documents in
Chinese and that Tower was burdened by translating the documents, Tower is grossly misplaced.
Case law clearly establishes that translation of documents is the requesting party’s obligation.
See In re Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, 687 F.2d 501, 509 (1st Cir.1982) (holding that
party cannot impose the cost of translating documents that exist in a foreign language on the
producing party); East Boston Ecumenical Community Council, Inc. v. Mastrorillo, 124 F.R.D.
14, 15 (D. Mass. 1989) (holding that the party seeking depositions bear the cost of interpreters
for the deponents).
The production of documents from a Chinese company in its native language of Chinese
is plainly not deceptive or sanctionable.
H.

Third Party Discovery

To the extent that Tower asserts that ELE unreasonably caused Tower to incur the
expense of third party discovery in this action and suggests that ELE’s alleged non-compliance
with orders of this Court caused that expense, those issues have been vetted by the Court in
Tower’s first motion for sanctions and should not be revisited on this motion for sanctions.
In the end, there are no categories of costs and fees that Tower expended as a result of the
overstatements by Mr. Zhang and inaccuracies in Mr. Bao’s answers to written deposition
questions. The Court has already admonished ELE, and ELE respects that admonishment and

(Footnote Continued from Previous Page.)
to Hong Kong to answer the written deposition questions. On September 18, 2007 -- before Tower had even
opposed the Motion for Clarification -- the Court granted ELE’s Motion for Clarification and confirmed that Mr.
Bao did not have to return to Hong Kong to answer the questions. See Order Granting Emergency Motion for
Clarification (Docket No. 73).

does not take it lightly. While ELE recognizes that it should have been more careful in the initial
declaration of Mr. Zhang and statements made subsequently thereto -- and will endeavor to
check and double check the accuracy of its statements going forward -- the conduct about which
Tower complains simply does not warrant sanctions.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, it is respectfully submitted that Tower’s Motion for
Sanctions should be denied.
