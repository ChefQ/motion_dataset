As Tower acknowledges in its reply brief, “what Shanghai ELE has done and how that
affected this case are already of record.” Reply Br. at 1. ELE has explained the circumstances
surrounding the three statements in the first Zhang affidavit overlooking a handful of sales directly
to the United States; that Tower was not prejudiced by, and did not expend any additional money
because of, these statements; and that, while it made this mistake in good faith and without the
intent to deceive, ELE deeply regrets that it ever occurred. If the Court finds based on these facts
that the stern admonishment that it included in its opinion on the Motion to Dismiss was
insufficient, so be it. ELE, however, does not believe further sanctions are warranted, and believes
instead that the parties should focus on resolving this case on the merits. Indeed, if anything, the
misleading and exaggerated arguments set forth in Tower’s reply brief further highlight why
sanctions should not be awarded.
I.

THE COURT MAY CONSIDER THE DALTON DECLARATION
Tower’s assertion that the Declaration of Joshua Dalton (“Dalton Decl.”) should be excluded

from consideration under Fed. R. Evid. 408(a) is baseless. See Reply Br. at 1, n.1. Tower cites no
case law for its position. Rather, Tower conclusorily contends that because the declaration “raise[s]
settlement discussions” concerning the parties’ efforts to resolve Tower’s various motions for
sanctions, Rule 408(a) somehow automatically requires that the Court ignore the entire declaration.
Rule 408(a) is not so inflexible.
Rule 408 is limited in application, providing only that evidence of a settlement is not
admissible “to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity
or amount.” Fed. R. Evid. 408(a).1 “Rule 408 is not an absolute ban on all evidence regarding
settlement negotiations. The rule permits evidence that is otherwise discoverable or that is offered
for a purpose other than establishing liability.” Bankcard America, Inc. v. Universal Bancard
Systems, Inc., 203 F.3d 477, 484 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 877 (2000).
Here, the Dalton Declaration was not offered to establish liability and as such should not be
1

The Rule does “not require exclusion if the evidence is offered for [another] purpose[, such as] proving a witness’s
bias or prejudice; negating a contention of undue delay; [or] proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or
prosecution.” Fed. R. Evid. 408(b).

excluded. As an initial matter, the declaration contains a number of strictly factual statements
having nothing to do with the back and forth of negotiation.2 Such statements of fact are expressly
permitted under Rule 408(a) and may be considered by the Court. Further, statements actually
concerning the parties’ settlement discussions are likewise permissible under Rule 408 because they
were offered only to show ELE’s good faith attempts to resolve such matters and not to establish the
validity or invalidity of the underlying claim.3 “[T]he prevailing view appears to be that Rule 408
does not bar an offeror from introducing evidence of his own offers,” and therefore ELE should be
permitted to present such evidence to the Court. Innovative Engineering & Consulting Corp. v.
Hurley & Associates, Inc., 2006 WL 2806387, *9 (N.D. Ohio, Sept. 28, 2006). Accordingly, the
Dalton Declaration may be considered by the Court.
II.

ELE CANNOT BE SANCTIONED FOR PROPERLY CITING FIRST CIRCUIT
LAW REGARDING THE STREAM OF COMMERCE THEORY
Despite ELE’s explanation both at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and again in its

opposition brief to the present motion for why ELE cited First Circuit law in connection with its
stream of commerce arguments on the Motion to Dismiss, Tower continues to assert that ELE
should somehow be sanctioned for citing First Circuit cases and for not citing Beverly Hills Fan Co.
v. Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The assertion is meritless.
To start, ELE’s moving brief cited several Federal Circuit cases --post Beverly Hills Fan -including several cases citing Beverly Hills Fan for the proposition (expressly acknowledged in
ELE’s moving brief) that Federal Circuit law applies on the Motion to Dismiss. See ELE Brief in
Support of Motion to Dismiss at 5-6 (acknowledging that “[e]xercise of personal jurisdiction in
2

For example, Mr. Dalton’s statements of fact, including (1) that Tower did not confer with ELE before filing its
Motion for Sanctions (Dalton Decl. ¶ 2), (2) that during the Rule 26(f) conference ELE raised the issue of Tower’s
Motion for Sanctions (Id. at ¶ 3), (3) that Tower indicated that it was seeking $315,000 on the Motion for Sanctions and
that the $315,000 amount did not include Tower’s costs and fees associated with researching and drafting its opposition
to ELE’s Motion to Dismiss (Id. at ¶ 4), (4) that ELE has not spent over $300,000 on its entire case (compared to
Tower’s claim that it has spent over $300,000 on jurisdictional discovery alone) (Id. at ¶ 5), and (5) that Tower never
provided a breakdown of its fees as requested by ELE (Id. at ¶¶ 9-10), were all plainly submitted for purposes other than
“to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim.”
3

The only statements concerning settlement discussions in the declaration are (1) ELE offered to settle the motion for
$30,000 (Dalton Decl. ¶ 7), (2) Tower’s statement that it would not discuss settlement unless ELE started negotiations
at “six figures” (Id. at ¶ 8), and (3) Tower’s statement that it was willing to settle for the low “$200,000s” (Id. at ¶ 11).

patent infringement cases is governed by Federal Circuit law” and citing, inter alia, post-Beverly
Hills Fan cases Red Wing Shoe Co., Inc. v. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc., 148 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir.
1998), LSI Indus. Inc. v. Hubbell Lighting, Inc., 232 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000), Akro Corp. v.
Luker, 45 F.3d 1541 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). The suggestion that one particular case had to be cited rather
than a number of more recent Federal Circuit cases citing Beverly Hills Fan and the underlying U.S.
Supreme Court precedent on personal jurisdiction is ludicrous.

Beverly Hills Fan was not

“controlling authority:” it simply stands for the proposition that the Federal Circuit recognizes the
Supreme Court’s stream of commerce analysis established in Asahi Metal Industries Co. v. Superior
Court of California, 480 U.S. 102 (1987). Setting forth the proper standards for the Court to apply
is not sanctionable conduct, and it is frankly inappropriate for Tower to continue to assert that it is.
Far more troubling, however, is Tower’s demand for sanctions for ELE’s citation to First
Circuit precedent when -- as the court in one of the cases specifically mentioned in Tower’s reply
brief confirmed -- that was precisely the right thing to do given the outcome in Beverly Hills Fan.
Since the Federal Circuit has refused to take a position as to which view from Asahi (Justice
O’Connor or Justice Brennan) it considered controlling, it was entirely proper for ELE to cite First
Circuit law in connection with its stream of commerce arguments. Incredibly, Tower cites to the
docket from Jacobs Chuck Mfg. Co. v. Shandong Weida Mach. Co. Ltd., C.A. No. 05-185 (E.D.
Tex.) in its reply brief. Had Tower pulled the pleadings from the docket, it would have learned that
the Jacobs Court’s decision on defendant’s motion to dismiss directly contradicts Tower’s
arguments that ELE should be sanctioned for citing First Circuit law.
In Jacobs, the defendant moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. As in this case,
the defendant set forth the proper Supreme Court jurisdictional standards (as adopted by the Federal
Circuit) and then applied Fifth Circuit cases on the stream of commerce question.4 In its order
denying the motion, the Court succinctly explained why Fifth Circuit law was directly applicable
and effectively explained why Beverly Hills Fan was not controlling:
4

Notably, the defendant did not cite Beverly Hills Fan in its moving brief. The plaintiff then opposed, citing Beverly
Hills Fan. Ultimately, the Court issued its Order denying the motion to dismiss. Nowhere was it suggested that the
defendant should have been sanctioned for failing to cite Beverly Hills Fan or for citing Fifth Circuit cases.

The Federal Circuit adopted and applied the stream of commerce theory in Beverly
Hills Fan Co., 21 F.3d at 1566. However, with respect to deciding whether to apply
the O’Conner [sic] or Brennan version of the stream of commerce theory, the Federal
Circuit declined to choose and stated: “We need not join this debate here, since we
find that, under either version of the stream of commerce theory, plaintiff made the
required jurisdictional showing.” Id. The Fifth Circuit, on the other hand, follows
the pre-Asahi cases which apply the standard stream of commerce theory. … In the
absence of Federal Circuit guidance, this Court must follow Fifth Circuit
precedent. Panduit Corp., 744 F.2d at 1574-75.
Jacobs Chuck Mfg., 2005 WL 3299718 at *3 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).
As explained in the Jacobs decision -- a decision that Tower was plainly aware of -- the
local Circuit’s law must be applied given the Federal Circuit’s lack of guidance on the Asahi stream
of commerce question.

Accordingly, ELE cannot be sanctioned for citing First Circuit law

regarding stream of commerce.
III.

TOWER’S EFFORTS TO TWIST AND MISSTATE THE FACTS
SHOULD NO LONGER BE TOLERATED
Continuing an ironic trend from its Motion for Sanctions, Tower’s reply brief again

repeatedly misstates and exaggerates facts at the same time Tower is asking this Court to exercise
its inherent power to level a (possibly record-setting) sanction for hundreds of thousands of dollars
against ELE for supposedly misstating and exaggerating facts. For example:
Claim: “[T]he statement that ELE never directly sold any products in the United States was
the central fact supporting ELE’s motion to dismiss.” Reply Br. at 3.
THE TRUTH: The central fact supporting ELE’s Motion to Dismiss was that ELE had no
direct contact with Rhode Island. The minimal direct sales to two or three states -none of them being Rhode Island -- that were learned during discovery was not a
central fact relied upon in the Court’s Order denying the Motion to Dismiss.
Claim: “Mr. Zhang’s [second declaration] is not credible given that before he gave his first
declaration, Shanghai ELE had designed its LCDI for U.S. Standards, and had very
publicly marketed LCDIs to the U.S. via its website.” Reply Br. at 4.
THE TRUTH: Mr. Zhang’s second affidavit merely confirms that he was not aware of any
sales directly to the United States when he signed his first affidavit. ELE never
denied that it designed its LCDIs to comply with U.S. Standards, that it had an
English language website, or that its LCDIs were sold indirectly in the United States.
Claim: “Contrary to ELE’s claim that these issues and the other raised in this Motion have
already been considered in Tower’s prior sanctions motion, the prior motion
concerned ELE’s failure to comply with discovery orders … “Reply Br. at 5.

Case 1:06-cv-00170-S-DLM

THE TRUTH: ELE never made this claim. Rather, ELE stated that “the vast majority” of
issues in the second motion were addressed in Tower’s first motion for sanctions and
that “all” of the issues in Tower’s second motion for sanctions were “raised by
Tower in previous filings” (i.e., filings other than the first motion for sanctions).
ELE Opp. Br. at 1 (emphasis added).
Claim: “Public information showed the key facts that ELE’s LCDI was UL registered, that
ELE’s LCDIs were located in Rhode Island and across the Country, that ELE
marketed to the U.S. market via its website, that ELE sought U.S. patent protection
for its LCDIs, and that ELE produced LCDIs with English language warning and
identifiers, all independent of discovery from ELE or third parties. … Discovery
from third parties was needed specifically because ELE’s Motion to Dismiss
challenged Tower’s jurisdictional allegation by misleading Tower and the Court
about the existence of Shanghai ELE sales directed to the U.S. and Rhode Island.”
Reply Br. at 8-9.
THE TRUTH: ELE never denied any of this “public information.” However, Tower
understood that it likely had to establish the “something more” prong from Justice
O’Connor’s “purposeful availment” test in Asahi. Jurisdictional discovery was
therefore “needed specifically” for Tower to establish that “something more.” As
noted in ELE’s opposition, had the first Zhang declaration mentioned a handful of
direct sales to two non-Rhode Island states from the beginning, Tower would still
have needed discovery to try and show “an action of the defendant purposefully
directed toward the forum State.” Asahi at 112 (emphasis added). The first Zhang
affidavit, then, did not cause Tower to conduct any more discovery than it needed to
conduct.
While some of Tower’s exaggerations or misstatements of law and fact might normally be
dismissed as inadvertent, when taken in the context of Tower seeking hundreds of thousands of
dollars in sanctions for innocent mistakes by ELE, Tower’s conduct may not merit such leniency.
One must ask, at what point do Tower’s own misstatements and exaggerations under the same level
of scrutiny Tower wishes to apply to ELE rise to the level of Tower itself being sanctioned?
CONCLUSION
Ultimately, as stated in ELE’s opposition to this motion, every statement made by ELE to
this Court was believed to be true at the time it was made, and ELE’s representatives regret that a
handful of them turned out in hindsight to be anything less than 100% accurate. ELE has taken this
situation to heart, and intends to be even more careful, precise, and diligent going forward. ELE
respectfully suggests that this Court’s stern admonishment to ELE is a sufficient sanction, that
Tower’s Motion for Sanctions should be denied, and that the parties should now move on to the
merits of this case.
