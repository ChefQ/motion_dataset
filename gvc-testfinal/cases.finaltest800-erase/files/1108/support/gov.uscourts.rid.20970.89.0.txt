UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

TOWER MANUFACTURING CORPORATION,
Plaintiff,
v.

Civil Action No. 06-170S

SHANGHAI ELE MANUFACTURING
CORPORATION,
Defendant.

TOWER’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO
28 U.S.C. § 1927, RULE 26(G) AND THE COURT’S INHERENT POWER

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927, Rule 26(g) and the Court’s
inherent power, Tower moves for sanctions against Shanghai ELE.
Shanghai ELE’s various misstatements throughout the course of
its Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 13) have unreasonably and
vexatiously multiplied this litigation for the reasons cited in
the accompanying memorandum.
Tower requests that this Court award attorneys’ fees and
costs incurred by Tower in proving the falsity of Shanghai ELE’s
misstatements, and any other appropriate relief.
