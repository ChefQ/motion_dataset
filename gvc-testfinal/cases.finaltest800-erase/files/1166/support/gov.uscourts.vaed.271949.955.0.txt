UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
NORFOLK DIVISION
I/P ENGINE, INC.

Plaintiff,

v.
AOL, INC., et al.,

Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-512
Defendants.

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL EVIDENCE
Good cause supports Defendants’ motion pursuant to Local Rule 7(f)(1) for an order
granting leave to file “Defendants’ Notice of Supplemental Evidence.” The Notice identifies
new evidence that was not available when Defendants filed their opposition to I/P Engine’s
motion for post-judgment royalties on May 13, 2013. As described in the Notice of
Supplemental Evidence, that evidence is a May 30, 2013 SEC filing by I/P Engine’s parent
corporation, Vringo, describing a recent license agreement entered into for the patents-in-suit,
settling a case I/P Engine filed on January 31, 2013, in the Southern District of New York,
asserting infringement of the same patents at issue in this case against Microsoft. This license
agreement is relevant to I/P Engine’s pending motion for post-judgment royalties. See
Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Maersk Drilling USA, Inc., 699 F.3d 1340,
1357-59 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (patentee’s licensing practices are relevant to determining form of
agreement that would result from hypothetical negotiation). Because this evidence is relevant
and was not available when Defendants filed their opposition to I/P Engine’s motion for postjudgment royalties, there is good cause for this Motion for Leave.
