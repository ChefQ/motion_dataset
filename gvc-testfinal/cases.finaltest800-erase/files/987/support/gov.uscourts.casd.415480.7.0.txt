Case 3:13-cv-01238-CAB-BLM Document 7 Filed 09/10/13 Page 4 of 14

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

BACKGROUND

This action arises from the alleged distribution of allegedly pornographic
photographs of the Plaintiff taken when she was under the age of eighteen. The
Plaintiff contends that the Chanson Defendants, along with the other defendants,
distributed allegedly lewd and lascivious images of the Plaintiff through a website.
However, the Plaintiff does not and cannot ascertain that the Chanson Defendants |
are in any way associated with the website on which the photographs allegedly

appeared. All the Plaintiff's allegations against the Chanson Defendants are "upon

| information and belief." See Complaint { 15 - 20. Additionally, neither of the

Chanson Defendants resides in the state of California. See Declaration of Roy E.
Chanson ("Roy Decl.") {1 and Declaration of Amy L. Chanson ("Amy Decl.") qi.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The Chanson Defendants move this Court to dismiss this case under Rule
12(b)(2) (lack of personal jurisdiction). When a defendant moves to dismiss under
Fed. R. Civ. P.12(b)(2), the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court
may properly exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Pebble Beach Co.
v. Caddy, 453 F.3d 1151, 1154 (9th Cir. 2006); Bohara v. Backus Hosp. Medical
Benefit Plan, 390 F.Supp.2d 957, 961 (C.D. Cal. 2005); Schwarzenegger v. Fred

Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 800 (9th Cir. 2004). Absent formal discovery or an

evidentiary hearing, plaintiff need make only a prima facie showing that jurisdiction
exists to survive a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss. Pebble Beach, 453 F.3d at
1154; Rio Properties, Inc. v. Rio Int'l Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1019 (9th Cir. 2002).
However, the Plaintiff must bear this burden for each of the defendants individually
and it is not enough to meet the burden for any one of the defendants only. See
Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 790, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984) ("Each
defendant's contacts with the forum State must be assessed individually").

Uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken as true. AT&T v.
Compagnie Bruxelles Lambert, 94 F 3d 586, 588 (9th Cir.1996). However, the court
may not assume the truth of such allegations if they are contradicted by affidavit or
discovery materials. Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Associates, Inc., 557
F.2d 1280, 1284 (9th Cir.1977).

ARGUMENT

Where no applicable federal statute indicates otherwise, a district court
has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the extent that the law
of the forum state constitutionally provides. See Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Tech.
Assoc., Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1286 (9th Cir.1977). California law permits courts to
exercise jurisdiction to the full extent authorized by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Cal. Civ.Proc. Code

0x00A7 410.10; Data Disc, 557 F.2d at 1286 n. 3. The Due Process Clause, in turn, has

been interpreted to authorize the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident

defendant if that defendant has "minimum contacts" with the forum state such

. |that maintenance of the suit "does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and

substantial justice." See International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S.
310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) (citation omitted); see also Data Disc,
557 F.2d at 1287.

"Where, as here, no federal statute authorizes personal jurisdiction, the
district court applies the law of the state in which the court sits." Mavrix Photo,
Inc. v. Brand Techs., Inc., 647 F.3d 1218, 1223 (9th Cir. 2011). California's long-
arm statute has the same due process requirements as the federal long-arm statute.
Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 801 (9th Cir.2004).
Under California's long-arm statute, federal courts sitting in California may exercise
personal jurisdiction over any non-resident to the extent permitted by the Due
Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Cal. Code Civ. P. 0x00A7 410.10; Core-
Vent v. Nobel Industries AB, 11 F.3d 1482, 1484 (9th Cir. 1993). Accordingly,
the "general rule is that personal jurisdiction over a defendant is proper if it is
permitted by a long-arm statute and if the exercise of that jurisdiction does not
violate federal due process." Pebble Beach, 453 F.3d at 1154-55 (citing Fireman's

Fund Ins. Co. v. Nat. Bank of Coops., 103 F.3d 888, 893 (9th Cir.1996)).

Case 3:13-cv-01238-CAB-BLM Document 7 Filed 09/10/13 Page 7 of 14

The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause permits courts to exercise
personal jurisdiction over any defendant who has sufficient "minimum contacts"
with the forum that the "maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions
of fair play and substantial justice." Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310
(1945).

The Chanson Defendants are out-of-state defendants and the Plaintiff has
failed to show in her Complaint that the Chanson Defendants are amenable to suit
in this district. Personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the forum state can be
either "general" or "specific." If the nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum
state are "substantial" or "continuous and systematic," the defendant is subject.
to "general jurisdiction" in the forum state even if the cause of action is unrelated to
the defendant's activities within the state. See Helicpteros Nacionales de Colombia,
S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984); Data Disc,
557 F.2d at 1287. Where the defendant's activities within the forum are not so
pervasive as to subject it to general jurisdiction, the defendant still may be subject to
specific jurisdiction depending upon the nature and quality of its contacts in relation
to the cause of action. See Data Disc, 557 F.2d at 1287. Under either theory, the
Plaintiff bears the burden of proof on the jurisdictional facts. Rio Properties, Inc. v.

Rio Intl Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1019 (9th Cir. 2002).

Before the Court can exercise general jurisdiction over the Chanson
Defendants, Plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to denionstrate that each of the
Chanson Defendants have "continuous and systematic business contacts" with the
forum state, such that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable and just. Helicopteros
Nacionales, 466 U.S. at 415. This "minimum contacts" standard for establishing
general jurisdiction is high, requiring that Defendants' contacts approximate physical
presence in the forum state. Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta National Inc.,

223 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 2000). "This is an exacting standard, as it should
be, because a finding of general jurisdiction permits a defendant to be hauled into
court in the forum state to answer for any of its activities anywhere in the world."
Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 801 (citation omitted). Plaintiff fails to meet this
pleading standard. Plaintiff has not satisfied the "exacting" standard necessary to
establish general jurisdiction.

The Plaintiff has not shown or even alleged that the Chanson Defendants
have extensive in-state contacts with California or that they conduct any activities
within the state - let alone substantial and continuous activities. Pebble Beach Co.

v. Caddy, 453 F.3d 1151, 1154 (9th Cir. 2006) ("the plaintiff bears the burden of
demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant."). Plaintiff has
not met her burden and this Court has no general in personam jurisdiction over the

Chanson Defendants.

Case 3:13-cv-01238-CAB-BLM Document 7 Filed 09/10/13 Page 9 of 14

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applies a three-part test to
determine if a defendant's contacts are sufficiently related to the forum state to
permit a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a defendant: 1) the nonresident
defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction within the forum or
perform some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege
of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protection of
its laws; 2) the claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant's
forum-related activities; and 3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable. See
Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta National Inc., 223 F.3d 1082 (9th Cir.2000);
Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1320 (9th Cir.1998); Cybersell,
Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d 414, 416 (9th Cir.1997); Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d
at 802. "If any of the three requirements is not satisfied, jurisdiction in the forum
would deprive the defendant of due process of law." Omeluk v. Langsten Slip &
Batbyggeri A/S, 52 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir.1995).

The Plaintiff here fails to set forth any legal or factual basis that supports a
minimal prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over the Chanson Defendants.
There is nothing before the Court which shows the purposeful availment of these
two defendants with this forum or which shows that any of the specifically alleged
conduct of these two defendants arose out of any contact with California, had any

consequence within California, or was sufficient to make the exercise of personal

. jurisdiction over these two defendants reasonable. The Plaintiff does not allege that

the Chanson Defendants have taken any specific action in the state of California and
the Plaintiff does not allege that the Chanson Defendants have ever been in the state
of California.

Minimum contacts may be established through a defendant's purposeful
availment of the benefits and protections of California's laws. Asahi Metal Indus.
Co. v. Superior Court of California, 480 U.S. 102, 109, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d
92 (1987), or the effects test, which looks at whether the harm allegedly caused by
the Chanson Defendants, if any, is intentional and aimed at California, Calder v.
Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 788-790, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984); Core Vent
Corp. v. Nobel Indus. AB, 11 F.3d 1482, 1485-86 (9th Cir. 1993); Rio Properties,
Inc. v. Rio Intern. Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1019-1020 (9th Cir. 2002).

Here, the Chanson Defendants had nothing to do with the website in question
or the business activities of any of the other defendants in this action. See Roy Decl.
qf 6-17 and Amy Decl. ff 6-17. The Plaintiff's self-serving statements that the
Chanson Defendants "actively participate[], and materially assist[] Eric S. Chanson,
in operating websites on the World Wide Web" are insufficient to establish the
Chanson Defendants association with the website in question in this action.
Complaint 0x00A7 3-4. The Plaintiff jumps from an allegation that "upon information and

belief, Roy E. Chanson supervised, assisted, and participated in formatting and
