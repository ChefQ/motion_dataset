MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

Plaintiff Abigail Talley (“Abbey”), through her mother, Elizabeth Talley,

3

hereby files this Opposition to Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson’s Motion to

4

Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), based on the following:

5
6

I.
INTRODUCTION
This is a child pornography case. The victim is a California resident (as are

7

many other victims of the Defendants’ “revenge porn” website).1 The perpetrators

8

are spread across multiple states, but aimed their relevant tortious conduct at a

9

child who lives in California, who felt all of the harm in California, who suffered

10

here and has a right to seek redress in California. Some of the defendants in this

11

scheme, including those that filed the instant Motion to Dismiss, demand that the

12

victim travel to them in order to seek redress.

13

conspiracy are scattered about the country, from Arizona to Illinois to New Jersey,

14

with the only established focal point of California—where the Defendants

15

designated a Digital Millennium Copyright Act agent, where Defendants listed

16

their address in registering the website, where Defendants listed their trademark

17

registration, and where Defendants have targeted and solicited their business.

18

Accordingly, the Chansons argue that the proper course of conduct for their victim

19

would be to file lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions, where it would be more

20

convenient and comfortable for the child pornographers. While the Chansons may

21

find it inconvenient to be held accountable for their actions in California, they

22

well knew that they were victimizing California residents and causing harm in the

23

Golden State. In this contest of “who should be inconvenienced?”, the choice is

24

between a child and child pornographers. The choice is clear.

II.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2

On May 28, 2013, Plaintiff Abbey filed a Complaint alleging multiple

3

violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2251, et seq., and Cal. Civ. Code § 3344, pertaining to

4

the sexual exploitation of children and related violations of California law against

5

the named Defendants. Defendants Kevin Bollaert, Eric S. Chanson, Roy E.

6

Chanson, Amy L. Chanson, and Blue Mist Media, are jointly, severally, and in

7

concert with one another, and are engaged in the commercial distribution of child

8

pornography. See Complaint, ECF #1-1 at 2. Defendants conduct their enterprise

9

electronically, using computer servers and equipment across the country.

10

Defendants monetize their sites through advertising revenue and other currently

11

unverified sources of income.2

12

In addition to posting the photos online, Defendants also engage in a form

13

of stalking. They identify the subjects of the photos by their full names, their

14

hometowns, and link to their personal Facebook pages. See Complaint, ECF #1-1

15

at 2. This compounds the injury for each victim, because Defendants specifically

16

target each person, with precision focus, and ensure that the brunt of the harm

17

takes place right smack dab on their front doorstep. Visitors to Defendants’

18

website search for victims’ photographs by clicking on a link for the

19

corresponding state of residence. Those who wish to submit photos to the website

20

must fill out a form containing the identifying information of the victim. The

21

identifying information, such as name, location, and Facebook page are required

22

prior to the photos being posted, encouraging the outing and ongoing harassment

23

of the victims and rejecting anonymous photographs. Id.

24

Defendants purposefully directed their activities at this particular child,

25

with the precise knowledge that she lived in California, and with the precise

This likely includes a scheme where Defendants are the sole providers of image removal services
for their website, wherein they will remove the names and nude images of individuals from their
website who choose to pay a substantial fee. The site, called “Changemyreputation.com” is suspected
to be owned by the Chansons, and this fact will be explored in discovery.

in partnership with the other Defendants, directed tortious activities at the State of

11

California with actual knowledge that Plaintiff (and frankly all of the Defendant

enterprise’s California victims) would feel injury there, this Court should exercise

personal jurisdiction over them.

III. LEGAL ARGUMENT
This Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants Roy and

16

Amy Chanson. When faced with a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P.

17

12(b)(2), a plaintiff “need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts”

18

to defeat the motion. Brayton Purcell LLP v. Recordon & Recordon, 660 F.3d

19

1124, 1127 (9th Cir. 2010); Rio Props., Inc. v. Rio Int’l Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007,

20

1019 (9th Cir. 2002). Uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken

21

as true, and “conflicts between the facts contained in the parties’ affidavits must

22

be resolved in [plaintiff’s] favor.” Rio Props, 284 F. 3d at 1019. In sum, all

23

disputed facts are resolved in plaintiff’s favor. CYBERsitter, LLC v. P.R.C., 805 F.

24

Supp. 958, 967 (C.D. Cal. 2011), quoting Pebble Beach Co. v. Caddy, 453 F.3d

25

1151, 1154 (9th Cir. 2006).

26

Courts evaluate the propriety of personal jurisdiction over a non-resident

27

defendant based on whether such an exercise of jurisdiction satisfies the

1

“requirements of the applicable state long-arm statute and comports with federal

2

due process.” CYBERsitter, 805 F. Supp. 2d at 967 (internal quotations omitted).

3

California’s long-arm statute provides that jurisdiction is proper “on any basis not

4

inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.” Cal. Code

5

Civ. P. § 410.10.

6

Defendants’ motion to dismiss contends that this Court cannot exercise

7

personal jurisdiction over them because they were not affiliated with the

8

YouGotPosted site and that the site is now shut down. However, they still caused

9

or allowed to cause the tortious actions to occur against Plaintiff while they acted

10

on behalf of their son when the website was live. If it is actually true that Roy and

11

Amy Chanson decided to disassociate themselves from the website after they

12

were sued for their actions, that should not offer them any comfort. If it did, this

13

would provide quite the convenient blueprint for child pornographers – go ahead

14

and publish child porn until you get caught, then after you are sued, just drop the

15

site like a hot potato, act like it never happened, and escape all liability without

16

further ado. That is not the state of the law. Jurisdiction is proper here, whether

17

arising under general or specific jurisdiction.

18

General jurisdiction arises when “the cause of action does not arise out of or

19

relate to the [foreign defendant’s] activities in the forum state.” Helicopteros

20

Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414, 415 n. 9 (1984). In

21

contrast, specific jurisdiction is relevant where the defendant’s contacts with the

22

forum state give rise to the cause of action asserted against him or her.

23

CYBERsitter, 805 F. Supp. 2d at 967.

24

YouGotPosted/UGotPosted has significant contacts with the state so as to

25

approximate a physical presence in California for exercising general jurisdiction.

26

Roy and Amy Chanson’s acts are substantially connected to the forum state, and

27

the Court’s jurisdiction over them would be reasonable; in fact, a contrary result

28

would be most unreasonable.

Case 3:13-cv-01238-CAB-BLM Document 17 Filed 10/29/13 Page 8 of 20

1

In addition, specific jurisdiction is properly exercised because the Chansons

2

purposefully availed themselves by intentionally assisting in victimizing a

3

California child, specifically aiming their tortious acts against Plaintiff in her

4

home state of California, and indeed in her very hometown. The Chansons and

5

other Defendants caused to be published lascivious, sexually explicit photos of

6

Plaintiff, a minor, and went so far as to post the child’s “profile page” that they

7

created for her—to target her, to embarrass her, and to harm her, and to ensure

8

that such harm was visited upon her in the community where she lives. There can

9

be no question that Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson knew that this child lived

10

in California, and no question that they posted her photographs online, knowing

11

that she would feel the brunt of the harm in this state. Their tortious conduct was

12

purposeful and calculated to cause injury in California and thus the Chansons

13

must have reasonably anticipated being haled into a California court.

14
16

This Court may exercise general jurisdiction over Defendants
because YouGotPosted/UGotPosted’s contacts are substantial and
continuous and systematic.
Courts first look to a state’s long-arm statute to determine whether general

17

jurisdiction over a defendant is appropriate. Newport Components, Inc. v. NEC

18

Home Electronics, Inc., 671 F.Supp. 1525, 1533 (9th Cir. 1987). California’s

19

long-arm statute allows for an exercise of jurisdiction over nonresidents on any

20

basis that is not inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution. See Cal. Code Civ. P. §

21

410.10. General jurisdiction requires a defendant to engage in “substantial” or

22

“continuous and systematic” contacts that approximate physical presence.

23

Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 801 (9th Cir. 2004);

24

Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta Nat’l, Inc., 223 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir.

25

2000).

26

systematic, courts examine those activities that impact the state, including whether

27

the defendant solicits or engages in business, serves the state’s markets, or

15

A.

designates an agent for service of process there. Hirsch v. Blue Cross, Blue Shield,

800 F.2d 1474, 1478 (9th Cir. 1986), citing Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 414, World-

3

Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295 (1980); Perkins v.

4

Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 447-49 (1952).

5

The WhoIs information for the YouGotPosted website, trademark

6

application, and DMCA agent notification all clearly point toward a San Diego,

7

California address. See Exhibit A, WhoIs registration for YouGotPosted, Exhibit

8

B, Trademark Registration Application Information for YouGotPosted, and ECF

9

#5-1 at 17, YouGotPosted Terms of Use. Each of these California connections

10

indicates that YouGotPosted and Defendants have a continuous and systematic

11

relationship with the state, as the site’s designated agent is located within

12

California, the website is registered and operated in California, and the owners

13

intend to register a trademark for the website with the same California address.

14

Furthermore, YouGotPosted is a commercial website from which the

15

operators regularly solicit visitors to submit nude photos and from which

16

Defendants gleefully wreak havoc on the lives of men, women, and children

17

nationwide. See “A Victim Speaks: Standing Up to a Revenge Porn Tormentor,”

18

attached as Exhibit C. The menu tags on the right side of the front page feature

19

clickable links to several states, including California, encouraging and targeting

20

those states for submissions. Defendants derive a pecuniary benefit from these

21

photos, including Plaintiff’s, to advertise and promote their services through the

22

site. Through the website, Defendants regularly and persistently solicit business

23

from California residents.

24

Prior to filing any lawsuit against Defendants, an attorney for the law firm

25

now representing Plaintiff Abbey spoke to the Chanson Defendants, including

26

Roy and Amy Chanson. See Declaration of Ronald D. Green (“Decl. of Green”),

27

¶¶4, 16. Roy and Amy Chanson stated that they not only knew about the subject

website, but were actively assisting with its operations and administration. See

2

Decl. of Green, ¶¶12, 15. Specifically, they were editing photographs on the site

3

and altering watermarks from the name of a predecessor website (IsAnyoneUp) to

4

the name of the new website (UGotPosted). Decl. of Green, ¶¶11-13.

5

Based on those admissions, a trademark infringement lawsuit was brought

6

against the Defendants, including Roy and Amy Chanson. Decl. of Green, ¶¶11-

7

13. During the course of settlement negotiations, it was believed that Defendants

8

Roy and Amy Chanson convinced their son Eric Chanson to set aside a settlement

9

agreement he had already executed. Decl. of Green, ¶¶5-7. Based on these pre-

10

existing party admissions, the claims against Roy and Amy Chanson have a basis

11

to be pursued in both fact and law – despite their post hoc rationalizations before

12

this Court. Furthermore, these admissions are enough to show that Defendants

13

Roy and Amy Chanson worked with the other Defendants in operating and

14

running YouGotPosted/UGotPosted, and since the website operated out of

15

California, jurisdiction over them is proper.

16

Thus, based on representations Roy and Amy Chanson made prior to the

17

filing of this suit, the Chanson Defendants’ contacts with the State of California

18

are systematic and continuous enough so as to justify this Court’s general

19

jurisdiction over Roy and Amy Chanson as editors and co-conspirators with the

20

other website Defendants.

21
23

Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson are subject to specific
personal jurisdiction within California.
This Court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over the Chanson

24

Defendants. For specific jurisdiction, the United States Court of Appeals for the

25

Ninth Circuit employs a three-part test: 1) the defendant must purposefully avail

26

himself to acting or causing interference in the forum state; 2) the cause of action

27

must arise from the defendant’s activities in the forum state; and 3) the acts or

28

consequences caused by the defendant must be substantially connected to the

forum state in order to make the exercise of jurisdiction reasonable. Cybersell,

2

Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d 414, 416 (9th Cir. 1997), quoting Ballard v.

3

Savage, 65 F.3d 1495, 1498 (9th Cir. 1995); see also CYBERsitter, 805 F. Supp.

4

2d at 967, citing Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 802.

5

Plaintiff bears the burden in establishing the first two prongs of this test.

6

CYBERsitter, 805 F. Supp. 2d at 967. As to these first two prongs, the Ninth

7

Circuit evaluates purposeful availment using the Calder effects test, a three-part

8

test derived from the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones,

9

465 U.S. 783 (1984). For purposeful direction to exist under this test, the

10

defendant “allegedly must have (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly

11

aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be

12

suffered in the forum state.” Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et

13

L’Antisemitisme, 433 F.3d 1199, 1206 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc).

14

Once these elements are satisfied, as set forth below, Defendants bear the

15

burden of presenting a “compelling case” that this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction

would not be reasonable. Id. Defendants’ motion has not satisfied this burden. As

17

such, the Court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over Defendants Roy

18

and Amy Chanson, and their motion should be denied.

19
21

Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson committed an
intentional act by publishing Plaintiff’s lewd and lascivious
photos on the Internet.

22

Intentional acts such as the Chanson Defendants’ publication of the minor

23

Plaintiff’s photos need not be made with the intent to violate Plaintiff’s rights, but

24

only with an “intent to perform an actual, physical act in the real world.”

25

CYBERsitter, 805 F. Supp. 2d at 969, citing Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 806.

26

However, Defendants’ publication of Plaintiff’s photos in violation of federal and

27

state law is an entirely volitional act. See Rio Props., 284 F.3d at 1020 (finding

28

operation of even a passive website to be an intentional act). Defendants Roy and

Note that Defendants did not merely publish the photos, but solicited them, selected them, published
them, assigned the victim’s name and hometown to them, and placed their own watermark over them.
4
This is an act of unmitigated gall. The Defendants, including Roy and Amy Chanson, do this because
they are concerned that third parties might steal the images and use them on their own websites.
Apparently, thieves themselves, the Defendants do not wish to have other parties steal their ill-gotten
child pornography.

Facebook profiles of the subjects suggests that Defendants wanted no mistake in

2

pinpointing the exact identities of each and every unsuspecting victim whose nude

3

photos was plastered on the Web, including that of Plaintiff Abbey.

4

When Defendants intentionally posted the lascivious child pornographic

5

photos of Plaintiff Abbey, identifying her by her full name, her hometown in

6

California, and a link to her Facebook profile, they did so with full knowledge and

7

the intent that their behavior would specifically harm her right at her front

8

doorstep – in California. Through their actions, Defendants expected that the

9

child’s face and online social networking profiles would be inextricably connected

10

to sexually explicit photos of her, causing shame, embarrassment, and ridicule (or

11

worse) among those who knew her. Under the Calder effects test, Roy and Amy

12

Chanson purposefully availed themselves to jurisdiction in California when they

13

assisted the other Defendants in posting photos to YouGotPosted.

14

Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson materially assisted Defendant Eric

15

Chanson in operating YouGotPosted. See Complaint, ECF # 1-1 at 5-6. Now that

16

they have been sued, Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson deny any involvement

17

with YouGotPosted (see generally, Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson’s Motion

18

to Dismiss, ECF #7). However, when it suited them, they claimed a far more

19

active involvement. Prior to filing any suits against Defendants, an attorney for

20

the one of the law firms representing Plaintiff Abbey spoke to the Defendants in

21

this action, including Roy and Amy Chanson. Roy and Amy Chanson stated

22

explicitly that they not only knew about the website, but actively assisted with its

23

operations and administration. See Decl. of Green, ¶11. Defendants Roy and

24

Amy Chanson are knowing participants in the operation of YouGotPosted, and

25

admitted that they engaged in editing of the photos themselves.

26

California jurisdiction over issues involving YouGotPosted is proper, jurisdiction

27

over Roy and Amy Chanson, as editors of the website, is also proper.

Accordingly, Roy and Amy Chanson, in assisting the owners and operators of

2

YouGotPosted, have purposefully availed themselves to jurisdiction in California.

4

2.

Plaintiff’s causes of action arise from Defendants Roy and
Amy Chanson’s activities directed at California.

5

Knowledge that targets residents of the forum is considered express aiming

6

under the precedent of this circuit. Rio Props., 284 F.3d at 1020 (operating

7

website aimed at Nevada casino deemed express aiming of tortious conduct into

8

Nevada); Bancroft & Masters, Inc. v. Augusta Nat., Inc., 223 F.3d 1082, 1088 (9th

9

Cir. 2000); Panavision Itn’l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1321 (9th Cir.

10

1998). When a defendant individually targets a plaintiff known to be a forum

11

resident, that is enough to show that the defendant’s actions were specifically

12

aimed at a forum. See Brayton Purcell LLP, 606 F.3d at 1129 (9th Cir. 2010);

13

Pebble Beach Co., 453 F.3d at 1156-57 (9th Cir. 2006); Panavision Int’l, 141 F.3d

14

at 1321-22. The facts alleged in the Complaint occurred within the State of

15

California. The child pornographic images of Plaintiff were seen by Plaintiff and

16

known to her while she was a California resident, creating the basis of this

17

litigation. Furthermore, the Defendants categorized the photographs into different

18

states – including California. Defendants knew when posting the photos that

19

Abbey was a California resident, as that information was required in order to post

20

her photos. Therefore, Defendants individually targeted Abbey when posting her

21

photos, along with her full name and hometown, to a page specifically

22

categorizing California residents.

23

Moreover, based on the knowledge that Roy and Amy Chanson had or

24

should have had, they should have anticipated that Plaintiff’s injury would have

25

been within her place of residence – California. Panavision Itn’l, L.P. v. Toeppen,

26

141 F.3d 1316, 1321 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that defendant should have

27

3

4

by operating a passive website).

5

As shown above, Defendants regularly engaged in collecting and soliciting

6

photos from California residents. Defendants, including Roy and Amy Chanson,

7

knew or should have known Abbey lived in California, as they required that

8

information as a condition of distributing Plaintiff’s images. Defendants posted

9

Plaintiff’s photos along with her full name and the California city in which she

10

resides, and associated it with an index term categorizing it with other entries from

11

the state. Based upon Roy and Amy Chanson’s own words and claims, they

12

engaged in editing of the photographs.5

13

Plaintiff Abbey’s causes of action relate directly to Defendants’ acts with

14

California. Therefore, the second factor of the three-part specific jurisdiction

15

analysis is satisfied.

3.

17

This Court may reasonably exercise jurisdiction over
Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson.

18

With Plaintiff satisfying the first two prongs of the Ninth Circuit’s test for

19

specific personal jurisdiction, the burden to show the Court’s exercise of

20

jurisdiction is unreasonable shifts onto Defendants. CYBERsitter, 805 F. Supp. 2d

21

at 967. To meet this burden, Defendants must present a “compelling case” that

22

this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. Id., quoting Burger

Whether Roy and/or Amy Chanson actually edited these particular photographs of this
particular child is unknown before discovery. Nevertheless, their own admissions
support the claim that they are knowing and willful participants in this enterprise, and
they should not be set loose simply because they have raised the uncreative defense of
“we didn’t do it.” When it served them, they claimed to be involved in operations at
Yougotposted/Ugotposted. Decl. of Green, ¶11. Now that they have learned that their
actions may subject them to liability, they claim complete ignorance and uninvolvement.
At the very least, they should submit themselves to discovery.

King Corp. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985). Courts consider seven factors

2

when analyzing whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be reasonable:

3

8

(1) the extent of a defendant‘s purposeful interjection;
(2) the burden on the defendant in defending in the forum;
(3) the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendant‘s state;
(4) the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute;
(5) the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy;
(6) the importance of the forum to the plaintiff‘s interest in convenient and
effective relief; and
(7) the existence of an alternative forum.

9

Id. at 973. As explained below, the balance of these factors weighs in the minor

10

Plaintiff’s favor, and Defendants have not satisfied their burden of presenting a

11

“compelling case” that this Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them

12

would be unreasonable.

4
5
6
7

13

As Defendants have inserted themselves into California, it is reasonable for

14

them to stand suit in connection with those activities. Purposeful interjection is

15

“analogous” to the purposeful direction analysis discussed above. Sinatra v. Nat’l

16

Enquirer, Inc., 854 F.2d 1191, 1199 (9th Cir. 1988); see Corporate Inv. Bus.

17

Brokers v. Melcher, 824 F.2d 786, 790 (9th Cir. 1987) (discussing that the

18

“purposeful injectment” factor receives “no weight once it is shown that the

19

defendant purposefully directed its activities to the forum state”). As this prong

20

has been satisfied above, Roy and Amy Chanson have purposefully interjected

21

their activities into California.

22

exercising personal jurisdiction over Defendants Roy and Amy Chanson.

The weight of this factor favors the Court

23

Because the first two elements of the three-part test are satisfied, there is a

24

presumption that California’s personal jurisdiction over Roy and Amy Chanson is

25

reasonable. However, even if reasonableness were not presumed, Plaintiff can

26

show that jurisdiction is reasonable. Californian after Californian finds herself (or

27

himself) victimized by these Defendants, each of them targeted by name with as

1

much personal information about them as the Defendants can muster.

California’s courts will offer no comfort to the California victims, then who

3

reasonably will? It is in California’s interest to its citizens to protect its minors

4

from sexual exploitation online.

5

posting the graphic lascivious exhibition of her genital or pubic area on their

6

website. Because the child in question is a resident of California, California has a

7

direct interest in the resolution of this Complaint.

If

Defendants exposed Plaintiff, a minor, by

8

Roy and Amy Chanson knew Plaintiff Abbey resided in California because

9

her location was required to post her images. The Defendants’ unlawful

10

commercial child pornography enterprise categorized Plaintiff as a California

11

resident. See ECF # 1-1 at 7 ¶31. Since Defendants knew full well that Plaintiff

12

would be exploited within the forum state when they posted a series of sexually

13

explicit photographs of her on YouGotPosted/UGotPosted, the Court has specific

14

personal jurisdiction over the Chansons. In this case, as editors of the website,

15

Roy and Amy Chanson would have known where Plaintiff lived even if they

16

conducted no inquiry into her whereabouts. Her location was required to post the

17

images of her. Defendants placed Plaintiff’s photos under the California tag on

18

YouGotPosted/UGotPosted, proving that they knew where she lived. In addition,

19

Defendants post personal information of all of the subjects whose photos appear

20

on the website, including links to Facebook pages, so that visitors of the site may

21

contact them. Defendants, including Roy and Amy Chanson, fully knew that the

22

subjects of the photos on their website are injured in their home state. Indeed,

23

Defendants gathered the location of each victim before posting the images. This

24

makes it all but certain that the site’s operators knew precisely where all of their

25

victims were located, and specifically sought to harm them right here at home – in

26

California. Otherwise, what purpose is served by displaying the victims’ name

27

and hometown? Thus, Roy and Amy Chanson knew that their tortious acts outside

Case 3:13-cv-01238-CAB-BLM Document 17 Filed 10/29/13 Page 18 of 20

1

of the state would injure Plaintiff in California, and the Court may reasonably

2

exercise specific jurisdiction over the Chansons.

3

Additionally, Plaintiff is a minor who has brought this complaint through

4

her mother over Defendants’ distribution of lewd and lascivious, sexually explicit

5

images of her. Because Plaintiff is under 18 years old, it is in her best interest to

6

litigate her cause of action in the state where she is domiciled, in California.

7

Should this child be forced to chase each individual Defendant in each of these

8

jurisdictions? Or should this child receive justice here—where all of the harm is

9

focused and felt? As operators of YouGotPosted/UGotPosted, Roy and Amy

10

Chanson, in concert with the other Defendants, posted the photos online with the

11

knowledge that Plaintiff lives in California. Therefore, it is just that the lawsuit

12

remain in California. On the other hand, dismissing this case for lack of personal

13

jurisdiction would require a victimized child to travel to unknown locales – either

14

Arizona, New Jersey, Illinois, or whatever other state the Chansons and their co-

15

conspirators claim would be proper. Is it just or proper that a child should be

16

forced to travel far from home, when the victimization of that child took place in

17

California and all of the effects of the victimization were in California? The

18

audacity of these Defendants seems to know no bounds.

19

In weighing these factors, the burden on Defendants is light in comparison,

20

as most of the evidence would be located in California. Considering the totality of

21

these circumstances, specific jurisdiction over Roy and Amy Chanson is

22

reasonable – and any other determination would be grossly unjust.

23
24

IV. CONCLUSION
Plaintiff Abbey respectfully requests this Court to deny Defendants Roy

25

and Amy Chanson’s Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). Plaintiff has

26

met her burden of establishing a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over the

27

Chansons.
