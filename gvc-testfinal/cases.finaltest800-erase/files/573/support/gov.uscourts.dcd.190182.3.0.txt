APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and Local Rule 65.1, Rochelle Garza, as
guardian ad litem to unaccompanied minor J.D., hereby applies for the issuance of an order
temporarily restraining Defendants (along with their respective successors in office, officers,
agents, servants, employees, attorneys and anyone acting in concert with them) from, inter alia,
interfering with or obstructing J.D.’s access to abortion; forcing, coercing, or requiring J.D. to
obtain “counseling” from an anti-abortion entity, including a crisis pregnancy center or
“pregnancy resource center” either before or after the abortion; forcing, coercing, or requiring
J.D. to notify anyone of her abortion decision, either before or after the abortion; disclosing
J.D.’s abortion decision themselves, either before or after the abortion, to her family or
immigration sponsor; coercing or attempting to “persuade” J.D. to carry her pregnancy to term;
or retaliating against J.D. based on her decision to have an abortion.
This motion is based on the memorandum of points and authorities submitted herewith,
all declarations, pleadings and filings filed in this action, and such oral arguments and evidence
as may be presented at a hearing on the motion.
The grounds for this application are that Defendants’ actions and policies violate J.D.’s
rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, insofar as

Case 1:17-cv-02122-TSC Document 3 Filed 10/14/17 Page 2 of 3

these actions and policies unlawfully violate J.D.’s rights to privacy, liberty and informational
privacy, and rights against compelled speech; that J.D. will suffer irreparable injury if the
Defendants are not enjoined; that Defendants will not be injured if a temporary restraining order
issues; and that the public interest favors the issuance of a temporary restraining order.
