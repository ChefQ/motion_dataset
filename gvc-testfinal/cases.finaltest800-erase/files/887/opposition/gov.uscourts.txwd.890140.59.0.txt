CIVIL ACTION NO. SA-17-CV-00808-XR

COUNTER-DEFENDANTS EQUITY LIAISON COMPANY AND DEWAYNE D. NAUMANN’S
RESPONSE TO COMPLETE OIL FIELD SERVICES LLC’S
MOTION TO RELEASE FUNDS HELD IN COURT REGISTRY

Counter-Defendants Equity Liaison Company (“ELC”) and Dewayne D. Naumann file this
Response to Complete Oil Field Services LLC’s Motion to Release Funds Held in Court Registry,
showing the Court as follows:
1.

ELC and Naumann disagree with certain of the factual allegations contained within

the Motion filed by Complete Oil Field Services LLC (“COFS”). For example, ELC and Naumann
do not agree that ELC’s accounting revealed “substantial irregularities” or that it was in any way
improper or “unauthorized” for ELC to redact information unrelated to this dispute from bank
statements provided to COFS as alleged in the Motion. See Motion ¶ 3. Naumann further
disagrees that he personally “simultaneously served as both a neutral escrow agent, and as a pay
agent for Bates Energy” or “made substantial disbursements of funds out of the ELC Escrow
Account” or undertook any other complained-of actions in his individual capacity as alleged in the
Motion. See, e.g., Motion ¶¶ 6-7, 11-13, 17-18, 21. ELC and Nauman further disagree that they

Case 5:17-cv-00808-XR Document 59 Filed 01/18/18 Page 2 of 3

undertook any conduct constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct as alleged in paragraph
25 of the Motion.
2.

ELC and Naumann are not making and have never made a claim to the funds

deposited in the Registry of the Court. ELC agrees with COFS’s statement that ELC’s indemnity
claim is not a claim against the escrow fund itself. ELC and Naumann therefore take no position
regarding the relief requested by COFS in the Motion.
