CIVIL ACTION: SA:17-CV-00808-XR

DEFENDANT/COUNTER-PLAINTIFF COMPLETE OIL FIELD SERVICE, LLC’S
MOTION TO RELEASE FUNDS HELD IN COURT REGISTRY
NOW COMES Complete Oil Field Services, LLC (“COFS” or “Defendant/CounterPlaintiff”), and files this Motion to Release Funds Held in Court Registry and shows the Court as
follows:
I.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1.

This case involves a $4 million escrow arrangement that was supposed to fund COFS’s

procurement of tens of thousands of tons of frac sand. Because of misrepresentations and
deceptions, no frac sand was delivered and a substantial portion of the escrowed funds disappeared.
2.

When presented with these facts, this Court granted COFS’s request for a preliminary

injunction and ordered that all remaining funds in the control of the escrow agent, Defendant
Equity Liaison Company (“ELC”), be deposited in the registry of the Court until further order of
the Court. [Dkt. 30]. The Court also ordered that ELC account for all funds that came into its
possession. [Dkt. 16 and 30]. In addition, the Court ruled that if COFS’s examination of ELC’s
accounting revealed “insufficiencies, inaccuracies, incompleteness or some other concern,” then
COFS could seek further relief from the Court.

3.

COFS’ examination of the ELC accounting did indeed reveal irregularities and COFS

therefore filed Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff Complete Oil Field Services LLC’s Motion to Enforce
TRO and Preliminary Injunction. [Dkt. 39]. Thereafter, ELC provided COFS with additional
bank statements in support of its accounting. The accounting as a whole continues to include
substantial irregularities and unauthorized redactions. By this motion, COFS asks the Court to
release and disburse all remaining funds from the registry of the Court to COFS, as owner in trust
of the funds, so that COFS may satisfy obligations it owes to its customer, ProPetro Services, Inc.
(“ProPetro”).
II.
BACKGROUND
4.

On April 19, 2017 ProPetro, a pressure pumping services company based in West Texas

that provides fracking services to well operators, placed $4 million in funds into two escrow
accounts. The funds were to be the first deposit of monies dedicated exclusively for COFS’s use
in procuring frac sand for ProPetro. An April 13, 2017 Supply Agreement between ProPetro and
COFS governed the deposit and intended disbursement of the funds. [Dkt. 12-4]. The Supply
Agreement provided that ProPetro would pay $104 per ton to buy the sand. Thus, the $4 million
fund should have purchased over 38,000 tons of sand in a period of weeks – 10,000 tons to be
delivered within a month and another 70,000 tons within the first 90 days.
5.

Prior to the execution of the Supply Agreement, Stan Bates represented to COFS that he

had access to an allocation of 370,000 tons of sand a month, ready to be delivered, and that he was
already delivering some 88,000 tons every 45 days to other customers.

Based on these

representations, COFS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding(“MOU”) with Bates Energy
Oil & Gas, LLC (“Bates Energy”) whereby Bates Energy would locate and procure the specified
sand. Bates Energy would be paid $99 per ton, resulting in a $5 per ton profit to COFS. [Dkt. 12DEFENDANT COUNTER-PLAINTIFF COMPLETE OIL FIELD SERVICE, LLC’S,
MOTION TO RELEASE FUNDS HELD IN COURT REGISTRY

Page 2

Case 5:17-cv-00808-XR Document 58 Filed 01/11/18 Page 3 of 16

6]. The MOU provides that Bates Energy would be paid 50% of the procurement cost at the time
the sand was loaded for delivery from the mine (or point of origin), and 50% of the procurement
cost at the time the sand was off-loaded for final delivery to the well site. In order to prove that
the sand was actually procured, Bates Energy was obligated to provide Bills of Lading.
6.

As referenced above, the $4 million in escrow funds was split into two accounts: $3 million

was deposited in an Amegy Bank escrow account, with Amegy serving as the escrow agent (the
“Amegy Escrow Account”), and $1 million deposited in an ELC bank account at JP Morgan Chase,
with ELC serving as the escrow agent, (the “ELC Escrow Account”). Stan Bates insisted that ELC
serve as escrow agent for at least some of the funds because Amegy was not embedded in the oil
and gas industry and because ELC was, in his words, “a proven performance company.” The
signatories on the Amegy Escrow Account were Janis Kline for COFS and DeWayne D. Naumann
(“Naumann”) for ELC. The signatories on the ELC Escrow Account were Janis Kline for COFS
and Stan Bates for Bates Energy. Thus, Naumann simultaneously served as both a neutral escrow
agent, and as a pay agent for Bates Energy. This arrangement, though unusual, was acceptable to
COFS because both escrow agreements required COFS’s signature and authorization to effectuate
any disbursements of funds.
7.

In fact, Naumann made substantial disbursements of funds out of the ELC Escrow Account

solely on the instruction of Stan Bates – with no authorization from, or even notice to, COFS.
ELC’s secret disbursements were made in the midst of repeated, unanswered requests by COFS to
ELC for information on the balance in the ELC Escrow Account.
8.

Moreover, none of ELC’s disbursements of funds from the ELC Escrow Account were

made for frac sand purchases procured by Bates Energy. Rather, the unlawfully disbursed funds
were used for unauthorized and undocumented purposes, including (1) arbitrarily declared

“liquidated damages,” (2) “flat fees,” (3) “administrative fees,” or a “draw,” (4) legal fees, (5)
insurance costs, and (6) failed attempts to “mitigate” costs for sand that was never delivered.
9.

The payments disbursed by Naumann on Stan Bates’ signature alone totaled over $600,000

of the original $1,000,000 deposited in the ELC Escrow Account. The amounts disbursed included
at least $37,500 paid by ELC to Naumann himself. To this day, Bates Energy has failed to deliver
a single grain of frac sand either to COFS, or COFS’s customer ProPetro.
10.

Two months after the escrow accounts were created, it was clear that Bates Energy could

not deliver sand in the promised volumes required by ProPetro. At that point COFS identified a
mine in Wisconsin, CSI Sands (Wisconsin) Ltd. (“CSI”), that could supply a large quantity of the
needed sand.
11.

In order to pay for the CSI sand with the funds held in escrow, COFS needed Bates

Energy’s cooperation. COFS approached Stan Bates and requested that he authorize a transfer of
$1 million from the Amegy Escrow Account directly to CSI. On June 15, 2017, Stan Bates sent
Naumann a letter authorizing Naumann to release funds to CSI “per the escrow agreement with
BATES Energy.” This authorization would have permitted Naumann, as Bates’ escrow pay agent,
to sign off on disbursements from the Amegy Escrow Account for payments directly to CSI.
12.

For reasons that are now clear, Naumann refused to comply with that instruction. Instead,

he took the situation as an opportunity to control additional funds through the ELC Escrow
Account. Naumann contends he believed he was permitted to disburse funds from that account
based on unilateral instructions from Stan Bates, and to do so without ever notifying COFS.
13.

Even as Naumann and Stan Bates were secretly funneling COFS’s escrow funds to

themselves and others, Bates Energy obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order on July 20,
2017 in state court that prevented COFS from seeking withdrawals from either escrow account,

DEFENDANT COUNTER-PLAINTIFF COMPLETE OIL FIELD SERVICE, LLC’S,
MOTION TO RELEASE FUNDS HELD IN COURT REGISTRY

Page 4

Case 5:17-cv-00808-XR Document 58 Filed 01/11/18 Page 5 of 16

including withdrawals necessary to pay for sand that had already been procured from CSI.1 Bates
Energy boldly, and wrongfully, claimed that injunctive relief was warranted because COFS was
seeking to access escrow funds without the required authorization of Bates. Those claims were
ultimately disproven and the state court denied Bates Energy’s request for injunctive relief.
14.

During the course of the state court litigation, COFS continued to ask that Naumann

confirm the balance in the ELC Escrow Account. [Dkt. 33-1, at 26]. Despite numerous requests,
Naumann refused to provide any substantive response. Only after the case was removed to this
United States District Court, and ELC/Naumann were sued, did Naumann finally reveal in open
court that he had repeatedly withdrawn funds from the ELC Escrow Account on the unilateral
instruction of Stan Bates. Naumann admitted that only $308,662.65 remained in the account of
the original balance of $1 million.
15.

In the meantime, because of the complete lack of performance by Bates Energy, COFS

terminated the MOU by letter dated August 15, 2017. [Dkt. 4-19].
16.

The ELC Escrow and Disbursement Agreement provides as follows: “This Escrow

Agreement shall terminate upon the first to occur of any of the following events…The expiration
or termination of the PSA [MOU], in which case the remaining balance, accrued interest or excess
finds [funds] of the Fund shall be disbursed to the Buyer [COFS].” [Dkt. 4-7, at 1 (emphasis
added)].
17.

Consequently, COFS’s termination notice included the demand that all remaining funds in

the ELC Escrow Account be remitted to COFS. Not only did ELC/Naumann refuse the demand
to return the funds, he also took that opportunity to secretly disburse an additional $140,541.85 on

COFS removed the state court litigation to this federal court on or about September 7, 2017
[Dkt. 9].

August 23, 2017 from the ELC Escrow Account, once again at the sole request of Stan Bates, and
with no notice to COFS. [Dkt. 34, at 1]. Those funds were wired to Stan Bates.
18.

In an effort to stop ELC/Naumann and Stan Bates/Bates Energy from further dissipating

the escrowed funds, COFS requested preliminary injunctive relief from this Court, including an
order that ELC/Naumann deposit the remaining funds into the Court’s registry. [Dkt. 13, p. 5].
On September 29, 2017, this Court entered such Order. [Dkt. 30, p. 4]. The Court ruled that the
funds were to remain in the registry “until further order of the Court.” Id.
19.

In stark contrast to the ELC Escrow Account, the Amegy Escrow Account was managed

by Amegy in a professional and responsible manner. Amegy provided monthly statements on the
account showing all credits and debits, including a running balance. Amegy responded promptly
to requests for information. And Amegy returned the balance of the funds it was holding when
the escrow agreement terminated on its own terms.2

The Amegy escrow agreement provided, “This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the first
to occur of any of the following events: … B. The expiration of 6 months from the date of this
Escrow Agreement, in which case the remaining balance of the Fund shall be disbursed to
COMPLETE OIL FIELD SERVICES, LLC.”

II.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
20.

“Pursuant to Rule 67 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party may deposit a sum

of money with the court. Once funds are deposited, the court should determine ownership and
make disbursements." Jones v. Prescott, 702 Fed. Appx. 205, 208 (5th Cir. 2017), citing In re
Craig's Stores of Texas, Inc., 402 F.3d 522, 524 (5th Cir. 2005). "Whether Rule 67 relief should
be available in any particular case is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district
court." Jones v. Prescott, id., citing Cajun Elec. Power Co-op., Inc. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 901 F.2d
441, 445 (5th Cir. 1990).3
21.

This Court’s decision to order that the remaining subject escrow funds be deposited into

the registry of the Court was amply supported by the facts and the law. It is undisputed that
ELC/Naumann served as an escrow agent for the transactions and occurrences involved in this
suit. As an escrow agent, ELC owed fiduciary duties to COFS, including the duty of loyalty, the
duty to make full disclosure, and the duty to exercise a high degree of care to conserve the money
placed in escrow and pay it only to those persons entitled to receive it. Holder-McDonald v. Chi.
Title Ins. Co., 188 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, pet. denied). ELC breached those
duties by, among other things, unlawfully disbursing funds to various recipients, without the
authorization of COFS and without delivery of frac sand, and by failing to fully and promptly
disclose to COFS that such disbursements were being made.
22.

The Court now has the discretion to order disbursement of the escrowed funds, pursuant to

FED. R. CIV. P. 67, and COFS respectfully requests that the Court find that COFS is the sole and

“There is very little case authority applying Rule 67.” Putz v. Golden, No. C10-0741JLR, 2012
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154240, 2012 WL 5293354, at *12 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 26, 2012), citing 12 Charles
Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane & Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and
Procedure § 2991 at 58 (2d ed. 1997).

rightful owner of the funds, as trustee for its customer ProPetro. There is no longer an escrow
agreement governing the disposition of the funds that were originally deposited into the ELC
Escrow Account. Consequently, those funds should be released as provided for in the agreement
– i.e., to the “Buyer” who is defined in the agreement as “Complete Oil Field Services, LLC.”
[Dkt. 4-7, at 1].
23.

ELC has asserted a claim for indemnity based upon the language of Paragraph 2.3 of the

ELC escrow agreement. That claim does not entail any ownership interest in the registry funds,
and should not prevent the release of funds from the Court’s registry to COFS for two reasons.
24.

First, the indemnity claim is not a claim against the escrow fund itself, rather it is a claim

against COFS and Bates Energy. Moreover, even if ELC were to prevail on its indemnity claim,
nothing entitles it to any indemnification relief from the specific funds held in the Court’s registry.
Thus, the release of the funds from the registry will not prejudice the prosecution of ELC’s
indemnity claim.
25.

Second, the indemnity clause in question includes an exception for conduct undertaken by

ELC that is deemed to constitute “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct.” Naumann’s
testimony during this Court’s hearing on COFS’s motion for a preliminary injunction amply
established that his and ELC’s conduct amounted to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct.
For instance, Naumann admitted he failed to create a segregated bank account to manage the
escrow funds (Transcript at p. 56); he admitted he failed to obtain COFS’s consent before releasing
funds (Transcript at p. 60-61); and he admitted he failed to respond to COFS’s repeated requests
for information about the activity in the account (Transcript at p. 52). 4 Thus, even if the escrowed

Pages of the transcript from the September 25, 2017 hearing on COFS’s motion for preliminary
injunction are attached as Exhibit 1.

funds were available to satisfy an indemnity obligation, ELC is owed no indemnity as a matter of
law.
26.

The only party in this case that has a viable ownership claim to the funds in the Court

registry is COFS, the entity who rightfully owns the funds on behalf of its customer ProPetro, and
based on the express terms of the ELC Escrow Agreement. As explained above, ELC has no viable
competing claim. Bates Energy likewise has no competing claim. Even if it did, it is a corporate
entity without legal representation, and consequently has no legitimate way to prosecute such a
claim.
PRAYER
WHEREFORE, COFS respectfully requests that this motion be granted and that the funds
currently deposited with the registry of the Court be released and disbursed to it as soon as possible,
with accrued interest and less any required fees and costs of Court, and for general relief.

copies of statements reflecting activity in the ELC escrow

14

account, do you?

15

A.

No.

16

Q.

And you did not provide that information, did you?

17

A.

There is no provision in the escrow agreement to do that.

18

Q.

And, therefore, you did not?

19

A.

Exactly.

20

Q.

So from April 14 until now, you have not provided a single

21

statement about any disbursements from that ELC escrow

22

account, correct?

23

A.

24

correct.

THE WITNESS:

Why not?
Sir, it is a matter of just

transacting accounting and bookkeeping through a single

account for one client.

That way, I keep the disbursements

10

for one client clear and don't have to worry about commingling

11

it with other accounts.

12

THE COURT:

But you did commingle it.

You

13

commingled it with 105,000 that belonged to some other

14

transaction.

15

THE WITNESS:

With all due respect, sir, I would

16

disagree.

17

when the account was technically terminated under the use with

So, Mr. Naumann, you are saying that under this agreement,

10

that direction?

11

A.

That's what the agreement says.

12

Q.

And did you do that in this case?

13

from Mr. Bates?

14

A.

Yes, I did, or his attorney, yes.

Or his attorney?

Yes.

Which attorney?

Q.

And did you follow those directions based upon this

Correct.

I mean, are you claiming that any of the

notices that you got from Bates was fake?

I did not.

And if you review the

information that I am provided, you will see that I rejected

12

on numerous occasions the requests for funds to be paid out.

13
14

THE COURT:

But with regard to the payments you did

pay out, are you saying that any of those were fraudulent?

15

THE WITNESS:

16

THE COURT:

In what respect, sir?

Well, I am looking -- at your

17

construction, giving you the benefit of the doubt of 2.2 and

18

2.3, the way it looks to me, I mean, at first glance, is that

19

if you receive fraudulent instructions, you had

20

indemnification from that.

21

So what I am asking you is, when you made payments,
are you claiming that anything you relied upon was fraudulent?
