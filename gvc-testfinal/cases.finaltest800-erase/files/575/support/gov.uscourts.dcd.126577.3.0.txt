MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND
FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Plaintiff Ajilon Professional Staffing, LLC (“Ajilon”) respectfully moves
this Court for the immediate entry of a temporary restraining order and for preliminary
injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. The basis for this motion is
that Ajilon will sustain irreparable harm if Defendants are not enjoined from
misappropriating and misusing Ajilon’s confidential and trade secret information in
violation of the District of Columbia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, in addition to
Defendants’ confidentiality and non-compete agreements, as is more fully explained in
the memorandum in support and the Complaint and declarations filed contemporaneously
herewith.
Ajilon requests relief based on the grounds that are set forth in the
Declarations of Bill DeMario and John Mullenholz, attached to the accompanying
memorandum as Exhibits A and B, respectively.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Ajilon Professional Staffing, LLC (“Ajilon”), by its undersigned attorney,
respectfully submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion for a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction.
I.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Ajilon respectfully refers the Court to the accompanying Complaint and

declarations, filed herewith, for a complete statement of facts supporting Ajilon’s motion
for a temporary restraining order.

In essence, Ajilon alleges that Defendants have

misappropriated trade secrets; breached their post-employment contractual obligations;
tortiously interfered with business and contractual relations; breached their fiduciary duty
and duty of loyalty; and have received and will continue to receive unless enjoined unjust
enrichment at the expense of Ajilon, who has been irreparably harmed by Defendants’

4

Document 3

Page 5 of 8

unlawful activity. Unless immediately enjoined, Defendants will continue to engage in
their illegal conduct and will cause further irreparable harm to Ajilon.

II.

ARGUMENT
When reviewing petitions for interlocutory injunctive relief, the Court

must look to a four-prong test. This test requires the Court to consider (1) whether
plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to prevail on the merits of one of their
claims; (2) whether plaintiffs have shown that they would be irreparably harmed if
injunctive relief is not awarded; (3) the balance between the hardship to the defendants if
injunctive relief is granted and the hardship to the plaintiff if injunctive relief is not
granted; and (4) whether awarding the relief is in the public interest. Tenafly Eruv Ass’n,
Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2002); Jacksonville Port Authority
v. Adams, 556 F.2d 52, 57 (D.C. Cir. 1977).
“The two most important factors are probability of irreparable injury to the
plaintiff without a decree and likelihood of harm to the defendants with a decree.”
Ancora Capital and Mgt. Group, LLC v. Gray, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 56 at *6 (4th Cir. 2003).
If the balance between the two factors tips in favor of the plaintiff, “it is enough that
grave or serious questions are presented; and plaintiff need not show a likelihood of
success.” Id., quoting Blackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189, 196
(4th Cir. 1977). See also Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Medical Corp., 952 F.2d
802, 813 (4th Cir. 1992) (when the balance of harms “tips decidedly in favor of the
plaintiff, a preliminary injunction will be granted if the plaintiff has raised questions
going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful as to make them fair
5

Case 1:07-cv-01281-RJL

Document 3

Filed 07/18/2007

grounds for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.”).

Page 6 of 8

Moreover, in

applying this test, district courts “employ a sliding scale under which a particularly strong
showing in one area can compensate for weakness in another.” Sociedad Anonima Vina
Santa Rita v. Department of the Treasury, 2001 WL 1804108, at *6 (D.D.C. Aug. 13
2001) (quoting City Fed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747
(D.C. Cir. 1995)).
In this case, Ajilon is entitled to its request because (1) the harm Ajilon
will suffer if injunctive relief is not granted far outweighs the harm Defendants will suffer
if injunctive relief is granted; (2) Ajilon has raised “grave or serious” questions going to
the merits of this case; and (3) the public interest favors the issuance of an injunction.
A.

The balance of hardships tips decidedly in favor of Ajilon.
If an injunction is not granted, Ajilon will suffer grave irreparable harm in

the form of damage to its business reputation, loss of goodwill, loss of clients, and loss of
employees. Defendants will continue to solicit Ajilon’s clients through the use of
Ajilon’s client lists and the contacts Defendants made with these clients while employed
by Ajilon. Ajilon will lose clients, and this loss of business will make it more difficult
for Ajilon to recruit and hire new employees and qualified personnel. Monetary damages
alone cannot fully compensate a loss of this sort, nor can they protect Ajilon from the
continuation of Defendants’ wrongful use of Ajilon’s trade secrets and confidential
information.
In contrast, Defendants will not be harmed if an injunction is granted.
Ajilon is merely asking Defendants to abide by their contractual obligations. Defendants
are fully aware of the commitment they made to Ajilon, which is fully enforceable.
6

Case 1:07-cv-01281-RJL

Ajilon is seeking to protect its trade secrets, which are entitled to protection under the
District of Columbia Trade Secrets Act; the business relationships it has invested a great
deal of time, effort and money building; and its ability to attract the top-notch staff that
the competitive market demands.
B.

Ajilon has raised “grave or serious questions” going to the
merits of its case.

In light of all of the reasons set forth fully in Ajilon’s Complaint and
accompanying affidavits, filed herewith, Ajilon has raised questions “going to the merits
so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation
and this for more deliberative investigation.” Direx Israel, 952 F.2d at 813. Ajilon has
presented compelling evidence that Defendants have illegally used Ajilon’s trade secret
information in violation of the District of Columbia Trade Secret Protection Act and
violated the terms of their Employment Agreements with Ajilon, which included fully
enforceable confidentiality and non-compete clauses.
C.

The public interest favors the issuance of the injunction.

In this case, the Court will serve the public interest by granting an
injunction because the public has a deeply rooted interest in protecting trade secret client
lists and other confidential information. In fact, this interest is reflected in the very
adoption of the District of Columbia Trade Secret Act. “The public has an interest in
preventing unfair competition, commercial piracy, misleading solicitations….The public
has no interest in destroying contracts, rewarding theft, and encouraging unethical
business behavior.” Morgan Stanley DW Inc. v. Rothe, 150 F.Supp.2d 67, 79 (D.D.C.
2001)(quoting IDS Life Ins. Co. v. Sun America, Inc., 958 F.Supp. 1258, 1282 (N.D. Ill.

7

1997). The Court also has an interest in seeing the terms of a reasonable contract
enforced. See Sagalyn v. Foun. for Pres. of Georgetown, 691 A.2d 107 (D.C. 1997).

III.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Ajilon requests that the Court issue a

temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction of the type requested in its
accompanying motion.
