MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO SET ASIDE
DEFAULT JUDGMENTS REGARDING VGJ.COM AND YJX.COM AND
RETURN THOSE DOMAIN NAMES TO THEIR PRIOR OWNERS
In rem Defendants VGJ.com and YJX.com, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
60(b), submit this Memorandum in Support of Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgments
Regarding VGJ.com and YJX.com and Return Those Domain Names to Their Prior Owners
obtained by Plaintiff Associated Recovery, Inc. Defendants are domain names against which
Plaintiff has brought this in rem action. Defendants also seek the return of these domain names
to their Chinese owners to maintain the status quo. Defendants’ counsel met and conferred in
good faith with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding this motion pursuant to Local Civil Rule 7(E), and
had understood that as of July 15, Plaintiff had consented to the motion to set aside entry of
default judgment but only opposed the return of the domain names to Mr. Huang and Ms. Lin.
Defendants’ counsel thereafter sent a draft consent order to Plaintiff on July 15, 2016. During a
subsequent conversation with Plaintiff’s counsel on July 18, however, Plaintiff’s counsel
informed Defendants’ counsel that he was unable to obtain authorization from the client
regarding any aspect of this Motion.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

The Netsphere Litigation.
This dispute is related to litigation in the Northern District of Texas styled Netsphere, Inc.

v. Baron. The Netsphere litigation arose from a business dispute between Jeffrey Baron,
Plaintiff’s alleged predecessor in interest, and his business partner. In the Texas Litigation, the
Texas court found that Baron repeatedly engaged in vexatious and abusive litigation conduct.
Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, 703 F.3d 296, 302 (5th Cir. 2012) (Netsphere I). In response to that
conduct, the Northern District of Texas appointed Peter S. Vogel (“Vogel” or “Receiver”) as the
receiver for companies controlled by Baron. See Order Appointing Receiver, Netsphere, Inc. v.
Baron, No. 3:09-CV-0988-F (N.D. Tex. Nov. 24, 2010), ECF 130.
In response to Baron’s continuing misconduct, the Northern District of Texas granted a
motion by the Receiver to permit the sale of domain names owned by Baron’s businesses,
including Novo Point, LLC (“Novo Point”) for the purpose of paying Novo Point’s creditors.
See February 4, 2011 Order Granting the Receiver’s Omnibus Motion to Permit Sales of Domain
Names, Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, No. 3:09-CV-0988-F (N.D. Tex. Feb. 4, 2011), ECF 288. The
Northern District further granted the Receiver’s motion to appoint Damon Nelson (“Nelson”) as
permanent manager of Novo Point to assist the Receiver in selling Novo Point’s domain names.
See Order Granting the Receiver’s Motion to Appoint Damon Nelson as Permanent Manager of
the LLCs and For Turnover of LLC Materials to Damon Nelson, Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, No.
3:09-CV-0988-F (N.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2011), ECF 473. Mr. Nelson thus worked under the
direction of the Receiver.
Although the Northern District of Texas eventually terminated the receivership, the court
explicitly “retain[ed] exclusive jurisdiction . . . over any disputes that may arise concerning . . .
any controversy that arises from or relates to the Receivership or actions of the Receiver or his
2

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 3 of 20 PageID# 1116

professionals.” Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, No. 3:09-CV-0988-F (N.D. Tex. March 27, 2015),
ECF 1447 at 21. See also Baron v. Vogel, No. 3:15-CV-232-L, 2016 WL 1273465, at *3 (N.D.
Tex. Mar. 31, 2016) (noting that Northern District of Texas retains exclusive jurisdiction “over
any disputes that might arise . . . from or relate[ ] to the receivership or actions of the receiver or
his professionals”).
On April 15, 2016, this Court granted the undersigned counsel’s motion to transfer a
portion of this case related to 28 domain names to the Northern District of Texas. (See ECF 40.)
On July 1, 2016, this Court set aside three default judgments and transferred three more domain
names (JTZ.com, OCU.com, YTE.com) to the Northern District of Texas. (See ECF 59.)
B.

Purchases of VGJ.com and YJX.com.
Pursuant to the Northern District of Texas’s order authorizing the sale of Novo Point’s

domain names, Nelson sold the domain names that are the subject of this litigation, including
VGJ.com and YJX.com, in 2012. (See ECF 1 ¶ 241.) The seller of the domain names in the
agreements was Novopoint, LLC [sic], and Nelson authorized the sale and signing on behalf of
Novo Point. Id. Plaintiff filed this lawsuit attempting to unwind this sale. (See ECF 1 ¶¶ 24041.)
On July 9, 2015, Huochun Huang purchased the VGJ.com domain name. (See
Declaration of Huochun Huang (“Huang Decl.”) at ¶ 3, attached hereto as Exhibit A.) Mr.
Huang gave value for VGJ.com, and the seller caused the domain name to be transferred to
eName.com, a duly accredited ICAN registrar. (See id. at ¶ 4.) Mr. Huang immediately
provided accurate registrant contact information to eName.com. (See id. at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff admits
that it has not used the VGJ mark since 2012. (ECF 1 ¶ 3.)
On January 29, 2013, Chunmei Lin purchased the YJX.com domain name. (See
Declaration of Chunmei Lin (“Lin Decl.”) at ¶ 3, attached hereto as Exhibit B.) Ms. Lin gave
3

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 4 of 20 PageID# 1117

value for YJX.com, and the seller caused the domain name to be transferred to eName.com, a
duly accredited ICAN registrar. (See id. at ¶ 4.) Ms. Lin immediately provided accurate
registrant contact information to eName.com. (See id. at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff admits that it has not
used the YJX mark since 2012. (ECF 1 ¶ 3.)
C.

Service of Complaint.
On December 31, 2015, Plaintiff filed this in rem action against various John Doe

Defendants and domain names, alleging a violation of the Federal Anticybersquatting Consumer
Protection Act (“ACPA”) and other claims. (See ECF 1.) On January 20, 2016, Plaintiff filed a
Motion for an Order to Publish Notice of Action. (See ECF 3; ECF 4.) In its Memorandum in
support of that motion, Plaintiff alleged to have sent the notices “to the postal and e-mail
addresses set forth in the registrations for the Domain Names.” (ECF 4 at 4.) The Declaration in
support of the motion further clarified that Plaintiff had sent copies of the Complaint “to each of
the defendants via e-mail, using the e-mail addresses provided on the Whois records for each of
the Internet domain names at issue,” and further directed a letter to be sent “to each postal and email addresses set forth in the registrations for the Domain Names” on December 31, 2015.
(ECF 4-1 ¶ 4.) Neither Plaintiff’s Memorandum nor Declaration, however, include a certificate
of service related to sending the Complaint. Nor does Plaintiff identify the specific addresses to
which it allegedly sent the Complaint. Rather, the Memorandum attaches only “representative
copies” of the notices, which relate to just two of the domain names at issue. (Id. at Composite
Attachment 1 and Attachment 2.)
On January 27, 2016, this Court issued an Order to Publish Notice of Action and directed
that a copy of the order be published in The Washington Times “within fourteen (14) days after
entry of this Order.” (ECF 6, ¶ 1.) The Court further ordered that “[a]ny answer or other
response to the Complaint should be filed . . . within twenty-one (21) days from the date of
4

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 5 of 20 PageID# 1118

publication of this Order in The Washington Times.” (ECF 6, ¶ 2(C).) Plaintiff advised the
Court that it published the Court’s order in The Washington Times on February 3, 2016. (See
ECF 7; ECF 7-1.)
Neither Mr. Huang nor Ms. Lin received any email notice from Plaintiff regarding this
litigation, nor does either subscribe to the Washington Times. (Huang Decl. at ¶¶ 6-7; Lin Decl.
at ¶¶ 6-7.)
D.

Entry of Default and Other Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside.
On February 25, 2016, Plaintiff sought an entry of default against certain domain names,

including VGJ.com and YJX.com. (ECF 9.) The Clerk granted the entry of default on February
26, 2016 (ECF 10), and then granted an amended entry of default on February 29, 2016 (ECF
12).
In late April and early March 2016, the domain names yyg.com, yrn.com, vcz.com,
fny.com, zhd.com, and zulin.com, via their corresponding owners Liwei Liu, Dongdong Xu,
Teng Wang, Xiaosheng Liu, and Feng Yan retained the undersigned counsel to set aside the
default entered in this matter. The undersigned immediately prepared and filed a Motion to Set
Aside Default. (See ECF 13.) In that motion, the Defendants argued that they acted promptly to
lift the default, had a meritorious defense, and that Plaintiff would not be prejudiced by setting
aside the default. (See ECF 14.) The Magistrate Judge granted Defendants’ motion on March
18, 2016, setting aside the default as to domain names yyg.com, yrn.com, vcz.com, fny.com,
zhd.com, and zulin.com. (See ECF 27.) VGJ.com and YJX.com remained in default because
their respective owners were not aware or this litigation or its threat to their ownership. (Huang
Decl. at ¶ 7; Lin Decl. at ¶ 7.)
On March 25, 2016, certain domain names, including yyg.com, yrn.com, vcz.com,
fny.com, zhd.com, and zulin.com, filed a Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative, to Transfer
5

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 6 of 20 PageID# 1119

Venue. (See ECF 30.) On April 15, 2016, the Court granted that motion, transferring Plaintiff’s
claims against those domain names to the Northern District of Texas. (See ECF 40.)
On May 18, 2016, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment against
VGJ.com and YJX.com and other domain name defendants. (See ECF 42.) The same day, the
Court entered a Default Judgment (the “Default Judgment”). (See ECF 43.) In early June 2016,
the defaulted domain name was transferred to Plaintiff pursuant to the Judgment. Defendants
understand that Uniregistrar Corp. is the current registrar of VGJ.com and YJX.com.
E.

Other Prior Defendants’ Motions to Set Aside Default Judgment.
Other defendants, JTZ.com, OCU.com, and YTE.com, filed motions to set aside the

Default Judgment with respect to those domain names. (ECF 45, 48, 51). At a hearing on July
1, 2016, the Court granted those motions and transferred in rem Defendants JTZ.com, OCU.com,
and YTE.com to the Northern District of Texas. (ECF 58, 59).
F.

Representation of VGJ.com and YJX.com
Mr. Huang first learned of this litigation on June 13, 2016, when he received an email

from eName.com that he had been delisted as registrant of VGJ.com, following which he
searched for more information and retained counsel. (Huang Decl. at ¶¶ 7-9.) Ms. Lin first
learned of this litigation on June 27, 2016 when someone questioned her why her domain name,
YJX.com, was up for auction. (Lin Decl. at ¶ 7.) She quickly investigated the matter and
retained counsel. (Id. at ¶¶ 8-9). The undersigned thereafter worked diligently to obtain the facts
necessary to file this Motion. In rem Defendants VGJ.com and YJX.com now file this Motion to
Set Aside Default Judgment.1

1

The undersigned counsel are aware that this is now the fourth motion seeking to set aside the
default judgment entered in this action. Counsel has not filed seriatim motions to annoy or delay
in any way the proceedings. As to be expected with multiple domain owners who live outside
the United States in different locations, they have learned of the lawsuit and have sought our

II. ARGUMENT
The court should set aside the judgment under Rule 60(b)(1). Under that Rule, the Court
may relieve a party from a final judgment for “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). “[A] district court should consider whether the moving party
has a meritorious defense, whether it acts with reasonable promptness, the personal responsibility
of the defaulting party, the prejudice to the party, whether there is a history of dilatory action,
and the availability of sanctions less drastic.” Payne ex rel. Estate of Calzada v. Brake, 439 F.3d
198, 204-05 (4th Cir. 2006); see also Colleton Preparatory Acad., Inc. v. Hoover Universal, Inc.,
616 F.3d 413, 420 (4th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e have analyzed Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b) motions
using the same factors.”). The decision to set aside a judgment under Rule 60 is committed to
the discretion of the Court. Payne, 439 F.3d at 204.
A.

Courts Have a Strong Preference to Decide Cases On the Merits.
The Fourth Circuit has “repeatedly expressed a strong preference that, as a general

matter, defaults are to be avoided and that claims and defenses be disposed of on their merits.”
Saurikit, LLC v. cydia.com, No. 1:11CV0888 JCC/JFA, 2011 WL 5843638, at *2 (E.D. Va. Nov.
21, 2011) (quoting Colleton, 616 F.3d at 417). Any doubts about whether relief should be
granted, moreover, should be resolved in favor of setting aside the default so that the case may
be heard on the merits. Tolson v. Hodge, 411 F.2d 123 (4th Cir. 1969) (“It has been held in an
extensive line of decisions that Rules 55(c) and 60(b) are to be liberally construed in order to
provide relief from the onerous consequences of defaults and default judgments.”). “There is
much more reason for liberality in reopening a judgment when the merits of the case never have
assistance at varied times. Promptly upon being contacted by these two new domain owners, we
immediately began preparation of supporting declarations and a motion to file with the Court. In
addition, we just learned that another Chinese owner may seek to set aside the Default Judgment
regarding yet another domain name and are trying to finalize details to likely file another motion.

7

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 8 of 20 PageID# 1121

been considered than there is when the judgment comes after a full trial on the merits.” Wright
& Miller, § 2857 Discretion of the Court, 11 FED. PRAC. & PROC. CIV. (3d ed.). Here, the parties
dispute their respective rights and ownership interests in the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain
names. Defendants should have an opportunity to address those issues. Further, all relevant
factors weigh in favor of setting aside the Judgment.
B.

Defendants Were Unaware of the Nature of This Action.
Under Rule 60, courts give particular weight to a defendant’s lack of notice. Marshall v.

Boyd, 658 F.2d 552 (8th Cir. 1981) (failure to give notice is strong factor weighing in favor of
setting aside judgment); Lutomski v. Panther Valley, 653 F.2d 270 (6th Cir. 1981) (same);
Wilson v. Moore, 564 F.2d 366 (9th Cir. 1977) (same).
Indeed, courts have found that a lack of notice justifies relief from default, even where
the defendant was properly served. In Avon Contractors, Inc. v. Sec’y of Labor, 372 F.3d 171
(3d Cir. 2004), the respondent moved to set aside a default under Rule 60(b). Although the
respondent had been properly served via certified mail, one of its employees had destroyed the
mail. The Third Circuit lifted the judgment, reasoning that the respondent’s failure to answer
was due to excusable neglect. See also Colleton, 616 F.3d at 420 (although corporation was
properly served by process mailed to its agent designated for acceptance of service of process,
excusable neglect existed where agent mishandled process and defendant did not receive notice
of lawsuit).
Here, the owners of VGJ.com and YJX.com did not receive emails or regular mail from
Plaintiff’s counsel related to this action. (Huang Decl. at ¶ 6; Lin Decl. at ¶ 6.) Their first notice
was after they had been delisted as registrants of VGJ.com and YJX.com. (Huang Decl. at ¶ 7;
Lin Decl. at ¶ 7.) Both owners purchased their domain names for substantial value. (Huang
Decl. at ¶ 4; Lin Decl. at ¶ 4.) Thus, Defendants did not know that their rights and ownership
8

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 9 of 20 PageID# 1122

interest in VGJ.com and YJX.com were threatened by this lawsuit until after the Judgment was
entered. (Huang Decl. at ¶ 7; Lin Decl. at ¶ 7.) And as in Avon and Colleton, Defendant’s
failure to respond was, at worst, due to excusable neglect. See Colleton, 616 F.3d at 420 (setting
aside default for excusable neglect where party was properly served, but agent for service
mishandled process); Avon, 372 F.2d at 175 (finding excusable neglect under Rule 60(b) where
party was properly served, but employee destroyed service of process, reasoning that opposing
party would not suffer prejudice from opening default judgment). For this reason, the Court
should set aside the Default Judgment with respect to VGJ.com and YJX.com.
C.

Defendants Promptly Filed This Motion.
Upon discovering that their respective ownership interests in VGJ.com and YJX.com

were threatened, the Defendant owners immediately sought to retain counsel in the United States
and promptly filed this motion to set aside the entry of default, mere weeks after the Judgment
was entered. (Huang Decl. at ¶¶ 7-9; Lin Decl. at ¶¶ 7-9.) Defendants’ owners haves not
delayed in responding to this action in bad faith. Thus, this factor weights in favor of setting
aside the Judgment.
D.

Plaintiff Will Not Be Prejudiced By Setting Aside the Default Judgment.
In determining whether setting aside the default would prejudice the non-defaulting party,

courts consider whether the delay:
(1) made it impossible for the non-defaulting party to present some of its evidence;
(2) made it more difficult for the non-defaulting party to proceed with trial; (3)
hampered the non-defaulting party’s ability to complete discovery; and (4) was used
by the defaulting party to collude or commit a fraud.
Saurikit, 2011 WL 5843638, at *5 (citing Vick v. Wong, 263 F.R.D. 325, 330 (E.D. Va. 2009)).
“In the context of a motion to set aside an entry of default, as in other contexts, delay in and of
itself does not constitute prejudice to the opposing party.” Colleton, 616 F.3d at 418.

9

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 10 of 20 PageID# 1123

Here, Defendants’ owners filed this Motion soon after the Judgment was entered.
Plaintiff’s ability to present its case and gather evidence has not been prejudiced. See Avon, 372
F.2d at 175 (finding excusable neglect under Rule 60(b) where party was properly served,
reasoning that opposing party would not suffer prejudice by opening default judgment). Indeed,
as discussed above, the Court only recently transferred Plaintiff’s claims against other several
similarly situated domain names to the Northern District of Texas (see ECF 40), where that court
has yet to rule on the other transferred defendants’ Rule 12(b) motion or Plaintiff’s motion to file
an amended complaint. Moreover, Plaintiff’s Proposed Amended Complaint in the Northern
District of Texas includes claims against movant Defendants VGJ.com and YJX.com, a
copy of which is provided here as Exhibit C. In both the motion and Amended Complaint,
Plaintiff is represented by the same counsel appearing here: Paul Grandinetti and Rebecca
Stempien Coyle. See Exhibit C at 57. Indeed, save for the change in court name and docket
number, and the addition of Texas-specific causes of action, the Texas complaint is a copy of
Plaintiff’s Complaint in this Court. Plaintiff’s willingness to file the Texas complaint and
voluntarily pursue its claims against the Defendants in Texas is sufficient reason for this Court to
set aside the Default Judgment.
By contrast, VGJ.com and YJX.com’s owners will suffer serious injury to their
ownership interest in the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names if the Court does not set aside
the Judgment. Indeed, Defendants understand that Plaintiff has already put VGJ.com and
YJX.com up for auction online. See Exhibit D (online auction posting for VGJ.com and
YJX.com, as well as other domain names subject to the Default Judgment). Plaintiff intends to
sell the domain names, which reflects their lack of importance to Plaintiff. Defendants, on the
other hand, seek to maintain ownership of them. To prevent the domain names from being sold

10

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 11 of 20 PageID# 1124

to a third party, the Court should return them to their prior owners, Mr. Huang and Ms. Lin.2
Thus, this factor weights in favor of setting aside the Default Judgment.
E.

Defendants Have A Meritorious Defense.
“[A]ll that is necessary to establish the existence of a ‘meritorious defense’ is a

presentation or proffer of evidence, which, if believed, would permit either the Court or the jury
to find for the defaulting party.” United States v. Moradi, 673 F.2d 725, 727 (4th Cir. 1982); see
also Cent. Operating Co. v. Util. Workers of Am., AFL-CIO, 491 F.2d 245, 253 (4th Cir. 1974)
(“[A] party is not required to establish a meritorious defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
The purpose of the motion was only to open the default judgment so that there may be a trial on
the merits; he did not seek a judgment in his favor.”).
1.

Plaintiff Lacks Standing.

Neither Baron nor Novo Point could bring this suit. Plaintiff is allegedly their assignee.3
(ECF 1 ¶¶ 3 & 4.) Thus, Plaintiff’s claims are likewise barred. “[T]he only injury sufficient to
support an assignee’s standing to assert an assigned claim is an injury suffered by the assignor,
and that injury must satisfy all the requirements of constitutional standing, i.e., the injury
suffered must be an injury-in-fact that is causally traceable to a named defendant and likely to be
redressed by the court action.” PEMEX Exploracion y Produccion v. Murphy Energy Corp., 923
2

The undersigned counsel respectfully submit that the Court should consider temporarily
enjoining Plaintiff from auctioning or otherwise transferring any more of the domain names
subject to the Default Judgment, as it is foreseeable that other foreign owners may soon seek
relief. A 90-day injunction, for example, should give adequate time for others to appear without
unduly prejudicing Plaintiff, who appears intent on selling, and not keeping, the domain names.
3

Baron controls Plaintiff; indeed, he attended a settlement conference as Plaintiff’s
representative. He is directing this litigation through Plaintiff as a collateral attack on the sale of
VGJ.com and YJX.com pursuant to the Northern District of Texas’s orders. His conduct caused
the Northern District of Texas to appoint the Receiver. See February 4, 2011 Order Granting the
Receiver’s Omnibus Motion to Permit Sales of Domain Names, Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, No.
3:09-CV-0988-F (N.D. Tex. Feb. 4, 2011), ECF No. 288. Baron cannot obtain a second bite at
the apple by challenging those orders by using Plaintiff as a proxy in this litigation.

11

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 12 of 20 PageID# 1125

F. Supp. 2d 961, 965 (S.D. Tex. 2013). “[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing
contains three elements.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). These
elements are “(1) an ‘injury in fact’ that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or
imminent; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) the
likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.” Croft v. Gov. of Texas, 562 F.3d
735, 745 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61). The party invoking federal
jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.
Plaintiff’s allegations lack at least two requisite elements. First, there was no injury in
fact. Although the Fifth Circuit vacated the receivership, the sales of domain names to raise
funds needed to pay the receivership fees occurred under the court’s authority. See Baron v.
Vogel, No. 3:15-cv-232-L, 2016 WL 1273465, *5 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2016) (finding no ultra
vires acts by court-appointed receiver) (“Vogel I”). Neither the Fifth Circuit nor the Northern
District entered any order voiding the sales. Further, the Northern District of Texas implicitly
authorized the sales post hoc when it authorized payment of the receivership fees using, in part,
funds raised through the sales. See generally Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, No. 3:09-cv-988-F, 2013
WL 3327858 (N.D. Tex. May 29, 2013) (“Netsphere II”).
Second, there is no causal connection between the alleged injury and the conduct about
which Plaintiff complains. Assuming, arguendo, there were an injury, it was not caused by
Defendants, who are bona fide purchasers for value of VGJ.com and YJX.com. See EDS Corp.
v. Southwestern Bell Tel., 674 F.2d 453, 459 (5th Cir. 1982) (“A bona fide purchaser … is one
who buys property in good faith for valuable consideration and without knowledge (actual or
imputed) of outstanding claims in a third party or parties.”). Indeed, VGJ.com and YJX.com

12

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 13 of 20 PageID# 1126

were transferred pursuant to a contract, signed by Damon Nelson on behalf of Novo Point,
without notice or mention of any alleged third-party interests.
Plaintiff’s claims under the ACPA, for quiet title, and conversion all flow from
Defendant’s acquisition and use of domain names that were sold pursuant to the authorization of
the Northern District of Texas. The quiet title and conversion claims are extinguished by that
court’s orders authorizing the sales and subsequent orders authorizing payments. As for the
ACPA claims, which flow from alleged trademark rights, Defendants’ use of VGJ.com and
YJX.com was not only foreseeable, it was the very reason for the assignment. Hence,
Defendants enjoy an implied license from Novo Point that defeats any ACPA claim. See McCoy
v. Misuboshi Cutlery, Inc., 67 F.3d 917, 920 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (implied license available even
through involuntary sale). Defendants have not injured Baron, Novo Point, or Plaintiff. Id. Any
alleged injury to Baron or Novo Point (and by assignment, Plaintiff) was self-inflicted. See
Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, 703 F.3d 296, 313 (5th Cir. 2012) (“the record supports that the
circumstances that led to the appointment of a receiver were primarily of Baron’s own making”)
(“Netsphere I”).
With only Baron and Novo Point to blame, Plaintiff is allegedly the “assignee” of
nonexistent rights and, thus, has no standing to bring this case. See PEMEX, 923 F. Supp. 2d at
965 (S.D. Tex. 2013). For this independent reason, Plaintiff’s claims fail.

Plaintiff’s Claims Are Barred by Collateral Estoppel.

The Fifth Circuit decision in Netsphere I and the Northern District of Texas’ decisions in
Netsphere II, and Vogel collaterally estop Plaintiff’s claims. To establish collateral estoppel
under federal law, Defendant must show: (1) the issue is identical to the issue involved in the
prior litigation; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior litigation; and (3) the
determination of the issue in the prior litigation was a crucial and necessary part of the judgment.

Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. v. Terra XXI, Ltd., 583 F.3d 348, 353 (5th Cir. 2009). Here, all three
prongs are met.
The issues Plaintiff raises in its Complaint have been litigated and decided against
Plaintiff’s predecessors-in-interest. Plaintiff alleges that the domain names at issue were
“improperly” placed under the control of a receivership then sold pursuant to “Improper
Receivership Sale Orders.” (ECF 1 ¶¶ 240-41.) But in Netsphere I, the Fifth Circuit held that
the district court entered the Receivership Order to bring a halt to Baron’s “longstanding
vexatious litigation tactics,” and rejected Baron’s contention that the appointment of the
Receiver was in bad faith or collusive. Netsphere I, 703 F.3d at 310-13 (“[W]e hold, based on
this record, that in creating the receivership there was no malice nor wrongful purpose, and only
an effort to conserve property in which the court believed it was interested in maintaining for
unpaid attorney fees and to control Baron’s vexatious litigation tactics.”) (internal quotations
omitted).
Further, on remand, the Northern District of Texas ratified the domain name sales
Plaintiff challenges, finding:
[Vogel’s law firm] developed a system for determining the value of domain names
that allowed it to make choices regarding the fate of individual names: whether to
develop, to park, to sell or to let lapse. This was critical because it enabled counsel
… to identify money losing names that should be culled from the portfolios.
Although Baron may have elected to run these businesses differently, all of the
actions were reasonable and prudent ….
Netsphere II, 2013 WL 3327858, at *16. On March 31, 2016, the Northern District of Texas
again gave post hoc approval to the Receiver’s actions, stating that “any claim by Plaintiffs based
on the wrongful establishment or continuation of the receivership or payment of receivership
expenses is an impermissible collateral attack of prior orders through this suit.” Vogel, 2016 WL
1273465 at *6.

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 15 of 20 PageID# 1128

Plaintiff’s claims are just such “an impermissible collateral attack of prior orders” entered
by the Northern District of Texas authorizing the sale of Novo Point’s domain names. Id.; see
also Recoveredge LP v. Pentecost, 44 F.3d 1284, 1291 (5th Cir. 1995) (“Collateral estoppel will
apply in a second proceeding that involves separate claims if the claims involve the same issue
and the subject matter of the suits may be different as long as the requirements for collateral
estoppel are met.” (internal citations omitted)). For this reason alone, Plaintiff’s claims fail.
3.

Plaintiff Cannot Establish Bad Faith.

As part of its claim of violation of the ACPA, Plaintiff must establish that Defendants’
owners “had a bad faith intent to profit from using the [] domain name.” Lamparello v. Falwell,
420 F.3d 309, 318 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v.
Doughney, 263 F.3d 359, 367 (4th Cir. 2001)). Here, the owners purchased VGJ.com and
YJX.com in good faith. (Huang Decl. at ¶¶ 4-5; Lin Decl. at ¶¶ 4-5.) Indeed, the domain names
were originally purchased in good faith from Novo Point, Plaintiff’s predecessor in interest, who
was authorized to sell the domain name by the Northern District of Texas. See February 4, 2011
Order Granting the Receiver’s Omnibus Motion to Permit Sales of Domain Names, Netsphere,
Inc. v. Baron, No. 3:09-CV-0988-F (N.D. Tex. Feb. 4, 2011), ECF No. 288.
Plaintiff’s allegations confirm that Defendants’ owners acted in good faith. Specifically,
Plaintiff alleges that the owners are bona fide purchasers for value of the VGJ.com and YJX.com
domain names, stating that “the Northern District of Texas issued several orders permitting the
receivership to sell at least some of the Subject Domain Names.” (ECF 1 ¶ 241.) Contrary to
Plaintiff’s assertion, the owners did not know that Nelson allegedly did not have authority to
manage and transfer the domain names, and acted in good faith in acquiring the domain names.
(See id. ¶ 245.) For this independent reason, Plaintiff’s ACPA claims fail.

4.

Plaintiff’s Other Claims Fail.

Plaintiff’s conversion claim fails because conversion requires a transfer done without
permission. As discussed above, however, the owners’ predecessor-in-interest purchased the
VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names with the authorization of a court order, and Domain
Capital is a bona fide purchaser of the domain, with no notice of any wrongdoing in the transfer
of the domain name. See Fed. Ins. Co. v. Smith, 144 F. Supp. 2d 507, 519-20 and n.28 (E.D. Va.
2001) aff’d, 63 F. App’x 630 (4th Cir. 2003) (noting that a transferee is not liable for conversion
where it takes possession for valuable consideration).
Similarly, Plaintiff’s quiet title claim fails because Plaintiff must “prove that [it] has
superior title to the property.” See Gallant v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co., 766 F. Supp. 2d
714, 719 (W.D. Va. 2011). Because the owners are bona fide purchasers, they has superior title,
and Plaintiff’s quiet title claim fails.
As set forth above, Defendants’ owners have multiple, independent defenses to Plaintiff’s
claims. This factor weighs heavily in favor of setting aside the default.
F.

The Court Should Restore the Parties to the Position They Were in Before the
Judgment.
The Court should order the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names returned to their

Chinese owners, consistent with the status quo before the Judgment was entered. Defendants’
owners understand that in early June 2016, the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names were
transferred to Plaintiff, awarding Plaintiff the final relief it sought in the Judgment. Because the
Judgment should be set aside, the Court should also order that the VGJ.com and YJX.com
domain names be returned to their Chinese owners during the pendency of this litigation,
consistent with the procedure contemplated by the ACPA.

16

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 17 of 20 PageID# 1130

After setting aside a Judgment, the Court should “restore the parties to the status quo
ante.” In re Graziadei, 32 F.3d 1408, 1411 (9th Cir. 1994) (italics in original); see also Vander
Zee v. Karabatsos, 683 F.2d 832 (4th Cir. 1982) (noting that if judgment is deemed void, then
Court should order restitution of payments already made on void judgment); Belcastro v. Task
Indus., Inc., 182 F.3d 924 (9th Cir. 1999) (italics in original) (ordering restitution of funds;
“because [the movant] requested that the district court undo the effects of the 1995 default
judgment it held void, the district court was required to restore the parties to the status quo
ante.”); Watts v. Pinckney, 752 F.2d 406, 410 (9th Cir. 1985) (granting Rule 60 motion and
finding that movant was entitled to restitution of amounts paid under vacated judgment); Gen.
Tel. Corp. v. Gen. Tel. Answering Serv., 277 F.2d 919, 921 (5th Cir. 1960) (setting aside
judgment prohibiting use of words “General Telephone” by defendants).
Here, in setting aside the Judgment, the Court should return the domain name to Mr.
Huang and Ms. Ling, the registrants of VGJ.com and YJX.com, respectively, at the inception of
this litigation. See Belcastro, 182 F. 3d at 942 (italics in original) (after setting aside judgment
under Rule 60(b) Court will “undo the effect of that order and restore the parties to the status quo
ante.”); In re Graziadei, 32 F.3d at 1411 (same). That is also the posture contemplated by the
ACPA. The ACPA provides that when the registrar receives a copy of the Complaint in an
ACPA case, it “shall” (a) deposit with the court documents sufficient to establish the court’s
control and authority regarding the disposition of the registration and use of the domain name to
the court, and (b) “not transfer, suspend, or otherwise modify the domain name during the
pendency of the action, except upon order of the court.” 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(2)(D)(i)(I) and
(d)(2)(D)(i)(II). Accordingly, the ACPA contemplates that when an action is filed against a
domain name, that domain name retains its registry status pending the outcome of the case.

17

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 62 Filed 07/18/16 Page 18 of 20 PageID# 1131

The Court should not permit Plaintiff to benefit from the Judgment by maintaining
control over VGJ.com and YJX.com. Indeed, such a result would eviscerate the purpose of
setting aside the Judgment, as leaving the domain name in Plaintiff’s control would effectively
maintain and enforce the Judgment. As set forth above, Plaintiff’s claims fail on the merits.
Plaintiff’s predecessors transferred their interest in the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names
pursuant to orders entered by the Northern District of Texas. See supra at II.E.1 & II.E.2. Those
sales have not been invalidated. See id. Defendants’ owners purchased the domain names for
substantial value (Huang Decl. at ¶ 4; Lin Decl. at ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff should not be entitled to take advantage of the ACPA’s substituted service
provisions to obtain a Judgment where it has no copyright claim to the res at issue. For all these
reasons, the Court should set aside the Judgment and order Uniregistrar Corp., the currently
listed registrar of the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names, to take all steps within its power to
transfer the domain back to their owners, the holder of the domains before Plaintiff filed this
action.
III. CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, in rem Defendants VGJ.com and YJX.com,
and their respective owners, respectfully request that the Court GRANT this motion setting aside
the Judgment (ECF 43) and order Uniregistrar Corp., the current registrar of the VGJ.com and
YJX.com domain names, to take all steps within its power to transfer the domain back Mr.
Huang and Ms. Lin. Should the Court grant this motion, Defendants anticipate they will move to
dismiss under Federal Rule 12, or in the alternative, seek to transfer to the Northern District of
Texas.
