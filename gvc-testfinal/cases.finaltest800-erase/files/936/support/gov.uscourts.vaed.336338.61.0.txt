DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO SET ASIDE
DEFAULT JUDGMENTS REGARDING VGJ.COM AND YJX.COM AND
RETURN THOSE DOMAIN NAMES TO THEIR PRIOR OWNERS
In rem Defendants VGJ.com and YJX.com, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
60(b), hereby request to set aside the Judgment entered on May 18, 2016 [ECF 43]. Pursuant to
Local Civil Rule 7(E), Defendants’ counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel to meet and confer in good
faith regarding this Motion, and had understood that as of July 15, Plaintiff consented to the
motion to set aside entry of default judgment, but only opposed the return of the domain names
to Mr. Huang and Ms. Lin. Defendants’ counsel thereafter sent a draft consent order to Plaintiff
on July 15, 2016. During a subsequent conversation with Plaintiff’s counsel on July 18,
however, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants’ counsel that he was unable to obtain
authorization from the client regarding any aspect of this Motion.
The basis for this motion is set forth more fully in the accompanying Memorandum in
Support of Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgments Regarding VGJ.com and YJX.com and
Return Those Domain Names to Their Prior Owners.
WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion and set
aside the Judgment entered on May 18, 2016, 2016 (ECF 43) with respect to the VGJ.com and

YJX.com domain names. Defendants further request that the Court further order Uniregistrar
Corp., the current registrar of the VGJ.com and YJX.com domain names, to take all steps within
its power to transfer the domain back to Huochun Huang and Chunmei Lin, respectively.
