PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO MOTION TO SET ASIDE
DEFAULT JUDGMENTS REGARDING VGJ.COM AND YJX.COM
AND RETURN THOSE DOMAIN NAMES TO THEIR PRIOR OWNERS

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 68 Filed 07/29/16 Page 2 of 4 PageID# 1298

The Plaintiff Associated Recovery, LLC (the “Plaintiff” or “Associated Recovery”), by
counsel, hereby submits this response to Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default Judgments
Regarding VGJ.com and YJX.com and Return Those Domain Names to Their Prior Owners
(“VGJ and YJX’s Motion to Set Aside Judgment”). ECF Nos. 61 and 62.
The Plaintiff acknowledges this Court’s recent decisions on other motions to set aside
default judgments and the transfer of those previously “defaulted” defendants to the Northern
District of Texas, Case No. 3:16-cv-1025-L. As the Plaintiff’s counsel previously discussed with
counsel for VGJ and YJX, the Plaintiff largely does not object to the setting aside of the default
judgment and transfer of the matter to the Northern District of Texas. However, the Plaintiff
does object to the transfer of the domain names VGJ.com and YJX.com to the their alleged
“prior owners.”
The Plaintiff agrees that it will not sell or otherwise transfer VGJ.com until a final
resolution is reached in this matter. In regard to YJX.com, the Plaintiff’s counsel has recently
learned that the domain name was sold. Therefore, if the Court grants VGJ and YJX’s Motion to
Set Aside Judgment as to YJX.com, the Plaintiff requests that YJX be required to reimburse the
Plaintiff for the costs necessary to return the buyer’s monies for the sale as well as to cover
commissions and other costs that were spent to effect the sale.1 The Plaintiff notes that the need
for this compensation would not have been necessary if YJX had appeared in a timely fashion.
Finally, the Plaintiff submits that a hearing on this matter is unlikely to lead to any
further assistance to the Court and therefore requests that the hearing on this motion be waived.

The Plaintiff will provide this figure to YJX’s counsel upon the Court’s granting of the
Plaintiff’s request.

As noted above, the Plaintiff is not objecting the setting aside of the default judgments against
VGJ or YJX, or their transfer to the case pending in the Northern District of Texas. The Plaintiff
only raises an objection to the transfer of the domain names back to VGJ and YJX and requests
reimbursement from YJX.com for the purchase price, commission and other expenses paid in the
sale of the domain name YJX.com. Moreover, the Plaintiff agrees that it will maintain the
status quo and not sell or transfer the domain names VGJ.com or YJX.com.
