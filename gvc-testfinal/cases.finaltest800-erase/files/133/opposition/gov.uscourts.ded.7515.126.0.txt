STATEMENT OF NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS

Plaintiff Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. ("Durkin") filed its Complaint on
March 16, 2004. Defendants the City of Newark ("City"), its Mayor and six City Council
members, (with City, collectively "Newark"), filed an Answer to Complaint,
Counterclaim and Third-Party Claim naming as Third-Party Defendant Federal
Insurance Co. ("Federal"), Plaintiff's surety, for its Contract performance. Federal
answered Newark's Third Party Claim. Original defendant URS Corporation, Inc.
("URS") was dismissed by stipulation whereafter the City filed a Third-Party Complaint
against URS.

Plaintiff filed a Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief and for
Declaratory Judgment and a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Federal filed a brief
in support of Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Both of Plaintiff's
motions were denied.

Federal has again moved for summary judgment and filed its Opening Brief. This

is the City's Answering Brief to Federal's Motion for Summary Judgment.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Durkin unequivocally refused to complete the reservoir project it was hired to
perform, and as a result, the City of Newark terminated its Contract with Durkin. Federal
issued the bond assuring completion of the Reservoir contract. When the contract with
Durkin was terminated for non-performance, the City followed the conditions
enumerated in the performance bond giving rise to Federal's obligation to the City for
completion of the project. But Federal has denied its responsibility under the bond.
Federal is in default of the bond for failing to assure completion of the reservoir project.

In addition, Federal has argued issues of factual ambiguity in the key documents

which would preclude the entry of summary judgment.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The City contracted with Durkin for the construction of its Water Supply
Reservoir (the "Project" or the "Reservoir"). Under its contract with the City, Durkin
was responsible for the means and methods of construction. URS was responsible for the
Reservoir design and oversight of construction activities. Federal provided the
performance bond guaranteeing completion of the reservoir (the "Bond".

As of late summer, early fall of 2003, the Reservoir embankment was
substantially complete and Durkin began installation of the Zone IV soils over the lower
slope of the interior embankment. Durkin contended that the design contained errors and
potential maintenance problems and refused to continue working until the design was
modified, despite clear, multiple directions from the City and URS to proceed per the
design. At an impasse after repeated correspondence on the issue over many weeks, the
City wrote to Durkin on November 20, 2003 (App. B-1, the "November 20 Letter')
stating:

It is extremely disappointing that you remain confused about how to

proceed with construction of the reservoir... You have been provided detail

on various projects built under the same conditions and with the same

materials. This information refutes your claim that the project cannot be

built as designed. In closing, you have given us no other option than to

proceed with notification of your surety of your being in default of our

contract. This notification will take place before the close of business on

November 21, 2003.

On November 21, 2003 the City notified Durkin and Federal of the default

following the language from the Bond. The Bond reads:

3. If there is no Owner Default, the Surety's obligation under the Bond
shall arise after:
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document126 Filed 03/24/2006 Page 7 of 20

3.1 The Owner has notified the Contractor and Surety at its address as
described in Paragraph 10 below, that the Owner is considering
declaring a Contractor default and has requested and attempted to
arrange a conference with the Contractor and the Surety to be held
not later than 15 days after receipt of such notice to discuss methods
of performing the Construction Contract...

(App B-12, Bond, 93.1). The November 21, 2003 letter stated (App. B-13, the
"November 21 Letter''):

On behalf of the City of Newark, Delaware, I am writing to inform you

that we are now considering declaring Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc.

in default of Newark Municipal Contract No. 02-02, pertaining to

Construction of a Municipal Water Supply Reservoir. This precautionary

letter has become necessary following [Durkin]'s failure to present a

response to a means and methods for continuation of the project in

accordance with our contract,

In addition to the requirement of notification that the City was considering
declaring a default, Paragraph 3.1 of the Bond also required that the City arrange a
conference with Durkin and Federal within fifteen days to discuss methods of performing
the construction contract. This required conference occurred on December 9, 2003 (the
"December 9 Meeting"), the earliest availability of Federal's representative.' (App.B-16
and B-17, Deposition of Cavallaro, p. 19, 20). The December 9 Meeting was attended by
the City, Durkin, URS and Federal. A letter sent by counsel for the City to Federal
which memorialized the December 9 Meeting noted: "In the meeting Durkin stated that it

would not continue with placement of Zone IV material, would not protect the exposed

geotextile and would not take any additional measures to address the City's vandalism

 

' Federal is not objecting to the timing of the December 9 Meeting. (App. B-17, Deposition of Cavallaro,
p. 20)

-4-
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document126 Filed 03/24/2006 Page 8 of 20

concems." In addition, a response was requested from Federal "no later than the first
week in January." (App. B-26).

On January 13 and 15 Federal provided engineering reports which called the
reservoir design into question. Federal wrote to the City on January 20 noting that
Federal had no obligation "absent a finding of default and notice of termination of
Durkin's contract" which had not yet occurred. (App. B-29). URS refuted the questions
raised by Federal's engineering reports with its own reports dated January 23 and January
30.

As Federal noted in its January 20 letter, after notification that the City was
considering declaring a default and the occurrence of the conference, the Bond next
required:

3,2 The Owner has declared a Contractor Default and formally

terminated the Contractor's right to complete the Contract. Such
Contractor Default shall not be declared earlier than 20 days after
the Contractor and Surety have received notice as provided in
Subparagraph 3.1...

The City notified Federal and Durkin on February 3, 2004 of Durkin's default and
formally terminated Durkin's Contract (App. B-31, the "February 3 Letter"). The

February 3 Letter stated:

Pursuant to the terms of the Contract" and the Construction Performance
Bond, the City of Newark declares a Contractor default and hereby
formally terminates Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc.'s right to
complete the contract for the Construction of the City of Newark Water
Supply Reservoir. The termination is for cause due to Durkin's refusal to
complete the Work...The City of Newark provided written notice of its
intent to terminate Durkin on November 21, 2003, thereby satisfying the

 

* The Contract states that the "Owner may, after giving CONTRACTOR (and the Surety, if any) seven
days' written notice., terminate the services of CONTRACTOR..." (App. B-33, Contract at $15.2)

5.
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document126 Filed 03/24/2006 Page 9 of 20

notice requirements under Article 15 of the Contract in addition to
satisfying the notice requirements under the Bond.

On February 4, 2004 counsel for the City wrote to Federal and Durkin (App. B-
35, the "February 4 Letter'):

In response to Tuesday's termination letter, I received a call from [counsel
for Durkin] on Wednesday in which he claimed that Durkin had not
refused to complete the contract as per design. This contradicts what we
have been hearing for months. However...if [counsel] or Durkin will state
in writing that Durkin is willing to complete the project "as per design,"
we will agree to suspend the effective date of the termination letter for an
additional seven days...so that we can meet in the interim to discuss how,
and within what time frame and what conditions, Durkin intends to
complete the project....In the event we receive the aforementioned written
notice, our representatives are available to meet on February 12...the
140x2122.or the 160x00B0.

Having received no response ftom Durkin, either written or in the form of
Durkin's presence at the project, on February 10 counsel for the City wrote to Durkin
(App. B-36, the "February 10 Letter"):

Reference is made to [counsel for Newark]'s letter to you and [the surety]
in which he agreed to extend the effective date of the termination letter
(and thereby the date of termination) if a response was received, in
writing, stating that "Durkin is willing to complete the project `as per
design.'" This offer of extension was made to allow opportunity for a
meeting to discuss completion of the project. We have not received a
response to this letter, therefore, termination is still effective today.

On March 16, 2004 Durkin filed its Complaint.

ARGUMENT

1 THE CITY COMPLIED WITH SUBPARAGRAPH 3.1 OF THE
BOND

Paragraph 3.1 of the Bond requires first that the City notify Durkin and Federal
that the City is considering declaring a Contractor Default and second that the City
request and attempt to arrange a conference. Citing the precise language of the Bond, the
City notified Durkin and Federal that it was considering declaring a default in its
November 21 Letter. After reviewing the language of the November 21 Letter regarding
the City's consideration of declaring Durkin in default, Ellen Cavallaro, Federal's
corporate designee, testified:

Q. And that language tracks almost verbatim the language of paragraph
3.1 of your bond, does it not?

A. Yes,

Q. So Federal did receive proper notice that the City was about to declare
Durkin in default as required by paragraph 3.1?

[Counsel for Federal]: Objection to the form.

Q. Correct?

A. They sent me a letter that tracks some of the language that's in the
bond.

Q. Well, do you have any reason to believe that at that point in time this
notice was not in compliance with your paragraph 3.1 of Federal's bond?

A. [had no reason to believe that.

(App. B-16, Deposition of Ellen Cavallaro, p. 19).

The November 21 Letter also stated that the purpose of the upcoming conference
would be to discuss methods for Durkin's completion of the project. Regarding this
portion of the November 21 Letter, Ms. Cavallaro testified:

Q. And that complies with paragraph 3.1 of your bond. Correct?

A. It does not exactly track the language of the bond. It's not verbatim,

but it appears that the intent was to comply with the bond.

QO. Was it Federal's contention that that statement does not comply with
3.1?
