MOTION OF THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT,
FEDERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Third-Party Defendant, Federal Insurance Company ("Federal"), by its counsel,
Stradley, Ronon, Stevens & Young, LLP, moves, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, for summary judgment against Third-Party Plaintiff, City of Newark (the
"City''), as Federal's right to summary relief is clear and no material fact exists to preclude
judgment in Federal's favor. In support thereof, Federal states as follows:

I. BACKGROUND

1. The claims against Federal in this action have been made under a
Performance Bond designated as Bond No. 8128-39-26 (the "Performance Bond"), which
Federal provided to the City of Newark in connection with work to be performed by Plaintiff,
Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. ("Durkin"), pursuant to Durkin's contract with the City for
the construction of a water supply reservoir. A copy of the Performance Bond is attached to the

Declaration of Ellen M. Cavallaro ("Cavallaro Decl."), Exhibit A to Appendix, at Attachment A.
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 ~~ Filed 03/14/2006 Page 2 of 13

2. The Performance Bond was written on a bond form selected and required
by the City. (See Cavallaro Decl. at 95.)

3. In its Third Party Complaint, the City claims that Federal is liable to it
under the Performance Bond. See The City's Answer, Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint
(D.I. 7).

4. Federal can have no liability under the Performance Bond unless the
express conditions precedent to coverage set forth in the Performance Bond selected and
required by the City have been satisfied.

5. Federal can have no liability under the Performance Bond if the City,
designated as the "Owner" in the Performance Bond, has committed an "Owner Default" as
defined by the terms of the bond selected and required by the City.

I. KEY CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS

6. To trigger Federal's obligation under the Performance Bond, the City must
satisfy certain conditions precedent expressly set forth in the Performance Bond and there can be
no "Owner Default." (See Cavallaro Decl., Attachment A at 3.)

7. The Performance Bond clearly specifies:

3, If there is no Owner Default, the Surety's obligation
under this Bond shall arise after:

3.1. The Owner has notified the Contractor and the Surety at its
address described in Paragraph 10 below, that the Owner is
considering declaring a Contractor Default and has requested
and attempted to arrange a conference with the Contractor and
the Surety to be held not later than fifteen days after receipt of
such notice to discuss methods of performing the Construction
Contract. If the Owner, the Contractor and the Surety agree, the
Contractor shall be allowed a reasonable time to perform the
Construction Contract, but such an agreement shall not waive
the Owner's night, if any, subsequent to declare a Contractor
Default; and
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 Filed 03/14/2006 Page 3of 13

3.2. The Owner has declared a Contractor Default and formally
terminated the Contractor's right to complete the contract.
Such Contractor Default shall not be declared earlier than
twenty days after the Contractor and the Surety have received
notice as provided in Subparagraph 3.1.

8. The Performance Bond defines the "Owner" as the City and "Owner
Default" as follows:
Failure of the Owner, which has neither been remedied nor
waived, to pay the Contractor as required by the

Construction Contract or to perform and complete or
comply with the other terms thereof.

Id. at (12.4.

9. Federal's obligation under the Performance Bond does not arise unless the
express conditions set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Performance Bond are satisfied and can never
arise if there is an "Owner Default."

10. _In particular, Subparagraph 3.1 of the Performance Bond requires that the
City notify Federal and Durkin that the City is "considering declaring a Contractor Default and
has requested and attempted to arrange a conference" to be held not later than 15 days after
receipt of the notice "to discuss methods of performing the Construction Contract." Id. at $3.1.

11. Subparagraph 3.2 of the Performance Bond requires that the City declare a
"Contractor Default" (as defined in Subparagraph 12.4 of the Performance Bond) and formally
terminate Durkin's right to complete the Construction Contract. Id. at 493.2 and 12.4.

12. | Durkin's Construction Contract with the City (the "Construction
Contract") authorizes the City to terminate Durkin's right to complete the contract for cause,

only after the City provides Federal with seven days' written notice prior to terminating the
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 Filed 03/14/2006 Page 4of 13

Construction Contract.' A copy of section 15.2 of the Construction Contract is attached to the
Cavallaro Decl. as Attachment B.

13. As set forth more fully below and in Federal's Opening Brief filed
herewith, because the City failed to meet the express conditions precedent to Federal's obligation
under the Performance Bond, and since the City committed an Owner Default under the terms of
the Performance Bond, Federal has no obligation to the City under the Performance Bond and is
therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Tl. THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE CITY AND DURKIN

14.` In early 2002, the City advertised for competitive bids for the construction
of the reservoir and ultimately awarded Durkin the Construction Contract. By late 2002, Durkin
began working on the reservoir site.

15. Thereafter, a dispute arose between Durkin and the City regarding the
constructability and safety of the reservoir's design." (Cavallaro Decl. at 0x00A76.)

16. | While discussions between the City and Durkin were ongoing, on
November 21, 2003, the City sent a letter to Federal, in which the City stated that it was

"considering declaring" Durkin in default and requested a meeting to take place within 15 days

 

1 Section 15.2 of the Construction Contract states:

OWNER may, after giving CONTRACTOR (and the Surety, if any,) seven
days' written notice and to the extent permitted by Laws and Regulations,
terminate the services of CONTRACTOR, exclude CONTRACTOR from the
site and take possession of the Work and of all CONTRACTOR's tools,
appliances, construction equipment and machinery at the site and use the same
to the full extent they could be used by CONTRACTOR (without liability to
CONTRACTOR) for trespass or conversion), ....

 

(emphasis added).
2 The dispute between Durkin and the City is not material to Federal's motion for summary judgment. That
dispute merely provides context for the City's claim under the Performance Bond. The merits of the City-Durkin
dispute are irrelevant to the City's failure to comply with the conditions precedent to coverage under the
Performance Bond and are not at issue in this motion.

to discuss methods for the completion of the project.? A copy of the November 21, 2003 letter is
attached to the Cavallaro Decl. as Attachment C.
IV. THE CITY'S FAILURE TO SATISFY THE
CONDITION PRECEDENT REQUIREMENTS OF
SUBPARAGRAPH 3.1 OF THE PERFORMANCE BOND
ENTITLES FEDERAL TO JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW

17. The conference required by Subparagraph 3.1 of the Performance Bond to
discuss methods of performing the Construction Contract - which was requested by the City's
November 21, 2003 letter - never took place. Instead, representatives of the City, Durkin and
Federal held an "off the record" settlement meeting on December 9, 2003. (See Cavallaro Decl.
at Attachment D.) This meeting did not satisfy the requirements of Subparagraph 3.1 of the
Performance Bond.

18. The Agenda provided by the City for the settlement meeting expressly
states that "All conversations during the meeting shall be in the nature of settlement negotiations,
and shall be inadmissible in any future proceeding." A copy of the December 9, 2003
Meeting Agenda is attached to the Cavallaro Decl. as Attachment D.

19. The City never thereafter requested the conference required by

Subparagraph 3.1 of the Performance Bond and no such conference ever took place. (See

Cavallaro Decl. at $17.)

 

> The November 21, 2003 letter provided:

On behalf of the City of Newark, Delaware, J am writing to inform you that we
are now considering declaring Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. (DMD) in
default of Newark Municipal Contract No. 02-02, pertaining to Construction of
a Municipal Water Supply Reservoir. This precautionary letter has become
necessary following DMD's failure to present a response to a means and
methods for continuation of the project in accordance with our Contract.

As provided in the DMD Performance Bond on file with the City, we are
requesting that a conference be held including Surety representatives, DMD,
URS Corporation representatives and the City of Newark. This meeting shall
take place within fifteen (15) days of your receipt of this letter. The intent of the
meeting will be to discuss methods for DMD's faithful completion of this
Contract consistent with its agreement with the City.

(emphasis added).

Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 Filed 03/14/2006 Page 6 of 13

20. The City completely failed to comply with Subparagraph 3.1 of the
Performance Bond. In order for Federal's obligation to arise under the terms of the Performance
Bond, the City first had to arrange a conference with Durkin and Federal "to discuss methods of
performing the Construction Contract." (See Cavallaro Decl., Attachment A at 93.) Pursuant to
the City's Performance Bond, if the City, Federal and Durkin were to agree on methods for
performing the Construction Contract, Durkin would be "allowed a reasonable time to complete
the Construction Contract." Id. 43.1.

21. | The conference required by the express terms of Subparagraph 3.1 of the
Performance Bond never happened. The City's own Agenda for the December 9, 2003 meeting
that took place in response to the City's November 21, 2003 letter establishes that such meeting
was not a conference "to discuss methods of performing the Construction Contract" pursuant to
Subparagraph 3.1 of the Performance Bond. (See Cavallaro Decl. at Attachment D.) Instead, it
was an "off the record" settlement meeting. Id. The City's broad language precluding use of the
discussions in "any future proceeding" encompasses any proceeding related to the Performance
Bond, including the instant lawsuit.

22. The City can point to no genuine issues of material fact that would
preclude the entry of summary judgment in Federal's favor on this basis alone because there is
no dispute that the only meeting attended by the City, Durkin and Federal during the time period
from November 21, 2003 to February 2, 2004 was the December 9, 2003 settlement meeting.
Federal never refused to attend any meeting requested by the City pursuant to Subparagraph 3.1
of the Performance Bond or otherwise. (See Cavallaro Decl. at 418.) That meeting was - by the
City's own terms - an "off the record" settlement meeting, and what transpired at that meeting

was in the "nature of settlement negotiations" and "inadmissible in any future proceeding." Id.
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 ~~ Filed 03/14/2006 Page 7 of 13

23. Because the meeting required by Subparagraph 3.1 of the City's
Performance Bond form never took place, Federal was deprived of the opportunity to discuss
with the City and Durkin the "methods of performing the Construction Contract," a discussion
required by the terms of the bond itself.
24. Federal is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the
City's failure to comply with the express conditions precedent set forth in Subparagraph 3.1 of
the Performance Bond.
V. THE CITY'S FAILURE TO DECLARE A CONTRACTOR
DEFAULT AND PROVIDE FEDERAL WITH SEVEN DAYS?'
WRITTEN NOTICE PRIOR TO TERMINATING DURKIN'S

RIGHT TO COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT
ENTITLES FEDERAL TO JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW

25. Following the December 9, 2003 settlement meeting and pursuant to the
agreement of the City, Durkin and Federal, Federal engaged a geotechnical engineering
consultant to review the issues disputed by Durkin and the City. (See Cavallaro Decl. at 412.)

26. On January 20, 2004, Federal submitted two reports from their
geotechnical consultant to the City. Id. at 414. Instead of responding to the consultant's reports
and thereby providing Federal with contractually-required opportunity to discuss with the City
and Durkin the "methods of performing the Construction Contract," the City simply fired
Durkin.

27. OnFebruary 2, 2004, City Council convened and - without any notice to

Federal - at 11:00 p.m. voted unanimously to terminate Durkin.* Council adjourned the meeting

 

* City Council's minutes reflect:

MOTION BY MR. GODWIN, SECONDED BY MR. CLIFTON: That Donald
M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. be terminated immediately from further
involvement in the construction of the Newark Water Reservoir based on its
refusal to perform under its Contract with the City of Newark; and that legal
counsel for the City promptly and properly notified Donald M. Durkin
Contracting, Inc. and the Surety of Durkin, of the termination and demand that
said Surety fulfill its lawful obligations under its Bond with Durkin.

one minute later. A copy of the relevant portion of the City Council Meeting Minutes is attached
to the Cavallaro Decl. as Attachment E.

28.  Thenext day, February 3, 2004, City Manager Carl Luft sent a letter to
Federal and Durkin, in which Mr. Luft stated that "the City of Newark declares a Contractor
Default and hereby formally terminates Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc.'s ("Durkin") right to
complete the Contract for the Construction of the City of Newark Water Supply Reservoir." A
copy of the February 3, 2004 letter is attached to the Cavallaro Decl. as Attachment F.

29. Instark contrast to the November 21, 2003 letter from the City, the City's
February 3, 2004 letter unequivocally states that Durkin's rights under the Construction Contract
were immediately terminated. The February 3, 2004 letter, therefore, did not provide Federal
with the seven days' notice prior to termination as required by section 15.2 of the Construction
Contract and Subparagraph 3.2 of the Performance Bond. (See Cavallaro Decl. at Attachments
A, B and F.)

30. Termination of a construction contract without providing the proper notice
and opportunity to cure "is itself a material breach of contract." 5 Bruner and O'Connor on
Construction Law 0x00A7 18:15.

31. The City's February 3, 2004 letter failed to provide the requisite seven
days' written notice to Federal as required by the terms of the Construction Contract and the
Performance Bond and, therefore, constitutes an "Owner Default" as defined in Subparagraph
12.4 of the Performance Bond.

32. The absence of an "Owner Default" is a condition precedent to the City's
right to coverage under the Performance Bond. (See Cavallaro Decl., Attachment A at 93 (Tf

there is no Owner Default, the Surety's obligations shall arise after... .").)
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 Filed 03/14/2006 Page 9 of 13

33. | The commission by the City of the foregoing Owner Default precludes
any recovery by it under the Performance Bond and entitles Federal to judgment as a matter of
law.

34.  Inits February 3, 2004 termination letter, the City claims that its
November 21, 2003 letter constitutes the requisite seven day notice prior to termination. (See
Cavallaro Decl. at Attachment F.) However, to be a proper notice of termination, the law
requires the City to provide a detailed notice that apprises Durkin and Federal of the particular
defaults that must be cured and of the City's actual intention to terminate Durkin's right to
complete the Construction Contract in seven days. The November 21 letter does not come close
to providing the required notice. (See Cavallaro Decl. at Attachment C.)

35. Inparticular, the November 21, 2003 letter from the City:

e did not state that Durkin is in default;
0x00B0 did not describe any particular defaults in Durkin's work;

0x00B0 did not declare any intention to terminate Durkin's nght to
complete the Construction Contract; and

0x00B0 did not even use the very word "terminate."

34. The City's November 21, 2003 letter simply was not a notice to terminate.
The City's November 21, 2003 letter, by its own terms, merely was a "precautionary letter" that
stated that the City is "now considering declaring ... Durkin... in default... ." The City's
letter was not even a declaration of default, let alone a legally sufficient notice of termination.
Indeed, it did not even use the word "terminate." Id.

35. Anotice of termination cannot hang over a contractor's head indefinitely.
The right to terminate a contract must be exercised in a timely fashion, and if the notice grows

stale, itis void. See, e.g., DeVito v. United States, 413 F.2d 1147, 1153 (Ct. Cl. 1969).

-9.
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document122 ~~ Filed 03/14/2006 Page 10 of 13

36. Here, the February 3, 2004 termination letter issued nearly 2% months (73
days) after the so-called November 21, 2003 "notice" letter from the City's manager.

37. Assuming arguendo that Durkin was in default as of November 21, 2003
and assuming arguendo that the November 21, 2003 letter satisfied the notice requirement of
section 15.2 of the Construction Contract (which it does not), the February 3, 2004 termination
letter is still not effective to properly default terminate Durkin's rights under the Construction
Contract because it was untimely as a matter of law.

38. The November 21, 2003 letter cannot simultaneously function as the
notice of consideration of default under the Performance Bond and the required seven day notice
of default termination to Federal under the Construction Contract and as required under
Subparagraph 3.2 of the Performance Bond. The purposes of these two notices are different and
the Performance Bond requires that these notices be separated by at least twenty (20) days. (See
Performance Bond at 43.2.)

39. By failing to properly declare a Contractor Default and by failing to
provide Federal with the requisite seven days' written notice prior to formally terminating
Durkin's right to complete the Construction Contract, the City failed to satisfy the condition
precedent to coverage set forth in Subparagraph 3.2 of the Performance Bond.

40. The City's failure to satisfy the conditions precedent to Federal's

obligation under the Performance Bond entitles Federal to judgment as a matter of law.
