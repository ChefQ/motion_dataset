Civil Action No. 3:17-cv-00005
Honorable Kim R. Gibson

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
Defendant, Altoona Student Transportation, Inc., by and through its undersigned counsel,
files the following Memorandum of Law in Support of its Renewed Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings.1
This case involves amendments to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Child Protective
Services Law. The amendments to this law required – for the first time – that all “school
employees” who have “direct contact with children” in Pennsylvania must submit to a criminal
background check. One of the mandatory steps in this criminal background check involves
submitting to fingerprinting. It is undisputed in this matter that Plaintiff informed Defendant that
she had religious objections to the fingerprinting requirement of the criminal background check.
Plaintiff requested several accommodations based on her religious objections.

However,

Plaintiff’s requested accommodations required Defendant to violate the Child Protective Services
Law, putting Defendant at risk of civil and criminal sanctions.

1

Defendant files this Renewed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings to address Plaintiff’s
Amended Complaint, which added a claim under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.
(ECF No. 14).

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 2 of 15

It is well-established that employers are not required to provide employees with
accommodations that violate state or federal law. Since Plaintiff’s requested accommodations
were in violation of state law, and Plaintiff’s religiously-based restrictions could not otherwise be
accommodated under the Child Protective Services Law, Plaintiff cannot set forth a claim against
Defendant under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Pennsylvania Human Relations
Act for failure to accommodate Plaintiff’s religious beliefs or for retaliation. As such, Defendant
respectfully requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint based on the pleadings, with
prejudice.
I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Defendant is a school bus transportation company located in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

ECF No. 14 at ¶ 4. In August 2001, Defendant hired Plaintiff as a school bus driver for the
Altoona School District. ECF No. 16 at ¶ 7. Effective December 31, 2015, Plaintiff – as a
school employee with “direct contact with children” – was required to pass a criminal
background check pursuant to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, which required
Plaintiff to submit to fingerprinting. ECF No. 14 at ¶ 8; ECF No. 16 at ¶ 8.
Plaintiff notified Defendant that fingerprinting violates her Christian religious belief and
requested an accommodation.

ECF No. 14 at ¶ 9.

Plaintiff’s requested accommodations

included, among others, a request for a different form of background check that did not involve
fingerprinting. ECF No. 14 at ¶ 9; ECF No. 16 at ¶ 9. In support of her request, Plaintiff stated
that she believes that the Book of Revelations prohibits the “mark of the devil,” and that
submitting to fingerprinting will prohibit her from getting into Heaven. ECF No. 14 at ¶ 10.
Upon receiving Plaintiff’s request for accommodation, Defendant attempted to work with
Plaintiff, as well as the Altoona School District, a local lawmaker, legal counsel for the

2

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 3 of 15

Pennsylvania Department of Education, and, indirectly, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
to determine an accommodation for Plaintiff’s religious beliefs that would comply with the Child
Protective Services Law. ECF No. 16 at ¶ 9. After investigating each of Plaintiff’s requested
accommodations – including Plaintiff’s request for an alternative background check – Defendant
determined, in good faith, and with direct guidance and instruction from those responsible for
enforcing the Child Protective Service Law, that each of Plaintiff’s requested accommodations
did not comply with the Child Protective Services Law. ECF No. 16 at ¶ 9.
Without any legal accommodation available to Plaintiff, Defendant was left with no other
choice but to administratively suspend Plaintiff on December 31, 2015. ECF No. 16 at ¶ 11.
II.

ARGUMENT
Federal Rule of Civil Procedures 12(c) provides that “after the pleadings are closed – but

early enough not to delay trial – a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.” The standard
applied to motion for judgment on the pleadings is not materially different from the standard
applied to a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).
Pa. General Energy Co., LLC v. Grant Twp., 139 F. Supp.3d 706, 711 (W.D. Pa. 2015) (citing
Zion v. Nassan, 283 F.R.D. 247, 254 (W.D. Pa. 2012)). Either motion may be used to seek the
dismissal of a complaint based on the plaintiff’s failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. Id. The only difference between the two motions is the time of filing – motions to
dismiss are filed before a responsive pleading is filed, whereas motions for judgment on the
pleading are filed after the pleadings are closed. Id.
The U.S. Supreme Court has articulated the now well-known standard for considering
motions to dismiss in their seminal cases Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)
and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Pursuant to these cases, a complaint must be

3

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 4 of 15

dismissed if it does not allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. The Third Circuit has set forth a two part-analysis for reviewing
motions to dismiss in light of Twombly and Iqbal, the same standard that should be applied to
determining motions for judgment on the pleadings. First, the factual and legal elements of a
claim should be separated. A district court must accept all of the complaint’s well-pleaded facts
as true, but should disregard any legal conclusions. Second, a district court must determine
whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a “plausible
claim for relief.” Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009).
In other words, “a complaint must do more than allege the plaintiff’s entitlement to relief.
A complaint has to ‘show’ such an entitlement with its facts.” Id. at 211 (citing Phillips v. Cnty.
of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234–35 (3d Cir. 2008)). “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not
permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has
alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679
(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).
Recognizing that this Motion is made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c),
in making this analysis, the Court should consider not only the Complaint, but also the Answer,
and all exhibits attached to the pleadings. Pa. General Energy Co., LLC, 139 F. Supp.3d at 711712 (citations omitted).
A.

The Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Act.

In 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended its Child Protective Services Law
to, inter alia, require extensive background checking requirements for “school employees.”

4

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 5 of 15

23 Pa. C.S. § 6344, et seq.2

The newly amended law defined “school employee” as “an

individual who is employed by a school or who provides a program, activity, or service
sponsored by a school. The term does not apply to administrative or other support personnel
unless the administrative or other support personnel has direct contact with children.”
23 Pa. C.S. § 6303 (a) (emphasis added). In turn, the law defined “direct contact with children”
as “the care, supervision, guidance or control of children, or routine interaction with children,”
without providing further definition of these terms. Id.
Individuals who met the definition of “school employee” were required to submit the
following information to their employers:
(1) A report of criminal history information from the Pennsylvania State Police
or a statement from the Pennsylvania State Police that the State Police central
repository contains no such information relating to that person.
(2) A certification from the Department of Health Services as to whether the
applicant is named in the Statewide database as the alleged perpetrator in a
pending child abuse investigation or as the perpetrator of a founded report or
an indicated report.
(3) A report of Federal criminal history record information.
23 Pa.C.S. § 6344 (b) (emphasis added).

To obtain the federal criminal history record

information, the school employee was required to submit a full set of fingerprints to the
Pennsylvania State Police, who would then submit the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for the purpose of verifying the identity of the individual and obtaining a current
record of any criminal arrests and convictions. Id. at (b)(3). These background checking
requirements became effective December 31, 2014 for newly hired school employees, and
December 31, 2015 for school employees who currently did not have a certification or who were
2

All applicable provisions of the Child Protective Services Law in effect in December
2015 are incorporated into the pleadings at ECF No. 16-1.

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 6 of 15

not previously required to submit to background checking requirements. Id. (relating to newly
hired employees); 23 Pa.C.S. § 6344.4 (1)(iv) (relating to all other school employees).
Employers are mandated to require school employees to submit the required
documentation and certifications for their background checks.

23 Pa.C.S. § 6344(b.2).

Employers who fail to do so commit a third-degree misdemeanor. Id. Further, an individual
employed by the employer who is responsible for making employment decisions and:
who willfully fails to comply with the provisions of section 6344 (relating to employees
having direct contact with children…) commits a violation of this chapter and shall be
subject to a civil penalty as provided in this subsection. The department shall have
jurisdiction to determine violations of section 6344 and may, following a hearing, assess
a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500. The civil penalty shall be payable to the
Commonwealth.
23 Pa.C.S. § 6349 (c). As a result, both criminal and civil penalties attach for violations of the
Child Protective Services Law.3
B.

Employers Have No Obligation to Provide Accommodations that Violate
State or Federal Laws.

Title VII provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to
discriminate against an individual with respect to conditions of employment because of their
religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).4 The term “religion” includes “includes all aspects of religious
observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that [they are]
3

Notably, there is no indication – either from the Commonwealth or the legislature – that
such penalties would not result from a willful violation of the Child Protective Service
Law.

4

Pennsylvania courts generally interpret the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act in
accordance with its federal counterparts. Prise v. Alderwoods Grp., Inc., 657 F. Supp. 2d
564, 586 (W.D. Pa. 2009) (citing Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 105 (3d Cir. 1996);
Stultz v. Reese Bros, Inc., 835 A.2d 754, 759 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003)). As such, Plaintiff’s
claims for religious discrimination and accommodation under the PHRA should be
interpreted under the same standard as applied to Title VII religious discrimination and
accommodation claims. Prise, 657 F. Supp. 2d at 586. See, also Wilkerson v. New
Media Tech. Charter Sch., Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 319 (W.D. Pa. 2008).

6

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 7 of 15

unable to reasonably accommodate an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious
observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” 42
U.S.C. § 2000e(j).5
To establish a claim for religious discrimination, Plaintiff must establish that: (1) she held
a bona fide or sincere religious belief that conflicted with an employment requirement; (2) she
informed Defendant of this belief; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action for failing
to comply with the conflicting employment requirement. Shelton v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry of
N.J., 223 F.3d 220, 224 (3d Cir. 2000).
Plaintiff is unable to satisfy this prima facie burden. Plaintiff cannot establish that she
held a “religious” belief protected by Title VII. As the Third Circuit has noted, the definition of
religion under Title VII includes a consideration of whether an employer is able to accommodate
the religious belief without undue hardship. Therefore, “… if an employer cannot accommodate
religious practice without undue hardship, the practice is not ‘religion’ under Title VII.” U.S. v.
Bd. of Educ. for the Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 911 F.2d 882, 886 (3d Cir. 1990). As discussed
below, Defendant was unable to accommodate Plaintiff’s purported religious beliefs without
being subjected to undue hardship. Defendant’s inability to accommodate Plaintiff’s religious
belief takes Plaintiff’s religion outside of the protections of Title VII.
Further, Plaintiff’s prima facie case fails because Plaintiff did not fail to comply with an
“employment requirement” that conflicted with her purported religious belief, but a requirement
of Pennsylvania law. See Yisrael v. Per Scholas, Inc., No. 01 Civ. 8290 (DAB), 2004 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 5807, *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2004) (citing Sutton v. Providence St. Joseph Med. Ctr., 192

5

The term “religious creed” is not defined in the PHRA. See 43 P.S. § 954. As such,
courts have applied the Title VII definition of “religion” to this term. Prise, 657 F. Supp.
2d at 586.

F.3d 826 (9th Cir. 1999); Seaworth v. Pearson, 203 F.3d 1056 (8th Cir. 2000), cert denied, 531
U.S. 895 (2000); Baltgalvis v. Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., 132 F. Supp. 2d 414 (E.D. Va.
2001), aff’d, 15 F. App’x 172 (4th Cir. 2001); EEOC v. Allendale Nursing Centre, 996 F. Supp.
712 (W.D. Mich. 1998)) (“The Internal Revenue Service, not the employer, imposes the
requirement that an employee provide a Social Security number (SNN) for tax withholding
purposes . . . Therefore, an employee’s religious belief against using his SSN conflicts not with
an employment requirement, but with federal law. As a result, federal courts that have addressed
this precise issue have agreed that an employee is not able to establish a prima facie case of
religious discrimination based in an employer’s insistence that the employee provide a SSN for
tax withholding purposes[,]”).6 As a result, Plaintiff’s prima facie case fails as a matter of law.
Even if Plaintiff is able to satisfy the prima facie case, Plaintiff still cannot set forth a
Title VII claim based on religious accommodation. Even assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiff is
able to satisfy her prima facie burden – which Defendant maintains she cannot – the burden
shifts to Defendant to show “either it made a good-faith effort to reasonably accommodate the
religious belief, or such an accommodation would work an undue hardship for the employer and
its business.” Webb v. City of Phila., 562 F.3d 256, 259 (3d Cir. 2009).7

6

It is Defendant’s position that there is no discernible difference between the line of
religious discrimination cases addressing the use of Social Security numbers and the
fingerprinting requirement at issue in this case. Under both circumstances, employers are
mandated by binding state or federal law and regulation to submit information to the
government for governmental review and oversight.
As in the case of Social Security numbers, it is not within an individual employer’s
authority to waive application of a legal requirement to a particular employee on any
basis, without direct approval by the government. Despite repeated requests for an
accommodation for Plaintiff, the Commonwealth refused, as discussed below.

7

The Third Circuit has not yet ruled whether religious discrimination cases of this kind
should be considered under a prima facie analysis or an undue hardship analysis. Despite
8

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 9 of 15

An accommodation would constitute an undue hardship on an employer if it would
present more than a de minimus cost to the employer. Webb, 562 F.3d at 259 (citing Trans
World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 84 (1977)). In making this determination, courts
consider both economic and non-economic costs on the employer. Webb, 562 F.3d at 260. Noneconomic costs include the threat of possible criminal sanctions. Id. at 891 (citing U.S. v. Bd. of
Educ. for the Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 911 F.2d 882 (3d Cir. 1990)). Some courts have also
considered the effect a requested accommodation might have on the business’s reputation. See
EEOC v. Sambo’s of Georgia, Inc., 530 F. Supp. 86, 90 (N.D. Ga 1981). Both this Court and its
sister courts have routinely held that where an employee’s requested accommodation conflicts
with a requirement imposed by state or federal law, an employee’s Title VII religious
discrimination claim fails as an undue hardship.8

the circuit split that currently exists on this issue, Defendant does not believe that a
determination is necessary in this case, as Plaintiff’s claim is defeated under either
analysis.
8

See, e.g., Yeager v. FirstEnergy Generation Corp., 777 F.3d 362, 363 (6th Cir. 2015)
(noting that there is nothing in Title VII’s text that “might license an employer to
disregard other federal statutes in the name of reasonably accommodating an employee’s
religious practitioners); Tagore v. United States, 735 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir. 2013) (in
considering an IRS employee’s request to wear a religiously symbolic knife in a federal
office building, the court held that since “the IRS is not authorized to determine security
requirements of federal buildings, it cannot be deemed legally responsible for
discriminating against [the employee]. Requiring IRS to override the DHS/FPS would
place the revenue agency in the positon of violating federal law concerning the
introduction of ‘dangerous weapons’ into federal buildings. An employer need not
accommodate an employee’s religious practice by violating other laws.”); Seaworth v.
Pearson, 203 F.3d 1056, 1057 (8th Cir. 2000) (“Requiring defendants to violate the
Internal Revenue Code and subject themselves to potential penalties by not providing
Seaworth’s SSN on information returns results in undue hardship,” citing penalties for
failure to provide SSN); Sutton v. Providence St. Joseph Med. Ctr., 192 F.3d 826, 830
(9th Cir. 1999) (“Although they have disagreed on the rationale, courts agree that an
employer is not liable under Title VII when accommodating an employee’s religious
beliefs would require the employer to violate federal or state law.”); Weber v. Leaseway
Dedicated Logistics, Inc., No. 98-3172, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 220, *5-6 (10th Cir.
9

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 10 of 15

Plaintiff’s case is factually similar to the U.S. v. Board of Education case. Alima Delores
Reardon was a devout Muslim woman who believed that Muslim women should cover their
entire bodies, except their face and hands, when in public. U.S. v. Board of Education, 911 F. 3d
at 884. Reardon worked as a substitute teacher, and was informed by several school principals
that, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Garb Statute, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 11-1112, she was not
permitted to wear religious clothing while teaching. Id. at 885. The Board of Education argued
that Reardon’s requested accommodation – allowing her to teach in her religiously-mandated
clothing – could not be accomplished without undue hardship. Id. at 887. The Board of
Education argued that it had no choice but to comply with the Garb Statute, and that failing to do
so would have been an under hardship as it went about the business of running a school district.
Id. at 890-91. The Third Circuit agreed, stating that “it would be an undue hardship to require
[the Board of Education] to violate an apparently valid criminal statute, thereby exposing its
administrators to criminal prosecution and the possible consequences thereof.” Id. at 891.
C.

Plaintiff’s Requested Accommodation Violates the Pennsylvania Child
Protective Services Act.

As a school bus driver, Plaintiff’s employment undisputedly fell under the ambit of the
Child Protective Services Law. Plaintiff provided a service to a school – the Altoona School
Jan. 7, 1999) (“To require an employer to subject itself to potential fines also results in
undue hardship.”); Bhatia v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 734 F.2d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1984)
(“An employer may prove that an employee’s proposal would involve undue hardship by
showing that either its impact on coworkers or its cost would be more than de minimis.”);
Baltgalvis v. Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., 132 F. Supp. 2d 414,419 (E.D. Va. 2001),
aff’d, 15 F. App’x 172 (4th Cir. 2001) (“Courts have consistently agreed that an employer
is not liable under Title VII when accommodating an employee’s religious beliefs would
require the employer to violate state or federal law.”); Hill v. Promise Hosp. of Phoenix,
Inc., No. 09-cv-1958-PHX-JAT, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68884, *21 (D. Ariz. July 8,
2010) (“By requiring the [employer] to accommodate the employee by waiving the
mandatory provision of social security number, the [employer] would violate federal and
state laws. . . . As such, it would cause ‘undue hardship’ as a matter of law.”).

10

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 11 of 15

District – that required her to have direct contact with children.9

As such, effective

December 31, 2015, Defendant was mandated to require Plaintiff to submit the requisite
documentation and certifications, including fingerprint records. Failure to do so would place
Defendant in direct violation of the Child Protective Services Law – and, therefore, subject both
Defendant and certain of its employees to criminal and civil sanctions. 10
Although Plaintiff’s Complaint only focuses on her request to be provided an alternative
method of background checking, Plaintiff actually requested three potential accommodations.
Namely, Plaintiff requested (1) an alternative method of background checking; (2) a waiver of
the background checking requirement because Plaintiff’s bus was equipped with a camera; or
(3) a waiver of the background checking requirement and allowing Plaintiff to drive with another
individual who had cleared the background checking requirements. Notably, each of these
requested accommodations is not truly an accommodation, but an attempt to obviate and avoid
the requirements of the Child Protective Services Law.11

9

Plaintiff does not appear to dispute that she was a “school employee” with “direct contact
with children.” ECF No. 14 at ¶ 8. Instead, Plaintiff’s sole dispute appears to be with
whether an accommodation was available for her religious belief.

10

Notably, any failure by Defendant’s to require Plaintiff to submit to the background
checking requirements of the Child Protective Service Law would also place their client –
the Altoona School District – in violation of the Child Protective Service Law, and
therefore liable for criminal and civil penalties.

11

See, generally Cherry v. Sunoco, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72755 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 17,
2009). Cherry, a member of the Church of the True and Living God, objected on
religious grounds to posing for pictures and to having his picture taken. Id. at *3.
Cherry’s beliefs conflicted with the federal Maritime Transportation Safety Act, which
required Cherry to carry a photo ID. Id. at *6. In deciding whether Sunoco would be
subject to undue hardship for accommodating Cherry’s religious beliefs, the court
considered Cherry’s proposed accommodations, including (1) having a supervisor verify
his identity; (2) showing his non-photo driver’s license in conjunction with a non-photo
employee ID; (3) being escorted to his work location; and (4) using biometric
identification. The court noted that these requests – in addition to not being reasonable
11

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 12 of 15

Nevertheless, rather than relying only on the face of the statute, Defendant diligently
reviewed each of these requested accommodations.

As discussed above, as part of its

investigation, Defendant contacted the Altoona School District, a local Pennsylvania lawmaker,
and the Pennsylvania Department of Education – who in turn contacted the Federal Bureau of
Investigation – for guidance and a possible exemption.
After a diligent and good faith attempt to accommodate Plaintiff, Defendant determined
that it could not offer Plaintiff any of her requested accommodations, nor were any other
accommodations available. There were no provisions of the Child Protective Service Law that
allowed for alternative background checking, nor were there any provisions that addressed
electronic or in-person surveillance.12 Further, the Commonwealth was unwilling to provide
Plaintiff with an exemption to the background checking requirements on the basis of her
religious beliefs.13

under a Title VII analysis – were also methods of circumventing the photo ID
requirement and sought to “obviate the need for Plaintiff to pose for and carry a photo
ID.” Id. at *25. The court noted, however, that Sunoco “could not accept any of these
suggested accommodations without violating” the Maritime Transportation Safety Act
and its regulations. Id. See also Sambo’s of Ga., Inc., 530 F. Supp. at 90 (noting that
plaintiff’s requests for accommodation were in fact “not a demand for an accommodation
but a demand for outright exemption.”).
12

Under the current version of the Child Protective Services Law, this remains the case.

13

To the extent Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks to set forth a disparate treatment claim, this
claim would also fail. In order to prove religious discrimination through disparate
treatment, Plaintiff must show that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she
suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) nonmembers of the protected class
received more favorable treatment. Abramson v. William Paterson College, 260 F.3d
265, 281-82 (3d Cir. 2001).
As an initial matter, Defendant did not have the authority or discretion to provide any
employee – including Plaintiff – with an exemption to the background checking
requirements of the Child Protective Services Law. Such authority and discretion was
solely held by the Commonwealth and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Additionally,
12

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 13 of 15

Because the Commonwealth was unwilling to offer Plaintiff an exemption to the
background checking requirements, Defendant was without any choice but to administratively
suspend Plaintiff, pending cooperation with the background checking requirements. To do
otherwise would cause an undue hardship on Defendant and its business.
D.

Plaintiff’s Retaliation Claim Fails as a Matter of Law.

To state a claim for retaliation under Title VII, Plaintiff has the burden of establishing a
prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII by showing that: “(1) she engaged in activity
protected by Title VII; (2) [Defendant] took an adverse employment action against her; and
(3) there was a causal connection between her participation in the protected activity and the
adverse employment action.” Moore v. City of Phila., 461 F.3d 331, 340-41 (3d Cir. 2006).14 If
the Plaintiff establishes this prima facie case of retaliation, the familiar McDonnell Douglas
approach applies in which “the burden shifts to [Defendant] to advance a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its conduct and, if it does so, the plaintiff must be able to convince the
factfinder both that [Defendant’s] proffered explanation was false, and that retaliation was the
real reason for the adverse employment action.” Id. at 342.

Plaintiff is not similarly-situated to Defendant’s other employees who were provided
alternative background checking methods.
These employees submitted to the
fingerprinting requirements of the Child Protective Services Law, and were told that their
fingerprints were not detectable after multiple failed attempts. ECF No. 16, at ¶ 12.
Once again, Defendant did not make the decision to provide an exemption to the
fingerprinting requirement for these individuals. Instead, Commonwealth and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation provided this exemption.
14

Title VII’s anti-retaliation provisions are interpreted coextensively with the PHRA's antiretaliation provisions. See, generally Prise, 657 F. Supp. 2d at 605 (citing Marra v.
Phila. Hous. Auth., 497 F.3d 286, 300 (3d Cir. 2007)). As such, the analysis provided in
this section under Title VII applies equally to Plaintiff’s PHRA retaliation claim.

13

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 18 Filed 04/17/17 Page 14 of 15

For the purposes of this Motion only, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff will likely satisfy
her prima facie burden.15 Accordingly, the burden shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate,
non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff’s administrative suspension. As discussed throughout this
Motion, Defendant administratively suspended Plaintiff in a good faith belief that
accommodating her religious beliefs violated the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.
Defendant reached this good faith belief after consultation with the Altoona School District, a
local lawmaker, legal counsel for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, and, indirectly,
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As such, Defendant has satisfied its burden to establish
a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its actions.
The burden would then shift to Plaintiff to convince the fact-finder that this proffered
reason is pretext for discrimination. Based on Plaintiff’s Complaint, it does not appear that
Plaintiff contests that this reason was pretext for discrimination. ECF No. 14 at ¶ 8. (“In
November 2015, Defendant informed Kaite that pursuant to a recently enacted state law, she was
to undergo a criminal background check, which included her being fingerprinted.”); Id. at ¶ 10.
(“Despite Kaite’s request for accommodation for her religious beliefs, Defendant informed her
on or around December 30, 2015 that no accommodations were available and that due to her
failure to comply with the fingerprinting requirement she was terminated effective December 31,
2015.”).16 Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot support a retaliation case based on Defendant’s refusal
to provide her with an accommodation that would require Defendant to violate state law.

Defendant, however, reserves the right to dispute these elements later in this litigation, if
necessary.

16

Defendant clarifies that Plaintiff was not terminated – but administratively suspended, as
discussed above.
