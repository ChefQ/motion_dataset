DEFENDANT'S RENEWED MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS

Pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and for the reasons set
forth in the accompanying Memorandum in Support, which is incorporated by reference,
Defendant, Altoona Student Transportation, Inc., respectfully moves the Court for the entry of
judgment in its favor on the grounds that the Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendant failed to
accommodate Plaintiff's religious beliefs in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. Plaintiff is also unable to establish that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for
requesting an accommodation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Defendant therefore requests that its motion be granted and that this matter be dismissed, with

prejudice.
