IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
BONNIE F. KAITE,

Civil Action

Plaintiff,

No. 17-005

v.

Judge Gibson

ALTOONA STUDENT
TRANSPORTATION, INC.,
Defendant.

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S RENEWED
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
Plaintiff, Bonnie F. Kaite, by undersigned counsel, submits the following Brief in
Opposition to Defendant’s Renewed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.
I. Introduction and Factual Background
Plaintiff Bonnie F. Kaite worked as a bus driver for Defendant Altoona Student
Transportation, Inc. from 2001 until December 31, 2015. (Amd. Comp. ¶7). In November 2015,
Defendant informed Kaite that due to amendments to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services
Law, 23 Pa. C.S. § 6344, she was required to undergo a criminal background check, which
included her being fingerprinted. (Amd. Comp. ¶8).
Kaite, however, told Defendant it violates her Christian religious beliefs to be
fingerprinted and requested a religious accommodation by asking if she could undergo a
different form of background check that did not involve fingerprinting. (Amd. Comp. ¶9). Kaite
believes the Book of Revelation prohibits the “mark of the devil,” which she believes includes
fingerprinting, and that she will not get into Heaven if she submits to fingerprinting. (Amd.
Comp. ¶10). Despite Kaite’s request for an accommodation for her religious beliefs, Defendant
1

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 2 of 22

told her that no accommodations were available and that due to her failure to comply with the
fingerprinting requirement she was suspended indefinitely, effective December 31, 2015. (Amd.
Comp. ¶11)
Although, Defendant refused to accommodate Kaite’s religious beliefs, there was at least
one other employee of Defendant whose fingerprints were unreadable that was allowed to
continue employment with Defendant after undergoing an alternate criminal background check
that did not involve fingerprinting. (Amd. Comp. ¶12); (Amd. Answer ¶ 12). Defendant granted
the accommodation to the employee whose fingerprints were unreadable even though the Child
Protective Services Law does not provide any exemption for these types of employees. (Amd.
Comp. ¶12); (Amd. Answer ¶12).
II. Argument
A.

Because Defendant Permitted Employees Whose Fingerprints Were Not
Readable to Avoid the Requirements of Section 6344, but Required Kaite to
Comply with the Statute, it Discriminated Against Her Because of Her
Religion.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j), defines religion to include
both religious practices as well as religious beliefs. E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,
Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2033–34 (2015). By including religious practices under the definition of
religion, Congress intended “to make it an unlawful employment practice under § 703(a)(1) for
an employer not to make reasonable accommodations, short of undue hardship for the religious
practices of his employees and prospective employees.” E.E.O.C. v. Townley Eng'g & Mfg. Co.,
859 F.2d 610, 613–14 (9th Cir. 1988).
The religious “accommodation issue, by definition, arises only when a neutral rule of
general applicability conflicts with the religious practices of a particular employee.” Trans

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 3 of 22

World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 87–88 (1977) (Marshall, J., dissenting); see also,
Drazewski v. Waukegan Dev. Ctr., 651 F.Supp. 754, 759 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (same). “Title VII
requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.”
Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S. Ct. at 2034; see also, Matthews v. Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc., 417 Fed.Appx. 552, 554 (7th Cir. 2011) (noting that religious accommodation issues arise
where an employee requests an accommodation for a neutral workplace rule); Summers v.
Whitis,

2016 WL 7242483, at *5 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 15, 2016) (Employers are required to

accommodate an employee when a neutral rule of general applicability conflicts with the
religious practices of a particular employee). Therefore, when a workplace rule is not neutral
with respect to religious practices or beliefs, the issue is not one of religious accommodation, but
rather, plain religious discrimination in which the employer is discriminating against the
employee with respect to the terms and conditions of her employment because of her religion.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.
1.

Here, Defendant’s workplace requirement that all bus drivers submit
fingerprints is not neutral.

Because Defendant permitted employees whose fingerprints were not readable to avoid
the fingerprinting requirement, its policy was not neutral and, thus, Kaite was discriminated
against on the basis of her religion. It is undisputed Section 2344 of the Child Protective
Services Law mandates bus drivers submit to fingerprinting. 23 Pa. C.S. §2344(b)(3), 23 Pa.
C.S. §2344(a.1). Kaite sought an accommodation from the fingerprinting requirement due to her
religious beliefs.

At least one other employee who worked for Defendant also sought an

accommodation, due to unreadable fingerprints, and was permitted to submit to an alternative
form of background check that did not involve fingerprinting. (Amd. Comp. ¶ 12); (Amd.
3

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 4 of 22

Answer ¶ 12). Section 2344 does not contain any exemptions for employees whose fingerprints
are unreadable. 23 Pa. C.S. §2344(b)(3).
Because Defendant exempted the employee whose fingerprints were unreadable from its
fingerprinting policy, but did not exempt Kaite, its workplace rule is not neutral. Defendant
chose to exempt the employees whose fingerprints were unreadable from the fingerprinting
requirement even though the statute makes no exception for these types of individuals. In effect,
by permitting the individuals whose fingerprints were unreadable from avoiding the
consequences of the fingerprinting rule, but still requiring Kaite to comply with the rule,
Defendant discriminated against Kaite’s regarding the terms and conditions of her employment
because of her religion, in violation of Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. Based on Defendant’s
decision to grant employees other than Kaite exemptions from the fingerprinting requirement,
Kaite’s claim of religious discrimination is plausible on its face, and Defendant’s Motion should
be denied.
B.

Because Section 6344 of the Child Protective Services Requires an
Employment Practice That Violates Title VII, Defendant May Not Rely on
the Statute to Argue that Accommodating Kaite Constitutes Undue
Hardship.

Section 2000e-7 of Title VII provides that:
Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from
any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law
of any State or political subdivision of a State, other than any such law which
purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful
employment practice under this subchapter.1
1

See also, 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-4, providing that:

Nothing contained in any title of this Act shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of Congress
to occupy the field in which any such title operates to the exclusion of State laws on the same subject
matter, nor shall any provision of this Act be construed as invalidating any provision of State law unless

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 5 of 22

42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-7. This statute “make[s] it clear that Congress, by passage of [Title VII],
intended to supersede all provisions of State law which require or permit the doing of an act
which constitutes an unlawful employment practice under Title VII . . . or which are inconsistent
with any of the purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” Ridinger v. General Motors Corp.,
325 F.Supp. 1089, 1094 (S.D. Ohio 1971) (Because Ohio statute restricted female employment
in workshops and factories, it conflicted with Title VII and was void), reversed on other
grounds, 474 F.2d 949 (6th Cir. 1972); Rinehart v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., C 70-537, 1971
WL 174, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 20, 1971).
Under Section 2000e-7 as well as the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, cl. 2 of the United
States Constitution, “in the event of a conflict between State and Federal legislation, the Federal
legislation will prevail.” Kober v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 325 F.Supp. 467, 474 (W.D. Pa.
1971) (Despite Pennsylvania statute restricting number of hours women could work, Employer
violated Title VII when it did not hire women, even though to do so would violate statute),
affirmed, 480 F.2d 240 (3d Cir. 1973). Thus, Title VII relieves employers of state statutory
requirements “which purport to require or permit any discriminatory practice.” Smith v. City of
Boston, 144 F. Supp. 3d 177, 210 (D. Mass. 2015).
Because Title VII preempts any state laws in conflict with it, an employer cannot assert
the requirements of state law as a defense to Title VII liability. Gulino v. New York State Educ.
Dep’t, 460 F.3d 361, 380 (2d Cir. 2006); see also, Williams v. General Foods Corp., 492 F.2d
399, 404 (7th Cir. 1974) (Employer’s reliance on a state statute in violation of Title VII does not

absolve employer of liability for unlawful employment practices); Gulino v. Bd. of Educ. of City
Sch. Dist. of City of New York, 907 F.Supp.2d 492, 508, 511–12 (S.D. N.Y. 2012) (same); Brown
v. City of Chicago, 8 F. Supp.2d 1095, 1112–13 (N.D. Ill. 1998), aff'd sub nom., Bryant v. City of
Chicago, 200 F.3d 1092 (7th Cir. 2000) (same); Stryker v. Register Public Co., 423 F. Supp.
476, 479-480 (D. Conn. 1976) (employer’s reliance on statute violating Title VII did not
immunize it from liability for backpay). If an employer commits a discriminatory employment
practice, it still violates Title VII even if a state statute permitted or required the practice. Kober,
325 F. Supp. at 474. Thus, reliance on state laws in conflict with Title VII “is no defense to a
charge that an employer’s policies or practices violate Title VII.” 626.12 Conflicting State
Laws, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Compliance Manual § 626.12.
1.

Because Section 2344 of the Child Protective Services Law, as applied,
permits certain exemptions, but not religious exemptions, it violates
Title VII.

Here, Section 2344 of the Child Protective Services Law, as applied, violates Title VII.
Accordingly, Defendant cannot assert its compliance with the statute as a defense to Title VII
liability or to demonstrate undue hardship.
Section 2344 does not contain any exemptions from the school employee fingerprinting
requirement. 23 Pa. C.S. § 6344. Defendant asserts, however, that it contacted the
Commonwealth regarding its employee whose fingerprints were unreadable and that the
Commonwealth permitted this employee to submit to a background check that did not involve
fingerprinting. (Amd. Answer ¶ 12); (Amd. Answer Ex. B, Luchette Affidavit ¶¶ 12-13).
Because the Commonwealth was willing to permit an exception for one group of individuals, i.e.
those individuals whose fingerprints are unreadable, but would not permit an exception for

6

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 7 of 22

religious beliefs, Section 6344 is not neutrally applied and discriminates against employee on the
basis of their religion, in violation of Title VII.
Supreme Court and Third Circuit jurisprudence analyzing the constitutionality of state
and local laws under the Free Exercise Clause are instructive with respect to whether Section
2344 of the Child Protective Services Law violates Title VII. In general, under the Free Exercise
Clause “a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling
government interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious
practice.” Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993)
(citing Employment Division of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990)).
However, a law that does not satisfy neutrality and general applicability requirements regarding
religious practices is subject to strict scrutiny. Id.
“Facial neutrality is not determinative.” Id. at 534. The Free Exercise Clause also
“forbids subtle departures from neutrality,” and “[o]fficial action that targets religious conduct
for distinctive treatment cannot be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial
neutrality.” Id. Therefore, “in circumstances in which individualized exemptions from a general
requirement are available, the government may not refuse to extend that system to cases of
religious hardship without compelling reason.” Id. at 537 (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 884).
In Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359 (3d
Cir. 1999), an internal order of the Newark Police Department required police officers to shave
their beards. Id. at 360. Although the order ostensibly required all officers to shave their beards,
in practice, the Department permitted an exemption for officers who received a “medical
clearance” to wear a beard. Id. at 360. Two Muslim police officers sought an injunction against

7

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 8 of 22

the Police Department’s “no beard” policy, arguing they were religiously obligated to grow
beards and that requiring them to shave their beards violated their rights under the Free Exercise
Clause of the First Amendment. Id. at 360-61.
On appeal, the police officers argued that since the Department provided medical, but not
religious, exemptions from the “no beard” policy, it had unconstitutionally devalued their
religious reasons for wearing beards by judging them to be less important than medical reasons.
Id. at 365. The Department argued that its decision to make a distinction between medical
exemptions and religious exemptions did not represent an impermissible value judgment because
the medical exemptions were only made to comply with the ADA. Id. However, then-Judge
Alito, writing for the majority, determined that because Title VII requires employers to
accommodate religious beliefs, just as the ADA requires employers to accommodate disabilities,
the Department was not justified in providing differential treatment between medical exemptions
and religious exemptions. Id.
The court explained that in Smith and Lukumi, the “Court’s concern was the prospect of
the government deciding that secular motivations are more important than religious
motivations.” Id. The court noted that “this concern is only further implicated when the
government does not merely create a mechanism for individualized exemptions, but instead,
actually creates a categorical exemption for individuals with a secular objection, but not for
individuals with a religious objection.” Id. (emphasis added). The court determined that the
medical exemption raised concerns because it indicated that the Department had “made a value
judgment that secular (i.e. medical) motivations for wearing a beard [were] important enough to
overcome its general interest in uniformity but that religious motivations [were] not.” Id. at 366.

8

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 9 of 22

Accordingly, the Court concluded that “the Departments’ decision to provide medical
exemptions while refusing religious exemptions [was] sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory
intent so as to trigger heightened scrutiny.” Id. at 365.
In Blackhawk v. Pennsylvania, 381 F.3d 202 (3d Cir. 2004), another decision written by
then-Judge Alito, a Native American purchased two black bears to use in religious ceremonies.
Id. at 205. A Pennsylvania Game Commission regulation required owners of exotic wildlife to
obtain a possession permit and pay an annual fee, but exempted zoos and nationally recognized
circuses from these requirements. Id. Additionally, the director of the Game Commission was
authorized to waive the permit fee where hardship or extraordinary circumstances warranted, so
long as the waiver was consistent with sound game or wildlife management activities. Id. The
plaintiff sought an exemption from the annual permit fee on the ground that he possessed the
bears for Native American religious purposes, but was denied a waiver because the Commission
regarded keeping the bears in captivity as inconsistent with sound game or wildlife management
activities. Id. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking to enjoin
the Commission from collecting the fee. Id.
The Court noted that a “law is ‘neutral’ if it does not target religiously motivated conduct
either on its face or as applied in practice.” Id. at 209. However, it explained that
a law fails the general applicability requirement if it burdens a category of
religiously motivated conduct but exempts or does not reach a substantial
category of conduct that is not religiously motivated and that undermines the
purposes of the law to at least the same degree as the covered conduct that is
religiously motivated.
Id. Such laws must satisfy strict scrutiny. Id. Similarly, “a law must satisfy strict scrutiny if it
permits individualized, discretionary exemptions because such a regime creates the opportunity

9

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 10 of 22

for a facially neutral and generally applicable standard to be applied in a practice that
discriminates against religiously motivated conduct.” Id. (emphasis added).
The court determined that the fee requirement failed the general applicability requirement
because the waiver mechanism exempted individuals with hardships, who would follow sound
game and wildlife management polices, but not individuals who wanted to keep exotic animals
for religious reasons. Id. at 210. According to the court, this selective waiver system created a
“regime of individualized discretionary exemptions that trigger[ed] strict scrutiny.”

Id.

Similarly, the categorical exemption for zoos and circuses also triggered strict scrutiny because
such exemptions undermined the Game Commission’s goal of discouraging the keeping of wild
animals in captivity. Id. at 211. Upon review, the Court held the regulatory scheme did not
satisfy strict scrutiny.2 Id. at 214.
These cases interpreting the Free Exercise Clause are analogous to the Commonwealth’s
selective enforcement of Section 2344 of the Child Protective Services Law. Like Fraternal
Order of Police or Blackhawk where the defendants granted exemptions from the laws at issue
2

See also, Tenafly Eruv Association, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144 (3d Cir. 2002). In that case,
an Orthodox Jewish organization placed “eruvs” on utility poles throughout the Borough, to extend the area in which
Orthodox Jews could partake in certain activities on the Sabbath. Id. at 152-154. Relying on a local ordinance that
prohibited the placement of any sign or advertisement in any public place or public street, the Borough Council
ordered the removal of the eruvs. Id. Although the ordinance prohibited all signs and advertisements on utility poles
and did not permit any exceptions, in practice, the Borough permitted various signs on poles including directional
signs to local churches, lost animal signs, house number signs, and holiday displays, such as wreaths and ribbons.
Id. at 151. The plaintiff sought to enjoin the Borough from removing the eruvs. Id. at 154. The court noted that “in
situations where government officials exercise discretion in applying a facially neutral law, so that whether they
enforce the law depends on their evaluation of the reasons underlying a violator’s conduct, they contravene the
neutrality requirement if they exempt some secularly motivated conduct but not comparable religiously motivated
conduct.” Id. at 165-66. Accordingly, the Court held that the Borough’s selective, discretionary application of the
ordinance against the eruvs violated the neutrality principle established in Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police
because it “‘devalues’ Orthodox Jewish reasons for posting them on utility poles by judging them to be of lesser
import than nonreligious reasons, and thus singles out the plaintiff’s religiously motivated conduct for discriminatory
treatment.” Id. at 168. Thus, the court held that similar to the religious discrimination that occurred in Fraternal
Order of Police “the Borough’s invocation of the often-dormant Ordinance against conduct motivated by Orthodox
Jewish beliefs [was] sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent” to trigger strict scrutiny. Id.

10

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 11 of 22

for some reasons, but not religious reasons, here, the Commonwealth exempts individuals whose
fingerprints are not readable from the fingerprinting requirement, but does not exempt
individuals who object to fingerprinting for religious reasons. While it is unclear why certain
individuals’ fingerprints are unreadable, even if the Commonwealth grants these individuals
exemptions based on a medical condition, the decision to exempt only these individuals from the
Section 6344 requirements creates a regime of “individualized, discretionary exemptions” that
results in an otherwise “facially neutral and generally applicable standard” being “applied in a
practice that discriminates against religiously motivated conduct.” Blackhawk, 381 F.3d at 209.
As the Third Circuit held in Fraternal Order of Police, it is of no import if an exemption is
granted for medical reasons, because, where the defendant grants exemptions for medical
reasons, but not religious reasons, it indicates the defendant has decided secular exemptions are
more important than religious exemptions, which is discriminatory. Fraternal Order of Police
170 F.3d at 365-66.
In Fraternal Order of Police, Blackhawk, and Tenafly, the Third Circuit held that the
defendants’ decisions to exempt “secular” but not religious exemptions from the law at issue was
sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent to trigger strict scrutiny. Similarly, here, because
the Commonwealth has, in effect, made a “value judgment” that secular motivations for not
submitting fingerprints are more important than religious motivations, Section 2344, as applied,
discriminates against school employees who religiously object to fingerprinting.
Since Section 2344, as applied, discriminates against employees based on their religious
beliefs, it is inconsistent with and violates Title VII. Therefore, the statute is superseded by Title
VII and void to the extent it discriminates against employees seeking religious accommodations

11

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 12 of 22

by not exempting them from the fingerprinting requirement, but exempting other employees
from the requirement. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7; Kober, 325 F. Supp. at 474; Ridinger, 325 F.Supp.
at 1094. Because Title VII supersedes Section 2344, to the extent it permits some exemptions,
but not religious exemptions, Defendant was relieved from the statutory fingerprinting
requirements as they apply to Kaite. See Smith, 144 F. Supp. 3d at 210. Accordingly, Defendant
cannot rely on Section 2344 as a defense to liability under Title VII or to argue that complying
with the statute would constitute an undue hardship. Gulino, 460 F.3d at 380.
2.

The cases relied upon by Defendant in support of its motion for
judgment on the pleadings are distinguishable.
a.

The case law in which the accommodation would violate a
federal statute.

Most of the cases Defendant cites involve federal statutes in conflict with the employees’
requests for religious accommodation. For example, in a number of those cases, the employees
involved sought religious accommodations from the employers’ requirements that employees
provide them their social security numbers. See Yeager v. FirstEnergy Generation Corp., 777
F.3d 362, 362–64 (6th Cir. 2015); Seaworth v. Pearson, 203 F.3d 1056 (8th Cir. 2000); Weber v.
Leaseway Dedicated Logistics, Inc., 166 F.3d 1223 (10th Cir. 1999); Sutton v. Providence St.
Joseph Med. Ctr., 192 F.3d 826, 830–31 (9th Cir. 1999); Hill v. Promise Hosp. of Phoenix, Inc.,
09-CV-1958-PHX-JAT, 2010 WL 2812913, at *7–8 (D. Ariz. July 8, 2010); Yisrael v. Per
Scholas, Inc., No. 01 Civ. 8290 DAB, 2004 WL 744485 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2004); Baltgalvis v.
Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., 132 F. Supp. 2d 414 (E.D. Va. 2001); E.E.O.C. v. Alendale
Nursing Centre, 996 F. Supp. 712 (W.D. Mich. 1998).

Because accommodating those

employees’ religious beliefs would result in the employers violating federal social security and

12

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 13 of 22

tax regulations requiring they provide employees’ social security numbers, the various courts
held it constituted an undue hardship. Id. Similarly, in Tagore v. United States, 735 F.3d 324
(5th Cir. 2013), the Fifth Circuit held it would create an undue hardship to accommodate a Sikh
IRS employee’s request to wear a ceremonial knife to work because to do so would violate a
federal law prohibiting dangerous weapons in federal facilities. Id. at 326. In Cherry v. Sunoco,
Inc., 07-CV-2235, 2009 WL 2518221, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 17, 2009), the district court held it
would constitute an undue hardship to accommodate the employee’s request to not have a photo
ID because to do so would violate federal law. Id. at *6.
Here, in contrast to the above-cited cases, accommodating Kaite would not require
Defendant to violate a federal law. Accommodating Kaite’s religious beliefs would only require
Defendant to contravene a state statute.
Section 2000e-7 of Title VII does not mandate employers violate another federal statute
that conflicts with Title VII. However, where, as here, a state statute conflicts with Title VII,
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7 compels an employer to disregard the state statute. In the cases Defendant
cites, the courts held it would be an undue hardship for the employers to violate federal statute.
Those cases are largely inapplicable to the present situation because Kaite seeks an
accommodation from a state statute that violates Title VII, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7 requires
Defendant to ignore the state statute to comply with Title VII.
b.

The case law in which the accommodation would violate a state
or local law.

Defendant also cites to several other cases in which the employers relied upon state laws
in refusing to accommodate employees’ religious beliefs. In U.S. v. Board of Education for
School District of Philadelphia, 911 F.2d 882 (3d Cir. 1990), a school teacher, who was a devout
13

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 14 of 22

Muslim, sought accommodation from the employer’s prohibition against teachers wearing head
scarves in school. Id. at 885. Because accommodating the teacher would violate a Pennsylvania
criminal statute prohibiting teachers from wearing any sort of religious dress, marks, emblems,
or insignia, the court held that it would be an undue hardship to accommodate the teachers. Id.
at 891.
Similarly, in Bhatia, v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 734 F.2d 1382 (9th Cir. 1984), a Sikh
employee sought a reasonable accommodation from his employer’s requirement that he shave
any facial hair. Id. at 1383. The employer required employees to shave facial hair in order to
comply with a California Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard requiring
workers exposed to toxic gases to achieve a gas-tight face seal when wearing respirators. Id.
Since accommodating the employee’s facial hair request could prevent him from achieving a
gas-tight face seal, and risk violating California’s safety standards, the court held
accommodating him would create an undue hardship.3 Id. at 1384.
Unlike these cases where courts held that non-compliance with a state statute would
constitute undue hardship, here, the state statute at issue itself is in violation of Title VII and,
therefore, Defendant is not required to comply.

The statutes at issue in School Board of

Philadelphia and Bhatia did not contain exemptions for certain types of employees. Rather,
those statutes required that all employees comply and were generally applicable and neutral with
3

But see, EEOC v. Union Independiente de la Autoridad de Acuedeutos y Aclatarillados de Puerto Rico
(UIA), 30 F. Supp. 2d 217 (D. P.R. 1998), reversed on other grounds, 279 F.3d 49 (1st Cir. 2002) . In that case, an
employee sought an exemption from the employer’s rule requiring he join a labor union. Id. at 219. The employee
sought a religious accommodation from the rule, arguing it violated his Seventh Day Adventist beliefs. Id. The
union argued that allowing the employee to work without becoming a union member would violate a Puerto Rico
statute authorizing unions to negotiate provisions in CBAs requiring employees to become union members. Id. at
223. Citing to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7, the court held that “[i]f state or local laws indeed provide less protection, they
are superseded by Title VII to the extent of conflict with Title VII and thus, cannot serve as a basis for a claim of

respect to all employees.
Conversely, here, Section 2344 of the Child Protective Services, as applied by the
Commonwealth, permits an exception for those employees whose fingerprints are unreadable,
but does not contain an exception for employees whose religious beliefs create the functional
equivalent of an unavailable print. By allowing employees with unreadable fingerprints to
receive more preferential treatment than employees seeking religious accommodation, the statute
is neither generally applicable, nor neutral and, therefore, discriminates against religiously
motivated conduct. See e.g., Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531; Fraternal Order of Police, 170 F.3d at
365-66. The difference in treatment under Section 6344 between employees who seek religious
accommodation and employees whose fingerprints are unreadable makes this case
distinguishable from School Board of Philadelphia and Bhatia.
For example, if in School Board of Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Garb Statute had only
been enforced against Muslims, but not against Jews or Catholics, then the statute would have
been neither generally applicable nor neutral and, thus, discriminatory. See e.g. Tenafly, 309
F.3d at 167-68 (Borough’s decision to permit church directional signs and holiday displays on
utility poles, but prohibit Jewish eruvs, singled out “the plaintiffs’ religiously motivated conduct
for discriminatory treatment.”). In that case, the Garb statute would have violated Title VII and
the employer would have been compelled to ignore the state statutory requirement, pursuant to
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7, and provide the employee an accommodation for his religious beliefs.
Similarly, if in Bhatia, the California safety regulations had only been enforced against Sikhs
and other religious denominations, but not against individuals who received medical clearance
for their beards, the regulations would not have been neutrally enforced and would be

15

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 16 of 22

discriminatory. See e.g., Fraternal Order of Police, 170 F.3d at 365-66 (“no beard” policy was
discriminatory where exemption permitted for medical reasons, but not religious reasons).
Likewise, in that situation the regulations would have violated Title VII and the employer would
have been required to grant an accommodation despite the regulation.
Here, Section 2344 of the Child Protective Services Law is not neutrally applied to
different types of employees. Thus, Kaite’s situation is different from the other cases involving
state statutes. Because employees whose fingerprints were physically unavailable could avoid
the fingerprinting requirements of Section 2344, but employees whose fingerprints were
spiritually unavailable because of religious objections could not avoid the requirements, the
statute, as applied to Kaite, is discriminatory and violates Title VII. Accordingly, Defendant was
compelled to disregard Section 2344, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-7, and cannot assert its
compliance with the statute as a defense to Title VII liability or to demonstrate undue hardship.
C.

Because Genuine Issues of Material Fact Remain To Be Resolved, Judgment
on the Pleadings is Inappropriate.

A motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the theory that the plaintiff failed to
state a claim is reviewed under the same standards that apply to a motion to dismiss under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Caprio v. Healthcare Revenue Recovery Grp., LLC, 709 F.3d 142,
146–47 (3d Cir. 2013); Lane v. Walsh, 3:CV 14 830, 2015 WL 3866043, at *3 (M.D. Pa. June
23, 2015). Under Rule 12(b)(6), courts must “accept all factual allegations as true, construe the
complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any
reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.” Fowler v. UPMC
Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir.2009). In resolving the motion to dismiss, the court must
“conduct a two-part analysis.” Id. First, the court must separate the factual elements from the
16

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 17 of 22

legal elements, accepting all of the factual allegations as true, but disregarding any legal
conclusions. Id. Second, the court must “determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint
are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a ‘plausible claim for relief.’” Id. (citing Ashcroft v.
Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009).
Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), judgment on the pleadings should “not be granted unless the
movant clearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Andela v. American Association for Cancer Research,
389 Fed.Appx. 137, 140 (3d Cir. 2010); DiCarlo v. St. Mary Hosp., 530 F.3d 255, 259 (3d Cir.
2008); Barker v. Hostetter, CIV.A. 13 5081, 2015 WL 1455703, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2015).
When deciding a Rule 12(c) motion, the reviewing court should “view the facts presented in the
pleadings and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving
party.” Estabrook v. Safety & Ecology Corp., 556 Fed.Appx. 152, 154 (3d Cir. 2014); Barker,
2015 WL 1455703, at *3; Snyder v. Daugherty, 899 F.Supp.2d 391, 401 (W.D. Pa. 2012).
In religious accommodation cases, the question of “whether an employer can reasonably
accommodate a person’s religious beliefs without undue hardship is basically a question of fact.”
Jamil v. Sessions, 2017 WL 913601, at *14 (E.D. N.Y. Mar. 6, 2017) (citing Minkus v. Metro.
Sanitary Dist. Of Greater Chicago, 600 F.2d 80, 81 (7th Cir. 1979)); Nichols v. Illinois Dep't of
Transp., 152 F.Supp.3d 1106, 1123–24 (N.D. Ill. 2016). “The court's determination of what is
reasonable in a particular case must be made in context of the unique facts and circumstances of
the case,” Kaplan v. City of Chicago, 2004 WL 2496462, at *11–12 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 4, 2004),
which typically precludes disposition at the motion to dismiss stage.

1.

Questions of fact remain regarding Kaite’s religious discrimination
claim.

Here, Kaite’s claim for religious discrimination is clearly plausible on its face. “To
establish a prima facie case of religious discrimination, the employee must show: (1) she holds a
sincere religious belief that conflicts with a job requirement; (2) she informed her employer of
the conflict; and (3) she was disciplined for failing to comply with the conflicting requirement.”
Webb v. City of Philadelphia, 562 F.3d 256, 259 (3d Cir. 2009).

An employer is not required to

accommodate the employee’s religion if doing so would result in an undue hardship. Shelton v.
Univ. of Medicine & Dentistry of N.J., 223 F.3d 220, 224 (3d Cir. 2000).
Kaite’s Complaint alleges she (1) had a sincere religious belief that Defendant’s
fingerprinting requirement was prohibited by the Book of Revelation; (2) informed Defendant of
her religious conflict; and (3) was fired after Defendant was unwilling to accommodate her
request to submit to an alternative form of background check.

(Amd. Comp. ¶¶ 9-11).

Accordingly, it should be beyond dispute that Kaite has sufficiently pled her prima facie case for
religious discrimination.
Defendant argues that it was not required to accommodate Kaite’s religious beliefs
because to do so would violate Section 2344 of the Child Protective Services Law, which
constitutes an undue hardship and, therefore, Kaite’s claim fails as a matter of law. However,
the facts alleged in the Complaint and the Answer establish material issues of fact that need to be
resolved, which precludes granting Defendant’s Motion. Andela, 389 Fed.Appx. at 140.
The Complaint alleges that at least one other employee, whose fingerprints were not
readable, was permitted to continue employment with Defendant after undergoing an alternate
background check that did not involve fingerprinting. (Amd. Comp. ¶ 12). The Answer admits
18

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 19 of 22

this allegation, and alleges that although the Commonwealth and FBI allowed the individuals
whose fingerprints were unreadable to submit to alternative methods of background screening, it
would not make an exception for Kaite. (Amd. Answer ¶ 12). This allegation itself creates a
material question of fact that militates against granting Defendant’s Motion. Through discovery,
Kaite will need to determine why Defendant was able to grant the individuals whose fingerprints
were unreadable an exemption from the fingerprinting policy, but was unwilling to do the same
for Kaite.

Kaite will need to find out what conversations Defendant had with the

Commonwealth and FBI regarding Kaite’s request for accommodation and the individuals
whose fingerprints were unreadable. To discover this information, Kaite will likely need to
conduct depositions of Defendant’s decision-makers as well as the Commonwealth employees
who discussed Kaite with Defendant. Because there remain material questions of fact regarding
whether accommodating Kaite would create undue hardship, Defendant’s Motion is improper
and should be denied.
2.

Questions of fact also remain regarding Kaite’s retaliation claim.

Kaite’s retaliation claim is also plausible on its face. To establish a prima facie case of
retaliation under Title VII, Kaite must simply tender evidence that: (1) she engaged in activity
protected by Title VII; (2) Defendant took a materially adverse action against her; and (3) there
is a causal connection between her protected activity and the adverse employment action. Moore
v. City of Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 341 (3d Cir. 2006); see Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc.,
283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir. 2002); Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 278-79
(3d Cir. 2000).
If Kaite offers such evidence, the burden shifts to Defendant to advance a legitimate non-

19

Case 3:17-cv-00005-KRG Document 25 Filed 04/19/17 Page 20 of 22

retaliatory reason for its conduct. If it does, Kaite must “point to some evidence, direct or
circumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer's
articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more
likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action.” Hare v. Potter,
220 Fed.Appx. 120, 127 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.
2006)).

Here, Defendant does not argue that Kaite’s prima facie case for retaliation is

insufficiently pled, but only contends that Kaite’s Complaint fails to sufficiently allege pretext.
As discussed in the preceding sections, because Defendant and the Commonwealth’s
exempt employees whose fingerprints are not readable from the fingerprinting requirement of
Section 2344, but do not exempt employees seeking religious accommodations, Section 2344, as
applied, is discriminatory. Given that Section 2344 violates Title VII, Defendant was relieved
from having to comply with the statute. By complying with a statute that is void with respect to
employees seeking religious accommodations, Defendant discriminated against Kaite on the
basis of her religious beliefs. Therefore, Kaite has plausibly alleged that an invidious
discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating cause of Defendant’s actions.
Additionally, because Kaite requested an accommodation from employer’s fingerprinting
requirement in or around November 2015, and Defendant decided to suspend her in December
2015, (Amd. Comp. ¶¶ 8-11), there is unusually suggestive proximity between the request for
accommodation and the adverse employment action, which makes Kaite’s pretext allegation
plausible on its face. see e.g. Jalil v. Avdel Corporation, 873 F.2d 701, 709 (3d Cir. 1989).
Thus, Kaite can establish Defendant was motivated by discriminatory reasons when it fired her
and she has alleged sufficient facts to establish a retaliation claim.

III. Conclusion
For all the above reasons, Defendant has failed to establish that no material issue of fact
needs to be resolved and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, its
renewed Motion should be denied.
