Re: Natifah Cooper v. City of New York, et al., 14 CV 6136 (PKC)(RLM)

Dear Judge Chen:
I am an Assistant Corporation Counsel in the Special Federal Litigation Division of the
New York City Law Department and the attorney assigned to the defense of the abovereferenced case on behalf of Defendant City of New York. Defendants write respectfully to
request: (1) a pre-motion conference in order to discuss defendants’ anticipated motion for
summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; and (2) that the date for filing a joint pretrial
order, which is currently scheduled for February 17, 2016, be held in abeyance until the
disposition of defendants’ motion. Plaintiff’s counsel consents to these requests.
I.

Factual Background

By way of background, plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that on April 17, 2013, defendant
officers Dieugenia and Pasynkov unlawfully arrested plaintiff and subjected her to excessive
force. Plaintiff brings claims for false arrest, excessive force, denial of a right to fair trial, failure
to intervene and unlawful stop and search against all defendants.
II.

Grounds for Dismissal
A. Plaintiff’s Federal Claims Cannot Survive Summary Judgment.

The existence of probable cause to arrest constitutes justification and ‘is a complete
defense to an action for false arrest . . . .’” Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir. 1996)
(quoting Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1994)). In the instant matter,
plaintiff’s claim of false arrest should be dismissed as there was probable cause for her arrest.
During plaintiff’s deposition, she admitted to being present on the beach after midnight, standing
next to a bonefire when the officers approached. During her deposition, plaintiff admits to being
on the beach around midnight on the date of incident which is against City ordinances as all city

beaches are closed to the public after dusk. Similarly, her claim for unlawful stop and search
should be dismissed as plaintiff was not actually searched or stopped. Plaintiff asserts her
boyfriend was initially stopped by the officers and she later became involved in the arrest. There
was no actual stop or search of plaintiff prior to her arrest.
Further, plaintiff’s claim for denial of a right to fair trial will likely fail as well. In order
for plaintiff’s constitutional right to a fair trial to survive, plaintiff must prove the following
elements by a preponderance of the credible evidence: (1) that the defendant, (2) fabricated
evidence, (3) that was likely to influence a jury’s decision, (4) forwarded that information to
prosecutors, and (5) that the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of liberty as a result. Jovanovic v.
City of New York, 486 Fed. Appx. 149, 152 (2d Cir. 2012). Foremost, guilty pleas constitute
superseding causes that break the causal chain between the purportedly unlawful activity and
subsequent deprivation of liberty. Reyes v. City of New York, 11 Civ. 7084 (AT), 2014 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 6923, at *13-14 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2014) (citing Barmapov v. Barry, No. 09 Civ
03390, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 768, 2011 WL 32371, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 2011)). In the
instant matter, plaintiff essentially pled guilty by accepting an adjournment in contemplation of
dismissal. Also, false testimony alone cannot form the basis for a fabrication of evidence claim.
Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 326 (1983). The “evidence” at issue must be admissible at a
criminal trial in order to state a claim. Jones v. City of New York, 12-CV-3658 (JG), 2013 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 162235, at *29 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2013) (a false statement by an officer to an
ADA is not actionable because, as inadmissible hearsay, it would never get before a jury in a
criminal case).
B. Stay of the Joint Pretrial Order.
In light of the anticipated motion, and in the interest of judicial economy,
defendants respectfully request that the date for filing a joint pretrial order, which is currently
scheduled for February 17, 2016, be held in abeyance until the disposition of defendants’ motion.
In the alternative, should the Court determine that the Joint Pretrial Order should be filed, the
parties ask for an extension of three weeks until March 9, 2016, to file the Joint Pretrial Order.
For the foregoing reasons, the City of New York respectfully requests that a pre-motion
conference be held in connection with defendant’s anticipated motion for summary judgment
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
Respectfully submitted,
