No. 06-491
EDWARD J. DAMICH
CHIEF JUDGE

OENGA HEIRS RESPONSE
TO OIL COMPANIES MOTION TO INTERVENE

The Plaintiffs (Oenga Heirs) herein respond to the Motion to Intervene filed by
BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. (BPX), ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. (Conoco Phillips),
Exxon Mobile Alaska Production Inc. (Exxon Mobile), Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron),
Forest Oil Corporation (Forest) (collectively "Oil Companies").
The Oenga Heirs do not object to a limited intervention by the Oil Companies as
follows:


The Oil Companies' intervention be limited to those issues in this case
which would also be issues in any indemnification action by the United
States against the Oil Companies.



The Oil Companies not be allowed to address in this case issues which
bear solely on any possible indemnification action by the United States
against the Oil Companies and are not otherwise related to this case.



The Oil Companies not be allowed to address in this case issues of this
Court's jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claim against the United States and
issues of the fiduciary duty owed the Oenga Heirs by the United States
and the United States breach of that duty.

This case seeks damages from the United States for its breach of trust
related to a lease of the Oenga Heirs' allotment to the BPX, now used by the Oil
Companies. Oenga Heirs do not dispute that the Oil Companies interest in the subject of
this case makes them proper intervenors. The Oenga Heirs asked that the Oil Companies
be given Notice because of that interest. The Court found that interest sufficient and
ordered such Notice be given. Having asked that RCFC 14(b) Notice be given, it would
be inappropriate for the Oenga Heirs to now object to the interventions as contemplated
by the Rule.
This does not mean, however, that it would be appropriate for the Oil Company to
exercise unlimited participation. It is appropriate for the Oil Companies to participate in
the consideration of issues in this case that would potentially be issues in any
indemnification action against them by the United States. But in other areas, it would be
appropriate for the Court to limit the scope of the intervention. Klamath Irrigation
District v United States, 64 Fed Cl. 328, 336 (2005) (allowing intervention but noting
"the court has adequate facility to limit the issue which may be presented…"). Orion
Scientific Systems v. United States, 28 Fed Cl 669, 672 (1993) (allowing limited
intervention, but Court reserving right to revoke intervention "if it appears that such
intervention may delay or prejudice the adjudication of this suit").

In keeping with this precedent, it is appropriate that issues which would arise
solely in an indemnification action not be considered in this action. Such issues are solely
between the Oil Companies and the United States. They are outside the scope of this
action.
Similarly it is appropriate that the Oil Companies not be involved in issues which
are solely between the Oenga Heirs and the United States. Such issues include this
Court's jurisdiction over the Oenga Heir's claim and issues involve in the fiduciary duty
owed the Oenga Heirs by the United States and any breach of that duty.
To put it simply, the Oil Companies' intervention should be allowed to address
issues properly arising in this case that would also be issues in any contribution action by
the United States against the Oil Companies. The Oil Companies' intervention should not
be allowed to address issues which are solely between the Oenga Heirs and the United
States.
It is requested that the Oil Companies' Motion to Intervene be granted, but that
intervention be limited as set out herein.
