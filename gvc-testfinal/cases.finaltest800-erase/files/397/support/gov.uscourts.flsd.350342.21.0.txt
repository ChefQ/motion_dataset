UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
Fort Lauderdale Division
Case No: 10-CV-60059 HUCK/O’Sullivan

IMMEDIATE CAPITAL GROUP, INC.,
A Florida corporation, d/b/a INCREDIBLE
DISCOVERIES,
Plaintiff,
v.
SPONGETECH DELIVERY SYSTEM,
INC., a Delaware corporation,
Defendant.
__________________________________/
MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendant, SPONGETECH DELIVERY SYSTEMS, INC. (“Spongetech”), pursuant to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) moves to dismiss Counts II, III, IV, and V of the First Amended
Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) [DE-18], and states as follows:
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff, IMMEDIATE CAPITAL GROUP, INC., d/b/a INCREDIBLE DISCOVERIES,
(“ICG”) has sued Spongetech for Breach of Contract, Open Account, Accounting, Equitable
Lien, and Unjust Enrichment. Following ICG’s initial complaint, Spongetech filed an Answer
and Affirmative Defenses [DE-13].

ICG filed a Motion to Strike [DE-14] Spongetech’s

Affirmative Defenses, arguing in part that Spongetech should have made its argument through a
motion to dismiss. See Motion to Strike ¶ 6. Prior to resolution of ICG’s Motion to Strike, ICG
brought its unopposed Motion to Amend Complaint [DE-17]. Spongetech now moves to dismiss
Counts II, III, IV, and V of ICG’s Amended Complaint.

FACTS
Spongetech and ICG entered into contracts involving the production of commercials
promoting Spongetech’s products. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 10-11. Under these contracts,
ICG was obligated to produce short-form commercials for Spongetech.

See Amended

Complaint ¶ 11. ICG references these contracts as “Agreements,” purportedly attached to the
Amended Complaint as “Composite Exhibit A” thereto. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 7, 10, 11,
36.1 ICG alleges that Spongetech breached the Agreements by failing to pay all amounts due
under the written contracts. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 12, 22.
ARGUMENT
A.

Standard Of Review.
The purpose of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is to test the sufficiency of the

Plaintiffs’ claim for relief. Ventrassist Ply Ltd. v. Heartware, Inc., 377 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1285
(S.D. Fla. 2005). The Court, assuming all facts alleged by Plaintiffs to be true, must determine
whether a cause of action exists. Mills v. Foremost Ins. Co., 511 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.
2008). Despite the fact that the court, when considering a motion to dismiss, must construe the
complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, In re Southeast Banking Corp. Securities
and Loan Loss Reserve Litigation, 147 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1352 (S.D. Fla. 2001);2 the plaintiff’s
burden of providing the grounds for an entitlement to relief requires “more than labels and
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell
Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Moreover, the plaintiffs’ factual allegations,
although assumed to be true, “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative
1

ICG also references “Royalty payments” attached as “Composite Exhibit B.” ICG did not attach Composite
Exhibit A nor Composite Exhibit B to the Amended Complaint. For the purposes of this Motion, Spongetech
assumes ICG is referring to the same Exhibit A and Exhibit B that ICG attached to the original Complaint [DE-1] in
this action.

level.” Id.
B.

Open Account Claim Fails Where Express Contract Exists
An open account is an unpaid debt, which arises from services performed or goods

delivered with the expectation of additional subsequent transactions, which would be subject to
future settlement and adjustment. See Morse, LLC v. United Wisconsin Life Ins. Co., 356 F.
Supp. 2d 1296, 1299-1300 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (holding that the elements of open account were not
met, where the count incorporated allegations that an express contract existed). An action for
open account “should not include express contracts or other obligations that have been reduced
to writing.” Id. (citing H & H Design Builders, Inc. v. Travelers’ Indem. Co., 639 So. 2d 697,
700 (Fla. 5th DCA 1994)).
An obligation does not become an ‘open account’ simply because
the amount due under a contract requires calculation. An obligee
under a contract cannot avoid the requirement of pleading and
proving a cause of action based on a contract by placing its
demand on a ‘statement of account’ and mailing it to the obligor.
H & H Design Builders, Inc. v. Travelers’ Indem. Co., 639 So. 2d 697, 700 (Fla. 5th DCA 1994)
(holding that action under contract could not be brought as open account claim merely because
the plaintiff mails the defendant a statement showing the amount demanded). ICG has pled the
existence of an express contract and incorporated this allegation into its open account claim. See
Amended Complaint ¶¶ 10, 24. ICG has not attached, incorporated, or referenced an invoice or
statement sent to Spongetech that remains unpaid. In fact, ICG has not even pled that an unpaid
invoice or statement exists. Therefore, an action for open account is improper and should be
dismissed.
C.

Failure To Plead Elements For Accounting
Under Florida law, to plead an action for an equitable accounting, the plaintiff must show

BOC36,752,926 v4 123201.010400

3

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 21

Entered on FLSD Docket 03/26/2010 Page 4 of 8

that: (1) a fiduciary relationship exists or that the transactions at issue are complex; and (2) the
remedy at law is inadequate. American United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, 480 F.3d 1043, 1071
(11th Cir. 2007). Where legal claims are brought simultaneously, an equitable accounting claim
requires a showing that the accounts between the parties are so complicated that only a court of
equity, and not a jury, can unravel them. Managed Care Solutions v. Essent Healthcare, Inc., No.
09-60351-PAS, 2010 WL 309038 at *4 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 25, 2010) (citation omitted). This burden
is increased in federal court because district courts can appoint special masters to assist juries,
and “it will indeed be a rare case in which it [the burden] can be met.” Id. at *4 (citing Dairy
Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 478 (1962)). Furthermore, pleading conclusory allegations
that the transaction was complicated will not trump other factual allegations in the complaint to
the contrary. Id. Finally, an accounting claim is not appropriate where a party will be able to
prove its damage claim through information learned in discovery. Id. at *5.
ICG’s accounting claim fails to meet either element required to bring this cause of action.
First, ICG has failed to show that the transaction was complex or that a fiduciary relationship
existed between the parties. In fact, ICG alleges that it was simply entitled to a percentage of
sales under the written contracts. See Amended Complaint ¶ 11. As alleged, the facts evince an
arms-length transaction between a seller willing to produce commercials and a buyer willing to
pay for the production. ICG does not allege any facts to show a special relationship between
these contracting parties. The conclusory allegations that this transaction was complex and that
fiduciary relationships existed are insufficient to plead a claim for accounting. See Amended
Complaint ¶ 31. Secondly, ICG has failed to show the remedy at law is inadequate. If ICG is
able to prove its claim, the injury will be remedied with money damages and the amount of
damages will be calculated based on the information it learns through discovery.

4

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 21

Entered on FLSD Docket 03/26/2010 Page 5 of 8

Thus, an action for accounting is not appropriate here because, as shown by the
allegations of the Amended Complaint, the transaction was not complex and no fiduciary
relationship existed.

See Amended Complaint ¶ 11 (alleging that ICG was to be paid a

percentage on sales less returns or uncollectable amounts). Moreover, if ICG is able to prove its
breach of contract claim, the remedy at law will be adequate. Therefore, the parties were not in a
fiduciary relationship, the transaction was not complex, and if ICG prevails, the remedy at law
would be adequate. Accordingly, ICG’s accounting claim should be dismissed because the ICG
has not adequately pled either element for an equitable accounting claim.
D.

Action For Equitable Lien Fails Where Adequate Remedy At Law Exists
Under Florida law, equitable liens may be founded upon two
bases; (i) a written contract that indicates an intention to charge a
particular property with a debt or obligation; or, (ii) a declaration
by a court out of general considerations of right or justice as
applied to the particular circumstances of a case.

See Degirmenci, 2010 WL 342256, at *15 (refusing to grant an equitable lien because the written
contract provided no evidence of an intent to create a lien on the property); see also In re
Performance Leasing Corp., of Collier County, 385 B.R. 317, 325-26 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2008)
(stating that an equitable lien is a “right granted by a court of equity, arising by reason of the
conduct of the parties affected, that would entitle one party as a matter of equity to proceed
against certain property”) (emphasis added). An equitable lien is an extraordinary remedy that
should not be used when the remedy at law is adequate.

See Ben-Yishay v. Mastercraft

Development, LLC, 553 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1373 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (dismissing plaintiffs’ claim
for an equitable lien where plaintiffs had no special right to the property and where an adequate
remedy at law existed); In re Johnson, 336 B.R. 568, 571 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2006) (recognizing
that an equitable lien is an extraordinary remedy, which should only be applied where the law

BOC36,752,926 v4 123201.010400

5

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 21

Entered on FLSD Docket 03/26/2010 Page 6 of 8

fails to give relief and injustice would result if the lien was not imposed). Moreover, equitable
liens apply to real property. See Ben-Yishay, 553 F. Supp. 2d at 1373 (stating an “equitable lien
is ‘a charge or encumbrance upon the land …’”) (emphasis added).
ICG alleges that the written contract demonstrate an “intention to charge a Royalty to
DEFENDANT for Services and produce provided to DEFENDANT, and an obligation by
DEFENDANT to pay Royalties that is attached to the sale of each SPONGETECH Product
sold.” See Amended Complaint ¶ 36. ICG improperly characterizes the language of the written
contracts as an intention to charge property with a debt or obligation. At most, the contract
evinces an intention to calculate the amount to be paid as consideration for ICG’s services under
the contract. The contract does not create an expressed lien or security interest in the products
sold by Spongetech nor the profits from those sales. Furthermore, granting an equitable lien
would be inappropriate because equitable liens are applied to real property. Courts do not
impose this extraordinary remedy in the absence of fraudulent or inequitable behavior that
benefits, improves, or funds the purchase of real property. See In re Johnson, 336 B.R. at 57172; In re Performance Leasing Corp., of Collier County, 385 B.R. at 326.
Moreover, under the allegations in Count I of ICG’s Amended Complaint, which are
assumed to be true for purposes of this Motion to Dismiss, any damages would be calculated in
monetary terms. Thus, an equitable lien is inappropriate because ICG has no special rights in the
products, these products are not land, and money damages would adequately remedy any damage
from the alleged breach of contract. See Ben-Yishay, 553 F. Supp. 2d at 1373; In re Johnson,
336 B.R. at 571. ICG’s count for an equitable lien fails because money damages provides an
adequate remedy at law, if any breach of the express contract is proven.

See Amended

Complaint ¶¶ 22-23. Accordingly, ICG’s claim for an equitable lien should be dismissed.

Unjust Enrichment Claim Fails Where Express Contract Exists
To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, the plaintiff must allege that: (1) the

plaintiff conferred a benefit upon the defendant; (2) the defendant knew of the benefit; (3) the
defendant accepted or retained the benefit; and (4) that inequity would result if the defendant
were allowed to retain the benefit without paying the plaintiff for it. See Degirmenci, 2010 WL
342256, at *15. However, under Florida law, an action for unjust enrichment cannot stand where
an express contract exists. Id. (citing Tracfone Wireless, Inc. v. Access Telecom., Inc., 642 F.
Supp. 2d 1354, 1366 (S.D. Fla. 2009)). In this case ICG has pled the existence of written
contracts. See Amended Complaint ¶ 10. ICG has incorporated this allegation of an express
written contract into its unjust enrichment claim.

See Amended Complaint ¶ 40.

While

Spongetech contests ICG’s allegations of breach, Spongetech has not contested the existence of
these contracts. Thus, ICG’s claim for unjust enrichment must be dismissed under Florida law
because an express contract exists.
CONCLUSION
Counts II, III, IV, and V of ICG’s Complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a
claim and the reasons set forth above.
