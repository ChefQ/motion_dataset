__________________________________/
DEFENDANT’S REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF ITS
MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendant, SPONGETECH DELIVERY SYSTEMS, INC. (“Spongetech”), pursuant to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) submits this Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Its
Motion to Dismiss Counts II, III, IV, and V of the First Amended Complaint (“Amended
Complaint”) [DE-18], and states as follows:
I.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

In its March 26, 2010 Motion to Dismiss (“MTD”) [DE-21], Spongetech presented this
Court with compelling reasons for dismissing Counts II, III, IV, and V of the Amended
Complaint. In its March 31, 2010 Response To Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint (“Response”) [DE-22], Plaintiff, Immediate Capital Group, Inc., (“ICG”)
merely restates the standard for a motion to dismiss and the right to file alternative pleadings. In
fact, all but one of the cases cited in ICG’s Response apply solely to the standard on a motion to

BOC36,773,229 v1 123201.010400

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2010 Page 2 of 8

dismiss and the right to plead in the alternative. Spongetech does not challenge ICG’s right to
plead in the alternative. The authorities cited by Spongetech in its MTD require dismissal of the
four named counts because each of these counts is inherently flawed. ICG’s Response fails to
distinguish any of the authorities cited by Spongetech. While ICG’s Response correctly states
that this Court must accept all the allegation of the complaint as true when evaluating a motion to
dismiss, ICG’s Response fails to rebut the dispositive arguments raised in Spongetech’s MTD.
Accordingly, as stated in further detail below, this Court should grant the MTD and dismiss the
Amended Complaint.
II.
A.

ARGUMENT

The Response Fails To Address The Existence Of An Express Contract, Requiring
Dismissal of Count II - Open Account.
In its MTD, Spongetech explained in detail, with supporting case law, that the elements

for open account are not adequately pled where the count incorporates the allegation of an
express contract. See MTD at p. 3. In its Response, ICG only responds by claiming the right to
plead causes of action in the alternative. See Response ¶ 5. While a plaintiff may bring causes
of action in the alternative, ICG’s “Count II - Open Account” fails to plead a cause of action.
ICG begins its open account claim by incorporating all of its factual allegations, see Amended
Complaint ¶ 24, thereby expressly including the allegation of an express contract between the
parties. See Amended Complaint ¶ 10. Paragraph 24 of ICG’s Amended Complaint also
incorporates all of the factual allegations detailing the terms of the alleged contract.

See

Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11-14, 16, 24. The open account claim also refers to the Agreements by
citing to paragraph 11 for an explanation of the amounts allegedly due under the contracts. See
Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11, 27. ICG’s action for open account fails to meet the required
elements because it includes these allegations of an express contract; a fatal flaw that requires

BOC36,773,229 v1 123201.010400

2

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2010 Page 3 of 8

dismissal of the open account claim for this reason alone. See MTD at p. 3, citing Morse, LLC
v. United Wisconsin Life Ins. Co., 356 F. Supp. 2d 1296, 1299-1300 (S.D. Fla. 2005)
(dismissing open account claim because the count incorporated allegations that an express
contract existed and did not allege an expectation of future transactions); H & H Design
Builders, Inc. v. Travelers’ Indem. Co., 639 So. 2d 697, 700 (Fla. 5th DCA 1994). ICG has
improperly incorporated the allegations of an express contract into its open account claim. Thus,
under the reasoning provided by this Court in the similar case of Morse cited above, ICG’s open
account claim should be dismissed.
B.

The Response Fails To Address The Existence Of An Express Contract, Requiring
Dismissal of Count V - Unjust Enrichment.
The incorporation of allegations evincing an express contract also require the dismissal of

ICG’s unjust enrichment claim. See MTD at p. 7. Once again, ICG merely responds by
claiming the right to plead causes of action in the alternative. See Response ¶ 6. While a
plaintiff may bring causes of action in the alternative, ICG’s “Count V - Unjust Enrichment” is
also inherently flawed. As with its open account claim, ICG begins its unjust enrichment claim
by incorporating all of its factual allegations, see Amended Complaint ¶ 40, thereby expressly
including the allegation of an express contract between the parties. See Amended Complaint ¶
10. The unjust enrichment count also incorporates all of the factual allegations detailing the
terms of the alleged contract. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11-14, 16, 40. In addition, the unjust
enrichment claim also expressly refers to the Agreements when discussing the benefit allegedly
conferred. See Amended Complaint ¶ 42. ICG fails to plead the elements for unjust enrichment
because it includes the allegations of an express contract; thereby requiring dismissal of the
unjust enrichment claim. See MTD at p. 7, citing Degirmenci v. Sapphire-Fort Lauderdale,
LLLP, No. 09-60089-CIV, 2010 WL 342256, at *15 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (dismissing unjust

3

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

enrichment count where parties did not dispute the existence of an express contract) (citing
Tracfone Wireless, Inc. v. Access Telecom., Inc., 642 F. Supp. 2d 1354, 1366 (S.D. Fla. 2009)).
As this Court held in Degirmenci, ICG’s claim for unjust enrichment should be dismissed
because an express contract exists.
C.

The Response Fails to Rebut Any of the Arguments Stated in the MTD Requiring
Dismissal of Count III - Accounting.
ICG’s Amended Complaint fails to properly plead the elements for an accounting. As

stated by Spongetech in its MTD, an action for an accounting under Florida law, requires the
plaintiff to plead facts showing that: (1) a fiduciary relationship exists or that the transactions at
issue are complex; and (2) the remedy at law is inadequate. American United Life Ins. Co. v.
Martinez, 480 F.3d 1043, 1071 (11th Cir. 2007). In its Response, ICG merely reiterates the
conclusory allegations that a fiduciary relationship existed, the transaction was complex, and no
remedy at law is adequate. See Response ¶ 7; Amended Complaint ¶ 32. ICG makes these
conclusory allegations solely on the basis that the contract between the parties involves royalty
payments. See Response ¶ 7. ICG’s argument is without merit. An arms-length transaction
does not become complex or create a fiduciary relationship simply because it involves royalty
payments; instead, a plaintiff must show that the transaction is so complicated that a jury would
be unable to unravel the transaction. See Managed Care Solutions v. Essent Healthcare, Inc.,
No. 09-60351-PAS, 2010 WL 309038 at *4 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 25, 2010) (dismissing accounting
claim where evidentiary facts alleged in complaint failed to show complexity or the lack of a
legal remedy). As this Court held in Managed Care, the potential damage calculation in this case
is “outlined with specificity in the Agreement[s] and is not complicated;” it is simply a
percentage of collections. Id. Once again, ICG has failed to meet its burden, which is increased
in federal court because special masters may be appointed to assist juries, and “it will indeed be a

BOC36,773,229 v1 123201.010400

4

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2010 Page 5 of 8

rare case in which it [the burden] can be met.” Id. at *4 (citing Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369
U.S. 469, 478 (1962)). ICG has not addressed or distinguished these dispositive authorities.
ICG has failed to plead facts that support the existence of a fiduciary relationship or that show
the complexity of the transaction would be too great for a jury and a special master. Therefore,
ICG’s conclusory allegations are insufficient to pled the existence of a complex transaction or a
fiduciary relationship.
Moreover, ICG’s conclusory allegation that the transaction was complicated does not
trump other contrary factual allegations in the Amended Complaint. Id. Yet again, ICG has pled
the existence of a contract involving royalty payments and incorporated those allegations into its
accounting claim. See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 10-14; 30. The allegations of a simple contract
trump ICG’s conclusory allegation of a complex transaction, which requires the dismissal of
ICG’s accounting claim for failure to pled the elements.
Finally, an accounting claim is not appropriate where a party will be able to prove its
damage claim through information learned in discovery. Managed Care Solutions, 2010 WL
309038 at *5 (dismissing accounting claim even though damage calculation would require
discovery of defendant’s records). ICG is seeking an accounting allegedly because Spongetech
has refused to allow ICG to perform an accounting to ascertain the amount due under the
contract. See Response ¶ 7. As in Managed Care, if ICG is able to prove its breach of contract
claims, the amount due under the contract will be determined based on the information ICG is
able to learn through discovery. Thus, the accounting claim should also be dismissed because
discovery would provide a sufficient basis for a damage calculation, should damages be
awarded. In fact, because discovery would provide ICG with the information necessary to
calculate any damages due under the contract, ICG’s own pleading shows that the second

BOC36,773,229 v1 123201.010400

5

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2010 Page 6 of 8

element of an accounting claim, the lack of an adequate remedy at law, cannot be met.
ICG’s accounting claim should be dismissed for several reasons. First, ICG failed to
plead facts showing the existence of a fiduciary relationship or sufficient complexity of the
transaction. Second, the facts alleged by ICG evince a simple transaction between parties
contracting at arms-length, which trumps ICG’s conclusory allegations to the contrary. See
Amended Complaint ¶ 11 (alleging that ICG was to be paid a percentage on sales less returns or
uncollectable amounts). Third, the amounts alleged to be due under the Agreements will be
easily determinable based on the information available to ICG through discovery. Fourth, the
facts pled by ICG show that the potential remedy at law is adequate. Finally, ICG has failed to
distinguish the cases cited by Spongetech in its MTD, where this Court has dismissed accounting
claims under similar facts.
D.

The Response Fails to Rebut The Argument Stated in the MTD Requiring Dismissal
of Count IV - Equitable Lien.1
ICG begins its Response by attacking Spongetech’s argument that an equitable lien is

inappropriate here because they are applied to real property. See Response ¶ 8. ICG relies on
the dicta from Jones v. Carpenter, 106 So. 127 (Fla. 1925) as its only support. But ICG’s
reliance is misplaced because Jones involves the application of an equitable lien to real property.
Id. at 128-29. ICG is seeking an equitable lien on profits made from the sale of Spongetech’s
products, but ICG has failed to cite any authority showing the application of an equitable lien to
something other than real property. ICG relies on the syllabus of a case from 1925, but fails to
cite a subsequent case applying an equitable lien to property other than real property.

1

The fourth count of ICG’s Complaint and First Amended Complaint seeking an equitable lien
is titled “Count VI - Equitable Lien.” In its MTD and this Reply, Spongetech refers to this fourth
count as “Count IV - Equitable Lien.”

6

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2010 Page 7 of 8

In its MTD, Spongetech explained that an equitable lien is inappropriate where an
adequate remedy at law exists. See MTD pp. 5-6. In its Response, ICG claims that this is
inaccurate, citing again to dicta in Jones, which states in part that an “[e]quitable lien exists
independently of any express agreements.” Jones, 106 So. 127 (Syllabus of the Court). ICG
misinterprets this quote, which merely refers to the fact that such an action is a right in equity
that may be brought to prevent unjust enrichment where a remedy at law is inadequate. Id. In
fact, as cited by Spongetech in its MTD, this Court has recently confirmed that an equitable lien
is an extraordinary remedy, which is not available where an adequate remedy at law exists. See
MTD pp. 5-6; Ben-Yishay v. Mastercraft Development, LLC, 553 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1373 (S.D.
Fla. 2008) (dismissing claim for an equitable lien where an adequate remedy at law existed); In
re Johnson, 336 B.R. 568, 571 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2006) (recognizing that an equitable lien is an
extraordinary remedy, which should only be applied where the law fails to give relief and
injustice would result if the lien was not imposed). ICG has failed to distinguish or rebut these
cases in its Response.
An equitable lien may only be granted if (1) a written contract indicates the intention to
charge particular property with a debt or (2) a court grants an equitable lien in equity to ensure
justice in a particular case. See Degirmenci, 2010 WL 342256, at *15 (dismissing claim for
equitable lien because written contract showed no evidence of an intent to create a lien on the
property); see also In re Performance Leasing Corp., of Collier County, 385 B.R. 317, 325-26
(Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2008) (stating that an equitable lien is a “right granted by a court of equity,
arising by reason of the conduct of the parties affected, that would entitle one party as a matter of
equity to proceed against certain property”). As stated in Spongetech’s MTD, ICG has failed to
meet these elements. See MTD pp. 5-6. First, the written contract does not show an intention to

BOC36,773,229 v1 123201.010400

7

Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 23

Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2010 Page 8 of 8

impose a lien on any property. Second, an equitable lien is an extraordinary equitable remedy,
meaning that it should not be applied where an adequate remedy at law exists. If ICG is able to
prove its breach of contract claims, it will have an adequate remedy at law under the contract.
See Amended Complaint ¶¶ 22-23. Therefore, ICG’s equitable lien claim should be dismissed
because ICG has failed to properly pled the grounds for such extraordinary relief.
CONCLUSION
Counts II, III, IV, and V of ICG’s Complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a
claim and the reasons set forth above.
