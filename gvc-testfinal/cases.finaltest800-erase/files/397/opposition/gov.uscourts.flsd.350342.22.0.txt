RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S
MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff, IMMEDIATE CAPITAL GROUP, INC., and hereby files its
Response to Defendant SPONGETECH DELIVERY SYSTEM?s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs
First Amended Complaint, and alleges as follows:

1. On or about March 26, 2010, the Defendant, SPONGETECH DELIVERY SYSTEM,
INC., (hereinafter "DEFENDANT") filed their Motion to Dismiss, contesting the fact that
Plaintiff has filed alternative pleadings, and alleging that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently state a
claim for which relief can be granted.

2. For purposes of a Motion to Dismiss, The Court must accept the allegations of the
complaint as true and considered in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Crocker v.
Marks, 856 So.2d 1123 (Fla. A" DCA 2003); Siegle v. Progressive 819 So.2d 732 (Fla. 2002).

3. For purposes of a Motion to Dismiss, all facts of the complaint are accepted as true.

Orlovsky v. Solid Surf, 405 So.2d 1363 (40x2122 DCA 1981)

4. A complaint should not be dismissed unless movant can establish beyond any doubt that
claimant could prove na set of facts whatever in support of his claim. Ingalsebe v. Stewart, 869
So.2d 30 (Fla. 4" DCA 2004); Rohatynsky v. Kalogiannis, 763 So.2d 1270 (Fla. 4" DCA 2000);
Hillman vy. Wainer, 636 So.2d 576 (Fla. 4" DCA 1994).

ALTERNATIVE COUNTS

5 Count Il. OPEN ACCOUNT. Defendant, in its Motion to Dismiss as to. Plaintiffs
Count II, Open Account, claims that "Open Account Claim Fails Where Express Contract
Exists." Plaintiff's Count II for Open Account is specifically brought in Plaintiff's Complaint "In
the Alternative" in order to comply with the Federal Rules. The Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, Rule 8(e)(2) specifically state that "A party may set forth two or more statements of a
claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts
or defenses." Plaintiff has pleaded several counts in the alternative in its Complaint, in
accordance with this Federal Rule. Plaintiff's claim for Open Account should not be dismissed at
this juncture, as this Federal Rule also provides that "A party may also state as many separate
claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal,
equitable, or maritime grounds." Since the Court shall construe the pleadings as to do substantial
justice, Plaintiff's alternate Count II of Open Account should not be dismissed at this juncture
simply because it is being brought as an alternative to the express contract claim because as
many alternative counts may be pled in one pleading as may be brought with a good faith basis.

6. Count V. UNJUST ENRICHMENT. Defendant, in its Motion to Dismiss as to
Plaintiff's Count V, Unjust Enrichment, claims that "Unjust Enrichment Claim Fails Where
Express Contract Exists." Plaintiff's Count V for Unjust Enrichment is specifically brought in

Plaintiffs Complaint "In the Alternative" in order to comply with the Federal Rules. The Federal

 
Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 22 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010 Page 3 of 7

Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 8(e)(2) specifically state that "A party may set forth two or more
statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in
separate counts or defenses." Plaintiff has pleaded several counts in the alternative in its
Complaint, in accordance with this Federal Rule. Plaintiffs claim for Open Account should not
be dismissed at this juncture, as this Federal Rule also provides that "A party may also state as
many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based
on legal, equitable, or maritime grounds." Since the Court shall construe the pleadings as to do
substantial justice, Plaintiffs alternate Count V of Unjust Enrichment should not be dismissed at euro
this juncture simply because it is being brought as an alternative to the express contract claim
because as many alternative counts may be pled in one pleading as may be brought with a good
faith basis.
FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED

7. Count Il, ACCOUNTING. Defendant, in its Motion to Dismiss as to Plaintiff's Count
Ill, Accounting, claims Plaintiff's "Failure to Plead Elements For Accounting," specifically
claiming that Plaintiff has failed to plead a fiduciary relationship exists or that the transactions at
issue are complex. However, Plaintiff has pled in paragraph 32 of its Complaint that "The
relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant is of a fiduciary character as to money, and the
transactions at issue are so involved and complicated that a remedy at law is insufficient to
administer complete justice because the Defendant has refused to allow Plaintiff to perform an
accounting to ascertain Royalties due." Here in the instant matter, Plaintiff and Defendant do
share a fiduciary relationship since they have a complex business transaction involving royalties
and other continuing obligations as set forth in the contract attached to Plaintiff's Complaint.

Plaintiff has properly pled the elements for this Count in its Complaint, and this Count is also

 
Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 22 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010 Page 4 of 7

pled in the alternative. Again, it is well established at law that for purposes of a Motion to
Dismiss, The Court must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and considered in the
light most favorable to the non-moving party. Crocker v. Marks, 856 So.2d 1123 (Fla. 40x00B0 DCA
2003); Siegle v. Progressive 819 So.2d 732 (Fla. 2002). Plaintiffs alternate Count Il of
Accounting should not be dismissed at this juncture because it is being brought as an alternative
to the breach of contract claim, and the proper elements supporting such a cause of action have
been properly pled and will be shown at trial.

8. Count VI. EQUITABLE LIEN. Next, Defendant attempts to imply that an equitable
lien is only granted on real property by stating "granting an equitable lien would be inappropriate
because equitable liens are applied to real property." In fact, the Supreme Court of Florida has
repeatedly found that "the doctrine of equitable liens has a wide application in administering
rights and remedies peculiar to equity jurisprudence." Jones v. Carpenter, 106 So. 127 (Fla.
1925) While it is true that equitable liens can apply to real property, the Florida Supreme Court
has incorporated in its syllabus written regarding equitable liens, a definition of equitable lien
which embodies its special nature, as follows:

"An equitable lien is not an estate or property in the thing itself nor a right to recover

the thing; that is a right which may be the basis of a possessory action. It is simply a

right of a special nature over the thing, which constitutes a charge or encumbrance upon

the thing, so that the very thing itself may be proceeded against in an equitable action..."

Jones v. Carpenter, 106 So. 127 (Fla. 1925) quoting Society of Shakers v. Watson, 68 F.

730 (KY 60x2122 1895).

Here we can clearly see that an equitable lien is of a special nature, and can be applied in the
Court's discretion to ANY property of ANY nature, so this claim is not beyond the reach or
discretion of the Court. Defendant also claims that an "Action for equitable lien fails where

adequate remedy at law exists" but this statement is inaccurate in light of the fact that the Florida

Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that "Equitable liens exists independently of any

 
Case 0:10-cv-60059-PCH Document 22 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/31/2010 Page 5 of 7

express agreement." Jd 127. Here Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a contract whereby
Defendant was to pay to Plaintiff continuing Royalties, showing that Plaintiff and Defendant
share a common interest in the sale of Defendant's products, and also share in the profits of said
sales of products. To place an equitable lien on said profits as the "property" against which an
equitable lien is requested, is well within the acceptable discretion of the Court, particularly in
light of the fact that these "profits" already belong to Plaintiff pursuant to the contracts between
Plaintiff and Defendant. Plaintiff's Count IV for Equitable Lien should not be dismissed at this
juncture because the proper elements supporting such a cause of action have been properly pled
in Plaintiff's Complaint, such a measure is well within the discretion of the Court to reach
substantial justice in this matter, and alleged facts of the Complaint will be shown at trial.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an Order
Denying the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint or treating the Motion as
a Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, granting Plaintiff leave to amend;
Awarding attorney's fees and costs to the extent allowable under the law to the Plaintiff pursuant
to Fed R.Civ Proc. Rule 56(g); and entering any other relief to the Plaintiff as the Court may

deem appropriate and just under the circumstances.
