Case No. 12-C-0806

Parkash Singh Badal,
Defendant.

POST-HEARING BRIEF
IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs’ process server did not serve Parkash Singh Badal. The evidence -including testimony and information from two federal agents, a private security
official, two entirely disinterested local store employees, the Oak Creek Chief of
Police, the United States Attorney, the person who in fact was served, and an
acquaintance of the Chief Minister, along with contemporaneous photographs, emails, and other documents -- demonstrates definitively that it would have been
physically impossible to serve the Chief Minister on August 9th at Oak Creek High
School because he was not there. CM Badal was shopping at Boelter Superstore, 17
miles away. Instead, the process servers erroneously served Surinderpal Singh
Kalra, a Department of Justice-appointed interpreter for the community forum
being held at the high school in the wake of the tragic temple shootings.

served, the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden and as a result, Defendant’s
Motion to Dismiss should be granted.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND LEGAL STANDARD
A.

Procedural History

On August 8, 2012, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Parkash Singh Badal,
the Chief Minister of the State of Punjab, India. R. 1. On August 30, 2012, CM
Badal filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to effectuate
service. R. 3. On October 18, 2012, the plaintiffs filed the returned, executed
summons which reflected that plaintiffs were claiming that CM Badal had been
served on August 9, 2012 at 4:50 p.m. at Oak Creek High School. R. 7.
On October 23, 2012, CM Badal’s counsel notified the court that counsel was
in the process of complying with the federal Touhy regulations to obtain
authorization from the State Department for agent testimony and State
Department documents which would prove that CM Badal was not served. R. 8.
On December 10, 2012, counsel filed a follow-up letter with the Court indicating
that such evidence had been authorized. Attached to that filing with the affidavits
of Special Agents Martin O’Toole and David Scharlat, describing the security detail
CM Badal’s whereabouts on August 9, 2012, and the fact that he had not been
served. R. 11.
Three days later, plaintiffs filed a letter and attached affidavit of the process
server who claimed to have served CM Badal. R. 13. The court scheduled the
matter for an evidentiary hearing. R. 14. Thereafter, Judge Randa recused himself
2
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 2 of 26 Document 46

from the matter and this Court was assigned. After a telephone status conference
on January 14, 2013, this Court set the matter for an evidentiary hearing on
February 21, 2013. R. 19.

As described more fully herein, the evidence at the

hearing proved that CM Badal was nowhere near Oak Creek High School on August
9th, was not served at any time while he was in the United States from August 712, 2012, and that the case was a simple case of mistaken identity: the process
server served the wrong person.
B.

Legal Standard

Defendant may enforce service of process requirements through a pretrial
motion to dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5). Mere knowledge of the lawsuit is
insufficient. A plaintiff must comply with the service requirements of Rule 4.
McMasters v. United States, 260 F.3d 814, 817 (7th Cir. 2001). If plaintiffs fail to
effect proper service, the district court in its discretion must either dismiss the suit
or specify a time within which the plaintiff must accomplish service. Fed. R. Civ. P.
4(m); Cardenas v. City of Chicago, 646 F.3d 1001, 1005 (7th Cir. 2011).
Typically, a process server’s signed return of service provides prima facie
evidence of valid service. When the district court conducts an evidentiary hearing
on the service issue, however, plaintiffs bear the burden to prove valid service by a
preponderance of evidence. Purdue Research Found. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo, S.A., 338
F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003). In other words, the Plaintiffs here must prove it is
“more likely than not” they served Chief Minister Badal. See generally Butler v.

Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 3 of 26 Document 46

Oak Creek-Franklin School Dist., 172 F. Supp. 2d 1102, 1119 (E.D. Wis. 2001)
(Adelman, J.). The bottom line here is that Plaintiffs have the burden of proof.
In light of the multiple versions of the return of service, the process server’s
lack of credibility, and the conclusive evidence this is a case of mistaken identity,
Plaintiffs failed to prove proper service by a preponderance. The case must be
dismissed.
ARGUMENT
I.

Plaintiffs fall far short of proving it is more likely than not they served Chief
Minister Badal. Instead, the evidence overwhelmingly proves a simple case
of mistaken identity.
Plaintiffs claim they served CM Badal with the summons and complaint at

approximately 4:50 p.m. on August 9, 2012, at the Oak Creek High School.
A.

Chief Minister Badal was under a protective detail throughout his
stay, and was not served with any legal papers at any time.

Parkash Singh Badal is the Chief Minister (“CM”) of the State of Punjab,
India. On August 7, 2012, he arrived in the United States. Throughout his six-day
stay, from the time he got off the airplane at O’Hare, CM Badal was under a
protection detail conducted by the United States Department of State’s Diplomatic
Security Service (“State Department”). Tr. 48-50, 63, 165-67. 1 Martin O’Toole, a
special agent (“SA”) with the State Department, was designated as the agent in
charge of the protection detail. Tr. 48. State Department SA David Schlarlat and

court’s docket.

Brown County Det. Sgt. Monica “Nikki” Jossart were among several other law
enforcement agents also on the detail. Tr. 146, 163.
SA O’Toole or another agent was in CM Badal’s immediate presence (“within
arm’s reach”) whenever he was outside his hotel room. They also maintained a
guard at his hotel room door. See Tr. 48, 56, 58, 169. O’Toole, Scharlat, and Jossart
all testified that at no time during his stay in the United States was CM Badal ever
approached by a process server or served with papers. Tr. 63-67, 149, 164-65.
B.

At the time the Plaintiffs claim he was being served, the Chief
Minister was miles away from Oak Creek High School shopping at
Boelter Superstore.
1.

Exhibit 101 and the agents’ testimony

Exhibit 101 is a copy of emails SA O’Toole sent throughout the afternoon of
August 9, 2012. Sent for security purposes, the emails were intended to
contemporaneously track CM Badal’s location and movements. 2 Tr. 51-53.
Corroborated by the testimony of O’Toole, Scharlat, Jossart, Jessica Piorier, Patricia
Guist, and Gagandeep Virk, Exhibit 101 establishes CM Badal was never at Oak
Creek High School on August 9:

Exh. 101, Tr. 51-54, 165, 169.
Critical to this itinerary is that at 4:50 p.m., the time at which plaintiffs
claim their process server was at OCHS serving the papers, CM Badal was
shopping at Boelter Superstore, 17 miles north of the school. Tr. 51, 55-56,
146-47, 164-66. At no time on August 9th was the Chief Minister at Oak Creek
High School. Tr. 51, 62, 148-49, 151. And at no time that day was the Chief
Minister approached by a process server or anyone else who handed him papers.
Tr. 62.
As further corroboration for CM Badal’s whereabouts throughout the
afternoon of August 9, the Court heard testimony from two witnesses who do not
know the Chief Minister, had no involvement with his security or his travels, and
who had no interest in the outcome of this litigation: Jessica Piorier and Patricia
Guist.
2.

Ms. Piorier -- George Watts & Sons

Ms. Piorier is the buyer at George Watts. She recalled August 9th because
the “Prime Minister of Punjab” and a group traveling with him visited George
Watts that day, protected by a federal security detail. Tr. 81-82, 97, 99-100; Exh.
102, 103. Ms. Piorier recounted that the entourage arrived at Watts around 2:30
p.m., shopped and had tea for about two hours, and left around 4:30 p.m. Tr. 82-83,
85-86, 90. Ms. Piorier identified photographs of CM Badal and others with him at
George Watts that day. Tr. 86-87, 93-95; Exh. 113, Exh. 114. 3
Gagandeep “Greg” Virk and SA O’Toole reviewed Exhibit 113. In addition to recognizing it as
having been taken at Watts that day, they identified the four gentlemen in the photograph as, from
3

6
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 6 of 26 Document 46

Further corroborating CM Badal’s visit to Watts that day, Ms. Piorier
identified an email she sent to a New York vendor, in which she wrote that she was
working with “a very important client right now (a prime minister!)…” The email
was time-stamped August 9, 2012 at 4:13 p.m. (CDT). Id. at 87-91; Exh. 102. Ms.
Piorier was “very certain” the Chief Minister’s group was still at the store when she
sent the email. Tr. 87, 89.
Ms. Piorier’s testimony is compelling. As this Court characterized her during
the hearing, she has no “dog in this fight.” Tr. 176. Ms. Piorier does not know any
of the people involved in the litigation, has no interest in the outcome of this case,
and her email corroborates her own recollection and that of the agents regarding
Chief Minister Badal’s whereabouts that afternoon. The CM was at Watts until
approximately 4:20 pm.
3.

Ms. Patricia Guist -- Boelter Superstore

Like Jess Piorier, Patricia Guist has no dog in this fight. She is a manager of
the Boelter Superstore, a restaurant supply store located seven miles north of
Milwaukee. Tr. 103. She does not know any of the people involved in the litigation,
and has no interest in the outcome of the case.
The CM’s entourage arrived at Boelter around 4:45 pm, shopped for 20 or 30
minutes, and left shortly after the store’s 5:00 p.m. closing time. Tr. 62, 104-06,

left: Chief Minister Badal, Greg Virk, Harbans Virk, and a doctor from Chicago. Tr. 60-61, 72-73,
157. The two also identified Exhibit 114 as having been taken at Watts, and depicting Chief
Minister Badal, a security agent named Mr. Rampal, and Harbans Virk. That photograph was timestamped as having been taken at 3:12 p.m. CDT. Tr. 61, 73, 157-59.

Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 7 of 26 Document 46

117-18, 148, 150. 4 Ms. Guist was working that day, and described the visit as
“pretty memorable”: “I mean, this doesn’t happen every day, you know, when a
group like this comes in, so it was pretty memorable.” Tr. 114, 118-19. Ms. Guist
was confident the group was at the store in the very late afternoon of August 9th,
close to closing time, based on an email she wrote and based on sales documents
generated by Boelter for purchases made by members of the group. Tr. 108-113;
Exh. 104-106, 123.
Ms. Guist identified orders placed by members of CM Badal’s entourage,
including a potato peeler purchased by an individual named “Amrik” at 4:43 p.m. on
August 9th, 5 and items ordered for the “Diplomatic Party of the Chief Deputy of
Punjab.” Tr. 109-113; Exh. 104-106, 123.
Ms. Guist recalled that a little after the store’s 5:00 pm closing time, all but
one of the people in the entourage left. One person (later identified as Gagandeep
“Greg” Virk) stayed behind because he needed to go to the bank, and Ms. Guist
offered to drive him before the bank closed at 5:30 pm. Tr. 106-07, 116, 119-20.
When they arrived back at Boelter after the trip to the bank, Jossart returned to
Boelter to pick him up and take him back to the hotel to re-join the group. Tr. 162,
166, 169.
Once everyone had left Boelter, Ms. Guist sent an email to Boelter
management. Tr. 108; Exh. 104. In the email, which is time/date stamped for
At approximately 3:30 p.m. on August 9, 2012, SA Scharlat went to Boelter to check the store for
security in anticipation of Chief Minister Badal’s entourage visiting the store. Tr. 104-105, 115, 14748, 150.
5 Gagandeep Virk identified “Amrik” as a doctor from India with whom the Chief Minister was
traveling. Tr. 159.

Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 8 of 26 Document 46

Thursday, August 9 at 6:07 p.m., Ms. Guist stated: “Today, we had a visit from the
Chief Deputy of Punjab and his diplomatic party.” Id.
In light of the testimony from Ms. Piorier and Ms. Guist, and the emails and
documents from Boelter and George Watts, and corroborated by the testimony of
the agents who conducted the protective detail, it is physically impossible for the
Chief Minister to have been served by a process server at 4:50 p.m. in Oak Creek.
4.

Gagandeep “Greg” Virk

Greg Virk is a 30 year old business manager for an IT company in
Philadelphia, and is a family friend of CM Badal. Tr. 152-53, 161. Mr. Virk has
met the Chief Minister many times both in the United States and India. Tr. 161.
Mr. Virk and his uncle, Harbans Virk, were in Wisconsin and met the Chief
Minister on August 9th at the State Fair. Tr. 54-55, 153-55. Mr. Virk identified
photographs taken at the State Fair of the Chief Minister and others in his
entourage that day, (taken and time stamped for the mid-afternoon). See Tr. 57-59,
154-57; Exh. 110-112. Mr. Virk explained that after the State Fair, he accompanied
the Chief Minister to George Watts & Sons, and thereafter to Boelter Superstore.
Tr. 55-56; 157-59. They made no stops or detours between the State Fair and
George Watts, and likewise no stops or detours between Watts and Boelter. Tr. 56,
159.
Mr. Virk recalled that when the entourage arrived at Boelter, the store was
still open. Tr. 160. He confirmed Ms. Guist’s account that he needed to go the
bank, left Boelter with Ms. Guist to drive to the bank a little after 5:00 p.m., and

9
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 9 of 26 Document 46

arrived back at Boelter around 5:15 or 5:30, after it had closed and after the rest of
the entourage had already left. Tr. 159-162. Jossart returned to Boelter to pick
him up, and they arrived back at the hotel around 6:00 p.m. Tr. 162, 166, 169-70.
According to Mr. Virk, during the entire afternoon when Mr. Virk was with
the Chief Minister, the Chief Minister never went to Oak Creek High School and
was never served with papers. Tr. 162.
C.

Events at Oak Creek High School that day

The plaintiffs’ process server, Christopher Kratochvil, has testified and
repeatedly sworn under oath that he served the papers for the lawsuit at Oak Creek
High School on August 9, 2012 at 4:50 p.m. Kratochvil states he served a slim, thin,
elderly gentleman, 5’11 to 6’ tall, with glasses and a white full beard who was
standing in front of the main stage prior to the start of the August 9th program at
OCHS. Tr. 15. In fact, an elderly, thin, 6’ tall gentleman, standing in front of the
stage just prior to the start of the program, was served with the exact legal papers
in question -- the ones bearing Kratochvil’s original process server stamp. See Tr.
120-125; Exh. 100, 100A. That person was Surinderpal Singh Kalra.
The August 9th event at OCHS was arranged by the U.S. Department of
Justice and the local United States Attorney’s Office. See Exh. 119. The
government had requested Mr. Kalra attend the event to serve as an interpreter.
Tr. 121; see also Exh. 100B (email invitation to Mr. Kalra and directions to Oak
Creek High School) and Exh. 120 (email of AUSA Susan Knepel identifying
Surinderpal Singh and one of the two interpreters at the August 9 event).

10
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 10 of 26 Document 46

Mr. Kalra testified at the February 21 hearing and in a subsequent
deposition that while standing in front of the high school stage prior to the start of
the event, someone quickly approached him, handed him some papers, and quickly
walked away. Tr. 123; R. 33-1 at 68-76. Mr. Kalra took the papers, forgot all about
them because they did not mean anything to him, and then discovered them in the
trunk of his car several months later. 6 R. 33-1 (Deposition Tr. 89-110).
Information from James Edwards, Oak Creek Chief of Police, and United
States Attorney James L. Santelle, both of whom served on the panel for the August
9th community forum, corroborate Mr. Kalra’s recollection. Tr. at 139, 144; Exh.
115-117. 7 Chief Edwards did not see CM Badal there. After the formal part of the
event, Chief Edwards spent considerable time discussing security matters with a
large contingent from the Sikh community. “I was introduced to quite a few people
who were important in the Sikh community,” but the Chief Minister was not among
them. Tr. 142. Moreover, the Oak Creek Police Department conducted operational
planning and security for the event. Tr. 140. If a dignitary or a protective detail
had planned to attend the event, the Oak Creek Police Department would have
been notified. Tr. 140-41. He explained they were notified the Chief Minister might
possibly show, but in the end, the Chief Minister did not attend. Tr. 140-151.

Mr. Kalra’s lack of focus on the papers, and the fact that he quickly forgot about them, is certainly
understandable. He was at the August 9th community forum to assist the Sikh community after the
horrific and senseless shootings which had just occurred.
7
The Department of Justice also provided a handout listing the moderator and “Key Community
Leaders” who attended the event. Among them were Chief Edwards, USA Santelle, representative
from the temple and for victims’ families, and representatives from law enforcement and Washington
D.C.-based organizations. The Chief Minister’s name did not appear on the handout. Exh. 119.
6

11
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 11 of 26 Document 46

Mr. Kalra’s recollection is likewise independently verified by United States
Attorney James L. Santelle:
Jim Santelle was aware before the program started that some papers
were received by the interpreter, who was not on the stage. Someone
from the Gudwara [congregation] had the papers and approached Jim about
what the papers were. Because the program was beginning, Jim said that he
would talk with them about the papers after the program, but then after the
program, there was no discussion, and Jim does not know what happened to
the papers.
Tr. 138; Exh. 120 (email from AUSA Knepel (emphasis added)).
All of this evidence proves convincingly that CM Badal did not attend the
August 9th community forum, and that the summons and complaint were served on
Mr. Kalra, not on Chief Minister Badal.
D.

The only “evidence” supporting the plaintiffs’ position is the
incredible, unreliable testimony of plaintiffs’ process server,
Christopher Kratochvil.

Christoper Kratochvil’s information and testimony is rife with
inconsistencies, contradictions, and impossibilities. It cannot support a finding that
it is “more likely than not” that CM Badal was served.
The testimony of and exhibits from the numerous other disinterested
witnesses, from store employees to law enforcement officials (those who, in the
words of the Court, have “no dog in this fight.” Tr. 176), establish beyond any doubt
that CM Badal was not at Oak Creek High School on the afternoon of August 9,
2012. But even considered in isolation, Kratochvil’s testimony is not sufficiently
credible to establish proper service by a preponderance of the evidence.

12
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 12 of 26 Document 46

1.

Kratochvil’s conflicting statements regarding whether he
actually believes he served CM Badal.

Kratchovil’s memory has “improved,” becoming more and more certain about
the August 9th service as time goes on and as the plaintiffs have become aware of
the problems with his information. Kratochvil claims to have had a very brief
encounter with CM Badal at Oak Creek High School on August 9th -- one lasting
just long enough to hand him the complaint. Id. 15. Based on this brief encounter,
Kratochvil initially swore under oath only that “[u]pon information and belief,” he
had served CM Badal. Tr. 27; Exh. 125; R. 7. At the evidentiary hearing before this
Court on February 21, 2013, Kratochvil similarly hedged, testifying that based on a
news clip of Badal, he “appears” to be the person who he served. Tr. 19; R. 43 at 3.
However, after the hearing, when Kratochvil was undoubtedly aware of his
mistake, Kratochvil became much more certain of the identification (through his
seemingly retro-engineered view of the incident). On March 14, 2013, Kratochvil
swore under oath that “there is no question in my mind” that CM Badal was the
person he served. R. 33-2 (March 14, 2013 Affidavit at ¶ 7). This ever-improving
sense of certainty undermines his credibility. 8
2.

Kratochivil’s conflicting versions of his observations
of Chief Minister Badal at Oak Creek High School on
August 9, 2012.

In his October 26, 2012 affidavit (which plaintiffs filed with the Court in
December 2012 after receiving the affidavits of the two agents), Kratochvil swore

His lack of genuine experience in identifying Sikh gentlemen, particularly those whose
distinguishing facial features are often, in large part covered, by beards, moustaches, and turbans,
make Kratochvil’s identification and testimony even more suspect.
8

13
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 13 of 26 Document 46

that he observed CM Badal and then “notified my co-worker that I had spotted the
defendant.” Tr. 29; Exh. 126; R.13-1. At the evidentiary hearing, however,
Kratochvil described the circumstances differently. Tr. 30. He testified that
“[a]ctually, my co-worker, Joe, spotted him originally, pointed him out to me.” 9 Tr.
14.
As another obvious example of Kratochvil’s ever-changing account of August
9th, Kratochvil swore in his affidavit that he first saw CM Badal standing on the
floor of the auditorium in front of the stage, talking to a man “wearing Indian garb.”
R. 13 at p. 2. He said there were two men in western style business suits around
him. Id. In contrast, at the hearing, Kratochvil testified he was “positive they were
all wearing Western clothes. He was the -- the individual I served was the only one
that appeared to be wearing Indian attire in that small cluster of people that were
together there.” Tr. 16.
3.

Kratochvil’s conflicting versions of what he did after
service of the complaint.

Kratochvil testified on direct examination that after accomplishing service,
he went home. Tr. 19-20. His brother contacted him the same evening, and
confirmed he (the brother) had just seen CM Badal, the person they served, on
television. Tr. 19-20. When confronted on cross examination with the fact that he
had signed two different typed affidavits of service, both dated August 9 (Exhs. 124

Joseph testified that he had only a photograph to use to try to make the identification, that he was
40 feet away from the person, who was turned off to the side, when he made the supposed
identification. Tr. 36, 38, 42. Joseph testified “We both -- I saw him first, I guess, technically. I
said, I believe that’s the gentleman we’re attempting to serve.” Tr. 37. Joseph “believe[s]” they
served the right person. Tr. 39.
9

14
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 14 of 26 Document 46

and 125), Kratochvil changed his story and said that perhaps after accomplishing
service, he had gone to the office and dictated the two affidavits before going home.
Tr. 26-29. When pressed further, he claimed no recollection whatsoever of when he
completed the affidavits, or why he signed the two different affidavits, both dated
August 9th. Tr. 26-29.
Perhaps as a way to explain his initial story about going home, Kratochvil
conceded that he may have signed the affidavits on a later date, even though they
were dated and notarized August 9, the same day of the purported service. Tr. 26.
Kratochvil had no explanation as to why he needed to prepare two different
affidavits of service. Tr. 28. In fact, Kratochvil eventually could not even remember
what day of the week he served the complaint or what actions he took after the
purported service. Tr. 27. “… [T]o be honest with you, I don’t take notes on when I
fill out the affidavit…. To be honest with you, I don’t really recall.” Id.
4.

Kratochvil gave conflicting information on the height and
weight of the person served.

Kratochvil testified that prior to serving the summons and complaint, he was
not informed of Badal’s height and weight. Tr. at 25. He had only video and
photographs. Tr. 11. Kratochvil’s initial (purportedly contemporaneous) affidavits
memorializing the service gave no physical description of the person he had served.
Exh. 124, 125. In contrast, however, in his October 26th affidavit, Kratochvil swore
under oath that CM Badal was 5’-11” or 6-feet tall and had medium build. R. 13-1;
Exhibit 126. At the February 21 hearing, Kratochvil said that the person served
was a “tall, thin gentleman…. He was rather tall and thin and elderly.” Tr. 15. In

fact, CM Badal is taller than 6’2”, and his build (while not overly heavy) would
certainly not be described as slim or thin. Tr. 161-162; Exhs. 111-112.
5.

Kratochvil gave conflicting information on what Badal
was wearing.

In Kratochvil’s two affidavits of service, he provided no description of what
CM Badal was purportedly wearing on August 9th. See Exhs. 124, 125. In his
October 26, 2012, affidavit, Kratochvil stated that CM Badal was wearing a “tuniclike” outfit,” but did not provide the color of the outfit or any further description.
Exh. 126. At the February 21, 2013 hearing, Kratochvil changed the description,
simply calling the clothing “Indian garb,” but again with no color provided. Tr. 15.
Finally, in his March 14, 2013 affidavit (and referenced in a footnote in Plaintiffs’
brief), Kratochvil claimed for the first time that Badal was wearing “blue Indian
garb.” R. 33-2 (March 14, 2013 Affidavit at ¶ 5); R. 43 at 3 n.2.
In fact, the contemporaneous photographs of CM Badal taken on the
afternoon August 9th show Badal was wearing an un-tucked, grey Western style
button-front shirt and slacks of a matching grey fabric. Exhs. 110-114.
6.

Kratochvil never confirmed that day that the person he
served was Badal, and no one else at the August 9 event
corroborates Kratochvil’s version of what happened.

Kratochvil testified that the person he served did not speak to him. Tr. 15.
Kratochvil admitted he did nothing to confirm that the person served was, in fact,
CM Badal. He asked for no identification, nor did he speak with anyone else at the
event (other than his brother, who was there for the same short time and who also
had no prior interaction with CM Badal). Of the dozens of people at Oak Creek
16
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 16 of 26 Document 46

High School on August 9, 2012, not one has come forward to confirm that Badal was
there. In fact, during the telephonic status hearing with the Court on January 11,
2013, Plaintiffs indicated that they would call several “citizen witnesses” who had
been in attendance at the August 9th event and who would verify that CM Badal
was there. No such evidence was ever produced. Nor could it have been, since no
such evidence exists.
In sum, Plaintiffs characterize the process servers as “experienced and
capable” whose services “remarkably” have never been “thrown out” in 15 years. R.
43 at 2. That is “remarkable,” given the obvious error Kratochvil made here.
E.

Plaintiffs’ Brief is a combination of unfounded legal theories
and baseless attacks on the witnesses.

Faced with the avalanche of evidence proving the mistake by the process
server, Plaintiffs proffer frivolous legal theories and undertake disingenuous, unfair
and unfounded attacks on witnesses, in a desperate attempt to keep this case alive.
1.

Plaintiffs’ missing witness theory.

Plaintiffs incorrectly characterize almost all of the witnesses, from the agents
to the store employees, as “peripheral” because those witnesses don’t speak to Mr.
Kalra’s or (or defense counsel’s) possession of the papers. To the contrary, the
witnesses and exhibits speak to the sole, central issue in the case: whether or not
CM Badal was served with the summons and complaint. Moreover, the defense did
explain how they received the papers: Plaintiffs’ process server mistakenly served
Surinderpal Kalra. When Mr. Kalra located the papers, he immediately informed
and provided them directly to defense counsel. Defense counsel immediately filed
17
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 17 of 26 Document 46

the papers with the Court, the day before the hearing. 10 R. 24 (original summons
and complaint, with file stamps and original process server signature, filed by
defendant’s counsel a day before the hearing, February 20, 2013).
Plaintiffs argue that CM Badal should have provided sworn testimony at the
evidentiary hearing, or submitted an affidavit, regarding the service issue. R. 43 at
3-5. They suggest the Court cannot make a finding that CM Badal was not served,
without Badal’s testimony. And because Badal did not do so, they suggest the Court
should apply the “missing witness rule.” Id. at 4-5 (citing Relational, LLC v. Hodges,
627 F.3d 668 (7th Cir. 2010), Advocate South Suburban Hosp. v. N.L.R.B., 468 F.3d
1038, 1049 (7th Cir. 2006) and Oxman v. WLS-TV, 12 F.3d 652 (7th Cir. 1993)).
Plaintiffs misconstrue the missing witness rule, a rule which is most often
applied in the trial context, as an instruction to the jury. First, the absence of
evidence “does not cut in favor of the one who bears the burden of proof on an issue.”
N.L.R.B. v. Louis A. Weiss Memorial Hosp., 172 F.3d 432, 446 (7th Cir. 1999)(citing
Howard v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 160 F.3d 358, 360 (7th Cir. 1998)); Boardman v.

Plaintiffs’ theory of this case is factually outlandish and frivolous. They theorize that: Mr. Badal
was served as their process server claims, took them back to India with him, gave them to other
government officials who brought them back with them to the United States when they came on
February 12th to assist counsel in preparing for the hearing, and gave the papers to Mr. Kalra while
he waited at the Pfister Hotel prior to his testimony. R. 43 at 8.
To believe this, one would have to accept the following: (1) the three law enforcement officers
conspired and lied about the Chief Minister’s whereabouts; (2) the two store employees and Mr.
Virk were in on that conspiracy, and lied throughout their testimony about the Chief Minister’s
whereabouts; (3) the State Department somehow dummied up an email for use to falsely establish
the Chief Minister’s whereabouts; (4) photographs were doctored to show the Chief Minister at the
State Fair and Watts, as the witnesses testified; (5) United States Attorney James L. Santelle lied
about knowing the interpreter had been served with papers; (6) counsel for the defense obtained the
papers from the government delegation from India and electronically filed them, before the papers
were even given to Mr. Kalra; and (7) counsel for CM Badal suborned perjury during the hearing and
Kalra’s deposition, when they allowed Mr. Kalra to testify that he gave the papers to Steve Biskupic
within a day of locating them.

Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 18 of 26 Document 46

National Medical Enterprises, 106 F.3d 840, 844 (8th Cir. 1997) (explaining that
drawing adverse inference from failure of a party to put on a witness relevant to an
issue is “most reasonable” when it is the party with the burden of proof on that
issue who fails to do so); Oxygenated Fuels Assoc. Inc. v. Pataki, 293 F. Supp. 2d
170, 176 n.2 (N.D.N.Y. 2003).

That the Chief Mihister was not called as a witness

or did not provide an affidavit cannot inure to the benefit of Plaintiffs, who bear the
burden of proof here.
Second, the rule does not apply when potential testimony would have been
cumulative or was equally available from other witnesses. Here, had CM Badal
testified, he obviously would have testified he had not been served and instead was
shopping at Boelter at 4:50 pm on August 9, testimony which would have been
cumulative of the testimony of O’Toole, Schlarlat, Jossart, Piorier, Guist, Virk,
Edwards and Kalra. The Plaintiffs have not described any evidence they think
might have been so peculiarly within CM Badal’s control as not to be cumulative.
Third, and most obviously, application of an adverse inference against a
defendant in these circumstances would be fundamentally unfair. If a defendant
takes issue with plaintiff’s affidavit of service, under Plaintiffs’ view the defendant
must appear in court for testimony (and subject himself to service), as the only way
to avoid the adverse inference. CM Badal has taken the position from the outset of
this lawsuit that Plaintiffs failed to serve him. Despite Plaintiffs’ suggestion to the
contrary, there is no additional light CM Badal possibly could shed on the process

19
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 19 of 26 Document 46

server’s mistake, as he was at least 17 miles away when the erroneous service
occurred.
If the missing witness rule has any applicability here, it would apply to the
“witnesses” that plaintiffs promised to present at the hearing -- those several
“citizen witnesses” who plaintiffs claimed had been in attendance at the August 9th
event and who would supposedly were going to verify CM Badal’s presence there.
No such evidence was ever produced, and for obvious reason: CM Badal was not
there.
2.

Plaintiffs’ unfounded attacks on the State Department witnesses

Plaintiffs suggest that the State Department agents’ testimony and
information should be rejected for three reasons: (1) the State Department did not
try to obtain or preserve video footage from Boelter; (2) the circumstances of
O’Toole’s later interview of the process server and the fact that he did not provide a
copy of the written statement to Kratochvil; and (3) the State Department’s refusal
to provide the written statement to the Court or counsel during the evidentiary
hearing. Plaintiffs’ attacks are meritless.
First, what possible reason would the State Department have for getting
video surveillance from Boelter? The State Department was not responsible for
investigating this matter. They had no responsibility or burden to prove service or
the lack of service. Their responsibility was the Chief Minister’s safety. ‘
Second, as this Court is surely aware, law enforcement officers do not
typically leave copies of a written interview statement with the interviewee.

20
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 20 of 26 Document 46

Third, O’Toole’s and the State Department’s refusal to provide the written
statement during the hearing does not “betray[] a State Department bias,” (R. 43 at
9) but instead demonstrates an attempt to comply with its own (Touhy) regulations.
Despite knowing since at least December 10, 2012 about the State Department
security detail, and having been informed by CM Badal’s counsel’s letter of October
23, 2012 referencing compliance with the Touhy regulations, Plaintiffs never made
any request (Touhy compliant or not) for any information from the State
Department. See R. 11. CM Badal made a proper request, and the State
Department agents were allowed to testify at the hearing and submit an affidavit.
3.

Attempts to discredit Virk and Edwards

Plaintiffs fault Greg Virk for being “separated from the group” at Boelter, and
for failing to take pictures there. In fact, according to Virk’s testimony under cross
examination by the plaintiffs, Virk separated from the group “a little after 5:00 pm,”
and rejoined the group back at the hotel. There was no suggestion in any testimony
from Virk or any other witness that Virk was not with CM Badal at Boelter, around
4:50 p.m. Tr. 162.
With respect to the “failure to take pictures,” Virk was under no obligation to
photograph CM Badal’s 20 minute stop at a restaurant supply store. That fact is
not a reason to discount Virk’s testimony about the events that day.
Plaintiffs attempt to explain away or ignore Chief Edwards’ testimony by
suggesting he may simply not have noticed CM Badal at the event at the high
school. But that argument ignores Chief Edwards’ meetings with important

21
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 21 of 26 Document 46

members of the community immediately after the event, and ignores the fact that
the Oak Creek Police Department was conducting security at the event and would
have been notified if a security/protective detail had arrived.
4.

Plaintiffs’ attempts to discredit Mr. Kalra are unfair and
unfounded.

Having made no headway on cross examination with Mr. Kalra at the
evidentiary hearing, plaintiffs sought Mr. Kalra’s post-hearing deposition, and now
try to rely on several “gotcha” moments from that three-hour deposition. Mr. Kalra
is a 69-year-old retired business analyst who had never previously been asked or
required to testify in court or a deposition, and, like so many of the other witnesses,
has no dog in this fight. R.33-1 (Deposition Tr. 5-7). Plaintiffs’ attacks on Mr.
Kalra are unfair and unfounded.
First, Mr. Kalra has no connection with the Defendant. Tr. 38. Mr. Kalra
considers himself to be a human rights activist and has helped prepare protest
petitions seeking relief for human rights abuses. R. 33-1 at 33-38. Mr. Kalra
served as an interpreter at the August 9 DOJ event out of a sense of duty and as a
natural follow-up to the services he supplied on the day of the tragic shooting. R.
33-1 at 44-48.
Second, Mr. Kalra’s account of August 9 has been independently
corroborated by the Chief of Police and the United States Attorney.
Third, Plaintiffs’ attacks on the credibility of Mr. Kalra are nothing more
than innuendo and an entirely unfair and unfounded twisting of his words. For
example, they contend that Mr. Kalra’s presence at the Pfister Hotel with members
22
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 22 of 26 Document 46

of the government delegation from India somehow casts a shadow over his
testimony. In fact, Mr. Kalra was at the Pfister because witnesses were
sequestered during the 5-hour hearing. Kalra testified that while at the Pfister, he
did not discuss his testimony with anyone and simply passed the time by reciting
scripture:
A:
I was actually so much in myself. I was doing my part -- I was in my
heart of heart reading scriptures -- reciting scriptures. …
R. 33-1 at 146. He also made clear that he was never told what to say:
Q:
A:
Q:
A:
Q:
A:

Did they tell you what they expected you to say?
No.
Did you tell them what you expected to say?
No. Why would I?
You didn’t discuss your testimony at all?
No. I did not discuss with them.

R. 33-1 at 149. Plaintiffs unfairly and purposefully ignore this testimony.
As another unfair attempt to discredit Mr. Kalra, Plaintiffs contend that Mr.
Kalra must have been lying when he said he had not noticed the folder containing
the summons and complaint in his trunk until recently, and that he didn’t think
about the court papers until he was contacted about the lawsuit in late January. R.
43 at 6-7. But of course, as Mr. Kalra explained, he paid no attention to the papers
when he first received them, as he did not know what they were. Given that he had
no awareness of the litigation, there is absolutely no reason to believe he would
have appreciated their significance or noticed them in his trunk.
Likewise, when he signed the affidavit in late January, there is every reason
to believe that Mr. Kalra simply had forgotten that, over five months ago, he had
23
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 23 of 26 Document 46

received some unidentified papers from an unknown person at the start of the
community forum, did not appreciate their significance, put the unidentified papers
into his folder, and later left them in the trunk of his car.
As yet another example, Plaintiffs twist Mr. Kalra’s use of the word “lawsuit”
to claim that Mr. Kalra gave conflicting testimony about when he learned of this
matter. Mr. Kalra testified that he first learned of the “lawsuit” after receiving the
subpoena in February of 2013. R. 33-1 (Deposition Tr. 121). Plaintiffs dispute this
by submitting affidavits contending that Mr. Kalra discussed the lawsuit in
December 2012. Yet Mr. Kalra also testified that he had previously read about
lawsuits against Chief Minister Badal.
Q:

What do you know about the lawsuit itself? Do you know what the
claims are or anything about what’s being charged in the lawsuit?

A:

Well, I have read in the newspapers. As I said before, I’m a reader of
newspapers, and I read in the newspaper that Sikhs for Justice … are
pursuing Mr. Badal….

Q:

For What?

A:

Human rights violations.

R. 33-1 at 123-24.
In context, Mr. Kalra’s testimony regarding his knowledge of the “lawsuit”
simply distinguishes between his general knowledge and his specific knowledge
once he discovered the actual physical documents, the complaint. The testimony
hardly undermines his credibility. 11

Likewise, the affidavits submitted by Plaintiffs along with their brief (R.44, Exhibits E-G) are
irrelevant, and certainly do nothing to undermine Mr. Kalra’s credibility.
11

24
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 24 of 26 Document 46

Plaintiffs’ argument illustrates their willingness to do virtually anything to
keep this case alive -- including baseless attacks on Mr. Kalra, whose involvement
came as a result of his attempts to assist the Sikh community in the immediate
wake of the horrific, senseless, tragic violence targeted at peaceful citizens.
CONCLUSION
The evidence proves overwhelmingly and definitively that Chief Minister
Badal was not served with the summons and complaint at OCHS on August 9th at
4:50 p.m. The timing and content of the emails, the photographs, and the
testimony of the many witnesses who were in the immediate presence of Chief
Minister Badal that day, make it physically impossible for the process server’s claim
to be true. At 4:50 p.m., the Chief Minister was 17 miles north of OCHS, shopping
for kitchenware at Boelter Superstore.
Plaintiffs’ entire brief is an attempt to shift the burden of proof to the
defendant, to require him to prove he was not served. While that is not the law, the
Defendant has done so, and by proof beyond any doubt. Plaintiffs also suggest that
the Defendant’s motion “hangs entirely on the testimony and credibility of Mr.
Kalra.” R. 43 at 10. That is obviously not the case, in light of the overwhelming
evidence that the Chief Minister was not even at Oak Creek High School on August
9th. But at the same time, the Defendant is happy to embrace Mr. Kalra’s credible
and corroborated testimony.

25
Case 2:12-cv-00806-LA Filed 05/03/13 Page 25 of 26 Document 46

Plaintiffs ignore the burden of proof. They ignore the mountain of evidence
demonstrating they failed to effect service. They misconstrue evidence to try to
justify or support their outlandish conspiracy theories. And, most troubling, they
unfairly and unprofessionally impugn the integrity of witnesses who have no stake
or interest whatsoever in this litigation. Their tactics should not be tolerated.
Plaintiffs have failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, they
served Chief Minister Badal. The case should be dismissed.
