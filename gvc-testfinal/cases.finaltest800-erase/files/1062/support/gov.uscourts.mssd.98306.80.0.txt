DEFENDANTS

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO FILE EXHIBITS UNDER SEAL
Pursuant to Local Uniform Rule 79(e), reserving all rights and defenses, Defendants
respectfully request that the Court’s permission to file certain exhibits to their Response to
Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction under seal. In support of their Motion, Defendants
state as follows:
1.

This case involves an allegation that Plaintiff John Doe violated the University of

Mississippi’s sexual misconduct policy.
2.

The Court has already ruled that, because of the nature of the suit and the

underlying allegations, Plaintiff should be able to proceed pseudonymously and the
complainant’s identity should also be shielded.
3.

Defendants have filed a Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary

Injunction. Certain exhibits to this Response identify both John Doe, Jane Roe, as well as other
students. Each of these exhibits contains documents marked “Confidential” under the terms of
the Protective Order the Court has already entered [Doc. 74].
4.

Filing Defendants’ exhibits under seal is the best way to protect the identities of

Doe, Roe, and other students.

5.

Defendants’ Response and supporting Brief need not be filed under seal because

they do not identify Doe, Roe, or other students.
6.

In light of the nature of the present request, Defendants request that they be

relieved from filing an accompanying memorandum under Local Uniform Civil Rule 79(e)(4).
While Defendants do not intend to submit a confidential memorandum, they will separately
provide the exhibits to the Court for in camera review.
FOR THESE REASONS, Defendants respectfully request that the Court allow them to
file Exhibits “2”, “4,” “5,” “6,” and “8” to its Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary
Injunction under seal. Defendants request such other relief as the Court deems appropriate under
the circumstances.
THIS, the 3rd day of August, 2018.
Respectfully submitted,
THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI, STATE
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING, TRACY
MURRY, HONEY USSERY, AND THE STATE OF
MISSISSIPPI
