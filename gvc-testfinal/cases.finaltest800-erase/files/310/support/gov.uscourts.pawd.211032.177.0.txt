IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
JOHNSTOWN DIVISION

ANTHONY J. ZANGHI, et al.,
Plaintiffs,

No. 3:13-CV-00146
Hon. Kim R. Gibson

v.
FREIGHTCAR AMERICA, INC., et al.,
Defendants.

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
FreightCar America, Inc. (“FreightCar”), hereby moves this Court to reconsider its
Memorandum Opinion and Order of Court denying FreightCar’s motion for summary judgment.
Reconsideration is warranted to address two aspects of the Court’s ruling related to the nature
and duration of the parties’ obligations under Side Letter 22. First, contrary to the Court’s
ruling, the express language of Side Letter 22 does not support the Court’s finding that
FreightCar assumed an ongoing obligation to provide “mirrored benefits.” Instead, FreightCar
and the USW agreed that, within 60 days of FreightCar’s closing on Bethlehem’s Johnstown
Facility, they would “create” employee benefit plans that would “replace” the Bethlehem plans.
Second, even if Side Letter 22 did place continuing or ongoing obligations on the parties, these
obligations ceased no later than 1997. Although other side letters were incorporated into the
1997 collective bargaining agreement, Side Letter 22 was not. By holding that Side Letter 22
imposed continuing obligations, this Court failed to give effect to the merger and zipper clauses
in the 1997 CBA.

its order denying FreightCar’s motion for summary judgment.
