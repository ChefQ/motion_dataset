IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
JOHNSTOWN DIVISION

ANTHONY J. ZANGHI, et al.,
Plaintiffs,

No. 3:13-CV-00146
Hon. Kim R. Gibson

v.
FREIGHTCAR AMERICA, INC., et al.,
Defendants.

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT RULING
In denying the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, this Court found there to be
a material issue of disputed fact as to when FreightCar’s obligations under Side Letter 22 were
discharged. In particular, the Court found it to be disputed whether Side Letter 22 (which was
signed in 1991) was removed from the collective bargaining agreement in 1994 or 1997.
FreightCar moves this Court for reconsideration. Although FreightCar respectfully
disagrees with the Court’s assessment of the historical evidence regarding when Side Letter 22
was formally withdrawn, the point of this motion is not to relitigate issues that this Court has
already decided. Rather, in FreightCar’s view, there are two additional issues—not addressed by
the Court’s ruling on summary judgment—that moot the dispute that this Court would otherwise
require a trial to resolve.
First, although the Court found there to be a dispute as to when Side Letter 22 dropped
out of the CBA, it does not appear to have determined whether Side Letter 22—by its written
terms—created a continuing obligation. Because the text of Side Letter 22 is unambiguous in
requiring a one-time mirroring process—and FreightCar was obligated to provide a draft of a

AMECURRENT 716007839.5 28-Apr-15 15:50

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 2 of 11

plan complying with that mirroring process within 60 days of closing—there is no need for the
Court to decide when Side Letter 22 was formally withdrawn. The upshot of the text of Side
Letter 22 is that the parties were required to negotiate the terms of a plan that mirrored the
Bethlehem PHMB in material respects. FreightCar and the Union discharged that obligation by
crafting the new plan, which required FreightCar to continue benefits “subject to collective
bargaining.” There is no dispute that FreightCar ultimately eliminated certain future benefits
“subject to collective bargaining” by bargaining to impasse. So irrespective of when it was
formally withdrawn, Side Letter 22 posed no obstacle to FreightCar’s actions and this Court
should enter summary judgment in favor of FreightCar.
Second, the Court acknowledged that Side Letter 22 was removed from the collective
bargaining agreement no later than 1997. The Court nevertheless deemed it possible that Side
Letter 22 might bear on FreightCar’s obligations to employees who retired after the 1997 CBA
entered into effect. But the Court appears not to have accounted for the zipper and integration
clauses of the 1997 CBA, which provide that only enumerated agreements—a list that does not
include Side Letter 22—remain part of the CBA. So Side Letter 22 was unambiguously not a
part of the CBA for any FreightCar employee who retired after the 1997 CBA went into effect.
As such, because it is undisputed that FreightCar changed future benefits “subject to collective
bargaining,” as required by the 1997 CBA, FreightCar is entitled to summary judgment—at a
minimum—as to any employee who retired after 1997.
ARGUMENT
This Court possesses inherent power to reconsider interlocutory orders “when it is
consonant with justice to do so.” United States v. Jerry, 487 F.2d 600, 605 (3d Cir. 1973);
Dayoub v. Penn-Del Directory Co., 90 F. Supp. 2d 636, 637 (E.D. Pa. 2000). Reconsideration is

2

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 3 of 11

warranted “to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.”
Dayoub, 90 F. Supp. 2d at 637 (quoting Confer v. Custom Eng’r Co. Employee Health Benefit
Plan, 760 F.Supp. 75, 77 (W.D. Pa. 1991), aff’d in part and dismissed in part on other grounds,
952 F.2d 41 (3d Cir. 1991)); see also Harsco Corp. v. Zlotnicki, 779 F.2d 906, 909 (3d Cir.
1985).
Here, reconsideration is warranted because the Court committed two manifest errors of
law. First, the Court extended the scope of Side Letter 22 beyond its text. Second, even if Side
Letter 22 remained in effect after the JAC Guide was created and finalized, it was expressly
excluded from the 1997 CBA in light of the zipper and merger clauses.1 Moreover,
reconsideration serves the interests of justice because many of the premises identified by the
Court to be undisputed or resolvable as a matter of law are, in fact, disputed questions of fact for
trial.
A.

FreightCar Is Entitled to Summary Judgment Based on the Text of Side
Letter 22.

The Court’s opinion on summary judgment turned on its understanding of Side Letter 22.
Although the Court assessed the evidence as to when the Side Letter was withdrawn, it did not
consider the temporal scope of the obligations created by the plain language of the Side Letter.
Instead, this Court resorted to extrinsic evidence to determine how long the obligations of Side
Letter 22 remained effect. But this Court should not have used extrinsic evidence to alter the
scope of an obligation provided by the Side Letter’s unambiguous language. Resort to extrinsic
evidence to interpret a contract is appropriate only when the provision is ambiguous or the
extrinsic evidence objectively establishes “that apparently clear contract language means
1

The JAC Guide was identified as the summary plan description, but it governed as the
plan because there was no other formal instrument. See Burstein v. Ret. Account Plan for
Employees of Allegheny Health Educ. & Research Found., 334 F.3d 365, 378 (3d Cir. 2003).
3

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 4 of 11

something different from what it seems to mean.” Bock v. Computer Assocs. Int’l, Inc., 257 F.3d
700, 707 (7th Cir. 2001) (quoting AM Int’l, Inc. v. Graphic Mgmt. Assoc., Inc., 44 F.3d 572, 575
(7th Cir. 1995)); see also Baldwin v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 636 F.3d 69, 76 (3d Cir.
2011). Accordingly, FreightCar is entitled to summary judgment based on the unambiguous text
of Side Letter 22, which imposed on FreightCar a one-time obligation to create a suitable
replacement for the Bethlehem PHMB.
Side Letter 22 is unambiguous in imposing on FreightCar a one-time obligation:
Johnstown America Corporation will create mirror bargaining unit
employee benefit plans identical in all material respects to the
Bethlehem plans they replace. Within 60 days after closing of the
Johnstown America Corporation/Bethlehem sale, Johnstown
America Corporation will forward to the Union for review and
comment draft copies of such plans, and Johnstown America
Corporation and the Union agree to use their best efforts to finalize
such plans, subject to IRS approval if appropriate, within 120 days
of closing.
ECF No. 119 ¶ 20 (emphases added). Side Letter 22 contemplated that the mirrored plan would
be “create[d]” within 60 days after the closing of the JAC/Bethlehem sale and “finalize[d]”—
with the input of the Union—within 120 days of closing. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ Complaint admits as
much. ECF No. 1 ¶ 44 (“After signing the Mirroring Agreement, JAC discharged the
obligation it imposed to ‘create’ welfare benefit programs, including retiree medical and life
insurance benefits to retiring employees, which ‘mirrored’ Bethlehem’s welfare programs in ‘all
material respects.’”) (first emphasis added).2

2

At most, plaintiffs would have had a claim under Side Letter 22 if that letter was
breached when FreightCar “create[d]” and “finalize[d]” the 1993 JAC Guide without mirroring
the plans in all material respects. Such a claim likely would not have succeeded; the JAC Guide
was explicitly approved by the Union as fulfilling Side Letter 22’s obligations. But in any event,
if plaintiffs tried to make that argument today, it would raise a serious timeliness issue.
FreightCar is therefore entitled to judgment on Plaintiffs’ LMRA claim.

There is no room for extrinsic evidence on the question of whether Side Letter 22
imposes a continuing obligation. By its terms, Side Letter 22 imposed a one-time obligation to
“create” and “finalize.” Under that obligation, FreightCar was required to create a new plan
mirroring the material elements of the Bethlehem PHMB within sixty days of closing.
Plaintiffs’ ERISA claim must be based on the language of the FreightCar plan (and not
the language of the Bethlehem PHMB, which was never adopted by FreightCar).3 See BohlerUddeholm Am., Inc. v. Ellwood Grp., Inc., 247 F.3d 79, 93 (3d Cir. 2001) (applying
Pennsylvania law) (“A party may use extrinsic evidence to support its claim of latent ambiguity,
but this evidence must show that some specific term or terms in the contract are ambiguous; it
cannot simply show that the parties intended something different that was not incorporated into
the contract.”). Because the FreightCar plan provided that benefits may be amended or
terminated, at any time, “subject to collective bargaining”—a standard that FreightCar satisfied,
based on undisputed evidence, by bargaining to impasse, FreightCar is entitled to judgment on
the ERISA claims, as well.
B.

FreightCar Is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Claims Arising after 1997.

In the alternative, even if there was a need for trial to determine whether individuals who
retired prior to 1997 were entitled to permanent benefits, there is an independent ground for
granting judgment to FreightCar as to individuals who retired after the 1997 CBA came into
effect.
In denying FreightCar’s motion for summary judgment, this Court found “a dispute of
fact as to whether the parties agreed that FreightCar’s obligation under Side Letter 22 had been
3

If plaintiffs wanted the Bethlehem PHMB language or another provision providing
more robust retiree protection, they had the obligation to bargain for it and have it placed
explicitly in the plan. See Felker v. USW Local 10-901, No. 13-7101, 2015 WL 1867910, at *4
(E.D. Pa. Apr. 23, 2015)
5

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 6 of 11

satisfied, or whether the parties intended the obligation under Side Letter 22 to govern past
1997.” (ECF No. 161, at 47-48) The Court maintained that FreightCar had no right to terminate
retiree welfare benefits unilaterally under Side Letter 22. The Court further found “that the
factual evidence is ambiguous regarding FreightCar’s continuing obligations under Side Letter
22.” Id. at 48.
That analysis fails to account for two critical provisions of the 1997 CBA—its integration
and zipper clauses, which provide:
This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein are the only
documents by which the parties intend to be contractually or statutorily
bound. Any document, not expressly referred to herein that may be brought forth
by either the Company or the Union after ratification of this Agreement may be
included as part of this Agreement, provided both parties agree to its inclusion.
All Appendices from previous agreements have either been consolidated into
Articles of this Agreement or in any event, are no longer part of this
Agreement.
Documents expressly referred to include:
Job Descriptions
Local Issues
Weekly Unit Scheduling Practices and Overtime Policies
Weekly and Quarterly Pool Agreement
Flat Rate Agreement
Summary Plan Descriptions
1991 Side Letters 4, 5, 13, 26
1997 Side Letters 1, 2, 3
The Company and Union waive the right to bargain with each other for the
duration of this Agreement for a modification of any provision of this Agreement,
or for the acquisition of any additional economic benefits, or for the limitation
of any management right, prerogative or privilege.
1997 CBA, Article XXI (ECF No. 121-20, at 39) (emphases added).
The Supreme Court held in Tackett v. M&G Polymers, USA, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 935 (2015),
that “[w]here the words of the contract are clear and unambiguous, its meaning is to be
ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.” Id. at 933 (quoting 11 R. Lord,
6

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 7 of 11

Williston on Contracts § 30:6, at 108 (4th ed. 2012). Additionally, the Circuit Courts have
recognized that “the added presence of a merger clause is further strong evidence ‘that the parties
intended the writing to be the complete and exclusive agreement between them.’” AnheuserBusch, Inc. v. Local Union No. 744, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 280 F.3d 1133,
1141 (7th Cir. 2002) (quoting Regensburger v. China Adoption Consultants, Ltd., 138 F.3d 1201,
1206 (7th Cir. 1998)). Here, the 1997 CBA states explicitly that the agreement and the
enumerated documents are the only documents by which the parties agree to be contractually
bound. Moreover, the zipper clause waived any further bargaining on “the acquisition of
additional economic benefits” for the duration of the CBA. Where a contract plainly indicates
that it is the only agreement and that all prior agreements have been merged into the current
contract or are no longer binding, the contract is completely integrated. Martin v. Monumental
Life Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 223, 234 (3d Cir. 2001).
In finding that there is a question of fact about whether Side Letter 22’s obligations
continued beyond 1997, the Court failed to give effect to the merger clause. This Court wrote,
“FreightCar’s argument that it was not required to bargain to impasse with the Union over retiree
benefits is premised on the notion that they had agreed with Plaintiffs no longer to be bound by
Side Letter 22 and the Continuation of Coverage language in the Bethlehem PHMB, and were
thus free to terminate the benefits only subject to collective bargaining or subject to any contrary
provision in the collective bargaining agreement.” (ECF No. 161, at 50) But FreightCar had
already demonstrated that it was not bound by Side Letter 22 after producing a completely
integrated contract in 1997 that contained no reference to Side Letter 22.4 At that point, it
became the Union’s responsibility to provide overwhelming evidence sufficient to negate the

4

And this assumes arguendo that Side Letter 22 even remained operative through 1997.
7

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 8 of 11

“strong evidence” of integration provided by the merger clause. See Local Union No. 744, 280
F.3d at 1141. The extrinsic evidence cited in the summary judgment opinion is not close to
satisfying that burden.
In fact, the overwhelming evidence pointed against incorporating Side Letter 22. Of the
twenty-seven side letters to the 1991 agreement, the 1997 CBA incorporates four: letters 4, 5,
13, and 26. Notably missing is Side Letter 22; the maxim expressio unis est exclusio alterius
applies here. See Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 179 (1st Cir.
1995) (“While this interpretive maxim is not always dispositive, it carries weight; and when, as
now, there is absolutely nothing in the agreement’s text that hints at some additional item lurking
beyond the enumerated list, we see no reason why the maxim should not be controlling.”).
Moreover, both the Union and FreightCar are sophisticated parties who jointly drafted the
contract language and, thus, could be expected to accurately incorporate all of the actual
agreements. See Felker v. USW Local 10-901, No. 13-7101, 2015 WL 1867910, at *4 (E.D. Pa.
Apr. 23, 2015) (“Plaintiffs’ Union was involved in the negotiations that established the Plan, and
could have bargained for a more detailed delegation procedure to be included in the Plan.”). In
such a carefully negotiated contract, the merger clause should not be casually disregarded.
When the 1997 CBA is interpreted as an integrated contract subject to a merger clause—
as it must be—FreightCar’s obligation as to retiree benefits are governed by Appendix 9 (ECF
No. 121-20, at 48), which provides that insurance benefits shall be governed by the JAC Guide.
See Tackett, 135 S. Ct. at 933 (“Where the words of the contract are clear and unambiguous, its
meaning is to be ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.”) (quoting 11 R.
Lord, Williston on Contracts § 30:6, at 108). In turn, the JAC Guide provides, “[s]ubject to
collective bargaining the company reserves the right to end, suspend, or amend the plans at any

8

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 178 Filed 04/28/15 Page 9 of 11

time, in whole or in part.” Here, the 1997 CBA extended benefits “[s]ubject to collective
bargaining.” Even assuming FreightCar had an obligation to bargain over current retirees
benefits (which, as this Court noted, the Union itself denied), that requirement was fulfilled for
both past and future retirees in 2001, when the parties bargained to impasse over retiree welfare
benefits, which allowed FreightCar to terminate the benefits unilaterally.5
There is no question that, at a minimum, workers who retired under the 1997 CBA or
thereafter are ineligible for any benefits that might arise under Side Letter 22. This Court should
grant reconsideration to give legal effect to the merger and zipper clauses, pursuant to which
Side Letter 22 could not have imposed any obligations after the 1997 CBA went into effect. At a
minimum, from that time forward, FreightCar’s obligations were governed by the terms of the
JAC Guide, which FreightCar fulfilled during collective bargaining in both 2001 and 2005.
Accordingly, summary judgment is owed as to these class members.

5

The same holds true for persons who retired under the 2005 CBA and the 2008 plant closing
agreement. Both of those agreements identified the JAC Guide as governing retiree welfare
benefits. See FreightCar Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶¶ 122, 130 (ECF No. 119).
