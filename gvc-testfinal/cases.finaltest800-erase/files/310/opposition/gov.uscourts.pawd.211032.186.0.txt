PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
I.

INTRODUCTION

In its summary judgment ruling, the Court concluded that (1) the parties agreed to a
continuing obligation to provide retiree benefits “except as the Company and the Union may
agree otherwise,” and (2) there was a genuine issue of disputed fact as to whether the parties
agreed that FreightCar had satisfied that obligation. FreightCar now asks the Court to reconsider
these points, terming them “manifest errors of law,” and urges the Court to enter summary
judgment in its favor and dismiss this action with prejudice. See Dkt. #177-1 (FreightCar
Proposed Order). As to the first supposed error, FreightCar admitted in its preliminary
injunction opposition and elsewhere that Side Letter 22 contained a continuing obligation, and

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 186 Filed 05/19/15 Page 2 of 9

the Court has already ruled that FreightCar is bound by its admission. As to both supposed
errors, FreightCar merely seeks to rehash arguments that the Court already has rejected. The
Court should deny reconsideration.
II.

CONTROLLING STANDARDS

The Court has corrected movants who “mistake reconsideration for reargument” and set
forth the standards for reviewing motions to reconsider in its February 5, 2014 Order denying
FreightCar’s first motion to reconsider (Dkt. #81) (“First Reconsideration Order”):
District courts have the inherent power to reconsider an interlocutory decision, but
“[c]ourts tend to grant motions for reconsideration sparingly and only upon the
grounds traditionally available under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).” A&H Sportswear Co.,
Inc. v. Victoria’s Secret Stores, Inc., CIV. A. 94-7408, 2001 WL 881718, at *1
(E.D. Pa. May 1, 2001). To be entitled to relief under Rule 59(e), the party
seeking reconsideration must establish “(1) an intervening change in controlling
law; (2) the availability of new evidence not previously available; [or] (3) the
need to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.” Id.; accord
Max’s Seafood Cafe ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d
Cir. 1999).
Because courts have a strong interest in the finality of their judgments, a motion
for reconsideration is inappropriate to express mere dissatisfaction with a court’s
previous ruling. D’Angio v. Borough of Nescopeck, 56 F.Supp.2d 502, 504
(M.D. Pa. 1999). Furthermore, “a motion for reconsideration is not to be used as
a means to reargue matters already argued and disposed of or as an attempt to
relitigate a point of disagreement between the Court and the litigant.” Ogden v.
Keystone Residence, 226 F.Supp.2d 588, 606 (M.D.Pa. 2002). In other words, it
is improper on a motion for reconsideration to restyle or rehash issues previously,
presented. Pahler v. City of Wilkes-Barre, 207 F.Supp.2d 341, 355 (M.D.Pa.
2001), aff’d, 31 F. App’x 69 (3d Cir. 2002).
In filing the instant motion for reconsideration, Defendants do not argue that there
has been any intervening change in the law, nor do they introduce new evidence
previously unavailable. Instead, Defendants ask the Court to reconsider its
previous decision on the ground that it might lead to an unjust result; by doing so,
Defendants mistake reconsideration for reargument.
The Court finds that no injustice resulted from the Court’s previous order (ECF
No. 73), and therefore concludes that Defendants have provided no grounds to
support reconsideration of the Court’s previous judgment.

ARGUMENT

Contrary To FreightCar’s First Claimed Error, And As FreightCar Has Admitted
In This Litigation, “Side Letter 22 Provided The Continuing Obligation That
FreightCar’s ‘Bargaining Unit Welfare Benefit Plans Will Mirror Existing
Bethlehem Plans’”
With respect to the Court’s first supposed error, FreightCar asserts that “contrary to the

Court’s ruling, the express language of Side Letter 22 does not support the Court’s finding that
FreightCar assumed an ongoing obligation to provide ‘mirrored benefits.’” Motion for
Reconsideration (Dkt. #177) at 1. Nowhere in FreightCar’s reconsideration brief or motion does
FreightCar acknowledge that it not only repeatedly admitted to precisely this fact, but that the
Court already has ruled that FreightCar will be bound by its admission on this point. FreightCar
also fails to acknowledge that it argued this point in its summary judgment briefing, and that the
Court resolved the issue against FreightCar in its March 31, 2015 summary judgment ruling
(“Summary Judgment Ruling”) (Dkt. #161).
In language antithetical to the position FreightCar now asks the Court to adopt,
FreightCar admitted as follows in its September 18, 2013 preliminary injunction brief
(“FreightCar PI Opp.”): “Regarding FreightCar’s obligation to provide medical benefits to the
Retirees, Side Letter 22 provided the continuing obligation that FreightCar’s ‘bargaining
unit welfare benefit plans will mirror existing Bethlehem plans….’” Dkt. # 58-1 at 6 (italics
emphasis in the original; bold emphasis added). FreightCar reiterated this admission later in its
brief, citing “the undisputed fact that before its abrogation in 1997, FreightCar had continuing
obligations under Side Letter 22.” FreightCar PI Opp. at 25. FreightCar continued:
The plain language of Side Letter 22 included this continuing obligation:
“Johnstown America Corporation bargaining unit welfare plans will mirror
existing Bethlehem plans and shall be effective immediately after
3

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 186 Filed 05/19/15 Page 4 of 9

closing….Johnstown America Corporation shall be responsible for all benefits
payable to its employees or retirees which arise or are based on events which
occurred after closing.”
Id. (italics emphasis in the original; bold emphasis added).
In its Summary Judgment Ruling, the Court quoted the latter passages from FreightCar’s
injunction brief. See Summary Judgment Ruling at 41. The Court concluded that FreightCar
would be “judicially bound by its earlier admissions in pleadings and briefs before this Court.”
Summary Judgment Ruling at 25; see also Summary Judgment Ruling at 46 (“FreightCar
asserted earlier in this litigation that it had continuing obligations under Side Letter 22 that
remained until 1997”).
Despite the Court’s ruling, FreightCar claims that the Court’s Summary Judgment Ruling
“does not appear to have determined whether Side Letter 22 – by its written terms – created a
continuing obligation.” FreightCar Br. at 1. To the contrary, as shown, the Court quoted
FreightCar’s admission in this case of “‘the undisputed fact that…FreightCar had continuing
obligations under Side Letter 22,’” and held that FreightCar would be bound by its admissions in
this case. Summary Judgment Ruling at 41 (quoting FreightCar’s preliminary injunction brief)
and 25.
Moreover, FreightCar argued in its original summary judgment brief that “[b]y drafting
and adopting the plan documents in the JAC Guide, FreightCar fulfilled its obligation under Side
Letter 22 to create new employee benefit plans to replace the plans previously maintained by
Bethlehem.” See Dkt. #120-1 at 9. The Court rejected this argument in its Summary Judgment
Ruling, holding:
FreightCar was clearly under a contractual obligation to create mirror benefit
plans pursuant to Side Letter 22, which was part of the 1991 sale agreement. The
conflicting evidence presented by the parties regarding the 1994 and 1997
negotiations creates a dispute of fact as to whether the parties agreed that
4

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 186 Filed 05/19/15 Page 5 of 9

FreightCar’s obligation under Side Letter 22 had been satisfied, or whether the
parties intended the obligation under Side Letter 22 to continue to govern past
1997. The Court makes particular note of the fact that FreightCar continued to
pay welfare benefits until 2002, when Bethlehem ceased to reimburse FreightCar
for retiree welfare benefits. The Union did not agree to termination of welfare
benefits, which would have been required pursuant to the Bethlehem PHMB
Continuation of Coverage language. FreightCar’s assertion that it was entitled to
unilaterally terminate retiree welfare benefits is therefore premised on the fact that
the parties had agreed to give FreightCar a right to unilateral termination, and that
FreightCar had no remaining obligations under Side Letter 22.
The Court finds that the factual evidence is ambiguous regarding FreightCar’s
continuing obligations under Side Letter 22. As the Court found above, these
questions of fact should be determined by the finder of fact at trial.

Summary Judgment Ruling at 47-48.
Under this ruling, the Court as fact-finder thus will address at trial the Side Letter
22 requirement that benefits continue “except as the Company and the Union may agree
otherwise,” and will determine whether the parties agreed in 1994 or 1997 bargaining to
relieve FreightCar of its obligation to reach agreement with the Union prior to altering
benefits. This likely will entail, among other things, a determination by the Court as to
whether the parties’ agreement to remove Side Letter 22 from the CBA was essentially a
“housekeeping” matter or whether both the Union and the Company intended that
removal to give FreightCar carte blanche with respect to retiree benefits.
Again, “a motion for reconsideration is not to be used as a means to reargue matters
already argued and disposed of or as an attempt to relitigate a point of disagreement between the
Court and the litigant.” First Reconsideration Order at 2 (citations omitted). FreightCar’s
attempt to relitigate the question of whether it had continuing obligations under Side Letter 22
falls in the face of (1) its admission that it did; (2) the Court’s conclusion that this admission
would be binding; (3) FreightCar’s arguments on this point in summary judgment briefing; and

5

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 186 Filed 05/19/15 Page 6 of 9

(4) the Court’s discussion of this issue and resolution against FreightCar in its Summary
Judgment Ruling.
B.

Contrary To FreightCar’s Second Claimed Error, The Court Has Already Properly
Found A Dispute Of Fact As To FreightCar’s Ongoing Obligation To Provide
Benefits Except As the Parties Agree Otherwise
FreightCar next complains about the Court’s finding of “a dispute of fact as to whether

the parties agreed that FreightCar’s obligation under Side Letter 22 had been satisfied, or
whether the parties intended the obligation under Side Letter 22 to govern past 1997.”
FreightCar Br. at 5-6. FreightCar asserts that the Court committed this second supposed error by
declining to adopt FreightCar’s position that any continuing obligations imposed by Side Letter
22 “ceased no later than 1997.” FreightCar Motion at 1. In particular, FreightCar protests that
the Court “failed to give effect to the merger and zipper clauses in the 1997 CBA.”1 Id.

1

FreightCar argues that these two provisions in and of themselves establish that the 1997 CBA
unambiguously eliminated any continuing obligations under Side Letter 22. FreightCar ignores
all else, including a 1997 CBA “Successorship” provision quoted in the Court’s Summary
Judgment Ruling, which is contractual evidence to the contrary:
(1) In the event of a permanent shutdown of the Plant prior to five years following
the date of sale, the Company will guarantee that each former Johnstown America
Corporation Employee at the Plant will receive from the owner of the Plant, from
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”) and/or from the
Johnstown America Corporation Pension Plan . . . the same retiree health and life
insurance coverage, and the same severance pay that he would have received had
the Plant shutdown as of the date of sale.

Dkt. #161 at 9-10 (quoting Successor provision). The provision would be utterly meaningless if,
as FreightCar argues, those benefits could be terminated unilaterally. It is a “cardinal principle
of contract construction that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions and to
render them consistent with each other.” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 514 U.S. 52,
63 (1995). The Successor provision accordingly must be considered in analyzing the 1997 CBA,
and it precludes FreightCar’s conclusion that the 1997 CBA unambiguously establishes that the
Union and Company intended to give FreightCar unilateral authority to eliminate retiree
healthcare benefits.

6

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 186 Filed 05/19/15 Page 7 of 9

As with its arguments on the Court’s first supposed error, FreightCar presented this point
in its summary judgment briefing. See FreightCar SJ Brief at 10, 21; FreightCar SJ Reply Brief
(Dkt. #146-1) at 5. In its Summary Judgment Ruling, the Court quoted the so-called “zipper
clause,” which was in Article XXI of the 1997 CBA. Dkt. #161 at 9-10. The Court also
summarized FreightCar’s argument with respect to this provision: “Rather than ‘removing’ any
prior agreements, FreightCar states that Article XXI of the 1997 CBA clarified which documents
comprised the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.” Summary Judgment Ruling at 39-40.
While the Court considered FreightCar’s argument, it was not convinced. The Court
began with the controlling law under the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in M & G Polymers
USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135 S.Ct. 926, 937 (2015):
The Supreme Court noted that “we have already recognized that ‘a collectivebargaining agreement [may] provid[e] in explicit terms that certain benefits
continue after the agreement’s expiration.’” Id., quoting Litton, 501 U.S. at 207.
The concurrence in Tackett noted that “[t]o determine what the contracting parties
intended, a court must examine the entire agreement in light of relevant industry
specific ‘customs, practices, usages, and terminology.’” Id. at 937–38, citing 11
R. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 30:4, at 55–58 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston). The
concurrence further noted that “[w]hen the intent of the parties is unambiguously
expressed in the contract, that expression controls, and the court’s inquiry should
proceed no further.” Id., citing Williston § 30:6, at 98–104. However, “when the
contract is ambiguous, a court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the
intentions of the parties.” Id., citing Williston § 30:7, at 116–124.
Summary Judgment Ruling at 45-46; see also Southeastern PA Transp. Authority v. Brotherhood
of R.R. Signalmen, 882 F.2d 778, 784 (3d Cir. 1989) (“where a court is called on to interpret a
collective bargaining agreement it is generally appropriate for the court to look beyond the face
of the collective bargaining agreement”); Transp.-Commc’n Emps. Union v. Union Pac. R.R.
Co., 385 U.S. 157, 161 (1966) (“In order to interpret such an agreement it is necessary to
consider the scope of other related collective bargaining agreements, as well as the practice,
usage and custom pertaining to all such agreements”).
7

Case 3:13-cv-00146-KRG Document 186 Filed 05/19/15 Page 8 of 9

The Court proceeded to apply Tackett to the facts here:
As the Court noted above, this case must be decided as a matter of contract law.
The parties’ 1994 and 1997 agreements are ambiguous on the question of whether
the parties agreed that FreightCar had satisfied its mirroring obligation. Thus, as
the concurrence noted in Tackett, the Court may look at extrinsic evidence to
determine the intentions of the parties. The extrinsic evidence regarding the 1994
and 1997 negotiations is also inconclusive and presents a genuine dispute of
material fact as to whether the parties agreed that the obligations under Side
Letter 22 had been fulfilled and whether FreightCar had provided the Union with
consideration in return for giving up this benefit. As FreightCar stated earlier in
this litigation, it had continuing obligations through 1997. (ECF No. 63 at 25).
Furthermore, FreightCar continued to provide welfare benefits through 2002,
when Bethlehem ceased reimbursing FreightCar for paying retiree welfare
benefits.
***
The Court found above that FreightCar was under an obligation to create mirror
benefit plans that included the Bethlehem PHMB Continuation of Coverage
language. The Court further finds that there is a dispute of fact as to the parties’
intention with regard to the continuing force of Side Letter 22.
Summary Judgment Ruling at 46-47.
As with the Court’s first purported error, the purported second error has been thoroughly
argued and thoroughly addressed. The fact that FreightCar does not like the Court’s ruling
provides no basis for reconsideration.
IV.

CONCLUSION

For these reasons, the Court should deny FreightCar’s Motion for Reconsideration.
