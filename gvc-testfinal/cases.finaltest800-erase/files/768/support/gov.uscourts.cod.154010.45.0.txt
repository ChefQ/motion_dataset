Arla Mendenhall files this motion to be joined in this case as a Plaintiff. In support of the
following:

I received a 1099 tax form from Troy Barnes which stated Earnings for a sum of $6,000.00 of
which I only received $800.00 deposited in my bank account. The rest,$5200.00 was reinvested
into The Achieve Community. I paid income tax on said $6,000.00 for the tax year of 2014 in
order to comply with Federal Laws. So I wish to be reimbursed $5200.00

Another amount of $2700 was due to be paid to me in 2015 but the funds were frozen and there
was declared misconduct on the part of Troy Barnes and Kristi Johnson.

I would like to be reimbursed for losses also totaling $2700.00 in this business in 2015.

The Total Amount Comes out to $7,900.00 in losses which I am asking to recover.

I have sent in my documents showing proof,concerning these transactions to the court previously.
