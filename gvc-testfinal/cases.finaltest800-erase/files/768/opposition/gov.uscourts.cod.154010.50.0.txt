UNITED STATES SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
KRISTINE L. JOHNSON,
TROY A. BARNES, and

ACHIEVE INTERNATIONAL, LLC,
Relief Defendant.
______________________________________________________________________
PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO ARLA MENDENHALL’S
MOTION TO BE JOINED AS A PLAINTIFF
______________________________________________________________________
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
respectfully submits its opposition to Arla Mendenhall’s motion to be joined as a plaintiff
in this case. While the SEC is sympathetic to Ms. Mendenhall’s position as an investor
who was defrauded by the Defendants in this case, the SEC is not in a position to
consent to her intervention, as that intervention could have the effect of placing Ms.
Mendenhall’s interests before the interest of other similarly-defrauded investors. By
statute, such consent is required for Ms. Mendenhall to intervene. Moreover, Ms.
Mendenhall has not met her burden to show that intervention is appropriate under

Case 1:15-cv-00299-REB-CBS Document 50 Filed 07/02/15 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 9

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. For these reasons, and while the SEC will continue
to prosecute this case in the interest of returning funds to investors in an equitable and
efficient manner, the SEC respectfully opposes Ms. Mendenhall’s motion.
I.

BACKGROUND
On February 12, 2015, the SEC filed its emergency motion for a Temporary

Restraining Order and subsequently a Preliminary Injunction that would freeze the
assets of Defendants and Relief Defendant, enjoin Defendants from violating the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and order other relief. (See Doc. No.
4.) That same day, the Court entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze.
(See Doc. No. 10.) Both Johnson and Barnes have stipulated to a preliminary injunction
and asset freeze (see Doc. Nos. 14, 15); Defendant Work With Troy Barnes, Inc. and
Relief Defendant Achieve International, LLC have not yet responded to any of the
SEC’s papers or Court’s orders. Immediately following the Court’s granting of the TRO
order, the SEC affected the asset freeze and to date has frozen over $2.5 million for the
benefit and protection of investors. (See Second Felder Decl. ¶¶ 15-16 (Doc. No. 18-1).)
On June 3, 2015, the Court held a status conference on this matter at which Ms.
Mendenhall indicated her intention to file a motion to join this case as a plaintiff. (Doc.
No. 44.) On June 15, 2015, the SEC was served with Ms. Mendenhall’s motion. (Doc.
No. 45.) In sum, Ms. Mendenhall asks to be joined as a plaintiff in order to be recover
the money she lost to the Defendants’ fraud.

ARGUMENT
A.

Ms. Mendenhall is Not Permitted to Intervene Under Section 21(g) of
the Exchange Act.

Ms. Mendenhall is precluded from intervening in this matter by Section 21(g) of
the Exchange Act, which states:
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1407(a) of Title 28, or any other
provision of law, no action for equitable relief instituted by the Commission
pursuant to the securities laws shall be consolidated or coordinated with
other actions not brought by the Commission, even though such other
actions may involve common questions of fact, unless such consolidation
is consented to by the Commission.
15 U.S.C. § 78u(g). While not universal, numerous courts have held that this statute
creates an “impenetrable wall” to intervention absent the consent of the Commission.
SEC v. Wozniak, No. 92 C 4691, 1993 WL 34702, *1 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 8, 1993) (denying
motion to intervene by victim of fraudulent scheme); see also SEC v. Cogley, No.
98CV802, 2001 WL 1842476, *3 (S.D. Ohio March 21, 2001) (reaching the “inescapable
conclusion that Section 21(g) bars intervention”); SEC v. Homa, No. 99 C 6895, *1-2
(N.D. Ill. Sept. 29, 2000) (barring intervention under Section 21(g)); SEC v. Egan, 821 F.
Supp. 1274, 1275-76 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (same); cf. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439
U.S. 322 n.17 (1979) (“[C]onsolidation of a private action with one brought by the SEC
without its consent is prohibited by statute.”). As one leading securities law treatise has
put it, “[t]he trend is to deny [requests to intervene] unless the SEC consents to the
intervention.” Thomas Lee Hazen, Treatise on Law of Sec. Regulation, 6 Law. Sec.
Reg. § 16.2 (2015).

While other courts have held that Section 21(g)’s wall is not “impenetrable,” even
those decisions have by-in-large made clear that intervention is inappropriate under
facts such as these. Several cases have noted that Section 21(g) “does preclude
intervention when the would-be intervenors attempt to recover from the very defendants
the SEC is suing.” SEC v. Falor, 270 F.R.D. 372, 375 (N.D. Ill. 2010) (citing cases)
(quotation omitted). That is what Ms. Mendenhall seeks to do here. By contrast, courts
have permitted intervention despite Section 21(g) in order to allow a non-party to
challenge to issues in post-judgment proceedings, to protect its corporate voting rights,
or to contest a receiver’s actions. See, e.g., id. at 374-75 (citing cases); SEC v. Benger,
No. 09 C 0676, 2010 WL 724416, *8 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 23, 2010) (citing cases), SEC v.
Heartland Group, Inc., No. 01 C 1984, 2003 WL 1089366, *3 (N.D. Ill. March 23, 2003).
The reason for this distinction is clear. The impetus for Section 21(g) “was the
SEC’s and Congress’s concern that private litigants frequently file actions that track the
Commission’s enforcement cases and seek to ‘ride along on the Government’s cases,’”
which is “contrary to the ‘public interest in securing prompt relief from violations of the
securities laws” and in the effective enforcement of those laws.” Benger, 2010 WL
724416, at *6. As the relevant Senate committee explained in enacting Section 21(g),
“[p]rivate actions frequently will involve more parties and more issues than the
Commission's enforcement action, thus greatly increasing the need for extensive pretrial
discovery. In particular, issues related to ... scienter, causation, and the extent of
damages, are elements not required to be demonstrated in a Commission injunctive
action.” S.Rep. No.94–75, at 76 (1975), 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 179, 254, cited in Aaron v.

SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 717 n.9 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part); see also SEC v. Hollinger Intern., Inc., No. 04 C 0336, 2004 WL 422729, *2 (N.D.
Ill. March 2, 2004) (“The Senate also noted that the private plaintiffs’ objective in filing
suit was to receive damages and to adjudicate private disputes between citizens, which
is very different than the objective of an SEC enforcement action – to fulfill the
legislature’s mandated scheme of law enforcement in the securities area.”) (internal
quotations omitted). Actions where court have permitted intervention despite Section
21(g) “did not pose the same kind of immediate threat to the effective enforcement of
the securities laws as does consolidation or coordination with SEC actions where issues
of liability and disgorgement have yet to be resolved.” Benger, 2010 LW 724416, at *8. 1
Here, Ms. Mendenhall seeks to intervene, before liability issues have been
resolved, in order to sue the same defendants that the SEC is suing. Whether under the
reasoning of cases like Wozniak – that Section 21(g) creates an “impenetrable wall” – or
cases like Falor – that Section 21(g), while not absolute, does bar intervention where

The SEC could not locate any Tenth Circuit authority on this issue. There have been a handful
of district court cases from other states in the circuit holding that Section 21(g) does not
absolutely bar intervention, but those cases are distinguishable in that they do not involve
harmed investors attempting to sue the same defendants the SEC was suing. In any event,
those cases generally denied intervention under Fed. R. Civ. P 24. SEC v. Am. Pension
Services, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-00309, 2015 WL 248575, (D. Utah Jan. 20, 2015) (movants objected
to receiver’s liquidation plan; Court ultimately denied motion to intervene because movants had
not shown interests not adequately represented by receiver); SEC v. Novus Tech., LLC, No.
2:07 cv 0235, 2008 WL 115114 (D. Utah Jan. 10, 2008) (movant was large bank which
intervened in an attempt to place constructive trust over money invested in Ponzi scheme that, it
claimed, came from loans obtained from bank; Court ultimately denied intervention); SEC v.
Kings real Estate Investment Trust, 222 F.R.D. 660 (D. Kan. 2004) (granting motion to intervene
where individual claimed his investment was not made in the entity which was used to defraud
investors, but rather was made in another entity).

-5-

Case 1:15-cv-00299-REB-CBS Document 50 Filed 07/02/15 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 9

the would-be intervenor seeks damages from the same defendants the SEC has sued –
Ms. Mendenhall’s request to intervene requires the SEC’s consent.
While the SEC is sympathetic to Ms. Mendenhall’s position as a defrauded
investor – indeed, the reason the SEC sought an emergency restraining order and asset
freeze was to halt this fraud and protect investor assets – it cannot consent to Ms.
Mendenhall’s request to intervene. There are myriad investors who were defrauded by
Defendants. The SEC cannot consent to one investor’s intervention, which could put her
interests in front of other investors who suffered the same type of losses. Ultimately, the
SEC is seeking to return assets to investors in an equitable and efficient manner, and
permitting Ms. Mendenhall (or any other individual investor or group of investors) to
intervene could frustrate that purpose. For these reasons, the SEC respectfully declines
to consent to Ms. Mendenhall’s request to intervene.
B.

Ms. Mendenhall Has Not Met the Standard to Intervene Under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Even if the Court determines that Ms. Mendenhall’s motion for intervention is not
barred by Section 21(g), Ms. Mendenhall has not met the standard to intervene under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. As the applicant, Ms. Mendenhall bears the burden
of establishing the elements required under Rule 24. See, e.g., Benger, 2010 WL
724416. Ms. Mendenhall’s motion does not explain how she meets the elements for
intervention, nor does she state whether she seeks intervention of right under Rule
24(a) or permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Under either prong, however,
intervention by an individual investor in an action where the SEC is suing to protect all
investors is inappropriate. See, e.g., Am. Pension Services, Inc., 2015 WL 248575, at *

5-6 (denying motion to intervene under Rule 24(a) because movants’ interests were
adequately represented by receiver in SEC action; “while Movants interest in the
proverbial ‘pie’ may differ from the interests of others wanting a slice, such adversity
does not amount to proof of the Receiver’s inadequate representation”); SEC v.
Qualified Pensions, Inc., No. Civ.A. 95-1746, 1998 WL 29496, *4 (D.D.C. Jan. 16, 1998)
(denying motion to intervene under Rule 24(a) because movants’ interests were
adequately protected by SEC; “After all, the SEC exposed the fraud at the core of …
this suit. It is statutorily commissioned to represent the interests of individual investors in
the public at large ….”); SEC v. Credit Bankcorp, Ltd., 194 F.R.D. 457, 468 (S.D.N.Y.
2000) (intervention under Rule 24(a) inappropriate; “[W]hile the SEC may not have an
interest in advancing the claims of one defrauded investor at the expense of the other,
several courts have held that the SEC or other governmental agencies in analogous
enforcement actions sufficiently represent investor interests.”) 2; id. (noting that
intervention under Rule 24(b) “has been traditionally disfavored, given courts' hesitation
to allow scores of investors and other interested persons from becoming full-fledged
parties to governmental enforcement actions,” although permitting it under particular
circumstances of the case); Novus Tech., LLC, 2008 WL 115114 at *4 (denying motion
to intervene under Rule 24(b) because it would likely invite intervention from all
investors, which would complicate case).

But see Utah Assoc. of Cntys. v. Clinton, 255 F.3d 1246, 1255–56 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding
governmental representation insufficient because “[i]n litigating on behalf of the general public,
the government is obligated to consider a broad spectrum of views, many of which may conflict
with the particular interest of the would-be intervenor.”)
