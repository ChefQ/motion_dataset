PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DISMISS DEFENDANT
DOE 1’S COUNTERCLAIM [DKT. 25]

Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), moves for the entry of
an order dismissing the Counterclaim filed by Defendant and states:
I. INTRODUCTION
Defendant’s Counterclaim improperly repleads his denials and affirmative defenses. In
doing so, Defendant asks the Court to revisit identical issues already raised. Each count is
redundant, meritless, and false.1 Defendant’s claim for misuse of copyright should be denied
because misuse of copyright is an affirmative defense. Further, Plaintiff’s actions fall squarely
within the Copyright Act and are supported by public policy. Defendant’s claims for declaratory
judgments regarding fair use, implied license, and declaration of non-infringement should
likewise be denied because they are identical to Defendant’s affirmative defenses. Neither the
Court nor the parties should be forced to address the same issues twice.

Defendant’s

A simple google search of Plaintiff’s website X-Art.com and “X-Art.com torrent” demonstrate that Plaintiff has a
legitimate successful business and that Plaintiff actively sends out DMCA notices on a daily basis in an effort to
remove torrents and infringing content on the Internet in order to protect its copyright.

counterclaim is a waste of the Court’s limited resources and, as set forth below, should be
dismissed.
II. MEMORANDUM OF LAW
A. Defendant Fails to State a Claim for Misuse of Copyright
Defendant’s claim for misuse of copyright should be dismissed. Misuse of copyright is
an affirmative defense and not a claim or counterclaim. “Misuse of copyright is an affirmative
defense to a claim of copyright infringement.” Costar Group Inc. v. Loopnet, Inc., 164 F. Supp.
2d 688, 708 (D. Md. 2001). See also Ticketmaster L.L.C. v. RMG Technologies, Inc., 536 F.
Supp. 2d 1191, 1198 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (“Ticketmaster argues that ‘copyright misuse’ is an
affirmative defense to a claim for copyright infringement, and does not support an independent
claim for damages. The Court agrees”). “Copyright misuse is not a claim but a defense, and
Defendants may not transmute it into an independent claim merely by labeling it one for
‘declaratory judgment.’” Interscope Records v. Kimmel, 2007 Copr. L. Dec. P 29423 (N.D.N.Y.
2007). Defendant raises misuse of copyright both as an affirmative defense and as Count I to his
counterclaim. This improper pleading is redundant and judicially inefficient.
“Misuse of copyright applies where the copyright owner tries to extend the copyright
beyond its intended reach, thereby augmenting the physical scope of copyright protection. It
typically arises in situations where it is alleged that the copyright owner projected his unique
rights in a work onto other, unrelated products or services.” Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Lerma, 65
USLW 2334 (E.D. Va. 1996). “[T]his defense is an assertion that the copyright holder is using
his copyright, ‘to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the [Copyright]
Office and which it is contrary to public policy to grant.’” Costar Group Inc. v. Loopnet, Inc.,
164 F. Supp. 2d 688, 708 (D. Md. 2001). “[M]isuse is a claim of anticompetitive behavior …

Despite the fact that conduct need not rise to the level of an antitrust violation to constitute
misuse, the Fourth Circuit has been hesitant to find misuse.” Id.
Plaintiff did not use its copyrights beyond the scope of the Copyright Act. “The Act
explicitly grants owners of ‘works of authorship’ exclusive rights to, inter alia, ‘reproduce the
copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords’ and ‘distribute copies or phonorecords of the
copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending.’” Sony BMG Music Entm't v. Tenenbaum, 660 F.3d 487, 498 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing 17
U.S.C. §106). “Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as
provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a) … is an
infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.” 17 U.S.C. §501. “The legal
or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled … to institute an action for
any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it.” Id. Here,
Plaintiff instituted an action for a violation of its exclusive rights under the Copyright Act. Its
actions fall squarely within the rights provided by the act.
Plaintiff’s actions fall squarely within the public policy of the Copyright Act. Indeed,
during her time as the Register of Copyrights, Mary Beth Peters testified to the Senate Judiciary
that “[c]opyright owners have every right to enforce their rights in court, whether they are taking
action against providers of peer-to-peer services designed to profit from copyright infringement
or against the persons engaging in individual acts of infringement using such services.” 2
[W]hether or not these infringers know or care that it is against the law, the
knowledge that such conduct may lead to expensive and burdensome litigation

and a potentially large judgment should have a healthy deterrent effect. While we
would like to think that everyone obeys the law simply because it is the law and
out of a sense of obligation, we also know that laws without penalties may be
widely ignored. For many people, the best form of education about copyright in
the internet world is the threat of litigation. In short, if you break the law, you
should be prepared to accept the consequences.3
Congress enacted the Digital Theft Deterrence Act of 1999 to deter online infringement
by increasing the penalties therefore. See Sony v. Tennenbaum, 660 F.3d 487, 497 (1st Cir.
2011) (citing the Congressional record and holding that non-commercial individuals commit
infringement by distributing copyrighted works online).
sharing of copyrighted works is infringement.

The Supreme Court has held file

See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

Grokster, Ltd. 545 U.S. 913, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (2005). Two circuit courts opined that Rule 45
subpoenas may be used to identify online copyright infringers.

See In re Charter

Communications, Inc. Subpoena Enforcement Matter, 393 F.3d 771, 774 (8th Cir. 2005); Arista
Records, LLC. v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2010). The Register of Copyrights testified
before Congress that entertainment companies have the right to sue for peer to peer infringement
and they should not apologize for doing so.4 Courts unanimously hold that Plaintiff’s First
Amendment right under the Petition clause to bring a suit for infringement outweighs any First
Amendment right proffered by an alleged infringer. See e.g., Sony Music Entertainment, inc. v.
Does 1-40, 326 F.Supp.2d 556 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (and the cases citing thereto). Clearly, public
policy supports the notion that a Plaintiff should be able to file suit for infringement on the

internet. For these reasons, Defendant’s claim for misuse of copyright should be dismissed for
failure to state a claim.
B. Defendant’s Declaratory Judgments Are Double Pleading Affirmative Defenses
and Should Be Denied
Defendant’s declaratory judgment claims for fair use, implied license, and liability for
copyright infringement should be dismissed as an inappropriate “repackaging” of his affirmative
defenses. The Declaratory Judgment Act gives the Court “the authority to declare the rights and
legal relations of interested parties, but not a duty to do so.” Stickrath v. Globalstar, Inc., 2008
WL 2050990, at *3 (N.D. Cal. 2008), citing Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Pub., 512 F.3d 522,
533 (9th Cir. 2008), which in turn cites Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 288, 115 S.Ct.
2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995) (within a district court's sound discretion to dismiss an action for
declaratory judgment), and 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) (emphasis in original).
“In the declaratory judgment context, the normal principle that federal courts should
adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise
judicial administration.” Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Berck, CIV.A DKC 09-0578, 2010 WL
3294305 (D. Md. 2010). Accordingly, numerous courts have used that discretion to dismiss
counterclaims “where they are either the ‘mirror image’ of claims in the complaint or redundant
of affirmative defenses.” Stickrath v. Globalstar, Inc., 2008 WL 2050990, at *3 (N.D. Cal.
2008). Here, Defendant effectively “forces the parties and the court to handle the same issues
twice.” Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Berck, CIV.A DKC 09-0578, 2010 WL 3294305 (D. Md.
2010).
Defendant’s second counterclaim for declaratory judgment of fair use mirrors his second
affirmative defense for fair use. See Count II and Second Affirmative Defense. Defendant’s
5

Case 8:12-cv-01198-DKC Document 29 Filed 10/19/12 Page 6 of 7

third counterclaim of implied license mirrors his fourth affirmative defense for implied license.
See Count III and Fourth Affirmative Defense. Defendant’s fourth declaratory judgment is
simply a denial which also mirrors his second and third counterclaim. See Count IV. Defendant
has failed to present any new issue or question of fact that will not be resolved by the original
complaint. Additionally, it should be noted that although Count IV ostensibly involves copyright
infringement, Defendant fails to allege or even address the elements of copyright infringement.
See generally, Count IV; see also Splitfish AG v. Bannco Corp., 727 F. Supp. 2d 461, 465 (E.D.
Va. 2010) (“The elements of a copyright infringement claim are (i) ownership of a valid
copyright and (ii) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.”)
“This type of double pleading is not the purpose of a declaratory judgment.” Id.

See

also Rayman v. Peoples Sav. Corp., 735 F.Supp. 841, 852-53 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (court dismisses
counterclaim that “simply duplicates arguments made by way of affirmative defense”); Tenneco
Inc. v. Saxony Bar & Tube, Inc., 776 F.2d 1375, 1379 (7th Cir. 1985) (“The label ‘counterclaim’
has no magic. What is really an answer or defense to a suit does not become an independent
piece of litigation because of its label.”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(2) (“If a party mistakenly
designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice
requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated…[.]”). “Ordinarily the court
will refuse a declaration which can be made only after a judicial investigation of disputed facts,
especially where the disputed questions of fact will be the subject of judicial investigation in a
regular action.” Washington-Detroit Theater Co. v. Moore, 249 Mich. 673 (MI 1930); See also
Product Engineering and Mfg, Inc. v. F. Barnes, 424 F.2d 42 (10th Cir. 1970) (“Dismissal of
federal court action seeking declaratory judgment that patent was invalid and that licensee's
machine did not infringe patent, wherein licensee asserted no more than what would be defense
6

Case 8:12-cv-01198-DKC Document 29 Filed 10/19/12 Page 7 of 7

to Colorado court contract action brought by patentee on license agreement, was not an abuse of
discretion.”)

Defendant’s claims for declaratory judgment should be dismissed outright for

failing to raise any new issues and creating judicial redundancy.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully moves for the entry of an order

dismissing Defendant’s Counterclaim in its entirety.
