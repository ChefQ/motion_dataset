IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND

MALIBU MEDIA LLC
v.

Case No. 8:12-cv-01198-DKC

DOE #1

DEFENDANT/COUNTERCLAIMANT’S RESPONSE
TO PLAINTIFF/COUNTER-DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendant, Doe #1, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s (“Plaintiff”) Motion to Dismiss Defendant Doe #1’s Counterclaim
(“Motion”).
I. Misuse of Copyright is Properly Pleaded in the Counterclaim
Plaintiff argues that “misuse of copyright is an affirmative defense and not a claim or
counterclaim.” See Motion at 2. However, prior decisions have squarely rejected such an
argument. In one matter, a court explained “Apple contends that copyright misuse may only be
asserted as a defense, not as a counterclaim. This order is unconvinced, however, that misuse
may never be asserted as a counterclaim for declaratory relief.” Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp., 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14370, 6-7 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2009). Other courts agree with this method of
analysis. One court opined that “in a declaratory relief setting, the declaratory relief plaintiff is
thus permitted to ‘assert’ a claim for copyright misuse because the declaratory relief plaintiff is
in fact likely to be accused of copyright infringement.” Open Source Yoga Unity v. Choudhury,
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10440 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2005) (citing Practice Management Info. v.
American Medical Ass'n, 121 F.3d 516, 520 (9th Cir. 1997) (declaratory relief plaintiff permitted
to assert copyright misuse defense). Furthermore, undersigned counsel is not aware of any

precedent from the Fourth Circuit that precludes a copyright misuse counterclaim as a matter of
law. While Defendant/Counterclaimant (“Defendant”) will be obligated to prove his claims, just
as Plaintiff must prove their own, it is not appropriate to dismiss Defendant’s misuse of
copyright counterclaim at this time.
Plaintiff goes on to make numerous arguments on the merits that are outside the scope of
a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion. For example, Plaintiff argues that it “did not use its copyrights
beyond the scope of the Copyright Act,” and that “Plaintiff’s actions fall squarely within the
public policy of the Copyright Act.” See Motion at 3. Neither the Court nor the Defendant is in a
position to make a determination on such issues before the discovery or trial process has a
chance to run its course. The Plaintiff’s Motion provides a perfect demonstration of Defendant’s
concerns. Plaintiff argues that “A simple google search of Plaintiff’s website X-Art.com and ‘XArt.com torrent’ demonstrate that Plaintiff has a legitimate successful business and that Plaintiff
actively sends out DMCA notices on a daily basis . . .” See Motion at 3. While this may be
perfectly possible, this language is the first suggestion on the record that the plaintiff, Malibu
Media LLC, is in any way related to the website X-Art.com. The relationship between the
Plaintiff and the named website is not explained in the Complaint. Furthermore, Defendant had
no opportunity to conduct discovery to determine these or other potential relationships at play in
this case. This factual discrepancy is one of many that will need to be evaluated during discovery
before a judgment can be appropriately made on Defendant’s copyright misuse claim.
II. Dismissal of the Other Counterclaims is Not Appropriate
Defendant does not dispute that a court has discretion to dismiss an action for declaratory
judgment. A court must exercise caution, however, “as it should only decline to exercise

Case 8:12-cv-01198-DKC Document 30 Filed 10/31/12 Page 3 of 5

jurisdiction where there is a ‘good reason’ to do so.” Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM
Equip. Co., 386 F.3d 581, 594 (4th Cir. N.C. 2004).
“In particular, a court should normally entertain a declaratory action where the ‘relief
sought (i) 'will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue,' and
(ii) 'will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise
to the proceeding.’” Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Berck, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86025 (D. Md.
Aug. 20, 2010) (Chasanow, J.) (citing Continental Casualty Co. v. Fuscardo, 35 F.3d 963, 965
(4th Cir. W. Va. 1994)) (citations omitted). Prior decisions have explained that “useful purposes”
result when an opinion has “clarified and settled . . . legal obligations,” “eliminated uncertainty,”
and “clarified . . . rights of the parties.” Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. 386 F.3d at 594.
The present matter is one that cries for a declaratory ruling. The attached spreadsheet,
taken from data available from PACER, demonstrates that Malibu Media LLC has been involved
as a Plaintiff in no less than 350 copyright actions across the country.1 See Exhibit #1. Virtually
all of these cases were originally filed against a group of John Doe respondents. Id. The practical
reality of this practice is that Plaintiff can extract numerous settlements of $2,000 to $5,000 from
purported defendants, regardless of whether the John Does would actually be liable on the
merits. The costs of litigation preclude virtually all people from aggressively defending
themselves compared to the comparatively small and known financial loss of a settlement.
This Court has a relatively rare opportunity to determine the viability of the Plaintiff's
purported copyrights and declare whether the copyrights are legally enforceable. Regardless of
the final outcome, such a declaration would eliminate uncertainty for the thousands of people
who are likely to be named in future lawsuits by the Plaintiff. Furthermore, if the Plaintiff’s

Defendant’s Counterclaim notes that Plaintiff was involved in 57 prior copyright suits, but the updated spreadsheet
appears to be a more comprehensive record of these actions.

Case 8:12-cv-01198-DKC Document 30 Filed 10/31/12 Page 4 of 5

copyrights are deemed enforceable, such a declaration would be advantageous to its ongoing
litigation efforts. These are, without question, “useful purposes” for maintaining Defendant’s
declaratory judgment counterclaims. Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. 386 F.3d at 594.
Next, Plaintiff broadly argues that Defendant’s claims should be dismissed because they
are “a waste of the Court’s limited resources.” See Motion at 1. While such an argument is ironic
coming from a Plaintiff that has appeared in approximately 350 actions in one calendar year, a
simple review of the answer and counterclaims demonstrates that there is little overlap between
the defenses and counterclaims. Furthermore, “a pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim
that—at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 8(c)(2) (emphasis added). Had Defendant failed to raise each claim clearly, he risked
precluding his rights to assert them.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the present matter is a case “where a court could
find noninfringement without adjudicating the validity of the underlying intellectual property,
thus leaving the defendant in fear of future actions.” Pettrey v. Enter. Title Agency, Inc., 2006
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83957 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 17, 2006) (citing Dominion Elec. Mfg. Co. v. Edwin L.
Wiegand Co., 126 F.2d 172, 175 (6th Cir. Ohio 1942)). Without the declaration as to the rights in
the underlying copyrights, thousands and thousands of potential defendants would be faced with
the prospect of re-litigating a virtually identical issue, namely, the validity of the Plaintiff’s
copyrights. The judicial efficiency created by precluding the need for thousands of near-identical
trials dwarfs any efficiencies that may occur by eliminating the counterclaim in the present
matter at bar.
Given that it is “difficult in most instances to determine whether counterclaims are
identical early in litigation, ‘the safer course for the court to follow is to deny a request to

Case 8:12-cv-01198-DKC Document 30 Filed 10/31/12 Page 5 of 5

dismiss a counterclaim for declaratory relief unless there is no doubt that it will be rendered moot
by the adjudication of the main action.’” Pettrey, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83957 at *9 (citing
Wright, Miller & Kane, 6 Federal Practice & Procedure 2d § 1406). This safer course of action is
appropriate in this action.
III. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that the Plaintiff’s Motion be
denied.
