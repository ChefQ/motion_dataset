PLAINTIFFS

CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA

AT&T, INC., AT&T MOBILITY LLC,

DEFENDANTS

RESPONSE OF CELLULAR SOUTH PLAINTIFFS TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTIONS FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINT
Plaintiffs Corr Wireless Communications, L.L.C.; Cellular South, Inc.; and Cellular
South Licenses, LLC (collectively “Cellular South”) submit this response to the Motion of
Defendants AT&T, Inc. and AT&T Mobility LLC (collectively “AT&T”) for Extension of Time
to Respond to Antitrust Complaint [Doc. #14] and the Motion of Defendant Qualcomm
Incorporated for Extension of Time to Respond to Complaint [Doc. # 19].
The Motions for Extensions of Time involve only one week of time. However, this issue
is only part of a larger dispute: Should this case be litigated in the “customary” manner, or
should the Court in its discretion implement an expedited schedule to allow for a timely
determination of Cellular South’s claims for prompt injunctive relief to avoid severe and
irreparable harm resulting from the Defendants’ ongoing misconduct?
Cellular South therefore requests that the Motions of Additional Time be decided in
conjunction with Cellular South’s pending Motion for Expedited Scheduling and Case
Management Conference and Other Relief [Doc. #10] – and that the deadlines for the
Defendants’ responsive pleadings be set for a time consistent with an expedited scheduling order.

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 22 Filed: 04/18/12 2 of 7 PageID #: 275

1.

Cellular South filed this antitrust action on April 2, 2012, seeking “immediate,

permanent injunctive relief at the earliest opportunity” to prevent further irreparable harm to
Cellular South and to competition in the wireless carrier market resulting from the Defendants’
ongoing, concerted anticompetitive conduct intended to stymie, if not eliminate altogether, the
ability of Cellular South and other wireless carriers to offer the 4G-LTE wireless service and
devices needed to compete effectively against AT&T in the wireless carrier market. Compl. ¶
429. Cellular South seeks to bifurcate the case so as defer any determination as to monetary
damages until after a later, separate trial. Compl. ¶ 430; see also id. ¶¶ 26-34.
2.

Consistent with its need for immediate injunctive relief, and before counsel for

any Defendant entered an appearance, Cellular South filed on April 12, 2010 its pending Motion
for Expedited Scheduling and Case Management Conference and Other Relief [Doc. # 10]. In
that Motion, Cellular South requests that the Court set an early scheduling and case management
conference to establish a reasonably expedited discovery and trial schedule to allow a trial on
Cellular South’s claims for injunctive relief by no later than March 31, 2013.1 Pursuant to this
necessarily expedited schedule, Cellular South’s Motion proposes that the Defendants be given
until May 16, 2012 – 44 days after service of the Complaint – to serve their responsive pleadings
(i.e., motions to dismiss), to which Cellular South must respond within 21 days, to which the
Defendants must reply within seven days. See Doc. # 10-1 at ¶¶ 1-3.

1

The Defendants attempt to make much of the fact that Cellular South has not sought a
preliminary injunction. See Doc. # 21 at 2, 4. As Cellular South expressly noted in its Motion
for Expedited Scheduling, the bond required for such a preliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 65(c) is simply not practical or feasible. See Doc. # 10 at ¶ 10. Thus, the fact that Cellular
South has not sought to secure a preliminary injunction – which could not be bonded – has no
bearing on its request for permanent injunctive relief after an expedited trial on the merits.
2

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 22 Filed: 04/18/12 3 of 7 PageID #: 276

3.

Cellular South advised counsel for the Defendants during telephone calls that it

would seek an expedited scheduling order in this matter and would agree to an extension of time
to respond to the complaint until May 16. All of the Defendants insisted on an extension until
May 23.
4.

AT&T and Qualcomm have now filed separate Motions for Extension of Time to

respond to the Complaint [Doc. # 14; Doc. # 19] requesting 51 days (until May 23) in which to
serve their responsive pleadings rather than the 44 days (until May 16) proposed by Cellular
South.
5.

Contrary to the Defendants’ suggestion, Cellular South’s proposal to limit the

Defendants’ extensions to May 16 rather than May 23 is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. As
demonstrated in its Motion for Expedited Scheduling [Doc. # 10], Cellular South believes that
March 31, 2013 is at the “back end of the window” that would allow the Court to issue effective
injunctive relief to prevent significant, irreparable harm resulting to Cellular South and to
competition in the wireless carrier market from the Defendants’ ongoing unlawful conduct.
Therefore, Cellular South has proposed a case management order that reasonably tracks
backward from that assumed trial date to establish the necessarily ambitious motion and
discovery deadlines. See Doc. # 10-1.2 The Court therefore should hear argument and rule on
Cellular South’s pending Motion before ruling on the Defendants’ requests to further extend the
deadlines for their responsive pleadings.

2

The Defendants complain that Cellular South denied their “customary” requests for 30
additional days to respond to the Complaint rather than the 23 additional days proposed by
Cellular South. Doc. # 14 at ¶ 8. As discussed above and more fully in Cellular South’s Motion
for Expedited Scheduling, this is by no means a customary case.
3

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 22 Filed: 04/18/12 4 of 7 PageID #: 277

6.

It is not true, as is suggested by the Defendants, that Cellular South seeks an

expedited schedule to remedy “conduct that took place in 2008.” Doc. # 14 at ¶ 15. It is true
that the unlawful conduct began in 2008, when the Defendants’ engaged in concerted action to
create a new Band 17 spectrum for AT&T’s private use. But that was just the beginning. The
unlawful conduct is continuing to this day and continues to deprive Cellular South of a fair
ability to compete. Even now, the Defendants continue to work together to protect AT&T’s
dominance by denying Cellular South the essential devices and roaming capability that it must
have to compete against AT&T in the wireless carrier market. See id. ¶¶ 13-22.
7.

Moreover, far more important than when the conduct began is that this litigation

has been filed as a last resort in Cellular South’s ongoing effort to avoid, or at least lessen, the
impact of the Defendants’ anticompetitive actions. As a matter of simple economics, full-scale
antitrust litigation against companies with the tremendous financial resources of the Defendants
should be undertaken, and has been undertaken, only after no business options or technological
solutions can reasonably be utilized to respond effectively to the anticompetitive actions.
8.

It has now become clear, after many efforts to seek to develop alternative business

and technological solutions that would allow Cellular South to avoid this litigation, that relief
from this Court provides the only feasible way for Cellular South to deploy its Band 12 4G-LTE
network on any schedule that may reduce, if not eliminate, the irreparable harm that is being
suffered.
9.

Thus, there is no merit to the Defendants’ implication that Cellular South

somehow opportunistically timed the filing of this lawsuit. See Doc. # 14 at ¶ 15; Doc # 21 at 12. On the contrary, and as detailed in the Complaint, Cellular South has focused its efforts on
attempting to mitigate the harm resulting from the Defendants’ ongoing misconduct by building

4

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 22 Filed: 04/18/12 5 of 7 PageID #: 278

out – at great additional expense – a limited network in select areas, on an entirely different
frequency bandwidth, through which Cellular South should be able to provide adequate 4G-LTE
service in those limited areas for the short term. See Compl. ¶¶ 23-25; Doc. # 10 at ¶ 6. Because
this alternative bandwidth network cannot reasonably provide a long-term solution allowing for
adequate 4G-LTE service throughout Cellular South’s existing service area, Cellular South has
filed this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief that will finally allow Cellular South to put its Band 12
spectrum to the good use for which it spent $192 million. See Doc. # 10 at ¶¶ 6-11.
10.

The Defendants plainly have the ability and resources to prepare their responsive

pleadings within the 44 days proposed by Cellular South – as underscored by the flurry of their
orchestrated April 16 filings [Doc. # 14; Doc. # 19; Doc. # 20; Doc. # 21] just two business days
after Cellular South served its Motion for Expedited Scheduling [Doc. # 10].
11.

Moreover, the Defendants’ assertions that they intend to devote the additional

seven days sought to a “massive fact-gathering effort” in order “to respond to every allegation of
the complaint” (Doc. # 19 at ¶ 3) is, at best, overstated. The Defendants almost certainly intend
to respond to the Complaint with a raft of Rule 12(b) motions and thus will not serve answers at
that time. Indeed, the Defendants reveal this clear intent with their repeated references to “a
potential motion to dismiss the complaint” (Doc. # 14 at ¶ 11) and their “right to file 12(b)(6)
and similar motions” (Doc. # 20 at ¶ 3). The Defendants therefore plainly seek the additional
seven days – on top of the additional 23 days already proposed by Cellular South – not to
“investigate any allegations” (Doc. # 14 at ¶ 11) or to conduct any “massive fact-gathering
effort” (Doc. # 19 at ¶ 3), but simply to further polish motions to dismiss – no doubt well
underway – that will assert a multitude of “jurisdictional challenges and/or Rule 12(b)(6)
challenges” (Doc. # 20 at ¶ 2).

5

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 22 Filed: 04/18/12 6 of 7 PageID #: 279

ACCORDINGLY, Cellular South respectfully requests that the Court first hear
argument and rule on Cellular South’s Motion for Expedited Scheduling and Case Management
Conference and Other Relief before ruling on the Defendants’ Motions for Extension, after
which the Defendants’ Motions for Extension should be denied.
