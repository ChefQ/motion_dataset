Defendants.

 

According to the Utah Courts website, Plaintiff must be an attorney in order to file
documents electronically. Plaintiff is requesting she be granted access to electronically
file documents for the following reasons:

1, Plaintiff is representing herself, essentially acting as Plaintiff's attorney.

2. It is an extreme hardship on Plaintiff to drive 20 miles to the courthouse and
20 miles to return home every time Plaintiff has to file a motion or respond to
such.

3, Plaintiff has a broken foot and it is an extreme hardship to find someone to get

the documents from Plaintiff and go to the courthouse for her.
Case 2:11-cv-00558-CW -SA Document 15 Filed 07/08/11 Page 2 of 3

4, Plaintiff has a broken foot and it is an extreme hardship and against doctor's
orders to walk significant distances and/or up and down stairs which is
required of Plaintiff if she is unable to find a third party to file the documents
for her.

5. Defendants have an unfair advantage over Plaintiff by having the ability to
e-file documents while Plaintiff does not.

6. Defendants argue in their Opposition to Appointment of Counsel that
"because Ms. Majors is sufficiently law trained that she believes she should be
awarded her degree without further study or effort on her part Hill v.
SmithKline Beecham Corp. argues that she should be allowed to use her
education and represent herself', Defendants indicate their willingness to treat
Plaintiff as an attorney.

7. Thus, because Defendants argue that Plaintiff should be treated as an attorney
and because Plaintiff is at an extreme disadvantage by not having the ability to
electronically file documents and because Plaintiff has suffered a medical
injury,

Plaintiff should be granted e-file access.
