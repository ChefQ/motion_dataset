JURY DEMAND

FOREST RIVER’S MOTION TO AMEND PLEADING

Forest River, Inc., requests permission to amend its “Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims”
in the manner of the attached “Amended Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims.”
Fed. R. Civ. P 15(a)(1)(A) permits a party to “amend its pleading once as a matter of course”
before being served with a responsive pleading. There has been no responsive pleading served by
Heartland. Instead, Heartland filed a motion to dismiss one of the Counterclaims under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 12. Hopefully, this amended pleading will make that motion moot.
A proposed form of Order has been sent to chambers herewith.

Dated: January 12, 2009

Respectfully submitted,
s/Ryan M. Fountain
