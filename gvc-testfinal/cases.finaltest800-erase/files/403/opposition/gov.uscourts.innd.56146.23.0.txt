Case No. 3:08-CV-490 AS CAN

HEARTLAND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES, LLC'S
OPPOSITION TO FOREST RIVER, INC.'S MOTION TO
AMEND ITS ANSWER, DEFENSES, AND COUNTERCLAIMS
Defendant Heartland Recreational Vehicles, LLC ("Heartland") opposes Forest River,
Inc.'s ("Forest River") Motion to Amend its Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims because, for
the same reasons set forth in Heartland's Motion to Dismiss the initial Answer, Defenses, and
Counterclaims, such an amendment would be futile. Accordingly, and for the reasons that
follow, Heartland respectfully requests that the Court deny Forest River's motion to amend its
Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims, and grant its pending Motion to Dismiss Forest River's
Lanham Act Counterclaim.

ARGUMENT
I.

FOREST RIVER'S PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ITS LANHAM ACT
COUNTERCLAIM IS FUTILE BECAUSE, EVEN IF ALLOWED, IT STILL
DOES NOT STATE A CLAIM FOR A VIOLATION OF THE LANHAM ACT
Forest River's Motion to Amend its Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims is futile

because even if all of the allegations in it are considered, it does not cure the deficiencies present
in the initial Lanham Act counterclaim against Heartland, and it therefore fails as a matter of law.
Out of the thirteen paragraphs (¶¶ 72 - 84) of the proposed Amended Answer, Defenses,
and Counterclaims that relate to Forest River's Lanham Act Counterclaim, Heartland can find
only one instance where a material change has been proposed to the allegations against
Heartland. Namely, proposed paragraph 79 contains the new statement that "[T]he hotel action
of Heartland resulted in some lost sales by Forest River."1 While that may be relevant to the
proposed new counterclaim for Criminal Deception (discussed in II., below), it does nothing to
cure the primary deficiency in its Lanham Act Counterclaim.
The issue is simple and straightforward - Forest River has not ever, in either its initial
Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims, or in its proposed Answer, Defenses, and
Counterclaims, alleged that Heartland made any misrepresentation or false statement
about any goods. Accordingly, the proposed Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims, even if
allowed, would be futile because it still does not state a claim for relief under the Lanham Act.
Therefore, Forest River's Motion to Amend should be denied.

1

Aside from the proposed change to paragraph 79, the only other proposed change to the allegations pertaining to
the alleged Lanham Act violation is found in paragraph 82. That paragraph includes some new language
regarding Catterton Partners, but does not appear to be relevant in any way to the issue of whether a claim under
the Lanham Act claim has been properly plead.

II.

FOREST RIVER'S PROPOSED CRIMINAL DECEPTION
COUNTERCLAIM SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED BECAUSE
IT TOO FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH RELIEF
CAN BE GRANTED

In Forest River's Proposed Amended Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims, it seeks to
add a counterclaim for Criminal Deception under I.C. § 35-43-5-3 (6). Under the statute, Forest
River must plead that Heartland, with the intent to defraud, misrepresented the identity of a
person or the identity or quality of property. I.C. § 35-43-5-3 (6) (emphasis added).
As a threshold matter, neither Forest River's initial Answer, Defenses, and
Counterclaims, nor its proposed Amended Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims, states a claim
for fraud, let alone criminal fraud. No claim for any kind of fraud can lie unless it is based on an
alleged misrepresentation. See I.C. § 35-43-5-3. Based upon the plain language of the statute, a
civil claim for deception under subsection (6) must be based upon a false or misleading
affirmative representation.
Heartland did not, and Forest River does not allege, that it made any misrepresentation
about goods. The only misrepresentation that Forest River alleges is that Heartland employees
told the hotel clerks that they were Forest River employees when they asked the hotel clerks to
distribute envelopes containing information about Heartland to the hotel guests. (See ¶ 76,
Proposed Amended Answer, Defenses, and Counterclaims). To suggest that such a
misrepresentation, even if we assume it to be true, rises to the level of criminal fraud would
result in a gross misuse of the statute. Forest River's counterclaim is nothing more than an
attempt to (1) circumvent the fact that it cannot state a claim under the Lanham Act (its initial
theory); and (2) obtain an award of treble damages, attorney's fees, and other costs under I.C. §

-3BDDB01 5545170v1

34-24-3-1.2 The bottom line is that I.C. § 35-43-5-3 is a criminal statute, not a broad-based
consumer sales statute. Therefore, under the facts of this case, no claim for Criminal Deception
has been stated.
CONCLUSION
Forest River never alleges that Heartland made any false statement or misrepresentation
regarding either its own products or Forest River's products. Rather, Forest River merely alleges
that the contents of the envelopes delivered to the hotel staff were falsely described and
represented to the hotel attendants as "important" and "needed for a Forest River dealer meeting
the next day." (¶ 63, Answer, Defenses, And Counterclaims.) These statements, even if taken as
true, are not sufficient to state a claim for which relief can be granted, under either the Lanham
act or the Criminal Deception statute. Accordingly, Forest River's Motion to Amend should be
denied as futile, and Heartland's pending Motion to Dismiss should be granted.

Indiana Code § 34-24-3-1 requires an allegation of pecuniary loss as a result of the criminal deception. This is
the motivation for adding the allegation regarding lost sales to ¶ 79 of the Amended Answer, Defenses, and
Counterclaims.
