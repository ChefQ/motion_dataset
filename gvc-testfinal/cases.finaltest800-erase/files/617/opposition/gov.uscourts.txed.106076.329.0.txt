Plaintiff Saxon Innovations, LLC (“Saxon”) submits this response to Defendants’
Objections To and Motion for Reconsideration of the Construction of the Claims of U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,502,689, 5,592,555 and 5,771,394 entered by Magistrate Love in his order dated July 30,
2009.
Defendants have not met their burden to show that Magistrate Judge Love’s order is
clearly erroneous or contrary to law, as required by § 636(b)(1)(A). Rather, the defendants
simply advance arguments that Magistrate Judge Love carefully considered and properly
rejected. Accordingly, the July 30, 2009 Order (hereinafter “Order”) should be adopted as to the
terms objected to by Defendants and their motion for reconsideration should be denied.
A. U.S. Pat. No. 5,502,689 1
1.
‘689 Claim Term
“disable request
signal”

“disable request signal”
Plaintiff’s Proposed
Construction
a signal to initiate entry
into a shut-down mode

Claims 5, 8

Defendants’ Proposed
Construction
a signal that requests the
system to stop the output
clock signal and that starts
the predetermined length of
time

Court’s Construction
A signal requesting
the system enter into
shut-down mode

The Court properly construed this term consistently with its use in the specification, and
reconsideration of this term is neither necessary nor appropriate. See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415
F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (the “proper definition is the definition that one of ordinary
skill in the art could ascertain from the intrinsic evidence in the record”). The specification for
the ‘689 Patent clearly supports the Court’s construction, stating that “[e]ntry into the shut-down
mode is under software control and may be initiated by writing the appropriate data via data bus
48 to a shut-down control register, such as the UCCCR register 42 shown in Fig. 1.” ‘689 Pat.,
col. 7:59-62 (emphasis added). See also ‘689 Pat., Fig. 1. Defendants would improperly limit

the signal to one in which the system stops the output clock signal. As Magistrate Love properly
found “the patent specification consistently describes “shut-down mode” as a power saving mode
in which “the clock generator does not generate any clock signals.” ‘689 Pat., col. 3:11-15.
(Order, DE311 at 9). The plain language of the claim, however, refers to a request, and the term
‘shut-down mode’ is described throughout the specification as a mode in which clocks may be
disabled. See, e.g., ‘689 Pat., col. 3:11-15. Thus a disable request signal is properly a “signal
requesting the system enter shut down mode.”
The defendants also attempt to import a requirement that the disable request signal also
start the predetermined length of time. Magistrate Love carefully considered these arguments
and properly rejected them as an improper attempt by the defendants to read limitations into the
claims. In fact, the defendants’ proposed definition would exclude the disclosed embodiments of
Figure 1, and was properly found to be incorrect as a matter of law. Order, DE 311 at 9; see also
Primos Inc. v. Hunter’s Specialties Inc., 451 F.3d 841, 848 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ([W]e ... should not
normally interpret a claim term to exclude a preferred embodiment.”); Vitronics Corp. v.
Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (stating a construction excluding the
preferred embodiment “is rarely, if ever correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary
support”).
In addition, as the Court properly determined, the disable request signal does not need to
start the predetermined length of time in either the preferred embodiment or the claim. Thus, the
Court’s construction properly accounts for the figure 1 embodiment and the actual claim
language. See, e.g., ‘689 Pat., Fig. 1; col. 8:66 – col. 9:3. The claim language simply requires
that the clock be stopped “after a predetermined length of time after receiving said disable

request signal.” ‘689 Pat., col. 12:18-20. It does not require that the disable request signal itself
initiate that time.
The claim requires that the disable request signal be verified against a protocol. The
specification discloses a first signal (signal 48) that is verified against a protocol. Defendants
make the startling admission that “[n]othing in the specification states that the first signal triggers
the predetermined length of time — indeed, unless the first signal is verified, the predetermined
length of time never begins.” Def. Br. at 4. Despite admitting that their proposed construction
finds no support in the claim or specification, defendants press on to ask improperly for a rewrite
of claim 5 so that it matches claim 1. More specifically, defendants ask to require that in the
claim, the disable request signal be interpreted as the different signal that is generated after the
protocol verification step which starts a delay timer. As Defendants themselves acknowledge,
such a rewriting of claim 5 would be improper and the Court properly rejected this argument.
The Court’s definition, wherein the disable request signal requests entry into shutdown
mode, is well supported by the specification and is correct. Moreover, contrary to defendants’
position, determining infringement of claim 5 of the ‘689 Patent is not rendered “impossible” if
the disable request signal does not start the predetermined length of time. To the contrary, and as
found in many of defendants products, there is a signal that requests entry into a shut down mode
that is verified against a predetermined protocol requirement. After that signal is received, there
is some time period within a known time period that expires, and the clock can thereafter be
disabled. It is not required that Claim 5 include a limitation for the signal that starts the
predetermined length of time, and the Court properly rejected Defendants’ efforts to add one.

Claim 5

Defendants complain that the Court’s construction of this term “creates substantial
uncertainty about when a particular shut-down meets the requirements of the claim, for a number
of reasons.” Def. Br. at 4. It does not. Indeed, the Court considered and properly rejected all of
Defendants’ arguments. The Court’s construction leaves no ambiguity as to when an accused
product meets the requirements of the claim.
The Defendants previously acknowledged that the predetermined length of time is “set as
the time when a specific pulse derived from an existing slow clock is generated.” DE 272, at 6;
see also ‘689 Pat., col. 7:13-16. Yet, the Defendants now feign lack of clarity as to when the
predetermined length of time starts. Def. Br. at 5. In the preferred embodiment, this time is
clearly shown as the time between state S1 and state S3 in Figure 3. ‘689 Pat., col. 8:30-45. The
time between state S1 and state S2 is dependent upon the timing of assertion of the SDENTR
signal, and therefore this entire predetermined length of time is variable and not defined until the
predetermined protocol is satisfied and that signal is asserted. Defendants also acknowledge that
signal 48 is part of the “disable request signal” and is received before the assertion of SDENTR.

-4-

Case 6:07-cv-00490-LED-JDL

Document 329

Filed 08/20/2009

Page 8 of 19

The SDENTR signal is asserted simultaneously with state S1, which, as Defendants note, is the
start of the predetermined length of time in the preferred embodiment.
The Court’s construction accounts for the plain language of the claim that the length of
time must be predetermined, or determined in advance, of the clock shut-down, but it is not
required to be an exact, fixed time, determined in advance of receipt of the disable request signal.
See ‘689 Pat., Figs. 2, 3; col. 8:26-46.
As the Court properly found, Defendants’ proposed construction is inconsistent with the
intrinsic evidence, cited above, which does not require the predetermined length of time to be a
fixed amount of time, nor is it required to be fixed prior to receiving a disable request signal.
Order, DE 311 at 11. As set forth above, the specification contemplates a time period that can
vary depending on the state of the system. See, e.g., col. 7:16-21 (“a user will have at least 3.56
msecs from the time entry into shut-down mode … to perform any other necessary housekeeping
routines.”) (emphasis added). Rather, the predetermined time can include a range (as explained
above) allowing for performance of certain operations and “housekeeping” activities in
preparation for shut-down. Furthermore, Defendants’ position that this construction was “given
up” during prosecution is inaccurate. Def. Br. at 6. Indeed, claim 5 (originally claim 17 in the
application as filed) never contained the word “minimum.” See Excerpts from the ‘689 Pat. File
history attached hereto as Exhibit B; see also Omega Engineering, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334
F.3d 1314, 1325-26 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("for prosecution disclaimer to attach, [Federal Circuit]
precedent requires that the alleged disavowing actions or statements made during prosecution be
both clear and unmistakable."). Defendants wrongly claim here that “the applicants changed the
language of the claims during prosecution of the ‘689 patent.” Def. Br. at 6. They did not.
Rather, applicants cancelled certain claims without prejudice in favor of allowed claim 5.

Further, as the Court properly found, where the word “minimum” was removed from the claims,
the patentee did not offer explanation of this change and a disavowal of scope was not made.
Order, DE 311 at 11.
Defendants also wrongly argue that, in the preferred embodiment, “the oscillator 10 and
its output clock signal are stopped immediately upon the second clock pulse from the 280.9Hz
clock.” Def. Br. at 5. This is neither true nor relevant to claim construction, as it is black letter
law that claims are not limited to the disclosed embodiment. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1323
(rejecting the contention that claims must be limited to disclosed embodiment even when there is
only a singly embodiment disclosed because (1) “section 112 of the Patent Act requires that the
claims themselves set forth the limits of the patent grant” and (2)”persons of ordinary skill in the
art rarely would confine their definitions of terms to the exact representations depicted in the
embodiments.”).The claim states that the clock is stopped “after” a predetermined length of time,
and does not say that the clock is stopped “immediately” upon expiration of that time. Further,
as shown and described in the preferred embodiment, the clock may not be stopped after the
expiration of the predetermined length of time. Indeed, an intervening interrupt may cause the
timer to restart such that the clock is stopped at a later time. In the preferred embodiment, this
time is clearly shown in the transition from state S2 back to state S0 prior to transition into state
S3 where the clock is in fact stopped. See, e.g., ‘689 Pat., col. 8:30-45 and Fig. 3.
Finally, it is not necessary, as Defendants assert, for the broader term “stopping said at
least one output clock …” to be construed. As the Court correctly found, the dispute resided with
the construction of “predetermined length of time,” which has been resolved by the Court.

Claim 5

The Court’s construction of this term is proper because it incorporates the plain and
ordinary meaning of the word “protocol.” Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-14. Furthermore,
defendants’ proposed construction is in error at least because the disable request signal of the
claim is itself required to satisfy “a requirement” of the “protocol” and not simply following a
series of steps. Also, the Defendants’ “series of steps” construction improperly attempts to
expand the claimed protection protocol beyond the scope of the invention for protecting the
system during clock shutdown events.
In addition, simply citing to prior briefing, Defendants have failed to properly object to
these terms as required by 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A). See, e.g., SCICO TEC GmbH v. Boston
Scientific Corp., 599 F. Supp. 2d 741, 743 (E.D. Tex. 2009) (rejecting defendant’s objections to
claim construction order as merely “conclusory” objections, “no better than a complete failure to
object”, because defendants merely asserted objection, and relied on the argument and authorities
set forth in its Responsive Claim Construction Brief.). Thus, for that reason alone, defendants’
objections to this term should be denied.

‘555 Claim Term
“signal processing

Claims 1, 10, 21, 22,
24, 26, 43-46, 51

“signal processing circuit”
Plaintiff’s Proposed
Construction
a circuit, within a
communications
controller circuit, that
executes program
instructions to process
communications signals
and executes program

Defendants’ Proposed
Construction

Court’s Construction
A circuit that executes
program instructions to
process communications
signals and executes
program instructions to
encipher or decipher such
signals

Defendants object to the Court’s construction stating that “a circuit” does not provide the
proper boundary as would the term “a processor.” Defendants’ argument misses the mark and
essentially reasserts its prior attempts to improperly insert limitations into the claim. The parties
agree that a signal processing circuit performs the tasks of processing communications signals
and executing instructions. DE 272 at 15. The specification supports Saxon’s construction,
which covers both a DSP and a general purpose microprocessor. ‘555 Pat., col. 10:52-55 (“The
present invention makes possible digital signature authentication and message encryption using
either a single DSP or a single microprocessor …”). As the Court confirms, the claims do not
require that the same circuitry in the “signal processing circuit” perform certain tasks. All that
the claim requires is that certain tasks be performed by the signal processing circuit and not the
same circuitry within the signal processing circuit. The file history supports the position that
encryption is integrated with the “signal processing circuit.” ‘555 Pat., Amendment at 30 (July
17, 1996), attached hereto as Exhibit D. The Defendants cannot show a clear disavowal of claim
scope in the file history with respect to this term, because there was none. Omega Eng’g, Inc.,

Court’s Construction
Performing a signal

Claims 1, 10, 21,
43, 51

The Court’s construction of this term fully and clearly accounts for the ordinary meaning
of the term “processing” such that a trier of fact can determine infringement and validity.
Indeed, prior briefing on this point ratifies that the Defendants’ proposed definition and Saxon’s
proposed definition do not differ, in that, for example, forward error correction is one example of
a signal processing operation that is performed on the communications signals. ‘555 Pat., col.
2:4-6; col. 10:23-32. Again, defendants admit that “error correction” is an example of a
processing operation that involves a “modification” of the data to be transmitted. Def. Br., DE
272 at 18, fn. 7. Thus, it is unnecessary to revisit the construction determined by the Court, and
defendants’ objection should be denied, particularly in light of the fact that Saxon’s proposal,
adopted by the Court, follows the language of the claim.

Construction
applying an enciphering
algorithm to the processed

Court’s Construction
Applying an enciphering
algorithm to encrypt (the)

communication signals

Defendants are blatantly attempting to insert a purpose limitation into the claims, namely,
that the enciphering is done to make the communication signals private. However, the
appearance of a word in the specification does not necessitate its insertion into the claims – the
claim language itself governs its scope. See Phillips at 1312 (quoting Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1582
("we look to the words of the claims themselves ... to define the scope of the patented
invention.")). Saxon’s proposed definition, adopted by the Court, is more precise and well
supported in the specification. See, e.g., ‘555 Pat., col. 3:6-11; 4:18-35; 8:23-25, 52-56.
Defendants’ assertion that the inclusion of the “privacy” limitation in the claims would be clearer
to a fact finder is merely an effort to inappropriately limit the claims. The claims require only
that a signal is enciphered. The purpose of enciphering is not a limitation in the claim, and
importing such a limitation creates confusion for a trier of fact, rather than eliminating it.
Although “privacy” may be one purpose of encrypting a signal, it is not the only purpose, nor do
the claims require it to be. Thus, the Court’s construction provides a clear definition and should
be affirmed.

Court’s Construction
executing in a signal

By the plain language of the claims, there is no doubt that the “signal processing circuit
comprises circuitry and instructions for enciphering said processed communication signals in
said signal processing circuit by programmably selecting an enciphering algorithm.” ‘555 Pat.,
col. 20: 21-24 (emphasis added). The defendants’ proposed definition of this term ignores the
actual claim language and selectively attempts to read limitations out of the claims. Although
Defendants suggest otherwise, the plain language of the claim calls for a signal processing circuit
that programmably selects: to state otherwise is to improperly read the clause in an illogical way.
The Court’s construction appropriately adheres to the actual language of the claim and is
therefore correct.
In addition, contrary to Defendants’ argument, the Court does not “acknowledge that the
current construction of this term excludes embodiments of the patent.” Def. Br. at 13. The Court
merely acknowledges that “a construction which would result in excluding the preferred, and
only, embodiment is ‘rarely, if ever, correct.’” Order, DE 311, at 18 (quoting Globetrotter
Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer Group, Inc., 362 F.3d 1367, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The
Court’s construction, however, does not exclude the preferred embodiment. Defendants’
objections of this construction should be denied.

Defendants object to the Court’s exclusion of the phrase “a finite number of steps,”

Br. at 14. Instead, Defendants categorize the language “a finite number of steps” as defining
“the method in which an ‘algorithm’ accomplishes its general purpose.” Id. As clearly explained
by the Court, such language is superfluous to the definition of “algorithm.” The term
“algorithm” is properly construed by defining what it is: a prescribed set of well defined rules or
processes. That prescribed set of well defined rules or processes is used to either encrypt or
decrypt signals. The Court has not omitted “the method” according to which an algorithm
operates, but even if it did, the definition of a term need not include “the method” by which it
operates.

Defendants once again attempt to insert an additional limitation into the claim – that the

the preferred embodiment that the processor may control the apparatus, it is not a requirement of
the claim. See, e.g., ‘394 Pat., col. 2:15-16. During prosecution, Saxon clearly differentiated the
master processor because it “does not allow a slave processor to take over control of the master
processor at any time,” not because it controls the apparatus, as defendants imply. See
Amendment 8/26/1997, p. 5, attached hereto as Exhibit F. In addition, by relying on prior
briefing, Defendants have failed to properly object to these terms as required by 28 U.S.C. §
636(b)(1)(A). See, e.g., SCICO TEC GmbH, 599 F. Supp. 2d at 743. Thus, for that reason alone,
Defendants’ objections to this term should be denied.

“respective indication signal”

U.S. Pat. No. 5,771,394 is attached hereto as Exhibit E.

Case 6:07-cv-00490-LED-JDL

‘394 Claim Term
“respective
indication signal”
Claim 11

Document 329

Plaintiff’s Proposed
Construction
a respective signal to
said master processor so
as to indicate to said
master processor

Filed 08/20/2009

Defendants’ Proposed
Construction
a signal generated by a
signal processor that
instructs the master
processor to read that
signal processor’s
exclusive memory

Page 17 of 19

Court’s Construction
No construction necessary

Defendants’ proposed construction, which attempts to attribute the action of “instructing”
to the “indication signal,” is inconsistent with the entire purpose of the claim. The Court
properly construes this term consistently with its definition for master processor. Notably,
defendants admit that the master processor is not under the control of a signal processor, yet in
their definition of “indication signal,” the signal processor “instructs” the master processor.
Thus, defendants’ proposed definition inserts a limitation into the claims, and is improper. In
addition, by relying on prior briefing, defendants have failed to properly object to these terms as
required by 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A). See, e.g., SCICO TEC GmbH, 599 F. Supp. 2d at 743.
Thus, for that reason alone, Defendants’ objections to this term should be denied.

‘394 Claim Term
“said plurality of
memories
comprise
respective portions
of a same
memory”

“respective portions of a same memory”
Plaintiff’s Proposed
Construction
said plurality of memories
comprise allocated
corresponding memory
locations of a single
memory device

Defendants’ Proposed
Construction
The plurality of memories
are respective blocks of a
single memory device

Court’s Construction
said plurality of
memories comprise
allocated corresponding
memory locations of a
single memory device

Claim 12

It is unclear to what Defendants are objecting in their discussion of this term. By failing
to specifically object to the Court’s construction of this term, Defendants have failed to properly
object to this term as required by 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A). See, e.g., SCICO TEC GmbH, 599
