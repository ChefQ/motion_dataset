OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT’S CONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DISPUTED TERMS
OF THE ‘689 PATENT
A.

“disable request signal”

Disputed Term
“disable request
signal”
Claims 5, 8

Saxon’s Proposal
Defendants’ Proposal
a signal to initiate
a signal that requests the
entry into a shut-down system to stop the output
mode
clock signal and that starts the
predetermined length of time

Court’s Construction
a signal requesting the
system enter into
shut-down mode

Defendants object to the Court’s construction of the term “disable request signal” and request
reconsideration of Defendants’ proposed construction for each of the reasons set forth in Defendant’s
Response Brief. See Brief, Docket Entry No. (“DE”) 272, at 1-4. Defendants’ construction was rejected
and the Court’s construction of this term was adopted in part because the Court determined that the
specification adequately defined shut-down mode. (Order, DE 311, at 9.) Accordingly, the Court’s
claim construction analysis focused on the potential ambiguity of Saxon’s proposal concerning the
phrase “initiate entry into” shut-down mode. The Court’s reference to the clear description of shut-down
mode in the specification demonstrates that the Court’s rejection of Defendants’ proposed construction
—which is faithful to that description — is erroneous and should be reconsidered.
The signal consistently described in the specification in connection with the request to enter shutdown mode is SDENTR, which is described as a “request to enter shut-down mode”:
The shut down control circuit 12 may be responsive to signals SDEXIT received on line 28,
the assertion of which indicates a request to exit shutdown, and SDENTR received on line 30,
the assertion of which indicates a request to enter shut-down mode.

‘689 patent, col. 6:43-47 (emphasis added); see also col. 8:10-13 (“Upon [verification], the
SDENTR signal may be asserted on line 30 signaling a request to enter the shut-down mode.”). In this
and every other place in the specification, the signal that requests entry into shut-down mode is the
SDENTR signal 30. Thus, the disable request signal of the claim is most analogous to, if not coincident
with, signal 30.
The request to enter shut-down mode in the specification is inextricably intertwined with the
predetermined length of time before the clock is stopped. The use of “disable request signal” in the
“Summary of the Invention” demonstrates that the disable request is the triggering event for the
predetermined length of time:
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the step of stopping the at least one output
clock signal may include the step of stopping the at least one output clock signal after the
predetermined length o [sic] time following the most recent assertion of the disable request
signal.
‘689 patent, col. 4:63-67 (emphasis added); see also Claim 8 (mirroring claim language). Moreover,
contrary to the Court’s analysis in footnote 2, there is clear support in the specification for the
relationship between the disable request signal — the signal requesting the system to enter shut-down
mode — and the predetermined length of time in the claims:
Further, the clock generator of the present invention provides a predetermined time delay from
a request to enter shut-down mode to the disabling of the module clock signals, providing time
to prepare the modules for shut-down and to complete any necessary housekeeping routines.
‘689 patent, 9:47-51 (emphasis added). This passage is entirely consistent with the purpose of the
invention, and with the initial description of the invention quoted above: “The shut-down entry delay
timer 14 provides a time delay between a request to enter shut-down mode and the disablement of the
oscillator 10. This time delay may be used to allow one or more of the modules 6 in the electrical
system 2 to be programmed to its idle state, or to complete any necessary housekeeping
operations.” ‘689 patent, 6:57-62 (emphasis added).
Thus, contrary to the Court’s ruling, the disable request signal — i.e., the signal requesting entry
into shut-down mode — is the signal that starts the predetermined length of time. The Court declined to

reach this conclusion, stating that “Defendants’ interpretation would exclude the figure 1 embodiment,
which shows a separate signal initiating the predetermined length of time after signal 48 is verified, from
the scope of the claim.” (Order, DE 311, at 9.) However, any conflict between Claim 5 and the figure 1
embodiment is caused by how Claim 5 was drafted, not by Defendant’s construction of this claim.
Unasserted Claim 1 reflects that the specification discloses two distinct signals: a first signal that is
verified to ensure that the device will not be inadvertently shut down (i.e., the “shut-down entry request
signal”), and a second signal that actually requests the system to enter shut-down mode (i.e., the “disable
activation signal”). Nothing in the specification states that the first signal triggers the predetermined
length of time — indeed, unless the first signal is verified, the predetermined length of time never
begins.
In contrast to Claim 1, Claim 5 mentions only one signal but adds the concept of a
“predetermined length of time” to shut down. The only claimed signal requests that the device enter a
shut-down mode. As discussed above, the specification and figure 1 make clear that the signal
requesting shut-down initiates the predetermined length of time. The problem is that Claim 5 also
includes a verification step that is performed on the same signal that requests shut-down. However, the
Court should not use the claim construction process to “fix” any disconnect between Claim 5 and the
specification of the patent. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., Ltd., 535 U.S. 722,
736 (2002) (“What is claimed by the application must be the same as what is disclosed in the
specification.”); Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 314 F.3d 1313, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2003)
(“The purpose of the written description requirement is to prevent an applicant from later asserting that
he invented that which he did not; the applicant for a patent is therefore required to 'recount his invention
in such detail that his future claims can be determined to be encompassed within his original creation.'
(citation omitted).”)
The Court’s attempt to “fix” the foregoing written description problem renders the claim
indefinite because there is no way to determine when the predetermined length of time begins. The Court
3

Case 6:07-cv-00490-LED-JDL

states that Claim 5 “recites the steps of (1) receiving a disable request signal, (2) verifying it, and (3)
stopping the output clock signal only after the disable signal has been received and verified and a
predetermined length of time has elapsed.” (Order, DE 311, at 9). Although the Court states that
“[t]here is no requirement that the disable request signal must start the predetermined length of time,”
neither the Court’s construction, nor any other limitation in Claim 5, specifies anything that starts the
predetermined length of time. If the “predetermined length of time” is started by some unclaimed and
unspecified subsequent signal, as the Court assumes, rather than the “disable request signal,” a person of
ordinary skill cannot know when the “predetermined length of time” begins (and ends) according to the
invention claimed in Claim 5, thereby making it impossible for an accused infringer to determine when
he is, or is not, infringing the claim.

Defendants object to the Court’s construction of the term “predetermined length of time,” and the
Court’s decision not to construe the term “stopping said at least one output clock signal after a
predetermined length of time after receiving said disable request signal,” and request reconsideration of
Defendants’ proposed constructions for each of the reasons set forth in Defendant’s Response Brief. See
Brief, DE 272 at 4-6. The Court’s construction of “predetermined length of time,” and its refusal to
construe the larger “stopping” step, is erroneous because it creates substantial uncertainty about when a
particular shut-down meets the requirements of the claim, for a number of reasons.

First, as discussed in the preceding section, if the disable request signal does not start the
predetermined length of time to shut down, nothing in the claim defines when the predetermined length
of time commences. Assuming a “known period” means a specified range from a minimum to a
maximum amount of time, the Court’s construction does not clearly indicate when this period starts, or
when it ends.1
Second, the Court’s construction fails to specify when shut-down mode occurs. The Court’s
construction could be read to include shut down that occurs at some unspecified time following the
expiration of the predetermined length of time. The Court’s construction is therefore inconsistent with
the patent specification, in which shut down occurs immediately upon expiration of the predetermined
length of time. In the only described embodiment, the clock is shut down upon the receipt of the second
clock pulse from the 280.9Hz clock (Fig. 2, line 36) after assertion of the START TIMER signal (which,
in turn, is triggered by the assertion of the SDENTR signal on line 30). ‘689 patent, col. 8:26-48.
Depending on when the SDENTR signal is asserted, the second pulse may take almost two full clock
cycles, or it may take little more than one clock cycle. Id. at col. 7:4-20 and Fig. 2. Regardless of this
variability, however, the oscillator 10 and its output clock signal are stopped immediately upon the
second clock pulse from the 280.9Hz clock.
By declining to construe the larger “stopping” phrase, the Court leaves open the possibility that a
clock that is stopped some undefined amount of time following the predetermined length of time could
meet the claim requirements. Indeed, the Court’s construction could arguably be met even if shut-down
occurred five hours following the conclusion of the predetermined length of time (which in the preferred

To the extent the Court does not sustain Defendants’ objection, Defendants respectfully request that the
Court clarify that the predetermined length of time begins upon verification of the disable request
signal (as the Court has construed disable request signal). This is well-supported by the specification,
which states that immediately upon verification of the signal sent on line 48, the SDENTR signal is
asserted on line 30, which starts the predetermined length of time. ‘689 patent, col. 8:33-35 (“The
setting of UCCR[7] causes the register access circuit 20 to assert the SDENTR signal on line 30.”).

embodiment is only several milliseconds). Such a long delay would obfuscate the very purpose of the
invention — reducing power consumption.
The Court’s construction turns the predetermined length of time into a minimum amount of time
delay to shut down, because any time delay equal to, or greater than, the predetermined length to time
would satisfy this construction. In its Order, the Court erroneously held that the removal of the term
“minimum” during prosecution broadens, not narrows, the scope of Claim 5. (Order, DE 311, at 11).
For example, in the disclosed embodiment, a “predetermined minimum amount of time” construction
would mean that shut down occurs within 3.56 to 7.12 msecs, or any delay longer than 7.12 msecs.
Under the proper “predetermined length of time” construction, shut down must occur between 3.56 and
7.12 msecs, and not longer. Such an interpretation is consistent with the intrinsic record and stays true to
the invention. The Court’s construction effectively and erroneously restores claim coverage that was
given up during prosecution.2
Finally, the Court’s construction — “a length of time within a known time period” – does not
specify when the “known time period” is defined. In contrast, Defendants’ proposed construction for the
“predetermined length of time” properly requires that the predetermined length of time is determined
before receipt of the disable request signal. This is consistent with the plain language of
“predetermined.” It is also consistent with claim language specification, which discloses that the
number of clock cycles between receipt of the SDENTR signal and clock shut down is set before the
sending of the disable request signal.

The Court’s citation of Omega Engineering, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2003) is
inapposite. In Omega, the Federal Circuit reversed a district court’s claim construction that added an
explicit negative limitation to the claim, which was not present on the language of the claim, nor clearly
supported in the prosecution history. Id. at 1322 ("means for causing said at least one laser beam to
strike the periphery of the energy zone, but not strike the center or interior portion of the energy zone,
for visibly outlining said entire energy zone.”) citation omitted; (added negative limitation shown in
italics). In Omega, the applicant did not amend the claims, but did make arguments during prosecution
regarding a related aspect of the invention in order to overcome prior art. In contrast, here the applicants
changed the language of the claims during prosecution of the ‘689 patent.

proposed construction, Defendants request that at a minimum, the Court modify the construction to: “a
processor that uses the same circuitry to load, store, and execute signal processing instructions and
enciphering algorithms.” The Court indicated that the inclusion of “signal processor” in Defendants’
7

Case 6:07-cv-00490-LED-JDL

Page 9 of 18

original proposed construction was improper because “the patent specification contemplates a variety of
embodiments” such as digital signal processors and microprocessors. Order, DE 311, at 16. Broadening
the construction to include “processors” rather than just “signal processors” would address this concern
while at the same time reducing the ambiguity caused by the Court’s current construction, as explained
below.
Defendants object to the Court’s construction for the term “signal processing circuit” as it fails to
properly define the “metes and bounds” of the claimed invention and does not give adequate weight to
the teachings of the intrinsic evidence. Specifically, a “circuit,” as understood by one of ordinary skill in
the art, is simply a pathway that allows electric current to flow. See IEEE Standard Dictionary of
Electrical and Electronic Terms, The Institute of Electric and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (1984), p. 143,
relevant pages attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (defining a “circuit” as “[a] conductor or system of
conductors through which an electric current is intended to flow”). As such, both parties’ technical
experts, using the Court’s claim construction above, could conceivably “draw a box” as broadly or as
narrowly as they wish to define the “circuit.” While the Court’s construction does require that the
“circuit” is one that “executes program instructions to process communications signals and executes
program instructions to encipher or decipher such signals,” such a qualifier provides only a minimum,
and no maximum, boundary for the “signal processing circuit.”
The intrinsic evidence of the ‘555 patent clearly supports the inclusion of “a signal processor,” or
at a minimum, “a processor” to provide this necessary boundary. Specifically, the only “circuit”
referenced in the specification that both processes and enciphers communications signals is a
“processor” (whether that “processor” takes the form of a digital signal processor or a general-purpose
microprocessor). See ‘555 patent col. 4:39-47; col. 6:52-55 (Ex. C-1 from Defendants’ Brief, DE 272);
see also June 25, 2009 Claim Construction Hearing Transcript at 103:7-10 (“indicat[ing] that the present
invention could be implemented in either a DSP or a microprocessor”). While it is typically not
appropriate to limit the construction of a claim term to a particular embodiment disclosed in the
8

Case 6:07-cv-00490-LED-JDL

Filed 08/13/2009

specification, in situations where the specification or the prosecution history clearly indicates that the
invention encompasses no more than a particular structure, the breadth of the claims can extend no
further than that particular structure. See Abbott Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc., 566 F.3d 1282, 1288 (Fed. Cir.
2009); see also Alloc, Inc. v Int’l Trade Comm’n, 342 F.3d 1361, 1370 (Fed. Cir 2003) (noting that a
court must look to “whether the specification refers to a limitation only as a part of less than all possible
embodiments or whether the specification read as a whole suggests that the very character of the
invention requires the limitation be a part of every embodiment”). As the only disclosed “circuit” that
both processes and enciphers communications signals is a “processor,” the construction of the “signal
processing circuit” must reflect that fact.
Finally, the Court’s construction does not give adequate weight to the prosecution history.
Specifically, during the prosecution of the ‘555 patent, the patent applicant, in differentiating the present
invention from the disclosures of the prior art, stated as follows:
As claimed in Claims 1, 21, and 43, Applicant’s invention is patentably distinct over the
Ashby [prior art] reference in that Applicant’s claimed invention implements
encryption/decryption as an additional task performed by the signal processing circuit.
The Ashby reference on the other hand, teaches the use of a separate and distinct device
for the purpose of maintaining high-rate encryption data streams. This separate device is
the data encryption device 22 of Figure 1 of the Ashby reference … The Ashby reference
teaches that the data encryption device 22 can be a standard DES encoder such as the one
available from TEXAS INSTRUMENTS. The Ashby reference does not teach the
integration of encryption with a signal processing circuit as required by Claims 1, 21, and
43.
‘555 Patent File History, Amendment (July 17, 1996) at 30-31 (Ex. C-2 from Defendants’ Brief, DE
272) (emphasis in original). A comparison of Figure 1 of the Ashby reference (U.S. Patent No. 5,150,
401) and Figure 3 of the ’555 Patent illustrates the distinction made by the patent applicant:

9

Case 6:07-cv-00490-LED-JDL

Document 321

Filed 08/13/2009

Page 11 of 18

As shown from the excerpt and the highlighted figures above, the patent applicant specifically
relied on the fact that the processing and enciphering steps are integrated into a signal processing circuit
in the ‘555 patent, as opposed to divided into separate devices as shown in the prior art Ashby reference.
In distinguishing the alleged invention of the ‘555 patent from the prior art, the patent applicant clearly
surrendered a construction of the term “signal processing circuit” that would allow for the processing
and enciphering steps to be performed by separate devices (as in the prior art). See Omega Eng’g, Inc. v.
Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (noting that the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer
“limits the interpretation of claims so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or
disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance.”) (quoting Standard Oil Co. v. Am.
Cyanamid Co., 774 F.2d 448, 452 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Court’s claim construction, which does not
provide an outer boundary for the “signal processing circuit,” and therefore could allow that “circuit” to
include effectively everything within the “communication controller circuit,” allows Saxon to essentially
recapture that which was given up during prosecution – namely, that processing and enciphering can be
accomplished by separate devices. Accordingly, for all the reasons discussed above, Defendants’ object
to the Court’s construction for the term “signal processing circuit” and request that the Court reconsider
this term and adopt Defendants’ original proposed construction or, at a minimum, Defendants’ slightly
modified construction proposed above.

Defendants object to the Court’s construction of the phrase “processing the communication

forth in Defendant’s Response Brief. See Brief, DE 272, at 17-18. Defendants’ further object to the
Court’s construction of the phrase “processing the communication signals,” as it fails to clearly define
the “metes and bounds” of the claimed invention such that the ultimate trier of fact can determine
infringement and validity.
The Court, in adopting Saxon’s proposed construction, effectively defines the term “processing”
as a “signal processing operation.” Such a construction does not sufficiently define what “processing”
entails, as it is not clear what specifically would qualify as a “signal processing operation.” In its
opening claim construction brief, Saxon claims that “processing” is “a well known term” and that it has
an “ordinary meaning.” Saxon Br. at 18. However, Saxon’s, and ultimately the Court’s construction
does not enlighten the ultimate trier of fact as to what that “ordinary meaning” actually is.
In contrast to the Court’s construction, Defendants’ proposed construction, including the
requirement that “processing” include a modification of the data to be transmitted, provides the parties’
experts and the ultimate trier of fact with a palpable definition of “processing” (i.e. a modification of the
data). As the Court indicated that it was “unable to discern any claim scope dispute with regard to this
term” between Plaintiff’s and Defendants’ proposed constructions (see Order, DE 311, at 17),
Defendants request that the Court reconsider this term and adopt Defendants’ proposed construction.

The Court’s construction, which requires the step of “applying an enciphering algorithm to

uses the terms “enciphering” and “encrypt” in the same construction, without providing a definition for
either. To the contrary, Defendants’ proposed construction, which specifically defines the “enciphering”
algorithm as one that “make[s] the processed communications signals private,” eliminates any such
potential confusion. As Defendants proposed construction would be clearer to the ultimate fact finder,

reasons set forth in Defendant’s Response Brief.3 See Brief, DE 272, at 19-20. The Court appears to
acknowledge that the current construction of this term excludes embodiments of the patent, but then
accepts this exclusion in order to comply with Federal Circuit precedent prohibiting it from redrafting
claim language. (See Order, DE 311, at 18). The Court’s choice is unnecessary and erroneous.
Although the plain language of the claims require that the enciphering must occur within the
signal processing unit, it does not require that the programmably selecting limitation take place in any
particular location. Parsing the language of the claim element, a reasonable interpretation is that the
phrase “in said first signal processing circuit” modifies the earlier clause “enciphering said processed
communication signals”, rather than the later clause “by programmably selecting an enciphering
algorithm.” Thus, under this construction, because the selection can occur outside of the signal
processing circuit, as long as the actual enciphering occurs within the signal processing circuit, the plain
language of the claim is preserved. Moreover, because this approach does not exclude any embodiments
of the ‘555 patent, it is the appropriate construction. See Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer

Defendants note, however, that the Court’s construction for this phrase, which was originally proposed
by Saxon, supports Defendants’ contention outlined above that the “signal processing circuit” must be
construed as a “processor.” Specifically, the Court’s claim construction for this phrase requiring that the
signal processing circuit “executes … program instructions” denotes that the “circuit” in question must
be a “processor,” as only a “processor” can “executes program instructions.”

object to the Court’s constructions for “enciphering algorithm” and “deciphering algorithm” as the Court
effectively discarded that portion of the proposed constructions on which the parties agreed.
Specifically, the Court’s constructions disregard the fact that an algorithm solves a problem in a number
of “steps,” a requirement that both parties proposed in their respective constructions. If the Court
declines to adopt Defendants’ original proposed constructions, Defendants request that at a minimum,
the Court modify the constructions to: “a prescribed set of well-defined rules or processes for encrypting
signals in a finite number of steps” and “a prescribed set of well-defined rules or processes for
decrypting signals in a finite number of steps,” respectively.
Contrary to the Court’s statement in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the phrase “a finite
number of steps” does not define the general purpose of an algorithm (see Order, DE 311, at 19).
Rather, the general purpose of the algorithm is defined by whether the algorithm is for “encrypting
signals” or “decrypting signals.” The phrase “a finite number of steps” defines the method in which an
“algorithm” accomplishes its general purpose. As such, by omitting the method in which an “algorithm”
accomplishes its general purpose, the Court’s constructions fail to fully define the term “algorithm.”4
Accordingly, Defendants object to the Court’s construction for the terms “enciphering algorithm” and
“deciphering algorithm,” and request that the Court reconsider these terms and adopt Defendants’
original constructions or, at a minimum, the revised constructions offered by Defendants herein.

Defendants acknowledge that the Court’s construction captures a portion of the method of the
“algorithm” by including the phrase “a set of well-defined rules or processes.” However, this definition
is incomplete, as both Saxon and Defendants recognize that the general purpose of the algorithm must be
accomplished in a “finite number of steps.”

OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT’S CONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DISPUTED TERMS
OF THE ‘394 PATENT
A.

Disputed Term

“master processor”/“respective indication signal”
Saxon’s Proposal

Defendants’ Proposal

Court’s Construction

“master
processor”
Claim 1

general purpose
processor not under
control of a signal
processor

a general purpose
microprocessor, not under the
control of a signal processor,
that controls the apparatus

general purpose
processor not under
control of a signal
processor

“respective
indication
signal”
Claim 11

a respective signal to
said master processor
so as to indicate to said
master processor

a signal generated by a signal
processor that instructs the
master processor to read that
signal processor’s exclusive
memory

No construction
necessary.

Defendants object to the Court’s construction of the terms “master processor” and “respective
indication signal” request reconsideration of Defendants’ proposed constructions for each of the reasons
set forth in Defendant’s Response Brief. See Brief, DE 272, at 23; 27-29.
B.

“respective portions of a same memory”

Disputed Term
“said plurality of
memories comprise
respective portions
of a same memory”
Claim 12

Saxon’s Proposal
said plurality of
memories comprise
allocated
corresponding memory
locations of a single
memory device

Defendants’ Proposal
the plurality of
memories are
respective blocks of a
single memory device

Court’s Construction
said plurality of memories
comprise allocated
corresponding memory
locations of a single
memory device

The Court stated that it “is unable to discern a substantive difference between the parties’
proposals. Because Saxon’s proposal more closely follows the actual claim language, the Court adopts
Saxon’s proposed construction . . . .” (Order, DE 311, at 28.) To the extent that Saxon contends that
there is a substantive difference between its proposed construction and Defendants’, Defendants object
to the Court’s construction of the phrase “said plurality of memories comprise respective portions of a
same memory” and request reconsideration of Defendants’ proposed construction for each of the reasons
set forth in Defendant’s Response Brief. See Brief, DE 272, at 29-30.
