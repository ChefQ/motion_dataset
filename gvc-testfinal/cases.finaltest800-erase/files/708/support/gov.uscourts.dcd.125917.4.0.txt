PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Plaintiff, the Federal Trade Commission (the "Commission"), by its designated attorneys,
moves the Court pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7
53(b), for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining defendant Whole
Foods Market, Inc. ("Whole Foods"), including its domestic and foreign agents, divisions,
subsidiaries, affiliates, partnerships, and joint ventures, from acquiring any stock, assets, or other
interest, directly or indirectly, from defendant Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats').

The Commission has filed in this Court a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order
and a preliminary injunction restraining the consummation of any acquisition by Whole Foods of

Wild Oats, pending final disposition before the Commission of administrative proceedings to
Case 1:07-cv-01021-PLF Document4-2 Filed 06/06/2007 Page2of3

determine whether such acquisition violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 18, and
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 45.

Absent temporary injunctive relief, defendants will be free to consummate the proposed
transaction after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, June 6, 2007.

A preliminary injunction is needed on the ground that there is reason to believe that, if
defendants are permitted to consummate such acquisition, defendants will violate Section 5 of
the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 45, and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.
0x00A7 18, by engaging in unfair methods of competition and otherwise substantially lessening
competition or tending to create a monopoly in the relevant markets as alleged in the complaint.
The Commission further asserts that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest because
such relief will both preserve competition by maintaining the status quo and enable the
Commission to order effective antitrust relief after an administrative adjudication of the merits of
the case.

This motion is supported by the memorandum of points and authorities and attached
exhibits filed with this motion.

The Commission respectfully requests the opportunity to present oral argument in support
of this motion.

Notice of this motion has been given to defendants' attorneys by the undersigned
attorneys prior to the filing of the present action and defendants' attorneys have indicated that
they will oppose the motion.

A proposed temporary restraining order and a proposed preliminary injunction order are

attached.

injured because the Commission will be deprived of its ability to order effective relief should the
acquisition ultimately be found to violate the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission
Act;

(A defendants will not be substantially injured by the relief afforded by this Order,
and

(5) plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of a likelihood of success on the merits of
its complaint to warrant the relief afforded by this Order;

interest, directly or indirectly, in defendant Wild Oats; and

[PROPOSED] TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
Pursuant to authority conferred by Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 33(b), plaintiff, the Federal Trade Commission (the "Commission"), having reason
to believe that defendant Whole Poods Market, Inc. ("Whole Foods"), is violating or is about to
violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 45, and Section 7 of the
Clayton Act, i5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 18, in that defendant Whole Foods is about to acquire the voting
securities of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats"), and the Court having considered the
Commission's complaint for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and motion for a temporary restraining

order, and the papers filed in support thereof, and it appearing that:

(1) In the absence of temporary relief, defendant Whole Foods will be free to

consummate the proposed acquisition of Wild Oats after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on
June 6, 2007,

(2) Piaintiff has made a sufficient showing of a likelihood of success on the merits of

the public interest, and is appropriate and necessary to prevent the planned transaction.

temporarily restrained and enjoined from consummating any acquisition of any stock, assets, or
other interest, directly or indirectly, in Wild Oats.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant Whole Foods take any and all necessary
steps to prevent any of its domestic or foreign agents, divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates,
partnerships, or joint ventures from making any such acquisition.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant Whole Foods appear before this Court at
