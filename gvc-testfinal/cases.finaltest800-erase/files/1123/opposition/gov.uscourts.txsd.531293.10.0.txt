CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:07-cv-03367

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
CLAIMANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
United States opposes Claimant George J. Kioussis’ motion for summary
judgment.
Claimant’s Motion for Summary Judgment
1. The claimant has moved for summary judgment on the following grounds:
a. “Since the U.S. Attorney declined criminal prosecution
of the claimant there is obviously no violation of section
5332(a). Without a violation of section 5332(a) there can
be no civil forfeiture under section 5332(c),” and
b. Forfeiture of all the funds would violate the Excessive
Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution.
These arguments are without merit.

No Criminal Conviction Is Required for Civil Forfeiture
2. A criminal prosecution of the Claimant is immaterial to civil forfeiture
proceedings. The failure to prosecute has no effect on the United States’ ability to
pursue civil forfeiture. Pimentel v. U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin., 99 F. Supp.2d
420, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Even an acquittal of the underlying criminal charges
does not affect the United States’ right to seek a civil forfeiture. United States v.
One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354, 361-362 (1984) (acquittal on gun
violation under 18 U.S.C. § 922 does not bar civil forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. §
982(d)); One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U.S. 232, 234-35
(1972) (acquittal on criminal smuggling charge does not bar later civil forfeiture).
Forfeiture of the Full $60,725 Is Permissible under the Eighth Amendment
3. In United States v. Wallace, 389 F.3d 483, 485, (5th Cir. 2004), the Fifth
Circuit stated that if the value of the forfeited property is within the range of fines
prescribed by Congress, a strong presumption arises that the forfeiture is
constitutional. In this case, violations of 31 U.S.C. §§ 5316, Currency Violation
Offense, and 31 U.S.C. § 5332, Bulk Cash Smuggling, are the basis for the
forfeiture action. The statutory fine for each offense under 18 U.S.C. § 3571 is
$250,000. Thus, the forfeiture of the full $60,725 would be presumed to be
constitutional.
