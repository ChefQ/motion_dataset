MEMORANDUM OF AUTHORITY
Paragraphs |-13 are realleged.

1. THERE IS NO LEGAL BASIS TO FORFEFT THE DEFENDANT
CURRENCY UNDER THE "BULK CASH" PROVISIONS

 

In support of our position that the defendant currency cannot be forfeited under the
alleged "bulk cash" violation we refer the Court to the most cogent analysis of section 5332
in the post Bajakajian and section O83(cent) era set forth in United States y. $293,316, 349 P,
Supp. 2d 638, 642 CE.D. NY. 2004):

"Section 5332(a) of title 31 of the United States Code provides that a currency
smuggling offense is committed when a person, with the intent to evade a
currency reporting requirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more
than $ 10,000 in currency and transports or attempts to transport that currency
out of the United States. See 31 U.S.C.A. 0x00A7 5332(a) (West 2003).

The civil forfeiture provision in section 5332(c) reads:

(1) In general.--Any property involved in a violation of subsection (a), ora
conspiracy to commit such violation, and any property traceable to such
violation or conspiracy, may be seized and . . . forfeited to the United States.

(2) Procedure.--The seizure and forfeiture shall be governed by the
procedures governing civil forfeitures in money laundering cases pursuant to
section 98 l(aj(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code.

(3) Treatment of certain property as involved in the offense.--For purposes
of this subsection and subsection (b), any currency or monetary instrument that
is concealed or intended to be concealed in violation of subsection (a) or a
conspiracy to commit such violation, any article, container, or conveyance
used, or intended to be used, to conceal or transport the currency or other
monetary instrument, and any other property used, or intended to be used, to
facilitate the offense, shall be considered property involved in the offense.

31 US.C.A. 0x00A7 5332(c) (West 2003) (emphasis added).
Case 4:07-cv-03367 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 12/28/07 Page 4 of 10

Section 5332 of title 31 of the United States Code, also referred to as the bulk
cash smuggling statute, was enacted in October 2001 as part of the USA
Patriot Act. USA Patriot Act, Pub. L. 107-56, Tit. HE, 0x00A7 371, 115 Stat. 272,
336-38 (2001). Recognizing that smuggling a large quantity of cash is `one of
the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money
laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes,' H.R. 3162, 107th
Cong., 0x00A7 371{aj(G3) 2001} (enacted), Congress stated that the purposes of
section 5332 are:

(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense;

(2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggle
offense; and

(3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of buik cash smuggling.
H.R. 3162, 0x00A7 371 (b).

In enacting section 5332, Congress suggested dissatisfaction with limitations
placed on forfeiture amounts by United States v. Bajakajian. A Congressional
finding reads:

The current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements
are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds.
In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is
a reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation
of smuggled currency. In contrast, ifthe smuggling of bulk cash were itself an
offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling
offense.

H.R. 3162, 0x00A7 371(a)(6); see also Stefan D. Cassella, Bulk Cash Smugeling and
the Globalization of Crime: Overcoming Constitutional Challenges to
Forfeiture under 31 U.S.C, 0x00A7 5332,22 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 98, 107 (2004)
(`Picking up on the distinction between smuggling offenses and reporting
violations in Bajakajian, Congress noted that as long as bulk cash smuggling
was considered only a currency reporting offense, the penalties could not
"adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency."').

Section 5332 criminalizes the unreported transport of large quantities of
currency rather than merely the failure to report such transport, as under
section 5316. Imposition of civil forfeiture under section 5332(c) is predicated
Case 4:07-cv-03367 Document9_ Filed in TXSD on 12/28/07 Page 5 of 10

on the commission of the crime of currency smuggling. See 31 U.S.C.A. 0x00A7
5332(c)(1) (`Any property involved in a violation of subsection (a)... .'
(emphasis added}). The procedures governing civil forfeitures under section
5332(c) are the same as those that govern money laundering cases. See 31
US.C.A. 0x00A7 0x00A7332(c)(2) (Pursuant to section 981(a)C (A) of title 18, United
States Code'). These procedures are set out in section 983 of title 18 of the
United States Code and are applicable to all federal civil forfeitures except
those specifically enumerated. See 18 U.S.C_A. 0x00A7 9834) (West 2000 & Supp.
2004) (defining `civil forfeiture statute' to include all but five enumerated
statutes). Neither section 5332 of title 31 of the United States Code nor
section 981 of title 18 of the United States Code are enumerated and thus the
procedures set out in section 983 are applicable. See id. Section 983 includes
an innocent owner defense. 18 U.S.C.A. 0x00A7 983(d) (West 2000 & Supp. 2004).

The government argues that section 5332(c) of title 31 of the United States
Code mandates civil forfeiture of all seized currency, without reduction. This
argument is unconvincing. [This is the same allegation as in the instant case. |

The plain language of section 5332(c) belies the government's interpretation:
the statute uses `may' rather than `shall'" See 31 ULS.C.A. 0x00A7 5332(c)(1) CAny
property ... may be seized and .. . forfeited... ." (emphasis added)). In
contrast, the parallel criminal forfeiture provision uses `shall' See 31 U.S.C.A.
0x00A7 5332(b)(2) (West 2003) (`The court . . . shall order that the defendant forfeit
... any property.' (emphasis added)). The text of section 5332(c} does not
mandate civil forfeiture of the entire property serzed.

Assuming arguendo that the statutory language is ambiguous, resort to the
legislative history to discern the intent of Congress is unavailing. In the
legislative history, Congress did not express a design to mandate, as opposed
to permit, civil forfeiture of all property seized under section 5332. As
Congress put it, a purpose of section 5332 is to `authorize' forfeiture. H.R.
3162, 0x00A7 37LD)Q2).

Arguably, if section 5332(c) mandated complete civil forfeiture, such a
provision would be invalid under Bajakajian. To avoid a constitutional issue
the more benign view of the statute should be adopted. See, e.g., Muntagim v.
Coombe, 366 F.3d 102, 115 n.t5 (2d Cir. 2004) (discussing constitutional
avoidance canon as summarized in DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Guif Coast
Bldg, & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 99 L. Ed. 2d 645, 108 S,
Ct. 1392 (1988): `Where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute
would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute
Case 4:07-cv-03367 Document9 Filed in TXSD on 12/28/07 Page 6 of 10

to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the
intent of Congress.'). Cf. generally Sarah Newland, Note, The Mercy of Scalia:
Statutory Construction and the Rule of Lenity,29 HARV. C.R.-C.L. L. REV.
197 (1994).

Forfeiture of currency under section 5332(c) constitutes punishment because
it is predicated on the crime of currency smuggling and cannot be imposed
upon an innocent owner. See Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 328; 18 U.S.C.A. 0x00A7 983
(West 2000 & Supp. 2004). The argument that forfeiture under section 5332(c)
does not constitute punishment is based on a misreading of Bajakajian. That
case's holding that the forfeiture was punitive was not based on whether
currency is considered an instrumentality. See 524 U.S. at 333 Cit is therefore
irrelevant whether respondent's currency is an instrumentality; the forfeiture
is punitive, and the test for the excesstveness of a punitive forfeiture involves
solely a proportionality determination.' (emphasis added)). Nor is the punitive
nature of forfeiture under section 5332(c) distinguishable from that of the
forfeiture in Bajakajian because the former is a civil in rem proceeding or is
predicated on a smuggling, rather than reporting, offense. See Austin, 509 U.S.
at 621-22 (holding that a modern statutory fine is a `fine' if it constitutes
punishment even in part regardless of whether the proceeding is in rem or in
personam (emphasis added)). The remedial purpose(s) of section 5332(c),
whatever they may be, does not detract from the conclusion that it constitutes
punishment at least in part. See id.

Unlike the gold platter in United States v. An Antique Platter of Gold, 184
F.3d 131, 140 (2d Cir. 1999), the currency at issue ts not `classic contraband,
an item imported into [or exported from] the United States in violation oflaw."
An Antique Platter of Gold involved false statements on customs forms
regarding a gold platter's value and country of origin, which affected the
imposition of customs duties and determination of whether the platter was
stolen. Id, at 135-37. The false statements violated section 545 of title 18 of the
United States Code, a customs law `traditionally viewed as non-punitive,' id.
at 140, and for which there is no innocent owner defense, id. at 138-39.
Currency is not subject to any customs duties and its transport from (or into)
the United States remains legal provided that the reporting requirements are
met. Furthermore, section 5332(c) is subject to an innocent owner defense
untike the statute at issue in An Antique Platter of Gold, confirming the
former's punitive nature.

The amount of civil forfeiture in this case is subject to review under the
Excessive Fines Clause, Whether complete forfeiture in this case is `excessive'

Case 4:07-cv-03367 Document9_ Filed in TXSD on 12/28/07 Page 7 of 10

is addressed tn Part V, infra."

In another case interpreting section 5332, United States of America v. One Hundred
and Twenty Thousand Light Hundred and Fifty Six Dollars, 394 F. Supp. 2d 687 (V1. 2005)
' we find it is in lockstep with $293,376. At page 691 the court stated the following:

"Assessment of civil forfeiture under section 5332(c} is predicated on the
commission of the crime of currency smuggling. See 31 U.S.C_A. 8
5332(c)(1) (Any property involved in a violation of subsection (a)... ."
(emphasis added)); see also United States v. $293,316, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
25611 at "10. In Wray's case, however, there was no violation of section
$332(a), While the claimant was indicted for violating section 5332(a}, a jury
of his peers acquitted him of this violation. This procedural stature ts unique.
Because this section was enacted in October 2001, there are very few cases
interpreting this statute and none that deal with whether someone acquitted
under 5332(a) is still subject to the civil forfeiture penalties in 5332 (c). I look
to interpretations of similar statutes for guidance.

The language of section 5532 (c) differs from the language of section 5317.
Section 5332 specifically requires proof oftwo elements: the claimant must (1)
act with the `intent to evade a currency reporting requirement' and (2)
`knowingly conceal |] more than $ 10,000 in currency.' The statutory words
of section 5317, on the other hand, only specify one element, namely, that the
claimant acted with "knowledge that he [was] transporting more than $ 10,000
out of or into the country." | therefore interpret section 5332 (c) as requiring
proof of both statutory elements, The only difference in proving the cnminal
violation of 5332 (a) and proving the civil forfeiture claim of 5332 (c) is the
government's burden of proof. A section 5332(a) violation requires proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas the government may establish a forfeiture
under section 5332(c)} by a mere preponderance of the evidence.

Section 5332(c) requires proof of two elements and the claimant has not
conceded either of those elements. The claimant only admitted at his criminal
trial that he carried the currency into the United States. Not only did he did not
concede at his criminal trial that he intended to evade the currency reporting,
he specitically denied that he had intended to evade the currency reporting
requirement. Nevertheless, the government has stated a viable claim for
forfeiture section 5317 (c) against the claimant's $ 120,856, again subject to

the Eighth Amendment restrictions."

Since the U.S. Attorney declined criminal prosecution of the claimant there 1s obviously no
violation of section 5332(a}). Without a violation of section 5332(a) there can be no civil
forfeiture under section 5332(c).

HW. THE ATTEMPT BY THE PLAINTIFF TO FORFEIT ALL OF THE
DEFENDANT CURRENCY IS IN VIOLATION OF THE EXCESSIVE FINES
CLAUSE OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION

Whether the attempt by the plaintiff to forfeit the full amount of the defendant

currency ts to be determined by United States v. Bajakajian, 118 S. Ct. 2028 (1998) which

 

has been codified at 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7983(g) and the facts of the case. Bajakajian pleaded guilty
to the failure to report his seized currency, He was fined $5,000 and three year's probation
under the Sentencing Guidelines and $15,000 was forfeited but not challenged by Bajakajian.
The Supreme Court found the full forfeiture of the seized $357,144 was excessive. His
offense was merely a reporting offense. The reporting violation was unrelated to any other
illegal activities such as drug dealing, money laundering or tax evasion. The court found that
where the fine viz. full forfeiture of the $375,144, is grossly disproportional to the gravity of
the offense, then it is excessive and in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

In the instant case criminal prosecution was declined. The plaintiff has not alleged
the defendant currency was derived from any illegal activity. Section 983(g) provides
Kioussis the opportunity fo petition this Court to determme whether the plaintiff's attempt
to forfeit all of the defendant currency is constitutionally excessive. "In making this
determination, the court shall compare the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense giving rise

to the forfeiture." 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7983(g)(1)-(2). "Ifthe court finds that the forfeiture is grossly
Case 4:07-cv-03367 Document9_ Filed in TXSD on 12/28/07 Page 9 of 10

disproportional to the offense it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as necessary to avoid
a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution." 18
USC. 0x00A7983(2)(4),

I. THE PULL PORPEPPURE OF THE DEFENDANT CURRENCY IS
DISPROPORTIONAL FO KIOUSSIS' REPORTING OFFENSE

Kioussis offense was solely a reporting offense. The violation was unrelated to any
other illegal activities. Kioussis does not fit into the class of persons for whom the statute
was principally designed: money launderers, tax evaders and drug dealers. The fatlure to
report the defendant currency only affected the government and it caused no loss to the
public fisc.

The Supreme Court in Bajakajian relied heavily on the Sentencing Guidelines to
determine proportionality. Although Bajakajian was prosecuted criminally, the court
concluded that an amount of forfeiture of $15,000 rather than the full $357,144 was
constitutionally permissible. The $15,000 that the court ordered forfeited is approximately
4% of the total seized. Further, $120,856, supra, the court relied on the Sentencing
Guidelines in reducing the fine to $7,500 or 6.2% of the total.

Even though Kioussis was not subject to criminal prosecution, a review of the
Sentencing Guidelines for a reporting violation indicates a Base Offense Level 6
[281.3(a\(2)]. Pursuant to 5EL.2 the maximum fine for level 6 is between $500 and $5,000.

Furthermore, the Customs mitigation guidelines, for currency seizures between $40,001 and

$70,000 requires a penalty of $5,000 with the possibility of mitigation factors, such as the
Case 4:07-cv-03367 Document9_ Filed in TXSD on 12/28/07 Page 10 of 10

factors in this case, reducing this amount by 30%. Using the 4% figure from Bajakajian the
maximum amount to be forfeited would be approximately $2,500.

WHEREFORE, Kioussis respectinily requests the Court to make a finding that the full
forfeiture of the defendant currency is disproportional to his offense and thus excessive and
in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause ofthe Eighth Amendment of the Constitution; and,
that, the forfeiture of the defendant currency be eliminated or, reduced to an amount not to
exceed $2,500.
