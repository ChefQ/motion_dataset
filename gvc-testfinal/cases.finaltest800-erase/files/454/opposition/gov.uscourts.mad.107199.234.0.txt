DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO PLANTIFFS’
MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE OR COORDINATE
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate or coordinate is purely speculative. Plaintiffs do not
identify any facts to support the assumption that this Court intends to “divest itself” of cases
currently on its docket. To the contrary, the Boston Globe reported on October 16, 2012, that
Your Honor stated that he “will maintain the cases he still has before him.”1 While Jani-King
hopes that the Court retains this case—and believes that doing so will serve judicial economy—
that decision rests in the Court’s discretion and likely involves considerations beyond the
knowledge of the parties. If the Court has decided to remove (or is considering removing) this

case from its docket, Plaintiffs’ motion should be given no weight, and the regular reassignment
practices of this District should be followed.
Plaintiffs’ request for consolidation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42 fails to meet the First
Circuit’s requirement that a motion to consolidate to involve common parties. Even if Plaintiffs
could make that fundamental factual showing, their motion to consolidate is years too late.
Plaintiffs’ counsel brought each of the three cases they now seek to consolidate and counsel
allowed each to move at its own pace without ever raising the issue of consolidation—until it
suited counsel’s litigation goals. Jani-King cannot find—nor have Plaintiffs cited—any cases that
supports consolidating under these circumstances. Plaintiffs’ request that the Court “coordinate”
the cases at issue suffers from the same infirmities. The request is too late, it serves only
Plaintiffs’ litigation goals, and it is unsupported by any case law with similar facts.
If this Court removes this case from its docket, it should do so according to the regular
reassignment practices in this District. Jani-King is entitled to have this case decided on its own
merits, overseen by a judge selected without regard for Plaintiffs’ current preferences.
ARGUMENT
I. This Court Is In The Best Position To Preside Over This Case.
Plaintiffs’ Motion is based on sheer speculation regarding the Court’s intentions, and it
presumes to tell the Court how its docket should be handled. To the extent the Court is
contemplating altering its present civil docket and is interested in the parties’ views regarding
such alterations, Defendants believe that this Court should retain this case. The Court has
presided over this case for several years and has overseen extensive motion practice, in the
process becoming well-versed in the legal and factual nuances at issue. Several issues in this case
have been developing over the past several years, including whether and when Plaintiffs’ class

2

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 234 Filed 12/26/12 Page 3 of 8

should be redefined, how damages discovery and remaining liability discovery should be
handled, how damages should be calculated, and how the individual contracts between Jani-King
and each class member should be treated in light of the Court’s ruling that its franchise owners
are employees. Jani-King’s motion to reconsider is also pending before the Court. This Court is
in the best position to oversee the resolution of these issues.
II. There Is No Basis For Consolidating The Cases At Issue.
A. The cases at issue do not have any common plaintiffs or defendants.
When considering whether to consolidate cases under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42, “[t]he threshold
issue is whether the two proceedings involve a common party and common issues of fact or
law.” Seguro de Servicio de Salud de Puerto Rico v. McAuto Sys. Group, Inc., 878 F.2d 5, 8 (1st
Cir. 1989) (emphasis in original). Here, Plaintiffs cannot meet the “common party” requirement
because the three cases Plaintiffs seek to consolidate do not have any overlapping plaintiffs or
defendants. The Jan Pro and Coverall cases involve completely different businesses who operate
distinct franchising systems with distinct franchise agreements, operating systems, and
franchisees. Plaintiffs all but concede this point in their brief during the lengthy discussion of the
“Skycap” cases, where they acknowledge that those cases were not consolidated due to “the
differing procedural postures of the cases, as well as the differing defendants.” Pls.’ Br. 2-3. This
case is no different.
B. Whatever common issues of law the cases present are outweighed by their
unique facts.
Even if Plaintiffs could meet the “common party” requirement, the costs of consolidation
would outweigh any benefits. This Court “has broad discretion in weighing the costs and benefits
of consolidation to decide whether that procedure is appropriate.” Gilliam v. Fidelity Mgmt. &
Research Co., 2005 WL 1288105 at * 1 (D. Mass. 2005). The three cases at issue involve

3

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 234 Filed 12/26/12 Page 4 of 8

allegations that three distinct cleaning commercial cleaning franchising companies have
misclassified their franchise owners as independent contractors. Each of the three franchisors at
issue employs a distinct franchising model, with substantive differences between the three.
Plaintiffs in all three cases signed unique franchise agreements. To resolve the legal questions at
issue in each case, the court must evaluate the factual circumstances unique to each franchise
system. Additionally, the three cases are all very advanced and have unique procedural
postures—a fact Plaintiffs acknowledge. Pls.’ Br. 6-9. This case has 233 docket entries, Coverall
has 538, and Jan-Pro has 158 entries. Plaintiffs describe the Coverall case as nearly concluded.
This case, however, is moving into the damages phase with ongoing challenges regarding
damages discovery, scope of liability and class definition. Consolidating this case with Coverall
and Jan-Pro will achieve few, if any, efficiencies as these issues are resolved in light of the
unique factual issues in this case.
Federal courts (including this one) have previously declined to consolidate cases in
similar circumstances. See Gilliam, 2005 WL 1288105 at *4 (consolidation not appropriate
where the “overlap in the factual evidence” between the actions was “relatively small”); In re
Airline “Age of Employee” Emp’t Prac. Litig., 483 F. Supp. 814, 816-17 (J.P.M.L. 1980)
(motion to transfer for purposes of centralizing cases denied where cases involved the
“[e]mployment practices of eight different airlines” and “the principal factual issues will be
different as to each airline”). The two Ninth Circuit cases Plaintiffs rely on to support their
argument that consolidation is appropriate here are readily distinguishable because they involve
common parties. See In re Adams Apple, Inc., 829 F.2d 1484 (9th Cir. 1987) (involving the
consolidation of several bankruptcy petitions filed by one debtor and his related companies);
Kowalski v. Mommy Gina Tuna Resources, 2008 WL 4753282 at *3 (D. Haw. 2008)

4

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 234 Filed 12/26/12 Page 5 of 8

(consolidating several cases brought by the same plaintiff against numerous defendants and
noting that the defendants “have proceeded in virtual lockstep in their litigation of the case to this
point—they have retained common counsel, and for the most part they have filed common
motions, conducted common discovery, and retained common experts”).
C. This Court has discretion to deny consolidation even if common issues of
law and fact exist.
Even if Plaintiffs could show common parties and common issues of law or fact, this case
is not suitable for consolidation. “In considering the costs and benefits of consolidation, it is
appropriate to consider and weigh the convenience or inconvenience to the parties, the judicial
economy, the savings in time, effort or expense and any confusion, delay or prejudice that might
result from consolidation.” Gilliam, 2005 WL 1288105 at * 1. Consolidation of these three
disparate cases will save little if any time or effort for the parties or the court given the different
procedural posture of the cases. Consolidation will result in delay for some litigants while factual
issues relevant in other cases are resolved. Consolidation is not appropriate where the overlap in
factual evidence is small. Id. at * 3. The different factual issues present in the three cases also
cannot help but lead to confusion for the ultimate factfinder. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, the
franchise system created by Jan-Pro is fundamentally different than the one used by Jani-King
and Coverall. Pls.’ Br. 5. See Liberty Lincoln Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Mktg. Corp., 149 F.R.D. 65,
81 (D. N.J. 1993) (“Where the evidence in one case is not relevant to the issues in the other,
consolidation would create a likelihood of prejudice by confusing the issues.”). Consolidating
this case with Jan-Pro or Coverall case will result in confusion about the details regarding how
the three franchise systems are structured and how the named plaintiffs and class members in
each case operated their franchises, details that are significant to each party’s defense. As this
Court has observed:

5

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 234 Filed 12/26/12 Page 6 of 8

Even if I were to find that the common-issue threshold had been crossed, I would still
find that consolidation is inappropriate because the benefits of consolidation are grossly
outweighed by its costs . . . The Boston Harbor case is already unwieldy enough,
involving far more issues than the one that affects the Towns. To add two more parties
and another complex set of issues would simply clutter an ongoing proceeding that
already has accumulated a voluminous record over a period of many years.
Town of Norfolk v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 134 F.R.D. 20, 22 (D. Mass. 1991). The same
reasoning applies here.
II. If This Case Is Reassigned, The Court Should Follow The Standard Procedures In
This District.
Plaintiffs’ arguments in support of their motion to “coordinate” should be disregarded.
Plaintiffs have allowed the three cases at issue to play out independently over several years
without ever raising the issue of “coordination” they now find so compelling. Plaintiffs’ sudden
appeal to judicial economy is nothing more than a veiled attempt to get this case assigned to the
judge of their choice. Plaintiffs have cited no cases that support granting such a request. If this
Court removes this case from its docket, it should do so according to the regular reassignment
practices in this District. Jani-King is entitled to have this case decided on its own merits,
overseen by a judge selected without regard for Plaintiffs’ preferences.
