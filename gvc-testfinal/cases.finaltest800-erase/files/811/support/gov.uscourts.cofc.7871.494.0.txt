MOTION OF PLAINTIFFS AMERICAN SAVINGS BANK, F.A. AND
NEW AMERICAN CAPITAL, INC. FOR LEAVE TO FILE SEPARATE POST-TRIAL
BRIEF RELATING TO DISTRIBUTION OF DAMAGES

Plaintiffs American Savings Bank, F.A. and New American Capital, Inc., by and through
their successor in interest JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., respectfully request leave to submit a
separate post-trial brief. The separate brief, which is hereby lodged as Exhibit A to this Motion,
does not address the merits of the underlying damages claims, which have been fully briefed by
Arnold & Porter on behalf of all plaintiffs. Rather, the separate brief is limited to the issue of the
distribution of any damages the Court may award.
As named plaintiffs in the case, American Savings and New American Capital have every
right to submit briefs on their own behalf. The plaintiffs in this case have been jointly
represented throughout the litigation by Arnold & Porter, which has submitted a merits brief on
behalf of all plaintiffs. That merits brief, however, did not address the crucial issue of which
plaintiff should be awarded which damages. Nor could it, because of the conflict of interests that
issue creates among the plaintiffs represented by Arnold & Porter. Therefore, it is appropriate

for American Savings and New American Capital to be heard on the question of distribution of
damages.
In the alternative, JPMorgan Chase, as the successor in interest to American Savings and
New American Capital, requests leave to file the brief as amicus curiae. When this Court denied
JPMorgan Chase’s prior motion to intervene, the Court indicated that if JPMorgan Chase “finds
a reason that [its] views may be important to the Court, the Court will liberally consider a brief
amicus brief, if that becomes something where they feel they can add a particular point or
emphasis to an issue.” Transcript of Feb. 6, 2009 hearing at 98.
The separate brief of American Savings and New American Capital is necessitated by the
fact that the several plaintiffs in this case no longer share a common interest in the proceeds of
any judgment. This is because in September 2008, the government seized Washington Mutual
Bank, which was the successor to American Savings Bank and New American Capital, and
placed it into receivership. The receiver (the FDIC) subsequently conveyed Washington Mutual
Bank’s assets, including its claims in this case, to JPMorgan Chase. As a result, and as explained
more fully in the brief, there are now two distinct real parties in interest in the case: JPMorgan
Chase, as successor in interest to American Savings Bank and New American Capital, and the
bankruptcy estate of Washington Mutual Bank’s former holding company, Washington Mutual
Inc., as successor in interest to plaintiffs New American Holdings, Inc. and Keystone Holdings,
Inc. Because damages paid to one will not be paid to the other, JPMorgan Chase and
Washington Mutual Inc. have divergent interests in the award of any judgment in this case. It is
thus no longer sufficient for the court to award damages to, or even make findings regarding,
“the plaintiffs” collectively.

In the event the Court awards any expectancy damages in this case -- whether by way of
lost profits, cost of replacement capital, or corresponding jury verdict damages -- the Court
should enter judgment specifically in favor of American Savings Bank (lost profits) or New
American Capital (cost of capital), as the plaintiffs entitled to those damages. Under black-letter
principles of corporate law, as confirmed repeatedly in other Winstar-related cases by this Court
and the Federal Circuit, “damages suffered by a corporation are recoverable by the corporation,
not by its shareholders.” Statesman Savings Holding Corp. v. United States, 41 Fed. Cl. 1, 16
(1998). See also, e.g., Castle v. United States, 48 Fed. Cl. 187, 199 (2000), aff’d in part, vacated
and rev’d in part on other grounds, 301 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (“The lost profits claim
belongs to the bank.”); Hometown Financial, Inc. v. United States, 56 Fed. Cl. 477, 486 (2003),
aff’d, 409 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (“a cause of action arising from an injury to a corporation
belongs solely to the corporation”). See generally American Capital Corp. v. United States, 472
F.3d 859, 866-67 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Caroline Hunt Trust Estate v. United States, 470 F.3d 1044,
1053-54 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Southern California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. United States, 422
F.3d 1319, 1331-32 (Fed. Cir. 2005). This case law is more fully discussed in the separate brief
submitted herewith.
In such circumstances it is improper to award judgment to “the plaintiffs” collectively.
“[W]here the rights of the parties and the relief to which they are entitled are different, the
judgment may not be joint but should be several.” A.C. Freeman, A Treatise of the Law of
Judgments § 100 (5th ed. 1993). “Thus, a joint recovery on separate, several, and independent
causes of action in favor of separate plaintiffs is improper, and in such case a judgment which
does not preserve the separate rights of each in the total recovery is illegal.” 49 C.J.S. Judgments
§ 39 (2009).

It is also not sufficient to defer resolution of this issue to the Washington Mutual, Inc.
bankruptcy court, or some other court. Any such deferral will necessarily result in delay in
receipt of the damages award. This court’s award of $55 million in damages for breach of the
Note Forbearance was paid into the bankruptcy court in March 2009, but that court has yet to
determine who should receive that award, nor has it issued any schedule for doing so.
Alternatively, in the event this court determines not to award damages to a specific
plaintiff, we respectfully request that the Court at least make specific findings of fact and
conclusions of law as to which plaintiff incurred which damages, so that another court may
subsequently be able to distribute damages on an informed basis. No other court will ever have
this court’s familiarity with the parties, the facts and theories underlying the damages claims, and
the governing law that has developed in dozens of Winstar-related cases. Other courts will
inevitably look to this Court’s findings for guidance. It is therefore important that this Court
make specific findings that those other courts may refer to.
For these reasons, plaintiffs American Savings Bank and New American Capital, by and
through JPMorgan Chase Bank, respectfully request leave to file the attached brief.
Respectfully submitted,

Dated: September 24, 2009
