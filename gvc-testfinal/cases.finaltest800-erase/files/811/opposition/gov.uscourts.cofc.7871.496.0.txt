No. 92-872C

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO
NON-PARTY CHASE’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A POST-TRIAL BRIEF

JP Morgan Chase (“Chase”), purporting to be the “successor in interest” to American
Savings Bank, F.A. (“ASB”) and New American Capital, Inc. (“NACI”), seeks leave to file a
“separate post-trial brief.” Chase did not —indeed, could not — participate in the nowcompleted underlying trial because this Court denied Chase’s pretrial motion to intervene. Chase
now asserts as the basis for filing a post-trial brief the same arguments the Court rejected back in
February, but Chase gives no reason for the Court to revisit its decision. The Court should deny
Chase’s motion on that basis alone. Even if the Court were to entertain the substance of the
motion, Chase’s arguments remain unavailing.
The Court has already considered and rejected Chase’s attempt to insert itself into this
action. See Order (Feb. 9, 2009). Even a cursory comparison of Chase’s earlier motion to
intervene with its present motion to submit a brief demonstrates that Chase’s current motion
merely rehashes arguments upon which the Court has already ruled. In December, Chase argued

that “as successor in interest to” ASB and NACI,1 Chase held the “right to certain damage[s] . . .
namely, the cost-of-replacement capital damages . . . , the lost-profit damages . . . , and the
related ‘jury verdict’ damages.” Chase Mot. to Intervene (Dec. 24, 2008) ¶ 7, at 2-3. Now,
likewise, Chase argues that “any expectancy damages in this case — whether . . . lost profits,
cost of replacement capital, or corresponding jury verdict damages” should be awarded to
Chase’s purported predecessors ASB or NACI. Chase Mot. for Leave to File Separate Post-Trial
Brief (Sept. 24, 2009) at 3. In January, Chase argued that “[t]he Delaware bankruptcy court”
overseeing the Washington Mutual, Inc. proceedings “is not the appropriate forum to resolve
disputes over the apportionment of damages in this case.” Chase Reply in Support of Mot. to
Intervene (Jan. 23, 2009) at 6. Now, likewise, Chase argues that “[i]t . . . is not sufficient to
defer resolution of [the damages-allocation] issue to the Washington Mutual, Inc., bankruptcy
court, or some other court.” Chase Mot. for Leave to File Separate Post-Trial Brief (Sept. 24,
2009) at 4.
The Court properly rejected those arguments last winter, and there is no reason to revisit
them now. Indeed, the parties’ experience with the Note judgment — which was paid into the
WMI bankruptcy estate and about which we have heard no complaint — demonstrates that
Chase’s purported concerns lack any substantial foundation.
As we pointed out last winter, ASB and NACI — the entities to whose interests Chase
claims to have succeeded — are already plaintiffs in this case, represented by Arnold & Porter
LLP. As Chase acknowledges, “[t]he plaintiffs in this case have been jointly represented
throughout the litigation by Arnold & Porter.” Chase Mot. for Leave to File Separate Post-Trial

Chase also claims to have succeeded to the interests of New American Capital Holdings, Inc.

Brief (Sept. 24, 2009) at 1. Chase even admits that Arnold & Porter, “on behalf of all plaintiffs,”
has “fully briefed” the “merits of the . . . damages claims” presented at trial. Id. Thus, ASB and
NACI have already filed a post-trial brief. Having filed one brief, those parties should not be
granted leave to file another.
In addition, and as we also noted last winter, ASB and NACI agreed long ago that they
would stand aside and allow other plaintiffs to control this litigation. Specifically, in 1996 ASB,
NACI, and all other plaintiffs agreed — in a contract this Court has already reviewed in relevant
part and found “pretty clear,” Hrg. Tr. (Feb. 6, 2009) at 98 — that a jointly established “litigation
committee” containing members appointed by WMI and Keystone Holdings Partners, Inc. (but
not ASB or NACI) would “have the exclusive right” to direct and control the prosecution this
action. Merger Agreement (July 21, 1996) ¶ 2.3(e)(i), at 15 (filed with the Court on Dec. 5, 2008
at Dkt. No. 365). The contract specifies that the litigation committee — which selected Arnold
& Porter as the attorney for all plaintiffs and directed Arnold & Porter to pursue the litigation on
behalf of all plaintiffs jointly, see id. ¶ 2.3(e)(ii), at 15 — “shall have no duty to the WM Entities
[which include the successors to ASB and NACI2] to consider the interest any of such WM
Entities may have in an early termination or resolution of the Case.” Id. ¶ 2.3(e)(iii), at 16
(emphasis added).
Thus, Chase’s assertion that ASB and NACI “have every right to submit briefs on their
own behalf” is simply wrong. See Chase Mot. for Leave to File Separate Post-Trial Brief (Sept.
24, 2009) at 1. ASB and NACI agreed in 1996 that Arnold & Porter would prosecute this case
according to the direction of a litigation committee. ASB and NACI agreed in 1996 that the
committee would have “no duty” to consider the effect, if any, its instructions might have on

ASB’s and NACI’s “interest” in the “resolution of the Case.” As Chase is no doubt aware,
absent a contrary arrangement the successor in interest to a corporation succeeds to the
corporation’s obligations as well as to its rights. See, e.g., Oxxford Clothes XX, Inc. v. Expeditors
Int’l, Inc., 127 F.3d 574 (7th Cir. 1997) (Posner, J.) (stating general rule that a corporation that
purchases all of the assets and liabilities of another corporation assumes its predecessor’s contractual
obligations); Fifth Third Bank v. United States,55 Fed. Cl. 372, 377 (2003) (corporate successors
remain in privity of contract with their predecessors’ contract counterparties). Chase cannot don the

mantle of ASB and NACI without also accepting the bargain those parties struck in 1996, the
clear terms of which preclude ASB and NACI — or Chase, as their purported successor — from
filing separate briefs here.
The allocation among the plaintiffs of any judgment is a matter for the plaintiffs to settle
among themselves, consistent with the rights and duties to which they all agreed in 1996. To the
extent any dispute should arise among the plaintiffs, or any plaintiff should breach its duties
under the 1996 agreement, such matters would concern neither the United States nor this Court,
and should not be presented in this forum.
CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny non-party Chase’s motion for leave
to file a separate post-trial brief on behalf of ASB and NACI.
