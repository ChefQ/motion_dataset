CONCISE STATEMENT OF FACTS

On and before May 29, 2008, plaintiff was a spousal beneficiary under defendant,
Trader Joe's Company, Retirement Plan in the name of her then-husband, Timothy
Dougherty. At the aforesaid time, the said account contained $173,980.00 in available
funds. During this time, the account was being serviced and/or administered by
Defendant, CRMC. An agreement exists between Trader Joe's Company and CRMC,
which agreement is annexed to the movant's Motion to Dismiss hereto as Exhibit B.

That said agreement provided that CRMC, as the "Service Provider' agrees to
"perform the recordkeeping and administrative services specified in the attached
Exhibit A", and also indicates that "the Service Provider's responsibilities shail be
limited to those specifically listed in Exhibits A and B".

These services included, inter alia, "preparation of certified copy of the trust
statement", "processing participant withdrawals at the employer's direction, including
applicable federal withholding and mandatory state withholding", "preparation of Form
1099R, and withholding tax remittance and reporting", "preparation and maintenance
of participant loan documents and processing of loan distribution', "processing name,
address and other indicative data changes submitted by the employer', "maintenance
of amounts eligible for participant loans and/or hardship withdrawals", "maintaining
beneficiary information",

On or about May 29, 2008, Defendant, CRMC, and/or one or more of the other
named defendants, distributed the entire value of the aforesaid account to Timothy
Dougherty based upon his submission of a Distribution Request which indicated,

falsely, that he was unmarried. Defendant, CRMC, was, or should have been, aware

that a prior submission of Timothy Dougherty had indicated that he was married.
Case 2:10-cv-01425-KSH -PS Document 26 Filed 06/08/10 Page 5 of 13

Defendani, CRMC, prepared and provided the withdrawal forms to Timothy
Dougherty, on American Funds letterhead, which provide details and instructions on
the distribution including, inter alia, the proviso that if the participant is married, the
distribution must be by Qualified Joint Survivor Annuity (""QJSA") unless spousal
notarized consent is obtained.

Plaintiff was unaware of the subject distribution for more than 15 months until on or

about July 8, 2009 during a telephone conversation with Trader Joe's.

POINT ONE: DEFENDANT CRMC HAS NOT MET THE STANDARDS
REQUIRED TO PREVAIL ON A 12 (b)}(6) MOTION

The purpose of a motion under Federal Rule 12 (b)(6) is to test the formal
sufficiency of the statement of the claim for relief in the Complaint. Rutman Wine
Company v. E.& J. Gallo Winery, 8929 F. 2d. 729, 738 (9"" Circuit, 1987). Fora
defendant to prevail on a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule 12 (b}6), it must
appear beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim
which would entitie him to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957),
Cervantes v. City of San Diego, 5 F. 3d. 1273, 1274 (9" Circuit. 1993) [emphasis
added]. It is not a procedure for resolving a contest about the facts or the merits of the
case. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974).

In the case at bar, Defendant, CRMC, alleges that it is not a proper party to the
litigation because it is not a "fiduciary" as contemplated by ERISA. 29 U.S.C. section
1002 (21}(A) provides, in pertinent part, that "a person is a fiduciary with respect to a
plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control
respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting
management or disposition of its assets...or (ili) he has any discretionary authority or
discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan" [emphasis added].

The Agreement annexed to the movant's motion as Exhibit B provides an overview
of the obligations and requirements of CRMC in its position with regard to the Plan at
issue.

At Exhibit A of that Agreement (page 6 of 9), Defendant CRMC agreed to provide
the following: "preparation of certified copy of the trust statement', "processing
participant withdrawals at the employer's direction, including applicable federal

3
Case 2:10-cv-01425-KSH -PS Document 26 Filed 06/08/10 Page 7 of 13

withholding and mandatory state withholding", "preparation of Form 1099R, and
withholding tax remittance and reporting", "preparation and maintenance of participant
loan documents and processing of loan distribution", "processing name, address and
other indicative data changes submitted by the employer', "maintenance of amounts
eligible for participant loans and/or hardship withdrawals", "maintaining beneficiary
information". In addition, as previously indicated, the forms completed by Timothy
Dougherty were prepared by Defendant CRMC under the moniker "American Funds'.
On information and belief, the actual transmission of funds was made by Defendant
CRMC to Timothy Dougherty.

No discovery has been exchanged to date between the parties save the electronic
transmission between counsel of the Plan Documents and the Service Agreement at
issue as to CRMC.

It seems axiomatic that many of the tasks detailed above involve discretion on the
part of CRMC and its agents, servants and/or employees. By way of example, CRMC
undertook to "process name, address and other indicative data". Presumably, this
would include maintaining data on the marital status of plan participants. Yet, nowhere
in the agreement does the Plan dictate the manner and means by which this data is to
be collected, preserved or maintained by CRMC. Since the Plan documents clearly
provide that in the event that a married participant seeks an "Optional Form of Benefit"'

the participant's spouse is required to sign the documents, whether or not the

 

' See page 44 of the Trader Joe's Retirement Plan, annexed as an Exhibit to
Movant Trader Joe's Motion to Dismiss, viz, "The election must be in writing,
must clearly indicate that the participant is electing to receive his Plan Benefit
under the Plan in a form other than the normal form, must indicate the form of
benefit the Participant is selecting and must be signed by the Participant and/or
the Participant's spouse, if any."
Case 2:10-cv-01425-KSH -PS Document 26 Filed 06/08/10 Page 8 of 13

participant is married would appear to be a crucial piece of evidence . Since the
Agreement at issue does not specify the manner and means by which this information
is to be maintained, it is obvious that CRMC exercised "authority or control respecting
... disposition of its [The Plan's] assets'. The method by which CRMC maintained the
participant data, a discretionary activity in the context herein, permitted the wrongful
distribution of the entirety of Timothy Dougherty's plan assets to the exclusion of his
wife. Had CRMC chosen to set up its data collection system in a thorough and detailed
fashion, it would have easily determined that prior submissions of Dougherty,
presumably, indicated that he was married; that no subsequent divorce Order was on
file; and that something was amiss when Dougherty, at distribution, claimed that he
was single.

similarly, CRMC's obligation to "process participant withdrawals" of necessity,
required the exercise of discretion on the part of CRMC. Since CRMC prepared the
withdrawal forms used by Dougherty and, presumably, all plan participants, it again
seems clear that in the event that the forms were not completed properly or in their
entirety, distribution would have been withheld or denied by CRMC. Such a withholding
or denial, under any definition, would constitute control of the distribution of Plan
assets.

Despite CRMC's protestations to the contrary, it seems clear on its face that the
Agreement at issue, which sets forth the duties of CRMC vis-a-vis the Plan herein,
vested CRMC with discretion and constituted the exercise of some degree of authority
on the distribution of the plan assets. At the very least, proper discovery is necessary
to ascertain the details of the establishment and maintenance of the participant data at

issue.
Case 2:10-cv-01425-KSH -PS Document 26 Filed 06/08/10 Page 9 of 13

In its Memorandum of Law, Defendant cites In re Mushroom Transp. Co., Inc. ,
382 F. 3d. 325 (3 Circuit, 2004), in support of the proposition that "mechanical,
administrative responsibilities are insufficient to create fiduciary status." It should be
noted that the "mechanical, administrative responsibilities" being commented upon in
the cited case were "retaining the assets and keeping a record of their value" Id at 347.

Defendant, herein, did far more as detailed above and as required by the subject

Agreement.

In Board of Trustees of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen Local 6 of New
Jersey Welfare Fund v. Wettlin Associates, Inc. , 237 F. 3d. 270 (30x2122 Circuit, 2001),
an entity which received contributions from employers and awarded benefits to
participants pursuant to an "administrative agreement" with the trustees of the union
plan, moved on a 72 (b)(6) motion for dismissal. While the dismissal was granted by

the District Court, it was reversed by the Court of Appeals. The Court wrote

"[w]e are inclined to agree that ERISA does not consider as a fiduciary an entity
such as a bank when it does no more than receive deposits from a benefit fund
on which the fund can draw checks. The allegations in the amended Complaint,
however, do not describe Wettlin's role as so circumscribed. Rather, the
amended Complaint aileges that the Board delegated to defendant `the day to
day responsibility to control, manage, hold, safeguard and account for the
Fund's assets and income. Moreover, the contract provides that Wettlin is to
`receive request for benefits from employees and take appropriate action
therein". Id at 274

The controversy herein is more akin to the scenario present in Wettlin than it is to
the scenario present in the Mushroom Transportation case cited by Defendant.
Since the nature and extent of the contractual duties undertaken and carried out by

CRMC are critical to a proper determination of whether it exercised discretion sufficient
Case 2:10-cv-01425-KSH -PS Document 26 Filed 06/08/10 Page 10 of 13

to constitute fiduciary status, discovery is warranted, necessary and indispensable. As
such, the matter is not ripe for a judgment on the pleadings and the motion of

Defendant, CRMC must be denied at this juncture.

AS TO DEFENDANTS, TRADER JOE'S AND PLAN COMMITTEE:

POINT ONE: PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO RECOVER UNDER
29 USCA 1132 (a}(1)(B)

29 U.S.C. 1132 (a)(1)(B), provides that "A civil action may be brought by a
participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to
enforce his rights under the terms of the plan or to clarify his rights to future benefits
under the terms of the plan."

In the case at bar, since plaintiff seeks to recover benefits due to her under the
terms of the plan', she can unequivocally recover under 29 U.S.C. 1132 {a)(1)(B) for
the losses she has suffered and the benefits which she seeks. See Massachussetts
Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 (1985).

POINT TWO: THE ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES OF THE PLAN
WERE NEVER TRIGGERED

The administrative remedies of the subject Plan were never triggered in the case at
bar. Accordingly, Plaintiff was not required to utilize and/or exhaust the same.

The Plan's administrative remedies are outlined at pages 60 through 63 of the Plan
attached to Movant's Memorandum of Law.

A review of Section 13.1 (a) reveals that the remedies are triggered once the

claimant has made a written application for benefits under the Plan and has received
