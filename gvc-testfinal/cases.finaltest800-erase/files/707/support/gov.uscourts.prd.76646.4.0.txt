Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 2 of 25

On July 7, 2008, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Petitioner's sentence and
conviction. See United States v. Ofray-Campos, 2008 WL2640007 (C.A. 1 (Puerto Rico)). On
November 10, 2008, Petitioner's request for writ of certiorari was denied by the United States
Supreme Court. See Ofray-Campos v. United States, Docket Number 08-6771.

This timely petition requesting Petitioner's conviction be vacated follows.

ARGUMENT

I. THE CONVICTION OF MR. OFRAY-CAMPSO IS VIOLATIVE OF HIS SIXTH
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL

1} The Performance of Counsel for Mr. Ofray-Campos Fell Below an Objective
Standard of Reasonableness During the Pre-Trial Trial and Appellate Phases

a. Standard Review - ineffectiveness

In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984), the Supreme
Court established a two prong test to govern ineffective assistance of counsel claims. To obtain
reversal of a conviction or to vacate a sentence based on ineffective assistance of counsel the
defendant must show: (1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's objectively
unreasonable performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different. fd. 466 U.S. at
688-689; Williams v. Taylor, 120 $.Ct. 1495, 1512-16; 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).

The Court stated that, "judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential"
and added that "a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the
wide range of reasonable professional assistance". Jd The Court clarified that this reference to
"highly deferential scrutiny" referred only to the first or performance prong of the test and meant

that,

""., the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged
action `might be considered sound trial strategy.'"

Id. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 689-691
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 3 of 25

The Supreme Court noted that,

"a single, serious error may support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel."
Id, Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. at 384.

The Court added that this "single serious error" could cause counsel's performance to fall
"below the level of reasonable professional assistance", even where, "counsel's performance at trial
was "generally creditable enough", and even where counsel had made "vigorous cross-examination,
attempts to discredit witnesses, and [an] effort to establish a different version of the facts." Jd. 477

US. at 386.

"Viewing counsel's failure to conduct any discovery from his perspective at the time he decided

to forego that stage of pretrial preparation and applying a `heavy measure of deference', ibid., to
his judgment, we find counsel's decision unreasonable, that is, contrary to prevailing
professional norms. The justification Morrison's attorney offered for his omission betray a
startling ignorance of the law--or a weak attempt to shift blame for inadequate preparation.
`Counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that
makes particular investigations unnecessary.' /d. Respondent's lawyer neither investigated, nor
made a reasonable decision not to investigate the State's case through discovery."

id. Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. at 385.

If the record does not "conclusively" demonstrate "strategic reasons" for counsel's failures, the
district court entertaining a motion under 28 USC 0x00A7 2255 must hold an evidentiary hearing. A
subsequent affidavit from counsel will not suffice to establish a trial strategy, nor absolve the district
court from the requirement of holding an evidentiary hearing. '

b. Standard Review - Prejudice Prong
In writing for the majority in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104

S.Ct. 2052 (1984), Justice O'Connor stated the general rule that, actual ineffectiveness claims

 

1 See Smith v. McCormick, 914 F.2d 1153, 1170 (9% Cir. 1990) and United Siates v.

Giardino, 797 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1986) and Lindhorst v. United States, 585 F.2d
361, 365 (8 Cir. 1978).
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 4 of 25

alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are subject to a general requirement that the defendant

affirmatively prove -_ prejudice."
Id. 466 U.S. at 693, 80 L.Ed.2d at 697.

More specifically, Justice O'Connor set forth the now well known statement of the test for
"prejudice" in claims of actual ineffectiveness of counsel as:

"The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable
probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."

Id, 466 US. at 695, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.
The Court further specifically rejected the application of the "actual prejudice" standard of United

States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 71 L.Ed.2d 816, 102 S.Ct. 1584 (1982), to claims of ineffective

assistance of counsel, with the following admonishment:

"The principles governing ineffectiveness claims should apply in federal collateral proceedings
as they do on direct appeal or in motions for a new trial. As indicated by the `cause and
prejudice' test for overcoming procedural waivers of claims of error, the presumption that a
criminal judgment is final is at its strongest in collateral attacks on that judgment. See United
States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 162-169, 71 L.Ed.2d 816, 102 S.Ct. 1558 (1982). An
ineffectiveness claim, however, as our articulation of the standards that govern decision of
such claims makes clear, is an attack on the fundamental fairness of the proceedings whose
result is challenged. Since fundamental fairness is the central concern of the writ of habeas
corpus, see id, at 126, no special standards ought to apply to ineffectiveness claims made in

habeas proceedings."

Id. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697-98, 80 L.Ed.2d at 700.

The Court hearing an ineffectiveness claim should consider the totality of the factors which
guided the decision maker in the challenged proceeding, then try to determine which factors were or
were not "affected" by counsel's errors. Id. Strickland vy. Washington, 466 U.S. at 696, 80 L.Ed2d at
699.

Based on the foregoing facts and law, Mr. Ofray-Campos has affirmatively pleaded "prejudice"

in his case within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct.

2052 (1984) and United Stases v. Glover, 121 S.Ct. 692 (2001); Williams v. Taylor, 120 S.Ct. 1495,
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 5 of 25

1512-16, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (4-18-00); Freeman v. Lane, 962 F.2d 1252 (7 Cir. 1992) and Orazio v.

Dugger, 876 F.2d 1508, 1513-14 (110x2122 Cir. 1989).

COUNSEL RENDERED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE IN VIOLATION OF
PETITIONER'S SIXTH AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WHEN HE FAILED
TO ADVISE PETITIONER OF THE RELEVANT PORTIONS OF THE FEDERAL
SENTENCING GUIDELINES AND HOW THE GUIDELINES WOULD AFFECT HIS
OVERALL SENTENCE THUS RENDERING PETITIONER'S DECISION TO PROCEED
TO TRIAL INVOLUNTARY

Petitioner presents that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in violation of his Sixth
Amendment night to effective assistance of counsel when his attorney during the pre-trial failed to
explain to Petitioner the relevant conduct portions of the guidelines, how the sentence could have
been enhanced by the mere allegation that Petitioner possessed a firearm or that he could be
enhanced for be some sort of leader organizer if convicted. There was no explanation of the
acceptance of responsibility sections of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and how the same would
be used to calculate his final sentence and mitigate his sentence by pleading guilty. Petitioner
presents that at no time during the pre-irial preparation did counsel ever take the opportunity to
explain to Petitioner how his sentence would be calculated if he proceeded to trial versus pleading
guilty. There was never any explanation of the balance of pleading guilty versus proceeding to trial.

Counsel failed to explain to Petitioner how the government would use the testimony of the
government informants and would attribute drug quantities for sentencing purposes that were not
alleged in the indictment. Petitioner was always under the impression that he would held
accountable only for the alleged quantities listed in the indictment and based on those assurances,
made an umnformed decision to proceed to trial. Basically, he was under the position that he would
be sentenced under those alleged quantities if he proceeded to trial and had no knowledge or idea that

the sentences would be calculated via the sentencing guidelines. It was not until after the preparation

of the PSI Report and the sentence was completed, that reality was presented.
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 6 of 25

Petitioner steadfastly presents that had he known how the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in the
most basic of forms would be used to calculate his sentence, how the court could enhance his
sentence based on managerial roles and roles for possession of firearms and so forth, he would have
not proceeded to trial, would have entered into a plea agreement with the government and would
have mitigated his overall sentence via the acceptance of responsibility sentence reductions. At no
point during the pre-trial preparation did counsel ever take the opportunity to advise petitioner of the
Sentencing Guidelines 0x00A7 3E1.1 which would lower Petitioner's sentence substantially should he have
decided to accept a government offer. (See Appendix A - Swom Affidavit)

Tn order to prevail on [an ineffective counsel argument], the defendant must show that his
attorney made "errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed ... by the
Sixth Amendment" and that "counsel's" errors were prejudicial; that is, "so serious as to deprive the
defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at
2064. The court pointed out that because of the distorting effect of hindsight, a reviewing court must
exercise care in determining whether counsel's actions fall below an objective standard of
reasonableness. Petitioner has a right to competent counsel during the critical stages of the criminal
process. See Caruso v. Zelinsky, 689 F.2d 435 (3" Cir. 1982). Moreover, petitioner "has the right to
make a reasonably informed decision whether to accept a plea offer." United States v. Day, 969 F.2d
39, 43 (30x2122 Cir.1992) (citing Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203
(1985)). Counsel's incompetent advice, violated the petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
See McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970).

As an analogy, in United States v, McCoy, 215 F.3d 102 (D.C. Cir, 2000) counsel advised his
client of an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, McCoy argued that his
plea was unconstitutional because it was based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The District of
Colombia agreed; it found that McCoy's guilty plea had not been knowingly and voluntarily made.

fd. Following this sare analogy, Petitioner provides that his decision to proceed to trial was based
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 7 of 25

on his attorney's gross misadvise of the application of the relevant conduct of the sentencing
guidelines, The McCoy Court noted that "[W hile not every error made in calculating an applying |
the guidelines would constitute deficient performance under Strickland, the Court emphasized that
`familiarity with the structure and basic content of the Guidelines, had become a necessity for
counsel who seek to give effective representation.'" /d. at 508

The Court further found that the prejudice prong of Strickland test was satisfied, in that the
difference between the sentencing ranges was so significant that there was a reasonable probability
that if McCoy had been given correct information he would not have entered a guilty plea. Id?
Counsel's failure to familiarize himself with the relevant portions of the Sentencing Guidelines
causes his actions to fall below a reasonable standard of performance because a "[c]riminal defense
attorneys practicing in the federal courts are expected to keep abreast of issues that affect his client's
case." Id. United State v. Loughery, 908 F.2d 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1990)

In Petitioner's cause, he must only show that there is a "reasonable probability" that the results
of his decision to proceed to trial would have been different. fd. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,
386, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) and based on the difference in sentencing guideline
ranges, there could be no doubt that a different outcome is evident.

Presently Petitioner is sentenced under a guideline 34 with a Category I for a sentence of 188-
235 months. Petitioner was sentenced to 200 months incarceration. Had counsel properly taken the

time to advise Petitioner how the relevant conduct portions of the sentencing guidelines applied to his

 

2 Although Petitioner proceeded to trial based on his counsel's lack information of
the relevant conduct portions of the Sentencing Guidelines, the same analogy as
that presented by the McCoy Court can be reached in Petitioner's case. Had it not
been for the lack of information received by his trial attorney, Petitioner would have
accepted a plea of guilt and mitigated his sentence.
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 8 of 25

case Petitioner would have accepted a plea of guilty and would have ultimately resulted in a
guideline range of 31 with an exposure to as little of 108 months incarceration.*

Based on the record and the files before this Court, there is a reasonable probability that
counsel's actions have reached a level of ineffectiveness as enumerated in Strickland. Furthermore,
there could be no strategic reason why counsel can justify his failure to explain the implications of
the guidelines relevant conduct section to Petitioner. See United States v. Acklen, 47 F.3d 739, 743-
44 (5 Cir. 1995) (remanding for evidentiary hearing where there was nothing in record to indicate
counsel's failures were attributable to strategic choice among all plausible alternatives available for
defense); United States v. Dawson, 857 F.2d 923, 929 (3 Cir. 1988)(absent evidence in the record,
"this court will not speculate on trial counsel's motives"), Nichols v. United States, 75 F.3d 1137 (7
Cir. 1996) (same).

Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully prays this Honorable Court determine that counsel's actions
have reached the level of ineffectiveness and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the merits raised

herein.

COUNSEL RENDERD IN EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE WHEN HE FAILED TO
REPRESENT PETITONER ALL STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS DURING THE TRIAL

Petitioner presents that counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to be present at all
stages of the proceedings against Petitioner especially when presenting incriminating testimony
involving Petitioner was presented to the jury.

In the issue in question, the testimony of Agent Rivera was being presented to the jury regarding
the hierarchy of the drug points and the code words used by all the members of the conspiracy. As

the testimony proceeded, Agent Rivera was questioned whether he could identify Petitioner and

 

3 This calculation is based on the pretence that Petitioner would have received his
acceptance of responsibility with a minimum mandatory of 120 months.
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 9 of 25

select him from the list of defendant's that were on trial. Agent Rivera was able to identify
Petitioner as "Eric el Tapicero" and was able to point to Petitioner so the Jury could identify him.

At that stage after the Agent was testifying for approximately 30 minutes, it was discovered that
Petitioner's attorney was not present and that Petitioner was unrepresented during this critical portion
of the trial, At a side bar the following colloquy was presented:

Mr. Dolz: We just realized that since Peter Diaz is not here there is one defendant without a
lawyer.

Id, (Transcript August 7, 2003 pg. 223)
The Government attempted to suggest that Mr. Blanco was representing Petitioner, however, the
record of this case established otherwise.
Ms Feldman: Mr. Blanco
The Court: Wait a minute. Yes, he does. Yes, Mr. Diaz yesterday introduced his two clients to
the jury represented himself which he was very proud to do it and by Mr. Jose Blanco, professor

and lawyer, Jose Blanco and Mr. Marcos De La Villa. So, he is represented by counsel here
according to Mr. Diaz.

Mr. Morales: You Honor, J queried Mr. Blanco and he told me that he only represents one of
those two persons. That is why we decided to come forward.

The Court: That is not what Mr. Diaz said yesterday.

Mr. Blanco: / filed a motion representing Mr. Clavel. I can at this moment _assume_the
representation of Mr. Ofray Campos as well.

fd. (Transcript August 7, 2003 pg. 223)

At the stage when all the incriminating evidence against Petitioner was being offered along with
the direct identification of Petitioner to the jury, Petitioner's constitutional right to be represented by
counsel at all stages of the proceedings were violated. It was not until Attorney Blanco assumed the
representation of Petitioner, there was no representation of Petitioner and no attorney guarding
Petitioner's rights. It was not until 25 minutes after the testimony against Petitioner had begun that
Mr. Blanco, from that "moment assumefd] the responsibility of Mr. Ofray Campos as well." Id.

(Transcript August 7, 2003 pg. 223) The mere fact that the testimony was explicitly against
Case 3:09-cv-02190-PG Document4 Filed 01/13/2010 Page 10 of 25

Petitioner, warrants substantial prejudice, although none is required. In fact, a careful reading of the
Supreme Court's opinions in Strickland and United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039,
80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), raises substantial doubt as to whether the Court intended to require a
defendant to prove prejudice in Sixth Amendment cases such as this one, where the ineffectiveness at
issue is the absence of counsel during a critical stage of the defendant' trial. In Strickland, for
example, the Court discussed and distinguished various "Sixth Amendment contexts" in which
prejudice to the defendant is legally presumed. See 104 S.Ct. at 2067; Dillon v. Duckworth, 751 F.2d
895, 898 n. 2 (7" Cir. 1984). The latter situations include cases of "state interference with counsel's
assistance," and, most pertinently, cases involving "[a]|ctual or constructive denial of the assistance of
counsel altogether." Strickland, 104 S.Ct. at 2067. Relying in part on the analysis in Cronic that is
discussed below, the Court in Strickland distinguished these latter circumstances on the grounds that
prejudice to the defendant "is so likely that case by case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost,"
and that they "involve impairments of the Sixth Amendment right that are easy to identify and, for
that reason and because the prosecution is directly responsible, easy for the government to
prevent." Jd. With respect to the kinds of errors by defense counsel that would normally form a basis
for an ineffective assistance claim, on the other hand, the "government is not responsible for, and
hence not able to prevent" them, they "come in an infinite variety and are as likely to be utterly
harmless in a particular case as they are to be prejudicial," and they cannot "be defined with
sufficient precision to inform defense attorneys correctly just what conduct to avoid." Jd.

The Court elaborated further on the role of prejudice in resolving various kinds of Sixth
Amendment claims in United States v. Cronic, 104 S.Ct. at 2046-48, which was decided on the same
day as Strickland. The opinion in Cronic provides that of the various "circumstances that are so
likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is

unjustified," the "[mlJost obvious ... is the complete denial of counsel." Jd. at 2047.
