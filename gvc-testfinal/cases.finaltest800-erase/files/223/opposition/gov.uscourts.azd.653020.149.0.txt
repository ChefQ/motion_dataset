DEFENDANT-INTERVENORS GRAND CANYON TRUST ET AL.’S
OPPOSITION TO NORTHWEST MINING ASSOCIATION ET AL.’S MOTION
FOR FINAL JUDGMENT ON ITS SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF

8

In this case, plaintiffs Northwest Mining Association (NWMA) and National

9

Mining Association et al. (NMA) filed separate complaints seeking to overturn the

10

Department of the Interior’s (DOI’s) January 2012 decision to place off limits to new

11

mining claims one million acres of public land in the Grand Canyon watershed. Doc. # 1

12

(3:12-cv-08042-DGC) (“NWMA Complaint”); Doc. #1 (3:12-cv-08038-GMS) (“NMA

13

Complaint”); Doc. #56 (3:12-cv-08038-GMS) (“NMA Amended Complaint”). NWMA

14

raises seven claims; the first six allege that DOI violated numerous laws including the

15

Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), the National Forest Management

16

Act (NFMA), and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NWMA Complaint

17

¶¶ 57-126. NWMA’s seventh claim alleges that the mineral withdrawal should be set

18

aside because the FLPMA provision authorizing large tract withdrawals contains an

19

allegedly unconstitutional legislative veto. Id. ¶¶ 127-145. NWMA seeks common relief

20

in each cause of action, asking the Court to set aside the Public Land Order mandating

21

the mineral withdrawal. See id. ¶¶ 63, 74, 87, 105, 115, 126, 145.

22

NMA’s complaint similarly raises a host of claims, alleging that the Department of

23

the Interior violated NEPA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as well as a

24

claim challenging the withdrawal based on the legislative veto provision in FLPMA.

25

NMA Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 97-121. NMA’s complaint states that each of these

26

claims is a basis for which the mineral withdrawal “should be declared unlawful and set

27

aside.” Id. at ¶ 2.

28

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 3 of 13

1

NMA in August 2012 and NWMA in January 2013 chose to move for summary

2

judgment on just one of their numerous causes of action: their legislative veto claim.

3

Doc. #73 (3:12-cv-08038-DGC) (NMA Partial Summ. J. Memo.); Doc. #90 (NWMA

4

Partial Summ. J. Memo.). This Court denied NMWA’s and NMA’s motions, finding the

5

legislative veto unconstitutional but severable, thus declining to set aside the Grand

6

Canyon watershed mineral withdrawal. Doc. #130. The Court later denied NMWA’s

7

and NMA’s motion to reconsider that ruling. Doc. #144. Following denial of the

8

summary judgment motions, the Mining Associations joined all parties in submitting a

9

proposed case management schedule that would allowed plaintiffs four months to review

10

the administrative record, and two months after that to file opening briefs to resolve

11

remaining claims. Doc. # 138.

12

Pursuant to Rule 54(b), NWMA and NMA (collectively, the Mining Associations)

13

now ask this court to enter final judgment on their failed legislative veto claims so that

14

they can pursue an appeal. Doc. # 146 (NWMA Motion); Doc. # 147 (NMA Joinder

15

Notice). This Court should deny the Mining Associations’ motions. This case is not an

16

“unusual” one that requires piecemeal review by the appeals court. The legislative veto

17

claim and the remaining claims share similar fact and legal issues, and the Mining

18

Associations fail to demonstrate a harsh or unjust result should the veto claim not be

19

certified. Certifying the constitutional claim for appeal would also risk imposing

20

unnecessary costs on the courts and the other parties.

21
22

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Rule 54(b) provides in part that when more than one claim for relief is presented

23

in an action, the district court enter final judgment on fewer than all of the claims “only if

24

the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.” Fed. R. Civ. P.

25

54(b). This determination “is left to the sound judicial discretion of the district court.”

26

Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Elec. Corp., 446 U.S. 1, 8 (1980). However, this

27

discretion should be exercised “sparingly,” Gausvik v. Perez, 392 F.3d 1006, 1009 n.2

28
2

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 4 of 13

1

(9th Cir. 2004)), and based upon “such factors as the interrelationship of the claims so as

2

to prevent piecemeal appeals.” Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 10. See also Martinelli

3

v. Petland, Inc., No. CV-09-529-PHX-DGC, 2010 WL 1416512, at *1 (D. Ariz. Apr. 7,

4

2010) (quoting Gausvik, 392 F.3d at 1009 n.2). “A similarity of legal or factual issues”

5

between the claim sought to be certified and the remaining claims “will weigh heavily

6

against entry of judgment under the rule, and in such cases a Rule 54(b) order will be

7

proper only where necessary to avoid a harsh and unjust result[.]” Frank Briscoe Co. v.

8

Morrison-Knudsen Co., 776 F.2d 1414, 1416 (9th Cir. 1985) (quotation omitted). See

9

also Grand Canyon Trust v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, No. CV-07-8164-PHX-DGC,

10
11

2010 WL 3244893, at *1 (D. Ariz. Aug. 16, 2010) (quoting Frank Briscoe Co.).
Certification under Rule 54(b) is an extraordinary measure that is not to be granted

12

as a matter of course. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 5. There exists “a long-settled

13

and prudential policy against the scattershot disposition of litigation,” and “entry of

14

judgment under [Rule 54(b)] should not be indulged as a matter of routine or as a

15

magnanimous accommodation to lawyers or litigants.” Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts

16

College, 843 F.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). “Judgments under Rule

17

54(b) must be reserved for the unusual case in which the costs and risks of multiplying

18

the number of proceedings and of overcrowding the appellate docket are outbalanced by

19

pressing needs of the litigants for an early and separate judgment as to some claims or

20

parties.” Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965 (9th Cir. 1981). See

21

also Grand Canyon Trust, No. CV-07-8164-PHX-DGC at *1 (quotation & citation

22

omitted); Wood v. GCC Bend, LLC, 422 F.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir. 2005) (“[w]e cannot

23

afford the luxury of reviewing the same set of facts in a routine case more than once

24

without a seriously important reason.”).

25

A court must make specific written findings if it intends to grant a motion for

26

entry of judgment per Rule 54(b). “Those findings should include a determination

27

whether, upon any review of the judgment entered under the rule, the appellate court will

28
3

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 5 of 13

1

be required to address legal or factual issues that are similar to those contained in the

2

claims still pending before the trial court.” Morrison-Knudsen Co., 655 F.2d at 965.

3

ARGUMENT

5

Because The Claims For Which NWMA Seeks Entry Of Judgment Are
Similar To The Unresolved Claims, The Court Should Deny The Mining
Associations’ Motion.

6

The similarity of legal and factual issues in the claim the Mining Associations

4

I.

7

seek to certify pursuant to Rule 54(b) and the plaintiffs’ remaining claims weighs heavily

8

against granting the Mining Associations’ motion. See Frank Briscoe Co., 776 F.2d at

9

1416 (citation omitted).

10

All of the Mining Associations’ claims are interrelated and share a common

11

factual nucleus because all are aimed at overturning a single federal agency action: the

12

mineral withdrawal. NWMA acknowledges this: “[A]ll of NWMA’s claims arise from

13

the same event, namely the Secretary’s withdrawal.” NWMA Motion at 5. The Mining

14

Associations’ complaints reinforce this conclusion. For each of its claims, NWMA seeks

15

the same relief, namely setting aside the public land order implementing the withdrawal.

16

See supra at 1. NWMA succinctly states the purposes of its action in the complaint’s

17

introduction: “NWMA seeks judicial review of [Federal] Defendants’ actions in

18

withdrawing over 1 million acres of federal lands in northern Arizona.” NMWA

19

Complaint at 1. Similarly, NMA describes its complaint as a challenge to the

20

environmental impact statement, record of decision, and the public land order

21

“withdrawing from location and entry … over one million (1,000,000) acres of federal

22

lands in northern Arizona.” NMA Amended Complaint at ¶ 1. NMA’s complaint states

23

that each of its claims is a basis for which the mineral withdrawal “should be declared

24

unlawful and set aside.” Id. at ¶ 2. Further, without the mineral withdrawal, the Mining

25

Associations would have no arguable basis for a claim attacking the legislative veto,

26

because they cannot allege that the veto’s mere existence provides them with standing or

27

gives rise to a case or controversy under Article III. The factual issues concerning the

28
4

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 6 of 13

1

legislative veto claim are thus similar and interrelated with the facts involved in the

2

Mining Associations’ remaining claims. The appeals court may thus be required to

3

review in separate cases the related factual issues in two appeals.

4

The legal issues of all of the Mining Associations’ claims, like the factual issues,

5

are similar and interrelated. The Ninth Circuit could face nearly identical legal issues in

6

addressing the legislative veto and the remaining claims, risking inconsistent judgment

7

from different appellate panels. For example, Federal Defendants have argued that all of

8

the Mining Associations’ claims should be dismissed because the plaintiffs lack standing

9

for all of their claims and because plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe. Doc. #39 (3:12-cv-

10

08038-GMS) at 9 (NMWA has “have not satisfied these requirements [standing and

11

ripeness] as to any of their claims”). See also Doc. #27 (3:12-cv-08042-DGC) at 10

12

(making similar assertion re: NMA). Federal Defendants also indicate that they may

13

continue to test plaintiffs’ standing. See Doc. #148. While the District Court denied

14

Federal Defendant’s challenge to plaintiffs’ standing at the motion to dismiss stage,

15

Federal Defendants (or this Court, sua sponte) can raise standing at the merits stage, and

16

both ripeness and standing could be tested on appeal. If the Mining Associations are

17

permitted to pursue their piecemeal appeal, the Court of Appeals may be required to

18

address standing and ripeness not once but twice, in the context of the legislative veto

19

claim and any remaining claims appealed, thus potentially requiring duplicative briefing

20

and court consideration of the same facts and law, and raising the risk of inconsistent

21

judgments. Such redundancy and the possibility of inconsistent results contravenes

22

federal policy which favors “sound judicial administration” and disfavors piecemeal

23

appellate review. Wood, 422 F.3d at 877 (quoting Curtis-Wright Corp., 466 U.S. at 8.).

24

NMWA argues that this Court should grant Rule 54(b) certification because the

25

legislative veto claim relies on a different legal theory than the other claims. NWMA

26

Motion at 6. However, the Ninth Circuit has cautioned that Rule 54(b) certification

27

should not be granted when the appeals court would have to address legal or factual

28
5

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 7 of 13

1

issues similar to that still pending in the district court. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 655 F.2d

2

at 965. Even if the Mining Associations’ legislative veto claim relies on a different

3

theory than plaintiffs’ remaining claims, the veto claim is based on the same factual

4

issues as those still pending before this Court – the Secretary’s withdrawal decision.

5

Further, some courts have held that presenting alternative legal theories is not enough, by

6

itself, to support Rule 54(b) certification if the legal theories arise from the same

7

occurrence or interaction. See, e.g., Sherwin v. Infinity Auto Ins. Co., No. 2:11-CV-43

8

JCM(VCF), 2011 WL 5598344, at *2 (D. Nev. Nov. 16, 2011) (it was not proper for the

9

court to sever the plaintiff’s bad faith causes of action from the rest of the case because

10

they are not distinct claims “but simply alternative legal theories”); Claver v. Coldwell

11

Banker Residential Brokerage Co., No. 08-cv-817-L(AJB), 2009 WL 1606611, at *2

12

(S.D. Cal. June 8, 2009) (denying Rule 54(b) certification because although plaintiff’s

13

legal theories differed, the factual basis for the allegations was the same). Presenting

14

alternative legal theories alone is not sufficient grounds for obtaining Rule 54(b)

15

certification.

16

Because the facts and law of the legislative veto claim are similar to those in the

17

remaining claims, this Court should exercise its discretion to certify the veto claim for

18

appeal only if the Mining Association can show that the failure to certify would work a

19

“harsh” or “unjust” result. Frank Briscoe Co., 776 F.2d at 1416. The Mining

20

Associations, however, never allege that the harm they may face rises to such a level.

21

The Mining Associations’ failure to allege a harsh or unjust result is fatal to their motion.

22

See Grand Canyon Trust, No. CV-07-8164-PHX-DGC, 2010 WL 324489, at *2.1

23

II.

Because Certifying The Legislative Veto Claim Risks Duplicative Appellate
Filings, The Court Should Deny The Mining Association’s Motion.

24

Even if this court concludes that the legal and factual issues of the legislative veto

25
26
27
28

claim are unrelated to the remaining claims, the Court should deny NWMA’s motion
1

NWMA does allege some harm from failure to certify the legislative veto claim, but
they do not allege such harm is “harsh” or “unjust.” We respond to the allegations of
harm infra at 11 n.5.
6

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 8 of 13

1

because certifying the veto ruling risks placing an unnecessary burden on the appellate

2

court, and because any harm to the Mining Associations is largely self-inflicted.

3

“[I]n deciding whether there are no just reasons to delay the appeal of individual

4

final judgments in setting such as this, a district court must take into account judicial

5

administrative interests as well as the equities involved.” Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S.

6

at 8. The paramount judicial administrative interest is in avoiding “[d]uplication of

7

proceedings,” Wood, 422 F.3d at 882, including the “risk[]of multiplying the number of

8

proceedings and of overcrowding the appellate docket.” Morrison-Knudsen Co., 655

9

F.2d at 965. The Ninth Circuit has been particularly sensitive to the risks of duplicative

10

appeals because of the “huge” number of cases in its docket. Wood, 422 F.3d at 882-83.2

11

Here, there is significant risk that Rule 54(b) certification of the Mining

12

Associations’ legislative veto claim will lead to “multiplying the number of proceedings

13

and overcrowding” the Ninth Circuit’s docket. The Mining Associations failed in this

14

Court on their legislative veto claim and are likely to fail before the Court of Appeals. As

15

the United States noted at oral argument on the Mining Associations’ summary judgment

16

motions, the Mining Associations failed to identify a single federal court decision – and

17

the United States found none – where a court severed any part of a statute beyond the

18

legislative veto in cases where the statute, like FLPMA, contained a severability clause.

19

Thus in the likely event that the Ninth Circuit upholds this Court’s ruling on the

20

legislative veto, a second appeal on the remaining claims (scheduled to be briefed in this

21

Court late this year and early next) is possible, even likely. Rather than expediting a

22

conclusion to this case before the appeals court, there is a significant risk that certifying

23

the Court’s order on the legislative veto claim will serve to bifurcate the case, resulting in

24

two appeals where otherwise there would be only one consolidated appeal on all claims.

25

The Ninth Circuit has specifically declined to certify a partial judgment for appeal on

26
27
28

2

In 2012, nearly thirteen thousand appeals were filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals. See http://www.ce9.uscourts.gov/statistics/appeals_court.pdf (last viewed
July 1, 2013).
7

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 9 of 13

1

such grounds. See, e.g., Wood, 422 F.3d at 883 (denying motion for entry of judgment

2

under Rule 54(b) where “[i]Instead of one appeal that we could now resolve, certification

3

makes it likely there will be two”).

4

In addition, if this court declines to certify the legislative veto claim and addresses

5

the remainder of the Mining Associations’ claims, there is a chance that there may be no

6

appeal at all. The Mining Associations cannot appeal a district court ruling in their favor.

7

If this Court vacates the mineral withdrawal based on any of the Mining Associations’

8

remaining claims, the Mining Associations cannot be harmed by a vacated withdrawal,

9

and thus will have no standing to appeal the legislative veto claim. See Quinn v. Milsap,

10

491 U.S. 95 (1989) (court must satisfy itself that a case or controversy remains at

11

appellate level). The Ninth Circuit has held that one compelling reason for not certifying

12

an issue for appeal is the chance that the appeals court need never reach the certified

13

claim. See Wood, 422 F.3d at 882 (“absent certification, we may never have to decide”

14

the claim certified).

15

Further, if this Court grants the Mining Associations’ motion and does not stay the

16

remainder of the case, it is likely that any appeal of a district court decision on the

17

remaining claims would be taken and briefed while the Ninth Circuit continues to weigh

18

the legislative veto claim. Under the current Case Management Order, the parties could

19

complete briefing on the merits in April 2014; a ruling would likely come shortly

20

thereafter. See Doc. #141. The Ninth Circuit advises that it hears argument on civil

21

cases “approximately 12-20 months” after the notice of appeal. See U.S. Courts for thje

22

Ninth Circuit, Frequently Asked Questions, http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/faq.php

23

(last visited July 1, 2013). A written order can take another 6-12 months or longer

24

following argument. All told, it could be 2015 or even 2016 before the Court of Appeals

25

rules on the legislative veto claim if it is certified. Thus, there is a significant risk that

26

certification will result in two appeals pending simultaneously in the Ninth Circuit, a

27
28
8

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 10 of 13

1

result that will burden the appeals court and the parties. This risk weighs heavily against

2

granting the Mining Associations’ motion.

3

Despite these risks, NWMA argues that “Rule 54(b) certification … will help to

4

‘streamline the ensuing litigation,’ Texaco, Inc. v. Ponsoldt, 939 F.2d 794, 797-98 (9th

5

Cir. 1991), because the Ninth Circuit may not have to expend judicial resources resolving

6

the other issues in this case.” NWMA Motion at 7. NWMA overstates its case. There is

7

no guarantee that certifying the legislative veto claim “will streamline” this case.

8

Texaco, 939 F.2d at 798 (emphasis added). See also id. at 797 (“Rule 54(b) certification

9

is proper if it will aid ‘expeditious decision’ of the case.” (emphasis added) (citation

10

omitted)). In fact, just the opposite; certification is more likely to result in two trips to

11

the appeals court rather than one. Such a risk has led courts to deny Rule 54(b) motions.

12

See, e.g., U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Williamsburg Nat’l Ins. Co., 2009 WL 650578 at *4, No.

13

1:07-cv-00718 GSA (E.D. Cal. March 12, 2009) (declining to certify claim for appeal

14

where one potential ruling from the appeals court on the certified claim would result in

15

two appeals). Rather than “streamlining” the case by eliminating the “risk[]of

16

multiplying the number of proceedings and of overcrowding the appellate docket,”

17

Morrison-Knudsen Co., 655 F.2d at 965, granting the Mining Associations’ motion

18

would increase that risk.

19

NWMA further alleges that certification is warranted because the issue at stake is

20

one of “widespread importance that has not been definitively resolved by the Ninth

21

Circuit.” NWMA Motion at 7. While the issue at stake may have broad implications for

22

public lands management if NWMA prevails, the Ninth Circuit has not “definitively

23

resolved” the issue because until now no one has ever legally challenged the FLPMA

24

provision in the nearly 37 years the Interior Department has exercised its authority to

25

make large-tract withdrawals. NWMA does not explain why the Court of Appeals must

26

now urgently address the Mining Associations’ idiosyncratic legal theory.3 Nor does the

27
28

3

The fact that the Mining Associations seek to appeal an adverse decision on a
constitutional issue is not, by itself, sufficient to justify immediate appeal. See Blair v.
9

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 149 Filed 07/01/13 Page 11 of 13

1

Ninth Circuit case NWMA cites support its argument. Purdy Mobile Homes, Inc. v.

2

Champion Home Builders Co. upheld a district court’s Rule 54(b) certification in part

3

because the resolved claim involved “an interpretation of [an] Act on which there is some

4

disagreement among the courts.” 594 F.2d 1313, 1316-17 (9th Cir. 1979) (emphasis

5

added), cited by NWMA Motion at 8. Here, there is no “disagreement among the courts”

6

over the claim at stake because no plaintiff has ever before asked a court to pass

7

judgment on the constitutionality of the FLPMA legislative veto challenged here, and

8

because courts have uniformly found legislative vetoes severable where the statute

9

contained a severability clause. Further, the district court in Purdy concluded that

10

certification would clarify a legal issue at the appeals court that would assist the district

11

court in a subsequent trial, or avoid the necessity of a second trial. Purdy, 594 F.2d at

12

1316-17. That is not the case here, where a ruling affirming the district court would

13

likely have little impact on this Court’s evaluation of the remaining claims. Finally,

14

Purdy does not support NWMA’s argument that a court should grant a Rule 54(b) motion

15

because of a movant’s subjective belief that the claim at issue is of “great importance.”

16

NWMA Motion at 8.

17

Granting the Mining Associations’ motion would not only risk burdening judicial

18

economy, but the equities do not favor certifying the veto claim. NWMA alleges its

19

members would face financial harm from waiting an extra year or so for the district court

20

to resolve this case’s remaining claims. Id. at 8-9. However, whatever harm NWMA’s

21

members face is largely self-inflicted. The Mining Associations chose to bifurcate each

22

of their cases, testing their constitutional argument first, rather than litigating all of their

23

claims together. They then agreed to a proposed schedule that would have allowed them

24

half a year to review the administrative record and file their opening brief to resolve the

25

remaining claims. Doc. # 138. If the Mining Associations were so deeply concerned

about their members’ financial harm, they could have sought preliminary relief on all of

their claims at once, or pressed for an expedited briefing schedule. They did neither. The

Mining Associations cannot complain now of the harm they may face that is due in large

part to their own tactical maneuvering.4 In these circumstances, the Mining Associations

fail to show a “pressing need” for immediate appellate review. See Frank Briscoe Co.,

NWMA and/or NMA could also dismiss their remaining claims to obtain immediate
review of the legislative veto claim. See Building Industry Ass’n of Superior California
v. Norton, 247 F.2d 1241 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (trade association dismisses claims resulting in
remand to obtain circuit court review of remaining claim).

Further, NWMA’s memo implies greater potential financial harm to its members than
would likely result from the twelve months or so it will likely take to resolve the
remainder of this case before this Court. NMWA alleges that 3,000 mining claims are
located within the withdrawn area, which could lead to the payment of $420,000 in
maintenance fees while the withdrawal allegedly “prevents NWMA members from
developing their claims unless they submit to an expensive and time-consuming validity
examination.” NWMA Motion at 9. Even assuming that the withdrawal prevents all
development of existing claims (which it does not), NWMA does not indicate how many
of the 3,000 total claims its members hold. Further, given that BLM predicted that only
36 exploration projects and about one new mine would be developed each year if the
withdrawal were not in effect, NWMA members would likely be doing little besides
paying maintenance fees on the vast majority of their claims even if the withdrawal were
set aside immediately. BLM, Final EIS, Northern Arizona Proposed Withdrawal (Oct.
2011) at 2-11 – 2-13; Admin Rec. 1665-67 (likely number of exploration projects and
mines developed annually under the “no action” (i.e., the “no withdrawal”) alternative).
