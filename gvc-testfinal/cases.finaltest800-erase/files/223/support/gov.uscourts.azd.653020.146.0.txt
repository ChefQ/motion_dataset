MOTION FOR FINAL JUDGMENT ON ITS SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF

2

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Northwest Mining Association (“NWMA”), and, pursuant

3
4

to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), hereby moves for this Court to enter final

5

judgment on NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief. As demonstrated in the accompanying

6

Memorandum of Law, because NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief is separable, both

7

factually and legally, from its other claims and the remaining claims in the consolidated

8
9
10

cases, there is no just reason for delay in entering final judgment on NWMA’s Seventh
Claim for Relief.

11

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

12

On January 9, 2012, Defendant Salazar signed a Record of Decision (“ROD”) and

13
14

issued Public Land Order (“PLO”) 7787, which withdrew over 1 million acres in northern

15

Arizona from location and entry under the Mining Law for twenty years. 77 Fed. Reg.

16

2,563–66 (Jan. 18, 2012). On March 6, 2012, NWMA filed this action seeking judicial

17

review of, inter alia, Defendant Salazar’s withdrawal. NWMA Complaint; Doc. *1.1

18
19

NWMA’s Complaint contains seven claims for relief. Six of the claims allege violations

20

of, inter alia: (a) the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (“FLPMA”), 43 U.S.C. §

21

1701 et seq.; (b) the National Forest Management Act (“NFMA”), 16 U.S.C. § 1600 et

22

seq.; and (c) the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.

23
24

See NWMA Complaint ¶¶ 56–126. The Seventh Claim for Relief alleges that Defendant

In keeping with this Court’s method, an asterisk before a document number indicates
that the cited document was filed prior to consolidation and was docketed using the
original case number.

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 4 of 13

1
2

Salazar exceeded his authority in withdrawing over 5,000 acres because Section 204(c)(1)
of FLPMA contains an unconstitutional and non-severable legislative veto, which renders

3
4

Section 204(c)(1) null and void. Id. ¶¶ 127–145.
On January 18, 2013, NWMA filed a motion for partial summary judgment on

5
6
7

NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief, joining Plaintiffs National Mining Association and
Nuclear Energy Institute’s (“NMA and NEI”) motion for partial summary judgment on

8
9

the same issue. Doc. 90. On February 8, 2013, Defendant and Intervenors responded to

10

the motion and filed their own motions for partial summary judgment on the issue. Docs.

11

101 and 102. On March 20, 2013, this Court issued an Order denying Plaintiffs’ motions

12

for summary judgment and granting Defendants and Intervenors’ motions for partial

13
14

summary judgment. Doc. 130. On April 4, 2013, NMA and NEI filed a motion for

15

reconsideration of this Court’s Order, which NWMA joined. Docs. 135 and 136. On

16

May 16, 2013, this Court denied the motion for reconsideration. Doc. 144. NWMA now

17

respectfully requests that this Court issue final judgment on NWMA’s Seventh Claim for

18
19

Relief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).
ARGUMENT

20
21
22

I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides “[w]hen an action presents more

23
24

than one claim for relief . . . the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or

25

more, but fewer than all, claims . . . only if the court expressly determines that there is no

26

just reason for delay.” When a district court issues final judgment on one claim pursuant

27

to Rule 54(b), it creates a judgment that is immediately appealable. SEC v. Capital

28
NWMA’s Motion for Final Judgment on its Seventh Claim for Relief

2

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 5 of 13

1

Consultants LLC, 453 F.3d 1166, 1173–75 (9th Cir. 2006).

2

A district court may certify an order as final only if it determines that the order is a

3
4

“final judgment” and that there is no just reason to delay an appeal of the issue. Curtiss-

5

Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7–8 (1980). Although the order must be a

6

final judgment on a claim, “[t]he Rule 54(b) claims do not have to be separate from and

7

independent of the remaining claims.” Sheehan v. Atlanta Intern. Ins. Co., 812 F.2d 465,

8
9

468 (9th Cir. 1987).

10

While a district court must scrutinize Rule 54(b) certification to “‘prevent

11

piecemeal appeals in cases which should be reviewed only as single units,’” McIntyre v.

12

United States, 789 F.2d 1408, 1410 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446

13
14

U.S. at 10), certification is proper if it will aid “expeditious decision” of the case.

15

Sheehan, 812 F.2d at 468. Overall, “[i]t is left to the sound judicial discretion of the

16

district court to determine the ‘appropriate time’ when each final decision in a multiple

17

claims action is ready for appeal,” including the consideration of the “equities” of the

18
19

case, so long as this discretion is “exercised ‘in the interest of sound judicial

20

administration.’” Curtiss-Wright Corp, 446 U.S. at 8 (quoting Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.

21

Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 435, 437 (1956)).

22
23

THIS COURT’S ORDER ON NWMA’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL
SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS EFFECTIVELY A FINAL JUDGMENT.

24

This Court’s March 20, 2013 Order is a final judgment on NWMA’s Seventh

25

II.

Claim for Relief because it is “a ‘judgment’ in the sense that it is a decision upon a

26
27
28

cognizable claim for relief,” and it is “‘final’ in the sense that it is ‘an ultimate disposition
of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action.’” Curtiss-Wright
NWMA’s Motion for Final Judgment on its Seventh Claim for Relief

3

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 6 of 13

1
2

Corp., 446 U.S. at 7 (quoting Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 436
(1956)). Because Rule 54(b) allows an order on a claim to be immediately appealed, Rule

3
4

54(b) “‘does not relax the finality required of each decision, as an individual claim, to

5

render it appealable.’” Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund v. Miller, 938 F.2d

6

1038, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Sears, Roebuck & Co., 351 U.S. at 435). Rule

7

54(b) “simply allows a judgment to be entered if it has the requisite degree of finality as to

8
9

an individual claim in a multiclaim action.” Id. at 1040.
Drawing a parallel to final judgments under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, the Ninth Circuit

10
11
12

has held that an order is final under Rule 54(b) if it “ends the litigation on the merits and
leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Arizona State Carpenters

13
14

Pension Trust Fund, 938 F.3d at 1039 (internal quotations and citations omitted). In this

15

case, the issue regarding the constitutionality of the Secretary’s authority to make large-

16

tract withdrawals was resolved by this Court’s March 20, 2013 Order (and subsequent

17

ruling on the motion to reconsider), and nothing remains for this Court to do but execute

18
19

judgment on the claim.

20

This is especially true considering the fact that NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief

21

is entirely separate from its other claims. The constitutional issues regarding the FLPMA

22

land withdrawal authorities at stake here are important and controlling as to this entire

23
24

litigation. They are not routine issues, and the constitutional issues under FLPMA have

25

not been addressed by any federal appellate court. NWMA’s other claims allege

26

Defendants violated FLPMA, NFMA, and NEPA.2 A ruling on NWMA’s other claims

27
28

2

NWMA recognizes that this Court dismissed its NEPA claims for lack of prudential
standing. Doc. 87 at 36–41. NEPA claims by other parties, however, still remain. Id. at

4

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 7 of 13

1
2

for relief will not affect the outcome of NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief. Although all
of NWMA’s claims arise from the same event, namely the Secretary’s withdrawal,

3
4

NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief remains distinct from its other claims because of the

5

facts and various legal theories presented by those claims. See Purdy Mobile Homes, Inc.

6

v. Champion Home Builders Co., 594 F.2d 1313, 1316 (9th Cir. 1979) (rejecting

7

appellant’s argument that there were not multiple claims for relief because some facts

8
9
10

were common to all of plaintiff’s “theories of recovery”).
III.

THERE IS NO JUST REASON FOR DELAYING FINAL JUDGMENT ON
NWMA’S SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF.

11
12

There is no just reason for delaying entry of final judgment on NWMA’s Seventh

13

Claim for Relief because entry of final judgment would have minimal effect on the proper

14

judicial administration of this case. Furthermore, any judicial administrative interests are

15

outweighed by NWMA’s interest in the efficient resolution of the issue of the Secretary’s

16
17
18
19
20

authority to make large-tract withdrawals.
“[I]n deciding whether there are no just reasons to delay the appeal of individual
final judgments in setting such as this, a district court must take into account judicial
administrative interests as well as the equities involved.” Curtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S.

21
22

at 8. In analyzing these issues, it is proper for a district court to consider factors such as

23

“whether the claims under review [are] separable from the others remaining to be

24

adjudicated and whether the nature of the claims already determined [are] such that no

25
26
27
28

26–35, 44–46. In addition, Rule 54(b) provides that “any order or other decision, however
designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer
than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be
revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the
parties' rights and liabilities.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Accordingly, NWMA is not seeking
entry of final judgment as to its NEPA claims.
NWMA’s Motion for Final Judgment on its Seventh Claim for Relief

5

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 8 of 13

1
2

appellate court [will] have to decide the same issues more than once even if there [are]
subsequent appeals.” Id.

3
In this case, NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief is completely separate and distinct

4
5

from its other Claims for Relief, and the Ninth Circuit will not have to decide the same

6

issues twice. As demonstrated above, NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief relies on an

7

entirely different legal theory than its other claims. Moreover, NWMA’s Seventh Claim

8
9

for Relief involves strictly a legal issue the resolution of which does not require

10

Defendants’ administrative record. In contrast, resolution of NWMA’s remaining claims

11

will require this Court to thoroughly review Defendants’ administrative record. See Doc.

12
13
14

145 (this Court noting that judicial review of agency action is generally based upon the
administrative record).3 Under these circumstances, entry of final judgment pursuant to

15

Rule 54(b) is entirely proper. Compare Gregorian v. Izvestia, 871 F.2d 1515, 1519–20

16

(9th Cir. 1989) (upholding 54(b) certification of an “adjudicated” libel claim because the

17

factual and legal issues were substantially different from the remaining intentional

18
19

infliction of emotional distress claims), with Frank Briscoe Co. v. Morrison-Knudsen Co.,

20

776 F.2d 1414, 1416 (9th Cir. 1985) (stating that a “‘similarity of legal or factual issues

21

[between resolved claims and remaining claims] will weigh heavily against entry of

22

judgment under the rule,’”) (quoting Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965

23
24
25
26
27
28

(9th Cir. 1981)); see also Martinelli v. Petland, Inc., CV-09-529-PHX-DGC, 2010 WL
1416512 (D. Ariz. Apr. 7, 2010) (this Court rejecting 54(b) certification because, unlike in
3

All of NWMA’s claims for relief essentially seek to hold unlawful and set aside the
withdrawal. If NWMA ultimately prevails on its Seventh Claim for Relief, a remand to
the Secretary is not possible because the Secretary would lack the statutory authority to
make the withdrawal. If NWMA prevails on its other claims, a remand is a possibility.

2

this case, “[t]he facts and law of the remaining claims and those that have been dismissed
are not unrelated.”).

3
4

Although there are “costs and risks of multiplying the number of proceedings and

5

of overcrowding the appellate docket,” Frank Briscoe Co., 776 F.2d at 1416, those costs

6

and risks are minimal in this case. As a result of this Court’s March 20, 2013 Order,

7

NWMA is unable to get the full relief requested in its complaint. See Cont’l Airlines, Inc.

8
9

v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 819 F.2d 1519, 1525 (9th Cir. 1987) (stating that Rule

10

54(b) certification is ordinarily disfavored in cases where the plaintiff can still obtain full

11

recovery and might never need to “appeal the instant judgments” but ultimately upholding

12

Rule 54(b) judgment because the partial summary judgments narrowed the issues and

13
14

efficiently separated the legal from the factual questions.). Because of this, NWMA will

15

likely appeal this Court’s March 20, 2013 Order regardless of the outcome on its other

16

claims and the Ninth Circuit will eventually have to expend judicial resources to resolve

17

the issue raised by NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief. If this Court grants Rule 54(b)

18
19

certification, however, it will help to “streamline the ensuing litigation,” Texaco, Inc. v.

20

Ponsoldt, 939 F.2d 794, 797-98 (9th Cir. 1991), because the Ninth Circuit may not have to

21

expend judicial resources resolving the other issues in this case.

22

An additional reason why this Court should enter judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b)

23
24

is because this Court’s decision on the Claim involves an issue of widespread importance

25

that has not been definitively resolved by the Ninth Circuit. See PAETEC Commc'ns, Inc.

26

v. MCI Commc'ns Servs., Inc., 784 F. Supp. 2d 542, 548 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (entering

27

judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) in part because the court “decided an issue important to

28
NWMA’s Motion for Final Judgment on its Seventh Claim for Relief

7

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 10 of 13

1
2

the telecommunications industry as a matter of first impression”); see also Purdy Mobile
Homes, Inc. v. Champion Home Builders Co., 594 F.2d 1313, 1316-17 (9th Cir. 1979)

3
4

(upholding 54(b) certification in part because the resolved claim involved “an

5

interpretation of [an] Act on which there is some disagreement among the courts.”). The

6

issue of the Secretary’s authority to make large-tract withdrawals is a matter of great

7

importance to NWMA’s members and the mining industry in general as the number of

8
9

large-tract withdrawals has increased in recent years. See Doc. *53-2 (Declaration of

10

NWMA’s Executive Director); Doc. 110-1 (Declaration of David C. Fredley explaining

11

history and number of large-tract withdrawals). Even Defendants view this issue as “a

12

matter of great importance to the United States and one with far-reaching ramifications.”

13
14
15
16
17

Doc. 94 at 3.
Finally, examining the equities involved in this case demonstrates that any
concerns about proper judicial administration are outweighed by NWMA’s interests in
quickly resolving the issue raised by its Seventh Claim for Relief. While taking an

18
19

immediate appeal of this Court’s March 20, 2013 Order would not prejudice either the

20

Defendants or Intervenors, a delay would significantly prejudice NWMA and its

21

members.

22

Pursuant to this Court’s Case Management Order, briefing on the remaining issue

23
24

will not begin until November 8, 2013, at the earliest, and is slated to continue for five and

25

one-half months. Doc. 141. Optimistically, a decision on the remaining claims will not be

26

issued until the summer of 2014. During that time, NWMA’s members must continue to

27

pay an annual maintenance fee of $140 per claim in the withdrawn area on or before

28
NWMA’s Motion for Final Judgment on its Seventh Claim for Relief

8

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 11 of 13

1
2

September 1 of each year. 30 U.S.C. § 28f; 74 Fed. Reg. 30,959 (June 29, 2009). The
record in this case indicates that at least 3,000 mining claims were located within the

3
4

withdrawn area, which means that over $420,000.00 in maintenance fees are payable

5

annually to the U.S. Interior Department to prevent forfeiture of the pre-existing mining

6

claims by operation of law. These substantial annual payments are not recoverable.

7

Having to pay maintenance fees is especially burdensome because the withdrawal

8
9

essentially prevents NWMA members from developing their claims unless they submit to

10

an expensive and time-consuming validity examination. Doc. 87 at 12 (this Court noting

11

that NWMA members have “alleged both immediate and ongoing financial injury to their

12

investments as a result of [the withdrawal and] the new regulatory scheme”); see Docs.

13
14

*53-3, *53-4,* 53-5, *53-6 (Declarations of NWMA members alleging the same).

15

Granted, to secure a decision on appeal will take time. U.S. Court of Appeals for the

16

Ninth Circuit, Frequently Asked Questions, http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/faq.php

17

(last visited June 10, 2013) (noting that it takes between twelve and twenty months from

18
19

the date of the notice of appeal for a case to be heard by the Ninth Circuit). Yet, entry of

20

judgment on NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief may shave a year or two off the time that

21

NWMA’s members must pay maintenance fees on essentially undevelopable claims.

22

Therefore, the prejudice to NWMA and its members outweighs the minimal costs

23
24

and risks of multiplying the number of proceedings in the Court of Appeals. Frank

25

Briscoe Co, 776 F.2d at 1416 (stating that judgments under Rule 54(b) should be reserved

26

for cases “in which the costs and risks of multiplying the number of proceedings and of

27

overcrowding the appellate docket are outbalanced by the pressing needs of the litigants

28

9

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 146 Filed 06/12/13 Page 12 of 13

1
2

for an early and separate judgment as to some claims or parties.”).
Because NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief is separable, both factually and

3
4

legally, from its other claims, this Court and the Ninth Circuit will likely expend the same

5

amount of judicial resources regardless of how this Court rules on the motion. On the

6

other hand, the costs of delaying appellate review on the issue of the Secretary’s authority

7

to make large-tract withdrawals are significant. As a result, there is no just reason for

8
9

delaying certification of final judgment on NWMA’s Seventh Claim for Relief.

10

CONCLUSION

11

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant NWMA’s motion for final

12

judgment on its Seventh Claim for Relief.
