Case No. 14-C-00064-SLC

SCOTT WALKER, et al.,
Defendants.

PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO STATE DEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED
FINDINGS OF FACT IN OPPOSITION TO PLANITIFFS’
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Pursuant to § III.A.2 of this Court’s Procedure to be Followed on Motions for Summary
Judgment, Plaintiffs Virginia Wolf, et al., respectfully submit this Response to State Defendants’
Proposed Findings of Fact in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 103).
I. Marriage in the United States and Across the Globe.
1.
No country allowed same-sex couples to marry until the Netherlands in 2000.
U.S. v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2715 (2013) (Alito, J., dissenting).
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs do not dispute State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 1.1
2.
In 2000, the Vermont Legislature created the status of civil unions that granted
“all the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities under law . . . as are granted to spouses in
a civil marriage.” Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 1204(a).
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs do not dispute State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 2.

1

The absence of a dispute with regard to any Proposed Finding of Fact (in whole or in
part) does not mean that Plaintiffs concede the materiality of that Proposed Finding.
1

3.
Same-sex marriage was first recognized by a United States jurisdiction on
November 18, 2003, pursuant to the ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. See
Goodridge v. Dep’t of Public Health, 440 Mass. 309 (2003).
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs do not dispute State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 3.
4.
Currently, four states prohibit same-sex civil marriage by statute Indiana (Ind.
Code § 31-11-1-1), Pennsylvania (Pa. Cons. Stat. § 1102), West Virginia (W. Va. Code § 48-2104), and Wyoming (Wyo. Stat. § 20-1-106).
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs dispute State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 4, since there are
more than four states that deny (or denied)2 same-sex couples the freedom to marry by statute.
See, e.g., Idaho Code §§ 32-201, 32-209. Plaintiffs do not dispute that four states prohibit
marriage by same-sex couples by statute only.
5.
A majority of states retain Constitutional provisions defining marriage as the
union of a man and a woman. See Alabama (Ala. Const. art. I, § 36.03), Alaska (Alaska Const.
art. 1, § 25), Arizona (Ariz. Const. art. XXX, § 1), Arkansas (Ark. Const. amend. 83, §§ 1-3),
Colorado (Colo. Const. art. II, § 31), Florida (Fla. Const. art. I, § 27), Georgia (Ga. Const. art. I,
§ IV, ¶ I), Idaho (Idaho Const. art. III, § 28), Kansas (Kan. Const. art. XV, § 16), Kentucky (Ky.
Const. § 233a), Louisiana (La. Const. art. XII, § 15), Michigan (Mich. Const. art I, § 25),
Mississippi (Miss. Const. art. XIV), Missouri (Mo. Const. art. I, § 33), Montana (Mont. Const.
art. XIII, § 7), Nebraska (Neb. Const. art. I, § 29), North Carolina (N.C. Const. art. XIV, § 6),
North Dakota (N.D. Const. art. XI, § 28), Ohio (Ohio Const. art. XV, § 11), Oklahoma (Okla.
Const. art. II, § 35), Oregon (Or. Const. art. XV, § 5a), South Carolina (S.C. Const. art. XVII, §
15), South Dakota (S.D. Const. art. XXI, § 9), Tennessee (Tenn. Const. art. XI, § 18), Texas
(Tex. Const. art. I, § 32), Utah (Utah Const. art. I, § 29), Virginia (Va. Const. art. I, § 15-A), and
Wisconsin (Wis. Const. art. XIII, § 13).
RESPONSE: Plaintiffs do not dispute State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 5.
However, several of these Constitutional provisions have been declared unconstitutional.
II. Marriage in Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Marriage Amendment.

V. Presidential and Supreme Court Justice Statements Regarding Same-Sex
Marriage.
28.
President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) on September
21, 1996. His signing statement on DOMA was:
Throughout my life I have strenuously opposed discrimination of any
kind, including discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans. I am
signing into law H.R. 3396, a bill relating to same-gender marriage, but it
is important to note what this legislation does and does not do.
I have long opposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages
and this legislation is consistent with that position. The Act confirms the
right of each state to determine its own policy with respect to same gender
marriage and clarifies for purposes of federal law the operative meaning of
the terms “marriage” and “spouse”.
This legislation does not reach beyond those two provisions. It has no
effect on any current federal, state or local anti-discrimination law and
does not constrain the right of Congress or any state or locality to enact
anti-discrimination laws. I therefore would take this opportunity to urge
Congress to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, an act which
would extend employment discrimination protections to gays and lesbians
in the workplace. This year the Senate considered this legislation
contemporaneously with the Act I sign today and failed to pass it by a
single vote. I hope that in its next Session Congress will pass it
expeditiously.
I also want to make clear to all that the enactment of this legislation should
not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be
understood to provide an excuse for discrimination, violence or
intimidation against any person on the basis of sexual orientation.
6

Discrimination, violence and intimidation for that reason, as well as
others, violate the principle of equal protection under the law and have no
place in American society.

President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage on May 9, 2012, after nearly two
years of saying that his views on same-sex marriage were “evolving.” See “Obama Says SameSex Marriage Should Be Legal,” New York Times (5/9/12), available at,

RESPONSE: Plaintiffs do not dispute State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 29.
30.
Taking the prudent, cautious approach to a divisive social has also been endorsed
by Justice Ginsburg in speeches; she stressed the virtues of “judicial restraint,” and allowing
“change [to] develop in the political process.” See Jason Keyser, “Ginsburg Says Roe gave
Abortion Opponents Target,” Associated Press (May 11, 2013), available at
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ginsburg-says-roe-gave-abortion-opponents-target, last checked
4/28/14. See also App. Tab No. 18.
RESPONSE: Dispute. State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 30 distorts Justice
Ginsburg’s remarks. The full sentence regarding the political process states that “‘The
court can put its stamp of approval on the side of change and let that change develop in
the political process,’ she said.” (emphasis added). Moreover, Justice Ginsberg’s
statement regarding “judicial restraint” concerned what she thought would have been the
best approach for the Court to take regarding abortion in Roe v. Wade. It did not address
marriage for same-sex couples.
31.
In oral arguments for Hollingsworth v. Perry before the Supreme Court, Justice
Sotomayor asked Respondents’ counsel Theodore Olsen the following question:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being
asked -- and -- and it is one that I’m interested in the answer: If you say
that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever
exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of
people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the
mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept
that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a
child until they’re of age to marry, but what’s left?

46:9-19, available at http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12144a.pdf, last checked 4/28/14. See also App. Tab No. 19.

RESPONSE: Dispute. Proposed Fact No. 31 is incomplete. Theodore Olsen responded
to Justice Sotomayor by saying that the Supreme Court had identified several rational
bases to prohibit polygamous or incestuous marriages, including concerns about
“exploitation, abuse, [and] patriarchy.” Hollingsworth Trans. at 46:20-25.
VI. Social Science Research.
32.
No meaningful conclusions can be drawn from social science research into the
effect that being raised by same-sex parents has on children because of serious methodological
flaws in the research. Douglas W. Allen, More Heat Than Light: A Critical Assessment of the
Gay
Parenting
Literature,
1995-2010
(April
2012),

1,
available
at
http://www.ruthinstitute.org/ITAF12/faculty/readings/SSParentingHJLPP.pdf, last checked
5/7/14. See also App. Tab No. 20.
RESPONSE: Dispute. State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 32 incorrectly describes the
state of social science research on children raised by same-sex couples, and is not
supported by the evidence cited. Every major pediatric, mental health, and child welfare
organization has agreed with the scientific consensus that children raised by same-sex
parents are as well-adjusted as those raised by different-sex parents. Brief of American
Psychological Ass’n, et al., as Amici Curiae on the Merits in Support of Affirmance,
United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, (No. 12-307), 2013 WL 8719858, at *14-26;
Brief of the American Sociological Ass’n in Support of Respondent Kristin M. Perry and
Respondent Edith Schlain Windsor, Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2653 (2013), and
Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, (Nos. 12-144, 12-307), 2013 WL 840004, at *6-14. Courts
that have heard from experts in the field have endorsed the validity of these scientific
findings. See, e.g., DeBoer v. Snyder, 2014 WL 1100794, at *4 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 21,
2014).
Douglas W. Allen’s paper is an advocacy piece, rather than a peer-reviewed study, and he
was thoroughly discredited as an expert regarding the research with respect to parenting
by same-sex couples by the DeBoer court. The paper is published by The Ruth Institute,
which says its purpose is “cleaning up the mess of the sexual revolution” and one of its
core values is “[m]arriage as a life long commitment between one man and one woman.”
Ruth Institute, available at http://www.ruthinstitute.org/about/aboutRuth.shtml (last
visited May 15, 2014). The DeBoer court concluded that Allen “represent[s] a fringe
viewpoint that is rejected by the vast majority of their colleagues across a variety of
social sciences field.” DeBoer, 2014 WL 1100794, at *10.
33.
Because the conclusions from social science research are not empirically
warranted, any consensus in social science on gay parenting outcomes is premature. See id.
RESPONSE: Dispute. State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 33 is an opinion. It also
inaccurately describes the current consensus in social science regarding parenting by
same-sex couples. See Plaintiffs’ RESPONSE to Proposed Finding of Fact No. 32.
34.
The newness and complexity of same-sex parenting means social scientists are
currently unable to draw meaningful conclusions about its impact on children. See Loren Marks,

“Same-sex parenting and children’s outcomes: a closer examination of the American
psychological associations brief on lesbian and gay parenting,” Social Science Research 41
(2012) 735-751, available at www.baylorisr.org/wp-content/uploads/Marks.pdf, last checked
5/7/14. See also App. Tab No. 21.
RESPONSE: Dispute. State Defendants’ Proposed Fact No. 34 is an opinion, not a fact,
and is not supported by the evidence cited. Loren Marks’ paper failed to consider any
studies after 2005 and his “wholesale rejection of an entire body of research fails to
recognize the realities of scientific knowledge” in the parenting research field. Am.
Psychological Ass’n Amicus Br., 20013 WL 8719858, at *28 n. 49. Moreover, the
journal Social Science Research, where the Marks paper was originally published, later
conducted an internal audit of the editorial process and the professor who conducted the
audit concluded that the Marks paper should never have been published. D. Sherkat, The
Editorial Process and Politicized Scholarship: Monday Morning Editorial
Quarterbacking and a Call for Scientific Vigilance, 41 Soc. Sci Res. 1346 (2012). Along
with Douglas Allen, Loren Marks was described by the DeBoer court as “represent[ing] a
fringe viewpoint that is rejected by the vast majority of their colleagues across a variety
of social sciences field.” DeBoer, 2014 WL 1100794, at *10.

RESPONSE: Dispute. Proposed Fact No. 35 distorts the findings of the paper it cites.
Moore, et al., did not look at parenting by same-sex or adoptive different-sex parents, and
specifically advised that “no conclusions can be drawn from this research about the wellbeing of children raised by same-sex parents or adoptive parents.” See id. at 1.
36. “[R]esearch clearly demonstrates that family structure matters for children, and the
family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents in a
low-conflict marriage. . . . There is . . . value for children in promoting strong, stable marriages
between biological parents.” Id. at 6.
RESPONSE: Dispute. Proposed Fact No. 36 similarly distorts the findings of the paper
it cites. Moore, et al., did not look at parenting by same-sex or adoptive different-sex
parents, and specifically advised that “no conclusions can be drawn from this research
about the well-being of children raised by same-sex parents or adoptive parents.” See id.

(November 2003), 2003 WLNR 12921714. See also App. Tab No. 23.

RESPONSE: Dispute. Proposed Fact No. 36 distorts the findings of the paper it cites.
Manning, et al., compared parenting by married biological parents to that of married and
cohabiting step-families and single mothers. Id. at 1-2. The study did not look at samesex couples.

divorce laws increased the divorce rate, by one estimate as much as 88 percent. More typically,
studies estimate no fault divorce increased divorce rates on the order of 10 percent.” See Prof.

39. “[T]he science of human sexuality is in its infancy and that there is currently little
conclusive evidence that sexuality is genetically or hormonally induced. . . . [T]he innateness of
sexual orientation is a poor metric upon which to formulate policy or law. Indeed, arguments for
policies that affirm equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexuality, need not rely on
questions of origin.” See Joseph Osmundson, “‘I Was Born this Way’: Is Sexuality Innate, and
Should it Matter?” LGBTQ Policy Journal at the Harvard Kennedy School: 2011 Edition, at

RESPONSE: Dispute. The second sentence of Proposed Fact No. 29 is taken out of
context to suggest something different from what the author intended. He wrote that “the
concept of innateness of sexuality, at it is currently understood, has serious ramifications
for the rights of the LGBT community.” App. Tab No. 25, at Conclusion. He uses the
word “innateness” to describe a “biological understanding of sexuality” and agrees that
“[s]exuality is an integral part of human identity and should not be the basis for
discrimination.” Id. In addition, there is scientific consensus that sexual orientation
cannot be changed either by a decision-making process or by medical intervention. See

VIII. Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission.
48. Plaintiffs Wallman and Borden’s California marriage is not “void” and has not been
nullified. (See Plaintiffs’ Responses to State Defendants’ First Set of Requests for Admission
(“Rqst. Admit”), No. 30 (admitting they “subjectively consider themselves to be a married
couple”)). See also App. Tab No. 26.

RESPONSE: Dispute. This proposed finding of fact is vague and ambiguous, and is not
supported by the evidence cited. In Request to Admit #30, Plaintiffs stated that
Wallmann and Borden “subjectively see themselves as married regardless of the
Wisconsin Marriage Amendment.” Dkt #104-1 at 13 (emphasis added). Further,
Wallmann and Borden’s subjective view of their relationship is unrelated to whether their
marriage is “void” for purposes of Wisconsin state law or in any other legal sense.
49. Plaintiffs Wallman and Borden’s California marriage has not been nullified. (See Dkt.
#95 at 16) (“The validity of Plaintiffs’ marriage in California is not at issue.”); see also Rqst.
Admit No. 32 (admitting Wisconsin has not annulled their marriage).
RESPONSE: Dispute. This proposed finding is not supported by the evidence cited.
Plaintiffs’ statement in their Repsonse to State Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss that “[t]he
validity of Plaintiffs’ marriage in California is not at issue” in this case does not
constitute evidence that Wallmann and Borden’s marriage has not been nullified for
purposes of Wisconsin law. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ Response to Request to Admit No. 32
does not support this proposed finding. Plaintiffs admitted only that the State of
Wisconsin had not annulled Wallmann and Borden’s marriage pursuant to a judicial
proceeding under Wis. Stat. s. 767.18 or 767.313, but denied that the marriage had not
been “annulled” under any other interpretation of that word.
