INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Virginia Wolf and Carol Schumacher, Kami Young and Karina Willes, Roy
Badger and Garth Wangemann, Charvonne Kemp and Marie Carlson, Judith Trampf and
Katharina Heyning, Salud Garcia and Pam Kleiss, William Hurtubise and Leslie Palmer, and
Johannes Wallmann and Keith Borden (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge the validity of Article XIII, § 13 of the Constitution of Wisconsin, as
well as all provisions of Wisconsin’s marriage statutes that could be construed to constitute a
statutory ban on marriage for same-sex couples (collectively with Article XIII, § 13, the
“marriage ban”), under the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs Wolf and Schumacher and
Young and Willes seek recognition of their legally contracted out-of-state marriage by the State
of Wisconsin; Plaintiffs Badger and Wangemann, Kemp and Carlson, Trampf and Heyning,
Garcia and Kleiss, and Hurtubise and Palmer seek the freedom to marry in Wisconsin to affirm
publicly the love they have for each other and the mutual commitments they have made; and
Plaintiffs Wallmann and Borden seek to remain married in Wisconsin, rather than have their
existing marriage voided. In addition, Plaintiffs Wolf and Schumacher and Young and Willes
seek protection from prosecution under Wisconsin’s marriage evasion statute, which subjects
them to potential criminal penalties for marrying outside the State.1
Wisconsin’s marriage ban violates the United States Constitution in four ways. First, as
alleged in Count One of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, the ban violates the Due Process Clause
by interfering with the fundamental right of gay and lesbian people to marry the person of their

1

Defendants King and Chisholm, represented by the Attorney General, concede that the marriage
evasion statute cannot be applied to resident same-sex couples who have left Wisconsin to marry. See
March 11, 2014 Stipulation (Dkt # 55-1). Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a declaration to that
effect. In addition, Plaintiffs note that without a ruling from this Court, these Defendants’ concession is
not binding on district attorneys in other counties in Wisconsin and may not be binding on future
attorneys general.

1

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 12 of 50

choice. Second, as alleged in Count Two, the marriage ban violates the fundamental right of
married same-sex couples who move to Wisconsin to keep their existing marriage, rather than
have the State nullify that marriage against their will.

Third, as alleged in Count Three,

Wisconsin’s prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples violates the Equal Protection Clause
because the ban treats people differently on the basis of their sex, but is neither narrowly tailored
nor the least restrictive alternative to further a compelling or important government interest.
Fourth, as alleged in Count Four, the marriage ban classifies on the basis of sexual orientation,
which should be treated as a constitutionally suspect basis for legislative classification, but bears
no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest, and thus fails to satisfy any level of equal
protection scrutiny.
Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on all counts in their amended complaint.

The

material facts in this matter are undisputed, and because the marriage ban violates the U.S.
Constitution in the ways described above, Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
FACTS
Marriage in the United States has evolved considerably as an institution. At different
times in this country’s history, states have employed various mechanisms to prohibit certain
people from marrying, such as slaves and interracial couples, and also to make a woman the
subordinate marital partner, legally barred from controlling her own finances and property.
Nancy F. Cott, Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 4-7 (2002). Wisconsin,
however, once had a laudable history of supporting the freedom to marry on equal terms. For
example, Wisconsin never banned marriage between people of different races. See David H.
Fowler, Northern Attitudes Towards Interracial Marriage: Legislation and Public Opinion in the
Middle Atlantic and the States of the Old Northwest 1780-1930 336 (1987). In 1850, Wisconsin
became one of the first states to enact legislation to protect the property rights of married
2

women. Joseph Ranney, “Abraham Lincoln’s Legacy to Wisconsin Law, Part 1: A New Birth of
Freedom: Civil Rights Law in Wisconsin,” 81 Wis. Law. 12, 20, 59 (Dec. 2008). By the early
twentieth century, Wisconsin had lifted many other legal restrictions on a married woman’s
ability to exercise financial independence from her husband. See In re Ray’s Will, 205 N.W.
917, 918 (1925) (citing Wis. Stat. 1925, §§ 246.01-246.11) (“Under the Married Woman’s Act
she now has the power to convey her interest, and that power reduces what would be an estate by
entirety at common law to a mere joint tenancy.”).
Despite its history as a leader in marriage equality, Wisconsin now has one of the most
restrictive bans on marriage for same-sex couples in the nation. Article XIII, § 13 of the
Wisconsin Constitution provides: “Only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be
valid or recognized as a marriage in this state. A legal status identical or substantially similar to
that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized in this state.” Wis.
Const. Art. XIII, § 13. As a result of this marriage ban, two people who love each other and
wish to commit to each other and build a life and family together are prohibited from marrying in
Wisconsin and denied recognition of their existing marriage entered legally under the laws of
another jurisdiction, including a marriage of long standing, if they are of the same sex. Further,
while two states that border Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa, permit a same-sex couple to marry
and a third, Illinois, will do so by June, Wisconsin law makes it a crime to leave the State to
contract a marriage that would be void or prohibited here. Wis. Stat. § 765.30(1)(a).
Plaintiffs Virginia Wolf and Carol Schumacher, Kami Young and Karina Willes, Roy
Badger and Garth Wangemann, Charvonne Kemp and Marie Carlson, Judith “Judi” Trampf and
Katharina “Katy” Heyning, Salud Garcia and Pam Kleiss, William Hurtubise and Leslie “Dean”
Palmer, and Johannes Wallmann and Keith Borden (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) are all loving,

committed, same-sex couples. Plaintiffs’ Proposed Findings of Fact in Support of Their Motion
for Summary Judgment (“Findings of Fact”) ¶ 5.
Virginia Wolf and Carol Schumacher, as well as Kami Young and Karina Willes, are
legally married under the laws of Minnesota. Findings of Fact ¶¶ 6-7. They wish to have their
marriages recognized in Wisconsin. Id. They are similarly situated in all relevant respects to
different-sex couples whose validly contracted out-of-state marriages are recognized in
Wisconsin. But for the fact that they are a same-sex couple, Wisconsin would regard their
marriage as valid in this State. In addition, because they married in another state, Plaintiffs
Wolf, Schumacher, Young and Willes risk criminal prosecution under Wis. Stat. § 765.30(1)(a),
which makes it a criminal offense to leave the State to enter into a marriage that is considered
void or prohibited here.
Roy Badger and Garth Wangemann, Charvonne Kemp and Marie Carlson, Judi Trampf
and Katy Heyning, Salud Garcia and Pam Kleiss, and Bill Hurtubise and Dean Palmer wish to
marry in Wisconsin. Findings of Fact ¶¶ 8-12. They are similarly situated in all relevant
respects to different-sex couples who wish to marry in this State. But for the fact that they are
same-sex couples, they would be permitted to marry here.
Johannes Wallmann and Keith Borden wish to be allowed to continue to live as a married
couple as they did for four years in California, where their Canadian marriage was recognized.
Findings of Fact ¶¶ 13, 40. They are similarly situated in all relevant respects to different-sex
married couples who move from one state to another.
All Plaintiff couples are harmed by the State of Wisconsin’s denial to them of the
freedom to marry. Findings of Fact ¶ 28. They are denied the full complement of state law
protections and obligations that are accorded to different-sex married couples. Findings of Fact

¶ 29. The unmarried Plaintiffs are also denied all federal spousal protections and obligations,
and the married Plaintiffs are denied those federal spousal protections and obligations that are
reserved to couples whose marriages are recognized in their state of residence. Findings of Fact
¶¶ 30-31. Further, the unmarried Plaintiffs are in a Catch-22, because while they might access
some federal benefits by marrying in another state, they are deterred from doing so by the fear of
prosecution in Wisconsin. Findings of Fact ¶ 32.
This denial of the legal protections of marriage is not an abstract matter. Plaintiffs Kami
Young and Karina Willes will shortly suffer a devastating harm as a result of the marriage ban.
Kami and Karina are expecting a daughter in April. Findings of Fact ¶ 23. Under the law as it
stands now, Wisconsin will refuse to recognize Karina as the baby’s parent as it would if their
marriage were recognized. Karina will have no legal connection whatsoever to the baby. In fact,
as far as the law is concerned, Karina and the baby will be strangers. Id. In contrast, if Kami
and Karina’s marriage were recognized, Karina would automatically be recognized as the baby’s
parent pursuant to Wisconsin law’s presumption of parenthood for children born to married
couples. See Wis. Stat. §§ 891.40(1), 891.41(1); see also Findings of Fact ¶ 23. And although
adoption should be unnecessary if Kami and Karina’s marriage were recognized, Wisconsin law
does not allow Karina to secure her parental rights through a step-parent adoption. Wis. Stat.
§ 48.82; Findings of Fact ¶ 24. Nor will Wisconsin allow Karina to take advantage of the
second-parent adoption process available in many other states. Kami and Karina will be deprived
of access to the same legal protections of their parental relationship with their child that are
available to married couples, for no other reason than that they are the same sex. Findings of
Fact ¶ 25.

5

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 16 of 50

Bill Hurtubise and Dean Palmer are suffering a similar harm. They elected to have Dean
adopt two of their children on his own because they were advised during the foster-to-adopt
process that in Wisconsin, an unmarried couple could not jointly adopt a child. See Wis. Stat.
§ 48.82(1); see also Findings of Fact ¶ 26. As a result, Bill is only a legal guardian to those
children and not a full legal parent. Findings of Fact ¶ 26. They plan to formally adopt their
third child as well, but still face the obstacle of being unmarried. Id. Like Kami and Karina,
they are not afforded the same legal protections for their parental relationship that married
couples who become parents enjoy.
Other Plaintiffs have experienced tangible harms from the State’s denial to them of the
protections and benefits of marriage. Garth Wangemann and Roy Badger discovered first-hand
how little protection their relationship receives when Garth was ill and Roy was designated to
make health care decisions on his behalf. Garth had executed a health-care power-of-attorney
giving Roy the authority to carry out Garth’s wishes, but Garth’s father looked for ways to
override that authority and take the decisions out of Roy’s hands. Findings of Fact ¶ 39. If Roy
had been Garth’s spouse, such an effort would have been virtually unthinkable. Judi Trampf and
Katy Heyning had a similar experience when, on a trip to New Orleans, Katy became ill and Judi
was told that without a power-of-attorney in hand (the signed, executed document was at home
in Wisconsin), she would not be allowed to make decisions on Katy’s behalf. Id. Married
spouses virtually never encounter such disrespect for their relationships or such suspicion about
their legal arrangements.
Plaintiffs have been denied family leave (Findings of Fact ¶ 38), spousal health care
coverage (Findings of Fact ¶¶ 28, 38), and crucial legal protections for their parental

6

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 17 of 50

relationships with their children (Findings of Fact ¶¶ 23-26), all as a result of Wisconsin’s refusal
to allow them to marry or to recognize their legal marriages.
Keith Borden and Johannes Wallmann have effectively had their existing marriage
voided for purposes of Wisconsin law. After living as a married couple for more than four years
in California and relying on the protections and obligations accorded to married couples there—
filing joint state tax returns, accumulating marital property, and relying on that state’s intestacy
laws—they arrived in Wisconsin only to have this State treat their relationship as a legal nullity.
Findings of Fact ¶ 40.
Furthermore, all Plaintiffs suffer the ongoing harm and indignity of the State’s
denigration of their relationships and their families. Findings of Fact ¶¶ 33-37. By withholding
from these couples the respect, recognition, and support that only marriage confers on a
relationship, Wisconsin stigmatizes these couples and their families as unworthy of the
opportunity to express and legally embody their commitment in the most serious way that society
provides. Findings of Fact ¶¶ 34-35. The State’s disrespect invites others to denigrate Plaintiffs’
relationships as well. Findings of Fact ¶ 38. The State of Wisconsin inflicts these harms for no
other reason than these couples’ sexual orientation and their sex.
LEGAL STANDARD
“Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Alexander v. Casino Queen,
Inc., 739 F.3d 972, 978 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and Fleishman v. Continental
Cas. Co., 698 F.3d 598, 603 (7th Cir. 2012)).
ARGUMENT
Several district courts have already recognized that bans on marriage by same-sex
couples violate both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States
7

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 18 of 50

Constitution. Plaintiffs here are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all four counts of their
amended complaint on the same basis. The ban violates the Due Process Clause in that it
interferes with both the fundamental right to marry the person of one’s choice and the
fundamental right to keep one’s existing marriage. The ban also violates the Equal Protection
Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it classifies on the basis of both sex and sexual
orientation, but is neither narrowly tailored nor the least restrictive means to further a compelling
state interest. And even if the marriage ban is subject to the lesser scrutiny of rational basis
review, it is still wanting because it is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest.
I.

The Marriage Ban Violates The Due Process Clause By Interfering With The
Fundamental Rights To Marry And Remain Married.
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution

provides that no “State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.”

U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1.

The guarantee of due process protects

individuals from arbitrary governmental intrusion into fundamental rights. See, e.g., Washington
v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719-20 (1997). Under the Due Process Clause, when legislation
burdens the exercise of a right deemed to be fundamental, the government must show that the
intrusion “is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to
effectuate only those interests.” Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 388 (1978). Wisconsin’s
marriage ban does not comport with these requirements.

It interferes, without adequate

justification, with both the fundamental right to marry and the fundamental right to remain
married.

A.

The Marriage Ban Violates The Fundamental Right To Marry The Person
Of One’s Choice.
1.

The freedom to marry is a fundamental right belonging to the
individual.

It is beyond dispute that the freedom to marry is a fundamental right protected by the Due
Process Clause. See, e.g., Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95 (1987) (“[T]he decision to marry is a
fundamental right,” and marriage is an “expression[] of emotional support and public
commitment.”); Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 384 (“The right to marry is of fundamental importance for
all individuals.”); Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 639-40 (1974) (“This Court
has long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one
of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”); Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (“The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the
vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”); Griswold v.
Conn., 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965) (“Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse,
hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes
a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not
commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in
our prior decisions.”).
While states have a legitimate interest in regulating and promoting marriage, the
fundamental right to choose one’s spouse belongs to the individual. “[T]he regulation of
constitutionally protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he or she shall
marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns other than disagreement with the choice
the individual has made.” Hodgson v. Minn., 497 U.S. 417, 435 (1990) (emphasis added); see
also Loving, 388 U.S. at 12 (“Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a
person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.”);
9

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 20 of 50

Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 620 (1984) (“[T]he Constitution undoubtedly imposes
constraints on the State’s power to control the selection of one’s spouse. . . .”).
2.

The scope of a fundamental right under the due process clause does
not depend on who has exercised that right in the past.

Plaintiffs wish to marry or to have their marriages recognized by the State of Wisconsin.
That they have historically been excluded from the institution of marriage is not a reason to
continue that discrimination. In Loving, the court did not defer to the historical exclusion of
mixed-race couples from marriage. “Instead, the Court recognized that race restrictions, despite
their historical prevalence, stood in stark contrast to the concepts of liberty and choice inherent in
the right to marry.” Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 992 (N.D. Cal. 2010),
appeal dismissed sub nom. Perry v. Brown, 725 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2013). As the federal
district court observed in its recent decision striking down Utah’s marriage ban, “[i]nstead of
declaring a new right to interracial marriage, the Court held that individuals could not be
restricted from exercising their existing right to marry on account of the race of their chosen
partner.” Kitchen v. Herbert, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2013 WL 6697874, at *15 (D. Utah Dec. 20,
2013).
Indeed, the Supreme Court has never defined the right to marry by reference to those
permitted to exercise that right. Thus, the Supreme Court addresses “the fundamental right to
marry” in its decisions, see Loving, 388 U.S. at 12; Turner, 482 U.S. at 94-96; Zablocki, 434
U.S. at 383-86; not “the right to interracial marriage,” “the right to inmate marriage,” or “the
right of people owing child support to marry.” Accord In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 421
n.33 (Cal. 2008) (Turner “did not characterize the constitutional right at issue as ‘the right to
inmate marriage.’”).

10

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 21 of 50

Similarly, in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the Court held that the “liberty of
persons” (including same-sex couples) to form personal and intimate relationships with a person
of the same sex is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of liberty,
notwithstanding the historical existence of sodomy laws and their use against gay people. The
Court explained that its decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), was flawed
because it failed to appreciate the “extent of the liberty at stake” by focusing on “whether the
Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy,”
rather than to consider the “far reaching consequences” of the right at stake, which “touch[es]
upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the
home.” Lawrence, 539 U.S at 566-67 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, Plaintiffs
do not seek a new right to same-sex marriage, but rather seek to remove the marriage ban, which
prevents Plaintiffs from exercising the same right to marry enjoyed by different-sex couples, and
does so merely on account of the sex of their chosen partner. The right to marry is fundamental,
deeply rooted in this nation’s history and tradition for the purposes of constitutional protection,
even though same-sex couples have not historically been allowed to exercise that right.
“[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the
substantive due process inquiry.” Id. at 572 (citation omitted). While courts use history and
tradition to identify the interests that due process protects, they do not carry forward historical
limitations, either traditional or arising by operation of prior law, on which Americans may
exercise a fundamental right once that right is recognized as one that due process protects. This
critical distinction—that history guides the what of due process rights, but not the who of which
individuals may exercise them—is central to due process jurisprudence. “[F]undamental rights,

11

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 22 of 50

once recognized, cannot be denied to particular groups on the ground that those groups have
historically been denied those rights.” In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 430.
In addition, the State’s due process violation is not ameliorated by the fact that the
marriage ban in theory allows each Plaintiff to marry a person of the opposite sex. The court
struck down the interracial marriage ban at issue in Loving even though it allowed whites to
marry whites and non-whites to marry non-whites. Loving, 388 U.S. at 12 (“The Fourteenth
Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial
discriminations.”). As the Kitchen court noted, “The right to marry is not simply the right to
become a married person by signing a contract with someone of the opposite sex.” Kitchen,
2013 WL 6697874, at *13.
B.

The Marriage Ban Violates Plaintiffs’ Right To Remain Married.

The marriage ban not only denies same-sex couples the right to marry, it also purports to
nullify the existing legal rights and obligations of married same-sex couples, such as Plaintiffs
Johannes Wallmann and Keith Borden, by declaring that their marriages are not “valid” or
“recognized.” Wis. Const. Art. XIII, § 13. In practical effect, Johannes and Keith have been
divorced for state law purposes without their consent for as long as they live in Wisconsin. Basic
due process principles prohibit a state from capriciously interfering with an existing marriage in
this way.
Johannes and Keith married in Canada in 2007, where they had planned to live in
Toronto after moving from New York. Findings of Fact ¶ 13. They ended up moving instead to
California, because Johannes was offered a full-time teaching job there. Findings of Fact ¶ 40.
Under California law, their marriage was held to be valid and entitled to recognition. Strauss v.
Horton, 207 P.3d 48, 122 (Cal. 2009) (2008 constitutional amendment limiting marriages to men
and women did not apply retroactively to invalidate same-sex marriages performed prior to its
12

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 23 of 50

effective date); Cal. Fam. Code 308(b) (out-of-state same-sex marriages contracted prior to
November 5, 2008 were valid in California). Until they moved from California to Wisconsin in
2012, then, Johannes and Keith were a legally married couple, filing joint state tax returns,
providing Keith with spousal health insurance benefits on Johannes’s Cal State health insurance
plan, accumulating marital property, and taking comfort in the knowledge that, had it been
necessary, either one of them could have made critical health decisions on the other’s behalf.
Findings of Fact ¶ 40.
Established due process principles support the right to remain married—a liberty interest
in the ongoing existence of one’s marriage without inappropriate government interference—
which is complementary to, but distinguishable from, the right to marry itself. Steve Sanders,
“The Constitutional Right to (Keep Your) Same-Sex Marriage,” 110 Mich. L. Rev. 1421 (2012);
see also Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 397 n.1 (Powell, J., concurring) (observing that “there is a sphere
of privacy or autonomy surrounding an existing marital relationship into which the State may not
lightly intrude”); Obergefell v. Wymyslo, 2013 WL 6726688, at *6 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2013)
(recognizing a same-sex couple’s right to remain married as “appropriately protected by the Due
Process Clause”).
This right to remain married is grounded in the principle that couples like Johannes and
Keith, who married in good faith and to whom the rights and responsibilities of marriage have
already attached, acquire important interests on which they are entitled to rely wherever they
may subsequently move. As the California Supreme Court observed, married couples “acquire[]
vested property rights as lawfully married spouses with respect to a wide range of subjects,
including, among many others, employment benefits, interests in real property, and
inheritances.” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 122. For this reason, the “place of celebration rule”—the

13

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 24 of 50

principle that a marriage’s validity should be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where it
was celebrated, not a subsequent domicile—is deeply rooted in American legal history and
tradition. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 283(2) (1971). Indeed, “[i]f two
people who were once married are suddenly rendered legal strangers to one another,” as the
Wisconsin marriage ban would do to Johannes and Keith for state law purposes, “property rights
are potentially altered, spouses disinherited, children put at risk, and financial, medical, and
personal plans and decisions thrown into turmoil.” Sanders, supra, at 1450. See also In re
Campbell’s Estate, 260 Wis. 625, 631, 51 N.W.2d 709, 712 (1952) (“Marriages valid where
celebrated are valid everywhere.”) (citing Lanham v. Lanham, 136 Wis. 360, 117 N.W. 787
(1908); Owen v. Owen, 178 Wis. 609, 190 N.W. 363 (1922)).
A state may not impose such concrete and coercive harms on legally married couples
merely by fiat. As the Supreme Court has explained many times, the Due Process Clause
protects a “‘private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.’” Planned Parenthood of
Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992) (quoting Prince v. Mass., 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944)).
Where the government undertakes “intrusive regulation of the family” aimed at “forcing all to
live in certain narrowly defined family patterns,” judicial deference is inappropriate. Moore v.
City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499, 506 (1977) (plurality opinion). “[A] state interest in
standardizing its children and adults, making the ‘private realm of family life’ conform to some
state-designed ideal, is not a legitimate state interest at all.” Hodgson, 497 U.S. at 452. Just as a
state may not sever the legal relationship between parent and child without strong due process
protections, Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982), a state should not be allowed to
effectively nullify an existing legal relationship between two spouses with no due process
whatsoever.

14

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 25 of 50

Like all states, Wisconsin generally regulates domestic relations with the intention of
promoting stability and security in marital and family relationships, not undermining them. See
Wis. Stat. § 765.001(2) (“It is the intent of [Wisconsin’s Family Code] to promote the stability
and best interests of marriage and the family.”); see also Sanders, supra at 1465 (“Law
traditionally has validated marriages . . . because doing so protects the stability of legal
relationships, advances reasonable expectations, prevents the casual evasion of legal
responsibilities, and contributes to smooth functioning of the interstate system.”).

But

Wisconsin’s marriage ban stands as a stark, even perverse, exception to this policy. There can be
no possible interest sufficient to justify the marriage nullification that the ban imposes on couples
like Johannes and Keith.
In short, the freedom to marry, to have one’s lawful marriage recognized, and to remain
married are fundamental rights protected by the United States Constitution.

Wisconsin’s

marriage ban prevents lesbians and gay men from marrying and denies recognition to those who
have legally married under the laws of other jurisdictions, and therefore violates their
fundamental rights. As discussed in Part III, infra, the marriage ban is not supported by any state
interest, let alone a “sufficiently important state interest” (Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 388) to justify
barring the Plaintiff couples from exercising their fundamental right to marry.

Therefore,

Wisconsin’s marriage ban violates due process by effectively nullifying the protections and
recognition of marriages upon which couples like Keith and Johannes have come to rely without
sufficient justification, and must be struck down.
II.

The Marriage Ban Denies Plaintiffs Equal Protection Of The Laws.
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States

Constitution provides that “[n]o State . . . [shall] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1. In addition to violating the Due
15

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 26 of 50

Process clause, Wisconsin’s marriage ban also violates the Equal Protection Clause in two ways.
First, the ban discriminates on the basis of sex both by classifying individuals based on their
gender and by subjecting individuals to sex stereotyping. Second, the ban discriminates on the
basis of sexual orientation.
A.

The Marriage Ban Denies Plaintiffs Equal Protection Of The Laws On The
Basis Of Sex.

Wisconsin’s marriage ban discriminates on the basis of sex, in violation of the Equal
Protection Clause, both because (1) the law facially discriminates on the basis of sex and (2) the
law subjects Plaintiffs to sex stereotyping. Laws that classify on the basis of sex are subject to
heightened scrutiny.
1.

The marriage ban facially discriminates on the basis of sex.

Wisconsin’s marriage ban, on its face and as applied, discriminates on the basis of sex.2
Each Plaintiff would be able to marry his or her partner if the Plaintiff were of a different sex.
Consequently, Plaintiffs’ own sex precludes them from marrying the individual of their
choosing. A law that restricts marriage based on a person’s sex is facially discriminatory. See
Kitchen, 2013 WL 6697874, at *20; Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 996; Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44,
64 (Haw. 1993) (Hawaii marriage statute “on its face and as applied regulates access to the
marital status and its concomitant rights and benefits on the basis of the applicants’ sex.”), aff’d,
950 P.2d 1234 (Haw. 1997).3

2

It makes perfect sense that a ban on same-sex marriage constitutes both a sex and sexual
orientation classification, since an individual’s sexual orientation is defined based on the sex of the person
to whom the individual is physically and emotionally attracted and with whom the person forms a
committed intimate relationship.
3
Initially, Baehr was a plurality decision of two of the five judges, with a third judge concurring
on different grounds, and the case was ordered remanded for trial to determine whether the state had a
compelling justification for the exclusion. Before the case was remanded, however, one of the two
dissenting judges was replaced, and the court then ruled that on remand the trial would be conducted
“consistent with the plurality opinion,” which thereby became the opinion of the court. 852 P.2d at 74.

16

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 27 of 50

The marriage ban cannot be defended on the ground that it treats men and women equally
by denying the right to marry to both men (who wish to marry men) and women (who wish to
marry women). This argument, made with regard to race instead of sex, was squarely rejected in
Loving v. Virginia. In Loving, the State of Virginia argued that its anti-miscegenation laws did
not discriminate based on race because the prohibition against mixed-race marriage applied
equally to both black and white citizens. 388 U.S. at 7-8. The Court rejected this argument,
holding that “the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy
burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state
statutes drawn according to race.” Id. at 9. See also McLaughlin v. Fla., 379 U.S. 184, 192-93
(1964) (holding that a race-related anti-cohabitation law was an unconstitutional racial
classification even though the law applied equally to white and black persons). As the court in
Kitchen recognized, “the fact of equal application to both men and women does not immunize
Utah’s Amendment 3 [which similarly denied the validity or recognition of marriages between
same-sex couples] from the heightened burden of justification that the Fourteenth Amendment
requires of state laws drawn according to sex.” Kitchen, 2013 WL 6697874, at *20.
Loving and McLaughlin cannot be cabined on a theory that those cases addressed race,
not sex. The same reasoning has clearly been applied to gender. See J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel. T.B.,
511 U.S. 127 (1994) (striking down preemptory challenges based on gender-based assumptions
as to both sexes, despite equal application of the rule as to men and women); see also Califano v.
Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 83-85 (1979) (classification can be sex-based even if the effects of its
application are felt equally by men and women). Nor can the marriage ban be defended on the
ground that it was not enacted with the intent to discriminate against either men or women. See
Loving, 388 U.S. at 11 n.11 (holding that Virginia’s ban on interracial marriage was

17

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 28 of 50

unconstitutional “even assuming an even-handed state purpose to protect the ‘integrity’ of all
races”); Johnson v. Cal., 543 U.S. 499, 506 (2005) (holding that California’s racially “neutral”
practice of segregating inmates by race when first incarcerated to avoid racial violence was a
race classification that had to be reviewed under strict scrutiny, notwithstanding the fact that
prison officials were not singling out one race for differential treatment).
2.

The marriage ban subjects Plaintiffs to sex stereotyping.

In addition to its overt discrimination on the basis of sex, the marriage ban also
perpetuates and enforces stereotypes regarding the expected and traditional roles of men and
women, namely that men marry and create families with women, and women marry and create
families with men. When government restricts men and women from participation in civil
society and its institutions based on sex stereotypes, it does so on the “basis of gender.” Price
Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989). See also White v. Fleming, 522 F.2d 730, 737
(7th Cir. 1975) (“[I]t is impermissible under the equal protection clause to classify on the basis of
stereotyped assumptions concerning propensities thought to exist in some members of a given
sex.”); Doe by Doe v. City of Belleville, 119 F.3d 563, 581 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding that “reliance
upon stereotypical notions about how men and women should appear and behave” “reasonably
suggests” that “a particular action . . . can be attributed to sex.”), vacated and remanded on other
grounds, City of Belleville v. Doe by Doe, 523 U.S. 1001 (1998).
To be clear, Plaintiffs do not advocate that traditional roles for men and women within
marriage be discarded, as some married men and women find happiness framing marriage
around such roles: some married women may take pride in culinary or childrearing skill, and
some married men may enjoy breadwinning. However, most spouses also deviate from sex
stereotypes to some degree: husbands may play an active role in childrearing, and wives may be

18

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 29 of 50

primary breadwinners, for example. What is important is that government may not enforce
conformity with traditional sex stereotypes. Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 250.
The Supreme Court has made emphatically clear that gender classifications cannot be
based on or validated by “fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.”
Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724-25 (1982).4 And in the context of parenting
responsibilities, the Supreme Court has rejected the notion of “any universal difference between
maternal and paternal relations at every phase of a child’s development.” Caban v. Mohammed,
441 U.S. 380, 388-89 (1979); see also Stanley v. Ill., 405 U.S. 645 (1972) (holding that a state
law presumption that unmarried fathers were unfit parents violated Due Process and Equal
Protection Clauses). The Court has also recognized that stereotypes about distinct parenting
roles for men and women foster discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere. Nev. Dep’t of
Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 736 (2003) (“Stereotypes about women’s domestic roles are
reinforced by parallel stereotypes presuming a lack of domestic responsibilities for men. . . .
These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that
forced women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, and fostered
employers’ stereotypical views about women’s commitment to work and their value as
employees.”). Thus, “generalizations about typical gender roles in the raising and nurturing of
children” are constitutionally insufficient bases for differential treatment of the sexes by the
government. Knussman v. Md., 272 F.3d 625, 636 (4th Cir. 2001) (upholding liability of state

As evidence that the ban is an instance of sex stereotyping, one of the frequently asserted
justifications for the restriction is the notion that “optimal parenting” requires two parents of different
sexes. See infra pp. 34-37. As the Supreme Court of Iowa explained: “the traditional notion that children
need a mother and a father to be raised into healthy, well-adjusted adults is based more on stereotypes
than anything else.” Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 899 n.26 (Iowa 2009).

agency under the Equal Protection Clause for failure to grant father paid leave as primary
caregiver for newborn).
3.

Laws denying equal protection on the basis of sex are subject to
heightened scrutiny that Wisconsin’s ban cannot satisfy.

It is well settled that laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are subject to heightened
scrutiny. Classifications based on sex can be sustained only where the government demonstrates
that they are “substantially related” to an “important governmental objective[.]” United States v.
Va., 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Toeller v. Wisc. Dept.
of Corr., 461 F.3d 871, 877 (7th Cir. 2006) (“[S]tatutory classifications that distinguish between
males and females are subject to heightened scrutiny” and “are valid only if they serve important
governmental objectives and employ measures that are substantially related to the achievement
of those objectives.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Nabozny v. Podlesny, 92 F.3d 446, 456
(7th Cir. 1996) (holding that it is “well settled that to survive constitutional scrutiny, gender
based discrimination must be substantially related to an important governmental objective”). As
discussed in Part III, infra, Wisconsin’s marriage ban cannot survive even rational basis review,
much less heightened scrutiny.
B.

The Marriage Ban Denies Plaintiffs Equal Protection Of The Laws On The
Basis Of Sexual Orientation.

Wisconsin’s marriage ban denies lesbians and gay men the equal protection of laws on
the basis of their sexual orientation. Laws that classify based on sexual orientation are subject to
heightened scrutiny. But even if the court were to apply rational basis review, the marriage ban
could not survive.
1.

The marriage ban discriminates on basis of sexual orientation.

Wisconsin’s marriage ban denies equal protection of the laws on the basis of sexual
orientation on its face. The ban states that “[o]nly a marriage between one man and one woman
20

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 31 of 50

shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” Wis. Const. Art. XIII, § 13. The
marriage ban further codifies the second-class status of same-sex couples by providing that “[a]
legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall
not be valid or recognized in this state,” ensuring that both the dignitary and substantive rights
associated with marriage are denied to lesbians and gay men. Id.
That Wisconsin’s marriage ban does not explicitly refer to sexual orientation is no
defense. As Justice O’Connor explained in Lawrence (concurring in the judgment on equal
protection grounds), “[w]hile it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted
by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual” so that “[t]hose harmed
by this law are people who have a same-sex sexual orientation.” 539 U.S. at 581, 583. The court
in Perry recognized the same notion in the context of marriage, explaining that “[t]hose who
choose to marry someone of the opposite sex—heterosexuals—do not have their choice of
marital partner restricted by [California’s marriage ban]. Those who would choose to marry
someone of the same sex—homosexuals—have had their right to marry eliminated by an
amendment to the state constitution.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 996. See also Christian Legal
Soc’y v. Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 2990 (2010) (“Our decisions have declined to distinguish
between status and conduct in [the context of sexual orientation].”). Because the Wisconsin law
targets conduct exclusively engaged in by lesbians and gay men, it discriminates on the basis of
sexual orientation.
2.

Laws denying equal protection on the basis of sexual orientation must
be subject to heightened scrutiny.

The Seventh Circuit has in the past applied rational basis review in cases of
discrimination based on sexual orientation. See, e.g., Schroeder v. Hamilton Sch. Dist., 282 F.3d
946, 950-51 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing cases, including Bowers, 478 U.S. 186, for the proposition
21

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 32 of 50

that “homosexuals do not enjoy any heightened protection under the Constitution” and therefore
must show that the law “was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.”). However, the
precedent supporting rational basis review for sexual orientation classifications, including
Schroeder, is called into question by Lawrence, 539 U.S. 558, which overturned Bowers v.
Hardwick. See Pedersen v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 881 F. Supp. 2d 294, 312 (D. Conn.
2012) (“The Supreme Court’s holding in Lawrence ‘remov[ed] the precedential underpinnings of
the federal case law supporting the defendants’ claim that gay persons are not a [suspect or]
quasi-suspect class.’”) (citations omitted); Golinski v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 824 F. Supp.
2d 968, 984 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (“[T]he reasoning in [prior circuit court decisions], that laws
discriminating against gay men and lesbians are not entitled to heightened scrutiny because
homosexual conduct may be legitimately criminalized, cannot stand post-Lawrence.”). For this
reason, the Court must visit anew the question of what level of scrutiny to apply to classifications
based on sexual orientation.5
After Lawrence, lower courts must apply the criteria mandated by the Supreme Court to
determine whether sexual orientation classifications should receive heightened scrutiny. These
criteria include:
A) whether the class has been historically “subjected to discrimination”; B)
whether the class has a defining characteristic that “frequently bears [a] relation to
ability to perform or contribute to society”; C) whether the class exhibits
“obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a
discrete group”; and D) whether the class is “a minority or politically powerless.”
Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 181 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S.
587, 602 (1987), and Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440-41 (1985)), aff’d
United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013). Of these considerations, the first two are the
5

The Seventh Circuit’s most recent application of the four-factor analysis to sexual orientation
predates Lawrence. See Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, 881 F.2d 454, 464-66 (7th Cir. 1989) (relying on Bowers
to conclude that gays and lesbians are not members of a suspect class).

22

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 33 of 50

most important. See id. (“Immutability and lack of political power are not strictly necessary
factors to identify a suspect class.”); accord Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 987.
As several federal and state courts have recently recognized, any faithful application of
those factors leads to the inescapable conclusion that sexual orientation classifications must be
recognized as suspect or quasi-suspect and subjected to heightened scrutiny. See, e.g., Windsor,
699 F.3d at 181-85; Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 985-90; Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 310-33;
Obergefell, 2013 WL 6726688, at *14-*18; Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 997; In re Balas, 449 B.R.
567, 573-75 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2011); Griego v. Oliver, 316 P.3d 865, 880-84 (N.M. 2013);
Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 885-96; In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 441-44; Kerrigan v. Comm’r
of Pub. Health, 957 A.2d 407, 425-31 (Conn. 2008). See also SmithKline Beecham Corp. v.
Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471, 480-84 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding heightened scrutiny applicable to
sexual orientation without examining the four factors).
Unequivocally, lesbians and gay men have historically been subjected to discrimination.
As the Second Circuit recognized in Windsor, “[i]t is easy to conclude that homosexuals have
suffered a history of discrimination. Windsor and several amici labor to establish and document
this history, but we think it is not much in debate.” 699 F.3d at 182. For centuries, the
prevailing attitude toward lesbians and gay men has been “one of strong disapproval, frequent
ostracism, social and legal discrimination, and at times ferocious punishment.” Richard A.
Posner, Sex and Reason 291 (1992); see also Nabozny, 92 F.3d at 457 n.10 (recognizing
“considerable discrimination leveled against homosexuals”). The existence of the marriage ban
itself, targeted at lesbians and gay men, is further evidence of discrimination.
Moreover, courts have agreed with near unanimity that homosexuality is irrelevant to
one’s ability to perform or contribute to society. “There are some distinguishing characteristics,

23

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 34 of 50

such as age or mental handicap, that may arguably inhibit an individual’s ability to contribute to
society, at least in some respect. But homosexuality is not one of them.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at
182; accord Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 986 (“[T]here is no dispute in the record or the law that
sexual orientation has no relevance to a person’s ability to contribute to society”); Pedersen, 881
F. Supp. 2d at 320 (same). In this respect, sexual orientation is akin to race, gender, alienage,
and national origin, all of which “are so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate
state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and
antipathy.” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.6
Third, the limited ability of gay people as a group to protect themselves in the political
process, although not essential for recognition as a suspect or quasi-suspect class, see Windsor,
699 F.3d at 181, also weighs in favor of heightened scrutiny. In analyzing this factor, “[t]he
question is not whether homosexuals have achieved political successes over the years; they
clearly have. The question is whether they have the strength to politically protect themselves
from wrongful discrimination.” Id. at 184. The political influence of lesbians and gay men
stands in sharp contrast to the political power of women in 1973, when a plurality of the Court
concluded in Frontiero v. Richardson that sex-based classifications required heightened scrutiny.
411 U.S. 677, 688 (1973). After all, Congress had already passed Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, both of which protect women from discrimination in
the workplace. See id. at 687-88. In contrast, there is still no express federal ban on sexual
orientation discrimination in employment, housing, or public accommodations, and 29 states
have no such protections either. See Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 988-89, Pedersen, 881 F. Supp.

6

Indeed, Wisconsin’s own antidiscrimination protections for gays and lesbians recognize that
sexual orientation is virtually never a relevant criterion in evaluating an individual. See Wis. Sess. Laws
ch. 112 § 901 (1981) (adding sexual orientation as a protected class to numerous Wisconsin
antidiscrimination statutes).

24

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 35 of 50

2d at 326-27. And over the past 20 years, more than two-thirds of ballot initiatives that proposed
to enact (or prevent the repeal of) basic antidiscrimination protections for gay and lesbian
individuals have failed. Indeed, gay people “have seen their civil rights put to a popular vote
more often than any other group.” Barbara S. Gamble, “Putting Civil Rights to a Popular Vote,”
41 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 245, 257 (1997); see also Donald P. Haider-Markel, et al., “Lose, Win, or
Draw?: A Reexamination of Direct Democracy and Minority Rights,” 60 Pol. Research Q. 304
(2007).
The marriage ban itself acts to lock same-sex couples out of the normal political process.
Wisconsin’s exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is the only marriage law enshrined in
the Wisconsin Constitution. Wis. Const. Art. XIII, § 13. Plaintiffs cannot simply lobby the
Wisconsin state legislature to remove the marriage ban through the ordinary political process.
Instead, they are uniquely burdened with having to amend the Wisconsin Constitution, a much
more difficult and cumbersome process.

See Wis. Const. Art. XII, § 1 (governing the

amendment process). A selective disparity in the ability to advocate for a change in the law,
disadvantaging a single class of people, is constitutionally suspect. See Wash. v. Seattle Sch.
Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 483-84 (1982) (laws that subject “one group” to a “debilitating and
often insurmountable disadvantage” in enacting legislation are constitutionally suspect); Hunter
v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 393 (1969) (“[T]he State may no more disadvantage any particular
group by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person’s
vote or give any group a smaller representation than another of comparable size.”).
Finally, sexual orientation is an “immutable” characteristic. Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602.
The Seventh Circuit has noted that an “immutable or fundamental characteristic might be
membership in an extended family, sexual orientation, a former association with a controversial

25

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 36 of 50

group, or membership in a group whose ideas or practices run counter to the cultural or social
convention of the country. The latter group might seem plausibly alterable, but we respect an
individual’s right to maintain characteristics that are fundamental to their individual identities.”
Cece v. Holder, 733 F.3d 662, 669 (7th Cir. 2013) (citation and quotation marks omitted)
(emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit’s view is consistent with a broad medical and scientific
consensus that sexual orientation is immutable. See Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 966 (“No credible
evidence supports a finding that an individual may, through conscious decision, therapeutic
intervention or any other method, change his or her sexual orientation.”); accord Golinski, 824 F.
Supp. 2d at 986; Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 320-24. It is also consistent with the Supreme
Court’s recognition that sexual orientation is so fundamental to a person’s identity that one ought
not be forced to choose between one’s sexual orientation and one’s rights as an individual—even
if such a choice could be made. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 576-77 (recognizing that individual
decisions by consenting adults concerning the intimacies of their physical relationships are “an
integral part of human freedom”).
Because classifications based on sexual orientation are suspect based on the factors
identified in Bowen and Cleburne, they should be subject to strict scrutiny. Classifications that
disadvantage a suspect class are “treated as presumptively invidious” and must be “precisely
tailored to serve a compelling government interest” to pass constitutional muster. Plyler v. Doe,
457 U.S. 202, 216-17 (1982).
III.

The Marriage Ban Is Unconstitutional Under Any Standard Of Review.
Wisconsin’s marriage ban fails any level of scrutiny. The marriage ban cannot survive

heightened scrutiny because the State cannot meet its burden of demonstrating that the ban is
necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest, let alone that the ban is precisely tailored
so as to use the least restrictive means consistent with the attainment of that interest. The
26

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 37 of 50

marriage ban fails even rational basis review because it bears no rational relationship to any
legitimate state interest.
Even rational basis review requires a serious analysis of the statute and the asserted
justifications; it is not sufficient for the government to simply assert the existence of means and
ends for its actions. As the Supreme Court recognized in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632
(1996), “even in the ordinary equal protection case calling for the most deferential of standards,
we insist on knowing the relation between the classification adopted and the object to be
attained” (emphasis added). See also Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446 (holding that a state “may not
rely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the
distinction arbitrary or irrational”). It is this “search for the link between classification and
objective” that “gives substance to the Equal Protection Clause” and “provides guidance and
discipline for the legislature.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632. The requirement “that the classification
bear a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end . . . ensure[s] that
classifications are not drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.”
Id. at 633.
Rational basis review is not a rubber stamp for discrimination. There must be “a ‘rational
relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.’”
Wis. Educ. Ass’n Council v. Walker, 705 F.3d 640, 653 (7th Cir. 2013) (emphasis added)
(quoting Srail v. Vill. of Lisle, Ill., 588 F.3d 940, 946 (7th Cir. 2009)); see also Goodpaster v.
City of Indianapolis, 736 F.3d 1060, 1071 (7th Cir. 2013) (holding, regarding a city public
smoking ban, that “[r]ather than identify a rational reason for infringing on citizens’ ability to
smoke in public, we must identify a rational reason for the distinction the ordinance draws
between traditional bars and tobacco specialty bars.”); City of Chi. v. Shalala, 189 F.3d 598, 605

27

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 38 of 50

(7th Cir. 1999) (holding that the court must analyze the “disparity of treatment” and its
relationship to a “legitimate governmental purpose.”).
Numerous federal district courts have found that marriage bans violate rational basis
review. For example, in Bishop v. United States ex rel Holder, 2014 WL 116013 (N.D. Okla.
Jan. 14, 2014), the court considered all “conceivable justifications” for Oklahoma’s marriage
ban, including the State’s claims that the law “promot[ed] morality (id. at *26)7, “encourag[ed]
‘responsible procreation’” (id. at *28), “promot[ed] the ‘optimal’ child-rearing environment” (id.
at *30), and prevented the “fundamental[] redefin[ition] of marriage [which] could have a severe
and negative impact on the institution as a whole” (id. at *32). The court considered each of the
purported justifications and concluded “that exclusion of same-sex couples [from marriage] is
‘so attenuated’ from any of these goals that the exclusion cannot survive rational basis review.”
Id. at *33. The district courts in Perry, 704 F. Supp. at 997-1003, Kitchen, 2013 WL 6697874, at
*24-28, Bostic v. Rainey, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2014 WL 561978, at *14-22 (D. Va. Feb. 13, 2014),
De Leon v. Perry, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2014 WL 715741, at *14-18 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 26, 2014),
and DeBoer v. Snyder, 2014 WL 1100794, at *11-15 (E.D. Mich. March 21, 2014), considered
similar arguments and found that California’s, Utah’s, Virginia’s, Texas’s, and Michigan’s
marriage bans lacked a rational basis. None of the purported interests offered by these states (or
the private marriage ban proponents in California) provide a rational basis for the Wisconsin
marriage ban, nor is there any other conceivable rational basis for it.

7

Plainly, after Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, and Lawrence, 539 U.S. 558, moral disapproval cannot
be a rational basis for a law that discriminates against lesbians and gays. 133 S. Ct. at 2694; 539 U.S. at
577. See also Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *26-27.

A.

The Marriage Ban Cannot Be Justified By An Interest In Maintaining A
“Traditional” Definition Of Marriage.

Maintaining a “traditional” definition of marriage is not a legitimate state interest and
thus cannot justify the marriage ban. “Ancient lineage of a legal concept does not give it
immunity from attack for lacking a rational basis.” Heller v. Doe by Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 326-27
(1993). Indeed, the fact that a form of discrimination has been “traditional” is a reason to be
more skeptical of its rationality. “The Court must be especially vigilant in evaluating the
rationality of any classification involving a group that has been subjected to a tradition of
disfavor for a traditional classification is more likely to be used without pausing to consider its
justification than is a newly created classification.” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 453 n.6 (Stevens, J.,
concurring) (alterations incorporated; quotation marks omitted); see also Marsh v. Chambers,
463 U.S. 783, 791-92 (1983) (even longstanding practice should not be “taken thoughtlessly, by
force of long tradition and without regard to the problems posed by a pluralistic society”).
As the Supreme Court has explained, “times can blind us to certain truths and later
generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress.”
Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 579. Even the dissent in Lawrence recognized that “‘preserving the
traditional institution of marriage’ is just a kinder way of describing the State’s moral
disapproval of same-sex couples.” Id. at 601 (Scalia, J., dissenting). While “[p]rivate biases may
be outside the reach of the law, . . . the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect” at the
expense of a disfavored group’s constitutional rights. Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433
(1984).
Moreover, as the federal district court recognized in Perry, the “argument that tradition
prefers opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples equates to the notion that opposite-sex
relationships are simply better than same-sex relationships. Tradition alone cannot legitimate
29

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 40 of 50

this purported interest.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 998. Indeed, the Perry court found that “[t]he
tradition of restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples does not further any state interest.” Id.
District Courts in Utah, Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas, and Michigan have also rejected
the tradition argument. Kitchen, 2013 WL 6697874, at *27 (argument is flawed as “[t]he
traditional view of marriage has in the past included certain views about race and gender roles
that were insufficient to uphold laws based on these views.”); Bostic, 2014 WL 561978, at *15
(“tradition alone cannot justify denying same-sex couples the right to marry any more than it
could justify Virginia’s ban on interracial marriage.”); Bourke v. Beshear, --- F. Supp. 2d ----,
2014 WL 556729, at *7 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 12, 2014) (rejecting Kentucky’s argument that its policy
of “preserving the state’s institution of traditional marriage” justified refusal to recognize out-ofstate marriages of same-sex couples); Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *32; De Leon, 2014 WL
715741, at *16 (“tradition, alone, cannot form a rational basis for a law.”); DeBoer, 2014 WL
1100794, at *15 (“[T]radition and morality are not rational bases for [Michigan’s ban on
marriage for same-sex couples].”).
Nor is there any credible argument that allowing same-sex couples to marry will diminish
the institution by deterring different-sex couples from marrying. Indeed, “[i]n an amicus brief
submitted to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by the District of Columbia and fourteen states
that currently permit same-sex marriage, the states assert that the implementation of same-sex
unions in their jurisdictions has not resulted in any decrease in opposite-sex marriage rates, any
increase in divorce rates, or any increase in the number of nonmarital births.” Kitchen, 2013 WL
6697874, at *27 (citing Brief of State Amici at 24-28, Sevcik v. Sandoval, No. 12-17668 (9th Cir.
Oct. 25, 2013), ECF No. 24).

30

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 41 of 50

In deciding the constitutionality of Oklahoma’s marriage ban, the court rejected an
argument based on tradition, because it “is impermissibly tied to moral disapproval of same-sex
couples as a class.”

Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *32. The court reasoned that “civil

marriage . . . is not an institution with ‘moral’ requirements for any other group of citizens,” id.,
since the state “does not ask a couple if they intend to be faithful to one another, if they intend to
procreate, or if they would some-day consider divorce, thereby potentially leaving their child to
be raised in a single-parent home.” Id. Rather, the “[e]xclusion of just one class of citizens from
receiving a marriage license based upon the perceived ‘threat’ they pose to the marital institution
is, at bottom, an arbitrary exclusion based upon the majority’s disapproval of the defined class.”
Id. The same reasoning applies in Wisconsin, where a tradition of excluding same-sex couples
from marriage fails to provide a rational basis for its marriage ban.
B.

The Marriage Ban Cannot Be Justified By An Interest In Encouraging
Responsible Procreation By Heterosexual Couples.

There is no rational connection between the marriage ban and any state interest relating to
parenting or child welfare because: 1) many people procreate without marrying, and procreation
is not a precondition of entering a marriage; 2) many married people choose not to or are unable
to procreate; and, most importantly, 3) different-sex couples’ procreative decisions do not
depend in any way on whether lesbian and gay couples can marry. The benefits and protections
accompanying marriage that may encourage heterosexual couples to marry before procreating
existed before Wisconsin passed its constitutional marriage ban and will still exist after the
marriage ban is struck down. Moreover, same-sex couples parent children who are born to them
through assisted reproduction, are adopted, or were born during a prior heterosexual relationship,
so the relationship between marriage and procreation offers no rational basis for denying samesex couples and their children the advantages of marriage. See Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 902

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 42 of 50

(“Conceptually, the promotion of procreation as an objective of marriage is compatible with the
inclusion of gays and lesbians within the definition of marriage. Gay and lesbian persons are
capable of procreation.”); id at 901-02 (“the exclusion of gays and lesbians from marriage does
not benefit the interests of those children of heterosexual parents, who are able to enjoy the
environment supported by marriage with or without the inclusion of same-sex couples”); see also
De Leon, 2014 WL 715741, at *14 (holding that “limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples fails
to further th[e] interest” of responsible procreation, and that Texas’s marriage ban instead
“causes needless stigmatization and humiliation for children being raised by the loving same-sex
couples being targeted.”).
Even if responsible procreation is narrowed to include only “natural procreation,” the
argument fails rational basis review because Wisconsin does not make ability or desire to
naturally procreate a condition of marriage. That Wisconsin fails to “impose the classification
on other similarly situated groups (here, other non-procreative couples) can be probative of a
lack of rational basis.” Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *29; see also Bourke, 2014 WL 556729, at
*8 (noting that “Kentucky does not require proof of procreative ability to have an out of state
marriage recognized,” an exclusion that “makes just as little sense as excluding post-menopausal
couples or infertile couples on procreation grounds.”).

Ultimately, as the Bishop court

concluded, even
[a]ssuming a state can rationally exclude citizens from marital benefits due to
those citizens’ inability to “naturally procreate,” the state’s exclusion of only
same-sex couples in this case is so grossly underinclusive that it is irrational and
arbitrary. . . . [T]he “carrot” of marriage is equally attractive to procreative and
non-procreative couples, is extended to most non-procreative couples, but is
withheld from just one type of non-procreative couple. Same-sex couples are
being subjected to a “naturally procreative” requirement to which no other
Oklahoma citizens are subjected, including the infertile, the elderly, and those
who simply do not wish to ever procreate.

32

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 43 of 50

Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *30; see also DeBoer, 2014 WL 1100794, at *13 (“The
prerequisites for obtaining a marriage license under Michigan law do not include the ability to
have children, a requirement to raise them in any particular family structure, or the prospect of
achieving certain ‘outcomes’ for children.”).
And further narrowing the argument to an assertion that marriage is intended to promote
stability among different-sex couples, since only they can accidentally procreate, still fails to
offer a rational basis for the marriage ban, since rational basis review requires “some ground of
difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,” Friendship Med.
Ctr., Ltd. v. Chi. Bd. of Health, 505 F.2d 1141, 1152 (7th Cir. 1974) (quoting Royster Guano Co.
v. Va., 253 U.S. 412, 415, (1920)). The connection between a ban on marriage for same-sex
couples and responsible procreation—even if limited to natural procreation—is already so
attenuated as to be irrational, as numerous courts have found. It is even more fanciful to suggest
a rational connection between Wisconsin’s marriage ban and an interest in stability for couples
who accidentally procreate.

Moreover, even if encouraging procreation—or accidental

procreation—in the context of a stable relationship is one of the purposes for marriage, it plainly
is not marriage’s only purpose. “The breadth of the [marriage ban] is so far removed from these
particular justifications that [it is] impossible to credit them.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 635; see also
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 449 (1972) (law that discriminates between married and
unmarried persons in access to contraceptives is “so riddled with exceptions” that the interest
claimed by the government “cannot reasonably be regarded as its aim”).
As recognized in a recent decision by the Western District of Kentucky, the responsible
procreation argument “has failed rational basis review in every court to consider [it] postWindsor, and most courts pre-Windsor.” Bourke, 2014 WL 556729, at *8. Indeed, the Perry,

33

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 44 of 50

Kitchen, and Bishop courts all concluded that “[p]ermitting same-sex couples to marry will not
affect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have children outside of
marriage or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at
972; Kitchen, 2013 WL 6697874, at *25; Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *29; Bostic, 2014 WL
561978, at *18. Indeed, given that same-sex couples may also have children, the Perry court
concluded that “[t]he only rational conclusion in light of the evidence is that [California’s
marriage ban] makes it less likely that California children will be raised in stable households” by
preventing same-sex couples from marrying. Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1000.
C.

The Marriage Ban Cannot Be Justified By An Interest In “Optimal
Childrearing.”

Just as with the responsible procreation argument, the optimal childrearing argument “has
failed rational basis review in every court to consider [it] post-Windsor, and most courts preWindsor.” Bourke, 2014 WL 556729, at *8. This is unsurprising, as the language of Windsor is
quite clear. The marriage ban “humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by
same-sex couples” by “plac[ing] same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a secondtier marriage” and “demean[ing] the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution
protects.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694. The ban “makes it even more difficult for the children to
understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in
their community and in their daily lives.” Id.8
For the purpose of summary judgment, the Bishop court assumed that Oklahoma’s
argument that the optimal childrearing arrangement is one where a married biological mother
8

Moreover, to the extent that the marriage ban is intended to discourage same-sex couples from
parenting by disadvantaging the children of same-sex couples, the ban fails constitutional review. See
Plyler, 457 U.S. at 220 (“[I]mposing disabilities on the . . . child is contrary to the basic concept of our
system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrongdoing.
Obviously, no child is responsible for his birth and penalizing the … child is an ineffectual—as well as
unjust—way of deterring the parent.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted).

and father raised a child was correct and still concluded that Oklahoma’s marriage ban could not
survive rational basis review. The court noted that it “cannot discern[] a single way that
excluding same-sex couples from marriage will ‘promote’ this ‘ideal’ child-rearing
environment.” Bishop, 2014 WL 116013, at *31. Indeed, the Bishop court concluded that
“[e]xclusion from marriage does not make it more likely that a same-sex couple desiring
children, or already raising children together, will change course and marry an opposite-sex
partner” but that “[i]t is more likely that any potential or existing child will be raised by the
same-sex couple without any state-provided marital benefits and without being able to
‘understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in
their community.’” Id.; see also Griego, 316 P.3d at 886 (“[W]e fail to see how forbidding
same-gender marriages will result in the marriages of more opposite-gender couples for the
purpose of procreating, or how authorizing same-gender marriages will result in the marriages of
fewer opposite-gender couples for the purpose of procreating.”) (emphasis in the original).9
Similarly, the Kitchen court did not need to reach the question of the optimal childrearing arrangement, finding that “[t]here is no reason to believe that [Utah’s marriage ban] has
any effect on the choices of couples to have or raise children, whether they are opposite-sex
couples or same-sex couples.” 2013 WL 6697874, at *26. “If anything, [Utah’s marriage ban]
detracts from the State’s goal of promoting optimal environments for children,” both by
inflicting the dignitary harm identified in Windsor and by “den[ying] the families of [children of
same-sex couples] a panoply of benefits that the State and the federal government offer to
families who are legally wed.” Id.

9

A governmental purpose to discourage same-sex couples from raising children would be
illegitimate, since all citizens possess a fundamental right to decide “whether to bear or beget a child.”
Eisenstadt, 405 U.S. at 453.

Like the Bishop and Kitchen courts, this Court need not decide whether the government
has an interest in favoring different-sex over same-sex parents. However, the overwhelming
scientific consensus, based on decades of peer-reviewed research, shows that children raised by
same-sex couples are just as well adjusted as those raised by different-sex couples. Every major
pediatric, mental health, and child welfare organization in the United States has endorsed this
scientific consensus.10 Numerous courts have found that “the evidence shows beyond any doubt
that parents’ genders are irrelevant to children’s developmental outcomes.” Perry, 704 F. Supp.
2d at 1000. See also DeBoer, 2014 WL 1100794, at *12 (“In short, the isolated studies cited by
the state defendants do not support the argument that children raised by heterosexual couples
have better outcomes than children raised by same-sex couples.

To the contrary, the

overwhelming weight of the scientific evidence supports the “no differences” viewpoint.”); In re
Adoption of Doe, 2008 WL 5006172, at *20 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Nov. 25, 2008) (“[B]ased on the robust
nature of the evidence available in the field, this Court is satisfied that the issue is so far beyond

preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.”), aff’d sub nom. Fla. Dep’t of Children &

(concluding, after reviewing “an abundance of evidence and research,” that “opinions that dualgender parenting is the optimal environment for children . . . is based more on stereotype than
anything else”); Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 991 (“More than thirty years of scholarship
resulting in over fifty peer-reviewed empirical reports have overwhelmingly demonstrated that
children raised by same-sex parents are as likely to be emotionally healthy, and educationally
and socially successful as those raised by opposite-sex parents.”).
The Bostic court also rejected the optimal parenting argument, noting that the “rationale
rests upon an unconstitutional, hurtful and unfounded presumption that same-sex couples can’t
be good parents.” Bostic, 2014 WL 561978, at *19. The Bostic court compared the optimal
parenting rationale to the presumption that unmarried fathers are unfit to raise children, which
the Supreme Court struck down in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), noting that Stanley’s
holding “has been construed to mean that the State could not conclusively presume that any
particular unmarried father was unfit to raise his child; the Due Process Clause required a more
individualized determination.” Bostic, 2014 WL 561978, at *19 (quotation marks and citation
omitted). Just as it is unconstitutional to presume that unmarried fathers are unfit to raise
children, it is likewise unconstitutional to presume that same-sex couples are, across the board,
likely to be less fit parents than different-sex couples.
Courts look for a rational basis for legislation to ensure that the State has not engaged in
line-drawing merely for “the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the
law.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 633; see also Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693; Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450;
U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973). But the history of Wisconsin’s

37

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 48 of 50

marriage ban shows that it is an instance of such line-drawing.

Findings of Fact ¶ 41.

Legislative sponsors of the ban described their goal in clear terms: “This proposal would prevent
same-sex marriage from being legalized in this state.” Declaration of Laurence J. Dupuis
(“Dupuis Decl.”), Ex. 1 (“CoSponsorship Memo”). A constitutional amendment was necessary,
the sponsors urged, because “[n]othing in our state constitution presently protects against our
State Supreme Court doing the same thing the Massachusetts Supreme Court did in 2003 . . . and
legislating from the bench to radically alter marriage in this state and judicially impose same-sex
marriage on this state.” Id. One legislative staffer simply described the proposal as the “[g]ay
marriage joint resolution.” Id., Ex. 2 (“Drafting File”) at 15.11
Moreover, Wisconsin’s own Supreme Court has already concluded that the marriage ban
was enacted precisely for the purpose of preventing same-sex couples from marrying. Observing
that “[t]he general purpose of a constitutional amendment is not an interpretive riddle,” and that
“[t]ext and historical context should make the purpose of most amendments apparent,”
McConkey v. Van Hollen, 2010 WI 57, ¶ 54-55, 783 N.W.2d 855, 869, the Wisconsin Supreme
Court found that the intent and purpose of the marriage ban “was to preserve the legal status of
marriage in Wisconsin as between only one man and one woman,” and to do so through a
constitutional amendment to “ensure[] that no legislature, court, or any other government entity
11

Non-legislative proponents of the amendment were even more transparent about their purpose to
discriminate as well as their motives. Vote Yes for Marriage, an organization that advocated for the
marriage ban, urged that “[h]omosexual activists shouldn’t get to redefine marriage because they want
easier access to health-care benefits.” Dupuis Decl., Ex. 3 (“Vote Yes For Marriage Flyer”) at 3. In
discussing “[h]ow we got here,” the Family Research Institute of Wisconsin (“FRIW”), one of the
primary advocates for the marriage ban, argued that “[h]omosexual activists use judicial activists,” and
pointed with alarm to State Supreme Court decisions in Vermont and Massachusetts that resulted in civil
unions and marriage for same-sex couples in those states. Id., Ex. 4 (“FRIW PowerPoint”) at 13. FRIW
then went even further in its disparagement of gays and lesbians, comparing marriage between partners of
the same sex to polygamy. Id. at 18-19. One of the ban’s strongest supporters, Julaine Appling of
Wisconsin Family Action, went on in 2009 to file suit seeking to overturn Wisconsin’s domestic partner
statute, contending that even the limited benefits that the statute provides are a violation of the marriage
ban’s prohibition of the creation or recognition of a substantially similar relationship to marriage. See
Appling v. Walker, No. 2011AP1572 (Wis. Filed June 20, 2011).

38

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 49 of 50

can get around the first sentence [which “preserves the one man-one woman character of
marriage”] by creating or recognizing ‘a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of
marriage.’” Id. The Court also found that the “[t]he sponsors of the amendment were quite clear
that state supreme court decisions overturning the marriage laws of other states [and requiring
those states to permit same-sex couples to marry] were the primary reason for the amendment.”
Id. ¶ 55 and n.22 (citing the Co-Sponsorhip Memo, supra).
The Wisconsin marriage ban thus was not enacted at a time before people had “even
considered the possibility that two persons of the same sex might aspire to occupy the same
status and dignity as that of a man and woman in lawful marriage.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689.
The awareness of such aspirations on the part of same-sex couples—and the desire to thwart
them—are precisely the reasons the ban was proposed in the first place. The “practical effect” of
the ban is consonant with that intent: the marriage ban excludes same-sex couples from marriage,
delegitimizes their relationships, and thereby “impose[s] a disadvantage, a separate status, and so
a stigma upon” same-sex couples and their families in the eyes of the state and the broader
community. Id. at 2693. The ban is not rationally related to any legitimate interest, and thus no
interest “overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure” same-sex couples and their
families. Id. at 2696.
Such a purpose does not necessarily reflect malice or hatred on the part of the laws’
supporters. See Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 (2001) (Kennedy,
J., concurring). It may stem from “negative attitudes,” Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448, “fear,” id.,
“irrational prejudice,” id. at 450, or nothing more than an “instinctive mechanism to guard
against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves,” Garrett, 531 U.S. at
374 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Whatever the motivation, a “bare . . . desire to harm a politically

39

Case: 3:14-cv-00064-bbc Document #: 71 Filed: 03/24/14 Page 50 of 50

unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.” Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534.
And because no other interest is served by the marriage ban, it fails under any standard of
review.
CONCLUSION
As demonstrated above, Wisconsin’s marriage ban violates both the Due Process Clause
and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. As a result, Plaintiffs are
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all four counts of their amended complaint. This
Court should therefore grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment.
