Respondent's Motion To VOID
The Order of the Court

Comes now,Tommy Collier, pro se Respondent, and Moves this honorable court, under the
HYPERLINK "http://www.law.comell.edu/rules/frep/"
HYPERLINK = ""http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frep/Rule60.htm" Rele-60}4), to
immediately VOID the Order of the court for LACK OF JURISDICTION for want of

 

the statutorily required "appropriate process" necessary for the federal district court to

hold jurisdiction to enforce an I.R.S. Summons.

The specific authority of the federal district courts to enforce an Internal Revenue Summons
issued under authority of the United States under Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7602, is clearly and
plainly identified and established in Title 26 U.S.C. Sections 7402(b) and 7604(a). Section
7604(a) plainly states:

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 14 Filed 10/20/10 Page 1 of 8 PagelD #: 57
0x00A7 7604. Enforcement of summons
TA \l'"0x00A7 7604. Enforcement of summons" \s "0x00A7 7604. Enforcement of summons" \c
2
(a) Jurisdiction of district court
If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify, or to
produce books, papers, records, or other data, the United States district court for the
district in which such person resides or is found shall have jurisdiction by
appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books,
papers, records, or other data. ,
(emphasis added)
And Section 7402(b) similarly plainly states:

0x00A7 7402. Jurisdiction of district courts TA \l "0x00A7 7402. Jurisdiction of district courts"
\s "0x00A7 7402. Jurisdiction of district courts" \c 2

(b) To enforce summons
If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify, or to
produce books, papers, or other data, the district court of the United States for the
district in which such person resides or may be found shall have jurisdiction by
appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books,
papers, or other data.
(emphasis added)

These statutes both make it absolutely clear, without any confusion at all, that while the
authority to Summons books, records, information, and testimony is established under
Section 7602, it is not applied or enforced under that same section. The jurisdiction of
the federal district court to enforce the I.R. Summons is ONLY established by the
accomplishment of the twice statutorily specified "appropriate process". Both of these
statutes consistently invoke the same requirement of "appropriate process" in order for the
district court, and only the federal district court, to hold jurisdiction to enforce the I.R.S.

Summons.
That requirement of "appropriate process" cannot be accomplished unless all of the specific

requirements of the controlling statutes regarding the issuance, service, and enforcement

of a Summons are meticulously followed and obeyed by the United States and its Agents

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 14 _ Filed 10/20/10 Page 2 of 8 PagelD #: 58
and Officers and other employees of the ILR.S., throughout the Summons enforcement

process.

The legal authority of Internal Revenue Service employees, like Revenue Officer ,JDEANNA
MCGEE , to serve an Internal Revenue Summons issued under authority of the United States
(under

0x00A7 7602) is clearly specified and spelled out in Title 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7608, subsection (a). It

plainly states:

0x00A7 7608. Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers TA \l "0x00A7 7608.
Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers" \s "0x00A7 7608. Authority of internal
revenue enforcement officers" \c 2 .

(a) Enforcement of subtitle E and other laws pertaining to liquor, tobacco,
and firearms

Any investigator, agent, or other internal Revenue Officer by whatever
term designated, whom the Secretary charges with the duty of enforcing any
of the criminal, seizure, or forfeiture provisions of subtitle E or of any other
law of the United States pertaining to the commodities subject to tax under
such subtitle for the enforcement of which the Secretary is responsible may -

carry firearms;
execute and serve search warrants and arrest warrants, and serve subpoenas and
summonses issued under authority of the United States; (emphasis added)

In the instant circumstances, as a Revenue Officer, DEANNA MCGEE is only authorized
by this statute to serve a Summons while conducting Subtitle E investigations enforcing

the Subtitle E laws pertaining to liquor, tobacco, and firearms, commodities subject to tax.

The Revenue Officer is in violation of this statute, as Respondent has never engaged in
any Subtitle E activities involving any ATF commodities or related business operations.
Additionally, the records sought under the Summons by IRS Revenue Officer ,Deanna

MCGee are not related to any Subtitle E activities or tax, as required by this statute under its

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 14 Filed 10/20/10 Page 3 of 8 PagelD #: 59
granted authority.

Therefore the instant Summons has been improperly issued and served because the Revenue
Officer has exceeded her limited statutory authority to issue and serve a Summons within a
Subtitle E investigation. Under I.R.C. 0x00A7 7608(a), the Revenue Officer has no authority to
act under Subtitle A. However, the authority is granted in statute to serve a Summons under
Subtitle A under the next code sub-section, I.R.C. 0x00A7 7608(b). However that authority does

not include the Revenue Officer.

It is not erroneous to interpret this code subsection, I.R.C. 0x00A7 7608(a), as only being
applicable to the authority of Internal Revenue Officers to enforce subtitle E and other
laws pertaining to liquor, tobacco, and firearms, because that is exactly what it says.
However, while subsection (a) of this code section indeed addresses only Subtitle E
investigations, and limits the authority of the Revenue Officer to investigative activities
conducted only under Subtitle E, it is also a fact that this code section (0x00A7 7608) specifically
addresses the "Enforcement of laws relating to internal revenue OTHER THAN SUBTITLE
E", in the very next sub-section, 7608(b). Subtitles "OTHER THAN SUBTITLE E",
would of course include Subtitle A, and thus becomes controlling in the instant dispute,

as this is indisputably a Subtitle A matter and investigation.

The authority to serve Summons issued under investigations relating to Subtitle A tax
matters, which would be the relevant, applicable, and controlling authority in the
instant matter under the factual circumstances, is indeed specified and established under

Title 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7608, subsection (b), which plainly states:

0x00A7 7608. Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers. TA \I "0x00A7 7608.
Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers" \s "0x00A7 7608. Authority of
internal revenue enforcement officers" \c 2

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 14 Filed 10/20/10 Page 4 of 8 PagelD #: 60
{b) Enforcement of laws relating to internal revenue OTHER than subtitle E

(1) Any criminal investigator of the Intelligence Division of the Internal
Revenue Service whom the Secretary charges with the duty of enforcing any of
the criminal provisions of the internal revenue laws, any other criminal provisions
of law relating to internal revenue for the enforcement of which the Secretary is
responsible, or any other law for which the Secretary has delegated investigatory
authority to the Internal Revenue Service, is, in the performance of his duties,
authorized to perform the functions described in paragraph (2).

(2) The functions authorized under this subsection to be performed by an
officer referred to in paragraph (1) are -

(A) to execute and serve search warrants and arrest warrants, and serve
subpoenas and summonses issued under authority of the United States;
(emphasis added)

Clearly and plainly, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(b) specifies that ONLY a "criminal investigator of
the Intelligence Division" may serve a Summons outside of Subtitle E, i.e.: under Subtitle .
A, as in the actual circumstances and facts defining the instant dispute. Revenue
Officer, Deanna MCGee is not a criminal investigator of the Intelligence Division and has
therefore violated 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(b) by serving a Summons that only a "criminal
investigator" (of the "intelligence division") is authorized to serve. This destroys the
statutorily required "appropriate process" necessary by law in order for the district court to
hold jurisdiction to enforce the Summons by Order of the Court. The federal district court
never held jurisdiction to issue any Order in this matter because the Revenue Officer
destroyed the required "appropriate process" necessary by law for the court to hold
jurisdiction to enforce the I.R. Summons, by exceeding the authority granted to him in

statute, and unlawfully usurping the authority to serve a Subtitle A Summons.
Not surprisingly, since the law is consistent, the Revenue Officer has also violated 26 U.S.C.

0x00A7 7608(a) by exceeding her true statutory authority as a Revenue Officer in serving a

Summons that is not issued as part of a Subtitle E investigation or enforcement action.

Case 3:10-cv-00802 Document 14 Filed 10/20/10 Page 5 of 8 PagelD #: 61
The Authority that is actually possessed by Revenue Officer, Deanna MCGee, is that actually
| specified in Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7608(a), supra, to only serve a Summons regarding the
"criminal, seizure, or forfeiture provisions of subtitle E' or "pertaining to the commodities

subject to tax"'.

Section 7608(b) irrefutably and unequivocably controls the "Enforcement of laws relating to
internal revenue OTHER than subtitle E". Plainly and clearly, that would include Subtitle
A, which is the Subtitle relevant to this matter. No "criminal investigator of the intelligence
division" ever issued or served any Summons in this matter, which was the statutorily
required "appropriate process" necessary by law in order for the federal district court to
properly and lawfully hold jurisdiction in this matter to enforce the Summons by issuing an

Order of the Court.

IRC 0x00A7 7608(a), only authorizes a limited investigative and Summons service authority under
Subtitle E in the hands of the Revenue Officer. The IRS Revenue office} has exceeded
his/her authority under that subsection in this matter, and further ignores the fact that the
Revenue Officer has no authority to act under 7608(b), outside of subtitle E and under
Subtitle A, because he/she is not a "criminal investigator of the Intelligence Division" as

required by the statute's specific and precise language in subsection (b).

Therefore the federal district court held no true legal jurisdiction to issue any Order in this
matter, and has plainly and clearly acted without jurisdiction to take any action through the

issuance of any Order, deciding for or against any argument.
Pursuant to the HYPERLINK "http://www.law.comell.edu/rules/frcp/""Pederal-Rules-ef

Summary & Conclusion

_ Therefore, under the statutes of Title 26 of the United States Code of the United States of

America, specifically I.R. Code Sections 7604(a), 7402(b), 7608(a), and 7608(b), and
