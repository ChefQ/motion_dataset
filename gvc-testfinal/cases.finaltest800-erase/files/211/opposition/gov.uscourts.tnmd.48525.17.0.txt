CIVIL NO. 3:10-cv-00802
JUDGE HAYNES

RESPONSE TO COLLIER’S MOTION TO VOID ORDER OF THE COURT
COMES NOW the United States of America and Internal Revenue Officer Deanna
McGhee, by and through the United States Attorney as counsel, and for their response to Tommy
Collier’s Motion to Void Order of the Court [Doc. 14], would show to this Court as follows:
Mr. Collier’s Motion questions this Court’s jurisdiction over this case. An order entered
by a court, where that court lacks jurisdiction, can be set aside as void. See United States v.
Indoor Cultivation Equip., 55 F.3d 1311, 1316-17 (7th Cir. 1995). However, there is no problem
with the District Court’s jurisdiction in this case.
Mr. Collier’s Motion to Void Order of the Court is somewhat difficult to decipher;
nevertheless, as the United States understands it, Mr. Collier maintains that the legal authority of
Revenue Officer Deanna McGhee to serve an IRS summons comes from 26 U.S.C.A. § 7608
(West 2010). Mr. Collier understands § 7608 to only authorize a revenue officer to serve an IRS
summons “while conducting [a] Subtitle E investigation enforcing the Subtitle E laws pertaining
to liquor, tobacco, and firearms, [or other] commodities subject to tax.” Mr. Collier, without
giving any affidavit, contends that he does not engage in “any Subtitle E activities involving any
ATF commodities or related business operation.” He contends that none of the records sought
through the summons are related to “any Subtitle E activities or tax, as required by [§ 7608]
under its granted authority.” He says that § 7608 “only authorizes a limited investigation and
summons service authority under Subtitle E in the hands the Revenue Officer.” He concludes
that, “The IRS Revenue Officer has exceeded her authority under that subsection in this matter,
and further ignores the fact that the Revenue Officer has no authority to act under § 7608 outside

of Subtitle E..., because she is not a criminal investigator of the intelligence division as required
by the statute’s specific and precise language....” Consistent with his arguments, Mr. Collier asks
the District Court to “void the original orders of the Court in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction
for want of appropriate process.”
Mr. Collier is not the first person to make the argument contained in his motion - the
argument that an IRS summons is unenforceable by a District Court because its issuance and/or
service by a Revenue Officer violates 26 U.S.C.A. § 7608 where the taxpayer was not involved
in taxable activities centering around alcohol, tobacco, firearms or other taxable commodities.
That specious argument has been advanced in and uniformly rejected by other federal courts. To
quote one such court that rejected the argument, “[A] cursory examination of the case law would
have revealed to [the taxpayer] that Internal Revenues Agents clearly have properly delegated
authority to issue summonses pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7602 (internal citations omitted).”
Holling v. United States, 1996 WL 200731, at *8 (E. D. Mich. Feb. 6, 1996)( awarding
sanctions against a taxpayer’s lawyer where one of the taxpayer’s challenges to an IRS summons
was that the revenue agent lacked authority to issue/serve an IRS summons because 26 U.S.C. §
7608 “only authorizes revenue agents to issue summonses for Subtitle E taxes”).
In Madge v. United States, 1995 WL 313653 (D. Minn. Feb. 13, 1995), a taxpayer
couple were trying to quash third-party IRS summonses seeking testimony, records, books, and
other data relating to the couple’s federal income tax liabilities. In attempting to quash the
summonses, the couple argued, among other things, that their tax liabilities did not “relate to
Subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code, which relates to alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, [so the
Revenue Agent] was without authority to issue the summonses in question.” Madge, 1995 WL
313653, at*3-4. On that issue, the Madge court ruled, “The Court finds that these arguments,
apart from their incoherence, are without merit.

The summonses in question were issued

pursuant to Internal Revenue Code § 7602; Subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code has no
application here.” Madge, 1995 WL 313653, at *4. Other federal courts faced with the same
taxpayer argument - that an IRS Revenue Officer can only serve a summons if conducting a

Subtitle E investigation enforcing Subtitle E laws pertaining to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or
other commodities subject to tax - all have rejected that argument. See Gudenau v. United
States, 2006 WL 2639472, at *7 (D. Haw. Sept. 11, 2006)(rejecting the argument); Gaunt v.
IRS, 1996 WL 376341, at *2 (M.D. Penn. May 1, 1996)(rejecting the argument, saying it
“simply is incorrect”); Nelson v. United States, 1994 WL 519485, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 19,
1994)(rejecting the argument, noting that § 7602 and § 7608 “operate independently”).
The Petition and accompanying Declaration of Revenue Officer McGhee show that she
properly issued the administrative summons pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A. § 7602 and served it in
accordance with 26 U.S.C.A. § 7603 (West 2010). As a settled legal matter, Congress has
endowed federal districts courts with subject matter jurisdiction to enforce summonses issued
and served by IRS agents/officers seeking tax information under the above statutes. See 26
U.S.C.A. § 7604 (West 2010) and Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 445-46 (1964).
Additionally, in such federal internal revenue cases, since the United States is the plaintiff,
jurisdiction could also be proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1335, and 1340 (West 2010).
FOR ALL THE FOREGOING REASONS, this Court has jurisdiction, and Mr. Collier’s
Motion to Void the Order of the Court should be in all respects denied.
Respectfully submitted,
