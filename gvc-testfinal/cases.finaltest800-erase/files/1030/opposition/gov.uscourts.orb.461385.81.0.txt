Defendants hereby respond to Plaintiffs' Motion for Costs and Attorney's Fees Regarding

Defendants' Failure to Admit, as follows:
I.
Plaintiffs are seeking costs and attorney fees they claim were incurred as a result of

defendants' failure to allegedly admit items in plaintiffs' Request for Admissions ("RFA"). The

majority of the allegations are directed toward defendant Candice Holman's responses. With regard
to James Holman's response to RFA #3, he did not admit that he caused the UCC-1 to be filed
because he did not file it, and did not recall whether he requested it to be filed. With regard to RFA
#4, James Holman did not recall whether he caused the UCC-1 to be terminated, as was his
testimony at trial. P. 219. He could not admit that which he was not sure about. With regard to
RFA 46, it was already irrefutable, per plaintiff' s exhibit, that attorney Todd Mitchell terminated the
UCC-1. The document spoke for itself on that matter and defendant remains puzzled as to why it
was inquired upon. As to RFA #9, the substance of the second mortgage was disclosed on the
Personal Financial Statement ("PFS"); defendant James Holman simply aggregated both amounts
in the space provided, albeit he was incorrect on the exact amount.
2:

It was obvious from the responses that defendant Candice Holman provided at the deposition
that she did not know the answers to the questions in the RFA. And of course, as was made clear
at the depositions, Candice Holman does not even know what a "UCC-1" is. She therefore had no
choice but to deny the request. Indeed, not long after plaintiffs' letter complaining about the RFA
responses, defendants' counsel, on June 3, 2015, emailed plaintiffs' co-counsel, Darian Stanford,
informing him that defendant Candice Holman knew nothing about the PFS, whatever James
Holman did, or the finances. See Exhibit 1.

3.

Plaintiffs either received, or had, the opportunity to clarify or question defendants' responses
to the RFA when depositions were conducted in July of 2015. In those depositions Ms. Holman
made it clear she knew nothing about the material allegations on which plaintiffs' lawsuit is based.
See Exhibit 2, depo. Tr. P. 41-42. This non-culpable conduct was confirmed during Judge Dunn's
comments on July 30, 2015, at the summary judgment hearing, when he confirmed that Candice
Holman had no role in this, and in fact Candice Holman's involvement, or lack thereof, reminded

the Judge of a movie, "Born Yesterday."

4.

The actual amount of time necessary to prove any inaccuracies in the response to the RFA
was minimal. Plaintiffs' motion is a disguised attempt to impose fees and thus harass Candice
Holman, whose debt otherwise has been discharged.

5.
Defendants request that the court deny plaintiffs' motion and award defendants their costs

and reasonable attorney fees for addressing this unnecessary motion practice.

Hi Paul,

I would get to depose her regardless of whether she is a party. If she confirms such things in her deposition in
July, I will discuss with Dwight and Laura whether to drop her from the case.

if you were to file the motion now, I would respond by noting that I am taking her deposition and the Court
should reserve any judgment until that happens and not make us respond to any motion until after the
deposition.

I guess what I am saying is that I would like to take her deposition and then evaluate where we are at.

Hi Darian,

I'd like to discuss with you an issue that's been running through my mind recently as it relates to
defendant Candice Holman. She never signed the personal financial statement. Prior to this litigation,
she had never read it. | believe your clients would agree that she had never discussed her finances,
James's finances, or the loan itself with your client at any time.

Of course, chime in if I'm missing something. As | see the material facts, | don't see how Candice
Holman ran afoul of Sec. 523(a)(2)(A) or (B). (Naturally, I'm not inferring that James's did; indeed its
patently denied that his actions are anywhere near a Sec. 523(a)(2) problem. It's just that it strongly
appears to me that any claim against Candice Holman under Sec. 523(a)(2) does not even rise to a
triable matter.

have two documents that you signed. Well, I think you
Signed two and acknowledged one. We'll say that.

A. Okay.

Q. Let me ask you, I showed you what was a

corporate acknowledgment on the assignment of the life

insurance.
Do you remember that? You signed it as --
A Yes.
Q. -- Candice Evangeline, right?
A Yes.

Q. What was the purpose of that acknowledgment?
Do you know? Why did you have to do that?

A. I don't know.

Q Did your husband ask you to do it?
A. Yeah.
Q Okay.
A I guess. I don't remember really.

Q. So we have three documents there with your
handwriting on them. I'm wondering, of all this paperwork,
everything we've got here, were you involved in any way
with any of it other than the promissory note that you
signed because your husband asked you to, the deed of trust
that you signed because your husband asked you to and the
corporate acknowledgment of the life insurance assignment

that you acknowledged because your husband asked you to?

Were you involved in any other way with all of this?

A. No.

Q. You did understand as of February 2011 that
the Daniels were lending not only Mr. Holman, but you as
well, $300,000, right?

A. I don't know exactly when.

Q. Okay.

A. But, yes.

Q. Okay. So that it was ~- although you
testified earlier that it was your understanding that it
was for the business pursuant to a conversation with your
husband, the money was actually loaned to the two of you?

A. Right.

Q. Okay.

MR. BITNER: That's all I've got. Thank you

very much.
