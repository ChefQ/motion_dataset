TELEPHONE HEARING REQUIREMENTS
Participants MUST COMPLY WITH EACH REQUIREMENT listed below:
a. You must call in and connect to the telephone hearing line or personally appear in the judge's
courtroom no later than the hearing time above. The court will not call you.
b. You may be asked to call again from another phone if your connection is weak or creates static or
disruptive noise.
c. Please mute your phone when you are not speaking. If you do not have a mute function on your phone,
press *6 to mute and *6 again to unmute if you need to speak. Do not put the court on hold if it will
result in music or other noise. If available, set the phone to "Do Not Disturb" so it will not ring during the
hearing.
d. When it is time for you to speak, take your phone off the "speaker" option to minimize background
noise. Position the telephone to minimize paper rustling. Do not use a keyboard or talk with others in
the room. Be aware that telephone hearings may be amplified throughout the courtroom.
e. Do not announce your presence until the court calls your case. Simply stay on the line, even if there is
only silence, until the judge starts the hearings, and then continue to listen quietly until your case is
called.
