.

Based on the foregoing, and the Memorandum, numerous denials made by Defendants to
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions were proven to be inaccurate at trail. Plaintiffs were forced to
go forward and establish proof of each of the information contained in the requests at issue. As
the matters have been proven true, Plaintiffs now request the Court to order Defendants to pay
their reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees incurred in making that proof.

SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR COSTS
AND ATTORNEY’S FEES REGARDING
DEFENDANTS’ FAILURE TO ADMIT

JAMES JOEL HOLMAN and CANDICE
EVANGELINE HOLMAN,
Defendants.
Plaintiffs have moved the Court to be awarded their attorney’s fees concerning requests
for admissions that were originally denied and proven true. This Memorandum supports that
Motion.
STANDARD
FRCP 36(a)(4) states in pertinent part:
If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or
state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or
deny it. *** the answering party may assert lack of knowledge or
information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the
party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the
information knows or can readily obtain this insufficient to enable
it to admit or deny.

FRCP 37(c)(2) states in pertinent part:
If a party fails to admit what is requested under Rule 36 and if the
requesting party later proves a document to be genuine or the
matter true, the requesting party may move that the party who
failed to admit pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred in making that proof.
APPLICATION
In this matter, Plaintiffs propounded Requests for Admissions pursuant to FRCP 36 to
Defendants. In response, Plaintiffs received the following responses:
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 1: Admit that you represented to Plaintiffs that your
personal residence at 26280 Milk Creek Circle was worth $775,000 in February 2011.
RESPONSE: James Holman ADMITS; Candice Holman DENIES.
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 2: Admit that you represented to Plaintiffs that you owed
$450,000 on the Defendant’s personal residence at 26280 Milk Creek Circle in February 2011.
RESPONSE: James Holman ADMITS; Candice Holman DENIES.
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 3: Admit that the UCC-1, attached hereto as Exhibit 1,
was filed with the Oregon Secretary of State on behalf of you on February 25, 2011.
RESPONSE: DENY
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 4: Admit that the UCC-1 form, attached hereto as Exhibit
1, was terminated on August 18, 2011.
RESPONSE: DENY
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 6: Admit that the UCC-1, attached hereto as Exhibit 1,
was terminated by your attorney, Todd Mitchell.
RESPONSE: DENY
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit that you never gave notice to either of the two
Plaintiffs of the termination of UCC-1, attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
RESPONSE: James Holman ADMITS; Candice Holman DENIES.

REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 8: Admit that as the time you created your “Personal
Financial Statement” in February 2011 there were two mortgages on the personal residence at
26280 Milk Creek Circle.
RESPONSE: James Holman ADMITS; Candice Holman DENIES.
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 10: Admit that you did not have the residence at 26280
Milk Creek Circle appraised to determine its value in preparing the Personal Financial Statement.
RESPONSE: James Holman ADMITS; Candice Holman DENIES.
REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 13: Admit that as of the time of you preparing the
Personal Financial Statement of February 2011 you had a mortgage balance in excess of
$450,000.
RESPONSE: James Holman ADMITS; Candice Holman DENIES.
See Defendants’ Responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission attached as an Exhibit 1 to the
Declaration of R. Hunter Bitner, II.
Concerning requests numbers 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 13, Defendant James Holman admitted
each whereas Candice Holman denied each. It should be emphasized that Mrs. Holman did not
note that she did not have adequate information and did not know the answer, rather, she denied
the requests. Each of Mrs. Holman’s denials have been proven to be inaccurate and there is no
question of the truth of each of the requests. See Trial Transcript, August 13, 2015 p. 261, l. 13 ‒
p. 263, l. 4.
Turning to Mr. Holman’s denials, there is no question that the UCC-1 was filed with the
Oregon Secretary of State on behalf of Mr. Holman on February 25, 2011. Additionally, that
same UCC-1 was unequivocally terminated on August 18, 2011 and Plaintiffs established that
the UCC-1 was in fact terminated by Todd Mitchell. Therefore, Mr. Holman’s denials have been
established to be inaccurate. See Trial Transcript, p. 186, ll. 5 ‒ 7; p. 191, l. 15 ‒ p. 192, l. 15; p.
201, ll. 15 ‒ 19; p. 208, ll. 5 ‒ 9; p. 218, l. 25 ‒ p. 221, l. 6; Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 9 ‒ UCC-3
Termination of UCC-1 Financing Statement, filed August 18, 2011; see also Deposition of James

Holman taken on July 7, 2015 p. 132, l. 25 ‒ p. 134, l. 5. At no point did Mr. Holman say that he
had inadequate information to respond; rather, he simply denied the requests.
Based on the foregoing, each of the denials at issue were proven to be inaccurate at trial.
See Memorandum Opinion, pp. 6, 7. Plaintiffs were forced to go forward and establish the proof
regarding the information contained in each request. Additionally, counsel for Plaintiffs made it
clear to counsel for Defendants that they would be doing so and relying upon that information.
See Exhibit 2 to the Declaration of R. Hunter Bitner, II. Defendants decided not to amend their
responses.
As the matters have been unequivocally proven true, Plaintiffs now request the Court to
order Defendants to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees incurred in making
that proof.
