PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The Plaintiff Shirley Schumacher (“Schumacher”) was verbally and emotionally
abused by her supervisor Joseph Hutnick (“Hutnick”). Hutnick's discriminatory conduct
caused Schumacher emotional stress sufficient to warrant her physician to require that she
take a medical leave of absence. Schumacher who had complained to co-workers about
Hutnick’s discriminatory comments was demoted and terminated by Hutnick after her coworkers’ informed him of her complaints. Schumacher was on leave authorized by Fairfield
when her FMLA leave was denied and Hutnick terminated her. The pretext used by Hutnick
to terminate Schumacher was her failure to provide information to CORE necessary to
substantiate her medical leave. Information that Hutnick knew Fairfield had requested and
Fairfield received from Schumacher. Before she was demoted and terminated Schumacher was
Fairfield’s only woman sales manager as well as it’s oldest. These facts raise an inference
that Schumacher’s termination was discriminatory and that summary judgment is not
appropriate in this case.
SUMMARY OF FACTS 1
Schumacher initially began working in the timeshare industry in 1983 and
was employed by a corporate predecessor to Fairfield. After Fairfield took over corporate
ownership, Fairfield promoted Schumacher to sales manager she was responsible for the
recruitment and management of sales associates. In January, 2004, Schumacher was
managing a sales program called Discover when her recently appointed supervisor Joseph
Hutnick (“Hutnick”) changed its name to Exit and made her “acting” manager (Schumacher
Deposition, pp.80-81).
The following facts are drawn from the Statement of Disputed Material Facts submitted by Schumacher pursuant to
Local Rule 56, and the Appendix of Exhibits submitted therewith.

In late January 2004 shortly before Schumacher left for a scheduled vacation she had
a meeting with Hutnick regarding the Exit program. Hutnick advised her that a time-share
company in Wisconsin called DELLS also had an Exit program that was doing very well. In
an effort to learn if the successful Exit Program in Wisconsin was doing something that wasn’t
being done by Fairfield. Schumacher called Wisconsin; she was told that they did not have
an Exit Program and that things were very slow. When Schumacher went to Hutnick and
told him what Wisconsin had told her he became very angry (Schumacher Deposition, p.87).
Hutnick asked her why she had called Wisconsin, Schumacher responded by telling
him she wanted to improve her performance and that of the Exit program. Hutnick still very
angry called her a “cunt” and walked away. (Schumacher Deposition, p.77)
Following this incident Schumacher complained to Fairfield employees Lemlar
and Coppa that Hutnick had called her a “cunt” and “bitch” Both Lemlar and Coppa
reported to Hutnick what Schumacher had told them. (Schumacher Deposition, p.88)
(Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 4, Exhibit, 2). Shortly thereafter, and before Schumacher left
for her scheduled vacation Hutnick told her that when she returned that she would no
longer be manager (Schumacher Deposition, p. 106). Schumacher went to Florida for
vacation but was unable to relax and became more depressed over the demeaning
incidents with Hutnick. Consequently, she quit her vacation early, returned to Rhode
Island and sought the care of her physician Dr. James D. Gloor.
Dr. Gloor began treating Schumacher for stress and provided her with a
disability certificate indicating that she could not work from February 11, 2004 through
April11, 2004 (Deposition of Dr. James D. Gloor (“Gloor Deposition”) pp 9-13).

Schumacher also contacted Jan Weber, Leave and Disability Coordinator at Fairfield and
requested leave, which Fairfield authorized. (Schumacher Deposition, p. 97; Schumacher
Affidavit, ¶ 7 Exhibit 5)
On February 26, 2004 Schumacher did contact Core, Inc. (“Core”) to tell it that
she was not making application to Core for short term-disability that she had elected
instead to receive Temporary Disability Insurance (“TDI”) through the policy provided by
the State of Rhode Island because she would receive more money. (Schumacher
Deposition, pp.130-131) ;(Schumacher Affidavit ¶ 18, Exhibit 14).
Fairfield contacted Schumacher by letter dated March 16, 2004 this letter was a
Medical Leave of Absence Notification letter from Jan Weber advising her to have the
attached Medical Certification Form completed by her physician and then return it. The
letter stated that Fairfield would determine the length of approved leave based upon the
information provided on the form. (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 9, Exhibit 6)
Fairfield again contacted Schumacher by telephone on March 30, 2004
Schumacher advised the caller that she had the forms for Dr. Gloor and that she would
see him on the 9t h and bring it back on the 11th the caller advises Schumacher that it was
“OK”. (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 10, Exhibit 7).
Schumacher provided Jan Webber, Fairfield’s Leave and Disability Coordinator
with a note stating that her doctor would be mailing her all the information she needed.
Schumacher also provided a Disability Certificate stating that She was totally disable
from April 10,2004 through May 11,2004. (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 11, Exhibit 8)
Dr. Gloor sent Schumacher’s Certification Forms to Fairfield (Schumacher
Deposition, pp. 97-99). On April 16, 2004, his office mailed Schumacher’s Physician’s

Certification form. (Gloor Deposition, pp.34, 35) (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 12, Exhibit, 9).
Fairfield received the Physicians Certification Form that Dr. Gloor's office mailed on
April 16, 2004 and produced it as part of Schumacher’s personnel file. Schumacher
Affidavit, ¶13, Exhibit, 10) Fairfield also received Schumacher’s Medical Certification
Form and produced it as part of Schumacher’s personnel file. (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 14,
Exhibit, 11)
Hutnick terminated Schumacher in a letter dated April 21, 2004. (Schumacher
Affidavit, ¶15; Exhibit, 12) The reason given for her termination was that Core had
denied her FMLA application. (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶16; Exhibit, 13)

ARGUMENT
Schumacher can establish that Age and Sex were Motivating Factors in
Schumacher’s Demotion and Discharge
Schumacher is pursuing her Employment Discrimination and Family Medical Leave claims
under both the burden- shifting method of proof outlined in McDonnell-Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S.
792 (1973), Texas Dep’t of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981) and the mixed-motive
analysis standards articulated in Price Water House v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), Desert Palace
v. Costa, 590 U.S. 90(2003). The Plaintiff may elect to proceed simultaneously on both fronts and
the trial court, at the appropriate time in the litigation, will channel the case into one format or the
other Fernandez v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 581 (1st . Cir. 1999).

Fairfield argues that Schumacher cannot establish a prima facie case of age and gender
discrimination because she was not performing her job at a level that met its legitimate
expectations (Fairfield Memorandum (“Memorandum”) at 10). Fairfield alleges that
Schumacher failed to meet its legitimate expectation because in 2002 approximately two years

8

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 9 of 20

before her demotion and discharge she received two Notices of Corrective Action from a former
supervisor. In addition, Fairfield also alleges that Hutnick noted Schumacher’s performance
deficiencies and caused him to consider demoting her (Memorandum at 12).
The burden of making out a prima facie case belongs to the plaintiff, but it is not an
“onerous one,” Snachez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712 (1st Cir. 1994). It requires a small
showing Reed v. LePage Bakeries Inc., 224 F3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2001).
Prior to Schumacher’s demotion and discharge she was Fairfield’s oldest manager and the
only woman. (Exhibit A, Schumacher Affidavit (“Affidavit”), ¶ 2, Exhibit 1). Her work
performance was equal to and in instances superior to other managers (Affidavit ¶5 Exhibit, 3).
The Corrective Action Notices she received were based on misinformation. (Schumacher
Deposition, pp.61 -65) The supervisor, who issued these Notices, amended a Corrective Action
Notice because a portion of it was erroneous. (Affidavit, ¶ 6 Exhibit 4) The unknown deficiencies
that may have been noted by Hutnick concerning Schumacher’s work performance (Memorandum
at 12) apparently did not violate Fairfield policy or were of sufficient severity to warrant their
memorialization in the form Corrective Action Notices since he did not issue any to Schumacher.

Schumacher can show Pretext and that Discrimination was a
Motivating Factor in Fairfield’s reason for her termination
Fairfield argues that its legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Schumacher
was her failure to properly support her request for FMLA leave by failing to provide medical
documentation to Core (Memorandum at 12). A plaintiff can show that the employer’s stated
reasons are pretextual in a number of ways Santiago-Ramos v. Centential P.R. Wireless Corp.,
217 F.3d 46,54 (1 st Cir. 2000). Pretext can be established by showing weaknesses,

9

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 10 of 20

implausibility’s, inconsistencies or contradiction in the employer’s proffered legitimate reasons
such that a fact finder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted nondiscriminatory
reason Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st Cir.1998).
Here, Fairfield provided Schumacher with the medical documentation forms to support her
FMLA leave and requested that she complete the forms and return them to Fairfield. Schumacher
returned the completed medical documentation to Fairfield as instructed (Affidavit ¶¶ 9, 14 Exhibits,
6, 11). Fairfield argues that Schumacher’s failure to provide those medical forms to Core
served as a legitimate basis for her termination by Hutnick who knew that Fairfield had requested
that Schumacher return the medical forms to Fairfield. Evidence that the employer’s stated reasons
for its actions are pretextual can be sufficient to show improper motive, and hence survive summary
judgment Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133 143 (2000); Feliciano de la
Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort and Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir (2000).
Hutnick called Schumacher an old bitch and cunt. Statements by supervisors carrying the
inference that the supervisor harbored animus against protected classes of people or conduct are
clearly probative of pretext. Kellyv. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F3d. 335,347-48 (1stCir 1998) A
Plaintiff can show that the employer’s nondiscriminatory reason is pretextual by showing that
discriminatory comments were made by the key decision maker or those in a position to influence the
decision maker Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670 675 -76 (1st Cir 1996). Here, Hutnick
demoted Schumacher after learning she had complained to coworkers about his discriminatory
comments. Hutnick terminated her for not returning her medical forms to Core even though he was
notified by Fairfield that it had requested that Schumacher return them to Fairfield. Theses facts are

10

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 11 of 20

sufficient to create an inference that Hutnick’s stated reasons for demoting and terminating
Schumacher were pretextual and that he harbored a discriminatory animus toward Schumacher.

Hutnicks’s offensive comments and subsequent demotion of Schumacher
created a hostile environment
Fairfield asserts that discriminatory comments by Hutnick were neither severe nor pervasive
and therefore fails to create any hostile environment as a matter of law. And that Schumacher never
complained of a hostile work environment. That therefore her claims are barred pursuant to the
affirmative defense recognized in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton 524 U.S. 775,787-789 (1998)
(Memorandum at 14).
There is no mathematically precise test for determining when conduct in the work place
moves beyond the merely offensive and enters the realm of unlawful discrimination Harris v.
Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21(1993).
Schumacher complained to co-workers that Hutnick made discriminatory comments to her.
These coworkers reported her complaint to Hutnick who then made a report of that complaint and
entered it into Schumacher’s personnel file. (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 4, Exhibit 2). The harassment
report submitted by Hutnick stated Schumacher had accused him of calling her an “Old cuss and
bitch” (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 4 Exhibit 2) shortly after learning of her complaint Hutnick demoted
her from Sales Manager to Sales Associate. Hutnick’s discriminatory comments and her demotion
caused Schumacher stress sufficient to warrant a physician to classify her as totally disabled and
unable to work (Gloor Deposition, p.17).

Schumacher’s claims not barred by Faragher and Ellerth
Time and experience had shown Schumacher that the anti-harassment hot line Fairfield
provided did not work. (Schumacher Deposition, 47) Other than receiving the policy manual itself

11

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 12 of 20

Schumacher received or training and was not familiarized by Fairfield with the meaning of its
contents. Despite an extensive list of policies and procedures promulgated by Fairfield. Schumacher a
manager never saw anti -harassment notices posted on a bulletin board or did she receive any
instruction in matters related to policies and procedures. (Schumacher Deposition, p.49.) Even
assuming Schumacher failed to avail herself to Fairfield’s complaint procedures. The discriminatory
comments Hutnick made to Schumacher and her subsequent demotion should deny Fairfield the
benefit of an affirmative defense. No affirmative defense is available when the supervisor’s
harassment culminates in a tangible employment action such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable
reassignment Faragher v. City of Boca Raton 524 U.S. 775,787-789 (1998), Arrieta - Colon v.
Walmart 434 F.3d 75 (1st Cir. 2006).

Schumacher was entitled to FMLA and RIPFMLA leave
Fairfield states that Schumacher applied for and was denied FMLA leave because she failed to
timely provide any documentation to support her request for leave to Core, (Memorandum at 19).
However, Schumacher never made application to Core for FMLA leave or short term Disability. Her
application for FMLA leave was made to Fairfield and her application for Short Disability went
through her Rhode Island, TDI insurance.
On February 26, 2004 Schumacher did contact Core, Inc. (“Core”) to tell it that she was not
making application to Core for short term-disability. She had elected instead to receive
Temporary Disability Insurance (“TDI”) through the policy provided by the State of Rhode
Island because she would receive more money. (Schumacher Deposition, pp.1 30-131;
Schumacher Affidavit, Exhibit 14) She had no further contact with Core until April 30, 2004.
(Schumacher Affidavit, Exhibit 14)

12

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Page 13 of 20

Fairfield provided Schumacher with her Medical Leave application form and Dr. Gloor
returned it to Fairfield as requested (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 9 Exhibits, 6) Dr. Gloor sent all
Schumacher’s Certification Forms to Fairfield. (Schumacher Deposition pp. 97-99) On April 16,
2004 Dr.Gloor’s office mailed a Physician’s Certification form bearing Dr.Gloor’s signature
(Gloor Deposition, pp.34, 35; Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 12, Exhibit, 9).
As stated above, Fairfield received a copy of the Physicians Certification Form dated
April 16, 2004 and produced it as part of Schumacher’s personnel file. Fairfield also received
Schumacher’s Medical Certification Form and produced it as part of Schumacher’s personnel
file.
Schumacher held a reasonable belief that Fairfield was processing her FMLA application
based upon Fairfield’s statements and conduct. Schumacher had no reason to believe that by
cooperating with Fairfield regarding her FMLA application that she would be jeopardizing her
entitlement to FMLA protected leave. “An employer who by his silence misled an employee
concerning the employee’s entitlement to family leave might, if the employee reasonably relied
and was harmed as a result, be estopped to plead the defense of ineligibility to the employee’s
claim of entitlement to family leave”. Dormeyer v. Comerica Bank-Illinois, 223 F.3d 579,582 (7th
Cir.2000)
Additionally, Fairfield argues that because Schumacher’s illness would have prevented
her from returning to work within protected time frame of 12 and 13 week she is not covered
under FMLA and RIPFMLA and therefore her FMLA claims should be dismissed.
(Memorandum at 21)
Fairfield cites Edgar v. JAC Products, Inc., 443 F.3d 501 (6th Cir. 2006) as a case similar to
this matter (Memorandum at 20). In that case, the Court held that the Defendant was entitled

13

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 14 of 20

to Summary Judgment finding that the employee suffered no harm from Defendant’s termination
because she would not have been able to return to work at the end of the statutory period. Based
on this finding Fairfield argues even if Schumacher properly supported her FMLA leave her
termination can be justified because she would not have been able to return to work at the end of the
statutory period and therefore suffered no harm. Employees seeking relief under the FMLA
entitlement theory can do so by showing that the employer’s wrongful denial of their entitlement
caused them harm Ragsdale v. Wolverine Worldwide, Inc.,535 U.S. 81, 84 (2002).
Here, Fairfield provides its employees whose disability exceeds the time periods covered
by Short Term Disability and FMLA leave with a Long Term Disability benefit (Schumacher
Deposition, Defendant’s Exhibit 5, Fairfield Bates Numbered FFR-0002660). This Long Term
Disability program provides compensation to the employee while he or she is disabled.
Schumacher was harmed when she lost the benefit of that Long Term Disability program and its
compensation when she was wrongfully denied her FMLA entitlement and terminated.
Schumacher’s Retaliation Claims
1. Title VII
Schumacher complained before the Equal Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) of
discriminatory treatment and harassment by Fairfield. (Amended Complaint, Exhibit 1.) Her claim
that Hutnick retaliated against her for complaining that he discriminated against her is related to the
complaint she made before the EEOC. “Retaliation Claims are preserved as long as the retaliation is
reasonably related to and grows out of the discrimination complained of to the agency.” Clockedile
v. New Hampshire Department of Corrections, 245 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2003)
To prove retaliation under VII Schumacher must establish that (1) she engaged in
protected activity (2) she suffered an adverse employment action after or contemporaneous with

14

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 15 of 20

such activity (3) there exist a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse job action.
Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 (1 stCir. 1994)
Fairfield argues that Schumacher never engaged in protected conduct (Memorandum at 23).
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) defines protected conduct as opposition
to any practice made unlawful under Title VII and the ADEA. The EEOC holds that this protected
opposition applies when an individual explicitly or implicitly communicates to his or her employer a
belief that its activity constitutes a form of employment discrimination and that a complaint about
alleged employment discrimination made to a co-worker constitutes protected opposition. Appendix
E-10, EEOC Compliance Manual Section 8: Retaliation 3 -4 (1998)
In determining whether conduct is protected opposition, a court must balance the setting is
which the activity arises and the interest and motivations of both employer and employee.
Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology, 545 F.2d 222 (1st . Cir. 1976)
Here, Schumacher complained to coworkers about discriminatory comments made by her
supervisor Hutnick after he became very angry with her. Her complaint was reported to Hutnick by
these same coworkers. Hutnick made a report of Schumacher’s complaint and entered it into of her
personnel file. Personnel files are the property of Fairfield Resorts, and access to the information
they contain is restricted to Fairfield management (Schumacher Deposition, Defendant’s Exhibit 5,
Fairfield Bates Numbered FFR-000295). Shortly thereafter, Hutnick demoted and terminated
Schumacher’s employment. Schumacher’s complaint is protected conduct because she reasonably
believed that Hutnick’s conduct violated Title VII. Benoit v. Tech. Mfg. Corp, 331 F.3d 1669 (1 st
Cir. 2003)
2. FMLA - RIPFMLA

15

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 16 of 20

To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Schumacher must show (1) that she was
engaged in a protected activity (here requesting FMLA leave); (2) that she suffered an adverse
employment action (here being fired); (3) that there was some possibility of a causal connection
between the employees protected activity and the employers adverse employment action, in that the
two were not wholly unrelated. Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 159-60 (1st
Cir. 1998)
Fairfield argues that Schumacher has failed to specify what activity protected by the
FMLA she was engaged in which forms the predicate of her retaliation claim (Memorandum at
23). Schumacher must show a causal link between her termination and a retaliatory animus on the
part ofFairfieldColburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Division, 429 F.3d 325 (1st Cir
2005).
Here, Schumacher’s protected conduct was returning to Fairfield as requested medical
leave documents provided by Fairfield requesting FMLA leave (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 7,
Exhibit 6). Shortly after receiving Schumacher’s medical certification forms and a Physicians
Statement mailed by Dr. Gloor’s office on April 16, 2004 (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶¶ 12,13,
Exhibits, 9,10). Hutnick terminated Schumacher in a letter from Fairfield dated April 21, 2004,
terminating her employment (Schumacher Affidavit, ¶16, Exhibit 13).

Fairfield breeched its employment contract with Schumacher when it
demoted and terminated her from employment for discriminatory reasons
Fairfield argues that despite the employment agreement it had with Schumacher her
breech of contract claim should be dismissed because she was an employee at will and that she
has adduced no evidence that it breeched any terms of that agreement. In addition, Fairfield

16

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 72

Filed 01/26/2007

Page 17 of 20

argues that this agreement had nothing to do with the continuation or termination of her
employment (Memorandum at 24).
Schumacher submits she entered into a written employment contract with Fairfield on
February 13, 2003 (Schumacher Deposition, Defendant’s Exhibit 4, Affidavit ¶ 3). That the
employment at will is a rule of construction, not a substantive limitation on contract formation
(Restatement (Second) of Agency § 442 (1971) (the general rule “is not a substantive limitation on the
enforceability of employment contracts but merely a rule of construction’”) (Toussaint v. Blue
Cross & Blue Shield of Michigan, 292 N.W.2d 880, 884 (1980). A contract is an agreement between
two or more people or entities, which creates an obligation to do or not to do a certain thing. The
elements of a contract are an offer, an acceptance of the offer, legal consideration, mutuality of
agreement and mutuality of obligation. Smith v. Boyed, 553 A.2d 131 (R.I. 1989); Lamareaux v.
Burrillville Racing Assn. 161 A.2d 213; 91 R.I. 94 (R.I. 1960)
Here Schumacher’s written agreement with Fairfield contained an offer, an acceptance of the
offer, legal consideration, mutuality of agreement and mutuality of obligation. Fairfield made an
offer of employment that Schumacher accepted. They had a bargained for exchange of work for pay
providing legal consideration to which they mutually agreed establishing a mutual obligation. In
addition, Clause 7 (Indemnification Clause) of the employment contract also incorporates all the
above elements in the agreement.
In the case of Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. v. Antonelli 790 A.2d 1113, 1115 (R.I. 2002)
the Court stated that it is well established in Rhode Island that virtually every contract contains an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between the parties. That the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing imposes a limitation upon one party adversely impacting

the contract’s value to the other party Rhode Island Charities Trust v. Englehard Corp., 109 F.
Supp.2.d 66, 73 (D.R.I. 2000).
The standard used in determining whether the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing has been breeched is whether or not the actions in question are free from arbitrary or
unreasonable conduct Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 66 F.Supp.2d.317, 329
(D.R.I. 1999). That good faith, under a subjective standard, is defined as honesty in fact Reid v,
Key Bank of S. Maine, Inc.821 F.2d9,14(1stCir. 1987).
Here, Fairfield breeched the covenant of good faith and fair dealing contained in its
agreement with Schumacher when it denied her FMLA entitlement and terminated her from
employment for discriminatory reasons.

Fairfield should be estopped from denying as enforceable the promise made in
its Policy Manual of equal treatment in all aspects of employment.
Fairfield argues that Schumacher cannot sustain her claim for estoppel or detrimental
reliance based on statements in its employee handbook (Memorandum at 26). It argues that
Schumacher was subject to discharge for any permissible reason at any time that any reliance by
her on promises regarding employment are unreasonable citing Galloway v. Roger Williams
University,777 A.2d 148. 150 (R.I. 2000). However, this analysis is not applicable to the present
matter. Unlike the Plaintiff in Galloway, Schumacher had a written contract and a right to
continued employment. She was demoted and discharged not for permissible reasons but for
discriminatory reasons. When she was discharged her agreement with Fairfield contained an
enforceable covenant of good faith and fair dealing that Fairfield breeched when it terminated her.

Fairfield’s Policy Manual contains a provision promising not to discriminate and to provide
equal opportunity to all employees in every aspect of employment. (Schumacher Deposition,
Defendant’s Exhibit, 5 Fairfield Bates Numbered FFR-000212) After learning that Schumacher had
complained about his discriminatory comments. Hutnick her supervisor demoted her, denied her
FMLA leave entitlement and terminated her. Schumacher submits that Fairfield’s Policy Manual
was incorporated into its employment contract with Schumacher and that its promise not to
discriminate became part of her contract. Terms of a written contract can be modified by a Policy
Hand book, which then becomes part of the contract, when the contract expressly provides that it
will be performed in accordance with the policies, rules and regulations of the employer. Robinson
v. Bd. Of Trustees of East Central Junior College, 477 So. 2d 1352,1353 (Miss. 1985) Here, Clause
8 (a) of Schumacher’s employment agreement with Fairfield incorporates compliance with
Fairfield’s Policy Manual as an enforceable term of the agreement. A written personnel policy
promising non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity has been held to create an
enforceable contract right. Stahl v. Sun Microsys 19 F.3d 533 (10th Cir. 1994) Implied contract
rights were created by handbook provision promising non discrimination.Black

v. Baker Oil

Tools, 107 F.3d 1457 (10 th Cir. 1997)

SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE DENIED IN THIS CASE
Schumacher has shown there are genuine issues of material facts in dispute that would
preclude summary judgment.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons Fairfield’s request for summary judgment should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
Plaintiff Shirley Schumacher
