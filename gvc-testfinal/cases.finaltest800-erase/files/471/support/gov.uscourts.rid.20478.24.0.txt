Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 4 of 32 PageID #: 118

PRELJMTNARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff Shirley Schumacher unilaterally took a leave of absence, refused to provide the
information necessary to substantiate the need for that leave, and lost her job as a direct result of

that r e h a l . By this action, however, she seeks to shift the blame to her former employer for her

discharge, imagining nefarious motives as causes, all the while refusing to see that her poor
choices were the real cause. No reasonable jury, properly motivated, could come to any other
conclusion.

Schumacher was employed as a Sales Manager at the Newport, Rhode Island off~ceof
Fairfield Resorts where she was responsible for the sale of timeshares at resort properties. Her
tenure was marked by several

documented performance infractions. By the beginning of

February 2004, she knew her supervisor was not satisfied with her performance and that she was

about to be demoted for poor performance.

Schumacher applied for FMLA in February 2004, following her return from a scheduled
vacation. However, CORE, Inc. (CORE), the third-party administrator of FM~eld'smedical
leaves denied such leave because she refused to return the medical certification forms. As a

result, she failed to qualify for FMLA or RIPFMLA and her employment was administratively
terminated effective March 30,2004. She was invited to re-apply for employment when released
by her physician. Schumacher did not re-apply, nor did she seek alternate employment. Instead,

she collected benefits pursuant to the state temporary disability insurance program for several

months. She also began collecting retirement benefits fiom Social Security.
According to S c h m h e r and her treating physician, she was initialb unable to work
from February 2004 through at least September of 2004

-- a~proxhatelvseven (7)months

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 5 of 32 PageID #: 119

after going out on leave. Accordingly, there is no scenario under which she could have returned
within the period protected under FMLA or RIPFMLA.
Furthermore, Schumacher's discrimination, contract, estoppel and retaliation claims are

nothing more than an attempt to blame others for her own shortcomings. Schumacher never

complained of discrimination or harassment at work despite weI1-publicized resources for doing
so. She was hlly aware that she failed to meet the legitimate expectations of her employer.
Schumacher cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination and cannot show that the

legitimate reason for her termination was a pretext for discrimination.

In short, there are no genuine issues of facts for trial. By her refusal to substantiate the
need for an extended leave, Schumacher failed to qualify for FMLA and caused her own

termination. Fairfield requests the Court grant its motion for summaq judgment and dismiss
Schumacher's Amended Complaint in its entirety.

Background

Fairfield is in the business of selling time shares at resort properties. (Statement of

Undisputed Material Facts ("Statement")

7

1.) Schumacher initially began working as a

salesperson in the time share industry in 1983 for a corporate predecessor to Fairfield known as
The Inn Group. (Statement 7 2.) After changes in corporate ownership, Schumacher became a

Sales Manager, who was responsible for the recruitment and management of sdes associates.
Schumacher would also assist sales associates with closing sales. (Statement 7 3.)

The sales force at Fairfield's Newport office is diverse in both age and gender.
Schumacher was 63 years old at the time of her termination. (Statement 7 4.) Like Schumacher, a
The following facts are drawn from the Statement of Undisputed Marerial Factf submitted by FairfieId
pursuant to Local Rule 56, and the Appendix of Exhibits submitted therewith.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 6 of 32 PageID #: 120

number of sales employees were both female and in their 60's. In fact, Schumacher admits that
one of her former colleagues, Tijuana Goldstein, a female sales associate who still works for
Fairheld is 78 years of age. (Statement 7 5.) Of the one hundred individuals employed as sales

associates in the years 2004 and 2005, sixty-three were over the age of 40. (Statement 7 6.)
Schumacher did not have any written agreement with Fairfield concerning her

employment other than a Salesperson Agreement dated February 13,2003, that covered, among
other things confidentiality and compensation. (Statement 17.) That Agreement expressly states
that Schumacher is employed "at-will." (Statement 7 7.) Schumacher admitted in her deposition
that no one from Fairfield promised that she would be employed for any particular period of
time. (Statement 7 8.) Schumacher's status as an employee "at-will" was further confirmed in

Fairfield's Human Resources Policy and Procedures Manual ("ITPM"). (Statement 7 9.)

Fah5eld Resort's PoIicy Prohibiting Discrimination

In addition, through its PPM Fairfield promulgated and enforced a strict policy
prohibiting discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Fairfield published and promoted

this policy through various means to ensure that all employees were aware of their right to make
internal complaints and the procedures for doing so. Schumacher admitted in her deposition that
she received a copy of the PPM. (Statement f 10.) The PPM states, in pertinent part:
102 Equal Employment Opportunity

Fairfield Resorts is committed to providing Equal Employment Opportunity
("EEO") to all applicants and employees without regard. to race, color, religion,
sexual preference/orientation, age, marital status, national origin, citizenship,
physical or mental disability, or status as a disabled or Vietnam Em.Veteran or
any other characteristic protected by law.

...**.**.*,........*....*,...
Employees who believe that they have been discriminated against or unlawfully
harassed should discuss their concerns with their supervisor or if this is not

appropriate, contact their Human Resources manager or call the toll-free
Employee Relations Hotline at 1-877-756-HELP.

(Statement f 10.)

Schumacher's Failure to Report Discrimination or Harassment
Schumacher was well aware of the company's hotline and her ability to report
harassment. (Statement fi 11.) Schumacher received a copy of Fairfield's policy entitled "Strictly

Prohibited Conduct,"' wbich, among other things, prohibited abusive Ianguage and sexual
harassment. (Statement

1 12.) Schumacher was also aware that Faifield posted information

concerning empIoyrnent policies and laws at its Newport facility. (Statement 7 13.) She knew
that if she had human resource issues, she could contact Bill Sbrocco, in Human Resources.
(Statement 7 14.) Despite these facts, Schumacher admits she never complained of un1awfi.d or

discriminatory conduct during her employment. (Statement 7 15.)

Schumacher's Histow of Performance Deficiencies
Plaintiffs work performance was marred by performance deficiencies during her tenure

with Fairfield. Schumacher received a Notice of Corrective Action fiom her then supervisor,
John Thomas, Vice-president of Sales, on Jutle 14,2002. (Statement fi 16.) Among other things,
and as Schumacher exhibited throughout her employment, this document noted that Schumacher

"projects a negative image when sales goals are not being met." (Statement 7 16.) Schumacher

was issued a second Notice of Corrective Action only two months Iater on August 15, 2002,
noting, among other things that she had the "highest cancellation rate" among the sales
managers. (Statement 7 17.) Schumacher admitted in her deposition that if she were to receive a

third Notice of Corrective Action, her employment would be terminated. (Statement fi 18.)

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 8 of 32 PageID #: 122

According to Schumacher, Thomas used vulgar language and told dirty jokes in her

presence, although not referring to her. (Statement

19-21.1~
Thomas was transferred to a

different Fairfield facility in September of 2003 and was eventually replaced by Joseph Hutnick

on September 1, 2003. (Statement f 22.) Schumacher admits that the alleged inappropriate
remarks to which she was subjected were made only by Thomas, and did not continue once
Hutnick became her supervisor. (Statement

7

23.) Schumacher described her working

relationship with Hutnick as positive. "I liked the man. I had nothing against him." (Statement 7
24.)

At the time Hutnick became Fairfield's Vice-president of Sales in Newport, Schumacher
was the Sales Manager for a program known as the Discovery Program. (Statement 7 25.) In this

program, potential clients that decided not to purchase a time share were offered the opportunity
to enroll in a trial program at a lower cost. (Statement 7 26.) Hutnick phased out the Discovery

Program and replaced it with another sales program known as the Exit Program, making
Schumacher the acting manager as of January I, 2004. (Statement 7 27.)

Schwacher's Disruptive and Insubordinate Conduct
The performance and attitude problems that were noted by Thomas continued under
Hutnick. For example, sdes associates were assigned to meet with prospective customers based

on a scheduled rotation. (Statement

7 28.) In the beginning of January 2004, an

issue arose

regarding whether one sales associate, Don Pearson, had mistakenly been placed in h n t of
another sales associate, Jim Amelia, in the rotation. (Statement 7 29.) This became an issue
because Pearson closed a $68,000 sale with the prospective customer to whom he had been
mistakenly assigned. (Statement 7 29.) The situation was addressed and the sales associate who

While unable to recall many specifics, she claims Thomas referred to his own anatomy, stated "Fthat c_,
you b o w , screw her. That damn Donna over there doesn't belong here, she's only here for the f-ing
gifts."
(Statement Tn[ 20,2 1.)

had been bumped, Amelia, was satisfied with the outcome. (Statement f( 29.) However,
Schumacher, who was not involved in the situation, attempted to instigate a dispute. (Statement fi
29.) Schumacher told Amelia that she heard he was "screwed and suggested he caIl the integrity

hotline to report Hutnick. (Statement T[ 29.) Three employees reported Schumacher's disruptive

behavior by which she sought to undermine the Vice President to whom she reported. (Statement

l T 29.)
After several weeks of running the Exit Program, Hutnick met with Schumacher to

discuss the fact that not a single sale had been made. (Statement f 30.) Schumacher refused to
take responsibility for this fact, blaming the Exit Program itself (Statement 7 31 .) It was apparent
to Hutnick that Schumacher, "had become a serious liability. She is a poor manager with no

leadership qualities, and poor work habits. To make matters worse she like[d] to gossip and
spread rumors. She needs to removed of her management duties." (Statement 7 3 1.)

The following day, in January, 2004, Schumacher approached Hutnick and claimed that
she called Wisconsin Dells, another Fairfeld location Hutnick had pointed to as an example of a
successful Exit Program, and determined that it did not have an Exit Program. (Statement 7 32.)

In effit, she called her supervisor a liar suggesting that Hutnick mislead her. (Statement 32.)

Hutnick regarded Schumacher's conduct as insubordination and a challenge to his authority.
(Statement 7 32.) Hutnick explained to Schmcher that Wisconsin Dells did in fact have an Exit

Program and that it was run through the front line managers. (Statement

Schumacher, in this conversation, Hutnick called her a "c-"

that she never made any complaint during her employment about Hutnick or Thomas. (Statement

l T 34.)
Schumacher's Unauthorized Leave

On February 1, 2004, Schumacher left on a pre-planned vacation to Florida. However,

due to what she alleges to be work-related stress and depression, she returned early from the
vacation, but she did not return to work at Fairfield. (Statement 35.) Instead, she attempted to
take an extended leave of absence allegedly for what turned out to be "situational stress,"

although that was not timely or properly communicated by her. (Statement 7 41.) She concedes
that when she went out on leave, she understood that Hutnick was contemplating demoting her.
(Statement 7 36.)

Fairfield utilized CORE as its third-party administrator for handling of leaves of absence.
(Statement 7 39.) It was CORE'S task to determine eligibility for FMLA and communicate with

medical providers to obtain the requisite support. (Statement

7 39.) It was

also tasked with

communicating directly with employees concerning the status of leave requests and the need to

return to work in the event that a leave was not approved. (Statement 7 57.)

Accordingly,

CORE contacted Schumacher to determine whether her leave qualified for protection under the
FMLA d o r FUPFMLA. (Statement 7 58.)
For reasons that are neither clear nor relevant, Schumacher did not wish to have CORE

monitor her leave of absence. On March 1,2004, she advised CORE that she had been approved
for TDI benefits and did not want CORE to process her claim for short-term disability benefits.
(Statement

7 59.)

Her physician's records confirm that Schumacher "prefer[red] not to have

CORE Workability forms filled out." (Statement fi 40.) The forms necessary for her to receive
FMLA leave were not returned to CORE prior to her discharge. (Statement 7 60.)

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 11 of 32 PageID #: 125

Schumacher did send a doctor's note to Fairfield indicating that she would be unable to

return to work until April 11, 2004, due to an unidentified "medical reason" (Statement 41.)
Schumacher sent a second note to Fairfield indicating that she would be out until May 11,2004,

due to "situational stress" (Statement 7 41.) Other than these notes, Schumacher.admitted that
she did not provide any documentation to support her request for leave to either Fairfield or

CORE prior to the termination of her employment. (Statement T[ 42.) Notably, representatives of
FairlField made several attempts to telephone Schumacher during her leave of absence.
(Statement 7 43.) However, Schumacher's phone was disconnected and as a result these attempts

were to no avail. (Statement 7 43.) Schumacher made no effort during her leave of absence to
contact her supemisor or any human resource personnel to discuss when or if she planned to
return to work. (Statement 7 43.)

FMLA Denial and Termination
Since Schumacher did not provide proper documentation to support a request for FMLA
leave, CORE deemed that request denied. Accordingly, Schumacher's employment was
terminated by letter dated April 21,2004. Schumacher was permitted to reapply for employment

once her doctor approved her to retum to work. (Statement fi 44.) She never did. (Statement 7
45.)

After Schmacher's refusal to supply the requisite information to support her leave,

Schumacher appealed the denial of FMLA to CORE. (Statement 7 46.) Tellingly, in her appeal
letter Schumwhm wrote that she had "spoke[n] with Core in feb (sic) and informed them I had

chosen to go with T.D.I. instead of FMLA." (Statement 7 46.) Yet,both Schumacher and her
physician, Dr. James Gloor, made clear that Schumacher was "disabled" and unable to return to

work for a period clearly in excess of the 13-weeks covered by the FMLA and RIPFMLA.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 12 of 32 PageID #: 126

(Statement f137,47.15 By the time of her deposition, Schumacher claimed that she was unable
'to return to work until at least early 2005

-

approximately one year after she went out on

leave for "stress and anxiety." (Statement 7 37.)

Following her termination, Schumacher collected temporary disability benefits from the
State of Rhode Island for a period of 26 weeks. (Statement 7 48.) In addition, Schumacher

collected unemployment. (Statement fi 49.) She also began collecting Social Security Retirement
Benefits as of June 2004 (Statement 149.) Consistent with her retirement, she did not apply for
work with Fairfield or anyone else. (Statement fi 5 0.)

LEGAL ARGUMENT
THE COURT SHOULD DISlMISS SCELUMACHER'S DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS
BECAUSE SHE CANNOT ESTABLISH THAT FAIRFUZLD TERMINATED HER
EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF HER AGE OR SEX

In Counts I, 11, IVYand V of her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to
unlawfd discrimination because of her gender and age in violation of Title VII, the ADEA, the
FEPA, and the RIcRA.~ Schurnacher's discrimination claims, however, are fatally deficient and
must be dismissed on the following grounds: (i) she cannot establish aprimafacie case because

she was not performing her job at a level that met Fairfield's legitimate expectations; and (ii) she
cannot show that Fairfield's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment decisions
at issue were a pretext for discrimination.

5

Although Schumacher initidly asserted claims of disability discrimination in her Charge of Discrimination before
the EEOC and Rhode I s h d Commission for Human Rights, no such claim was brought in this litigation.
Plaintiffs claims are couched in terms of violations of various federal laws and their state equivalents. Rhode
Island courts "ha[ve] adopted the federal legal framework to provide structure to our state employment
discrimination statutes." Neri v. Ross-Simons. Inc., 897 A.2d 42,48 (R.I. 2006); see also Newport Shipyard. Inc. v.
Rhode Island Comm'n for Human Ri&ts, 484 A.2d 893 (R.I.1984); Casey v. Town of Portsmouth, 86 1 A.2d 1032,
1036 (R.I. 2004); DonnelIv v. Rhode Island Bd. of Governors, 1 10 F.3d 2 , 6 (1st Cir. 1997). Therefore, Fairfield's
arguments with respect to Plaintiffs federal claims apply with equal force to her state cIaims.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 13 of 32 PageID #: 127

Schumacher's Cannot Establish of A Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
Employment discrimination claims are analyzed under the burden-shifting method of
proof outlined by the United States Supreme Court in McDonnell-Douglas v. Green, 41 1 U.S.
792 (1973), Texas Dep't of C o r n . Affairs v. Burdine, 450 US.248 (1981), and amplified in &.

Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. SO2 (1993). "[TJhe plaintiffs [protected status] ... must
actually have played a role in the employer's decisionmaking process and have had a
determinative or motivating influence on the outcome." Reeves v. Sanderson Plwnbin~Prods.,

Inc..530 U.S. 133, 141 (2000). A prima facie case of discriminationrequires that:
(])[she] was at least forty years of age [or in a protected
class]; (2) [her] job performance met the employer's
legitimate expectations; (3) the employer subjected [her] to
an adverse employment action (e-g., an actual or
constructive discharge); and (4) the employer had a
continuing need for the. services provided by the position
from which the claimant was discharged.'

Gonzdez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63,68 (1st Cir. 2002)).

Both age and gender claims require

proof that the employee was meeting an employer's legitimate expectations. Fontanez-Nunez v.

Janssen Ortho LLC, 447 F.3d 50 (1' Cir. 20061, citing Hoffman v. Amlicators Sales and Serv.,

Inc.,439 F.3d 9, 17 (1" Cir. 2006); and Smith v. Stratus Computer, hc.,40 F.3d I 1,15 (1'' Cir.
1994) cert.denied, 514 U.S. 1108 (1995).
Here, Schumacher cannot establish a prima facie case of age or sex discrimination

because it is undisputed that she had not been meeting Fairfield's legitimate expectations. As

was described above, Schumacher received two Notices of Corrective Action in 2002 when
Thomas was her supervisor. Schwnacher acknowledged in her deposition that a third Notice of
Corrective Action would have resulted in her termination. Schumacher's performance issues

continued into 2004 even after Thomas' departure h m the Newport facility where Schumacher

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 14 of 32 PageID #: 128

worked. According to Schumacher, just prior to her unauthorized leave for "stress," Hutnick had
considered demoting her after noting her performance deficiencies. (Statement 7 36.)

Schumacher's Inability to Prove Pretext

Even assuming that Schumacher could establish a prima facie case of discrimination,

which she cannot, the inquiry does not end. '"[The burden of production shifts to the defendantemployer to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action."
@. If a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination is articdated by the defendant-

employer, "the presumption afforded to the plaintiffs prima facie case disappears, and the

plaintiff must adduce sufficient creditable evidence that age was a motivating factor in the
challenged employment action."
that discrimination is the

Id. Crucially, ''the

... motivating factor."

ultimate burden on the plaintiff is to show

Fite v. Digital Eaui~.Corn., 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st

Cir. 2000).
Fairfield's legitimate reason for Schumacher's termination was her failure to properly
support a request for FMLA leave. This is clearly a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the

termination of Schumacher's employment. Schurnacher refused to cooperate with CORE and did
not timely support her FMLA leave with medical documentation as required. As such, the burden

would then ordinarily shift back to Schumacher to produce ~ ~ c i e evidence
nt
supportive of her
position that her age or sex was the determinative factor in her termination. McKennon v.
Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 5 13 U.S. 352, 36 1 (1 995).
However, no such evidence exists. When asked in her deposition what facts she relies
upon in support of her age claim, Schumacher referenced one trivial matter, unrelated to her age

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 15 of 32 PageID #: 129

or gender, that was fxed when she complaind7 Schumacher offered no evidence that younger

employees as a group were more favorably treated than those who were older. Indeed, the facts
belie any age-based animus. As Schumacher knows, a large percentage of Fairfield's sales force

in Newport is over the age of 40. 63 out of 100 sales positions held during the years 2004 and
2005 alone were in the protected age category.8 Schumacher conceded in her deposition that

there were many Paifield employees and managers at the Newport facility where she worked
who were in their 60's and 70's. (Statement 7 52). The record is devoid of any evidence of age-

bias, making summary judgment appropriate. & Hoffhan, 439 F;3d at 18.
Likewise, Schumacher cannot rebut the legitimate business reason for her termination
artictdated by Faifield with respect to her claim of sex discrimination. When asked what

evidence she had to support that claim, Plaintiff could only respond, "I was the only female
manager and they did not want me in that position." (Statement T[ 53.) Plaintiffs conclusory and

self-serving statement is completely inadequate to avoid summary judgment. Schwnacher knows
that she did not propedy support her FMLA leave and that her termination was justified.
SCHUMACHER CANNOT ESTABLISH THAT SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO A
HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND SUCH CLAMS SHOULD BE BARRED AS A
MATTER OF LAW
The Plaintiff does not specifically plead any hostile environment claims in her
Complaint, but asserted them in her Charge before the EEOC and Rhode Island Commission for
Human Rights. She mentioned nothing of sexual harassment when asked to relate the facts
supporting her claim of sex discrimination. (Statement fi 53.) In addition, the alleged statements

7

She testified that she had to occasionally work late, stating "Like when I had to have my people come in and work
the night shift, and I did it for a month. When I went to my superior and told him that I felt it was time that some
other managers have their teams do it, He said it was okay, I didn't have to do it anymore." (Statement 7 51).
8

There are not 100 sales people working for Fairfield in Newport at any one time. Rather, this number represents all
individuals who held sales positions in the years 2004 and 2005, including those who have since terminated.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 16 of 32 PageID #: 130

were neither severe nor pervasive, thus failing to create any hostile environment as a malter of

law.

Moreover, it is undisputed that Schumacher never complained of any hostile work

environment. Accordingly, any such claims are barred pursuant to the finnative

defense

recognized by the Supreme Court in Faragher v. Citv of Boca Raton, 524 US. 775, 787-89
(1 998).

Plaintiff's Burden Zn Establishing A ~ o s t i l Environment
e
Claim
A hostile work environment is one in which "the workplace is permeated with

discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the
conditions of the victim's employment." Harris v. Forklift Svs., hc., 510 U.S. 17,21 (1 993). In
order to establish a hostile environment claim, Plaintiff must show: (1) that she is a member of a
protected class; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment based on her sex; (3) the

harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of her employment

and create an abusive environment; (4) the objectionable conduct was both objectively and
subjectively offensive; and (5) employer liability. Faraaher v. Citv ofBoca Raton, 524 U.S. 775,

787-89 (1998).
In determining whether or not a work environment is hostile, a court will look at: (1) the
frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (2) its severity, i.e., whether it is physically threatening
or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (3) whether it unreasonably interferes with an
employee's work performance. Harris,510 U.S.at 21. The Supreme Court has also stated that

"teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to
discriminatory changes in the t e n n s and conditions of employment." Faraher, 524 U.S. at 788.
The key inquiry in a hostile environment claim is whether members of one sex, but not

the other, are made to suffer disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment. Harris, 510

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 17 of 32 PageID #: 131

U.S at 25 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). Thus, "workplace harassment, even harassment between
men and women, is [not] automaticaIIy discrimination because of sex merely because the words

used have a sexual connotation."

Id.

For example, there is no sexual harassment where an

employee simply uses crude or inappropriate language in front of employees or draws a vulgar

picture, without directing the conduct to women in general. See, e.e;., Brown v. Henderson, 257
F.3d 246,250,256 (2d Cir. 2001) See also Lyle v. Warner Eros. Television Prods., 42 CaI. Rptr.

3d 2, 15, 132 P.3d 21 1 (Cal. 2006)(no hostile work environment in case involving writers for hit
television show who regularly engaged in nondirected sexual antics and sexual talk).

Furthermore, "Title VII is not intended to serve as a workplace civility code, is not
designed to purge the workplace of vulgarity, and does not countenance a federal cause of action

for unpleasantness." Jennin~sv. Univ. of N.C., 444 F.3d 255, 269 (4'h Cir. 2006) (citing
Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788). Rather, that statute is directed at conduct that is so "severe or
pervasive" as "to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment." Faraher,

524 U.S. at 788.

Harassment that is occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial is insufficient.

"[Olffensive utterances and offhand comments do not amount to discriminatory changes in the
terms and conditions of employment." RusseIl v. Enter. Rent-a-Car Co. of R.T., 160 F. Supp. 2d

239, 261 (D.R.I.2001) (reference to women as "hotties" did not create hostile work
environment).

Schumacher's Inability To Establish A Hostile Work Environment
Here, Schumacher cannot show conduct that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter

the conditions of employment and create an abusive environment. Schumacher alleges only
three specific incidents of inappropriate language. SpecificaIIy, 1) when Thomas allegedly

discussed his "girth;" 2) when Thomas referred to another employee as a "c-,"

and 3) when

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 18 of 32 PageID #: 132

Hutnick allegedly referred to Schumacher as a "c-."

Otherwise, Schumacher referred only to

general "men talk," or "dirty talk,"' that she felt should not be used in the workplace.
However, "Title VII does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace;

it is directed only at 'discriminat[ion]

... because of ... sex."'

OncaIe v. Sundowner Offshore

Servs., Inc., 523 US. 75, 80 (1998) (emphasis supplied). See, e.lr., La Marco v.

N.Y.State

Nurses Assoc., 118 F. Supp. 2d 310,3 18 (N.D.N.Y. 2000) (interpersonal problems between men
and women wherein male defendant told female plaintiff "Go to hell, bitch," do not rise to level

of a hostile environment).
Here, even assuming for purposes of this motion that Schwnacher was actually offended
by the "men talk" or any inappropriate comment, she cannot assert a hostile environment claim.

First, based on the Harris factors, it is evident that Schumacher has not alleged sufficient facts to
support her claim. Second, there is no showing that any of the remarks were directed at
Schumacher because of her sex and most were not even directed to her at all. Third, the alleged
"men talk," was not physically threatening or humiliating. Fourth, there is no evidence that the

comments interfered in any way with Schumacher's work.

Cbims Barred Bv Statute of Limitations

Plaintiff alleges only one incident, the alleged comment by Hutnick, which falls within
the statute of limitations applicable to her Title VII and FEPA claims. Schumacher filed her

charge of discrimination with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights on September 21,
2004.9 Therefore, anything that occurred more

than one year prior to that date is time barred

pursuant to FEPA. R.I. Gen. Laws 28-5-17(a). Similarly, anything that occurred more than 300
days prior to September 21, 2004 is time barred pursuant to Title VII. 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(l).

9

The charge was dual filed with the EquaI Employment Opportunity Commission in keeping with the
Commission's practice.

-16-

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 19 of 32 PageID #: 133

However, Thomas was replaced by Hutnick on September 1, 2003. (Statement 7 23 .) Therefore,

if Thomas did make any comments, they obviously occurred prior to that date and, therefore,
outside the statute of limitations applicable to Schumacher's Title VII and FEPA claims.

Schumacher's Claims Are Barred Bv Fara~herand Ellerth

In addition to the failure to establish a hostile environment claim as a matter of law,
Schumacher's claim is barred by her failure to take advantage of Fairfield's policies and
procedures prohibiting discrimination and harassment. Employers such as Fairfield that
promulgate anti-discrimination policies are entitled to an affirmative defense against hostile
environment claims when employees fail to utilize the company's reasonable procedures.

The Faragher defense is comprised of two components: (I) that the employer exercised
reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior; and (2) that the
plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective
opportunities provided by the employer or to otherwise avoid harm. Fara&er, 118 S.Ct. at 229193. "Evidence that the plaintiff failed to utilize the company's complaint procedure will normally

suffice to satisfy [the company's] burden under the second element of the defense." Barren v.

Applied Radiant Energy Corn., 240 F.3d 262,267 (4th Cir. 2001); see also Fara&er, 524 U.S. at
806 (a victim of sexual harassment "has a duty to use such means as are reasonable under the
circumstancesto avoid or minimize the damages that result from violations of the statute9').

Such procedures are of course useless if the affected employees
fail to avail themselves of them. At some point, employees must
be required to accept responsibility for alerting their employers to
the possibility of harassment. Without such a requirement, it is
difficult to see how [antidiscrimination statutes'] deterrent
purposes are to be served, or how employers can possibly avoid
liability [in a discrimination case]. Put simply, an employer cannot
combat harassment of which it is unaware.
Fierro v. Saks Fifth Ave., 13 F.Supp2d 481,492 (S.D.N.Y. 1998).

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 20 of 32 PageID #: 134

In this case, it is undisputed that Fairfield maintained a policy and procedures manual,
posted its policy at PIaintiff s workplace, and operated an employee hotline to which employees
could report instances of discrimination. Schumacher admits that she received the manual, was
aware that the company's policies were posted, and was aware that she could either consult a

company human resources representative with any employment-related questions or could call
the company's hotline with any concerns about the lawfdness of Fairfield's actions.
Schumacher admits she did not avail herself of the company's complaint procedures. Her claim

is plainly barred by Paragher, 524 U.S. at 808 and Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765 (a showing of "any
unreasonable failure [by the employee] to use any complaint procedure provided by the
employer

... will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of

the defense." (emphasis added).

THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS SCHUMACHER'S FMLA AND RIPFMLA CLAIMS
BECUASE SHE FAILED TO OUALIFY FOR PROTECTION OR TIMELY SUPPORT
HER LEAVE WITH APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION
In counts 111 and VI, Schumacher asserts that her termination violated the FMLA and the

RIPFMLA." The FMLA entitles "eligible employees to, inter alia, 'a
leave,'

...

total of 12 workweeks of

for 'a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the

functions of ber] position."' Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Division, 429 F.3d
325, 330 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 29 U.S.C.

55

2612(a)(l)(D), 2612(b)). (Emphasis added.)

"With limited exceptions . . . upon the employee's return from a uualified leave, the employer
must reinstate the employee to the same position or an alternate position with equivalent pay,

10

RIPFMLA provides for a maximum of thirteen (13) weeks of leave during a 24 month period; the FMLA provides
for twelve (12) weeks during a 12 month period. Other than the difference in time allowance, Plaintiffs cIaims are
identical for both statutes.Moreover, given plaintiffs inability to return to work at the expiration of 13 weeks, she
cannot assert a valid FMLA or RIPFMLA claim. In her deposition, plaintiff stated that she was unable to return to
work until early 2005 - nearly one year after she took leave for "situational stress." Her physician testified that she
could not have ~eturnedto work until at September 2004 at the earliest.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 21 of 32 PageID #: 135

benefits, and working conditions without loss of accrued seniority."

Id. (citing Hodgens v.

General Dvnamics Corn., 144 F.3d 15 1, 159 (1 st Cir. 1998)).
In this case, Schumacher applied for and was denied FMLA leave because she failed to
timely provide any documentation to support her request for leave to COKE. This was no

inadvertent failure; rather as a notation from Schumacher's physician's office indicates, she did
not want her doctor to provide information to CORE. Schumacher confirmed this statement

when she spoke to CORE and then wrote in her appeal letter that she "had chosen to go with

T.D.I. Instead of FMLA." (Statement T[TI 46, 59.) As a result of Schumacher's refusal to provide
information to CORE, she was denied FMLA leave.

The FMLA expressly grants employers the right to request a medical certification to
support the need for leave and requires employees to provide a certification in a "timely
manner." 29 U.S.C.2613(a). The federal regulations implementing the FMLA provide that if an

employee does not produce a certification, "the leave is not FMLA leave." 29 C.F.R. 825.31 I@).
As such, Schumacher's failure to provide CORE with the medical certification is fatal to her

claim. See e.e. Rager v Dade Behrinp, Inc., 210 F.3d 776 (7'h Cir. 2000); Hurt v. Ecolab. Inc.

2006 WL 1409520 (N.D. Tex. 2006)("[t]he failure to provide an appropriate medical
certification is fatal to a claim under the FMLA.").
Even assuming that FMLA leave had been properly supported by Schumacher, which it

was not, her medical absence would have far exceeded the 12 and 13 week period of protected
leave guaranteed by FMLA and RIPFMLA. Ra~sdalev. Wolverine Worldwide, I c . , 535 US.
81, 84 (2002) (defendant-employer was entided to summary judgment on F a A claim where

employee took 42 weeks of leave). Schumacher requested leave beginning on February 11,2004.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 22 of 32 PageID #: 136

Accordingly, her 12 week FMLA entitlement would have expired on May 5, 2004 and her 13
week RLPFMLA entitlement would have expired on May 12,2004.

In this action, it is beyond dispute that Schumacher could not have returned to work

until Se~tember2004, at the earliest, some seven months after initially taking leave.
(Statement 7 47). Indeed, according to Schumacher's testimony at her deposition, she was unable

to return to work until sometime in early 2005 - approximately one year after she went out on

her leave. (Statement fi 37.) Thus, Schwnacher's leave would not have been protected under any
circumstance and Fairfield was entitled to terminate her employment as a matter of Iaw. "[Aln
employee has no right to reinstatement 'if the employee is unable to perform an essential
function of the position because of. . . the continuation of a serious health condition."' Colburn,
429 F.3d at 332 (quoting 29 C.F.R.

5 825.214(b)).

In a case that is strikingly similar to this matter, the Sixth Circuit rejected an FMLA

claim when it. was undisputed that the employee could not have returned to work within the 12
week FMLA period, even though the employee was terminated before the expiration of that

period. Edgar v. JAC Products. Inc., 443 F. 3d 50 1 (@ Cir. 2006). In Edgar, the plaintiff went
out on a medical leave due to work related stress in September 2002. Plaintiff met shortly
thereafter with her supervisor and a human resources representative to discuss her leave. Plaintiff
was provided with a medical certification form to support her request for FMLA.

According to the company, pIaintiff was instructed to return the certification fom by
October 18, 2002. The plaintiff contended that she was told to return the form by October 21,
2002. The employer, after not receiving the form by October 18, 2002, mailed plaintiff a letter

terminating her employment on October 21, 2002. The plaintiff returned the fom on either
October 21, 2002 or the following day. Subsequent to her termination, plaintiff was deemed

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 23 of 32 PageID #: 137

unable to return to work by one of her psychiatrists until March 4,2004 - years after the date of
her leave.
The plaintiff filed suit claiming that she was denied rights to which she was entitled

under the FMLA. The District Court granted summary judgment to the employer, holding that
because the employee was not able to return to work at the time her FMLA leave would have
expired, she had no claim under the FMLA. Edgar, 443 F. 3d at 506. The Sixth Circuit upheld
the district court's dismissal of FMLA claims, noting that "the FMLA does not provide leave for

leave's sake, but instead provides leave with an expectation [that] an employee will return to

work after the leave ends," Fdgar, 443 F. 3d at 507 (quoting Throneberry v. McGehee Desha
Countv Hosp., 403 F. 3d 972,978 (8" Cir. 2005)).
In short, Schumacher failed and/or refused to cooperate with CORE and supply the
information required to entitle her to leave under FMLA and RZPFMLA. As such she was not

eligible for protection under either of these statutes. Alternatively, applying the analysis of the 6~
Circuit in JAC Products, Schumacher was unable to work until September 2004 at the earliest -

well in excess of any protected leave. There is no evidence contradicting this diagnosis. Since
Schumacher was unable to return to work within 12 or 13 weeks after taking leave, her FMLA

and RIPFMLA claims should be dismissed.
THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS SCHUMACHER'S RETALIATION CLAIMS
BECAUSE SJlE FALED TO EXRAUST ADMJNISTRATIVF, REMEDJES AND SUCH
CLAIMS AlW INSUPPORTABLE AS A MATTER OF LAW
In addition to alleging that her termination was because of her sex and age and in

violation of the FMLA and RIPFMLA, Schumacher also claims in Counts V1I and X that her
termination was in retaliation for engaging in protected activity in violation of Rhode Island

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 24 of 32 PageID #: 138

public policy, Title VII and the FMLA."

These claims should be dismissed because

Schumacher failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by including them in her EEOC and
RICHR claims with respect to Title VTI. Moreover, as to both Title Vll and FMLA, her

retaliation claims must be dismissed because Schumacher cannot establish a prima facie case of
retaliation or rebut Fairiield's legitimate business reason for her termination.

SchumachePs Failure To Exhaust Administrative Remedies

It is well settled that Title V1I requires exhaustion of administrative remedies as a
condition precedent to filing suit in federal court. Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 5 17,520 (lSfCir.

1990). The First Circuit has stated that " '[plrocedural requirements established by Congress for
gaining access to the federal courts are not to be disregarded' even in sympathetic

circumstances." Id. At 522 (quoting Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147,
152 1984)). A complaint related to that brought before the [Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission ("EEOC") 1, but which was not itself made the subject of a separate EEOC
complaint, must reasonably be expected to have been within the scope of the EEOC's

investigation in order to meet the jurisdictional prerequisite." Machado v. Frank, 767 FSupp. at
42 1 (quoting Johnson v. General Electric, 840 F.2d 132 139 (I st Cir. 1988).

In this action, Schumacher filed her administrative charge after she was discharged, but
did not make a retaliation claim. She cannot now decide to add it when she codd have raised it,

but did not, in front of the agency. She failed to exhaust administrative remedies md her

retaliation claim must be dismissed.
Schumacher's Inability to Establish A Prima Facie Claim of Retaliation

Even assuming that the Court.finds that Schumacher properly exhausted administrative
remedies, she cannot establish any claim of unlawful retaliation. In order to prove retaliation
" Plaintiffs

retaliation cIaim in violation of public policy will be discussed below.

-22-

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 25 of 32 PageID #: 139

under Title VII, "a plaintiff must establish that (1) she engaged in protected conduct;, (2) she
experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the
protected conduct and the adverse employment action."

Calero-Cerer! v. United States

Devartment of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 25 (1st Cir. 2004); Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme
Quimica P.R.,447 F.3d 105,113-14 (1st Cir. 2006).
As with her other claims, Schumacher has failed to present a genuine issue of material

fact. When asked at her deposition to state the facts supporting her retaliation claim, she
answered "I can't remember right now."

(Statement

7

56).

This is not surprising, since

Schumacher also admitted that she never complained of any type of discrimination or harassment
during her employment. That is, she never engaged in protected conduct.

The above-referenced analysis applies to Schumacher's claim of retaliation in violation
of the FMLA as well. See Gonzalez v. Ci& of Minneapolis, 267 F.Supp.2d 1004, 1011 (D.Minn.
2003) (Establishing a prima facie case of retaliation under FMLA and Title VII involves the

same three-pronged analysis used for Title VII claims.) Schumacher has failed to specify what
activity protected by the FMLA she engaged in which forms the predicate for her retaliation
claim. Furthermore, ''where the employee takes leave, or requests to take leave, that [she] is not
eligible for, . . . the employee cannot be deemed to have engaged in protected activity and,
therefore, termination by the employer in such circumstance cannot be grounds to support a

retaliation claim under the FMLA." Pashoian v. GTE Directories, 208 F.Supp.2d 1293, 1303

(M.D. Fla. 2002).

Schumacher's Inability to Show A Causal Connection
Even assuming that Schumacher codd establish the first prong of the prima facie test,

she cannot set forth any causal connection between the alleged "protected conduct" and her

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 26 of 32 PageID #: 140

termination. To establish a causal connection between participation in a protected activity and
an adverse employment action, a plaintiff must show "hat the decision-makers were aware of

the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly
unrelated."

Id. at 1305. (Quotations omitted).

Since Schumacher cannot show that she engaged

in any allegedly protected activity, it is impossible for her to show that the alleged adverse action
and such conduct were not "wholly unrelated." Accordingly, her retaliation claims should be
dismissed.

THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS SCEWMACEER'S BREACH OF CONTRACT
CLAM BECAUSE SHE WAS A N EMPLOYEE AT WILL
In Count VIII of her Complaint, Schumacher aIleges that Fairfield breached the "express
and implied terms and conditions of the understanding and agreement between the defendant's
[sic] and the plaintiff as employer and employee." Plaintiff is unable to identify these "express

and implied terns" because none exist.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff and Fairfield were not parties to an any employment

agreement that guaranteed plaintiff continued employment. Plaintiff and Fairfield were parties to
an agreement known as a Salesperson Agreement. However, that agreement had nothing to do

with the continuation or termination of Plaintiffs employment. Rather, the Agreement governed
the commissions Plaintiff would receive as a salesperson. The Salesperson Agreement

specifically confirmed Plaintiffs status as an at-will employee. Moreover, there is no evidence
adduced by Schumacher that Fairfield breached any terms of that Agreement.
In her deposition, Schumacher admitted that no Fairfield employee ever promised her a
job for particular period of time:
Q.

So did anyone ever tell you that you would have a management job or any job, for
that matter, for a particular period of time ...

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 27 of 32 PageID #: 141

A.

No.

(Statement 5[ 54.)

When questioned about what facts she relied on in support of her breach of contract claim,
Schumacher replied:
A.

They breached the contract by not allowing me my rights.

Q.

What rights?

A.

Any rights that I'm entitled to.

Q.

Is there some right in particular that you believe entitled you to continuing
employment?

A.

No.

(Statement fi 55.)

To the extent Schumacher relies on Fairfield's employee handbook to support her implied
contract argument, the Rhode Island Supreme Court very recently reaffirmed its stance on this
issue and held that "employee handbook[s] do not create a contract under Rhode Island law."

Neri v. Ross-Simons, Inc., 897 A.2d 42, 47 (RI. 2006) (affirming summacy judgment where a

plaintiff-employee sought "to circumvent the 'at will' rule by arguing that the employee

handbook" entitled her to certain protections-from dismissal).
In short, Schumacher cannot establish that there has been any breach of contract
concerning her employment. Schumacher has introduced no evidence to support an argument
that she was anything but an employee at-will who was properly subject to termination when she

failed to properly supply requested information to support a medical leave of absence.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM Document 24 Filed 07/17/06 Page 28 of 32 PageID #: 142

THE COURT SHOULD DIMISS SCHUMACHER'S ESTOPPEL CLAIM
In Count IX, Plaintiff claims that Fairfield "should be estopped to deny their promises

and commitments to follow the policies and procedures set fourth (sic) in their personnel manual
governing the application of equal treatment to its employees, which the plaintiff relied upon to
her detriment." The claim appears derivative of Schumacher's breach of contract claim in the
sense that it is based on allegedly binding promises made in Fairfield's Policy and Procedure

Manual. If that is the case, the claim fails for the same reasons discussed above.
Furthermore, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has spoken on this issue holding that
because employees "who are hired for an indefinite period with no contractual right to continued
employment are [considered] at-will employees [who are] subject to discharge at any time for
any permissible reason or for no reason at all," reliance on any alleged promise regarding
employment is neither reasonable nor actionable. Galloway v. Roner Williams University, 777

A.2d 148, 150 (R.I. 2001). Accordingly, Schumacher cannot sustain a claim for estoppel or

detrimental reliance based on statements made in FaeId's

employee handbook.

TEtE COURT SHOULD DISMISS SCHUMACHER'S PUBLIC POLICY CLAIM
BECAUSE THAT CAUSE OF ACTION IS NOT COGNIZABLE UNDER M O D E
ISLAND LAW
In addition to claiming that her violation was because of her age, her sex, in violation of

the FMLA, in retaliation for unidentified protected activity, and in breach of a nonexistent
contract, Schumacher also cIaims in Count VII that her termination was in violation of the public
policy of the State of Rhode ~sland.'~
Rhode Island is, with one limited (and debatable)

The precise nature of Plaintiffs public policy claim is unclear. In her original Complaint, Plaintiff alleged in
Count VII that the termination of her "employment on account of her work related injury was a violation of the
public policy of the state of Rhode Island." (Cornplaint, 1[ 3.8.) In the Amended Complaint, Count VIl was
transformed to allege that the termination of Plaintiffs employment "was retaliatory and a violation of public policy

see also DelSignore v. Providence Journal Co., 691 A.2d 1050, 1051 n.5 (R.I. 1997) ("In Rhode

Universitv, 824 F.Supp. 18, 23 (D.Mass. 1993) (discussing Rhode Island employment law and

the holding in Cumt.llins). The &ode Island Supreme Court, however, has since clarified the
law on this issue, stating, "we now unequivocally state that in Rhode Island there is no cause of
action for wrongful discharge." Pacheco v. Ravtheon Co., 623 A.2d 464, 465 (R.I. 1993); see

also Andrade v. Jarnestown Housing Authoritv, 82 F.3d 1 179, 1188 (I st Cir. 1996) (noting the

violation or a retaliation cIaim is ultimately irrelevant because Rhode Island does not recognize any wrongful
discharge claims grounded solely in public policy.

Plaintiff captioned her Complaint and Amended Complaint as including claims against
three unidentified defendants referred to as "A, ByC: Unknown." Plaintiff did not make any
specific allegations against these unidentified defendants so it is not clear why they were
included in the caption. Regardless, "(w)here a complaint asserting claims against 'John Doe'
defendants has not been amended to substitute defendants who are real parties in interest as soon

as the identity is known or reasonably should have been known or, in any event, before the close
of discovery, such an assertion is mere surplusage and will be disregarded by the court."
Rodri~uezv. Citv of Passaic, 730 F.Supp. 1314, n.7 (D.N.J. 1990). Accordingly, to the extent

Schumacher is attempting to bring claims against these unidentified defendants, those claims
should be dismissed.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE
Rule 56(c) c ~the
f Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part that:
[qudgrnent shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the zdlidavits, if any, show
that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Thus, as the Supreme Court stated in Celotex Corn. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,322 (1986):

[Tlhe plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment,
after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to
make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that
party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden o f proof at trial.

"The mere existence of a factual dispute is not enough to defeat summary judgment

. . . .The

party opposing summary judgment must demonstrate that there are bona fide factual issues

which 'need to be resolved before the related legal issues can be decided."' Gosselin v.

McGillen, 847 F. Supp 248, 252 (D.R.1. 1993) (citing Mack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871
F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir. 1 989)).13
As shown above, there are no genuine issues with respect to any material facts on

all of Schumacher's claims. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate and Schurnacher's

claims should be dismissed in their entirety with prejudice.
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, Fairfield Resorts, Inc., requests that the Court grant its
motion of summary judgment, dismissing the Complaint and Amended Complaint in its entirety

with prejudice.

l3 A factual issue is "material"only if it might affect the outcome of the case under governing law. Anderson v.
Libem Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). Further, an issue can be "genuine" only if there is a sufficient
evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find for the party opposing the motion. Id. at 249. Thus, in order
to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party must offer objective facts to support her

claims beyond the mere aIlegations in the complaint. Kellv v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 357 (1st Cir. 1991)
("[plroof based on arrant speculation, optimistic sunnise or farfetched inference will not suffice"to defeat summary
judgment).
