MANDAMUS WITH DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, AND AN

INJUNCTION AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS

The Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court take the following immediate actions:

1. That the Court defers its decision to grant/deny the Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue and
grants the Plaintiff a ninety (90) day delay from the date of this filing in the obligatory filings by all
parties of all pleadings, motions, memoranda, and responses (i.e., suspend the proceeding) until the
conditions, as stated below, for terminating the 90-day delay herein requested have been met.

2. Plaintiff requests that this Court order an immediate Writ of Peremptory Mandamus and a
Demand for Specific Performance as stated in the Complaint against the Department of Justice (DOJ)
and that this Court demand an immediate investigation by the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Attorney for Maryland into Plaintiffs allegations of

3. Plaintiff requests that this Court order an immediate Injunction against CIA, NSA, and those
acting on their behalf to cause the cessation of the illegal acts and rights violations alleged by the
Plaintiff in the Complaint.

4, Plaintiff is seeking immediate assistance from this Court in reestablishing Plaintiff's
unencumbered right to counsel. Efforts to deny legal advocacy to the Plaintiff as stated clearly and
emphatically in the Complaint, are effective and continuing in nature and appear as attempts on the part
of Defendants CIA and NSA to insure that the Plaintiff can neither advance nor prevail in this
proceeding.

5. Terminate the requested delay/suspension and recommence this proceeding when the Office of
the U.S. Attorney General, the DOJ/FBI, the U.S. Attorney for Maryland, the Plaintiff (and his counsel),
and this Honorable Court have satisfactorily confirmed the safety and well being of the Plaintiff and his
family and that our rights are not encumbered by the actions of the Defendants.

6. The Plaintiff requests an immediate answer from this Honorable Court to the questions of
jurisdiction and authority of the Court in the adjudication of the Plaintiff's allegations as stated in the
Complaint. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests an immediate answer from this Court to the following
three questions:

a) Does this Court have the jurisdiction and authority to demand an immediate investigation
by the DOJ and other appropriate federal authorities into the Plaintiff's allegations of
criminal acts, harassment, and rights violations by CIA and NSA against the Plaintiff and
his family?

b) Does this Court have the jurisdiction and authority to order an effective injunction against
CIA, NSA, and those acting on their behalf to cause the actions alleged in the Complaint
to cease?

c) Can CIA and NSA be operating under a classified executive order or other authority that in

effect "trumps" the jurisdiction and authority of this Court in this proceeding?

ARGUMENT
The illegal acts and rights violations perpetrated against the Plaintiff and his family by the CIA, the
NSA, and those acting on their behalf are comprehensive, effective, and ongoing in nature. With these
circumstances as a backdrop, this civil action was commenced as a result of the failure of the safe
harbors within the DOJ/FBI to respond to the call for intervention and protection by the Plaintiff and his
family. The allegations are grave and would normally be expected to provoke an immediate substantive
response from the DOJ/FBI, especially in light of the Plaintiff's education, professional background,
former TOP SECRET clearance, and previous contact with CIA, NSA, and classified contractors
including ITT Industries and Northrop Grumman Corp. Oddly, the DOJ/FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office,
and other U.S government offices of refuge to the U.S. citizen have been told in effect to "stand down"
and to ignore the demands by the plaintiff and his family for intervention and protection. The actions of
the CIA, the NSA, and others alleged by the Plaintiff in this proceeding have not abated since the time
this suit was filed. Prior to and throughout this proceeding the Plaintiff has been effectively blocked
from attaining viable legal counsel. Based upon the experiences of multiple visits to several regional
courthouses the Plaintiff finds reason to believe that the physical property, resources, processes, records,
and personnel of the federal District courthouses in the District of Columbia and in Greenbelt Maryland
are being improperly influenced by Defendants CIA and NSA and others acting on their behalf for
reasons related to allegations in this suit. (Likewise, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundle County in
Annapolis and the District and Circuit Courts for Prince Georges County in Upper Marlboro are
believed by the Plaintiff to be similarly influenced.) Accordingly, the Plaintiff is finding it difficult if
not impossible to advance his interests in this proceeding from a pro se posture. The Plaintiff therefore
presses this Court for immediate relief through the requested Writ of Peremptory Mandamus, Demand
for Specific Performance, and Injunction against the Defendants. The Plaintiff requests confirmation
from this Court that this Court does indeed have the proper jurisdiction and authority over the

Defendants in this matter adequate to administer justice for the Plaintiff.

CONCLUSION
The Plaintiff has requested an immediate Writ of Peremptory Mandamus, an immediate Demand for
Specific Performance, and an immediate Injunction against the Defendants. The Plaintiff also requested
that this Court affirm that it does indeed have adequate jurisdiction and authority over Defendants DOJ,
CIA, and NSA to administer justice for the Plaintiff in this proceeding. The actions requested herein of
this Court by the Plaintiff do not prejudice the Defendants in any regard. The actions requested are
believed to be reasonable, justified, within the discretionary power of the Court to grant, and essential to

obtain justice for the Plaintiff in this proceeding.
