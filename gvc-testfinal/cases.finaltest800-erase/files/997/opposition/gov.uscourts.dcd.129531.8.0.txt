DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO, AND MOTION TO STAY,
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR AN IMMEDIATE COURT ORDER FOR
A WRIT OF PEREMPTORY MANDAMUS WITH DEMAND FOR
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS
Defendants oppose and move to stay Plaintiff’s Motion for an Immediate Court Order for
a Writ of Peremptory Mandamus with Demand for Specific Performance, and an Injunction
Against the Defendants. In this case Plaintiff seeks an immediate injunction against the National
Security Agency (“NSA”), Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”), and any other U.S. government
agencies and any other parties acting on their behalf, as well as a Writ of Peremptory Mandamus
and a demand for Specific Performance against the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). See R.
11, ¶ 2. Plaintiff argues that there are ongoing violations of his Fourth Amendment Rights and
other illegal actions perpetrated against him and his family by persons associated with
Defendants NSA and CIA, as well as others believed to be acting on their behalf, including
employees of two of Plaintiff’s previous employers. See id., ¶ 1. Although Plaintiff initiated
this action in this Court, Defendants have made it clear that venue is more appropriate in the
District of Maryland. See R. 3. Nevertheless, Plaintiff now reasserts similar demands in his

instant Motion to those in the Complaint, and asks additional direct questions of the Court
regarding jurisdiction. See R. 7; cf. R. 1.
In the interest of judicial economy, the Court should stay Plaintiff’s instant Motion and
decide Defendants’ Motion to Transfer, which is pending before the Court. As Defendants have
argued, the more appropriate venue for this case is the District of Maryland. See R. 3. Plaintiff’s
instant Motion resembles his Complaint significantly, in the substance of its claims and the relief
sought, and should therefore be adjudicated by the Court in the venue that is most appropriate to
decide the entire case.2 See R. 7; cf. R. 1. Even Plaintiff’s allegation that he has been
“effectively blocked” from obtaining legal counsel is not new to the instant motion. See R. 7 at
3; cf. R. 1, ¶ 7. In his response to Defendants’ venue transfer motion, Plaintiff requested
additional time to secure legal counsel before filing a substantive opposition. See R. 5, ¶ 3(b).
Defendants have not opposed the request, and understand that such a request may be deemed
conceded by the Court. However, Plaintiff’s filing of an additional motion that is substantively
similar to that of the Complaint should not entitle Plaintiff to relief on the merits before the
question of proper venue is decided by the Court.
In observance of Local Civil Rule 7(m), Defendants recognize that their instant motion
contradicts directly that of Plaintiff’s most recent motion, and therefore Defendants did not
contact Plaintiff to request his position on this motion.

2

One significant difference from the Complaint is that Plaintiff, in the instant Motion, asks the Court to
respond to questions regarding its own jurisdiction. See R. 7, ¶ 6(a)-(c). This type of relief is not
contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as it is the parties’ own responsibility to argue the
jurisdiction of the Court to order the requested relief.
