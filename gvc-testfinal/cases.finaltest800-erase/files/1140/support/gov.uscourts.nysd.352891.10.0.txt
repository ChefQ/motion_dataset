DEFENDANT INTERSCOPE GEFFEN A&M RECORDS'
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendant Interscope Geffen A&M Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.

 

("Interscope") submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss the
Complaint' of plaintiffs Domino Recording Company, Inc. and Independiente, Ltd. (collectively,

"Plaintiffs") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) and 12(b)(6).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to comply with the most basic pleading standards under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a). Indeed, the Complaint is completely devoid of
fundamental factual allegations and fails to allege the necessary elements of a copyright
infringement claim. Plaintiffs simply claim to be the owners of the exclusive rights to
manufacture, distribute, license and otherwise commercially exploit two sound recordings
entitled "Wherever You Are" and "A Strangely Isolated Place" (collectively, the "Plaintiffs'
Sound Recordings") and allege, in the most conclusory fashion, that Interscope and others have
infringed Plaintiffs' copyright in the Sound Recordings by exploiting the sound recording
entitled "Riad `N the Bedouins," which is contained on the album entitled "Chinese Democracy"
(the "Album"').

These bare allegations do not suffice to allege the essential elements of their copyright
infringement claim. For example, Plaintiffs do not allege a factual foundation for their claim of
ownership of the Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings. Further, they fail to allege that Defendants had
"access" to Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings. Additionally, Plaintiffs do not allege that "Riad `N the
Bedouins" is "substantially similar" to Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings. In light of these glaring

deficiencies, Plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim must fail and the Court should dismiss all

 

' A true and correct copy of the Complaint is annexed as Exhibit A ("Ex. A") to the accompanying
affirmation of Andrew H. Bart dated January 29, 2010.
of Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Rules 8(a)(2) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil

 

Procedure.
STATEMENT OF FACTS?

The Complaint alleges that Ulrich Schnaus, a musical performer and artist, "authored"
Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings. Compl. at { 18. However, Plaintiffs shed no light on the nature of
Schnaus's authorship and his original rights in Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings. Plaintiffs next
allege that, by virtue of certain unspecified written agreements among unspecified parties
(notably, Schnaus is unnamed), they are the owners of the exclusive rights to manufacture,
distribute, license and otherwise commercially exploit Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings, and that
they were issued Copyright Registrations for the Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings with effective
dates of May 11, 2009. Compl. at {0x00A7j 19-20.

With regard to the alleged infringing activity, Plaintiffs merely allege that, on November
23, 2008, Defendants placed the Album "into the marketplace" and that the Album "embodies
unauthorized copies, and/or derivative works based upon, the Sound Recordings, as embodied in
Track 9 of the Album entitled `Riad `N the Bedouins."" Compl. at {{ 23-24. Further, Plaintiffs
contend that: (i)the Album and "Riad `N the Bedouins" were produced, manufactured,
reproduced, distributed, sold and/or released by Defendants on the Geffen record label; (11) each
Defendant participated in and contributed to the creation, production, manufacture and/or
distribution of the Album and "Riad `N the Bedouins;" and (iii) each Defendant financially
benefited from the creation, production, manufacture and/or distribution of the Album and "Riad

`N the Bedouins." Compl. at 0x00A7{ 25, 27-28.

 

2 The Statement of Facts is premised upon the allegations in the Complaint and, solely for the
purposes of this Motion, the allegations in the Complaint are presumed to be true.
ARGUMENT

 

I. | STANDARD OF REVIEW OF A MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER FED. R. CIV. P.
12(B)(6)

In accordance with Rule 8(a)(2), a copyright infringement claim must allege (1) the
specific original works that are the subject of the copyright claim; (2) that plaintiff owns the
copyrights in those works; (3) that the copyrights at issue have been registered in accordance
with the Copyright Act; and (4) the specific acts by which the defendant allegedly infringed the
copyright. Kelly v. L.L. Cool J., 145 F.R.D. 32, 36 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). Broad, sweeping
allegations of infringement do not comply with Rule 8." Jd. at 36 n.3 (citation omitted); Marvullo
vy. Gruner & Jahr, 105 F. Supp.2d 225, 230 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), Reid v. American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21510, 1994 WL 3409, at **1-2
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 1994) (Kram, J.) (dismissing claim pursuant to Rule 8(a)(2) where plaintiff
failed to allege by what acts defendant infringed copyright).

With this existing jurisprudence on the pleading of copyright infringement claims already
in place, in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), the Supreme Court expounded on the
overall pleading requirements of Rule 8:

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a "short

and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." As

the Court held in [Bell Atlantic Corp. v.| Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, [555,] 127 S.

Ct. 1955 [(2007)] .. . , the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require

"detailed factual allegations," but it demands more than an unadorned, the-

defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. A pleading that offers "labels and

conclusions" or "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will

not do." Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders "naked assertion[s]" devoid of

"further factual enhancement."

Id, at 1949 (internal citations omitted); see also Poon v. Roomorama, LLC, 2009 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 104829 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2009); Roberts v. Keith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
101412 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2009). Indeed, a complaint based on such allegations permits no

 

dismiss. See, e.g., Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950.

Although a Court must assume that the factual allegations of a complaint are true when
considering a motion to dismiss, a Court is "not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion
couched as a factual allegation." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Walker, 2009 WL 2343614, at *5. Bare assertions amounting to no more than a
"formulaic recitation of the elements" of a claim are conclusory, and are not entitled to the
presumption of truth. Jgbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555); see also
Roberts v. Keith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101412 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2009).

Thus, "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to `state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.
at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570); see also Roberts v. Keith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
101412 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2009). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable
for the misconduct alleged." Jgbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (emphasis added); see also Roberts v.
Keith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101412 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2009) (dismissing claim on 12(b)(6)
motion where the compliant lacked factual content and therefore did not cross the line from
"conceivable to plausible"); Energy Intelligence Group v. UBS Fin. Servs., 2009 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 48495 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2009).

A claim that fails to satisfy the above bedrock pleading requirements should be dismissed
ona Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Such a complaint "does not unlock the doors of discovery for a

plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950. Indeed, "[i]t is
no answer to say that a claim just shy of plausible entitlement to relief can, if groundless, be

 

weeded out early in the discovery process ... [aJnd it is self evident that the problem of
discovery abuse cannot be solved by careful scrutiny of evidence at the summary judgment
stage, much less lucid instructions to juries." Twombly, 550 US. at 559 (internal citations and
quotations omitted).

II. PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

Plaintiffs have failed to plead a cognizable claim for copyright infringement under the
foregoing strict standards. Indeed, Plaintiffs fail even to allege the basic, requisite elements of
such a claim (although that alone would be insufficient), and instead allege only the bare-bones
legal conclusion that the Album "embodies unauthorized copies and/or derivative works based
upon, the [Plaintiffs'] Sound Recordings, as embodied in [`Riad *N the Bedouins']."" Compl. at
4 24.

To state a prima facie case for copyright infringement, Plaintiffs must allege (1) that they
own a valid copyright and (2) that the Defendants copied protected elements of that copyrighted
work. Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991); Tufenkian
Import/Export Ventures, Inc v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., 338 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting
Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 1998); Shine v.
Childs, 04 Civ 8828, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2005); Rogers v. Koons,
960 F.2d 301, 306 (2d Cir. 1992); Laureyssens y. Idea Group, Inc., 964 F.2d 131, 139 (2d Cir.
1992); see also MH. Segan Ltd. Partnership v. Hasbro, Inc., 924 F. Supp. 512, 518 (S.D.N-Y.
1996). Plaintiffs have not even adequately alleged these two most basic things.

As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege ownership of the Plaintiffs'

Sound Recordings. Plaintiffs merely allege that Schnaus is the "author" of Plaintiffs' Sound
Recordings. However, it is unclear what Plaintiffs mean by stating that Schnaus "authored"

 

ee,

Plaintiffs" Sound Recordings. Further, Plaintiffs fail to allege to whom Schnaus; as the "author*--_--

of Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings, transferred his rights nor do they allege from whom Plaintiffs
allegedly obtained the rights to Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings.

Further, in order to establish the second element of a copyright infringement claim, a
plaintiff must show (1) actual copying, and (2) unlawful appropriation. Laureyssens v. Idea
Group, Inc., 964 F.2d at 139-40; Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Group, Inc., 150 F.3d
132, 137 (2d Cir. 1998); Arden v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 908 F. Supp. 1248, 1257 (S.D.N.Y.
1995); Denker v. Uhry, 820 F. Supp. 722, 728 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 996 F.2d 301 (2d Cir.
1993). A plaintiff alleging copyright infringement can establish actual copying by offering
factual allegations showing direct evidence of copying. Jd. Without direct evidence of copying,
a plaintiff may establish copying circumstantially by demonstrating that the person who
composed the defendant's work had access to the copyrighted material, and that there are
similarities between the two works that are probative of copying. Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony
Records, 351 F.3d 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted); Arden vy. Columbia Pictures, Indus.,
908 F. Supp. at 1257; see also Tienshan, Inc. vy. C.C.A. Int'l (N.J.), Inc., 895 F. Supp. 651, 656
(S.D.N.Y. 1995). Similarities between the works are "probative" if, "under all the circumstances,
[they] make independent creation unlikely." Laureyssens v. Idea Group, Inc., 964 F.2d 131, 140
(2d Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).

First, Plaintiffs provide no factual allegations to establish a claim of direct copying of
protected elements of their alleged copyrighted work. In fact, they do not bother to allege what
specific aspects of Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings were allegedly "copied" (e.g., a drum beat, a

guitar riff, or other musical accompaniment). Instead, they merely allege, in a wholly conclusory
fashion, that the Album simply embodies "unauthorized copies and/or derivative works based
upon" Plaintiffs" Sound Recordings as embodied in "Riad "N the Bedouins." Compl: at 424:

Second, the Complaint contains no facts establishing even circumstantially that any of the
creators of "Riad `N the Bedouins" heard, or otherwise had access to, Plaintiffs' Sound
Recordings before creating "Riad `N the Bedouins." A copyright plaintiff must demonstrate
access to the allegedly infringed work by the creators of the allegedly infringing work.
Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, 351 F.3d 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted)

Indeed, in Adams v. Warner Bros. Pictures Network, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47448
(E.D.N.Y. June 27, 2007, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) where, inter alia, the complaint contained no allegations that defendant
had access to Plaintiff's work.

Here, Plaintiffs do not allege or plead any facts to show that Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings
were submitted to or played for any of the creators of "Riad "N the Bedouins" or to Interscope or
any of Defendants or anyone affiliated with Interscope or Defendants. Nor does the Complaint
provide any other factual basis to demonstrate how any of the creators of "Riad `N the Bedouins"
would have had "access" to Plaintiffs' work. Further, Plaintiffs never allege that Plaintiffs'
Sound Recordings were ever publicly available. Accordingly, since the Complaint does not set
forth any factual allegations on an essential element of a copyright infringement claim ~ access -
Count I (the sole count) of the Complaint should be dismissed.

Third, the Complaint fails to allege specific and protectable aspects of Plaintiffs' Sound
Recordings that are purportedly substantially similar to "Riad `N the Bedouins." Rather, the
pleading contains only the most conclusory statements that "Riad `N the Bedouins" somehow

"embodies unauthorized copies, and/or derivative works based upon, the Sound Recordings."
Compl. at 0x00A724. Thus, the Complaint fails to provide the Defendants with any idea - let alone the

 

requisite "fair notice" - of how Plaintiffs' Sound Recordings and "Riad `N the Bedoumns* might -
be related. See, e.g., Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47

(1957) (explaining that a complaint must provide a defendant with "fair notice of what the

_..claim is and the grounds upon which it rests"); see also Martinez v. McGraw, 2009 WL

2447611, at *6 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 10, 2009) (dismissing claim on 12(b)(6) motion where

complaint failed to plead facts demonstrating substantial similarity; right to relief did not rise

above speculative level).

Simply put, Plaintiffs' Complaint impermissibly alleges no "more than labels and
conclusions." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Indeed, the Complaint relies solely on the type of
"unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed me" accusations that the Supreme Court's recent
decisions in Jgbal and Twombly decisively establish are plainly disallowed. Iqbal, 129 8S. Ct. at

1949; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Accordingly, the Complaint should be dismissed.

Based on the foregoing and pursuant to Fed. R- Civ. P- 12(b)(6), defendant Interscope -
Geffen A&M Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc., respectfully requests that this Court
