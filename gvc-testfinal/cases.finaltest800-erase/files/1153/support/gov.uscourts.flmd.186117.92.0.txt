determines that they are not entitled to confidential treatment under the terms of the Protective
Order. The documents filed herewith are the materials referred to in Spain's Motion to Declare
Certain Materials as Not Confidential dated February 1, 2008 and consist of:

Group A: "Artifact Summary" Lists and Photographs

1. "Artifact Summary" for Case No. 8:07-CV-0614 vessel
2. "Artifact Summary" for Case No. 8:06-CV-1685 vessel
3. `Artifact Summary" for Case No. 8:07-CV-0616 vessel (photographs)

Spain contends that these documents consist simply of photographs and descriptions of
selected artifacts retrieved by Odyssey and do not constitute confidential information under
Paragraphs 2 and 6 of the Protective Order.' When counsel conferred on February 25, 2008,
counsel for Odyssey notified counsel for Spain that Odyssey does not consider the list of artifacts
in Case No. 8:07-C V-0616 as confidential, but that it considers the photographs on the "Artifact
Summary" corresponding to that case as confidential. Hence, only the confidentiality status of
the photographs in the "Artifact Summary" for Case No. 8:07-CV-0616 remains at issue.
Odyssey has advised that it considers the lists of artifacts (with or without pictures) in Cases No.
8:07-CV-0614 and No. 8:06-CV-1685 as confidential.

Group B: Two site plans of the Case No. 8:06-CV-1685 vessel (original size)

Spain contends that these charts depict vessel remains and artifacts which are in plain
view on the seabed and do not constitute confidential information under Paragraphs 2 and 6 of

the Protective Order.

 

' As noted in its February 1, 2008 Motion to Compel Compliance with this Court's Disclosure
Order and for Other Relief, Claimant Spain further believes that the Case No. 8:07-CV-00614

"Artifact Summary" is incomplete and does not comply with the Court's January 10 Order for

disclosure of artifact lists and descriptions.
Group C: Photographs of artifacts on the seabed from the Case No. 8:07-CV-00614
site (reduced size)

Spain contends that these photographs of artifacts on the seabed do not constitute
confidential information under Paragraphs 2 and 6 of the Protective Order. Counsel for Spain
has examined additional photographs of artifacts on the seabed which correspond to Case No.
8:07-CV-0614, but has not as yet received copies, pending discussions between counsel
regarding the format and cost of the copies. Counsel for Spain has been advised that Odyssey
considers all such photographs to be confidential under the Protective Order. The photographs
filed as Group C are therefore provided as an exemplar of all such photographs.

Group D: Photomosaics"

4, Photomosaic of Case No. 8:07-CV-0614 site
5. Photomosaic of Case No. 8:06-CV-1685 site
6. Photomosaic of Case No. 8:07-CV-0616 site

Spain contends that the photomosaics provided by Odyssey do not constitute confidential
material under Paragraphs 2 and 6 of the Protective Order because they consist of photographs of
the seabed of a kind that Odyssey has published on its website and elsewhere. See Odyssey,
Western Mediterranean (n.d.), http://shipwreck.net/westmedpictures.shtm!. To the extent that
these pictures might reveal any process or method utilized by Odyssey, they have already been
revealed publicly by Odyssey's posting of similar photomosaics on its website.

Group E: "Preliminary Site Assessment" Reports (original size)

 

2 In order to facilitate filing, the enclosed copies of the photomosaics have been reduced in size
from the originals provided to Spain's counsel by Odyssey. With respect to Case No.: 8-07-CV-
00614, Odyssey has provided an overall photomosaic of the site, as well as blow-ups of the
photomosaic divided into sections. Spain's counsel will bring to the attention of the Court the
original full-size photomosaics provided by Odyssey on March 5, 2008.
