No. 06-305 T
Judge Marian Blank Horn

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR ISSUANCE
OF LETTERS OF REQUEST
Plaintiff, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (“Con Edison NY”), hereby
objects to Defendant’s Motion for Issuance of Letters of Request.
The three Letters of Request seek extensive amounts of information from the multiple
foreign parties named in the Letters of Request. These burdensome Requests, if granted, are
likely to result in a long delay in the trial of this case.
In the Joint Status Report filed with the Court on January 8, 2007, the United States
expressed its intent to “file a motion in the coming week” [sic] “requesting that the Court issue
Letters of Request to the Netherlands, Germany, and England.” The United States did not file
this Motion until April 6, 2007, nearly three months after it indicated its intent to file such a
Motion.
The trial in this case is currently scheduled to begin October 17, 2007. Fact discovery is
scheduled to close on June 22, 2007. This schedule is incompatible with the requested Motion
for Issuance of Letters of Request.

of Request be denied.
Executed on: April 27, 2007
