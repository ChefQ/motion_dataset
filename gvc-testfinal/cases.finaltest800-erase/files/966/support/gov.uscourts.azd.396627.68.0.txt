States Supreme Court decision relevant to defendants’ pending motion to dismiss the
Amended Complaint.
On March 30, 2010, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Jones
v. Harris, 559 U.S. ___ (Mar. 30, 2010). [A copy of the decision is enclosed.] The
Jones decision addressed the legal standard to be used in evaluating whether an
investment adviser (and its affiliated entities) have violated Section 36(b) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Jones addressed, inter alia, Gartenberg v. Merrill
Lynch Asset Mgmt., Inc., 694 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 906
(1983).
Leave is appropriate and warranted because this action alleges legal claims under
Section 36(b) and the parties herein have extensively addressed the Gartenberg decision
in their prior briefs on defendants’ pending dismissal motion.
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the parties be directed to submit supplemental
briefs specifically on the Jones v. Harris decision pursuant to the following briefing
schedule.
Plaintiff and defendants shall exchange and file opening briefs on Tuesday, April
27, 2010.
Plaintiff and defendants shall exchange and file reply briefs on Tuesday, May 4,
2010.
A proposed form of Order has been supplied with this Motion.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 6th day of April, 2010.
