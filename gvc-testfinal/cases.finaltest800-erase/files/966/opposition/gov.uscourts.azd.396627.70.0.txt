The Supreme Court in Jones v. Harris Associates L.P., --- U.S. ---, 2010 WL

2

1189560 (Mar. 30, 2010), endorsed the basic approach to section 36(b) articulated in

3

Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1982). As

4

plaintiff correctly states, the parties extensively addressed the Gartenberg formulation in

5

their briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss.

6

Defendants have no objection to an order providing for such additional briefing

7

relating to Jones v. Harris as the Court may find useful.

8

Respectfully Submitted on April 23, 2010.
