UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

ERWIN GRAMPP, derivatively on behalf of
JBI, INC.,
Plaintiff,
Civil Action No.: 1:12-cv-10495-MLW
vs.
JOHN BORDYNUIK, DR. JACOB SMITH,
RONALD C. BALDWIN, JR., AMY
BRADSHAW, JOHN M. WESSON, ROBIN
BAGAI, GREGORY GOLDBERG, and
THEODORE J. HENRY,

Motion to Dismiss
(Leave Granted 7/12/2012)

Defendants,
and
JBI, INC.
Nominal Defendant.

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
PLAINTIFF’S VERIFIED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), 12(b)(6), and 23.1, Defendants
John Bordynuik, Dr. Jacob Smith, Ronald C. Baldwin, Jr., Amy Bradshaw, John M. Wesson,
Robin Bagai, Gregory Goldberg, and Theodore J. Henry (collectively, the “Individual
Defendants”) respectfully move the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s Verified Shareholder Derivative
Complaint. As grounds therefore, the Individual Defendants state that the complaint is deficient
for several reasons. First, the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over all of the Individual
Defendants, with the exception of John Bordynuik. Second, Plaintiff failed to make pre-suit
demand on the board of directors of nominal defendant JBI, Inc. (“JBI” or “the Company”), or
state with particularity the reasons why such demand would have been futile, as required by Fed.

R. Civ. P. 23.1 and substantive Nevada law. Third, an exculpatory statute and clause in JBI’s
Articles of Incorporation, as well as Plaintiff’s failure to plead a cognizable injury to the
Company, preclude liability by the company’s officers and directors and require dismissal of
Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claims. Fourth, Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficiently
particularized to satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Fifth, in the alternative, the
Individual Defendants state that this action should be stayed because it conflicts with a class
action securities case pending in Nevada and a Securities and Exchange Commission action
pending in Massachusetts.
WHEREFORE, the Individual Defendants respectfully move the Court to dismiss
Plaintiff’s Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint, with prejudice, or in the alternative, stay
this action pending resolution of the SEC and class actions.
REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT
Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(D), the Individual Defendants respectfully request oral
argument on this motion.
Respectfully submitted,
