DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PARTIAL CONSENT MOTION TO AMEND
SCHEDULING ORDER

NOW COMES Defendant, through counsel, and hereby responds to Plaintiff’s Partial
Consent Motion to Amend Scheduling Order (ECF No. 26) as follows.
As indicated in Plaintiff’s Partial Consent Motion to Amend Scheduling Order, the parties
agreed on and consented to certain modifications to the scheduling order (as previously amended)
and joined in a request to reschedule the pre-trial conference. Also as indicated in Plaintiff’s
Partial Consent Motion, the Plaintiff requested leave to serve double the amount of requests for
admissions permitted by the Scheduling Order and informed the Court that the Defendants
objected to that portion of her motion.
By order dated December 21, 2018 (ECF No. 27), the Court granted the motion without
the Defendants being afforded the opportunity to file its opposition to so much of Plaintiff’s motion
as they objected to. Because the Court’s order has mooted Defendants’ planned opposition, the
Defendants are not filing the opposition. To do so would represent an unnecessary use of the
Defendants’ resources and would not serve any beneficial purpose. The Defendants are filing this

response to make a record of the fact that they were not afforded the opportunity to object to
Plaintiff’s motion and to avoid any deemed waiver of the right to object to the motion and the
relief sought by Plaintiff.
