Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-512

I/P ENGINE, INC.’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE
PLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO SHOW CAUSE
Plaintiff I/P Engine, Inc. (“I/P Engine”), by counsel, for its Response to Defendants’
Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Reply in Support of Motion to Show Cause, states as follows.
I/P Engine filed its Motion to Shorten Defendants’ Time to Respond to its Motion to
Show Cause in an effort to obtain a prompt resolution of Defendants’ failure to comply with this
Court’s order to produce documents. In so moving, I/P Engine offered to waive a written reply
and requested a prompt hearing. I/P Engine’s offer was proposed to hasten a hearing date on the
Motion to Show Cause and to permit I/P Engine to reply to Defendants’ response in open Court.
Because Defendants had failed to produce any additional documents and as the Court had not
scheduled a hearing by the reply brief deadline, I/P Engine had no opportunity to reply in open
Court. Accordingly, it filed its written reply. Defendants have suffered no prejudice by the
filing of the reply, nor have they articulated any.

Since this Court issued its order to the parties to produce all relevant documents, I/P
Engine has spent significant resources urging Defendants to do what this Court ordered them to
do: produce all documents relevant to whether New AdWords is more than a colorable variation
of Old AdWords.
After I/P Engine’s filing of its Motion to Show Cause, Google produced over 9,000 pages
of documents and additional source code relevant to whether New AdWords is more than a
colorable variation of Old AdWords. This fact alone justifies I/P Engine’s efforts to compel
Defendants to do what this Court ordered them to do.
Even more, as of this writing, I/P Engine remains unsure whether Defendants have
produced all relevant documents.

I/P Engine served its expert reports on September 25

potentially without a complete document production. What has been confirmed thus far through
Google’s limited productions is that New AdWords is substantially the same system as Old
AdWords.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff I/P Engine respectfully moves this Court to deny the
Defendants’ Motion to Strike and grant all just and necessary relief.
