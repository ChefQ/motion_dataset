MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
Plaintiffs Center for Food Safety, Organic Seed Alliance, High Mowing Organic Seeds,
and Sierra Club hereby move the Court for leave to file a supplemental declaration of counsel in

4
5

support of plaintiffs’ pending motion for preliminary injunction schedule to be heard on March

6

5, 2010. The sole purpose of the supplemental declaration is to offer documents to which

7

plaintiffs were not given access by intervenor defendants until the day before plaintiffs’ reply

8

brief was due. All of these documents closely and directly relate to an issue that federal

9

defendants and intervenor defendants have made central to their opposition to plaintiffs’ motion

10
11
12
13
14
15
16

for preliminary injunctive relief, namely, the availability of conventional seed to intervenors, and
the efforts intervenors did, and did not, make during the course of this litigation to mitigate the
harms defendants argue they will incur if an injunction issues.
Background
On December 11, 2009, one week after the Case Management Conference before this
Court on December 4, 2009, plaintiffs served all defendants with a request for production of

17
18
19
20
21
22

documents, requesting that documents be produced one month later.
On January 19, 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which has been
scheduled for hearing on March 5, 2010.
On February 19, 2010, plaintiffs timely filed their reply brief in support of their motion
for preliminary injunction.

23
24
25

On February 18, 2010, the day before plaintiffs’ reply brief was due, the Grower and
Processor intervenor defendants American Sugarbeet Growers Association, Ervin Schlemmer,

26

Mark Wettstein, Duane Grant, John Snyder, Jr., United States Beet Sugar Association, American

27

Crystal Sugar Company, The Amalgamated Sugar Company LLC, Western Sugar Cooperative

28

and Wyoming Sugar Company LLC, made their first production of documents to plaintiffs in

1

response to the document request plaintiffs had served more than two months earlier. At the

2

same time, the other intervenor defendants also began making their first productions of

3

documents in response to the request. Because plaintiffs counsel were working to meet the

4
5

deadline for filing plaintiffs’ reply brief, and because all of these documents were produced

6

within a very short time frame just before this deadline, plaintiffs counsel did not have an

7

opportunity to review more than a very few of these documents prior to the deadline for filing

8

plaintiffs’ reply brief. Plaintiffs did describe some of those few in their reply brief; they

9

specifically undermine a central argument intervenor defendants and federal defendants have

10
raised in their oppositions to plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, namely, defendants’
11
12

argument that they do not have access to conventional sugarbeet seed, cannot plant a

13

conventional sugarbeet crop in 2010 or thereafter, and could not have been expected to have

14

produced or otherwise acquired such seed during the two years this lawsuit has been pending.

15
16

In the days following their receipt, plaintiffs reviewed more of the documents produced
on February 18, 2010, and have discovered that a number of others bear closely on this central

17
18

issue, and demonstrate that intervenors have not candidly described what they did, and did not,

19

do to mitigate the potential impacts of injunctive relief, and when and why they did or did not do

20

so. In the mean time, on February 23, 2010, intervenor defendants, without leave of Court and in

21

violation of Civil L.R. 7-3(d), filed a document styled “Intervenor-Defendants’ Objections to

22

Plaintiffs’ Declarations and Exhibits,” responding to plaintiffs’ reply brief and arguing the

23

evidence; Civil L.R. 7-3(d) provides that, other than supplemental authority, “once a reply is

24
25

filed, no additional memoranda, papers or letters may be filed without prior Court approval.”

26

Plaintiffs wish to make some of these documents—all of which were produced on

27

February 18, 2010, and all of which reflect communications among intervenor defendants

28

themselves on this central issue—available to the Court for its consideration in deciding

1

plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion. Plaintiffs believe that before reaching any

2

determination of plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the Court would wish in the

3

interests of justice to have access to these documents, and should have that access. Since all of

4
5

the subject documents were produced by intervenor defendants and reflect statements made by

6

intervenor defendants themselves, intervenor defendants should not be heard to complain that

7

they are unfamiliar with the documents, or have not had an adequate opportunity to consider

8

them; since the documents were not made available to plaintiffs until the day before plaintiffs’

9

final brief was due, intervenors should not be heard to complain that plaintiffs should have

10
reviewed and proffered them sooner. Plaintiffs have made an effort to select from the documents

intervenors produced a small number that most clearly pertain to this one group of arguments
defendants have made in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.
