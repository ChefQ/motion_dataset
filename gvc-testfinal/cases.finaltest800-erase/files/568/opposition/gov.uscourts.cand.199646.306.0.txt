1

Neither plaintiffs’ initial brief, nor their Reply Memorandum in Support of their Motion

2

for a Preliminary Injunction, established any immediate irreparable harm that could justify the

3

preliminary injunctive relief plaintiffs seek. Indeed, plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum focused

4

largely on the balance of harms, attempting to knit together a series of newspaper articles and

5

other unauthenticated hearsay exhibits to give the impression that this nation’s eight sugarbeet

6

processors, and the thousands of family farms that own the processors, actually have sufficient

7

conventional non-Roundup Ready seed for 2010 planting. This is untrue. 1

8

Plaintiffs’ most recent submission contains similar materials attempting to deflect

9

attention from their burden to establish immediate irreparable harm. Again, plaintiffs’ proposed

10

supplemental material is supported only by an attorney affidavit without any sponsoring witness

11

or authentication.

12

processors, and do not call into question the fundamental truth that, without planting Roundup

13

Ready sugarbeet seed in 2010-11, massive harm will occur throughout this industry and with

14

widespread consequences in other economic sectors.

And these hearsay materials relate to only one of the eight sugarbeet

15

Plaintiffs’ selective approach to the identification and presentation of “evidence” for a

16

long-delayed preliminary injunction request that effectively seeks permanent relief would

17

circumvent the process the Court put in place to develop and illuminate the record leading up to

18

a June remedies hearing. Plaintiffs’ request should be denied.

19

plaintiffs’ motion, intervenors ask that the Court also accept the proposed Supplemental

20

Declaration of David Berg, submitted herewith, which places the submitted documents in their

21

proper context.

22

If, however, the Court grants

1. The proposed documents submitted are of marginal relevance and should not be

23

considered without an evidentiary hearing.

24

Plaintiffs submit a select few documents that discuss some of the contingency planning of

25

a single sugarbeet processor, American Crystal. American Crystal is unique among the

26

processors because it has its own seed division. Incomplete hearsay statements relating to this

sugarbeet processor with its own seed division have no bearing on whether the seven other

2

sugarbeet processors, or the industry as a whole, has conventional seed sufficient for 2010

3

sugarbeet root crop planting. Compare Pls.’ Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 5-11 with

4

Exs. 55-69 to Achitoff Decl. (all relating exclusively to American Crystal Sugar Company—and

5

not to the seven other major processors that constitute the largest part of the market). Indeed, the

6

proposed documents do not support plaintiffs’ assertion that American Crystal has the

7

conventional seed it needs for 2010 and could survive without Roundup Ready seed in 2011.

8

Nor do they even purport to address whether it was reasonable to expect American Crystal to

9

commit $15 to $25 million of its growers’ money to a contingency plan with uncertain outcomes

10

based solely on the possibility that plaintiffs might do what they had not done in the years this

11

case was pending—file a preliminary injunction motion and attempt to assert irreparable harm.

12

In contrast to the speculation of counsel based on a small subset of unauthenticated documents,

13

an evidentiary hearing would allow the Court to actually assess these issues on a full record.

14

Like the attorney declaration and exhibits that are the subject of intervenors’ February

15

24th evidentiary objections, the latest declaration and collected attachments are insufficient to

16

support injunctive relief, as they are vague, speculative, lack foundation, mischaracterize the

17

evidence, rely on hearsay, and contain inadmissible lay opinions. 2

18

If this Court determines that the facts concerning a single uniquely situated processor are

19

relevant to the case, it should have access to facts rather than attorney declarations submitted

20

after intervenors’ response. And because these issues are thoroughly disputed and plaintiffs’

21

proposed relief would have unambiguously permanent effects across this nation, that relief

22

cannot be granted without an evidentiary hearing. Charlton v. Estate of Charlton, 841 F.2d 988,

are in the midst of discovery. Indeed, to put plaintiffs’ request in context, the Court should

2

understand that just yesterday plaintiffs indicated for the first time that they had 36 megabytes of

3

additional electronically stored information to produce to defendants and intervenors.3 Those

4

documents were produced this afternoon. This would, of course, be no problem if we remained

5

focused on the June remedies hearing and briefing that begins on March 12. But if plaintiffs’

6

motion for leave is granted it will open the door to additional submissions by defendants and

7

intervenors if and when plaintiffs complete their production (as well as even more piecemeal

8

submissions by plaintiffs should defendants or intervenors produce any more materials). And

9

this scattered approach to the presentation of “evidence” raises questions about the completeness

10

of the record being presented to the Court on preliminary injunction.

11

Moreover, plaintiffs give an incomplete picture of the discovery process. Although

12

plaintiffs argue that this is not a discovery dispute (to avoid the meet and confer requirements

13

that a discovery dispute would present), it sure sounds like one. Plaintiffs essentially claim that

14

documents needed for their preliminary injunction motion were not supplied in a timely fashion.

15

Individual intervenors began production of documents prior to the date plaintiffs identify, in

16

some cases as early as January. And plaintiffs did not even ask intervenors to prioritize

17

documents relating to their preliminary injunction reply until close of business on February 12.

18

Intervenors responded to that new request with productions beginning two business days later

19

(and concluding in time for plaintiffs’ filing – indeed, plaintiffs attached many American Crystal

20

documents to its reply). 4

Declaration of Gilbert S. Keteltas (“Plaintiffs would like to produce additional documents today,
including some of the documents you requested during the meet and confer last week. In total,
the supplemental production is about 36 MB.”).

4

Many of the documents produced, including nearly all the documents plaintiffs attach to their
motion, required confidentiality designations. The parties did not reach consensus on a
confidentiality agreement and file that agreement with the Court until February 8th.
