MOTION OF NONPARTY TO QUASH OR MODIFY SUBPOENA

I. Introduction

Recently I received a letter from my ISP about a subpoena, which included a copy of the
Order Granting Malibu Media, LLC Application for Leave to Take Discovery. I was referred to
as John Doe #10 and was a joinder with ten other John Does as committing copyright
infringement. In an effort to cut court costs the Plaintiff is suing as many individuals as possible,
and is using improper joinder. The Plaintiff's joinder of eleven defendants in this single action is
improper and runs the risk of creating unfairness and denying individual justice to those sued.
The reason I am filing this motion is to respectfully request that my personal information not be
divulged.
i. Procedural History and Statement of Facts

The Plaintiff, Malibu Media, has invoked Rule 45 to secure the identities of the
defendants, John Does 1-11, from their respective internet service providers ("ISPs"). Plaintiff
has designated all defendants as "John Does" because Plaintiff does not know their identities.
There are eleven John Does in this case, and each of the John Does is identified only by an
internet protocol ("IP") address assigned by an ISP which was commenced by the Plaintiff on
January 22, 2013. By filing Motions to Serve Third-Party Subpoenas on the ISPs, to Comcast
Cable Internet Service, pursuant to Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the
subpoenas require the ISPs to provide Plaintiff with the names and addresses, as well as
additional identification information, of the John Does, so that Plaintiff can serve each with
process to save court costs.

The Court granted Plaintiff's Motions in substance, but imposed a number of conditions

on the service of the third-party subpoena. In particular, the Court ordered that the subpoena be

Case 2:12-cv-07726-KM-MAH Filed 2/18/2013
accompanied by a statement of rights under Rule 45 to inform the subscribers of their procedural
rights to challenge their obligation to provide the information sought by the subpoena. See
Malibu Media, LLC. v. John Does 1-11, No. 12-cv-7726 (KM), ECF No. 4-3. As John Doe #10,
I seek to enforce the right recognized by the Court.

Il. Legal Standard

Under New Jersey Rule of Court 1:9-2A, a court may, on motion, quash or modify a
subpoena if compliance would be "unreasonable or oppressive." Similarly, R. 4:10-3 permits a
target of discovery to seek a protective order shielding him from discovery that would result in
"annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense." See also Kerr v. Able
Sanitary & Env. Services, Inc., 295 N.J. Super. 147, 155 fn4 (App. Div. 1996) (motion to quash
discovery subpoena is considered equivalent of motion for protective order).
IV. Argument

There are four separate grounds to quash the subpoena to Comcast. First, the subpoena
requires time and the ability to respond accordingly which is not possible in this case. Second,
the subpoena is not reasonably calculated to lead to any admissible evidence. Third, the
requirements necessary to apply joinder in this case have not been met. Fourth, Malibu Media
does not truly seek to take the case to court, they merely seek to cut court costs to discover the
identities of the John Does to settle outside of court.

A. The Subpoena Requires Ability to Respond

The Plaintiff looks to use joinder to create a common case against John Does 1-11, but
John Does were made aware of the served subpoena but have no ability in which to provide a
common defense. The John Does do not have the ability for a practical response because of the

reasons, including, but not limited to the following: (i) the likelihood that each John Doe

Page 4

 
Case 2:12-cv-07726-KM-MAH Document 9 Filed 02/19/13 Page 5 of 10 PagelD: 103
Case 2:12-cv-07726-KM-MAH Fited 2/18/2013
defendant will assert different defenses, thereby adding factual and legal questions that are not
common among all defendants, (ii) the likelihood that many of the John Doe defendants are not
the actual individuals who illegally downloaded the motion pictures in question, (iii) the
likelihood that joinder will facilitate coercive settlements among the John Doe defendants; and
(iv) plaintiff's avoidance of paying filing fees by pursuing mass actions. See, e.g., Malbu Media,
LLC v. John Does 1-22, No. 12-cv-3139, ECF No. 17 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 28, 2012) (Savage, J.);
Next Phase Distnb., Inc. V. John Does 1-27, No. 12-cv-3755(VM), 2012 WL 3117182
(S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2012); Digital Sins, Inc. v. John Does 1-245, No. 11-cv-8170(CM), 2012 WL
1744838 (S.D.N.Y. May 15, 2012); In re BitTorrent Adult Film Copyright Infringement Cases,
Nos. 11-cv-3995, 12-cv-1147, 12-cv-1150, 12-cv-1154, 2012 WL 1570765 (E.D.N.Y. May 1,
2012).

B. The Information and Materials Sought by the Subpoena Are Not Likely to

Lead to Admissible Evidence

What the Plaintiff seeks ultimately is the person or persons who committed the copyright
infringement, however, discovery of the names and information of the John Does does not
necessarily lead to the information desired. The software used in file sharing such as the
BittTorrent software does not work in the manner the Plaintiff may allege, computer-based
technology allows nonsubscribers to access a particular IP address and that a mere subscriber to
an ISP is not necessarily a copyright infringer. In other words, according to the declaration,
there is no reason to assume an ISP subscriber is the same person who may be using BitTorrent
to download the alleged copyrighted material.

Although the provision of this information may help identify the proper defendant, the

way the technology works, it is not sufficiently tailored to lead to the identification of the

Case 2:12-cv-07726-KM-MAH Filed 2/18/2013

individual as the individual may not have committed the infringement from this address.

Cc, The Precedence Against Mass Joinder in Copyright Troll Cases

Mass joinder of individuals has been disapproved by federal courts in both the RIAA
cases and elsewhere. As one court noted:

Comcast subscriber John Doe | could be an innocent parent whose internet access was
abused by her minor child, while John Doe 2 might share a computer with a roommate
who infringed Plaintiffs' works. John Does 3 through 203 could be thieves, just as
Plaintiffs believe, inexcusably pilfering Plaintiffs' property and depriving them, and their
artists, of the royalties they are rightly owed. ...

Wholesale litigation of these claims is inappropriate, at least with respect to a vast
majority (if not all) of Defendants.

BMG Music v. Does 1-203, No. Civ.A. 04-650, 2004 WL 953888, at *1 (ED. Pa. Apr. 2, 2004)
(severing lawsuit involving 203 defendants).
Rule 20 requires that, for parties to be joined in the same lawsuit, the claims against them
must arise from a single transaction or a series of closely related transactions. Specifically:
Persons . . . may be joined in one action as defendants if: (A) any right to relief is asserted
against them jointly, severally or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the
same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any
question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 20. Thus, multiple defendants may be joined in a single lawsuit only when three

conditions are met:

(1) the right to relief must be "asserted against them jointly, severally or in the
alternative"; (2) the claim must atl out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series

common to all the defendants Id

Joinder based on separate but similar behavior by individuals allegedly using the Internet
to commit copyright infringement has been rejected by courts across the country. In LaFace
Records, ELC v. Does 1-38, No. 5:07-CV-298-BR, 2008 WL 544992 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 27, 2008),

the court ordered severance of lawsuit against thirty-eight defendants where each defendant used

Case 2:12-cv-07726-KM-MAH Filed 2/18/2013
the same ISP as well as some of the same peer-to-peer ("P2P") networks to commit the exact
same violation of the law in exactly the same way. The court explained: "{MJerely committing
the same type of violation in the same way does not link defendants together for purposes of
joinder." LaFace Records, 2008 WL 544992, at *2. In BMG Music v. Does 1-4, No. 3:06-cv-
01579-MHP, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53237, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. July 31, 2006), the court sua
sponte severed multiple defendants in action where the only connection between them was
allegation they used same ISP to conduct copyright infringement. See also [Interscope Records v.
Does 1-25, No. 6:04-cv-197-Orl-22DAB, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27782 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1, 2004)
(magistrate recommended sua sponte severance of multiple defendants in action where only
connection between them was allegation they used same ISP and P2P network to conduct
copyright infringement); BMG Music v. Does 1-203, No. Civ.A. 04-650, 2004 WL 953888, at *1
(E.D. Pa. Apr. 2, 2004) (severing lawsuit involving 203 defendants); General Order, In re Cases

demonstrate proper joinder).

D. The Plaintiff Seeks to Cut Court Costs and Avoid Court Altogether
When Plaintiff receives this information from the ISPs, it contacts the subscribers
associated with the IP addresses, usually by letter, advising them of the lawsuits and offering
them an opportunity to settle by payment of a monetary sum. If the John Doe defendant who
receives the letter agrees to pay, Plaintiff dismisses the complaint against that defendant with
prejudice and without any further court proceedings, thus avoiding the public disclosure of the
defendant's identity. If the John Doe defendant refuses to settle, or Plaintiff has been unable to
serve the complaint within the 120 days required under Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, subject to any extension granted by the court, with whatever information is provided
by the ISP, Plaintiff dismisses the complaint against that defendant without prejudice to
Plaintiff's ability to commence a subsequent action against that defendant. In this fashion,
Plaintiff has initiated hundreds of lawsuits in various district courts throughout the country, but
has not yet proceeded to trial in any case from what I could uncover.
The joinder of multiple John Doe defendants could very well lead to litigation abuses.
The purpose of the joinder rules is to promote efficiency, not to use federal district courts as
small claims collection agencies, by putting economic pressure on individuals who do not have
substantive liability. Judge Colleen McMahon in a similar BitTorrent case: "I am second to
none in my dismay at the theft of copyrighted material that occurs every day on the internet.
However, there is a right way and a wrong way to litigate, and so far this way strikes me as the
wrong way." Digital Sins, Inc. V. John Does 1-245, No, 11-cv-8170(CM), 2012 WL 1744838,
at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 15, 2012).
Vv. Conclusion

name or location.

2. T did not download the alleged video.

3. I operate a Linksys router at my home; this devise is capable of operating two
wireless networks simultaneously, and can divide the internet service at my home
to multiple wireless internet connected devices.

4. In fact, I use this router to operate two wireless networks - one is a secure
network with at least six authorized users; one is an open, unsecured network for
the convenience of my guests.

5. My open network allows anyone to connect to my internet service without
entering a password.
6. The Linksys router has a range of approximately 100 feet, which would allow

many of the neighbors to access my guest network; the radius also reaches to the
street in front of and into the area behind my property.

The case I present before the Court raises essentially two separate questions. First,
should the motions to quash the third-party subpoenas to the ISPs be granted? Second, is the
filing of a single complaint joining multiple John Does proper, or should the Court grant the
motions to sever?

In some of these cases, judges have quashed the subpoenas and ordered severance,
requiring the plaintiff to file new complaints against each John Doe defendant and proceed
against them individually. See, e.g., Malbu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-22, No. 12-cv-3139,
ECF No. 17 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 28, 2012) (Savage, J.); K-Beech, Inc. v. John Does 1-36, No. 11-cv-
5058, ECF No. 30 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 21, 2011) (Kelly, J.); K-Beech, Inc. v. John Does 1-78, No. 11-
cv-5060, ECF No. 13 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 3, 2011) (Schiller, J.). In these cases it was seen fit that the
motions to quash should be supported because the use of joinder by the Plaintiffs as in this case

is inappropriate and unjust.
