UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCON SIN

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
Case No. 06-CR-320

v.
DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL

D AVID R. O LOFSON, by counsel, renews his motion for a judgment of
acquittal pursuant to F ED. R. C RIM. P. 29(c)(1). Judgment of acquittal is appropriate
because no rational jury could find that Mr. Olofson knowingly transferred a
machine gun. Moreover, a judgment of acquittal is also appropriate because 26
U.S.C. § 5845(b), which defines the term “machine gun” is unconstitutionally vague.
I.

Insufficient Evidence.
A district court must enter a judgment of acquittal on grounds of

insufficient evidence if it concludes that no rational trier of fact could have found the

defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Jackson, 335 F.3d 170,
180 (2d Cir. 2003). Based upon the facts of this case, it is clear that no rational jury
could have found beyond any reasonable doubt that the weapon at issue here was
a machine gun.
As relayed in the jury instructions in this case, a machine gun is defined
as “any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to
shoot automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single
function fo the trigger. “ 26 U.S.C. § 5845. Under this definition, no rational jury
could conclude that Mr. Olofson’s AR-15 rifle is a machine gun.
As counsel argued at trial, the definition of “machine gun” is not fluid
– a weapon must either a machine gun or not. The definition is written in the
present tense, which contemplates that a weapon will only qualify under the
definition if it is in fact a machine gun. A weapon cannot qualify just because it fired
automatically once or twice. If Congress had intended for weapons to qualify as
machine guns because that weapon had, at some earlier point in tim e, fired
automatically even though it doers not do so currently, the statute would have been
written in past tense to read, for example, “ any weapon that has shot....”
Accordingly, the only reasonable interpretation of the definition of “machine gun”
requires that a weapon must continually possess the qualities of a machine gun. In
other words, the statute assumes that if a weapon was a machine gun at the time of

the offense, it would still be a machine gun at the time of the trial or even today. A
weapon cannot “sometimes” be a machine gun. For example, if a weapon only has
a fifty percent chance of firing automatically, it cannot be a machine gun.
If the court accepts Mr. Olofson’s interpretation of the definition of
machine gun, a reasonable doubt instantly arises as whether Mr. Olofson’s AR-15
is a machine gun. In the first out of three tests of this weapon by ATF Officer
Kingery, he testified that he determ ined that Mr. Olofson’s rifle was not a machine
gun, but instead was exhibiting a malfunction called “hammer follow through,”
where the hammer of the rifle is not caught and held in place by the disconnector,
but instead follows the bolt carrier as it chambers another round of ammunition.
The hammer, then, accidentally strikes the newly chambered round of ammunition.
Officer Kingery then testified that in the subsequent tests when he used a softprimered, more sensitive ammunition, the weapon exhibited the same “hammer
follow through” malfunction, but now because of the soft ammunition, fired
multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger and was, therefore, a machine gun.
To accept the government’s argument that based upon Officer Kingery’s tests, Mr.
Olofson’s AR-15 must be a machine gun is to allow the determination of whether
something is a machine gun to be dependent on the type of ammunition used. And
it alows the government to prosecute a person for possessing a firearm that merely
sometimes acts like a machine gun (in this case, according to the government’s tests

only 66% of the time).

The statute does not and cannot allow for such an

interpretation. Consequently, no rational jury could have determined beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Olofson’s AR-15 is a machine gun.
II.

Void for Vagueness.
Based upon the facts of this case, 26 U.S.C. § 5845, which defines the

term “machine gun” is unconstitutionally vague, because it fails to place clear limits
on which weapons can be considered “machine guns” and because the statute, as
written, allows for arbitrary and capricious enforcement of the statute.
“The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define
the criminal offense with sufficient definitiveness that ordinary people can
understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Collins, 272 F.3d 984, 988
(7th Cir. 2001)(quoting Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983)). Vague statutes
pose two problems. First, “they fail to provide due notice so that ordinary people
can understand what is prohibited. Id. Second, “they encourage arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement.” Id. The second prong is a more serious issue than the
first. Id.
With regard to the second problem, “the legislature must establish
minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.” Kolender 461 U.S. at 358. “Where
the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may

permit a ‘standardless sweep’ [that] allows policemen, prosecutors and juries to
pursue their personal predilections.” Id.(quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 575
(1974)).
Because Olofson does not challenge the statute on First Amendment
grounds, his challenge is examined on an as-applied basis. Collins, 272 F.3d at 988.
An “as applied” challenge is not ripe until all of the facts have been revealed. United
States v. Reed, 114 F.3d 1067, 1070 (10th Cir. 1997).
This case poses the issue of whether Mr. Olofson weapon is a malfunctioning,
but legal, AR-15 rifle or an illegal machine gun. The government’s expert testified
that in each test, the weapon was exhibiting the “hammer follow through”
malfunction. However, depending upon the type of ammunition used sometimes
it functioned like a machine gun and sometimes it did not. With the hard-primered
military style (but commercially available) ammunition, the weapon did not fire
multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger. With the soft-primered hunting
ammunition, the weapon did fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger.
Based upon these facts, even if Mr. Olofson was aware of the tests, he could not
know whether he had a malfunctioning rifle or a machine gun.
Moreover, the government’s fluid interpretation of the statue allows for
arbitrary enforcement of the statute.

On these facts and based upon the

government’s interpretation of the statute, it is clear that the ATF can m anipulate its

testing procedures to arbitrarily turn a malfunctioning weapon into a machine gun.
Because the statute is subject to such arbitrary enforcement, it is unconstitutionally
vague.
Mr. Olofson therefore asks for a judgment of acquittal.
