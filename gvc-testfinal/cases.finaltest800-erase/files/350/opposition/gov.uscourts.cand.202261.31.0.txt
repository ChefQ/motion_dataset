The defendant Becky Christian has filed a Motion to Sever. That motion should be
denied.

As an initial matter, Christian's motion fails because she has not established (or even
argued) that her defense and Nosal's defense are mutually antagonistic and, thus, irreconcilable.
In truth, the core of Christian's defense (i.cent., that she did not possess the requisite intent and that
the materials at issue are not "trade secrets") and Nosal's purported defense (i.e., that he was
ignorant of Christian's and other individuals' activities) are not mutually antagonistic in the sense
of being irreconcilable. In other words, if a jury acquits Nosal based on his purported defense, it
could still acquit Christian based on hers. Yet, "[t]o be entitled to severance on the basis of
mutually antagonistic defenses, a defendant must show that the core of the codefendant's defense
is so irreconcilable with the core of his own defense that the acceptance of the codefendant's

theory by the jury precludes acquittal of the defendant." United States v. Throckmorton, 87 F.3d

1069, 1072 (9" Cir. 1996). Here, because a jury could accept either defendant's defense without
convicting the other defendant, the defenses are not mutually antagonistic. Christian therefore
has not met her burden of demonstrating that "there is serious risk that a joint trial would
prejudice a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable
judgment about guilt or innocence." Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993).

Christian's other arguments regarding Nosal acting as a "second prosecutor" also do not
support a finding that severance is warranted. In cases in which the Ninth Circuit has found that
a joint trial was so prejudicial so as to require reversal based on a "second prosecutor"
phenomenon, the co-defendant's counsel had engaged in blatant and unchecked misbehavior.
See United States v. Mayfield, 189 F.3d 895, 899-900 (9" Cir. 1999) (noting that co-defendant's
counsel "flouted" court's orders with respect to exclusion of evidence and "used every
opportunity to introduce impermissible evidence against Mayfield"); United States v. Tootick,
952 F.2d 1078, 1086 (9" Cir. 1991) (finding reversible error where trial judge failed to adopt
adequate safeguards because, for example, "[n]o reins were placed on defendants' respective
counsel as they acted as unsanctioned prosecutors"). In this case, there simply is no reason to
believe that Nosal's counsel will engage in the same type of misbehavior as the attorneys in
Mayfield and Tootick, or that this Court would be unable to put the kibosh on any such
shenanigans.

For these reasons, and for all of the reasons stated below, this Court should deny the
defendant Christian's motion to sever.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Indictment charges the defendants David Nosal and Becky Christian with crimes
related to a conspiracy and scheme (1) to steal information from the computer systems of their
former employer - the executive search firm Korn/Ferry International - and (2) to defraud
Korn/Ferry out of $25,000 per month.

Counts Two through Ten charge that Nosal and Christian (along with at least two other
co-conspirators, "J.F." and "M.J.") obtained proprietary information (including trade secrets)

from Korn/Ferry's computer system to assist them in their own executive search activities.

Case 3:08-cr-00237-MHP Document 31 Filed 06/09/2008 Page 6of15

Particular instances of unauthorized access to Korn/Ferry's computer system using "J.F.'s"
Korn/Ferry password for the purpose of obtaining information are alleged in Counts Two through
Seven. Counts Eight and Nine allege that several sets of information so obtained also constituted
trade secrets. Count One is a conspiracy charge encompassing all of this conduct. "J.F." and
"M.J." have already pleaded guilty to Informations with respect to this portion of the case.

Counts Ten through Eighteen pertain to a related scheme to defraud Korn/Ferry. As set
forth in the Indictment, Nosal had entered into an agreement with Korn/Ferry upon termination
of his employment in which he agreed to work only as an independent contractor for Korn/Ferry
for the period of one year. In exchange, Korn/Ferry agreed to pay Nosal $25,000 per month,
among other payments, beginning in late 2004. Despite this agreement, Nosal and Christian set
up the firm Christian & Associates behind which Nosal engaged in executive search activities.
Although presented the opportunity to do so in meetings with Korn/Ferry executives, Nosal did
not disclose these activities to Korn/Ferry. The mailings of the monthly $25,000 checks from
Korn/Ferry to Nosal's home in this District are alleged as specific instances of mail fraud in
Counts Ten through Seventeen. Count Eighteen charges a conspiracy to commit mail fraud. The
evidence in this case will show that Christian was aware of Nosal's independent contractor
agreement with Korn/Ferry and that she participated in the scheme to defraud Korn/Ferry.

LEGAL STANDARD REGARDING MOTIONS FOR SEVERANCE

There is a preference for joint trials of defendants who are indicted together. The
Supreme Court has recognized that "[j]oint trials play a vital role in the criminal justice system."
See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993) (quotation omitted). This is because "[t]he
rules are designed to promote economy and efficiency and to avoid a multiplicity of trials, where
these objectives can be achieved without substantial prejudice to the right of defendants to a fair
trial." Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 131 n.6 (1968) (quotation omitted); see also
Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537 (noting that joint trials "promote efficiency and serve the interests of
justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts") (quotation omitted).

Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows severance when it is apparent

that a joint trial would cause prejudice to one or more defendants.' Although courts have found
severance to be appropriate where there are mutually antagonistic defenses, "[m]utually
antagonistic defenses are not prejudicial per se." Id. at 538. Rather, the Court has held that "a
district court should grant severance under Rule 14 only if there is serious risk that a joint trial
would prejudice a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a
reliable judgment about guilt or innocence." Jd. at 539 (emphasis added). Simply put, the mere
fact that two or more defendants may have antagonistic defenses is not a proper ground for
severance. Rather, "[t]o be entitled to severance on the basis of mutually antagonistic defenses, a
defendant must show that the core of the codefendant's defense is so irreconcilable with the core
of his own defense that the acceptance of the codefendant's theory by the jury precludes acquittal
of the defendant." Throckmorton, 87 F.3d at 1072.

The Supreme Court has held that the risk of prejudice posed by joint trials can be cured
by proper jury instructions. See Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 540-41; id. at 539 (holding that Rule 14
"leaves the tailoring of the relief to be granted, if any, to the district court's sound discretion').
In an analogous context, the Ninth Circuit has held that "[a] defendant seeking a severance based
on the `spillover' effect of evidence admitted against a co-defendant must also demonstrate the
insufficiency of limiting instructions." United States v. Joetzki, 952 F.2d 1090, 1094 (9" Cir.
1991) (citation omitted).

The burden is on the defendant to prove that there would be prejudice in a joint trial. See

United States v. Quezada, CR 95-20026-JW, 1995 WL 507064, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 21, 1995)

(citing United States v. Felix-Gutierrez, 940 F.2d 1200, 1209 (9" Cir. 1991)); accord United
States v. Bastian, 112 F. Supp.2d 378, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) ("[A] defendant who seeks separate
trials under Rule 14 carries a heavy burden of showing that joinder will result in `substantial

299

prejudice.'"). A trial court's denial of a severance motion will be reviewed on appeal for abuse

of discretion. See Tootick, 952 F.2d at 1080 ("Defendants must meet a heavy burden to show

 

' Although the defendant quotes an earlier version of Rule 14 in her Motion, see Def's
Mtn., at 6:9-11, the 2002 amendments did not result in any material change to the rule.

such an abuse, and the trial judge's decision will seldom be disturbed."); see also United States v.
Johnson, 297 F.3d 845, 955 (9" Cir. 2002) ("Denial of severance will be reversed only when the
joint trial was so manifestly prejudicial as to require the trial judge to exercise his discretion [on
the motion to sever] in just one way, by ordering a separate trial.") (quotations omitted).

With these principles in mind, the United States now turns to the arguments advanced by
the defendant Christian in support of her motion to sever.

ARGUMENT

In this case, the defendant Becky Christian contends that severance is required under Rule
14 because her trial rights will be prejudiced by a joint trial based on the fact that the defendants
will present "antagonistic" defenses. As set forth in more detail below, each of the arguments
raised by the defendant is without merit, and the Court should deny her motion.

I. THERE HAS BEEN NO SHOWING THAT THE DEFENSES ARE MUTUALLY

ANTAGONISTIC AND IRRECONCILABLE.

The defendant argues that she and her co-defendant Nosal will present antagonistic
defenses. However, even if Nosal's defense will be to claim ignorance of Christian's and the
other co-conspirators' actions, the core of that defense is not irreconcilable with the core of
Christian's defense.

In this regard, it is important to focus on what "antagonistic" means in the context of a
severance motion. The Ninth Circuit has held that

[i]t is difficult to obtain severance on the basis of a mutually antagonistic defense

claim. ... To demonstrate that competing defenses amounted to manifest

prejudice in a joint trial, a defendant must show the core of the co-defendant's

defense is so irreconcilable with the core of his own defense that the acceptance of

the co-defendant's theory by the jury precludes acquittal of the defendant.

Johnson, 297 F.3d at 858 (quotation omitted); see also Throckmorton, 87 F.3d at 1072
("Antagonism between defenses or the desire of one defendant to exculpate himself by
inculpating a codefendant . . . is insufficient to require severance."). Severance is proper only
when the codefendants have shown that their defenses are irreconcilable and mutually exclusive.

United States v. Angwin, 271 F.3d 786, 795 (9" Cir. 2001) (citation omitted), overruled on other
grounds, United States v. Lopez, 484 F.3d 1186 (9" Cir. 2007). "Defenses are mutually

exclusive when `acquittal of one codefendant would necessarily call for the conviction of the
other." Jd. (quoting Tootick); see also Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 538 (noting that antagonistic defenses
"are not prejudicial per se").

Here, the defendant has not shown that the defendants' defenses will be mutually
exclusive and that Nosal's acquittal based on a defense that "Christian [and others] did it"
"would necessarily call for the conviction of [Christian]." Angwin, 271 F.3d at 795. On the
contrary, if Nosal were to assert such a defense and the jury accepted it, the jury need not
conclude that Christian was guilty. As an initial matter, Christian will apparently admit that she
did "do it" (e.g., that she accessed Korn/Ferry's computer systems). Rather, according to
Christian her "defense will focus on the utterly minor nature of the alleged `misappropriations'
from Korn/Ferry . . . and her lack of intent to defraud or otherwise harm Korn/Ferry." Def's
Mtn., at 4:9-12; see also id. at 1 ("she never intended to defraud Korn/Ferry').'

Accordingly, although a jury's acceptance of any defense by Nosal that "Christian did it"
might mean that it would acquit Nosal, that jury need not also conclude that Christian acted with
the necessary intent, or that the items that she obtained from Korn/Ferry's computer system
represented "things of value" or "trade secrets."

Indeed, Christian's "defense" that she was threatened and intimidated by Nosal to commit
the alleged crimes - and that therefore she did not form the requisite intent, see Def's Mtn., at 8

- is not much of a defense at all. Although unclear from the defendant's motion, it is possible

 

* The facts that the government and a party may have engaged in pre-indictment
discussions and that government counsel may have expressed opinions regarding the veracity of
any individual, see Def's Mtn., at 1:17-21, are irrelevant to the issue of whether a severance is
required. This is because a motion for severance deals with the question of whether a joint trial
would prejudice the `rial rights of the moving defendant. Because evidence of plea negotiations
is inadmissible, and because government prosecutors are not allowed to vouch for the veracity of
witnesses, this Court should ignore the facts presented by Christian in this regard. See United
States v. Edwards, 154 F.3d 915, 921 (9" Cir. 1998) ("A prosecutor may not impart to the jury
his belief that a government witness is credible."').

That being said, to the extent that Christian's motion suggests that government counsel
opined at any time that Christian's purported defense of not possessing the requisite intent was
credible, such a suggestion would be incorrect.

that Christian means to show that she acted under some type of coercion or duress. However, in
order to prove a defense of duress, a defendant must establish that (1) she acted under an
immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) she had a well-grounded fear that the
threat would be carried out; and (3) there was no reasonable opportunity to escape the threatened
harm. See, e.g., United States v. Shryock, 342 V.3d 948, 987 (9" Cir. 2003); United States v.
Karr, 742 F.2d 493, 497 (9" Cir. 1984); see also 9" Cir. Model Jury Instr. 6.5 (noting that
defendant does not act intentionally if defendant acted under duress, coercion or compulsion at
time of offense). There is no allegation here that Nosal threatened Christian with death or serious
bodily harm, nor does Christian proffer any evidence to support the conclusions that she had a
well-grounded fear that any such threats would be carried and that she did not have a reasonable
opportunity to escape any threatened harm. For these reasons, it is possible that this Court would
not even allow Christian's proffered evidence to be admitted at trial. See, e.g., United States v.
Vasquez-Landaver, - F.3d -, 2008 WL 2120494, at *5 (9 Cir. May 21, 2008) (upholding
district court's exclusion of evidence regarding threats to defendant); Karr, 742 F.2d at 497

27 66

(noting that although "[o]rdinarily the duress defense is submitted to the jury," "[i]f the evidence
is insufficient to support the defense as a matter of law. . . the court may exclude evidence of the
defense"); see also United States v. Becerra, 992 F.2d 960, 964 (9" Cir. 1993) (noting that
evidence of "threats, promises and allegedly illegal acts" was properly excluded with respect to
duress defense, where defendant failed to establish prima facie case of duress). Far from being a
defense to the charges against her, Christian's argument that she committed the acts alleged in
the Indictment - but only at Nosal's behest - is tantamount to a confession.'

Significantly, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that "courts have regularly rejected the

argument that a defense based on ignorance [i.e., Nosal's purported defense] is irreconcilable

with a defense based on a lack of guilty intent [7.e., Christian's defense]." Angwin, 271 F.3d at

 

> The United States also notes that the FBI report submitted by Christian does not support
the conclusion that Christian committed the alleged acts out of fear of Nosal. Christian's report
to the government regarding Nosal's behavior related only to his post-offense conduct. See
Further Decl. of Steven Bauer, Ex. 2, at Bates US001375-76.
