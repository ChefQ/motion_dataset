Movant Shahpour Javidzad respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition
to the motions by Inna Kreerand (docket no. 13), Reza Karkonan (docket no. 16) and Allan
Candelore (docket no. 19) to be appointed Lead Plaintiff in this case and in further support of
Mr. Javidzad’s motion to be appointed Lead Plaintiff (docket no. 23). The Court’s November 14
scheduling order (docket no. 9) requires that any opposition to a Lead Plaintiff motion be filed
by today. Mr. Javidzad has separately moved for relief from the scheduling order (docket no.
24).

A preliminary review of Mr. Javidzad’s transactions indicates that his losses are many

times the losses claimed by any of the other three Lead Plaintiff movants. For the reasons
discussed in his memorandum of law in support of his motion to be appointed Lead Plaintiff,
however, we have not yet been able to accurately calculate his losses. Mr. Javidzad’s
transactions are numerous and complex and he and his attorneys want to ensure the accuracy of
the information provided to the Court. Mr. Javidzad will provide this information as soon as
reasonably possible or as otherwise directed by the Court.
All the Lead Plaintiff movants in this case are in agreement that, in a securities class
action such as this consolidated litigation, the PSLRA requires a court to appoint “the most
adequate plaintiff” as Lead Plaintiff. The law further provides that the “most adequate plaintiff”
is presumptively the member who has “the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the
class,” provided that that person has timely filed a complaint or a Lead Plaintiff motion seeking
appointment as Lead Plaintiff, and “otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u 4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I).
Mr. Javidzad meets these criteria. He has timely filed a motion to be appointed as Lead
Plaintiff and, as explained in the memorandum of law filed in support of his motion, he satisfies
the requirements of Rule 23. Most importantly, because, as will shortly be shown, he suffered
significantly larger losses than any other movant, Mr. Javidzad “has the largest financial interest
in the relief sought by the class.”
Additional factors also weigh in favor of granting Mr. Javidzad’s motion. Mr. Javidzad
lives in California, which will facilitate his ability to supervise litigation in this district, and he
plans to personally attend the hearing on the competing Lead Plaintiff motions.
