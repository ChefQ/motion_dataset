L INTRODUCTION

Proposed Lead Plaintiff Inna Kreer ("Kreer') respectfully submits this memorandum of
law in support of her motion, pursuant to Section 21D(a)(3)(B) of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (the "PSLRA"), 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B), for an Order (@) appointing Ms. Kreer as Lead
Plaintiff in this action on behalf of investors that purchased the securities of LDK Solar ("LDR")
between August 1, 2007 and October 3, 2007, inclusive (the "Class Period") and (ii) approving
Ms. Kreer's selection of Schatz Nobel Izard P.C. as Lead Counsel.

Ms. Kreer's motion should be granted. As is shown below, Ms. Kreer's motion is timely

as it is filed within 60 days of the first published notice of this class action litigation against

Defendants. Furthermore, Ms. Kreer is the "most adequate plaintiff" within the meaning of 15
U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B) because she has the largest financial interest of any Lead Plaintiff
Movant in the relief sought by the proposed Class, and otherwise meets the requirements of Fed.
R. Civ. P. 23(a). Finally, Ms. Kreer's selection of Schatz Nobel Izard P.C. as Lead Counsel
should be approved, as it has experience prosecuting securities class action litigation.

II. SUMMARY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS

On October 9, 2007, counsel for Plaintiff Allan Candalore filed a complaint in this
district on behalf of all persons who purchased the securities of LDK between August 1, 2007
and October 3, 2007 (the "Class"). Since then, four additional cases have been filed in this Court
on behalf of the Class against the Defendants.'

By their Complaints, Plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that LDK Solar and certain of its
officers and directors (collectively "Defendants") violated Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing materially false and
misleading statements. Specifically, the Complaints allege that Defendants issued false
statements describing LDK's business fundamentals, financial results and earnings growth
potential. Specifically, Defendants concealed that LDK's internal controls were flawed,
preventing it from accurately measuring or reporting its inventory. As a result, the Company's
inventories were materially overstated, causing inflation in LDK's reporting of assets, earnings

and earnings per share ("EPS") reported during the Class Period.

On October 3, 2007, it was reported that LDK's Financial Controller, Charley Situ, had
resigned stating that LDK lacked internal controls and that the Company's reported inventory of
polysilicon was overstated by 25%. Then on October 4, 2007, LDK disclosed that it would have
an independent outside auditor investigate Situ's allegations. In response to this news, the

Company's American Depository Shares ("ADS"), which traded as high as $76.75 on September

 

1 Additional similar cases have also been filed alleging securities fraud against the
Defendants in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

I. MS. KREER SHOULD BE APPOINTED AS A LEAD PLAINTIFF

A. The Procedure for Appointment of Lead Plaintiff Under the PSLRA

The PSLRA sets forth the procedure governing the appointment of Lead Plaintiff in each
private action arising under the 1934 Act that is brought as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(1). Under the first step of this
procedure, the plaintiff who files a putative class action under the Act must publish a notice
advising members of the purported plaintiff class of the (1) pendency of the action, (11) claims
asserted therein, (iii) purported class period, and (iv) option of any member of the purported class
to move to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class not later than 60 days after the date on
which the notice is published. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A).

Under the PSLRA, the Court is then required to appoint as lead plaintiff the "most
adequate plaintiff," which the Act defines as "the member or members of the purported plaintiff
class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class
members." See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(). The PSLRA further provides:

[T]he court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any
private action arising under this subchapter is the person or group of persons that-

(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a
notice under subparagraph (A)(i)};

(bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest
in the relief sought by the class; and

(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.

15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a\(3)(B)GiDD.' See Armour v. Network Assocs., 171 F. Supp. 2d 1044, 1048

 

? The PSLRA provides that the:
presumption [of the claimants with the largest loss being lead plaintiffs] may be
rebutted only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the
presumptively most adequate plaintiff--
(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or

(N.D. Cal. 2001); see also In re Cavanaugh, 306 F.3d 726, 729-30 (9th Cir. 2002).

B. The Notice Requirements Under The PSLRA Have Been Satisfied

The notice requirements set forth in 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A)@() and (i) have been
satisfied. On October 9, 2007, counsel for Plaintiff Allan Candalore caused a notice to be
published that advised purchasers of the securities of LDK Solar of (1) the pendency ofa
securities class action against Defendants, (ii) the claims asserted, (ili) the purported class period
in that litigation, and (iv) the right of any member of the purported class to move the court to
serve as lead plaintiff within the 60-day period (by December 10, 2007) (the "Notice").? Cf Inre
Nice Sys. Sec. Litig,, 188 F.R.D. 206, 216 (D.N-J. 1999); In re Milestone Scientific Sec. Litig.,

Mass. 1996),

Cc Ms. Kreer Has The Largest Financial
Interest In The Relief Sought By The Class

 

Ms. Kreer has "the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class" within the
meaning of 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(Gii)(D(bb). According to the information provided in the
Certification of Named Plaintiff (see Kindall Declaration, Exhibit A), Ms. Kreer sustained an
estimated loss of approximately $44,800 from transactions during the proposed Class Period.'
Ms. Kreer knows of no other persons who have sought to be Lead Plaintiff in this action who

possess a larger financial interest.

D. Ms. Kreer Has Satisfied The Other Requirements Of The PSLRA.

 

(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of
adequately representing the class.

of Mark Kindall in Support of Motion for Appointment of Lead Plaintiff and for Approval of
Choice of Counsel (the "Kindall Declaration").

4 Exhibit "A" to the Kindall Declaration shows that Ms. Kreer purchased 11,800
shares of LDK during the Class Period at a total price of $765,875.

Case 3:07-cv-05182-WHA Document14 ~ Filed 11/21/2007 Page5of9

Ms. Kreer has satisfied each of the other requirements of the PSLRA. First, she has
signed a Certification of Named Plaintiff, under oath, which:
(i) states that she has reviewed the Complaint;
(ii) states that she did not purchase the Securities of LDK Solar at the
direction of plaintiff's counsel or in order to participate in any private

action arising under the federal securities laws;

(iii) states that she is willing to serve as representative party on behalf of a
class, including providing testimony at deposition and trial, if necessary;

(iv) _ sets forth all of her transactions in the securities of LDK Solar during the
Class Period;

(v} states that she has not sought to serve, nor has she served, aS a
representative party on behalf of a class in any private federal securities
action; and

(vi) states that she will not accept any payment for serving as a representative
party on behalf of the class beyond her pro rata share of any recovery,

See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 78u-4(a)(2)(A)G)-(vi).. Ms. Kreer has also satisfied the PSLRA by moving for
appointment as lead plaintiff within sixty (60) days after the date on which the Notice was
published on October 9, 2007. See 15 US.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(ay(3\(AMGCD.

Second, Ms. Kreer satisfies the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-
4(a)\(3\(BViii)()(cc). Rule 23(a) is satisfied for the purposes of this motion where (i) the claims
of the proposed lead plaintiff are typical of the claims of the class and (ii) the proposed lead

plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Armour, 171 F. Supp. 2d at

 

3 Pursuant to the Court's Order requesting information from lead plaintiff candidates
dated November 14, 2007, Ms. Kreer will supplement this motion with the requested
questionnaire. Counsel to Ms. Kreer was informed of the Order dated November 14, 2007 on
November 20, 2007, and did not discuss the questionnaire with Ms. Kreer until then. Ms. Kreer
intents to complete and submit the questionnaire the week of November 26, 2007.

6 Although there are two other requirements under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) -- that the class
be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)) and that
there be questions of law or fact common to the class (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2)) --"Tt]ypicality
and adequacy of representation are the only provisions relevant to a determination of lead
plaintiff under the PSLRA." In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc. Sec. Litig., 182 F.R.D. 42, 49
(S.D.N.Y. 1998).

1051.

Ms. Kreer satisfies the "typicality" and "adequacy" requirements under Rule 23{a).
Under Rule 23(a)(3), the "typicality" requirement is satisfied where the claims of the proposed
class representative arise from the same course of conduct that gives rise to the other class
members' claims, where these claims are based on the same legal theory, and where the class
members and proposed class representative were injured by the same conduct. See Armour, 171
F. Supp. 2d at 1052 (citing Hannon v. Dataprods. Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)). The
"adequacy" requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) is satisfied when the proposed class representative does
not have interests antagonistic to the proposed Class, and where the proposed class representative
has retained experienced and capable counsel. In re Emulex Corp, Sec. Litig,, 210 F.R.D. 717,
720 (C.D. Cal, 2002).

In this action, Ms. Kreer's claims are typical of those claims belonging to all Class
members. Like all Class members, Ms. Kreer suffered damages from purchases of LD when
the truth was revealed about Defendants made false and misleading representations concerning
the Company in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a), of the 1934 Act. Furthermore, Ms.
Kreer's interests are clearly aligned with those of the members of the Class, and there is no
evidence of any antagonism between her interests and those of the Class.

In addition, Mr. Kreer has already demonstrated that she will adequately represent the
interests of the Class by having obtained qualified and experienced counsel, and by submitting a
Certification of Named Plaintiff to the Court indicating that she is willing to assume the
responsibilities of a class representative. All these factors demonstrate that Ms. Kreer's claims
are typical of the claims of the Class within the meaning of Rule 23(a)(3), and she will fairly and
adequately represent the interests of the Class under Rule 23(a)(4).

E. The Court Should Approve Ms. Kreer's Choice Of Counsel,

The PSLRA expressly provides that the "most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to the
approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-

4(a\(3)\(BXv). The Court should not disturb a proposed lead plaintiff's choice unless "necessary

to protect the interests of the plaintiff class." See Statement of Managers -- "The Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995," 141 Cong. Rec. H13691-08, at H13700 (daily edition
Nov. 28, 1995).

The Court should approve Schatz Nobel Izard P.C. as Lead Counsel because it has
extensive experience in the area of securities class action litigation, as detailed in its firm resume
(see Kindall Declaration, Exhibit C). Thus, the Court may be assured that the members of the
Class will receive the highest caliber of legal representation.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Kreer respectfully requests that this Court appoint her to

serve as Lead Plaintiff, and approve her selection of Schatz Nobel Izard, P.C. as Lead Counsel.
