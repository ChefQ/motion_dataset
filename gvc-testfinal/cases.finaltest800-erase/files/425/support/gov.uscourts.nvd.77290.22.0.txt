A.

Background

4

Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint on December 3,

5

2010 [Dkt. 11], arguing that Plaintiff relies on a worthless, fraudulent instrument as the basis of

6

his Complaint, and establishing that each of Plaintiff’s causes of action fails: (1) to allege facts

7

setting forth cognizable claims for relief; and/or (2) to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). On

8

December 14, 2010, Plaintiff filed an Opposition.1 Defendants filed a Reply in Support of their

9

Motion to Dismiss on December 30, 2011.

10

Plaintiff now attempts to file an untimely and procedurally improper document that is

11

substantively a supplemental “opposition.” Plaintiff already filed an Opposition to Defendants’

12

Motion to Dismiss. The rules of this Court do not allow Plaintiff to file another Opposition in

13

order to bolster the substantive failings of his first Opposition and address the arguments

14

contained in Defendants’ Reply brief.

15

B.

The Court Should Strike Plaintiff’s Opposition as Improper and Untimely

16

LR 7-2 provides for the filing of an opposition to a motion within ten (10) days after

17

service of the motion. The moving party may then file a reply memorandum of points of

18

authorities. Here, Defendants file their Motion to Dismiss, which Plaintiff opposed. Defendants

19

then filed a supporting Reply brief. Plaintiff already filed an opposition, and now attempts to file

20

a second, supplemental opposition.

21

The Supplemental Opposition is improper and the Court should strike it without giving it

22

any consideration.

23

C.

24

Conclusion
Plaintiff’s supplemental opposition seeks to address the substantive failings of the

25

Opposition he filed on December 14, 2010. Pursuant to the rules of this Court, Plaintiff cannot
