DEFENDANT FULBRIGHT & JAWORSKI, L.L.P.’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO REMAND
Defendant Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., files this its Response to Plaintiff Elizabeth A.
Gilmore’s Motion to Remand and respectfully shows:
On May 19, 2006, Plaintiff filed her Original Petition, styled Elizabeth A. Gilmore v.
Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., in the 151st Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, and
docketed as Case No. 2006-31,303, alleging claims of discrimination arising under the Texas
Commission on Human Rights Act, TEX. LABOR CODE § 21.051 et seq. On November 17, 2006,
Plaintiff filed her First Amended Original Petition, alleging for the first time a claim1 arising
under the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. Because the
federal courts have original jurisdiction over claims arising under the FMLA, see 28 U.S.C. §
1331, Defendant removed this action to this Court on December 5, 2006, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§§ 1441 and 1446.
1

Plaintiff does not argue in her Motion to Remand that she alleged a federal claim in her lawsuit prior to November
17, 2006, nor do Plaintiff’s pleadings, discovery responses, or other paper suggest such a claim was raised. See 28
U.S.C. § 1446(b). Plaintiff suggests, perhaps inadvertently, in her Motion that her lawsuit arises from violations of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). Pl.’s Motion to Rem. at 4. It is not apparent from any of Plaintiff’s
pleadings, discovery responses, or other paper that she has ever alleged an ADA claim during the pendency of this
action; instead, she has always alleged her claims arose under the TCHRA. See generally Pl.’s Orig. Pet.

On December 21, 2006, Plaintiff filed her Motion to Remand, alleging, inter alia, that
this Court lacks removal jurisdiction over her FMLA claim. Without citing a single case,
Plaintiff argues because 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2) expressly provides that Plaintiff’s FMLA claim
may be maintained in state court, this Court is without removal jurisdiction over her FMLA
claim. Plaintiff’s argument, however, has been foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court.
In Breuer v. Jim’s Concrete of Brevard, Inc., the United States Supreme Court considered
whether identical language in the Fair Labor Standards Act, 9 U.S.C. § 216(b), precludes
removal of an action to federal court. 538 U.S. 691 (2003). Resolving a circuit split, the
Supreme Court held in a unanimous opinion that the statutory language—“may be maintained . .
. in any Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction”—does not prohibit removal of an
action to federal court. Id. at 698-99.
The Supreme Court noted that several federal statutes have express exceptions to removal
jurisdiction. Id. at 696-97; see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1445 (actions against a carrier “may not be
removed” to a federal district court); 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a) (no actions arising under the federal
Securities Act of 1933 “shall be removed” to any federal district court). With references to those
express exceptions, the Court commented that “[w]hen Congress wished to give plaintiffs an
absolute choice of forum, it has show itself capable of doing so in unmistakable terms.” Id. at
697.

The Court held that the language in § 216(b)—“may be maintained”—does not

demonstrate the requisite unmistakable terms. Id. at 697.
Plaintiff also argues in his Motion that the court should strictly construe § 1441 and
removal jurisdiction. However, the Bruer Court foreclosed this argument as well. The Bruer
Court cited its opinion in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100 (1941), which
noted that removal legislation should be strictly construed. Id. at 697. However, the Bruer Court

2

Case 4:06-cv-03849

Document 9

Page 3 of 7

noted that the earlier version of §1441 at issue in the Shamrock case did not include the “except
as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress” language. Id. It was not until 1948 that
Congress amended § 1441 to include the express exception provisions that exist in the current
version of § 1441. Id.; see also Act of June 25, 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-773, 62 Stat. 937 (codified
as amended at 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)). The Bruer Court held that “whatever apparent force [the
strict construction] argument might have claimed . . . has been qualified by later statutory
development.” Id. at 697 (referencing the 1948 amendment to § 1441(a)). Thus, according to
the Bruer Court, since 1948, “whenever the subject matter of an action qualifies it for removal,
the burden is on a plaintiff to find an express exception.” Id. at 698. Continuing, the Bruer
Court held that “any congressional insistence on express exception is hardly satisfied by the
malleability of the term ‘maintain’ . . . .” Id.
The Court further emphasized that the “may be maintained” language does not convey
any particular right to remain in the original forum. Id. at 698. The Court noted that such a
construction would put the statute at odds with the change of venue provisions in 28 U.S.C. §
1404(a) by prohibiting the transfer of FLSA cases from one district to another. Id. at 698-99.
Most importantly, the Court explained that construing the “may be maintained” language
as the Bruer plaintiff proposed would extend the same exception to other federal statutes with the
same language, including the FMLA. See id. (citing the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2) (“An
action . . . may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State court . . . .”)). The Court stated that
“Bruer then, cannot have a removal exception for the FLSA without entailing exceptions for
other statutory actions, to the point that it becomes just too hard to believe that a right to
‘maintain’ an action was ever meant to displace the right to remove.” Id. at 699.
The FMLA, as referenced by the Supreme Court, sets out identical language regarding

3

Case 4:06-cv-03849

Document 9

Page 4 of 7

the right to bring a civil action:
An action to recover the damages or equitable relief prescribed in paragraph (1)
may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any
Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction . . . .
29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2).2 To be sure, the Fifth Circuit, in Nero v. Industrial Molding Corp., 167
F.3d 921 (5th Cir. 1999), explained that “[t]he legislative history of the FMLA reveals that
Congress intended the remedial provisions of the FMLA to mirror those in the FLSA.” Id. at 928
(citing S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 35 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 37 (“[The FMLA’s]
enforcement scheme is modeled on the enforcement scheme of the FLSA.”)). Moreover, the
Supreme Court’s position has since been applied in at least one district court in the Fifth Circuit.
See Conine v. Universal Oil Prod. Co., No. 05-2011, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14589 (W.D. La.
2006) (denying motion to remand FMLA claim in light of holding in Bruer) (attached hereto as
Exhibit A). As such, Defendant’s removal of Plaintiff’s lawsuit to this Court, after the addition
of the FMLA claim, is proper.
Plaintiff, in her Motion, offers a flurry of alternative suggestions about the impropriety of
Defendant’s removal.3 Plaintiff, at one point, suggests Defendant removed the case to federal
court in “an attempt to manipulate discovery” served earlier that week. Notwithstanding the lack
of any relevance to her remand argument, what Plaintiff fails to point out is that immediately
after the removal, counsel for both parties agreed to extend the deadline for responding to all
discovery until after the Parties’ Rule 26(f) conference, consistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d). See
2

The language in the FLSA, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, is nearly identical:
An action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences may be
maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of
competent jurisdiction . . . .

29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
3

Plaintiff’s Motion makes reference to Plaintiff’s right to a speedy trial. However, such a right is guaranteed to
criminal defendants, not civil plaintiffs. See U.S. CONST. amend. VI (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall
enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial . . . .”); see also TEX. CONST. art. I, sec. 10.

Exhibit B, attached hereto.
Plaintiff also suggests Defendant did not comply with Local Rule 81 by attaching a
Motion to Substitute Counsel,4 or her Demand for Jury Trial.5 Local Rule 81 provides that only
certain documents should be filed with the removal:
Notice for removal shall have attached only the following documents:
1.
2.

3.
4.
5.
6.

All executed process in the case;
Pleadings asserting causes of action, e.g., petitions, counterclaims, crossactions, third-party actions, interventions and all answers to such
pleadings;
All orders signed by the state judge;
The docket sheet;
An index of matters being filed; and
A list of all counsel of record, including addresses, telephone numbers and
parties represented.

S. D. Tex. R. 81 (emphasis added). Neither Plaintiff’s Motion to Substitute Counsel nor her Jury
Demand fall within the list of required documents.
Finally, Plaintiff suggests, by making an unusual reference to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(e)(6),6
that Defendant’s conduct is impermissible forum-shopping. Instead, § 1441 expressly permits
the defendant to choose a federal forum if a plaintiff chooses to bring a claim that arises under
the “Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b).
In sum, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the language—“may be maintained”—
does not prohibit an otherwise appropriate removal of a federal claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1441. Because the relevant language in the FLSA and the FMLA are identical, and because the
4

Defendant has no objection to the Motion to Substitute. Unfortunately, Plaintiff never conferred with Defendant to
discuss any potential opposition.

5

Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff’s state court demand for a jury, at least with regard to her TCHRA claim,
is sufficient to trigger her right to a jury in federal court.

6

28 U.S.C. §1441(e)(6) has nothing to do with forum shopping; instead, the section relates to removal of actions
which relates to multiparty, multiforum jurisdiction wherein at least 75 natural persons died in an accident, and
simply permits federal courts to transfer or dismiss actions because the forum is inconvenient. See 28 U.S.C. §§
1441.

enforcement provisions of the FMLA are intended to mirror the FLSA, Defendant’s timely
removal of the FMLA claim after Plaintiff added the claim is proper, and Plaintiff’s Motion to
Remand should be denied.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P.
prays that the Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand, and grant it such other relief to which it
is justly entitled.
