PETITIONER ELIZABETH A. GILMORE'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO REMAND ACTION TO TEXAS STATE COURT

 

Petitioner, Elizabeth A. Gilmore, respectfully submits this memorandum of law in support of
her motion to remand this lawsuit to the District Court of Harris County, Texas.

Respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Texas, Houston Division, on December 5, 2006, alleging a federal question under 29 U.S.C. Section
2601 and 28 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1331, 1441, and 1446.

Petitioner thereafter filed a motion to remand this action to the 1510x00B0 Judicial District Court of
Harris County, Texas, because there is no federal question presented by this lawsuit to support

federal jurisdiction. This memorandum is offered in support of Petitioner's motion to remand.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Federal Question Jurisdiction

This action is brought as a result of Respondent's violations of the Texas Commission on
Human Rights Act, Texas Labor Code, 0x00A70x00A7 21.051, 21.125(a), 21.128(a), and 21.2585(a) -Texas'
codification of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("CADA")-and of the Family and Medical Leave
Act of 1993 ("FMLA") for wrongful discrimination/discharge.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES

Respondent asserts that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
0x00A70x00A7 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), 1441, and 1446.

This lawsuit was originally filed by Petitioner in the 151% Judicial District Court of Harris
County, Texas, on May 19, 2006, seeking back pay; interest on back pay; cost of health insurance;
compensatory damages, including but not limited to, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience,
mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and other non-pecuniary losses; pre-judgment interest;
punitive damages; court costs; reasonable attorney's fees; and reasonable expert fees from
Respondent, Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., for violation of the ADA.

Petitioner amended her original petition on November 17, 2006, seeking wages, salary,
employment benefits, and other compensation denied and lost to Petitioner; interest on wages, salary,
employment benefits, and other compensation denied and lost to Petitioner; equitable relief;
reasonable attorney's fees and reasonable expert witness fees; and other costs associated with this
action from Respondent, Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., for violation of the FMLA for wrongful

discrimination/discharge.
Case 4:06-cv-03849 Document6 Filed 12/18/2006. Page 3 of 19

The Docket Control Order for this case was generated on July 13, 2006, by the 151% Judicial
District Court and signed by Judge Caroline E. Baker on July 20, 2006.

Petitioner's deposition was taken on September 21, 2006.

Petitioner filed in state court a Demand for Jury Trial on October 26, 2006 (and paid the
requisite jury fee to the Harris County District Court Clerk on October 26, 2006), which was
conspicuously not included on Respondent's Index of Matters Being Filed as required by Local
Rule 81. A copy of the Demand for Jury Trial and the fee receipt are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

A significant amount of discovery has been completed in the state court case. Respondent's
Responses to Petitioner's Rule 194 Disclosures were served September 5, 2006; Petitioner's
Objections and Answers and Responses to Respondent's First Set of Interrogatories, First Requests
for Production and Request for Rule 194 Disclosures were served September 18, 2006; Respondent's
Objections and Responses to Petitioner's First Request for Production were served September 18,
2006; and Respondent's Answers and Objections to Petitioner's Interrogatories One through Twenty-
Three were served October 5, 2006.

Petitioner filed a Motion to Substitute Counsel in state court on December 4, 2006, together
with a Notice of Submission setting the motion for 8:00 a.m. on December 18, 2006, and a proposed
Order Granting the Motion to Substitute Counsel which were pending in the 1510x00B0 Judicial District
Court of Harris County, Texas. Respondent conspicuously omitted the substitution motion,
submission notice, and proposed order on Respondent's Index of Matters Being Filed, again, in
violation of Local Rule 81. Copies of the Motion to Substitute Counsel, the Notice of Submission

setting the motion for 8:00 a.m. on December 18, 2006, and the proposed Order Granting the Motion
Case 4:06-cv-03849 Document6 Filed 12/18/2006 Page 4 of 19

to Substitute Counsel filed in state court December 4, 2006, one day before Respondent removed this
case to federal court, are attached hereto as Exhibit B.

Simultaneously with the filing of her Motion to Substitute Counsel on December 4, 2006,
Petitioner propounded her Second Requests for Production and First Requests for Admissions on
Respondent, and one day later, on December 5, 2006, despite the fact that Petitioner amended her
original petition and served it on Respondent on November 17, 2006, Respondent then, and only
then, removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas,
Houston Division. Respondent had ample opportunity after November 17, 2006, to remove this case
to federal court but in an attempt to manipulate discovery chose to remove this case to delay
responding to Petitioner's December 4, 2006 discovery requests.

Additionally, United States District Court Judge Gray Miller is a lawyer formerly employed
by Respondent, and United States District Court Judge Sim Lake is also a lawyer formerly employed
by Respondent. Possibly other lawyers formerly employed by Respondent are sitting federal judges
in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, thereby creating delay and conflicts of
Petitioner's interests. This amounts to nothing more than forum non conveniens or forum shopping--
picking a jurisdiction merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1441(e)(6).
Each recusal and/or reassignment not only further delays Petitioner's case and denies Petitioner her
right to a speedy trial but burdens the already overburdened federal district court system.

Petitioner's allegations in this lawsuit arise solely from Respondent's violations of the ADA
and of the FMLA. Respondent removed this case based on Petitioner's November 17, 2006

amendment of her original petition wherein Petitioner pled wrongful discrimination/discharge under
Case 4:06-cv-03849 Document6 Filed 12/18/2006 Page 5of 19

the FMLA. The FMLA specifically states that the state court action is allowed, appropriate, and
expressly authorized:
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993:
SECTION 107. ENFORCEMENT.
(2) RIGHT OF ACTION-An action to recover the damages or equitable relief
prescribed in paragraph (1) may be maintained against any employer (including a public
agent) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees

for and in behalf of-

(A) _ the employees; or
(B) _ the employees and other employees similarly situated. . . .

Section 107(2) of the FMLA specifically provides that "[a]n action to recover . . . may be maintained
against any employer . . . in any [fJederal or [s]tate court of competent jurisdiction . . . ." (emphasis
supplied) There is, therefore, no reason for this case to be removed to federal court which would
undermine the comity and the facilitation of the litigation in this case and essentially defeat
Congress' express legislative codification of Section 107(2) of the FMLA. Section 107(2) makes
clear Petitioner's right to maintain her case in state court. Permitting Petitioner's case to be removed
to federal court undermines the very intent of Section 107(2) of the FMLA which could not be more
specific.

Contrary to Respondent's assertions under and reliance on 29 U.S.C. Section 2601 and
28 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1331, 1441, and 1446-which general laws were enacted long before the 1993
enactment of the FMLA-Petitioner's interests and claims, for the reasons set forth above, would be
better and more expeditiously served in state court. Respondent, in seeking removal to federal
court, has the burden of proving the existence of federal jurisdiction. See e.g. BIW Deceived v. Local

S6, 132 F.3d 824, 831 (1* Cir. 1997). The language of Section 107(2) of the FMLA specifically

-5-
Case 4:06-cv-03849 Document6 Filed 12/18/2006 Page6of 19

disproves the general language asserted and relied upon by Respondent in removing this case to
federal court. Failure to remand this case to state court would undermine the very intent of
Section 107(2). The federal courts are already overburdened; thus, Petitioner's interests would be
better and more expeditiously served in state court, a court system less overburdened than the federal
court system. More importantly, a removal statute should be strictly construed, and any doubt should
be resolved against removal. See e.g. Therrien v. Hamilton, 881 F.Supp. 76, 78 (D. Mass. 1995).

Respondent has failed to meet this burden.
