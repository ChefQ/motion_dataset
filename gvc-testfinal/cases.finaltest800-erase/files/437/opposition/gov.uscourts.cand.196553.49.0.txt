ARGUMENT

1

The sole issue before the Court is which of the three individuals who have moved to be

2
3

appointed lead plaintiff in this consolidated securities class action should be appointed lead

4

plaintiff.1 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) establishes a relatively simple

5

mechanism for appointing the lead plaintiff and, “[i]n the Ninth Circuit, courts must apply the

6

statute in a strictly regimented manner.” In re Leapfrog Enter., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. C-03-05421,

7

2005 WL 3801587, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 23, 2005). The PSLRA provides that the lead plaintiff

8

movant with the largest losses from the fraud that is the subject of the litigation must be

9

appointed lead plaintiff, unless the movant clearly fails to meet the undemanding “adequacy”

10

and “typicality” requirements for a class representative set forth in Rule 23(a) of the Federal

11

Rules of Civil Procedure. “So long as the plaintiff with the largest losses satisfies the typicality

12

and adequacy requirements, he is entitled to lead plaintiff status, even if the district court is

13

convinced that some other plaintiff would do a better job.” In re Cavanaugh, 306 F.3d 726, 732

14

(9th Cir. 2002). Since Mr. Javidzad’s nearly $1.5 million in losses is, by far, the largest loss of

15

any movant, and since he meets the requirements of Rule 23, he should be appointed lead

16

plaintiff.

17

I.

As the Ninth Circuit has emphasized, the procedure for appointing a lead plaintiff is

18
19

Mr. Javidzad Is The Presumptive Lead Plaintiff

clear:

20

the district court must compare the financial stakes of the various
plaintiffs and determine which one has the most to gain from the
lawsuit. It must then focus its attention on that plaintiff and
determine, based on the information he has provided in his
pleadings and declarations, whether he satisfies the requirements
of Rule 23(a), in particular those of “typicality” and “adequacy.”
If the plaintiff with the largest financial stake in the controversy
provides information that satisfies these requirements, he becomes
the presumptively most adequate plaintiff.

2

A. Mr. Javidzad Has The Most To Gain From This Lawsuit
3

Mr. Javidzad has the largest loss of the three lead plaintiff movants and, consequently, he
4

has the “most to gain from the lawsuit.” His losses of $1,499,5993 are more than 25 times

5

greater than the $58,066 in losses claimed by Movant Frans Veldman, the movant with the next
6

highest amount of losses.4 Veldman Mem. at 1. The third movant, Allan Candelore, claims only

7

$36,867 in losses. Candelore Mem. at 1. Even setting aside Mr. Javidzad’s substantial losses
8

from his options transactions, which were caused by the drop in the price of LDK stock
9

following the disclosure of misconduct at LDK, Mr. Javidzad’s $1,241,221 in losses from his
10

purchases of LDK common stock during the class period is over $1 million more than the
11

claimed losses of Veldman and Candelore combined.
12
13

B. Mr. Javidzad Has Established A Prima Facie Case That He Meets The Requirements
Of Rule 23

14

Mr. Javidzad’s filings also establish that he meets the two prerequisites that Rule 23(a)

15

requires of class representatives—“typicality” and “adequacy.”5 The tests for typicality and

The two other lead plaintiff movants agree with Mr. Javidzad on the applicable law.
See Mem. In Supt. of Mot. of Allan Candelore, Nov. 21, 2007 (docket no. 20) (“Candelore
Mem.”) at 4 (quoting PSLRA) (presumptive lead plaintiff is movant with the “largest financial
interest in the relief sought by the class” who “satisfies the requirements of rule 23”); Mem. In
Supt. of Mot. of Frans Veldman, Dec. 10, 2007 (docket no. 40). (“Veldman Mem.”) at 6 (same).
3

Mr. Javidzad’s losses are set forth in detail in Exhibit B to the Declaration of Matthew
B. Kaplan, Dec. 10, 2007 (docket no. 38-2) (“Kaplan Decl.”), which was filed with Mr.
Javidzad’s lead plaintiff motion.
4

On the same day it filed Veldman’s lead plaintiff motion in this case, his proposed lead
counsel, Murray, Frank & Sailer LLP, filed a lead plaintiff motion in three securities class
actions brought against LDK in the Southern District of New York on behalf of another movant,
Weichen G. Lui, who claims losses of “approximately $54,300.” Mem. Of Law in Supt. of Mot.
of Weichen G. Lui, Dec. 10, 2007 at 1, filed in Tsang v. LDK Solar Co., No. 07-CV-8706; Lui v.
LDK Solar Co., No. 07-CV-8766; and Halidou v. LDK Solar Co., No. 07-CV-9745 (all
S.D.N.Y.). These cases allege essentially the same misconduct as the complaints in this case.
5

The other two class action prerequisites set out in Rule 23(a), “numerosity” and
“commonality,” are not relevant in deciding PSLRA lead plaintiff motions because they are not
related to the personal characteristics of a proposed class representative. See Cavanaugh, 306
F.3d at 730 & n.5.

1

adequacy are not demanding. Moreover, when appointing a lead plaintiff in a securities class

2

action “[a] wide ranging analysis is not appropriate to determine whether [the presumptive lead

3

plaintiff] has made a prima facie showing that he satisfies the requirements of Rule 23” and such

4

an analysis “should be left for consideration on a motion for class certification.” Tanne v.

5

Autobytel, Inc., 226 F.R.D. 659, 666 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (internal quotations omitted).

6

Typicality exists if the harm suffered by the representative “stems from the same event,

7

practice, or course of conduct that forms the basis of the class claims and is based on the same

8

legal or remedial theory.” Weisz v. Calpine Corp., No. 4:02-CV-1200, 2002 WL 32818827, at

9

*8 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2002) (citation omitted). “Under Rule 23’s permissive standards,

10

representative claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class

11

members; they need not be substantially identical. Typicality thus entails an inquiry whether the

12

named plaintiff’s individual circumstances are markedly different or ... the legal theory upon

13

which the claims are based differs from … the claims of other class members.” Tanne, 226

14

F.R.D. at 667 (citing Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998) & Takeda v.

15

Turbodyne Techs., Inc., 67 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1136-37 (C.D. Cal. 1999)) (internal quotations and

16

brackets omitted).

17

Like all other members of the proposed class, Mr. Javidzad purchased LDK securities

18

during the class period and suffered a loss when misconduct at LDK was revealed, causing the

19

company’s stock price to drop. His claim is typical of the claims of other class members.

20

Adequacy exists where “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the

21

interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). “The Ninth Circuit has held that representation is

22

‘adequate’ when counsel for the class is qualified and competent, the representative’s interests

23

are not antagonistic to the interests of absent class members, and it is unlikely that the action is

24

collusive.” Weisz, 2002 WL 32818827, at *9 (quoting Takeda, 67 F. Supp. 2d at 1137, which

25

cited In re N. D. Cal., Dalkon Shield IUD Prod. Liab. Litig., 693 F.2d 847, 855 (9th Cir. 1982)).

26

Mr. Javidzad’s interests are aligned with the interests of the other class members, this is

27

clearly not a collusive action, and Mr. Javidzad has chosen qualified, and experienced counsel.6

28

6

The Court has deferred approval of class counsel.

Consequently, in addition to meeting the typicality requirement, Mr. Javidzad is an adequate

2

representative of the class.

3

II.

The Presumption That Mr. Javidzad Should Be Appointed Lead Plaintiff Has Not
Been Rebutted

4

A lead plaintiff movant who, like Mr. Javidzad, has the largest losses of any movant and
5

has made a prima facie showing that he meets Rule 23’s requirements, is presumptively the lead
6

plaintiff and must be appointed lead plaintiff unless another movant comes forward with
7

evidence that compels the court to reject “the lead plaintiff’s prima facie showing of typicality
8

and adequacy.” Cavanaugh, 306 F.3d at 730. The PSLRA provides that a court may deny the
9

lead plaintiff motion of the presumptive lead plaintiff
10
11
12
13
14
15

only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that
the presumptively most adequate plaintiff—
(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of
the class; or
(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff
incapable of adequately representing the class.
15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii) (emphasis added).
No movant has come forward—or will be able to come forward—with “proof” that Mr.

16

Javidzad is an atypical or inadequate class representative. Mr. Javidzad has indicated that he

17

will represent the class fairly and his enormous financial stake in this case gives him a strong

18

incentive to seek the largest possible recovery. Moreover, he will actively participate in the

19

conduct of this litigation and, as a businessman and experienced investor, he can do so

20

effectively. See Mr. Javidzad’s completed Court Questionnaire to Lead Plaintiff Candidates,

21

Kaplan Decl. Ex. A. at 3-5 (docket no. 9-2) (on Mr. Javidzad’s qualifications to supervise

22

litigation). Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that Mr. Javidzad is subject to any unique

23

defenses, let alone a defense that might make him “incapable” of representing the class.

24
25

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court should appoint Mr. Javidzad as lead plaintiff.
