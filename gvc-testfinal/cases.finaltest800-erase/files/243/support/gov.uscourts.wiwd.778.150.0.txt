HYPERPHRASE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC v. GOOGLE INC.

Doc. 150

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
HYPERPHRASE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC and
HYPERPHRASE INC.,
Plaintiffs,
v.

Civil Action No. 06 C 0199 bbc

GOOGLE INC.,
Defendant.
GOOGLE'S MOTION
TO FIND THIS CASE EXCEPTIONAL PURSUANT TO 35 U.S.C. § 285 AND
TO AWARD POST-REMAND ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2) Google Inc. (“Google”) respectfully submits this
motion seeking its attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred since the remand of this case after
appeal. As explained more fully in the supporting memorandum filed with this motion, the
Court should deem this case exceptional because of litigation conduct by Hyperphrase
Technologies, LLC and Hyperphrase, Inc. (“Hyperphrase”) and its attorneys. Since remand,
Hyperphrase has unreasonably prolonged and complicated this action, causing Google to incur
significant additional expense when the case should have been wrapped up expeditiously after
remand. For the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, Google respectfully
submits that this case is exceptional and that Google is entitled to an award of fees pursuant to 35
U.S.C. § 285.
