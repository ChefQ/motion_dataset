I.

INTRODUCTION
Virtually ignoring the December 26, 2007 holding of the Federal Circuit that

disputed issues of fact remained for decision, Google begins by adopting the slang of a
Las Vegas casino to unleash a torrent of invective, complaining that HyperPhrase
“doubled down” instead of “cutting its losses” (Google Br. 1).

Google accuses

HyperPhrase of “ignor[ing] the facts and law and charg[ing] ahead fully understanding
the insurmountable hurdles it faced” and “multiplying the burdens on both Google and
the Court” (Google Br. 1) At the same time, according to Google, HyperPhrase was
“engag[ing] in a pattern of obfuscation and delay” (Id.). Despite the December 26, 2007
decision of the Federal Circuit finding that material issues of fact existed concerning
infringement under the Federal Circuit’s claim construction, according to Google, “noninfringement was clear” (Google Br. 11).

HyperPhrase’s “true desire [according to

Google] was to ‘get to the jury at all costs’ by unduly, unnecessarily, and unreasonably
complicating the record and issues that the Court had to address on summary judgment”
(Br. 13).
Google’s attorney argument falls far short of clear and convincing evidence that
HyperPhrase’s infringement claims under the ‘889 and ‘321 patents were “objectively
baseless,” or that HyperPhrase somehow “engaged in a pattern of obfuscation and delay”
while simultaneously “charg[ing] fully ahead” – a neat trick in itself. As shown below,
Google’s assertion that “non-infringement was clear” despite the Federal Circuit’s
rejection of Google’s proffered claim interpretation is belied by Google’s own actions
following the Federal Circuit’s decision.

And Google’s litany of complaints about

alleged vexatious litigation conduct are premised not on what this Court actually held in
1

its 31-page summary judgment decision on September 30, 2008 (Document 141, Exhibit
1), but rather on Google’s ideas of what this Court should have decided – rulings this
Court never made.
II.

THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT’S DECISION
AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS IN THIS COURT
Google denigrates the Federal Circuit’s December 26, 2007 decision which began

this new round of litigation as “far from a victory for HyperPhrase” (Google Br. 2).
Indeed, to read HyperPhrase’s brief, one would think that the Federal Circuit’s decision
was a triumph for Google, after which nothing remained for HyperPhrase but to “cut its
losses,” in Google’s phrase, and give up. That is not so.
A.

The Federal Circuit Decided Only One Issue Of Claim Construction

In fact, the Federal Circuit considered only one claim term definition.
HyperPhrase Technologies, LLC v. Google, Inc., 260 Fed. Appx. 274, 278, 2007 U.S.
App. LEXIS 29796, *10 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (unpublished). After extensive analysis, the
Federal Circuit rejected Google’s proffered claim interpretation (which was the same as
this Court’s initial interpretation). 260 Fed. Appx. at 280, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796
at *15. The Federal Circuit went on to devise its own claim interpretation, different from
those suggested by either party. Id. Turning to the issue of infringement, the Federal
Circuit held that “the district court erred in its infringement analysis by finding that
AutoLink does not use data references ...” 260 Fed. Appx. at 281, 2007 U.S. App.
LEXIS 29796 at *17. “Since tokens may refer to multiple possible records but still be
‘data references’ under the correct claim construction, [the district court’s] error is not
harmless.” 260 Fed. Appx. at 281, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796 at *18.
2

B.

The Federal Circuit Did Not Decide The
Fact Issues Of Infringement Of The ‘889 And ‘321 Patents

Turning to the issue of infringement, the Federal Circuit next rejected Google’s
non-infringement argument that its tokens could not be “data references,” holding instead
that AutoLink “tokens are ‘data references’ within the meaning of the asserted claims.”
260 Fed. Appx. at 281, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796 at *19 (emphasis in original). The
Federal Circuit then remanded the case to this Court with the following instruction:
[T]he issue of whether AutoLink infringes the asserted claims of the ‘889
and ‘321 patents must be remanded to the district court. It is unclear from
the record on appeal whether AutoLink meets all of the remaining
elements of any of the asserted claims of these patents because the “data
reference” limitation was the only limitation that the district court
discussed in its infringement analysis and the only limitation discussed in
detail in the parties’ briefing on appeal. We thus cannot determine if
AutoLink does not infringe because it does not meet other limitations of
the claims. Therefore, we must remand so the district court can evaluate
whether AutoLink infringes the asserted claims of the ‘889 and ‘321
patents under the correct claim construction of “data reference.”
260 Fed. Appx. at 281, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796 at *19 (emphasis added).
C.

After Remand, Google Asserted A Four-Year-Old
“License” Defense And Eight Claim Interpretation Issues

Faced with the Federal Circuit’s ruling that “tokens are ‘data references’ within
the meaning of the asserted claims” and evidently alarmed by the Federal Circuit’s
rejection of its non-infringement argument based on the alleged absence of “data
references,” after remand Google first moved this Court to amend its answer and
counterclaims to add a “license” defense based on a license granted more than four years
earlier by Google to Microsoft. Although not asserted until Google’s February 27, 2008
motion to amend its answer and counterclaims (Document 98), this defense was nothing
new to Google’s counsel. In fact, Google’s own attorneys in this case, Frank
3

Scherkenbach and Kurt Glitzenstein of Fish & Richardson, were the attorneys who
negotiated the license on behalf of Microsoft (Exhibit 2 – letters, December 18 and 29,
2003). HyperPhrase opposed the motion, arguing that the belated appearance of such a
new defense would be prejudicial. This Court held: “Plaintiffs’ argument [opposing
amendment] would be compelling were it not for the fact that the trial date has been
continued until March 16, 2009” (3/25/08 Order, p. 2, Document 118, Exhibit 3)
(emphasis added). Thus, Google’s license defense was rescued from being untimely only
by this Court’s rescheduling of discovery and trial.
Apparently not sure that its “license” defense would be permitted in this case, at
the end of February 2008 (a month before this Court permitted addition of the “license”
defense on March 25, 2008), Google filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement, supported by a 42 page long opening brief, a 34 page long reply brief, and
932 pages of declarations and other materials, including a list of 199 allegedly
“uncontested” facts (Documents 100, 102, 103, 106, 107, 108, 136, 137 and 138).
Google’s non-infringement motion did not argue that the Federal Circuit’s definition of
“data reference” required a holding of non-infringement. Indeed, the Federal Circuit had
already rejected that argument of Google when it held that “tokens are ‘data references’
within the meaning of the asserted claims.” 260 Fed. Appx. at 281, 2007 U.S. App.
LEXIS 29796 at *19 (emphasis in original).

Instead, Google proffered eight claim

construction arguments in its February 29, 2008 motion for summary judgment of noninfringement. Those arguments were as follows:
(1)

“standardized format for addressing” requires “a computer system with a number
of records, on a number of databases, and a standard way to format the addresses
4

of those records in the databases” (Google’s non-infringement brief, pp. 8-10,
Document 103).
(2)

the “address” being “the address of the referenced record” (Id. pp. 11-12).

(3)

“modifying said references to said second data record to create an address”
requires “that the first data record be modified to create the address of the second,
referenced record” (Google’s reply non-infringement brief, pp. 10-12, Document
136).

(4)

“first data record” refers to “one of the plurality of data records stored in the
plurality of databases” and not “some other data record” (Google’s noninfringement brief, pp. 12-15, Document 103).

(5)

“modifier reference” means “a word or phrase that further specifies a specific
record or record segment” (Id. pp. 16-17).

(6)

the term “when” is a limitation that “requires real-time processing and precludes
user intervention” (Id. pp. 18-25).

(7)

“subject matter tag pair” means “two matching tags, each identifying a specific
subject matter”(Id. pp. 25-27).

(8)

“specifying reference” means “a combination of a first DR, a second DR, and a
MR, or it is a combination of a DR, a first MR, and second MR” (Id. pp. 27-29).

Critically, Google had not presented any of these eight proposed claim interpretations to
the Federal Circuit in the appeal, even though it had proposed some variations of these
interpretations before the appeal. The December 21, 2006 summary judgment opinion of
this Court (Document 64) which led to the appeal did not decide any of the eight

5

proposed interpretations, but instead was premised on the definition of “data reference,”
leading to the holding the Federal Circuit vacated on appeal.1.
D.

This Court Found Non-Infringement Based
On Five New Claim Construction Holdings

Following the appeal, this Court on September 30, 2008 found non-infringement
based on five new claim construction holdings defining the following claim terms:
(1)

“standardized format for addressing” (9/30/08 Order, pp. 13-16, Document 141,
Exhibit 1).

(2)

“means for modifying said reference to said second data record to create an
address” (Id. pp. 16-18).

(3)

“said address being operable to retrieve said second data record” (Id. pp. 18-22).

(4)

“modifier reference” (Id. pp. 23-27)

(5)

“seemingly general SR is modified by other record information which renders the
SR relatively specific” (Id. pp. 27-30).

These holdings were based on variants of Google’s claim interpretation arguments
(though this Court did not accept all of Google’s arguments wholesale. See, e.g., 9/30/08
Order, p. 27, Document 141, Exhibit 1: “The first premise of [Google’s] argument is
erroneous.”).

1

The Federal Circuit held: “We here only review the district court’s
construction of the term ‘data reference.’ The parties do not raise on appeal any other
claim construction issue ...” 260 Fed. Appx. at 279, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796 at
*10.
6

E.

This Court Did Not Rule On Any Issues
Relating To Invalidity, Prior Art, Willful Infringement
Or The Viability Of Google’s Newly-Asserted “License” Defense

Having held that Google’s AutoLink does not infringe the ‘889 and ‘321 patents
because of the absence of the five specific claim elements listed directly above (9/30/08
Order, pp. 13-30, Document 141, Exhibit 1), this Court did not rule on any of the
following motions and arguments made by Google:
(1)

Google’s invalidity contentions and its arguments about prior art.

(2)

Google’s argument that it is protected by HyperPhrase’s license to Microsoft.

(3)

Google’s assertion that “a license would have reduced HyperPhrase’s damages
claims by at least 90%” (Google Br. p. 5 n.2).

(4)

HyperPhrase’s argument that Google’s “license” argument is outside the mandate
from the Federal Circuit.2

(5)

Google’s argument that there could be no “willful infringement” because of the
decision in In re Seagate Technologies, LLC, 497 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007).3

Although Google’s attorney fee brief treats the foregoing issues as though this Court had
decided them adversely to HyperPhrase, that is not so.

2

This Court’s March 25, 2008 Order permitting Google to amend its
answer to add a “license” defense deals only with HyperPhrase’s argument that belated
addition of that defense would be prejudicial (3/25/08 Order, Document 118, Exhibit 3).
It says nothing whatever about the scope of the Federal Circuit’s mandate. This Court’s
only ruling concerning the scope of the mandate was that Google’s non-infringement
arguments were within the scope of the mandate (9/30/08 Opinion, p. 11, Document 141,
Exhibit 1).
3

Since this Court ruled there is no infringement based on the five new
claim term definitions in this Court’s September 30, 2008 Order, as matters now stand
there can be no “willful” infringement regardless of In re Seagate.
7

III.

TITLE 35 U.S.C. § 285 REQUIRES
“CLEAR AND CONVINCING” PROOF, NOT SPECULATION
Under 35 U.S.C. § 285 (the only statutory basis for attorney fees asserted by

Google), “exceptional” means something that is so far different than the norm that it
evidences bad faith or willful, wanton and reckless misconduct. “There is a presumption
that the assertion of infringement of a duly granted patent is made in good faith. Thus,
the underlying improper conduct and the characterization of the case as exceptional must
be established by clear and convincing evidence.” Brooks Furniture Mfg. Inc. v. Dutalier
International, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). And “an
exceptional case finding is not to be based on speculation or conjecture but upon clear
and convincing evidence.” Stephens v. Tech International, 393 F.3d 1269, 1276 (Fed.
Cir. 2004) (emphasis added; reversing district court’s “exceptional case” holding).
“When the accused infringer prevails in the underlying action, factors relevant to
the inquiry include the closeness of the question, pre-filing investigation and discussions
with the defendant, and litigation behavior.” Computer Docking Station Corp. v. Dell,
Inc., 519 F.3d 1366, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Here, Google does not challenge the

adequacy of HyperPhrase’s prefiling investigation – indeed, it could not, inasmuch as
this Court denied Google’s initial attempt to obtain attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. §285
(Order, 2/15/07, Document No. 80, Exhibit 4).

Instead, Google complains about

“litigation behavior” – but its gripes are predicated, for the most part, on speculation
about what it wishes this Court had decided, rather than what this Court actually did.
And Google’s assertion that “non-infringement was clear” (Google Br. 11) is squarely
contradicted by Google’s own actions.
8

IV.

GOOGLE’S OWN ACTIONS BELIE ITS
HINDSIGHT ARGUMENT THAT “NON-INFRINGEMENT
WAS CLEAR” AFTER THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT’S DECISION
Google now insists that after the Federal Circuit’s decision, “non-infringement

was clear” because “HyperPhrase had no good faith infringement position” (Google Br.
1). But, any such conclusion is belied by Google’s own actions.
After the decision of the Federal Circuit rejecting Google’s proffered
interpretation of the claim term “data reference” and remanding the case “so the district
court can evaluate whether AutoLink infringes the asserted claims of the ‘889 and ‘321
patents under the correct claim construction of ‘data reference’” (260 Fed. Appx. 274,
281, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796, *19), Google asserted for the first time a “license”
defense its counsel had known about for four years. Google also filed a summary
judgment brief including almost a thousand pages of materials that relied on eight claim
interpretation arguments on which no court had yet ruled (see Section II-C, above).
Along with that summary judgment brief, Google also filed another elaborate summary
judgment motion attacking the validity of the asserted claims of the ‘889 and ‘321
patents reflecting what Google now boasts were “scores of prior art references” (Google
Br. 1).

(“Scores of references” hardly expresses what Google actually did; in fact,

Google cited a total of 2,610 prior art references in its August 9, 2006 interrogatory
response alone.)

Google also argued on summary judgment that, if there was

infringement, it was excused by a license granted years ago by HyperPhrase to Microsoft.
If “non-infringement was clear” after the Federal Circuit’s decision, as Google
now argues (Google Br. 11), there would have been no need for the Federal Circuit to
remand the case for a decision on infringement at all. Google would not have needed to
9

proffer for the first time a “license” defense its counsel had known about for years. Nor
would there have been any need for Google to press eight claim construction arguments
relating to various other claim terms after the Federal Circuit’s decision.

Google’s

motion for summary judgment of invalidity, which invoked a selection of what it now
calls “scores of prior art references” (actually 2,610 such references), and which involved
1,014 pages of argument and supporting materials, would have been equally unnecessary.
The only reasonable conclusion is that Google itself was far from certain, after the
Federal Circuit’s rejection of Google’s proffered interpretation of the ‘889 and ‘321
patent claims, that “non-infringement was clear,” as it now insists.
Maybe non-infringement is now clear, after this Court’s September 30, 2008 31page summary judgment decision finding non-infringement on the basis of new
interpretations of five other terms of the patent claims (Document 141, Exhibit 1).
Surely it was not clear before then; if non-infringement was a foregone conclusion there
would have been no need for this Court to write a 31-page Opinion interpreting not just
one, but five claim terms for the first time on September 30, 2008, and then applying
those definitions to find non-infringement.
Google’s own actions testify far more clearly than the words of its attorney fee
motion that non-infringement was very far from “clear” to Google before that summary
judgment decision. How could non-infringement have been “clear,” to use Google’s
word, before this Court’s decision interpreting for the first time five additional claim
terms?
The fact is that claim interpretation is notoriously difficult and unpredictable:
even judges of the Federal Circuit frequently disagree on the proper interpretation of
10

patent claims.

As a result, in patent infringement cases disposed of on summary

judgment, the rate of reversal of district court claim interpretations is high. During the
period between January 1, 1998 through April 30, 2000, “the Federal Circuit has changed
the lower court’s claim construction in 51% of summary judgment cases involving an
express review of claim construction.” Christian Chu, “Empirical Analysis of the Federal
Circuit’s Claim Construction Trends,” 16 Berkeley Technology L.J. 1075, 1112, 1131-33
(2001); see also, Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies, Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1475-76 (Fed.
Cir. 1998) (“[O]ne study shows that the plenary standard of review has produced
reversal, in whole or in part, of almost 40% of all claim constructions since Markman I.
... [T]his reversal rate, hovering near 50%, is the worst possible.”) (Rader, J., dissenting;
emphasis added). To award attorney fees based on assertion of an erroneous claim
construction subsequently rejected by a district court would be unjust in light of the
unpredictability of the interpretation process, because it would be an improper exercise of
hindsight in the face of substantial uncertainty.
As this Court held recently in denying a motion under 35 U.S.C. § 285 for
attorney fees:
In hindsight, plaintiff’s contention that laptop computers could infringe
the claims of the ‘645 patent seems more the product of wishful thinking
than a fully considered decision. However, hindsight is not the vantage
point from which to evaluate the legitimacy of a particular litigation
strategy. Although it seems plain now that the ‘645 patent does not cover
the accused laptop devices in light of plaintiff’s representations in the
patent itself and its statements to the patent office during the application
process, it did not seem self-evident at the beginning of the claim
construction analysis.
Computer Docking Station Corp. v. Dell, Inc., 547 F.Supp.2d 948, 953 (W.D. Wis. 2007)
(emphasis added), aff’d, 519 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008). See also, Vehicle IP, LLC v.
11

General Motors Corp., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43426, *9-*10 (W.D. Wis. June 2, 2008)
(“Defendants’ exceptional case contention is based entirely on the hindsight adoption of
this court’ s construction of the ‘743 patent. More than this is required to prove by clear
and convincing evidence that plaintiff pursued this litigation in bad faith.”).

This

principle is even more apparent in this case, where the Federal Circuit had just changed
the only claim construction definition it reviewed, substituting its own definition for the
definition this Court initially established.
V.

GOOGLE’S ALLEGATIONS OF
“OBFUSCATION AND DELAY” ARE UNFOUNDED
Conspicuously absent from Google’s fuming about “obfuscation and delay”

(Google Br. 1) is any discussion or even acknowledgment of the actual bases on which
this Court entered summary judgment of non-infringement. On September 30, 2008, this
Court’s 31-page summary judgment Opinion and Order (Document No. 141, Exhibit 1)
dismissed HyperPhrase’s complaint for infringement of the ‘889 and ‘321 patents. Most
of that Opinion – which Google did not attach to its brief seeking attorney fees – was
devoted to a series of five new legal rulings on clam construction (discussed in Section
II-D, above), which were made in response to eight claim interpretation arguments never
before decided by any court (see Section II-C, above).

Google made these eight

arguments to this Court because they dealt with issues the Federal Circuit did not resolve
in its December 26, 2007 decision.
Not one of Google’s eight claim construction arguments – variants of which
formed the basis for this Court’s September 30, 2008 summary judgment ruling –
features in its motion asking this Court to find that this case was “exceptional” under 35
12

U.S.C. § 285. Instead, Google now insists that it is entitled to “approximately $500,000”
in attorney fees (Google Br. 14) based on arguments that do not even reflect this Court’s
summary judgment decision.
A.

HyperPhrase Opposed Google’s “License” Defense (Google Br. 5-6)

Although Google attacks HyperPhrase for refusing to agree to the addition of this
defense more than four years after Google’s attorneys knew of the license, Google
ignores this Court’s statement that “Plaintiffs’ argument [opposing amendment] would
be compelling were it not for the fact that the trial date has been continued until March
16, 2009” (3/25/08 Order, p. 2, Document 118, Exhibit 3) (emphasis added). Thus,
Google’s license defense was rescued from being untimely only by the court’s
rescheduling of discovery and trial.
Moreover, the legal viability of Google’s “license” defense was never decided.
After granting Google leave to assert that defense the Court never ruled on Google’s
summary judgment arguments about its alleged “license” in view of the noninfringement decision (see Document 124, Order postponing discovery and briefing
concerning “license” until “the day after the court issues its summary judgment decision
on invalidity and non-infringement,” Exhibit 5). Tellingly, Google itself stipulated that
“as HyperPhrase’s motion notes, there is no need for the Court to reach the license issue
if it finds the two remaining patents either invalid or not infringed.” (Google’s 4/7/08
response to HyperPhrase’s motion for a new schedule for summary judgment on
Google’s license defense, Document 123, p. 1, Exhibit 6). Thus, no determination has
been made as to whether any part of Google’s activities was “licensed” and certainly no
ruling on Google’s assertion (which it presents as though it were settled fact) that the
13

license would have reduced damages by 90% (Google Br. p. 5 n.2) Google’s argument
that the case is “exceptional” because of its “license” defense is based not on any theory
on which Google prevailed, but rather upon one which was never decided. That is far
from “clear and convincing” evidence that this case is exceptional.
B.

HyperPhrase Disputed Google’s
Proposed “Findings Of Fact” (Google Br. 6-8)

Google professes outrage that HyperPhrase dared to contest “nearly all” of
Google’s proposed facts and even had the temerity to present “399 of its own findings”
(Google Br. 7). But, for all its invective, Google cites only one single, solitary proposed
“additional finding of fact” (proposed fact no. 171) which, according to Google, was
objectionable because it supposedly “offered multiple constructions of ‘data reference’
after the Federal Circuit had explicitly construed the term” (Google Br. 7). But, “data
reference” was not one of the eight arguments Google proffered in its February 29, 2008
opening brief seeking summary judgment of non-infringement (See Section II-C, above).
And this Court’s decision does not turn on the definition of “data reference” anyway, but
rather on five other, new claim interpretation holdings (see Section II-D, above). Finally,
Google’s assertion that HyperPhrase’s brief did not cite any additional proposed facts
(Br. 7) is disingenuous: HyperPhrase’s summary judgment response cited extensively
and directly to the factual evidence underlying those findings (through citations to the
Niro, Thompson and de la Huerga declarations and to specific documents) – just as
Google’s summary judgment brief did.

14

C.

HyperPhrase Allegedly “Rewrote”
The Definition Of “Data Reference” (Google Br. 8-11)

Google next accuses HyperPhrase of “muddying the waters on the key ‘data
reference’ claim term” (Google Br. 8). Far from being a “key claim term,” however,
“data reference” is not even among the five claim terms addressed in this Court’s
summary judgment decision (see Section II-D, above). Google’s assertion that it does
not infringe because it supposedly uses a “separate, hidden DOM” or “hidden text”
(Google Br. 9 n.4, 11) was not accepted by this Court; the summary judgment decision
says nothing whatever about “hidden DOM” or “hidden text.”

Google’s argument

magically transmutes “we should have won on this issue” to “we did win on this issue.”
What HyperPhrase did with respect to “data reference” was simply to suggest
applications of the Federal Circuit’s definition to aspects of the infringement dispute in
this case – applications which turned out not to matter, because the Court entered
summary judgment of non-infringement based on other limitations of the patent claims.
There was nothing improper about HyperPhrase’s suggestions. Changes in a party’s
infringement contentions following a claim construction ruling are nothing out of the
ordinary. See, e.g., Becton Dickinson & Co. v. Syntron Bioresearch, Inc., 1998 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 22082, *46 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 1998):
This court notes that there is nothing improper in Becton
Dickinson’s choice to amend the infringement contentions subsequent
to the order construing the patent claims, issued on August 11, 1998.
Becton Dickinson cites Johns Hopkins University v. Cellpro, Inc., 152
F.3d 1342, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1998) as standing for the proposition that after
a court has construed the claims in a patent case, the “rules of the game”
change, thereby allowing for amendment of the arguments in the case. In
Cellpro, the Federal Circuit held that claims that were not argued, or
relevant, prior to claim construction may well become relevant after the
patent claims have been construed. See id. at 1357. After a jury verdict
15

had been rendered for the defendant in Cellpro, the judge construed the
terms of the patent claims and granted a motion for a new trial. The
Federal Circuit ruled that the District Court’s decision to preclude a new
argument at the second trial was error because it did not allow defendant
to respond to the changes in the case brought about by the claim
construction. See id. Further, the Federal Circuit held that even a pre-trial
order did not control what issues could be later argued, or had been
waived by the parties, where the claim construction made new arguments
relevant. See id.
Becton Dickinson, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22082, at *45-*46.
The clincher is that Google did the same thing it now berates HyperPhrase for
doing: Google proposed eight definitions in support of its summary judgment motion
following the Federal Circuit’s December 26, 2007 decision.
D.

HyperPhrase’s Infringement Expert Supposedly
Offered “Multiple Opinions” (Google Br. 11-12)

Google berates HyperPhrase’s expert Dr. Thompson for offering “new theories”
of infringement (Google Br. 11). But, “[l]ike changes in claim construction, changes in
infringement analysis are standard features of patent litigation.”

Ardisam, Inc. v.

Ameristep, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26865, *6 (W.D. Wis. Nov. 3, 2005). Such
changes do not support an “exceptional case” finding. Id. at *6-*7.
According to Google, even though “non-infringement was clear” (at least in
Google’s view), there was inconsistency between Dr. Thompson’s infringement analysis
and Mr. de la Huerga’s invalidity analysis on the subject of AutoLink’s alleged
“operat[ion] on the hidden DOM codes” (Google Br. 11-12). Again, however, Google’s
argument reflects not what this Court actually did in granting summary judgment, but
rather what Google thinks it should have done. This Court never reached any issues
relating to validity (9/30/08 summary judgment order, p. 30 Document No. 141, Exhibit
16

1). There was no ruling about any claim interpretation relating to prior art. Nor was
there ever any ruling about “hidden DOM” or “hidden text” as it might relate to either
infringement or validity.
E.

HyperPhrase “Continued To Pursue Its
Willful Infringement Allegation” (Google Br. 12-13)

Google’s final argument is yet another variant on “we think we should have won,
therefore we did win.” Google berates HyperPhrase for “steadfastly maintain[ing] its
untenable willful infringement allegation after remand” (Google Br. 12). Citing In re
Seagate Technology, Inc., 497 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007), Google asserts that “[t]here is
no way HyperPhrase could meet that standard here” (Id.). Google does not even try to
explain why that is so; and this Court never decided the “willfulness” issue, because it
found non-infringement. Again, Google seeks an “exceptional case” finding based on an
issue on which it did not even prevail.
F.

Google’s Accusations Do Not Add Up To An “Exceptional Case”

In short, Google prevailed on the merits on just one issue: non-infringement. And
it did so by suggesting eight claim construction arguments (see Section II-C, above),
which it never presented to the Federal Circuit and which remained uncertain until this
Court’s September 30, 2008 summary judgment decision (Document 141, Exhibit 1).
The ‘889 and ‘321 patents are not infringed by AutoLink under this Court’s decision, but
those claims remain valid notwithstanding Google’s attack on them. Nor is there any
finding that Google’s actions are covered by any license.
Google’s request for a finding that this case is “exceptional,” therefore, is only
peripherally related to this Court’s actual findings, which are that five specific claim
17

elements defined for the first time by this Court in its September 30, 2008 Opinion are
not present in AutoLink (see Section II-D, above). For the most part, Google’s argument
is that it should have prevailed on other issues which this Court did not decide (see
Section II-E, above), and that it is therefore entitled to half a million dollars in attorney
fees. But, as this Court has held,
the Federal Circuit has made it plain that the term “exceptional” means
just that. It does not apply to miscalculation about the chances of
prevailing or run-of-the-mill litigation problems. See Rohm & Haas, 736
F.2d at 690-91 (Congress did not intend award of attorney fees to be
ordinary consequence in patent suits).
Computer Docking Station Corp. v. Dell, Inc., 547 F.Supp.2d at 954, aff’d, 519 F.3d
1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
Moreover, when Google’s inflammatory rhetoric has been stripped away, little or
nothing more than a finding of non-infringement remains, and that finding is based on the
construction of five claim terms by this Court on September 30, 2008. Such a holding is
not sufficient to support a finding of “exceptional circumstances,” still less an award of
attorney fees following such a finding. “Infringement is often difficult to determine, and
a patentee’s ultimately incorrect view of how a court will find does not of itself establish
bad faith.”

Brooks Furniture, 393 F.3d at 1384 (vacating district court’s award of

attorney fees and “exceptional case” finding); Frank’s Casing Crew & Rental Tools, Inc.
v. Weatherford International, Inc., 389 F.3d 1370, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (no fee award
even though patent owner “persist[ed] in offering arguments dismissed by the district
court’s ... Markman Order”).

18

These principles are particularly important here, because this Court’s summary
judgment decision dealt primarily with claim construction, a notoriously unpredictable
topic, as this Court has held in terms equally applicable here:
The resolution of this case turned on the court’s construction of
claim terms in the ‘743 patent. Although the construction entitled
defendants to prevail, and I continue to believe that the construction was
correct, the constructions were not the only plausible ones. Plaintiff’s
expert disagreed with the court’s construction and provided reasoning for
his own plausible construction. Although I found plaintiff’s expert’s
construction unpersuasive, I do not believe it was objectively baseless.
Furthermore, construction of the term “notification region” was
disputed throughout this lawsuit. Construction of the term required
combining the claim language and specification as well as interpreting the
prosecution history of the ‘743 patent. If the court of appeals were to find
that this court erred in its construction of a “notification region,” plaintiff
may yet prevail on its infringement claim.
Defendants’ exceptional case contention is based entirely on the
hindsight adoption of this court’s construction of the ‘743 patent. More
than this is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that
plaintiff pursued this litigation in bad faith.
Vehicle IP, LLC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43426, at *9-*10.
VI.

THE CASES GOOGLE CITES DO NOT SUPPORT ITS POSITION
Google places primary reliance on a recent decision from the District of Colorado

in Medtronic Navigation, Inc. v. BrainLAB Medizinische Computersystems GmbH, 2008
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82934 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2008).

Fees were imposed in

Medtronic because the patent owner’s counsel made arguments to the jury at trial which
allegedly caused the jury to disregard the district court’s claim construction and
“blatantly present[ed] the jury with a product to product comparison contrary to
established law and the Court’s cautionary instructions.” Id. at *18-*19. Here, there was
no jury and no “product to product comparison.” Aside from not being controlling

19

authority here, this decision is inapposite. Moreover, it is now on appeal to the Federal
Circuit (Appeal No. 2009-1058) and therefore can hardly be regarded as settled, even in
the Tenth Circuit.
Google’s characterization of Depuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek,
Inc., 534 F.Supp.2d 224 (D. Mass. 2008) is also misguided.

Under Depuy Spine,

sanctions were imposed on the defendant after defendant’s counsel made arguments to
the jury at trial encouraging the jury to adopt an interpretation of the patent claims that
was contrary to the construction mandated by the Federal Circuit. Again, there was no
jury here nor any similar fear of one party seeking to improperly influence the jury or
“take advantage of the technical and legal complexities inherent in this case.” Id. at 227.
Google also makes much of Taurus IP, LLC v. Daimlerchrysler Corp., 559
F.Supp.2d. 947 (W.D. Wis. 2008).

But in that case, the patent owner’s prefiling

investigation was deficient (id. at 967) whereas here, Google makes no such claim (nor
could it, inasmuch as the Federal Circuit has already held that as of 2007, genuinely
disputed issues of material fact precluded entry of summary judgment. See Section II-B,
above, quoting HyperPhrase, 260 Fed. Appx. at 281, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29796 at
*19. In Taurus, there was also witness tampering, and the plaintiff set up a company in
Wisconsin purely for “jurisdictional reasons.” 559 F.Supp.2d at 968. Again, Google
makes no such accusations here.
Moreover, the Epcon case relied on by Google is likewise inapposite. Epcon Gas
Systems, Inc. v. Bauer Compressors, 279 F.3d 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In Epcon, the
Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision denying the defendant’s motion to
declare the case exceptional under § 285 when defendant’s argument were based almost
20

entirely on allegations that the patent licensee failed to perform an adequate prefiling
investigation. Again, Google has made no such argument. Like Epcon, this Court should
use its discretion to deny Google’s motion.
The other cases Google cites are no more helpful to its position. In Third Wave
Technologies, Inc. v. Stratagene Corp., 405 F.Supp.2d 991 (W.D. Wis. 2005), the court
assessed attorney fees against an infringer (not against a patent owner), finding that the
infringer had disobeyed court orders requiring production of documents, violated a
protective order by disclosing confidential materials, proffered a “meritless challenge to
plaintiff’s ownership of the patents in issue,” and submitted an exhibit list that showed
disregard for civility and courtesy. Id. at 1017. No such charges are made by Google
here.
Furthermore, Google’s reliance on American Standard, Inc. v. York Int’l Corp. is
not persuasive. 244 F. Supp. 2d 990 (W.D. Wis. 2002). This Court declared American
Standard an exceptional case based on a jury verdict finding both non-infringement and
invalidity, evasive discovery tactics on the part of the plaintiffs as well as a finding that
plaintiffs failed to conduct an adequate prefiling investigation. Id. at 997. HyperPhrase
submits that the present case is entirely factually distinct. There was no jury trial. There
was no finding of invalidity here. The claims of the ‘889 and ‘321 patents, though not
infringed, remain valid. There are no allegations of evasive discovery tactics on the part
of HyperPhrase that would support Google’s argument that this is an exceptional case.
Further, there are no allegations, let alone any finding by this court, that HyperPhrase
failed to conduct an adequate prefiling investigation. On these facts, there is no basis to
grant Google’s motion to find this case exceptional under § 285.
21

VII.

CONCLUSION
Google’s motion for attorney fees should be denied. Google has failed to prove

by clear and convincing evidence that this case was “exceptional” – indeed, its arguments
rest primarily on impermissible hindsight. And Google has offered no reasons why this
Court should exercise its discretion to award fees even if this were an “exceptional” case.
