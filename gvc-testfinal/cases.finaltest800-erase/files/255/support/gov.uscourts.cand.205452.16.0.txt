INTRODUCTION

2

Defendant Impax Laboratories, Inc. brings this motion in response to the Court’s sua

3

sponte decision to move the hearing on Impax’s summary judgment motion from the noticed

4

date of August 25, 2008, to November 3, 2008, and respectfully requests that the Court either

5

reinstate the original hearing date, or hear the motion on the earliest-available date thereafter. As

6

explained below, a summary judgment hearing and ruling may obviate the need for further

7

proceedings, regardless of which party prevails. In two telephone calls, one before and one after

8

the Court’s setting the November 3, 2008 hearing date, Plaintiffs have refused to offer a date on

9

which they might be available for a hearing. Thus, this motion is opposed, but the basis of

10
11

Plaintiffs’ opposition is less than clear, as explained below.
For unusual reasons, all of the disputed issues in this case are already ripe for resolution.

12

The disputed issues are atypically narrow, in large part because Plaintiffs (with the very

13

attorneys representing them in this case) have already litigated an identical case based on the

14

same patent and branded drug, but against a different filer of an Abbreviated New Drug

15

Application (“ANDA”). Just last year, Plaintiffs won summary judgment in that District of New

16

Jersey action by prevailing on a single question of law—whether Plaintiff Astellas was entitled

17

to patent certain chemical compounds where it already owned a patent covering the processes for

18

producing those specific compounds—and then settled on appeal. See Astellas v. Ranbaxy

19

(“Ranbaxy”), 2007 WL 576341 (D.N.J. Feb. 21, 2007). That same question, following an

20

intervening Federal Circuit decision, is also the crux of this case.

21

In fact, Impax so firmly believes that this matter can and should be decided as a matter of

22

law that its motion requests that, if the Court does not grant summary judgment for Impax, it

23

should grant summary judgment for Plaintiffs, so that the case may proceed to appeal. A prompt

24

hearing on the summary judgment motion will thus obviate the need for further proceedings in

25

this case, including the status conference also currently set for November 3, 2008.

26

Although a two-month delay would be inconsequential in many lawsuits, the delay makes

27

a big difference here. Plaintiffs have sued Impax for filing an ANDA seeking approval to market

28

a generic version of plaintiff Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s branded drug

Flomax®, alleging that Impax’s ANDA infringed a patent owned by Plaintiff Astellas Pharma

2

Inc. Although Impax believes that the relevant claims of the patent are invalid, Impax cannot

3

benefit from challenging the validity of those claims unless it succeeds in that challenge

4

(including any necessary appeal of a trial court decision against it) in the mere 15 months that

5

remain before the patent expires.

II.

BACKGROUND

This suit arises under the Hatch-Waxman Act (“the Act”), which allows a generic drug

8

company to file an ANDA requesting permission to make and sell a generic version of a branded

9

drug, even if the branded drug company has stated that a patent would cover such a product. The

10

applicant must notify the branded drug company and the relevant patentee of the ANDA filing

11

and explain why the patent is either invalid or not infringed. See 21 U.S.C. §§

12

355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) & 355(j)(2)(B). The branded drug company and patentee have 45 days

13

from receipt of such notice to bring an infringement action, which automatically triggers a 30-

14

month delay in the approval process. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Because of this 30-

15

month delay, Plaintiffs have every incentive to postpone the resolution of the case. If they can

16

only prevent Impax from winning in the next 15 months, they will have succeeded in excluding

17

competitors from the market based on an invalid patent.

18

Plaintiffs’ actions already indicate that delay is their primary objective. Despite having

19

already litigated the same issues against a different defendant, Plaintiffs nevertheless waited until

20

the 43rd day after Impax’s notice letter to file suit. Plaintiffs’ waiting was clearly a tactical

21

decision, as nothing in their six-page Complaint required that amount of time to draft. See

22

Complaint. Plaintiffs’ posture in meet and confer regarding the summary judgment also

23

demonstrates their strategy of delay. Impax initiated communications about its summary

24

judgment motion by letter on the business day after Plaintiffs filed suit. Declaration of Asim M.

25

Bhansali In Support of Motion to Shorten Time (“Bhansali Decl.”) ¶ 2 & Ex. A. To date, Impax

26

has sent two letters and participated in two telephone conferences with opposing counsel, but has

27

been unable to get an answer to the simple question of whether any scheduling conflict would

28

prevent Plaintiffs from attending a hearing on the dates that Impax proposed. Id. ¶¶ 2-7 &

LEGAL STANDARD

Under the Federal Rules, defendants have the right to bring summary judgment motions

9

from the very beginning of a case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (permitting defendants to move for

10

summary judgment “at any time”). The Federal Rules do not require a defendant to wait on

11

other procedural events if summary judgment is appropriate at the outset of the case.

12
13

IV.
A.

ARGUMENT

Subject to the Court’s Schedule, There Is No Obstacle To An Earlier Hearing

14

All of the excuses Plaintiffs have offered for refusing to agree to a hearing date are

15

baseless. First, Plaintiffs have said attorney travel precludes them from telling Impax their

16

availability for a hearing. There is no reason that it should take a week or more for Plaintiffs to

17

ascertain their availability for on the dates Impax proposed. The law firm that Plaintiffs have

18

retained boasts over 90 litigators, including no fewer than six—three partners and three

19

associates—who tout their work on Ranbaxy. Bhansali Decl., Ex. E. Someone should be able to

20

answer that question. Second, Plaintiffs’ demand to see Impax’s motion before discussing a

21

hearing date, see id., Ex. B, is not reasonable and is surely an unprecedented arrogation of power

22

by a non-movant. In any event, Impax actually told Plaintiffs what the motion would be about

23

even before the phone call, by letter the day after plaintiffs filed their complaint. Id., Ex. A.

24

Moreover, in a second phone call on the second business day after Impax’s filed it motions,

25

Plaintiffs claimed that they still could not give an available hearing date because of attorney

26

travel, and could not do so for another week. Id. ¶ 7. Third, any complaint by Plaintiffs about

27

the size of Impax’s filing is similarly groundless. Impax’s brief is the standard 25 pages in

28

length, and, in fact, largely reprises the summary judgment arguments in Ranbaxy. Although the

exhibits are voluminous, the overwhelming majority are from Ranbaxy, consisting of the

2

summary judgment papers, complaint and docket sheet. Plaintiffs are intimately familiar with

3

those documents. Only 5 exhibits are new to Plaintiffs; these exhibits comprise excerpts from

4

various dictionaries, treatises and the Patent Office’s Manual of Patent Examining Procedure.

5

B.

This Case Is Ripe For Resolution Now

6

The central question in this case is whether certain claims of the asserted patent are

7

invalid on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting. If those claims are valid, Impax’s

8

answer, filed four days after the Complaint, already admits that Impax infringed them. The only

9

other question in the case is whether Plaintiffs can pursue an infringement claim based on any of

10
11

the remaining claims of the patent—claims that they did not even assert in Ranbaxy.
The first question is unusually narrow for an invalidity inquiry. Unlike many invalidity

12

arguments, which might encompass a wide universe of prior art and arguments about the

13

applicability thereof, the nonstatutory double patenting inquiry is limited to a comparison of the

14

earlier and later patent claims to determine whether the later claims are “patentably distinct”

15

from the earlier ones. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs., 251 F.3d 955, 968 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

16

This question is decided as a matter of law. See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 195

17

F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Moreover, because of Ranbaxy, Plaintiffs are collaterally

18

estopped from contesting certain holdings in that case, including the Ranbaxy court’s claim

19

construction. See Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 5 F.3d 514, 518 (Fed. Cir. 1993).

20

The infringement issues on the second question are really uncontested, despite Plaintiffs’

21

unwillingness to so admit thus far. Impax’s argument rests entirely upon concrete factual

22

admissions that Plaintiffs made either on the record in Ranbaxy or in proceedings before the

23

Patent Office. Each of those admissions contradicts a specific element of the remaining thirteen

24

claims, conclusively demonstrating noninfringement of those claims. Discovery will not allow

25

Plaintiffs to contradict their earlier statements.

26
27

Indeed, all the evidence cited in Impax’s motion is subject to judicial notice, and its
motion could have been brought as either a motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment on the

pleadings. The choice of summary judgment as the vehicle was intended to maximize the chance

2

of a conclusive ruling by allowing all relevant information to come before the Court.

3

C.

Compelling Reasons Favor Advancing The Hearing Date

4

A timely hearing is necessary to the fair resolution of the case because Impax can only

5

truly prevail in this action by doing so before the asserted patent expires. In other contexts, a

6

company that truly believed that its product would not infringe a competitor’s patent, or that the

7

patent was invalid or unenforceable, would be free to go to market and risk an infringement suit.

8

ANDA applicants do not have that option because of the 30-month approval delay, and thus may

9

be held hostage by even the most meritless infringement claims.

10

Swift resolution of this case would also promote the Hatch-Waxman Act’s goal of

11

speeding the introduction of generic drugs by allowing Impax, if it prevails, to enter the market

12

before the asserted patent expires. See Andrx Pharm., Inc, v. Biovail Corp. Int’l, 256 F.3d 799,

13

809 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“Congress sought to get generic drugs into the hands of patients at

14

reasonable prices—fast”). No public benefit is served by allowing a drug company to block

15

competition with an invalid patent or spurious infringement allegations. Speedy resolution

16

advances the Act’s goals.

17
18

V.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Impax respectfully requests that the Court shorten the time for

19

hearing Impax’s summary judgment motion, either by reinstating the originally noticed hearing

20

date of August 25, 2008, or by moving the hearing to the next-available hearing date thereafter.
