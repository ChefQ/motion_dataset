Case 5:08-cv-03466-JW Document18 ~~ Filed 08/04/2008 Page 2 of 7

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

The patent in suit, U.S. Patent No. 4,703,063 ("the `063 patent'), issued more than 20
years ago, and will expire in October, 2009. The drug protected by that patent, called
"tamsulosin," was approved by the U.S. FDA more than 10 years ago for the treatment of benign
prostatic hyperplasia ("BPH"). Since its launch, tamsulosin has become the leading medicament
for alleviating that highly prevalent male affliction.

Under the applicable statute, any generic drug company that wanted to seek U.S. FDA
approval to sell a generic copy of tamsulosin and concomitantly challenge the `063 patent that
protected it, was free to do so as of April, 2001. 21 U.S.C. 0x00A7 355 G)(5)(F)(ii). Impax, however,
elected to wait over 7 years and to delay both its challenge to the `063 patent and its application
to seek U.S. FDA approval for its product, until (as Impax puts it) "the mere 15 months before
the patent expires." See Defendant's Motion to Shorten Time at 2.

Having delayed until the waning months of the patent's term, Impax now complains that
its challenge will be mooted unless it obtains a decision before the patent expires, not only from
this Court, but from the Court of Appeals as well. It offers no excuse or extenuating
circumstance justifying its lack of diligence -- yet, incredibly, pleads its own dilatoriness as the
reason why this Court should depart from its normal schedule and procedures and, despite its
heavy case load, reward Impax with priority over other pending cases.

Moreover, in arguing that the `063 patent should be held invalid, Impax seeks to re-
litigate a defense that was pleaded, briefed and argued by an earlier, more diligent generic filer
(Ranbaxy Pharma) and decided favorably to the patent by Judge Mary Cooper of the District of
New Jersey one and half years ago.

"Double patenting" -- the defense Impax asserts -- requires a comparison of the
invention claimed in the `063 patent with the invention claimed in the inventors' prior patent,
U.S. Patent No. 4,373,106 ("the `106 patent'). Judge Cooper made that analysis and concluded
that the inventors had made two distinct and separate inventions: the chemical synthesis process
invention claimed in the `106 patent and the invention of compounds useful as medicines and

pharmaceutical compositions for administration to patients claimed in `063. Judge Cooper

concluded that, having made two distinct inventions, the inventors were entitled to two patents.

As the Court will see from the faces of the `063 and `106 patents [see Exhibits 1 & 2], the
subject matter of each is complex synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry. If this Court is to re-
examine and independently re-assess the correctness of Judge Cooper's prior decision, it should
have at least the same opportunity she had to understand the science and construe the respective
claims. [See Exhibit 3].

Because -- (1) any time constraints are entirely the product of Impax's lack of diligence,
(11) the subject matter is complex science, (iii) this Court has a heavy docket and (iv) Impax has a
low likelihood of success in re-litigating an issue previously decided by a competent judge, there
is no legitimate reason why this Court and Plaintiffs should be rushed into an abbreviated
schedule to deal with Impax's motion.

ARGUMENT

Impax contends that it "stands the risk of severe prejudice" if it does not receive
preferential treatment from the Court and that the only relevant issue should be opposing
counsel's "availability" to be physically present in San Jose on a day that suits Impax. Neither
assertion is accurate or apt.

Every lawsuit involves the risk of "prejudice" to one litigant or the other. The relevant
question is whether prejudice is unfair and is one that is properly cognizable by the Court. Impax
should not be heard to turn its own dilatory conduct into an advantage and an excuse to impose

6a

burdens on this Court and on Plaintiffs. The issue is not simply counsel's "availability," but
rather what is a fair and appropriate schedule for the parties to present, and for the Court to
decide, a complex chemical case.

It is Impax who unfairly attempts to prejudice Plaintiffs by forcing it to prepare and file a
hurried opposition brief to Impax's summary judgment motion which involves complex legal and
factual issues, without Plaintiffs having the opportunity to take one ounce of discovery -- Impax
is still to provide Plaintiffs with even its initial disclosures. Even though prejudice to Plaintiffs is

apparent, Plaintiffs have no burden to show that it will suffer any harm or prejudice to

successfully oppose Impax's present motion.

I. History Shows that Impax Has Not Suffered Unfair Prejudice

The dates that are relevant to Impax's motion to shorten time are set forth in the attached
Declaration of Todd Nosher in Support of Plaintiffs' Opposition to Shorten Time.

This history demonstrates that Impax did nothing in 2001 when it could have challenged
the `063 patent, did nothing while Ranbaxy was litigating the double patenting issue and did
nothing in February, 2007 to test whether Judge Cooper had incorrectly decided that issue.

If Impax is now suffering pain, it is the pain of sitting on its own hands for so long. In
light of this history of seven years of continuous inaction, it is incredible that Impax now asserts
that "delay is [Plaintiffs'] primary objective" and it was a "strategy of delay," and "baseless" and
"groundless" that (1) Plaintiffs took slightly more than one month (within the term prescribed by
statute) to review Impax's belated notice letter and decide where to bring suit; and (ii) were
unable (because of a prior business commitment) to accommodate Impax's demand to meet and
confer on 24-hour notice. See Defendant's Motion to Shorten Time at 2.

Il. Impax's Motion Is Neither Simple Nor A "Pure Question Of Law"

 

Deciding an issue of obviousness-type double patenting is not simply an exercise in
looking at the words of one patent claim and seeing if the same words appear in another patent
claim. As Judge Giles Rich explained in his encyclopedic explication in General Foods Corp. v.
Studiengesellschaft Kohle (972 F.2d 1272, 23 USPQ2d 1839 (Fed. Cir. 1992)), the prior claims
are not "prior art," and cannot be used as if they were a prior disclosure. Rather, the Court must
evaluate, and then compare, what was the invention claimed in the prior patent and the invention
claimed in the later one. Jd at 1277-79.

The invention of the `106 patent is synthetic process based on a series of defined reactants
and steps. The invention of the `063 patent is chemical compounds and pharmaceutical
compositions useful to treat patients. To understand what those disparate inventions are, the
Court must understand both the underlying science and the nature, scope and meaning of the
claims of each patent. That is a comparison of substance, not merely words.

To do that analysis, the Court must understand the science. Impax's submissions offer

this Court no help on that and -- to boot, proffer evidence that cannot be justified on the asserted

principles of collateral estoppel or admissions by an adversary.

If Judge Cooper's opinion gives rise to collateral estoppel at all (which is questionable
because it was vacated), it could only be for issues that were actually litigated and were essential
to the decision.' That would be determined by reading the decision itself, not the submissions of
the Ranbaxy litigants, which Impax asks the Court to accept through "judicial notice."

Moreover, it is incorrect for Impax to seek to have this Court accept here Ranbaxy's
briefs and the opinions of Ranbaxy's experts. That request cannot be justified either as a
consequence of collateral estoppel or as admissions of the Plaintiffs here. One especially
egregious example is that Impax's brief asserts, as pure ipse dixit, that the process steps of the
`106 patent were not novel and were obvious (see Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment,
at 4), without a shred of factual or expert evidence to support that assertion. As an issued patent,
the `106 patent enjoys a presumption that its claimed subject matter in both novel and non-
obvious -- a presumption that can be overcome only by evidence that is clear and convincing, not
by naked assertions of counsel (35 U.S.C. 0x00A7282, Bausch & Lomb v. Barnes-Hind/Hydrocurve,
Inc., 796 F.2d 443, 446 (Fed. Cir. 1986)), and it is not a conclusion that the Court can, or should,
determine as a "pure question of law" (see Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment at 2).

Finally, Impax asserts that Plaintiffs should be able to decide now which of the patent
claims they will assert in this case, based on which ones they asserted in Ranbaxy. That ignores
that Plaintiffs had full discovery of the composition of Ranbaxy's product and the process used to
produce it. When comparable discovery is conducted here, Plaintiffs will make a similarly
informed judgment of what claims to assert at that time.

Ill. Impax's Generic Applicant Status Does Not Justify Special Privileges

In mid-2008, Impax filed an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") seeking

approval from the U.S. FDA to sell a generic copy of tamsulosin. Apart from freeing itself from

the constraints of patent infringement, Impax is required to prove to the U.S. FDA that its

 

"Impax must agree because cases cited in Defendant's Motions for Summary Judgment
and to Shorten Time stand for this proposition. See, e.g., Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 5 F.3d 514,
517-518 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Hydranautics v. FilmTec Corp., 204 F.3d 880, 885-887 (9" Cir. 2000).

proposed product meets the agency's requirements for purity and manufacturing standards, and
produces the same effect in patients (i.e. is "bio-equivalent" to) Plaintiffs' innovator product.
Unless and until Impax satisfies U.S. FDA's technical requirements, it cannot get U.S. FDA
approval -- thus cannot sell its product, and it remains a moot question whether it would also be a
patent infringer, if it sells that product.

Impax does not currently have U.S. FDA technical approval, and the median time to
obtain that approval for a generic copycat product is about 17 months.' Impax's U.S. FDA
review process has just started. Whether or when it will ever be in a position to obtain that
approval will be a subject of discovery in this case. Absent that approval, the patent issues
remain premature, and may be entirely moot.

Finally, Impax's attempts to assume the mantle of a necessary provider to the public of
generic tamsulosin (see Defendants' Motion to Shorten Time at 5) are misplaced. As of today, at
least three prior generic ANDA filers have "tentative approval," i.e. they have established what
Impax has not -- the ability to meet U.S. FDA's technical requirements of safety, efficacy and
assurances of quality and bio-equivalence.*

CONCLUSION

If an appellate decision on Impax's summary judgment motion does not occur before the
`063 patent expires, that is solely Impax's fault. Neither this Court nor Plaintiffs should be
required to take extraordinary measures to make up for Impax's dilatoriness. To decide a second
time the issue of obviousness-type double patenting that Judge Cooper has already found

baseless, this Court will need a full record and adequate time to review it.

"tamsulosin hydrochloride" yields three ANDAs with tentative approval.
