Case No.: 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD

______________________________________________________________________________
DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO
MAINTAIN DOCKET NO. 201 UNDER SEAL
______________________________________________________________________________
Defendant Michael Harrison (“Harrison”), by counsel, respectfully submits his Response
in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Maintain Docket No. 201 Under Seal [CM/ECF 240], and
in support of his response opposing Plaintiff Malibu Media, LLC’s (“Malibu”) motion, states as
follows:
1.

This Court should deny Malibu’s Motion to Maintain Docket No. 201 Under Seal

(“Motion”) for the reasons set forth in Defendant’s SEALED Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for
Sanctions Against Defense Counsel Gabriel Quearry for Publicly Disclosing and Disseminating
Confidential Information Twice in Violation of the Protective Order Entered on April 29, 2014.
ECF 244 at 3-10. If the Court agrees that the names are not confidential information as defined
by the Protective Order [CM/ECF 244 at 3-10; CM/CEF 177], Malibu’s instant motion should be
denied.
2.

The Court should deny Malibu’s Motion for the additional reason that the Motion

violates S.D. Ind. L.R. 7-1(b)(2). The local rule provides: “[t]he following motions must also be

	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 250 Filed 10/10/14 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 1859
	  

accompanied by a supporting brief: … (2) any motion made under Fed. R. Civ. 37.” S.D. Ind.
L.R. 7-1(b)(2).
3.

Malibu expressly states that its Motion is made “pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37[.]”

ECF 240 at 3 (“Docket No. 201 should remain sealed or be stricken pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
37[.]”); ECF 240 at 2 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) as the legal standard applicable to its
Motion); Id. (citing Whitehead v. Gateway Chevrolet, et al., 2004 WL 1459478, at *3 (N.D. Ill.
2004), as an example in support of its argument that “Rule 37(b) [applies] to violations of Rule
26(c) protective orders”). However, Malibu’s Motion is not accompanied by a supporting brief.
CM/ECF 240.
For all of the foregoing reasons, Defendant Michael Harrison respectfully requests that
the Court enter an order denying Malibu’s Motion and unsealing Docket No. 201 in its entirety
for public view, and awarding Harrison his reasonable expenses incurred responding to Malibu’s
Motion; and for all other relief this Court deems just and proper.
Respectfully Submitted,
