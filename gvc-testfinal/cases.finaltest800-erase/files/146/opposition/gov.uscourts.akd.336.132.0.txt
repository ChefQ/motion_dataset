Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION IN
LIMINE

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby responds
as follows to those portions of defendants’ “Motion in Limine” (defendants’ motion) that merit a

Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB

-2response:
Defendants’ motion, while largely unintelligible, asks the Court to prevent the United
States from introducing into evidence in this case any documents identified by defendants as
“substantive documents” and from citing to any section of the Internal Revenue Code, any
Treasury Regulations, and any case law which references the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury
Regulations.
With respect to defendants’ request to prevent the government’s introduction of
“substantive documents” into evidence, as set forth in the United States Response to Defendants’
Motion to Compel Discovery, filed concurrently with this response, the United States is unaware
of defendants’ meaning when they use the term “substantive documents.” The United States has
produced to defendants copies of all documents it intends to rely upon in this matter, in
compliance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. Because defendants have failed to define “substantive
documents,” it is impossible for the United States to respond to defendants’ request.
Accordingly, defendants’ motion should be denied at this time because it is not made with
respect to any specific document; however, in the event that the United States later attempts to
introduce a document into evidence not previously provided to defendants in this matter,
defendants should be allowed to move the Court at that time to exclude that particular document.
With respect to defendants’ request to prevent the government from citing any statutes,
regulations, or case law in this matter, defendants request is patently absurd and entirely lacking
any legal or factual basis. Obviously, the United States intends to rely on federal tax law,
contained in the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, and case law, in support of its

Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB

-3positions in this case. Any attempt to deny such reliance is frivolous and should be denied.
Wherefore, inasmuch as defendants have failed to show any legal or factual basis to
support their motion in limine, the United States respectfully requests that the Court deny
defendants’ motion.
Dated this 3rd day of August, 2007.
Respectfully Submitted,
NELSON P. COHEN
United States Attorney
