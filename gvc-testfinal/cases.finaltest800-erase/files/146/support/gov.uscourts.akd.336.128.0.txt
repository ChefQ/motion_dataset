Motion In Limine
Come now Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes ("the Hymes") with this
Motion in Limine from the "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" and/or Jennifer D.
Auchterlonie.
The Hymes have to date not received any substantive documents that would

allow the Hymes to have this instant Case "adjudicated on the merits" as held in Lambert

v. Blodgett, 393 F.3d 943 (9" Cir. 2004), to wit:

... phrase "adjudicated on the merits" means a decision finally resolving the parties'
claims that is based on the substance of the claim advanced, rather than on a
procedural, or other, ground;

Therefore, the Hymes Motion this court that if the "UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA" and/or Jennifer D. Auchterlonie do not produce the substantive documents in
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document128 ~~ Filed 07/19/2007 Page 2of2

support of the Claim in this instant Case by August 3, 2007, that no such documents can
be entered into evidence or any purported trial;

And further, if the will and statutory authority of Congress with the mandated
substantive regulations are not disclosed prior to August 3, 2007 to the Hymes, to support
the Claim by the "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" and/or Jennifer D. Auchterlonie in
this instant Case; no document or reference will be allowed to any Code sections or
regulations or case containing any Code sections or regulations.

And further, as this restriction is being imposed by Ralph Beistline, the Hymes
here motion Ralph Beistline for the same treatment to at least give the appearance of

Justice.
