Lead Plaintiff Dr. Arnold Friedman (“Plaintiff”) respectfully submits his opposition to
Ehrhardt Keefe Steiner & Hottman, P.C.’s (“EKSH” or the “Auditor”) Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint filed December 8, 2008.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
On November 17, 2008, this Court entered an Order denying EKSH’s motion to dismiss
Plaintiff’s Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint filed January 7, 2008, and denying
Defendant Whitney Information Networks, Inc. (the “Company”), and the Individual
Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The complaint was not dismissed on the merits, but rather
merely stricken from the record in accordance with Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., 464
F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006).1

The Court authorized Plaintiff to refile the amended

complaint after addressing the Court’s concern that “Plaintiff fails to connect the relevant facts to
the elements of each claim. Therefore, the Court is unable to determine if Plaintiff has stated a
claim with the requisite particularity required by Rule 9(a) and the PSLRA [Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act].” Order at 4.
Plaintiff thereafter filed his operative Complaint alleging a detailed and compelling
securities fraud against the Company’s “independent” Auditor, the Company, and the Individual
Defendants while simultaneously addressing the Court’s concerns by carefully addressing each
element of its Section 10(b) claim in relation to the facts necessary to plead that claim.2 Plaintiff
has adequately alleged that the Auditor made materially false and misleading statements during
the Class Period (Section IV of Complaint) with scienter (Section V) upon which Plaintiff relied
1

While EKSH makes it a point to consistently mislabel to the Complaint as Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint,
this Court’s Order struck Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint with leave to refile it, which Plaintiff did on December 8,
2008. Order at 5. As the Auditor well knows, there is no so-called “Second Amended Complaint.” The First
Amended Complaint filed July 10, 2007 is referred to as the “Now-Stricken FAC” and the First Amended
Complaint refiled on December 8, 2008 is the operative “Complaint.”
2
The Section 20(a) claim is brought against the Individual Defendants. Therefore, 20(a) is addressed in the
Opposition to the Company and Individual Defendants Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint (“Co. Opp.”). That Co. Opp. is hereby incorporated by reference into this brief.

(Section VIII) and which caused Plaintiff and the Class damages (Section VI-VII).
In response, the Auditor filed a slightly-revised version of its previously-filed motion to
dismiss. The most notable change in EKSH’s submission is that it backtracks from its position -boldly but baselessly made in its prior motion – that the Auditor cannot be liable under the
Securities Laws because there is no suggestion that “EKSH ran the company, served as officer or
director, prepared the allegedly offending press releases, or audited Whitney’s quarterly
financials.” EKSH 1/17/08 Brief at 5.3 Preliminarily, it appears that between the filing of its
initial motion to dismiss and its refiling, EKSH has taken the time to actually familiarize itself
with at least some of the duties and responsibilities of an auditor of a public company, as well as
to read SEC Rules 12a-10 and 15d-10, which, as noted in Plaintiff’s prior opposition brief, notes
that only annual financial statements are generally audited by the independent auditor. Prior
Opp. at 1. However, while the Auditor no longer directly contends this time around that auditors
cannot be liable for securities fraud unless they acted not only as auditors but also as directors,
officers, or control persons at the Company, the fundamental misapprehension of the Securities
Laws remains: the Auditor still attempts to erroneously claim that the Complaint fails to allege
that it made false and misleading statements during the Class Period and therefore can only be

3

Indeed, EKSH’s previously filed motion to dismiss was so rife with embarrassing errors of law and fact that Lead
Plaintiff was forced to include an entire Section dedicated to a discussion of said errors in its prior opposition. See
Plaintiff’s Prior Opposition to EKSH Br. (“Prior Opp.”) filed February 15, 2008 (Dkt. No. 86.) at 25-26. In its
current submission, EKSH continues to exhibit fundamental misunderstandings of the Securities Laws. For
example, the Auditor does not appear to understand the difference between the materiality element and the scienter
element of a Section 10(b) claim, strangely noting: “Plaintiffs may also attempt to argue that the fact that the
Company restated its financial statements is sufficient to show that EKS&H made material misstatements.
However, mere publication of restated financial statements is insufficient to create the strong inference of scienter
required by the PSLRA.” Br. at 14. To be sure, the restating of financials constitutes an admission that the prior
financials were materially false when made. In re Sunbeam Sec. Litig., 89 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1338 (S.D. Fla. 1999).
In re Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig., 324 F. Supp. 2d 474, 486 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“[T]he mere fact
that financial results were restated is sufficient basis for pleading that those statements were false when made.”).
However, scienter is a separate inquiry, of course, under the statutory framework. In accordance with Tellabs,
Plaintiff has pleaded abundant indicia of scienter with respect to the Auditor, as addressed herein below.

liable through “scheme” liability.4 The Complaint plainly debunks this fallacy: actionable
statements made by the Auditor during the Class Period include letters of consent and
representations regarding the accuracy and completeness of the Company’s SEC filings
including signing an Independent Auditors Report certifying the filings’ veracity and
completeness. ¶¶13-15, 82.
Focusing on specious technicalities, EKSH conveniently ignores the overwhelming facts
that abundantly support a claim for securities fraud against it: Plaintiff alleges in great detail that
the Company was a sham from top to bottom—including its bogus products forced on unwitting
consumers which resulted in a zero refund policy, massive GAAP violations, manipulations of
revenue recognition requiring restatements, and suspiciously timed departures of no fewer than
six Company executives (including the Audit Committee Chair). Indeed, the Complaint alleges
that EKSH consciously ignored or was severely reckless in disregarding a myriad of red flags
apparent from the very day EKSH undertook employment and continuing through extensive
financial restatements and the issuance of Grand Jury subpoenas and indictments of Company
employees. Indeed, EKSH became Whitney’s auditor in February 2001 after a six month period
of the Company juggling accounting firms and facing massive financial restatements: Whitney
announced on August 2, 2000 that effective mid-August 2000 it would terminate its long time
auditor Larry Legel, CPA in favor of a “larger firm,” BDO Seidman. See Declaration of Kim E.
Miller (“Miller Decl”), submitted herewith, at Exhibit A.
4

Just three months later BDO

EKSH claims “[a]lthough Stoneridge did not concern the claims brought against the auditors, its reasoning is
equally applicable where, as here, the auditors are merely secondary actors sought to be held primarily liable, and, in
this case, where there are no allegations that the auditors violated auditing standards.” Br. at 12. This argument
could not be further from the truth and is directly contrary to the Complaint. As discussed above, the Auditor is
named as a 10(b) defendant for making materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.
Auditors who speak falsely are routinely named as defendants in securities fraud cases and are not mere aiders and
abettors under Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 191 (1994).
Neither Stoneridge nor Central Bank have any relevance whatsoever to EKSH’s liability and for EKSH to argue this
position still suggests that they simply have no legitimate legal arguments to make and have been reduced to the
repetition of red herrings.

terminated its relationship with the Company. Miller Decl. Exh. B. Less than a month after that,
the Company announced it would be forced to restate its financials for 1998, 1999, and part of
2000. Miller Decl. Exh. C. Despite these extreme red flags, EKSH’s response is to turn its back
on its duties and attempt to foist the blame entirely on the shoulders of the Company and the
Individual Defendants.
The Auditor continues its “blame the Company” theme by complaining that Plaintiff fails
to identify “a single document that EKS&H was aware of that showed its opinion on the
financial statements was in error.” (Br. at 4). Putting aside that such a contention ignores that
severe recklessness constitutes scienter in this Circuit and actual knowledge need not be show,
this argument also blatantly ignores the auditor’s basic due diligence obligations. Without a
shred of discovery, Plaintiff has managed through its informal investigation to uncover crucial
documentation and sources that leave little to the imagination here. The detailed allegations of a
massive fraud here are undeniable. Even the most cursory review by the Auditor in the course of
its duties – heightened here in the face of the numerous red flags – could not have been
conducted without either uncovering the fraud or being severely reckless in failing to do so:
under either scenario, the auditor is adequately alleged to have violated Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act.
In the end, the Auditor is reduced to attempting to distort this Court’s order to mean that
because the operative Complaint is 67 pages (down from 112 pages), this is somehow still too
long and improper, without regard to the fact that Plaintiff has fundamentally restructured the
pleading in accordance with the Court’s instructions to make clear that the Complaint plainly
meets the requirements of the PSLRA, Rule 9(b), and Rule 8.5

5

After attempting to discount the operative pleading as mere “cosmetic changes” and the elimination of “fluff”
(EKSH Br. at 2), the Auditor sets forth a table purporting to compare the Stricken Complaint to the operative

4

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 107

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 6 of 20

Finally, EKSH seems to suggest that individual reliance must be pleaded here, and that
somehow whether or not Plaintiff has personally reviewed Whitney’s filings is relevant. This is
plainly wrong. Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that Whitney stock trades on an efficient market
and that the fraud on the market doctrine applies, triggering the presumption of reliance. Basic,
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988).6
For these reasons and those more fully stated below, EKSH has failed to carry its heavy
burden under Section 12(b)(6) and, therefore, this Court should deny EKSH’s motion.
ARGUMENT
I. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS
In entertaining a motion to dismiss, this Court must construe the complaint in the light
most favorable to the plaintiff and accept the factual allegations as true. SEC v. ESM Group, Inc.,
835 F.2d 270, 272 (11th Cir. 1988). As such, a complaint must merely allege facts sufficient “to
raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955,
1964-65 (2007). Somewhat surprisingly, the Auditor does not even set forth this heavy pleading
standard in its motion.
In order to plead a viable Section 10(b) claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) a material
misrepresentation (or omission); (2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a
security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo,
Complaint. While highlighting the addition of a Table of Contents and mischaracterizing changes to sections of the
pleading, the table fails to acknowledge the fundamental restructuring of the pleading that specifically ties each
element of the Section 10(b) claim to the facts needed to plead it adequately in accordance with Rule 9(b) and the
PSLRA as mandated by the Court’s Order. The Table also notes that the Complaint does not contain the previously
pleaded subject matter jurisdiction language. While the Auditor actually acknowledges this is probably a mere
oversight (Plaintiff proffers that it was indeed a word processing error that could be readily cured), no defendant
actually contends that subject matter jurisdiction is not present here. Nevertheless, Plaintiff apologizes for the error.
6
EKSH also argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege loss causation when the Complaint makes clear that in
reaction to the revelations of the fraud through a series of partial disclosures during the Class Period, the price of
Whitney shares plummeted 55%. This is more than sufficient to meet the applicable notice pleading requirements of
Rule 8. Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 (2005). The causation argument is addressed in detail in the
Co. Opp. and is incorporated by reference herein and, for the sake of efficiency, not repeated here.

544 U.S. 336 (2005).
Further, in regard to scienter, allegations of a 10(b) claim will survive a motion to dismiss
“if a reasonable person would deem the inference cogent and at least as compelling as any
opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2510. Thus, if
the inferences properly drawn from the facts are in “equipoise,” (id. at 2514), the scienter
allegations will survive a 12(b)(6) motion.
II. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING
STATEMENTS AND/OR OMISSIONS BY THE AUDITOR
Notwithstanding EKSH’s contrary mischaracterizations, the Complaint alleges – in
accordance with the particularity required by the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) – that EKSH made false
and misleading statements during the Class Period in violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides that “in all averments of fraud or mistake, the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.” Fed. R. Civ. P.
9(b); see also Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 116 F.3d 1364, 1371 (11th Cir. 1997) (noting
that Rule 9(b) may be satisfied by a “list containing allegations of fraud describing nature and
subject of statements found to be sufficient, even where precise words used were not alleged”)
(citation omitted).
The pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) are met where, as here, the complaint: identifies
the alleged material misstatements made by the Auditor, which where included in the Company’s
filings with the Auditor’s permission; and sets forth why the auditor’s statements are allegedly
false and misleading. See, e.g., In re Sunterra Corp. Sec. Litig., 199 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1331-32
(M.D. Fla. 2002).
Plaintiff has complied with Rule 9(b) because the Complaint states in which documents
EKSH made false and misleading statements, the nature of those statements, the date the

6

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 107

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 8 of 20

documents were filed or published, where those documents were filed or published, and how
EKSH’s statements contained therein were misleading. See, e.g., Garfield v. NDC HealthCorp,
466 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir. 2006). For example, the Complaint alleges that EKSH:
•

signed an Independent Auditors Report certifying the veracity and completeness
of the Company’s SEC filings made during the Class Period, ¶ 13;

•

provided letters of consent and/or made representations regarding the accuracy
and completeness of filings made by the Company with the SEC, including but
not limited to Whitney’s materially false and misleading Registration Statement
filed with, but not approved by, the SEC in connection with the attempted sale
and offering of over $33 million in EduTrades public offering stock, ¶ 14;

•

provided reports for the Company’s 2005 Form 10-K and January 11, 2006 Form
S-1 which stated EKSH’s opinion that “the consolidated financial statements . . .
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Whitney
Information Network, Inc. and Subsidiaries” in conformity with GAAP, ¶ 82.
With regard to the materially false and misleading nature of EKSH’s statements and

omissions, the mere existence of a restatement is sufficient to show that EKSH's made materially
false statements in the Company's financial statements. "Pursuant to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), previously issued financial statements should be restated only
to correct material accounting errors that existed at the time the statements were originally
issued.” In re Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig., 324 F. Supp. 2d 474, 486 (S.D.N.Y.
2004). The fact that financial results were restated at all is sufficient to establish falsity at this
stage. Id. at 486-87 (citing In re Cylink Sec. Litig., 178 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1084 (N.D. Cal. 2001);
See also In re Bio-Technology Gen. Corp. Sec. Litig., 380 F. Supp. 2d 574, 586 (D.N.J. 2005)
("Plaintiff has adequately alleged a restatement of the 1999 sale and 2001 repurchase, a fact
which in itself establishes the falsity of the original statements for purposes of surviving a
motion to dismiss."); In re FirstEnergy Corp. Sec. Litig., 316 F. Supp. 2d 581, 595 (N.D. Ohio
2004) (citing case where the court assumed that the need for a restatement demonstrated the

7

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 107

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 9 of 20

falsity of the prior statement even if it did not, alone, plead the requisite scienter. "Such an
assumption is logical since the purpose of a restatement is to correct an error in a previouslyissued financial statement. By definition then, a restatement says that the prior financial
statement was false.")
In the Company’s 2005 Form 10-K, which was subsequently restated, EKSH made
materially false and/or misleading statements that it had audited Whitney's consolidated financial
statements and that those statements fairly represented the financial position of the Company as
of the year end of 2005 and 2004. Complaint, ¶82. EKSH also stated in the 10-K that Whitney's
results of operations and cash flows for the three years ending December 31, 2005 were in
conformity with GAAP. Id. Each of these statements was materially false and misleading, as
evidenced by the fact that every financial statement referred to and audited by EKSH had to be
restated, including the 2005 Form 10-K, which was issued during the Class Period. See, e.g.
Complaint, ¶¶88-92.
EKSH heavily relies upon Ziemba v. Cascade International, Inc., 256 F.3d 1194 (11th
Cir. 2001), to support its position that the Auditor should not be held liable for its materially
false and misleading statements and omissions here. Unfortunately for EKSH, this case could
not be more inapplicable on the core issue, which is why EKSH disingenuously ignores the
crucial facts, including that the auditor in Ziemba did not even hold itself out to the public as the
company’s auditor and never made a single statement about the financial condition of the
company. As noted by the Eleventh Circuit:
In dismissing Plaintiffs' § 10(b) primary liability claims against C&L, the district
court concluded that, because Plaintiffs did not allege that C&L's audit reports of
Fran's Fashions or Conston contained material misrepresentations or omissions,
nor did Plaintiffs allege that C&L made assurances to the public about the
accuracy of Cascade's financial statements, the only alleged activity of C&L that
might possibly give rise to primary liability was C&L's failure to disclose that
8

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 107

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 10 of 20

Cascade's 1991 10-K was misleading. However, the district court concluded that
C&L had no duty to disclose the Cascade fraud, because "C&L did not hold
itself out as Cascade's auditor and never made a public statement about the
financial condition of Cascade."
Ziemba v. Cascade International, Inc., 256 F.3d 1194, 1203 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting In re
Cascade Int'l Sec. Litig., 894 F. Supp. 437, 443 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (emphasis added). What’s
more, the allegations against the auditors in the Ziemba are distinguishable in degree and kind
from those of the Complaint levied against ESKH. As noted by the Eleventh Circuit:
Plaintiffs' allegations concerning C&L fall into three categories: (1) misadvising
Cascade that its financial results did not need to be consolidated with those of
Conston; (2) failing to include "going concern" qualifications in its audit reports
of Conston and Fran's Fashions; and (3) failing to disclose the fraud allegedly
suggested by Cascade's 1991 10-K.
Id.
Unlike the Ziemba complaint, the Complaint alleges that EKSH itself made materially
false and misleading statements in the Company’s pubic disclosures. Complaint, ¶ 82 (noting
that EKSH made false public disclosures regarding the Company’s financial position and
compliance with GAAP in the Company’s 2005 Form 10-K and January 2006 S-1). As such,
this case is clearly distinguishable from Ziemba in which the auditor “never made a public
statement about the financial condition of Cascade.” Id. (emphasis added). Moreover, the
substantial and detailed fraud alleged against ESKH goes well beyond the failure of an auditor to
disclose that Company’s 10-K “was misleading,” which the Ziemba district court found to be
“the only alleged activity of C&L that might possibly give rise to primary liability.” In re
Cascade Int'l Sec. Litig., 894 F. Supp. at 443 (emphasis added).
Accordingly, Plaintiff has complied with the mandates of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA in
pleading with particularity the material falsity of the statements and omissions made by ESKH.

Similarly, with regard to scienter, the adequacy of Plaintiff’s allegations is addressed in Section
III below.
III. PLAINTIFFS HAVE ADEQUATELY PLEADED THE AUDITOR’S SCIENTER
The Complaint adequately pleads that EKSH’s false and misleading statements during
the Class Period were made with scienter. As previously noted, to establish a 10(b) violation in
the Eleventh Circuit, the complaint when taken as a whole, as required by Tellabs, need only
give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted in a “severely reckless” manner. Garfield,
466 F.3d 1264 (citations omitted). Extreme departures from the standards of ordinary care, such
as those identified by the Amended Complaint, “present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers
which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware
of it.” See id. (citations omitted).
Moreover, while EKSH attempts to minimize the affect of the presence of pervasive
GAAP and SEC violations on its state of mind, the weight of authority suggests that such
pervasive violations constitute reliable indicia of scienter.7 As noted by the Eleventh Circuit,
“red flags, combined with alleged violations of GAAS or GAAP may be enough to establish the
requisite level scienter.” Garfield, 466 F.3d at 1267-68 (citations omitted).8
Because Plaintiff alleges a myriad of red flags sufficient to alert EKSH to Company and
Individual Defendants’ fraud, coupled with persistent and pervasive violations of GAAP, the
Complaint met this Circuit’s requirements for pleading scienter under the PSLRA. As an initial
7

See Takara Trust v. Molex Inc., 429 F. Supp. 2d 960, 980 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (indicating that GAAP violation may
support inference of scienter); Lewin v. Lipper Convertibles, L.P., No. 03 CV 1117RO, 2004 WL 1077930, at *2
(S.D.N.Y., May 13, 2004) (holding that accounting violations on repeated and pervasive scale could provide
evidence of recklessness on part of PricewaterhouseCoopers); In re Microstrategy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 115 F. Supp. 2d
620, 651 (E.D. Va. 2000); In re Baan Co. Sec. Litig., 103 F. Supp. 2d 1, 21 (D.D.C. 2000); In re Livent, Inc. Sec.
Litig., 78 F. Supp. 2d 194, 217 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Carley Capital Group v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 27 F. Supp. 2d
1324, 1339 (N.D. Ga. 1998).
8
As noted by the Garfield court, red flags are “those facts which come to the attention of an auditor which would
place a reasonable auditor on notice that the audited company was engaged in wrongdoing to the detriment of its
investors.” Garfield, 466 F.3d at 1264 (quoting Sunterra, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 1334).

Page 12 of 20

matter, EKSH only became Whitney’s auditor in February 2001 following a six month period
during which the Company juggled accounting firms and faced massive financial restatements.
Immediately preceding ESKH’s retention, the Company disclosed in its August 2, 2000 8-K that
it would be terminating its long-time auditor, Larry Legel, CPA, in order to retain a “larger
firm,” BDO Seidman. See Miller Decl. Exh. A. However, only months later, the Company
announced in its November 21, 2008 8-K that it would be terminating BDO Seidman. Miller
Decl. Exh. B.
Immediately preceding EKSH’s hiring, the Company announced on December 5, 2000
that it would be forced to restate its quarterly and year end financial statements for 1998 and
1999, and its 2000 quarterly statements through September 30, 2000. See Miller Decl, Exh. C.
This restatement, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $ 12,000,000, was
needed, in part, to reflect as period costs “expenses giving rise to deferred revenues that were
previously capitalized.” Id. What’s more, despite the presence of these glaring red flags, EKSH
now claims that it had no reason to suspect or be aware of the accounting violations in the
financial statements it audited – even those errors related to the accounting for deferred revenues.
These events immediately preceding the hiring of EKSH, and the pervasive and persistent GAAP
violations identified by the Complaint, were sufficient to “place a reasonable auditor on notice
that the audited company was engaged in wrongdoing to the detriment of its investors.” Garfield,
466 F.3d at 1264 (quoting Sunterra, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 1334).
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Complaint alleges, inter alia, the following additional
red flags that, together with the numerous GAAP violations, constitute further strong indicia of
EKSH’s scienter:
•

Material Weakness and Lack of Internal Controls—By early 2005, EKSH

11

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 107

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 13 of 20

acknowledged that it was aware of material weakness relating to insufficient human
resources dedicated to accounting and financial reporting. ¶ 78.9 Again, the Company’s
1Q:06 Form 10-Q acknowledged that it had “several material weaknesses” in its “internal
control over financial reporting.” Complaint, ¶ 84. The Company’s “personnel lacked
sufficient knowledge and experience and did not have appropriate oversight, its
“accounting department [] experienced significant turnover at various levels,” and its
“disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.” ¶ 83. EKSH was Whitney’s
accountant and auditor for over five years before these revelations were made to the
public.
•

Extraordinary Amounts of Refunds and Chargebacks—For the first half of 2004,
Whitney’s Regulatory Compliance Department issued $11 million in refunds and
incurred $1 million in customer chargebacks. ¶ 50. Such massive quantities of returns
indicate clear customer dissatisfaction with the Company, resulting in huge changes to
income. Further, the meteoric rise in the number of chargebacks as compared to
preceding years, as well as the fact that the Company was required to increase its
Merchant Reserves by millions of dollars, should have been an indication to EKSH, or
any reasonable auditor, that the Company was not adequately processing or allowing
returns, evidencing both the problems with the Company’s business model and the

investigated; a New York Times exposé on the Company; and a Grand Jury investigation
revealed that the trading records of the Company’s Director of Corporate
Communication, Richard O’Dor, did not substantiate claims he made in the press. ¶¶ 142,

•

Improper Recording of Deferred Income—Whitney manipulated the Company’s
reported “Deferred Income” by deferring recording revenue on “camps” and “mentoring”
but failing to defer revenue for “coaching services.” ¶¶ 27, 57, 69, 73-75, 124.

•

The Company’s Zero Refund Return Policy and Chargeback Schemes—Whitney
had a zero-refund policy designed to obfuscate and thwart customer refund and
chargeback requests. ¶¶ 23, 120. The Company’s Merchant Account Transaction
Analysis reports revealed “out of control” chargeback rates as a result of the Company’s
zero-refund policy. ¶¶ 119-120. Merchant banks were facing significant exposure as a
result of their relationship with Whitney, putting the Company’s merchant accounts at
risk and resulting in a number of terminated merchant accounts. ¶¶ 119-120.
In addition to these glaring red flags, the Complaint enumerates extensive and substantial

violations of specific GAAP provisions, SEC rules and regulations, and fair financial reporting
principles. ¶¶ 111-114. Though EKSH attempts to maintain that the Complaint does not allege
“a single violation of the standards that apply to auditors,” in reality, it is for these violations,
which EKSH either concealed or was severely reckless in failing to discover after five years as
the Company’s auditor, that the Company was forced to restate five years of its financials—from
2001 through and including 2005. ¶ 89. Importantly, this extensive restatement spanned the
entire period for which EKSH served as the Company’s Auditor. As noted above, allegations of
GAAP violations “when combined with a drastic overstatement of financial results can give rise

13

to a strong inference of scienter.” Sunterra, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 1335 (quoting Carley Capital, 27
F. Supp. 2d at 1339).
Where Plaintiff has alleged the Company was a complete sham—starting with Russ
Whitney's fabricated background and experience and concealing his status as a convicted felon,
through the bogus products forced on unwitting consumers, to the zero refund policy, GAAP
violations, manipulations of revenue recognition requiring restatements, and suspiciously-timed
departures of no fewer than six Company executives (including the Audit Committee Chair) after
announcements including that the Company had received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the
United States Attorney notifying the Company that it was being investigated—Plaintiff's scienter
allegations as to EKSH—are cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference.
Contrary to the characterizations of ESKH, In re Recoton Corp. Sec. Litig. does not stand
for the proposition that in order to met the Eleventh Circuit’s standard of “severely reckless” for
pleading scienter Plaintiff must plead that ESKH, or one of its employees, had specific
knowledge of fraud perpetrated by the Company or the Individual Defendants. See EKSH Br. at
9. EKSH’s attempts to misinterpret In re Recoton Corp. Sec. Litig., 358 F. Supp. 2d 1130, to
create a heightened “knowledge only” standard for pleading scienter for auditor defendants under
the PSLRA fails. Such a reading is unsupported by the decision itself and flies in the face of
controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent as well as the PSLRA. Plaintiff must merely “plead
scienter with particular facts that give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted in a
severely reckless manner.” Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., 466 F.3d 1255, 1264 (11th Cir. 2006).
Moreover, legal scholars have roundly rejected attempts to read into the PSLRA’s
recklessness requirement for scienter an actual knowledge or intent standard for pleading auditor
scienter as one lacking any legitimate precedential support and contrary to express language of

14

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

the PSLRA. See Gideon Mark, Accounting Fraud: Pleading Scienter of Auditors Under the
PSLRA, 39 Conn. L. Rev. 1097, 1099 (Feb. 2007) (“The adoption of an elevated standard for
pleading scienter of auditors is unjustified. The express language of the PSLRA does not provide
for such a standard, and no compelling policy justification has been advanced by those courts
that have, in effect, rewritten the statute. The widespread use of a standard that equates
recklessness with intent is particularly suspect. Many courts adopting this standard cite Second
Circuit precedent, but the relevant line of cases is weak. A careful parsing of the original source
of the line discloses only weak support for the holding that is so often cited. Even the parallel
standard-that the audit amounted to no audit at all-is unjustified. In the absence of sound policy
reasons to the contrary, external auditors should be held to the same recklessness standard that
other defendants are held to. That standard, as applied to auditors, should not require that
plaintiffs allege and prove that, in effect, no audit was conducted. Such a requirement subverts
the meaning of recklessness.”)
As illustrated by the preceding discussion, the competing inference, that EKSH somehow
was not severely reckless in failing to identify the alleged fraud after five years on the job as
Auditor, after undertaking employment following a suspicious shuffling of accountants and
drastic restatements and working under circumstances in which the Company faced massive
return and chargeback amounts, improperly recorded income in a gross failure to comply with
GAAP and identified material weaknesses and lack of internal controls, is simply not plausible.
As the Complaint make clear, EKSH either purposefully concealed from the public or was
severely reckless in disregarding these “red flags” when it made materially false and misleading
public statements regarding the Company’s financial condition. As such, the inference that
EKSH was severely reckless in making its materially false and misleading statements regarding

15

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 107

Filed 03/13/2009

Page 17 of 20

the financial condition of the Company and compliance with GAAP is, at a minimum, cogent
and at least as compelling as any competing inference, as Tellabs requires. See also Garfield,
466 F.3d at 1267-68 (citations omitted).
IV. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT ADEQUATELY PLEADS RELIANCE
In Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988), the Supreme Court held that reliance for
a Section 10(b) claim may be shown through the fraud on the market doctrine, whereby “reliance
of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed” when defendants’
misrepresentations or omissions have been “disseminated into an impersonal, well-developed
market for securities.” Id. at 247. See also Stoneridge, 128 S. Ct. 761 (under the fraud on the
market doctrine, “reliance is presumed when the statements at issue become public”); Lipton v.
Documation, Inc., 734 F.2d 740, 747-48 (11th Cir. 1984) (“[R]eliance may be presumed where
securities are traded on the open market, subject to the defendant proving that the
misrepresentations were not material or that the plaintiff’s decision to purchase was or would
have been unaffected if he had known the true facts.”). The Complaint adequately pleads
reliance in accordance with these governing principles. See Complaint at Section VIII, ¶¶155158 (alleging that the market for Whitney’s common stock was efficient and promptly digested
current information from all publicly available sources and that all class members suffered
similar injury through their purchase of Whitney common stock at artificially inflated prices and
a presumption of reliance applies).
The Auditor once again reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of basic principles of
reliance in a securities class action, including the applicability of the fraud on the market
doctrine, and appears to believe that individual reliance by Plaintiff must be shown. See, e.g.,
Br. at 8 (“the [Complaint] also fails to allege that Plaintiffs were misled by EKS&H’s actions.
No reliance on EKS&H’s actions is alleged whatsoever. If Plaintiff’s allegations here were
16

sufficient to satisfy the fourth requirement [providing that plaintiff alleges what the defendants
obtained as a consequence of the fraud] then plaintiffs in every case would satisfy the fourth
requirement by merely alleging that the auditors didn’t perform their audit for free.”). As noted
above, the Supreme Court has clearly held otherwise.
V. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT COMPLIES WITH THE COURT’S ORDER
Notwithstanding EKSH’s sporadic representations to the contrary, the Complaint
adequately lays out the nexus between the acts of EKSH and the elements of the fraud alleged:
the Complaint alleges that the Auditor made material misstatements and/or omissions of material
fact; with scienter (knowledge or extreme recklessness that the statements or omissions were
false when made); upon which Plaintiff relied; causing damages to Plaintiff. ¶¶12-16, 82, 87.
140-158.
To provide an example, with regard to the Auditor’s making of materially false and
misleading statements and/or omissions during the Class Period, the Complaint alleges that in the
Company’s 2005 Form 10-K and January 2006 S-1, EKSH falsely disclosed that “‘the
consolidated financial statements . . . present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Whitney Information Network, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ in conformity with GAAP[.]”
Complaint, ¶ 82. In addition, the Complaint alleges why EKSH’s statement was false, i.e.,
because the Company’s “financial statements did not comply with GAAP and SEC rules
because, inter alia, revenue was improperly and prematurely recognized, and that rather than
providing full, fair, and accurate disclosures,” Defendants concealed the true condition of the
Company. Complaint, ¶ 87. Further, the Complaint alleges that EKSH made such
“representations regarding the accuracy and the completeness of filings made by the Company
with the SEC” and that by virtue of this role EKSH “had access to the adverse undisclosed

17

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 19 of 20

information about Whitney’s business prospects and financial condition and performance.”
¶¶13-16... Moreover, the Complaint charges that the economic loss suffered by Plaintiff and the
Class was a direct result of Defendants’ fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the price of
Whitney’s stock and the subsequent significant decline in the value of the Company’s shares
when Defendants’ prior misstatements was revealed. Complaint, ¶¶ 144-154. Finally, the
Complaint adequately alleges reliance. ¶¶155-158.
In the face of such specific allegations, EKSH cannot hide behind its mischaracterization
of the Complaint and maintain that “[t]hey have not specified which alleged misrepresentations
or omission are attributed to EKS&H, and how those alleged misrepresentations or omissions are
causally connected to Plaintiff’s alleged damages.” (Dkt. 103, pg. 7).
Moreover, while EKSH asserts that dismissal of the Complaint is proper under Wagner v.
First Horizon Pharm. Corp., 464 F.3d 1237 (11th Cir. 2006), EKSH’s fails to even muster an
argument relevant to the holding in that case.10 In accordance with this Court’s Order and the
requirements of Wagner, the Complaint clearly links its pointed allegations to the only cause of
action alleged against EKSH. Thus, the Complaint sufficiently links the specific allegations
against EKSH to the claims asserted, and EKSH has failed to carry its burden in demonstrating
that, after accepting all well pleaded allegations of the Complaint as true, there exists no
possibility for relief. Accordingly, this Court should deny EKSH’s Motion.

10

In fact, in addressing Wagner in its prior motion to dismiss brief, EKSH block quoted several lines of discussion
regarding the Court’s assessment that the paragraphs were not connected to the otherwise generally pled claims in
any meaningful way” and omitted the crucial language that the “concern we address today is structural and does
not express an opinion on the merits of the claim.” Wagner, 464 at 1279. Prior Br. at 10. In light of such
misleading tactics, it is difficult to take EKSH’s other legal arguments at face value.

In the event that this Court determines that any portion of this Complaint should be dismissed, Plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to replead pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). EKSH’s request that the Court not grant
leave to amend fails to cite a single case and falsely claims that Plaintiff has had “several years to develop” their
case. EKSH Br. at 25. In truth, Lead Plaintiff was appointed on April 25, 2007, and no motion to dismiss has been
granted. “The Eleventh Circuit requires leave to amend be granted where a more carefully drafted complaint might
state a claim.” Garfield, 466 F.3d at 1271.
