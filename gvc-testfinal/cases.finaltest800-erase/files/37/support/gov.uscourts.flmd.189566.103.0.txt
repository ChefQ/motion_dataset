Introduction

Plaintiffs filed this purported securities fraud class action against Whitney Information
Network, Inc. (“Whitney” or the “Company”), six current or former officers or directors (the
“Individual Defendants”) (collectively the “Whitney Defendants”), and EKS&H, Whitney’s
independent auditors, alleging violations of §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
U.S.C. §78(a) et seq., (“the 1934 Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5.1 2
In its Order of November 17, 2008 [Dkt. 95] (“Dismissal Order”), this Court struck the
[First] Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (“FAC”) due to pleading problems that
have long concerned the Eleventh Circuit and the U.S. Congress in securities fraud cases.
Specifically,
[w]hile Plaintiff’s Complaint is very long and very detailed, Plaintiff fails to
connect the relevant facts to the elements of each claim. Therefore, the Court is
unable to determine if Plaintiff has stated a claim with the requisite particularity
required by Rule 9(a) and the PSLRA [Dismissal Order at p. 4].

However, Plaintiffs have not taken the striking of the FAC by this Court, or the repeated
admonitions of the Eleventh Circuit and Act of Congress to heart.

Plaintiffs have again

submitted a complaint that fails to satisfy Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). Despite some cosmetic changes and
elimination of redundancy and fluff, the pleading is as deficient as before under Wagner v. First
Horizon Pharm. Corp., 464 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). In addition,

1

The original Complaint [Dkt. 1] was filed on December 27, 2006. The [First] Consolidated Amended Class Action
Comp laint (“FAC”) [Dkt.36] w as filed o n July 10, 2 007 . The Whitney Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the FAC
on September 28 , 2007 [Dkt. 51] and E KS& H filed its motion to dismiss the FAC and Supplemental Brief on January
7, 20 08 [Dkt. 78] and February 6, 2008 [Dkt. 85] re spectively.

The F AC and the SA C also contain control person liability claims against the Individual Defendants under §20(a) of
the 19 34 A ct.

if the Court gets past the Rule 8 (a) deficiencies, the SAC fails to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P.
9(b) and the PSLRA, warranting dismissal on those grounds .3
II.Summary of the Allegations of the Second Amended Complaint (SAC)4
EKS&H was Whitney’s independent auditor during the periods alleged in the SAC. The
only allegations that mention EKS&H by name or by description (auditors, outside auditors, etc.)
are paragraphs 13, 14, 15, 16, 78, 82 and 114. Essentially, the SAC alleges that EKS&H was
the auditor (¶13); that they were paid for their services (¶13); that they issued opinions on the
financial statements of Whitney (¶¶ 13 and 82); that they provided unspecified letters of consent
or made unspecified “representations regarding the accuracy and completeness of filings made
by the Company with the SEC” (¶14); that at an unspecified time EKS&H reported certain
material weaknesses to Whitney’s Board (¶78); that EKS&H had access to unspecified
documents that showed that the public statements made by the Company were false (¶15); that
EKS&H knew or disregarded with severe recklessness the adverse facts (¶16); and that EKS&H
is liable to the Plaintiff for millions of dollars (¶114). The only factual allegations, as opposed
to legal conclusions, are that EKS&H was the auditor; they were paid for their services; they
issued opinions; and at one point they reported to the Board of Whitney that there were certain
material weaknesses in the internal controls of the Company.
Nowhere in the 67-page, 175-paragraph SAC do Plaintiffs allege any of the following:
(1) a single violation of the standards that apply to auditors (GAAS);
(2) A single violation of the rules or standards of the PCAOB;
3

In addition, in their haste to re-plead and sho rten their a mended com plaint, P laintiffs have com pletely failed to
allege any basis for this court’s subject matter jurisdiction, a facial deficiency which provides grounds for dismissal
under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). W hile EKS& H assumes that this was an oversight of counsel for Plaintiff, asserting
the basis for this Court’s jurisdiction over the claim is essential to meeting basic pleading re quirements in this Court.
4
EK S&H ha s provided a detailed description of the chang es to the SAC and an analysis o f the case law as applied to
those chang es. See section III. D. infra.

(3) a single document that EKS&H was aware of that showed that its opinion on the
financial statements was in error;
(4) a single fact that, if true, would lead to the inference that EKS&H was aware that the
statements identified in the SAC were false; or
(5) a single fact that, if true would lead to the inference that EKS&H acted with any
degree of scienter.
Because the SAC is so woefully deficient and devoid of any factual allegation of
particularized wrongdoing by EKS&H, and any factual allegation leading to an inference of
scienter, the SAC must be dismissed as to EKS&H.
III. Argument
A.

The Second Amended Complaint (SAC) Still Does Not Satisfy the
Pleading Standards of Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 8 and Wagner v. First
Horizon, supra.

As to EKS&H, only the First Claim for Relief (primary liability under § 10(b) of the 1934
Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5) is asserted.

Despite merely being Whitney’s auditor, EKS&H

continues to remain lumped together with all the other Defendants with no differentiation made
as to EKS&H’s specific wrongdoing or specific state of mind.
In its Dismissal Order, the Court analyzed the paragraphs and pages of the FAC,
explaining how the large numbers of paragraphs and pages related to the Wagner, supra,
pleading deficiencies. The SAC does not address the Court’s concerns as applied to EKS&H.
Plaintiffs

are

doing

what

the

Eleventh

Circuit

and

Congress

have

long

lamented—attempting to hide the legal and factual deficiencies in their case against EKS&H in a
morass of vague, conclusory and non specific allegations.
The FAC (Dkt. 34) compares to the SAC (Dkt. 96) as follows:

Comparison of the Allegations contained in the First Amended Complaint (FAC)
and the Second Amended Complaint (SAC)
FAC (Dkt. 34)

SAC (Dkt. 96)

The FAC contained allegations that this Court
has subject matter jurisdiction in this case.
“The Complaint is 112 pages containing 210
paragraphs.” (Dismissal Order at 3.)
“The first count begins with paragraph 197 on
page 106 of the complaint.” (Id.)

The SAC contains no allegations of subject
matter jurisdiction.
The SAC is 67 pages containing 175 numbered
paragraphs.
The first count has moved 180 paragraphs
forward to paragraph 17 on page 7,
immediately following identification of the
parties, and continues on for 153 numbered
paragraphs and 58 pages.
The “repeats and realleges” problem has been
addressed by cramming all the factual
allegations into the first count itself. The SAC
continues to fail to connect the elements of the
claim against EKS&H to the 58 pages and 153
numbered paragraphs of allegations.
The “Overview of the Action” has been
removed as a separate section. Some of the
information formerly stated therein has been
incorporated into ¶ 2 under the “Nature of the
Action” heading. One of the demonstrative
charts has been moved to page 23.
The “Parties” allegations as to EKS&H have
been restated in §§ 13-16 in the SAC. No
factual allegations have been added; however,
Plaintiffs did update their conclusory
allegation of recklessness adding the word
“severe” before the word “reckless” in
paragraph 15, apparently to accommodate
recent case law. Significantly, they do not add
any factual allegations which if true would
support their conclusory assertion.
Plaintiffs have supplied a 2-page Table of
Contents to assist in navigating through the
multitude of factual allegations that have now
been crammed into the first count. EKS&H is
not even mentioned in the Table of Contents.
Plaintiffs have inserted ¶ 17, which
unhelpfully merely recites the elements of a
claim for relief under § 10(b) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 10b-5. Paragraph 17 continues

“Each of the two counts ‘repeats and realleges
each and every allegation contained’ in the
preceding pages.” (Id.) “The complaint also
fails to sufficiently connect the elements of the
claims to the 196 paragraphs of facts preceding
them.” (Id.)
The FAC contained a 12-page “Overview of
the Action” that looked more like an opening
statement at trial—complete with
demonstrative charts—than a proper pleading
under Rule 8(a).
The “Parties” allegations as to EKS&H were
stated in ¶¶ 32-35 of the FAC.

There is no Table of Contents in the FAC.

There is no summary statement setting forth
the elements of a claim for relief under § 10(b)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 in the
FAC.

Each claim contains paragraphs requesting
damages.

to assert that “all Defendants” violated the law
without differentiation of EKS&H from the
others.
There is no prayer for relief at the end of the
first count. The prayer for relief at the end of
the second count seeks damages but does not
sort out responsibility between EKS&H as the
mere auditor of the Company from the others.

The Class Allegations precede both Count and
I and Count II.
The specific allegations as to EKS&H, as
distinguished from the other defendants are
made in ¶¶ 32-35, 71, 95, 96, 103, 177 and
202.

The SAC curiously sandwiches the class action
allegations between the first and second count.
The specific allegations as to EKS&H, as
distinguished from the Individual Defendants
or the Company or “all Defendants” are made
in ¶¶ 13-16, 78, 82, and 114.

As the above table demonstrates, Plaintiffs’ SAC is at best a cosmetic improvement over
the previous pleading. Plaintiffs have again failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) and (3)
and this Court’s Dismissal Order.

Plaintiffs continue to lump EKS&H together with the

Whitney Defendants in terms of alleged misstatements and omission, liability, scienter, loss
causation, and damages. The specific factual allegations as to EKS&H have not changed.
Plaintiffs attempt to state a complaint against all the Defendants except for EKS&H, then merely
allege that EKS&H served as the Company’s auditors, tagging EKS&H generally with all the
conduct alleged against the other Defendants. As discussed in more detail in section III. D.
infra, the seven paragraphs referencing EKS&H do not connect the elements of a §10(b) claim
to the conduct of EKS&H.
It is clear that Plaintiffs have failed to comply with this Court’s Dismissal Order as it
concerns their claim against EKS&H. They have not succinctly connected the relevant facts or
factual allegations with the elements of liability under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act as
to EKS&H.

They have not specified which alleged misrepresentations or omissions are

6

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 7 of 27

attributed to EKS&H, and how those alleged misrepresentations or omissions are causally
connected to Plaintiffs’ alleged damages. Thus, the SAC should be dismissed again under
Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., 464 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006). However, if the
Court determines that the SAC is sufficient to satisfy Wagner, the SAC nevertheless fails to
satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA, and should be dismissed as to EKS&H.
B.

As to EKS&H, the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) Fails to
Comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)

Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) requires the pleader to plead all averments of fraud with particularity.
Ziemba v. Cascade International, Inc., 256 F.3d 1194 (11th Cir. 2001) concerned a purported
securities fraud class action against a public company, its attorneys, and its auditors in which the
attorneys and auditors challenged the sufficiency of the complaint. Ziemba was decided under
Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6). In Ziemba, as in the instant case, the plaintiffs alleged that the auditors
were primary actors – that is, the statements were the statements of the auditor as well as the
other defendants.

In Ziemba, the plaintiffs had two chances to get their pleading right, whereas

the Plaintiffs here are already on their third pleading. The district court for the S.D. of Florida
(Judge Nesbitt) dismissed the securities claims against the attorneys and auditors, and denied
leave to re-plead. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Rule 9(b) is satisfied if the complaint sets forth (1) precisely what statements were
made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made, and
(2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making
(or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, and (3) the content of such
statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the
defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.
Ziemba, 256 F.3d at 1202.
In this case, because of the improper use of the “all Defendants” lumping mechanism, the
SAC fails to satisfy the first and second requirements set forth in Ziemba. The SAC also fails to

7

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 103

Filed 01/30/2009

Page 8 of 27

allege that Plaintiffs were misled by EKS&H’s actions. No reliance on EKS&H’s actions is
alleged whatsoever.

As to the fourth requirement, EKS&H gained nothing more than its

ordinary fees. If Plaintiffs’ allegations here were sufficient to satisfy the fourth requirement,
then plaintiffs in every case would satisfy the fourth requirement by merely alleging that the
auditors didn’t perform their audit for free.
The SAC is much weaker than the complaint that was dismissed with prejudice in
Ziemba. In Ziemba, the complaint at least attempted to allege facts suggesting that: (1) the
auditors were aware of certain red flags; (2) the auditors allegedly violated AICPA auditing
standards; and (3) the auditors allegedly had knowledge (or were reckless in not knowing) of
certain misstatements in the company’s form 10-K. See Ziemba at 1200-1201. None of these
crucial factual allegations are included in the SAC in this case.
In Ziemba, although the court found the complaint lacking, the Ziemba plaintiffs at least
identified some auditing standards that they believed that the auditor had failed to comply with,
which, if followed, would have made the financial statements and the opinion accurate. Ziemba,
256 F.3d at 1208-9. Courts have routinely held that rote allegations of violations of GAAS are
insufficient to prove fraud. In re Sunterra Securities Litigation, 199 F.Supp.2d 1308, 1333
(M.D. Fla. 2002); In Re Faro Technologies Securities Litigation, 534 F.Supp.2d 1248, 1266
(M.D. Fla. 2007). Plaintiffs have not even tried to get over this hurdle and have failed to allege a
single violation of an auditing standard, let alone a violation with enough supporting evidence to
support a charge of fraud.
In Ziemba, the plaintiffs also attempted to point to various “red flags” that the auditor
allegedly ignored when it issued its unqualified audit opinions on the public company. However,
as the Ziemba court pointed out at 256 F.3d at 1210:

8

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 103

Filed 01/30/2009

Page 9 of 27

In this case, however, Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts suggesting actual
awareness by C&L of any fraud. Plaintiffs have pointed to no “tips,” letters, or
conversations raising inferences that C&L knew of any fraud. Furthermore,
Plaintiffs have pointed to no facts suggesting that C&L was severely reckless in
not knowing about any fraud.
Plaintiffs' purported “red flags” consist of C&L's alleged possession of documents
and other information which Plaintiffs allege should have revealed the need for
going concern qualifications in C&L's audit opinions of Fran's Fashions and
Conston. At most, these allegations raise an inference of gross negligence, but not
fraud.
Similarly, in In re Recoton Corp. Sec. Litig., 358 F.Supp.2d 1130 (M.D. Fla. 2005),
Judge Antoon held that claims against the auditors (D&T) were not plead with sufficient
particularity to survive a motion to dismiss in the securities fraud context:
The allegations against D&T fail to plead fraud with sufficient particularity.
Plaintiffs do not cite any documents, testimony or evidence indicating that D & T,
or any particular D&T employee, was informed or participated in Recoton's
alleged wrongdoings. Conclusory allegations that do no more than state that D&T
“would have known,” “knew and ignored,” or “recklessly failed to know” are
insufficient to state a claim under PSLRA and Rule 9(b). In re Sunterra, 199
F.Supp.2d 1308, 1324 (M.D.Fla.2002) (holding that mere allegations of “must
have known” fail to pass muster under the PSLRA). The alleged violations of
GAAP and GAAS are often devoid of factual support and do little more than base
each violation on the assumption that the above-mentioned allegations are true. In
any event, it is well-settled that allegations of GAAP and GAAS violations are
insufficient, by themselves, to state a claim of fraud with particularity. Ziemba,
256 F.3d at 1208-09 (“[A]llegations of violations of GAAS or GAAP, standing
alone, do not satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b).”).
In re Recoton Securities Litigation, supra at 1147.

Accord, Grand Lodge of

Pennsylvania v. Peters, 550 F. Supp.2d 1363, 1371-73 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (Lazzara, J.) (§10(b)
claims dismissed as to auditors for failure to plead requisite particularity and scienter).
The same is true in the instant case. There are no factual allegations in the SAC that even
suggest that EKS&H, or any employee of EKS&H, had any specific knowledge of any fraud
perpetrated by the Company or any of the Individual Defendants. There are no specific factual

9

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 103

Filed 01/30/2009

Page 10 of 27

allegations of any red flags that EKS&H should have picked up on. Conclusory allegations that
EKS&H should have known, without specific instances of how, why, and when EKS&H should
have known, are insufficient.
Similarly, in Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., 466 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir. 2006), the Eleventh
Circuit affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of securities fraud claims against the company’s
auditor pursuant to Rule 9(b). Garfield, at 1262-63. In doing so, the court adopted a commonsense approach to Rule 9(b): “A sufficient level of factual support for a [10(b)] claim may be
found where the circumstances of the fraud are pled in detail. ‘This means the who, what, when,
where, and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper story.’” Garfield, at 1262 (quoting DiLeo
v. Ernst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990)). As was the case in Garfield, Plaintiffs
have failed to plead the “who, what, when, where, and how” as concerns EKS&H.
C. As to EKS&H, the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) Fails to Comply
with the Heightened Pleading Requirements of Scienter Under the
PSLRA.
Rule 9(b) does not require a plaintiff to allege specific facts related to the defendant's
state of mind when the allegedly fraudulent statements were made. But in 1995, as “a check
against abusive litigation by private parties,”5 Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act (“PSLRA”), Pub.L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995), which made two notable
changes to the pleading requirements for securities fraud class actions. First, the PSLRA altered
Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement by mandating that a securities fraud class action complaint
specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons
why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or
omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with
particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.

Page 11 of 27

15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)(B). Second, and more importantly, the PSLRA raised the standard for
pleading scienter. Specifically, in any securities fraud class action
in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the
defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the complaint shall, with respect
to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity
facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required
state of mind.
15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2) (emphasis added). The SAC fails to satisfy this standard as to EKS&H.
In Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., supra, the Supreme Court analyzed the
requirement of a “strong” inference of scienter under the PSLRA, stating:
An inference of fraudulent intent may be plausible, yet less cogent than other,
nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct. To qualify as “strong”
within the intendment of § 21D(b)(2), we hold, an inference of scienter must be
more than merely plausible or reasonable -- it must be cogent and at least as
compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.
Tellabs, 127 S.Ct. at 2404-05.

Here, EKS&H, as auditor, acted in the ordinary course of

business and charged ordinary fees for auditing services. The SAC is devoid entirely of specific
factual allegations as to EKS&H’s state of mind, let alone facts that lead to a cogent and
compelling inference of scienter. The paragraphs that attempt to address the state of mind of the
“defendants” collectively either make conclusory statements that the defendants acted recklessly,
or the specific allegations refer only to the other defendants’ state of mind. (See discussion in
section III. D., infra.) There are simply no factual allegations whatsoever that EKS&H acted
with any degree of recklessness or intent to defraud. As described above, Plaintiffs do not even
allege that EKS&H violated any standards applicable to auditors, let alone violations which were
so extreme as to support a cogent or compelling inference of scienter.6

There are no facts

alleged in the SAC from which this Court could find any inference of scienter, let alone the
6

Various paragraphs of the SAC allege violations of GAAP and “SEC R eporting Rules” by “Defendants;” however,
there are no violations of G AAS or P CAOB standa rds. See Sec tion III. D . infra.

11

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 12 of 27

“strong inference” required by the PSLRA and Tellabs, supra. There is no such cogent and
compelling inference that can be drawn from the SAC. The allegations fall far short of the
requirements of the PSLRA and Tellabs, and the SAC must be dismissed as to EKS&H.
Plaintiffs may attempt to argue that the allegations of scienter regarding the other
defendants apply to EKS&H through some type of scheme liability. If that is their argument, it
fails under the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 128 S.Ct. 761 (2008). In Stoneridge, the Supreme Court held under the
PSLRA that a complaint must clearly allege the specific nature of the deceptive statement,
reliance upon that statement, and a clear causal relationship between the reliance and the alleged
harm. It is not sufficient to merely allege—as do Plaintiffs here—that a defendant participated
in a general scheme to violate §10(b) with others who have made a specific misstatement, or
with others who had a duty to disclose material information but failed to do so. Stoneridge, 128
S.Ct. at 770. Although Stoneridge did not concern the claims brought against the auditors, its
reasoning is equally applicable where, as here, the auditors are merely secondary actors sought
to be held primarily liable, and, in this case, where there are no allegations that the auditors
violated auditing standards. Moreover, the Supreme Court was quite clear in its opinion that
§10(b) claims must comply with the PSLRA’s strict requirements, and the judiciary should
enforce the clear mandates of Congress in determining whether claims meet these strict
requirements.7
In Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., supra, the Eleventh Circuit relied upon the PSLRA as
well as Rule 9(b) in dismissing the case against the company’s auditors. The Garfield court
7

“Congress, in enacting the securities laws, did not intend to provide a broad federal remedy for all fraud.” Stoneridge
at 771; “Section 10b does not incorporate common law fraud into federal law.” Id.; “This restraint is appropriate in light
of the PSLRA , which imposed heightened pleading requirements and a loss causation requirement upo n “any private
action” arising from the Securities Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b).” Stoneridge at 773.

upheld the district court’s dismissal because the “allegations regarding amortization and
capitalization [were] vague and difficult to evaluate,” did “not specify when the improper
accounting occurred,” and failed to allege “how and what products were improperly capitalized
or amortized.” Garfield, 466 F.3d at 1263. The Court found the complaint deficient for lack of
“any detailed allegations of scienter with respect to the alleged misrepresentations.” Id. at 1264.
As to the auditors, the court upheld dismissal on the basis that the general allegations that the
auditors ignored certain “red flags” did nothing more than re-hash general GAAP and GAAS
violations, and did not rise to the level of specificity or scienter required by the PSLRA.
Garfield at 1267-70. “[Plaintiff] may not establish scienter by alleging that the auditor would
have discovered the fraud had it not violated GAAS.” Garfield at 1270, (citing In re Spear &
Jackson Sec. Litig., 399 F.Sup.2d 1350, 1363 (M.D. Fla. 2002) and In re Eagle Bldg. Tech. Inc.
Sec. Litig., 319 F.Supp.2d. 1318, 1328 (S.D. Fla. 2004).8
In a recent Fourth Circuit decision affirming the district court’s dismissal of §10(b) claims
against Deloitte & Touche as a public company’s auditor, the court stated:
Thus, the question is whether the allegations in the complaint viewed in their totality
and in light of all the evidence in the record, allow us to draw a strong inference at
least as compelling as any opposing inference, that the Deloitte defendants either
knowingly or recklessly defrauded investors by issuing false audit opinions in
violation of Rule 10b-5(b) or 10b-5(a) or (c). If we find the inference that defendants
acted innocently or even negligently, more compelling than the inference that they
acted with the requisite scienter, we must affirm. Plaintiffs must show that the
defendants actually made a misrepresentation or omission in their audit opinions on
which investors relied; parties who merely assist another in violating §10(b) are not
liable under §10(b). See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,
Inc., 128 S. Ct. 761 (2008).

Public Employees’ Retirement Association of Colorado v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, __F.3d
__ 2009 WL 19134 at p. 7 (4th Cir. January 5, 2009). Here, there is no doubt, that the inference
drawn from the allegations in the SAC is that EKS&H acted either innocently or, at worst,
negligently, but there is certainly nothing in the SAC which even hints that EKS&H knowingly
or recklessly defrauded investors by issuing false audit opinions.
Plaintiffs may also attempt to argue that the fact that the Company restated its financial
statements is sufficient to show that EKS&H made material misstatements. However, mere
publication of restated financial statements is insufficient to create the strong inference of
scienter required by the PSLRA. In re CP Ships Ltd., Sec. Litig., 506 F.Supp.2d 1161, 1168

numbers, cannot support a securities fraud lawsuit, absent other evidence of scienter.”) Accord,

1.

Sections I, II, and III of the Second Amended Complaint (SAC)

In paragraphs 1-12 of the SAC, Plaintiffs identify various categories of alleged material
misstatements and omissions, and state that they are relying upon “scheme” and “course of
conduct” allegations in order to ensnare EKS&H. Under the authorities cited above, such
allegations are insufficient. Plaintiffs also identify their Lead Plaintiff, through whom all Class
Plaintiffs derive their rights.

In ¶ 13 Plaintiffs allege that EKS&H signed the Independent Auditor’s report certifying
the veracity and completeness of the company’s SEC filings, yet there are no factual allegations
which, if true, would show that EKS&H knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the filings
were allegedly false. Plaintiffs also allege that EKS&H was paid $1.788 million in “purported
accounting fees and expenses.” (Italics added.) Yet, Plaintiffs never follow up their innuendo
with any specific facts to show that the fees and expenses were not legitimate. This is exactly
the type of insufficient pleading that Rule 9(b) was intended to prevent; and when Rule 9(b) was
proved insufficient, the PSLRA was passed as “a check against abusive litigation by private
parties.” There is no “strong inference of scienter” in alleging that an auditing firm received fees
for its services.
In ¶ 14, Plaintiffs allege that EKS&H “provided letters of consent and/or made
representations regarding the accuracy and completeness of [unspecified] filings made by the
Company with the SEC…” The allegations referencing the EduTrades public offering have
nothing to do with the Lead Plaintiff’s claims and should be disregarded per Rule 12(f)(1).
In ¶ 15, Plaintiffs allege generally that EKS&H “participated in the drafting, preparation,
and/or approval” of the offending documents, and that “because of its role, [EKS&H] had access
to the adverse undisclosed information about Whitney’s business prospects and financial
condition” and “knew (or disregarded with severe recklessness) that these adverse facts rendered
the positive representation made by Defendants materially false and misleading.” Again, the
Plaintiffs fail to back up these conclusions with any allegations of fact. Under Tellabs, Ziemba
and the cases cited in section III. B. and C. above, these conclusory allegations are insufficient to
establish fraud as to EKS&H, or scienter on their part.

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

In ¶ 16, Plaintiffs make the conclusory allegation that by virtue of being the auditor
EKS&H

actually

‘controlled’

what

was

disseminated

by the

Company.

These

allegations—which are patently false—are never backed up with particularity, and thus fail to
meet the requirements of 9(b) and the PSLRA. Paragraphs 17 and 18 just list the elements of a §
10(b) claim, and provide a roadmap to the SAC similar to the Table of Contents.
2.

Section IV.A. of the First Count, ¶¶ 19-28.

In this section, Plaintiffs generally describe alleged deceptive actions of the Company
toward its customers. EKS&H is never mentioned by name or description. General allegations
that “Defendants” assured investors that the Company was in compliance with GAAP and SEC
reporting rules is not sufficient to state a claim for securities fraud against an auditing firm.
Plaintiffs also rely upon “confidential witnesses”; however, none of these confidential witnesses
have anything whatsoever to say that implicates EKS&H;9 everything is expressly limited to the
actions of Company employees. The rest of this section describes other alleged wrongdoings of
Whitney, with no specificity as to how EKS&H purportedly violated § 10(b).
3.

Section IV.B. of the First Count, ¶¶ 29-31.

In this section, Plaintiffs generally describe how “Defendants” failed to disclose to the
Company’s potential customers Russ Whitney’s true background, with no allegations that
EKS&H was aware of the purported undisclosed information. There are no allegations that the
Lead Plaintiff reviewed the allegedly false statements or relied upon them.
4.

Section IV.C. of the First Count, ¶¶ 32-42.

9

The Eleventh Circuit addressed the issue of confidential witnesses in Mizzaro v. Hom e Depot, Inc., 544 F.3d 1230,
1239-42 (11 th Cir. 2008) (and dismissing allegations of financial improprieties as against public company for failure
to satisfy particularity requirements under PSLRA Id. at 1247-5 7). See, also, Zucco Pa rtners, LLC v. Digim arc
Corp ., supra at *13, where stateme nts of co nfidential witnesses were held insufficient.

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Document 103

Page 17 of 27

This section generally describes alleged deceptive actions of the Company toward its
customers, with no allegations that in any way implicate EKS&H, or that even involve the Lead
Plaintiff.

These allegations sound more like a class action on behalf of the Company’s

customers than on behalf of the Company’s investors. The only possible link of fraud-againstcustomers to securities fraud is by referring in ¶ 32 to the Company’s Registration Statement, but
there are no factual allegations against EKS&H to support liability under § 10(b).
5.

Section IV.D. of the First Count, ¶¶ 43-57.

In this section, Plaintiffs describe the Company’s Merchant Credit Card Processing and
Chargebacks, noting that the Company’s reserve was raised from 1% to 5%. Plaintiffs attempt
to suggest that the failure to explain this in the August 12, 2005 Form 10-Q was tantamount to
securities fraud.

Plaintiffs fail to allege any reliance by the Lead Plaintiff on the lack of

discussion regarding the chargeback reserve. Plaintiffs fail to allege any duty EKS&H breached
with regard to the chargeback reserve; they don’t even allege here that EKS&H violated GAAS
or other auditing standards. Instead, Plaintiffs attempt to dress up their insufficient allegations
with emotional language such as: “a whopping 500%” (¶ 44); “had reached a crisis level” (¶46);
the “massive sudden spike” (¶47); “illegal refusal to grant refunds” (¶48) [with no explanation
whatsoever as to how the policy was “illegal”]; “the meteoric rise in chargebacks” (¶54).
However, it takes more than colorful language to satisfy Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA.
6.

Section IV.E. of the First Count, ¶¶ 58-69.

In this section, Plaintiffs describe several press releases in which the Company attributed
profits to “an aggressive campaign to test new marketing vehicles and messages,” which “led to
significantly improved response rates,” and a “growing number of individuals who had benefited
in multiple ways from [the Company’s] training and ongoing support. (SAC, ¶¶ 63, 65, and 67.)

First, there are no non-conclusory, specific factual allegations that EKS&H had anything to do
with the making of these statements. Second, there is no specific factual allegation to show that
these statements were false. The Plaintiffs merely allege without any back-up that, in reality,
“Defendants” had “propped up the Company’s results by manipulating Whitney’s accounting for
revenues and income.” (SAC, ¶ 65.) There is no reference to EKS&H as being part of the
alleged propping-up. This is nothing more than a conclusory and speculative allegation with no
facts to support it. There is no showing of loss causation by Plaintiffs, and no strong showing of
scienter on the part of EKS&H.
7.

Section IV.F. of the First Count, ¶¶ 70-75.

In this section, Plaintiffs take issue with the Company’s revenue recognition reporting in
the Company’s financial statements. EKS&H is not mentioned by name or as auditor; there are
no allegations that EKS&H violated GAAS or PCAOB standards with regard to its audit of the
Company’s financial statements.
8.

Section IV.G. of the First Count, ¶¶ 76-87.

This section relates to the Company’s statements regarding its internal controls. This is
the first attempt to link EKS&H (as opposed to “Defendants”) with any purported wrongdoing;
however, the effort to state a claim against EKS&H is an abject failure. Plaintiffs allege, without
any specificity, that the Company was “concealing significant problems” (SAC, ¶ 76) but that
the CEO and CFO evaluated the effectiveness of the internal controls (SAC, ¶ 77) and stated in
the 2Q:05 Form 10-Q that they were effective. In ¶ 78 Plaintiffs admit that EKS&H informed
the Board that “certain material weaknesses existed at Whitney,” and admit in that same ¶78 that
the Company believed it had addressed the concerns raised by EKS&H. These allegations do not
create § 10(b) liability on the part of EKS&H. Paragraph 80 alleges that two of the Company’s

18

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 19 of 27

officers made Sarbanes-Oxley certifications, and ¶ 81 alleges in conclusory and unparticularized
fashion that those officers demonstrated “a complete lack of diligence in ‘reviewing’ the
document being signed.”

Paragraph 82 alleges that EKS&H stated that the consolidated

financial statements fairly presented the Company’s financial position in conformity with
GAAP. However, the SAC does not assert that EKS&H’s statement was false, was made with
scienter, was relied upon by Plaintiffs or caused them any losses.
Paragraphs 85 and 86 concern the Company’s Code of Ethics. Without any specificity,
Plaintiffs declare that the Company violated its Code of Ethics because, in their opinion, “its
entire business model was a sham, premised on the concept of luring unsophisticated students
into signing up for near-worthless and unconscionably-overpriced courses,” etc., etc. However,
without more, these alleged discrepancies between a company’s profession of principles of
“honesty,” “integrity,” etc. and its customer perceptions as to the fairness of its actual business
practices do not become a predicate for suing the company’s auditors for securities fraud.
9.

Section IV.H. of the First Count, ¶¶ 88-92.

This section describes how the Company changed its policy for recognizing revenue and
how it would restate revenues for prior periods. It then asserts without specificity that the
Restatement was materially false because “Defendants” “continued their scheme to abuse its
Deferred Revenue reporting as a method of artificially inflating the Company’s results.”10 No
specific involvement of EKS&H is alleged. No reliance or loss causation is alleged. No strong
inference of scienter on the part of EKS&H is shown.
10

In this paragraph, and throughout the SAC, Plaintiffs refer to the Company’s alleged “artificial inflation of
deferred re venue.” W hile there are no allegations that EKS &H recklessly violated aud iting standards w ith regard to
the company’s recording of deferred revenue, these allegations are curious, at best, as this inflation of deferred
revenue wo uld result in the Comp any over-stating its liab ilities, and the re are no allegations as to ho w this
overstating of liabilities made the Company’s financial statements materially misleading to investors who purchased
the stock in reliance thereon.

Page 20 of 27

Section IV.I. of the First Count, ¶¶ 93-110.

The next 18 numbered paragraphs (8 pages) concern “Defendants’” continuation of
making materially false statements that ultimately boil down to a disagreement with the efficacy
and ethics of the Company’s business model vis-à-vis its customers. No effort is made to
particularize how EKS&H supposedly participated in issuing the various press releases and other
documents described in this section. There are only unsupported allegations that the Company’s
practices did not comply with GAAP and SEC reporting rules, but no details, and no allegations
that EKS&H violated any auditing standards.

There is nothing stated to give rise to any

inference, let alone a strong inference of scienter by EKS&H.
11.

Section IV.J. of the First Count, ¶¶ 111-114.

Here, Plaintiffs recite various provisions of GAAP, and allege that “Defendants” filed
various documents that “Defendants” said complied with GAAP and “SEC Rules.” In ¶ 113,
Plaintiffs again take issue with the efficacy and ethics of the Company’s business model, and
make the unsupported leap that the purported deficiencies in the business model rendered the
Company’s financial statement in violation of GAAP and unspecified SEC Rules. There are no
allegations that EKS&H did not follow generally accepted auditing standards.

Moreover,

Plaintiffs ignore the fact that “allegations of violations of GAAS [had they even so alleged] or
GAAP, standing alone, do not satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b).” Ziemba, 256
F.3d at 1208. Never once do Plaintiffs attempt to point to any “red flags” that arguably would
have converted EKS&H from a mere auditor to a de facto co-conspirator to violate the securities
laws. Rather, they merely allege in ¶ 114 that “Defendants” were manipulating refunds in
violation of their Code of Ethics, that their harsh business practices impacted their revenues, and

20

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

that as auditor, EKS&H should have deemed the financials to be materially false and refused to
state that the financials complied with GAAP.
12.

Section V.A. of the First Count, ¶¶ 115-139.

The next 10 pages and 25 numbered paragraphs is where Plaintiffs supposedly
demonstrate a strong inference of scienter on the part of all “Defendants”. According to the
Table of Contents to the SAC, this is where the allegations to meet the requirements of the
PSLRA are contained. The Table of Contents even has subheadings relating to knowledge,
severe recklessness and motive. The reader will look in vain for any reference to EKS&H in
these sections. There are no allegations that the documents that supposedly establish scienter
were given to EKS&H, that the OSHA Complaint was reviewed by EKS&H, or for that matter,
that EKS&H had any motive other than to provide its professional services. There is absolutely
nothing in the SAC to satisfy the PSLRA’s higher pleading standard with respect to EKS&H. It
is impossible on the allegations before the Court to form a cogent and compelling inference of
scienter on the part of EKS&H. Plaintiffs’ complete failure to address EKS&H in this specific
section amounts to an admission that they have nothing to support a cogent and compelling
inference.
13.

Sections VI., VII., and VIII. of the First Count, ¶¶ 140-158.

Here, Plaintiffs describe the collapse of the market for Company’s shares precipitated by
an SEC investigation and grand jury subpoena. There are no allegations in this section that
relate to compliance with 9(b) or the PSLRA. These allegations attempt to deal with loss
causation and reliance, which EKS&H addresses in section III.E below.
14.

Section IX. of the First Count, ¶¶ 159-164.

Here, Plaintiffs discuss post-Class Period developments. Such events are, by definition,
immaterial and impertinent to this case, and should be ignored under Rule 12(f)(1).
The above discussion demonstrates that the allegations in the SAC do not meet the
requirements of the PLSRA or 9(b) as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Eleventh
Circuit, and thus, the claims against EKS&H must be dismissed.
E. Plaintiffs Fail to Meet §10(b) Reliance and Loss Causation Requirements.
“In a typical 10(b) private action, a plaintiff must prove (1) a material misrepresentation
or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or
omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or
omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.” Stoneridge, supra, at 768, quoting Dura
Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 3451-341 (2005). These elements must also be
sufficiently alleged in the Complaint. Dura Pharmaceuticals at 346-7. Failure to do so requires
the Complaint to be dismissed. Dura at 347. Both Congress in the PSLRA and the Supreme
Court in Dura and Stoneridge made it clear that the Complaint must allege facts that, if true,
show loss causation. See Dura at 347-8; Stoneridge at 770.
Stoneridge dealt with the issue of whether a §10(b) cause of action could be sustained
against a public company’s customers and suppliers who allegedly participated in a “scheme”
with the company concerning the company’s accounting treatment of contracts it had with those
customers/suppliers, but who did not make any alleged misstatements or omissions.11 In
analyzing the requirements of loss causation and economic loss which are tied to the elements of
reliance, the Court stated that: “Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant's deceptive acts is
11

Stoneridge reaffirmed the holding in Central Ban k of Denver, N.A . v. First Interstate Ban k of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S.
164, 191 (1994), as later confirmed by Congress in §104 of the PSLRA, that: “The §10(b) implied private right of action
does not extend to aiders and abettors. The cond uct of a secondary actor must satisfy each of the elements or
preconditions for liability. ...” Stoneridge, supra, at 769.

an essential element of the § 10(b) private cause of action. It ensures that, for liability to arise,
the “requisite causal connection between a defendant's misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s
“injury” exists as a predicate for liability.” Id at 769.
Although Plaintiffs purport to rely on the fraud-on-the market theory of reliance, for the
reasons stated in the Whitney Defendants’ previously filed motion to Dismiss, the fraud on the
market theory does not apply in this case.12 However, despite purported reliance on statements
made in Whitney’s SEC reports, the SAC must be dismissed because the alleged fraudulent
statements are not causally connected to Plaintiffs’ losses. Plaintiffs allege that they relied upon
misleading information about the financial condition of the company but allege that their losses
were caused by two press releases that announce government investigations of Whitney (not
EKS&H) into topics other than the financial statements audited by EKS&H. There are no
allegations in the SAC that any alleged misrepresentations of EKS&H caused any economic loss
to the Plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs claim they suffered damages because between April 2005 and November 2006,
Whitney allegedly filed SEC reports and published press releases containing favorable business
and financial information, but containing material misrepresentations and omissions, causing
Whitney’s common stock price to be artificially inflated.13 Plaintiffs claim the falsity of this

12

The P laintiffs in Stoneridge did not attempt to utilize the fraud-on- the-market theory of reliance. The issue in that
case was whether defendants could be held liable for their participation in the scheme with the company who made
the allegedly false stateme nts upo n which the plaintiffs purported ly relied.
13
As noted in W hitney’s previous Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs ignore the fact the market price did no t fall, but in fact
rose when Whitney announced in May 2006 that it would be restating some o f its earlier financial statem ents to reflect
a change in its revenue reco gnition p olicy.

23

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 24 of 27

information was disclosed in the November and December 2006 press releases announcing an
SEC investigation and a grand jury subpoena, and, as a result, the price of Whitney stock fell. 1 4
However, there is no link between the alleged misrepresentations and the resulting
economic loss. These press releases do not relate at all to the misrepresentations or omissions
purportedly made by any of the Defendants (in particular, EKS&H) upon which Plaintiffs (or the
market) “relied” in establishing the price of Whitney’s common stock. The November and
December press releases cannot be interpreted to “correct” any materially false or misleading
information which could possibly be attributed to any statement alleged to have been made by
EKS&H, as there are no allegations that EKS&H made any specific misstatements or omissions.
There are no allegations, and no facts that would support, that the announcement of an SEC
investigation or the grand jury subpoena related to any alleged misstatements of EKS&H made
during the purported class period. The announcement of the SEC investigation focused on what
the company was telling its students in its seminars and classes – not what the company was
telling the investing public about Whitney’s financial condition. Further, announcement of the
SEC investigation focused on whether the information that Whitney was providing to its students
complied with federal securities laws – it did not focus on whether Whitney, in its SEC reports,
was in compliance with the federal securities laws. Thus, the section of the SAC entitled “The
Truth is Belatedly Revealed” (¶¶ 140-143 on page 55), actually “reveals” an entirely different
“truth” than the one Plaintiffs describe in the previous 139 paragraphs and 54 pages of the SAC.
The matters announced in the SEC investigation and grand jury subpoena have nothing to
do with Plaintiffs’ claims that they were deceived into buying Whitney’s common stock based
14

On January 15, 200 9, W hitney filed its form 10-K for fiscal year end 2007, and its form 10-K/A, containing
restated financial statements for the years 2001-2006 . These restated financial statements do not relate to the
allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, or to revenue recognition. The restated financials do not cure any of
the deficiencies in the Se cond Am ended C omp laint and have no bearing o n this case .

24

Case 2:06-cv-00687-UA-DNF

Page 25 of 27

on false or misleading financial information in the financial statements audited by EKS&H.
There are no specific factual allegations that EKS&H was reckless, or even negligent, in auditing
Whitney’s financial statements. Thus, the November and December 2006 press releases do not
reveal any fraud as alleged to have been perpetrated by EKS&H. There is no connection
between the alleged fraud and Plaintiffs’ losses. Because there is no causal connection to any
statements or omissions of EKS&H relied upon by Plaintiffs and the resulting drop in the stock
price, the SAC fails to meet the loss causation pleading requirements of the PSLRA, and should
be dismissed. See Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 347-8; Stoneridge at 769-70.
IV.Conclusion
Plaintiffs have had three opportunities and several years to develop specific factual
averments that, if true, would support a claim against EKS&H. Rather than taking the decisions
of the Eleventh Circuit and this Court’s order to heart, they have merely moved the pieces
around on the chessboard and not alleged anything new. The SAC is nothing more than a
cosmetic effort to avoid compliance with Rules 8, 9 and the PSLRA. This action, as to EKS&H,
is precisely the type of case that Congress intended to be dismissed at this point in the
proceedings.
Wherefore, Defendant EKS&H respectfully prays that the Second Consolidated
Amended Complaint against EKS&H be dismissed with prejudice.
