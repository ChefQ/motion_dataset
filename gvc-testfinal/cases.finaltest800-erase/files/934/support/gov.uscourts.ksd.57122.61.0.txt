FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS
KICKAPOO TRIBE OF INDIANS OF

KICKAPOO TRIBE IN KANSAS),

Civil Action No. 06-2248-CM-DJW

RESOURCES CONSERVATION
SERVICE, UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,
et al.,
Defendants.

RULE 56(f) MOTION OF THE NON-FEDERAL DEFENDANTS
Introduction
Plaintiff Kickapoo Tribe has filed two partial summary judgment motions in
this case.

Plaintiff filed these motions one week after the Non-Federal

Defendants filed their Answers and the Federal Defendants filed their Motion to
Dismiss; the motions are in key respects based on factual premises that plaintiff
pleaded in its Complaint and that the Non-Federal Defendants denied in their
Answers, either directly or for lack of information. None of the parties has yet
requested or received any discovery, and none has made initial disclosures
under Rule 26; neither has the Court yet held its initial scheduling conference
under Rule 16. Similarly, the Non-Federal Defendants have had no realistic
1

Case 2:06-cv-02248-CM-DJW Document 61 Filed 01/05/07 Page 2 of 9

opportunity to conduct factual and historical research relevant to plaintiff’s
allegations; neither have they been able to retain experts to assist them in
evaluating and rebutting those allegations.
The Non-Federal Defendants therefore cannot now factually rebut, by
affidavits, depositions, or other documents allowable under Rule 56, many of the
key factual premises of plaintiff’s motions. But, as detailed in defense counsel’s
supporting affidavit, attached as Exhibit A to this Motion, it is likely that the
Non-Federal Defendants could appropriately rebut plaintiff’s motions if they
were allowed a reasonable time to complete discovery, conduct factual
investigations, and obtain expert assistance.1
Accordingly, the Non-Federal Defendants move the Court under Rule 56(f)
for an order denying plaintiff’s two partial summary judgment motions (without
prejudice to later renewal), or continuing proceedings on those motions until
after the expiration of the discovery and expert deadlines to be set by the Court
in its forthcoming initial scheduling conference, now set for January 23, 2007.

Plaintiff’s second summary judgment motion appears intended to further
claims that plaintiff asserts against all the Non-Federal Defendants, and is
accordingly opposed by all the Non-Federal Defendants. But plaintiff’s first
summary judgment motion appears intended to further claims that plaintiffs
asserts only against the Nemaha Brown Defendants. The Nemaha Brown
Defendants therefore oppose plaintiff’s first motion, but Conservation
Commission Defendants and the Conservation District Defendants do not now
take a position on that motion. However, the Conservation Commission
Defendants and the Conservation District Defendants reserve their rights to
oppose or support plaintiff’s first motion in the future should they become aware
of reasons that would justify them in doing so.

The Standards Applicable to Rule 56(f) Motions
When, as in the present case, a party moves for summary judgment near the
beginning of the case, before discovery has even started, Rule 56(f) affords the
parties opposing summary judgment a means of obtaining enough time for
discovery and investigation to allow them to compile an adequate factual record
in opposition to the motion. See, e.g., 11 Moore’s Federal Practice § 56.10[8][a] (3d.
Ed. 2006), p. 56-83. Indeed, “[t]he district courts have a duty under Rule 56(f) to
ensure that the parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to make their
record complete before ruling on a motion for summary judgment,” id., and
“summary judgment [should] be refused where the nonmoving party has not
had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition.”
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 250 n.5 (1986).
That is not to say that discovery is absolutely necessary before summary
judgment; a party can lose its Rule 56(f) opportunity if it does not file a timely
motion under that rule or if it does not supports its motion with an affidavit that
explains how additional time will allow it to rebut its opponent’s factual
averments. See Moore’s, supra, p. 56-83 & n. 16; Anderson at 250 n.5. But in cases
such as this one, in which the parties opposing summary judgment have timely
filed a Rule 56(f) motion and have explained and supported that motion with a
detailed sworn affidavit, the Rule 56(f) motion should ordinarily be granted,
absent evident bad faith, dilatory conduct, or futility. See, e.g., Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (Rule 56 contemplates the entry of summary
judgment only after adequate time for discovery); Committee for the First
Amendment v. Campbell, 962 F.2d 1517, 1522 (10th Cir. 1992) (Rule 56(f) motions
should be “liberally treated” unless they are “dilatory or lacking in merit”);

Burlington Northern Santa Fe N. R. Co. v. Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of the Ft. Peck
Reservation, 323 F.3d 767, 773 (9th Cir. 2003) (When a summary judgment motion
is filed early in litigation, before the opposing party has had a realistic
opportunity to pursue discovery, “district courts should grant any Rule 56(f)
motion fairly freely”); Wichita Falls Office Assocs. v. Banc One Corp., 978 F.2d 915
(5th Cir. 1992) (When a party files a Rule 56(f) motion to obtain discovery
germane to a pending summary judgment motion, “it is inequitable to pull out
the rug from under them” by denying their Rule 56(f) motion), cert. denied, 508
U.S. 910 (1993); International Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally’s Inc. 939 F.2d 1257, 1267 (5th
Cir. 1991) (Rule 56(f) motion seeking additional discovery “should be granted
almost as a matter of course” unless the party seeking additional discovery has
not been diligent in seeking to discover the relevant evidence), cert. denied, 502
U.S. 1059 (1992).
Plaintiff’s First Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
In its first motion plaintiff seeks an order requiring defendant Nemaha
Brown to specifically perform its alleged 1994 promise to condemn land required
for the Plum Creek reservoir plaintiff wishes to construct on its reservation. See
Doc. No. 42, Plaintiff’s First Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and Doc. No.
43, Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s First Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment (both filed November 7, 2006). Plaintiff filed this first summary
judgment motion exactly one week after the Non-Federal Defendants filed their
Answers (Docs. Nos. 37 and 38, filed October 31, 2006) and the Federal
Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 39, filed October 31, 2006).
No party has yet taken any discovery in this case, nor made any initial Rule 26
disclosures. And the Court has not yet held its initial scheduling conference
4

Case 2:06-cv-02248-CM-DJW Document 61 Filed 01/05/07 Page 5 of 9

under Rule 16; that initial conference is now scheduled to be held by telephone
on January 23, 2007.
Moreover, in distinct contrast to plaintiff, who before filing this suit
obtained reams of documents from the defendants through requests under the
Kansas Open Records Act and the federal Freedom of Information Act, and
thereby obtained a head start of many months in collecting facts to support its
present claims, the Non-Federal Defendants have as yet directed no counterpart
requests for information to plaintiff or to the Federal Defendants.
And most important of all, as further explained in the supporting Affidavit
of defense counsel and foreshadowed in the Answers on file, the Non-Federal
defendants already have information that tends to refute key factual bases for
plaintiff’s first motion. Specifically, that information suggests that plaintiff is
incorrect in asserting that Nemaha Brown promised to condemn land for the
Plum Creek reservoir, that plaintiff relied on any such promise, that the federal
defendants and Congress approved the 1994 agreement only because they
understood Nemaha Brown to have made such a promise, or that no
economically satisfactory alternative means of providing plaintiff with water
exists, so only specific performance can provide plaintiff an adequate remedy for
Nemaha Brown’s ostensible promise-breaking.

To be sure, the Non-Federal

Defendants cannot now present their contrary evidence; their information is
inadmissible at the moment, because it is not in the form of an affidavit,
deposition, or other format recognized under Rule 56. But it is likely that the
Non-Federal Defendants will be able to present the same factual information, but
in an appropriate affidavit or deposition form admissible under Rule 56, if they
are allowed to conduct discovery. It would be inequitable in the extreme to grant
5

Case 2:06-cv-02248-CM-DJW Document 61 Filed 01/05/07 Page 6 of 9

plaintiff summary judgment without affording the Non-Federal Defendants the
opportunity for discovery that Rule 56(f) is intended to guarantee them.
Plaintiff’s Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
In its second motion plaintiff seeks an order declaring that, in the 1832
“Castor Hill” treaty establishing plaintiff’s Kansas reservation, Congress
intended to reserve to the United States, in trust for plaintiff’s benefit, enough
water from the Delaware River watershed “to satisfy the present [2006] and
future municipal, domestic, agricultural, homeland, and hunting and fishing
needs of the Tribe.”

See Doc. No. 40, Plaintiff’s Second Motion for Partial

Summary Judgment, and Doc. No. 41, Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s
Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (both filed November 7, 2006). As
with plaintiff’s first motion, filed the same day, plaintiff filed this second motion
one week after the Non-Federal Defendants’ Answers and the Federal
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, before any discovery or initial disclosures.
Plaintiff and the Federal Defendants likely possess information that
undercuts plaintiff’s implausible assertions that the 1832 Congress intended to
reserve for plaintiff’s benefits water rights sufficient for industrialization and for
a large recreational lake created to attract non-Indians and enhance the
profitability of plaintiff’s newly constructed gambling casino. Certainly the NonFederal Defendants should be allowed to request such rebuttal information in
discovery. It is also likely, again as explained in defense counsel’s supporting
affidavit, that the Non-Federal Defendants will be able to establish a material
factual question as to the accuracy of plaintiff’s notions about Congress’s 1832
intentions through historical and anthropological research, guided and evaluated
by appropriate experts, about the water-relevant facts and circumstances existing
6

Case 2:06-cv-02248-CM-DJW Document 61 Filed 01/05/07 Page 7 of 9

or reasonably foreseeable during the early 19th century . Cf., e.g., In re General
Adjudication of all Rights to use Water in the Big Horn River System, 753 P.2d 76
(Wyo. 1988) (Congress in 1868 established the Wyoming Wind River Reservation
for the Eastern Shoshone Tribe with the intention of creating a reservation for
agricultural purposes; the water rights impliedly reserved for the tribe’s benefit
included only the surface water necessary to irrigate irrigable reservation land,
and did not include water for fisheries, wildlife, groundwater, or other uses not
part of the tribe’s traditional lifestyle), aff’d per curiam by an equally divided Court,
492 U.S. 406 (1989).
Again, it would be seriously inequitable, and inconsistent with the spirit
and purpose of Rule 56(f), to deny the Non-Federal Defendants the opportunity
to conduct discovery or other investigation necessary to challenge the asserted
factual basis for Plaintiff’s Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.
Conclusion
The purpose of Rule 56(f) is to give the parties to a lawsuit a reasonable
opportunity to develop a complete factual record before the Court rules on a
motion for summary judgment and to stymie the unfair tactic of filing premature
summary judgment motions and winning them before the opposing party has
time to uncover the relevant facts. The Court should therefore deny plaintiff’s
two motions for partial summary judgment (without prejudice to their later
renewal), or continue proceedings on those motions until after the expiration of
the discovery and expert deadlines that the Court sets in its forthcoming initial
scheduling conference.
