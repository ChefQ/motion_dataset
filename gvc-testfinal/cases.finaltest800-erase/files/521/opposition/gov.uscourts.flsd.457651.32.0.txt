DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITONS AND
RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Defendant

YACHTING

PROMOTIONS,

INC.

(“Defendant”

or

“Yachting

Promotions”), by and through its undersigned counsel, and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, 30
and 34, and L.R. 7.1(B), hereby responds to Plaintiff DANILO LOPEZ GARCIA’s
(“Plaintiff”) Motion to Compel Depositions and Responses to Request for Production of
Documents [Dkt. 27] (“Motion to Compel”) and states as follows:
I.

Plaintiff Did Not Make A Diligent Effort To Comply With The Discovery
Deadline When Scheduling The Depositions.
“Control of discovery is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its

discovery rulings will be reversed only where they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.”
Williamson v. U.S. Dep’t of Ag., 815 F.2d 368, 373 (5th Cir.1987) (citations omitted). The
Court has “broad discretion” in the scheduling of discovery. Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, 263
F.3d 1234, 1269 (11th Cir. 2001). Here, discovery commenced on May 15, 2015 after the

Case 1:15-cv-20776-RNS Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2015 Page 2 of 9

case management conference. [Dkt. 16]. Shortly thereafter, this Court issued a scheduling
order stating “[t]he parties must comply with the following schedule.” [Dkt. 19]. The
scheduling order set the discovery deadline for October 7, 2015. Id.
On September 8, 2015, almost four months after discovery commenced, Plaintiff first
attempted to schedule the deposition of Ricardo Strul and Paul Zak. Despite his dilatory
approach to discovery, at no time, including in this Motion to Compel, has Plaintiff sought an
extension of this Court-ordered discovery deadline to conduct these depositions.
Furthermore, Plaintiff presents an incomplete and self-serving account of his “attempt” to
schedule these depositions in his Motion to Compel. First, Plaintiff leads this Court to
believe that the parties had agreed to a date on which defense counsel later reneged. This
statement is false, and Plaintiff’s own exhibits attached to his Motion to Compel demonstrate
this conclusively. [Dkt. 27-1].

On September 9, 2015, Plaintiff’s counsel proposed a

September 25, 2015 date for the depositions of Ricardo Strul and Paul Zak. Defense counsel
rejected this proposal and counter-proposed October 1, 2015 as a date that was presently
available on all parties’ schedules. From September 9, 2015 until September 21, 2015,
Defense counsel received no response regarding this proposal. As such, all parties continued
to schedule other matters.
Twelve days later, on September 21, 2015, Plaintiff’s counsel finally contacted
Defense counsel to see if the depositions would take place on September 25, 2015, the date
she originally proposed. Clearly, Plaintiff’s counsel had given no consideration to Defense
counsel’s proposed date prior to September 21, 2015. Defense counsel promptly advised
Plaintiff’s counsel that because Plaintiff’s counsel had waited twelve days to respond to this

2

Case 1:15-cv-20776-RNS Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2015 Page 3 of 9

proposal, he was uncertain if this date was available for himself and his clients. Later that
same day, he confirmed that that date was no longer for Defense counsel and his clients. The
only other date that Plaintiff’s counsel proposed before the close of discovery on October 7,
2015 was October 2, 2015. Defense counsel advised that he would be in Pittsburgh on that
date.
In short, any issue scheduling the depositions of Ricardo Strul and Paul Zak are
entirely of the Plaintiff’s own creation. Plaintiff should not now be rewarded with an
extension of the Court mandated discovery deadline because of his own dilatory practices.
Finally, any extension of the Court mandated discovery deadline would materially prejudice
Defendant because it will necessarily delay this Court ruling on Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Judgment. Therefore, Yachting Promotions respectfully requests that this Court
reject Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the depositions of Ricardo Strul and Paul Zak.
II.

Yachting Promotions Objected To Requests 3, 4, And 5 Should Not Be
Overruled.
In compliance with L.R. 26.1(i)(2) Yachting Promotions will state the request for

production, objection, grounds for the objection, and reasons to deny the motion in
succession.1
REQUEST 3: Please provide each and every communication, including any e-mails
to legal counsel prior to February 24, 2014 in regard to any advice regarding the
implementation of the fluctuating work week.
RESPONSE: Objection: This Request is overly broad and unlimited in time and
scope, vague and ambiguous by use of the vague, undefined phrase, “implementation of the
1

Plaintiff’s motion does not comply with L.R. 26.1(i)(2).

3

Case 1:15-cv-20776-RNS Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2015 Page 4 of 9

fluctuating work week,” imposes on the attorney-client privilege beyond any limited and
necessary proof of Defendant’s good faith affirmative defense, does not provide enough
information from which Defendant could reasonable respond or determine all available
objections, and seeks irrelevant information not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.

All documents proving Defendant’s good faith

compliance with the law and Defendant’s associated affirmative defenses against alleged
liquidated damages and alleged willful violations will be made available for inspection and
copying, as maintained by Defendant in the ordinary course of business.
Grounds for objection and reasons to deny motion: First, as indicated in its
response above, Yachting Promotions has already produced all documents “proving
Defendant’s good faith compliance with the law and Defendant’s associated affirmative
defenses against alleged liquidated damages and alleged willful violations.” Therefore,
Plaintiff already has in his possession all documents Yachting Promotions intends to use to
establish any affirmative defenses raised in this matter.
Regarding the over broad and relevance objections, Yachting Promotions started to
implement the fluctuating workweek on February 27, 2007. Therefore, this request seeks
every communication “regarding implementation of the fluctuating workweek” over a seven
year period. However, Plaintiff’s damages are statutorily limited under the FLSA to the two
year time period prior to his termination. Therefore, the two year period prior to the
Plaintiff’s termination is the natural temporal focus of this matter. The Eleventh Circuit has
previously held that “a vague possibility that loose and sweeping discovery might turn up
something. . .does not show particularized need and likely relevance that would require

4

Case 1:15-cv-20776-RNS Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2015 Page 5 of 9

moving discovery beyond the natural focus of the inquiry.” Earley v. Champion Intern.
Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1085 (11th Cir. 1990). While courts interpret relevancy “broadly to
encompass any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter[s] that
could bear on, any issue that is or may be in the case, ‘discovery, like all matters of
procedure, has ultimate and necessary boundaries.’” Fiore v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,
2010 WL 4553547, *1 (M.D.Fla. Nov. 3, 2010) (citations omitted). Furthermore, Courts
routinely find that requests for all documents over an extended period of time are overly
broad and information not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence. See e.g. Melendez v. Mason, 2007 WL 1471799, *1 (M.D. Fla. May 21, 2007)
(“Umbrella references to ‘all’ records of activity over a decade or two are characteristic of an
improper fishing expedition, not permitted under the rules of discovery.”); Regan-Touhy v.
Walgreen Co., 526 F.3d 641, 650 (10th Cir. 2008) (request for “‘all documents . . . that refer
to, mention or relate in any way to Plaintiff, [ ] or the litigation or the allegations, facts and
circumstances concerning the litigation,’ [was] overly broad.”).

As this request seeks

discovery of “all communications” over a seven year period, well beyond the statutorily
limited two year period of recovery under the FLSA, Yachting Promotions’ over broad and
relevancy objections should be sustained.
Regarding the vague and ambiguous objection, “Courts tend to find document
requests seeking all documents related to a claim or defense as lacking particularity.” Lopez
v. Chertoff, 2009 WL 1575214, *2 (E.D. Cal. June 2, 2009) (citations omitted). Therefore,
Yachting Promotions’ objections should be sustained and no further production should be
compelled.

REQUEST 4: Please provide an e-mail correspondence from any agent of You
which included the term “fluctuating work week” or “fww.”
a) This request is intended to include any e-mail from any e-mail account
used by Ricardo Strul which contains the word combination “fluctuating
work week” or “fww”, which is not an e-mail to his legal counsel after the
date February 24, 2014.
RESPONSE: Objection: This Request is overly broad and unlimited in time and
scope, seeks irrelevant information not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence, and imposes an undue burden and expense on Defendant, including to
search e-mails for no valid reason. This Request requires Defendant to find and review
essentially every single electronic document and communication it has to even attempt to
respond. See also response to Request No. 1.
Grounds for objection and reasons to deny motion:

Request 4 is similar to

Request 3 above. Therefore, Yachting Promotions respectfully requests that the Court refer
to Yachting Promotions “grounds for objection” to Request 3 above for the reasons why the
over broad and relevance objections should be sustained.
Regarding the undue burden and expense objection, pursuant to the governing case
law in this Circuit, Plaintiff failed to confer with Yachting Promotions regarding the
appropriate search for relevant ESI and production, including: the subject scope of the
search; efficient search terms; potential Boolean searches; potential sources of the ESI; the
manner, format and timing of production; the implementation of a claw-back agreement;
potential sampling based on initial searches and the refinement of search terms depending on

6

Case 1:15-cv-20776-RNS Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2015 Page 7 of 9

the results of the sampling; and potential cost-sharing, with the overall understanding that the
costs of e-discovery must be proportional, utilizing the factors articulated in, inter alia,
Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 216 F.R.D. 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); see also F.D.I.C. v.
Brudnicki, 291 F.R.D. 669, 675 (N.D. Fla. 2013) (adopting the Zubalake factors). This Court
should not reward Plaintiff’s failure to diligently act to narrow the scope of e-discovery in
this matter. Accordingly, Yachting Promotions undue burden objection should be sustained,
and Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel these documents should be denied.
REQUEST 5: Please provide any communication, memorandum, or other document
which describes or otherwise discusses the fluctuating work week method of calculating
overtime.
RESPONSE: Objection: This Request is overly broad and unlimited in time and
scope, seeks irrelevant information not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence, and imposes an undue burden and expense on Defendant to search all of
its records for no valid reason, and may violate the privacy rights of non-parties without
notice or due process. This Request requires Defendant to find and review essentially every
single document and communications it has to even attempt to respond. See also response to
Request No. 1.
Grounds for objection and reasons to deny motion:

Yachting Promotions

respectfully requests that this Court refer to the “grounds for objection” for Request 3 above
for further support of its over broad and relevance objections to this request.
Regarding the undue burden objection, this request seeks “any communication,
memorandum, or other document” over a seven year period which “describes or otherwise

7

Case 1:15-cv-20776-RNS Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/11/2015 Page 8 of 9

discusses the fluctuating work week method of calculating overtime” necessarily requires
Yachting Promotions to review and analyze each and every “communication, memorandum,
or other document” produced by the company over a seven year to see if it is responsive to
this request. However, as discussed above, Plaintiff’s potential recovery is statutorily limited
under the FLSA to the two year period prior to this termination. Therefore, this request is
unduly burdensome and Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel these documents should be denied.
WHEREFORE for all the foregoing reasons, Yachting Promotions respectfully
requests that this Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel in its entirety.
Dated: November 11, 2015.
