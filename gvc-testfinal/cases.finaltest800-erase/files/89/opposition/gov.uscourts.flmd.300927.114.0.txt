PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL
DISCOVERY RESPONSES AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT
Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 and 37, and Rule 3.01(b) of the Local
Rules of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the “Local Rules” or
“M.D. Fla. L.R.”), Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant, Barn Light Electric Company, LLC
(“Barn Light Electric”) and Third-Party Defendants’, Bryan and Donna Scott (“The Scotts”)
(collectively, “Plaintiff”), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby provide their
Response in Opposition to Defendants and Counterclaim Plaintiffs, Barnlight Originals, Inc.’s
(“BLO”) and Hi-Lite Manufacturing Company, Inc.’s (“Hi-Lite”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
Motion to Compel Discovery Responses and Memorandum of Law in Support (Dkt. 110), and
state as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Discovery Responses (Dkt. 110) has been rendered moot

by Barn Light Electric’s supplemental document production and discovery responses.
Accordingly, this Court should deny Defendants’ Motion because: (i) Plaintiff produced all
documents in its custody, possession and control that are responsive to Defendants’ Requests for
Production of Documents (Nos. 4-9) (“Requests”), (ii) Plaintiff properly relied upon Fed. R. Civ.
P. 33(d) in specifically identifying all responsive financial and business records it produced to
enable Defendants to ascertain the answers to Interrogatories (Nos. 3-8) (“Interrogatories”) and
(iii) the burden of deriving or ascertaining answers to Defendants’ Interrogatories through
Plaintiff’s specifically identified financial and business records is substantially the same for
either party. In support of its Response in Opposition, Plaintiff has attached hereto the

2

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 3 of 17 PageID 3056

declaration of John G. Plumpe, Plaintiff’s expert witness, who is familiar with and has personally
reviewed the financial documents produced by Plaintiff in this matter. 1
During the in-person meet/confer this Court recommended following the hearing relating
to Plaintiff’s allegation of Defendants’ continued failure to comply with this Court’s Order (see
Dkt. 95) and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff informed Defendants that it would
promptly supplement its discovery responses with additional detailed Bates ranges and produce
additional responsive documents as soon as they were collected and processed for
production. During that meeting—and again during a call on August 26, 2015—Plaintiff’s
counsel urged Defendants’ counsel, Mr. Colitz, to call if, after receiving the supplemental
responses and documents, Defendants did not believe Plaintiff’s discovery response was
sufficient.
Plaintiff made its promised production on August 26, 2015, long before the deadline for
expert reports of September 18, 2015. Despite its reservations in producing highly sensitive
financial and sales information to a direct competitor, and in the hope its good faith efforts would
engender reciprocity from Defendants, Plaintiff produced its financial documents relying on the
confidentiality provisions of the Protective Order entered in this case (see Dkts. 40, 41) in
complying with the broad scope of discovery afforded to litigants under Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(b)(1). 2 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Defendants have come before this Court with unclean
hands. Defendants’ mistaken and indefensible assertion that Hi-Lite and Mr. Ohai are somehow

Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the Declaration of John G. Plumpe in Support of Plaintiff’s Response in
Opposition to Defendants’ (herinafter, referred to as the “Plumpe Decl.”).
2 Plaintiff stands ready to produce to the Court for its in camera review, under seal, the Highly Confidential
documents it has produced to Defendants in response to the Requests and Interrogatories that are the subject of this
motion. Moreover, to the extent the Court would like to conduct an in camera review the same, Plaintiff shall
provide samples under seal, of the unresponsive documents produced by Defendants, e.g., Wing Dings, computer
code and hardcore pornography, referenced in its earlier filed Motion to Compel (Dkt. 109), all of which have been
batch classified as Highly Confidential by Defendants.

3

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 4 of 17 PageID 3057

exempt from their obligation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to produce exactly the
same information in connection with the claims and defenses at issue in this case is simply
inexplicable. The Court should not aid or reward Defendants for their egregious misconduct.
Defendants never contacted Plaintiff regarding its supplemental responses and document
production. Instead, Defendants responded to Plaintiff’s good faith production efforts by once
again filing a motion that once again fails to meet the strict requirements of Local Rule 3.01(g)
and further contravenes this Court’s admonition that the parties confer in person or
telephonically prior to filing a discovery motion. Defendants’ true intent in filing this motion is
to distract the Court from Defendants’ obstreperous refusal to produce Defendants Hi-Lite and
Ohai’s long overdue financial discovery, and to mask its failure to produce numerous documents
relating to the ‘477 Patent as ordered by this Court. See Dkt. 95. Let there be no mistake:
Defendants’ motion amounts to pointing out a speck of sawdust in another’s eye, while ignoring
the plank protruding from its own.
II.

STANDARD OF LAW
A.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37.

Motions to compel disclosures and other discovery under Rule 37(a) are committed to the
sound discretion of the trial court. Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Westrope, 730 F.2d 729,
731 (11th Cir.1984). The trial court’s exercise of discretion regarding discovery orders will
be sustained absent a finding of abuse of that discretion to the prejudice of a party.
See Westrope, 730 F.2d at 731.
Under Rule 37(a)(5)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, even where a motion to
compel discovery is granted or discovery is provided after a motion is filed, sanctions are not
appropriate where: (i) a movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the

4

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 5 of 17 PageID 3058

disclosure, (ii) the opposing party’s nondisclosure was substantially justified, or (iii) other
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A). Courts in the
Middle District of Florida have refused to grant sanctions, including attorney’s fees, where a
motion to compel is filed prematurely without allowing a party to complete its supplemental
production, where the movant failed to engage in a good faith meet and confer, or where
nondisclosure is otherwise substantially justified. See Eli Research, LLC v. Must Have Info Inc.,
Case No. 2:13-cv-695-FtM-38CM (M.D. Fla. Aug 20, 2015) (“[S]anctions are not warranted
when the moving party files the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure
or discovery without court action. . . . While the Court notes that these issues were resolved after
the motions to compel were filed, the Court finds that Defendants filed the motions prematurely.
. . . Rather than immediately filing the motions to compel, Defendants could have continued to
work with Plaintiffs in an effort to resolve this matter prior to filing the motions to compel.” Id.
at 4.). “Discovery in this district should be practiced with a spirit of cooperation and civility.”
Middle District Discovery, A Handbook on Civil Discovery Practice in the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida § I(A)(1).
B.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33(d).

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33(d) permits a party to rely upon business records in
responding to interrogatories when “the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is
substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served.” Wolk v.
Seminole Cnty., Florida, No. 605CV-1722-ORL-18KRS, 2007 WL 328685, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Jan.
31, 2007). Furthermore, Rule 33(d) makes clear that “it is a sufficient answer to such
interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained . . . [a]
specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to

5

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 6 of 17 PageID 3059

identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be
ascertained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(d); see also U.S.C.F.T.C. v. Am. Derivatives Corp., No. CIVA
1:05CV2492 RWS, 2007 WL 1020838, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 30, 2007) (finding that reliance on
Fed.R.Civ.P. 33(d) in answering an interrogatory relating to financial information was “entirely
proper” and that “a party may refer to records, as opposed to providing a narrative, if those
records are clearly identified.” Id.).
Courts in the Middle District of Florida have held that “Rule 33 is to be liberally
construed.” ParkerVision, Inc. v. Qualcomm Inc., No. 3:11-CV-719-J-37TEM, 2013 WL 84926,
at *2 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 8, 2013) citing Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Clow Corp.,
108 F.R.D. 304, 307 (D.P.R.1985). In answering an interrogatory seeking financial information,
pursuant to Rule 33(d), a responding party may fulfill its obligation under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure by providing a response which directs the propounding party to “financial data
within its possession, custody or control to the extent such financial data is kept in the ordinary
course of business . . . [and the responding party] is not required to reformat, reconfigure, or
independently generate this financial data to satisfy the parameters set forth in [an] Interrogatory
. . . .” Id. at *3. In short, courts in this district have made clear that with regard to interrogatories
directed to financial information, parties are obligated only to “provide financial information . . .
that already exists.” Id.
C.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34(b)(2).

Moreover, with regard to Requests for Production of Documents, pursuant to Rule
34(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a responding party may properly choose to
“produce documents as they are kept in the usual course of business.” See Fed.R.Civ.P.
34(b)(2)(E)(i). Courts have made clear that a responding party is under no obligation to

6

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 7 of 17 PageID 3060

“produce data that is not kept in the ordinary course of business.” See Peterson v. Seagate U.S.
LLC, No. CIV.07-2502(MJD/AJB), 2009 WL 3430150, at *2 (D. Minn. Oct. 19, 2009).
III.

ARGUMENT AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW
A.

Defendants motion has been rendered moot by Plaintiff’s supplemental
production of documents and discovery responses.

Plaintiff supplemented its discovery responses and produced all responsive documents in
its custody, possession and control relating to the Requests and Interrogatories that are the
subject of Defendants’ Motion to Compel (Dkt. 110). (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8). Accordingly, the
issues raised in Defendants’ motion have been rendered moot and the motion should be denied.
1.

Plaintiff has produced all documents responsive to Defendants’ Request for
Production of Documents (Nos. 4-9).

Plaintiff has produced documents that exist in its custody, possession and control which
are responsive to each of Defendants’ Requests (Nos. 4-9). Defendants’ expansive Requests for
Production of Documents (Nos. 4-9) each request all of Plaintiff’s financial documents and sales
data dating back to the launch of Barn Light Electric in 2008 through the present, including the
following data relating to an extensive list of products contained in multiple exhibits to its
Requests for Production (“Identified Products”):
(a) The number of units sold, and to whom the units were sold;
(b) The sales price of each unit;
(c) The gross income received from sales of these units;
(d) The net income received from sale [sic] of these units;
(e) The profits received from sales of these units; and
(f) An itemized list of the fixed and variable costs associated with the manufacture,
production, marketing, advertising, and selling of these units.
Each of Defendants’ Requests also seek the identity of each customer or distributor that
has ever purchased or received Plaintiff’s products, including the information contained in
subsections (a-f) as noted above.

7

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 8 of 17 PageID 3061

Plaintiff has produced documents responsive to Requests (Nos. 4-9) which are sufficient
to show the number of units sold, identity of persons to whom the units were sold, sales price of
each unit, gross income and net income received from sales of the Identified Products for the
time period 2008 through the present. (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8). Prior to the filing of this Motion,
Plaintiff produced and specifically identified its “Products Sold Report” which includes a
complete record of all commercial and consumer sales data from January 2010 through July
2015. More specifically, Plaintiff’s “Products Sold Report” identifies the number of units sold,
identity of persons to whom the units were sold, sales price of each unit, gross income and net
income received from sales of the identified products. (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-6). Plaintiff has also
produced and specifically identified individual purchase orders for sales of the Identified
Products. 3
Additionally, prior to Defendants’ filing of this motion, Plaintiff also produced and
specifically identified Plaintiff’s audited and unaudited financial statements, including profit and
loss statements, for 2011 through July 2015 which show the monthly and annual sales and costs
totals for all of Plaintiff’s sales for this time period. (Plumpe Decl. ¶7). However, because
Plaintiff has transitioned to differing accounting platforms commensurate with the development
and growth of the company from a small proprietorship to a mid-sized company over the past
seven years, locating financial data relating back to the launch of Barn Light Electric in 2008 has
3 Defendants argue in their motion that individual purchase orders are insufficient to derive the data required for
their damages analysis. See Dkt. 110 at p.15. While Plaintiff has produced extensive financial data relating to its
sales, Defendants have themselves produced only individual purchase orders relating to the product level sales data.
Moreover, while BLE has produce tabulated spreadsheets containing all data contained in the individual purchase
orders it has produced, while clearly able to do so, Defendants have refused to provide the same in an effort to
stymie Plaintiff’s ability to analyze its financial data in time to meet the expert report deadline in this matter.
Moreover, a significant number of the purchase orders that were produced are unfortunately in unreadable condition
with key data including revenue received and quantity missing from the produced images. Plaintiff has had to
absorb additional, needless costs in manually tabulating incomplete data from over 2,000 purchase orders. With
expert reports due today, Defendants, while on notice of all of these issues, still refuse to produce any documents or
discovery responses relating to Hi-Lite’s or Ohai’s financials, and have yet to produce complete purchase orders for
in a readable format or a tabulated report.

8

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 9 of 17 PageID 3062

been a difficult and time consuming process. Plaintiff has gone to great lengths in conducting an
exhaustive search of its records for responsive documents, including requesting documents from
third parties and identifying and retrieving data from accounting programs no longer utilized by
the company in order to seasonally supplement its production of documents throughout the
discovery process. Plaintiff most recently produced and specifically identified its unaudited
financials, including profit and loss statements, for the time period April 2008 through the
December 31, 2010. Id. Additionally, prior to the filing of Defendants’ motion, Plaintiff
produced and specifically identified all of its purchase orders and payment files for all purchases
from Hi-Lite for the time period, April 2008 through October 2014. Finally, prior to the filing of
Defendants’ motion, Plaintiff also produced and specifically identified all coupon and promo
codes it has utilized from January 2010 through the present. (Plumpe Decl. ¶7-8). Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s production of documents responsive to subsections (a-f) of Defendants’ Requests is
complete.
Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiff has engaged in a shell game lacks any factual basis
and is a gross mischaracterization of the good faith representations made by Plaintiff’s counsel
throughout the discovery process. Plaintiff has consistently represented that it would respond to
the Interrogatories and produce documents responsive to the Requests. Plaintiff has also
informed Defendants on numerous occasions, prior to the filing of the instant motion, that certain
classifications of documents in Defendants’ Requests—including documents that Defendants
complain are missing from Plaintiff’s production—simply do not exist. For example, Plaintiff
does not keep financial records in the ordinary course of business which track the profitability of
its products at the individual product level. (Plumpe Decl. ¶7). Instead, Plaintiff tracks and
reports its profits for all products in its annual and monthly financial statements and reports.

9

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 10 of 17 PageID 3063

(Plumpe Decl. ¶7). Given this fact, Plaintiff met its discovery obligations by producing and
specifically identifying its annual and monthly financial statements and reports for the time
period 2008 through July 2015. (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8).
Likewise, Plaintiff does not keep financial records in the ordinary course of business
which include the costs associated with the sale, manufacture, production, marketing,
advertising, and selling of its products at the individual product level. (Plumpe Decl. ¶8).
Instead, Plaintiff includes such costs in monthly and annual reports for all products. Id. Thus, in
addition to its annual financial statements, including profit and loss statements, Plaintiff also
produced and specifically identified numerous documents reporting taxes, wages, professional
fees, bank fees, merchant service fees, sub-contract labor, real estate and other costs from which
Plaintiff’s total costs can be derived. (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8).
Furthermore, while Plaintiff has produced its financial statements, including profit and
loss statements, for 2008 and 2009, Plaintiff simply does not have documents or data relating to
the number of individual units sold, identity of the purchasers of such units, or sales price for the
sale of individual products for the time period April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009.
During this time period, when Barn Light Electric was merely a small startup, the company’s
financial statements were fully developed through general journal entries. Although Defendants
refuse to accept the same, Plaintiff cannot produce documents or provide data that it does not
have.
Finally, Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiff has not produced documents responsive to
Request No. 6 is baseless. On May 26, 2015, Plaintiff completed its production of documents
responsive to this Request by producing a Google analytics document which specifies the precise

10

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 11 of 17 PageID 3064

number of sales and total revenue resulting from said sales for the specific webpage identified in
the Request. Moreover, Plaintiff also produced the corresponding invoices relating to each sale.
2.

Plaintiff has provided complete responses to Defendants’ Interrogatories.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 33(d), Plaintiff fulfilled its discovery
obligation by providing responses to each of Defendants’ Interrogatories (Nos. 3-8), specifically
identifying the business and financial records by Bates ranges from which the answer to each
Interrogatory may be ascertained. (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8). Defendants’ motion has been rendered
moot by Plaintiff’s supplemental discovery responses and production. Thus, Defendants’ motion
should be denied.
On August 26, 2015, prior to the filing of Defendants’ motion, Plaintiff supplemented its
responses to the Interrogatories and also produced additional responsive financial documents.

4

(Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8). Plaintiff also informed Defendants on numerous occasions in person and
by phone that it was in the process of gathering additional responsive financial documents for
production and would also supplement its responses to the Interrogatories at that time. However,
Defendants instead chose to file this motion, prior to receiving Plaintiff’s supplemental
production and discovery responses, and without insomuch as a telephonic meet/confer.
Nevertheless, on September 15, 2015, Plaintiff once again supplemented its responses to the
Interrogatories and completed its production of all remaining financial documents responsive to
the Requests.

4 Notably, Plaintiff included in its supplemental discovery responses, the following General Objection which was
incorporated into each and every response to the Interrogatories: “17. As discovery is currently on-going, Barn Light
Electric and The Scotts remain in the process of reviewing and producing non-privileged, responsive documents.
Barn Light Electric’s and The Scotts’ investigation into information responsive to this Interrogatory is ongoing and
Barn Light Electric and The Scotts reserve the right to supplement its responses as discovery continues or as
circumstances otherwise warrant.”

11

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 12 of 17 PageID 3065

Defendants’ Interrogatories (Nos. 3-8) are virtually identical to the broad Requests it has
propounded upon Plaintiff and seek answers including the following expansive financial
information and sales data for all of Plaintiff’s sales dating back to the launch of Barn Light
Electric in 2008 through the present, including the following data relating to an extensive list of
Identified Products contained in multiple exhibits to its Interrogatories:
(a) The number of units sold, and to whom the units were sold;
(b) The sales price of each unit;
(c) The gross income received from sales of these units;
(d) The net income received from sale [sic] of these units;
(e) The profits received from sales of these units; and
(f) An itemized list of the fixed and variable costs associated with the manufacture,
production, marketing, advertising, and selling of these units.
Each of Defendants’ Interrogatories also seek answers including the identity of each and
every customer or distributor that has ever purchased or received Plaintiff’s products from 2008
through the present, including the information contained in (a-f) as noted above.
Given the sheer breadth of information requested by Defendants, including all sales
dating back to 2008 for every customer or distributor that has ever purchased or received
Plaintiff’s products, including the information contained in (a-f) noted above, a written response
to Defendants’ Interrogatories would be overly burdensome and impractical. Thus, pursuant to
Rule 33(d), Plaintiff fulfilled its obligation under the Federal Rules by specifically identifying
the Bates ranges for all responsive documents produced to Defendants, to the extent such
documents exist, containing the data requested. (Plumpe Decl. ¶1-8). The burden of deriving or
ascertaining the answers to the Interrogatories Plaintiff has propounded through reference to the
documents identified by Plaintiffs in its response is substantially the same for Defendant as it is
for Plaintiff. Id.; see also Wolk v. Seminole Cnty., Florida, No. 605CV-1722-ORL-18KRS, 2007

12

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 13 of 17 PageID 3066

WL 328685, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 31, 2007). Accordingly, Plaintiff has fulfilled its obligation
under the Federal Rules and Defendants’ Motion should be dismissed.
B.

Defendants motion must be denied for failure to meet the requirements of
Local Rule 3.01(g) and ignoring this Court’s admonition that it engage in an
in-person or telephonic meet and confer prior to filing a discovery motion.

Defendants Motion to Compel should be denied because Defendants have ignored this
Court’s admonition that pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(g), the parties communicate in good faith
through an in-person or telephonic meet/confer prior to seeking this Court’s intervention. See
Ex. B, Transcript of Motion Hearing, August 14, 2015 at p. 43 ln.14-24 (“I’m going to direct that
if there is a dispute . . . the Court will not attend to it unless there’s been a conversation,
telephonically or in-person, between the parties to see [if] under 3.01(g) there can be a resolution
of those matters and a discussion in detail regarding those matters. So, if you have any further
issues, make sure you talk to one another first before you bring them to the Court.”). Instead,
Defendants filed the instant motion without insomuch as a telephone call to Plaintiff’s counsel to
satisfy the meet and confer requirements of Local Rule 3.01(g) which requires counsel to meet in
confer in good faith “[b]efore filing any motion in a civil case.” M.D. Fla. L.R. 3.01(g).
Rule 3.01(g) does not except renewed motions. See id.; see also Communications
Center, Inc. v. Komatsu, No. 6:05-cv-1254-Orl-31GJK, 2008 WL 1777725, at *1 (M.D. Fla.
Mar. 9, 2009) (noting previous denial of a renewed motion to compel without prejudice in part
for failure to comply with Local Rule 3.01(g)); Durden v. Citicorp Trust Bank, FSB, No. 3:07cv-974-J-34JRK, 2010 WL 2105924, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 27, 2010) (requiring parties to meet
and confer pursuant to M.D. Fla. L.R. 3.01(g) before filing a renewed motion). Defendants’
reliance on the parties’ discussion of the subject matter of this motion weeks prior to its renewed
filing, which occurred prior to Plaintiff’s subsequent supplemental responses, supplemental
production of documents and the further assurances by Plaintiff’s counsel of the impending

13

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 14 of 17 PageID 3067

supplementation of its production and discovery responses, flies in the face of M.D. Fla. L.R.
3.01(g).
Moreover, where, as is the case here, a movant fails to adhere to the strict requirements of
Local Rule 3.01(g) prior to filing a renewed motion to compel, courts in the Middle District of
Florida have flatly denied such motions. See American Registry, LLC v. Hanaw et. al., Case No.
2:13-cv-352-FtM-29CM, Doc. 58 at 3 (M.D. Fla. May 19, 2014)(“In light of counsel for
Plaintiff’s failure to meet and confer with counsel for Defendants as required by Local Rule
3.01(g) prior to filing the [Renewed] Motion to Compel, and because the motions and response
suggest that some issues raised in Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel may be resolved by a good faith
conference, the Court will deny Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel without prejudice to refiling after
the parties meet and confer in good faith pursuant to the Local Rules.” Id.).
Defendants have failed to comply with this Court’s admonition and Local Rule 3.01(g).
Given this Court’s express and unmistakable direction regarding the procedure to be followed in
filing any subsequent motions to compel and the Court’s admonition that this “Court would not
attend to such issues” if a movant failed to comply with its direction, Plaintiff respectfully
requests that Defendants’ Renewed Motion to Compel (Dkt. 110) be denied.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff, Barn Light Electric Company, LLC, respectfully

requests that this Court enter an order denying Defendants’ Renewed Motion to Compel as moot
in view of Plaintiff’s supplemental production of documents and discovery responses which, to
the extent possible, respond in full to Defendants’ Requests and Interrogatories. Moreover, this
Court should deny Defendants’ motion for sanctions because: (i) Defendants prematurely filed
its renewed motion prior to receiving Plaintiff’s supplemental production and discovery

14

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 114 Filed 09/18/15 Page 15 of 17 PageID 3068

responses; (ii) Defendants failed to comply with the requirements of Local Rule 3.01(g) and this
Court’s admonition to meet and confer with Plaintiff in good faith prior to filing its motion, (iii)
Plaintiff’s have, in good faith, consistently and seasonally supplemented its production of
documents and discovery responses as additional information has been discovered throughout
the discovery period in this matter, which is still open, (iv) Defendants come before this Court
with unclean hands, and have themselves intentionally failed to produce documents and
discovery responses critical to Plaintiff’s claims and defenses in this matter, and (v) the
circumstances surrounding the filing of Defendants’ motion would otherwise make an award of
expenses unjust.
Finally, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court, pursuant to the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure and this Court’s inherent authority grant Plaintiff its attorneys fees and costs
associated with the filing of this Response. Defendants improperly and prematurely filed its
Motion, unnecessarily burdening the resources of this Court and further causing unnecessary and
avoidable expense to Plaintiff.
