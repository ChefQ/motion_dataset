COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED
MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 and L.R. 3.04(a), Barnlight Originals, Inc. and Hi-Lite
Manufacturing Company, Inc. (collectively “Counterclaim Plaintiffs”) hereby move for entry of an
order compelling Counterclaim Defendant Barn Light Electric Company, LLC and Third-Party
Defendants Bryan and Donna Scott (collectively “Counterclaim Defendants”) to (i) produce
documents responsive to Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production 4-9 and (ii) provide
answers to Interrogatories 3-8. Counterclaim Plaintiffs also seek recovery of the attorneys’ fees and
expenses necessitated by this motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5). In support of this motion,
Counterclaim Plaintiffs state as follows:
I.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
This motion concerns Requests for Production Nos. 4-9 and corresponding Interrogatories

Nos. 3-8. These discovery requests are simple. For certain identified products, they seek the
number of units sold, sales price, gross/net income, profit, and costs. The information sought is
directly relevant to the calculation of Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ damages. Counterclaim Defendants
have unfortunately played a shell game in responding. They initially responded indicating that
responsive documents exist and would be produced, and that the interrogatory responses could be
derived from such documents. When responsive documents were not forthcoming, Counterclaim
Plaintiffs filed their Motion to Compel [Dkt. 99]. Counterclaim Defendants thereafter sought to
moot the motion by indicating that no responsive documents exist and promising to instead provide
complete interrogatory responses.

Following the withdraw of the motion, supplemental

interrogatory responses were provided. But instead of providing written responses as promised,
Counterclaim Defendants relied upon documents (documents they previously indicated did not
exist). The referenced documents, however, come no where close to answering the interrogatories.
As a consequence, Counterclaim Plaintiffs hereby renew it previously filed motion to compel.

II.

BACKGROUND
On October 30, 2014, Counterclaim Plaintiffs served Counterclaim Defendants with their

First Requests for Production and First Set of Interrogatories (collectively “Discovery Requests”).
See EXHIBITS A and B, respectively. The Discovery Requests sought information relating to
Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ claims of, among other things, trademark infringement, trade dress
infringement, copyright infringement, and unfair competition. In response to the Discovery
Requests, Counterclaim Defendants agreed to produce responsive documents at a mutually agreeable
place and time, which was subsequently defined by the parties as May 2015. As of the filing of this
Motion, nearly ten months after service of the Discovery Requests and nearly four months after the
agreed time for production, and following repeated assurances by opposing counsel, Counterclaim
Defendants still have not produced documents responsive to several of the Discovery Requests.
On June 5, 2015, undersigned counsel sent a letter to opposing counsel, notifying
Counterclaim Defendants of several deficiencies in its production. See EXHIBIT C. On June 19,
2015, Counterclaim Defendants subsequently produced their final round of documents and, on July
1, 2015, confirmed that its production of documents responsive to Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ First
Requests for Production was complete. See EXHIBIT D. Following verification that certain
deficiencies in document production still exist, counsel for Counterclaim Plaintiffs sent a second
letter to Counterclaim Defendants’ counsel on July 7, 2015, reiterating its demand for the production
of certain documents and answers to interrogatories. See EXHIBIT E. Given opposing counsel’s
continued refusal to provide the requested documents and answers to interrogatories, Counterclaim
Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Discovery Responses on July 15, 2015. See [Dkt. 99].

-3-

Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ counsel and Counterclaim Defendants’ counsel then held a
conference call on July 20, 2015 to discuss the lack of production, which was memorialized in a
letter sent to Counterclaim Defendants’ counsel on the same day. See EXHIBIT F. Counterclaim
Defendants’ counsel confirmed in a July 22, 2015 email that there were “no documents . . .
responsive to subsections (d)-(f) of [Requests for Production] 4-9” but that they would supplement
any answers to Interrogatories 3-10 to provide the requested information. See EXHIBIT G. In light
of opposing counsel’s apparent willingness to provide the requested financial information,
Counterclaim Plaintiffs withdrew their motion to compel on July 23, 2015. See [Dkt. 100].
On July 31, 2015 Counterclaim Defendants supplemented their interrogatory responses.
However, instead of providing the promised written answers, the supplemental interrogatory
responses simply pointed to various spreadsheets from which the answers could supposedly be
derived. The spreadsheets, however, failed to identify any gross/net income, profit, or fixed or
variable costs associated with the products. Moreover, the information was not broken down on a
product-by-product basis. Nor did the documents provide information over the requested time
period of 2008 to present. These objections were detailed in a letter to counsel for Counterclaim
Defendants on August 14, 2015. See EXHBIIT H. On August 26, 2015, Counterclaim Defendants’
counsel served its second supplemental responses to the identified interrogatories. Again, however,
the referenced spreadsheets are incomplete with regard to their responsiveness to the discovery
requests.1
Ultimately, while Counterclaim Defendants have produced a large volume of documents,
they have yet to produce any documents that answer the identified interrogatories relating to the
gross income, net income, profits, or fixed or variable costs associated with the manufacture,

included with this filing. Representative examples will be filed under seal for review by the Court.

production, marketing, advertising, or selling of certain identified products in the manner proscribed
in the Requests for Production or Interrogatories. Counterclaim Plaintiffs have tried repeatedly to
come to an amicable resolution of this matter with Counterclaim Defendants, but Counterclaim
Plaintiffs’ numerous letters and emails resulted in no documents or answers responsive to these
requests.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT
III.

GOVERNING LAW
Motions to compel under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 are committed to the sound

discretion of the trial court. See Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Westrope, 730 F.2d 729, 731
(11th Cir. 1984). The trial court's exercise of discretion regarding discovery orders will be sustained
absent a finding of abuse of that discretion to the prejudice of a party. See id. Pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(b), a party is entitled to discover “any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s
claim or defense.” Furthermore, “[r]elevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the
discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” See Fed.
R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).

Barn Light and the Scotts object to this Request as vague, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly

time. Barn Light and the Scotts further object to this request as unduly burdensome to the extent that
it requires Barn Light and the Scotts to investigate and seek documents from third parties. The Scotts
object to this request because it seeks documents not in the individual custody, control or possession
of the Scotts.
Subject to these objections and its general objections, and without waiver thereof, Barn Light

selling of the products identified in Requests for Production 4-9 and Interrogatories No. 3-8. The
requested information is unquestionably relevant to this case. In trademark litigation, one measure
of damages is lost profits. See 15 U.S.C. § 1114. The products identified in Requests 4-9 and
Interrogatories 3-8 are directly related to, among other causes of action, Counterclaim Plaintiffs’
allegations of trademark infringement and unfair competition.
Despite agreeing to produce responsive documents and answers at a mutually convenient
time and place, Counterclaim Defendants have thus far failed to do so. Instead, Counterclaim
Defendants have only produced purchase orders showing individual sales of the identified products.
Counterclaim Defendants’ Supplemental Responses do not cure this deficiency. The documents
identified in the supplemental responses amount to computer-generated printouts of inputted data
designed to look favorably on Counterclaim Defendants. These spreadsheets include information
such as the transaction total, the name of the customer, and the order date. However, knowing the
number of products sold and details of purchase orders tells an observer nothing about the “net
income received” or the “profits received” and does not provide an “itemized list of the fixed and
variable costs associated with the manufacture, production, marketing, advertising, and selling” of
any products. The documents include no information regarding overhead, inventory costs, selling
expenses, administrative expenses, operating profits, net profit, taxes, or any other metric associated
with income or profits which are normally kept in the ordinary course of business. In fact, the
documents Counterclaim Defendant point to suggest Counterclaim Defendants’ have been running
reports on the underlying financial data (data which has not been produced) and providing the
resulting spreadsheets instead of producing hard financial numbers.
Counterclaim Defendant had a duty to provide underlying financial data so that Counterclaim

-15-

Plaintiff can meet its burden of proving damages. Counterclaim Plaintiff is not asking for
Counterclaim Defendant to reformat, reconfigure, or independently generate any financial data but,
instead, produce all underlying financial data within its possession, custody, or control as kept in the
ordinary course of business so that lost profits could be calculated. See ParkerVision, Inc. v.
Qualcomm, Inc., 2013 WL 84926, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 8, 2013) (granting motion to compel against
Defendant directing production of financial data so as to allow for calculation of lost profits).
Counterclaim Defendants’ burden would be met by providing all relevant financial data without
manipulation.
Counterclaim Defendant cannot go from claiming they will produce responsive documents
and answers to stating there are no responsive documents to providing half-responsive spreadsheets
seemingly created for this litigation. Counterclaim Plaintiffs are entitled to receive documents and
answers to interrogatories related to Counterclaim Defendants’ profits so Counterclaim Plaintiffs can
estimate their ultimate monetary damages. Under the broad right of discovery in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26,
Counterclaim Defendants must produce all relevant documents, and Counterclaim Plaintiffs
respectfully request an Order by this Court compelling them to do so. In particular, Counterclaim
Plaintiffs request this Court order Counterclaim Defendants to produce the underlying financial data
used to create the spreadsheets described above.

B.

Interrogatories 7-8.
Counterclaim Plaintiffs initially objected to Interrogatories 7-8 on the basis that they

exceeded the permissible number of interrogatories. It is unclear given the subsequent amendments
whether these objections still stand. If so, the objections are without merit. While Fed. R. Civ. P.
33(a) limits the number of interrogatories to twenty-five, inclusive of discrete subparts, “Rule 33

-16-

does not define ‘discrete subparts’ . . . .” Oliver v. City of Orlando, 2007 WL 3232227, at *2 (M.D.
Fla. Oct. 31, 2007). When determining whether an interrogatory includes discrete subparts, this
Court applies the “related question” test, which involves “assessing whether the particular subparts
are logically or factually subsumed within and necessarily related to the primary question.” Id. In
other words, the relevant inquiry becomes whether “the subparts are sufficiently logically related to
the information sought in the primary question to be counted as a single interrogatory.” Id. at *3.
Here, the definitive sections of Interrogatories 3-8 are logically and factually related, as they
are all aimed at determining and verifying the profits received as the result of a sale of an infringing
product(s).

Accordingly, Interrogatories 3-8 each count as single interrogatory. Further,

Counterclaim Defendants waived any objection that the number of interrogatories was exceeded by
providing responses. Pepperwood of Naples Condominium Ass’n, Inc. v. National Mut. Fire Ins.
Co., 2011 WL 4382104, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 20, 2011); see also Wright, Miller & Marcus,
Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil §2173 (stating “[a] voluntary answer to an interrogatory is
also a waiver of the objection.”). Counterclaim Defendants should be compelled to answer the
interrogatories in the manner proscribed above.
VI.

CONCLUSION
Counterclaim Plaintiffs respectfully seek an order compelling Counterclaim Defendants to

produce documents responsive to Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production 4-9 and
completely answer Interrogatories 3-8. Furthermore, because Counterclaim Defendants’ refusal to
both produce the requested documents and answer the relevant Interrogatories is not substantially
justified, Counterclaim Plaintiffs also seek recovery of the attorneys’ fees and expenses necessitated
by this motion pursuant under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5).
