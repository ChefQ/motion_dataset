I.

INTRODUCTION

On November 26, 2013, the Court ruled on several motions filed by the
James A. Williams Trust (the "Trust") and Defendants' motion to dismiss (the
"Order"). In the Order, the Court (1) ordered the Trust to retain counsel within
thirty (30) days of the Order,(2) found that the Defendants have not been served
with process, and (3) denied the Trust's request for summary judgment embedded
in its response to Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Order, DE 19, at 13).
The Trust's present motion for reconsideration is a compilation of arguments
contained in the various filings that were subject to the Order. The Trust provides
no new evidence or legal authority to overcome its substantial burden of showing
that it may proceed in this action without a licensed attorney; it does nothing to
show that it properly served any of the Defendants; and, the Trust provides no
arguments or facts on which the Court can reconsider its denial of the Trust's
request for summary judgment. As the Trust is unable to meet its evidentiary
burden, the Court should deny the Trust's motion for reconsideration in its entirety.

A.

ARGUMENT

Standard for Motion for Reconsideration
Whether to grant a motion for reconsideration is vested in the district court's

sound discretion as the grant of such a motion is an "extraordinary remedy to be

28733300.1

- 2-

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 3 of 11

employed sparingly." Fla. Assn of Rehabilition Facilities, Inc. v. State of Fla.
Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1216 (11th Cir. 2000).

A court should only grant a motion for reconsideration if: 1) there has been an
intervening change in controlling law; 2) the party discovers new evidence; or 3)
reconsideration is needed to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice. Cox
Communications, Inc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. ofPittsburg, PA, No. 1:09-CV-

410-TWT, 2010 WL 5092282, * 1 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 8, 2010). Denial of a motion for
reconsideration is especially appropriate where the moving party "has failed to
articulate any reason for the failure to raise the issue at an earlier stage in the
litigation." LockaYd v. Equifax, Inc., 163 F.3d 1259, 1267 (11th Cir. 1998).
Plaintiff has not met any requirement necessary to support reconsideration.
B.

Only an Attorney Can Represent the Trust
This Court correctly found in its Order that the Trust "must be represented in

this court by a licensed attorney" in the instant litigation. (Order, DE 19, at 5).
Whether the Trust is a "business trust" or a "non-commercial trust" did not and
does not now change the Court's holding. (Id.) Similarly, the Trust's argument that
it is a trust which should be afforded treatment as a sole proprietorship also does not
serve as a basis for reconsideration as it is the same argument that the Trust made in
numerous previous filings. (DE 13 at 4-7; DE 15 at 6-7).

28733300.1

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 4 of 11

Nowhere in its motion does the Trust cite to any legal authority in which any
court treated any form of a trust as a sole proprietorship. Without such treatment,
the Trust cannot overcome the fact that in this Circuit a trust must be represented by
a licensed attorney. E.g., In re Darren Buckner Living Trust, No. 12-70036-MHM,
2012 WL 5334749, * 1 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. Oct. 5, 2012); U.S. v. Lena, No. OS-80669CIV, 2007 WL 4578336, * 1 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 27, 2007); see also Hays v. Hamblen
Family Irrevocable Trust (In re Hamblen), 360 B.R. 362 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2006).

Moreover, the Trust and its representatives, James Williams and Peter Papoulias,
have all been previously ordered to obtain legal counsel when proceeding in federal
court. See Order, James A. Williams Trust, et al. v. U.S., 1:10-cv-00753-VJW, DE
27 (Fed. Cl. Dec. 29, 2011)(DE 17-1); see also Order, Peter T. Papoulias Trust v.
U.S., No. 1:13-CV-2110-TWT, at 2 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 3, 2013) (dismissing suit
brought by trust, in part, on basis that the plaintiff trust "must be represented by an
attorney admitted to practice in this district"), attached as Exhibit A.
The Trust's motion should be denied as neither James Williams, Peter
Papoulias, nor anyone other than a licensed attorney should be permitted to
represent the Trust in this Court.
B.

The Trust Failed to Perfect Service of the Defendants.
In the Order, the Court found that Trust "failed to effectuate proper service

28733300.1

-4 -

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 5 of 11

on any of the Defendants." (DE 19 at 12). Now, the Trust requests that this Court
reconsider its decision concerning the failed service of the Defendants,
notwithstanding the fact that the Trust has done nothing but repeat previously
unsuccessful arguments.
The Trust had ample opportunity to perfect service of Defendants within 120
days of filing the Complaint. On June 24, 2013, the Court put the Trust on notice
that its sole attempt to serve all Defendants was deficient ("June 2013 Order," DE
5). Nevertheless, the Trust failed to comport with the June 2013 Order by timely
serving Defendants.
Acknowledging the deficiencies in its previous service efforts, the Trust
nevertheless continues to demonstrate its failure to comply with federal and
Georgia personal service requirements. Perfection of service of Defendant Pettis
has not occurred by any method outlined in Rule 4(e)(2)(A}— a fact the Trust
avoids in its motion for reconsideration. Undeniably, Defendant Pettis has not been
served with both the Summons and the Complaint (1) personally, (2) by leaving
copies at his home, or (3) by delivering copies to a designated agent. Fed. R. Civ.
P. 4(e)(2)(A); See Etris v. Snyder, No. 2:10-CV-00113-RWS, 2013 WL 692811, *3
(N.D. Ga. March 1, 2013). The Trust's attempt to serve Defendant Pettis by
serving "Alisha Smith" did not constitute proper service as Ms. Smith is not

28733300.1

-$ -

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 6 of 11

Defendant Pettis's agent. (Pettis Decl., DE 14-1, at ¶¶ 10-11). The Court correctly
ruled that Defendant Pettis has not been served with process. (Order, DE 19, at 1)
Likewise, the Trust's service attempt of Defendant Fifth Third with a
defective Summons also fails. The Trust cannot deny that the only summons the
Trust obtained in this case was "addressed to Defendant Pettis, rather than
Defendant Fifth Third," as found by this Court. (Id. at 12). Nevertheless, the Trust
continues to argue that its service of Defendant Pettis constituted service of
Defendant Fifth Third. (Motion, DE 21, at 11-12). In support of this flawed
argument, it cites to Henderson v. CherYy, Bekaert &Holland,932 F.2d 1410, 1411
(11th Cir. 1991). In Henderson, an employee of a partnership was personally
served with Summons and Complaint. Id. The Eleventh Circuit found that the
partnership's manager was authorized to accept service on the defendant's behalf
and, thus, that the plaintiff perfected service vis-a-vis personal service. Id. at 1412.
The factual scenario in Henderson is distinguishable from what occurred in
this case for two reasons. First, the Trust did not personally serve Mr. Pettis with
Summons and Complaint, as had occurred in Henderson. Instead, the service that
occurred on September 23, 2013 was an attempt to serve Mr. Pettis through the
registered agent for Defendant Fifth Third. Such a service attempt does not comply
with Rule 4(h). Second, the Summons that the Trust served on Ms. Smith was

28733300.1

-6-

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 7 of 11

directed at "Jermain L. Pettis- Vice-President- Business Banking," a defendant in
this action. (DE 6, DE 14-1 at 3). The Trust cannot— and does not— deny that
this Summons was defective as it was directed at Defendant Pettis, not Defendant
Fifth Third. Such a defect constitutes insufficient process. See Sanderford v.
Prudentiallns. Co. ofAmerica, 902 F.2d 897, 898 (11th Cir. 1990).
The Trust simply has not met its burden of establishing that it perfected
service on any of the Defendants— a necessary requirement for its motion for
reconsideration. Accordingly, the Court's previous ruling concerning the Trust's
failure to effectuate proper service should stand.
C.

The Trust's Demand for "Summary Judgment" Fails.
In its motion for reconsideration, the Trust requests that the Court reconsider

its denial of the Trust's "motion for summary judgment." (Motion, DE 21 at 3 and
24). Such request is unsupported by any legal authority or any factual basis on
which the Court could reconsider its decision as to summary judgment, rendering
the Trust's present request defective for the same reasons already found by this
Court in the Order. (Order, DE 19, at 11).
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper
"only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to

28733300.1

-~

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 8 of 11

any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
law." In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the Court
must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986); Matshuita
Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986). In
the present case, the Trust has not only failed to establish a~ material fact but it
has failed to assert a~ argument to support a judgment as a matter of law.
As outlined in L.R. 56.1(b), motions for summary judgment "shall include...
a separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant
contends there is no genuine issue to be tried." Additionally, each alleged material
fact must be separately numbered and "supported by a citation to evidence of such
fact." Id. In fact the L.R. 56.1(B)(1) specifically states that "the court will not
consider any fact" that:(a) is not supported by a citation to evidence,(2) supported
only by citation to a pleading rather than to evidence,(3) is stated as an issue or
legal conclusion, or (4) is only stated in a brief and not in the statement of facts.
The Trust's present motion fails to comply with any aspect of Local Rule 56.1.
The Trust's claim for summary judgment further misses the mark as it
fails to outline which claims) on which it seeks summary judgment. Nowhere
does the Trust outline the claims) on which it seeks judgment as a matter of law.

28733300.1

Case 1:13-cv-01956-ODE Document 21 Filed 12/18/13 Page 9 of 11

Only as an afterthought, does the Trust reference its alleged entitlement to
summary judgment.
Without the establishment of any facts properly supported by citations to
evidence, there can be no undisputed material facts. Moreover, the Trust has not
established any claim on which it can prevail as a matter of law. Thus, the Court
should deny the Trust's request for summary judgment.
D.

CONCLUSION
The Trust has failed to carry its evidentiary burden to warrant

reconsideration of the Court's November 26, 2013 Order. First, neither James
Williams nor Peter Papoulias may represent the Trust in this matter. Second, the
Trust failed to properly serve Defendants. Third, the Trust fails to provide any
basis on which the Court could reconsider its previous denial of the Trust's request
for "summary judgment." The motion for reconsideration should be dismissed.

Respectfully submitted this 1 Sth day of December, 2013.
