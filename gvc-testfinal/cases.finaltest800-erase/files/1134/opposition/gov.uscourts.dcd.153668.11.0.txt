MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION
TO SEVER FOR IMPROPER JOINDER
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Kathryn Sack (“Sack”) brought this case under the Freedom of Information Act,
5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (collectively “FOIA/PA”), to obtain records
about polygraph testing for use in her graduate research into polygraph bias. Because all of
Sack’s claims within her First Amended Complaint are logically related, she properly joined as
Defendants Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”), Department of Defense (“DOD”), Department
of Justice (“DOJ”), Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), and Office of the Director of
National Intelligence (“ODNI”). (First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4-12 [hereinafter FAC].) Defendants
moved to sever Sack’s First Amended Complaint pursuant to improper joinder under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a), asserting that Sack’s claims are not logically related and do not
arise under a common question of law or fact. However, the standard for joinder under Rule
20(a) is broad and permissive, intended to promote trial convenience and preventing extraneous
litigation. M.K. v. Tenet, 216 F.R.D. 133, 143 (D.D.C. 2002). A motion to sever should only be

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 2 of 12

granted when parties are misjoined under Rule 21 or to avoid prejudice under Rule 42(b) if they
are not severed from the litigation. See Bederson v. United States, 756 F. Supp. 2d 38, 54
(D.D.C. 2010) (acknowledging that read together, Rules 20 and 42(b) allow severance when
parties cannot meet the requirements of joinder under Rule 20 and defendant can show prejudice
as a result of not severing the litigation). In order to determine whether a party has been
misjoined under Rule 20(a), the court must examine two factors: (1) whether the claims arise
under the same transaction or occurrence in that they are logically related, and (2) whether there
is some common question of law or fact. Montgomery v. STG Intern., Inc., 532 F. Supp. 2d 29,
35 (D.D.C. 2008), citing Mosley v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.2d 1330, 1333 (8th Cir. 1974).
Joinder is appropriate here, because Sack’s claims are logically related as they all arise under her
inquiry for records pertaining to polygraph testing, which is directly related to her dissertation
research. Furthermore, FOIA/PA is a statutory scheme that is universally applicable amongst all
Defendants, as all government agencies are subject to the requirements of FOIA/PA, and the
nature of the requested information virtually guarantees that different agencies will make similar
if not identical arguments to withhold similar material. 1
Accordingly, Sack respectfully requests that this Court dismiss Defendants’ Motion to
Sever. Additionally, Sack requests that the Court deny the requested extension of time to

1

Sixteen requests (Counts 1-10, 13-14, 22, 26-27, and 29) were made to intelligence agencies for
information about the polygraph, a procedure used in security screening regularly claimed to be
sensitive. Seven requests (Counts 15-20 and 28) were made to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (“FBI”) for similar records which are primarily maintained by its security and
intelligence components. Three requests (Counts 23-25) were made to OPM, the agency
responsible for conducting security clearance investigations across the federal government. The
only remaining request (Count 21) was made to DOD with the expectation that most responsive
records would be located in DOD intelligence components. Clearly the arguments the
government will make to withhold information from these various requests will be similar if not
completely identical.

respond to the Amended Complaint, as the Court does not need to resolve the claim for
severance before proceeding on the claims for relief within the First Amended Complaint.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Sack is a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, which qualifies as a representative
of an educational institution under within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A). (FAC ¶ 4.)
She has requested several categories of records dealing with polygraph testing in order to
complete her dissertation on polygraph bias. Many of these requests are for identical types of
records maintained by different agencies. (E.g., compare id. ¶¶ 20-33 (CIA “Bias,” “Aggregate
Data,” and “EEO” requests), with id. ¶¶ 40-57 (DIA requests), 58-76 (NSA requests).) Having
exhausted the administrative remedies available to her, Sack filed a complaint against these
agencies on 14 February 2012, which she amended on 11 July 2012 to assert an additional count
against CIA (Count 29). Each claim within the First Amended Complaint deals specifically with
records that have been requested for Sack’s dissertation research regarding polygraph bias.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
When considering whether a party has been properly joined under Rule 20(a), a broad
application is encouraged while remaining consistent with fairness to the parties. M.K., 216
F.R.D. at 143, citing United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 724 (1966)
[hereinafter UMW]. Under Rule 20(a), claims against multiple defendants may be joined if the
claims arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions and there is a common question
of law or fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a). In fact, the question of law or fact may be a common
scheme or pattern of behavior. M.K., 216 F.R.D. at 142, citing In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., No.
99-197, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7397, at *75-76 (D.D.C. 2000). The permissive joinder
standards of Rule 20(a) promote efficient, expeditious litigation in the courts. Bederson, 756 F.
3

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 4 of 12

Supp. 2d at 53-54. The goal of a broad joinder standard is to “prevent multiple lawsuits, extra
expense to the parties, and loss of time to the court.” M.K., 216 F.R.D. at 143, citing UMW, 383
U.S. at 715. Furthermore, the “broadest possible scope of action” when considering the joinder
of parties is “strongly encouraged.” UMW, 383 U.S. at 724. Additionally, a plaintiff is not
required to prove that it meets the standards of Rule 20; rather, a plaintiff is only required to
allege that it is possible to merit joinder. Disparte v. Corp. Exec. Bd., 223 F.R.D. 7, 15-16
(D.D.C. 2004).
ARGUMENT
I.

The Defendant’s Motion to Sever should be denied, because Sack has satisfied the
permissive joinder requirements under Rule 20(a).
Sack’s joinder of Defendants is permissible under Rule 20(a) because the claims against

Defendants logically arise out of the same occurrence or transaction and concern at least one
common question of law or fact. Rule 20(a) sets out two requirements: (1) that the claims arise
out of the same transaction or occurrence, and (2) that there is a common question of law or fact
joining the claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a). When considering whether to sever a claim for
misjoinder under Rule 21, the Rule 20(a) standard is to be interpreted liberally to promote
judicial efficiency and economy. Bederson, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 53-54. Defendants may not
“simply be engaged in similar types of behavior” and the claims may not merely be “premised on
the same legal theory.” Spaeth v. Michigan State Univ. College of Law, No. 11-1376, 2012 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 20742, at *11 (D.D.C. Feb. 17, 2012). Rather, the plaintiff must show the claims to
be logically related and that they share a common question of law or fact. Id. However, while
the second prong of Rule 20(a) requires a related question of law or fact, not all issues have to be

4

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 5 of 12

common to all parties that are joined. Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 35, citing Disparte, 223
F.R.D. at 11.
The first prong requires that the claims arise out of the “same transaction, occurrence, or
series of transactions or occurrences.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a); Bederson, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 53-54.
The second prong requires “only” that there be some common question of law or fact. Fed. R.
Civ. P. 20(a); Bederson, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 54. Under the broad and permissive two-prong test
for joinder for Rule 20(a), Sack meets both requirements and has properly joined all five
Defendants.
A.

Sack meets the first prong of the test for joinder under Rule 20(a) because
the claims are logically related.

Under the first prong of the test, the claims must be logically related. Moore v. N.Y.
Cotton Exchange, 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926). In determining what constitutes a claim that is
logically related, the “impulse is toward entertaining the broadest possible scope of action
consistent with fairness to the parties.” Lane v. Tschetter, No. 05-1414, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
49524, at *20 (D.D.C. July 10, 2007), quoting UMW, 383 U.S. at 724. This standard is intended
to be flexible, as it promotes judicial efficiency. Disparte, 223 F.R.D. at 11, citing UMW, 383
U.S at 724. Claims may not be considered to have arisen “under the same transaction or
occurrence” if they consist of similar acts but occur at different times under differing
circumstances. Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 35.
In her complaint, Sack has joined Defendants CIA, DOD, DOJ, ODNI, and OPM in a
case dealing with her FOIA/PA requests to those various agencies. The logical relationship
between Sack’s claims is simple fact that all the requests are for similar records about polygraphs
and polygraph bias. (FAC passim.) Defendants’ baseless assertion that each agency’s situation

5

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 6 of 12

is different and unique “does not automatically bring such claims outside the same transaction or
occurrence” and is without merit. Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 36, citing Puricelli v. CNA
Ins. Co, 185 F.R.D. 139, 142 (N.D.N.Y. 1999). While each agency is not expected to have the
exact same records, and therefore the claims will not be identical, each agency is expected to
have similar types of records and is expected to claim similar reasons for withholding at least
some of them. Each claim arose “out of the same transaction or occurrence” in that the vast
majority of the requests were filed within a limited time of each other and as part of a concerted
effort to obtain U.S. government records about polygraphs.
Though Defendants contend that joinder is inappropriate because Sack has not proven
that Defendants have not acted in concert to deny or otherwise obstruct her FOIA/PA requests,
this assertion misses the mark. Unlike the plaintiff in Spaeth, Sack is not dealing with separate
institutions with separate policies. Whereas each defendant in Spaeth had its own independent
hiring criteria, each of the agencies named as a defendant in this case is bound by the exact same
restrictions under FOIA/PA.
Additionally, it is common practice to file FOIA/PA requests with multiple agencies for
similar materials. As a result these agencies are often joined as defendants in the same litigation
dealing with those very same FOIA/PA requests. See, e.g., Am. Civil Liberties Union v. DOD,
628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (joining DOD and CIA); Feinman v. FBI, 713 F. Supp. 2d 70
(D.C. Cir. 2010) (joining FBI and the DOJ Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys); Greenberg v.
Dep’t of the Treasury, 10 F. Supp. 2d 3 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (joining Treasury, DOJ, State, and
CIA); Oglesby v. Dep’t of the Army, 79 F.3d 1172 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (joining Army, CIA, FBI,
NARA, NSA, and State); Exxonmobil Corp. v. Dep’t of Commerce, 828 F. Supp. 2d 97 (D.D.C.
2011) (joining Commerce and the EPA); Physicians for Human Rights v. DOD, 675 F. Supp. 2d
6

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 7 of 12

149 (D.D.C. 2009) (joining DOD, DIA, USSOCOM and USCENTCOM); Brehm v. DOD, 577 F.
Supp. 2d 446 (D.D.C. 2008) (joining DOD and CIA); Trulock v. DOJ, 257 F. Supp. 2d 48
(D.D.C. 2003) (joining DOJ, CIA, and DOE). 2 In this case, all the requested records relate to a
fairly narrow subject, making joinder appropriate. If anything, it is too early in the litigation to
determine the degree of similarity between the respective agencies’ records. See Montgomery,
532 F. Supp. 2d at 36 (explaining that severance would be premature as the plaintiffs had
“alleged a possible basis to meet Rule 20’s requirements,” which was sufficient to meet the
standard of Rule 20).
B.

Sack meets the second prong of the test for joinder under Rule 20(a) because
the claims arise under some common law or fact.

The second prong of the Rule 20 test requires that the joined claims must share a common
question of law or fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a). Like the first prong of the test, this prong should
also be construed liberally. Davidson v. Dist. of Columbia, 736 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119-120
(D.D.C. 2010). Claims that challenge denials of similar FOIA/PA requests implicate a common
question of law or fact. Though Defendants assert that the second prong of Rule 20 is not met
because not every agency is being pursued under the same legal theory, the standard for Rule 20
does not require every legal theory to be identical for every party, so long as there is some
common question of law or fact. Davidson, 736 F. Supp. 2d at 120; Montgomery, 532 F. Supp.
2d. at 35. Sack clearly alleges that there is some common law or fact shared amongst the joined
claims. While it is true that some of the requests have not been completed yet while others have
been, in FOIA/PA litigation a cause of action brought under a constructive denial theory does not
evaporate when the agency responds to the request. For all of the agencies sued under this

2

This list is far from a comprehensive list of all cases in this Circuit where this is true.
7

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 8 of 12

theory, they will also have to justify any withholdings they make once they do process the
requests. Of the five agencies joined as Defendants, not one has provided fully unredacted
records in response to any of Sack’s requests, of which the requests in this case are but a subset.
Despite the unassailable fact that the U.S. government considers polygraph records to be very
sensitive, Defendants expect the Court to accept that at one point or another in each agency’s
processing of Sack’s requests, it will not withhold some information citing one of only a handful
of justifications that will also be invoked by the others. Such an expectation is wholly
unrealistic, and the expected similarity between the withholding justifications made for these
polygraph records is more than sufficient to warrant joinder.
Contrary to Defendants’ argument that “common issues of law does not mean common
issues of an area of law,” the standard for Rule 20 does mean “common legal or factual
questions.” Spaeth, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *3 (emphasis added). While the test does not
allow for these claims merely to be “premised on the same legal theory,” id. at *11, under the
liberal standards of Rule 20, Sack’s allegations constitute the presence of a common question of
law or fact. Bederson, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 54. Furthermore, as Defendants have not yet even
answered the First Amended Complaint, it is too early in the litigation to rule out that there are
no additional common questions of law or fact. See Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 36
(asserting that severance too early in litigation would be inappropriate and premature if it stifled
discovery).
II.

The lawsuit, as postured, is not overly burdensome to the Court nor is it prejudicial
under Rules 21 and 42(b).
The synergy between Rule 42 for consolidation and Rule 21 for severance furthers the

policy of judicial expediency and the prevention of prejudice. Rule 42 generally grants the Court

8

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 9 of 12

the discretion to consolidate cases sharing common issues of law or fact provided that the
consolidation “would serve the interests of judicial economy, and the parties would not be
prejudiced.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Energy, 207 F.R.D. 8, 8 (D.D.C. 2002).
Conversely, the Court may sever under Rule 21 when the improper joinder of cases under Rule
20 impedes judicial economy and creates prejudice. See Bederson, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 53
(explaining that the Defendant moved for severance for misjoinder under Rule 21 and 42(b),
claiming prejudice). Rule 42(b), read in conjunction with Rule 21, allows the Court to sever
claims “in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be
conducive to expedition and economy.” See Disparte, 223 F.R.D. at 12, citing Fed. R. Civ. P.
42(b). Severing the claims and going forward with five distinct lawsuits would distinctly hinder
judicial economy. 3 Further, Defendants are not prejudiced by a denial of severance.
Defendants’ Motion to Sever does not include any motion to transfer or otherwise change
the venue of any of the claims. If severed, all five claims will remain in the present venue, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Further, Defendants cannot claim the need for
severance based on prejudice, because if Sack’s claims are severed, all the lawsuits will be still
be adjudicated in the same jurisdiction. 4 This is contrary to the very essence of judicial
efficiency and creates unnecessary and extraneous litigation. See Middlebrooks v. Godwin Corp.,

3

Furthermore, it is not even clear how the dividing lines would be drawn between severed
counts. Defendants’ arguments about claims needing to be severed according to their respective
places in the FOIA/PA process lie at right angles to their arguments that the claims should be
severed along agency lines. Defendants stumble over their own arguments in an attempt to
“throw something at the wall that sticks,” succeeding only in proving the complete lack of merit
behind this frivolous and dilatory Motion.
4

Moreover, given the common threads running between the counts, any severed cases would be
filed as “related cases,” which would bring them right back before this Court.
9

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 10 of 12

279 F.R.D. 8,12 (D.D.C. 2011) (explaining that grouping claims that have the same legal root
avoids the “squandering of resources in unnecessary proceedings”).
Additionally, the argument that Defendants are prejudiced because the litigation “can
only proceed to final judgment as quickly as the slowest components” has little merit when
Defendants then proceed to further delay the litigation by delaying their responses to the
complaint. (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Sever for Improper Joinder at 6, 7.) Though the claims may
be severed, there is no guarantee that each of the individual claims would proceed any faster
through the Court’s docket independently. Plus, while the case may not “proceed to final
judgment” as soon as Defendants’ like, the Court is fully capable of handling staggered motions
for summary judgment, as is standard practice in such cases, and it would not create an
administrative burden sufficiently distinct from those normally imposed on litigants in the federal
system. All litigants must endure staggered motions and divergent timelines for responses as a
part of the procedural process of litigation, regardless of whether there is one defendant or five.
Though denying severance may not “expedite the resolution of the lawsuit,” Disparte, 223
F.R.D. at 10 (emphasis added), it will promote the conservation of judicial resources and avoid
unnecessary additional proceedings. Middlebrooks, 279 F.R.D. at 12. In fact, since at least one
count for each Defendant has yet to be processed by the respective agency, severing the case
along agency lines would not even expedite the resolution of any of the newly severed cases.
Finally, addressing Defendants’ assertion that attorneys’ fees, should Sack prevail, would
be too difficult to segregate, this fact even if true would not be prejudicial to Defendants. This
factor is only prejudicial if the Court is unable to find an equitable resolution at the time of the

10

Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 11 Filed 07/30/12 Page 11 of 12

fee petition, and Sack remains confident that the Court is fully capable of equitably segregating
the appropriate fees at the appropriate time should the need arise. 5
In short, Defendants’ Motion is frivolous and dilatory and has been offered (without any
citation to any precedent in this or any other court) only to obtain a litigation advantage by
attempting to ensure that the largest number of judges possible review their similar arguments
regarding similar records, so as to mitigate any losses. This case was randomly assigned to this
Court according to the established rules, and the Court should not indulge Defendants’
transparent attempt at judge-shopping. After extensive research the undersigned has been unable
to locate a single case where a court has severed individual FOIA/PA counts from each other in
the fashion requested by Defendants. 6 If Defendants had a non-dilatory purpose for filing this
Motion, they would not have sought to delay every other filing until after this Motion was
decided.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Sack respectfully requests that the Court dismiss Defendants’
Motion to Sever. As an interim measure, Sack further requests that the Court order Defendants
to promptly respond to the First Amended Complaint and remove the stay currently in force on
the briefing.
A proposed Order accompanies this Opposition.

5

Not to mention that it is the undersigned’s standard practice to segregate his billing according to
count in complex litigation to avoid just this problem.
6

The undersigned concedes that he located one case in which a court severed a FOIA count from
the rest of a FOIA complaint because the plaintiff did not even allege that the requests were
related in any fashion. See Robert v. DOJ, No. 05-2543, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33793, at *30
n.2 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 12, 2005). In contrast, Plaintiff has always maintained that the requests at
issue in this case are logically related, rendering Robert inapposite.
