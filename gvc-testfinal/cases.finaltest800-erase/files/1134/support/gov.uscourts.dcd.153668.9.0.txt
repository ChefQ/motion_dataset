MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO SEVER FOR IMPROPER JOINDER

As originally filed, this lawsuit involved approximately twenty-eight FOIA requests
directed to five distinct agencies (or components within those agencies). Five were made to the
Central Intelligence Agency; twelve to the Department of Defense; six to the Department of
Justice; three to the Office of Personnel Management; and one to the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence. On July 11, 2012, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint to add an
additional count based on yet another FOIA request directed to the CIA.'

While a plaintiff may join multiple claims against a single party without limitation, see
Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a), the rules are more stringent as to when a plaintiff can join multiple parties
in a single lawsuit. As discussed more fully below, a plaintiff "`cannot join defendants who

simply engaged in similar types of behavior, but who are otherwise unrelated; some allegation of

 

`Pursuant to the Court's minute order dated May 14, 2012, Defendants' time to answer or otherwise
respond to the Complaint was extended to, and including, July 13, 2012. Plaintiff's filing of an Amended Complaint
on July 11, 2012 extends that deadline to the later of "the time remaining to respond to the original pleading or
within 14 days after service of the amended pleading." FRCP 15(a)(3). Plaintiff provided a copy of the Amended
Complaint by email dated July 11, 2012, and, therefore, Defendants' deadline to respond to the Amended Complaint
(incorporating the three additional days under FRCP 6(d) due to the manner of service) currently is July 30, 2012.

concerted action between defendants is required." Spaeth v. Michigan State Univ. College of
Law, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20742, at *11 (D.D.C. Feb. 17, 2012) (quoting Grynberg v. Alaska
Pipeline Co., 1997 WL 33763820, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 1997)) (emphasis in original; other
citations omitted). Joinder is therefore inappropriate here, where Plaintiff has not alleged that the
Defendants conspired or otherwise acted in concert in their response to her FOJA requests, but
simply seeks to combine what are properly five distinct lawsuits into a single action. That
Plaintiff's claims all arise under FOIA, and relate in some fashion to the subject matter of
polygraph testing, is by itself not sufficient to support joinder under Federal Rule of Civil

~ Procedure ("Rule") 20.

Accordingly, the Amended Complaint should be severed into five separate lawsuits and
Plaintiff ordered to file amended complaints in each severed action, setting forth her claims
against the appropriate defendant in each action. Defendants also request that any further
response to the Amended Complaint be deferred pending resolution of this motion.

ARGUMENT
I. Planitiff Cannot Meet the Two-Prong Test For Joinder Required by Rule 20

Rule 21 provides that a "court may .. . sever any claim against a party." Fed. R. Civ. P.
21. To determine whether parties are improperly joined under Rule 21, "courts apply the
permissive joinder requirements of Rule 20(a)." Davidson v. Dist. of Columbia, 736 F.Supp. 2d
115, 119 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Montgomery v. STG Int'l, Inc., 532 F.Supp.2d 29, 35 (D.D.C.
2008)). Rule 20 sets out a two-prong test for joinder, allowing defendants to be properly joined
if "any right to relief is asserted against them . . . with respect to or arising out of the same

transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences," and if "any question of law or

 
Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document9 Filed 07/12/12 Page 5 of 10

fact common to all defendants will arise in the action." Spaeth, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *9-10
(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 20). Each prong must be satisfied to permit joinder of parties. See Fed.
R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).

To meet the first prong, claims "arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series
of transactions or occurrences," must be "logically related." Spaeth, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at
*11. A plaintiff "cannot join defendants who simply engaged in similar types of behavior, but
who are otherwise unrelated; some allegation of concerted action between defendants is
required." Id. With regard to the second prong, claims merely "premised on the same legal
theory [are] insufficient for showing that they raise common `questions of law or fact.'" Jd. at

*13,

In Spaeth, the plaintiff tried to join in a single lawsuit claims of age discrimination
against multiple law schools to whom he had submitted applications for employment, alleging
that each of the law schools made offers to other candidates who were younger and less qualified
than him. The court severed these claims into separate lawsuits because, "other than `the fact
that [Spaeth's] claims all arise under' the ADEA, Spaeth has `offered nothing to suggest that the
claims are logically related in any way.'" Jd. at *12. The court specifically noted that Spaeth
"has not alleged that defendants conspired in declining to interview him or offer him a job, nor
has he claimed that they acted pursuant to a shared policy." Jd.

As in Spaeth, the Plaintiff here fails both the first and second prong of the Rule 20 test for
permissive joinder because her various FOIA claims against the multiple agencies are not
"logically related," nor do they all share a common question of law or fact. See Spaeth, 2012

U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *11. Plaintiff fails under the first prong because she does not allege any

 
Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document9 Filed 07/12/12 Page 6 of 10

concerted action between Defendants. And, while her requests were all filed and processed
under the FOIA, she has not asserted that each defendant acted pursuant to a shared policy in
responding to her FOIA requests. To the contrary, as Plaintiff notes in her complaint, the FOIA
requests are all presently at different stages in the administrative process. She claims that some
agencies failed to produce any documents in response to the requests (Am. Compl. [J 43, 49,
55); others allegedly failed to locate responsive documents (Am. Compl. ff 102, 110); others
allegedly denied the public interest fee waiver and have yet to make a final determination on
Plaintiff's appeal (Am. Compl. {J 83-84); and other agencies allegedly failed to formally
acknowledge receipt of the request (Am. Compl. 7 96). Plaintiff's acknowledgment that the
FOIA requests are all at different administrative stages evinces that there was no "concerted
action between defendants." See Grynberg v. Alaska Pipeline Co., 1997 WL 33763820 at *1
(D.D.C., 1997). Other than the fact that the claims all arise under FOIA, Plaintiff has "offered .
nothing to suggest the claims are logically related in any way." See Davidson, 736 F. Supp. 2d at
121.

Plaintiff has also failed to meet the second prong of the Rule 20 test because she has
made no showing that there will be common questions of law or fact among the FOIA claims
against the five Defendants. Even if basing her lawsuits on the same statute was enough to join
these claims - which it is not, see Spaeth, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51653 at *13 - Plaintiff is not
even pursuing the same legal theory against each agency under the FOIA. For instance, she
challenges the CIA's determination that her request was too broad (Am. Compl. J 185), the
NSA's denial of her requests for public interest fee waivers (Am. Compl. { 83), the FBI's denial

of her requests due to 3" party concerns and the adequacy of the FBI's search for responsive

 
Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document 9 Filed 07/12/12 Page 7 of 10

records (Am. Compl. ff 110, 116, 189), and the ATF's decision to release redacted records (Am.
Compl. 0x00A7 171). These are separate theories that are unlikely to present common questions of law
or fact.

While the requests fall in some fashion under the umbrella of polygraph testing, Plaintiff
is not seeking a uniform set of documents from among the five Defendants, but rather is seeking
information that each agency maintains, if at all, regarding various matters having some
connection to polygraph testing, including with respect to data on polygraph testing, equal
employment opportunity rules and polygraphs. (Am. Compl. ff 14, 21, 27, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59,
66, 72). Although Plaintiff refers to some of these requests as being "substantially similar" in the
type of information being sought, Plaintiff does not allege that she expects the agencies to have
the same records. Moreover, other requests are specifically targeted to particular agencies, such
as the request to DIA for "Department of Defense Polygraph Institute ("DoDPI") and Defense
Academy of Credibility Assessment ("DACA") records about polygraphers and polygraph
examinations" (Am. Compl. 0x00A7 88), or the request to FIS (a component of OPM) for "records
pertaining to period reviews of federal agencies' polygraph programs" (Am. Compl. { 165), or
the request to CIA for "all correspondence between CIA employees or contractors and Dr. Reed
since 2002." (Am. Compl. 0x00A7 182) Plaintiff claims that some agencies responded that they could
not locate any responsive records (Am. Compl. ff 102, 115, 141), whereas others are at different
stages of the administrative process. Thus, Plaintiff cannot show that there are common

questions of law or fact among her myriad of requests to these five agencies.

II. As Currently Postured, the Lawsuit is Overly Burdensome and Prejudicial to
Defendants

Rule 20, is designed to "promote trial convenience and expedite the resolution of
lawsuits." Disparte v. Corporate Executive Bd., 223 F.R.D. 7, 10 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting
Puricelli vy. CNA Insurance Co., 185 F.R.D. 139, 142 (N.D.N.Y. 1999)) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Specifically, the "logical relationship" test is a flexible standard, the purpose of which
is "[to] entertain[] the broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties."
Disparte, 223 F.R.D. at 10 (quoting United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715,
724 (1966)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, allowing the case to go forward without
severance would not only prejudice the Defendants, but also would not be in the interest of
judicial economy.

As currently postured, this lawsuit can only proceed to final judgment as quickly as the
slowest of its component parts. With respect to some requests, some agencies have stated that no
responsive records have been located and therefore only the adequacy of the search conducted by
those agencies as to those requests is at issue (Am. Compl. 4] 103, 110). Other requests are at
different stages of processing among the various agencies, and depending on the amount of
documents at issue and the FOIA exemptions implicated, the processing times will differ among
these agencies. By combining mutiple FOIA requests directed to multiple agencies in a single
lawsuit, this lawsuit will be prolonged unnecessarily for the agencies who are able to complete
their processing and address any outstanding issues on a faster timetable than others. Under Rule
54(b), moreover, no decision in favor of any agency would be final until all claims in the case are

resolved.

 
Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document9 Filed 07/12/12 Page 9 of 10

In addition, FOIA cases are resolved by dispositive motion following the processing of all
responsive, non-exempt documents subject to FOIA that can be located based on a reasonable
search. Given the number of claims at issue and the different processing times, it would be
unwieldy, unfair and impractical for the agencies to address all claims in a single, dispositive
motion. Staggered motions for summary judgment would also pose an administrative burden as
they likely would be filed at different times depending on when processing has been completed.
To the extent that there are any common issues of law or fact, the Court would need to defer
ruling until the last of the motions are filed to avoid piecemeal adjudication. Rather than
"expedit[ing] the resolution of [the lawsuit]," this posture is likely to delay resolution of the
various claims involved in this case. See Disparte, 223 F.R.D. at 10.

Finally, to the extent that Plaintiff is successful on her FOIA claims as to one or more of
the parties, and seeks to recover attorney's fees, it will be very difficult to segregate the fees
between the unsuccessful and successful claims, or among the agencies against whom plaintiff
prevails. This posture could prove particularly prejudicial to the agencies against whom fees are
sought, as they could end up paying fees for time spent on claims on which plaintiff was not
successful.

Il. The Court Should Defer The Time Period for Defendants To Answer Until After
Resolution of This Motion.

Pursuant to the Court's order dated May 14, 2012, Defendants were afforded until, and
including, July 13, 2012, to "answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint." Plaintiffs filing of
an Amended Complaint on July 11, 2012 extends that deadline to July 30, 2012. See supra note

1. To the extent the filing of this motion is not itself sufficient to defer an answer to the

 
Case 1:12-cv-00537-CRC Document9 Filed 07/12/12 Page 10 of 10

Amended Complaint pending its resolution, Defendants move the Court to extend the deadline
for Defendants to answer pending resolution of this motion. In the event the Court grants the
motion, Plaintiff should be required to file amended complaints in each of the severed actions -
asserting claims to the respective defendant in each action, which Defendants can then each
answer in due course (Defendants propose 30 days). In the event the Court denies this motion,
Defendants will require additional time to answer the unwieldly Amended Complaint in this
action, which consists of almost 200 paragraphs. In that event, defendants would request an
additional 45 days to answer.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant their
motion to sever.
