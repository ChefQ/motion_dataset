OCWEN'S' MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS' FIRST
AMENDED COMPLAINT AND STRIKE JURY TRIAL DEMAND

The Court should dismiss Johnnie Hayes and Priscilla Davis' first amended complaint"
because, like their original complaint, it is comprised of mere labels and legal conclusions
insufficient to establish a facially plausible claim against Ocwen for violations of the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), Truth in Lending Act (TILA), Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act (FDCPA), or Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act (FCCPA). If the claims
are allowed to proceed, the Court should strike plaintiffs' jury trial demand because they waived
their right to a jury trial as part of their mortgage loan.

I, FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs brought this action seeking damages against Ocwen based on four counts: (i)

violation of RESPA; (ii) violation of TILA; (iii) violation of the FDCPA; and (iv) violation of

 

' Oewen means defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC,

* The Court should also strike plaintiffs' first amended complaint because it was filed without leave of
court or Ocwen's written consent in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15,

the FCCPA. (See DE 63, FAC {ff 1, 56, 58, 62, 66-68.) Although the first amended complaint
also demands declaratory and injunctive relief in its opening paragraph, none of the four counts
actually requests such relief. (See DE 63, FAC 4f 1, 53-68).

For their RESPA claim, plaintiffs allege Ocwen violated 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2605 by not
responding to their self-described "qualified written request" allegedly sent to Ocwen on April
15, 2013. (See DE 63, FAC 4 42, 56.) Plaintiffs fail to attach a copy of their purported RESPA
request to their complaint and, aside from vague allegations of document requests, error
correction, account adjustment, and information requests, do not describe the nature of their
alleged request or how it relates to the servicing of their mortgage loan. (See DE 63, FAC 9 42,
55-56.)

For their TILA claim, plaintiffs allege Ocwen violated 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1641(g). Plaintiffs
appear to base their claim on the loan being transferred to U.S. Bank National Association, as
Trustee for Structured Asset Investment Loan Trust Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
2006-2 (U.S. Bank), upon one of the following events: (i) the trust closing date of March 1,
2006; (ii) the loan allegedly being assigned to U.S, Bank at some point prior to the mortgage
foreclosure action filed on August 27, 2009; and/or (iii) an assignment of mortgage executed on
October 28, 2009, and "filed" on February 4, 2010. (See DE 63, FAC Jf 20, 31-32, 36.)
Plaintiffs also reference a purported sale, assignment, or transfer from Chase Fulfillment Center
(CFC) to Ocwen in April of 2012 and allege CFC, U.S, Bank, and BNC Mortgage, Inc., did not
provide plaintiffs with notice of the sale, assignment, or transfer (See DE 63, FAC {J 22, 26-27.)

For their FDCPA claim, plaintiffs baldly allege Ocwen is a debt collector and violated
several FDCPA provisions, including, but not limited to: 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692d; 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1692e(2), (6), (8), (10), (11), and (14); 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692f(1) and (6); and 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692(g),

Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 3 of 13

(See DE 63, FAC {ff 61-62.) Plaintiffs' allegations are mere recitations of the applicable
statutory provisions without any supporting factual allegations as to Ocwen's conduct.

For their FCCPA claim, plaintiffs allege Ocwen violated section 559,715, Florida
Statutes, by "fail[ing] to provide notice of assignment... ." (See DE 63, FAC 0x00A7 67.) Plaintiffs
also allege Ocwen violated section 559.72(9) and (15). (See DE 63, FAC yen0x00A7 68-69.) Like their
FDCPA allegations, plaintiffs FCCPA allegations merely parrot the applicable statutory
provisions without any attempt to connect Ocwen's actual conduct to the alleged violations.

Il, LEGAL ARGUMENT AND GROUNDS FOR RELIEF
A, Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Cause of Action Under RESPA,

Plaintiffs fail to adequately plead the elements of a RESPA violation, "[T]o state a claim
for violation of RESPA 0x00A7 2605(e), plaintiffs must allege facts showing that: (1) defendant is a
loan servicer, (2) plaintiffs sent defendant a valid [qualified written request], (3) defendant failed
to adequately respond within the [applicable] statutory period, and (4) plaintiffs are entitled to
actual or statutory damages. See Marsh v, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 2011 WL 1196415,
8 (M.D. Fla. 2011),

1, Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Valid Qualified Written Request.

Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action under RESPA because, aside from attaching the
labels of "RESPA letter" and "qualified written request" to their correspondence, they fail to
allege a sufficient basis to conclude their correspondence was, in fact, a qualified written request.
(See DE 63, FAC ff 42, 55-56.) To fall within the definition of a qualified written request under
RESPA, a request must: (i) be in writing on a document other than a payment coupon or other
payment form supplied by the servicer; (ii) include information enabling the servicer to identify
the name and account of the borrower; (iii) include a statement of the reasons the borrower
(27586647; 1}

Page 3 of 13
AKERMAN LLP, 222 LAKEVIEW AVENUE, SUITE 400, WesT PALM BEACH, FL. 33401

 
Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 4 of 13

believes the account is in error, if applicable, or that provides sufficient detail to the servicer as
to other information sought by the borrower; and (iv) relate to servicing. See 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7
2605(e); and 12 C.F.R. 0x00A7 1024,21(e), Plaintiffs are required to establish they sent a valid
qualified written request to state a cause of action under RESPA. See Marsh, 2011 WL 1196415
at 8 (dismissing RESPA claim where notice attached to complaint demonstrated it did not meet
the elements of a qualified written request),

The only elements of a qualified written request arguably satisfied from a pleading
perspective is that a written request was sent to Ocwen as a loan servicer, (See DE 63, FAC 4
42, 50, 54-56.) In addition to the lack of factual allegations, portions of the complaint suggest
plaintiffs' letter was not a qualified written request in that it demanded copies of the original
promissory note and origination documents. (See DE 63, FAC 4 42, 50.); See Echeverria v.
BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 900 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1306-1307 (M.D. Fla. 2012) (finding
request for a copy of the promissory note not a qualified written request); and Ward v. Security
Atlantic Mortg. Elec. Registration Systems, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 561, 574-75 (E.D.N.C. 2012)
(finding letter seeking "copies of loan documents, assignments of the deed of trust and
promissory note and copies of property inspection reports and appraisals and a loan transaction
history" not a qualified written request.),

2, Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Actual and/or Statutory Damages.

Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action under RESPA because their request for "actual,
statutory, treble and/or punitive damages" fails as a matter of law. RESPA does not provide for
treble or punitive damages. See 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2605(f)(1). In the case of an action by an
individual, RESPA does permit a borrower to recover actual damages and, "in the case of a
pattern or practice of noncompliance," statutory damages "in an amount not to exceed $1,000."
{27586647;1}

AKERMAN LLP, 222 LAKEVIEW AVENUE, SUITE 400, WEST PALM BEACH, FL 33401

 
Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 5 of 13

Id. Plaintiffs do not allege they suffered any actual damages as a result of Ocwen's purported
RESPA violation and, while they could theoretically rely solely on statutory damages, they fail
to allege a "pattern or practice of noncompliance" to support such an award, which renders their
claim improper. See Echeverria, 900 F. Supp. 2d at 1307-1308.

B. Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Cause of Action Under TILA."

, Plaintiffs do not Allege Ocwen Violated TILA.

Plaintiffs' allegations involving an assignment to U.S. Bank would not impose any
obligation on Ocwen to notify plaintiffs of the assignment. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1641(g) (imposing
obligation on the "new owner or assignee"), Even assuming plaintiffs' confusing allegation that
"[CFC] ... sold, assigned, or transferred the alleged obligation on or about April of 2012 the
exact date is unknowable because [CFC] did not sent a notice of sell [sic], assignment, or transfer
of the alleged obligation to [Ocwen], a breach of contract and violation of 15 U.S.C, 1692,"
related to plaintiffs' TILA claim, plaintiffs do not allege Ocwen failed to provide notice of the
purported sale, transfer, or assignment in violation of 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1641(g). (See DE 63, FAC J
22, 26-27.)

2. Plaintiffs' Purported TILA Claim is Barred by the Statute of Limitations.

Even if plaintiffs stated a cognizable TILA claim, which they do not, any such claim is
barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1640(e); and Connell v.
CitiMortgage, Inc., 2012 WL 5511087, 8 (S.D. Ala. 2012). At best, plaintiffs vaguely allege a
transfer to Ocwen in April of 2012, meaning their purported TILA claim expired in May of 2013.
(See DE 1, Compl. 4 22.); See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1640(e). Plaintiffs filed this action in June of 2013-

at least two weeks after the expiration of the statute of limitations. Because the time-barred

 

* Plaintiffs do not explicitly reference Ocwen in their TILA count, but to the extent their allegations could
be read as asserting a TILA claim against Ocwen, the claim fails as a matter of law,

AKERMAN LLP, 222 LAKEVIEW AVENUE, SUITE 400, West PALM BEACH, FL 33401

 
Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 6 of 13

nature of plaintiffs' TILA claim is apparent from the face of their complaint, their TILA claim
should be dismissed with prejudice.
C. Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Cause of Action Under the FDCPA.

Plaintiffs fail to adequately plead the elements of an FDCPA violation, "In order to
prevail on an FDCPA claim, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the plaintiff has been the object of
collection activity arising from consumer debt, (2) the defendant is a debt collector, and (3) the
defendant has engaged in an act or omission prohibited by the FDCPA." Bentley v. Bank of Am.,
773 F, Supp. 2d 1367, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2011).

l, Plaintiffs Fail to Adequately Plead Ocwen is a Debt Collector.

Under the FDCPA, "[t]he term 'debt collector' means any person who uses any
instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of
which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect directly or
indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692a(6). The
FDCPA contains a number of exemptions under the definition of debt collector, but most
notably, it exempts "any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or
asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity .. . concerns a debt which was not
in default at the time it was obtained by such person." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692a(6)(F)(iii), Failure to
allege the debt was in default at the time Ocwen obtained its servicing rights is fatal to plaintiffs'
claim. See Benjamin v, CitiMortgage, Inc., 2013 WL 1891284, 3 (S.D. Fla. 2013) (dismissing
FDCPA claim where "the plaintiffs ... failed to allege that the subject debt was in default at the
time it was transferred to the defendant loan servicer... .").

While plaintiffs attach the label of "debt collector" to Ocwen, they fail to allege any facts
that would make it plausible Ocwen is, in fact, a debt collector. As a result, their FDCPA claim
{2758664751}

AKERMAN LLP, 222 LAKEVIEW AVENUE, SuITE 400, West PALM BEACH, FL 33401'
Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 7 of 13

must fail. See Id; and Reese v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 686 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1311 (S.D. Fla.
2009) ("In order to plead adequately under the FDCPA, the Plaintiff must sufficiently allege that
Chase is a 'debt collector,'"),

2. Plaintiffs Fail to Adequately Plead Ocwen Engaged in an Act or Omission
Prohibited by the FDCPA.

Plaintiffs allege Ocwen violated ten provisions of the FDCPA, but fail to allege any facts
to render the alleged violations plausible. (See DE 63, FAC 4 59, 62.) Their FDCPA claim is
comprised of nothing more than a list of paraphrased FDCPA prohibitions with no attempt to
connect those prohibitions to Ocwen's actual conduct. Plaintiffs' complaint does nothing to raise
the alleged FDCPA violations beyond the speculative level. Plaintiffs should not be permitted to
proceed until they plead a facially plausible FDCPA claim against Ocwen and provide Ocwen
with fair notice of the factual basis underlying their claims. See Chalik v. Westport Recovery
Corp., 677 F. Supp. 2d 1322, 1329-1331 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (dismissing claim under 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1692f because "Plaintiff failed to specifically identify how Defendants' conduct was... unfair
and unconscionable under 0x00A7 1692f....").

D. Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Cause of Action Under the FCCPA.

Plaintiffs fail to plead a cause of action under the FCCPA because: (i) the FCCPA does
not attach civil liability to violations of section 559.715; and (ii) plaintiffs fail to plead sufficient
facts to render a violation under other provisions of the FCCPA plausible.

l, The FCCPA Does Not Attach Civil Liability to Violations of Section 559.715.

The "civil remedies" portion of the FCCPA provides that "[a]ny person who fails to
comply with any provision of s. 559,72 is liable for [damages]... ." FLA. STAT. 0x00A7 559.77. As

part of their claim, plaintiffs seek damages for Ocwen's alleged violation of section 559.715.

{27586647;1}
Page 7 of 13
AKERMAN LLP, 222 LAKEVIEW AVENUE, SUITE 400, WEST PALM BEACH, FL 33401

 
Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 8 of 13

(See DE 63, FAC 0x00A7 67.) Because the plain terms of the FCCPA do not attach civil liability to a
violation of section 559.715, the claim must be dismissed with prejudice.

2. Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Sufficient Facts to Render a Violation of the FCCPA by
Ocwen Plausible.

Plaintiffs allege Ocwen violated sections 559,.72(9) and (15), but fail to plead any facts to
render the alleged violations plausible. (See DE 63, FAC ff 68-69.) Like their FDCPA claim,
plaintiffs' FCCPA claim is comprised of nothing more than paraphrased FCCPA prohibitions
with no attempt to connect those prohibitions to Ocwen's actual conduct, and their claim should
be dismissed. See Reese, 686 F. Supp. 2d at 1309-1310.

E. Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Any Basis for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.

While the introductory paragraph of plaintiffs' first amended complaint states "[t]his is an
action... for declaratory and injunctive relief," plaintiffs do not actually request injunctive relief
in any of their three counts, as recognized by the Court's order on plaintiff's TRO for emergency
injunctive and declaratory relief. (See DE 1, Compl. {ff 1, 46-50, 51-52, 53-55). Moreover,
TILA, RESPA, and the FDCPA do not provide for private injunctive relief. See Christ vy.
Beneficial Corp., 547 F. 3d 1292, 1298 (11th Cir, 2008) (TILA); 12 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2605(f) (RESPA);
and Weiss v, Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 341 (3rd Cir, 2004) (FDCPA). As such, the
Court should dismiss plaintiffs' request for injunctive and declaratory relief.

F. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint Cannot Survive a Motion to Dismiss,

"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of
the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief." FED. R. Civ, P, 8(A)(2). "A pleading that
offers 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will
not do." Ashcroft v. Igbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550

U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient

{27586647,1}
Page 8 of 13
AKERMAN LLP, 222 LAKEVIEW AVENUE, SUITE 400, WEST PALM BEACH, FL 33401

 
Case 9:13-cv-80610-KAM Document 73 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/09/2013 Page 9 of 13

factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Jd.
(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Plaintiffs' first amended complaint must be dismissed
because it fails to meet this standard and present a facially plausible claim for relief.
G. Plaintiffs' Jury Trial Demand Should be Stricken.

As part of their first amended complaint, plaintiffs demand a trial by jury. The mortgage
executed by plaintiffs contains the following provision:

25. Jury Trial Waiver. The Borrower hereby waives any right to a trial

by jury in any action, proceeding, claim, or counterclaim, whether in contract or

tort, at law or in equity, arising out of or in any way related to this Security

Instrument or the Note.
A copy of the mortgage is attached as Exurpir A. Plaintiffs' RESPA, TILA, FDCPA, and
FCCPA claims are made in connection with the loan secured by the mortgage. (See DE 63, FAC
q% 20, 31, 42, 42.) Plaintiffs' claims are, therefore, "related to" the mortgage loan, and the jury
trial demand should be stricken pursuant to the mortgage. See Foley v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
849 F, Supp. 2d 1345, 1352 (S.D. Fla. 2012). Ocwen, as the loan servicer, is entitled to enforce
the jury trial waiver provision, See Fahey v. Am. Home Mortg. Servicing, Case No. 11-62544, 3
(S.D. Fla, Dec. 11, 2012) (permitting loan owner and servicer to enforce jury trial waiver in
mortgage); but see Omega v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas, 2013 WL 425836 (S.D. Fla.

2013) (permitting only loan owner to enforce jury trial waiver in mortgage); and Williams vy.

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2011 WL 4901346 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (same),

ILI, CONCLUSION

The Court should dismiss plaintiffs' first amended complaint because it fails to present a
facially plausible claim for relief against Ocwen for violations of RESPA, TILA, the FDCPA,
and the FCCPA. Plaintiffs have not properly pled a valid qualified written request or entitlement
to actual and/or statutory damages. Any purported claim plaintiffs might be alleging against
Ocwen is barred by the one-year statute of limitations. Their purported FDCPA and FCCPA
claims simply list several statutory provisions, but fail to plead facts showing how Ocwen
violated those provisions, Plaintiffs' one reference to declaratory and injunctive relief in the
opening paragraph of their first amended complaint is improper and insufficient to support the
relief requested. If plaintiffs are allowed to proceed, their improper jury trial demand should
