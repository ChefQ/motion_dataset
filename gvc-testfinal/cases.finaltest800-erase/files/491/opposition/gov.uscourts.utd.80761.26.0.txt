MEMORANDUM OPPOSING MOTION TO
SET ASIDE ORDER RESTRICTING EFILING ACCESS [Docket No. 25]

JESSE ANNE MAJORS,
Plaintiff,
v.
THOMAS JEFFERSON SCHOOL OF LAW,
et al,

Case No.: 2:11cv00558 CW

Defendants,

Plaintiff is pro se and has shown a penchant for filing documents which are legally and
factually unsupported and do nothing to further her claims but, instead, multiply these proceedings
unreasonably. She urges the court to facilitate this barrage of filings by allowing her access to Pacer
and to the court’s electronic filing system. The Magistrate Judge properly denied her request relying
on the long established rules of both Pacer and the electronic filing system.

Plaintiff brings this motion under Rule 60(b)(2) Fed. R. Civ. P., which provides for relief
where there is newly discovered evidence. Plaintiff fails to describe that newly discovered evidence
and has certainly not listed it in her Affidavit of Facts in Support of Motion. Plaintiff has, however,
completely ignored the statutory requirements for seeking relief from an order or ruling of a
magistrate judge.
The prior order was correct and well supported by the law and facts and should not be
vacated.
In Chambers v. NASCO, 501 U.S. 32 (1991), the court upheld a trial court’s award of
attorneys’ fees against a party who had repeatedly taken actions which were without merit and
which delayed the proceedings. These attorneys’ fees were awarded against the party individually.
The test for awarding attorneys fees is objective. Defendant moves the court for an award of
attorneys’ fees expended in association with this baseless motion.
DATED this 21st day of July, 2011.
