AFFIDAVIT OF FACTS IN SUPPORT OF MOTION

I, Jesse A. Majors, having been sworn and being under oath, hereby allege as

follows:

1.

I am the Plaintiff in this lawsuit.

An order was entered against me on July 11, 2011.

I am unwilling to fill out "Waiver/Electronic Case Noticing Registration Form".

I believe that I have a valid legal defense to this order. The elements of that

defense include:

a.

Defendants have an unfair advantage over Plaintiff by having the ability to
e-file documents while Plaintiff does not.

Defendants were willing to allow Plaintiff said access even though they
were aware the Rules of Civil Procedure did not allow non-attorneys
access.

Plaintiff was ordered to waive her right to have legal documents pertaining
to her case mailed to her via the US Postal Service. To waive this right, in
conjunction with denying her right to e-file, creates a larger, unfair
advantage over Plaintiff.

Plaintiff should not have to travel away from her home to print documents
relating to her case.

Plaintiff's right to access information pertaining to her case via Pacer has
been revoked, which has already created additional hardship on Plaintiff
as she has not been able to view current progress regarding her case.

Plaintiff has already established a "Pacer" account, which has since been
 

 

Case 2:11-cv-00558-CW -SA Document 25 Filed 07/19/11 Page 3 of 4

revoked for no apparent reason.
Therefore,
1. Plaintiff requests to receive all documents pertaining to her case sent to her via

US Postal Service and email.

2. Plaintiff requests access to the Pacer system be restored.

3. Plaintiff requests that Order requiring Plaintiff to fill out form that waives her
rights be

REVERSED.
