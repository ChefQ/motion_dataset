RESPONSE TO MOTION TO EXCLUDE DEFENSE EXPERT TESTIMONY
I.

Introduction
On August 30, 2009, Mr. Kernell’s counsel sent to the government an expert

notice that complies with Rule 16(b)(1)(C) in every respect. As called for by the Rule,
the notice set out Mr. Hampton’s “opinions, the bases and reasons for these opinions, and
the witnesses qualifications.” Rule 16(b)(1)(C). That is what the rule requires. The rule
does not require a detailed report.
Rather than asking defense counsel for clarification of any question regarding Mr.
Hampton’s testimony, the government’s counsel responded by filing a fifteen page
motion. [Doc. 81] The government additionally filed the notice as an attachment in this
case in which pretrial publicity is a well known issue for the parties. 1
The government filed this motion when it is still providing discovery long after the
discovery deadline. Mr. Kernell has not objected nor will he object as long as he is not
prejudiced; however, it is not reasonable for the government to take the position that an
1

The government in this district has previously taken the position that the defendant violates the
order on discovery and scheduling by failing to attempt to resolve issues of Rule 16 expert
notices informally prior to filing a motion. United States v. Campbell, No. 3:05-cr-23, doc. 102,
p. 2.

expert should be excluded for failing to disclose all of the bases of his testimony when
there are still items of electronic evidence being produced.
Despite the fact that the notice complies with the rule, defense counsel have sent
the government’s motion to Mr. Hampton and will meet with him during the coming
week. If there are ways to supplement the notice in response to some of the questions the
government appears to pose to the court, Mr. Kernell will voluntarily supplement the
disclosure.
II.

Rule 16 Only Requires Disclosure of Opinions, Bases and Reasons for Those
Opinions, and the Witness’s Qualifications.
The government does not cite Sixth Circuit cases that set out the standard

regarding the sufficiency of Rule 16 disclosures. The government cites United States v.
Foley, 2004 WL 2524262 (6th Cir. 2004), an unpublished opinion, in which the Sixth
Circuit found no abuse of discretion where the district court excluded expert testimony
when the notice was not filed in a timely manner. [Doc. 81 at 3 n. 1] The one-page
opinion contains no discussion of the requirements of the disclosure. Similarly, in the
other Sixth Circuit case cited by the government, United States v. Campbell, 2003 WL
22734836 (6th Cir. 2003), another unpublished case, the Sixth Circuit found no abuse of
discretion where the district court excluded testimony because of a “failure to disclose.”
The opinion seems to indicate that no notice was filed in that case.
Although not cited in the government’s motion, there is a Sixth Circuit case that
discusses the requirements of a Rule 16 expert notice and in that case points out two

deficiencies in the notice. United States v. White, 492 F.3d 380, 406 (6th Cir. 2007).2
The court first correctly noted that the requirements are “minimal.” Id. at 406.
The court set out that the purpose of Rule 16’s expert requirements is to avoid
surprise at trial:
In 1993, the drafters amended Rule 16 to require such disclosure “to
minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony ...
and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the
expert's testimony through focused cross-examination.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 16
advisory committee's note (1993). To that end, the summary contemplated
under Rule 16(a) “should inform the requesting party whether the expert
will be providing only background information on a particular issue or
whether the witness will actually offer an opinion.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 16
advisory committee's note (1993). “In some instances, a generic description
of the likely witness and that witness's qualifications may be sufficient, e.g.,
where a DEA laboratory chemist will testify, but it is not clear which
particular chemist will be available.” Id. The summary of the bases of the
expert's opinion must be provided even where the proffered experts
prepared no reports, and can include “any information that might be
recognized as a legitimate basis for an opinion under Federal Rule of
Evidence 703.” Id. Rule 16 further gives the district court discretion to
impose an appropriate remedy on the non-compliant party for violations of
the Rule, including an order to permit the discovery sought, a continuance,
an order precluding the party from introducing the challenged evidence, or
any other just relief. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2)(A)-(D).

White, 492 F.3d at 406. Thus, the court mentions that it is permissible for experts to set
out background information rather than opinion, negating one of the governments’s
repeated contentions that the notice is not drafted entirely in the form of opinions. (See,
for example, doc. 81 at 4, objecting to the use of topics rather than conclusions).
Additionally, Rule 702 allows testimony from witnesses with “specialized knowledge.”
2

The notice was deficient because it failed to set out the witnesses’ qualifications – no resume was attached – and
because it only described general subject matters regarding cost accounting but did not set out a summary of the
witnesses ultimate testimony. The problems with the disclosure were found to be harmless. White, 492 F.3d at 407.

The witness “may” testify in the form of an opinion, but it is likewise acceptable for an
expert to explain issues such as electronic data using specialized knowledge without
every statement having to be in an opinion.
More importantly, in this case, it is outside the realm of possibility that the
government could be surprised at trial by Mr. Hampton’s testimony, his qualifications or
the bases for his testimony. Significantly, the entire universe of evidence upon which
Mr. Hampton bases his testimony came from the government.

Mr. Hampton has

examined only the items produced in discovery by the government. Mr. Kernell does not
have any electronic evidence to examine. The entire universe is based on the allegations
made by the government and the evidence the government claims that it will use.
Interestingly, the government apparently intends to call multiple expert witnesses;
however, the government has not produced a Rule 16(a)(1)(G) notice and summary of its
experts.

Rather, the government has chosen to produce expert reports.

While the

government may prefer to proceed in this fashion, and Mr. Kernell has not objected, there
is no requirement that a party proceed by providing a report. Mr. Kernell has proceeded
by providing what the rule requires. Mr. Hampton’s methodology as a computer forensic
expert uses the same general framework as the government’s experts.
On the motions to suppress, the government has vigorously objected to an
evidentiary hearing regarding the bases and methodologies used by its experts. [Docs.
61:

Response to Motion for Evidentiary Hearing;

64: Motion to Quash]

The

government has claimed that Mr. Kernell was seeking discovery of matters to which he
was not entitled by asking for a hearing on the methods of forensic evaluation. The
4

government’s five voluminous expert reports disclose the conclusions of their experts but
do not disclose the exact methods and bases used by those experts, as they seem to
indicate should be done here. The government’s reports do not, for example, set out how
key word searches were performed, what search terms were used, etc.

There is no justification in this record for exclusion of evidence. United States v.
Ganier, 468 F.3d 920, 927 (6th Cir. 2006)(where there is a violation of a Rule 16 notice
requirement, courts must apply the least severe sanction appropriate). In Ganier, the
government had failed to file a Rule 16(a)(1)(G) disclosure of computer forensic tests
until the eve of trial. The government unsuccessfully argued on appeal that the tests did
not require expertise and thus notice, but the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court’s
order of dismissal. Even where there is a violation, the court is directed to impose the
least severe sanction. That sanction here would be to determine whether there was any
deficiency and to order a revised disclosure.
As to the objection regarding relevance, the government’s objection to relevance
of any portion of Mr. Hampton’s testimony can be decided at trial by the district court.
None of the government’s objections is supported by citation to authority, and none
requires decision pretrial.
Finally, the government’s contention that Mr. Hampton’s testimony somehow
violates Rule 704(b) is utterly without foundation. Rule 704(b) governs expert witnesses
testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant. No case law is
cited in the government’s motion because there is none on point. The proposed
5

testimony in no way violates 704(b).

See United States v. Frost, 125 F.3d 346, 383-84

(6thCir.1997)( testimony that bonuses were not billed in a deceptive manner and that
businesses regularly bill in ways they believe are correct but violate regulations not
barred) (citing United States v. Lipscomb, 14 F.3d 1236, 1239 (7th Cir.1994)) (where the
expert provides testimony in general terms regarding the conduct, the witness does not
provide an opinion on an ultimate issue.)
III.

Conclusion
The expert notice satisfies the requirements of the rule. Nevertheless, the

defendant is willing to supplement it voluntarily to a reasonable extent. The
government’s motion is unnecessary and not supported by Rule 16 and should be denied.
