Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
COMPEL DEPOSITIONS

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby responds
as follows to those portions of defendants’ motion to compel depositions (defendants’ motion)

-2that merit a response:
With respect to the subpoena naming IRS Revenue Officer Mike Walsh, because that
subpoena was not served in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 45, compliance with the subpoena
should not be compelled. Mr. Walsh is not a party to this action. Thus, his attendance at a
deposition is properly secured through service of a subpoena. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(1).
Service of a subpoena is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(b), which states in pertinent part,
(1) A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not
less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein
shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and, if the person’s
attendance is commanded, by tendering to that person the fees for one day’s
attendance and the mileage allowed by law.
According to the copy of the subpoena attached to defendants’ motion, the subpoena was served
via registered mail. Additionally, defendants make no allegation and provide no evidence as to
whether they tendered witness fees in connection with their attempted service of the subpoena.
Rule 45(b) requires personal service of subpoenas. 9A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2454 (2d ed. 2007); e.g., Federal Trade Commission
v. Compagnie de Saint-Gobain-Pont-A-Mousson, 636 F.2d 1300, 1312-13 (D.C.Cir.1980), San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. v. Spencer, 2006 WL 2734284 (N.D. Calif. 2006),
Seafirst Corp. v. Boyd, 1985 WL 188558 (W.D. Wash. 1985), Gillam v. A. Shyman, Inc., 22
F.R.D. 475, 479 (D. Alaska 1958). The Rule also requires simultaneous tendering of witness
fees and mileage. CF&I Steel Corp. v. Mitsui &Co., Inc., 713 F.2d 494, 496 (9th Cir. 1983).
Because defendants have failed to allege or establish compliance with the requirements of Rule
45(b), Mr. Walsh’s appearance plainly should not be compelled.

-3With respect to the subpoena issued to the United States of America, that subpoena
presents additional difficulties. It appears that a subpoena is not necessary, since the United
States is a party to this action. Thus, it is conceivable that the United States’ deposition–
assuming such a deposition can be taken–would require simply a notice of deposition served
upon counsel for the United States. Defendants have served such a notice, along with the
subpoena, and a copy of the notice is attached to defendants’ motion. However, because the
notice of deposition fails to identify the individual to which it is addressed, or to comply with the
requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) as discussed below, compliance with the notice should
not be compelled.
It is unclear from either the subpoena or the notice of deposition from whom the
defendants seek testimony on behalf of the United States, as no individual is named in either
document. In the event that the Court is inclined to view the notice of deposition as one intended
to be issued pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), that rule does not, by its terms, apply to the
United States of America and, even if it did, defendants have not otherwise complied with the
requirements of that rule. Rule 30(b)(6) provides in pertinent part:
A party may in the party’s notice and in a subpoena name as the deponent
a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental
agency and describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which
examination is requested. In that event, the organization so named shall designate
one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent
to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the matters
on which the person will testify.
The Rule thus allows the deposition of governmental agencies, such as the IRS, but not of
the United States government itself. The difficulty in naming the United States as a witness in a

2565774.1

-4notice of deposition under Rule 30(b)(6) is the inability for counsel for the United States to know
to whom the notice is meant to be directed. Further, defendants did not describe with any
particularity the matters on which examination was requested, as required by the Rule, although
an attachment to the subpoena did list documents to be produced. Thus, even if the United
States could be required to designate individuals to testify on its behalf under Rule 30(b)(6),
such designation should not be compelled where defendants do not identify the matters on which
examination is requested.
With respect to the depositions being set outside of the time period allowed for discovery
in this matter, as set forth in the United States’ Response to Minute Order from Chambers to
Certify Case Ready for Trial, Dkt. # 114, discovery closed on June 9, 2007. Dkt. # 114, p. 2.
This was as a result of the United States’ request for an extension of the discovery deadline in its
motion to compel, Dkt. # 95. The subpoenas directed to Mr. Walsh and to the United States
attempted to set the depositions on June 12, 2007. Attendance at a deposition outside of the
discovery period should not be compelled. Additionally, contrary to defendants’ statement in
their motion, the United States did not seek a second extension of the discovery deadline in its
motion for discovery sanctions, Dkt. # 112. The only extension sought in that motion was the
deadline for the filing of discovery motions, dispositive motions, and motions in limine. Dkt. #
112, p. 10. Thus, the discovery period closed on June 9, 2007, and defendants have failed to set
forth any grounds for further extension of that period.
