STEPHEN KIMBLE, an individual, and

Case No. CIV 08-372-TUC-DCB (DTF)

Plaintiffs,

v.

17

MARVEL ENTERPRISES, INC.,

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS
IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT

Defendant.

18
19

1.

20

Stephen Kimble is the inventor of a web shooting toy described in part in

21

US Patent No. 5,072,856 (referred to herein as the “Kimble patent”). (See Doc. No. 49-2

22

¶ 1).

23
24
25
26

2.

The Kimble patent expires no later than May 25, 2010. (See Doc. No. 44 ¶

1 (admitting ¶ 31 of Doc. No. 33)).
3.

In 1997 Kimble filed suit against Toy Biz, Inc. (“Toy Biz”), now known as

Marvel Entertainment, Inc. (“Marvel”), in the United States District Court for the District

27

of Arizona (the “Action”) claiming that Marvel had infringed the Kimble patent and had
28
-1-

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 55 Filed 07/15/09 Page 2 of 8

1

breached a verbal agreement to negotiate a reasonable royalty arising out of Marvel’s use

2

of a toy called the Web Blaster (the “Verbal Agreement”). (See Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 2).

3

4.

The Web Blaster is a role play toy whose primary play value is to allow the

4

user to adopt aspects of Marvel’s Spider-Man character by shooting foam string. (Exh. 1,

5

Kimble Dep. Tr. 45:9-14). 1

6

5.

The District Court ruled as a matter of law that the Web Blaster did not

7
infringe the Kimble patent, but that the claims concerning the Verbal Agreement involved
8
9

disputed issues of fact for the jury to decide. (See Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 5).
6.

10

In October 2000, the issues regarding the Verbal Agreement were tried

11

before a jury that returned a verdict in favor of Kimble. The jury found that the Web

12

Blaster manufactured by Marvel was covered by the Verbal Agreement and awarded

13

Kimble damages in the form of a royalty of “3.5% of net product sales, past, present, and

14

future.” (See Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 6).

15

7.

Both parties appealed the judgment, and while the appeal was pending, the

16

matter was settled pursuant to a September 21, 2001 Agreement (the “Agreement”). The

17

Agreement gave Marvel rights in the Kimble patent as well as the non-infringing toy that

18

was litigated. (See Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 7).

19

8.

Paragraph 3 of the Agreement provides:

20
Marvel agrees to purchase from the Patent
Holders and the Patent Holders agree to sell to Marvel
the Patent which will be evidenced by an instrument of
assignment in the form of exhibit C hereto. The
purchase price for the Patent shall be payable to the
Patent Holder as follows:

21
22
23
24

a. $516,214.62 upon execution and delivery of
this Agreement; and

25

b. 3% of “net product sales” (as such term is
used in the Judgment) excluding refill royalties made
after December 31, 2000. For purposes of this

“Exh. __” references are to exhibits attached to the accompanying declaration of Jason
T. Christiansen dated July 15, 2009.

paragraph 3.b, “net product sales” shall be deemed to
include product sales that would infringe the Patent but
for the purchase and sale thereof pursuant to this
Agreement as well as sales of the Web Blaster product
that was the subject of the Action and to which the
Judgment refers.

The Agreement has no expiration date. (Exh. 2; see also Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 9).

10.

Paragraph 12 of the Agreement provides:
This Agreement contains the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes
all
prior
and
contemporaneous
arrangements or understandings with respect thereto.

Paragraph 14 of the Agreement provides:
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed therein.

(Exh. 2 ¶ 14; see also Doc. No. 47-2 ¶ 6).
16

In any action brought to enforce this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

Paragraph 17 of the Agreement provides:

(Exh. 2 ¶ 17; see also Doc. No. 47-2 ¶ 7).
13.

Plaintiffs disagreed with some of the royalty payments made by Marvel to

Kimble and “exercised their right to audit Marvel” in the fourth quarter of 2007. (See
Doc. No. 23 ¶¶ 23-30).
14.

Plaintiffs sued Marvel on May 28, 2008 in Pima County Superior Court,

25

27
28

Case No. C20083621 regarding their objections to Marvel’s royalty payments.
15.

Marvel removed the action from the Pima County Superior Court to the

District Court for the District of Arizona on June 27, 2008 (Doc. No. 1) and thereafter

filed an answer and counterclaims.
16.

Plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint with this Court on November 18,

2008. (See Doc. No. 23).
17.

In response, Marvel filed a motion to dismiss three counts in plaintiffs’ first

amended complaint and plaintiffs subsequently agreed to dismiss those counts without
filing a response to Marvel’s motion. (See Doc. Nos. 25 and 29).

7
18.

Marvel filed its answer to the first amended complaint and amended

8
9
10

counterclaims on January 26, 2009. (See Doc. No. 33). Marvel’s first counterclaim seeks,
among other things, “a judicial determination of its rights and duties, and a declaration

11

that (a) it is no longer required to pay plaintiffs ‘3% of “net product sales”’ under the

12

Agreement based on sales of products after the expiration of the ’856 patent….” (See

13

Doc. No. 33 ¶ 45). Marvel’s first counterclaim also seeks an award of attorney fees

14

pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Agreement and/or pursuant to A.R.S. 12-341.01(A). (See

15

Doc. No. 33 ¶¶ 46-47).

19.

On August 28, 2001, Robert Grabb sent an email to Marvel’s co-counsel

David Fleischer stating:

20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

Our concept of a final deal between Kimble and Toy
Biz [Marvel’s predecessor] is that Toy Biz will buy the
Kimble patent for approximately $531,000 and will pay
a royalty of 3% of sales on toys it sells in the future that
are based on the patent or the disclosures Kimble made
to Toy Biz over 10 years ago (no need to rehash what
the disclosures were as they are contained in the
transcript of the trial).
Our reasoning (and we had asked Claudia to address
this issue at the mediation) is as follows: (Assuming
the Judgment is upheld on appeal.) If Toy Biz were to
make a new toy, different from the Web Blaster, but
covered by either the patent or the disclosures made to
Toy Biz by Kimble, then Kimble would no doubt have
a new claim against Toy Biz.
-4-

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 55 Filed 07/15/09 Page 5 of 8

1
In fact, it has always been our belief that the better
version of the toy is the one that has the canister
attached somewhere around the waist area with a
pressurized tube running along the arm. Should Toy
Biz elect to make this toy based upon the patent or
disclosures, we would be entitled to a 3% royalty.

(Exh. 3, August 28, 2001 email from Robert Grabb to David Fleischer).
20.

7

On January 9, 2008 co-plaintiff Robert Grabb sent an email to Ken West,

8

Marvel’s Chief Financial Officer, expressing concern regarding payments for a version of

9

the Web Blaster toy called the “Ultimate Web Blaster.” In stating his opinion that

10

plaintiffs did not receive the full amount due from Hasbro’s sales of this particular toy,

11

Mr. Grabb stated that “[c]learly the Ultimate Web Blaster, along with other Web Blaster

12
13

products currently on the market would infringe the Patent.” (Exh. 4, January 9, 2008
email from Robert Grabb to Ken West).

14
21.

In a February 7, 2008 email, plaintiffs maintained that they are entitled to

15
16
17

receive payments “for as long as there is a Web Blaster toy, and assuming there will be
such a toy on the market for many many years to come.” (Exh. 5, February 7, 2008 email

18

from Robert Grabb to Ken West; see Doc. No. 44 ¶ 1 (admitting ¶¶ 32-33 of Doc. No.

19

33)).

20

22.

Stephen Kimble testified that it is his belief as of April 24, 2009 that

21

Marvel’s Web Blaster products did not infringe the Kimble patent because “that was the

22

only ruling we’ve ever gotten was that it did not.” (Exh. 1, Kimble Dep. Tr. 68:24-69:2).

23
24
25
26

23.

Stephen Kimble further testified regarding paragraph 3 of the Agreement

that “whether it infringes the patent or whether it is a version of the toy that was litigated,
to me, it’s you know, it is an irrelevant issue…” (Exh. 1, Kimble Dep. Tr. 72:5-7).
24.

Plaintiffs, in their July 1, 2009 motion for summary judgment papers, now

27
assert that “[n]one of the payments made to Kimble were for toys that infringed the
28
-5-

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 55 Filed 07/15/09 Page 6 of 8

1
2

Kimble Patent.” (See Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 11).
25.

Plaintiffs, in their July 1, 2009 motion for summary judgment papers, now

3

contend that “[e]very payment ever made by Marvel since the inception of the Agreement

4

was for products that do not infringe the Kimble Patent, but were the subject of the first

5
6

Action.” (See Doc. No. 49-2 ¶ 10).
26.

Marvel has stated that it does not believe that any products Marvel sold

7
infringe the Kimble patent based on the fact that Judge Collins made such a ruling in the
8
9
10
11
12

prior lawsuit. (See Doc. No. 49-9 at p. 5). Marvel has also stated that it “paid royalties
pursuant to paragraph 3(b) of the September 21, 2001 Settlement Agreement” without
further distinction. (See Doc. No. 49-8 at p. 5).
27.

Marvel’s Chief Financial Officer, Ken West, testified that his

13

“understanding is that we [Marvel] have an obligation of 3 percent of some value

14

associated with a Silly String Shooting element that allows a child or a buyer of the

15

product to role play as though they’re Spiderman.” (Exh. 6, West Dep. Tr. 11:22-12:8).

16
17
18
19

28.

Marvel never made a differentiation in its royalty reports for payments for

toys that Marvel believed “would infringe the Patent but for the purchase and sale thereof
pursuant to this Agreement” and payments for “sales of the Web Blaster product that was
the subject of the Action and to which the Judgment refers.” (See Doc. No. 48-6 as an

20
exemplary royalty report demonstrating no distinction for any payments).
