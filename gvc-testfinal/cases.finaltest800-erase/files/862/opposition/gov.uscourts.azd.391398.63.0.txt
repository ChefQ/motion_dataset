Case No. CIV 08-372-TUC-DCB (DTF)
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

As a preliminary matter, it should be noted that Defendant Marvel has cited the

17

cases of Rule v Brine, Inc., 85 F.3d 1002 (2d Cir. 1996), Bettis Rubber Co. v. Kleaver,

18

233 P.2d 82 (2d Dist. 1951), Pipkin v FMC Corp., 427 F.2d 353 (5th Cir. 1970), and

19

Aronson v Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257 (1979) for propositions that, according

20

to Marvel’s own description, are not applicable to the facts of the present case before

21

the Court. Therefore, inasmuch as it appears that the parties agree that these cases

22
23

are not relevant to the issues of this motion, the Plaintiffs have not addressed them in
this response.

24

Like Plaintiffs, Defendant Marvel has filed its own Motion for Summary Judgment
25

on the issue of whether the Settlement Agreement between the parties (the

1

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 2 of 9

1
2

“Agreement”) provides for payment of royalties past the expiration date of the Kimble
Patent (U.S. No. 5,072,856). However, throughout its motion, Defendant attempts to

3

raise an issue of fact regarding whether the products in question actually infringe the

4

‘856 Patent. This is not at issue. Marvel has admitted that they do not (Exhibit 7 to

5

Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts in support of their July 1, 2009, Motion for Summary

6

Judgment) and Plaintiffs agree.

7

Given this admission and the fact that Defendant has filed its own Motion for

8

Summary Judgment, for purposes of this Motion, the question now before the Court is

9
10

a pure issue of law to be decided on summary judgment. Accordingly, these factual
allegations are also not addressed in this response.

11

Throughout its Motion, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs never made a
12

distinction between patent rights and non-patent rights. This is incorrect because the
13
14
15

contract provision repeatedly cited by both parties clearly distinguishes between
patent and non-patent rights. The contract recites “product sales that would infringe

16

the patent ... as well as sales of the Web Blaster product that ... .” One wonders what

17

significance the Defendant attributes to the “as well as” language if the contract

18

intended to cover only products that infringe. Defendant’s position on this issue is

19

untenable and patently inconsistent with the explicit language of the Agreement.

20
21
22

Citing Brulotte v. Thys, 379 U.S. 29 (1964), Defendant argues that “[t]he
Agreement, which purports to require Marvel to pay royalties for the use of the patent
and non-patent rights after the Kimble Patent expires, is unenforceable as a matter of

23

federal patent law.” In Brulotte the Supreme Court held that the licensing agreements
24

at issue were unenforceable because the “licensor was using the licenses to project its
25

2

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 3 of 9

1
2

monopoly beyond the patent period.”

379 U.S. at 32. However, no such thing is

happening in this case.

3

The Agreement, contrary to Marvel’s framing of the argument, does not purport

4

to require Marvel to pay royalties for the use of patent rights after the Kimble Patent

5

expires.

6

products that would infringe the patent.

7

payment of royalties for products that do not infringe the patent. Therefore, the only

8

issue now before the Court is whether the provision of the Agreement that provides for

9
10

Plaintiffs are not claiming to be entitled to post-expiration royalties for
They are only claiming to be entitled to

payment for non-patented toys after the expiration of the patent violates patent law so
as to render that provision unenforceable under Brulotte.

11

The Brulotte decision was thoroughly discussed by the Ninth Circuit in Zila v.
12

Tinnell, 502 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir. 2007). The analysis of Zila makes crystal clear that
13
14
15
16
17
18

Brulotte only applies to attempts to extend the payment of royalties for patented
products beyond the expiration of a patent. Therefore, it does not apply to the issue
now before the Court. The court in Zila concluded,
Simply put, Brulotte indicates that under some circumstances patent owners
cannot exact royalties for use of patented devices beyond the duration of their
patents. (Emphasis added.)
Zila, supra, at 1019.

19
20
21
22
23
24

The pertinent part of the Agreement between the parties to this dispute
provides in Paragraph 3 that Plaintiffs are entitled to royalties for the following:
1) the Web Blaster product that was the subject of the action (which was found
by judgment and now admitted by Defendant not to infringe the patent); and
2) products that would infringe the Patent but for the purchase and sale thereof.

25

3

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 4 of 9

1
2
3

Therefore, continued payment of post-patent-expiration royalties for products
falling under the first portion of the provision (products that do not infringe) is entirely
consistent with the rule of Brulotte.

4

Marvel’s contractual obligation after the expiration of the Kimble patent is

5

reduced to paying royalties only for the Web Blaster product that was the subject of

6

the original action between the parties (a non-infringing toy).

7

accordance with the Zila language quoted above, the payment of royalties for non-

8

infringing toys beyond the duration of the Kimble Patent is not contrary to the Brulotte

9
10

Therefore, in full

rule and is fully sanctioned by the Zila court.
Defendant has attempted to advance its argument by claiming that “[t]he

11

Agreement between Marvel and plaintiffs is a ‘hybrid’ agreement requiring a definitive
12

time limit linked to the life of the Kimble patent.” Such “hybrid” agreements are ones
13
14
15

that deal with both patent rights and non-patent rights, such as trade secrets and
trademarks.

Defendant implies that because the Agreement at issue is a hybrid

16

agreement and the agreements at issue in Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, 701 F.2d

17

1365 (11th Cir. 1983), were hybrid agreements, this Court must rule that the

18

Agreement is unenforceable as the court ruled in Pitney Bowes, Inc., supra.

19

particular, at pages 12-13 of its Motion, Defendant states:

20
21
22
23
24

Several of the long line of cases from Brulotte to Zila specifically dealt
with what the cases refer to as “hybrid” agreements that license both
patent rights and non-patent rights at a constant royalty rate and fail
to distinguish between the two sets of rights – as is the case of
the Agreement between Marvel and plaintiffs. For example, in
Pitney Bowes,Inc. v. Mestre, the Eleventh Circuit held that a “hybrid”
agreement licensing both patents and trade secrets was
unenforceable after the patent’s expiration. 701 F.2d at 1373.
(Emphasis added.)

25

4

In

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 5 of 9

1
2

However, the Agreement between Plaintiffs and Defendant does not provide for
payment of a single royalty covering both patent rights and trade-secret rights

3

incorporated into the same product, as in Pitney Bowes. The Agreement in issue here

4

contemplates royalties for two distinct types of toys. The first is a toy that infringes

5

and the second is a toy that does not but was the subject of the earlier litigation. The

6

same royalty rate (not the same royalty) of 3% applies, but the products are clearly

7

different and separable. For Defendant to say that the Settlement Agreement fails to

8

distinguish between the two sets of rights is simply incorrect. It seems as though

9
10

Defendant would agree that a royalty of 2.9% for infringing products and 3.1% for noninfringing products would be allowed, but a royalty of 3% for both is not, a position that

11

is untenable on its face.
12

The agreements for the sale of both trade secrets and patents in Pitney Bowes
13
14
15

that were ruled to be unenforceable called for royalty payments for patent and nonpatent rights that were both embodied in the machines that infringed the patent. As

16

such, had the payments continued beyond the patent-expiration date, they would

17

indeed have extended the monopoly beyond the patent term, in violation of Brulotte.

18

This was made clear by the Pitney Bowes court when it noted:

19
20
21
22
23
24

As in Brulotte, two provisions in the agreement suggest that the
patentee used the leverage of his patent to project its monopoly
beyond the 17-year patent period. First, the "exclusive rights" granted
under the agreement applied equally before and after expiration of the
patent. Like the assignment and removal restrictions on the hoppicking machines in Brulotte, the grant of exclusive rights is "pertinent
to protection of the patent monopoly," but its "applicability to the postexpiration period is a telltale sign that the licensor was using the
license to project its monopoly beyond the patent period." 379
U.S. at 32, 85 S.Ct. at 179.
Pitney Bowes, supra, at 1373. (Emphasis added.)

25

5

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 6 of 9

2

These are not the facts of the instant case, where Defendant is required to
make payments only for non-infringing products beyond the term of the Kimble patent.

3

The Zila court cited Meehan v. PPG Industries, Inc., 802 F.2d 881 (7th Cir.

4

1986), which also dealt with a hybrid agreement similar to the agreement in Pitney

5

Bowes.

6

products that had infringed the patent. Citing Brulotte, the Meehan court stated:

7

Royalties were again paid for both patent and non-patent rights only for

10

Without evidence that the post-expiration royalties were not tied
to the patent, the Court assumed that they were. “In light of those
considerations, we conclude that a patentee's use of a royalty
agreement that projects beyond the expiration date of the patent is
unlawful per se.” Id.
Meehan, supra, at 883-884. (Emphasis added.)

11

Again, the Agreement before this Court differs in the same material way from

12

the agreement decided in the Meehan case. It does not provide for continuation of

13

patent-right protection beyond the term of the patent and the post-expiration royalties

14

are not tied to the patent. Upon expiration, Defendant will be required to pay royalties

8
9

15
16

only on a non-infringing toy.
Without regard to the express language of the Settlement Agreement discussed

17

above, Marvel claims that the patent and non-patent rights are inseparable. This is
18

just plainly inaccurate and runs against Defendant’s own charge, at page seven of its
19
20
21

Motion, that “[t]he Court must construe a contract based on the written language if the
terms of such contract are unambiguous. Welles v. Turner Entm’t Co., 503 F.3d 728,

22

735 (9th Cir. 2007) (relying on New York law and citing Nichols v.Nichols, 306 N.Y.

23

490, 492, 119 N.E.2d 351, 353 (1954)).”

24

Case law is replete with instances where the court refused to find that patent

25

and non-patent rights were indistinguishable where a distinction could be made. For

6

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 7 of 9

instance, in Baladevon, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 871 F. Supp. 89, (Mass.
1994), the court wrestled with a hybrid agreement where the plaintiff sought to enforce

3

patent, trademark and other non-patent rights in a device that had yet to be patented.

The court noted:

17

Four Circuits have struggled with the question of the enforceability of
"hybrid royalty agreements" — agreements, such as the one before
the court, that exchange royalties for a mix of patent and non-patent
rights — after Lear,Brulotte and QuickPoint. A consensus has
emerged. Where a licensing agreement fails to distinguish
between patent and non-patent rights in royalty payments, and a
patent is invalidated, Lear precludes enforcement of the contract
according to its terms but does not preclude compensation for the
non-patent rights.
Baladevon, supra, at 94. (Emphasis added.)
At page 96, the court continued,
There is a second, even more significant, distinction between this
case and the line of cases extending Lear to the context of hybrid
royalty agreements. In each of those cases, the court was compelled
to invalidate the whole agreement, because it was impossible to
disentangle the consideration given for the invalid patent from
the consideration given for non-patent rights. Each court
recognized, however, that the plaintiff was still entitled, on the
theory of unjust enrichment, to that portion of the consideration
(if any) that was designed to compensate it for non-patent
rights. See Chromalloy, 716 F.2d at 685; Span-Deck, 677 F.2d at
1247; St. Regis, 552 F.2d at 315. (Emphasis added.)

18

In the instant case, the Settlement Agreement sets out explicitly the
19
20
21

consideration for non-patent rights. It is the consideration to be paid for the noninfringing products that were the subject of the earlier action between the parties.

22

Separate from the 3% royalty due for infringing products, the Agreement provides that

23

Defendant pay a 3% royalty for sales of these non-infringing toys. The royalty for

24

infringing products ends when the Kimble patent expires.

25

infringing products that were the subject of the earlier action between the parties

7

The royalty for non-

Case 4:08-cv-00372-DCB Document 63 Filed 08/17/09 Page 8 of 9

continues. As the court noted in Portney v. Ciba Vision Corporation, (Case number
SACV 07-0854 AG (MLGx) C.D.Cal. 6-17-2008), “a device cannot simultaneously be
"covered" and "not covered" by Patent Rights.” Id., at 6.

4

Conclusion

5
6

The Agreement at issue does not contemplate royalty payments for patented

7

devices past the Kimble Patent’s expiration date. That obligation to pay ends when

8

the Kimble patent expires.

9
10

Marvel’s obligation to pay continues past the patent

expiration date for those toys that were the subject of the earlier action. Accordingly,
in accordance with the holdings of Zila and Brulotte, Plaintiffs respectfully request that

11

the Court deny Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.
