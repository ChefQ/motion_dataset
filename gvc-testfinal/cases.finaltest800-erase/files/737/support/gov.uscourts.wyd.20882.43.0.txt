MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

 

Comes now, Defendant, Diversified Transfer and Storage, Inc. (hereinafter
"DTS"), and respectfully moves the Court to reconsider its August 16, 2010
Decision denying DTS' Motion to Dismiss on the basis:

1 Under Georgia Law Indemnity Provisions are Narrowly
Construed with Every Presumption Against the Drafter/ Indemnitee,
Whereas Insurance Contracts are Broadly Construed with Every
Presumption in Favor of the Insured and Coverage

Georgia courts distinguish between ordinary, commercial contracts that
include an indemnification provision and liability insurance policies. For
example, in Allstate Insurance Co. v City of Atlanta, 415 S.E.2d 308, 202 Ga.App.
692 (GA App. 1992) the court stated:

"Moreover, the context in which this document was executed, and the

document itself, are significant. This is not a situation of "an insurance
company whose business it is to furnish indemnity for a premium and

 

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 43 Filed 08/26/10 Page 2 of 9

where indemnity is the principal purpose of the contract ...". Bohannon v.
Sou. R. Co., 97 Ga.App. 849, 850(1), 104 S.E.2d 603 (1958)." Supr. 310.

Though not controlling, the 5" Circuit's Decision in Meloy v. Conoco, Inc., 817

 

F.2d 275 om Cir. (LA) 1987) is illustrative of the distinction between

transportation and other commercial contracts with an indemnity provision and an

insurance liability contract.

"An indemnity agreement is a specialized form of contract which is
distinguishable from a liability insurance policy. A cause of action under a
liability insurance policy accrues when the liability attaches. Appleman,
Insurance Law and Practice (Buckley ed.) Sec. 4261. However, an insurer's
duty to defend arises whenever the pleadings against the insured disclose a
possibility of liability under the policy. American Home Assurance Co. v.
Czarniecki, supra; Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (Berdal ed.) Sec.
4683.01. On the other hand, an indemnity agreement does not render the
indemnitor liable until the indemnitee actually makes payment or sustains
loss. BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 692-93 (Sth ed. 1979); Appleman,
Insurance Law and Practice (Buckley ed.) Secs. 4261, 6668." Supra, 279-

80.

II. Under Georgia Law an Indemnitor's Obligations is
Determined Solely by the Allegations in the Complaint, Whereas an
Insurer has a Duty to Investigate the True Facts and Defend Where

There is a Possibility of Coverage.

The table is provided to illustrate how Georgia courts distinguish between

and construe contractual indemnity provisions as opposed to coverage under

policies of insurance.

As set forth in cases above, contractual indemnification is a matter of law,
decided solely on the allegations in the complaint and every presumption is made
against indemnification or defense. DTS has found absolutely no case law
imposing a duty on a contractual indemnitor to investigate or ascertain the "true
facts" in regard to defense of indemnitee's alleged negligence. Only in construing
insurance policies do the courts find a duty to investigate the "true facts". These
different approaches to contractual indemnity and insurance are consistent with the
public policy that strongly disfavors indemnity and narrowly construes such
agreements, whereas an insurer has broad duty to defend, and all doubt must

resolved toward coverage. Both Georgia and Wyoming have expressed a strong

public policy against indemnity in transportation contracts', and there is no

catrier transportation contract or related access agreement under which the motor
carrier transporter enters on property for the purpose of loading, unloading or
transporting property, to the extent that the contract purports to indemnify, defend
or holding harmless or has the effect of indemnifying, defending or holding
harmless the indemnitee from or against any liability for loss or damage resulting

articulated basis in Georgia law to extend an insurer's duty to investigate to a
motor carrier contractual indemnitor
Ill. Asan "Additional Insured" on the Certificate issued by Wiltshire
Insurance Co.'s Apparent Agent, Georgia-Pacific Is Entitled to
Defense From Defendant, Wiltshire, But Not From DTS.

DTS is entitled to have the claims against it dismissed, but the same is not
true of G-P's complaint against Wiltshire. As set forth in Ryder Integrated
Logistics, Inc. v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 627 S.E.2d 358 (2006),
even though Ryder as contractual indemnitor had no duty to defend BellSouth
based on the allegations of BellSouth's sole negligence in the complaint, Ryder's
insurer did. "Jn sum, we conclude that Republic has a duty to defend and
indemnify BellSouth to the extent of its coverage under the CGL policy..." 365.
This distinction between a contractual indemnitor's and insurer's duty of defense
was upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court in Ryder Integrated Logistics Inc. v.
BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 642 S.E.2d 696, 697 (Ga. 2007), though it
reversed the Appeals Court's holding that Ryder would be liable for any amounts
above the $1,000,000 CGL policy amount, as it had no defense or indemnification
obligations in the first place.

As an insurer however, Wiltshire does have a duty to investigate the true
facts, and provide a defense if there is the possibility of coverage. Likewise,

where Wiltshire's agent, Talbot Insurance, had apparent authority to issue

 

from its own negligence or intentional acts or omissions is against the public
policy of this state and is void and unenforceable.

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 43 Filed 08/26/10 Page 6 of 9

Certificates of Insurance, and did issue a certificate showing G-P as an "additional
insured", Wiltshire may be estopped from asserting that G-P was never added to
the policy.

In Mountain Fuel Supply v. Reliance Ins. Co., 933 F.2d 882, 889 (10th
Cir.1981), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that where there is an
affirmative manifestation of intent to incorporate the certificate of insurance
(adding an insured) into an insurer's policy, the third party becomes a
named insured by virtue of the certificate even though the certificate

contains a disclaimer. Sumitomo Marine & Fire Ins. v. Southern Guaranty
Ins. 337 F.Supp.2d 1339, 1355, (N.D. GA 2004)

Accordingly, in this case, Hayes, defendants' authorized agent, by issuing
the Certificate of Insurance and naming SMG as an additional insured,
manifested the intent to incorporate the Certificates of Insurance into
defendants' policies.!0x00B0 Thus, SMG was made an additional insured under
defendants' policies with coverage to the extent of the policies as they
existed at that time. Accord Dumenric v. Union Oil Co. of California, 238
Ill.App.3d 208, 179 Ill.Dec. 398, 606 N.E.2d 230 (1st Dist.1992) (holding
that the principal, having created the authority, is estopped to deny it to the
detriment of a third party); see also Strain Poultry Farms, Inc. v. American
Southern Ins. Co., 128 Ga.App. 600, 600, 197 S.E.2d 498 (1973) (holding
that "the insurer ... is estopped by its pleadings... and its certificate of
insurance to contend that [additional insured] isnot a named insured, or not
insured, under the policy, as against the insurer's contention that the
certificate of insurance was not binding because it was not attached to the
policy as an endorsement thereon.") Sumitomo Marine & Fire Ins. v.
Southern Guaranty Ins. 337 F.Supp.2d 1339, 1355, (N.D. GA 2004)

Moreover, other jurisdictions that have considered additional insured
endorsements containing phrases similar to "arising out of your operations"
have determined that the additional insured was entitled to coverage for its
own negligence. Thus, in Marathon Ashland Pipe Line v. Maryland Cas.
Co.,'' the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that the
additional insured endorsement, which covered "liability arising out of your
ongoing operations performed for that insured," provided coverage for the
additional insured's liability arising out of its own negligence.'(R) In Mid-
Continent Cas. Co. v. Swift Energy Co.,'" the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the insurance company's argument that identical policy language
limited the endorsement's coverage to liability resulting from named
insured's negligence and excluded liability arising out of the negligence of

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 43 Filed 08/26/10 Page 7 of 9

the additional insured."" Reaching a similar conclusion in Acceptance Ins.
Co. v. Syufy Enterprises,"' the California Court of Appeals concluded that
"It]he fact that the defect [that caused the injury] was attributable to [the
additional insured's] negligence is irrelevant, since the policy language does
not purport to allocate coverage according to fault.""* We find this
reasoning sound. Therefore, where as here, the insurer grants coverage for
liability "arising out of" the named insured's work, the additional insured is
covered without regard to whether the injury was attributable to the named
insured or the additional insured. Ryder Integrated Logistics, Inc. v.
BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 627 S.E.2d 358, 363-4 (2006

On information and belief, the Talbot Agency routinely issued Certificates
of Insurance for Wiltshire designating "additional insureds", no additional
premiums were charged, and Talbot did not need prior approval from Wiltshire. If
G-P demonstrates these facts, it would be entitled to defense and indemnification
from Wiltshire, potentially even for its own negligence. However, that is between

G-P and Wiltshire, and does not impact DTS' claim for dismissal.

IV. Conclusion

DTS is a motor carrier that entered into a transportation contract with G-P.
The contract with G-P provided for indemnification and required DTS to provide
and maintain certain insurance, which it did. The contract between DTS and G-P
does not require DTS to indemnify, defend or hold G-P harmless "to the extent
that the action giving rise to the claims was caused by any act or omission of
G-P". The contract does not state any duty to investigate or insure G-P for its
own negligence, nor did DTS assume the duties of an insurer.

Georgia law controls as to interpretation of the contract, and Georgia law

distinguishes and narrowly construes contractual indemnification provisions as

 
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 43 Filed 08/26/10 Page 8 of 9

against public policy, whereas insurance policies are broadly construed in favor of
the insured, also for public policy reasons. In determining a contractual
indemnitor's duty, the court looks solely to the allegations in the complaint,
whereas an insurer has the duty to investigate and provide defense if there is the
possibility of coverage. But a motor carrier is not an insurer, the contract between
DTS and G-P is not an insurance contract, and the Court should not unilaterally
extend an insurer's duty to a motor carrier, particularly where the statutes and
public policy of both Georgia and Wyoming specifically disfavor such an
extension.

For these reasons, Defendant, Diversified Transfer & Storage, Inc.
respectfully requests the Court to reconsider its August 16, 2010 decision, and
grant DTS' Motion to Dismiss.
