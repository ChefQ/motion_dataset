GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO AMEND/CORRECT THE COURT’S OPINION
The Government hereby submits this motion to amend or correct the Court’s opinion
(ECF No. 52) dated January 5, 2018, in the five above-referenced cases.1
On November 27, 2017, the Court denied the Defendants’ motion to dismiss on the
record. It indicated that a written order would be forthcoming. (ECF No. 42 at 49.) At trial on
December 1, 2017, after a stipulated bench trial, the Court found the Defendants guilty of the
misdemeanor offense of improper entry by an alien, 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(1), and sentenced the
Defendants. (See ECF No. 44.)2
On January 5, 2018, the Court issued its opinion denying the Defendants’ motion to
dismiss, but concluding, among other things, that the Defendants’ have parental rights under the

The Court previously agreed to allow the parties to file consolidated submissions

Constitution. (ECF No. 52.) In connection with that conclusion, the Court made the following
statements: “The Government does not appear to dispute that Defendants have parental rights
under the Constitution;” “All parties agree that Defendants have parental rights under the
Constitution”; and “The constitutional right to familial association is undisputed by the parties.”
(ECF No. 52 at 9, 11, 31.) These are incorrect statements of the Government’s position on this
issue.3
As the Government explained, it need not show that the Defendants lack parental rights
in order to establish a violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(1). (ECF No. 17 at 8.) The Defendants
affirmatively alleged that they had parental rights entitling them to the dismissal of the charges
against them, while failing to offer any evidence in support of those claims. (See ECF No. 13.)
The Government asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction over such tangential matters. (ECF
No. 17 at 8-9.) As the Court acknowledged elsewhere (ECF No. 6 n.11), the Government further
stated that it could not confirm that the Defendants are related to the juveniles with whom they
entered the United States, that it is difficult to make those determinations when individuals enter
the country illegally, and the Defendants had not offered any evidence that they were related as
they claimed. (See ECF No. 17 at 3 n.3; ECF No. 42 at 27, 41, 44-46, 48.)
The Government also explained that the Defendants had failed to establish any Due
Process violation. (ECF No. 17 at 16-18.) It cited several cases where courts had rejected
similar claims based on assertions of parental rights. (ECF No. 17 at 17 (citing cases).) It

Although the Government agrees with the Court’s ultimate decision to deny the
Defendants’ motion to dismiss, it disagrees with some of the Court’s characterizations of its
arguments and significant portions of the Court’s analysis (much of which is substantially
different from the arguments that the Government was responding to in the Defendants’ motion).
This motion is not directed toward those disagreements. Rather, it is focused on correcting the
misstatements of the Government’s position.

further noted that Defendants who have not effected an “entry” into the United States “do not
have the same constitutional rights under the Due Process clause as citizens or aliens who have
entered.” (ECF No. 17 at 18 (citing cases).)
Accordingly, the Government contended that the Defendants had not established their
parentage (or, in Ms. Zavala’s case, grandparentage) of the juveniles and also contended that
they had not established a violation of any potentially applicable constitutionally-protected
parental rights.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Government requests that the Court grant its motion to
amend or correct the opinion.
Respectfully submitted,
