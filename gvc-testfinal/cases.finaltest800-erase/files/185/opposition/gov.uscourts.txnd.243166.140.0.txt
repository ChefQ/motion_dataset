CHRISTOPHER ROBERT WEAST (01)

RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL
DESIGNATION OF EXPERT

TO THE HONORABLE JOHN MCBRYDE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:

The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, by and through the
undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, files this response in opposition to Weast's
motion for leave to file a supplemental designation of expert and would show the Court
the following:

Counsel for Weast was appointed in February 21, 2014, and remained on the case
until mid-April. During that time, as defense counsel acknowledges, Weast submitted a
designation of experts pursuant to the originally assigned court's scheduling order. The
defendant now seeks to supplement his expert designation without providing any reports
to support this proposed expert's general testimony that the defense now seeks to place
before the jury.

The government opposes Weast's request because the defendant has failed to
identify what opinions, if any, this witness proposes to endorse, and the government has
not had any opportunity to determine the underlying basis for this witness's conclusions.

Without knowing what opinions this witness has to offer, the government has no way to

rebut, if needed, those claims or determine the necessity of securing its own expert
witness to address the subjects Weast now proposes to introduce before the jury.
Moreover, based on the proposed summary listed in the defendant's designation, the
government submits that such testimony may be inadmissible because it is irrelevant and
likely to cause confusion to the jury.

If the Court grants Weast's motion for leave to file a supplemental designation of
experts, the government requests the Court order Weast to provide a summary of the
opinions that Weast's expert intends to offer no later than noon on Tuesday, July 22,
2014. The government also requests an opportunity to supplement its witness list in the
event that the newly received information warrants additional expert testimony not

previously identified in the government's list.

Respectfully submitted,
