RESPONSE TO MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL
DESIGNATION OF EXPERT

TO THE HONORABLE JOHN MCBRYDE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:

The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, by and through the
undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, files this response in opposition to Weast's
motion to introduce additional expert testimony and would show the Court the following:

On July 18, 2014, Weast filed a motion for leave to supplement its expert
designation; the government objected. Also on July 18, 2014, the Court issued an order
requiring the defendant to identify by July 22, 2014, the opinions the witness would
testify to and the basis and reasons for each opinion. |

Weast timely responded to the Court's Order by identifying two subject areas that
his "expert" Bill McGregor would testify to in trial: (1) computers are susceptible to
remote access and hacking; and (2) it is impossible to look at a visual depiction and know

if it depicts an actual minor.

eae sa

The government objects to this testimony for the reasons below and asks the Court
to deny Weast's request to supplement his expert witness designation and to exclude his
proposed testimony before the jury.

Argument and authorities

District courts are assigned a "gatekeeping role" to determine the admissibility of
expert testimony. United States v. Valencia, 600 F.3d 389, 424 (Sth Cir. 2010) (citing
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S, 579, 592-93 (1993)). Before
expert testimony is admissible, the court must find that it is relevant and reliable. Jd.
Part of this finding involves determining whether the expert has "reliably applied the
methods in question." /d. (citation omitted). Factors that affect reliability include the
following:

(1) whether a theory or technique can be tested;

(2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and

publication;

(3) the known or potential rate of error;

(4) the existence and maintenance of standards and controls; and

(5) general acceptance of the theory in the scientific or expert community.

id. (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-95).
1. Testimony about remote access and hacking is irrelevant.
Weast has provided the areas of testimony this witness would address, but he has

not identified any opinions or conclusions specific to this case that he intends to offer.

Response to Motion to Supplement
Expert Designation - Page 2 of 7
Case 4:14-cr-00023-A_ Document 157 Filed 07/23/14 Page 3of19 PagelD 841

z

He also has failed to provide the underlying basis to support his opinions as the Court
ordered on July 18, 2014. Without this information, the Court cannot exercise its
gatekeeping function and determine whether the testimony is reliable.

The government also submits that the evidence Mr. McGregor proposes to offer is
not relevant under Rule 401. To establish that testimony is relevant, Weast must show
that

(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be

without the evidence; and

(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.

FED R. Evip. 401, Whether a fact is "of consequence" is determined by the substantive
law that governs an action, which in a criminal case, "consists of elements of the offense
charged and any relevant defenses to defeat criminal liability." United States v.
Lamberty, 778 F.2d 59, 61 (ist Cir. 1985) (citing United States v. Hall, 653 F.2d 1002,
1005-06 (Sth Cir. 1981).

In terms of expert testimony, the Sixth Circuit has held that experts cannot testify
to general issues, but rather must tie their testimony to the facts of the case. In United
States v. LeBlanc, the Sixth Circuit considered whether the exclusion of an expert in child
interviewing techniques was proper in a case involving the sexual assault of a six-year-
old girl. 45 Fed. Appx. 393 (6th Cir. 2002) (unpublished opinion, copy attached). The
expert was prepared to testify about how a given interviewing technique could suggest
the answer to the victim, thereby tainting her statements. /d. at 398. The Sixth Circuit--

which disagreed with the district court's reasoning--concluded that exclusion of such

Case 4:14-cr-00023-A.. Document 157 Filed 07/23/14 Page 4of19 PagelD 842

nee vk

testimony was proper because, at no time did the expert "point to a single instance in
which the victim was supposedly subjected to allegedly coercive or suggestive
questioning techniques." Jd. at 399-400, 401. Without connecting the expert's testimony
to the facts of the case, the testimony "would have presented the jury with an abstract
theory...in the absence of any evidence that such was the case." Jd.

The same problem exists here. While it may be true that computers can be
susceptible to hacking or remote access, the defense has not suggested that their expert
will claim that Weast's computer was hacked or remotely accessed by another individual.
Additionally, this expert has provided no indication that even if there was evidence of
hacking or remote access, that it ties to an element of the offense or a defense. Because
general information about hacking or remote access to a computer does not make it more
likely or less likely to have occurred in this case, it is not a fact of consequence relevant
to the elements of the offense or a defense. Such testimony, then, should be excluded at
this time.

2, Testimony regarding "actual" minor

a. The witness lacks qualifications to render an "expert" opinion regarding
whether an image depicts an actual minor.

The defense provided a copy of Mr. McGregor's resume, a copy of which is
attached. While Mr. McGregor lists his experience and training regarding network
protection and intrusion prevention, he has not identified any specialized training or
knowledge that supports that he has expertise in the area of computer-generated images
of minors.

ad

Additionally, this witness has not identified the principles and methods he used to render
an opinion regarding the images and video in this case, and again, he has not provided the
Court with any evidence that he has reliably applied those principles and methods to the
facts of this case.

b. This testimony also should be excluded pursuant to Rules 401 and 403

Weast's computers were seized in 2012; at least some, if not all, of the charged
visual depictions were taken at least several years prior to the date the computers were
seized. Mr. McGregor's testimony about the current state of technology and software
cannot provide any helpful information to the jury that would illuminate whether at the
time of the offense was committed the defendant possessed depictions of actual minors.
Accordingly, his testimony is not relevant.

Moreover, the testimony about minors that the defense seeks to present to the jury
is, in essence, that they cannot rely on their own reasoning and common sense to
determine whether the charged images and video depict an actual minor. The
government submits such testimony would not be helpful to the jury; rather, it could be
misleading and confusing, because the state of the law in the Fifth Circuit and many other
circuits is just the contrary---jurors can determine whether an image depicts a real minor
without the assistance of experts. See, United States v. Slanina, 359 F.3d 356, 357 (Sth
Cir, 2005) (the government was not required to present any additional evidence or expert
testimony to meet its burden of proof to show that the images downloaded by [the
defendant] depicted real children, and not virtual children."); United States v. McNealy,

625 F.3d, 858, 865 (5th Cir. 2010).

igen?

Other circuits have also held that no expert testimony was required to prove the children
depicted in the images are "real." See, United States v. Rodriquez-Pacheco, 475 F.3d
434, 441 (ist Cir. 2007); United States v. Destio, 153 Fed. Appx. 888, 892, 93 (3d Cir.
2005); United States v. Farrelly, 389 F.3d 649, 654 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v.
Lacey, 569 F.3d 319, 325 (7th Cir. 2009); and United States v. Hall, 312 F.3d 1250, 1260
(1th Cir. 2002).

Finally, should the Court conclude that such testimony was based on reliable
methodology and relevant, its probative value would be substantially outweighed by the
danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues and misleading the jury. FED. R. EvIp.
403,

Conclusion

In conclusion, the government submits that Weast still has not provided sufficient
information to support introduction of any expert testimony by Mr. McGregor.
Additionally, Mr. McGregor lacks the qualifications to render an opinion regarding
"actual" minors. Because none of the testimony the defense seeks to offer through this
witness has been related to the facts of this case, it would at best, be confusing and

misleading to the jury.

UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
Daniel George LEBLANC, Defendant-Appeliant.

No. 01-1517,
Aug. 28, 2002.

Defendant was convicted by jury in the United
States District Court for the Western District of
Michigan of sexually assaulting his six-year-old
step-daughter in his home on Indian reservation,
and he appealed. The Court of Appeals held that:
(1) police investigator's alleged "promise" to de-
fendant that he could speak with his wife after he
spoke with investigator regarding allegations that
he had sexually assaulted his step-daughter did not
amount to objectively coercive police activity that
would render defendant's confession involuntary,
and (2) testimony of defense's expert concerning
the appropriateness of techniques used to question
defendant's six-year-old step-daughter about his al-
leged sexually assault of her was properly excluded
for failure to show relevancy of the testimony.

Affirmed.

Police investigator's alleged "promise" to de-

spoke with investigator regarding allegations that
he had sexually assaulted his step-daughter did not
amount to objectively coercive police activity that
would render defendant's confession involuntary,
where police investigator had merely passed along
to defendant an apparent promise made by his wife, -
not a promise from the police, and although defend-
ant emphasized his allegedly overwrought "mental
state" at the time of the interview, investigator testi-
fied that defendant appeared to be sober and did not
manifest any confusion or lack of understanding.

To show that confession was involuntary, de-

was objectively coercive, (2) coercion in question
was sufficient to overbear defendant's will, and (3)
defendant's will was in fact, overborne as a result of
the coercive police activity.

PER CURIAM.

**] The defendant, Daniel LeBlanc, was con-
victed by a jury of sexually assaulting his six-
year-old step-daughter in his home in the Bay Mills
Indian Community reservation. On appeal, LeBlanc
raises a Fifth Amendment challenge to the admis-
sion of his out-of-court statements, and he chal-
lenges the exclusion of his proffered expert testi-
mony regarding the susceptibility of children to co-
ercive or suggestive interviewing techniques. We
find no reversible error and affirm.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACK-
GROUND

The events giving rise to the charge occurred
on an evening when the defendant was at home
alone with his six-year-old step-daughter, S.S, and
his young son. His wife, the children's mother, was
away helping a neighbor prepare for a party at a
nearby residence. According to LeBlanc's  testi-
mony on direct examination, he was sitting on the
couch watching a pornographic movie when 8.8.
entered the room. LeBlanc testified that he put car-
toons on the television for her and reclined on the
couch. As 0x00A7.S. sat watching cartoons at the bottom
of the couch between LeBlanc's legs, he said, he
had thoughts of "having her give me oral sex." He
admitted having had such thoughts once before,
when 8.8. was in the shower with him.
