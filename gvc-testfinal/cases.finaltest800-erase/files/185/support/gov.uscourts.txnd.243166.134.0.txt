CHRISTOPHER ROBERT WEAST (1)

MOTION FOR LEAVE OF COURT TO FILE
SUPPLEMENTAL DESIGNATION OF EXPERT

COMES NOW, Christopher Robert Weast, through counsel, Assistant Federal Public
Defender Angela R. Saad, and respectfully moves this Court for an order granting the Defendant
leave of court to file a Supplemental Designation of Expert out of time for the following reason:

1. The Defendant is scheduled for trial on July 28, 2014. Pursuant to the Court's order in
this case, pretrial motions must be filed June 11, 2014.

2. Defense counsel was appointed February 21, 2014 to represent Mr. Weast. On March
11, 2014, defense counsel timely submitted a designation of expert. This request was pursuant to
our defense to the first indictment, which alleged violations of 18 USC. 0x00A70x00A7 2252(a)(4)(B),
2252(b)(2), and 2256(8).

3. On April 22, 2014, counsel's appointment was terminated. Defense counsel was
reappointed on June 5, 2014 for the competency hearing. On July 8, 2014, we were again
reappointed to represent the defendant for jury trial. While defense counsel was appointed to
represent the defendant when the June 11, 2014 deadline passed, the scope of representation was
limited to "the competency hearing and related matters." On July 15, 2014, the Court denied our
motion for reconsideration of appointment of counsel.

4. The defendant was arraigned on the third superseding indictment July 8, 2014. Currently,

 
Case 4:14-cr-00023-A Document 134 Filed 07/18/14 Page 2of3 PagelD 754

the defendant is facing charges pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 2252A(a)(5)(B), 2252A(b)(2), 2256(8)(A),
2252A(a)(2)(A), and 2252A(b)(1). The charges from the current indictment changed from the
original indictment, which in turn changes the defense. In order to ensure the defendant's
constitutional rights, defense counsel respectfully requests leave of court to file the Supplemental
Designation of Expert out of time.
5. Counsel respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant leave to file the
Supplemental Designation of Expert out of time.
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court allow counsel to
file out of time the Supplemental Designation of Expert.
Respectfully submitted,
JASON HAWKINS
