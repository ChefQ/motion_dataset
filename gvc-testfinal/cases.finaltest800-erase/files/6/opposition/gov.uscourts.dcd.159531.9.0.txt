NON-PARTY PHILLIPS & COHEN LLP’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION
TO MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME

Non-party Phillips & Cohen LLP (“P&C”) objected to Thorpe and Hamrick’s
request for an extension because Thorpe and Hamrick seek to delay the resolution of
P&C’s motion while using that delay to pursue further discovery subject to the exact
same objections raised in the pending motion. The propriety of Thorpe and Hamrick’s
use of their malpractice litigation as a pretext to gather information about non-party P&C
is squarely presented by the pending Motion to Quash or, in the Alternative, for
Protective Order Re: Subpoena (the “Motion”). Accordingly, the Court’s resolution of
the motion necessarily also will resolve the issue of whether other discovery equally
focused on P&C (rather than on the claims in the pending case) is improper. Thus, P&C
informed Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel that it would consent to the requested extension

subject to the reasonable condition that Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel would not use the
delay to pursue other discovery relating to P&C. Yet Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel—
despite the absence of any discovery cutoff necessitating haste—have refused P&C’s
common-sense request that they stop seeking information about P&C’s confidential
internal work product and its representation of its own clients until the Court decides, in
the context of the pending motion, whether that discovery is improper.
P&C is a law firm. It has never represented plaintiffs Thorpe or Hamrick,
although it did reject Thorpe’s inquiry about retaining P&C. 1 Thorpe and Hamrick,
represented by Cross & Bennett (C&B), thereafter filed a qui tam, or “whistleblower”
suit against GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”). P&C represented two other clients (Thomas
Gerahty and Matthew Burke) in a parallel suit against GSK. The two sets of
whistleblowers agreed to work together and to split the aggregate proceeds of their cases
50-50. When it became clear that the recovery in the GSK lawsuits would be substantial,
Thorpe began seeking ways to increase his recovery at the expense of others. Thorpe and
Hamrick demanded that C&B reduce its contingency fee in the case; when C&B
declined, Thorpe and Hamrick fired them. Separately, Thorpe schemed to repudiate the
relators’ share agreement and reduce Gerahty and Burke’s shares of any recovery.
Ultimately, Thorpe and Hamrick received over $74 million for their role as
whistleblowers in the case. Nonetheless, they have sought an additional $75 million in
damages from C&B for alleged malpractice.
Separately—i.e. outside the context of their malpractice suit against C&B, Thorpe
and Hamrick have begun to assert (baseless) ethical concerns about P&C’s conduct in the
GSK litigation in a transparent effort to explore potential claims against P&C. Thorpe
and Hamrick’s counsel, in letters dated April 18 and May 2, 2013, has sought substantial

3-7 of P&C’s Motion to Quash, or in the Alternative for Protective Order, re: Subpoena

information about P&C’s evaluation and rejection of Thorpe’s inquiry and about P&C’s
representation of Gerahty and Burke in the GSK cases.
P&C has recently learned that, without informing P&C, Thorpe and Hamrick’s
counsel has sought much of the same information from Bonny Harbinger, a former P&C
lawyer. Indeed, although Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel acknowledged that P&C
objected to the provision of the information on grounds of relevance, privilege, and work
product—objections that are now before the Court in P&C’s Motion—Thorpe and
Hamrick’s counsel told Harbinger that she could ignore those objections and unilaterally
disclose the information without P&C’s consent and without any ruling from the Court
on P&C’s objections. See Hasegawa Decl., Ex. A. P&C also has learned—again, not
from Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel, who have not seen fit to inform P&C about their
efforts to obtain P&C’s internal information—that Thorpe and Hamrick are attempting to
serve a deposition subpoena (issued from this Court) for Harbinger’s testimony. See
Hasegawa Decl., Ex. B.
Because Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel have attempted to keep P&C in the dark
about their efforts to obtain information from former P&C lawyers, P&C does not know
whether Thorpe and Hamrick have contacted other former P&C lawyers or taken the
position (as they did with Harbinger) that those other former P&C lawyers may
unilaterally disclose confidential P&C information notwithstanding P&C’s objections on
privilege, work-product, or other grounds. To the extent that Thorpe and Hamrick have
sought P&C’s information from others, they have not given P&C any opportunity to raise
objections to or to protect against the disclosure of P&C work product or confidential
information about P&C’s representation of its clients.
In P&C’s Motion, the principal (though not the only) objection that P&C has
asserted is that Thorpe and Hamrick are improperly using their malpractice suit against
defendants C&B as a pretext to gather information to evaluate or prosecute a future suit
against non-party P&C. See Doc. 1 at 5-8, 9-10, 17-20. In addition, P&C raised the

NON-PARTY P&C’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR EXTENSION

Case 1:13-mc-00405-JEB-DAR Document 9 Filed 05/10/13 Page 4 of 7

obvious objection that Thorpe and Hamrick’s demands for P&C’s internal work product
concerning the GSK case, its evaluation of other potential cases, its confidential
communications with lawyers for a co-party (the government) in the GSK case, and its
confidential communications with co-counsel in other cases seek materials protected
from discovery by the work product doctrine.
These same objections apply equally to Thorpe and Hamrick’s efforts to obtain
information about P&C from former P&C lawyers, including Bonny Harbinger. Thus,
while P&C’s Motion does not seek relief as to to Thorpe and Hamrick’s subpoena to
Harbinger—nor can it, since, to P&C’s knowledge, that subpoena has not even been
served—the rationale for the Court’s ruling on P&C’s objections will decide the
important issues of (a) whether Thorpe and Hamrick can properly use their pending
lawsuit against C&B as a pretext to obtain information relating to P&C; and (b) whether
information P&C created in litigating actual cases or evaluating potential ones is
protected from discovery by the work product doctrine. Given that Thorpe and Hamrick
do not yet have a discovery cutoff in their pending litigation, there is no reason to
proceed with discovery whose propriety will be resolved by the pending motion.
P&C accordingly proposed a reasonable accommodation in exchange for Thorpe
and Hamrick’s counsel’s request for an extension: wait until the resolution of the pending
Motion to seek any more discovery relating to P&C. Such a postponement would result
in no cognizable harm to Thorpe and Hamrick (who, again, have no pending discovery
cutoff), but it would serve the interests of this Court in eliminating duplicative motion
practice, and it might put an end to Thorpe and Hamrick’s counsel’s efforts to obtain
P&C’s internal information without even giving notice to P&C. If Thorpe and Hamrick
want to delay the Court’s resolution of the Motion, they should not be allowed to use that
delay to pursue discovery that is subject to the same objections asserted in the Motion.
Because Thorpe and Hamrick have refused that reasonable compromise, P&C opposes
their request for an extension.
