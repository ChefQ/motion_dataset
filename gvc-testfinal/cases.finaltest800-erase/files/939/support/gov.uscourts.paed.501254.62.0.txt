Case 2:15-cv-00862-NIQA Document 62 Filed 01/20/16 Page 1 of 4

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
LIVE FACE ON WEB, LLC,
Plaintiff
v.

Civil Action No.: 2:15-00862-NIQA

ESTATE OF DON EAGLE,
DIANE EAGLE, and
MATT EAGLE,
Defendants
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
INTERROGATORIES AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff, Live Face on Web, LLC (“LFOW” or “Plaintiff”), by and through its counsel,
hereby moves this Court to compel responses to discovery requests and production of documents
of Defendants Estate of Don Eagle (“Estate”), Diane Eagle (“Diane”), and Matt Eagle (“Matt”)
(hereinafter collectively “Defendants”). In support, Plaintiff states as follows:
1. On September 9, 2015, Plaintiff served its first set of interrogatories and requests for
production of documents (“discovery requests”) on the Defendants via email. A copy of the
email is attached hereto and marked as Exhibit “A.”
2. More than thirty (30) days have passed since Defendants’ responses to Plaintiff’s
discovery requests were due.
3. Defendants have not responded to Plaintiff’s interrogatories.
4. Defendants filed with the court their responses to Plaintiff’s requests for production of
documents [Doc. No. 61]; however, no documents were produced and Defendants instead
asserted improper objections.

5. Defendants’ objections to Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents are entirely
inappropriate and improper.
6. As an example of the type of improper objections served by Defendants, in response to
request number 3 of Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents, which was a request for
“documents sufficient to identify any duty or role of Don Eagle in or for Tweople,” Defendants
improperly objected to said request as “irrelevant.” Certainly evidence related to the role Mr.
Eagle played in Tweople is relevant to establishing that Mr. Eagle, in his individual capacity, is
liable for copyright infringement.
7. Additionally, Defendants objected to all financial discovery. For example, in response
to request number 16 of Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents, which was a request for
“documents sufficient to calculate Your profits for all products or services advertised or
described on Your website during the relevant time frame,” Defendants improperly objected to
said request as “vague” and failed to produce any documents in response to the request. This is a
straightforward request and certainly relevant to Plaintiff’s claim for damages.
8. In some of their responses to Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents,
Defendants stated that they “will produce representative nonprivileged documents” but failed to
actually produce any document.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff is respectfully requesting that Defendants be directed to fully
respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests within two (2) days or face sanctions by this Court.
Dated this 20th day of January, 2016.
