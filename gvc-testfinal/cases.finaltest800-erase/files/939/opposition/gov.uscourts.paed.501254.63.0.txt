DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO
COMPEL RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES AND PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS
Defendants Diane Eagle and Matt Eagle (“Defendants”) hereby file this Response in Opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Production of Documents,
stating:
INTRODUCTION
1. On September 9, 2015, Plaintiff served its first set of interrogatories and requests for
production of documents (“discovery requests”) on the Defendants via email.
2. Defendants have since filed with the court their Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents.
3. On January 20, 2016, Plaintiff moved to compel Defendants to respond and produce
documents responsive to Plaintiff’s First Request.
4. The motion should be denied. Plaintiff’s requests seek irrelevant documents,
impermissibly seek discovery of private financial information and likely constitute
impermissible and premature discovery in aid of execution, and are exceedingly

overbroad and vague. For these reasons, explained in more detail below, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel should be denied and Defendants’ objections sustained.
ARGUMENT
1. While the permissible scope of discovery is indeed broad, it is not unlimited. See East
Colonial Refuse Serv., Inc. v. Velocci, 416 So. 2d 1276, 1277 (Fla. 5th DCA 1982). To be
discoverable, the information sought must be relevant to the proceeding and admissible
or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Allstate Ins.
Corp. v. Langston, 655 So. 2d 91, 94 (Fla. 1995). See also Velocci, 416 So. 2d at 1277;
see also McCarty v. Estate of Schultz, 372 So. 2d 210, 212 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979) (party
may not utilize the discovery process for a “mere fishing expedition or general
inquisitorial examination of papers with a view to ascertaining whether something of
value may or may not show up”). And even if this relevance standard is met, “the
particular items or information sought to be discovered may be privileged and therefore
beyond permissible discovery.” See Velocci, 416 So. 2d at 1278-78, n.2 (citing Central
Florida Skates, Inc. v. Thomas, 393 So. 2d 1200 (Fla. 5th DCA), rev. denied, 402 So. 2d
608 (Fla. 1981)). Thus, the court has broad discretion to refuse discovery of irrelevant
information, deny requests that are unreasonable and oppressive, and protect privileged
information. Here, Plaintiff’s requests run afoul of both requirements—they seek
documents that are irrelevant and call for disclosure of protected financial information.
And as if that were not enough, the requests also are overbroad and vague.
2. Plaintiff seems to be confused as to what this proceeding is about, as Plaintiff states in the
initial Complaint that Defendants have committed an alleged act of Racketeering, yet
Plaintiff claims to seek to establish that Don Eagle is liable for copyright infringement

solely “in his individual capacity”, not in a pattern of conspiring with the other
Defendants. Plaintiff clearly seeks to pierce the corporate veil, and harass defendants.
3. Plaintiff also seeks to burden Defendants with the production of “documents sufficient to
identify any duty or role of Don Eagle in or for Tweople,” despite Plaintiff already
having these documents in Plaintiff’s possession, as they were provided in the Tweople
proceedings. This can be evidenced in Plaintiff’s initial Complaint.
4. Furthermore, much of what the Plaintiff has requested in Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production have already been provided in the Tweople proceedings, as Plaintiff has
restated many requests verbatim, in an effort to overly and unduly burden the Court and
Defendants.
5. Plaintiff’s motion should also be denied because requests seek Diane Eagle’s and Matt
Eagle’s private financial information without any relevant or compelling reason for doing
so.
6. Moreover, “the burden to prove the information is relevant or reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in on the party seeking the information.” Id.
(citing Spry v. Prof’l Emp’r Plans, 985 So. 2d 1187, 1188-89 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008)). This
determination can be made only after an evidentiary hearing. Id. It is a departure from the
essential requirements of law for a court to order production of personal financial
information without first conducting an evidentiary inquiry into its relevance. Rowe, 89
So. 2d at 1103. The assertions or arguments of a party’s attorney are not sufficient
evidence of relevance. See DiSarrio v. Mills, 711 So. 2d 1355, 1357 (Fla 2d. DCA 1998).
7. Plaintiff’s requests for financial information, on their face, seek nothing relevant to the
claims currently at issue in this dispute. Rather, they ask for information relating to Diane
Eagle’s and Matt Eagle’s personal finances. This financial information is not relevant to

the claims or defenses of any party and Plaintiff offers no compelling reason for its
disclosure.
8. Additionally, any Requests relating to non-personal financial statements, such as those
relating to Tweople, Inc., can likely be ascertained through documents already in the
Plaintiff’s possession through discovery in the Tweople proceedings, as well as those
obtained by Plaintiff through Subpoenas targeted at Tweople’s credit card processing
provider.
9. Defendants have, indeed, stated in some of their responses that they would produce
relevant documents. However, Plaintiff is being unreasonable in their time constraint of
two (2) days, considering the broad scope of what is being provided by Defendants.
Defendants are actively working to compile the relevant documents and will produce
them in as timely a fashion as they can manage.
10. Additionally, Defendants are actively compiling their response to Plaintiff’s
Interrogatories, despite the overwhelming burden also imposed on Defendants by
compiling responsive documents relevant to overbroad requests by Plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s motion to compel should be denied and
Defendants’ objections to requests sustained.
WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court enter an Order. (i)
denying Plaintiff’s motion to compel, (ii) sustaining Defendants’ objections to Plaintiff’s
requests, and (iii) awarding Defendants adequate relief as the Court deems just and
proper under the circumstances.
Dated this 25th day of January, 2016.
