DEFENDANTS DOUBLE DIAMOND DISTRIBUTION, LTD., USA DAWGS, INC. AND
EFFERVESCENT, INC’S MOTION TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING INTER
PARTES REEXAMINATIONS

Double Diamond Distribution, Ltd. (“Double Diamond”), U.S.A. Dawgs, Inc. (“USA
Dawgs”) and Effervescent, Inc. (“Effervescent”), through counsel, hereby submit their motion to
stay the proceedings pending inter partes reexamination of the patents-in-suit.
Pursuant to D.C.COLO.LCivR 7.1(A), the undersigned has conferred with Counsel for
Plaintiff by phone and email regarding this motion. Plaintiff objects to the requested relief.
I.

INTRODUCTION
Defendant Double Diamond has filed a request for inter partes reexamination with the

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) with respect to Crocs U.S. Patent No.
6,993,858 B2 (“the ‘858 patent”). The request was submitted on August 3, 2012, and has been
issued Reexam Control Number 95/002,064 by the USPTO. Defendant USA Dawgs has filed a
request for inter partes reexamination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 14

(USPTO) with respect to Crocs U.S. Patent No. D 517, 789 (“the ‘789 patent”). The request was
filed August 24, 2012 and has been issued Reexam Control Number 95/002,100.
All of the claims in this action relate to the ‘858 patent or the ‘789 patent. The inter
partes reexaminations will simplify, or outright resolve, the issues in this case.
Crocs will not be harmed by a stay allowing the USPTO to consider the highly relevant
prior art that Double Diamond has identified. Crocs has already been granted an exclusion order
by the United States International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) prohibiting any party from
importing shoes that include those in dispute here. None of the Defendants currently import or
sell the accused infringing product in the United States.
Crocs did not disclose, and the USPTO did not consider, several prior art patents that
disclose patentee’s claims. Indeed, the prosecution history of the patents-in-suit conspicuously
lacks any mention of prior art known to the patentee, including the prior existence and sale of the
clog shoe designed by Ettore Battiston from which the entire patented design was copied (with
the mere addition of a common pivoting strap), or the prior sales of the Aqua Clog, which, minus
a heel strap, is the very same shoe that Crocs claims to have invented several years later.
Combined with other art that was previously not considered, the USPTO will undoubtedly look
closely at the patentee’s claims. Since the inter partes reexamination requests covers both the
‘858 patent, as well as the ‘789 patent, such a reexamination will simplify issues in this case, if
not eliminate the case completely.
In 2006, this case was administratively closed when Crocs decided to pursue its rights at
the ITC instead of this Court. The case has only recently been re-opened. No discovery has
commenced and no substantive motion practice has occurred. A stay of proceedings at this

-2-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 14

juncture to permit the USPTO to reconsider the validity of the patent claims in light of the prior
art is in the best interest of the Court and the parties. At a minimum, Defendants request that the
Court stay this litigation at least until such time as the USPTO has had a chance to consider and
either accept or deny the pending requests for reexamination.
II.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
A.

The Filing and Reopening of the Present Action.

On April 3, 2006, Plaintiff Crocs, Inc. (“Crocs”) brought this action against Defendants
Double Diamond Distribution, Ltd., Effervescent, Inc. and other defendants, alleging
infringement of the patents-in-suit. On May 16, 2006, at Crocs request, the Court
administratively closed the instant case due to the pendency of an investigation before the ITC,
under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.
On July 15, 2011, the ITC issued a Final Commission Determination including a general
exclusion order and a cease and desist order. On April 27, 2012, Crocs filed a Motion to Lift
Stay and Transfer Record in the case at bar. The Court granted that motion on May 9, 2012.
On August 6, 2012, this court granted Crocs' motion to amend its complaint to add USA
Dawgs, Inc. as a defendant. USA Dawgs has timely filed its answer, affirmative defenses and
counterclaims contemporaneously with this motion.
B.

The ITC Determination does not preclude invalidity defenses to the patentrelated claims or issues in this case.

The United States district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over patent
infringement cases. 28 U.S.C. §1338(a). While the ITC has been granted certain powers over
import trade (which necessarily implicated patent issues in some cases), the jurisdiction is
limited, and excludes, among others, the power to award damages for infringement. Hence, “…
-3-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 14

the ITC’s determinations regarding patent issues should be given no res judicata or collateral
estoppel effect.” Texas Instruments, Inc. v United States Int’l Trade Comm’n, 851 F.2d 342, 344
(Fed. Cir. 1988)(quoted in Bio-Tech. Gen. Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., 80 F.3d 1553, 1564 (Fed.
Cir. 1996)). See also, Corning Glass Works v. United States Int’l Trade Comm’n, 79 F.2d 1559,
1570 n.12 (Fed Cir. 1986)(stating that the legislative history of the Trade Reform Act of 1974
supports the determination that ITC decisions on patent matters lack preclusive effect). While a
district court may not ignore precedent from the Federal Circuit, “ITC decisions are not binding
on district courts in subsequent cases brought before them.” Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Cypress
Semiconductor Corp., 90 F.3d 1558, 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Moreover, appellate treatment of
ITC decisions by the Federal Circuit also lacks preclusive effect. Tandon Corp. v. United States
Int'l Trade Comm'n, 831 F.2d 1017, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 1987)(“[O]ur appellate treatment of
decisions of the Commission does not estop fresh consideration by other tribunals.”). While
such findings have persuasive value, they do not receive any deferential treatment nor do they
have a preclusive effect on any findings and opinions rendered by this Court. Texas Instruments,
Inc., 90 F.3d at 1568.
C.

Requests for Inter partes Reexamination.

Because Crocs was successful at obtaining a general exclusion order and a cease and
desist order in July 2011, and this action was administratively closed, Double Diamond
reasonably believed that Crocs had abandoned the instant litigation. Immediately upon
understanding that Crocs intended to again pursue claims of infringement, Double Diamond
evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of Crocs claims and undertook a prior art search with
respect to the claims of the two patents-in-suit. Double Diamond and USA Dawgs recently

-4-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 14

located several pieces of prior art that invalidate Croc’s claims and raise substantial new
questions of patentability not considered during the original prosecution of the patents-in-suit
and diligently drafted the inter partes reexamination petitions, which were filed August 3, 2012,
and August 24, 2012 respectively. See Attached Exhibit “1” Double Diamond request for inter
partes reexamination of Crocs ‘858 patent and, Exhibit “2” USA Dawgs request for inter partes
reexamination of Crocs ‘789 patent.
1.

Summary of the inter partes reexamination procedure.

Any challenger may request an inter partes reexamination at any time during the
enforceable life of the patent. See 35 U.S.C. § 302. The initial step in an inter partes
reexamination is for the challenger to file a written request seeking such reexamination. See 35
U.S.C. § 311. Not later than three months after the filing of the request, the USPTO must
determine whether to grant the request for reexamination. 35 U.S.C. § 312. Upon completion of
the reexamination process, the USPTO will issue a certificate canceling any claim of the patent
finally determined to be unpatentable, and confirming any claim of the patent determined to be
patentable.” 35 U.S.C. § 307(a).
In this case, therefore, the USPTO must decide Double Diamond’s request to reexamine
the ‘858 patent not later than November 3, 2012, and USA Dawgs request to reexamine the ‘789
patent not later than, November 24, 2012. Recent statistics from the USPTO, however, suggest
that the USPTO will issue an order accepting or denying the request for reexamination, on
average, in approximately 60 days. Once accepted, the USPTO is required to reexamine with
“special dispatch.” See 35 U.S.C. § 305.

-5-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 14

The likely result is that the request will be granted. In fact, since fiscal year 2000, when
the USPTO began inter partes reexaminations, through June 30, 2012, the USPTO has granted
94% of the total requests. Consistent with those historical statistics, the USPTO has also granted
94% of inter partes reexamination requests in fiscal year 2012, year to date.
Inter partes reexaminations also typically lead to cancellation or amendment of patent
claims. The most recent statistics show in inter partes reexaminations, 89% of all
reexaminations result in cancelled or modified claims (42% cancelled or disclaimed all claims,
47% changed the claims, and only 11% confirmed all claims).
2.

The new prior art cited in the reexamination requests.

As more thoroughly set out in each of the reexamination requests, attached hereto as
Exhibits “A” and “B”, both of the claims of the ‘858 patent are invalid in view of the prior art,
and the ‘789 patent is invalid in view of the prior art. The reexamination requests identify
seventeen primary and secondary references, that alone, or in combination, disclose all of the
elements of the claimed invention. The references identified are:
UK Patent Application GB 2,322,286 (“GB '286”)
UK Patent GB 1,166,585 (“GB '585”)
IT Patent Number IT00245068 (PD98U000068; “IT' '068)
U.S. Patent Number 3,336,683 to Schellkopf (“Schellkopf '683”)
U.S. Patent Number 3,570,147 to Chiu (“Chiu '147”)
U.S. Patent Number 4,300,256 to Laganas (“Laganas '256)
U.S. Patent Number 4,327,503 to Johnson (“Johnson '503)
U.S. Patent Number 6,115,941 to Ellis III (“Ellis '941”)

Considering the similarities between the asserted claims and the prior art presented in the
reexamination request, it is highly likely that the USPTO will grant the request and ultimately
reject the asserted claims. Accordingly, it would be duplicative and inefficient to proceed in this
litigation when the inter partes reexamination requests relate to the entirety of the patents-in-suit,
and the outcome of the reexamination will affect this case and must be used by the Court to
properly construe the claims, if any claims survive.
III.

THE COURT SHOULD STAY THIS LITIGATION PENDING INTER PARTES
REEXAMINATION OF THE PATENTS-IN-SUIT.
A.

Courts Apply a “Liberal Policy” of Granting Stays Pending Reexamination.

“Courts have inherent power to manage their dockets and stay proceedings, including the
authority to order a stay pending conclusion of a PTO reexamination.” Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg,
849 F.2d 1422, 1426-27 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (internal citations omitted). Courts generally recognize
that “there is a liberal policy in favor of granting motions to stay proceedings pending the

-7-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 14

outcome of USPTO reexamination proceedings.” Icon Health & Fitness, Inc. v. Park City
Entertainment, Inc., 2011 WL 5239733 (D. Utah, Nov. 1, 2011).
This Court has favored imposing a stay when a patent reexamination has been filed.
Granting a motion to stay “is the norm in cases where a reexamination proceeding is pending in
the USPTO. Genetic Technologies Ltd. v. Agilent Technologies, Inc., 2011 WL 5024839 (D.
Colo. 2011) (citing EdiSync Sys., Inc. v. Centra Software, Inc., 2009 WL 3698520 (D .Colo.
2009) (applying four-factor test and granting motion to stay pending outcome of patent
reexamination proceedings)); eSoft, Inc. v. Blue Coat Sys., Inc., 505 F.Supp.2d 784 (D.Colo.
2007) (same); Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc.,2006 WL 1897165
(D.Colo. July 11, 2006) (same).
This Court has recognized that the USPTO patent reexamination process was intended to
shift the burden of reexamination of patent validity from the courts to the USPTO. eSoft, at 786
(citing Canady v. Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, 271 F.Supp.2d 64, 78 (D.D.C.2002)). Courts have
observed that “the reexamination process was enacted by Congress to provide certainty in the
validity of patent rights and to provide a faster, less expensive remedy than litigation when the
validity of a patent is at issue.” Spectros Corp. v. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., No. 09-1996,
2010 WL 338093, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 20,2010).
B.

All of the Relevant Factors Favor a Stay in This Case.

In determining whether to grant a stay of proceedings pending reexamination, courts
routinely consider four factors: (1) whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and
streamline the trial; (2) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set; (3)
whether a stay would unduly prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear tactical advantage

-8-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 14

for the moving party; and (4) whether a stay will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties
and on the court. eSoft, Inc. v. Blue Coat Systems, Inc. 505 F.Supp.2d 784, at 787 (D. Colo.
2007) (citing Broadcast Innovation, 2006 WL 1897165 at *4); Tap Pharm. Prods. Inc. v. Atrix
Labs., Inc., 2004 WL 422697, 70 U.S.P.Q.2d 1319, 1320 (N.D.Ill. 2004); Nexmed Holdings, Inc.
v. Block Inv., Inc., 2006 WL 149044, at *1 (D. Utah Jan. 19, 2006). The Court in eSoft also
noted that “Courts frequently collapse the first and fourth factors” issue simplification and
reduction of burden. See eSoft, at 787.
1.

A stay will simplify the issues for trial and reduce the burden on the
parties and the court.

The first factor examines whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and trial of
the case. The Federal Circuit has explained that a major “‘purpose of the reexamination
procedure is to eliminate trial of that issue (when the claim is canceled) or facilitate trial of that
issue by providing the district court with the expert view of the PTO (when a claim survives the
reexamination proceeding).’” Yodlee, Inc., 2009 WL 112857 at *5 (citations omitted) (citing
eSoft, Inc., 505 F. Supp. 2d at 787 (quoting Gould v. Control Laser Corp., 705 F.2d 1340, 1342
(Fed. Cir. 1983))).
As a result, even if the USPTO were to leave all claims of the ‘858 patent unchanged (an
11% likelihood according to recent statistics), a stay would be warranted because the Court
would benefit from the USPTO’s expert analysis of the claims and the prosecution history
produced during the reexamination proceeding. The Court has recognized that:
reexamination proceedings will eliminate, narrow, or clarify the
disputed issues in [] litigation. Any claims that are cancelled
during the reexamination will not need to be litigated and those
claims that survive reexamination may be amended. A stay would
-9-

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 14

also prevent resources from being expended on invalid or amended
claims.
Icon Health & Fitness, Inc. v. Park City Entertainment, Inc., 2011 WL 5239733 (D. Utah 2011).
Here, inter partes reexamination requests have been submitted for both of the patents-insuit, which will likely narrow or even eliminate the issues in this case. Also, significantly, by
filing for inter partes reexamination, Double Diamond and USA Dawgs have each subjected
themselves to the estoppel provided by 35 U.S.C. § 315(c) with respect to the issues raised
before the USPTO:
(c) CIVIL ACTION. A third-party requester whose request for an inter
partes reexamination results in an order under section 313 is estopped
from asserting at a later time, in any civil action arising in whole or in part
under section 1338 of title 28, the invalidity of any claim finally
determined to be valid and patentable on any ground which the third-party
requester raised or could have raised during the inter partes reexamination
proceedings. This subsection does not prevent the assertion of invalidity
based on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the third-party
requester and the Patent and Trademark Office at the time of the inter
partes reexamination proceedings.
Accordingly, the results of the reexamination proceedings are final and binding on
Double Diamond and USA Dawgs with respect to these matters, and the reexamination, will, at a
minimum, eliminate the need for proceedings involving invalidity based on prior art cited in the
request.
Related to the first factor, the fourth factor evaluates whether the reexamination would
reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and the court. If any of the claim from Crocs’ ‘858
or ‘789 patents survive reexamination, then this Court will have an expert opinion supporting
Crocs’ claims. If on the other hand, reexamination leads to the cancellation or modification of
either or both of the patents-in-suit, then Crocs’ case, and the issues remaining for litigation will

- 10 -

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 11 of 14

be severely narrowed. Moreover, a stay of the instant matter will preclude inefficiencies and the
unnecessary time, expense and judicial resources that would be created by any potential
inconsistencies between determinations by this court and the USPTO concerning the validity of
the ‘858 patent or the ‘789 patent. Thus, the first factor, issue clarification and simplification,
and the fourth factor, reduction of burden of litigation for the parties and for the Court, weigh
heavily in favor of deferral to the expertise of the USPTO and a stay of these proceedings.
2.

This case is in the earliest stage - discovery is not started and a trial
date has not been set.

The second factor examines the stage of the case. “Courts have recognized that ‘there is a
liberal policy in favor of granting motions to stay proceedings pending the outcome of USPTO
reexamination proceedings.’” Pool Cover Specialists Nat., Inc. v. Cover-Pools Inc., 2009 WL
2999036 (D. Utah 2009) (quoting, ASCII Corp. v. STD Ent. USA, Inc., 844 F.Supp. 1378, 1381
(N.D.Cal. 1994)).
Despite being originally filed in 2006, this action remains in its infancy. Crocs reopened
this action in April, 2012. Thereafter Crocs filed a motion to amend its complaint which was
granted on August 6, 2012. USA Dawgs was served on August 15, 2012 and has made its first
appearance in conjunction with the filing of this motion. No discovery has taken place. No other
schedule or trial date has been set.
Accordingly, this factor strongly weighs in favor of a stay. See, e.g., eSoft, Inc. 505
F.Supp.2d at 784 (granting a stay even after discovery had been completed); Broadcast
Innovation, L.L.C. v. Charter Communication, Inc., 2006 WL 1897165 (D. Colo. 2006)
(granting motion to stay when trial was less than three months away); Middleton, Inc. v. Minn.
Mining & Mfg. Co., 2004 WL 198669, at *3 (S.D.Iowa 2004) (granting motion to stay when
- 11 -

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 14

litigation had been ongoing for over eight years, discovery was completed and the trial date was
less than two months away).
3.

A stay will not unduly prejudice or present a clear tactical
disadvantage to Crocs.

The third factor examines whether a stay would unduly prejudice or present a clear
tactical disadvantage to the nonmoving party. Crocs’ ultimate recovery, should it prevail at the
USPTO and in Court, will not be affected by a stay. Crocs already has the injunctive relief it
seeks. Crocs is the beneficiary of an ITC injunctive exclusionary order and a cease and desist
order preventing Double Diamond, USA Dawgs, Effervescent and any other party from
importing the accused shoes into the United States.
In the unlikely event the USPTO does not cancel, or substantively change, the patents-insuit, Crocs’ sole remedy will be monetary damages for actions that are not ongoing. The
determination of these damages is independent of the length of the litigation.
This case has already been administratively closed for almost six years at Crocs' strategic
choice, since Crocs chose to pursue its claims in front of the International Trade Commission. At
the first notion of continued litigation in this matter, Double Diamond and USA Dawgs
diligently availed themselves of the option to seek reexamination of the patents-in-suit, and, by
this motion, Defendants are simply requesting that the Court exercise its discretion to stay the
pending litigation to enable the USPTO to complete its review of the ‘858 patent and the ‘789
patent, as Congress contemplated.
IV.

CONCLUSION
Reexamination will unquestionably narrow issues for trial, if not eliminate the need for

trial completely. USPTO’s reexamination will have a dramatic effect on the issues before the
- 12 -

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 118 Filed 08/31/12 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 14

Court, up to and including dismissal of the entire action if the patent claims are found to be
invalid, or presenting a strong presumption of validity for any remaining claim. Regardless of
whether claims are canceled, dismissed, amended or survive, the Court will benefit from the
PTO’s expertise and analysis.
Because of the strong likelihood of reexamination, and to avoid unnecessary, costly and
wasteful pretrial proceedings, Defendants respectfully request the Court grant this Motion to
Stay and administratively close the matter pending the finality of the inter partes reexamination.
Fusion Specialties, Inc. v. China Network Leader, Inc., 2012 WL 3289077 (D. Colo. 2012)
(granting motion to stay and administratively closing case pending reexamination);
D.C.COLO.LCivR 41.2 (“A district judge or a magistrate judge exercising consent jurisdiction
may direct the clerk to close a civil action administratively subject to reopening for good
cause.”).
