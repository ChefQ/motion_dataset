RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS
PENDING INTER PARTES REEXAMINATIONS
______________________________________________________________________________
Plaintiff Crocs, Inc. (“Crocs”) respectfully submits this Response to Defendants Double
Diamond Distribution, Ltd. (“Double Diamond”), U.S.A. Dawgs, Inc. (“USA Dawgs”) and
Effervescent, Inc.’s (“Effervescent”) Motion To Stay The Proceedings Pending Inter Partes
Reexaminations, (“Motion to Stay,” Dkt. #118) and in support thereof states the following:
I.

INTRODUCTION
At the eleventh hour, Defendants have sought an inter partes reexamination with the

objective of again stalling this case and delaying (if not avoiding) having to compensate Crocs
for selling footwear products that the Federal Circuit has determined infringe Crocs’s valid and
enforceable patents.

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 16

The United States Patent and Trademark Office’s (the “Patent Office”) track record
indicates that the process of reexamining Crocs’s patents may last for six years or more. This
means that if the Court were to enter a stay, there could be a 12-year delay between the time
Crocs filed this lawsuit and the Court’s adjudication of the merits. Such an outcome would
unquestionably result in substantial financial and evidentiary prejudice to Crocs and offer unfair
tactical advantages to Defendants. By the time the reexamination runs its course, the chances of
Crocs collecting any damages would likely be slim, as several of the Defendants could be
judgment proof by then. At the very least, Crocs would not be able to seek default judgments for
several years against Defendants no longer participating in this case. On top of this, once the
case was reopened, Crocs would have the burden of locating documents and witnesses (to the
extent possible) to support claims for injuries that occurred more than a decade before.
These hardships are not justified, particularly given that the Patent Office has already
issued a decision that Defendants’ request for a reexamination of claim 2 of Crocs’s utility patent
has no merit. Therefore, if nothing else, this case will go forward on the basis of Defendants’
infringement of claim 2, and entering a stay will not preserve judicial resources or the parties’
resources in any significant way. Entering a stay will also not meaningfully defray discovery
costs because the lion’s share of discovery has already been completed as part of the process
before the International Trade Commission (“ITC”). The limited remaining discovery relates to
Crocs’s damages, and will need to be conducted regardless of the outcome of the reexamination.
Furthermore, as reflected by the Patent Office’s decision to decline to review claim 2 of Crocs’s
utility patent, the merits of Defendants’ reexamination requests are suspect at best, so the
outcome of the review is unlikely to dramatically change the issues in this case. The fact that

2

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 16

Defendants waited more than six years to seek a reexamination raises further doubts about the
merits of their requests, and shows that Defendants’ real objective is simply to push off having to
compensate Crocs for their sales of infringing products.
On the whole, the harm to Crocs of entering a stay far outweighs any efficiencies that
may stem from awaiting the results of the reexaminations, and the Court should therefore deny
Defendants’ Motion to Stay.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Crocs initiated this lawsuit on April 6, 2006. On May 12, 2006, Defendants Holey Soles,

Effervescent, Collective Licensing International, LLC, and Gen-X Sports, Inc. moved the Court
to enter a stay pending the results of proceedings before the ITC relating to the patents-in-suit.1
(Dkt. #s 26, 27, 28). Pursuant to the mandatory stay requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1659(a), a stay
was granted during the pendency of the ITC proceedings, and the Court administratively closed
the case on May 16, 2006.
ITC proceedings generally are targeted to conclude within 16-18 months of the initiation
of an investigation. The duration of Crocs’s ITC investigation substantially exceeded the
average length of an ITC investigation, in part because Crocs appealed portions of an initial
determination from the ITC to the Federal Circuit. On July 15, 2011, following the opinion by
the Federal Circuit in Crocs, Inc. v. United States Int’l Trade Comm’n, 598 F.3d 1294, 1311
(Fed. Cir. 2010) upholding the validity of the patents-in-suit, the ITC issued a Final Commission
Determination of Violation, finding that Double Diamond, Effervescent, and Holey Soles had
1

Defendants falsely assert that the Court stayed the case at “Crocs [sic] request.” Motion to Stay
at 3.

3

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 16

violated 19 U.S.C. § 1337. Crocs then waited through both the required Presidential Review
period following the ITC decision and the time period during which a party could appeal the
determination following the review period, so that the matter would be “final” for purposes of
lifting the mandatory stay of this matter. Crocs then moved this Court to lift the stay.
On May 9, 2012, this Court granted Crocs’s Motion to Lift Stay and Transfer Record,
reactivating the case (Dkt. #75), and on August 6, 2012, this Court granted Crocs’s motion for
leave to file an amended complaint (Dkt. #103).
Double Diamond has been a party to this matter and the ITC Investigation since at least
May 30, 2006. See Double Diamond’s Entry of Appearance dated 5/30/06 in Proceedings of the
International Trade Commission Investigation No. 337-TA-567 submitted to this Court on 9/6/12
(Dkt. #122). But it was not until August 3, 2012 that Double Diamond filed a request for
reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 6,993,858 (“the ‘858 Patent”). Motion to Stay at 2. USA
Dawgs then requested a reexamination of U.S. Patent No. D 517,789 (“the ‘789 Patent”) on
August 24, 2012. Id. at 3.
Defendants moved this Court to stay these proceedings pending the reexaminations on
August 31, 2012, roughly six years and five months after Crocs filed its lawsuit. On September
14, 2012, the Patent Office declined to conduct a reexamination of claim 2 of the ‘858 Patent.
Decision On Request For Inter Partes Reexamination, attached as Exhibit 1. As of this date, so
far as Crocs knows, the Patent Office has not taken any action with respect to the ‘789 Patent.

ARGUMENT
Courts have broad discretion when considering whether or not to grant a stay pending

resolution of a reexamination proceeding. Broadcast Innovation, LLC v. Charter Comm., Inc.,
No. 03-cv-2223-ABJ-BNB, 2006 WL 1897165, at *4 (D. Colo. July 11, 2006). When
addressing a motion to stay pending a reexamination, courts consider the following factors: (1)
whether a stay will simplify the issues and streamline the trial; (2) whether discovery is complete
and a trial date set; (3) whether a stay would unduly prejudice the nonmoving party or present a
clear tactical advantage for the moving party; and (4) whether a stay will reduce the burden of
litigation on the parties and court. Edisync Systems, Inc. v. Centra Software, Inc., No. 03-cv1587-WYD-MEH, 2009 WL 3698520, at *2 (D. Colo. Nov. 6, 2009); see also eSoft, Inc. v. Blue
Coast Systems, Inc., 505 F. Supp. 2d 784, 787 (D. Colo. 2007) (noting that “[c]ourts frequently
collapse the first and fourth factors”). But these factors are not exclusive, and no one factor is
controlling; instead, courts look to the “totality of the circumstances” presented. See Broadcast
Innovation, LLC, 2006 WL 1897165, at *4. The inquiry is fact specific. See Nidec Corp. v. LG
Innotek Co., Ltd., No. 6:07cv108, 2009 WL 3673433, at *2 (E.D. Tex. April 3, 2009) (stating
that courts “weigh the enumerated factors on a case-by-case basis”).
This Court has observed that granting a motion to stay “is the norm in cases where a
reexamination proceeding is pending in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(“USPTO”).” Genetic Technologies Ltd. v. Agilent Technologies, Inc., No. 11–cv–01389–
WJM–KLM, 2011 WL 5024839, *4 (D. Colo. Oct. 20, 2011). However, a “court is under no
obligation to delay its own proceedings by yielding to ongoing PTO patent reexaminations,
regardless of their relevancy to infringement claims which the court must analyze. There is no

5

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 16

per se rule that patent cases should be stayed pending reexaminations, because such a rule
‘would invite parties to unilaterally derail’ litigation.” Largan Precision Co. Ltd v. Fujifilm
Corp., No. C 10-1318 SBA, 2011 WL 794983, at *2 (N.D. Cal. March 1, 2011) (internal citation
omitted); see also Bartex Research LLC v. FedEx Corp., 611 F. Supp. 2d 647, 650 (E.D. Texas
2009) (“[L]itigation and reexamination are not mutually exclusive alternatives for the parties to
test the validity of a patent − they may be concurrent proceedings.”).
A.

Entering a Stay Will Not Materially Lessen the Burdens of Litigation and Is
Unlikely to Simplify Issues for Trial

Given that the Patent Office has concluded that there is no reason to review claim 2 of the
‘858 Patent, Ex. 1, the outcome of the reexamination will not render this Court’s or the parties’
continued work futile. Even under an improbable “worst case” scenario for Crocs where the
Patent Office ultimately rejects the claim under consideration (claim 1 of the ‘858 Patent), this
case would still go forward on the basis of independent claim 2 of the ‘858 Patent. The resource
savings associated with a stay are therefore minimal, as the costs of trying this case on the basis
of claim 2 of the ‘858 Patent alone or on the basis of both claims of the ‘858 Patent and the ‘789
Patent would likely be similar. In circumstances like these where only some of the patent claims
at issue in a litigation are subject to reexamination, courts have found that entering a stay is
unlikely to lessen the burdens on the parties or the court. See Nat'l Products, Inc. v. GamberJohnson LLC, No. 2:12-CV-00840, 2012 WL 3527938, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 14, 2012)
(declining to grant a stay where the Patent Office had declined to review two of 35 patent claims,
and noting that the purpose of granting a stay was seriously undermined because the parties
would incur many of the same costs litigating the two claims not under review).

6

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 16

In addition, a stay offers little in the way of reducing discovery costs because much of the
necessary discovery has already been conducted as part of the ITC proceedings. Double
Diamond has recognized as much, stating that “discovery might be substantially abbreviated [in
this case] because of disclosures and discovery in the ITC matter.” Double Diamond’s Status
Report of 6/8/12 at ¶ 14 (Dkt. #86). The wide-ranging discovery conducted during the ITC
proceedings covered almost all of the issues conceivably relevant to this case, including
infringement, questions of validity like obviousness and anticipation, and allegations of
unenforceability and inequitable conduct. See Proceedings of the International Trade
Commission Investigation No. 337-TA-567 submitted to this Court on 9/6/12 (Dkt. #122). The
limited outstanding discovery mainly concerns Crocs’s damages and Defendants’ sales, and no
matter the outcome of the reexamination, this damages discovery will be needed, even if just to
address damages for infringement of claim 2 of the ‘858 Patent. Given that much of the
discovery is complete and what remains is independent of the reexamination, this factor favors
denying entry of a stay. See, e.g., TouchTunes Music Corp. v. Rowe Int'l Corp., 676 F. Supp. 2d
169, 177-78 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing Accent Designs, Inc. v. Jan Jewelry Designs, Inc., No. 92
Civ. 0482 (RWS), 1994 WL 121673, at *3 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 1994)) (noting that “district
courts commonly deny motions to stay pending patent reexamination in cases where substantial
proceedings, including discovery, have occurred”).
It is also unlikely that the results of the reexamination will meaningfully change the
issues for trial. Even a cursory review of Defendants’ reexamination requests calls into question
the likelihood that the Patent Office will ultimately require any amendment or rejection of
Crocs’s patents. Specifically, as noted in the Patent Office’s response to Defendants’

7

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 16

reexamination request, Exhibit 1, the only ground on which the Patent Office found a basis for
reexamination of claim 1 of the ‘858 Patent is the supposed combination of the “Softmoc” with a
strap from another reference (“Aguerre ‘249”). However, Double Diamond does not appear to
have submitted to the Patent Office the Federal Circuit’s decision in Crocs v. United States Int’l
Trade Comm’n, which expressly finds that a combination using the very same “Aguerre” strap
does not render claim 1 of the ‘858 patent obvious, because Aguerre in fact teaches away from
the claimed invention. 598 F.3d 1294, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Once the complete and accurate
record is before it, the Patent Office is likely to come to the same result as the Federal Circuit
and ultimately reject the same arguments that Double Diamond began making more than six
years ago.
Putting aside the specifics of Defendants’ reexamination requests, the simple fact that
Defendants waited six years to seek a reexamination confirms that the purpose of their requested
stay is purely tactical. See BarTex Research, LLC, 611 F. Supp. 2d at 652 (“The potential for use
of the reexamination process as a dilatory tactic must be considered. Thus, this Court is hesitant
to elevate this process—one that could take years—into a requisite procedure before a lawsuit
may move forward.”); Affinity Labs of Texas v. Apple Inc., No. 09-04436 CW, 2010 WL
1753206, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2010) (holding that delays associated with a reexamination
“must be considered in the context of the delay already present in this case” and that an
approximately one-year delay between the filing of the district court action and the request for a
stay, in addition to the delay of reexamination, “weigh[ed] heavily against granting the stay”).
Indeed, under new provisions of the American Invents Act, 35 U.S.C. § 299 et seq., implemented
in September 2012, Defendants’ last-minute reexamination request would be denied, as the

8

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 16

revised statute requires that petitions for inter partes review must be filed within one year of the
date of service of a complaint alleging infringement. See 35 U.S.C. § 315(b).
To support their Motion, Defendants offer little more than generalized arguments about
efficiency and cite statistics regarding how often the Patent Office modifies or cancels claims
during reexaminations. This falls well short of showing that a stay is justified. See Roy G. Biv.
Corp. v. Fanuc Ltd., No. 2:07-CV-418, 2009 WL 1080854, at *2 (E.D. Tex. April 14, 2009)
(“[T]he requesting party must do more than merely proffer oft-cited reexamination statistics and
generic judicial efficiency arguments.”). To begin with, the statistics Defendants cite essentially
have no bearing on the probable outcome of the reexamination of Crocs’s design patent (the ‘789
Patent). The statistics are meaningless with respect to Crocs’s design patent because only one
percent of the requests for inter partes reexaminations since November 1999 have addressed
design patents. See USPTO, Inter Partes Reexamination Filing Data, 1 (June 30, 2012),
http://www.uspto.gov/patents/stats//IP_quarterly_report_June_30_2012.pdf [hereinafter Inter
Partes Reexamination Filing Data ]. With such a small sample size, the predictive value of these
figures is negligible.
Even if the Patent Office were to confirm the claims of Crocs’s patents following its
review, Defendants maintain that a stay is appropriate because it would give the Court the benefit
of the Patent Office’s expert analysis. Motion to Stay at 10. Defendants fail to recognize that
this Court already has the benefit of the detailed reviews of the ITC and the Federal Circuit, each
of which has a wealth of experience addressing patents. In fact, this Court must take into
account the Federal Circuit’s decision relating to the patents-in-suit. See Texas Instruments, Inc.
v. Cypress Semiconductor Corp., 90 F.3d 1558, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that “[d]istrict

9

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 16

courts are not free to ignore holdings of this court that bear on cases before them”). In addition,
the value of the Patent Office’s technical expertise is less in this case, given that Crocs’s patents
are not overly technical or complex. The usefulness of input from the Patent Office on the
design patent is particularly limited, as the standard to be applied during any review is the
“ordinary observer test,” which does not require substantial technical expertise. See Prestige
Jewelry Int'l, Inc. v. BK Jewellery HK, No. 11 CIV. 2930 LBS, 2012 WL 1066798, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2012) (“[The] USPTO, while doubtlessly possessing great expertise—and
particularly so in very technical cases—can provide no additional special guidance in the instant
case [which involved a design patent]. The reason is clear. Under the ‘ordinary observer’ test
for invalidity, ‘the court compares the claim to the accused or allegedly anticipating article
[asking whether] their resemblance is deceptive to the extent that it would induce an ordinary
observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives, to purchase an article having one
design supposing it to be another.”) (internal citation omitted)).
For the foregoing reasons, a stay would offer few benefits with respect to streamlining
this case or reducing its burdens, and these factors therefore favor denying a stay.
B.

Only Limited, Discrete Discovery Remains to be Taken

Defendants quickly dispense with the second factor courts consider when evaluating
requests for stays, which addresses how far the litigation has advanced, with a simple assertion
that no discovery has been taken and no schedule or trial date has been set. Motion to Stay at 11.
This cursory review overlooks the proceedings before the ITC, which form a critical part of this
matter. When considering whether to grant a stay in cases where the dispute between the parties
involves other proceedings beyond the case at bar, courts have considered the dispute as a whole,

10

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 11 of 16

rather than looking narrowly at only one aspect of the conflict. See Power Integrations Inc. v.
Fairchild Semiconductor Intern. Inc., No. 08-309-JJF-LPS, 2008 WL 5335400, at *2 (D. Del.
Dec. 19, 2008) (denying a stay where the parties had litigated a similar matter for approximately
four years, and noting that “[w]hile discovery in the instant case is at its earliest stages, in the
other case discovery has been completed, and it seems likely that much of that discovery will be
useful here (perhaps reducing the need for extensive discovery)”); Robbins v. H.H. Brown Shoe
Co., Inc., No. 08 CIV. 6885 (WHP), 2009 WL 2170174, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2009)
(denying a stay in part based on the consideration that the parties had litigated a number of issues
in parallel litigation).
Accounting for the ITC proceedings makes it apparent that this dispute is actually far
from just beginning. As explained above, the ITC record eliminates the need for substantial
additional discovery, as volumes of documents and testimony relevant to most of the key issues
in the case are already available to the parties. Therefore, despite the fact that the Court only
reopened the matter in June, the overall dispute between the parties in many respects has
advanced beyond its preliminary stages, and this factor therefore weighs against entering a stay.
C.

Staying the Case Will Likely Foreclose Crocs from Collecting Damages and Will
Result in Substantial Evidentiary Prejudice to Crocs

The last factor courts consider when confronted with a request for a stay looks at whether
the nonmoving party would be unduly prejudiced or whether the stay presents a tactical
advantage to the moving party. Both of those concerns apply here. Entering a stay at this
juncture in the case would undermine a principal purpose of reopening this case − collecting
damages for Defendants’ willful infringement − and would provide unfair strategic advantages to
Defendants. By statute, the Patent Office is supposed to conduct reexaminations with “special

11

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 16

dispatch,” 35 U.S.C. § 305, but the truth is that the reexamination process drags on for many
years. The current average pendency of an inter partes reexamination from the time of filing
until the Patent Office enters a certificate with its decision is slightly more than three years. See
Inter Partes Reexamination Filing Data. The appellate process for reexaminations can extend
the total duration of the proceedings to more than six years. ESN, LLC v. Cisco Sys. Inc., No.
5:08-CV-20, 2008 WL 6722763, at * 2-3 (E.D. Texas Nov. 20, 2008) (citing Roger Shang & Yar
Chaikovsky, Inter partes Reexamination of Patents: An Empirical Evaluation, 15 Tex. Intell.
Prop. L.J. 1, 16 (2006)). Accordingly, should the Court grant Defendants’ request for a stay,
Crocs would likely be unable to obtain any type of monetary relief until 2018 − approximately
12 years after it first filed suit. See Nat'l Products, Inc., 2012 WL 3527938, at *1 (noting that
“[s]everal courts have cited the long delays as a factor that weighed heavily in their decisions to
reject motions to stay”).
The financial prejudice to Crocs from such a delay would be enormous. The stay would
likely prevent Crocs from obtaining its damages, which were not and could not be awarded in the
ITC proceedings, for half a dozen years or more. And by that point, Crocs may not be able to
collect any damages whatsoever, as the long-term viability of the Defendants is questionable.
See Telemac Corp. v. Teledigital, Inc., 450 F. Supp. 2d 1107, 1111 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (denying a
stay where defendants failed to respond to plaintiff’s “most compelling showing of prejudice: as
demonstrated by Defendants’ responses to [plaintiff’s] interrogatories, [defendants] may lack the
resources to compensate [plaintiff] in the event of a finding of infringement”).
Based on its experience with the Defendants in this case and in the proceedings before
the ITC, Crocs has reason to believe that by the time the reexamination is done, many, if not all,

12

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 16

of the Defendants may be judgment proof. Take Defendant Holey Soles. It sold more than one
hundred thousand pairs of infringing footwear prior to Crocs’s initiation of this case, but has
since sought shelter in bankruptcy proceedings in Canada, Transcript of Scheduling Conference
of 9/6/12 at 2:18-20, which greatly compromises Crocs’s ability to collect any damages.
Defendant Effervescent appears to be on the same track. Counsel for Effervescent has
acknowledged that he will withdraw from his representation if the Court denies the Motion to
Stay, Transcript of Scheduling Conference of 9/6/12 at 13:1-5, and there is no indication that
Effervescent will obtain substitute counsel. It appears therefore that Effervescent intends to hide
behind the stay in order to delay entry of any default. This is the exact type of gamesmanship
that Courts have warned against. See BarTex Research, 611 F. Supp. 2d at 652. Double
Diamond has taken a different approach, electing to spin off a new company, Defendant USA
Dawgs, to handle infringing sales in the United States, see Response and Objection By Double
Diamond Distribution, Ltd. to Crocs’s Motion to Amend at 2 n.2, 5 (Dkt. #97) (acknowledging
common ownership between the companies and the formation of USA Dawgs shortly after this
case was stayed pending the ITC proceedings), and now maintains incorrectly that it is not
subject to this Court’s jurisdiction, see Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction and
Improper Venue (Dkt. #113).
A stay would also result in substantial evidentiary prejudice to Crocs. Many of the events
at issue in this case are now more than six years old, so there may already be challenges with
respect to locating documents and obtaining witness testimony relating to Crocs’s damages. A
stay would compound these difficulties. If a stay were to delay resolution of this case for another
six years, it could ultimately be impossible to track down documents and witnesses to address

13

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 14 of 16

sales of products that occurred more than a decade before. See BarTex Research, LLC, 611 F.
Supp. 2d at 651-52 (finding that delay during reexamination may result in “loss of critical
evidence”).
In the end, “[t]he principle that justice delayed is justice denied applies with full force” to
the case. ESN, LLC, 2008 WL 6722763, at * 3 (quoting Perspectives on Patents: Post-Grant
Review Procedures and Other Litigation Reforms Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary
Subcomm. on Intell. Prop., 109th Cong. (2006) (statement of Mr. Mark Chandler, Senior Vice
President and General Counsel, Cisco Systems, Inc.).
IV.

CONCLUSION
While granting a stay pending a patent reexamination may be appropriate in some

situations, that is not the case here. Under these circumstances, a stay would likely have the
effect of allowing some or all of the Defendants to entirely escape having to pay damages for the
sale of footwear that the Federal Circuit has held infringe Crocs’s patent rights. If nothing else,
a stay would allow some Defendants to dodge default judgments, and would result in a
potentially decade-long delay in this Court’s consideration of the merits. By that time, Crocs
would have to use documents and testimony (to the extent they were still even available)
concerning incidents that occurred more than ten years before to prove its damages.
Defendants are seeking a stay because they recognize these tactical advantages and the
associated hardships on Crocs. But they have not demonstrated that a stay is warranted. Generic
arguments about improving efficiency and oft-cited statistics on the results of reexaminations do
not outweigh the clear prejudice to Crocs, particularly when the Patent Office has already denied

14

Case 1:06-cv-00605-PAB-KMT Document 127 Filed 09/21/12 USDC Colorado Page 15 of 16

one of Defendants’ reexamination requests. Crocs therefore respectfully asks that this Court
deny Defendants’ Motion to Stay so that this six-year-old case can proceed to the merits.
