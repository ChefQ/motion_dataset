Case No. 4-04 CV0000985-BRW

DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
STRIKE GOVERNMENT’S “STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT
AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO GENUINE ISSUE” FILED WITH
OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendants Accenture LLP, Accenture Ltd, and Proquire LLC respectfully file this
Memorandum in support of their Motion to Strike Government’s “Statement of Material Fact as
to Which There Is No Genuine Issue” Filed With Opposition to Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment.
The Local Rules of this Court are very precise in setting forth what is required in moving
for and opposing summary judgment. The moving party is required to accompany its motion for
summary judgment with a “separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to
which it contends there is no genuine issue to be tried.” Local Rule 56.1(a). “If the non-moving
party opposes the motion, it shall file, in addition to any response and brief, a separate, short and
concise statement of the material facts as to which it contends a genuine issue exists to be
tried.” Local Rule 56.1(b) (emphasis added).

The procedure established by Local Rule 56.1 is not merely a formal nicety; it goes to the
very heart of the Court’s determination as to whether the summary judgment standard has been
met:
Local Rule 56.1 requires a party moving for summary judgment to “annex to the
notice of motion a separate, short and concise statement of the material facts as to
which it contends there is no genuine issue to be tried.” Those facts are deemed
admitted unless controverted by the non-moving party. The purpose of the Rule is
to establish a baseline of facts which both parties can agree to, so that the Court
will have a factual starting point from which to work when reviewing the motion.
This mechanism helps the Court determine those facts on which the parties agreeand those on which they do not agree. Obviously, facts agreed upon are not in
dispute and do not have to be supported by affidavit or other evidence. It is only
for those material facts concerning which there is a dispute that supportive
evidence is required. Thus, when a material fact is not agreed upon and the
moving party puts forth evidence to support his contention with respect to it, the
non-moving party is obliged to respond with contrary evidence if any he has.
Duvall v. City of Rogers, Ark., 2005 WL 3784932, at *1 (W.D. Ark. Dec. 20, 2005)
Defendants filed, along with their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, a Statement of
Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute (Doc. #448 (sealed)), in compliance
with the Local Rules. The Government did not accompany their Opposition with a separate
statement of the material facts as to which it contends a genuine issue exists to be tried, as
required by the Local Rules. Instead, the Government filed a document titled “Statement of
Material Fact as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue.” The Government’s document does not
set forth material facts as to which the Government contends a genuine issue exists to be tried, as
required by the Local Rules. Rather, the Government’s document is filled with assertions that
are not material to the narrow legal issues that are the subject of the present motion for partial
summary judgment. Indeed, some of the Government’s asserted “facts” are not even facts at all,
they are legal conclusions, such as “The Anti-Kickback Act applies to AAFES. See 41 U.S.C. §
52(1)” and “The False Claims Act applies to AAFES. See S. REP. 99-345 P.L. 99-563, FALSE

Statement of Material Fact as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue ¶¶ 28, 29.
In short, the Government’s “Statement of Material Fact as to Which There Is No Genuine
Issue” does not comply with the letter or spirit of Local Rule 56.1. The appropriate remedy for
the Government’s failure to comply with Local Rule 56.1 is to strike the Government’s
Statement.
For the for the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Government’s
Statement of Material Fact as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue, be stricken.
