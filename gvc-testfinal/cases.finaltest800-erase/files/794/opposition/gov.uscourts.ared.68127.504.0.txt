Civil Action 4:04-CV-00985 BRW

UNITED STATES' OPPOSITION TO ACCENTURE’S MOTION TO STRIKE
GOVERNMENT’S STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT AS TO WHICH THERE IS
NO GENUINE ISSUE FILED IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PARTIAL
SUMMARY JUDGMENT

The United States, through its undersigned counsel, submits this Opposition to
Accenture’s Motion to Strike Government’s “Statement of Material Facts As to Which There is
No Genuine Issue Filed in Opposition To Motion For Partial Summary Judgment (Accenture
Motion). The Pleading that Defendants seek to strike complies with both the Local Rules of this
Court as well as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Accenture’s Motion should be denied.
Brief Background
On February 18, 2011, Accenture filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on two
“issues”: (1) because the Truth in Negotiations Act (“TINA”) purportedly “does not apply” here,
Defendants assert that they cannot have violated TINA, and thus no alleged False Claims Act
1

Filed 04/25/11 Page 2 of 5

(“FCA”) violation can be predicated on an alleged TINA violation in this case; and (2) because
the law prohibiting contingent fees in certain circumstances purportedly “does not apply here,”
Defendants assert they cannot have violated this law, and thus no alleged FCA violation can be
predicated on an alleged violation of this law in this case. On March 21, 2011, the United States
filed a timely Opposition, setting forth why Accenture’s effort to excuse its fraudulent behavior
by eliminating legal requirements that it was subject to is wrong on both counts. As set forth in
the United States’ Opposition, both of these legal requirements were “applicable” to Accenture
and its activities on federal contracts. The Opposition of the United States was supported by a
Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Issue, likewise filed on March 21, 2011
(United States’ Statement of Material Facts). The United States’ Statement of Material Facts
tracks the sections of Accenture’s Statement of Material Facts that it filed in support of its
motion for partial summary judgment. The United States’ Statement of Material Facts serves
two purposes: 1) it sets forth facts challenging the accuracy of some of Accenture’s “factual”
statements made in support of its motion1; and 2) it sets forth additional undisputed facts -ignored by Accenture in its motion -- demonstrating why the relief requested by Accenture in its
motion for partial summary judgment is inappropriate. This is the precise purpose of an
opposing statement of facts: to demonstrate that there are indeed supported facts warranting the
denial of the relief requested by the moving party under Rule 56. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 (e)(2).2
ARGUMENT
1

For example, paragraph 6 of the United States’ Statement of Material Facts challenges the accuracy of a statement
of fact Accenture claimed to be undisputed.
2
The fact that many of the statements set forth in the United States’ Statement of Material Facts are undisputed and
thus do not create an issue for trial does not mean that they cannot be used to counter Accenture’s requested relief.
In fact, as set forth in the United States’ Opposition to Accenture’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the
United States does not dispute many of the facts asserted by Accenture. However, the relief requested by Accenture
with respect to those facts is opposed. Furthermore, Accenture’s decision to omit a number of undisputed facts from
its motion and statement of facts does not mean that those facts cannot be considered by the Court in determining
whether to deny Accenture’s prayer for relief.

Accenture seeks to strike the factual support relied upon by the United States to support
its Opposition to Accenture’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment because it claims the
Statement of Facts did not comply with Local Rule 56.1.
The dismissal of a party's pleading, however, should be imposed as a sanction only in
“exceptional cases because in our justice system, the opportunity to be heard is a litigant's most
precious right and should be sparingly denied.” Allen v. Tobacco Superstore, Inc., 475 F.3d 931,
936 (8th Cir. 2007) (quoting Chrysler Corp. v. Carey, 186 F.3d 1016, 1020 (8th Cir. 1999)
(internal quotation omitted)). Such a draconian sanction must be reserved for situations where a
party exhibits “blatant disregard of the Court's orders and the discovery rules,” or “[engages] in a
pattern of deceit by presenting false and misleading answers and testimony under oath in order to
prevent their opponent from fairly presenting its case.” Carey, 186 F.3d at 1022. In addition,
“there is a strong policy in favor of deciding a case on its merits, and against depriving a party of
his day in court.” Id. at 1020.
Here, there is absolutely no support for such a sanction with respect to the United States’
Statement of Material Facts. At best, Accenture has pointed out that perhaps the United States
could have named its pleading better. But a failure to use the right nomenclature in titling a
pleading does not justify striking its content. The substance of the Statement of Material Facts
does exactly what it is supposed to do: 1) challenges, with support, some of the factual assertions
made by Accenture and claimed to be undisputed; and 2) sets forth additional facts, with support,
that assist in demonstrating that Accenture is not entitled to the requested relief.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Accenture’s Motion to Strike should be denied. The
United States’ Statement of Material Facts is proper and supports its Opposition to Accenture’s
