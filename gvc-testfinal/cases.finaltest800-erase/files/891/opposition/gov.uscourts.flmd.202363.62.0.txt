CASE NO.: 8:07-CV-1081-ORL-28UAM

ROBERT J. OROVITZ, P.A.;
ROBERT J. OROVITZ; JASON
DRAGUTSKY; and ERIK KARDATZKE,
Defendants.
_____________________________/
MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 11
Plaintiff Tracy Hinds hereby files this Memorandum in
Opposition to Motion for Sanctions filed herein by defendants
Robert J. Orovitz, P.A.; Robert J. Orovitz; Jason Dragutsky;
and Erik Kardatzke (collectively "the defendants") pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, and states that the motion for sanctions
should be denied outright because it reveals no legitimate
basis for assessing such sanctions as pled. Rather, the motion
for sanctions appears to be a pleading ploy designed to
utilize Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 as a weapon to attempt to intimidate
and harass, intending to discourage the bringing of consumer
protection actions against these defendants in the future.
Such a ploy is a misuse of Rule 11, and bringing such a
motion under the Rule is itself sanctionable. Fed.R.Civ.P.
11(c)(1)(A) ("If warranted, the court may award to the party
prevailing on the motion to reasonable expenses and attorney's

fees incurred in...opposing the motion.") For the Court to
award fees against the movant under Rule 11, no cross-motion
is necessary. Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, Advisory Committee Notes to
1993 Amendments, Subdivisions (b) and (c).
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff adopts and incorporates herein the background
information contained in her memorandum in opposition to
defendants' motion for fees under 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(a)(3) and
28 U.S.C. § 1927, filed on the same day as this memorandum.
The defendants have filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions
premised upon the argument that “the complaint filed...should
be deemed and considered frivolous, unreasonable, vexatious,
and brought in bad faith and solely for the purpose of
harassment.” (Dkt. 58.) The motion specifically relies upon
the same arguments as are made in the defendants’ motion for
award of fees under 15 U.S.C. § 1692k(a)(3) and 28 U.S.C. §
1927. This Rule 11 motion was filed with the Court
electronically on May 30, 2008, and does not comply with
Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c)(1)(A).
II. STANDARD FOR IMPOSING RULE 11 SANCTIONS
"Rule 11 sanctions are designed to 'discourage dilatory
or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation
process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses,'" Donaldson
v. Clark, 819 F.2d 1551, 1556 (11th Cir. 1987) (en banc)
Page 2 of

(quoting Pin v. Texaco, Inc., 793 F.2d 1448, 1455 (5th
Cir.1986)).
The Eleventh Circuit has enunciated the standard under
which Rule 11 sanctions may be imposed, as follows: "[T]hree
types of conduct warrant the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions:
(1) When a party files a pleading that has no reasonable
factual basis; (2) When the party files a pleading that is
based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of
success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument
to change existing law; and (3) When the party files a
pleading in bad faith for an improper purpose." [Citations
omitted] Pelletier v. Zweifel, 921 F.2d 1465, 1514 (11th Cir.
1991).
"Although sanctions are warranted when the claimant
exhibits a 'deliberate indifference to obvious facts,' they
are not warranted when the claimant's evidence is merely weak
but appears sufficient, after a reasonable inquiry, to support
a claim under existing law. Sanctions may be appropriate when
the plain language of an applicable statute and the case law
preclude relief, however, the purpose of Rule 11 is to deter
frivolous lawsuits and not to deter novel legal arguments or
cases of first impression." Baker v. Alderman, 158 F.3d 516
(11th Cir. 1998).
In order to assess Rule 11 sanctions, "this Court would
have to find that Plaintiff(s) allegations are false, that he

11

knew that his legal argument would obviously fail, or that he
pled his actions with apparent bad faith." Gelles v. Skrotsky,
15 F.Supp.2d 1293 (M.D. Fla. 1998). In addition, the Court
"reserves such sanctions for deliberate, frivolous, and wanton
causes of action---not merely actions dismissed upon motion."
Id. at 1297.
"The objective standard for assessing conduct under Rule
11 is 'reasonableness under the circumstances' and 'what [it]
was reasonable to believe at the time" the pleading was
submitted. Baker v. Alderman, 158 F.3d 516, 524 (11th Cir.
1998). Sanctions are warranted when a party exhibits a
'deliberate indifference to obvious facts,' but not when the
party's evidence to support a claim is 'merely weak'. Id."
Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., 307 F.3d 1277, 1294 (11th
Cir., 2002).
III: ARGUMENT
A. THE MOTION FOR SANCTIONS SHOULD BE DENIED AS BEING
WITHOUT BASIS.
As noted above, the 11th Circuit has ruled that sanctions
may be imposed only in three circumstances, i.e. where
pleadings have (1) "no reasonable factual basis," or (2) are
"based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of
success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument
to change existing law," or (3) "filing a pleading in bad
faith for an improper purpose." Pelletier, 921 F.2d at 1465.

None of those facts exist in the instant case. Nor is there
any controlling legal precedent on the issue presented in the
11th Circuit.
In fact, reference to the Court's Order of April 29, 2008
dismissing the action is instructive: In the Order this Court
cited six cases as foundation for its dismissal of the action
based upon statute of limitation grounds, and referenced a
single 11th Circuit case not directly on point. Four of the
six cases were decided after this action was filed. If the
Rule 11 motion by the defendants is itself filed in good
faith, and with reasonable grounds, it would be logical to
assume similar motions would be filed in each of the Court’s
four cases cited which were decided after this case was
brought. However, as noted in the memorandum filed by
plaintiff of even date herewith, no such motions were filed in
three out of the four, and the single motion for fees that was
filed was denied.
In sum, the issue in this case was whether refusal to
listen to a consumer with regard to being sued on a timebarred, bogus debt was a “continuing violation” until resolved
in the state court action. The authorities cited by the Court
in its order dismissing the case indicate that the issue was
one in considerable disputed ferment when this action was
filed. That being the case, it is difficult to discern how the
filing of such an action, and asserting such a position on

behalf of a client, was a situation where “Plaintiff(s)
allegations are false...[she] knew that [her] legal argument
would obviously fail, or that [she] pled [her] actions with
apparent bad faith." Gelles v. Skrotsky, 15 F.Supp.2d 1293
(M.D. Fla. 1998).
On the contrary, the plaintiff would request that the
Court consider imposing counter-sanctions on the defendants in
this action, for the reasons that follow.
B. SANCTIONS SHOULD BE AWARDED AGAINST THE MOVANTS.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c)(1)(A) provides that, "if warranted,
the Court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the
reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting
or opposing the motion." The Advisory Committee notes from the
1993 amendments provide inter alia that "service of a cross
motion under Rule 11 should rarely be needed since under the
revision the Court may award to the person who prevails on a
motion under Rule 11---whether the movant or the target of the
motion---reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion."
The motion for sanctions in this instance appears to be
based upon the notion that "the best defense is a good
offense." To misuse Rule 11 in this way is tempting for some
parties, but it wastes this Court's valuable time and
resources. Where Rule 11 motions are used to "abuse official
processes with baseless filings in order to harass," the
Page 6 of

movant may be sanctioned. Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., 307
F.3d at 1298.
It must also be noted that defendant Robert J. Orovitz,
P.A., doing business as “Hayt, Hayt & Landau” is an
unrepentant

serial violator of both the FDCPA and the FCCPA,

and is regularly sued under both statutes. Similarly, the
other defendants in this action, including Jason Dragutsky
(“Dragutsky”), Erik Kardatzke (“Kardatzke”) and Robert J.
Orovitz himself (“Orovitz”) are either current or past
defendants in consumer protection actions.
Only a short, cursory search for consumer protection
suits against the defendants finds the following (and the
plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of each
public record Exhibit provided); upon information and belief,
more would be revealed upon further search or discovery:
A. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A., Orovitz, and “unknown
partners of Hayt, Hayt & Landau” were sued in 2000 in the case
of

of Delva v. Orovitz, etc. et al. under both the FDCPA and

the FCCPA (a copy of the case summary and complaint being
attached as Composite Exhibit “A”).
B. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A. was sued in the Southern
District of Florida in 2005 in the case of Valdes v. Robert J.
Orovitz, P.A., etc. et al.

for violations of the FDCPA and

FCCPA (a copy of the case summary and complaint being attached
as Composite Exhibit “B”).

C. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A. was sued in 2007 in the
case of

of Drossin v. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A. under the FDCPA

(a copy of the case summary and complaint being attached as
Composite Exhibit “C”). the P.A.
D. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A. was sued in 2007 in the
case of

of Pescartrice v. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A. and Jason

Dragutsky under both the FDCPA and the FCCPA (a copy of the
case summary and complaint being attached as Composite Exhibit
“D”).
E. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A., Orovitz, Dragutsky, and
Kardatzke were sued in 2007 in the case of

of Redondo v.

Orovitz, etc. et al. under the FDCPA (a copy of the case
summary and complaint being attached as Composite Exhibit
“E”).
F. Robert J. Orovitz, P.A. and Orovitz are being
sued in 2008 in the case of

of Gordon v. Robert J. Orovitz,

P.A., et al. under both the FDCPA and the FCCPA (a copy of the
case summary and complaint being attached as Composite Exhibit
“F”).
Normally the fact that the defendants herein are serial
violators of federal and state consumer protection actions
would be of little import in deciding whether to issue Rule 11
sanctions against an unsuccessful plaintiff. However, these
facts become important when the important Congressional
policies and the foundation of the FDCPA and other consumer
Page 8 of

11

Case 6:07-cv-01081-JA-GJK

Document 62

Page 9 of 11

protection statutes are taken into consideration. The text of
the FDCPA itself includes the following words of Congress:
"There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive,
and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors.
Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of
personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of
jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy." 15 U.S.C. §
1692(a). "It is the purpose of this title to eliminate abusive
debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that
those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt
collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and
to promote consistent State action to protect consumers
against debt collection abuses." 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e).
Consumer protection statutes such as the FDCPA are
"remedial in nature and therefore must be construed liberally
in order to best serve Congress' intent." Ellis v. General
Motors Acceptance Corporation, 160 F.3d 703 (11th Cir. 1998).
“[B]y providing for statutory damages and attorneys fees for
successful plaintiffs, the FDCPA permits and encourages
parties who have suffered no loss to bring civil actions for
statutory violations....In this way, the FDCPA enlists the
efforts of sophisticated consumers like Jacobson as ‘private
attorneys general’ to aid their less sophisticated
counterparts, who are unlikely themselves to bring suit under
the Act, but who are assumed by the Act to benefit from the
Page 9 of

deterrent effect of civil actions brought by others." Jacobson
v. Healthcare Financial Services, Inc., 2008 WL 383060 **15-16
(2d Cir. 2/14/08).
"Unlike most private tort litigants, [a plaintiff who
brings an FDCPA action] seeks to vindicate important ***
rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms', City
of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561...(1986), and Congress
has determined that the public as a whole has an interest in
the vindication of the statutory rights." Graziano v.
Harrison, 950 F.2d 107, 113 (3rd Cir. 1991).
The use of groundless Rule 11 motions for sanctions serve
to discourage consumers from being remedial actions under the
FDCPA and FCCPA. That is why this motion has been filed. If
serial violators of consumer protection statutes are allowed
to utilize Rule 11 to harass and abuse wronged consumers--which is undeniably the case here---by filing such motions for
sanctions, then the very foundations and purposes of consumer
protection statutes will be undermined and traduced. This
should not be allowed to occur. The use of Rule 11 motions as
mere “weapons of counterattack” must be discouraged.
Plaintiff maintains that one such instance of such abuse
and misuse by undisputed wrongdoers under the FDCPA is
currently before this Court.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the above reasons as stated in this Memorandum of
Page 10 of

Law, the motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 should be
denied. Further, the movants should be sanctioned for filing
the motion in bad faith, for improper purposes, to harass the
plaintiff, and to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase
in the cost of this litigation.
