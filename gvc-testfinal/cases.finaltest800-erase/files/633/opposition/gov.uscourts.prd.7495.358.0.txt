moneys owed from the use of the GENESIS and on that same date a cross-claim was filed

could not license GENESIS to Banco Popular and as such have infringed their rights through
unauthorized transactions with the song. Exhibit 5 [ Answer to the Complaint ¶ 4-6.]
Answer: Admitted.

12- In Venegas- Hernandez v. Peer, the Court held that at the time that BPPR used Genesis in the

the fees for performance that the 1993 Christmas Special was played in the Banco Popular
branches. Exhibit 6 [Deposition of R. Viera p. 135 and 136]
Answer: It is admitted that the 1993 Christmas Special was played in the Banco Popular
branches. However, no time frame is provided for such performance.

17- Raul Bernard, president of LAMCO and ACEMLA states that if the Christmas Special Un
Pueblo Que Canta is played in the branches that would be a performance and that is the reason

Answer: Admitted. However, no time frame is provided for any such performance.

18 - He also states that the 6 songs mentioned in the September 2, 1998 letter would be the songs
that were actionable because he knew more or less that they may have been used by Banco

137-138]
Answer: Admitted. However, no time frame is provided for the performance of those videos.

the same time she understood that the performance license referred to the showing in Banco
Popular branches of the Christmas Specials. Exhibit 8 [deposition of Paulette Lavergne , May 27,
