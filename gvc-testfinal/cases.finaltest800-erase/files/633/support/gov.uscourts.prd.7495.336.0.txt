GUILLERMO VENEGAS LLOVERAS INC. MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGEMENT

TO THE HONORABLE COURT
COMES NOW, Guillermo Venegas Lloveras, Inc.( GVLI) , by and through
the undersigned counsel and respectfully moves this Court for an order granting
summary judgments against counter defendant Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
(“ Banco Popular” ) and cross claim defendants LAMCO and ACEMLA
(“ LAMCO/ACEMLA” ) by issuing an order that Banco Popular actually used the
song GENESIS in performance during the original copyright term causing a
copyright infringement and that LAMCO/ ACEMLA authorized the performance
of GENESIS during the original copyright term which belonged to GVLI and for
such other and further relief that this Court deems just and proper.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Banco Popular, a licensee of LAMCO/ACEMLA and PEER, 1 filed an action of

Although GVLI also cross claimed PEER it is not a party for purposes of this summary judgment.

declaratory judgment to determine the true owners of copyrighted works which it had
licensed. On June 26, 2001, GVLI counter-claimed for the amounts of money from the
use of the song Genesis. In addition GVLI also cross-claimed against LAMCO/ACEMLA
and PEER on the grounds that they knew or had reasons to know they could not
license GENESIS to Banco Popular yet they carried out unauthorized transactions with
the song causing significant economic damages. See GVLI Statement of Uncontested
Material Facts (“ SUMF”) ¶ 11.

Sometime in 1996, LAMCO and its performance licensing entity ACEMLA represented
to Banco Popular that owned the rights to , inter alia, the musical work GENESIS which
was used in the 1993 Christmas Music Special.SUMF ¶ 4
Banco Popular started in 1993 producing an annual Christmas Music Special which
was broadcasted in the major television and radio stations in Puerto Rico and also
transmitted throughout the bank’s branches. SUMF ¶ 1. In addition Banco popular
distributes the Christmas Music Specials in phonograph records and videocassettes.
SUMF ¶ 2.

In their amended answer to the Banco Popular Complaint LAMCO and ACEMLA not
only admitted as true that fact but also stated that the United States branches of Banco
Popular also broadcast the Banco Popular Christmas Specials. SUMF ¶ 3.

In 1993 the Christmas Music Special for 1993 – Un Pueblo Que Canta- was performed
and it included the musical work GENESIS.SUMF ¶ 5.

By August of 1997 ACEMLA/LAMCO had made a claim to Banco Popular to settle

issues of copyright infringement in the use of series of songs. Because of certain
pending legal issues Banco Popular deferred any further discussion of the claim.SUMF
¶ 6.

On September 2, 1998, LAMCO and ACEMLA confirm the terms they would accept and
agree to grant retroactive licenses and compromise their demands with Banco Popular
with regards to copyright royalties corresponding to phonomechanical, video
mechanical and synchronization rights for a series of musical work they alleged they
owned. Among these was GENESIS. The letter also referred to Fee for Performance
license for any work under the ACEMLA Catalog comprised in the production of “Un
Pueblo Que Canta “ (1993) , “Espiritu de Un Pueblo”(1994) and “ Somos Un Solo
Pueblo” for the years from 1993 to 1998, both included. The total of Royalties for
Performance (including simple interest at 6% was $260,432. SUMF ¶ 7. This
Settlement Offer was accepted by Banco Popular on November 6, 1998.SUMF ¶ 8

During GVLI took action against both LAMCO and ACEMLA and PEER among other
Defendants. As a result in 2004 the U S District Court in Venegas- Hernandez v. Peer,
et al decided that GVLI and the Venegas siblings were the owners of GENESIS at the
time of the 1993 Christmas Special and that any profits from the BPPR license prior to
the renewal term belonged to them. In addition, the Court held that renewal period
would start in January 1, 1998. SUMF ¶ 12 and 13.
The Court also held that if no direct evidence of Banco Popular’s direct use of GENESIS
being played in the branches of Banco Popular, that is being performed is presented
then the mere authorization of a performance license would not be evidence of actual
infringement. SUMF 14.

In the instant case, the Court sustained a petition for partial dismissal of GVLI
counterclaim on the grounds of issue preclusion. The issue presented here as to the
ownership of GENESIS has been subject of a valid and binding judgment and the
damages that were awarded in Venegas –Hernandez v Peer would constitute the
damages for the licensing in this case. However the Court also held that the issue of the
performance license and the actual usage or performance of the song had not been
litigated. SUMF ¶ 15.

BANCO POPULAR ACTUALLY USED THE PERFORMANCE LICENSE
In Venegas-Hernandez the district Court found that there was insufficient evidence of
performance. Even when ACEMLA granted the retroactive performance license it was
insufficient to infer that Banco Popular performed GENESIS.
In the present case the situation is different. There is an explicit statement in the
Pleadings that the Christmas Music Specials were broadcasted in the Banco Popular
branches In particular it is stated as a fact in the Complaint. SUMF ¶ 1. This fact is not
disputed by LAMCO and ACEMLA. On the contrary they even aver that the Christmas
Specials are broadcasted in Banco Popular Branches in the United States. SUMF ¶ 3.
Other evidentiary support of the performance of the song GENESIS is provided in the
Testimony of Richie Viera , a consultant and Banco Popular representative in the
Settlement negotiations . He testifies that the 1993 Christmas Special was played in the
Banco Popular branches. SUMF ¶ 17.
Performance is simply having the corresponding Christmas Special played in a Banco
Popular branch. In this case, it would the playing the 1993 “ Un Pueblo Que Canta “
any time after it was produced and broadcasted in television and radio in December
1993.

Raul Bernard, president of LAMCO and ACEMLA in his deposition testified that the
reason that Banco Popular would pay a performance fee is to be able to play the
Christmas Specials in the branches. SUMF ¶ 17.
He also testified that the six ongs mentioned in the September 2, 1998 letter would be
songs that were actionable because he knew nore or less that they may have been
used by Banco Popular. SUMF ¶ 18
Legal counsel for Banco Popular Paulette Lavergne also testified that there would not
be a possibility that the bank would have paid for the performance of songs that were
not mentioned in the September 2, 1998 letter. SUMF ¶ 19. This makes it clear that it
was the Banco Popular’s intent when they paid for performance to show the songs in
the branches through the showing of the Christmas Music Specials. SUMF 19.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
“Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material
fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file and any
affidavits.” Thompson v Coca-Cola Co., 522F3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2008) citing Fed R.
Civ. P. 56(c ). The issue is genuine if it can be resolved in favor of either party. CaleroCerezo v. U.S. Department of Justice, 355 F. 3d 6, 19 ( 1st Cir. 2004). A fact is material
if it has the potential to change the outcome of the suit under governing law. Anderson
v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 24, 248 (1986). The party moving for summary judgment
bears the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex
Corp. v Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). “ In prospecting for genuine issues of

Case 3:01-cv-01142-GAG

Document 336

Page 6 of 7

material fact, we resolve all conflicts and draw all reasonable inferences in the
nonmovant’s favor.” Vineberg v. Bissonnette, 548 F. 3d 50,56 (1st Cir. 2008).

The opposing party has the burden of demonstrating that a trial worthy issue exists that
would warrant the Court’s denial of the motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477
U.S. at 248. The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence is insufficient to defeat a
properly supported motion for summary judgment. 477 Anderson at 252. The opposing
party must demonstrate “ through submissions of evidentiary quality, that a trial worthy
issue persists” Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F. 3d 94, 98 ( 1st Cir. 2006). “ It is therefore
necessary that “ a party opposing summary judgment must present definite, competent
evidence to rebut the motion.” C.I. Saceites S.A. v. Fernadez-Pardo , 2007 WL 4344443
at 3 .
Summary judgment may be appropriate if the non moving party’s case rests merely
upon “conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.”
Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp., 331 F. 3d166, 173 ( 1st Cir. 2003).
As GVLI has shown above the pleadings, allegations and testimonial evidence
demonstrates that Banco Popular actually used the song GENESIS in performance and
that ACEMLA authorized said performance. Lacking a genuine dispute of material fact,
GVLI is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

WHEREFORE , GVLI respectfully request an entry of summary judgment to the effect
that a-under the 1998 settlement agreement between Banco Popular and LAMCO
/ACEMLA, Banco Popular effectively or actually performed the song GENESIS causing
an infringement of GVLI song; b- that the infringement by Banco Popular was the result
of being authorized by ACEMLA thus creating a joint liability.
