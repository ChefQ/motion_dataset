DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S RENEWED MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION 1
On October 9, 2013, the Court denied Plaintiff’s second motion for reconsideration in
this matter, finding it to be untimely. 2 See Order, dkt. no. 51 (Oct. 9, 2013). Plaintiff now
returns to the Court asserting that the Court erred by not considering her motion under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 60(b)(6), for which there is no time limitation. See Motion for Reconsideration of
10.09.2013 Order, dkt. no. 52 (Oct. 16, 2013).
As with her previous motion, Plaintiff’s latest attempt to reopen this long-since dismissed
Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) case should be rejected. This Court properly denied

In a separate Motion to Strike filed contemporaneously, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration contains unredacted Social Security numbers in violation of Fed. R.
Civ. P. 5.2(a)(1). Although granting Defendant’s Motion to Strike would also dispose of
Plaintiff’s motion, Defendant provides this Opposition in the interests of judicial economy.

On October 17, 2011, this Court denied plaintiff’s first motion for reconsideration, seeking to
revisit the entry of summary judgment for Defendant. See dkt. no. 39. On May 25, 2012, the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted defendant’s motion for
summary affirmance, and on August 29, 2012, the mandate issued in this case. See dkt. no. 43.

Plaintiff’s second motion for reconsideration because it plainly arose under Fed. R. Civ. P.
60(b)(2). As Plaintiff clearly stated in that motion, she sought reconsideration because she was
presenting “records which were not available at the time of the final decision in the case.” Dkt.
no. 45 at 3. Elsewhere, the motion repeatedly refers to “new information” on the basis of which
Plaintiff desired reconsideration be granted. See, e.g., dkt. no. 45 at 6, 12.
Fed R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) makes relief available from a “final judgment, order or
proceeding” only for “any other reason that justifies relief.” By its plain text, then, the Rule is a
catch-all provision that excludes any of the reasons explicitly listed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).
See Salazar v. District of Columbia, 633 F.3d 1110, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (Rule 60(b)’s
“provisions are ‘mutually exclusive’ to the extent that subsection (6) cannot be used to avoid the
one-year limitation in subsections (1)—(5)”) (quoting Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick
Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993)). Thus, because Plaintiff’s second motion for
reconsideration was premised on “newly discovered evidence,” the Court properly treated
Plaintiff’s motion solely under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) and applied the one-year limitation in
that subsection. See Salazar, 633 F.3d at 1116; dkt. no. 51. For the same reason, Plaintiff’s
motion would be equally untimely if read generously to allege that reconsideration should be
granted under Rule 60(b)(6) for “mistake,” “excusable neglect,” “fraud,” or any of the other
provisions listed in subsections (1) through (5). See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (b)(3).
In any event, as Defendant previously explained, see dkt. no. 47, Plaintiff’s second
motion for reconsideration was meritless because she did not demonstrate that any of the
purportedly new evidence could not have been discovered through reasonable diligence prior to
this Court’s original order. She relied in her second motion for reconsideration primarily upon a

report she claims was released to the public on March 7, 2011, more than five months before this
Court issued its final judgment. See dkt. no. 45 at 6. Plaintiff also failed to show how any of
that evidence, even if admissible, would be “of such importance that it would probably have
changed the outcome.” Lightfoot v. District of Columbia, 555 F. Supp. 2d 61, 68 (D.D.C. 2008).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.
