IN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
HARRISONBURG DIVISION

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Criminal No.: 5:14-CR-19

v.
GEORGE COVARRUBAIZ

RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS
The Court should deny the defendant’s motion to suppress 32 kilograms of
narcotics (21 kilograms of cocaine and 11 kilograms of heroin) seized by law
enforcement from the defendant’s vehicle on February 3, 2014. The traffic stop that led
to the discovery of these drugs was based upon reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct;
the Trooper observed that the defendant’s vehicle had multiple defective lights.
Additionally, the search of the vehicle that followed the stop was based upon probable
cause because a law enforcement canine trained to detect the scent of narcotics alerted for
the presence of narcotics on the defendant’s vehicle.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The traffic stop in this case was not the first time Virginia State Police Trooper
Joey Miller stopped the defendant on Interstate 81. Trooper Miller had previously
stopped the defendant on December 4, 2013; at that time, the defendant was driving
northbound on I-81 in the same 2008 blue Kenworth commercial tractor, while pulling a
flatbed trailer containing seven large empty green shipping containers. Trooper Miller
stopped the defendant because his tractor trailer had multiple marker lights that were not

functioning. During that stop, the defendant gave Trooper Miller a bill of lading bearing
a December 2013 date, but provided no delivery destination address and no shipping
address. When the defendant handed the bill of lading to Trooper Miller, the defendant
accidentally tore the left side of the document when he removed it from his binder.
Trooper Miller did not issue a citation, but instead issued a warning for the defective
equipment and allowed the defendant to continue his drive.
The traffic stop at issue in this case occurred three months later on February 3,
2014. Trooper Miller was parked and monitoring northbound traffic on Interstate 81 near
mile marker 258.7. Earlier that day, Trooper Miller had received information that the
defendant may be travelling northbound on I-81 carrying a large shipment of narcotics.
Shortly thereafter, Trooper Miller observed the defendant’s vehicle approaching his
position from the south. The Trooper immediately recognized the tractor trailer from his
previous encounter with the defendant. As the defendant’s vehicle passed Trooper
Miller’s position, Trooper Miller observed that the same marker lights still were not
functioning. He also noticed that the truck appeared to be carrying the same green
shipping containers the defendant had been hauling in December. To confirm his
observations, Trooper Miller drove beside the defendant’s vehicle and visually confirmed
that the marker lights were indeed defective.
Next, Trooper Miller conducted the traffic stop on the defendant’s vehicle based
upon a suspected violation of Virginia Traffic Code § 46.2-1003, which prohibits the use
of defective equipment on motor vehicles: “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to use or
have as equipment on a motor vehicle operated on a highway any device or equipment
mentioned in § 46.2-1002 which is defective or in unsafe condition.” Va. Code Ann. §

2

Case 5:14-cr-00019-MFU Document 36 Filed 07/15/14 Page 3 of 8 Pageid#: 48

46.2-1003 (West 1989). Section 46.2-1002 states:
It shall be unlawful for any person to possess with intent to sell or offer for
sale, either separately or as a part of the equipment of a motor vehicle, or
to use or have as equipment on a motor vehicle operated on a highway any
lighting device, warning device, signal device, safety glass, or other
equipment for which approval is required by any provision of this chapter
or any part or parts tending to change or alter the operation of such device,
glass, or other equipment unless of a type that has been submitted to and
approved by the Superintendent or meets or exceeds the standards and
specifications of the Society of Automotive Engineers, the American
National Standards Institute, Incorporated or the federal Department of
Transportation. Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-1002 (West 1989)(underscore
added).
Without delay, Trooper Miller approached the tractor and requested the defendant’s
driver’s license, truck and trailer registration, bill of lading and logbook. When the
defendant produced these items, Trooper Miller recognized the bill of lading as the very
same bill of lading the defendant had given Trooper Miller during the previous traffic
stop outlined above; he recognized the tear on the side of the document as well as the
items listed on it. Trooper Miller also recognized the defendant, the tractor trailer, the
same defective lights, and the same seven empty green cargo containers from the
previous stop. These facts further raised Trooper Miller’s suspicions that the defendant
may have been engaged in criminal conduct.
In accordance with VSP standard investigatory and safety practices, Trooper
Miller asked the defendant to sit in the front passenger seat of the Trooper’s patrol
vehicle to speak with him further. The defendant was not placed under arrest at this time.
When Trooper Miller discussed the apparent violations with the defendant and, more
specifically, that he recognized the defendant from the previous traffic stop, the defendant
displayed increasingly nervous behavior, and could not explain why he had the same bill
of lading he had during the previous traffic stop.

While Trooper Miller was speaking with the defendant, Trooper Jerry Moore
arrived on the scene with a canine trained to detect the scent of narcotics. Trooper Moore
quickly walked the canine around the defendant’s tractor trailer, and the canine alerted to
the scent of narcotics near the driver’s side door of the tractor. Law enforcement
searched the tractor and discovered the 32 kilograms of narcotics hidden in the tractor’s
battery box and in the equipment box attached to the back of the tractor. At this time,
Trooper Miller placed the defendant under arrest. The narcotics had been packaged in 32
individual kilogram-sized packages. Subsequent laboratory analysis by law enforcement
confirmed that 21 of the packages contained cocaine and 11 of the packages contained
heroin.
LAW
Temporary detention of an individual during a traffic stop is a seizure under the
Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809
(1996). Observing a suspected traffic violation gives an officer reasonable suspicion to
stop a vehicle for as long as it takes to perform a routine traffic stop. United States v.
Branch, 537 F.3d 328, 335 (4th Cir. 2008); see also, Whren, 517 U.S. at 810. To support
reasonable suspicion for a stop, the officer must be able to point to “specific and
articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,
reasonably warrant the intrusion.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968). When
examining whether an officer had reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop, courts examine
the “totality of the circumstances.” United States v. Crittendon, 883 F.2d 326, 328 (4th
Cir. 1989); See, e.g., United States v. Whitehead, 849 F.2d 849, 862 (4th Cir. 1988).
In examining the basis of a traffic stop, courts must apply an objective test that

4

Case 5:14-cr-00019-MFU Document 36 Filed 07/15/14 Page 5 of 8 Pageid#: 50

focuses upon whether the officer had the right to stop the vehicle. Ohio v. Robinette, 519
U.S. 33, 38 (1996); Whren, 517 U.S. at 812; see also United States v. Hassan El, 5 F.3d
726, 730 (4th Cir. 1993). Even a minor traffic violation provides an objective right to
stop a vehicle. Hassan El, 5 F.3d at 730. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has
explained that “[u]nder the objective test, if an officer has probable cause or a reasonable
suspicion to stop a vehicle, there is no intrusion upon the Fourth Amendment. That is so
regardless of the fact that the officer would not have made the stop but for some hunch or
inarticulable suspicion of other criminal activity.” Id. Thus, any subjective reasons an
officer may have for stopping a vehicle are not germane when analyzing the
constitutionality of a traffic stop. Id.
ANALYSIS
Trooper Miller had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant on February 3,
2014. As detailed above, Trooper Miller observed multiple traffic violations when the
tractor first passed him traveling northbound on I-81. Specifically, Trooper Miller
observed that multiple marking lights on the defendant’s vehicle—on both the tractor and
the trailer—were not working when it passed his position. To confirm his observations,
Trooper Miller then drove beside the defendant’s vehicle and again observed the
defective lights on the vehicle. After twice observing the defective lights on the
defendant’s vehicle, Trooper Miller then conducted the traffic stop.
Under the objective test outlined above, the totality of the circumstances shows
that Trooper Miller had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed multiple
traffic violations. As explained above, Sections 46.2-1002 and 46.1003 of the Virginia
Criminal and Traffic Law Manual, together, prohibit the use of defective lighting

5

equipment on motor vehicles in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Trooper Miller
personally observed multiple non-functioning lights on the defendant’s vehicle before
conducting the traffic stop. Therefore, Trooper Miller had reasonable suspicion sufficient
to stop the defendant’s vehicle.
After Trooper Miller stopped the defendant, the length of the detention was brief
and, therefore, also reasonable. After he stopped the defendant’s vehicle, Trooper Miller
immediately approached the defendant and began his routine traffic investigation by
requesting the defendant’s license, registration, logbook and bill of lading. At that time,
Trooper Miller noticed that the bill of lading was the same bill of lading the defendant
had given Trooper Miller during the traffic stop in December of 2013. Trooper Miller
also noticed that the defendant was hauling the same seven empty green containers.
Based upon Trooper Miller’s professional experience and training, these facts suggested
to him that the defendant may be engaged in more significant criminal activity, which
would permit a longer period of detention to investigate further and question the
defendant.
However, in this case a longer period of detention was not even necessary. Only
nine minutes after the initial traffic stop commenced, Trooper Moore ran his narcotics
canine around the defendant’s vehicle and it quickly indicated the presence of narcotics.
Law enforcement then searched the defendant’s vehicle and discovered 32 kilograms of
narcotics.

CONCLUSION
The Court should deny the defendant’s motion to suppress. As outlined above,
Trooper Miller had adequate probable cause to conduct the traffic stop that led to the
narcotics that the defendant now seeks to suppress.
