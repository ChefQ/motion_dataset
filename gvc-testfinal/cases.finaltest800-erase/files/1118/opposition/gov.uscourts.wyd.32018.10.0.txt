Counsel for Respondent the Honorable Cynthia Lummis,
U.S. Representative for Wyoming
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF WYOMING

JACQUELINE S. JUDD,
Petitioner,
v.

Case No. 2:15-cv-00064-SWS

CYNTHIA LUMMIS,
U.S. Representative for Wyoming,
Respondent.
RESPONDENT’S OPPOSITION TO PETITIONER’S MOTION TO SET HEARING
Respondent the Honorable Cynthia Lummis, U.S. Representative for Wyoming, hereby
opposes Petitioner Jacqueline S. Judd’s Motion to Set Hearing (“Motion”) (May 12, 2015) (ECF
No. 9).
The Court has discretion to decide motions “on the submissions unless oral argument, at
the Court’s discretion, is ordered.” Local Civil Rule 7.1(a). The only unresolved motion in this
matter is the instant Motion. This Motion, as best we can tell, simply renews Ms. Judd’s request
for a hearing on her Petition for Writ of Mandamus, Declaratory Judgment, and Permanent

Case 2:15-cv-00064-SWS Document 10 Filed 05/13/15 Page 2 of 4

Injunction (“Petition”) (Mar. 20, 2015) (ECF No. 2), which she initially filed in the District
Court of the 7th Judicial District, Natrona County, Wyoming, and which Congresswoman
Lummis removed to this Court on April 29, 2015, see Notice of Removal (Apr. 29, 2015) (ECF
No. 1).1
There is no need to schedule oral argument on this Motion (i.e., to schedule a hearing to
decide whether to schedule a hearing about the allegations in the Petition). It likewise is
premature to set a hearing on Congresswoman Lummis’s as-yet-unfiled response to the Petition.
Per the Court’s May 1, 2015 order (ECF No. 6), Congresswoman Lummis still has almost a
month – until June 8, 2015 – to file her response pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12.
Ms. Judd will have an opportunity thereafter to oppose the Congresswoman’s filing. See Local
Civil Rule 7.1(b)(2)(A).2 Only after the matter is fully briefed will the Court be in a position to
gauge the need, if any, for oral argument. Accordingly, the Motion should be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
KERRY W. KIRCHER, D.C. Bar No. 386816

The Petition obliquely requests oral argument on its cover page and in its prefatory paragraph.
See Petition at 1 (“Request of oral argument SEE ATTACHMENT”); id. at 2 (stating that
Ms. Judd has filed the Petition “vs Wyoming House of Representative Cynthia Lummis for oral
argument to show cause why she should not be held accountable and charged, for aiding and
abetting and by filing the necessary impeachment process . . . on a domestic terrorist, namely
President of the United States of America Barack Hussein Obama . . . .” (emphasis added)).
2

And, Congresswoman Lummis may file a written reply in support of any dispositive motion if
the Court has not yet scheduled such motion for a hearing. See Local Civil Rule 7.1(b)(2)(C).
