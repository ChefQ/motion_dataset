UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO.: 17-cr-20205-UNGARO
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.
DANIEL JOHN PYE,
Defendant.
/
DEFENDANT’S MOTION IN LIMINI PURSUANT TO FED.R.EVID.408 AND
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
The defendant, DANIEL JOHN PYE, by and through his undersigned
attorney, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 408, files this Motion In Limini requesting this
Honorable Court to enter its order prohibiting the government from introducing as
evidence the following compromise offer and/or settlement and as grounds states
as follows:
COMPROMISE/NEGOCIATED SETTLEMENT
1.

The government may seek to introduce evidence of monetary payments

to one of the alleged minor victims in Haiti and/or her mother.
2.

Said minor victim (MV1) and/or her mother made a claim of sexual

abuse against the defendant while he resided in Haiti. The mother was an employee
of the orphanage at the time and was discharged from said employment after said
allegation was made.
3.

The mother and/or the alleged victim retained an attorney in Haiti to

seek compensation from the orphanage and/or the defendant for both the
improper employment termination and the sexual assault allegation. The parties
reached a settlement which did not include an admission of liability and/or guilt
and payments for this settlement were tendered.
FED.R.EVID. 408
Federal Rule of Evidence 408 states as follows:
(a) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the following is not admissible--on behalf of
any party--either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed
claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:
(1) furnishing, promising, or offering--or accepting, promising to accept, or
offering to accept--a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to
compromise the claim; and
(2) conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the
claim--except when offered in a criminal case and when the negotiations
related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory,
investigative, or enforcement authority.
(b) Exceptions. The court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such
as proving a witness's bias or prejudice, negating a contention of undue delay,
or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Per the plain language of Rule 408 evidence of settlement discussions; offers
of compromise; settlement negotiations; and/or the terms of settlements are
inadmissible to prove or disprove the underlying claim. Per the advisory committee
of this rule, the justifications for this rule are that the “compromise at issue may
have been motivated by a desire for peace rather than any concession as to the
merits”; the rule “promotes settlement of disputes”; and “a defendant in a civil suit
is far less likely to offer to settle a claim if evidence of that offer can later be

introduced to prove criminal liability for the same conduct”. United States v. Arias,
431 F.3d 1327,1337 (11th Cir. 2005).
Since evidence of compromise is not necessarily probative of liability, Rule
408 helps to insure accurate determinations in a subsequent trial. Permitting the
introduction of civil settlement offers in subsequent criminal prosecutions actually
compromises the accuracy of the jury’s determination as evidence of settlement is
often irrelevant to liability for the charged conduct and the potential negative
impact of settlement evidence is more profound in criminal proceedings than in
civil proceedings. Id. at 1338.
Wherefore, based upon the aforementioned rule and authority, the Court
should enter its Order precluding the government from introducing the any offer
of settlement; settlement; compromise; and/or monetary payment by the
defendant to the aforementioned individuals.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was
filed electronically, under seal, this 16th day of October, 2017.
