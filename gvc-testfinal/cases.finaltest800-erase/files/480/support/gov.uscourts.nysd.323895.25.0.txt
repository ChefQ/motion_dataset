Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK Document 25 Filed 06/09/2008 Page 4of15

INTRODUCTION

Class member Laurie Rubin moves this Court for entry of an order: (1) appointing her as
Lead Plaintiff pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "PSLRA")
and; (2) approving her selection of Girard Gibbs LLP ("Girard Gibbs') to serve as Lead Counsel,
Stueve Siegel Hanson LLP ("Stueve Siegel") to serve as Co-Lead Counsel, and Seeger Weiss
LLP ("Seeger Weiss') to serve as Liaison Counsel pursuant to the PSLRA.

Ms. Rubin submits that she should be appointed Lead Plaintiff because she: (1) timely
filed a motion for appointment as Lead Plaintiff; (2) has a substantial financial interest in the
action, as she holds $1,775,000 of auction rate securities that she purchased from Raymond
James Financial, Inc., Raymond James & Associates, Inc., and Raymond James Financial
Services, Inc. (collectively "Raymond James") during the Class Period; and (3) will adequately
represent the interests of the Class. See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii). As the presumptive
Lead Plaintiff selects counsel to represent the Class under the PSLRA, and Girard Gibbs, Stueve
Siegel and Seeger Weiss are experienced in the prosecution of securities class actions and will
adequately represent the interests of Class members, the Court should also approve Ms. Rubin's
selection of counsel to represent the Class.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

This litigation arises out of "the hostage crisis otherwise known as the auction-rate
securities market." Gretchen Morgenson, "How to Clear a Road to Redemption," New York
Times (May 4, 2008).' As the New York Times explained last month, "Some $300 billion worth
of investors' funds-advertised as being easy as pie to cash in-are still locked up. And the
brokerage firms that got investors into this mess are doing little to help." Jd.

As described in the Complaint filed in this action, auction rate securities are long-term
variable-rate instruments. Their interest rates reset at periodic auctions, generally held every 7,

28 or 35 days. Auction rate securities include collateralized student loan debt obligations,

Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK Document 25 _ Filed 06/09/2008 Page5of15

preferred shares of closed-end mutual funds, and long-term municipal debt. Despite the
complex, long-term nature of these instruments, broker-dealers marketed auction rate securities
to investors as risk-free, cash-equivalent alternatives to money-market funds.

Raymond James was a substantial seller of auction rate securities. Through its financial
advisors and brokers, Raymond James represented to investors in its uniform sales presentations
and written materials that auction rate securities were the same as cash and were safe, highly
liquid, short-term vehicles suitable for any investor with at least $25,000 of available cash and as
little as one week in which to invest. Raymond James received substantial commissions on the
sales of auction rate securities from investors.

Raymond James knew, but failed to disclose, material facts about the auction market and
the auction rate securities it sold to investors including that: (1) auction rate securities were not
cash alternatives, like money market funds, but were instead, complex, long-term financial
instruments with 30-year maturity dates, or longer; (2) auction rate securities were only liquid at
the time of sale because broker-dealers were artificially supporting and manipulating the auction
market to maintain the appearance of liquidity and stability; (3) broker-dealers routinely
intervened in auctions for their own benefit, to set rates and prevent auctions from failing; and
(4) Raymond James continued to market auction rate securities as liquid investments, even after
it had determined that broker-dealers were likely to withdraw their support for the periodic
auctions which would result in a "freeze" of the auction rate securities market. As a result of
these material non-disclosures, the value of the auction rate securities Raymond James sold was
not as represented.

On February 13, 2008, all of the major broker-dealers withdrew their support for the
auction rate securities market, causing 87 percent of all auctions to fail. The collapse of the
auction rate securities market rendered more than $300 billion of outstanding securities illiquid.
An analyst for Citigroup, the largest underwriter of auction rate securities, recently predicted that
the auction rate securities market will "cease to exist" entirely and that the collapse of the auction

rate securities market could cause investors to "stop using the services of their brokerage and/or

 

 
Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK Document 25 Filed 06/09/2008 Page6of15

asset management firms as a result of a loss of trust." Martin Z. Braun, "Auction-Rate Market
Will `Cease to Exist,' Citi Says (Update2)," Bloomberg (April 15, 2008).'

The auction rate securities debacle has caught the attention of federal, state and industry
regulators. Investigations are now being conducted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the State of New York, and a nine-
state task force including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, Texas and Washington.*? Raymond James has also received a subpoena from the
Attorney General of New York.`

Investors are also pursuing their rights. This class action asserts claims under Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all persons and entities who
purchased auction rate securities from Raymond James between April 8, 2003 and February 13,
2008 (the date of the collapse of the auction rate securities market), inclusive, and continued to
hold such securities as of February 13, 2008.

ARGUMENT
I. MS. RUBIN SHOULD BE APPOINTED LEAD PLAINTIFF

Ms. Rubin is the trustee of the Laurie Rubin Revocable Trust, the trustee for Cole
Goldenberg, and the president of Laurie Rubin Inc. (collectively, the "Rubin Entities"). Through
the Rubin Entities, Ms. Rubin holds $1,775,000 in auction rate securities she purchased from
Raymond James during the Class Period. Ms. Rubin respectfully submits that she should be
appointed Lead Plaintiff because she has complied with all of the PSLRA's requirements, has
demonstrated the largest financial interest in this litigation, and otherwise meets the relevant

requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.

A. The Procedure Required By the PSLRA

The PSLRA establishes the procedure that governs the appointment of a lead plaintiff in
"each private action arising under the [Exchange Act] that is brought as a plaintiff class action
pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(1) and (a)(3)(B)(i).

The plaintiff who files the initial action must publish a notice to the class, within 20 days of
filing the complaint, informing class members of their right to file a motion for appointment as
lead plaintiff. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A)(). Ms. Rubin's counsel, on behalf of named plaintiff
Defer LP, filed this action relating to Raymond James's sale of auction rate securities, and
caused notice to be published on Business Wire on April 8, 2008. See Declaration of Jonathan K.
Levine In Support of the Motion of for Appointment of Laurie Rubin as Lead Plaintiff and
Approval of Selection of Counsel ("Levine Dec."), Ex. A. Within 60 days of publishing the
notice, any person or group of persons who are members of the proposed class may apply to the
court to be appointed as lead plaintiff, whether or not they have previously filed a complaint in
the action. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A) and (B).

The PSLRA also provides that, within 90 days after publication of the notice, the Court
shall consider any motion made by a class member and shall appoint as lead plaintiff the member
or members of the class that the Court determines to be "most capable of adequately representing
the interests of class members." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i). In determining the "most

adequate plaintiff," the PSLRA provides that:

[T]he court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate
plaintiff in any private action arising under this Act is the person or
group of persons that:

(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to
anotice...

(bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial
interest in the relief sought by the class; and

(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.

 

 
Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK Document 25 Filed 06/09/2008 Page8of15

15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)Gii). See generally Albert Fadem Trust v. Citigroup, Inc., 239 F.
Supp. 2d 344, 347 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (Swain, J.).

B. Ms. Rubin Satisfies The Lead Plaintiff Requirements Of The PSLRA

1. Ms. Rubin Has Complied With the PSLRA and Should Be Appointed
Lead Plaintiff

As notice of the filing of the initial action was published on April 8, 2008, the time period
in which class members may move to be appointed lead plaintiff in this case expires on June 9,
2008. See Levine Decl., Ex. A; 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(A) and (B); Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a). Ms.
Rubin's application, filed on June 9, 2008, is thus timely. Ms. Rubin has reviewed the complaint
and is willing to serve as a representative party on behalf of the Class. See Levine Decl., Ex. B
(Rubin Certification). In addition, Ms. Rubin has selected and retained competent counsel to
represent her and the Class. See id., Ex. C (firm resume of Girard Gibbs), Ex. D (firm resume of
Stueve Siegel), Ex. E (firm resume of Seeger Weiss). Accordingly, Ms. Rubin has satisfied the
individual requirements of 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B), and the Court should approve her

application for appointment as Lead Plaintiff and her selection of counsel to represent the Class.

2. Ms. Rubin Has The Requisite Financial Interest In The Relief Sought
By The Class

Pursuant to the PSLRA, identification of the most adequate plaintiff "begins with the
identification of the movant with "the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class.'"
In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 262 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-
4(a)(3)(B)Gii)(1)(bb)). "In other words, the district court must compare the financial stakes of
the various plaintiffs and determine which one has the most to gain from the lawsuit." In re
Cavanaugh, 306 F.3d 726, 730 (9th Cir. 2002). "The PSLRA does not specify a method for
calculating which plaintiff has the `largest financial interest,' and neither the Supreme Court nor
the Second Circuit has articulated such a method." See In re Fuwei Films Sec. Litig., 247 F.R.D.
432, 436-37 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). To calculate each movant's financial interest in the litigation, the

Court should "select accounting methods that are both rational and consistently applied." Jn re

 
Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK Document 25 Filed 06/09/2008 Page9of15

Cavanaugh, 306 F.3d at 730 n.4. Generally, courts have considered the following factors in
determining a movant's financial interest: (1) the number of shares purchased during the class
period; (2) the number of net shares purchased during the class period; (3) the total net funds
expended during the class period; and (4) the approximate losses suffered. In re Fuwei Films,
247 F.R.D. at 437 (citing Lax v. First Merchs. Acceptance Corp., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11866,
*17 (N_D. Ill. 1997)).

Ms. Rubin has a substantial financial interest in this case. Through the Rubin Entities,
Ms. Rubin presently holds 71 shares of auction rate securities with a par value of $1,775,000 that
she purchased through Raymond James during the Class Period. See Levine Decl., Ex. F
' (analysis of Ms. Rubin's Class Period transactions). Raymond James had not disclosed to Ms.
Rubin or the Rubin Entities the risks associated with auction rate securities prior to selling them.
Upon the collapse of the auction market at the end of the Class Period, all of those securities
were rendered illiquid, precluding Ms. Rubin from selling her shares on the auction market.

Because Raymond James sold auction rate securities as highly liquid cash equivalents,
and these securities are now illiquid, each movant's financial interest can be measured
conservatively by the amount of his or her investment that remains illiquid-in other words, the
par value of the auction rate securities that were purchased from Raymond James during the
Class Period that have not been redeemed by the issuer. Under this formulation, Ms. Rubin's
financial interest for purposes of this motion, is $1,775,000-the par value of the shares of now-
illiquid auction rate securities Ms. Rubin purchased from Raymond James during the Class
Period and held at the end of the Class Period that were not redeemed after the Class Period.
Given the nature of the securities at issue, this is an objective and conservative method for
calculating the financial interest of each movant seeking appointment as Lead Plaintiff under the
PSLRA.

To the best of Ms. Rubin's knowledge, no other applicant with a greater financial interest

seeks appointment as Lead Plaintiff in this matter. Ms. Rubin thus satisfies all of the PSLRA's

 
Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK Document 25 Filed 06/09/2008 Page 10 of 15

prerequisites for appointment as Lead Plaintiff in this action and should be appointed Lead

Plaintiff pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B).

3. Ms. Rubin Otherwise Satisfies Rule 23

In addition to possessing the largest financial interest in the outcome of the litigation, the
Lead Plaintiff must also "otherwise satisfy] the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u-4(a)(3)(B). Rule 23(a) provides that a party may serve as a
class representative only if the following four requirements are satisfied: (1) the class is so
numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact
common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative party are typical of the
claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative party will fairly and adequately protect
the interests of the class.

Of the four prerequisites to class certification, only two - typicality and adequacy -
concern the personal characteristics of the class representative. Consequently, a court deciding a
lead plaintiff motion should limit its inquiry to the typicality and adequacy prongs of Rule 23(a),
as "the moving plaintiff must make only a preliminary showing that the adequacy and typicality
requirements under Rule 23 have been met." In re Fuwei Films, 247 F.R.D. at 436 (quotations
omitted); see also Fadem Trust, 239 F. Supp. 2d at 347 ("Typicality and adequacy of
representation are the only provisions relevant to a determination of lead plaintiff under the
PSLRA."). Ms. Rubin satisfies both the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23.

Under Rule 23(a)(3), the claims or defenses of the representative party must be typical of
those of the class. Typicality exists where the plaintiff's claims arise from the same course of
events and are based on similar legal theories as the claims of the class members. See, e.g., In re
Fuwei Films, 247 F.R.D. at 436. Typicality does not require that there be no factual differences
between the class representative and the class members, because it is the generalized nature of

the claims asserted that determines whether the class representative is typical. See id. ("The lead
