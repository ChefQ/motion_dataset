SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION OF
LAURIE RUBIN FOR APPOINTMENT AS LEAD PLAINTIFF
AND APPROVAL OF SELECTION OF COUNSEL

Case 1:08-cv-03449-LAK

This class action alleges that Raymond James deceptively marketed auction rate
securities to investors as cash-equivalent alternatives to money-market funds, when they were in
fact complex, long-term financial instruments. Those securities became illiquid on February 13,
2008, after all major broker-dealers abruptly withdrew their “support” for the $330 billion
auction rate securities market. State and federal regulators are now conducting several probes
into the collapse of the market. In April 2008, Raymond James received a subpoena from the
New York Attorney General as part of an investigation into the disclosures made to investors
about the safety and liquidity of auction rate securities.
On June 9, 2008, class member Laurie Rubin filed a timely motion, pursuant to the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B), for her appointment as
Lead Plaintiff and approval of her selection of counsel. See Docket Nos. 24-26. No other Class
member filed a motion for appointment. On June 18, 2008, defendants advised the Court that
they do not take a position with respect to Ms. Rubin’s motion. See Docket No. 28.
Ms. Rubin satisfies the criteria for appointment as Lead Plaintiff. Ms. Rubin is the
trustee of the Laurie Rubin Revocable Trust, the trustee for Cole Goldenberg, and the president
of Laurie Rubin Inc. (collectively, the “Rubin Entities”). In her motion for appointment, Ms.
Rubin demonstrated that, through the Rubin Entities, she holds $1,775,000 in illiquid auction
rate securities she purchased from Raymond James during the Class Period. “As the only
movant for appointment as lead plaintiff, [Ms. Rubin] has the largest financial interest in the
relief sought . . . .” Koppel v. 4987 Corp., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12340, *25 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.
11, 1999).
As described in her previously filed motion, Ms. Rubin also satisfies the typicality and
adequacy requirements for appointment as Lead Plaintiff, as set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 78u4(a)(3)(B)(iii). Ms. Rubin is typical in that her claims and the claims of all other Class members
arise out of their purchases of auction rate securities from Raymond James during the Class
Period as a result of Raymond James’s materially false and misleading statements and omissions
about the liquidity and risk characteristics of those securities and the auction market. Ms. Rubin

is an adequate Class representative because her interests are aligned with those of other Class
members, and there is no evidence of any antagonism between their interests. In addition, Ms.
Rubin has selected competent and experienced counsel to prosecute the claims in this case and to
serve the interests of the Class. Accordingly, Ms. Rubin is the presumptive “most adequate
plaintiff” under the PSLRA. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii).
For the reasons stated herein and in her moving papers, Ms. Rubin respectfully requests
that this Court: (1) appoint her as Lead Plaintiff pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i); and
(2) approve her selection of counsel pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(v).
