PLAINTIFF, JAVIER DIAZ’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
DISMISS
Now comes the Plaintiff, Javier Diaz, and hereby opposes the Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss on the grounds that the Plaintiff has met the standard of pleading required by Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) as well as the standard set forth in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.
1937, 1949 (2009) and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). The Plaintiff has
provided the Defendants with sufficient notice of the claims against them in order for them to
mount a defense and has set forth enough facts to raise a right to relief above the low speculative
level of Iqbal and Twombly.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Plaintiff filed this lawsuit for violations of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(2)(A) and the Massachusetts Consumer Protection statute M.G.L. c. 93A.
The Plaintiff was targeted with dunning letters from the Defendants on an account that was the
result of identity theft and was dismissed in 2006 as such.

II. FACTS
The Plaintiff was once the target of a collections lawsuit in 2006 which was dropped by
the prosecuting attorney on or about April 25, 2006 because it became evident that the account at
issue was the result of identity theft and was not the responsibility of the Plaintiff, hereinafter
referred to as the “2006 Case.” The prosecuting attorney, the Law Offices of Gary H. Kreppel,
P.C., sent an Affidavit of Fraud Application for the Plaintiff to complete and return which the
Plaintiff did. The Affidavit was signed and sworn to by the Plaintiff in front of a notary public.
The letter, dated April 25, 2006, and Affidavit, dated April 28, 2006, are annexed hereto as
Exhibit A. Shortly thereafter, the case was dismissed by the Law Office of Gary H. Kreppel,
P.C.; a copy of the dismissal is annexed hereto as Exhibit B. Despite holding all the cards, the
Law Office of Gary H. Kreppel, P.C., an established and experienced law firm, dismissed the
case. The Plaintiff was able to resume his life.
On September 21, 2011, the Defendant, Resurgent Capital Services sent a letter to the
Plaintiff demanding $10,708.22 due and owing on the same account that was at issue in the 2006
Case. On January 17, 2012, the Defendant, Credit Control sent a letter to the Plaintiff
demanding $10,837.62 due and owing on the same account that was at issue in the 2006 Case.
In an attempt to settle this case before litigation, the Plaintiff, through counsel, sent letters
pursuant to M.G.L.c. 93A to both Defendants. The letters and certified mail receipts are annexed
hereto as Exhibit C. Said letters were ignored by the Defendants. The Plaintiff filed this lawsuit
on July 11, 2012. The Complaint alleges violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and
violations of the Massachusetts Consumer Protections Act.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
The Motion to Dismiss standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is a very low threshold.
Only conclusory statements that are not bolstered with any facts should be dismissed. The claim
must only be plausible on its face, meaning plaintiff must plead factual content that allows the
court to draw the reasonable inference that defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009)(citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544 (2007)). Moreover, the court accepts all factual allegations in the complaint as true and
construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Newdow v. Lefevre,
598 F.3d 638, 642 (9th Cir. 2010). Based on this low standard, the Defendants carry a heavy
burden of showing that there is no plausible cause of action pled.
IV. ARGUMENT
A. THE MOTIVATION OF THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT
ENCOURAGES A BROAD READING OF THE ACT AND OF THE PRACTICES
PROHIBITED.
The Plaintiff has pled a cognizable cause of action under the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act given the broad protections provided and the constantly evolving nature of
violations. The purpose of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is to protect the least
sophisticated consumer from the myriad of abuses by the collections industry. Russell v.
Equifax A.R.S., 74 F.3d 30 (2d Cir. 1996)(describing the standard as a level of sophistication
below that of the average consumer). The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act is a remedial
statute and should be broadly construed to affect its purpose. Brown v. Card Serv. Ctr., 464 F.3d
450 (3d Cir. Sept. 29, 2006). In fact, it was the intent of Congress to give the courts broad
flexibility to proscribe improper conduct not specifically anticipated and addressed in the Act

Page 3 of 9

Case 1:12-cv-11281-GAO Document 13 Filed 08/30/12 Page 4 of 9

because of the inability to foresee every conceivable abusive debt collection method. S. Rep.
No. 382 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 4, at 4. Furthermore, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is a
strict liability statute which means the collector is liable without regard for intent or knowledge.
Harrington v. CAC, LLC, 508 F.Supp. 2d 128 (D. Mass. Aug 30, 2007). Therefore, a claim
under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act can be valid even if not specifically
compartmentalized within one of the identified violations within the statute or precedent. In fact,
it was anticipated during the drafting of the Act that it should be read broadly to encompass all
manner of action that offends the conscience of the community and takes into consideration
society’s evolving view of consumer rights.
The Plaintiff’s Complaint meets the minimal pleading requirement to establish a Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act claim based on the broad protections the Act provides. The very
heart of Plaintiff’s case is that he has been subjected to collection efforts by two separate
collection agencies on a debt that was cleared back in 2006. By not thoroughly reviewing the
account at issue before sending dunning letters, the Defendants have adopted the “Shoot First,
Ask Questions Later” way of doing business. How many times must the Plaintiff defend his
name before he is free? There must be recognition that the Defendants hold the duty to properly
review their accounts before sending dunning letters which disrupt and upset the lives of
consumers.
Under the 12(b)(6) standard, the Complaint makes it clear to the Defendants what the
basis for the cause of action against them is under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Given
the very broad reading of the Act to protect the least sophisticated consumer, dismissal is not
appropriate. The court should allow the Plaintiff an opportunity to show a violation of the Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act to a trier of fact precisely because of the wide breadth of possible

Page 4 of 9

Case 1:12-cv-11281-GAO Document 13 Filed 08/30/12 Page 5 of 9

violations contemplated. Simply put, a “Shoot First, Ask Questions Later” standard of doing
business is unconscionable, especially when the facts to avoid this situation were available as
early as 2006.
B. THE PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED SUFFICIENT FACTS TO MAKE A PRIMA FACIE
CASE UNDER 15 U.S.C. §1692 e(2)(A).
Under 15 U.S.C. § 1692 e(2)(A) of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, it is a
violation to falsely misrepresent the character, amount, or legal status of any debt. The facts of
the Complaint confirm violation of all three categories. First, the character of the debt is
misrepresented as this account is not the responsibility of the Plaintiff as alleged in the
Complaint. Because the account is not the Plaintiff’s, and there is a sworn Affidavit attesting as
such, the Defendants’ characterization of the account as the Plaintiff’s is false. Second, the
amount sought by Defendant Resurgent and Defendant Credit Control, $10,708.22 and
$10,837.62 respectively, is also false because the true amount as alleged in the Complaint is
$0.00 because of the identity theft.
Finally, by sending the collection letters, Defendants have falsely implied the legal status
of the debt that would deceive the least sophisticated consumer. The mere fact that the Plaintiff
received collection letters on this debt is sufficient for him to believe that this debt was valid, that
he could be taken to court for it, and that he will be legally responsible for the amount sought.
This is important because if the Plaintiff were to make even the smallest payment on the account
after receiving the letter, the statute of limitations on the debt would be reset and there would be
an implied admission on the part of the Plaintiff that he has agreed to liability. Taken as true, the
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case under 15 U.S.C. §
1692 e(2)(A) above the low speculative threshold.

C. OBJECTIVELY VIEWED, THE “2006 CASE” IS AN INVOLUNTARY ADJUDICATION
ON THE MERITS.
The Defendants’ reliance on Dawe v. Capital One Bank, 456 F. Supp.2d 236 (D. Mass.
2006), is misplaced. The most important difference between Dawe and this case is the way in
which the dismissal was obtained. In Dawe, the involuntary dismissal was wholly procedural in
nature, “[t]here is no indication in the record that the state court actually adjudicated or made any
findings with respect to the issue of the debt’s validity.” Id. at 241. In this case, the debt’s
validity was called into question and was the main reason for the 2006 Case’s dismissal.
The Law Office of Gary H. Kreppel, P.C. brought the 2006 Case for Citibank with the
desire to collect. Only after it became apparent to the Law Office of Gary H. Kreppel, P.C. that
the validity of the debt was in question and only after the Plaintiff signed a sworn affidavit
attesting that the account was the result of identity theft was the 2006 Case dismissed. Should
the 2006 Case gone further in litigation, it would have been dismissed involuntarily because of
the identity theft issue that the Law Office of Gary H. Kreppel, P.C. identified early in the case.
The Affidavit was filed and accepted by the court in the 2006 Case. The Affidavit is a public
record and has been available since approximately May 26, 2006. The rationale used in Dawe to
have the debt survive does not have any place here.
D. PLAINTIFF’S M.G.L.c. 93A CLAIM IS A SEPARATE CAUSE OF ACTION THAT
SURVIVES THE DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS.
Failing to respond in writing to a 93A Demand Letter is itself a further violation of
M.G.L. c. 93A. In Heller v. Silverbranch Construction Corp., 376 Mass. 621 (1978), the court
determined that the failure to answer a 93A Demand Letter could be deemed a violation of
M.G.L.c. 93A if “the refusal to grant relief on demand was made in bad faith with knowledge or
reason to know that the practice complained of violated § 2.” Id. at 627. In elaboration, the

Page 6 of 9

Case 1:12-cv-11281-GAO Document 13 Filed 08/30/12 Page 7 of 9

court stated that the purpose of the 93A Demand Letter is to promote pre-litigation settlements
by making it unprofitable for the defendant either to ignore the plaintiff's request for relief or to
bargain with the plaintiff with respect to such relief in bad faith.” Id. The court found that
Silverbranch had violated M.G.L.c. 93A when it forced Heller to litigate its “claim when it not
only had reason to know but had actual knowledge of the unlawfulness of its acts.” Id. at 628.
Therefore, in order to accomplish the goal of M.G.L.c. 93A in total, the response requirement of
the demand letter cannot be ignored.
The Defendants failed to respond to a 93A Demand Letter that was properly served at CT
Corporation System, 155 Federal Street, Suite 700, Boston, MA 02110 on May 24, 2012. This is
same address where this lawsuit was served and received. See Exhibit C. The Defendants chose
to ignore the letters forcing the Plaintiff to file this lawsuit in order to even open up a dialogue.
The Defendants’ refusal to answer is in contravention to the purpose of the demand letter
requirement of M.G.L.c. 93A. Thus, the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish a prima
facie case of a violation of M.G.L.c. 93A above the low speculative level. It is without question
that the Plaintiff’s M.G.L.c. 93A claims based upon 209 CMR § 18.16 survive along with his 15
U.S.C. § 1692 e(2)(A) claims under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
E. THE PLAINTIFF SHOULD BE GIVEN LEAVE OF COURT TO AMEND ITS
COMPLAINT.
Should the court find the Defendants’ Motion persuasive, the Plaintiff requests that he be
given leave to amend his complaint so as to provide a more detailed account of the claims
against the Defendants. If the court dismisses the complaint, or portions thereof, it must consider
whether to grant leave to amend. Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000). The
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) allows a party to amend with leave of court when
justice so requires. Amendment accomplishes the dual goal of conserving judicial resources and
Page 7 of 9

Case 1:12-cv-11281-GAO Document 13 Filed 08/30/12 Page 8 of 9

providing the Defendants with further notice and facts from which they can prepare their
defense.
F. THE PLAINTIFF REQUESTS ORAL ARGUMENT.
Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d), the Plaintiff invokes his right to be heard on oral argument
on the Defendants’ Motion.
V. CONCLUSION
Therefore, the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be DENIED in full. Taken in the
light most favorable to the non-moving party, the facts alleged in the Complaint and associated
Exhibits set forth a cause of action under the broad protections of the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute 93A.
