2.

On October 3. 2013. Derendant received by certified mail the Complaint in the

above captioned action.
3.

Counsel for Defendant was notified on October 11. 2013. of the receipt of this

Complaint and was forwarded a copy of the September 27. 2013. email, set forth in its entirety
above.
4.

On October 23, 2013. Defendant filed and served its Motion to Dismiss and/or

Motion to Strike (hereinafter "Motion to Dismiss") the above captioned case at 9:08 a.m. MDT.
5.

According to the Court's electronic liling and notice system, on October 23.2013.

at 1: 18 p.m .. Plaintiffs filed their Request for Clerk's Entry of Default.
As stated in Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, this appears to be the

7'h case filed by these

Plaintiffs against various collection agencies and attorneys over the past two years. This is the
second case filed against this responding Defendant in recent months. The two pending cases
against Quantum appear to be lacking in merit. but given the length of the complaints. including
this one. and the rambling detail set forth therein, it is impossible to detemline at this point. and
without any discovery, whether the claims have any substance to them, or whether these cases
are nothing more than some form of litigation 'extortion.' The history of these Plaintiffs with
these types of cases gives one pause.
In any event. it is impossible to detennine from PlaintitTs' Aflidavit and Request when
the Summons and Complaint were "dcposit[ ed] in the United States mail. as evidenced by the

postmark. ... " (Emphasis added.) That is of course important because. under W.S. 17-28I04(b )(iii). service is perfected five (5) days after such deposit. In any event, Plaintiffs offer no
credible proof as to when the Summons and Complaint were deposited in the United States mail.

Case 2:13-cv-00218-ABJ Document 9 Filed 10/29/13 Page 3 of 5

If the Summons and Complaint were deposited in the United States mail on September
27,2013, the date on which Plaintiff George James sent his "Welcome to the Party Pal" email to
Defendant. then Defendant" s responsive pleading \vas due on or before October 23, 2013, the
date on which the Motion to Dismiss was filed and served. If the Summons and Complaint were
not, for some reason. properly mailed, then service was perfected when Defendant received
service on October 3,2013, establishing a response date of October 24, 20l3.
Assuming, though not conceding, that service of the Summons and Complaint was
perfected on October 1, 2013. as Plaintiffs assert in their joint Aftidavit, then Defendant's
responsive pleading was due on October 22, 2013, and the Motion to Dismiss filed the next
morning at 9:08 a.m. was 9 hours and 8 minutes late.
Rule 55(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:
"When a party against whom a jUdgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to

plead or otherwise defend. and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise. the clerk must
enter the party's default." (Emphasis added.)
At the time when Plaintiffs filed their Request. Defendant had already filed and served its
Motion to Dismiss, at least by notice received from the electronic filing system. III fact, the
Motion to Dismiss was filed and served four hours prior to Plaintiffs filing their Request. So the
clerk is not obligated to enter default in this matter.
But if it is determined that the precise wording or the Rule does not absolve Defendant of
its possible 9 hour and 8 minute delay in responding to Plaintiffs' Complaint. then in the interest
of resolving disputes on the merits and in the exercise of its sound discretion, the Court should
do so.

Defaults are not looked upon with favor. "[T]his court has long recognized that 'del~llIlt
judgments are not favored in the law' and 'it is preferable that cases be tried on their merits:'

Rosty v. Skaj, 272 P.3d 947. 957 (Wyo. 2(12). There is a "strong preference" that defaults be
avoided and that claims and defenses should be disposed of on their merits.

Coile/oil

Preparatory Acad., Illc. v. Hoover Ulliversal. III C. , 2013 WL 5634325 2 (D. Md.).
Among the factors the courts consider when exercising their discretion are the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Whether the moving party has a meritorious defense.
Whether the moving party has acted with reasonable promptness.
The personal responsibility of the defaulting party.
The prejudice to the non-moving party.
Whether there is a history of dilatory action.
The availability of less drastic action.

Id.
"Relief hom a default entry has been granted \vhen the default was due to
a mistake by counsel as to the applicable procedural rules or the effect of preanswer motions on the time within which to answer: the illness of counsel. the
client. or an employee; a clerical mistake, confusion. or a misunderstanding by
counsel: or defendant's failure to receive service. A Rule 55(c) motion also may
be granted whenever the court finds that the default was not the result of gross
neglect. that the nondefaulting party will not be substantially prejudiced by the
reopening, and the party in default has a meritorious defense.
Although Rule 55(c) motions are frequently granted. this is not always the
case. Thus, relief may be clenied when the party in default has been grossly
negligent or has sutTered a default as a result of a willfuL intentional act." lOA
Fed. Prac. & Pmc. Gv. § 2696 (3d ed.).

If Defendant's response to

Plaintin~s

Complaint was due on or before October 22,2013.

which is uncertain at this point. then Defendant's failure to file its response was based solely on a
lack of information concerning the date on which Plaintiffs Complaint (and perhaps the
Summons) were deposited in the United States mail. As the record reflects, Defendant's Motion
to Dismiss was filed with "reasonable promptness." There is no history of"dilatory" conduct by

4

Case 2:13-cv-00218-ABJ Document 9 Filed 10/29/13 Page 5 of 5

Defendant's counsel. And Plaintiff will 110t be prejudiced by allowing the case to proceed on it s
merits.

the event defau!! has already bee n e nte rcd , Defc ndan t respect full y requests the Ent ry of Default
