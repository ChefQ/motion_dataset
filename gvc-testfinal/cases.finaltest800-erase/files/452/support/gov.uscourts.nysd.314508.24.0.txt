PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO QUASH DEPOSITION SUBPOENA

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") respectfully requests

that the Court issue a protective order, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 and 45(3)(A),

to quash a deposition subpoena issued to Dr. Erik R. Sirri ("Dr. Sirri"), Director of the

Commission's Division of Trading and Markets. The subpoena is attached as Exhibit A hereto.

As grounds for the protective order, the Commission asserts that Dr. Sirri's testimony is: (1)

irrelevant to this case; and (2) protected from discovery by the government deliberative process

privilege. On these bases, the Commission requests that the subpoena be quashed.

BACKGROUND

The Commission's Allegations

On October 15, 2007, the Commission filed this enforcement action against Defendants
Colonial Investment Management, LLC ("CIM"), Colonial Fund LLC ("Colonial"), and Cary G.
Brody ("Brody") (collectively, the "Defendants"). The Amended Complaint ("Complaint"), filed
November 14, 2007, alleges that, between 2001 and 2004, Defendants violated Rule 105 of
Regulation M ("Rule 105") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act') when
they used shares purchased in at least ei ghteen registered public offerings to cover short sales that
occurred during the five business days before the pricing of those offerings (the "restricted period").
(Compl. 4 1.) Defendants realized profits from this illegal trading in excess of $1.48 million. (Id.)

The Commission further alleges that Defendants continued to violate Rule 105 even after
they knew, on or about July 17, 2003, that the Commission staff was investigating Defendants'
participation in certain equity offerings. Despite having actual notice of the Commission's
investigation, Defendants continued to violate Rule 105, committing fourteen of the eighteen
specifically alleged violations after July 17, 2003. Defendants committed nine of the ten violations
involving the use of sham transactions after learning of the Commission's investigation. (Compl. |
52.) During 2004 and 2005, Defendants may have committed further violations of Rule 105 in
connection with additional registered offerings by covering restricted period short sales with shares
purchased in the registered offerings. (Compl. J 51.)

The Commission alleges that, in light of Defendants' numerous and repeated past violations
of Rule 105, and their use of sham transactions to conceal their violative trading, it is likely that
Defendants will continue to violate Rule 105, even as that rule has been amended, in the future.

(Compl. 0x00A7 55.) The Complaint seeks a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining each Defendant
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 3 of 18

pursuant to Exchange Act 0x00A7 21(d)(1), 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u(d)(1), from further violating Rule 105 of
_ Regulation M, 17 C-F.R. 0x00A7 242.105; (2) requiring Defendants to disgorge all their ill-gotten gains,
with prejudgment interest, under the Court's inherent equitable powers, 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u(d)(5); and
(3) imposing civil monetary penalties against Defendant Brody under Section 21(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78u(d)(3). (Compl. { 4.)
Rule 105 |

Rule 105, at the time of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, prohibited Defendants from
taking essentially three steps: (1) short selling prior to an offering, (2) purchasing shares in the
offering and (3) covering the pre-offering short position with the shares purchased in the offering.
Rule 105, as amended, prohibits taking two of those steps, so that: (1) if you short sell prior to an
offering, you cannot also (2) purchase shares in the offering.? Defendants' conduct alleged in the
Complaint violated both versions of Rule 105 because, in each instance alleged in the Complaint,
- Defendants took all violative steps.
Defendants' Deposition Subpoena to Dr. Sirm

Among other things, Defendants have argued, in a pending motion to dismiss, that Rule 105

was vague, and that an adopting release to the Commission's Regulation SHO amounted to an ex

 

' Rule 105, in effect at the time of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, provided in pertinent part:
"In connection with an offering of securities for cash pursuant to a registration statement...filed
under the Securities Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to cover a short sale with offered
securities purchased from an underwriter or broker or dealer participating in the offering, if such
short sale occurred during the [Restricted Period]." 17 C.F.R. 0x00A7242.105(a) (2006).

> Amended Rule 105, which became effective October 9, 2007, provides in pertinent part: "In
connection with an offering of equity securities for cash pursuant to a registration statement ... filed
under the Securities Act ..., it shall be unlawful for any person to sell short ... the security that is
the subject of the offering and purchase the offered securities from an underwriter or broker or
dealer participating in the offering if such short sale was effected during the [Restricted Period]."

17 C.F.R. 0x00A7242.105(a) (2007).
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 4of 18

post facto rulemaking with respect to Rule 105. (See Defs' Mem. of Law in Supp. of their Mot. To
Dismiss, Dkt. #16, at 7.) To buttress the argument in their motion to dismiss, Defendants pointed to
remarks Dr. Sirri made at a December 4, 2006 public meeting.' Now, Defendant Brody - the
individual alleged to be responsible for the trading in this case - has admitted that Rule 105 was not
vague to him; rather, he believes that Rule 105 was vague to the Commission. (See Ex. B (Brody
Dep. Test.) at 229-30.) Defendants seek Dr. Sirri's deposition, in an apparent effort to further
develop their assertion that Rule 105 was unclear to the Commission - an assertion that is
completely irrelevant to this enforcement action.

Dr. Sirri's deposition subpoena should be quashed because his testimony is irrelevant. The
interpretation of Rule 105 is a matter for the Court in the present case, an action to determine
whether Defendants violated and are likely to continue to violate Rule 105. Additionally, Dr. Sirn's
remarks are a matter of public record. An inquiry of Dr. Sirri about Rule 105 impermissibly delves
into the Commission's deliberative processes.

ARGUMENT
L Dr. Sirri's Testimony Is Irrelevant .

Dr. Sirri's deposition cannot lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as required by

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1). Presumably, Defendants seek the testimony of Dr. Sirri

to buttress their assertion Rule 105 was vague or unclear to the Commission. That assertion is

 

> Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss, setting forth in detail why
Defendants' assertion in this regard is specious. Among other reasons, Defendants argument is a
red herring because the proposing release to Regulation SHO did not relate to the conduct at issue
here; the release did not alter the meaning of Rule 105 or attempt to prohibit conduct not already
encompassed by Rule 105; and Dr. Sirri's remarks do not evidence that Rule 105 was vague or
unclear in any way. (See Pl's Mem. of Law in Opp. to Defs' Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. # 18, at 14-23.)
Plaintiff will not repeat in detail the arguments in its opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss
here, but incorporates them by reference.
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 5of 18

irrelevant to whether the Defendants have violated and are likely to violate Rule 105. The
interpretation of Rule 105 is a matter for the Court to decide. The Court must judge Defendants'
conduct by the legal standards applicable to their conduct. Rule 105 says what it says; Commission
staff's statements and opinions do not change its terms.

Even if Defendants' assertion that the Commission was confused about Rule 105 were
relevant, which it is not, Dr. Sirri cannot testify as to the Commission's views of Rule 105. See 17
C.F.R. 0x00A7 202.1(d) (`opinions expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official
expression of the Commission's views"); cf. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 78d-1 (Commission may delegate, by
published order or rule, its functions to a division of the Commission). Statements of Commission
staff are not statements of the Commission, which acts as a collegial body through its Chairman and
Commissioners. See, e.g., SEC v. National Student Mktg. Corp., 538 F.2d 404, 406-07 (D.C. Cir.
1976) (affirming district court that, "internal documents authored by agency staff or individual
Commissioners `cannot be considered as an official expression of the will and intent of the
Commission.""'); Pennzoil Co. v. DOE, 680 F.2d 156, 161-62 & n.8 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1982)
(citing cases). |

Nor can Dr. Sirri's testimony about his own thoughts regarding Rule 105 be at all relevant.
The obligation to comply with the securities laws is the Defendants', and this obligation cannot be
shifted to the Commission or its staff under any circumstances. See, e.g., SEC v. Culpepper, 270
F.2d 241 (2d Cir. 1959) (Commission and its agents may not "waive" violations of federal law);

Capital Funds, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 582, 588 (8" Cir. 1965); SEC v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius,

 

209 F.2d 44 (3d Cir. 1953); Mines and Metals Corp. v. SEC, 200 F.2d 317 (9th Cir. 1952). It
follows that Defendants "do not have the right to rely on [Dr. Sirri] to tell them how to comply with

the securities laws, nor can they successfully assert the absence of such assistance as a defense."
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 6 of 18

SEC v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14669, *73-74 (D.D.C. 1978), aff'd, 629
F.2d 62 (D.C. Cir. 1980).

The testimony Defendants seek can have no bearing on the Court's resolution of this case
and is irrelevant. Where Defendants cannot lawfully use Dr. Sirri's testimony to establish any
defense, permitting this deposition to proceed will subject Dr. Sirri and the Commission to
annoyance, undue burden and expense.

II. Dr. Sirri's Testimony is Protected by the Government Deliberative Process Privilege

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 and 45(c)(3)(A) provide that a court may issue a
protective order to quash a subpoena if it requires the disclosure of privileged or other protected
matter, and no exception or waiver applies. Plaintiff asserts that the testimony of Dr. Sirri is
protected from discovery by the government deliberative process privilege. No exception or
waiver applies.

The deliberative process privilege protects materials that concern the "decision making
- processes of government agencies." NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150-51 (1975)
(disclosure of intra-agency deliberations and advice is injurious to federal government's decision-

- making functions because it tends to inhibit frank and candid discussion necessary to effective

government); see also International Paper Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n., 438 F.2d 1349, 1359 (2d

 

Cir. 1971) (there is a "privilege, customarily enjoyed by the Government in its litigations, against
having to reveal those internal working papers in which opinions are expressed and policies
formulated and recommended"); Dow Jones & Co. v. DOJ, 917 F.2d 571, 573 (D.C. Cir. 1990)
(the privilege is an "ancient privilege ... predicated on the recognition `that the quality of
administrative decision-making would be seriously undermined if agencies were forced to

operate in a fishbowl.''') (citation omitted). The privilege protects "advisory opinions,
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 7 of 18

recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which government decisions
and policies are formulated." Sears, 421 U.S. at 150 (citation omitted).

Thus, for example, the privilege "covers recommendations, draft documents, proposals,
suggestions, and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather
than the policy of the agency." Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir.
1980); see also Lawyers Comm. For Human Rights v. INS, 721 F. Supp. 552, 562 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)
(the privilege (embodied in 5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 552(b)(5)) "protects the important policies of `encouraging
full and candid intra-agency discussion and shielding from disclosure the mental processes of
executive and administrative officers.''') (citation omitted); Landfair v. Department of the Army,
645 F. Supp. 325, 330 (D.D.C. 1986) (privilege applies when information "would reveal the thought
process of the agency prior to the adoption of a specific course of conduct'). In addition, in some
circumstances, the disclosure of even factual material may expose the deliberative process within an
agency, such that it must be withheld as privileged: See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp. v. FTC, 406 F. Supp.
305, 315 (S.D.N.Y. 1976); Mead Data Central, Inc. v. Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 256 (D.C. Cir.
1977) (citing cases).

A court can override the deliberative process privilege only upon a showing that the
evidentiary need for the privileged material outweighs the public interest in protecting disclosure of
the agency's deliberations and deliberative process. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 231.
38 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (where documents may shed light on government misconduct, the privilege is
denied); Redland Soccer: Club, Inc. v. Department of the Army, 55 F.3d at 853, 854 (3d Cir. 1995)
(a district court, in balancing the interests, should consider at least the following factors: "(i) the
relevance of the evidence sought to be protected; (ii) the availability of other evidence; (iii) the

`seriousness' of the litigation and the issues involved; (iv) the role of the government in the
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 8 of 18

litigation; [and] (v) the possibility of future timidity by government employees who will be forced
to recognize that their secrets are violable.") (citation omitted).

Dr. Sirrt, in his role as Director of the Commission's Division of Trading and Markets, made
remarks to the Commission in a December 4, 2006 public meeting that concerned a proposed |
amendment to Rule 105. Those remarks are a matter of public record. (See
http://www.connectlive.com/events/secopenmeetings/2006index.html, at 1:25:10.) To the extent
that Dr. Sirri had internal communications with the Commission or its staff about his remarks or the
proposed amendment to Rule 105, those activities are the foundation for the Commission's
rulemaking and fall squarely within the scope of the deliberative process privilege.

To allow the defendants to depose Commission staff about Commission rulemaking will do
great harm to the Commission rulemaking for several reasons. Among other things, it will inhibit
candid discussions among the staff, if they know that each remark is a potential item of discovery.
And; it will result in a substantial burden and delay because Commission.employees will be subject
to numerous depositions that will take them away from their principal job responsibilities.
Furthermore, because the Commission's need to protect its internal deliberations far outweighs any
possible relevance of Dr. Sirri's testimony (which, indeed, is irrelevant), Defendants cannot -
overcome the privilege.

CONCLUSION

Dr. Sirri's testimony is entirely irrelevant to the present case. What is at issue are
Defendants' actions and whether they complied with federal securities laws. The Court should
quash the subpoena to prevent Defendants delving into irrelevant matters designed to delay and

distract from that which is genuinely at issue. Alternatively, the Court should grant the
Case 1:07-cv-08849-PKG Document 24 Filed 04/11/2008 Page 9 of 18

Commission's motion in view of the deliberative process privilege protections afforded Dr.
Sirri's internal Commission communications regarding the rule.

The Commission respectfully requests that the subpoena issued to Dr. Sirri be quashed.
A proposed Order is attached hereto as Exhibit C. In the alternative, the Commission requests

that the Court order the scope of the depositions be limited substantially.
