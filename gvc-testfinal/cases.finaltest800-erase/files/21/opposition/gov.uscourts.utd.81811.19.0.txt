Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
INTRODUCTION

This is the latest in a series of cases between Plaintiff Walter L. Wagner ("Plaintiff") and
Defendant WBGI. Up to this point, the litigation has been confined to the state courts of Nevada
and Hawaii. Having lost in every state court action, Plaintiff now seeks to involve the United
States District Court for the District of Utah in his ongoing campaign against Defendant WBGI.
Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint for Damages and Injunctive Relief (the "Complaint") is
nothing more than a restatement of facts, claims and issues previously litigated and resolved in
three prior state court actions.

SUMMARY OF PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT

Plaintiff's Complaint contains five state-law defamation claims and one corporate fraud,
waste and mismanagement claim. Plaintiffs defamation allegations cover three subject-matter
areas; (1) poor record-keeping; (2) misappropriation of WBGI funds; and (3) fraud in the
execution of a promissory note in 2004. In addition, Plaintiff alleges a separate claim based on
waste, fraud and mismanagement at Defendant WBGI.

(1) Poor Record-keeping. Defendant WBGI's allegedly stated that Plaintiff kept poor
shareholder records while in control of WBGI and that Plaintiffs poor record-keeping resulted in
an incomplete list of all Defendant WBGI shareholders. [Plaintiffs Complaint, Count I, { { 13-

16 and Count II, | 0x00A7 18- 19]

2 WBGI 03
 

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 3 of 20

(2) Misappropriation of WBGI Funds. Defendant WBGI's allegedly stated that
Plaintiff embezzled funds designated for use to construct a visitor center ("Visitor Center").
Defendant WBGI allegedly stated that there was no designated Visitor Center account and that
Plaintiff misappropriated investor funds for personal use. [Plaintiff's Complaint, Count UT, { {
21-24 and Count IV, 0x00A7 0x00A7 27 - 29]

(3) Fraudulent 2004 Promissory Note. Defendant WBGI allegedly stated that Plaintiff
fraudulently executed a promissory note from Defendant WBGI in favor of Plaintiff. Defendant
WBGI allegedly stated that Plaintiffs spouse executed the promissory note as an officer of
Defendant WBGI, but was in fact not an officer of Defendant WBGI. [Plaintiff's Complaint,
Count V, 9931 - 37]

(4) Waste, Fraud and Mismanagement. Plaintiff asks this Court to appoint a receiver
and replace the existing Board based on Defendant WBGI's alleged: (a) failure to build a Visitor -
Center; (b) refusal to pay money owed to Plaintiff; (c) expenditure of attorneys' fees to prosecute
and defend state court cases; (d) the use of Visitor Center funds for attorneys' fees; and (e) the
sale or transfer of property for inadequate consideration. [Plaintiffs Complaint, Count VI 4 { 40
- 64]

BACKGROUND AND STATE COURT CASES
Defendant WBGI is a small business which owns and operates a botanical garden in the

State of Hawaii. Defendant WBGI has a Board of Directors (the "Board"), which are the named

8 WBGI 03
 

 

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 4 of 20

individual defendants in this lawsuit. Plaintiff originally formed Defendant WBGI, but was
eventually removed when the Board discovered Plaintiff's grave and ongoing misconduct.
Plaintiffs misconduct is detailed in three state court decisions':

(1) World Botanical Gardens, Inc. v. Walter Wagner, et al.; Second Judicial District for
the State of Nevada, Washoe County; Case No. CV05-02079, dated October 2, 2006. [Docket #
7; Exhibit 1] (the decision shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Nevada Judgment" and the
court as the "Nevada Court");

(2) Walter L. Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc.; Third Circuit Court for the State
of Hawaii; Civil No. 04-01-0232, dated November 13, 2007. [Docket # 7; Exhibit 2] (the
decision will hereinafter be referred to as the "First Hawaii Judgment" and the court as the "First
Hawaii Court"; Plaintiff's appeal is pending before the Hawaii Court of Appeals); and

(3) World Botanical Gardens, Inc. v. Walter Wagner, et al.; Third Circuit for the State of
Hawaii; Case No. 05-01-0210, dated October 9, 2008. [Docket # 7; Exhibit 3] (the decision will
hereinafter be referred to as the "Second Hawaii Judgment" and the court as the "Second Hawaii
Court"). Plaintiffs Petition for Certiorari is pending before the Hawaii Supreme Court.

After the Board removed Plaintiff, Plaintiff attempted to create a separate Board, and

challenged the legitimacy of the Board which had removed him. Plaintiff's challenge to the

 

1 Defendant WBGI attached the three decisions to Defendant WBGI's Memorandum in
Support of Motion to Dismiss [Docket # 7], respectively as Exhibits 1,2 and 3. Defendant
WBGI requested the Court take judicial notice of theses three decisions, and incorporates that
request and supporting argument herein.

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 5 of 20

Board consisted of a list of misdeeds including, but not limited to, diversion of corporate funds to
personal accounts, failure to keep proper financial records, failure to pay employment taxes and
failure to keep accurate records of shareholders. The Nevada Court characterized Plaintiff' s
actions as a "relentless conspiracy and campaign . . . to gain control of WBGI at any cost."
[Docket # 7; Exhibit 1, pgs. 2-3, J 6]

As a result of Plaintiff's misconduct, Defendant WBGI filed an action in the State of
Nevada, Defendant WBGI's state of incorporation. Defendant WBGI sought to resolve issues
related to the Board's authority and the propriety of Plaintiff's conduct. After a three day trial,
the Nevada Court ruled that Defendant WBGI's removal of Plaintiff was proper and that the
Board had properly managed the business and affairs of Defendant WBGI. As part of its ruling,
the Nevada Court found that Plaintiff diverted corporate funds to personal accounts, failed to
keep proper financial records, failed to pay employment taxes and failed to keep accurate records
of shareholders. In addition, the Nevada Court stated that Plaintiff "intentionally and illegally
engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell shares of WBGI stock to unsuspecting purchasers."
[Docket # 7; Exhibit # 1, pg. 7, { 27] |

Plaintiff's behavior resulted in the Nevada Court issuing an Order of Contempt against

Plaintiff after its initial ruling". The Court ruled that Plaintiff violated its Injunction by engaging

 

2 Attached as Exhibit #1 is the "Order of Contempt" from the Second Judicial District
Court of the State of Nevada, Case No. CV05-02079 dated October 5, 2006. Defendant WBGI
requests that the Court take judicial notice of this document pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 201.

10 WBGI 03
 

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 6 of 20

in fraudulent sales of Defendant WBGI's stock. "The Court finds that this type of intentional
deception is characteristic of all of the improper and fraudulent share sales by Defendants Walter
Wagner and Dan Perkins." [Exhibit 1; pg. 7] The Nevada Court, taken aback by Plaintiff's
conduct, stated:

Defendants Walter Wagner and Dan Perkins, shockingly, were unable to state

how many shares of stock they had sold, unable to state the purchase price they

had received for the stock they had sold, and were unable to account for the

disposition of funds received from innocent and unsuspecting victims.

[Exhibit 1; pg. 8]

The Nevada Court found Plaintiff in contempt, ordered a "complete accounting of all
shares sold of any stock or any interest .. . ." [Exhibit 1; pg. 9], and imposed a constructive trust
on all proceeds collected by Plaintiff from the fraudulent stock sales.

Plaintiff did not comply with the Nevada Court's order to produce an accounting, which
not surprisingly resulted in another contempt order'. The Nevada Court sentenced Plaintiff to 90
days in jail and ordered Plaintiff to hold $281,216.00 in constructive trust for the defrauded
investors. The Nevada Court was clearly exasperated:

it doesn't seem to matter what any court does. It doesn't seem to matter that one

judge in Hawaii, this judge in Nevada on twice, two, and now three occasions has
told him that his view of life is not true.

 

3 Attached as Exhibit # 2 is the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order of
Contempt, and Judgment of Contempt from the Second Judicial District Court of the State of
Nevada, Case No. CV 05-2079 dated February 7, 2007 and Transcript of Proceedings; Order of
the Court; August 21, 2006, Case No. CV05-02079. Defendant WBGI requests that the Court
take judicial notice of this document pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 201.

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 7 of 20

The facts he asserts are not correct. He just continues to behave as though he runs
the corporation, and he engages in every kind of act possible to prevent those
authorized and elected to manage the corporation from doing so.

The Court's frustration in this case is not what result might be warranted by the
law and the facts, my frustration is how any court anywhere can enforce any order
that might be an inducement to Mr. Wagner, who has a legal degree, to recognize
the efficacy of legal decisions and comply with them.

[Exhibit C; pg. 6 - 7]

Unfortunately, Plaintiff did not stop here. Plaintiffs misconduct continued in the form of
vexatious litigation, which was the subject of yet another Nevada Court order'. The Nevada
Court found that Plaintiff, as a vexatious litigant:

abused the civil legal process by making misrepresentations to this and other
courts in both Nevada and Hawaii, by making misrepresentations to opposing
counsel, by ignoring orders and judgments of this Court, by failing to disclose
and/or concealing information from opposing counsel and this Court, by filing
voluminous legal pleadings replete with misrepresentations and false statements,
and by attempting to relitigate issues in both this Court and other courts which this
Court and other courts have long-ago resolved after both a preliminary injunction
hearing and a trial on the merits.

[Exhibit D; pg. 9].

Two Hawaii court actions followed the Nevada case. In the First Hawaii Court, Plaintiff
sued Defendant WBGI to recover funds Plaintiff claims he was owed pursuant to a promissory

note purportedly executed by Defendant WBGI. [Docket # 7; Exhibit #2; 7 1] The First Hawaii

 

4 Attached as Exhibit # 3 is the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order from the
Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada; Case No. CV05-02079; dated June 14,
2007. Defendant WBGI requests that the Court take judicial notice of this document pursuant to
Fed.R.Evid. 201.

l WBGI 03
 

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 8 of 20

Court ruled against Plaintiff finding that "[t]he 2004 promissory note which purported to
incorporate and merge all of the prior promissory notes, was fraudulently created." [Docket # 7;
Exhibit # 2; pg. 16; 4 5].

Defendant WBGI then sued Plaintiff in the Second Hawaii Court to recover funds
improperly diverted and misappropriated by Plaintiff. [Docket #7, Exhibit 3] The Second Hawaii
Court found Plaintiff liable for conversion and misappropriation of corporate funds. [Docket # 7;
Exhibit # 3; pg. 6; 5] The Second Hawaii Court also declared Plaintiff a vexatious litigant:
"As with the Court in Washoe County, Nevada, this Court has witnessed an abuse of the legal
system and repeated misconduct by [Plaintiff]" [Docket # 7; Exhibit # 3; pg. 40; { 132]

Plaintiff s campaign against Defendant WBGI continued with the filing of Plaintiff's
Complaint herein. Plaintiff now asks this Court to enjoin Defendant WBGI to refrain from
publishing (1) an indictment issued by a Hawaii Grand Jury against Plaintiff for attempted theft
and identity theft; and (2) rulings from three state courts finding Plaintiff engaged in misconduct
with respect to Defendant WBGI. Plaintiff also demands Defendant WBGI publish a retraction
of the aforementioned documents.

Plaintiff fails to meet the four requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.
In addition, Defendant WBGI has already removed the Hawaii Indictment from its website.
Defendant WBGI also advised Defendant WBGI shareholders that the State of Hawaii did not
pursue the Indictment against Plaintiff and was, therefore dismissed. The civil decisions from

the states of Hawaii and Nevada all relate to litigation between Plaintiff and Defendant WBGI

2 WBGI 03
 

 

 

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 9 of 20

and are appropriately the subject of Defendant WBGI's website to shareholders.
POINT I

DEFENDANT WBGI REMOVED THE HAWAII INDICTMENT FROM ITS WEBSITE
RENDERING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOOT.

 

It is well-settled that "to grant Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, the request
must not be moot." Flynn v. Lee, 2011 WL 5865851 *3 (SDNY. Civ No 11-5311 Nov. 15,
2011). Plaintiff asks this Court to enjoin Defendant WBGI from publishing a copy of an
Indictment brought against Plaintiff by the State of Hawaii arising out of his activities with
Defendant WBGI. This claim is moot because Defendant WBGI removed the Indictment from
its website in September of 2011. In addition, Defendant WBGI informed its shareholders that
there were no longer criminal charges pending against Plaintiff.

POINT I

PLAINTIFFE'S PROPOSED INJUNCTION VIOLATES DEFENDANT WBGI'S FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

The United States Supreme Court cautioned that a preliminary injunction "is an
extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right." Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555
USS. 7, 24, 129 S.Ct. 365, 376, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). Further, "[b]ecause it constitutes drastic
relief to be provided with caution, a preliminary injunction should be granted only in cases where
the necessity for it is clearly established." United States v. Enterprise Management Consultants,
883 F.2d 886, 888-889 (10" Cir. 1989).

Plaintiff bears a heavy burden, especially here, where Plaintiff seeks to enjoin allegedly

3 WBGI 03
 

 

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 19 Filed 11/28/11 Page 10 of 20

defamatory statements. "A preliminary injunction is a prior restraint, and as such, bears a heavy
presumption against its constitutional validity." Bihari v. Gross, 119 F.Supp.2d 309, 324
(S.D.N.Y. 2000)(internal citations and quotations omitted). The Second Circuit observed that:
"Equity will not restrain by injunction the threatened publication of a libel, as such, however
great the injury to property may be. This is the universal rule in the United States and was
formerly the rule in England." American Malting Co. v. Keitel, 209 F. 351, 354 (2d Cir. 1913).

In the instant case, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the publication of public documents from
three different state courts. At issue are three civil judgments and one criminal indictment. The
content of the speech addresses allegations of Plaintiff's fraudulent conduct with respect to
Defendant WBGI. Thus, the proposed injunction would impair speech concerning allegations of
fraud at corporation, a matter of some public importance.

For example, one federal court refused to grant a preliminary injunction where the speech
involved "fraud of a well-known interior designer." Bihari v. Gross, 119 F.Supp.2d 309, 325 -
326 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)(internal citations and quotations omitted). The court reasoned that "TsJuch
speech is arguably within the sphere of legitimate public concern, which imbues the speech with
a heavy presumption of constitutional protection." Id, at 325 - 326.

Similarly, the three state court decisions related to Plaintiff's fraudulent misconduct are
matters of legitimate public concern. Certainly, they are of particular concern to Defendant
WBGI's shareholders. Therefore, the Court should deny Plaintiff's request for a preliminary

injunction on the grounds that such an injunction would constitute an impermissible prior
