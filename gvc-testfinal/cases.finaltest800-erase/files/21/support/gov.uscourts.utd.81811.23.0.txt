SUPPLEMENTAL AFFIDAVIT OF CALVIN N. ANDRUS IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I, Calvin N. Andrus, affirm state and declare under penalty of perjury of the
laws of the State of Utah as follows:
1. | am appalled at the attitude of the management of WBGI in the manner in
which they are treating some very serious charges. It is very clear, from reading
the sworn affidavits filed by plaintiff Walter L. Wagner, that he was maligned
when WBGI published on our website the indictment they had obtained, long
after it was dismissed by the Court in Hawaii. He was also maligned when Mr.
Michie ascribed to him the theft of the Visitor Center funds, when it is apparent
that one or more of the defendants removed those funds, and the defendants
are attempting to cover it up.
2. When plaintiff Wagner undertook this project, my 200 shares were worth
$30/share in 1994. After nearly ten years of dedicated effort on his part, he had
constructed the botanical garden and made it a wonderful tourist attraction,
such that company shares were selling for $520/share in 2004 when he left the
management. | was very pleased with what he had done, and with the large
increase in share value.
3. Then, just two years later, under the new management team, in 2006

WBGI was selling shares at only $250/share. Now, | believe they have become

 
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 23 Filed 12/02/11 Page 3 of 4

essentially worthless, since the current management team has since sold off
90% of the land holdings plaintiff Wagner had accumulated for WBGI
shareholders, and appears to have placed substantial liens on the remaining
10%. Moreover, tourism at the garden now appears to be at about 50% of its
high value in 2004, notwithstanding an overall increase in tourism to the Big
Island since 2004.

4. It is appalling that this management team believes they have the right to
consistently malign the botanical garden founder, falsely obtain an indictment
against him by what appears to be clear lying by defendant Francik, and falsely
claim he stole the Visitor Center funds in order to cover up the embezzlement of
those funds by one or more of the defendants.

5. | could care less about how he appropriated funds while he served as the
WBGI president. The value of his efforts is what counts, and that was reflected
in the strong increase in the value of the shares. However, that being said, | do
not believe any of the allegations of "misappropriation" made against him by this
management team. The types of appropriations he was making were clearly
proper corporate expenditures, not "misappropriations", and the fact that he was
unable to defend himself against those scurrilous charges by the chicanery of

some of the defendants simply shows that he was set-up.

 
Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 23 Filed 12/02/11 Page 4 of 4

6. | urge this Court to consider how the shareholders feel about what this
management team is doing to their investment. | also urge this Court to require
that this management team not only remove the legal pleadings from our
website, as they have no valid purpose being there some seven years after this
current team took over management. They are only there to continue the
maligning of the garden founder, and for no other fathomable reason, when he
has no opportunity to respond. Since it is clear that some, if not all, of the
postings are false, | believe it is proper for this Court to post the requested
`Corrective' submitted by the plaintiff.

7. | also urge this Court to do everything within its power to investigate who
Stole the Visitor Center funds from that account, and have that person or
persons held accountable.

DATED: December 2, 2011
