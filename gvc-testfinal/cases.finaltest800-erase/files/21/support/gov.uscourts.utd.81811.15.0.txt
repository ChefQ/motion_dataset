MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Introduction
As injunctions are equitable remedies whose grant or denial in each case
is governed by principles of equity 1 , the rights or subjects that properly lie within
the power of a court of equity to control or protect by injunction are the same as
those over which equity jurisdiction extends generally.2 The principles of right,
justice, and morality create equitable claims. A court of equity does not create
rights but rather determines whether lega.l rights exist, and if so, whether it is
proper and just to enforce those rights. 3 Injunctive relief is granted not as a
matter of right but in the exercise of sound judicial discretion. 4
In proper circumstances, injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy against
malicious interference with business relationships. 5

The right to carry on

business without obstruction is a property right and acts committed without just

cause that interfere with the carrying on of business constitute an irreparable
injury warranting injunctive relief.6
Specific Relief Sought Allowable in Federal Court
A federal district court has wide discretion to fashion appropriate injunctive
relief in a particular case? The elements of a cause of action for injunctive relief
involving a tort are the 1) tort itself and 2) an irreparable injury that cannot be
compensated by an ordinary damage award. 8 Equity will restrain publication of
false and defamatory words where publication is the means incident to such
tortious conduct. 9
Particular cases exactly on point show that injunctive relief should be
granted to prohibit a defendant from reiterating statements that had been found

in a current or prior legal proceeding to be false and libelous so as to prevent
future injury to a plaintiff's personal reputation and business relationships.10
In the instant matter, defendants are reiterating and republishing an
"indictment" as if it were being presently charged against plaintiff herein, even
though they know full well that it was dismissed in its entirety more than one
year ago and that it was based on falsehoods which they themselves
orchestrated to be presented to a grand jury to obtain issuance of that
"indictment". Notwithstanding their full knowledge of the falsity thereof, and the
discontinuance of prosecution thereof, they continue to publish it to plaintiff's
business associates (shareholders of WBGI) for the express purpose of placing
him in a false light. Moreover, they urge upon this court that they have the right
to do so, and that this Court has no authority to order them to remove such
libelous content from their internet website.
Injunctive relief restraining the publication of matter defaming a plaintiff
personally is proper where there is no adequate remedy at law because of the
continuing nature of the defendant's invasions of a plaintiff's rights and the
difficulty of evaluating the injuries in monetary terms.11

relief will restrain the publication of false and defamatory words where
publication is the means of the tortious conduct. 12
The "indictment" document published by defendants herein specifically
alleges that plaintiff herein committed two felonies, "attempted theft" and
"identity theft".

This is false and defamatory and is being published as the

means of the tortious conduct.

Moreover, and more importantly, it is being

published for the express purpose of setting forth the falsehood that the State of
Hawai'i is continuing to charge plaintiff herein with such felonies, which such is
patently false, in that those charges were thoroughly litigated in that prior
criminal proceeding, found utterly wanting, and the case dismissed. It is being
published to plaintiff's friends, business associates and prospective business
associates to expressly cause him harm to those relationships.
It is that false promotion that the State of Hawai'i is presently charging
plaintiff herein with felonies that is the most damaging, as such alleged State
action would tend to support the false claims by defendants that plaintiff
committed those felonies, when no such evidence whatsoever exists, and no
such felonies were committed, and the basis of the issuance of the "indictment"
was the lying to the grand jury by one of the defendants (Francik).

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 15 Filed 11/16/11 Page 6 of 7

Clearly, the State of Hawai'i is not charging plaintiff with any felony (nor is
it yet charging defendant Francik with the felony of lying to that grand jury). For
defendants to publish on their internet website that plaintiff is being charged with
a felony by the State of Hawai'i constitutes a false and defamatory publication
for which this Court has ample jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief.
Likewise, the other 'legal documents' they have posted on their website
are posted there for the purpose of giving the impression that plaintiff Wagner
engaged in civil wrongdoing for which they are owed monies.

In fact, those

cases are presently active cases for which, unlike the criminal "indictment" that
is now dismissed in its entirety, they are presently pending. It is expected that
the appellate courts of Hawai'i will also recognize the frauds worked upon the
trial courts, and reverse those judgments.

Because those preliminary

judgments are false and libelous, it is also respectfully requested that this court
fashion appropriate injunctive relief to have all 'legal pleadings' removed from
defendant's internet website.

Conclusion
Because of the lengthy period of the defamation (plaintiff is uncertain
when the "indictment" document was initially published on defendant's website,

as he only learned of it after filing the original complaint herein), as will be
ascertained either at the hearing of this motion or later, it is further requested
that in fashioning the appropriate injunctive relief that this Court take steps to
mitigate against the damage already done. Speci'fically, it is requested that this
Court further order a 'Corrective" to be placed on defendant's website, in lieu of
the false and defamatory pleadings placed thereon, in which it states that the
pleadings were removed because some were known to be false and obtained
by fraud, and that the State of Hawai'i is not prosecuting plaintiff herein. It is
requested that this 'Corrective' be left in place on the website for the same
period of time that the other 'pleading documents' have been in place on that
website. This is in accord with this Court's inherent authority to exercise its
equitable discretion, discussed supra, to fashion an appropriate remedy.
