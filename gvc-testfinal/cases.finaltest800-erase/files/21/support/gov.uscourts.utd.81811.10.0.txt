COMES NOW PLAINTIFF WALTER L. WAGNER and respectfully moves
this Court for preliminary injunctive relief in accordance with the First Amended
Complaint for Damages and Injunctive Relief filed herein on October 4, 2011

and served on defendant WBGI on October 18, 2011 by Kelly Tmakiung,
certified civil process server.
Plaintiff respectfully moves for injunctive relief specifically enjoining
defendant WBGI from placing on its website any materials that are defamatory
towards plaintiff, and mandating that they remove from their website existing
defamatory materials, including but not limited to a copy of an "Indictment"
naming plaintiff Walter L. Wagner that was dismissed in its entirety more than
one year ago, a copy of a "Judgment" obtained in Hilo, Hawaii that was obtained
by active fraud on the part of WBGI and which is currently pending review in the
Hawaii courts based upon that fraud, a copy of a "Judgment" obtained in Reno,
Nevada that was also obtained by the active fraud of defendant WBGI, and all
related legal pleadings, transcripts, or other materials pertaining to those
"indictments" and "judgments".
Plaintiff further respectfully moves this Court for an order mandating the
placement of a IICorrective" on the WBGI website in the shareholder section,
wherein those false and defamatory materials have been lodged, stating that
plaintiff Walter L. Wagner was erroneously indicted based upon false

of any criminal activity of plaintiff Walter L Wagner, with the exact wording to be
submitted at the conclusion of the hearing of this motion.
Plaintiff further respectfully moves this court for an order mandating that
defendants make no further communications to the WBGI shareholders or
others in which they either impugn the character of plaintiff, or otherwise imply
that plaintiff engaged in theft, embezzlement or unlawful diversion of either
Visitor

Center account funds

or other WBGI

funds,

and

that

any

communications to WBGI shareholders or others with respect to plaintiff Walter
L Wagner be first submitted to this Court for approval.
This motion is based upon the amended complaint and this notice, upon
the accompanying affidavits in support, upon the accompanying points and
authorities in support, upon all other pleadings filed herein, and upon such other
and further evidence and testimony as may be presented at the hearing of this
motion.
