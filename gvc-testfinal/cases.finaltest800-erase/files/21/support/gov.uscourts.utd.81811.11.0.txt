AFFIDAVIT OF CALVIN N.
ANDRUS IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Han, Brooke C, Wells

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 11 Filed 11/09/11 Page 2 of 4

AFFIDAVIT OF CALVIN N. ANDRUS IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
I, Calvin N. Andrus, affirm state and declare under penalty of perjury of the
laws of the State of Utah as follows:
1.

I am over the age of eighteen and not a party to the above-entitled action.

2.

I am one of the founders of WBGI, having worked closely with plaintiff

Walter L. Wagner on establishing the gardens when he began the project in
1994. I am also a shareholder ofWBGI, owning approximately 1% (200 shares)
of the issued shares.
Mismanagement of WBGI Qatabase
3.

Earlier this year I was informed by plaintiff Wagner that the current

management of WBGI was deleting shareholders from the WBGI database for
no valid reason, and that possibly records of my share ownership had also been
deleted. Concerned, I sent an email to Mr. Steve Bryant, who was listed as the
current WBGI President, inquiring about the status of my shares and the
gardens.
4.

In response to my email, he emailed me back asserting that he could find

no evidence of my share ownership in WBGI, requesting that I provide some
form of proof of ownership.

In essence, he gave the impression that plaintiff

Case 2:11-cv-00784-CW-PMW Document 11 Filed 11/09/11 Page 3 of 4

Wagner maintained shareholder records by the use of 'post-it-notes', and that
was the reason he could not find evidence of my share ownership.
5.

Contrary to Mr. Bryant's assertion to me, I have seen the shareholder

database printout 'from January 2005 in which my name and shares were
properly listed. I have also seen several earlier printouts in which my name and
shares were also properly listed. Those printouts were maintained by plaintiff
Wagner while he was in management at WBGI, which position he left in 2004.
Apparently, Mr. Bryant did not have access to that 2005 database. I have not
seen the database Mr. Bryant uses.
6.

Neither Mr. Bryant nor any of the other defendants have asked me for a

copy of that 2005 shareholder database that I obtained 'from plaintiff Wagner,
though I am willing to provide him with the correct records that had been
maintained by plaintiff Wagner.
Waste, Fraud and Mismanagement
7.

I have read the sworn allegations of the complaint, as well as the sworn

affidavit of Mr. Dan Perkins.

I am appalled at the waste, fraud and

mismanagement of WBGI by parties who are supposed to be looking out for my
stock interest while managing WBGI. Parties responsible for that theft of funds,
or its cover-up, should be immediately removed from WBGI management.

Conclusion
8.

The conduct of publicly maligning the founder of WBGI with false

allegations is absolutely reprehensible.

WBGI has no business posting an

"indictment" on its website when that indictment was dismissed and was based
on false testimony.

This maligning has apparently been ongoing, necessitating

the issuance of an injunction, which I fully support. Moreover. this Court should
conduct a hearing into the theft of the Visitor Center account funds, and remove
from WBGI management those persons responsible for the theft and its cover­
up.
9.

I will be available to testify as to the defamation of plaintiff Wagner that I

personally observed by way of my email exchange with Mr. Bryant. While I do
not have direct knowledge of the theft of the WBGI Visitor Center account funds,
as I was not active in WBGI management at that time, I will also be available to
give testimony as to the early history of WBGI's formation, and as a character
witness on behalf of plaintiff Wagner, and the apparent drastic loss of share
valuation after plaintiff Wagner left WBGI.
