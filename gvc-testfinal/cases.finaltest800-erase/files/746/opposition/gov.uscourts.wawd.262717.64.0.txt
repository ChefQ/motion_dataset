INTRODUCTION
The manufacture or possession of plastic guns that are undetectable is a serious federal

3

crime, punishable by up to five years in prison. Among other statutes, the Undetectable

4

Firearms Act prohibits the manufacture, possession, sale, import, or transfer of undetectable

5

firearms. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(p). The Department of Justice, among other agencies, enforces

6

that prohibition, and will continue to do so vigorously. Neither those enforcement efforts nor

7

the prohibition itself is affected in any way by the actions challenged in this case.

8

This case is not about the regulation of U.S. persons who wish to utilize a 3D printer to

9

manufacture their own small-caliber firearms. Rather, this case concerns the Department of

10

State’s delegated authority to control the export of defense articles and services, or technical

11

data related thereto, that raise military or intelligence concerns. The Department is tasked with

12

determining what technology and weaponry provides a critical military or intelligence

13

advantage such that it should not be shipped without restriction from the United States to other

14

countries (or otherwise provided to foreigners), where, beyond the reach of U.S. law, it could

15

be used to threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, or international peace and stability.

16

Domestic activities that do not involve providing access to foreign persons, by contrast, are left

17

to other federal agencies—and the states—to regulate.

18

In bringing their motion for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs misunderstand the

19

fundamental limit on the State Department’s authority. According to Plaintiffs, the

20

Government’s export-related determinations—specifically with respect to the export of

21

technical data developed by Defense Distributed—have jeopardized their ability to protect the

22

safety and health of their residents. But the domestic harms about which Plaintiffs are

23

allegedly concerned are not properly regulated by the Department under current law. Plaintiffs’

24

allegations of harm are not reasonably attributable to the Department’s regulation of exports,

25

but rather focus on the possibility that third parties will commit violations of the Undetectable

26

Firearms Act or other relevant laws that are not at issue in this case. Likewise, Plaintiffs have

27

failed to demonstrate that the facts and law clearly favor their position with respect to the

merits of their claims, or that it is in the public interest for the Court to second-guess the

2

national security determinations of the Executive Branch.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied.

BACKGROUND

5
6

I.

Statutory And Regulatory Background
The Arms Export Control Act (“AECA”), 22 U.S.C. § 2751 et seq., authorizes the

7

President, “[i]n furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United

8

States” to “control the import and the export of defense articles and defense services” and to

9

promulgate regulations accordingly. 22 U.S.C. § 2778(a)(1) (emphasis added). The President

10

has delegated this authority to the Department in relevant part, and the Department has

11

accordingly promulgated the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), which are

12

administered by the Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). See Exec.

13

Order No. 13637(n)(i), 78 Fed. Reg. 16,129 (Mar. 8, 2013); 22 C.F.R. §§ 120-130. At the heart

14

of the AECA is the United States Munitions List (“USML”), an extensive listing of materials

15

that constitute “defense articles and defense services” under the ITAR. See 22 C.F.R. Part 121.

16

As relevant here, Category I of the USML includes all firearms up to .50 caliber, and all

17

technical data directly related to such firearms. Id. § 121.1(I)(a), (i). Technical data is

18

information that “is required for the design, development, production, manufacture, assembly,

19

operation, repair, testing, maintenance or modification of defense articles.” Id. § 120.10(a)(1).

20

Section 2778 of the AECA authorizes the President (1) to designate those defense articles and

21

services to be included on the USML; (2) to require licenses for the export of items on the

22

USML; and (3) to promulgate regulations for the import and export of such items on the

23

USML. 22 U.S.C. § 2778.

24

The ITAR does not regulate any transfers of defense articles except those that constitute

25

“exports,” i.e., the transfer of defense articles abroad or to foreign persons, and “temporary

26

imports.” The ITAR’s definition of exports includes, in part (1) “[s]ending or taking of a

27

defense article out of the United States in any manner,” 22 C.F.R. § 120.17(a)(1); (2)

1

“[r]eleasing or otherwise transferring a defense article to an embassy or to any of its agencies or

2

subdivisions, such as a diplomatic mission or consulate, in the United States,” id.

3

§ 120.17(a)(4); and (3) “[r]eleasing or otherwise transferring technical data to a foreign person

4

in the United States (a ‘deemed export’),” id. § 120.17(a)(2).
In certain cases where it is unclear whether a particular item is a defense article or

5
6

defense service, the Department makes a “commodity jurisdiction” (“CJ”) determination using

7

a procedure set forth in the ITAR. See id. § 120.4. Upon written request, DDTC will provide

8

applicants with a determination as to whether the item, service, or data is within the scope of

9

the ITAR. These assessments are made on a case-by-case basis through an inter-agency

10

process, evaluating whether the item, service, or data is covered by the USML, provides the

11

equivalent performance capabilities of a defense article on the USML, or has a critical military

12

or intelligence advantage. See id. § 120.4(d).
While the AECA and ITAR do not provide the State Department with authority to

13
14

prohibit the domestic manufacture or possession of 3D-printed guns, there are other federal

15

statutes that deal with this topic. Most significantly, the Undetectable Firearms Act bars the

16

manufacture, possession, sale, import, or transfer of undetectable firearms. See 18 U.S.C.

17

§ 922(p); An Act to Extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 Years, Pub. L. No.

18

113-57, 127 Stat. 656 (2013). Under that statute, firearms manufactured or sold in the United

19

States must generally be capable of being detected by metal detectors and by x-ray machines.

20

See 18 U.S.C. § 922(p)(1). Those requirements are not in any way affected by the actions

21

challenged in this case, nor are the separate federal prohibitions on the possession of firearms

22

by felons, persons subject to restraining orders, or the mentally ill. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)

23

(felons and certain state-law misdemeanants); id. § 922(g)(8) (court-issued restraining orders);

24

id. § 922(g)(4) (persons adjudicated as mentally ill). The Government continues to enforce

25

these laws in order to address domestic safety issues related to undetectable firearms. The

26

Department’s determination under the ITAR at issue here will not affect those enforcement

27

efforts.

II.

The Government’s Settlement With Defense Distributed
In 2012, Defense Distributed published on the Internet “privately generated technical

3

data regarding a number of gun-related items.” Def. Distributed v. Dep’t of State, 121 F. Supp.

4

3d 680, 687 (W.D. Tex. 2015). In May 2013, DDTC sent Defense Distributed a letter stating

5

that Defense Distributed may have released ITAR-controlled technical data without the

6

required authorization. See id. Defense Distributed removed the technical data and submitted a

7

CJ request. Id. The company, however, and in conjunction with another non-profit, the Second

8

Amendment Foundation, ultimately brought a lawsuit against, inter alia, the Department and

9

DDTC, claiming that the requirement to obtain authorization prior to publishing the subject

10

files on its website violated plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Second, and Fifth Amendments

11

and exceeded the Department’s statutory authority. Id. at 688.

12

In August 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas denied

13

Defense Distributed’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Id. at 701. For purposes of the

14

preliminary injunction analysis, the district court considered the files to be subject to the

15

protection of the First Amendment. Id. at 691-92. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court

16

concluded that “because the AECA and ITAR do not prohibit domestic communications” and

17

plaintiffs remained “free to disseminate the computer files at issue domestically,” they had not

18

shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Id. at 695.

19

The Fifth Circuit affirmed in a split decision. See 838 F.3d 451 (5th Cir. 2016).

20

Focusing narrowly on the question of the non-merits requirements for preliminary relief, the

21

panel majority concluded that the “Department’s stated interest in preventing foreign nationals

22

. . . from obtaining technical data on how to produce weapons and weapon parts” outweighed

23

plaintiffs’ interest in their constitutional rights. Id. at 458-59. The panel majority “decline[d]

24

to address the merits” because plaintiffs’ failure to meet any single requirement for a

25

preliminary injunction would require affirmance of the district court. See id. at 456-58. A

26

dissent from the panel opinion did address the merits. See id. at 461 (Jones, J. dissenting).

27

“[F]or the benefit of the district court on remand,” the dissent set forth an analysis concluding

that “the State Department’s application of its ‘export’ control regulations to this domestic

2

Internet posting appears to violate the governing statute, represents an irrational interpretation

3

of the regulations, and violates the First Amendment as a content-based regulation and a prior

4

restraint.” Id. at 463-64.

5

After plaintiffs’ petitions for rehearing en banc and for certiorari were denied, see 138

6

S. Ct. 638 (2018); 865 F.3d 211 (5th Cir. 2017) (5 dissenting judges), proceedings resumed in

7

district court. In April 2018, the Government moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ second amended

8

complaint. See Def. Distributed, No. 1:15-cv-372-RP, Dkt. No. 92. Meanwhile, the district

9

court ordered the parties to exchange written settlement demands, see id., Dkt. No. 88, thereby

10

initiating a process under which the parties were able to reach a settlement before briefing on

11

the motion to dismiss was complete, see id., Dkt. Nos. 93, 95.

12

Pursuant to the settlement and as relevant here, the Government agreed to the following:

13

(a)

Defendants’ commitment to draft and to fully pursue, to the extent
authorized by law (including the Administrative Procedure Act), the
publication in the Federal Register of a notice of proposed rulemaking and
final rule, revising USML Category I to exclude the technical data that is
the subject of the Action.[1]

(b)

Defendants’ announcement, while the above-referenced final rule is in
development, of a temporary modification, consistent with the . . . (ITAR),
22 C.F.R. § 126.2, of USML Category I to exclude the technical data that
is the subject of the Action. The announcement will appear on the DDTC
website, www.pmddtc.state.gov, on or before July 27, 2018.[2]

See Section III, infra. At the time settlement negotiations began, the parties had long expected such a Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) to be issued. See 78 Fed. Reg. 22,740, 22,741 (April 16, 2013) (announcing
that “[t]he Department intends to publish final rules implementing the revised USML categories and related ITAR
amendments periodically”). Reflecting nearly a decade of efforts to carry out a reform of export regulations and
pursuant to a “comprehensive review” of the U.S. export control system, the Government has undertaken an
Export Control Reform Initiative (“ECRI”) that was proposed in April 2010, see Fact Sheet on the President’s
Export Control Reform Initiative (Apr. 20, 2010), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/factsheet-presidents-export-control-reform-initiative, and facilitated by Executive Order No. 13637, 78 Fed. Reg.
16,129 (Mar. 8, 2013). By January 20, 2017, this export reform process had been completed for USML categories
IV through XX.

Pursuant to 22 C.F.R. § 126.2, “[t]he Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense Trade Controls may order the
temporary suspension or modification of any or all of the regulations of this subchapter in the interest of the
security and foreign policy of the United States.”

(c)

Defendants’ issuance of a letter to Plaintiffs on or before July 27, 2018,
signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense Trade Controls,
advising that the Published Files, Ghost Gunner Files, and CAD Files are
approved for public release (i.e., unlimited distribution) in any form and
are exempt from the export licensing requirements of the ITAR because
they satisfy the criteria of 22 C.F.R. § 125.4(b)(13). . . .

(d)

Defendants’ acknowledgment and agreement that the temporary
modification . . . permits any United States person, to include DD’s
customers and SAF’s members, to access, discuss, use, reproduce, or
otherwise benefit from the technical data that is the subject of the Action,
and that the letter to Plaintiffs permits any such person to access, discuss,
use, reproduce or otherwise benefit from the Published Files, Ghost
Gunner Files, and CAD Files.

12

Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. See id. ¶ 28.

13

III.

14

The Government’s Proposed Rulemaking
On May 24, 2018—after the initial exchange of settlement offers but more than one

15

month prior to the settlement with Defense Distributed—the Departments of State and

16

Commerce each issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPRM”) that implicated the

17

technical data at issue in Defense Distributed. See 83 Fed. Reg. 24,198 (May 24, 2018); 83

18

Fed. Reg. 24,166 (May 24, 2018). In those NPRMs, the Government proposed amending the

19

ITAR “to revise Categories I (firearms, close assault weapons and combat shotguns), II (guns

20

and armament) and III (ammunition and ordnance) of the [USML] to describe more precisely

21

the articles warranting export and temporary import control on the USML.” 83 Fed. Reg. at

22

24,198. If the NPRM is finalized as contemplated, the items removed from the USML would

23

no longer be subject to the ITAR’s authorization requirements, see id., i.e., no license from the

24

Department of State would be required for their export.

25

The Commerce NPRM explains both the rationale for the proposed transfer as well as

26

the review process undertaken by the Government. As it explained, the process included a

27

“review of those categories by the Department of Defense, which worked with the Departments

1

of State and Commerce in preparing the amendments.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 24,166. The review

2

was intended to ensure that items remaining on the USML are either “inherently military or

3

otherwise warrant[ing] control on the USML” or “of a type common to nonmilitary firearms

4

applications, possess parameters or characteristics that provide a critical military or intelligence

5

advantage to the United States, and are almost exclusively available from the United States.”

6

Id. Put simply, the goal was to ensure that items remaining on the USML in the categories in

7

question, and therefore subject to export controls under the ITAR, are military weapons and

8

related items that could present a critical military or intelligence advantage.

9

IV.

10

Procedural History
On July 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the instant action against, inter alia, the Department,

11

the Secretary of State, DDTC, and Defense Distributed. Compl., ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs alleged

12

that the Government’s settlement with Defense Distributed adversely affected their public

13

safety laws, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Tenth

14

Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Id. at 21-41. Also on July 30, 2018, Plaintiffs moved for

15

a temporary restraining order against Defendants, Mot. for TRO, Dkt. No. 2, which the Court

16

granted on July 31, 2018, Dkt. No. 23 (“Order”).

17

In its Order, the Court held that Plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable injury because

18

“[i]f an injunction is not issued and the status quo alters . . . , the proliferation of these firearms

19

will have many of the negative impacts on a state level that the federal government once feared

20

on the international stage.” Order at 7. Further, the Court determined that Plaintiffs were

21

likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim because “[t]here is no indication” that, prior

22

to entering into the settlement agreement, the Government either provided 30-day notice to

23

Congress pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 2278(f)(1) or obtained the concurrence of the Secretary of

24

Defense pursuant to Executive Order 13637. Id. at 6.

25

The Court also found that Plaintiffs have standing “[f]or purposes of this temporary

26

order.” Id. at 6 n.2. The Court based this determination on the “clear and reasonable fear”

27

expressed by Plaintiffs, as well as the Court’s finding that “there is no separation of the internet

1

between domestic and international audiences.” Id. Finally, the Court found that “the balance

2

of hardships and the public interest tip sharply in plaintiffs’ favor.” Id. at 7. Consequently, the

3

Court enjoined the Government “from implementing or enforcing the ‘Temporary Modification

4

of Category I of the United States Munitions List’ and the letter to Cody R. Wilson, Defense

5

Distributed, and Second Amendment Foundation issued by the U.S. Department of State on

6

July 27, 2018,” and required that the Government “preserve the status quo ex ante as if the

7

modification had not occurred and the letter had not been issued.” Id. The Court did not enjoin

8

Defense Distributed in any manner. Id.

9

Plaintiffs amended their complaint on August 2, 2018, Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 29, and

10

moved for a preliminary injunction on August 9, 2018, Dkt. No. 43 (“Pls.’ Mot.”). As agreed

11

to by the parties, the TRO remains in effect until August 28, 2018. See Order, Dkt. No. 30.

12

ARGUMENT

13

“[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not

14

be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek

15

v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam) (citation omitted). A plaintiff “must

16

establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in

17

the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an

18

injunction is in the public interest.” Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d

19

1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Alternatively, “‘serious questions going to the

20

merits’ and a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of

21

a preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of

22

irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.” All. for the Wild Rockies v.

23

Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962,

24

967-68 (9th Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that each of these four

25

factors is met. DISH Network Corp. v. FCC, 653 F.3d 771, 776-77 (9th Cir. 2011).

26
27

Plaintiffs here ask the Court to suspend and enjoin enforcement of actions already taken
by the Government pursuant to its obligations under the settlement agreement. See Pls.’ Mot.

1

at 1; see also Pls.’ Proposed Order, Dkt. No. 43-3. Through this requested relief, Plaintiffs seek

2

not to “maintain the status quo” pending litigation, but to place themselves in a better position

3

than they were in before the onset of the current controversy through an award of “the exact

4

same ultimate relief” they seek. Taiebat v. Scialabba, No. 17-0805, 2017 WL 747460, at *2-3

5

(N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2017). “In general, that kind of judgment on the merits in the guise of

6

preliminary relief is a highly inappropriate result.” Senate of Cal. v. Mosbacher, 968 F.2d 974,

7

978 (9th Cir. 1992).3

8
9

I.

Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That The Department’s Action Will Cause Irreparable
Harm.

10

A preliminary injunction serves the “limited purpose” of “preserv[ing] the relative

11

positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451

12

U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Accordingly, “[a]n essential prerequisite” before granting preliminary

13

relief is a showing that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction. See Dollar

14

Rent A Car of Wash., Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 774 F.2d 1371, 1375 (9th Cir. 1985); Winter

15

v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 19 (2008).

16

Plaintiffs argue that the “threat to public safety” allegedly caused by the Department’s

17

settlement agreement constitutes irreparable harm. Pls.’ Mot. at 19-24. Specifically, they

18

claim that the settlement agreement “will make it significantly easier to produce undetectable,

19

untraceable weapons, pos[e] unique threats to the health and safety of the States’ residents and

20

employees, and compromis[e] the States’ ability to enforce their laws and keep their residents

21

and visitors safe.” Id. at 19. These harms alleged by Plaintiffs with respect to the specific

22

items at issue in this motion fall well short of irreparable harm.

23

First, Plaintiffs contend that removal of Defense Distributed’s files from the USML will

24

lead to the “proliferation of downloadable guns.” Pls.’ Mot. at 19. They refer further to “the

25

unique threats of irreparable harm to the States posed by permitting 3D-printed weapons files to

26
27

3
The Government leaves to the private party Defendants the question of whether and how their individual
rights should be considered in this analysis.

be posted on the internet.” Pls.’ Mot. at 20. But the core inadequacy of Plaintiffs’ claims of

2

irreparable harm is that they are not caused by, and cannot be traced to, the Department’s

3

regulatory actions or the challenged settlement agreement. Rather, if these harms occur at all, it

4

will be because individuals violate the separate prohibitions of the Undetectable Firearms Act

5

and other relevant domestic laws. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ claim of irreparable harm is based on a

fundamental misconception of the relevant law and the authority of the Department as the

7

federal agency that administers it. The AECA and ITAR have not conferred upon the

8

Department the authority to regulate or otherwise prohibit the domestic acquisition of defense

9

articles and services by U.S. persons or domestic communications to U.S. persons. See

10

generally 22 U.S.C. § 2778. Rather, as noted above, the agency’s only relevant authority

11

pursuant to the AECA and ITAR is limited to exports of defense articles and related technical

12

data. Id. § 2778(a)(1). Critically, neither the AECA nor ITAR prohibits the transmission of

13

defense articles among U.S. persons within the United States. Therefore, the Department has

14

never prohibited Defense Distributed, or any other company or individual, from providing their

15

files to U.S. persons on U.S. soil, including by, e.g., providing such technical data through the

16

mail, distributing DVDs containing such data, or other means. See Def. Distributed, 121 F.

17

Supp. 3d at 695 (“Plaintiffs are free to disseminate the computer files at issue domestically in

18

public or private forums, including via the mail or any other medium that does not provide the

19

ability to disseminate the information internationally.”); see also Heidema Decl. ¶ 12. To the

20

extent Defense Distributed and others have not previously disseminated the computer files at

21

issue within Plaintiffs’ boundaries, such inaction is attributable to their own decisions and not

22

to the Department’s regulatory authority. Plaintiffs therefore cannot plausibly suggest that the

23

Government’s settlement regarding Defense Distributed’s foreign export of its files has harmed

24

or imminently harm Plaintiffs’ ability to enforce their statutory schemes, prevent or solve

25

crimes, or protect public health.4 Should any of the harms about which Plaintiffs are concerned

The declarations submitted by Plaintiffs do not address these deficiencies. See generally Dkt. No. 43-2. Not
only are the harms described equally speculative as those presented in Plaintiffs’ motion, but these declarations

occur, it will be because individuals have violated separate domestic prohibitions, such as the

2

Undetectable Firearms Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(p)(1).

3

For this reason, the types of harms that Plaintiffs identify do not support the granting of

4

injunctive relief in the circumstances of this case. All of the concerns identified are harms that

5

might result from the domestic availability of 3D-printed guns in the United States, but such

6

concerns have little to do with whether particular files should be regulated for foreign export on

7

national security grounds. Their relation to the State Department’s exercise of authority and

8

the settlement agreement is speculative. For example, Plaintiffs contend that someone of

9

questionable “age, mental health, or criminal history” may procure the necessary equipment,

10

download files made specifically available as a result of the Department’s settlement, assemble

11

an operable firearm, and commit a crime, see Pls.’ Mot. at 19-20. But such actions would

12

violate domestic prohibitions on the use of firearms. The Department does not regulate the

13

files at issue for their availability to U.S. persons in the United States, and it is speculative to

14

claim that these domestic consequences would follow from the Department of State’s actions

15

under the ITAR.

16

Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the “unique threats” posed by firearms made by a 3D-

17

printing process fail for the same reasons. See id. at 20-24. For instance, they assert

18

shortcomings in the ability of metal detectors to discern the presence of firearms made from a

19

3D printer, see id. at 20-21, but nothing in the State Department actions challenged in this case

20

purports to permit the domestic production of undetectable firearms. Such production is illegal

21

due to separate authority that regulates domestic conduct. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(p)(1).

22

Plaintiffs also argue that 3D-printed firearms “present unique challenges to law

23

enforcement,” particularly with respect to tracing weapons and conducting forensic testing on

24

bullets. Pls’ Mot. at 21-22. Again, Plaintiffs can only speculate as to whether such a harm

25

would result from a decision by the Department of State not to regulate the export of the

26
27

confirm the domestic availability of the subject files notwithstanding the Department’s regulatory efforts. Camper

1

Defense Distributed’s files for national security reasons.
Similarly conjectural are Plaintiffs’ assertions about a “[h]eightened risk of terrorist

2
3

attacks.” Id. at 23. As reflected in the State and Commerce NPRMs, the Government proposed

4

transferring certain items in USML Category I, which encompass Defense Distributed’s files,

5

only because it has determined that such a transfer would not injure the national security

6

interests of the United States. See 83 Fed. Reg. at 24,198; 83 Fed. Reg. at 24,166; see also

7

Heidema Decl. ¶ 19. So Plaintiffs here seek to base injunctive relief on speculative harms to

8

national security that exist quite apart from the challenged actions and even that the

9

Government has considered and rejected. Moreover, concerns that children “may mistake

10

[these weapons] for toys” exist apart from export control requirements, and it is at best

11

conjecture that the modification of export control requirements would have any effect on the

12

alleged harm.5
At best, Plaintiffs have only identified harms that may result from 3D-printed guns

13
14

generally, not from the challenged actions regulating foreign exports. But there are already

15

laws aimed at domestic conduct that seek to prevent such harms. As the Ninth Circuit has

16

made clear, it is the likelihood of harm from the actions that are sought to be enjoined that is

17

relevant for the preliminary injunction analysis. See Park Vill. Apartment Tenants Ass’n v.

18

Mortimer Howard Tr., 636 F.3d 1150, 1160 (9th Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs simply cannot tie their

19

fear of domestic irreparable injury to a statutory regime dealing with foreign export, especially

20

when there are separate statutes governing domestic manufacture, possession, and sale that

21
5

22
23
24
25
26
27

The two cases Plaintiffs cite—Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012), and United States v. Ressam, 679
F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 2012)—are inapposite. See Pls.’ Mot. at 19, 24. In Maryland, Chief Justice Roberts, sitting as
Circuit Justice, granted a stay of judgment overturning a criminal conviction pending disposition of the State’s
petition for a writ of certiorari. Maryland, 567 U.S. at 1301. Chief Justice Roberts wrote that a stay was
appropriate because “there is . . . an ongoing and concrete harm to Maryland’s law enforcement and public safety
interests.” Id. As is made clear in the subsequent sentences omitted by Plaintiffs, however, such irreparable harm
arose from the fact that, as a result of the judgment, “Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute [its DNA
Collection Act] to help prevent [serious] injuries.” Id. Here, by contrast, the Department’s settlement has not
prevented any of Plaintiffs from employing their public safety statutes. Ressam is also readily distinguishable.
There a terrorist brought explosives into the United States in the trunk of a rental car. Ressam, 679 F.3d at 1073.
After a U.S. customs inspector detected Ressam’s nervousness, she sent the car for a secondary inspection, where
the contraband was located. Id. Thus not only does Ressam involve a weapon wholly distinct from a 3D-printed
gun, but it only demonstrates that existing law enforcement measures are able to thwart such attempted attacks.

remain unaffected by the challenged actions.

2

Finally, Plaintiffs have overlooked “[t]he possibility that . . . other corrective relief will

3

be available,” in which case temporary relief is unavailable. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61,

4

90 (1974). Plaintiffs retain the full authority to enforce their public safety laws, including

5

lawful restrictions on firearms possession and transfer, against any and all violators of the law.

6

And as discussed above other federal public safety laws regulating, inter alia, the possession of

7

firearms by felons and the mentally ill, and federal laws requiring that firearms contain

8

sufficient metal to be detectable, remain in force. These laws—which, unlike the AECA and

basis.

II. Plaintiffs Have Not Shown A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits

12

Although their Amended Complaint asserts claims under both the APA and the Tenth

13

Amendment, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 218-47, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction discusses

14

only their APA claims, Pls.’ Mot. at 10-19. As to either category of claims, Plaintiffs have

15

failed to establish that “the law and the facts clearly favor” their position, as required under the

16

heightened mandatory injunction standard. See Stanley, 13 F.3d at 1320.

17

A.

Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing To Assert Their Claims.

18

“Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to ‘Cases’ and

19

‘Controversies,’” and “[t]he doctrine of standing gives meaning to these constitutional limits by

20

‘identify[ing] those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.’”

21

Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) (citation omitted). Standing,

22

“which is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from

23

being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568

24

U.S. 398, 408 (2013). The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” has three

25

elements: that a plaintiff suffer a concrete injury-in-fact, that the injury be fairly traceable to the

26

challenged action of the defendant, and that it be likely (as opposed to speculative) that the

injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-

2

61 (1992).

3

Plaintiffs claim they satisfy the requirements of Article III standing because the

4

Department’s settlement has injured their sovereign, proprietary, and quasi-sovereign interests.

5

Pls.’ Mot. at 7-9. Plaintiffs fail to carry their burden with respect to each of these theories.

6

First, Plaintiffs assert that the settlement agreement has injured their sovereign interests in their

7

“abilities to enforce their statutory codes,” their “border integrity,” and their “ability to protect

8

their residents from injury and death.” Id. at 8. But neither U.S. export controls generally, nor

9

the challenged settlement agreement, prevents states from acting to enforce their own laws or

10

protect state residents.6 Thus, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the injuries they allege are

11

“fairly traceable” to the Department’s settlement with Defense Distributed. See Lujan, 504

12

U.S. at 560.7 Plaintiffs repeatedly assert that the Government’s “deregulation” has jeopardized

13

safety and security. See Pls.’ Mot. at 8; see also id. at 10 (claiming “threats to . . . the safety of

14

the States’ own employees and residents [] are caused by the Government’s sudden decision to

15

deregulate the posting of 3D-printed gun files on the internet”). Again, Plaintiffs’ arguments

16

are premised on a misconception of the AECA and ITAR, and the state of affairs prior to the

17

settlement of Defense Distributed’s claims. As the Government has previously explained, it

18

regulates the transfer of items constituting exports and temporary imports pursuant to the

19

AECA and ITAR, and it has no authority to regulate the transmission of technical data

20

exclusively from U.S. persons to U.S. persons within the United States under those authorities.

21
22
23
24
25
26
27

6

Plaintiffs find no support in California v. Sessions, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1015, 1029 (N.D. Cal. 2018), see Pls.’
Mot. at 8 n.25, where the court found injury-in-fact based on allegations that the Government “seeks to compel
[the State] to change its policies” and threatened loss of funds that were promised under federal law. Here, the
Department does not seek a change in Plaintiffs’ laws or policies, nor has it threatened to withhold any funds.
7
Although Plaintiffs claim the requirement to establish this second standing factor is “relaxed” because they
are “vested with a procedural right,” Pls.’ Mot. at 7, they have failed to explain the nexus between their alleged
procedural rights and the interests they assert. See Ashley Creek Phosphate Co. v. Norton, 420 F.3d 934, 938 (9th
Cir. 2005) (“[A] plaintiff asserting a procedural injury does not have standing absent a showing that the
‘procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of
his standing’. . . . A free-floating assertion of a procedural violation, without a concrete link to the interest
protected by the procedural rules, does not constitute an injury in fact.” (citation omitted)).

1

Thus, during the entire pendency of Defense Distributed’s lawsuit against the Government, the

2

ITAR did not limit Defense Distributed—or any other entity—from “free[ly] . . .

3

disseminat[ing] the computer files at issue domestically in public or private forums,” including

4

within Plaintiffs’ borders. Def. Distributed, 121 F. Supp. 3d at 695. Plaintiffs therefore cannot

5

plausibly assert that the Government’s “deregulation” has affected—let alone seriously

6

jeopardized—their ability to protect their interests. See Pls.’ Mot. at 8; Am. Compl. ¶ 17.
Moreover, separate laws aimed at domestic conduct continue to address domestic public

7
8

safety concerns. It remains that case that any person who might obtain the necessary

9

equipment and materials, download the files from Defense Distributed’s website, properly

10

construct an operable firearm, and render the firearm undetectable would be engaging in an

11

action forbidden by federal law. See 18 U.S.C. § 922(p)(1). Thus, Plaintiffs cannot establish

12

that the challenged actions, which concern whether an item must be regulated for export from

13

the United States, restrict their ability or authority to protect public safety in their states. See

14

Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409.

15

Plaintiffs fare no better in invoking their alleged proprietary or quasi-sovereign

16

interests. Pls.’ Mot. at 8-9; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15-18. According to Plaintiffs, they have suffered

17

proprietary injury insofar as “[t]he deregulation . . . make[s] state, county, and municipal jails

18

and prisons more dangerous for guards and inmates.” Pls’ Mot. at 8. As an initial matter, they

19

offer no support that such an injury is properly asserted under the doctrine of proprietary

20

interests rather than as parens patriae. Pennsylvania v. Kleppe, 533 F.2d 668, 671 (D.C. Cir.

21

1976) (“The alleged injuries to the state’s economy and the health, safety, and welfare of its

22

people clearly implicate the parens patriae rather than the proprietary interest of the state.”).8

23

But even if such interests were “proprietary,” Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any

24

harm based on the possibility of 3D-printed guns infiltrating prisons and injuring persons is

25
26
27

8

The cases cited by Plaintiffs, see Pls.’ Mot. at 8 n.29, do not involve jails or prisons but instead discuss a
state as land owner or “participa[nt] in a business venture,” Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S.
592, 601 (1982); as operator of a public university, Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1159 (9th Cir. 2017);

8
9

Plaintiffs’ assertions about their quasi-sovereign interests unquestionably sound in the
doctrine of parens patriae. See Pls.’ Mot. at 8-9; see also Washington v. Chimei Innolux Corp.,

10

659 F.3d 842, 847 (9th Cir. 2011) (explaining that the “doctrine of parens patriae allows a

11

sovereign to bring suit on behalf of its citizens when the sovereign alleges injury to a

12

sufficiently substantial segment of its population, articulates an interest apart from the interests

13

of particular private parties, and expresses a quasisovereign interest”). But to the extent

14

Plaintiffs seek to vindicate the interests of private citizens, see Pls.’ Mot. at 8-9; Am. Compl.

15

¶ 16 (referring to need to “[e]nsur[e] the safety of their residents”), they fail to create any

16

“actual controversy between the State[s] and the defendant[s],” Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v.

17

Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 602 (1982), and so lack standing as parens patriae. See also

18

Oregon v. Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F.3d 965, 974 (9th Cir. 2009) (allowing a state to “bring suit

19

on behalf of its citizens solely by virtue of its interest that its citizens benefit from voluntary

20

federal grants” would “make the parens patriae doctrine ‘too vague to survive the standing

21

requirements of Art. III.” (citation omitted)). It is also well established that a state “does not

22

have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal government.” Sierra

‘a prudential standing requirement in addition to the requirement, imposed by Article III of the

2

Constitution, that the plaintiff have suffered an injury in fact.’” Havasupai Tribe v. Provencio,

3

876 F.3d 1242, 1253 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Prudential standing requires that an

4

interest asserted by a plaintiff be “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or

5

regulated by the statute that he says was violated.” Id. (citation omitted); see also Ashley Creek

6

Phosphate Co. v. Norton, 420 F.3d 934, 939 (9th Cir. 2005) (“The prudential standing analysis

7

examines whether ‘a particular plaintiff has been granted a right to sue by the statute under

8

which he or she brings suit.’” (citation omitted)). While the zone of interests test is not

9

“demanding,” it nevertheless forecloses suit “when a plaintiff’s ‘interests are so marginally

10

related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be

11

assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.’” Match–E–Be–Nash–She–Wish Band of

12

Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).

13

Here, Plaintiffs do not fall within the zone of interests protected by the AECA,

14

particularly with respect to the provision on which they rely. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S.

15

154, 175-76 (1997) (emphasizing that zone of interests test is applied in the context of “the

16

particular provision of law upon which the plaintiff relies”). The AECA “is designed to protect

17

against the national security threat created by the unrestricted flow of military information

18

abroad.” United States v. Posey, 864 F.2d 1487, 1495 (9th Cir. 1989); accord United States v.

19

Chi Mak, 683 F.3d 1126, 1134 (9th Cir. 2012) (AECA “was intended to authorize the President

20

to control the import and export of defense articles and defense services in ‘furtherance of

21

world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States.’” (quoting 22 U.S.C.

22

§ 2778(a)(1))); see also Am. Compl. ¶ 27 (acknowledging that “[t]he purpose of the AECA is

23

to reduce the international trade in arms and avoid destabilizing effects abroad through arms

24

exports”).9 In this context Congress enacted 22 U.S.C. § 2778(f)(1), which provides that “[t]he

25

Plaintiffs’ attempt to characterize the AECA as designed to protect “domestic security” rather than “national
security” is unavailing. See Pls.’ Mot. at 9. By Plaintiffs’ reasoning, any national security determination made by
the Government would be subject to second-guessing by Plaintiffs because it affects their residents. Yet they offer
no authority to support such a position. See id.; cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 580 (2004) (Thomas, J.,
dissenting) (“The national security . . . is the primary responsibility and purpose of the Federal Government.”).

to “legitimate industry concerns” and cautioned the Executive Branch to “avoid unnecessary

whose alleged harms concern purely domestic, non-military matters, fail to meet the zone of

C.

Plaintiffs’ APA Claims Are Meritless.
1.

The Department’s Actions Accord With Its Delegated Authority.

14

Plaintiffs cannot establish likely success on the merits of any of their claims. First,

15

Plaintiffs claim that the Government has failed to comply with the AECA’s 30-day notice

16

requirement to Congress. See Pls.’ Mot. at 11-12; see also id. at 13-14 (challenging

17

Department’s reliance on 22 C.F.R. § 126.2); Am. Compl. ¶¶ 220-22, 231. But Plaintiffs again

18

betray their misunderstanding of the governing law. The statutory provision they invoke

19

provides that “the President may not remove any item from the Munitions List until 30 days

20

after the date on which the President has provided notice of the proposed removal” to the

21

appropriate congressional committees. 22 U.S.C. § 2778(f)(1) (emphases added). Pursuant to

22

the plain text of the AECA, an “item” refers to the USML’s categories or subcategories—e.g.,

23

“Fully automatic firearms to .50 caliber inclusive (12.7 mm),” 22 C.F.R. § 121.1—and not

24

specific articles or commodities related thereto. 22 U.S.C. § 2778(a)(1) (“The President is

25

27

of such articles and services. The items so designated shall constitute the United States

5

“item” of the USML. The Department’s settlement regarding the files at issue in Defense

Distributed does not implicate the 30-day notice requirement of 22 U.S.C. § 2778(f)(1).

To the extent the Court finds the AECA’s reference to “item” or “remove” to be

8

ambiguous, the Department’s interpretation of these terms is entitled to at least Skidmore

9

deference. Under Skidmore, a court must defer to an agency’s interpretation provided it is

10

“persuasive and reasonable,” considering “‘the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the

11

validity of its reasoning, [and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.’” Fox

12

Television Stations, Inc. v. Aereokiller, LLC, 851 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting

13

United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 228 (2001))). The Department has consistently

14

held the view since at least 2011 that only the permanent removal of items, i.e., the categories

15

or subcategories of the USML, implicate the 30-day notice requirement. See Heidema Decl.

16

¶¶ 9, 30, 32. Further, the Department’s position accords with both the AECA’s text and the

17

original purpose of 22 U.S.C. § 2778(f)(1), which was to encourage the Executive Branch to

18

remove items from the USML. See H.R. Rep. No. 97-58, at 22 (“[T]he committee expects the

19

executive branch will avoid unnecessary export regulation . . . .”). Additionally, Congress has

20

been aware of the Department’s interpretation and yet has not addressed it in amendments to

21

the AECA. See Pub. L. No. 113-296, 128 Stat. 4075 (2014); Heidema Decl. ¶ 9. “These

22

circumstances provide further evidence—if more is needed—that Congress intended the

23

Agency’s interpretation, or at least understood the interpretation as statutorily permissible.”

Fox Television Stations, 851 F.3d at 1014 (quoting Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 220

25

(2002)).

1

days so that the State Department can consider providing the notice to Congress—rather than

2

entering the more sweeping preliminary injunction that Plaintiffs seek.

3

Similarly, Plaintiffs’ misreading of 22 C.F.R. § 126.2 is fatal to their argument that the

4

Department has “[m]isuse[d]” the temporary modification regulation. See Pls.’ Mot. at 13-14.

5

That regulation, by definition, effectuates only a “temporary” modification, and thus does not

6

constitute a “removal” such that a 30-day notice is required. See 22 C.F.R. § 126.2. Nor can

7

Plaintiffs cast doubt on the reasonableness of the Department’s interpretation of § 126.2 by

8

claiming that its national security determination “is not the sort of emergency stopgap measure

9

contemplated by 22 C.F.R. § 126.2.” Pls.’ Mot. at 14. It is well established that an agency is

10

entitled to “substantial deference” in interpreting its regulations. E.g., Lezama-Garcia v.

11

Holder, 666 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2011). And Plaintiffs’ purported national security

12

pronouncements, see Pls.’ Mot. at 14; see also id. at 18, offer no basis to challenge the

13

Department’s findings in this regard. E.g., United States v. Hawkins, 249 F.3d 867, 873 n.2

14

(9th Cir. 2001) (“[C]ourts have long recognized that the Judicial Branch should defer to

15

decisions of the Executive Branch that relate to national security.”).

16

Plaintiffs also cannot state a claim related to Executive Order 13637, pursuant to which

17

designations or changes in designations “of items or categories of items that shall be considered

18

as defense articles and defense services subject to export control under section 38 (22 U.S.C.

19

§ 2778) shall have the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense.” Exec. Order No. 13637

20

§ 1(n)(i). See Pls.’ Mot. at 13; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 221-22, 231, 246. Again, the Department has

21

not changed the designations “of items or categories of items.” Further, Plaintiffs’ argument

22

fails because the Executive Order creates no rights for Plaintiffs to enforce. Exec. Order No.

23

13637 § 6(c); cf. Defenders of Wildlife v. Jackson, 791 F. Supp. 2d 96, 120 (D.D.C. 2011)

24

(Exec. Order No. 13186). Most importantly, as stated in the Commerce NPRM, “[t]he changes

25

described in this proposed rule and in the State Department’s companion proposed rule on

26

Categories I, II, and III of the USML are based on a review of those categories by the

27

Department of Defense, which worked with the Departments of State and Commerce in

preparing the amendments.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 24,166; see also Heidema Decl. ¶ 31 (discussing

2

concurrence specific as to subject files).

3

The Court should also reject Plaintiffs’ argument that the Department, in settling

4

Defense Distributed, engaged in an “unlawful attempt to abrogate state and federal law.” Pls.’

5

Mot. at 14-15; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 227, 233, 239. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that the temporary

6

modification, which “permits any United States person” to use the subject files, “conflicts with

7

many of the States’ respective laws regulating firearms,” as well as provisions of the Gun

8

Control Act, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), (x). Pls.’ Mot. at 14. Yet the Government does not suggest,

9

and has never suggested, that the settlement agreement conflicts with or otherwise preempts

10

such laws. To the contrary, the Department has consistently emphasized that its actions are

11

taken only pursuant to its authority to regulate the United States’ system of export controls, not

12

domestic activity. See Def. Distributed, 121 F. Supp. 3d at 695. The provisions of the Gun

13

Control Act cited by Plaintiffs remain in force, as do the protections for state law legislated by

14

Congress in the Gun Control Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 927. Thus, the laws invoked by Plaintiffs

15

remain unaffected by the settlement agreement, and there is no basis to substitute Plaintiffs’

16

understanding of the agreement for the far more reasonable interpretation of the Government.10
2.

17

The Department’s Actions Were Not Arbitrary And Capricious.

Finally, Plaintiffs claim that the Department’s actions were arbitrary and capricious

18
19

because they constitute an unexplained reversal of the agency’s prior position concerning

20

whether the subject files are ITAR controlled. See Pls.’ Mot. at 15-17; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 238-39.

21

Insofar as Plaintiffs challenge the Government’s litigation strategy in Defense Distributed or its

22

decision to enter into a settlement to resolve that litigation, such decisions are committed to

23

agency discretion by law and thus not subject to judicial review, 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). See

24

Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985); Exec. Bus. Media, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 3 F.3d

25
26
27

10

Similarly, the Court should not accept Plaintiffs’ accusations of deliberate efforts by the Government to
circumvent the law, Pls.’ Mot. at 14; see also id.at 4 (suggesting the Government settled “covert[ly]”). United
States v. Boyce, 38 F. Supp. 3d 1135, 1151 (C.D. Cal. 2014), aff’d, 683 F. App’x 654 (9th Cir. 2017)
(“Government officials are presumed to carry out their duties in good faith.”).

759, 761 (4th Cir. 1993) (“[T]he Attorney General has broad discretion and even plenary

2

authority to control litigation under 28 U.S.C. 516 and 519, and [] such decisions are not

3

judicially reviewable.”); accord United States v. Carpenter, 526 F.3d 1237, 1241-42 (9th Cir.

4

2008) (recognizing Attorney General’s plenary discretion to settle litigation, but noting that in

5

cases—unlike this one—where plaintiffs allege that Attorney General has “exceeded [his] legal

6

authority,” such claims are reviewable).11
Moreover, as the relevant NPRMs indicate, the Department has concluded that ITAR

7
8

control of such technical data is not warranted. See generally 83 Fed. Reg. 24,198; 83 Fed.

9

Reg. at 24,166. These NPRMs have not been withdrawn and remain the official position of the

10

Government.12 Cf. Pennzoil Co. v. Dep’t of Energy, 680 F.2d 156, 171 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.

11

1982). Further, the rationale for this determination is provided in the Commerce NPRM, which

12

explains that the “review was focused on identifying the types of articles that are now

13

controlled on the USML that are either (i) inherently military and otherwise warrant control on

14

the USML or (ii) if of a type common to non-military firearms applications, possess parameters

15

or characteristics that provide a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States,

16

and are almost exclusively available from the United States.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 24,166 (“Thus,

17

the scope of the items described in this proposed rule is essentially commercial items widely

18

available in retail outlets and less sensitive military items.”). This case is only about the

19

determination of the Government that the technical data at issue would not give a military or

20

intelligence advantage and is therefore not properly subject to export controls. Only those

21

weapons of a type that is inherently military or that is not otherwise widely available for

22

commercial sale are properly subject to such controls. The Government has not made any

23

determination that 3D-printed guns should not be regulated domestically, and indeed the

24

Government intends to apply those authorities that regulate such firearms and supports

25
26
27

11

Plaintiffs contend that in accepting the settlement agreement, Defendants agreed to exceed their legal
authority. As explained in the balance of this memorandum, that is not accurate.
12
Further, Plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that the APA requires the Department to release
“reports, studies, or analyses” in support of its decision regarding a temporary modification pending a larger
rulemaking effort. See Pls.’ Mot. at 16.

III.

The Balance of Equities And The Public Interest Weigh Against Entry Of A
Preliminary Injunction
Finally, Plaintiffs cannot show the balance of equities and public interest factors—

5

which are merged when the Government is a party, Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d

6

1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014)—tips sharply in their favor, particularly given the mandatory

7

injunction they seek. First, because the Department has no authority to restrict U.S. persons

8

from sharing these files with other U.S. persons within the United States, the harms identified

9

by Plaintiffs cannot be prevented by an injunction in this case. See Def. Distributed, 121 F.

10

Supp. 3d at 687 (files previously available on Defense Distributed’s website). Moreover, the

11

public interest is not served by restraining the ability of the Executive Branch to exercise its

12

discretion to determine whether harm to national security requires export controls on particular

13

items. Cf. Virginian Ry. Co. v. Sys. Fed’n No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, 552 (1937) (statutory scheme

14

of Congress “is in itself a declaration of public interest and policy which should be persuasive”

15

to courts).

16

Further, the Government notes that the possibility of manufacturing small-caliber

17

firearms from a 3D-printing process has been publicly discussed since 2013. Heidema Decl.

18

¶ 26 n.5. Yet Plaintiffs allege no efforts on their part to enact additional legislation regarding

19

the manufacture of such firearms, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 68-217, and not a single Plaintiff

20

submitted comments in response to the NPRMs, Heidema Decl. ¶ 23. This further

21

demonstrates that the balance of equities weighs in Defendants’ favor.
