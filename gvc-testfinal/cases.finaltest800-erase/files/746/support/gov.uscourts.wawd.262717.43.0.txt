I.

INTRODUCTION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

2

In April 2018, Defendants 1 entered a covert agreement with an organization run by a

3

self-described “crypto-anarchist” to authorize the unrestricted dissemination of downloadable

4

guns via the internet. When the deal came to light, the Plaintiff States promptly filed this lawsuit,

5

and this Court entered a temporary restraining order (Dkt. # 23) (TRO). The White House then

6

announced that “the Justice Department made a deal without the President’s approval” and “the

7

President is glad this effort was delayed” by the TRO. 2 The Plaintiff States now ask the Court to

8

continue to preserve the status quo by converting its TRO to a preliminary injunction.

9

The merits are clear: Defendants’ removal of 3D printable gun files from the U.S.

10

Munitions List violated multiple statutory requirements and will irreparably harm the States

11

absent preliminary relief. Along with this motion, the States submit numerous declarations 3 of

12

former government officials, senior law enforcement officers, scholars, and other experts to

13

establish the profound consequences the States and their residents will suffer if undetectable,

14

untraceable, 3D-printable weapons become readily available across the globe. Defendants

15

themselves have acknowledged that permitting the online dissemination of 3D-printable

16

weapons will pose significant threats, having taken that very position for five years in numerous

17

letters and court pleadings. President Trump succinctly summarized Defendants’ actions when

18

he tweeted that deregulating printable-gun files “doesn’t seem to make much sense!” 4

Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt. # 2 at pp. 4–11), and is briefly summarized below.

2

A.

AECA and Its Implementing Regulations

3

The Arms Export Control Act (the Act or AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751 et seq., authorizes

4

the President to control the import and export of “defense articles”—including firearms and

5

related “technical data,” 22 C.F.R. §§ 120.10(a), 121.1(I)(a)—by including them on the U.S.

6

Munitions List. The President delegated his export-control authority to the State Department,

7

which promulgated the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the Regulations or ITAR),

8

administered by the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (the Directorate

9

or DDTC). Exec. Order No. 13,637, 78 Fed. Reg. 16,129 (Mar. 8, 2013); 22 C.F.R. §§ 120–30.

10

The Act provides that the Executive Branch “may not remove any item from the

11

Munitions List” without providing 30 days’ notice to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs

12

and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 22 U.S.C. § 2778(f)(1); see Dkt. # 16 at 15.

13

Executive Order 13637 establishes the scope of the authority delegated to the State Department,

14

and provides that “changes in designations” (including removal of an item from the Munitions

15

List) “shall have the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense.” Exec. Order No. 13637, §1(n).

16

Where “doubt exists” as to whether a particular article is covered by the Munitions List,

17

the Regulations contain a commodity jurisdiction (CJ) procedure whereby the Directorate will

18

determine whether certain items or data are subject to regulation. 22 C.F.R. § 120.4.

19

B.

The Federal Government Begins Regulating Defense Distributed’s Conduct in 2013

20

In or around early May 2013, Defense Distributed posted on DEFCAD.org certain

21

Computer Aided Design (“CAD”) files that could be used to automatically manufacture the

22

“Liberator” pistol and other 3D-printed weapons. 5 The Directorate’s enforcement division sent

1

a letter advising Defense Distributed that posting the files likely violated the Regulations.6

2

Defense Distributed complied by removing the files and submitting CJ determination requests. 7

3

In the CJ procedure, the Directorate determined that the files for the Liberator and certain other

4

weapons, as well as files which could instruct a 3D printer to produce firearms using the “Ghost

5

Gunner” automated firearms metal milling machine, were subject to the Regulations. 8

6

C.

Defense Distributed Sues the Federal Government in 2015, Losing at Every Stage

7

In May 2015, Defense Distributed sued the Government in a Texas federal district court,

8

seeking to enjoin its regulation of the files. In defending against that lawsuit, the Government

9

stated it was “particularly concerned that [the] proposed export of undetectable firearms

10

technology could be used in an assassination, for the manufacture of spare parts by embargoed

11

nations, terrorist groups, or guerilla groups, or to compromise aviation security overseas in a

12

manner specifically directed at U.S. persons.” 9

13

The district court ruled for the Government, finding that “[f]acilitating global access to

14

firearms undoubtedly increases the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict.”

15

Def. Distributed v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 121 F. Supp. 3d 680, 691 (W.D. Tex. 2015) (quotation

16

marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction, citing both the

17

national security implications of the CAD files and the permanent nature of the internet. Def.

18

Distributed v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 838 F.3d 451, 460–61 (5th Cir. 2016) (files posted online

19

would remain there “essentially forever,” and thus “the national defense and national security

20

interest would be harmed forever”). The Supreme Court denied certiorari. 138 S. Ct. 638 (2018).

2

defense articles abroad” and that “the Department of State has consistently and reasonably

concluded that it is not possible to meaningfully curtail the overseas dissemination of arms if

unfettered access to technical data essential to the production of those arms is permitted.” 10

D.

The State Department Reaches a Covert Settlement with Defense Distributed

6

1.

7

By April 20, just weeks after the Government moved to dismiss, it had reached a

8

settlement with Defense Distributed. 11 However, the Settlement Agreement was not executed

9

until June 29, and was not made public until July 10. 12 In the Settlement Agreement, the State

10

Department committed to: (a) “draft and . . . fully pursue” a notice of proposed rulemaking

11

(NPRM) and final rule revising Munitions List Category I to exclude the “technical data that is

12

the subject of the Action” 13; (b) announce a “temporary modification” of Category I to exclude

13

the data; (c) issue a letter to Defense Distributed advising that its files are “approved for public

14

release (i.e., unlimited distribution)” and exempt from the Regulations; and (d) acknowledge and

15

agree that the Temporary Modification “permits any United States person” to “access, discuss,

16

use, reproduce, or otherwise benefit from” the data and that the Letter “permits any such person

17

to access, discuss, use, reproduce or otherwise benefit from” Defense Distributed’s files. 14

The settlement is revealed a day after the rulemaking comment period closes

18

The Government published the promised rulemaking notices on May 24, with comment

released. 15 The State Department’s proposed rule would remove all non-automatic firearms up

2

to .50 caliber and any related technical data from the Munitions List, and those items would

3

instead be governed by the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations

4

(EAR). 16 Unlike the ITAR, the EAR does not apply to any technical data posted on the internet.17

5

In other words, if Commerce’s proposed rule were to become final, and the Temporary

6

Modification and Letter were not enjoined, Commerce’s regulations would prevent it from

7

regulating downloadable gun files once they are posted—even on national security grounds. 18

8

On July 27, 2018, as promised, the Directorate published on its website the Temporary

9

Modification, announcing its determination “that it is in the interest of the security and foreign

10

policy of the United States to temporarily modify [Munitions List] Category I to exclude” the

11

technical data referenced in the Settlement Agreement. 19 In a departure from past practice, the

12

Temporary Modification was not published in the Federal Register. 20

13

Also on July 27, 2018, as promised, the Directorate sent a letter to Defense Distributed

14

(the Letter) approving its files for “public release (i.e., unlimited distribution)” and stating they

15

were not subject to the Regulations. 21 The same day, the parties stipulated to dismiss the case. 22

17

15

See 83 Fed. Reg. 24,198 (May 24, 2018).
See id.
17
See 15 C.F.R. §§ 734.3(b), 734.7(a) (excluding from EAR jurisdiction “published” information and
software, including that made available for “[p]ublic dissemination (i.e., unlimited distribution) in any form . . .
including posting on the Internet on sites available to the public . . . .”).
18
As the Commerce Department’s rulemaking notice explains, “if a gun manufacturer posts a firearm’s
operation and maintenance manual on the internet,” the “manual would no longer be ‘subject to the EAR.’” 83 Fed.
Reg. 24,166, 24,167 (May 24, 2018) (citing 15 C.F.R. §§ 734.3(b), 734.7(a)). While proposed rule is not challenged
here, it underscores the need for an injunction to prevent irreparable harm.
19
Dkt. # 29-1, Ex. 7. The U.S. Department of Justice has represented that on July 31, following the issuance
of the TRO, the notice of the Temporary Modification was removed from the DDTC’s website and the Letter was
rescinded as “a nullity during the pendency of the [TRO].” Rupert Decl., Ex. 6.
20
See, e.g., 2 Fed. Reg. 41,172 (Aug. 30, 2017); 80 Fed. Reg. 78,130 (Dec. 29, 2015); 80 Fed. Reg. 37,974
(Jul. 2, 2015). These are the three most recent temporary modifications of the Munitions List published in the
Federal Register. Notably, none of them temporarily removes an item from the Munitions List.

The Court Issues a TRO and the President Denounces the Covert Settlement

2

On July 31, 2018, after becoming aware of the Settlement Agreement, President Trump

3

tweeted that deregulating printable-gun files “doesn’t seem to make much sense!” 23 The Court

4

issued the TRO on July 31. Dkt. # 23. At a press briefing the following day, White House

5

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders commented as follows: “The Department of Justice made a deal

6

without the President’s approval. On those regards, the President is glad this effort was delayed

7

to give more time to review the issue.” 24

8

9

A.

ARGUMENT

Standard for Granting Temporary Relief

10

The same standard applies to a request for a TRO and a request for a preliminary

11

injunction. The States must establish that “(1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they

12

are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of the

13

equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.” Short v. Brown,

14

893 F.3d 671, 675 (9th Cir. 2018). These factors are analyzed on a “sliding scale,” id.; “the more

15

net harm an injunction can prevent, the weaker the plaintiff’s claim on the merits can be while

16

still supporting some preliminary relief.” All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127,

17

1133 (9th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, while the merits of the States’

18

claims are extremely strong, even if they were less clearly meritorious, relief would be warranted

19

because the balance of harms so heavily favors the States. See Short, 893 F.3d at 675.

20

B.

The States Have Standing

21

The Court has already found, for purposes of the TRO, that the States have standing to

22

pursue their claims based on their “clear and reasonable fear that the proliferation of untraceable,

undetectable weapons will enable convicted felons, domestic abusers, the mentally ill, and others

2

who should not have access to firearms to acquire and use them” as a result of the Government’s

3

sudden deregulation of downloadable gun files. Dkt. # 23 at p.6 n.2.

4

“At bottom, ‘the gist of the question of standing’ is whether” the States “have ‘such a

5

personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which

6

sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.’”

7

Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204

8

(1962)); see also Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1158–59 (9th Cir. 2017). States are

9

“entitled to special solicitude in [the] standing analysis.” Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520.

10

1.

11

This Court is familiar with the injury-in-fact, traceability, and redressability requirements

12

of Article III standing. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). In an APA case

13

such as this, these requirements are relaxed: a litigant vested with a procedural right “has

14

standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party

15

to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant.” Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 518;

16

see also Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 748, 751–52 (5th Cir. 2015). A state has standing

17

“if it possesses a sovereign, quasi-sovereign, or a proprietary interest” in the litigation. Dep’t of

18

Fair Emp’t & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d 728, 753 n.5 (9th Cir. 2011)

19

(citing Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez (Snapp), 458 U.S. 592, 600–02

20

(1982)). Here, the States satisfy standing on all three grounds.

The States have Article III standing

21

Fundamentally, the Government’s actions harm the States’ bedrock sovereign interests.

22

“Two sovereign interests are easily identified: . . . the power to create and enforce a legal code”

23

and “the maintenance and recognition of borders.” Snapp, 458 U.S. at 601. The police power is

24

likewise “an exercise of the sovereign right of the government to protect the general welfare of

the people.” East N.Y. Sav. Bank v. Hahn, 326 U.S. 230, 232 (1945) (quotation marks, citation,

2

alteration omitted). 25 By authorizing the unrestricted spread on the internet of downloadable

3

guns, so that any State resident or visitor could manufacture and possess weapons without the

4

States’ knowledge or detection, the Government undercuts the States’ abilities to enforce their

5

statutory codes. 26 The Government’s deregulation violates the States’ border integrity by

6

impeding their ability to prevent weapons from entering through airports. 27 It violates the States’

7

police power by seriously impeding their ability to protect their residents from injury and death. 28

8

The deregulation also harms the States’ proprietary interests. 29 They make state, county,

9

and municipal jails and prisons more dangerous for guards and inmates. 30 “The existence of

10

3-D printed plastic firearms, weapons that are undetectable using metal detectors, would

11

fundamentally undermine [States’] ability to maintain safe and secure correctional facilities.” 31

12

The jobs of state, county, and municipal detectives, protective service agents, and other law

13

enforcement personnel would become more dangerous and more difficult. 32

The deregulation harms the States’ quasi-sovereign interests, too. 33 The Government’s

concerns that foreign terrorists will enter their borders with undetectable guns, and their residents

2

will face street crime perpetrated with untraceable smuggled guns. 37 Such threats to domestic

3

security—to the safety of the States’ own employees and residents—are caused by the

4

Government’s sudden decision to deregulate the posting of 3D-printed gun files on the internet.

As the Government itself argued as recently as April 2018, “the Internet has no dividing lines”;

once the files are released, they are available globally. 38 The States’ interests fall squarely within

1

The State Department exceeded its delegated authority in at least five distinct ways.

2

(i) Failure to provide 30 days’ notice to Congress. The State Department violated the

3

Act’s prohibition on “remov[ing] any item from the Munitions List” without giving 30 days’

4

notice to the appropriate Congressional foreign relations committees. 22 U.S.C. § 2778(f). The

5

Department flat-out failed to provide the required notice, instead enacting the Temporary

6

Modification and Letter covertly pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.

7

The 30-day notice provision is a crucial procedural requirement. 40 According to

8

U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, when the House and Senate

9

foreign relations committees receive a Munitions List removal notice—a relatively rare

10

occurrence—committee members and their staff actively participate in reviewing and assessing

11

the proposed removal. 41 In fact, the common practice in the past has been for the State

12

Department to give significantly more than 30 days’ notice, and to work intensively with

13

Congress in an active back-and-forth process, discussing the proposed removal with staff and

14

detailing the reasons the removal will not endanger national security or U.S. interests. 42 Congress

15

does not simply rubber-stamp removals from the Munitions List. 43 Thus, when members of

16

Congress learned of the covert Settlement Agreement in this case, they did not take it lightly. 44

1

The Government agrees (as it must) that Congress must receive 30 days’ notice before

2

any “item” can be removed from the Munitions List, but in its response to the States’ motion for

3

a TRO, it quibbled about what an “item” is—despite offering no support for its interpretation of

4

the term. According to the Government, “item” means one of the Munitions List’s broader

5

“categories or subcategories,” whereas the term does not encompass “specific articles” such as

6

Defense Distributed’s files. Dkt. # 16 at p.15. The Government’s own authority refutes its theory

7

that an “item” is a “category”; both cases on which it relies distinguish “specific controlled

8

items” from the Munitions List’s broader “categories.” Def. Distributed, 121 F. Supp. 3d 680 at

9

687 (the Munitions List is “a series of categories describing the kinds of items” regulated)

10

(emphasis added); United States v. Zhen Zhou Wu, 711 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2013) (same). 45 The

11

Government’s theory is further undermined by the CJ regulation providing for determinations as

12

to individual articles, which reiterates the Act’s requirement that the Directorate “must provide

13

notice to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from the U.S. Munitions List.”

14

22 C.F.R. § 120.4(a). Even the Government itself has previously referred to Defense

15

Distributed’s files as “items.” 46

16

The Government’s argument also ignores the breadth of the files that it removed from

17

the Munitions List. The Temporary Modification removed all “technical data that is the subject

18

of the Action”—a phrase defined by reference to Defense Distributed’s Texas complaint 47 to

19

include both Defense Distributed’s files and “Other Files,” i.e., “similar 3D printing files related

See also United States v. Pulungan, 569 F.3d 326, 328 (7th Cir. 2009) (Easterbrook, J.) (“[A]n effort to

46
See, e.g., Dkt. # 29-1, Ex. 4 (Aguirre Decl.), ¶¶ 28, 29(a).
47
The Temporary Modification provides that it applies to the “technical data identified in the Settlement
Agreement for the matter of Defense Distributed, et al., v. U.S. Department of State, et al., Case No. 15-cv-372-RP
(W.D. Tex.)” (the Action). Dkt. # 29-1, Ex. 7. The Settlement Agreement defines the files at issue by reference to
specific paragraphs of Defense Distributed’s Second Amended Complaint in that case. Dkt. # 29-1, Ex. 6.

1

to firearms that they or others have created.” 48 “Other Files” also includes inchoate technical

2

information that Defense Distributed “will continue to create and possess” in the future. Id., ¶ 45.

3

In short, the Temporary Modification applies broadly to all “3D printing files related to

4

firearms.” Moreover, if only a few “specific articles” were at issue, it would be overkill for the

5

Government to agree to “draft and fully pursue” a formal APA rulemaking in order to settle with

6

Defense Distributed—but it did. 49 In fact, the proposed rule would amend the Regulations to

7

“revise” entire Munitions List categories. Dkt. # 16 at p.6 n.6; supra at 5.

8
9

For all the above reasons, the Government cannot escape the 30-day notice requirement,
which it concededly did not follow. This alone is fatal.

10

(ii) Failure to obtain the Secretary of Defense’s concurrence. As noted above, the

11

President delegated his export-control authority to the State Department subject to the limitation

12

that “changes in designations” (including removing items from the Munitions List) “shall have

13

the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense.” Executive Order 13637, §1(n). Evidently, there

14

was no such concurrence here, 50 as the States pointed out and as the Government did not dispute.

15

See Dkt. # 2 at pp. 5, 14, 15–16; Dkt. # 16. In acting without the required concurrence, the

16

Directorate exceeded its delegated authority. “Agency actions beyond delegated authority are

17

‘ultra vires,’ and courts must invalidate them.” Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Office of Thrift

18

Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 621 (D.C. Cir. 1992). 51

attempt to end-run around the procedural requirements discussed above, the Directorate enacted

2

a “Temporary Modification” of the Munitions List pursuant to 22 C.F.R. § 126.2. 52 But it had

3

no authority to do so, as this regulation does not—and could not—permit the Directorate to

4

bypass the Act’s procedural requirements, whether for “security” or any other reason. “It is

5

beyond dispute that a federal regulation cannot empower the Government to do what a federal

6

statute prohibits it from doing.” Tuan Thai v. Ashcroft, 366 F.3d 790, 798 (9th Cir. 2004).

7

Furthermore, the Directorate’s purported determination that removing the files from the

8

Munitions List is “consistent with” national security (Dkt. # 16, p.16) is not the sort of emergency

9

stopgap measure contemplated by 22 C.F.R. § 126.2. And as discussed below, such a

10

determination would be arbitrary and capricious in any event. Infra at 15–17.

11

(iv) Unlawful attempt to abrogate state and federal law. The Directorate lacks statutory

12

authority to permit “any United States person” to “access, discuss, use, reproduce, or otherwise

13

benefit” from downloadable-gun files, as this would allow “any United States person” to

14

manufacture, possess, and sell firearms made from the files. As such, this provision conflicts

15

with many of the States’ respective laws regulating firearms, 53 and is also inconsistent with

16

numerous provisions of the federal Gun Control Act, including 18 U.S.C. § 922(x)(2)

17

(possession by minors) and § 922(g) (possession by felons and domestic abusers).

18

The Government seeks to disclaim any preemptive effect or statutory conflict. Dkt. # 16

19

at p.16. Even assuming the Government is correct that the Temporary Modification and Letter

20

cannot overturn state or federal statutes, their facial contradiction of state and federal law is all

21

the more reason to invalidate them as ultra vires. Moreover, the absence of preemptive effect

22
23
24

52

22 C.F.R. § 126.2 provides that the Directorate “may order the temporary suspension or modification of
any or all of the regulations of this subchapter in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United States.”

appears to be up for debate; the Private Defendants, at least, have adamantly asserted that the

2

Temporary Modification and Letter are as broad as they appear, permitting “any United States

3

person” to use the technical data. “Any means all,” they say. Dkt. # 8 at p.1 (emphasis in original).

4

(v) The President disagrees with the State Department’s actions. The Act endows the

5

President with authority to control imports and exports of defense articles. 22 U.S.C. § 2778(a).

6

Thus, the State Department cannot lawfully exercise such control against the President’s

7

wishes—and the President has made his disagreement clear. 54

8

3.

The State Department’s actions were arbitrary and capricious

9

Courts must set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,

10

or otherwise not in accordance with the law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Agency action is arbitrary

11

and capricious “if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider,

12

entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, . . . or is so implausible that it

13

could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle

14

Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). An agency

15

cannot simply ignore its previous determinations—especially if the agency offers no “reasoned

16

explanation” for ignoring or countermanding its earlier factual findings. FCC v. Fox Television

17

Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009).

18

In 2015, the Directorate determined via a CJ process that the files at issue were subject

19

to export regulation because they are “technical data” whose “central function” is to “enable the

20

manufacture” of ITAR-controlled items, including to “automatically find, align, and mill”

21

firearms. 55 As of April 2018, the Government’s position was that it had a “very strong public

national security,” and that “it is not possible to meaningfully curtail the overseas dissemination

2

of arms if unfettered access to technical data essential to the production of those arms is

3

permitted.” 56 The Government then abruptly reversed its position. It now claims to have made a

4

“determination” that “the temporary modification is consistent with the United States’ national

5

security and foreign policy” and that “ITAR control of [the downloadable-gun files] is not

6

warranted”—offering no reason for the about-face. Dkt. # 16 at pp. 16, 17.

7

In fact, the State Department apparently still believes that permitting downloadable guns

8

to be posted online threatens the national security. 57 On July 31, 2018, spokesperson Heather

9

Nauert stated at a press briefing addressing this case that the State Department still “wants to

10

prevent the wrong people from acquiring weapons overseas. That is the State Department’s

11

equity in this.” 58 This is consistent with the State Department’s position on 3D-printed gun files

12

since 2013. Nevertheless, Ms. Nauert stated, the State Department settled the case and enacted

13

the Temporary Modification solely because the Department of Justice advised it to do so, “and

14

so that is what was done. . . . We took the advice of the Department of Justice, and here we are

15

right now.” 59 In light of these revelations, which undermine any notion that the Temporary

16

Modification and Letter somehow further the national security, it is unsurprising that the

17

Government released no reports, studies, or analyses to explain the supposed reversal of its

18

position, and has failed to comply with the States’ repeated requests that it produce the

19

administrative record related to this matter. 60 All signs point to the conclusion that no such record

Under these circumstances, the Government’s 180-degree reversal is the epitome of

2

arbitrary and capricious agency action. Not only did the Government “ignore” the dire national-

3

security threats that “underlay . . . the prior policy,” Fox, 556 U.S. at 516—it completely reversed

8

The Private Defendants’ First Amendment arguments, which were rejected by both the

Texas district court and the Fifth Circuit, have no bearing on the States’ APA challenge, which

10

is focused on the Government’s failure to follow mandatory procedures. The Private Defendants

11

acknowledge that the files at issue are “technical data” for purposes of inclusion on the Munitions

12

List. The removal of such items from the Munitions List requires 30 days’ notice to Congress

13

and the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense—procedures designed to ensure that the

14

removal will not imperil the national security. Supra at 11. Those procedures were not followed,

15

and the States stand to suffer grievous harm as a result. That is the end of the inquiry.

A preliminary injunction would not offend the First Amendment

16

Even if the Private Defendants’ First Amendment claim were directly implicated here

17

(which it is not), that claim has been rejected at every level. Def. Distributed, 121 F. Supp. 3d at

18

691–96 (finding Defense Distributed unlikely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment

(affirming denial of preliminary injunction). Moreover, the Federal Government has never

21

reversed its position that inclusion of 3D-printed gun files on the Munitions List is consistent

22

with the First Amendment. See Dkt. # 29-1, Ex. 6, ¶ 4 (“[Government] Defendants deny . . . that

push of a button are protected “speech” at all. As the Fifth Circuit observed, this is a “novel”

2

question best resolved at the merits stage on a full factual record. Def. Distributed, 838 F.3d at

3

461. Even at this preliminary stage, it is clear that the files at issue “induce action without the

4

intercession of the mind or the will” of any human participant. CFTC v. Vartuli, 228 F.3d 94,

5

111 (2d Cir. 2000). All one has to do is “open the file and click ‘Print’” and the file

6

“communicate[s] directly” with the 3D printer to produce a weapon. 62 Furthermore, Defense

7

Distributed’s intent in disseminating the files is not to communicate an idea or message, but

8

specifically to evade lawful gun-safety regulation. 63

9

Even assuming that the printable files are protectable “speech,” the Ninth Circuit has

10

“repeatedly rejected First Amendment challenges to the AECA, its implementing regulations,

11

and its predecessor, the MSA[.]” United States v. Chi Mak, 683 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir. 2012).

12

The inclusion of the files at issue on the Munitions List is a content-neutral regulation that “will

13

be sustained under the First Amendment if it advances important governmental interests

14

unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than

15

necessary to further those interests.” Id. at 1134. Here, the files’ inclusion on the Munitions List

16

furthers the national security, 64 which easily qualifies as a compelling government interest even

17

under strict scrutiny. In re Nat’l Sec. Letter, 863 F.3d 1110, 1123 (9th Cir. 2017);

18

see Def. Distributed, 121 F. Supp. 3d at 694 (inclusion of the files on the Munitions List is not

19

based on Defense Distributed’s message, but “is intended to satisfy a number of foreign policy

20

and national defense goals”). And the CJ procedure determined that only those files whose

2

ITAR; Defense Distributed was not restricted from “discussing information and ideas about

3

3D printing . . . as long as such discussions do not include the export of technical data.” 65

4

If the First Amendment is implicated at all, it does not tip the scales against a preliminary

5

injunction, particularly in light of the grave threat of irreparable harm discussed below.

6

D.

The States Will Suffer Irreparable Harm in the Absence of Preliminary Relief

7

A threat to public safety undoubtedly establishes irreparable harm. See, e.g., Maryland

8

v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., as Circuit Justice) (“ongoing and concrete harm to

9

[state]’s law enforcement and public safety interests . . . constitutes irreparable harm”). Here, the

10

evidence shows that removing 3D-printed gun files from the Munitions List will make it

11

significantly easier to produce undetectable, untraceable weapons, posing unique threats to the

12

health and safety of the States’ residents and employees, and compromising the States’ ability to

13

enforce their laws and keep their residents and visitors safe.

14

1.

3D-printed guns are real, dangerous weapons that would be widely
accessible if the files were removed from the Munitions List

15
If the files are removed from the Munitions List, anyone with access to a commercially
16
available 3D printer—regardless of their age, mental health status, or criminal history—will be
17
able to download and instantly use them to make functional weapons at home or anywhere a
18
3D printer can be accessed. Indeed, the proliferation of downloadable guns outside the strictures
19
of state and federal law—a “Cambrian explosion” of unregulated weapons—is precisely Defense
20

Distributed’s goal. 66 The company’s “Liberator” pistol can be printed using a commonly

21
available, low-end 3D printer that can be purchased for as little as $300, using materials that cost

calls for the addition of a non-functional metal insert, the gun can fire deadly bullets without it.68

Investigative Division Ron Hosko—establishes the unique threats of irreparable harm to the

12

States posed by permitting 3D-printed weapons files to be posted on the internet.

3D-printed guns pose numerous unique threats of irreparable harm

13

(i) Threats to public safety. Metal detectors are one of the most significant forms of

14

protection for public facilities operated by the States and local governments such as airports,

15

stadiums, courthouses and other government buildings, and—increasingly—schools. 72 Firearms

16

made almost entirely of plastic would not be detected by this equipment, 73 thus seriously

undermining its utility; 74 even a metal bullet might be undetectable depending on the sensitivity

1

and calibration of the equipment. 75 Because of the potential for catastrophic harm posed by

2

undetectable weapons, and our country’s heavy reliance on metal detectors to prevent such harm,

3

the prospect of non-metal weapons becoming available has long caused concern at the highest

4

levels of the U.S. law enforcement and national security community. 76

5

Prisons also rely heavily on metal detectors and x-ray scanners for security. 77 The

6

availability of undetectable weapons would “fundamentally undermine” the Washington

7

Department of Corrections’ efforts to prevent serious contraband from being introduced into

8

prison facilities—nonmetal weapons and disassembled 3D-printed weapons could evade both

9

metal detectors and x-ray machines. 78 Successfully smuggled weapons could be used to harm or

10

kill staff, visitors, and incarcerated individuals, and aid in the escape of incarcerated persons. 79

11

It is also “difficult to overstate the danger” posed by violent felons ineligible to possess a firearm

12

being able to easily download one from the internet, which would jeopardize the safety of parole

13

officers and undermine their supervisory and enforcement work. 80

14

(ii) Compromising law enforcement efforts. Undetectable 3D-printed weapons present

15

unique challenges to law enforcement, disrupting their ability to investigate, solve, and prevent

16

violent crimes. 81 Serial numbers imprinted on weapons play an essential role in helping law

17

enforcement officials “trace” a gun to its original seller, and then to subsequent purchasers,

18

which can be used to solve crimes and combat gun trafficking. 82 But 3D-printed weapons could

1

be privately manufactured with no serial numbers, in contravention of federal law. 83 Such

2

untraceable “ghost guns” would make tracking ownership and possession far more difficult,

3

reducing state law enforcement agencies’ ability to solve crimes in their jurisdictions. 84 Further,

4

because 3D-printed weapons never enter the stream of commerce through a Federal Firearms

5

Licensee, no background check is ever performed, making it impossible for States with

6

background-check laws to verify whether an individual is entitled to possess the firearm. 85 Ghost

7

guns of the non-3D-printed variety are already increasingly popular 86—and increasingly being

8

used to commit horrific crimes, including multiple mass shootings in California. 87

9

3D-printed weapons would also undermine law enforcement efforts to forensically match

10

bullets used to commit crimes with the gun from which they are shot. For instance, plastic

11

weapons do not have “rifled” barrels, meaning that they do not leave “ballistic fingerprints” on

12

a bullet or casing that can be linked to the gun. 88 Even if a plastic gun did leave unique markings,

13

the firing conditions cannot be reliably replicated—and even attempting to do so is dangerous,

14

because the gun is unstable and dangerous even to the shooter. 89

15

For many of the reasons above, 3D-printed weapons may be particularly attractive to

16

criminal enterprises, which would likely embrace the technology for use in engaging in the

17

violence, proceeds-collection, and retaliation that commonly attends the work of those

18

organizations. 90 The vast majority of U.S. homicides involve illegally possessed and used

1

firearms 91—a problem that would be exacerbated by the ready availability of 3D-printed

2

firearms, which would add to the existing risk of homicide, armed robbery, and other crimes by

3

way of criminally inclined offenders who believe a “plastic gun” would help them avoid

4

detection or accountability. 92 Bad actors who seek to make 3D-printed firearms for criminal

5

purposes—unlike legitimate gun manufacturers and dealers—would have no motivation to

6

comply with state gun-registration and background-check laws, and would face less risk of

7

3D-printed weapons ultimately being traced to them. 93

8

(iii) Heightened risk of terrorist attacks. As the State Department apparently still agrees,

9

exporting downloadable gun files by posting them on the internet seriously threatens public

10

safety94—chiefly due to the risk that undetectable and untraceable firearms could be used by

11

foreign terrorist organizations for attacks within the United States, including against persons

12

residing in or visiting the Plaintiff States. 95 While metal detectors appear to have been effective

13

thus far in hindering the “numerous foreign adversaries intent on causing chaos and confusion

14

in the United States,” making undetectable weapons widely available means, for example,

15

“the 72,000 fans who pack CenturyLink for a Seahawks game suddenly become much more

16

vulnerable to terrorists who seek to cause as much bloodshed as possible.” 96

17

Importantly, removing downloadable gun files from the Munitions List makes them

18

importable as well as exportable. See 22 U.S.C. § 2778(a). Thus, even if a state were able to

19

enforce a law banning 3D printing of guns within its borders, such guns could be printed outside

2

case of the “Millennium Bomber,” an al-Qaeda linked terrorist who attempted to smuggle

3

explosives into the United States through Port Angeles, Washington. See United States v.

4

Ressam, 679 F.3d 1069, 1072–73 (9th Cir. 2012).

5

(iv) Impact on public health. Finally, “there is no doubt that plastic firearms pose a grave

6

threat to public health and safety” 97—particularly as to children. 3D-printed weapons such as

7

the Liberator do not always look like conventional firearms, and children may mistake them for

8

toys and play with them—a common reason for accidental gun deaths among children. 98 3D-

9

printed weapons will also make it possible for students to manufacture their own weapons that

10

could be used in a school shooting (and could evade metal detectors that some schools are

11

installing to prevent such shootings). 99 And as noted above, currently-available 3D-printed

12

weapons can even be dangerous to the shooter because they are unstable and prone to

13

misfiring. 100

14

E.

The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Sharply Favor Preliminary Relief

15

For the numerous and weighty reasons above, the balance of equities tips sharply in the

16

States’ favor. Meanwhile, the only cost to Defendants of converting the TRO into a preliminary

17

injunction is the continuation of regulatory restrictions that have been in place for over five years.

18

IV.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the State asks this Court to convert the TRO to a preliminary
injunction, so as to preserve the status quo until the merits can be fully adjudicated.
