MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

14

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Based solely on the allegations of a disgruntled former employee, the Consolidated Class

15

Action Complaint (“Complaint”) alleges that Defendants LDK Solar and various officers and

16

directors of LDK (collectively “Defendants”)1 fraudulently overstated LDK’s polysilicon

17

inventory in violation of federal securities laws. However, Charley Situ, the former employee,

18

admits that he lacks the necessary basis and expertise to support his speculation regarding LDK’s

19

inventory. Situ, the sole source for the Complaint’s allegations of missing and useless inventory

20

admits he did not count all of it and is not qualified to determine if the raw material meets the

21

technical requirements for use.

22

Far from establishing a cogent and more plausible inference of intentional deception, the

23

events described in the Complaint actually undermine the notion of a strong inference of

24

scienter. There has been no restatement, no stock sale by any Defendant, a positive conclusion

25

to the SEC’s informal inquiry, and the unqualified opinions by outside auditors and counsel

26

supporting LDK’s inventory reports, which all corroborate LDK’s inventory calculation. In

1

short, there is no support for Situ’s allegations and the Complaint should therefore be dismissed

2

for failure to meet the heightened pleading standard under the Private Securities Litigation

3

Reform Act (“PSLRA”).

4

The Complaint makes two unsupported claims of falsity: (1) LDK fabricated a portion of

5

its inventory; and (2) LDK overvalued the remainder of its polysilicon inventory. (¶ 4.)

6

However, the Situ email relied upon by Plaintiff admits that Situ only checked the inventory in

7

one of several LDK warehouses and that Situ lacked the technical expertise to evaluate the

8

usability of LDK’s polysilicon inventory.

9

In response to Situ’s assertions, LDK immediately formed a special committee of the

10

independent directors, who retained legal, accounting and polysilicon experts to analyze these

11

assertions. After two months of work, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, a Big Four accounting firm

12

and the polysilicon experts considered all of the inventory and concluded that Situ’s assertions

13

had no merit. LDK’s external auditor also considered and rejected Situ’s assertions in

14

connection with the 3Q07, 4Q07 and year-end financials. The corroboration of LDK’s inventory

15

by these seasoned independent professionals undercuts any inference of falsity derived from

16

Situ’s outrageous claims.

17

In desperation, Plaintiff resorts to misquoting an LDK executive as saying that Situ’s

18

information was “complete and accurate” but omitting the rest of the sentence, which said that

19

Situ’s allegations “only offer[] a partial picture” alluding to the fact that Situ’s incorrect count

20

arose because he considered only one of several warehouses.2 Plaintiff also struggles to fabricate

21

credibility for Situ by claiming that the SEC believes Situ and is investigating LDK, but again,

22

the opposite is true. The SEC officially concluded not to open an enforcement action based on

23

Situ’s allegations. Similarly, Situ’s email contends that KPMG will support his assertions

24

because as he concedes, the amount of inventory is a verifiable fact. Again, the objective third

25

parties disagree with Situ. KPMG issued a clean audit opinion, confirming the accuracy of

26

LDK’s inventory well after learning of Situ’s assertions. Thus, every third party that is discussed

27

in the Complaint as corroborating Situ’s assertions actually disagrees with him and has

concluded that Situ’s allegations have no merit.

2

Plaintiff’s allegations also do not adequately plead a cogent and compelling inference of

3

scienter as required under the PSLRA and the Supreme Court’s decision in Tellabs. Not only

4

does Plaintiff fail to allege facts that would give rise to a strong inference that any individual

5

defendant knew that the inventory was purportedly false, Plaintiff does not allege any specific

6

false statement by most of the individual defendants. And Defendants did not sell a single

7

share of LDK stock during the Class Period – a compelling and irrefutable fact that

8

undermines the inference of scienter as a matter of law. Plaintiff does not allege a single

9

suspicious stock sale. Indeed, Plaintiff admits that the decline in LDK’s stock price caused the

10

individual defendants to sustain substantial losses, including Mr. Peng, who, by Plaintiff’s

11

concession, lost $2.31 billion.

12

Given Situ’s lack of knowledge, the absence of any suspicious trades, and the

13

corroboration of LDK’s inventory by independent professionals, Plaintiff has not established a

14

“strong inference” of scienter as required under the PSLRA. Having failed to plead sufficient

15

facts to support the necessary elements of falsity and scienter, and for other reasons explained in

16

detail in this brief, the Complaint fails as a matter of law and should be dismissed.

17

II.

STATEMENTS OF FACTS

18

A.

LDK’s Inventory and Operations

19

LDK is a manufacturer of polysilicon wafers for use in solar panels. (¶ 23.)3 LDK is

20

incorporated in the Cayman Islands and is headquartered in Xinyu, China. See Request for

21

Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex. A (LDK May 11, 2007 Form F-1 Registration Statement (“LDK

22

2007 F-1”)), at 2, 3. LDK’s American Depository Shares were first listed on the New York

23

Stock Exchange on June 1, 2007. See RJN, Ex. E (LDK May 31, 2007 Press Release), at 1.

24

LDK manufactures solar wafers, which are the primary element in a photovolic solar cell

25

that converts sunlight into electricity. (¶ 22.) To manufacture the wafers, LDK treats polysilicon

26

feedstock in a directional solidification system for many hours and transforms this feedstock into

27

multicrystalline ingots, which are fashioned into wafers. See RJN, Ex. A (LDK 2007 F-1), at 1.

LDK uses a research and development lab associated with the Shanghai Jiaotong University to

2

assist with the technical support needed to develop its proprietary processes relating to the

3

analysis and use of its range of polysilicon feedstock, which includes determining the optimal

4

allocation of various feedstock sources and the accurate valuation of LDK’s material quality. Id.

5

at Ex. 10.6, p. 2-3. LDK closely analyzes all of its polysilicon feedstock to determine usability,

6

which involves a quality analysis of all of its feedstock:

7

We adhere to a strict system of quality control over our operations, from the
sourcing of raw materials to production and delivery. We have established
quality-control at each stage of our production process to closely monitor the
quality of our production and to ensure that our solar wafers and ingots meet all
our internal benchmarks and customers’ specifications. In addition, we have
established a quality documentation system for all purchasing, production and
sales units and implemented procedures for constant improvement and flaw
prevention.
....

8
9
10
11
12

We purchase raw materials from trusted suppliers on our approved vendor list
whenever possible and only those suppliers that pass our assessment are admitted
to our approved vendor list. Raw materials are inspected by our quality
management unit. Raw materials which fail to pass our incoming inspection are
returned to the suppliers.

13
14
15

Id. at 75.

16

LDK has 146 employees who perform and supervise these quality control procedures,

17

and the Complaint does not include a reference to any of these individuals as a source, nor any

18

reference to any of the controls as being inadequate or circumvented. These quality control

19

procedures include running several tests at various points along LDK’s production process, such

20

as performing “infra-red scans for impurities, as well as resistivity and life-time tests” on the

21

materials, followed by further tests on the final output. Id. In fact, in February 2007, LDK

22

obtained a Quality Assurance Certification pursuant to ISO 9001, which is a set of quality

23

management control guidelines, accepted around the world. See RJN, Ex. S at 42.4 Essentially,

24

seven months before Situ’s claim, LDK’s quality control procedures over its raw materials and

25

operations generally had been certified under acceptable international standards.

Due to the industry-wide shortage of polysilicon, an essential raw material in the

2

production of solar wafers, one of LDK’s chief competitive advantages is its ability to use

3

recyclable polysilicon to produce solar-grade silicon wafers.5 Contrary to Plaintiff’s suggestion

4

that LDK’s use of polysilicon scraps was a nefarious plot that Plaintiff has unwound, LDK’s

5

registration statement plainly and repeatedly disclosed that it uses recycled and scrap material:

6
7

We have developed proprietary production processes for the use of polysilicon
scraps and recyclable polysilicon in manufacturing our ingots while maintaining
our product quality and performance.

8

...

9

11

To increase our raw material supply and reduce costs, our polysilicon feedstock
also includes polysilicon scrap, polysilicon powder, broken wafers and recyclable
polysilicon sourced from semiconductor manufacturers, equipment vendors and
others, which we use in our ingot manufacturing process. Scraps and recyclable
materials account for the majority of our polysilicon feedstock.

12

...

The Independent Investigation and External Auditors Concluded That Situ’s
Allegations Were Unfounded

On October 3, 2007, a Piper Jaffray analyst disclosed that Charley Situ, LDK’s former
financial controller, made allegations that LDK had fraudulently overstated its polysilicon
inventory. See RJN, Ex. H (October 3, 2007 Piper Jaffray Company Note: LDK Solar Update;
Takeaways From Management Meetings), at 1. While the Piper Jaffray analyst stated that he
“found no reason/proof to dispute management’s claim of 1000MT of polysilicon in
inventory/WIP[,]” LDK’s stock price dropped from $68.31 to $51.65 the following trading day.

Indeed, LDK repeatedly cautioned investors about the industry-wide shortage of polysilicon in
its registration statement. See, e.g., RJN, Ex. A (LDK 2007 F-1), at 10. (“The significant
growth of the solar wafer industry and the competing demand and buying power of the
semiconductor industry have resulted in an industry-wide shortage in solar-grade polysilicon and
a significant increase in solar-grade polysilicon price over the past few years.”).

On October 4, 2007, LDK announced that Situ had been terminated in late September for

2

cause before he made his public allegations regarding LDK’s inventory. See RJN, Ex. B (LDK

3

October 4, 2007 Form 6-K), at 2. LDK also announced that following Situ’s initial allegations,

4

LDK management conducted its own internal investigation and concluded that Situ’s allegations

5

were unfounded. See id. LDK further announced that the Audit Committee of the LDK Board

6

of Directors, which consisted of two independent directors who joined the company after the

7

initial public offering and who are not named as defendants in this case, was also conducting an

8

independent investigation into the allegations.6 See id. After hiring outside independent

9

accountants and Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP as independent outside counsel, the

10

Committee conducted a two-month investigation. See RJN, Ex. C (LDK December 17, 2007

11

12

facts, which they compiled through forensic accounting procedures, testing of the Company’s

13

feedstock by independent experts, review of company and third-party documentation, and

14

interviews of certain present and former Company personnel and third parties. See id.

15

On December 17, 2007, the Audit Committee announced the results of its investigation,

16

which found “no material errors in the Company’s stated silicon inventory quantities as of

17

August 31, 2007, and concluded that Mr. Situ’s allegations of an inventory discrepancy were

18

incorrect because he had not taken into account all locations in which the Company stored its

19

silicon feedstock.” Id. The investigation further concluded that “the Company is using each of

20

its various types of silicon feedstock in the production of its multicrystalline solar wafers, and

21

that a provision for obsolete or excess silicon feedstock is not required.” Id.
Following the conclusion of the internal investigation, LDK announced its third quarter

Well before the independent investigation and extended audit ever completed, LDK was

12

immediately besieged by several strike suits, filed in a knee-jerk reaction to LDK’s stock price

13

decline on October 3. Based entirely on the Situ allegations as reported in the press, the

14

complaints uniformly alleged that LDK had overstated the quantity of its polysilicon inventory

15

before the outside investigators completed their months of investigation, determining that the

16

inventory was correct. This consolidated complaint similarly relies solely on Situ’s unsupported

4

The Complaint claims that Defendants’ statements regarding LDK inventory were false based on

two demonstrably incorrect theories: (1) LDK reported inventory which “did not exist,”7 and (2)

6

the remaining polysilicon inventory was not usable.8 When viewed in its entirety, and in the

When a plaintiff relies on employee allegations regarding falsity, the complaint and

10

documents cited therein must demonstrate that the employee “was qualified to state

11

authoritatively” that the challenged statement was false, and that the employee based his or her

12

opinion on “personal knowledge.” In re Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2007 U.S.

13

Dist. LEXIS 21953, *56-57 (N.D. Cal. 2007).9 In Silicon Storage, plaintiffs alleged that

14

defendant falsely reported its inventory valuation because the market value for certain inventory

15

had fallen below cost. To support this claim, plaintiffs relied in part on the statements made by

16

various employees of the defendant regarding the market price SST’s inventory. The court

17

rejected the opinions of the employees where the complaint did not allege facts to show that

18

those employees would know about the market price of SST’s inventory during the alleged class

19

period. See Silicon Storage, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *55-56.10 As a result, the court

20

concluded that plaintiffs failed to show that defendants’ inventory valuations were false or

misleading.

Similarly, here, Plaintiff fails to establish that Situ’s accusations have any foundation. As

2

discussed above, LDK’s manufacturing process is highly technical and complex, and

3

experienced personnel must closely examine LDK’s polysilicon to determine its usability in the

4

solar wafering manufacturing process. See Section II.A, above. Any person undertaking such an

5

analysis would need technical expertise.

6

Situ, on the other hand, lacks the technical ability necessary to test LDK’s polysilicon.

7

Situ’s degrees in math and business have nothing to do with determining the usability of

8

polysilicon. (¶ 35.) Situ’s CPA license has nothing to do with polysilicon or solar wafers, much

9

less with determining the usability of polysilicon. (Id.) Situ’s former job as an accountant for

10

China GrenTech, a company that provided wireless services, also has nothing to do with

11

determining the usability of polysilicon. (Id.) Plaintiff must show that Situ “was qualified to

12

state authoritatively” that the majority of the LDK’s polysilicon inventory was unusable, and

13

Plaintiff fails to make that showing here.

14

In fact, Situ himself admits that he lacks the expertise to evaluate the usability of

15

polysilicon in the email relied upon heavily by the Complaint. In the email, Situ admits that “it

16

is a little more difficult to revaluate the quality” and relies on speculation that “most employees

17

know the fact that there is little good feedstock for production.” RJN, Ex. F (September 25,

18

2007 email from Charley Situ to Jack Lai, Louis Hsieh and KPMG Hong Kong (“Situ September

19

23, 2007 Email”)), at ¶ 2. Thus, the Complaint and Situ’s allegations both reveal that Situ’s

20

assertion about the technical sufficiency of tons of raw materials is nothing more than rank

21

speculation on his part. In short, Situ’s own words show he has no personal knowledge and is

22

merely parroting the speculation and unspecified rumors.

23

In addition, Situ also admits that he did not consider all of the inventory warehouses

24

when he made his allegations. Contrary to the Complaint’s allegation that “Situ looked not only

25

at items in the warehouse, but also polysilicon located elsewhere, including items in transit [and]

26

materials on the production line…” (¶ 40), Situ admits that he only considered the polysilicon

27

stored in one of LDK’s several warehouses. First, in the email, Situ states that he looked “in

28

warehouse only.” RJN, Ex. F (Situ September 25, 2007 Email), at ¶ 7. His email also says the

scope of his “review” (which he called “FA/IA”) was limited to a single warehouse and did not

“[t]he scope of the FA/IA is the feedstock in warehouse. Feedstock in Material

Id. at ¶ 6. (emphasis added). Since Situ did not consider these other locations where LDK kept

6

inventory, his bald allegation that certain inventory “did not exist” or was unusable must be

7

rejected.

8
9

As depicted below, LDK uses at least four warehouses to store polysilicon, including the
Materials Department warehouse and the Bonded Warehouses where “in transit” material was

10

located until it cleared China’s final customs requirements. All of these warehouses held

11

inventory that Situ admittedly did not verify. The internal investigation and KPMG considered

all of the inventory in LDK’s several warehouses, as well as the tons of inventory in use, and

department and in transit. Contrary to Plaintiff’s allegations, Situ admits he never considered

3

the Complaint does not demonstrate that Situ’s opinion deserves any credence.

4

2.

LDK’s Inventory Was Independently Corroborated

Even if Situ possessed the knowledge and expertise required to evaluate LDK’s

6

inventory, the Complaint would also need to plead facts sufficient to convince the Court that Situ

7

is correct and not merely recounting a difference of opinion. See In re Levi Strauss & Co. Sec.

8

Litig, 527 F. Supp. 2d 965, 987 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (dismissing § 10(b) claim for failure to plead

9

falsity). Levi is instructive. In Levi, two named, high level tax accountants from the defendant’s

10

tax department accused Levi of improperly accounting for tax reserves. Id. at 987-988. The San

11

Francisco Chronicle disclosed the allegations, and the price of Levi securities plummeted. Id. at

12

968. Citing the accountants’ allegations in detail, plaintiffs filed suit and set forth, with

13

particularity, the accountants’ first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing. This Court ruled

14

that the accountants’ allegations were not sufficiently compelling to establish falsity because

15

“plaintiffs have failed to plead facts suggesting improper accounting other than the views

16

expressed by two former employees.” Id. at 987. The Court conclude that: “it [was] more

17

plausible, as defendants suggest, that [the accountants] merely disagree with the tax positions

18

taken by Levi.” Id. at 987.

19

In dismissing the complaint for failure to plead falsity, the Court relied heavily upon

20

three judicially-noticeable facts: (1) “the audit committee’s investigation, with the assistance of

21

outside counsel, did not reveal material false or misleading statements based on the improprieties

22

pled by plaintiffs,” (2) “audited financial statements and filings with the SEC do not reflect any

23

restatements for these improprieties,” and (3) “KPMG issued unqualified audit opinions as to the

24

financial statements.” Id. at 985-988.

25

All three facts are present here and outweigh Situ’s rank speculation about the technical

26

sufficiency of LDK’s inventory. First, as discussed above, a two-month independent

27

investigation, conducted by experts with the knowledge and expertise that Situ lacks, confirmed

28

that LDK correctly accounted for its inventory. Second, following the conclusion of the internal

investigation, LDK announced its third and fourth quarter financial statements for 2007 without

2

any restatement. Third, KPMG, LDK’s external auditors, have given their unqualified opinion

3

supporting LDK’s year-end financials. See RJN, Ex. S (LDK April 7, 2008 Form 20-F Annual

4

Report), at F-2. Thus, according to every sufficiently knowledgeable entity that has conducted a

5

thorough investigation of LDK’s inventory, (1) all of LDK’s stated inventory did exist, and (2)

6

100% of this polysilicon inventory was usable. The only support for Plaintiff’s allegations is

7

Situ, who lacks any credible basis for his bald assertions. Just as in Levi, the Complaint merely

8

cites a former employee, who has a different opinion which is insufficient as a matter of law.

9

Worse, here, Situ admittedly has no basis for his conjecture about LDK’s inventory. Thus, the

10
11
12

Complaint must be dismissed.
3.

The SEC and Research Analysts Also Disagreed With Situ

Plaintiff’s attempt to buttress his thread-bare allegations with the SEC’s informal inquiry

13

and analysts’ reports also fails. (¶ 55.) As of March 24, 2008, the SEC has concluded its

14

informal inquiry and recommended against bringing an enforcement action:

15
16

“This investigation has been completed as to LDK Solar Co. Ltd,
against whom we do not intend to recommend any enforcement
action by the Commission.”

RJN, Ex. G (SEC March 24, 2008 No Enforcement Letter), at 1 (emphasis added); RJN Ex. S

18

(LDK April 7, 2008 Form F-20), at 50, F-28.

19

As to analysts’ reports, Plaintiff asserts that “[a]fter Situ’s allegation became public,

20

analysts and investors realized that LDK had been understating its costs.” (¶ 47.) However, in

21

the October 3, 2007 Piper Jaffray report that first disclosed Situ’s allegations, Pichel concluded

22

that, “[w]e have spoken to the LDK CFO about these claims and have found no reason/proof to

24

(October 3, 2007 Piper Jaffray Company Note: LDK Solar Update; Takeaways From

26

“Outperform,” the highest designation given by Piper Jaffray. See RJN, Ex. I (October 4, 2007

In fact, contrary to Plaintiff’s allegations, Piper Jaffray did not downgrade its

7

recommendation from Outperform to Market Perform until October 31, 2007, for reasons

8

unrelated to Situ’s allegations. In this report, Pichel explained, “[w]e lower estimates for LDK

prices. LDK is highly leveraged to scrap prices at ~80% of its COGS (cost of goods sold).” See

12

13

rating had nothing to do with LDK’s existing inventory in August, 2007.

14

In short, the SEC and analysts did not endorse Situ’s allegations as the Complaint alleges.

LDK’s “Worthless” Inventory Is Not Pled With Particularity

Plaintiff contends that LDK failed to comply with GAAP because it failed to account for

17

its polysilicon inventory at the lower of cost or market. (¶ 51.) Apart from being an

18

oversimplification of GAAP, Plaintiff must plead specific information on both the cost and

market price of LDK’s inventory products to establish that LDK’s inventory was overvalued.

Other analysts in the industry also agreed that the price of scrap polysilicon was rising. For
example, a CIBC World Markets report from December 17, 2007 states that “the rate of increase
for scrap/recycled material has been faster than for virgin material.” See RJN, Ex. O (December

5

Plaintiff here provides none of the requisite detail and specificity to survive dismissal.

6

Plaintiff does not allege either the cost or the market price of LDK’s polysilicon inventory, or

otherwise show that LDK’s valuation was incorrect. Indeed, as discussed above, market prices

for polysilicon scrap rose throughout the class period, rendering LDK’s inventory increasingly

Furthermore, it is uncontroverted that LDK paid a significant amount of money to acquire

14

LDK acquired recycled inventory at market prices through legitimate transactions with third

parties (confirming the inventory was correct) or Plaintiff must plead specific facts showing that

the supply contracts with various third parties are sham transactions, wherein LDK and several

statements are false,” and because, with respect to the alleged GAAP violations, plaintiffs “fails
to explain which line items of the statements were false, why the statements were false, the
amount by which the financial statements were misstated, what provisions of GAAP were
violated, how those provisions were violated, and who was involved in the alleged GAAP
violations.”)

The Complaint and documents referenced in it make clear that there is a full scale market for
the recycled and scrap polysilicon LDK purchased. Plaintiff alleges that a market for such
materials exists but inexplicably alleges that the material becomes worthless merely because
LDK possesses it. Plaintiff’s bald assertions do nothing to reconcile this internal inconsistency.
If nothing else, LDK could simply have resold the material back into the recycled polysilicon
market that it was purchased from, meaning the inventory is not worthless as alleged. Indeed,
given the allegations in the complaint that the price of recycled polysilicon has increased, LDK
would actually make money on its recycled inventory.

Plaintiff’s Bald Assertions Do Not Demonstrate That Defendants Acted
With Actual Knowledge
a.
Situ’s Criticism Of LDK’s Polysilicon Inventory Lacks Foundation
And Is Not Based On Personal Knowledge

Situ’s criticism of LDK’s polysilicon inventory lacks foundation and fails to establish a
“strong inference” of scienter. See Section III-A; In re Siebel Sec. Litig., 2005 WL 3555718
(N.D. Cal. 2005) (allegation derived from a source without personal knowledge of the
circumstances of the alleged fraud fail to give rise to a strong inference of scienter); see also
Nursing Home Pension Fund, Local 144 v. Oracle Corp., 380 F.3d 1226, 1233 (9th Cir. 2004)
(stating that “personal sources of information relied upon in a complaint should be ‘described in
the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position
occupied by the source would possess the information alleged’”) (citation omitted).
Absent personal knowledge, the allegations that Defendants misrepresented the total
amount of polysilicon in LDK’s inventory constitute nothing more than “bald assertions.” Bald
assertions are insufficient as a matter of law to establish a “strong inference” of scienter. See
Elliot Associates, L.P. v. Hayes, 141 F. Supp. 2d 344, 357 (S.D.N.Y 2000) (“[B]ald assertions do
not constitute adequate allegations of scienter.”); see also Griffin v. Ramtek Corp., 1988 WL
159162 at *4 (N.D. Cal. 1988) (“[B]ald assertions are simply insufficient to state the requisite
scienter . . . for a violation of Rule 10b-5.”). Here, Situ admits that he did not look in all the
places where LDK’s inventory was stored, and he has no technical expertise to ascertain the
usability of the inventory. Thus, his assertions regarding inventory and usable inventory are
simply insufficient “bald assertions.”
b.
Plaintiff Fails To Provide Particularized Allegations That Any
Defendant Made Misstatements With Fraudulent Intent
Despite the PSLRA’s requirement that Plaintiff “state with particularity facts giving rise

24

to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind” as to “each alleged

25

misrepresentation or omission,” the Complaint fails to allege any facts about the individual

26

defendants’ state of mind. In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 960 (C.D.

27

even though they are the only individual defendants who allegedly made any misstatements.

2

Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to specifically allege scienter as to these two defendants.

3

Plaintiff’s failure to plead specific facts about the state of mind as to defendants Tong,

4

Yao, Zhu, Shao and Wang is even more egregious as those defendants are not alleged to have

5

made any misstatements. With respect to each of these “non-speaking” defendants, the

6

Complaint provides a generic allegation that appears to be copied from boilerplate in virtually

7

every securities complaint:

8

[D]efendants acted with scienter in that they knew that the public documents and
statements issued or disseminated in the name of the Company were materially
false or misleading; knew that such statements would be issued or disseminated to
the investing public; and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced
in the issuance or dissemination of such statements or documents as primary
violators of the federal securities laws.

9
10
11

(¶ 133.) This boilerplate language cannot satisfy Plaintiff’s obligation of pleading specific facts
12
creating a strong inference as to each Defendant individually. There is not a single specific fact
13
alleged regarding the acts, statements, or state of mind of these defendants.
14

To the extent Plaintiff relies on the “group pleading” doctrine16 to establish liability of

15
these five individuals, the allegations contained in the Complaint are woefully inadequate.
16
Plaintiff fails to allege particular facts to show that any of the five non-speaking defendants
17
“were directly involved in the preparation of the allegedly misleading statements,” or “specify
18
which of the allegedly misleading statements provide the basis for” application of the group
19

Plaintiff’s Allegations Of Accounting Fraud Fall Short Of Establishing A
“Strong Inference” Of Scienter

Plaintiff’s unsupported allegation that LDK’s accounting violated GAAP does not

10

establish a “strong inference” of scienter. (¶¶ 2, 8, 48-53, 61-66, 88-95, 106-109, 132.) As this

11

Court noted in In re Pacific Gateway Exch., Inc., Sec. Litig., 169 F. Supp. 2d 1160, 1167 (N.D.

12

Cal. 2001), mere “allegations of failure to follow GAAP are not adequate to establish scienter,

13

because scienter requires more than a misapplication of accounting principles” (quoting In re

14

Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., 35 F.3d 1407, 1426 (9th Cir. 1994)). To plead a strong inference

15

of fraud in cases alleging accounting fraud, Plaintiff must provide copious detail of such

16

misconduct, rather than allege in mere general terms that Defendants failed to comply with

17

GAAP. See In re FVC.COM Sec. Litig., 136 F. Supp. 2d 1031, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2000)

18

(dismissing complaint that failed to plead accounting fraud in great detail); see also In re ICN

19

Pharms. Inc. Sec. Litig., 299 F. Supp. 1055, 1067 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (“GAAP violations must be

20

pled with particularity.”) (citation omitted).

21

Here, Plaintiff’s sole basis for alleging accounting fraud rests on Situ’s claim that

22

inventory did not exist (although he did not count it) and the remaining inventory is worthless

23

(although he is not qualified to test it). As discussed, Situ’s assertions simply cannot be relied

24

upon as they lack foundation and are not based on personal knowledge.

25

Moreover, Plaintiff cannot meet his high pleading burden under the PSLRA by simply

26

alleging a disagreement with LDK’s inventory valuation. As discussed above, independent

27

experts performed a thorough two-month investigation and KPMG gave its unqualified opinion

28

corroborating LDK’s inventory figures, and the SEC has concluded that Situ’s allegations do not

warrant an investigation. This process of thoroughly investigating the inventory and months of

2

review by various independent third parties belies Plaintiff’s attempt to establish a “strong

3

inference” of an intent to deceive. See In re Hansen Natural Corp. Sec. Litig., 527 F. Supp.2d

4

1142, 1158 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (finding that defendant’s independent auditors’ unqualified opinion

5

that the financial statements presented fairly the financial position of the company during the

6

relevant period, was “highly probative” of an absence of scienter); see also In re Wet Seal Secs.

7

Litig., 518 F. Supp. 2d 1148, at 1166 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (finding that Deloitte’s approval or the

8

defendant’s financial statements “weighs against scienter as well”).

9

Contrary to the Complaint, the new line item for “non-current inventory” in LDK’s fourth

10

quarter financial results is not an admission that the earlier financials were incorrect. (¶ 59.)

11

Rather, the line item reflects a new, fourth quarter event. As illustrated in LDK’s financials and

12

explained by Peng in the analyst call cited by Plaintiff, LDK acquired an additional 613 MT of

13

polysilicon in the fourth quarter. See RJN Exs. R, V at 16. This new shipment increased the

14

quantity of polysilicon in LDK’s inventory by over 60%. See RJN Ex. V at 16. LDK uses a

15

proprietary blend of polysilicon in producing wafers, and the new shipment, in combination with

16

the pre-existing inventory, increased LDK’s quantity of certain types of feedstock to an amount

17

which would not likely be fully used within 12 months. See RJN Exs. R, V. Accordingly, LDK

18

classified this portion of its inventory as non-current under FASB 43.17 Put differently, this

19

classification reflects a fourth quarter event caused by a substantial increase in LDK’s inventory

20

in 4Q07; it is not an indication that financials in prior quarters were wrong as now alleged.18

ATTORNEYS AT LAW

Plaintiff’s assertion that classifying a portion of inventory in 4Q07 as “non-current” somehow
proves that all of the 3Q07 inventory was unusable is also an absurd distortion of the accounting
rules. The non-current classification does not mean the inventory is unusable. If LDK’s
inventory was non-existent or unusable – as Plaintiff contends – it would be written off
completely, not simply classified as non-current. So the 4Q07 “reclassification” of less than
10% of LDK’s inventory as non-current does not show that 3Q07 inventory was useless.
Moreover, as a matter of law, Plaintiff’s allegations regarding this “non-current” line item are
irrelevant. Even if the new category of inventory represented some type of reclassification of the
polysilicon—which it clearly does not—Plaintiff still has not adequately pled falsity under the
PSLRA: “even a delinquent write-down of the impaired assets, without anything more, does not
state a claim of securities fraud, stating at best a bad business decision.” In re ICN Pharms., Inc.,
299 F. Supp. 2d 1055, at 1065 (C.D. Cal. 2004).
18
The Oppenheimer analyst report cited by Plaintiff as corroborating LDK’s alleged deception
regarding the inventory (¶ 59) states only that management “did not provide much detail” on the

Defendants’ Lack Of Stock Sales Weighs Strongly Against Scienter

The fact that none of the individual defendants sold a single share of LDK stock during

3

the Class Period further undercuts any “strong inference” of scienter. Courts in this district – and

4

across the country – have held that “the absence of insider trading by a defendant is highly

5

relevant and undermines any inference of scienter.” In re Pixar, Inc. Sec. Litig., 450 F. Supp. 2d

6

1096, 1107 (N.D. Cal. 2006); see also In re Petsmart, Inc. Sec. Litig., 61 F. Supp. 2d 982, 1000

7

(D. Ariz. 1999) (“we find that defendant . . . did not sell any shares of stock during the class

8

period and there can be no argument therefore that she was motivated to defraud Petsmart

9

investors by a desire to maximize personal economic benefit.”).

10

Despite the utter lack of any insider trading or sale of any shares of LDK’s stock,

11

Plaintiff suggests that an inference of scienter nonetheless exists because each of the Defendants

12

had numerous shares of LDK stock and each stood to gain by the stock’s artificially inflated

13

price. (¶¶ 82, 83.) Plaintiff’s argument is misplaced. In In re Tibco Software Sec. Litig., 2006

14

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36666 at *56-63 (N.D. Cal. 2006), the court held that plaintiffs allegations

15

regarding certain individual defendants’ stock sales fell short of meeting the required pleading

16

standard under the PSLRA because they failed to show that defendants were motivated to

17

commit fraud. There, several of the defendants – including the individual alleged to have the

18

greatest access to inside information and held more than 14 million shares and vested options –

19

did not sell any shares of stock, which the Court found dispositive.

20

Here, as in Tibco, Defendants’ mere ownership of stock does not create a strong

21

inference of scienter, especially where not one share was sold by a single Defendant. The

22

Complaint concedes that each of the individual defendants actually held on to his shares

nothing to do with the inventory allegations by Situ. Other analysts, such as Dr. Pierre
Maccagno from Needham & Company, LLC, who directly addressed the “non current” inventory
classification, reported that management “provid[ed] answers to key questions.” Maccagno

stake in LDK. As Plaintiff acknowledges, “Peng lost some $2.31 billion” and “each of the

2

Individual Defendants owned large blocks of LDK options whose value dropped dramatically

3

. . . .” (¶¶ 82, 83.) Thus, the fact that Defendants sold nothing and lost billions of dollars

4

undercuts any inference that they engaged in fraudulent activity to maximize personal gain.

5

Plaintiff’s speculation that Defendants concealed the truth about LDK’s financial

6

condition in order to raise capital to complete the IPO and to artificially inflate the price of

7

LDK’s stock after the IPO also does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter. (¶ 28.) As a

8

matter of law, mere allegations regarding LDK’s desire for a successful completion of an IPO or

9

to maintain the appearance of corporate profitability do not establish a “strong inference” of

10

scienter. See Caiafa v. Sea Containers Ltd., 525 F. Supp. 2d 398, at 412-413 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)

11

(“[T]he alleged desires to raise additional capital in a private placement or to maintain

12

compliance with the financial covenants of a company loan agreement . . . are . . . inadequate to

13

support an allegation of intent to commit fraud.”). See also Chill v. Gen. Elec. Co., 101 F.3d

14

263, 268 (2d Cir. 1996) (“The motive to maintain the appearance of corporate profitability . . .

15

does not entail concrete benefits.”).

16

Simply stated, Plaintiff fails to allege that any individual defendant derived a tangible,

17

personal benefit from any alleged fraud or misrepresentation. These facts significantly

18

undermine any inference of scienter, let alone a “strong inference” as required by the PSLRA.

19

4.

Scienter Cannot Be Inferred From The Individual Defendants’ Positions

Lacking any legitimate grounds, Plaintiff makes the desperate argument that a strong

21

inference of scienter can be inferred by the mere fact that Defendants are officers or directors of

22

LDK and their “associations with the Company.” (¶ 133.) This argument, however, has been

23

squarely rejected by the Ninth Circuit.

24

In In re Read-Rite Corp. Sec. Litig., 335 F.3d 843, 848 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit

25

rejected the notion that a plaintiff pleads a strong inference of scienter based solely on an

26

individual’s position within the company, and held that even when an individual defendant is an

27

officer or director, a plaintiff must still “plead ‘particular facts in the complaint’ that ‘raise a

28

strong inference’ that misleading statements were [made] knowingly or [with] deliberate

recklessness.” Id. The Read-Rite court further reasoned that even if the plaintiffs may have

2

established a “reasonable inference” that the defendants would be aware of the falsity of some or

3

all of the statements at issue based on their job duties, the existence of a “reasonable inference”

4

would not satisfy PSLRA’s requirement that plaintiffs allege particular facts that give rise to a

5

“strong inference” of scienter. Id. at 848-49.

6

Other courts have similarly rejected the argument that scienter can be inferred merely

7

from a defendant’s position in the company. In In re Apple Computer, Inc., 243 F. Supp. 2d

8

1012, 1026 (C.D. Cal. 2002), the court found that allegations that the senior officers had a

9

“hands on management style” and that the CEO “runs every aspect of the business” were

10
11
12
13

insufficient to establish a “strong inference” of scienter:
It is not enough for Plaintiffs to allege that Defendants could have known about
the [] problems, or even that they should have known about them. Plaintiffs must
allege something approaching actual knowledge on the part of [senior officers]
who made statements regarding the company. Because they do not, their claim
regarding alleged misrepresentations [] fails.

14

Id.; see also In re Autodesk, Inc. Sec. Litig., 132 F. Supp. 2d 833, 844 (N.D. Cal. 2000)

15

(“plaintiffs must do more than allege that these key officers had the requisite knowledge by

16

virtue of their ‘hands on’ positions, because that would eliminate the necessity for specially

17

pleading scienter, as any corporate officer could be said to possess the requisite knowledge by

18

virtue of his or her position.”).

19

Here, Plaintiff attempts to establish a “strong inference” of scienter regarding LDK’s

20

CEO, Peng, by alleging that “Peng tightly controlled the Company, especially its finances.”

21

(¶ 73.) But those feeble allegations are insufficient. As Apple Computer illustrates, mere

22

allegations that the CEO is heavily involved in every aspect of the business are insufficient to

23

show a strong inference of scienter.

24

With respect to the other individual defendants, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts which

25

establish a finding of a “strong inference” of scienter. Instead, Plaintiff merely alleges that by

26

virtue of their individual positions, the individual defendants acted with a “strong inference” of

27

scienter because they were in “receipt of information reflecting the true facts regarding LDK,

without any averment showing that an individual defendant had actual knowledge and then made

6

false or misleading statements – fail as a matter of law.

7

Finally, the fact that the Defendants signed SEC filings as officers and directors of the

8

Company does not establish a “strong inference” of scienter. (¶ 133.) As a matter of law,

9

general allegations that a defendant signed a registration statement or other publicly filed SEC

10

document does not establish a strong inference of scienter. See In re Infonet Services Corp. Sec.

11

Litig., 310 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1103 (C.D. Cal. 2003) (finding strong showing of scienter not

12

satisfied with general allegations that individual defendants signed registration statement).

13

Indeed, “[i]f that were true, ‘scienter would be established in every case where there was an

14

accounting error or auditing mistake made by a publicly traded company, thereby eviscerating

15

the pleading requirements for scienter set forth in the PSLRA.’” In re Hansen Natural Corp. Sec.

16

Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1159-1160 (C.D. Cal. 2007). Because Plaintiff has not alleged a

17

single fact regarding the individual defendants suggesting their actual knowledge of a

18

misstatement, the individual defendants signatures on those public filings do not give rise to a

19

“strong inference” of scienter.

The Complaint Attacks Forward-Looking Statements Protected by The Safe
Harbor Provision of the PSLRA

Various alleged misstatements made by LDK are protected forward-looking statements
that are not actionable. The PSLRA provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements that
are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c); Employers
Teamsters Local Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Trust Fund v. Clorox Co., 353 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th
Cir. 2004) (noting that the PSLRA created a statutory version of the bespeaks caution doctrine by
providing a safe harbor for forward-looking statements). A forward-looking statement is any
statement regarding (1) financial projections, (2) plans and objectives of management for future

operations, (3) future economic performance, or (4) the assumptions underlying or related to any

2

of these issues. See Knollenberg v. Harmonic, Inc., 152 Fed. Appx. 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2005).

3

Here, the Complaint seeks recovery for various non-actionable forward-looking

4

statements throughout the Complaint. Including, for example:
• In summary, we remained focused on achieving our vision of becoming the largest,
lowest cost producer of solar wafers and do not intend to compete with our
customers. (¶ 27) (emphasis added);

•

[W]e believe that our polysilicon feedstock inventory and commitments from
suppliers and sufficient to satisfy over 90% of our estimated requirements for 2007
and approximately 50% of our estimated requirements for 2008. (¶ 86) (emphasis
added);

•

In addition to ramping our production lines, we continued to make progress on our
cost reduction efforts through further advancements of our production processes. . . .
By augmenting our strategy upstream, we believe we will enhance our cost
efficiencies . . . . (¶ 97) (emphasis added);

•

We think we have many advantages by our strategic location with our facility cost,
with our operating cost. We believe that we can get to very competitive cost in a
very short period of time. (¶¶ 73, 116) (emphasis added).

There can be no doubt that these statements are forward-looking as they are based on projections

16

of future need and cannot be disproven until some time in the future. See In re Copper Mountain

17

Sec. Litig., 311 F. Supp. 2d 857 at 880 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (granting motion to dismiss where

18

forward-looking statements in company press releases, SEC filings, conference calls and follow-

19

up conversations, constituted forecasts of future revenues and were predictions regarding the

20

company’s future economic performance, and were therefore entitled to safe harbor protection).

21

The Complaint, premised on attacking such forward looking statements, should be dismissed.

D.

The Complaint Fails to Plead Loss Causation

23

Under the PSLRA, Plaintiff must establish that Defendants’ alleged conduct proximately

24

caused, and not just “touched upon” the economic loss at issue. Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo,

25

544 U.S. 336, 342 (2005); In re Daou Systems, Inc. Securities Litig., 411 F.3d 1006, 1025 (9th

26

Cir. 2005). Accordingly, Plaintiff must plead facts to show that the Defendants’ alleged

27

misrepresentation actually caused the alleged losses by connecting the drop in stock price to a

28

corrective disclosure, i.e. “the truth mak[ing] its way into the market place.” Dura Pharms., 544

U.S. at 342; see also In re Impax Labs., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 723, at **13-16 (N.D. Cal. 2007)

2

(dismissing complaint for failure to plead loss causation because the announcement that caused

3

the stock price to decline “did not represent a public disclosure of the truth with respect to [the

4

company]’s alleged material misstatements” at issue). In addition, Plaintiff must also plead facts

5

ruling out the possibility that the lowered stock price “‘reflect[s] not the earlier

6

misrepresentation, but changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new

7

industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions or other events.’” In re Omnicom Group, Inc.

8

Sec. Litig., 2008 WL 243788 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). One of the many alternate causes which

9

Plaintiff must address is “investor skittishness” caused by the specter of “impropriety.” Id. at *7.

10

Plaintiff here does not – and cannot – identify a corrective disclosure correcting a

11

previous misstatement by LDK. At most, Situ’s allegations may have raised the specter that

12

LDK’s financial statements may contain inaccuracies, and Plaintiffs plead no facts to rule out the

13

possibility of investor skittishness stemming from China’s unproven economy and mercurial

14

political environment. Instead, Plaintiff merely alleges that “the timing and magnitude of LDK’s

15

stock price” negates all other potential reasons for the decline. This is the exact type of

16

boilerplate language judged inadequate by the Supreme Court in Dura Pharm., at 339-40.

17

Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to plead loss causation.

18

E.

The Complaint Fails To State A 20(a) Claim

19

As discussed above, because there is no violation of §10(b), there can be no control

20

person liability under Section 20(a) for any of the individual defendants. See Lipton v.

21

Pathogenesis Corp., 284 F.3d 1027, 1035 n.15 (9th Cir. 2002) (“to prevail on their claims for

22

violations of § 20(a) and § 20A, plaintiffs must first allege a violation of § 10(b) or Rule 10b-5”).

23

For this reason alone, Plaintiff’s 20(a) claim should be dismissed.

24

IV.

25

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.
