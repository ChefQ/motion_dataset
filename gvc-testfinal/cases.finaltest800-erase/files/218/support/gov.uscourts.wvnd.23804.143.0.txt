DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFE'S MARKMAN
RESPONSE BRIEFS

Defendants, Wilson Works, Inc. ("Wilson"), NAES Power Contractors, Inc.
("NAES"), Minnotte Contracting Corporation ("Minnotte"), and Foster Wheeler Zack,
Inc., collectively and jointly file this Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Response Briefs (Doc.
Nos. 140, 141 and 142) for failure to comply with this Court's Scheduling Order dated
September 18, 2009 (Doc. No. 76) and for exceeding the scope of a proper responsive
pleading.

A. Background
1. The Court entered a Scheduling Order on September 18, 2009. See Doc.

No. 76.

#1817962
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-USK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 2of17 PagelD #: 1041

2. Pursuant to the Scheduling Order, all parties were required to file
Markman Briefs on September 1, 2010.

3. The Defendants each filed Markman Briefs on September 1, 2010. See
Doc. No. 133 (Wilson Works, Inc.'s Markman Brief); Doc. No. 134 (Minnotte's
Markman Brief); Doc. No. 135 (NAES Power Contractors, Inc.'s Markman Brief); and
Doc. No. 136 (Foster Wheeler Zack, Inc.'s Markman Brief).'

4. Plaintiff failed to file any Markman brief on September 1, 2010, despite
this Court's Scheduling Order.

5, Pursuant to the Scheduling Order, all parties were required to file
Markman Responses on September 15, 2010.

6. On September 15, 2010, Wilson and Minnotte filed Markman Responses.
(See Doc, Nos. 138 and 139, respectively).

7. Plaintiff failed to file any Markman Response on September 15, 2010,
despite this Court's Scheduling Order.

8. On September 16, 2010, Plaintiff filed "responses" to three of the
Defendants' Markman Briefs. See Doc. No. 140 (Plaintiff's Response to NAES
Markman Brief); Doc. No. 141 (Plaintiff's Response to Minnotte's Markman Brief): and.
Doc, No. 142 (Plaintiff's Response to Wilson's Markman Brief). (Plaintiffs' filings are
hereinafter referred to collectively as "Plaintiff's Responses" or "Responses").

9. Defendants respectfully submit that the Court, pursuant to F. R. Civ, P.
16(f\(1)(C), strike the "Responses" filed by Plaintiff for failure to obey a scheduling or

other pretrial order, as permitted by F. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(Gi)-(vil).

 

' Defendant Northco has never responded to the Complaint and did not file a Markman brief. Also, it is
believed that Defendant Day & Zimmerman NPS, Inc. reached a settlement prior to the September |, 2010
Markman brief deadline.
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 3 of 17 PagelD #: 1042

10. Moreover, as set forth in L. R. Civ. P. 37.01: "Counsel and parties are
subject to sanctions for failures and lack of preparation specified in Fed. R, Civ. P. 16(f)
respecting pretrial conferences and orders." |

11, LR. Civ. P. 37.01 is specifically incorporated in this Court's Scheduling
Order of September 8, 2009: "Counsel and parties are subject to sanctions for failures
and lack of preparation specified in Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) and L. R. Civ. P. 37.01
respecting pretrial conferences and orders." See Doc. No. 76 at cent 18.

12. The relief sought by Defendants is not extraordinary and has been
accepted by other courts. See Coupled Products, LLC v. Nobel Automotive Mexico, LLC,
No. 09-cv-0323, WL 2035829 (W.D. La. May 14, 2010), a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 1.

13. In Coupled Products, the parties filed a joint claim construction statement
identifying disputed claim terms and each party's associated constructions. See id. at *J,
However, the plaintiff then filed its brief with new constructions. See id The defendant
moved to strike the portions of that brief with the new constructions. See id. The Court
eranted the motion, finding that the plaintiff seriously breached the Court's scheduling
order. See id. at *2. The Court stated that the defendants were "denied the opportunity to
address Plaintiff's revised constructions" and that those revisions "violatejd] both the
letter and the spirit of the Scheduling Order." Jd.

B. Plaintiff Waived its Right to File a Markman Response
14. Plaintiff failed to comply with this Court's Scheduling Order, which

required Markman Briefs to be filed on or before September 1, 2010.
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 4of17 PagelD #: 1043

15. Further, at no time between September 1 and September 16 did Plaintiff
request an extension (from counsel or the Court) to file a Markman Brief.

16. Moreover, in its Responses, Plaintiff failed to provide any reason for its
failure to comply with this Court's Scheduling Order.

17. The Scheduling Order was entered on September 18, 2009, and provided
Plaintiff with nearly one full year to prepare and file a Markman Brief.

18. | Most importantly, the Scheduling Order provided an organized and fair
procedure for the parties to submit their respective claim construction arguments, with
each party having the opportunity to respond to the other parties' arguments.

19. This organized procedure, if followed by the parties, eliminated the need
for reply briefs. |

20. By failing to file a Markman Brief and later raising all of its arguments in
a "response" brief, Plaintiff effectively eliminated the Defendants' ability to respond to
Plaintiff's arguments.

21. Plaintiff should not be rewarded for its failure to comply with this Court's
orders and "get the last word" on all claim construction issues.

22. Defendants are unfairly prejudiced by Plaintiff's tactics and respectfully
request relief from the Court in the form of an order striking Plaintiff's Responses, for
failure to comply with the Court's Scheduling Order.

C. Plaintiff's "Responses" are Untimely
23. Even if this Court were to permit Plaintiff to file a Markman Response,

despite having failed to file a Markman Brief, Plaintiffs "Responses" were untimely filed.
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 5of17 PagelD #: 1044

24. The Scheduling Order was clear, unambiguous and not open to

interpretation:

25. The Scheduling Order required Markman Responses to be filed on
September 15, 2010.

26. By filing its Responses on September 16, 2010, Plaintiff failed to comply
with this Court's Scheduling Order.

27. Defendants respectfully request relief from the Court in the form of an
order striking Plaintiff's Responses for being untimely filed.
D. Plaintiff's "Responses" Go Far Beyond Responses to Defendants' Markman

Briefs

28. Plaintiff's Responses go beyond responses to the Markman Briefs filed by

the Defendants.
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 6 of 17 PagelD #: 1045

29, First, Plaintiffs Responses set forth Plaintiffs "Background and
Motivation for the Patent." See Doc. No. 140 at p. 4; Doc. No. 141 at p. 4; and Doc. 142
at p. 4.

30. Describing Plaintiff s take on the prior art and the "motivation" behind the
invention described in the Patent-in-Suit are not issues for a responsive pleading, and
should have properly been raised in an initial Markman Brief.

31. Second, Plaintiffs Responses set forth Plaintiff's legal arguments on .
"Claim Construction Legal Standards." See Doc. No. 140 at p. 6; Doc. No. 141 at p. 6;
and Doc. 142 at p. 6.

32, Again, Plaintiff's legal arguments relate to the issues of general claim
construction; the hierarchy of intrinsic versus extrinsic evidence; importing limitations
from the specification; and term usage and claim differentiation, all issues that properly
should have been raised in an initial Markman brief, not slipped into a purported

`responsive pleading.

33. Third, in its Responses, Plaintiff raises its position that many of the claim
terms should be construed consistent with their plain meanings. See Doc. No. 140; Doc.
No. 141; and Doc. 142.

34, - If Plaintiff wished to take the position that most of the claims should be
construed consistent with their plain meaning, Plaintiff should have taken the time to
state this position in an initial Markman Brief, not as a critique on Defendants' proposed

constructions.
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 7 of 17 PagelD #: 1046

35. Fourth, Plaintiffs Responses set forth Plaintiff's specific proposed
constructions for several of the claim terms rather than only responding to Defendants'
proposed constructions.

36. As set forth in more detail below, Plaintiff offers a "Proposed Alternative
Construction" for many of the terms, which should have properly been raised in an initial
Markman Brief, not in a response.

37. Fifth, many of the asserted claims contain "means for ..." language.

38. Federal Circuit case law clearly provides that when claims are written in a
means-plus-function format pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7112(6), a two-step analysis is used to
construe their meaning: "First, we determine the claimed function. Second, we identity
the corresponding structure in the written description that performs that function." JVW
Enterprises, Inc. v. Interact Accessories, Inc., 424 F.3d 1324, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
(citing Omega Eng'g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1322 (ed. Cir. 2003)).

39. By failing to file a Markman Brief, Plaintiff failed to identify for the Court
the claimed function for these claims and the corresponding structure in the written
description that performs that function.

40, These are not "response" issues, but rather, issues that should have
properly been raised in an initial Markman Brief.

Al, More specificaliy, with respect to NAES' proposed claim construction,
Plaintiff provides its own "Proposed Alternative Construction" for the following claim
terms:

a. Claim 1 - "one of said clamp members including a

threaded bore extending therethough" (Doc. 140 at
pp. 14 and 19);
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 8 of 17 PagelD #: 1047

at pp. 15 and 19);

c. Claims 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 - "pair" (Doc.
140 at pp. 15 and 19);

20).

42. With respect to Minnotte's proposed claim construction, Plaintiff provides
its own proposed construction for the following claim terms:

a. Claim 1 - "means moving the clamp members
toward each other for secure clamping
engagement" (Doc. No. 141, App. A at pp. 3-4);

b. Claim 1 - "bolt means connecting said clamp
members for moving the clamp members towards
each other and enabling the clamp members to be
moved away from each other and to be separated,
said bolt means including a headed bolt having a
threaded end portion," (Doc. No. 141, App. A at

pp. 5-6);

c. Claim 1 - "single bolt' (Doc. No. 141, App. A at p.
)s

d. Claim 3 - "the threaded bore is formed in the clamp

member positioned inwardly of the boiler wall
tubes" (Doc. No. 141, App. A at pp. 8-9);

euro. Claim 4 - "means moving the clamp members
towards each other for secure clamping
engagement with adjacent ends of the tube for
maintaining them in alignment while connecting the
ends of the tube by welding" (Doc. No. 141, App. A
at pp. 10-11);

f, Claim 4 - "bolt means connecting said clamp
members for moving the clamp members towards
each other and enabling the clamp members to be
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 9 of 17 PagelD #: 1048

moved away from each other and to be separated,
said bolt means including a headed bolt having a
threaded end portion" (Doc. No. 141, App. A at pp.
12-13);

g. Claim 4 - "single recess therein" (Doc. No. 141,
App. A at p. 14);

h, Claim 7 - "recess means therein to engage adjacent
ends of at least one boiler wall tube on opposite
sides of a juncture between the adjacent tube ends"
(Doc. No. 141, App. A at p. 17);

i. Claim 7 - "means moving the clamp members
towards each other for secure clamping
engagement" (Doc. No. 141, App. A at pp. 18-19);

j. Claim 7 - "bolt means extending between the tubes
in the areas from which the webs have been
removed' (Doc. No. 141, App. A at pp. 19-20);

k. Claim 10 - "bolt means moving the clamp members
towards each other for secure clamping
engagement of the adjacent ends of a pair of boiler
wall tubes for maintaining them in alignment while
connecting the ends of the tubes by welding" (Doc.
No. 141, App. A at pp. 24-25);

L Claim 10 - "single bolt' (Doc. No. 141, App. A at p.
26);

m. Claim 11 - "a single recess therein to engage
adjacent ends of a boiler wall tube on opposite
sides of a juncture between the adjacent ends"
(Doc. No. 141, App. A at pp. 28-29); and

n. Claim 11 - "bolt means moving the clamp members
towards each other for secure clamping
engagement of the adjacent ends of the boiler wall
tube for maintaining them in alignment while
connecting the ends of the tube by welding" (Doc.
No. 141, App. A at pp. 29-30).
Case 1:09-cv-00048-IMK-JUSK Document 143 Filed 09/21/10 Page 10 of 17 PagelD #:
1049

43, With respect to Wilson's proposed claim construction, Plaintiff provides
its own proposed construction for the following claim terms:

a. Claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 - "periphery"
(Doc. No, 142 at pp. 12-13); `

b. Claims 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 - "threaded bore" (Doc.
No. 142 at pp. 13-14);

C. Claims 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 - "single" (Doc. No.
142 at pp. 14-15); and

d. Claims 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 - "pair" (Doc.
No. 142 at pp. 14-15).

44. All of the aforementioned factual and legal arguments should have
properly been raised in an initial Markman brief, not in a response.

45. By waiting until after Defendants filed both their Markman Briefs and
Markman Responses, Plaintiff has unfairly obtained the last word on these issues and the
only word on its proposed constructions.

46, By providing its original claim constructions after the deadline in the
Scheduling Order for filing a' Markman Response, Plaintiff has climinated the
Defendants' opportunity provided to respond,

47, Defendants are unfairly prejudiced by Plaintiffs tactics and respectfully
request relief for the Court in the form of an order striking Plaintiff's Responses, for
failure to comply with the Court's Scheduling Order.

E. Conclusion

48. Accordingly, Defendants respectfully request that this Court strike the

"Responses" filed by Plaintiff (Doc. Nos. 140, 141 and 142). Moreover, Defendants

respectfully request that Plaintiff be prohibited from disputing the claim constructions set
