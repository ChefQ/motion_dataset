UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR
MORE DEFINITIVE
STATEMENT (ECF NO. 53)

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 55 Filed 06/19/18 Page 2 of 5

The United States of America, through undersigned counsel, submits this
Response to Defendants’ “Reply and Motion for a More Definitive Statement”
(ECF No. 53).
On April 27, 2018, the Court entered an Order (ECF No. 27) denying the
Defendants’ motions challenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction (ECF Nos.
11 and 12). On May 15, 2018, the Court denied (ECF No. 46) the Defendants’
second motion challenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 39).
The Court’s May 15, 2018 Order warned the Defendants that “the filing of
improper and frivolous motions may result in the imposition of sanctions.” (ECF
No. 46 p. 2.) Finally, on May 30, 2018, the Court—noting that “the Cromar
Defendants’ Motion to Strike is at least their third attempt to challenge this Court’s
subject matter jurisdiction” and threating the imposition of sanctions if such
attempts continue—denied yet another frivolous attempt to dismiss this case. (ECF
No. 51.)
In defiance of the Court’s previous Orders, the Defendants filed yet another
motion challenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 53) on June 5,
2018. This motion raises the same frivolous arguments that were previously
dismissed by the Court on at least three prior occasions. For the same reasons set
forth in the Court’s April 27, 2018, May 15, 2018, and May 30, 2018 Orders, the
Defendants’ motion should be denied.
As previously noted by this Court, “[s]everal federal statutes authorize the
court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction in this case.” (ECF No. 30 p. 1.) Those
statutes include 28 U.S.C. § 1345, 28 U.S.C. § 1340, 26 U.S.C. § 7402, and 26

U.S.C. § 7403. The 10th Circuit has held that these statutes grant the district courts
with subject matter jurisdiction. See U.S. v. Wells Fargo Home Morg., 631
Fed.Appx. 632, 632-35 (10th Cir. 2015); United States v. Dawes, 161 Fed. Appx.
742, 745 (10th Cir. 2005); United States v. Novotny, 71 Fed. Appx. 792, 795 (10th
Cir. 2003).
In this action, the United States’ Complaint sets forth multiple bases for the
subject-matter jurisdiction of this Court. It is an action commenced by the United
States seeking to enforce the United States tax laws. See 28 U.S.C. § 1340 & 1345.
It is an action arising under Section 7402 that seeks a judgment against Defendant
Paul Cromar for unpaid federal income tax assessments. And, it is an action
seeking to foreclose on real property located in Utah County, Utah: property in
which Defendants Paul Cromar and Barbara Ann Cromar may claim an interest.
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the United States respectfully
requests that the Court deny the Cromars’ motion. Additionally, the Court has now
twice warned the Cromars that filing frivolous motions such as the instant motion
would result in sanctions. (ECF No. 48 p. 3; ECF No. 46 p. 2.) The United States
accordingly requests that the Court impose sanctions for the Cromars’ most-recent
filing.
