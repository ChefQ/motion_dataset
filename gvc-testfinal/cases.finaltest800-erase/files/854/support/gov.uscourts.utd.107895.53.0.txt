Defendants' Reply

Motion for a More Definitive Statement

BARBARA ANN CROMAR, et al.
Defendants.

Defendants' Reply and
Motion for a More Definitive Statement
1)

Comes now, Paul Kenneth: Cromar and Barbara Ann: Cromar, Defendants, prose, en

pauperis, in this matter, who hereby file this Reply to the plaintiff's improper arbitrary and

capricious invocation of authority in this civil action against these specific defendants, and

hereby Moves this court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (F.R.C.P.) Rule 12(e)
to compel the plaintiff to provide (on the record of the action) a more definitive statement
establishing the complete, fully granted, subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that it is
alleged by the plaintiff, can be taken over this civil action by this federal district court.

2)

The reason why this is necessary is because the plaintiff continues to fail in its duty to

disclose in this action the complete and specific constitutional foundational elements of
the subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that it invokes, and has refused to specifically
identify, even the exact constitutionally granted taxing power and alleged enforcement
authority that applies to the claims of the tax, alleged owed by the defendants, that are
made in the plaintiff's arbitrary and non-specific Complaint that was filed in this action.

3)

Further, the plaintiff United States, in the federal district court of New Jersey, in Case

Number: 2:14-cv-3937 (KM)(JBC), was happy to accept that district court's ruling and
holding in that case (still in the district court today), that the federal personal income tax is
a direct tax (and direct taxing power) that is newly authorized under the 16th Amendment
without the constitutional limitations that are imposed on all direct taxation that is
authorized to be enforced under Article I of the U.S. Constitution;

(Order extract

Exhibited)
4)

However, in Case Number: 3:15cv161, currently in the federal district court in Eastern

Virginia (Richmond Division), the plaintiff United States was just as happy, by their
brazen and shameless duplicity, to accept in that case exactly the opposite, i.e.: the federal
district court held that the federal income tax is only constitutionally authorized as an
indirect tax under the Article I, Section 8, clause 1, taxing authorities, which are subject to

the rule of uniformity established thereunder.

The federal district court in Virginia ruled

that the federal personal income tax is not a direct tax under the 16th Amendment at all!
(Order extract Exhibited)

5)

The plaintiffs inconsistent, arbitrary and capricious acceptance of the invocation by

the federal court of completely different subject-matter jurisdictions and alleged taxing
authorities of the U.S. Constitution to enforce the same tax differently in the different
States, is not only unconstitutional, it is reprehensible, and incomprehensible.
6)

Which authority is alleged to apply to this case, and these defendants? - The plaintiff

refuses to say.
7)

But the defendants MUST be told by the plaintiff (or the district court itself) the

precise and specific subject-matter jurisdiction of the cowt alleged invoked, and properly
taken by the court over the claims made in the legal action, - or he cannot even answer the
plaintiff's Complaint, - because he is prejudicially and wrongfully denied by the court the
ability to do so, by being denied the required legal due process of compelling the plaintiff
to disclose the essential information identifying the alleged fundamental constitutional
foundation for the claims for tax alleged as the legal cause of the action against the

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 3 of 19

defendants, as made in the claims made in the plaintiffs Complaint that was filed with the
court.

8)

Whereas the federal personal income tax has historically been deemed to be a granted

power for Congress tax indirectly under authority of Article I, Section 8, clause 1, of the
U.S. Constitution, i.e.: to tax by Impost, Duty, and Excise; - which taxing powers are
specifically made subject to the Rule of Uniformity;
"The great object of the Constitution was, to give Congress a power to lay
taxes, adequate to the exigencies of govemment; but they were to observe
two rules in imposing them, namely, the rule of uniformity, when they laid
duties, imposts, or excises; and the rule of apportionment, according to the
census, when they laid any direct tax.

"If there are any other species of taxes that are not direct, and not included
within the words duties, imposts, or excises, they may be laid by the rule of
uniformity, or not; as Congress shall think proper and reasonable. If the
framers of the Constitution did not contemplate other taxes than direct taxes,
and duties, imposts, and excises, there is great inaccuracy in their language.
If these four species of taxes were all that were meditated, the general power
to lay taxes was unnecessary. If it was intended, that Congress should have
authority to lay only one of the four above enumerated, to wit, direct taxes, by
the rule of apportionment, and the other three by the rule of unifomiity, the
expressions would have run thus: 'Congress shall have power to lay and
collect direct taxes, and duties, imposts, [3 U.S. 171, 174] and excises; the
first shall be laid according to the census; and the three last shall be uniform
throughout the United States.' The power, in the eighth section of the first
article, to lay and collect taxes, included a power to lay direct taxes, (whether
capitation, or any other) and also duties, imposts, and excises; and every other
species or kind of tax whatsoever, and called by any other name. Duties,
Imposts, and Excises were enumerated, after the general term taxes, only for
the purpose of declaring, that they were to be laid by the rule of uniformity.
I consider the Constitution to stand in this manner. A general power is given
to Congress, to lay and collect taxes, of every kind or nature, without any
restraint, except only on exports; but two rules are prescribed for their
government, namely, uniformity and apportionment: Three kinds of
taxes, to wit, duties, imposts, and excises by the first rule, and capitation, or
other direct taxes, by the second rule.
"I believe some taxes may be both direct and indirect at the same time. If so,
would Congress be prohibited from laying such a tax, because it is pattly a
direct tax?

3

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 4 of 19

"The Constitution evidently contemplated no taxes as direct taxes, but only
such as Congress could lay in proportion to the census. The rule of
apportionment is only to be adopted in such cases where it can reasonably
apply; and the subject taxed, must ever dete1mine the application of the rule.
If it is proposed to tax any specific article by the rule of apportionment, and it
would evidently create great inequality and injustice, it is unreasonable to say
that the Constitution intended such tax should be laid by that rule ...
"Apportionment is an operation on states, and involves valuations and
assessments, which are arbitrary, and should not be resorted to but in case of
necessity.
"Uniformity is an instant operation on individuals, without the
intervention of assessments, or any regard to states, and is at once easy,
certain, and efficacious. All taxes on expenses or consumption are indirect
taxes.
"A tax on carriages is of this kind, and of course is not a direct tax.
Indirect taxes are circuitous modes of reaching the revenue of individuals,
who generally live according to their income. In many cases of this nature the
individual may be said to tax himself. I shall close the discourse with reading
a passage or two from Smith's Wealth of Nations.
'The impossibility of taxing people in proportion to their revenue, by
any capitation, seems to have given occasion to the invention of taxes
upon consumable commodities; the state not knowing how to tax
directly and proportionally the revenue of its subjects, endeavours to
tax it indirectly by taxing their expense, which it is supposed in most
cases will be neatly in proportion to their revenue. Their expense is
taxed by taxing the consumable commodities upon which it is laid
out. (3 Vol. page 331 )' ."
Hylton v U.S., 3 U.S. 171 (1796)

"The subject matter of taxation open to the power of the Congress is as
comprehensive as that open to the power of the states, though the method of
apportionment may at times be different. "The Congress shall have power to
lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises." Art. 1, § 8. If the tax is
a direct one, it shall be apportioned according to the census or
enumeration. If it is a duty, impost, or excise, it shall be uniform
throughout the United States. Together, these classes include every form
of tax appropriate to sovereignty. Cf Burnet v. Brooks, 288 U. S. 378, 288
U. S. 403, 288 U. S. 405; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1,
240 U.S. 12." Steward Mach. Co. v. Collector, 301 U.S. 548 (1937), at 581

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 5 of 19

"The contention that the Amendment treats a tax on income as a direct
tax although it is relieved from apportionment and is necessarily therefore
not subject to the rule of uniformity as such rule only applies to taxes which
are not direct, thus destroying the two great classifications which have
been recognized and enforced from the beginning, is wholly without
foundation ... , Brushaber v. Union Pacific RR Co., 240 U.S. 1 (1916)

" ... by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th
Amendment conferred no new power of taxation, but simply prohibited the
previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by
Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of
indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged, and being placed in the
category of direct taxation subject to apportionment by a consideration of
the sources from which the income was derived, ... ", Stanton v. Baltic
Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103 (1916)

9)

And whereas Article I, Section 8, clause 1 requires that all indirect taxes be

made subject to the Rule of uniformity within, across and amongst all fifty states:

Article I, Section 8, clause 1
Congress shall have power tO' lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and
Excises ... ; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform through the
United States.

10)

And whereas, the uniformity of the authorized indirect taxation that is required

under Article I, Section 8, clause 1, has been historically held by the federal courts to be a
constitutional requirement to provide a "geographical uni{Ormity" within the imposition
and enforcement of the federal income tax that is legislated by Congress, - so that the
citizens of each and every State, where similarly economically situated to citizens in the
other forty-nine States, are all treated the same by the tax law, i.e.: uniformly across all
fifty States, - within each tax bracket, - with an equal and uniform tax that is laid and
enforced on the people of every State, in each tax-bracket.

"The [income] tax being an excise, its imposition must conform to the
canon of uniformity. There has been no departure from this requirement.

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 6 of 19

According to the settled doctrine the uniformity exacted is geographical, not
intrinsic. Knowlton v. Moore, supra, p. 178 U. S. 83; Flint v. Stone Tracy
Co., supra, p. 220 U. S. 158; Billings v. United States, 232 U. S. 261, 232
U. S. 282; Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U. S. 605, 245 U. S. 613; LaBelle Iron
Works v. United States, 256 U. S. 377, 256 U. S. 392; Poe v. Seaborn, 282
U. S. 101, 282 U. S. 117; Wright v. Vinton Branch Mountain Trust Bank,
300 U. S. 440." Steward Mach. Co. v. Collector, 301 U.S. 548 (1937), at
583

"The tax is uniform when it operates with the same force and effect in
every place where the subject of it is found. "Uniformity" means all
property belonging to the same class shall be taxed alike. it does not
signify an intrinsic, but simply a geographic, uniformity (Churchill &
Tait v. Conception, 34 Phil. 969). Uniformity does not require the same
treatment; it simply requires reasonable basis for classification.
11)

And whereas the federal district court in Eastern Virginia (Richmond) has just

recently ruled in its Orders in Case Number: 3:15cv161, that the federal income tax is
a constitutionally authorized indirect tax under Article I, Section 8, clause 1, taxing
authorities, - subject to the rule of uniformity;

12)

And whereas the federal district court of New Jersey has ruled in its Orders in

Case Number: 14-3937 (KM)(JBC), exactly the opposite, i.e.: that the federal income
tax is a direct tax without apportionment that is allegedly created as new taxing power
under the 16th Amendment, not Article I;

13)

It is therefore clear that the required geographical uniformity of the alleged

federal personal income tax has been completely destroyed by the federal district
courts and judges themselves, through the arbitrary and capricious enforcement of that
same tax in the federal district courts in the two different states as, apparently, two
entirely and fundamentally different, constitutional forms of taxation, -being both a
direct unapportioned tax in the State of New Jersey under the 16th Amendment, but

also a uniform indirect tax in the Commonwealth (State) of Virginia under Article I,
Section 81 according to the district court in Richmond Virginia, - completely
1

See exhibited Memorandum Opinion of the district court of Virginia

6

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 7 of 19

contradicting the district court's operation and enforcement in the state of New

Jersey2. Thus, geographical uniformity between the fifty States is utterly destroyed.

14)

The existence of two entirely different alleged constitutional foundations and

authorities, both as allegedly direct and indirect taxation in the two different States'
federal district courts at the same time; and the two entirely different operations at law
alleged under the U.S. Constitution at the same time, (apparently existing for the

application and enforcement of the federal personal income tax in the different federal
district courts of the different several states); - is both duplicitous and
unconstitutional because it blatantly violates the required geographical uniformity of

the tax that is required for it to be constitutionally sustainable in ANY of the federal
courts; - and therefore, this lack of required uni{Ormity (geographic uniformity) makes
enforcement of the tax in the federal district courts, of either form, both arbitrary and
capricious until the conflict is resolved in the higher courts of appeals and Supreme

Court.
15)

These facts certainly call into question which of the two subject-matter

jurisdictions that apparently exist, - the plaintiff claims in this case is applicable and

invoked against these specific defendants.
16)

And Whereas, the federal courts have no lawful ability to allow the plaintiff

United States to arbitrarily or capriciously invoke completely different taxing powers
and alleged constitutional authorities, in different civil actions against different citizens
of the several States, to enforce the same tax on income differently in the fifty several
states;

"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only power
authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by
judicial decree. It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited
jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party
asserting jurisdiction." Kokkenen V. Guardian Life ins. Co. ofAmerica, 511
us 375 (1994)

See exhibited Memorandum and Order of the district court of New Jersey

7

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 8 of 19

"Courts are constituted by authority and they cannot go beyond that power
delegated to them. If they act beyond that authority, and certainly in
contravention of it, their judgments and orders are regarded as nullities ;
they are not voidable, but simply void, and this even prior to reversal."
Williamson v. Berry, 8 HOW. 945, 540 12 L.Ed. 1170, 1189 (1850)

17)

Then these defendants do move this court to compel the plaintiff United States

to make a more definitive statement on the record of this civil action, that fully
identifies and establishes all three required elements of the alleged subject-matter
jurisdiction of the court that it is alleged by the plaintiff United States can be taken

over the action by the court, as argued in its Complaint: i.e.: (1) - the constitutional
source of the specific taxing power granted and exercised in administrative operational
practice; (2) - the constitutional source of the grant of congressional authority to write

law with respect to that power granted in (1 ); and, (3) - the specific statute enacted
with respect to the enforcement of that taxing power granted and exercised in
administrative operational practice.

18)

The pro se defendants believe the court must immediately stay all further

proceedings in this action until the specific subject-matter jurisdiction of the court, is
established by the fraudulent plaintiff, who disingenuously argues, arbitrarily and
capriciously, two completely different alleged constitutional authorities, in the

different federal district courts, in the different States of the union.

"In a long and venerable line of cases, the Supreme Court has held that,
without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only note
the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit. See, e.g., Capron v. Van
Noorden, 2 Cranch 126; Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520
U.S. 43 (1997), 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170. Bell v. Hood, supra;
National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Assn. of Railroad
Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 465, n. 13; Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524,
531; Secretary ofNavy v. Avrech, 418 U.S. 676, 678 (per curiam); United
States v. Augenblick, 393 U.S. 348 ; Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707,
721; and Chandler v. Judicial Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U.S. 74, 8688, distinguished. For a court to pronounce upon a law's meaning or

8

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 9 of 19

constitutionality when it has no jurisdiction to do so is, by very definition,
an ultra vires act." Pp. 8-17.

"Subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court's power to hear a
case, can never be forfeited or waived. Consequently, defects in subjectmatter jurisdiction require correction regardless of whether the error was
raised in district court." United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002);
Accord Jordon v. Gilligan, 500 F.2d 701 (6th CA, 1974) ("[A] court must
vacate any judgment entered in excess of its jurisdiction."); State v. Swiger,
125 Ohio.App.3d 456. (1995) ("If the trial court was without subject
matter jurisdiction of Defendant's case, his conviction and sentence would
be void ab initio."): Burrell v. Henderson, et al., 434 F.3d 826, 831 (6th
CA 2006) ('[D]enying a motion to vacate a void judgment is a per se abuse
of discretion.").

A court may not rendet a judgment which transcends the limits of its
authority, and a judgment is void if it is beyond the powers granted to the
court by the law of its otganization, even where the court has jurisdiction
over the parties and the subject matter. Thus, if a court is authorized by
statute to entertain jurisdiction in a particular case only, and undertakes to
exercise the jurisdiction conferred in a case to which the statute has no
application, the judgment rendeted is void. The lack of statutory authority to
make particular Ol'der or a judgment is akin to lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and is subject to collateral attack. 46 Am. Jur. 2d, J11dgments
§ 25, pp. 388-89.

19)

Additionally, the Supreme Court has just recently issued a decision in Sessions

v. Dimaya, #15-1498, that addresses the problem with a law, or assertion of authority
to act under law, that is so vague and ill-defined in statute or Constitutional authority
that its administration and ot enforcement by either the Executive branch, or the federal
judiciary, becomes arbitrary or capricious. In that case the justices write:
"Vague laws", Gorsuch wrote, "can invite the exercise of arbitrary power
.. . by leaving the people in the dark about what the law demands and
allowing prosecutors and courts to make it up. The law before us today is
such a law."
Kagan wrote: "The void-for-vagueness doctrine, as we have called it,
guarantees that ordinary people have 'fair notice' of the conduct a statute
proscribes,"
"And the doctrine guards against arbitrary or

9

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 10 of 19

discriminatory law enforcement by insisting that a statute provide
standards to govern the actions of police officers, prosecutors, juries and
judges."
Gorsuch wrote that "no one should be surprised that the Constitution looks
unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand its
terms and judges do not know where to begin in applying it." Sessions
v. Dimaya, 15-1498.

20)

So, how is it possible that after 100 years of income tax enforcement operations

in the federal courts, that the federal district court judges, and the plaintiff United
States cannot even consistently agree on the constitutional source of the taxing power
and authority exercised, and thus "do not know where to begin in applying if', i.e.: the
statutes, and the true force of law authorized under them?

21)

And whereas, it is not the income tax itself, that is alleged unconstitutional by

the defendants, but the arbitrary and capricious invocation by the federal district court
judges of two completely and entirely different taxing powers and alleged resultant

subject-matter jurisdictions as the alleged constitutional foundation for the federal
personal income tax, - without the constitutionally required geographical uniformity in
the enforcement of the tax within and across the fifty states by the district courts of
those fifty states, - that is constitutionally required to sustain the indirect income
taxing power that is constitutionally granted as the power to tax by Impost, Duty and

Excise;
22)

And whereas, Direct taxation of the American people, and their income, is still

constitutionally prohibited under Article I, Section 2, clause 3, and Article I, Section
9, clause 4, of the U.S. Constitution, unless the direct tax is laid in proportion to the
census and is apportioned to the "several States" for collection;
23)

And whereas, the 16th Amendment does !!.!!! remove these unrepealed and

unamended Article I limitations placed upon the direct taxation power.

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 11 of 19

"The Sixteenth Amendment, although referred to in argument, has no real
bearing and may be put out of view. As pointed out in recent decisions, it
does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects, but
merely removes all occasion, which otherwise might exist, for an
apportionment among the States of taxes laid on income, whether it be
derived from one source or another. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co.,
240 U.S. 1, 17-19; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103, 112-113.",
William E. Peck and Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165, 172-73, 38 S.Ct. 432, 433
(1918)

24)

And whereas, the controlling decision of the Supreme CoUit in McCulloch v.

State of Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819), despite holding that the enabling enforcement
powers of the Constitution were expansive (and not limiting), the coUit still held that
the Constitution forbids the use of the enabling enforcement powers, to enforce a

power that is constitutionally prohibited, as is clearly done by Article I, Section 9,
clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution with respect to disproportionate direct taxation of

income.
"... We admit, as all must admit, that the powers of the government are
limited, and that its limits are not to be transcended. But we think the
sound construction of the constitution must allow to the national legislature
that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are
to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the
high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let
the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all
means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which
are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the
constitution, are constitutional ... " McCulloch v. State of Maryland, 17 U.S.
316 (1819) (i)

25)

And whereas, the 16th Amendment does not provide for or authorize the

enforcement of a new or direct power to tax income without these extant limitations
and controls of Article I - that are still imposed on all direct taxation; - because the
Amendment does not actually contain the word "direct" in describing the tax on
income that is authorized under the Amendment; and because the McCulloch v. State of

Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819) decision prohibits the use of the constitution's enabling
enforcement authorities to effect the exercise or enforcement of any powers that are

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 12 of 19

either actually prohibited by the Constitution; are not specifically granted; or that are
inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution and its system of limitations
on the granted congressional powers; - including the taxing powers, i.e.: all indirect
taxes must be geographically uniform, and all direct taxes must be proportionately laid
under the census and apportioned only to the "several States" for payment, or they
blatantly violate the U.S. Constitution and as such, the defendants are entitled to a trial
by JURY in the matter.

"The Congress "shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts
and excises." Art. 1, § 8. If the tax is a direct one, it shall be apportioned
according to the census or enumeration. If it is a duty, impost, or excise, it
shall be uniform throughout the United States. Together, these classes
include every form of tax appropriate to sovereignty. Cf Burnet v. Brooks,
288 U.S. 378, 288 U.S. 403, 288 U.S. 405; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.
Co., 240 U. S. 1, 240 U. S. 12." Steward Mach. Co. v. Collector, 301 U.S.
548 (1937), at 581.

26)

The limitations and extant requirements and prohibitions on direct taxation, are

thus not removed by the 16th Amendment, to allow the unlimited direct taxation of
income without app01tionment, that is being wrongfully judicially imposed and

enforced on the Defendants in this case.

27)

And whereas, previous to the adoption of the 16th Amendment the taxation of

income had been repeatedly upheld as a legitimate exercise of the indirect taxing

powers given to Congress, to tax by excise under authority granted by Article I, Section
8. see Springer v. U.S., 102 U.S. 586, 26 L. ed. 253 (1880); Pollock v. Farmer's Loan
& Trust, 158 U.S. 601, (1895); Pacific Ins. Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 19 L. ed. 95;

"The act now under consideration does not impose direct taxation upon
property solely because of its ownership, but the tax is within the class
which Congress is authorized to lay and collect under article 1, 8, clause 1
of the Constitution, and described generally as taxes, duties, imposts, and
excises, upon which the limitation is that they shall be uniform throughout
the United States.
Within the category of indirect taxation, as we shall have further occasion to
show, is embraced a tax upon business done in a corporate capacity, which
is the subject-matter of the tax imposed in the act under consideration. The
Pollock Case construed the tax there levied as direct, because it was
imposed upon property simply because of its ownership. In the present case
the tax is not payable unless there be a carrying on or doing of business in
the designated capacity, and this is made the occasion for the tax, measured
by the standard prescribed. The difference between the acts is not merely
nominal, but rests upon substantial differences between the mere ownership
of property and the actual doing of business in a certain way." Flint v.
Stone Tracy Co., 220 US 107, 150 (1911)

'We think that they were used comprehensively, to cover customs and
excise duties imposed on importation, consumption, manufacture, and sale
of certain commodities, privileges, particular business transactions,
vocations, occupations, and the like.'
Duties and imposts are terms commonly applied to levies made by
governments on the importation or exportation of commodities. Excises are
'taxes laid upon the manufacture, sale, or consumption of commodities
within the country, upon licenses to pursue certain occupations, and upon
corporate privileges.' Cooley, Const. Lim. 7th ed. 680.
The tax under consideration, as we have construed the statute, may be
described as an excise upon the particular privilege of doing business in a
corporate capacity, i.e., with the advantages which arise from corporate or
quasi corporate organization; or, when applied to insurance companies, for
doing the business of such companies. As was said in the Thomas Case, 192
U. S. supra, the requirement to pay such taxes involves the exercise of
privileges, and the element of absolute and unavoidable demand is lacking.
If business is not done in the manner described in the statute, no tax is
payable.

If we are correct in holding that this is an excise tax, there is nothing in the
Constitution requiring such taxes to be apportioned according to population.

28)

Then it is clear that, because of the two diametrically opposing decisions in the

two different cases referenced herein; - in the two different federal district courts in the
two different States of the union (Virginia and New Jersey); then, this district court
cannot factually establish the required geographical uniformity within the fifty States

that is still constitutionally required of all indirect taxation in this case, because
regardless of what it attempts to do in this case, it will irrefutably contradict what
one of the district courts in the other two States are doing; - and to be a constitutional

enforcement operation at Law, they must all be doing the same thing in every district
court in every State.

The Supreme Comt has repeatedly told the federal judiciary it may not rely
on a conclusive presumption to find against a defendant on an essential
element of a cause of action. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510,
521-523, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2458-2459 (1979); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S.
645, 654-657, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1214-1216 (1972); Heiner v. Donnan, 285
U.S. 312, 325-29, 52 S.Ct. 358, 360-362 (1932); Schlesinger v. State of
Wisconsin, 270 U.S. 230, 46 S.Ct. 260 (1926); Tot v. United States, 319
U.S. 463, 468-69, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1245-1246 (1943); Vlandis v. Kline, 412
. U.S. 441, 446, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2233 (1973); Grupo Mex,icano de Desarrollo
S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318-19, 119 S.Ct. 1961,
1977 (1999), and Jones v. Bolles, 76 U.S. 364, 368 (1869).

29)

Therefore, since this district court itself cannot change the other district court

decisions; then it also cannot make a declaration on this fundamental subject-matter
jurisdiction issue with finality, without destroying the geographical uniformity
required throughout the several States that is constitutionally required in the

enforcement of the tax by the federal judiciary (by it1·efutably being in conflict with
one of the other decisions of the Virginia and New Jersey district courts).

30)

Nor may this district court lawfully enforce a constitutionally prohibited

direct taxing power, as it is improperly attempting to do by allowing the plaintiff to

seek the enforcement of a direct, unapportioned, disproportionately imposed direct tax

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 15 of 19

under alleged authority of the 16th Amendment, which is what the plaintiff's IRS has
irrefutably assessed in operational practice.
31)

The Defendants therefore objects to further proceedings in this district court

until a more definitive statement is provided by the plaintiff United States providing
the formal identification and establishment, on the record of the action in the court, of
all three required elements of the fully granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the
court that it is alleged to exist and can be taken by the court over this action as argued
by the plaintiff.

32)

Jurisdiction of the court cannot be taken under statutes alone, without the clear

and specific identification and establishment of the constitutional foundational
elements that apply and that are relied upon by the plaintiff to file its Complaint.
"So, we conclude, as we did in the prior case, that, although these suits may
sometimes so present questions arising under the Constitution or laws of the
United States that the Federal courts will have jurisdiction, yet the mere fact that
a suit is an adverse suit authorized by the statutes of Congress is not in and of
itself sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the Federal courts." Shoshone Mining Co.
v. Rutter, 177 U.S. 505, 513 (1900).

"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only power
authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by
judicial decree. It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited
jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party
asserting jurisdiction." Kokkenen V. Guardian Life ins. Co. of America, 511
us 375 (1994)
It remains rudimentary law that "[a]s regards all comts of the United States
inferior to this tribunal, two things are necessary to create jurisdiction,
whether original or appellate. The Constitution must have given to the
court the capacity to take it, and an act of Congress must have supplied it
.... To the extent that such action is not taken, the power lies dormant." The
Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 24 7, 252, 18 L.Ed. 851 (1868); accord,
Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Co., 486 U.S. 800, 818, 108
S.Ct. 2166, 2179, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988); Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.
v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 379-380, 101 S.Ct. 669, 676-677, 66 L.Ed.2d
571 (1981); Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226, 233-234, 43
S.Ct. 79, 82-83, 67 L.Ed. 226 (1922); Case of the Sewing Machine

33)

Therefore, the Defendants both

~

and urges this district court to

immediately stay all further proceedings in this action and compel the plaintiff United
States to properly make a more complete and definitive statement on the record of the
action, making the complete identification and full and proper disclosure and
establishment of the

fully~granted

subject-matter jurisdiction alleged to exist in order

for the comt to be able to take jurisdiction over the specific claims made by the
plaintiffs Complaint in this legal action.

"Court must prove on the record, all jurisdiction facts related to the
jurisdiction asserted." Latana v. Hopper, 102 F.2d 188; Chicago v. New
York, 37 F.Supp. 150

"A judgment is void if the court acted in a manner inconsistent with due
process. A void judgment is a nullity and may be vacated at any time." ·In
re Marriage ofHampshire, 261 Kan. 854, 862, 934 P.2d 58 (1997).

"The consequences of an act beyond the court's jurisdiction in the
fundamental sense differ from the consequences of an act in excess of
jurisdiction. An act beyond a court's jurisdiction in the fundamental sense
is void; it may be set aside at any time and no valid rights can accrue
thereunder." People v. Ruiz, (1990) 217 Cal. App. 3d 574, 265 Cal. Rptr.
886

"However late this objection has been made, or may be made in any cause,
in an inferior or appellate court of the United States, it must be considered
and decided, before any court can move one further step in the cause; as
any movement is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the
power to hear and determine the subject matter in controversy between
parties to a suit, to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power over them;
the question is, whether on the case before a court, their action is judicial
or extra-judicial; with or without the authority of law, to render a

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 53 Filed 06/05/18 Page 17 of 19

judgment or decree upon the rights of the litigant parties." State of Rhode
lslandv. Com. ofMassachusetts, 37 U.S. 657, 718 (1838)

"Judgment is a "void judgment" if court that rendered judgment lacked
jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or acted in a manner
inconsistent with due process." Klugh v. US., D.C.S.C., 610 F.Supp. 892,
901.

"Void judgments are those rendered by a court which lacked jurisdiction,
either of the subject matter or the parties," Wahl v. Round Valley Bank 38
Ariz. 411, 300 P. 955 (1931); Tube City Mining & Milling Co. v. Otterson,
16 Ariz. 305, 146 P. 203 (1914); and Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 61
S.Ct. 339, 85 L.Ed. 2d 278 (1940).

"A void judgment is one that has been procured by extrinsic or collateral
fraud or entered by a comt that did not have jurisdiction over the subject
matter or the parties." Rook v. Rook, 233 Va. 92, 95, 353 S.E.2d 756, 758

ENDNOTES
McCulloch v. State of Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819)

"The subject is the execution of those great powers on which the welfare of a nation essentially
depends. It must have been the intention of those who gave these powers, to insure, so far as
human prudence could insure, their beneficial execution. This could not be done, by confiding
the choice of means to such narrow limits as not to leave it in the power of congress to adopt any
which might be appropriate, and which were conducive to the end. This provision is made in a
constitution, intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various
crises of human affairs. To have prescribed the means by which government should, in all future
time, execute its powers, would have been to change, entirely, the character of the instrument,
and give it the properties of a legal code. It would have been an unwise attempt to provide, by
immutable rules, for exigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly, and which
can be best provided for as they occur. To have declared, that the best means shall not be used,
but those alone, without which the power given would be nugatory, would have been to deprive
the legislature of the capacity to avail itself of experience, to exercise its reason, and to
accommodate its legislation to circumstances. If we apply this principle of construction to any of
the powers of the government, we shall find it so pernicious in its operation that we shall be
compelled to discard it. ....
i

The baneful influence of this narrow construction on all the operations of the government, and
the absolute impracticability of maintaining it, without rendering the government incompetent to
its great objects, might be illustrated by numerous examples drawn from the constitution, and
from our laws. The good sense of the public has pronounced, without hesitation, that the power
of punishment appertains to sovereignty, and may be exercised, whenever the sovereign .has a
right to act, as incidental to his constitutional powers. It is a means for carrying into execution
all sovereign powers, and may be used, although not indispensably necessary. It is a right
incidental to the power, and conducive to its beneficial exercise .... We think so for the following
reasons: 1st. The clause is placed among the powers of congress, not among the limitations on
those powers. 2nd. Its terms purport to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the
government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted. No
reason has been, or can be assigned, for thus concealing an intention to narrow the discretion of
the national legislature, under words which purport to enlarge it. The framers of the constitution
wished its adoption, and well knew that it would be endangered by its strength, not by its
weakness ....
We admit, as all must admit, that the powers of the government are limited, and that its limits
are not to be transcended. But we think the sound construction of the constitution must allow to
the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers
are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned
to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the
scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that
end, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are
constitutional ... " McCulloch v. State ofMaryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819)
