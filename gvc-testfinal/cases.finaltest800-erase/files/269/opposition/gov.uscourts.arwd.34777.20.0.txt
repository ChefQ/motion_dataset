NISRA, LLC, and
CENTENNIAL BANK f/IrJa COMMUNITY BANK

DEFENDANTS

ORDER

Comes now before the Court Defendants' separate Motions.to Stay Proceedings Pending
Arbitration and Defendants' Mot,ion to Quash. Upon a review ofthe pleadings and after hearing
argument of counsel. the Court, being well and sufficiently advised, for its Order finds:
This is the second occasion which the Court has had to visit this issue. The Court denied
the previous motions to stay. Defendants have now filed motions correcting procedural
deficiencies and requesting the Court to state the grounds for its denial of the motions if the

Court's ruling remains unchanged.
MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS

The Court makes the following findings with respect to the Motions to Stay:

14:40 JUDGE Sh1EN TABOR

(fh.<u479 784 1527

P.003/0C[pQ

"
(1) As to Defendant Centennial Bank there is no mutuality ofobligation. Therefore, its
Motion to Stay should be and hereby is denied.
(2) As to Defendant NISHA, A.C.A. 16-108-201 states an agreement to arbitrate is not

binding as to tort matters. NISRA does not d~spute Plain:tifrs Amended Complaint sets forth tort
claims but alleges they are all truly contractual in their nature. The Court does not agree. The
conduct alleged in the Amended Complaint sets forth some claims which) if1rue, represent a
foreseeable, unreasonable risk ofhann to Plaintiffs interests. Those claims as allege!i sound
legitimately in tort rather than as a derivation of the contract issues. The Amended and
Substituted Complaint sets forth seven (7) counts against NISRA for which recovery is sought.

.

In the Court's opinion, the following counts are tortious in nature:
Count Five - DefamationIFalse Light
Count Six - Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act
Count Seven - Interference with business expectancy
All other counts, in the Court's view, are contractual in their essential nature and would
be subject to the binding arbitration provision.

(3) It was the Court's reasoning in its previous Order that judicial economy dictated the
retention of all claims if some were tortious in nature. Further research has convinced the Court
its reasoning was flawed. The Court is now convinced the proper course is for it to retain
jurisdiction of the tort claims against Defendant NISHA and all claims against Defendant
-,.. ... . - . _. ­
Centennial Bank and to stay all proceedings as to the remaining claims against Defendant
~-

NISRA pending the completion of arbitration proceedings. See generally eEl Engineering
Associates, Inc. V. Elder Construction Coo, 2009 Ark. App. 259. In summary, the Motions to

Stay ate granted as to Counts One, Two, Three and Four of the Amended and Substituted
Complaint and denied in all other respects.

14:40 JUDGE Slt' ··..{EN TABOR

i

MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA
The Motion to Quash as it relates to the scheduled deposition ofMr. Mark Rezailka is
denied. The Court anticipates some of the deposition testimony may relate to some counts on
which action has been stayed insofar as it overlaps and relates to the counts retained by this
Court. In balancing those interests. the Court does not foresee prejudice

to Defendants such as

would warrant a delay or which would justify the Court's micro-management ofthe deposition.
However, participation in the deposition by defense counsel may not be relied upon or presented
as evidence of a waiver ofDefendants' demands for arbitration or to their objections to this
Court's jurisdiction of this matter.
IT IS SO ORDERED this 12th day ofJanuary, 201O.

Ms. Tipton,
My name is Don Overton and 1 represent NlSHA, LLC. I am sending this letter as fonnal written notiee that as of
today, November 5, 2009 there are unpaid subcontractors and/or material suppliers on the project know as Country
Inn & Suites, Conway Arkansas.
As the bond issuer of record, let this serve as your notice that TriBuilt Construction Group, LLC ("TriBuilt") owes

more funds to SubcontractorsJs~pp\iers

fOT

this project than there is retainage left in this project.

The owner offuis project has been requesting, for two months, that TriBuilt comply with the terms oftheir contract
and supply the owner with "Unconditional Lien Waivers" for each and every supplier/subcontractor that has
completed delivery of materials or completed work through the CO date of 8/21/2009_ TriBuilt bas been unable to
comply with this request and we have directed the subcontractors/suppliers that are still owed funds on this project
to contact your office to make a claim against the bonds that were issued by your office for thls project. I have
attached a copy of the bonds to this letter for your convenience.

I have requested an updated list from TriBuilt of all parties that are still owed funds on this project so that we all
may have an accUTate record to try and get this situation settled. As of this date I have yet to receive a response from
tribuilt to this request. I have attached a printout that was received by NlSHA, LLC previously that listed
$664,169.09 in outstanding Accounts Payable for this project against a retainage balance that is less than balf of this
amount.
1am aware that your office will possibly make a claim against the retainage to mitigate your loss on the payment
bond payout,' and those funds are secure.
Please feel free to contact me at you earliest convenience if you have any questions or need further documentation to
settle this matter.

the work, including time extensions, approved or pena~ng; (4) a
schedule of payments made and retention "lithheldj (S) whether
