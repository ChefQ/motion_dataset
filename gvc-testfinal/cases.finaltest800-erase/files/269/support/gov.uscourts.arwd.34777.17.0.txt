PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

INTRODUCTION
The Plaintiff is an Arkansas corporation with its principal place of business in Sebastian
County. The Defendant is an insurance company which issued bonds to the Plaintiff as part of
the Plaintiff's agreement to construct a hotel in Conway for NISHA, the owner.
The Plaintiff is engaged in litigation with the owner of the project and its bank in an
effort to obtain final payment for the hotel pursuant to the contract between the owner and the
Plaintiff. Because of the owner's refusal to pay, the Plaintiff was unable to pay all of the
subcontractors, and was forced to litigate with the owner and its bank.

Filed 06/04/10 Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 271

Because of the failure of the owner of the project to pay the Plaintiff for its work, the
Plaintiff has placed in a severe cash flow situation, and has been unable to pay its attorneys' fees.
Because of that, the attorneys and the Plaintiff entered into a tentative contingent fee agreement.
In this matter, the Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that its tentative attorneys' fee
agreement is reasonable and should be approved. Moreover, the Plaintiff seeks a declaration that
the Defendant be required to honor the Plaintiff's contingent fee arrangement with its attorneys,
so that the Plaintiff's attorneys do not have to disgorge fees at a later date.
Even though this case is not a petition to the Court for attorneys' fees, the Plaintiff
suggest that cases in which fee petitions have been decided are similar to this case, and provide
any appropriate framework within which to decide the reasonableness of the Plaintiff's
contingent fee agreement with its attorneys. Particularly, the authorities cited in this brief will
demonstrate the reasonableness of the percent of the contingent fee.
At issue here is whether the Plaintiff is free to engage its attorneys on its own terms and
have that agreement honored by its bonding company.

ARGUMENT
A.

Twenty-four percent or higher is typical in the context of class action
settlements.

A thorough judicial review of fee applications is required in all class action settlements.
In re Diet Drugs, 582 F.3d 524, 537-38 (3d Cir. 2009); Johnston v. Comerica Mortgage Corp.,
83 F.3d 241, 246 (8th Cir. 1996) (noting that the district court bears the responsibility of
scrutinizing attorney fee requests). Courts utilize two main approaches to analyzing a request for

2

Filed 06/04/10 Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 272

attorney fees: (1) the 'lodestar' methodology (multiplying the hours expended by an attorney's
reasonable hourly rate of compensation to produce a fee amount that can be adjusted to reflect
the individualized characteristics of a given action); and (2) the 'percentage of the benefit'
approach (permitting an award of fees that is equal to some fraction of the common fund that the
attorneys were successful in gathering during the course of the litigation). Johnston, 83 F.3d at
244-45. Which method to apply is within the district court’s discretion. Id. Courts have
approved the percentage-of-recovery methodology to evaluate attorneys' fees in common-fund
settlement class action cases. In re US Bancorp Litig., 291 F.3d 1035, 1038 (8th Cir. 2002)
(approving an award of 36% of the settlement fund); Petrovic, 200 F.3d at 1157 (approving
award of 24% of monetary compensation to the class). To recover fees from a common fund,
attorneys must demonstrate that their services were of some benefit to the fund or that they
enhanced the adversarial process. In Re US Bancorp Litig., 291 F.3d at 1038. Brehm v. Capital
Growth Fin., LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9569 (D. Neb. Feb. 4, 2010).
B.

Twenty-four percent or higher is appropriate for contract/tort "hybrid"
litigation.

A contingency agreement for one-third of all sums recovered is a factor to be considered
in determining reasonable fees.

See Phelps v. U. S. Credit Life Ins. Co., 340 Ark. 439,

10 S.W.3d 854 (Arkansas Supreme Court approved attorney's fee award based upon a
contingency fee arrangement, holding that the trial court properly considered the fact that the
plaintiff's attorney took the case on a contingency basis as a factor in arriving at a reasonable
fee). The Arkansas courts have approved awards based on contingency fees that exceeded the
hourly rate. See, e.g., Southern Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co. v. Cowger, 295 Ark. 250, 748 S.W.2d

332 (1988) (awarding one-third contingency fee that was approximately three times the hourly
rate); Home Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Jones, 63 Ark. App. 221, 977 S.W.2d 12 (1998) (awarding
40% contingency fee that was approximately two times the hourly rate). Similarly, it is not
uncommon for an award of reasonable attorney's fees to exceed the amount of the judgment,
particularly in cases in which every issue was raised by the defense and aggressively litigated.
See, e.g., Perry v. Baptist Health, 368 Ark. 114, 243 S.W.3d 310 (2006) (award of attorney's fees
in amount of $65,000 to defendant hospital reasonable even though plaintiff's $1,000,000 claim
was reduced to $26,000 in initial claim, and $4,000 was at issue in counterclaim; case was long
and involved legal struggle, which culminated in a jury trial and hospital produced evidence it
incurred approximately $100,000 in legal expenses); TCBY Systems, Inc. v. RSP Co., Inc. 33
F.3d 925 (8th Cir. 1994) (affirming award of $95,363 in attorney's fees under Ark. Code Ann. §
16-22-308 following five-day trial that resulted in damages award of $ 70,000); Parker v.
Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., 326 Ark. 1073, 935 S.W.2d 556 (1996) (award of attorney's
fees five times the sum award approved as reasonable where insured prevailed against
automobile insurer on breach of contract claim, but not on related bad faith suit claim, even
though amount recovered on breach of contract claim was less than one fifth amount of
attorney's fees, where issues were intricately connected and difficult to separate from one
another, and matter was vigorously defended on both bad faith and breach of contract issues)."
All-Ways Logistics, Inc. v. USA Truck, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92037, 37-39 (E.D. Ark.
Dec. 4, 2007).

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein, the Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on its claim.
The Court should hold Plaintiff’s attorneys are entitled to the contingent fee for which they
contracted, and that the Defendant be required to honor that contingent fee arrangement so that
Plaintiff’s attorneys are not required to disgorge fees at a later date.
